 'The' aryl hydrocarbon receptor ( 'AhR)' mediates a<b> variety of biological responses to ubiquitous environmental pollutants</b>.    'In' this study the effect of administration of & 'beta;-naphthoflavone' ( 'BNF),' potent 'AhR' 'ligand,' on the expression of 'AhR,' 'AhRR,' 'CYP1A1,' 'CYP1A2,' 'CYP1B1,' 'NQO1,' 'GSTA1,' 'ALDH3A1' and 'UGT1A' genes encoding the<b> enzymes</b> controlled by 'AhR' were examined in thirteen laryngeal tumor cell lines and in 'HepaRG' cell line.   <b> 'Our' results strongly</b> suggest predominant effect of 'DNA' methylation on induction of 'CYP1A1' expression by 'AhR' ligands as well.    'Hypoxia' promotes<b> genetic instability and is therefore an important factor in carcinogenesis</b>.   <b> 'We'</b> have previously shown that activation of the hypoxia responsive transcription factor 'HIF&alpha;' can enhance the mutagenic phenotype induced by the environmental mutagen 'benzo[a]pyrene' ( 'BaP)'.   <b> 'Cells' under hypoxia</b> have a reduced capacity to metabolise 'BaP' leaving more of the parent molecule intact.   <b> 'The' delayed detoxification kinetics resulted in a 1.5-fold</b> increase in 'DNA' adducts.   <b> 'These' data</b> indicate that the metabolism under hypoxic conditions has shifted towards increased activation of 'BaP' instead of detoxification and support the idea that modulation of carcinogen metabolism is an important additional mechanism for the observed 'HIF1' mediated genetic instability.   <b> 'Genes' and proteins</b> involved in metabolism and detoxification of xenobiotics are often used as susceptibility markers to diseases with environmental risk factors.   <b> 'AHR,' 'PPARG,' and 'CEBPB' were highly</b> expressed in placenta.    'The' placenta is a hormonal 'tissue,' and one needs to maintain<b> the 'tissue-specific' focus by removing the hepatic spectacles</b>.   <b> 'First,' we fed 'Apoe&#8315;/&#8315;' mice an atherogenic diet plus 'BaP' and</b> found that oral 'BaP-enhanced' atherosclerosis is associated with increased reactive oxygen species ( 'ROS)' and inflammatory 'markers,' such as plasma tumor necrosis factor levels and aortic mRNA expression of vascular endothelial growth factor 'A' ( 'Vegfa)'.   <b> 'BaP-induced' 'DNA' adduct formation was</b> increased in the aorta of 'Cyp1a1&#8315;/&#8315;' 'mice,' but not 'wild-type' or 'Apoe&#8315;/&#8315;' 'mice,' and the atherogenic diet decreased 'BaP-induced' 'DNA' adducts in 'Cyp1a1&#8315;/&#8315;' mice compared with mice on a control diet.   <b> 'Together' with our previously</b> reported systemic 'REPs' from a mouse 'study,' these data do not warrant the use of systemic 'REPs' as systemic 'TEFs' for human risk assessment.   <b> 'Although' 'SUN'</b> has improved survival rate in cancer 'patients,' cardiotoxicity has been reported as a significant side effect.   <b> 'Several' studies</b> suggested a role for the aryl hydrocarbon receptor ( 'AhR)' and its regulated genes such as cytochrome 'P4501A1' ( 'CYP1A1)' in the pathogenesis of heart failure and cardiac hypertrophy.    'We' exposed embryos from these two populations to surrogate model 'PAHs' and analyzed changes in gene 'expression,' 'morphology,' and cardiac physiology in order to better understand sensitivity and adaptive resistance mechanisms mediating<b> 'PAH' exposure during development</b>.    'By' correlating cardiac physiology and morphology with changes in gene expression patterns of reference and resistant 'embryos,' we provide<b> additional evidence for acquired resistance among embryos whose parents live at heavily contaminated sites</b>.   <b> 'Importantly,' both the</b> increase in sympathetic tone and overexpression of eNOS within the vasculature were reversed when 'ABP' was returned to normal.   <b> 'Moreover,' 'most,' but not 'all,' 'AhR-regulated' 'CYPs' are</b> expressed differently in most of the neuronal and glial cells.   <b> 'Protein-protein' docking also confirms that</b> induced levels of 'AHR' inhibit the 'neurogenesis-related' transcription factor ( 'CREB)' with maximum docking scores.   <b> 'In' this 'context,' recent research</b> has indicated that human 'Wharton&#39;s' 'Jelly-derived' mesenchymal stem cells ( 'hWJs)' represent an interesting stem cell population to develop human 'hepatocyte-like' cells.   <b> 'On' the 'contrary,' transcription factors</b> involved in liver development ( 'GATA4,' 'GATA6,' 'SOX9' and 'SOX17)' and liver progenitor markers ( 'DKK1,' 'DPP4,' 'DSG2,' 'CX43' and 'K19)' were found to be highly expressed in hWJs.   <b>) 'There'</b> has been much clinical success with inhibitors of 'CYPs' involved in hormone synthesis.   <b> 'While' much progress</b> has been made towards understanding the role of 'CYPs' in extrahepatic 'tissue,' future studies focused on the development of selective inhibitors coupled with appropriate delivery systems that would target the tumor 'micro-environments' could lead to significant advancement in chemotherapeutic strategies.   <hr>:- dynamic relacion/1.
