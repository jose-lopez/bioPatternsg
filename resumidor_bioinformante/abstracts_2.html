Western and immunohistochemical analyses disclosed accumulation of a large amount of the aberrant NER product, generated by alternative splicing that caused skipping of an exon corresponding to the DNA-binding domain, in the nucleoli of cells of cancer cell lines and primary cancer tissues. The aberrant protein was detected in 116 of 228 primary cancers developed in various tissues including breast and colon, but was absent in the corresponding normal tissues; it was also detected in 31 of 39 cancer cell lines. This observation may imply that the aberrant NER product has some relation to the development and/or progression of cancers in a variety of human tissues.
Genotoxic agents produce numerous cellular responses that are principally dedicated to maintain or restore DNA integrity. In human cells, nucleotide excision repair (NER) is one of the major pathways for the repair of DNA damage such as ultraviolet (UV) radiation-induced lesions. Endocrine disrupting compounds are environmental contaminants that interfere with the function of the endocrine system. Among them, the natural estrogen 17beta-estradiol (E(2)) exhibits the most potent activity. Some proteins directly or indirectly involved in NER also fulfill other functions such as transcription, DNA damage checkpoints or cell cycle. Moreover, steroids such as E(2) are believed to interact with a large number of proteins including some involved in NER and DNA damage checkpoint control. We therefore investigated the potential modulation of genotoxic stress-cells responses by E(2) treatment. Estrogen receptor (ER)-positive human breast cancer cells were submitted to E(2) before and/or after UVB irradiation and thereafter the repair kinetics of UV-induced DNA damage were evaluated. We report here that the repair rate of UVB-induced DNA damage is enhanced when cells are submitted to an estrogenic stimulation. Moreover, our results suggest that this response could be mediated by cell cycle regulatory proteins in a p53-independent manner.
The estrogen receptor (ER) and aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) are ligand-activated transcription factors involved in estrogen or xenobiotic exposure, whereas the 90-kDa heat shock protein (HSP90), which is a ubiquitously expressed molecular chaperone, is involved in the signal transduction process. Although the interactions between these pathways have been under investigation, the mechanisms are unclear and the potential role of HSP90 in these interactions has not been reported. The results of goldfish primary hepatocytes showed that exposure to PCB77 and 17β-estradiol (E2) alone induced significant protein expression of cytochrome P450 1A (CYP1A) and vitellogenin (VTG), respectively. On the other hand, the combined exposure to PCB77 and E2 led to the reduction of CYP1A and VTG compared to the single treatments. Although the AhRs and ERs were naturally induced during the co-treatment, the total amount of HSP90 binding to the receptors was not changed. Furthermore, while the HSP90 chaperon activity was blocked by the specific inhibitor (geldanamycin), reciprocal inhibition between AhR and ER pathways was not observed. These findings indicate a potential role of HSP90 where competition between AhR and ER for binding to HSP90 can occur and cause reciprocal inhibition. 
Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), a potentially toxic perfluorinated compound (PFC), has been widely disseminated in the environment. In the present study, rare minnows (Gobiocypris rarus) exposed to PFOA exhibited histopathological gill damage, including epithelial hyperplasia of the lamellae, inflammatory cell infiltration, and lamellar fusion. Cytochrome P450s (CYPs) play a central role in the metabolism and biotransformation of a wide range of endogenous substrates and foreign compounds. Thus, we studied the CYPs and the effects of waterborne PFOA on their corresponding mRNA levels in the gills of rare minnows. Two novel CYP cDNAs (CYP1A and CYP3A) were identified in rare minnow and their mRNAs were ubiquitously expressed in all tissues examined. Upregulation of CYP3A mRNA was observed in the gills of male rare minnows exposed to 30mg/L PFOA, while no significant changes occurred in exposed females. In contrast, down regulation of CYP1A mRNA was detected in the gills of male and female minnows exposed to PFOA. However, the effect of PFOA on gill mRNA levels of their potential regulators, aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) for CYP1A, and pregnane X receptor (PXR) for CYP3A, were not consistent with the observed effects of PFOA on the corresponding CYP mRNA concentrations. This suggests a different or more complex transcriptional regulation of CYP expression following PFOA exposure.
C/EBP-homologous protein (CHOP) is a ubiquitously expressed stress-inducible transcription factor robustly induced by maladaptive endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stresses in a wide variety of cells. Here, we examined a novel function of Sigma 1 receptor (Sigmar1) in regulating CHOP expression under ER stress in cardiomyocytes. We also defined Sigmar1-dependent activation of the adaptive ER-stress pathway in regulating CHOP expression. We used adenovirus-mediated Sigmar1 overexpression as well as Sigmar1 knockdown by siRNA in neonatal rat ventricular cardiomyocytes (NRCs); to induce ER stress, cardiomyocytes were treated with tunicamycin. Sigmar1-siRNA knockdown significantly increased the expression of CHOP and significantly induced cellular toxicity by sustained activation of ER stress in cardiomyocytes. Sigmar1 overexpression decreased the expression of CHOP and significantly decreased cellular toxicity in cells. Using biochemical and immunocytochemical experiments, we also defined the specific ER-stress pathway associated with Sigmar1-dependent regulation of CHOP expression and cellular toxicity. We found that Sigmar1 overexpression significantly increased inositol requiring kinase 1α (IRE1α) phosphorylation and increased spliced X-box-binding proteins (XBP1s) expression as well as nuclear localization. In contrast, Sigmar1 knockdown significantly decreased IRE1α phosphorylation and decreased XBP1s expression as well as nuclear transport. Taken together, these results indicate that Sigmar1-dependent activation of IRE1α-XBP1s ER-stress response pathways are associated with inhibition of CHOP expression and suppression of cellular toxicity. Hence, Sigmar1 is an essential component of the adaptive ER-stress response pathways eliciting cellular protection in cardiomyocytes.
Glucocorticoids are vital for life and regulate an array of physiological functions by binding to the ubiquitously expressed glucocorticoid receptor (GR, also known as NR3C1). Previous studies demonstrate striking breed differences in plasma cortisol levels in pigs. However, investigation into the breed-dependent GR transcriptional regulation is hampered by lacking porcine GR promoter information. In this study, we sequenced 5.3 kb upstream of the translation start codon of the porcine GR gene, and identified seven alternative 5'-untranslated exons 1-4, 1-5, 1-6, 1-7, 1-8, 1-9,10 and 1-11. Among all these mRNA variants, exons 1-4 and 1-5, as well as the total GR were expressed significantly (P&lt;0.05) higher in the liver of newborn piglets of Large White (LW) compared with Erhualian, a Chinese indigenous breed. Overall level of CpG methylation in the region flanking exons 1-4 and 1-5 did not show breed difference. However, nuclear content of Sp1, p-CREB and GR in the liver was significantly (P&lt;0.05) higher in LW piglets, associated with enhanced binding of p-CREB, and higher level of histone H3 acetylation in 1-4 and 1-5 promoters. In contrast, GR binding to promoters of exons 1-4 and 1-5 was significantly diminished in LW piglets, implicating the presence of negative GREs. These results indicate that the difference in the hepatic expression of GR transcript variants between two breeds of pigs is determined, at least partly, by the disparity in the binding of transcription factors and the enrichment of histone H3 acetylation to the promoters.
By behaving as molecular hubs, scaffold proteins can assemble a large number of signaling molecules and organize complicated intracellular signaling networks in time and space. Owing to their crucial role in mediating intracellular signaling related to tumor cell growth and migration, recent studies have highlighted the relevance of scaffold proteins in human cancers and indicated that interfering with their expression and/or their ability to bind effector proteins can inhibit cancer progression. Here, we show that receptor for activated C-kinase 1 (RACK1), a ubiquitously expressed scaffolding protein, plays a crucial regulatory role in tumor growth. Using an RNA silencing approach, we found that downregulation of RACK1 expression in HeLa and A673 tumor cells markedly suppressed the proliferation and invasion of these cells in vitro and tumor development in vivo. Consequently, we found that significant suppression of constitutive phosphorylation of Akt and MAPK by RACK1 silencing may contribute to the inhibition of tumor growth. Moreover, RACK1 silencing significantly attenuated tumor-associated angiogenesis by, at least in part, inhibiting the expression of two critical angiogenic factors, namely vascular endothelial growth factor-B and fibroblast growth factor 2. The results of the present study show that RACK1 is a potent enhancer of tumor growth and, thus, a potential anti-cancer therapeutic target.
The examination of scaffold attachment factor B1 (SAFB1) and its multiple functions and tasks in cellular processes provides insight into its role in diseases, such as cancer. SAFB1 is a large multi-domain protein with well-described functions in transcriptional repression, and RNA splicing. It is ubiquitously expressed, and has been shown to be important in numerous cellular processes including cell growth, stress response, and apoptosis. SAFB1 is part of a protein family with at least two other family members, SAFB2 and the SAFB-like transcriptional modulator SLTM. The goal of this prospect article is to summarize known functions of SAFB1, and its roles in cellular processes, but also to speculate on less well described, novel attributes of SAFB1, such as a potential role in chromatin organization. This timely review shows aspects of SAFB1, which are proving to have a complexity far greater than was previously thought.
The Glucocorticoid Receptor (GR) is a transcription factor ubiquitously expressed in the brain. Activation of brain GRs by high levels of glucocorticoid (GC) hormones modifies a large variety of physiological and pathological-related behaviors. Unfortunately the specific cellular targets of GR-mediated behavioral effects of GC are still largely unknown. To address this issue, we generated a mutated form of the GR called DeltaGR. DeltaGR is a constitutively transcriptionally active form of the GR that is localized in the nuclei and activates transcription without binding to glucocorticoids. Using the tetracycline-regulated system (Tet-OFF), we developed an inducible transgenic approach that allows the expression of the DeltaGR in specific brain areas. We focused our study on a mouse line that expressed DeltaGR almost selectively in the glutamatergic neurons of the dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampus. This restricted expression of the DeltaGR increased anxiety-related behaviors without affecting other behaviors that could indirectly influence performance in anxiety-related tests. This behavioral phenotype was also associated with an up-regulation of the MAPK signaling pathway and Egr-1 protein in the DG. These findings identify glutamatergic neurons in the DG as one of the cellular substrate of stress-related pathologies.
Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP(3)) receptors (IP(3)Rs) are large, ubiquitously expressed, endoplasmic reticulum membrane proteins that form tetrameric IP(3) and Ca(2+)-gated Ca(2+) channels. Endogenous IP(3)Rs provide very appealing tools for studying the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway in intact mammalian cells because, upon activation, they are rapidly ubiquitinated and degraded. Using mass spectrometry, we previously examined the ubiquitination of IP(3)R1 in αT3-1 pituitary gonadotrophs and found that IP(3)R1 ubiquitination is highly complex, with receptors being modified at multiple sites by monoubiquitin and polyubiquitin chains formed through both Lys-48 and Lys-63 linkages (Sliter, D. A., Kubota, K., Kirkpatrick, D. S., Alzayady, K. J., Gygi, S. P., and Wojcikiewicz, R. J. H. (2008) J. Biol. Chem. 283, 35319-35328). Here, we have extended these studies to determine whether IP(3)R2 and IP(3)R3 are similarly modified and if ubiquitination is cell type-dependent. Using mass spectrometry and linkage-specific ubiquitin antibodies, we found that all IP(3)R types are subject to ubiquitination at approximately the same locations and that, independent of cell type, IP(3)Rs are modified by monoubiquitin and Lys-48- and Lys-63-linked ubiquitin chains, although in differing proportions. Remarkably, the attached Lys-48- and Lys-63-linked ubiquitin chains are homogeneous and are segregated to separate IP(3)R subunits, and Lys-48-linked ubiquitin chains, but not Lys-63-linked chains, are required for IP(3)R degradation. Together, these data provide unique insight into the complexities of ubiquitination of an endogenous ubiquitin-proteasome pathway substrate in unperturbed mammalian cells. Importantly, although Lys-48-linked ubiquitin chains appear to trigger proteasomal degradation, the presence of Lys-63-linked ubiquitin chains suggests that ubiquitination of IP(3)Rs may have physiological consequences beyond signaling for degradation.
Nuclear receptors are a large structural class of transcription factors that act with their co-regulators and repressors to maintain a variety of biological and physiological processes such as metabolism, development and reproduction. They are activated through the binding of small ligands, which can be replaced by drug molecules, making nuclear receptors promising drug targets. Transcriptional regulation of the genes that encode them is central to gaining a deeper understanding of the diversity of their biochemical and biophysical roles and their role in disease and therapy. Even though they share evolutionary history, nuclear receptor genes have fundamentally different expression patterns, ranging from ubiquitously expressed to tissue-specific and spatiotemporally complex. However, current understanding of regulation in nuclear receptor gene family is still nascent.
In this study, we investigate the relationship between long-range regulation of nuclear receptor family and their known functionality. Towards this goal, we identify the nuclear receptor genes that are potential targets based on counts of highly conserved non-coding elements. We validate our results using publicly available expression (RNA-seq) and histone modification (ChIP-seq) data from the ENCODE project. We find that nuclear receptor genes involved in developmental roles show strong evidence of long-range mechanism of transcription regulation with distinct cis-regulatory content they feature clusters of highly conserved non-coding elements distributed in regions spanning several Megabases, long and multiple CpG islands, bivalent promoter marks and statistically significant higher enrichment of enhancer mark around their gene loci. On the other hand nuclear receptor genes that are involved in tissue-specific roles lack these features, having simple transcriptional controls and a greater variety of mechanisms for producing paralogs. We further examine the combinatorial patterns of histone maps associated with dynamic functional elements in order to explore the regulatory landscape of the gene family. The results show that our proposed classification capturing long-range regulation is strongly indicative of the functional roles of the nuclear receptors compared to existing classifications.
We present a new classification for nuclear receptor gene family capturing whether a nuclear receptor is a possible target of long-range regulation or not. We compare our classification to existing structural (mechanism of action) and homology-based classifications. Our results show that understanding long-range regulation of nuclear receptors can provide key insight into their functional roles as well as evolutionary history; and this strongly merits further study.
γ-secretase is a large ubiquitously expressed protease complex composed of four core subunits: presenilin, Aph1, PEN-2, and nicastrin. The function of γ-secretase in the cells is to proteolytically cleave various proteins within their transmembrane domains. Presenilin and Aph1 occur as alternative variants belonging to mutually exclusive γ-secretase complexes and providing the complexes with heterogeneous biochemical and physiological properties. γ-secretase is proposed to have a role in the development and progression of cancer and γ-secretase inhibitors are intensively studied for their probable anti-tumor effects in various types of cancer models. Here, we for the first time determined mRNA expression levels of presenilin-1, presenilin-2, Aph1a, Aph1b, PEN-2, and nicastrin in a set of breast cancer tissue samples (N = 55) by quantitative real-time PCR in order to clarify the clinical significance of the expression of different γ-secretase complex components in breast cancer. We found a high positive correlation between the subunit expression levels implying a common regulation of transcription. Our univariate Kaplan-Meier survival analyses established low expression level of γ-secretase complex as a risk factor for breast cancer specific mortality. The tumors expressing low levels of γ-secretase complex were characterized by high histopathological tumor grade, low or no expression of estrogen and progesterone receptors and consequently high probability to fall into the class of triple negative breast cancer tumors. These results may provide novel tools to further categorize breast cancer tumors, especially the highly aggressive and poorly treatable breast cancer type of triple negative cases, and suggest a significant role for γ-secretase in breast cancer. 
It is now well established that the human brain continuously produces new stem cells until well into old age. One of these stem-cell rich areas in the human brain is the sub-ventricular zone (SVZ). The human SVZ is organized in four distinctive layers containing type A, B and C cells. To date, no studies have investigated the distribution of inhibitory neurotransmitters such as γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and their respective receptors on the different cell types in the human SVZ. GABA(A) receptors (GABA(A)R) are ubiquitously expressed, inhibitory heteropentameric chloride ion channels comprised of a variety of subunits that are targeted by many prescribed drugs. In this study we present detailed immunohistochemical data on the regional and cellular localization of α₁, α₂, α3, β₂,₃ and γ₂ subunits of GABA(A)R in the human SVZ. The results from our double and triple labeling studies demonstrate that the cell types and subunit composition throughout the SVZ is heterogeneous; the thickness of the SVZ and GABA(A)R α₂ and γ₂ expression is increased especially in the vicinity of large SVZ blood vessels. GABA(A)R γ₂ is the most specific to the SVZ and present on various cells that express, either glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAPδ) or polysialic acid-neural cell adhesion molecule (PSA-NCAM) separately, or together in a respective ratio of 7:6:2. Proliferating (type C) cells in the SVZ express GAD65/67, GFAPδ and GABA(A)R β₂,₃ receptor subunits. Within the SVZ the majority of cells have an unexpected nuclear GABA(A)R β₂,₃ expression that is inversely proportional to that of PCNA (proliferating cell nuclear antigen marker), which is a very different pattern of expression compared with underlying caudate nucleus cells. Taken together our results provide a detailed description of the chemo-architecture of the adult human SVZ demonstrating the importance of GABA and GABA(A) receptors on the various cell types in the SVZ.
The male-specific region of chromosome-Y (MSY) contributes to phenotypes outside of testis development and has a high rate of evolution between mammalian species. With a lack of genomic crossover, MSY is one of the few genomic areas under similar variation and evolutionary selection in inbred and outbred animal populations, allowing for an assessment of evolutionary mechanisms to translate between the populations.
Using next-generation sequencing, MSY consomic strains, molecular characterization, and large-scale phenotyping, we present here regions of MSY that contribute to inbred strain phenotypes.
We have shown that (1) MSY of rat has nine autosomal gene transposition events with strain-specific selection; (2) sequence variants in MSY occur with a 1.98-fold higher number of variants than other chromosomes in seven sequenced rat strains; (3) Sry, the most studied MSY gene, has undergone extensive gene duplications, driving ubiquitous expression not seen in human or mouse; (4) the expression profile of Sry in the rat is driven by the insertion of the Sry2 copy into an intron of the ubiquitously expressed Kdm5d gene in antisense orientation, but due to several loss of function mutations in the Sry2 protein, nuclear localization and transcriptional control are decreased; (5) expression of Sry copies other than Sry2 in the rat overlaps with the expression profile for human SRY; (6) gene duplications and sequence variants (P76T) of Sry can be selected for phenotypes such as high blood pressure and androgen receptor signaling within inbred mating; and most importantly, (7) per chromosome size, MSY contributes to higher strain-specific phenotypic variation relative to all other chromosomes, with 53 phenotypes showing both a male to female and consomic cross significance.
The data presented supports a high probability of MSY genetic variation altering a broad range of inbred rat phenotypes.
CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) is a ubiquitously expressed multifunctional transcription factor characterized by chromatin binding patterns often described as largely invariant. In this context, how CTCF chromatin recruitment and functionalities are used to promote cell type-specific gene expression remains poorly defined. Here, we show that, in addition to constitutively bound CTCF binding sites (CTS), the CTCF cistrome comprises a large proportion of sites showing highly dynamic binding patterns during the course of adipogenesis. Interestingly, dynamic CTCF chromatin binding is positively linked with changes in expression of genes involved in biological functions defining the different stages of adipogenesis. Importantly, a subset of these dynamic CTS are gained at cell type-specific regulatory regions, in line with a requirement for CTCF in transcriptional induction of adipocyte differentiation. This relates to, at least in part, CTCF requirement for transcriptional activation of both the nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARG) and its target genes. Functionally, we show that CTCF interacts with TET methylcytosine dioxygenase (TET) enzymes and promotes adipogenic transcriptional enhancer DNA hydroxymethylation. Our study reveals a dynamic CTCF chromatin binding landscape required for epigenomic remodeling of enhancers and transcriptional activation driving cell differentiation. 
In biomedical articles, a named entity recognition (NER) technique that identifies entity names from texts is an important element for extracting biological knowledge from articles. After NER is applied to articles, the next step is to normalize the identified names into standard concepts (i.e., disease names are mapped to the National Library of Medicine's Medical Subject Headings disease terms). In biomedical articles, many entity normalization methods rely on domain-specific dictionaries for resolving synonyms and abbreviations. However, the dictionaries are not comprehensive except for some entities such as genes. In recent years, biomedical articles have accumulated rapidly, and neural network-based algorithms that incorporate a large amount of unlabeled data have shown considerable success in several natural language processing problems.
In this study, we propose an approach for normalizing biological entities, such as disease names and plant names, by using word embeddings to represent semantic spaces. For diseases, training data from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) disease corpus and unlabeled data from PubMed abstracts were used to construct word representations. For plants, a training corpus that we manually constructed and unlabeled PubMed abstracts were used to represent word vectors. We showed that the proposed approach performed better than the use of only the training corpus or only the unlabeled data and showed that the normalization accuracy was improved by using our model even when the dictionaries were not comprehensive. We obtained F-scores of 0.808 and 0.690 for normalizing the NCBI disease corpus and manually constructed plant corpus, respectively. We further evaluated our approach using a data set in the disease normalization task of the BioCreative V challenge. When only the disease corpus was used as a dictionary, our approach significantly outperformed the best system of the task.
The proposed approach shows robust performance for normalizing biological entities. The manually constructed plant corpus and the proposed model are available at http://gcancer.org/plant and http://gcancer.org/normalization , respectively.
Text mining has become an important tool for biomedical research. The most fundamental text-mining task is the recognition of biomedical named entities (NER), such as genes, chemicals and diseases. Current NER methods rely on pre-defined features which try to capture the specific surface properties of entity types, properties of the typical local context, background knowledge, and linguistic information. State-of-the-art tools are entity-specific, as dictionaries and empirically optimal feature sets differ between entity types, which makes their development costly. Furthermore, features are often optimized for a specific gold standard corpus, which makes extrapolation of quality measures difficult.
We show that a completely generic method based on deep learning and statistical word embeddings [called long short-term memory network-conditional random field (LSTM-CRF)] outperforms state-of-the-art entity-specific NER tools, and often by a large margin. To this end, we compared the performance of LSTM-CRF on 33 data sets covering five different entity classes with that of best-of-class NER tools and an entity-agnostic CRF implementation. On average, F1-score of LSTM-CRF is 5% above that of the baselines, mostly due to a sharp increase in recall.
The source code for LSTM-CRF is available at https://github.com/glample/tagger and the links to the corpora are available at https://corposaurus.github.io/corpora/ .

Exposure to environmental carcinogens can cause damages to DNA. If not properly repaired, the DNA damages may increase the risk of carcinogenesis. Xeroderma pigmentosum group G (XPG) gene is an essential gene in the nucleotide excision repair (NER) pathway. The association between XPG polymorphisms and cancer susceptibility has been the focus of attention in the molecular epidemiology of cancer. However, the conclusions have been divergent. Therefore, we conducted a comprehensive meta-analysis to precisely evaluate the association of 3 frequently investigated XPG polymorphisms (rs751402, rs873601, and rs2296147) with cancer risk.
Pubmed, EMBASE, and Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) were searched for relevant studies in English and Chinese. Odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were used to assess the association between XPG polymorphisms (rs751402, rs873601, and rs2296147) and cancer risk.
Twenty-three studies were included. Overall, there was no significant association between rs751402 polymorphism and overall cancer risk under the 5 gene models. However, we observed strong correlation between rs751402 polymorphism and gastric cancer (C vs T: OR=1.21, 95% CI = 1.00-1.26, P = .045; TC vs CC: OR = 1.12, 95% CI = 1.00-1.24, P = .041; TC/TT vs CC: OR = 1.13, 95% CI = 1.02-1.26, P = .020). There was a significant correlation between rs873601 polymorphism and cancer risk under the homozygous model (GG vs AA: OR = 1.16, 95% CI = 1.07-1.26, P = .001). Moreover, significant association with breast cancer was detected for rs873601 polymorphism under the allele contrast model (G vs A: OR = 1.10, 95% CI = 1.02-1.20, P = .021). In the subgroup of Asian, rs873601 polymorphism was related to the susceptibility to cancer (G vs A: OR = 1.07, 95% CI = 1.03-1.12, P = .010; GG vs AA: OR = 1.15, 95% CI = 1.06-1.26, P = .001; AG/AA vs GG: OR = 1.08, 95% CI = 1.01-1.15, P = .031; AA vs AG/GG: OR = 1.13, 95% CI = 1.05-1.21, P = .001). Significant association between rs2296147 polymorphism and cancer risk were observed in Asian population (CT vs TT: OR = 0.93, 95% CI = 0.87-0.99, P = .036).
Our meta-analysis suggested that the rs873601 polymorphism was significantly associated with overall cancer risk. The moderate effects of rs751402 and rs2296147 polymorphism on cancer susceptibility might be highly dependent on cancer type and ethnicity, respectively. Large studies are needed to validate our findings, especially in Caucasian and African population.
The DNA is cells is continuously exposed to reactive oxygen species resulting in toxic and mutagenic DNA damage. Although the repair of oxidative DNA damage occurs primarily through the base excision repair (BER) pathway, the nucleotide excision repair (NER) pathway processes some of the same lesions. In addition, damage tolerance mechanisms, such as recombination and translesion synthesis, enable cells to tolerate oxidative DNA damage, especially when BER and NER capacities are exceeded. Thus, disruption of BER alone or disruption of BER and NER in Saccharomyces cerevisiae leads to increased mutations as well as large-scale genomic rearrangements. Previous studies demonstrated that a particular region of chromosome II is susceptible to chronic oxidative stress-induced chromosomal rearrangements, suggesting the existence of DNA damage and/or DNA repair hotspots. Here we investigated the relationship between oxidative damage and genomic instability utilizing chromatin immunoprecipitation combined with DNA microarray technology to profile DNA repair sites along yeast chromosomes under different oxidative stress conditions. We targeted the major yeast AP endonuclease Apn1 as a representative BER protein. Our results indicate that Apn1 target sequences are enriched for cytosine and guanine nucleotides. We predict that BER protects these sites in the genome because guanines and cytosines are thought to be especially susceptible to oxidative attack, thereby preventing large-scale genome destabilization from chronic accumulation of DNA damage. Information from our studies should provide insight into how regional deployment of oxidative DNA damage management systems along chromosomes protects against large-scale rearrangements.

Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a key task in biomedical text mining. Accurate NER systems require task-specific, manually-annotated datasets, which are expensive to develop and thus limited in size. Since such datasets contain related but different information, an interesting question is whether it might be possible to use them together to improve NER performance. To investigate this, we develop supervised, multi-task, convolutional neural network models and apply them to a large number of varied existing biomedical named entity datasets. Additionally, we investigated the effect of dataset size on performance in both single- and multi-task settings.
We present a single-task model for NER, a Multi-output multi-task model and a Dependent multi-task model. We apply the three models to 15 biomedical datasets containing multiple named entities including Anatomy, Chemical, Disease, Gene/Protein and Species. Each dataset represent a task. The results from the single-task model and the multi-task models are then compared for evidence of benefits from Multi-task Learning. With the Multi-output multi-task model we observed an average F-score improvement of 0.8% when compared to the single-task model from an average baseline of 78.4%. Although there was a significant drop in performance on one dataset, performance improves significantly for five datasets by up to 6.3%. For the Dependent multi-task model we observed an average improvement of 0.4% when compared to the single-task model. There were no significant drops in performance on any dataset, and performance improves significantly for six datasets by up to 1.1%. The dataset size experiments found that as dataset size decreased, the multi-output model's performance increased compared to the single-task model's. Using 50, 25 and 10% of the training data resulted in an average drop of approximately 3.4, 8 and 16.7% respectively for the single-task model but approximately 0.2, 3.0 and 9.8% for the multi-task model.
Our results show that, on average, the multi-task models produced better NER results than the single-task models trained on a single NER dataset. We also found that Multi-task Learning is beneficial for small datasets. Across the various settings the improvements are significant, demonstrating the benefit of Multi-task Learning for this task.
BACKGROUND Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) is the second most widespread cancer in humans and its incidence is rising. Novel therapy with better efficacy is needed for clinical treatment of cSCC. Many studies have shown the importance of DNA repair pathways during the development of cancer. A key nucleotide excision repair (NER) protein, xeroderma pigmentosum group D (XPD), is responsible for the excision of a large variety of bulky DNA lesions. MATERIAL AND METHODS To explore the role of XPD in A431 cells, we overexpressed XPD in A431 cells and performed MTT assay, flow cytometry, and Western blot analysis to examine cell proliferation, cell apoptosis, and genes expression. RESULTS We found that the overexpression of XPD suppressed cell viability, induced cell cycle arrest at G1 phase, and promoted cell apoptosis. Additionally, XPD blocked the expression of c-myc, cdc25A, and cdk2, and improved the levels of HIPK2 and p53. CONCLUSIONS These results provide new evidence to reveal the role of XPD in cSCC A431 cells and suggest that XPD may serve as an anti-oncogene during cSCC development.
Xeroderma pigmentosum (XP), trichothiodystrophy (TTD) and Cockayne syndrome (CS) are rare genetic diseases characterized by a large range of clinical symptoms. However, they are all associated with defects in nucleotide excision repair (NER), the system responsible for removing bulky DNA lesions such as those generated by UV light: cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs) and pyrimidine-pyrimidone photoproducts (6-4 PPs). Over the past years, detailed structural and biochemical information on NER-associated proteins has emerged. In the first part of the article we briefly present the main steps of the NER pathway with an emphasis on the precise role of certain proteins. Further, we focus on clinical manifestations of the disorders and describe the diagnostic procedures. Then we consider how current therapy and advanced technology could improve patients' quality of life. Although to date the discussed diseases remain incurable, effective sun protection, a well thought out diet, and holistic medical care provide longer life and better health. This review summarizes the current state of knowledge regarding the epidemiology of NER-associated diseases, their genetic background, clinical features, and treatment options.
The ERCC1 enzyme in the nucleotide excision repair (NER) pathway plays a vital role in DNA repair. Numerous epidemiological studies have evaluated the association between ERCC1 polymorphisms and the risk of colorectal cancer (CRC), with conflicting results. To evaluate the potential associations, we conducted a meta-analysis. Eligible studies were identified by searching electronic databases. The odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were applied to assess the associations between ERCC1 polymorphisms and CRC risk. The meta-analysis results revealed significant associations between ERCC1 rs3212986 and rs2298881 polymorphisms and CRC risk (rs3212986 GG vs CC: OR = 1.66, 95% CI = 1.13-2.44; CG vs CC: OR = 1.12, 95% CI = 0.82-1.55; the dominant model: OR = 1.21, 95% CI = 0.86-1.71; the recessive model: OR = 1.59, 95% CI = 1.09-2.31; rs2298881 CC vs. AA: OR = 2.04, 95% CI = 1.29-3.23; AC vs. AA: OR = 1.19, 95% CI = 0.91-1.56; the dominant model: OR = 1.33, 95% CI = 1.04-1.72; the recessive model: OR = 1.91, 95% CI = 1.22-3.00). However, no association with CRC risk was identified for ERCC1 polymorphisms rs11615 and rs2276466. In conclusion, these findings identified no association between rs11615 and rs2276466 polymorphisms and CRC susceptibility, but the data indicate that ERCC1 rs3212986 and rs2298881 polymorphisms may increase susceptibility to CRC. Large and well-designed studies are needed to further validate our findings.
Squamous cell carcinoma of head and neck (SCCHN) is one of the most common malignancies worldwide, and nucleotide excision repair (NER) is involved in SCCHN susceptibility. In this analysis of 349 newly diagnosed SCCHN patients and 295 cancer-free controls, we investigated whether expression levels of eight core NER proteins were associated with risk of SCCHN. We quantified NER protein expression levels in cultured peripheral lymphocytes using a reverse-phase protein microarray. Compared with the controls, SCCHN patients had statistically significantly lower expression levels of ERCC3 and XPA (P = 0.001 and 0.001, respectively). After dividing the subjects by controls' median values of expression levels, we found a dose-dependent association between an increased risk of SCCHN and low expression levels of ERCC3 (adjusted OR, 1.75, and 95% CI: 1.26-2.42; Ptrend  = 0.008) and XPA (adjusted OR, 1.88; 95% CI, 1.35-2.60; Ptrend  = 0.001). We also identified a significant multiplicative interaction between smoking status and ERCC3 expression levels (P = 0.014). Finally, after integrating demographic and clinical variables, we found that the addition of ERCC3 and XPA expression levels to the model significantly improved the sensitivity of the expanded model on SCCHN risk. In conclusion, reduced protein expression levels of ERCC3 and XPA were associated with an increased risk of SCCHN. However, these results need to be confirmed in additional large studies.
The two endonucleases XPF and XPG are essentially involved in nucleotide excision repair (NER) and interstrand crosslink (ICL) repair. Defects in these two proteins result in severe diseases like xeroderma pigmentosum (XP). We applied our newly CRISPR/Cas9 generated human XPF knockout cell line with complete loss of XPF and primary fibroblasts from an XP-G patient (XP20BE) to analyze until now uncharacterized spontaneous mRNA splice variants of these two endonucleases. Functional analyses of these variants were performed using luciferase-based reporter gene assays. Two XPF and XPG splice variants with residual repair capabilities in NER, as well as ICL repair could be identified. Almost all variants are severely C-terminally truncated and lack important protein-protein interaction domains. Interestingly, XPF-202, differing to XPF-003 in the first 12 amino acids only, had no repair capability at all, suggesting an important role of this region during DNA repair, potentially concerning protein-protein interaction. We also identified splice variants of XPF and XPG exerting inhibitory effects on NER. Moreover, we showed that the XPF and XPG splice variants presented with different inter-individual expression patterns in healthy donors, as well as in various tissues. With regard to their residual repair capability and dominant-negative effects, functionally relevant spontaneous XPF and XPG splice variants present promising prognostic marker candidates for individual cancer risk, disease outcome, or therapeutic success. This merits further investigations, large association studies, and translational research within clinical trials in the future.
Nucleotide excision repair (NER)-deficient rodent and human cells (such as those derived from patients with xeroderma pigmentosum, XP) are hypersensitive to UV light. Some of these cell lines, specifically certain rodent mutants with severe defects in the ERCC1 and XPF genes, are dramatically sensitive to crosslinking agents such as phosphoramide mustard (PM). These crosslink-sensitive rodent mutants also exhibit sensitization to gamma-rays under hypoxic (but not under aerated) conditions. Like their rodent counterparts, human XP cells are highly sensitive to UV light; however, none of the human XP lines, even XPF, displays extreme hypersensitivity to crosslinking agents. Studying XP cells, therefore, allows us to further assess the extent to which the phenotypic characteristic of hypoxia-specific radiosensitization of mammalian cells tracks with defects in crosslink repair (as opposed to NER). The sensitivity to PM and gamma-rays of normal human fibroblasts and human XP fibroblasts from two complementation groups, XPA and XPF, was assessed using a clonogenic survival assay. Compared with normal cells, XPA cells were not appreciably hypersensitive to PM or to gamma-rays under either aerated or hypoxic conditions. XPF cells were modestly (approximately 1.75-fold) sensitive to PM but showed no significant radiosensitization under either aerated or hypoxic conditions. Thus, although the phenotype of human XPF cells is quite different from that of "severe" rodent XPF mutants such as UV41, the characteristic of hypoxia-specific radiosensitization consistently tracks with extreme hypersensitivity to crosslinking agents and is separable from UV sensitivity (and thus from defects in NER).
Nucleotide excision repair (NER) is a universal DNA repair mechanism found in all three kingdoms of life. Its ability to repair a broad range of DNA lesions sets NER apart from other repair mechanisms. NER systems recognize the damaged DNA strand and cleave it 3', then 5' to the lesion. After the oligonucleotide containing the lesion is removed, repair synthesis fills the resulting gap. UvrB is the central component of bacterial NER. It is directly involved in distinguishing damaged from undamaged DNA and guides the DNA from recognition to repair synthesis. Recently solved structures of UvrB from different organisms represent the first high-resolution view into bacterial NER. The structures provide detailed insight into the domain architecture of UvrB and, through comparison, suggest possible domain movements. The structure of UvrB consists of five domains. Domains 1a and 3 bind ATP at the inter-domain interface and share high structural similarity to helicases of superfamilies I and II. Not related to helicase structures, domains 2 and 4 are involved in interactions with either UvrA or UvrC, whereas domain 1b was implicated for DNA binding. The structures indicate that ATP binding and hydrolysis is associated with domain motions. UvrB's ATPase activity, however, is not coupled to the separation of long DNA duplexes as in helicases, but rather leads to the formation of the preincision complex with the damaged DNA substrate. The location of conserved residues and structural comparisons with helicase-DNA structures suggest how UvrB might bind to DNA. A model of the UvrB-DNA interaction in which a beta-hairpin of UvrB inserts between the DNA double strand has been proposed recently. This padlock model is developed further to suggest two distinct consequences of domain motion: in the UvrA(2)B-DNA complex, domain motions lead to translocation along the DNA, whereas in the tight UvrB-DNA pre-incision complex, they lead to distortion of the 3' incision site.
Yeast uses nucleotide excision repair (NER) and photolyase (photoreactivation) to repair cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs) generated by ultraviolet light. In active genes, NER preferentially repairs the transcribed strand (TS). In contrast, we recently showed that photolyase preferentially repairs the non-transcribed strands (NTS) of the URA3 and HIS3 genes in minichromosomes. To test whether photoreactivation depends on transcription, repair of CPDs was investigated in the transcriptionally regulated GAL10 gene in a yeast strain deficient in NER [AMY3 (rad1Delta)]. In the active gene (cells grown in galactose), photoreactivation was fast in the NTS and slow in the TS demonstrating preferential repair of the NTS. In the inactive gene (cells grown in glucose), both strands were repaired at similar rates. This suggests that RNA polymerases II blocked at CPDs inhibit accessibility of CPDs to photolyase. In a strain in which both pathways are operational [W303-1a (RAD1)], no strand bias was observed either in the active or inactive gene, demonstrating that photoreactivation of the NTS compensates preferential repair of the TS by NER. Moreover, repair of the NTS was more quickly in the active gene than in the repressed gene indicating that transcription dependent disruption of chromatin facilitates repair of an active gene.
The CIRRIS-lA spectroradiometer system is designed to obtain spectral and spatial airglow data on the shuttle platform over a global extent. The sensor system includes a Michelson interferometer which exhibits a noise equivalent sterance [radiance] (NER) of 2 x 10(-13) W cm(-2) sr(-1) Hz(-1/2); and at a resolution of 0.964 cm(-1) (scan time 9.1 s) exhibits a noise equivalent spectral sterance [radiance] NESR of 7 x 10(-14) W cm(-2)sr(-1)/cm(-1). The entire optical subsystem, silicon-arsenic focal-plane, off-axis high-rejection telescope, and removable cover are cooled below 20 K. The measured performance is shown to agree with theory to within a few percent. Noise-equivalent-sterance [radiance] per root-Hz is recommended as a figure of merit for interferometers that is independent of the specific operating conditions; i.e., mirror velocity, scan time or transform size.
The anticancer activity of cisplatin derives from its ability to crosslink DNA. Cisplatin-resistance is partially caused by enhanced nucleotide excision repair (NER). Major 1,2-intrastrand crosslinks can create a hydrophobic notch at the damage site, which can be specifically bound by damage-recognition proteins, thus shielded from NER-activity. We aimed at preventing resistance by enhancing this mechanism using more hydrophobic platinum compounds.
We synthesized three platinum analogs with increased hydrophobic characteristics. Performing MTT-assays, the efficacy of cisplatin and the novel agents was compared in a fibroblast and eight brain tumour cell lines.
Among the novel compounds, the most hydrophobic molecule, methylpyridineplatinum, was most cytotoxic (LC50 = 5.84 x 10(-5) M), followed by methylpyrazineplatinum, the second most hydrophobic (LC50 = 1.79 x 10(-4) M), and pyridineplatinum (LC50 = 2.76 x 10(-4) M). Overall, cisplatin revealed highest cytotoxicity (LC50 = 8.77 x 10(-6) M).
Comparison of the novel compounds supports the hypothesis that increased hydrophobicity contributes to higher antitumour-activity. Other advantageous characteristics of cisplatin might relate to its remaining highest efficacy.
During nucleotide excision repair (NER) in bacteria the UvrC nuclease and the short oligonucleotide that contains the DNA lesion are removed from the post-incision complex by UvrD, a superfamily 1A helicase. Helicases are frequently regulated by interactions with partner proteins, and immunoprecipitation experiments have previously indicated that UvrD interacts with UvrB, a component of the post-incision complex. We examined this interaction using 2-hybrid analysis and surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy, and found that the N-terminal domain and the unstructured region at the C-terminus of UvrD interact with UvrB. We analysed the properties of a truncated UvrD protein that lacked the unstructured C-terminal region and found that it showed a diminished affinity for single-stranded DNA, but retained the ability to displace both UvrC and the lesion-containing oligonucleotide from a post-incision nucleotide excision repair complex. The interaction of the C-terminal region of UvrD with UvrB is therefore not an essential feature of the mechanism by which UvrD disassembles the post-incision complex during NER. In further experiments we showed that PcrA helicase from Bacillus stearothermophilus can also displace UvrC and the excised oligonucleotide from a post-incision NER complex, which supports the idea that PcrA performs a UvrD-like function during NER in gram-positive organisms.
Both of benzo(a)pyrene (BaP) and 3,3',4,4',5-pentachlorobiphenyl (PCB126) are ubiquitous and persistent environmental pollutants. These two chemicals coexist in various environmental media and human samples and thus may have combined effects on human health. However, the toxic effects and related mechanism of co-exposure to BaP and PCB126 remain unknown. In a series of experiments using the HepG2 cells exposed to BaP (50microM) or/and PCB126 (0.01, 0.1, 1 and 10nM), we measured the rate of micronucleus (MN) formation, CYP1A1 activity and expression of nucleotide excision repair (NER) proteins (XPA and XPC). We found that the exposure to BaP or PCB126 alone could effectively increase the CYP1A1 activity and the XPA expression. BaP alone had a profound enhancement of MN formation. Compared with BaP alone, co-exposure to both BaP and PCB126 significantly enhanced the CYP1A1 activity and the formation of MN but reduced the expression of both XPA and XPC. The synergistic effect of PCB126 on BaP-induced MN formation was inhibited by alpha-naphthoflavone (ANF), an inhibitor of CYP1A1. Our findings suggest that PCB126 may enhance BaP-induced DNA damage and genotoxicity by increasing cytochrome P450 1A activity and decreasing the NER capacity.
Named entity recognition (NER) is an important first step for text mining the biomedical literature. Evaluating the performance of biomedical NER systems is impossible without a standardized test corpus. The annotation of such a corpus for gene/protein name NER is a difficult process due to the complexity of gene/protein names. We describe the construction and annotation of GENETAG, a corpus of 20K MEDLINE sentences for gene/protein NER. 15K GENETAG sentences were used for the BioCreAtIvE Task 1A Competition.
To ensure heterogeneity of the corpus, MEDLINE sentences were first scored for term similarity to documents with known gene names, and 10K high- and 10K low-scoring sentences were chosen at random. The original 20K sentences were run through a gene/protein name tagger, and the results were modified manually to reflect a wide definition of gene/protein names subject to a specificity constraint, a rule that required the tagged entities to refer to specific entities. Each sentence in GENETAG was annotated with acceptable alternatives to the gene/protein names it contained, allowing for partial matching with semantic constraints. Semantic constraints are rules requiring the tagged entity to contain its true meaning in the sentence context. Application of these constraints results in a more meaningful measure of the performance of an NER system than unrestricted partial matching.
The annotation of GENETAG required intricate manual judgments by annotators which hindered tagging consistency. The data were pre-segmented into words, to provide indices supporting comparison of system responses to the "gold standard". However, character-based indices would have been more robust than word-based indices. GENETAG Train, Test and Round1 data and ancillary programs are freely available at ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/tanabe/GENETAG.tar.gz. A newer version of GENETAG-05, will be released later this year.
Plants must protect themselves from a spectrum of abiotic stresses. For example, the sun is a source of heat, intense light, and DNA-damaging ultraviolet (UV) rays. Damaged DNA binding protein 1A (DDB1A), DDB2, and UV hypersensitive 6 (UVH6)/XPD are all involved in the repair of UV-damaged DNA - DDB1A and DDB2 in the initial damage recognition stage, while the UVH6/XPD helicase unwinds the damaged strand. We find that, as predicted, Arabidopsis ddb1a and ddb2 mutants do not affect uvh6/xpd UV tolerance. In addition, uvh6 is heat sensitive, and ddb1a and ddb2 weakly enhance this trait. The uvh6 ddb1a and uvh6 ddb2 double mutants also exhibit sensitivity to oxidative stress, suggesting a role for DDB1 complexes in heat and oxidative stress tolerance. Finally, we describe a new uvh6 phenotype, the low penetrance production of flowers with five petals and five sepals. ddb1a and ddb2 suppress this phenotype in uvh6 mutants. Interestingly, heat treatment also induces five-petalled flowers in the ddb1a and ddb2 single mutants. Thus UVH6, DDB1A, and DDB2 all contribute to UV tolerance, heat tolerance and floral patterning. 
Ovarian carcinoma is the most lethal gynaecologic malignancy. Despite wide initial sensibility to chemotherapy especially to platinum-based regimens, the vast majority of patients with advanced stages of the disease develop recurrences and subsequent resistance to treatments. Ovarian cancer is actually considered as a heterogeneous disease at the clinical, histological and molecular level. In this review, the mechanisms of intrinsic sensitivity or resistance to treatment, especially to platinum-based chemotherapy are considered with particular reference to the significance of tumour heterogeneity. The molecular features involved in acquired resistance are reviewed and the current hypotheses are discussed. In particular, potential disruptions of the DNA reparation pathways are highlighted. 
Based on the significance of oxidized low-density lipoprotein (LDL) in health and disease, this review focuses on human studies addressing oxidation of LDL, including three lines of biomarkers, (i) ex vivo LDL resistance to oxidation, a "challenge test" model, (ii) circulating oxidized LDL, indicating the "current in vivo status", and (iii) autoantibodies against oxidized LDL as fingerprints of an immune response to oxidized LDL, along with circulating oxysterols and 4-hydroxynonenal as biomarkers of lipid peroxidation. Lipid peroxidation and oxidized LDL are hallmarks in the development of various metabolic, cardiovascular and other diseases. Changes further occur across life stages from infancy to older age as well as in athletes and smokers. Given their responsiveness to targeted nutritional interventions, markers of LDL oxidation have been employed in a rapidly growing number of human studies for more than 2 decades. There is growing interest in foods, which, besides providing energy and nutrients, exert beneficial effects on human health, such as protection of DNA, proteins and lipids from oxidative damage. Any health claim, however, needs to be substantiated by supportive evidence derived from human studies, using reliable biomarkers to demonstrate such beneficial effects. A large body of evidence has accumulated, demonstrating protection of LDL from oxidation by bioactive food compounds, including vitamins, other micronutrients and secondary plant ingredients, which will facilitate the selection of oxidation biomarkers for future human intervention studies and health claim support.
Lipoprotein (a) (Lp(a)) is a modified low-density lipoprotein (LDL) particle with an additional specific apolipoprotein (a), covalently attached to apolipoprotein B‑100 of LDL by a single thioester bond. Increased plasma Lp(a) level is a genetically determined, independent, causal risk factor for cardiovascular disease.The precise quantification of Lp(a) in plasma is still hampered by mass-sensitive assays, large particle variation, poor standardization and lack of assay comparability.The physiological functions of Lp(a) include wound healing, promoting tissue repair and vascular remodeling. Similarly to other lipoproteins, Lp(a) is also susceptible for oxidative modifications, leading to extensive formation of pro-inflammatory and pro-atherogenic oxidized phospholipids, oxysterols, oxidized lipid-protein adducts in Lp(a) particles, that perpetuate atherosclerotic lesion progression and intima-media thickening through induction of M1-macrophages, inflammation, autoimmunity and apoptosis. The oxidation-specific epitopes of modified lipoproteins are major targets of pre-immune, natural IgM antibodies, that may attenuate the pro-inflammatory and pro-atherogenic effects of Lp(a).Although the data are still insufficient, recent studies suggest a potential anti-neoplastic role of Lp(a).
Individual variability in the endogenous CYP3A metabolite 4β-hydroxycholesterol (4βOHC) is substantial, but to which extent this is determined by genetic and nongenetic factors remains unclear. The aim of the study was to evaluate the explanatory power of candidate genetic variants and key nongenetic factors on individual variability in 4βOHC levels in a large naturalistic patient population.
We measured 4βOHC concentration in serum samples from 655 patients and used multiple linear regression analysis to estimate the quantitative effects of CYP3A4*22, CYP3A5*3, and POR*28 variant alleles, comedication with CYP3A inducers, inhibitors and substrates, sex, and age on individual 4βOHC levels.
4βOHC concentration ranged &gt;100-fold in the population, and the multiple linear regression model explained about one fourth of the variability (R 2 = 0.23). Only comedication with inducers or inhibitors, sex, and POR genotype were significantly associated with individual variability in 4βOHC level. The estimated quantitative effects on 4βOHC levels were greatest for inducer comedication (+&gt;313%, P &lt; 0.001), inhibitor comedication (-34%, P = 0.021), and female sex (+30%, P &lt; 0.001), while only a modestly elevated 4βOHC level was observed in carriers vs. noncarriers of POR*28 (+11%, P = 0.023).
These findings suggest that the CYP3A4*22, CYP3A5*3, and POR*28 variant alleles are of limited importance for overall individual variability in 4βOHC levels compared to nongenetic factors.
Hypercholesterolemia has been implicated in numerous health problems from cardiovascular disease to neurodegeneration. High serum cholesterol levels in midlife have been associated with an increased risk of developing Alzheimer's disease (AD) later in life which suggests that the pathways leading to AD pathology might be activated decades before the symptoms of the disease are detected. Cholesterol-fed animals, particularly cholesterol-fed rabbits, exhibit brain pathology similar to the changes found in brains of AD patients. Dietary cholesterol, which cannot pass the blood-brain barrier, is thought to influence central nervous system homeostasis by increased transport of its circulatory breakdown product, 27-hydroxycholesterol (27-OHC), into the brain. 27-OHC is an endogenous selective estrogen receptor modulator. Estrogen-mediated non-reproductive functions require estrogen receptors (ERs) and include modulation of mitochondrial function and structure, as well as regulation of synaptogenesis in the brain. ERs are located in brain areas affected early in AD pathogenesis, including the hippocampus. Here we report that increase in serum cholesterol, induced by feeding rabbits a high-cholesterol diet, is associated with higher levels of 27-OHC in the brain as well as increased levels of neurodegeneration in the hippocampus. Furthermore, these results are accompanied by changes in expression of ERs in the hippocampus as well as a decrease in hippocampal mitochondria. These findings provide an important insight into one of the possible mechanisms involved in the development of AD, and shed light on the processes that may antedate amyloid-β and tau phosphorylation changes currently hypothesized to cause AD symptomology and pathology.
Lipid peroxidation, the oxidative degradation of membrane lipids by reactive oxygen species generates a large variety of breakdown products such as alkanes, aldehydes, ketones, alcohols, furans and others. Due to their reactivity aldehydes (alkanals, 2-alkenals, 2,4-alkadienals, 4-hydroxyalkenals) received a lot of attention, in particular because they can diffuse from the site of formation and interact with proteins and nucleic acids thus acting as second toxic messengers. The major aldehydic peroxidation product of membrane lipids is 4-hydroxynonenal (HNE). Since HNE and other 4-hydroxyalkenals are strong alkylating agents they have therefore been considered to be the biologically most important peroxidation products. Although initially research focused on the toxicological potential of these compounds it is now well known that they play also a crucial role in cell signaling under physiological and pathophysiological conditions. Thus, it is obvious that the biological effects will be determined by the intracellular concentrations which can trigger adaptation, DNA damage and cell death. This review will not cover all these aspects but will concentrate on the genotoxic properties of selected lipid oxidation products important in the context of pathophysiological developments together with a chapter on epigenetic modifications.
Does 27-hydroxycholesterol (27OH) actively facilitate the progression of luteolysis?
There is increased mRNA expression of the enzyme that produces 27OH during luteolysis in vivo in rhesus macaques and sheep, and 27OH reduces progesterone secretion from human luteinized granulosa cells.
There is an increase in mRNA expression of liver x receptor (LXR) and a decrease in sterol regulatory element binding protein 2 (SREBP2) target genes during spontaneous luteolysis in primates, which could result in reduced cholesterol availability for steroidogenesis. Concentrations of 27OH are also increased in primate corpora lutea (CL) during luteolysis, and 27OH is a dual LXR agonist and SREBP2 inhibitor.
This was an in vitro study using primary human luteinized granulosa cells in a control versus treatment(s) design. Analyses of CL from sheep undergoing induced or spontaneous luteolysis were also performed, along with database mining of microarray data from rhesus macaque CL.
Primary luteinizing granulosa cells were obtained from 37 women aged 24-44 who were undergoing oocyte donation or IVF for male factor or idiopathic infertility, and cells were further luteinized in vitro using human chorionic gonadotropin. Three approaches to test the effect of 27OH produced via CYP27A1 (cytochrome p450, family 27, subfamily A, polypeptide 1) on luteinized granulosa cells were used: (i) direct 27OH supplementation, (ii) induction of endogenous CYP27A1 activity via pharmacologic inhibition of steroidogenesis, and (iii) siRNA-mediated knockdown to directly inhibit CYP27A1 as well as cholesterol transport into the mitochondria via the steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (STAR). Endpoints included: progesterone (P4) secretion into culture media determined by enzyme immunoassay, cholesterol efflux and uptake assays using fluorescent lipid analogs, and mRNA expression determined via semi-quantitative real-time PCR (QPCR). An additional experiment involved QPCR analysis of 40 CL collected from ewes undergoing induced or spontaneous luteolysis, as well as database mining of microarray data generated from 16 rhesus macaque CL collected during spontaneous luteolysis and 13 macaque CL collected during a luteinizing hormone ablation and replacement protocol.
The mRNA expression of CYP27A1 was significantly increased during luteolysis in rhesus macaques and sheep in vivo, and CYP27A1 transcription was suppressed by luteinizing hormone and hCG. There was a significant decrease in hCG-stimulated P4 secretion from human luteinized granulosa cells caused by 27OH treatment, and a significant increase in basal and hCG-stimulated P4 synthesis when endogenous 27OH production was inhibited via CYP27A1 knockdown, indicating that 27OH inhibits steroidogenesis. Pharmacologic inhibition of steroidogenesis by aminoglutethimide significantly induced LXR and inhibited SREBP2 target gene mRNA expression, indicating that increased oxysterol production occurs when steroidogenesis is suppressed. Inhibiting cholesterol delivery into the mitochondria via knockdown of STAR resulted in reduced SREBP2 target gene mRNA expression, indicating that STAR function is necessary to maintain SREBP2-mediated transcription. The effects of 27OH treatment on markers of LXR and SREBP2 activity were moderate, and knockdown of CYP27A1 did not prevent aminoglutethimide-induced changes in LXR and SREBP2 target gene mRNA expression. These observations indicate that 27OH inhibits P4 secretion partially via mechanisms separate from its role as an LXR agonist and SREBP2 inhibitor, and also demonstrate that other oxysterols are involved in modulating LXR and SREBP2-mediated transcription when steroidogenesis is suppressed.
None.
Luteinized granulosa cells may differ from luteal cells, and the effect on luteal function in vivo was not directly tested. The mechanisms that cause the initial rise in CYP27A1 mRNA expression during luteolysis are also not clear.
The factors causing luteolysis in primates have not yet been determined. This study provides functional evidence of a novel mechanism via increased 27OH synthesis during luteolysis, which subsequently represses progesterone secretion. Increased 27OH may also facilitate the progression of luteolysis in domestic animal species.

ATP-binding cassette G1 (ABCG1) is a member of the large family of ABC transporters which are involved in the active transport of many amphiphilic and lipophilic molecules including lipids, drugs or endogenous metabolites. It is now well established that ABCG1 promotes the export of lipids, including cholesterol, phospholipids, sphingomyelin and oxysterols, and plays a key role in the maintenance of tissue lipid homeostasis. Although ABCG1 was initially proposed to mediate cholesterol efflux from macrophages and then to protect against atherosclerosis and cardiovascular diseases (CVD), it becomes now clear that ABCG1 exerts a larger spectrum of actions which are of major importance in cardiometabolic diseases (CMD). Beyond a role in cellular lipid homeostasis, ABCG1 equally participates to glucose and lipid metabolism by controlling the secretion and activity of insulin and lipoprotein lipase. Moreover, there is now a growing body of evidence suggesting that modulation of ABCG1 expression might contribute to the development of diabetes and obesity, which are major risk factors of CVD. In order to provide the current understanding of the action of ABCG1 in CMD, we here reviewed major findings obtained from studies in mice together with data from the genetic and epigenetic analysis of ABCG1 in the context of CMD.
Management of degenerative spine pathologies frequently leads to the need for spinal fusion (SF), where bone growth is induced toward stabilization of the interventioned spine. Autologous bone graft (ABG) remains the gold-standard inducer, whereas new bone graft substitutes attempt to achieve effective de novo bone formation and solid fusion. Limited fusion outcomes have driven motivation for more sophisticated and multidisciplinary solutions, involving new biomaterials and/or biologics, through innovative delivery platforms. The present review will analyze the most recent body of literature that is focused on new approaches for consistent bone fusion of spinal vertebrae, including the development of new biomaterials that pursue physical and chemical aptitudes; the delivery of growth factors (GF) to accelerate new bone formation; and the use of cells to improve functional bone development. Bone graft substitutes currently in clinical practice, such as demineralized bone matrix and ceramics, are still used as a starting point for the study of new bioactive agents. Polyesters such as polycaprolactone and polylactic acid arise as platforms for the development of composites, where a mineral element and cell/GF constitute the delivery system. Exciting fusion outcomes were obtained in several small and large animal models with these. On what regards bioactive agents, mesenchymal stem cells, preferentially derived from the bone marrow or adipose tissue, were studied in this context. Autologous and allogeneic approaches, as well as osteogenically differentiated cells, have been tested. These cell sources have further been genetically engineered for specific GF expression. Nevertheless, results on fusion efficacy with cells have been inconsistent. On the other hand, the delivery of GF (most commonly bone morphogenetic protein-2 [BMP-2]) has provided favorable outcomes. Complications related to burst release and dosing are still the target of research through the development of controlled release systems or alternative GF such as Nel-like molecule-1 (NELL-1), Oxysterols, or COMP-Ang1. Promising solutions with new biomaterial and GF compositions are becoming closer to the human patient, as these evidence high-fusion performance, while offering cost and safety advantages. The use of cells has not yet proved solid benefits, whereas a further understanding of cell behavior remains a challenge.
Tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) is a highly sensitive and specific technique. Thanks to the development of triple quadrupole analyzers, it is becoming more widely used in laboratories working in the field of inborn errors of metabolism. We review here the state of the art of this technique applied to the diagnosis of lysosomal storage disorders (LSDs) and how MS/MS has changed the diagnostic rationale in recent years. This fine technology brings more sensitive, specific, and reliable methods than the previous biochemical ones for the analysis of urinary glycosaminoglycans, oligosaccharides, and sialic acid. In sphingolipidoses, the quantification of urinary sphingolipids (globotriaosylceramide, sulfatides) is possible. The measurement of new plasmatic biomarkers such as oxysterols, bile acids, and lysosphingolipids allows the screening of many sphingolipidoses and related disorders (Niemann-Pick type C), replacing tedious biochemical techniques. Applied to amniotic fluid, a more reliable prenatal diagnosis or screening of LSDs is now available for fetuses presenting with antenatal manifestations. Applied to enzyme measurements, it allows high throughput assays for the screening of large populations, even newborn screening. The advent of this new method can modify the diagnostic rationale behind LSDs.
Oxysterols are cholesterol derivatives that have been suggested to play a role in inflammatory diseases such as obesity, atherosclerosis, or neuroinflammatory diseases. However, the effect of neuroinflammation on oxysterol levels has only been partially studied so far.
We used an HPLC-MS method to quantify over ten oxysterols both in in vitro and in vivo models of neuroinflammation. In the same models, we used RT-qPCR to analyze the expression of the enzymes responsible for oxysterol metabolism. Using the BV2 microglial cell line, we explored the effect of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced (M1-type) and IL-4-induced (M2-type) cell activation on oxysterol levels. We also used LPS-activated co-cultures of mouse primary microglia and astrocytes. In vivo, we induced a neuroinflammation by administering LPS to mice. Finally, we used a mouse model of multiple sclerosis, namely the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) model, that is characterized by demyelination and neuroinflammation.
In vitro, we found that LPS activation induces profound alterations in oxysterol levels. Interestingly, we could discriminate between control and LPS-activated cells based on the changes in oxysterol levels both in BV2 cells and in the primary co-culture of glial cells. In vivo, the changes in oxysterol levels were less marked than in vitro. However, we found in both models increased levels of the GPR183 agonist 7α,25-dihydroxycholesterol. Furthermore, we studied in vitro the effect of 14 oxysterols on the mRNA expression of inflammatory markers in LPS-activated co-culture of microglia and astrocytes. We found that several oxysterols decreased the LPS-induced expression of pro-inflammatory markers.
These data demonstrate that inflammation profoundly affects oxysterol levels and that oxysterols can modulate glial cell activation. This further supports the interest of a large screening of oxysterol levels when studying the interplay between neuroinflammation and bioactive lipids.
Bioactivity-guided chemical investigation of a co-culture of marine-derived micro-organisms has yielded one new steroid, 7β-hydroxycholesterol-1β-carboxylic acid (1) with an unprecedented carboxylic acid group at C-1, together with three known steroidal metabolites (2-4). The chemical structures and stereochemistry of the isolated compounds were unambiguously determined based on extensive 1D, 2D NMR and HR-ESI-MS measurements. The isolated compounds were assessed for their cytotoxic activity against four different human tumour cell lines K562 (leukaemia), HCT116 (colon), A2780 (ovary) and its cisplatin-resistant mutant (A2780 CisR), and they revealed moderate activities with IC50 values ranging from 10.0 to 100.0 μM.
Ongoing efforts to unravel the origins of the cholesterol 5,6-secosterols (1a and 1b) in biological systems have revealed that the two known chemical routes to these oxysterols, ozonolysis of cholesterol (3) and Hock-cleavage of 5-alpha-hydroperoxycholesterol (4a), are distinguishable based upon the ratio of the hydrazone derivatives (2a and 2b) formed in each case and this ratio offers an insight into the chemical origin of the secosterols in vivo.
Sterol-regulatory element binding proteins (SREBPs) control the expression of genes involved in fatty acid and cholesterol biosynthesis. Using microarrays, we observed that mature SREBP-1 also induced the expression of genes unrelated to lipid metabolism, such as heme oxygenase 1 (HMOX1), plasma glutathione peroxidase, the phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase regulatory subunit p55 gamma, synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2A, and COTE1. The expression of these genes was repressed upon addition of sterols, which block endogenous SREBP cleavage, and was induced by the statin drug mevinolin. Stimulation of fibroblasts with platelet-derived growth factor, which activates SREBP-1, had a similar effect. Fasted mice that were refed with a high-carbohydrate diet presented an increased expression of HMOX1 and p55 gamma in the liver. Overall, the transcriptional signature of SREBP-1 in fibroblasts stimulated by growth factors was very similar to that described in liver cells. We analyzed the HMOX1 promoter and found one SREBP binding site of the E-box type, which was required for regulation by SREBP-1a and SREBP-1c but was insensitive to SREBP-2. In conclusion, our data suggest that SREBP-1 regulates the expression of stress response and signaling genes, which could contribute to the metabolic response to insulin and growth factors in various tissues.
Theca-interstitial (T-I) cells of the ovary synthesize androgens in response to luteinizing hormone (LH). In pathological conditions such as polycystic ovarian syndrome, T-I cells are hyperactive in androgen production in response to LH and insulin. Because cholesterol is an essential substrate for androgen production, we examined the effect of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) and insulin on signaling pathways that are known to increase cholesterol accumulation in steroidogenic cells. Specifically, the effect of hCG and insulin on sterol regulatory element-binding transcription factor 1a (SREBF1a) required for cholesterol biosynthesis and uptake was examined. Primary cultures of T-I cells isolated from 25-day-old rat ovaries responded to hCG and insulin to increase the active/processed form of SREBF1a. The hCG and insulin significantly reduced insulin-induced gene 1 (INSIG1) protein, a negative regulator of SREBF processing. Furthermore, an increase in the expression of selected SREBF target genes, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (Hmgcr) and mevalonate kinase (Mvk), was also observed. Protein kinase A (PRKA) inhibitor completely abolished the hCG-induced increase in SREBF1a, while increasing INSIG1. Although the hCG-induced depletion of total and free cholesterol was abolished by aminoglutethimide, the stimulatory effect on SREBF1a was not totally suppressed. Treatment with 25-hydroxycholesterol abrogated the effect of hCG on SREBF1a. Inhibition of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathway did not block the insulin-induced increase in SREBF1a, whereas mitogen-activated protein kinase inhibition reduced the insulin response. These results suggest that the increased androgen biosynthesis by T-I cells in response to hCG and insulin is regulated, at least in part, by increasing the expression of sterol response element-responsive genes by increasing SREBF1a.
Cells in the tumor microenvironment may be reprogrammed by tumor-derived metabolites. Cholesterol-oxidized products, namely oxysterols, have been shown to favor tumor growth directly by promoting tumor cell growth and indirectly by dampening antitumor immune responses. However, the cellular and molecular mechanisms governing oxysterol generation within tumor microenvironments remain elusive. We recently showed that tumor-derived oxysterols recruit neutrophils endowed with protumoral activities, such as neoangiogenesis. Here, we show that hypoxia inducible factor-1a (HIF-1α) controls the overexpression of the enzyme Cyp46a1, which generates the oxysterol 24-hydroxycholesterol (24S-HC) in a pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor (pNET) model commonly used to study neoangiogenesis. The activation of the HIF-1α-24S-HC axis ultimately leads to the induction of the angiogenic switch through the positioning of proangiogenic neutrophils in proximity to Cyp46a1+ islets. Pharmacologic blockade or genetic inactivation of oxysterols controls pNET tumorigenesis by dampening the 24S-HC-neutrophil axis. Finally, we show that in some human pNET samples Cyp46a1 transcripts are overexpressed, which correlate with the HIF-1α target VEGF and with tumor diameter. This study reveals a layer in the angiogenic switch of pNETs and identifies a therapeutic target for pNET patients.
7-Oxysterols are major toxic components in oxidized low-density lipoprotein and human atheroma lesions, which cause lysosomal membrane permeabilization (LMP) and cell death. Autophagy may function as a survival mechanism in this process. Here, we investigated whether 7-oxysterols mixed in an atheroma-relevant proportion induce autophagy, whether autophagy induction influences 7-oxysterol-mediated cell death, and the underlying mechanisms, by focusing on cellular lipid levels, oxidative stress, and LMP in 7-oxysterol-treated macrophages. We found that 7-oxysterols induced cellular lipid accumulation, autophagy dysfunction, and cell death in the form of both apoptosis and necrosis. Exposure to 7-oxysterols induced autophagic vacuole synthesis in the form of increased autophagy marker microtubule-associated protein 1A/1B-light chain 3 (LC3) and LC3-phosphatidylethanolamine conjugate (LC3-II) and autophagic vacuole formation. This led to an accumulation of p62, indicating a reduction in autophagic vacuole degradation. Importantly, autophagy induction significantly reduced 7-oxysterol-mediated cell death by diminishing LMP and oxidative stress. Moreover, autophagy induction minimized cellular lipid accumulation induced by 7-oxysterols. These findings highlight the importance of autophagy in combating cellular stress, LMP, and cell death in atherosclerosis. Therefore, activation of the autophagy pathway may be a potential therapeutic strategy for prevention of necrotic core formation in atherosclerotic lesions. 
The direct relationship between obesity and breast cancer has been elucidated recently with the identification of a cholesterol derivative 27-hydroxycholesterol (27HC), an endogenous SERM that can act through estrogen receptor (ER)-mediated mechanisms. Our recent research shed light on the possible SERM-like property of methanol extract of pericarp of pomegranate (PME) by using human breast (MCF-7, MDA-MB-231), endometrial (HEC-1A), cervical (SiHa, HeLa), ovarian (SKOV3) cancer cell lines, normal breast fibroblasts (MCF-10A) and also by in vivo models (ovariectomized Swiss albino mice). Our findings demonstrated that PME binds to ER and downregulates the Estrogen response elements (ERE)-mediated transcription in breast cancer cells without being agonistic in the uterine endometrium and has cardioprotective effects comparable to that of 17-β-estradiol. This preliminary work indicates the ability of PME to antagonize the activity of 27HC. We hypothesize that PME can compete with 27HC for ERα and reduce 27HC-induced proliferation of MCF-7 cells. Relevant estrogen-regulated genes such as pS2, PR and ERα were checked to evaluate the ability of PME to abrogate 27HC-induced genes. This study is significant, being the first report describing that bioactive components of the methanolic extract of pericarp of PME, a proven SERM could plausibly compete for 27HC.
Macrophage apoptosis is salient in advanced atherosclerotic lesions and is induced by several stimuli including endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. This study examined that α-asarone present in purple perilla abrogated macrophage injury caused by oxysterols via ER stress- and autophagy-mediated mechanisms. Nontoxic α-asarone at 1-20 μM attenuated 7β-hydroxycholesterol-induced activation of eukaryotic initiation factor 2α in macrophages leading to C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) expression and apoptosis due to sustained ER stress. The α-asarone treatment increased the formation of autophagolysosomes localizing in perinuclear regions of 7β-hydroxycholesterol-exposed macrophages. Consistently, this compound promoted the induction of the key autophagic proteins of beclin-1, vacuolar protein sorting 34 and p150 responsible for vesicle nucleation, and prompted the conversion of microtubule-associated protein 1A/1B-light chain 3 and the induction of p62, neighbor of BRCA1 and autophagy-related (Atg) 12-Atg5-Atg16L conjugate involved in phagophore expansion and autophagosome formation. Additionally, α-asarone increased ER phosphorylation of bcl-2 facilitating beclin-1 entry to autophagic process. Furthermore, the deletion of Atg5 or beclin-1 gene enhanced apoptotic CHOP induction. Collectively, α-asarone-stimulated autophagy may be potential multi-targeted therapeutic avenues in treating ER stress-associated macrophage apoptosis.
Meat intake is associated with the risk of colorectal cancer. The objective of this systematic review was to evaluate interactions between meat intake and genetic variation in order to identify biological pathways involved in meat carcinogenesis. We performed a literature search of PubMed and Embase using "interaction", "meat", "polymorphisms", and "colorectal cancer", and data on meat-gene interactions were extracted. The studies were divided according to whether information on meat intake was collected prospectively or retrospectively. In prospective studies, interactions between meat intake and polymorphisms in PTGS2 (encoding COX-2), ABCB1, IL10, NFKB1, MSH3, XPC (P int = 0.006, 0.01, 0.04, 0.03, 0.002, 0.01, respectively), but not IL1B, HMOX1, ABCC2, ABCG2, NR1I2 (encoding PXR), NR1H2 (encoding LXR), NAT1, NAT2, MSH6, or MLH1 in relation to CRC were found. Interaction between a polymorphism in XPC and meat was found in one prospective and one case-control study; however, the directions of the risk estimates were opposite. Thus, none of the findings were replicated. The results from this systematic review suggest that genetic variation in the inflammatory response and DNA repair pathway is involved in meat-related colorectal carcinogenesis, whereas no support for the involvement of heme and iron from meat or cooking mutagens was found. Further studies assessing interactions between meat intake and genetic variation in relation to CRC in large well-characterised prospective cohorts with relevant meat exposure are warranted. 
The cessation of progesterone (P(4)) production (i.e. functional regression), arguably the key event in luteolysis of the primate corpus luteum (CL), is poorly understood. Previously, we found that genes encoding proteins involved in cholesterol uptake decreased, while those involved in cholesterol efflux (reverse cholesterol transport, RCT) increased in expression during spontaneous functional regression of the rhesus macaque CL, thereby potentially depleting the cholesterol reserves needed for steroidogenesis. Therefore, a comprehensive analysis of the components necessary for RCT was performed. RCT components were expressed (mRNA and/or protein) in the macaque CL including cholesterol sensors (liver X receptors alpha or NR1H3; and beta or NR1H2), efflux proteins (ATP-binding cassette subfamilies A1 (ABCA1) and G1), acceptors (apolipoproteins A1 or APOA1; and E or APOE), and plasma proteins facilitating high-density lipoprotein formation (lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase or LCAT; phospholipid transfer protein or PLTP). ABCA1, APOE, PLTP, and NR1H3 increased, while lipoprotein receptors decreased, in expression (mRNA and/or protein) through the period of functional regression. The expression of APOA1 and APOE, as well as NR1H3, was greatest in the CL and tissues involved in regulating cholesterol homeostasis. Immunolocalization studies revealed that RCT proteins and lipoprotein receptors were expressed in large luteal cells, which possess intracellular cholesterol reserves during periods of P(4) synthesis. Lipid staining revealed changes in luteal cholesterol ester/lipid distribution that occurred following functional regression. These results indicate that decreased cholesterol uptake and increased RCT may be critical for the initiation of primate luteolysis by limiting intracellular cholesterol pools required for steroidogenesis.
An important step towards personalizing cancer treatment is to integrate heterogeneous evidences to catalog mutational hotspots that are biologically and therapeutically relevant and thus represent where targeted therapy would likely be beneficial. However, existing methods do not sufficiently delineate varying functionality of individual mutations within the same genes.
We observed a large discordancy of mutation rates across different mutation subtypes and tumor types, and nominated 702 hotspot mutations in 549 genes in the Catalog of Somatic Mutations in Cancer (COSMIC) by considering context specific mutation characteristics such as genes, cancer types, mutation rates, mutation subtypes and sequence contexts. We observed that hotspot mutations were highly prevalent in Non CpG-island C/G transition and transversion sequence contexts in 10 tumor types, and specific insertion hotspot mutations were enriched in breast cancer and deletion hotspot mutations in colorectal cancer. We found that the hotspot mutations nominated by our approach were significantly more conserved than non-hotspot mutations in the corresponding cancer genes. We also examined the biological significance and pharmacogenomics properties of these hotspot mutations using data in the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the Cancer Cell-Line Encyclopedia (CCLE), and found that 53 hotspot mutations are independently associated with diverse functional evidences in 1) mRNA and protein expression, 2) pathway activity, or 3) drug sensitivity and 82 were highly enriched in specific tumor types. We highlighted the distinct functional indications of hotspot mutations under different contexts and nominated novel hotspot mutations such as MAP3K4 A1199 deletion, NR1H2 Q175 insertion, and GATA3 P409 insertion as potential biomarkers or drug targets.
We identified a set of hotspot mutations across 17 tumor types by considering the background mutation rate variations among genes, tumor subtypes, mutation subtypes, and sequence contexts. We illustrated the common and distinct mutational signatures of hotspot mutations among different tumor types and investigated their variable functional relevance under different contexts, which could potentially serve as a resource for explicitly selecting targets for diagnosis, drug development, and patient management.
The genomics era has brought along the completed sequencing of a large number of bird genomes that cover a broad range of the avian phylogenetic tree (&gt;30 orders), leading to major novel insights into avian biology and evolution. Among recent findings, the discovery that birds lack a large number of protein coding genes that are organized in highly conserved syntenic clusters in other vertebrates is very intriguing, given the physiological importance of many of these genes. A considerable number of them play prominent endocrine roles, suggesting that birds evolved compensatory genetic or physiological mechanisms that allowed them to survive and thrive in spite of these losses. While further studies are needed to establish the exact extent of avian gene losses, these findings point to birds as potentially highly relevant model organisms for exploring the genetic basis and possible therapeutic approaches for a wide range of endocrine functions and disorders.
Accumulation of α-synuclein (αSyn) aggregates constitutes the hallmark of synucleinopathies including Parkinson's disease. However, many steps from the innocuous, monomeric αSyn toward misfolded oligomers and fibrillar species remain unclear. Here, we show that αSyn can form in solution α-helical oligomers, which are off-pathway to fibrillization, through interaction with the tetrapyrrole phthalocyanine tetrasulfonate. Chemical cross-linking combined with mass spectrometry reveals a large number of intermolecular cross-links along the entire αSyn sequence in the phthalocyanine tetrasulfonate-stabilized αSyn oligomers. Our study suggests that stabilization of structured oligomers by small molecules provides a viable strategy to interfere with αSyn fibrillization.
Current regulations command to properly characterize pharmaceutically relevant solid systems. Chemometrics comprise a range of valuable tools, suitable to process large amounts of data and extract valuable information hidden in their structure. This review aims to detail the results of the fruitful association between analytical techniques and chemometrics methods, focusing on those which help to gain insight into the characteristics of drug polymorphism as an important aspect of the solid state of bulk drugs and drug products. Hence, the combination of Raman, terahertz, mid- and near- infrared spectroscopies, as well as instrumental signals resulting from X-ray powder diffraction, 13C solid state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and thermal methods with quali-and quantitative chemometrics methodologies are examined. The main issues reviewed, concerning pharmaceutical drug polymorphism, include the use of chemometrics-based approaches to perform polymorph classification and assignment of polymorphic identity, as well as the determination of given polymorphs in simple mixtures and complex systems. Aspects such as the solvation/desolvation of solids, phase transformation, crystallinity and the recrystallization from the amorphous state are also discussed. A brief perspective of the field for the next future is provided, based on the developments of the last decade and the current state of the art of analytical instrumentation and chemometrics methodologies.
The external contamination of bird feathers with crude oil might have effects on feather structure and thus on thermoregulation. We tested the thermoregulatory ability of western sandpipers (Calidris mauri) in a respirometry chamber with oil applied either immediately prior, or three days before the experiment. The birds were then exposed to a sliding cold temperature challenge between 27°C and -3°C to calculate thermal conductance. After the experiment, a large blood sample was taken and the liver extracted to measure a range of parameters linked to toxicology and oxidative stress. No differences in thermal conductance were observed among groups, but birds exposed to oil for three days had reduced body temperatures and lost more body mass during that period. At necropsy, oiled birds showed a decrease in plasma albumin and sodium, and an increase in urea. This is reflective of dysfunction in the kidney at the loop of Henle. Birds, especially when exposed to the oil for three days, showed signs of oxidative stress and oxidative damage. These results show that the ingestion of externally applied oil through preening or drinking can cause toxic effects even in low doses, while we did not detect a direct effect of the external oil on thermoregulation over the temperature range tested.
Liver transplantation is the definitive treatment for patients with end-stage liver diseases (ESLD). However, it is hampered by shortage of liver donor. Liver tissue engineering, aiming at fabricating new livers in vitro, provides a potential resolution for donor shortage. Three elements need to be considered in liver tissue engineering: seeding cell resources, scaffolds and bioreactors. Studies have shown potential cell sources as hepatocytes, hepatic cell line, mesenchymal stem cells and others. They need scaffolds with perfect biocompatiblity, suitable micro-structure and appropriate degradation rate, which are essential charateristics for cell attachment, proliferation and secretion in forming extracellular matrix. The most promising scaffolds in research include decellularized whole liver, collagens and biocompatible plastic. The development and function of cells in scaffold need a microenvironment which can provide them with oxygen, nutrition, growth factors, et al. Bioreactor is expected to fulfill these requirements by mimicking the living condition in vivo. Although there is great progress in these three domains, a large gap stays still between their researches and applications. Herein, we summarized the recent development in these three major fields which are indispensable in liver tissue engineering.
Post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression can be achieved through the control of mRNA stability, cytoplasmic compartmentalization, 3' UTR length and translational efficacy. Spermiogenesis, a process through which haploid male germ cells differentiate into spermatozoa, represents an ideal model for studying post-transcriptional regulation in vivo because it involves a large number of transcripts that are physically sequestered in ribonucleoprotein particles (RNPs) and thus subjected to delayed translation. To explore how small RNAs regulate mRNA fate, we conducted RNA-Seq analyses to determine not only the levels of both mRNAs and small noncoding RNAs, but also their cytoplasmic compartmentalization during spermiogenesis.
Among all small noncoding RNAs studied, miRNAs displayed the most dynamic changes in both abundance and subcytoplasmic localization. mRNAs with shorter 3' UTRs became increasingly enriched in RNPs from pachytene spermatocytes to round spermatids, and the enrichment of shorter 3' UTR mRNAs in RNPs coincided with newly synthesized miRNAs that target these mRNAs at sites closer to the stop codon. In contrast, the translocation of longer 3' UTR mRNAs from RNPs to polysomes correlated with the production of new miRNAs that target these mRNAs at sites distal to the stop codon.
miRNAs appear to control cytoplasmic compartmentalization of mRNAs based on 3' UTR length. Our data suggest that transcripts with longer 3' UTRs tend to contain distal miRNA binding sites and are thus targeted to polysomes for translation followed by degradation. In contrast, those with shorter 3' UTRs only possess proximal miRNA binding sites, which, therefore, are targeted into RNPs for enrichment and delayed translation.
We all pass out our lives in private perceptual worlds. The differences in our sensory and perceptual experiences often go unnoticed until there emerges a variation (such as 'The Dress') that is large enough to generate different descriptions in the coarse coinage of our shared language. In this essay, we illustrate how individual differences contribute to a richer understanding of visual perception, but we also indicate some potential pitfalls that face the investigator who ventures into the field.
For the first time, third-order liquid chromatography with excitation-emission fluorescence matrix detection (LC-EEFM) data were generated on-line and chemometrically processed for the simultaneous quantitation of the heavy-polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons fluoranthene, pyrene, benz[a]anthracene, chrysene, benzo[b]fluoranthene, benzo[k]fluoranthene, benzo[a]pyrene, and dibenz[a,h]anthracene. The applied experimental strategy is very simple, and is based on the reduction of the linear flow rate by fitting a larger diameter connecting-tube between the column outlet and the fluorimetric detector. In this way, EEFMs were successfully recorded on-line, without involving a large total analysis time. Because in the studied system quadrilinearity was fulfilled, four-way parallel factor (PARAFAC) analysis was applied for data processing. The second-order advantage, which is an intrinsic property of data of at least second-order, allowed the quantification of the analytes in interfering media. Moreover, resolution of the system with a high degree of collinearity was achieved thanks to the third-order advantage. In addition to a selectivity improvement, third-order/four-way calibration increased the sensitivity, with limits of detection in the range of 0.4-2.9ngmL-1. After a solid-phase extraction procedure with C18 membranes, considerably lower concentrations (between 0.033-2.70ngmL-1) were determined in real waters, with most recoveries in the range 90-106%.
Junctional membrane complexes facilitate excitation-contraction coupling in skeletal and cardiac muscle cells by forming subcellular invaginations that maintain close (≤20 nm) proximity of ryanodine receptors (RyRs) on the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) with voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels in the plasma membrane. In fully differentiated smooth muscle cells, junctional membrane complexes occur as distributed sites of peripheral coupling. We investigated the role of the cytoskeleton in maintaining peripheral coupling and associated Ca2+ signaling networks within native smooth muscle cells of mouse and rat cerebral arteries. Using live-cell confocal and superresolution microscopy, we found that the tight interactions between the SR and the plasma membrane in these cells relied on arching microtubule structures present at the periphery of smooth muscle cells and were independent of the actin cytoskeleton. Loss of peripheral coupling associated with microtubule depolymerization altered the spatiotemporal properties of localized Ca2+ sparks generated by the release of Ca2+ through type 2 RyRs (RyR2s) on the SR and decreased the number of sites of colocalization between RyR2s and large-conductance Ca2+-activated K+ (BK) channels. The reduced BK channel activity associated with the loss of SR-plasma membrane interactions was accompanied by increased pressure-induced constriction of cerebral resistance arteries. We conclude that microtubule structures maintain peripheral coupling in contractile smooth muscle cells, which is crucial for the regulation of contractility and cerebral vascular tone.
Ascomycetes and zygomycetes account for the majority of (i) fungi responsible for cutaneous, subcutaneous, and invasive human fungal infections, (ii) plant fungal pathogens, (iii) fungi that threaten global biodiversity, (iv) fungal agents of agricultural spoilage, and (v) fungi in water-damaged buildings. Rapid recognition of fungal infection (or contamination) enables early treatment (or remediation). A bioinformatics search found homologues of Saccharomyces cerevisiae Mnn9p present in members of the Zygomycota and Ascomycota phyla and absent in members of the Chytridiomycota and Basidiomycota. Mnn9p is a component of the yeast mannan polymerization complex and is necessary for α-1,6 mannan production. A monoclonal antibody (2DA6) was produced that was reactive with purified mannans of Mucor, Rhizopus, Aspergillus, Fusarium, and Candida species. Experimentation using a 2DA6 antigen capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and extracts of fungi from the four phyla found agreement between the presence or absence of Mnn9p homologues and production or lack of production of mannan reactive with 2DA6. Studies of cell extracts from yeast mannan mutants identified α-1,6 mannan as the epitope recognized by 2DA6. To translate this finding into a point-of-use diagnostic, a 2DA6 lateral flow immunoassay was constructed that detected mannan in (i) extracts of dermatophytes and fungi that produce trauma-related infection and (ii) tissue from plants infected with Grosmannia clavigera or Sclerotium cepivorum These studies (i) revealed that the conservation of α-1,6-linked mannan in fungi of the Zygomycota and Ascomycota can be exploited as a broad diagnostic target and (ii) have provided a means to detect that target in an immunoassay platform that is well suited for clinic or field use.IMPORTANCE A key question asked when faced with an infection, an infestation, or environmental damage is whether it is a fungus. Identification of fungi as the cause of the problem can lead to remediation or treatment. Zygomycetes and ascomycetes account for the vast majority of fungal causes of human, animal, and plant disease, large-scale biodiversity loss, agricultural spoilage, and contamination of water-damaged buildings. These studies revealed the conservation of a common cell wall structural component of zygomycetes and ascomycetes to be a diagnostic target applicable to multiple pathogenic fungi and have leveraged that insight for practical use. Monoclonal antibodies reactive with this pan-fungal structure were produced and used to construct immunoassays (including ELISA and lateral flow assay) for detection of a broad range of pathogenic fungi.
Biodiesels produced from vegetable oils have a major quality problem due to the presence of steryl glucosides (SGs), which form precipitates that clog filters and cause engine failures. Recently, we described an enzymatic process for removing SGs from biodiesel. However, industrial adoption of this technology was hindered by the cost of the steryl glucosidase (SGase) enzyme used. Here we report the development and validation at the pilot scale of a cost-efficient process for manufacturing the SGase. First, we tested various low-cost carbon sources for the Escherichia coli producing strain, ultimately developing a fed-batch fermentation process that utilizes crude glycerol as a feedstock. Next, we designed an efficient process for isolating the SGase. That process uses a novel thermolysis approach in the presence of a non-ionic detergent, centrifugation to separate the solids, and ultrafiltration to concentrate and formulate the final product. Our cost analysis indicates that on a large scale, the dose of enzyme required to eliminate SGs from each ton of biodiesel will have a manufacturing cost below $1. The new process for manufacturing the SGase, which will lead to biodiesels of a higher quality, should contribute to facilitate the global adoption of this renewable fuel. Our technology could also be used to manufacture other thermostable proteins in E. coli.
The synthesis of an ionic quaterrylenebis(dicarboximide) 1a, a long-wavelength absorbing mesogen, is described. When compared with its analogue 2a, an ionic perylenebis(dicarboximide), the aromatic protons of 1a exchange with deuterium of concentrated D(2)SO(4) at a dramatically faster rate. In addition, stronger aggregation in aqueous media was observed for 1a.
The anti-HIV drug 3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine (AZT) is the drug of choice for preventing maternal-fetal HIV transmission during pregnancy. Our aim was to assess the cytotoxic effects of AZT on human placenta in vitro. The mechanisms of AZT-induced effects were investigated using JEG-3 choriocarcinoma cells and primary explant cultures from term and first-trimester human placentas. Cytotoxicity measures included trypan blue exclusion, MTT, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) assays. Apoptosis was measured with an antibody specific to cleaved caspase-3 and by rescue of cells by the general caspase inhibitor Boc-D-FMK. The effect of AZT on the activities of glutathione-S-transferase, beta-glucuronidase, UDP-glucuronosyl transferase, cytochrome P450 (CYP) 1A, and CYP reductase (CYPR) in the placenta was assessed using biochemical assays and immunoblotting. AZT increased ROS levels, decreased cellular proliferation rates, was toxic to mitochondria, and initiated cell death by a caspase-dependent mechanism in the human placenta in vitro. In the absence of serum, the effects of AZT were amplified in all the models used. AZT also increased the amounts of activity of GST, beta-glucuronidase, and CYP1A, whereas UGT and CYPR were decreased. We conclude that AZT causes apoptosis in the placenta and alters metabolizing enzymes in human placental cells. These findings have implications for the safe administration of AZT in pregnancy with respect to the maintenance of integrity of the maternal-fetal barrier.
The calcineurin (CaN) alpha and beta catalytic subunit isoforms are coexpressed within almost all cell types. The enzymatic properties of CaN heterodimers comprised of the regulatory B subunit (CnB) with either the alpha or beta catalytic subunit were compared using in vitro phosphatase assays. CaN containing the alpha isoform (CnA alpha) has lower K(m) and higher V(max) values than CaN containing the beta isoform (CnA beta) toward the PO4-RII, PO4-DARPP-32(20-38) peptides, and p-nitrophenylphosphate (pNPP). CaN heterodimers containing the alpha or beta catalytic subunit isoform displayed identical calmodulin dissociation rates. Similar inhibition curves for each CaN heterodimer were obtained with the CaN autoinhibitory peptide (CaP) and cyclophilin A/cyclosporin A (CyPA/CsA) using each peptide substrate at K(m) concentrations, except for a five- to ninefold higher IC50 value measured for CaN containing the beta isoform with p-nitrophenylphosphate as substrate. No difference in stimulation of phosphatase activity toward p-nitrophenylphosphate by FKBP12/FK506 was observed. At low concentrations of FKBP12/FK506, CaN containing the alpha isoform is more sensitive to inhibition than CaN containing the beta isoform using the phosphopeptide substrates. Higher concentrations of FKBP12/FK506 are required for maximal inhibition of beta CaN using PO4-DARPP-32(20-38) as substrate. The functional differences conferred upon CaN by the alpha or beta catalytic subunit isoforms suggest that the alpha:beta and CaN:substrate ratios may determine the levels of CaN phosphatase activity toward specific substrates within tissues and specific cell types. These findings also indicate that the alpha and beta catalytic subunit isoforms give rise to substrate-dependent differences in sensitivity toward FKBP12/FK506.
To investigate the proposed molecular characteristics of sugar-mediated repression of photosynthetic genes during plant acclimation to elevated CO2, we examined the relationship between the accumulation and metabolism of nonstructural carbohydrates and changes in ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco) gene expression in leaves of Arabidopsis thaliana exposed to elevated CO2. Long-term growth of Arabidopsis at high CO2 (1000 microL L-1) resulted in a 2-fold increase in nonstructural carbohydrates, a large decrease in the expression of Rubisco protein and in the transcript of rbcL, the gene encoding the large subunit of Rubisco (approximately 35-40%), and an even greater decline in mRNA of rbcS, the gene encoding the small subunit (approximately 60%). This differential response of protein and mRNAs suggests that transcriptional/posttranscriptional processes and protein turnover may determine the final amount of leaf Rubisco protein at high CO2. Analysis of mRNA levels of individual rbcS genes indicated that reduction in total rbcS transcripts was caused by decreased expression of all four rbcS genes. Short-term transfer of Arabidopsis plants grown at ambient CO2 to high CO2 resulted in a decrease in total rbcS mRNA by d 6, whereas Rubisco content and rbcL mRNA decreased by d 9. Transfer to high CO2 reduced the maximum expression level of the primary rbcS genes (1A and, particularly, 3B) by limiting their normal pattern of accumulation through the night period. The decreased nighttime levels of rbcS mRNA were associated with a nocturnal increase in leaf hexoses. We suggest that prolonged nighttime hexose metabolism resulting from exposure to elevated CO2 affects rbcS transcript accumulation and, ultimately, the level of Rubisco protein.
The rationale for this study was to assess the expression, activity and localization of the enzymes uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase (UGT), beta-glucuronidase, cytochrome P450 1A (CYP1A) and cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1) in first trimester human placenta and to gauge the effects of maternal variables on placental metabolism.
CYP1A, CYP2E1, UGT and beta-glucuronidase activities were assessed in 25 placentas using ethoxyresorufin, chlorzoxazone, 4-methylumbelliferone and 4-methylumbelliferone glucuronide respectively. Protein expression and localization were detected by immunoblot and immunohistochemistry. All statistics were non-parametric.
UGT, beta-glucuronidase and CYP1A activities were detected in all placentas sampled; CYP2E1 was undetectable. CYP1A, UGT1A UGT2B proteins were detected in all placentas (n = 6) tested and CYP2E1 in 4/6 placentas sampled and were localized to the syncytium. UGT and CYP1A activities were significantly elevated in the placentas of mothers who smoked (P &lt; 0.05 and P &lt; 0.001 respectively) and were greatest in women who both smoked and drank alcohol (P &lt; 0.05 and P &lt; 0.01 respectively). Enzyme activities were significantly negatively correlated with gestational age (P &lt; 0.05, r = 0.54, UGT) and maternal age respectively (P &lt; 0.001, r = 0.63, CYP1A). beta-Glucuronidase activity did not differ with patient variables.
Metabolism of compounds by the human placenta in the first trimester may be affected by maternal and environmental factors altering the activity of constitutive metabolizing enzymes.
This study was designed to determine the effects of feed restriction and monopropylene glycol (MPG) supplementation on the reproductive, milk production, and somatotropic axes in dairy heifers postpartum. At calving, 49 Holstein-Friesian heifers were allowed either unrestricted (UNR; n = 18) or restricted access to pasture with (RES+MPG; n = 13) or without (RES; n = 18) MPG supplementation (250 mL drenched twice daily for 150 d). The average body condition score (BCS) of the heifers was 5.3 +/- 0.2 on a scale from 1 to 10 (where 1 = emaciated and 10 = obese). Body condition score and body weight were similar among the groups at calving and decreased after calving for all groups. However, body weight loss was around 10% greater for the RES and RES+MPG groups from wk 3 to 12 compared with UNR group. The length of the postpartum anestrous interval was similar for all groups (47, 51, and 45 +/- 5 d for the UNR, RES, and RES+MPG, respectively). Average milk production, protein, fat, and lactose yields during the first 12 wk postpartum were greater in the UNR group than in the RES and RES+MPG groups. Feed restriction affected plasma concentrations of insulin, with lower concentrations in the RES group compared with the UNR group. There were no differences in plasma concentrations of insulin between the RES+MPG group and the UNR or RES groups. An effect of feed restriction was observed on insulin-like growth factor-I concentrations and also a treatment by time interaction with a changing pattern through time as concentrations in the UNR group increased relative to the RES and RES+MPG groups. There were no differences in growth hormone concentrations among the groups. Glucose concentrations were lower in the RES group when compared with RES+MPG and UNR groups and this difference lessened over time. Plasma concentrations of nonesterified fatty acids were greater in the RES group compared with the RES+MPG and UNR groups. Leptin concentrations in the UNR group were greater than in the RES and RES+MPG groups. Hepatic growth hormone receptor 1A, total growth hormone receptor, and insulin-like growth factor-I relative mRNA expressions decreased postpartum with no effect of feed restriction, MPG supplementation, or interaction between time and treatment. During a challenge with MPG, insulin secretion was stimulated but no effect on postpartum anestrous interval in the treatment groups was observed. It was concluded that restricted pasture availability postpartum in dairy heifers calving in optimal BCS had no effect on the postpartum anestrous interval. It did however decrease milk production; thus, we can infer that monopropylene glycol supplementation does not act to prevent loss of milk yield.
Competitive glycosylation experiments with a galactofuranosyl trichloroacetimidate donor were performed with glucosamine acceptors having a free 4-OH group and carrying different protecting groups at N-2, O-3, and O-6. The most reactive acceptor is the N-dimethylmaleimido 3,6-di-O-benzylated derivative (6c), which reacts even faster than the oxazolidinone 1a. Molecular orbital calculations have helped to rationalize these experimental facts in terms of a hard-hard reaction occurring between the donor and the acceptor.
A series of picolyl-substituted NHC-bridged triangular complexes of Ag(I) and Cu(I) were synthesized upon reaction of the corresponding ligand precursors, [Him(CH(2)py)(2)]BF(4) (1a), [Him(CH(2)py-3,4-(OMe)(2))(2)]BF(4) (1b), [Him(CH(2)py-3,5-Me(2)-4-OMe)(2)]BF(4) (1c), [Him(CH(2)py-6-COOMe)(2)]BF(4) (1d), and [H(S)im(CH(2)py)(2)]BF(4) (1e), with Ag(2)O and Cu(2)O, respectively. Complexes [Cu(3)(im(CH(2)py)(2))(3)](BF(4))(3) (2a), [Cu(3)(im(CH(2)py-3,4-(OMe)(2))(2))(3)](BF(4))(3) (2b), [Cu(3)(im(CH(2)py-3,5-Me(2)-4-OMe)(2))(3)](BF(4))(3), (2c), [Ag(3)(im(CH(2)py-3,4-(OMe)(2))(2))(3)](BF(4))(3), (3b), [Ag(3)(im(CH(2)py-3,5-Me(2)-4-OMe)(2))(3)](BF(4))(3) (3c), [Ag(3)(im(CH(2)py-6-COOMe)(2))(3)](BF(4))(3) (3d), and [Ag(3)((S)im(CH(2)py)(2))(3)](BF(4))(3) (3e) were easily prepared by this method. Complex 2e, [Cu(3)((S)im(CH(2)py)(2))(3)](BF(4))(3), was synthesized by a carbene-transfer reaction of 3e, [Ag(3)((S)im(CH(2)py)(2))(3)](BF(4))(3), with CuCl in acetonitrile. The ligand precursor 1d did not react with Cu(2)O. All complexes were fully characterized by NMR, UV-vis, and luminescence spectroscopies and high-resolution mass spectrometry. Complexes 2a-2c, 2e, and 3b-3e were additionally characterized by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. Each metal complex contains a nearly equilateral triangular M(3) core wrapped by three bridging NHC ligands. In 2a-2c and 2e, the Cu-Cu separations are short and range from 2.4907 to 2.5150 Å. In the corresponding Ag(I) system, the metal-metal separations range from 2.7226 to 2.8624 Å. The Cu(I)-containing species are intensely blue photoluminescent at room temperature both in solution and in the solid state. Upon UV excitation in CH(3)CN, complexes 2a-2c and 2e emit at 459, 427, 429, and 441 nm, whereas in the solid state, these bands move to 433, 429, 432, and 440 nm, respectively. As demonstrated by (1)H NMR spectroscopy, complexes 3b-3e are dynamic in solution and undergo a ligand dissociation process. Complexes 3b-3e are weakly photoemissive in the solid state.
We have used a yeast genetic system to isolate cDNAs encoding proteins that specifically interact with the ligand-binding domain of human retinoid X receptor-alpha (RXR alpha). A number encoded portions of two known RXR heterodimer partners, the retinoic acid receptor (RAR) and the peroxisome proliferator activated receptor. Of four additional RXR-interacting proteins (RIPs) selected for further study two, RIP14 and RIP15, are previously unidentified orphan members of the nuclear receptor superfamily. Two others, RIP110 and RIP13, do not show significant similarities to previously reported proteins. RIP110 interacts with LexA-RXR only in yeast cells grown in the presence of the RXR ligand 9-cis-RA, while the interaction of the four receptor superfamily members and RIP13 is unaffected by the presence or absence of 9-cis-RA. RIP110 and RIP13 also interact in yeast with several other members of the receptor superfamily, but RIP14 and RIP15 interact only with RXR. Analysis of larger cDNA clones demonstrates that there are at least two isoforms of RIP14 that differ in the N-terminal (A and B) and hinge (D) domains. Northern blot analysis indicates that RIP14 is expressed specifically in liver and kidney, while RIP15 is expressed in every tissue tested. Both RIP14 and 15 bind as heterodimers with RXR to the RA response element (RARE) from the promoter of the RAR beta 2 isoform (the beta RARE), and RIP14 and RXR heterodimers also bind the ecdysone response element from the Drosophila heat shock protein 27 promoter. Both heterodimers also bind to several synthetic RAREs and other elements. In cotransfections, neither RIP14 nor RIP15 trans-activates a reporter containing multiple copies of the beta RARE under any of a variety of conditions, suggesting that their activities are dependent on the binding of as yet unidentified specific ligands or on activation by other processes.
Niemann-Pick C1-like 1 (NPC1L1), ATP-binding cassette (ABC)G5, and ABCG8 mediate intestinal cholesterol absorption. It is unclear whether pravastatin (PR) or ezetimibe (EZ) affect expression of these transporters. We examined the effects of PR and EZ on NPC1L1, ABCG5, and ABCG8 expression in human hepatoma HepG2 cells and the murine small intestine. We also assessed expression of the transcription factors liver X receptor (LXR)a, LXRb and sterol regulatory element-binding protein.
Transporter mRNA levels were determined in murine small intestines 6 and 24 h after oral PR and EZ administration by real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). In PR- and EZ-treated HepG2 cells, transporter and transcription factor mRNA and protein levels were examined by RT-PCR and western blot, respectively.
Significant decreases in NPC1L1, ABCG5, and ABCG8 mRNA expression were observed in the duodenum, but not jejunum and ileum, of mice 24 h after treatment with PR, but not EZ. In HepG2 cells, PR but not EZ treatment for 24 h also significantly decreased NPC1L1 protein and ABCG5, and ABCG8 mRNA expression, while increasing LXRa mRNA levels.
PR but not EZ treatment reduced duodenal cholesterol transporter expression in mice. PR-induced increases in LXRa mRNA levels may be involved in attenuation of NPC1L1 expression, subsequently decreasing intestinal cholesterol absorption.
Uveal melanoma (UM) is recognized as the most common intraocular malignancy and the second most common form of melanoma. Nearly 50% of UM patients develop untreatable and fatal metastases. The 48-member nuclear receptor (NR) superfamily represents a therapeutically targetable group of transcription factors known for their regulation of key cancer pathways in numerous tumor types. Here, we profiled the expression of the 48 human NRs by qRT-PCR across a melanoma cell line panel including 5 UM lines, 9 cutaneous melanoma (CM) lines, and normal primary melanocytes. NR expression patterns identified a few key features. First, in agreement with our past studies identifying RXRg as a CM-specific marker, we found that UM cells also exhibit high levels of RXRg expression, making it a universal biomarker for melanoma tumors. Second, we found that LXRb is highly expressed in both UM and CM lines, suggesting that it may be a therapeutic target in a UM metastatic setting as it has been in CM models. Third, we found that RARg, PPARd, EAR2, RXRa, and TRa expressions could subdivide UM from CM. Previous studies of UM cancers identified key mutations in three genes: GNAQ, GNA11, and BRAF. We found unique NR expression profiles associated with each of these UM mutations. We then performed NR-to-NR and NR-to-genome expression correlation analyses to find potential NR-driven transcriptional programs activated in UM and CM. Specifically, RXRg controlled gene networks were identified that may drive melanoma-specific signaling and metabolism. ERRa was identified as a UM-defining NR and genes correlated with its expression confirm the role of ERRa in metabolic control. Given the plethora of available NR agonists, antagonists, and selective receptor modulators, pharmacologic manipulation of these NRs and their transcriptional outputs may lead to a more comprehensive understanding of key UM pathways and how we can leverage them for better therapeutic alternatives. 
We examined the function of the oxysterol receptors (LXRs) in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) through studying dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)- and 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS)-induced colitis in mice and by elucidating molecular mechanisms underlying their anti-inflammatory action. We observed that Lxr-deficient mice are more susceptible to colitis. Clinical indicators of colitis including weight loss, diarrhea and blood in feces appeared earlier and were more severe in Lxr-deficient mice and particularly LXRβ protected against symptoms of colitis. Addition of an LXR agonist led to faster recovery and increased survival. In contrast, Lxr-deficient mice showed slower recovery and decreased survival. In Lxr-deficient mice, inflammatory cytokines and chemokines were increased together with increased infiltration of immune cells in the colon epithelium. Activation of LXRs strongly suppressed expression of inflammatory mediators including TNFα. While LXRα had anti-inflammatory effects in CD11b(+) immune cell populations, LXRβ in addition had anti-inflammatory effects in colon epithelial cells. Lack of LXRβ also induced CD4(+)/CD3(+) immune cell recruitment to the inflamed colon. Expression of both LXRA and LXRB was significantly suppressed in inflamed colon from subjects with IBD compared with non-inflamed colon. Taken together, our observations suggest that the LXRs could provide interesting targets to reduce the inflammatory responses in IBD. 
The Liver X receptors (LXRs), Liver X receptor A (LXRA) and Liver X receptor B (LXRB), regulate lipid metabolism and antimicrobial response. LXRs have a crucial role in the control of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb). Lacking LXRs mice is more susceptibility to infection M.tb, developing higher bacterial burdens and an increase in the size and number of granulomatous lesions. We aimed to assess the associations between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in LXRs and risk of tuberculosis.
We sequenced the LXRs genes to detect SNPs and to examine genotypic frequencies in 600 patients and 620 healthy controls to investigate for associations with tuberculosis (TB) in the Chinese Han population. DNA re-sequencing revealed eight common variants in the LXRs genes.
The G allele of rs1449627 and the T allele of rs1405655 demonstrated an increased risk of developing TB (p&lt;0.001, p = 0.002), and the T allele of rs3758673, the T allele of rs2279238, and the C allele of rs1449626 in LXRA and the C allele of rs17373080, the G allele of rs2248949, and the C allele of rs1052677 in LXRB were protective against TB patients compared to healthy controls (p = 0.0002, p = 0.006, p&lt;0.001, p = 0.004, p = 0.008, p = 0.003, respectively). All SNP genotypes were significantly associated with TB. An estimation of the frequencies of haplotypes revealed two potential risk haplotypes,GGCG in LXRB (p = 0.004,) and TTCG in LXRA (p&lt;0.001, p = 0.004). Moreover, three protective haplotypes, TTAT and CCAT in LXRA and CATC in LXRB, were significantly "protective" (p = 0.008, p&lt;0.001, p = 0.031) for TB. Furthermore, we determined that the LXRs SNPs were nominally associated with the clinical pattern of disease.
Our study data supported that LXRs play a fundamental role in the genetic susceptibility to TB and to different clinical patterns of disease. Thus, further investigation is required in larger populations and in additional areas.
Apolipoprotein M (APOM) has been suggested as a vasculoprotective constituent of high density lipoprotein (HDL), which plays a crucial role behind the mechanism of HDL-mediated anti-atherosclerosis. Previous studies demonstrated that insulin resistance could associate with decreased APOM expressions. In agreement with our previous reports, here, we further confirmed that the insulin sensitivity was also reduced in rats treated with high concentrations of glucose; such effect could be reversed by administration of rosiglitazone, a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPARγ). The present study shows that Apom expression is significantly affected by either rosiglitazone or hyperglycemia alone without cross interaction with each other, which indicates that the pathway of Apom expression regulating by hyperglycemia might be differed from that by rosiglitazone. Further study indicated that hyperglycemia could significantly inhibit mRNA levels of Lxrb (P=0.0002), small heterodimer partner 1 (Shp1) (P&lt;0.0001), liver receptor homologue-1 (Lrh1) (P=0.0012), ATP-binding cassette transporter 1 (Abca1) (P=0.0012) and Pparb/d (P=0.0043). Two-way ANOVA analysis demonstrated that the interactions between rosiglitazone and infusion of 25% glucose solution on Shp1 (P=0.0054) and Abca1 (4E, P=0.0004) mRNA expression was statistically significant. It is concluded that rosiglitazone could increase Apom expression, of which the detailed mechanism needs to be further investigated. The downregulation of Apom by hyperglycemia might be mainly through decreasing expression of Pparg and followed by inhibiting Lxrb in rats. 
Liver X receptor [LXR; nuclear receptor subfamily 1, group H, member 2 (NR1H2, alias LXRB)] can inhibit proliferation and induce apoptosis of cancer cells. Its relationship with disease severity is not known.
Expression of LXRB, ATP binding cassette subfamily A member 1 (ABCA1), ATP binding cassette subfamily G member 1 (ABCG1), apolipoprotein E (APOE) and paraoxonase 2 (PON2) were determined in 69 breast tumors and were related to clinical stages of the disease and tumor characteristics, as well as time to recurrence.
ABCG1 expression differed with the tumor Scarff Bloom and Richardson (SBR) status (p=0.02), with a lower expression in SBRIII than in SBRII and SBRI. ABCG1 expression was significantly higher in estrogen receptor-positive tumors (N=63) (p=0.02). APOE expression was significantly lower in progesterone receptor-positive tumors (N=55) (p=0.03). No relationship with time to recurrence was observed.
Expression of some LXR-dependent genes is related to breast tumor characteristics, but not time to recurrence. This may be due to a lack of study power or too short a follow-up time.
In ruminants, recent research has identified a crucial role for liver X receptors (LXR) in regulating lipid metabolism in mammary cells. However, the differences between LXR subtypes in regulating ruminant lipid metabolism are unknown. We used overexpression and knockdown of LXRA and LXRB in goat primary mammary epithelial cells to distinguish subtype-specific regulation of sterol regulatory element binding protein 1c (SREBP1c) and fatty acid synthase (FASN) mRNA expression and their promoter activity. Incubation with siRNA targeting LXR decreased expression of LXRA and LXRB. Knockdown of LXRA and LXRB in cells incubated with dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, control) had no effect on the expression of SREBP1c or FASN. Knockdown of LXRB in cells incubated with LXR ligand T0901317 (T09) led to decreased expression of FASN, but not SREBP1c. Overexpression of LXRB plus T09 dramatically upregulated SREBP1c and FASN to levels higher than overexpression of LXRA with T09. Luciferase reporter assays in cells with site-directed mutagenesis of LXR response elements (LXRE; LXRE1 from -286 to -251 bp or LXRE2 from -235 to -219 bp) revealed that the SREBP1c promoter with the wild type or either LXRE mutation in cells supplemented with T09 decreased markedly only when LXRB was knocked down. Knockdown of LXRA and LXRB had no effect on the SREBP1c promoter when cells had a double LXRE mutation. Overexpression of LXRA only in cells incubated with T09 increased the activity of the SREBP1c promoter with the wild type and the LXRE2 mutation. In contrast, compared with each control group, overexpression of LXRB dramatically increased SREBP1c promoter activity, regardless of LXRE mutation. Furthermore, in cells stimulated with T09, knockdown of either LXRA or LXRB did not alter wild-type FASN promoter activity. Knockdown of LXRA increased wild-type and LXRE-site-mutated (LXRE from -677 to -662 bp) FASN promoter activity. Overexpression of LXRB increased wild-type and LXRE-site-mutated FASN promoter activity regardless of treatment with DMSO or T09, but overexpression of LXRA altered LXRE-site-mutated FASN promoter activity only in cells treated with DMSO. Increased activation of SREBP1c or FASN promoters containing LXRE mutations after overexpression of LXRB suggested that LXRB activates endogenous SREBP1c, which can then bind to the promoter of SREBP1c via an auto-loop circuit regulatory mechanism. Collectively, these results highlight an important role for LXRB in the transcriptional regulation of SREBP1c and FASN in goat mammary epithelial cells. Activation of this nuclear receptor controls lipogenesis via different mechanisms.
Tissue specific expression of genes encoding cholesterol transporters ABCA1 and ABCG1 as well as genes encoding the most important transcriptional regulators of adipogenesis - LXRa, LXRb, PPARg and RORa has been investigated in intraabdominal adipose tissue (IAT) samples.A direct correlation between the content of ABCA1 and ABCG1 proteins with RORa protein level (r=0.480, p&lt;0.05; r=0.435, p&lt;0.05, respectively) suggests the role of the transcription factor RORa in the regulation of IAT ABCA1 and ABCG1 protein levels. ABCA1 and ABCG1 gene expression positively correlated with obesity indicators such as body mass index (BMI) (r=0.522, p=0.004; r=0.594, p=0.001, respectively) and waist circumference (r=0.403, p=0.033; r=0.474, p=0.013, respectively). The development of obesity is associated with decreased IAT levels of RORa and LXRb mRNA (p=0.016 and p=0.002, respectively). These data suggest that the nuclear factor RORa can play a significant role in the regulation of cholesterol metabolism and control IAT expression of ABCA1 and ABCG1, while the level of IAT LXRb gene expression may be an important factor associated with the development of obesity.

Triclosan (TCS), a commonly used antimicrobial compound, has recently been detected in the eggs of wild avian species. Exposure to TCS in rodents is known to interfere with thyroid hormone (TH), disrupt immune responses and cause liver disease. However, no attempt has been made to clarify the effects of TCS in avian species. The aim of this study is therefore to evaluate the toxic effects of in ovo exposure to TCS and explore the molecular mechanism by transcriptome analysis in the embryonic liver of a model avian species, chicken (Gallus gallus). Embryos were treated with graded concentration of TCS (0.1, 1 and 10 μg/g egg) at Hamburger Hamilton Stage (HHS) 1 (1st day), followed by 20 days of incubation to HHS 46. At the administration of 10 μg TCS/g egg, embryo mortality increased from 20% in control to 37% accompanied with 8% attenuation in tarsus length. While liver somatic index (LSI) in TCS treatments was enhanced, statistical difference was only observed at the treatment of 0.1 μg TCS/g egg in females. The up-regulation of several crucial differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in transcriptome analysis suggested that TCS induced xenobiotic metabolism (e.g. CYP2C23a, CYP2C45 and CYP3A37 in males; CYP2C45 in females) and activated the thyroid hormone receptor (THR) - mediated downstream signaling (e.g. THRSPB and DIO2 in males; THRSPB in females). In females, TCS may further activate the lipogenesis signaling (e.g. ACSL5, ELOVL2) and repress the lipolysis signaling (e.g. ABHD5, ACAT2). A battery of enriched transcription factors in relation to these TCS-induced signaling and phenotypes were found, including activated SREBF1, PPARa, LXRa, and LXRb in males and activated GLI2 in females; COUP-TFII was predicted to be suppressed in both genders. Finally, we developed adverse outcome pathways (AOPs) that provide insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the alteration of phenotypes.
The signals that determine atherosclerosis-specific DNA methylation profiles are only partially known. We previously identified a 29-bp DNA motif (differential methylation motif [DMM]) proximal to CpG islands (CGIs) that undergo demethylation in advanced human atheromas. Those data hinted that the DMM docks modifiers of DNA methylation and transcription.
We sought to functionally characterize the DMM. We showed that the DMM overlaps with the RNA polymerase III-binding B box of Alu short interspersed nuclear elements and contains a DR2 nuclear receptor response element. Pointing to a possible functional role for an Alu DMM, CGIs proximal (&lt;100 bp) to near-intact DMM-harboring Alu are significantly less methylated relative to CGIs proximal to degenerate DMM-harboring Alu or to DMM-devoid mammalian-wide interspersed repeat short interspersed nuclear elements in human arteries. As for DMM-binding factors, LXRB (liver X receptor β) binds the DMM in a DR2-dependent fashion, and LXR (liver X receptor) agonists induce significant hypermethylation of the bulk of Alu in THP-1 cells. Furthermore, we describe 3 intergenic long noncoding RNAs that harbor a DMM, are under transcriptional control by LXR agonists, and are differentially expressed between normal and atherosclerotic human aortas. Notably, CGIs adjacent to those long noncoding RNAs tend to be hypomethylated in symptomatic relative to stable human atheromas.
Collectively, the data suggest that a DMM is associated with 2 distinct methylation states: relatively low methylation of in cis CGIs and Alu element hypermethylation. Based on the known atheroprotective role of LXRs, we propose that LXR agonist-induced Alu hypermethylation, a landmark of atherosclerosis, is a compensatory rather than proatherogenic response.
Epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs) are efficient in treating patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring EGFR activating mutations. Unfortunately, nearly all patients ultimately acquire resistance to EGFR-TKI treatment. Liver X receptors (LXRs) can regulate tumor growth in various cancer cell lines. The present study indicated that LXR agonist combined with gefitinib weakened Akt-nuclear factor (NF)-κB activation and inhibited the expression levels of apoptosis-related proteins in vitro. By contrast, LXR ligands alone exhibited no significant effect on gefitinib-resistant lung cells. In conclusion, the study provided evidence for the combination treatment of acquired TKI resistance in NSCLC.
The prevalence of obesity and atherosclerosis has substantially increased worldwide over the past several decades. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs), as fatty acids sensors, have been therapeutic targets in several human lipid metabolic diseases, such as obesity, atherosclerosis, diabetes, hyperlipidaemia, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Constitutive androstane receptor (CAR) and liver X receptors (LXRs) were also reported as potential therapeutic targets for the treatment of obesity and atherosclerosis, respectively. Further clarification of the internal relationships between these three lipid metabolic nuclear receptors is necessary to enable drug discovery. In this review, we mainly summarized the cross-talk of PPARs-CAR in obesity and PPARs-LXRs in atherosclerosis.
The commonly prescribed Tangshen Formula (TSF) is a traditional Chinese formulation that has been shown to reduce plasma lipid metabolism and proteinuria and improve the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) in patients with diabetic kidney disease. This study investigated the underlying mechanism whereby TSF regulates renal lipid accumulation and ameliorates diabetic renal injuries in spontaneous diabetic db/db mice and in vitro in sodium palmitate (PA)-stimulated and Abca1-SiRNA-transfected mouse tubular epithelial cells (mTECs). The results revealed that TSF treatment significantly ameliorated the renal injuries by lowering urinary albumin excretion and improving renal tissue injuries in diabetic (db/db) mice. Interestingly, the treatment with TSF also resulted in decreased cholesterol levels in the renal tissues of db/db mice, which was associated with increased expression of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator 1-α (PGC-1α), the Liver X receptors (LXR), and ATP-binding cassette subfamily A member 1 (ABCA1), suggesting that TSF might attenuate diabetic kidney injury via a mechanism associated with improving cholesterol efflux in the diabetic kidney. This was investigated in vitro in mTECs, and the results showed that TSF reduced the PA-stimulated cholesterol accumulation in mTECs. Mechanistically, the addition of TSF was capable of reversing PA-induced downregulation of PGC-1α, LXR, and ABCA1 expression and cholesterol accumulation in mTECs, suggesting that TSF might act the protection via the PGC-1α-LXR-ABCA1 pathway to improve the cholesterol efflux in the renal tissues of db/db mice. This was further confirmed by silencing ABCA1 to block the promotive effect of TSF on cholesterol efflux in vitro. In conclusion, TSF might ameliorate diabetic kidney injuries by promoting ABCA1-mediated renal cholesterol efflux.
Liver X receptors (LXRs), including LXRα and LXRβ isoforms, have been implicated in multiple physiological functions including promoting neurogenesis, improving synaptic plasticity, preventing neurodegeneration, inhibiting inflammation as well as regulating cholesterol metabolism. However, a potential role of LXRs in the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD) has never been investigated previously. Our present results demonstrated that levels of hippocampal LXRβ but not LXRα were down-regulated in rats exposed to chronic unpredictable stress (CUS) and were negatively correlated with the severity of CUS-induced depressive-like behaviors. Furthermore, rats with LXRβ knockdown by short hairpin RNA (shRNA) in hippocampus displayed depressive-like behaviors and impaired hippocampal neurogenesis similar to those observed after CUS exposure. Conversely, LXRs activation by GW3965 (GW), a synthetic dual agonist for both LXRα and LXRβ isoforms, could improve depression-like behaviors and reverse the impaired hippocampal neurogenesis in rats exposed to CUS. LXRβ knockdown by shRNA completely abrogated the antidepressant and hippocampal neurogenesis-promoting effects of GW, suggesting that LXRβ isoform mediated the antidepressant and hippocampal neurogenesis-promoting effects of the LXRα/β dual agonist. However, ablation of hippocampal neurogenesis with x-irradiation only partly but not completely abolished the antidepressant effects of GW in the behavioral tests, implying that the antidepressant effects mediated by LXRβ isoform are likely through both neurogenesis-dependent and -independent pathways. Thus, our findings suggest that LXRβ activation may represent a potential novel target for the treatment of MDD and also provide a novel insight into the underlying mechanisms of MDD.
Preventing postpartum uterine disease depends on the ability of endometrial cells to tolerate the presence of the bacteria that invade the uterus after parturition. Postpartum uterine disease and endometrial pathology in cattle is most associated with the pathogen Trueperella pyogenes. Trueperella pyogenes secretes a cholesterol-dependent cytolysin, pyolysin, which causes cytolysis by forming pores in the plasma membrane of endometrial stromal cells. The aim of the present study was to identify cell-intrinsic pathways that increase bovine endometrial stromal cell tolerance to pyolysin. Pyolysin caused dose-dependent cytolysis of bovine endometrial stromal cells and leakage of lactate dehydrogenase into supernatants. Cell tolerance to pyolysin was increased by inhibitors that target the mevalonate and cholesterol synthesis pathway, but not the mitogen-activated protein kinase, cell cycle, or metabolic pathways. Cellular cholesterol was reduced and cell tolerance to pyolysin was increased by supplying the mevalonate-derived isoprenoid farnesyl pyrophosphate, or by inhibiting farnesyl-diphosphate farnesyltransferase 1 or geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase 1 to increase the abundance of farnesyl pyrophosphate. Supplying the mevalonate-derived isoprenoid geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate also increased cell tolerance to pyolysin, but independent of changes in cellular cholesterol. However, geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate inhibits nuclear receptor subfamily 1 group H receptors (NR1H, also known as Liver X receptors), and reducing the expression of the genes encoding NR1H3 or NR1H2 increased stromal cell tolerance to pyolysin. In conclusion, mevalonate-derived isoprenoids increased bovine endometrial stromal cell tolerance to pyolysin, which was associated with reducing cellular cholesterol and inhibiting NR1H receptors.
CD8+ T cells can be polarized into IL-9-secreting (Tc9) cells. We previously showed that adoptive therapy using tumor-specific Tc9 cells generated stronger antitumor responses in mouse melanoma than classical Tc1 cells. To understand why Tc9 cells exert stronger antitumor responses, we used gene profiling to compare Tc9 and Tc1 cells. Tc9 cells expressed different levels of cholesterol synthesis and efflux genes and possessed significantly lower cholesterol content than Tc1 cells. Unique to Tc9, but not other CD8+ or CD4+ T cell subsets, manipulating cholesterol content in polarizing Tc9 cells significantly affected IL-9 expression and Tc9 differentiation and antitumor response in vivo. Mechanistic studies showed that IL-9 was indispensable for Tc9 cell persistence and antitumor effects, and cholesterol or its derivatives inhibited IL-9 expression by activating liver X receptors (LXRs), leading to LXR Sumoylation and reduced p65 binding to Il9 promoter. Our study identifies cholesterol as a critical regulator of Tc9 cell differentiation and function.
The liver X receptors (LXRs; α/β) are nuclear receptors known to regulate cholesterol homeostasis and the production of select hematopoietic populations. The objective of this study was to determine the importance of LXRs and a high-fat high-cholesterol diet on global hematopoiesis, with special emphasis on endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs), a vasoreparative cell type that is derived from bone marrow hematopoietic stem cells.
Wild-type and LXR double-knockout (Lxrαβ 
                        -/-
                     ) mice were fed a Western diet (WD) to increase plasma cholesterol levels. In WD-fed Lxrαβ 
                        -/-
                     mice, flow cytometry and complete blood cell counts revealed that hematopoietic stem cells, a myeloid progenitor, and mature circulating myeloid cells were increased; EPC numbers were significantly decreased. Hematopoietic stem cells from WD-fed Lxrαβ 
                        -/-
                     mice showed increased cholesterol content, along with increased myeloid colony formation compared with chow-fed mice. In contrast, EPCs from WD-fed Lxrαβ 
                        -/-
                     mice also demonstrated increased cellular cholesterol content that was associated with greater expression of the endothelial lineage markers Cd144 and Vegfr2, suggesting accelerated differentiation of the EPCs. Treatment of human umbilical vein endothelial cells with conditioned medium collected from these EPCs increased THP-1 monocyte adhesion. Increased monocyte adhesion to conditioned medium-treated endothelial cells was recapitulated with conditioned medium from Lxrαβ 
                        -/-
                     EPCs treated with cholesterol ex vivo, suggesting cholesterol is the main component of the WD inducing EPC dysfunction.
LXRs are crucial for maintaining the balance of hematopoietic cells in a hypercholesterolemic environment and for mitigating the negative effects of cholesterol on EPC differentiation/secretome changes that promote monocyte-endothelial adhesion.
Breast cancer​ is one of the most commonly diagnosed cancers in women. Accumulating evidence suggests that cholesterol plays an important role in the development of breast cancer. Even though the mechanistic link between these two factors is not well understood, one possibility is that dysregulated cholesterol metabolism may affect lipid raft and membrane fluidity and can promote tumor development. Current studies have shown oxysterol 27-hydroxycholesterol (27-HC) as a critical regulator of cholesterol and breast cancer pathogenesis. This is supported by the significantly higher expression of CYP27A1 (cytochrome P450, family 27, subfamily A, polypeptide 1) in breast cancers. This enzyme is responsible for 27-HC synthesis from cholesterol. It has been shown that 27-HC can not only increase the proliferation of estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer cells but also stimulate tumor growth and metastasis in several breast cancer models. This phenomenon is surprising since 27-HC and other oxysterols generally reduce intracellular cholesterol levels by activating the liver X receptors (LXRs). Resolving this paradox will elucidate molecular pathways by which cholesterol, ER, and LXR are connected to breast cancer. These findings will also provide the rationale for evaluating pharmaceutical approaches that manipulate cholesterol or 27-HC synthesis in order to mitigate the impact of cholesterol on breast cancer pathophysiology. In addition to cholesterol, epigenetic changes including non-coding RNAs, and microRNAs, DNA methylation, and histone modifications, have all been shown to control tumorigenesis. The purpose of this review is to discuss the link between altered cholesterol metabolism and epigenetic modification during breast cancer progression.
In this issue, Ma et al. (https://doi.org/10.1084/jem.20171576) show that removal of cholesterol from CD8 T cells during type 9 differentiation increases their IL-9 production, persistence in vivo, and cytolytic function against tumors by preventing SUMOylation of liver X receptors.
Oxysterols, oxygenated derivatives of cholesterol, are formed in the human body or ingested. Experimental evidence suggests that due to their diverse functions, e.g. modulating the activity of receptors such as liver X receptors, oxysterol-binding and metabolizing proteins, and several ATP binding cassette transporters, oxysterols may contribute to a number of human disorders including cancer. Genetic variability of oxysterol pathways represents another side of this process, affecting carcinogenesis and cancer progression. This review summarizes information about both the physiological role of oxysterol pathway genes and observed associations between their genetic variability and cancer incidence, progression, and therapy outcome. Besides candidate gene studies, results of genome-wide association studies are presented as well. The survey of available data shows some potential genetic biomarkers that, if clinically validated, may allow the stratification of individuals into genetically defined groups for prediction of individual cancer risk and subsequent screening strategies for early diagnosis.
Loss-of-function in melanocortin 1 receptor (MC1R), a GS protein-coupled receptor that regulates signal transduction through cAMP and protein kinase A (PKA) in melanocytes, is a major inherited melanoma risk factor. Herein, we report a novel cAMP-mediated response for sensing and responding to UV-induced DNA damage regulated by A-kinase-anchoring protein 12 (AKAP12). AKAP12 is identified as a necessary participant in PKA-mediated phosphorylation of ataxia telangiectasia mutated and Rad3-related (ATR) at S435, a post-translational event required for cAMP-enhanced nucleotide excision repair (NER). Moreover, UV exposure promotes ATR-directed phosphorylation of AKAP12 at S732, which promotes nuclear translocation of AKAP12-ATR-pS435. This complex subsequently recruits XPA to UV DNA damage and enhances 5' strand incision. Preventing AKAP12's interaction with PKA or with ATR abrogates ATR-pS435 accumulation, delays recruitment of XPA to UV-damaged DNA, impairs NER and increases UV-induced mutagenesis. Our results define a critical role for AKAP12 as an UV-inducible scaffold for PKA-mediated ATR phosphorylation, and identify a repair complex consisting of AKAP12-ATR-pS435-XPA at photodamage, which is essential for cAMP-enhanced NER.
Repair of oxidative DNA damage, particularly Base Excision Repair (BER), impairment is often associated with Alzheimer's disease pathology. Here, we aimed at investigating the complete Nucleotide Excision Repair (NER), a DNA repair pathway involved in the removal of bulky DNA adducts, status in an Alzheimer-like cell line. The level of DNA damage was quantified using mass spectrometry, NER gene expression was assessed by qPCR, and the NER protein activity was analysed through a modified version of the COMET assay. Interestingly, we found that in the presence of the Amyloid β peptide (Aβ), NER factors were upregulated at the mRNA level and that NER capacities were also specifically increased following oxidative stress. Surprisingly, NER capacities were not differentially improved following a typical NER-triggering of ultraviolet C (UVC) stress. Oxidative stress generates a differential and specific DNA damage response in the presence of Aβ. We hypothesized that the release of NER components such as DNA damage binding protein 2 (DDB2) and Xeroderma Pigmentosum complementation group C protein (XPC) following oxidative stress might putatively involve their apoptotic role rather than DNA repair function. 
Mutations in genes encoding the ERCC3 (XPB), ERCC2 (XPD), and GTF2H5 (p8 or TTD-A) subunits of the transcription and DNA-repair factor TFIIH lead to three autosomal-recessive disorders: xeroderma pigmentosum (XP), XP associated with Cockayne syndrome (XP/CS), and trichothiodystrophy (TTD). Although these diseases were originally associated with defects in DNA repair, transcription deficiencies might be also implicated. By using retinoic acid receptor beta isoform 2 (RARB2) as a model in several cells bearing mutations in genes encoding TFIIH subunits, we observed that (1) the recruitment of the TFIIH complex was altered at the activated RARB2 promoter, (2) TFIIH participated in the recruitment of nucleotide excision repair (NER) factors during transcription in a manner different from that observed during NER, and (3) the different TFIIH variants disturbed transcription by having distinct consequences on post-translational modifications of histones, DNA-break induction, DNA demethylation, and gene-loop formation. The transition from heterochromatin to euchromatin was disrupted depending on the variant, illustrating the fact that TFIIH, by contributing to NER factor recruitment, orchestrates chromatin remodeling. The subtle transcriptional differences found between various TFIIH variants thus participate in the phenotypic variability observed among XP, XP/CS, and TTD individuals. 
Mutations in the XPD subunit of the DNA repair/transcription factor TFIIH result in distinct clinical entities, including the cancer-prone xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) and the multisystem disorder trichothiodystrophy (TTD), which share only cutaneous photosensitivity. Gene-expression profiles of primary dermal fibroblasts revealed overexpression of matrix metalloproteinase 1 (MMP-1), the gene encoding the metalloproteinase that degrades the interstitial collagens of the extracellular matrix (ECM), in TTD patients mutated in XPD compared with their healthy parents. The defect is observed in TTD and not in XP and is specific for fibroblasts, which are the main producers of dermal ECM. MMP-1 transcriptional up-regulation in TTD is caused by an erroneous signaling mediated by retinoic acid receptors on the MMP-1 promoter and leads to hypersecretion of active MMP-1 enzyme and degradation of collagen type I in the ECM of cell/tissue systems and TTD patient skin. In agreement with the well-known role of ECM in eliciting signaling events controlling cell behavior and tissue homeostasis, ECM alterations in TTD were shown to impact on the migration and wound-healing properties of patient dermal fibroblasts. The presence of a specific inhibitor of MMP activity was sufficient to restore normal cell migration, thus providing a potential approach for therapeutic strategies. This study highlights the relevance of ECM anomalies in TTD pathogenesis and in the phenotypic differences between TTD and XP. 
Peripheral neuropathy is one of the major side effects of treatment with the anticancer drug, cisplatin. One proposed mechanism for this neurotoxicity is the formation of platinum adducts in sensory neurons that could contribute to DNA damage. Although this damage is largely repaired by nuclear excision repair (NER), our previous findings suggest that augmenting the base excision repair pathway (BER) by overexpressing the repair protein APE1 protects sensory neurons from cisplatin-induced neurotoxicity. The question remains whether APE1 contributes to the ability of the NER pathway to repair platinum-damage in neuronal cells. To examine this, we manipulated APE1 expression in sensory neuronal cultures and measured Pt-removal after exposure to cisplatin. When neuronal cultures were treated with increasing concentrations of cisplatin for two or three hours, there was a concentration-dependent increase in Pt-damage that peaked at four hours and returned to near baseline levels after 24h. In cultures where APE1 expression was reduced by ∼ 80% using siRNA directed at APE1, there was a significant inhibition of Pt-removal over eight hours which was reversed by overexpressing APE1 using a lentiviral construct for human wtAPE1. Overexpressing a mutant APE1 (C65 APE1), which only has DNA repair activity, but not its other significant redox-signaling function, mimicked the effects of wtAPE1. Overexpressing DNA repair activity mutant APE1 (226 + 177APE1), with only redox activity was ineffective suggesting it is the DNA repair function of APE1 and not its redox-signaling, that restores the Pt-damage removal. Together, these data provide the first evidence that a critical BER enzyme, APE1, helps regulate the NER pathway in the repair of cisplatin damage in sensory neurons.
Better efficacy for predicting the risk of transplantation rejection could be achieved by intergenic interactions among single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) compared with one SNP. In this study, we explored the forewarning function of interactions among SNPs in nucleotide excision repair (NER) genes. Thirty-eight polymorphisms in eight NER genes were genotyped by Sequenom MassARRAY platform, including XPA, XPC, DDB2, XPB (ERCC3), XPD (ERCC2), ERCC1, XPF (ERCC4), and XPG (ERCC5). The haplotype analysis suggested that XPA rs3176629-rs2808668 C-T and ERCC5 G-C-C-T and G-C-T-C (OR = 1.81, 7.72 and 3.46, respectively) increased the risk of transplantation rejection; while ERCC5 rs2094258-rs751402-rs2296147-rs1047768 A-C-T-T decreased the risk (OR = 0.35). Multiple logistic regression and multifactor dimensionality reduction (DMR) analyses consistently revealed intergenic interactions among ERCC2 rs50871, ERCC5 rs1047768, and XPC rs2228001 SNPs for the risk of transplantation rejection. Taken together, the interactions among XPC rs2228001, ERCC2 rs50871 and ERCC5 rs1047768 SNPs were associated with the risk of transplantation rejection.
Estradiol (E2) stimulates luteinizing hormone receptor (lhcgr) expression via nuclear estrogen receptors (nERs) in the zebrafish ovary. We have demonstrated that endocrine hormones such as gonadotropin (hCG) and paracrine factors such as epidermal growth factor (EGF) and pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating peptide (PACAP) can modulate E2-induced lhcgr expression in vitro. These observations raised a question on whether these hormones and factors exert their effects via regulating the expression of nERs. In this study, we first characterized the spatiotemporal expression profiles of three nER subtypes in the zebrafish ovary, including esr1 (ERα), esr2a (ERβ2) and esr2b (ERβ1). All three nERs increased their expression at the pre-vitellogenic stage and peaked at mid- (esr1 and esr2a) or late vitellogenic (esr2b) stage, followed by a significant decline at the full-grown stage. RT-PCR analysis showed that esr1 and esr2b were exclusively expressed in the follicle layer while esr2a was expressed in both compartments. We then examined how E2, hCG, PACAP and EGF regulated the expression of nERs in cultured zebrafish follicle cells. E2 quickly increased esr1 but reduced esr2a and esr2b expression from 1.5 to 12h of treatment. Similarly, EGF down-regulated esr2a significantly at 1.5h and this effect was further intensified at 24h. hCG decreased the expression of all three nER subtypes with similar potency throughout the 24-h time-course. Interestingly, PACAP exerted a biphasic regulation on esr2a. Our present study suggests that nERs, especially esr2a, provide potential target points for other hormones and factors to modulate E2 activity during folliculogenesis in the zebrafish.
Polymorphisms in nucleotide excision repair (NER) pathway genes are associated with the risk of breast cancer, but the relevance of these associations appeared to vary according to the ethnicity of the subjects. To systemically evaluate the potential associations between NER polymorphisms and breast cancer risk in a Chinese population, we carried out a case-control study on 450 breast cancer patients and 430 healthy controls. Sequenom MassARRAY was used for genotyping, and immunohistochemistry was performed to detect estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER-2) expression in tumor tissue. Our results showed that ERCC1 rs11615 (additive model: ORadjusted: 1.36, 95% CI: 1.08-1.71, p = 0.009), XPC rs2228000 (additive model: ORadjusted: 1.39, 95% CI: 1.13-1.72, p = 0.002) and ERCC2/XPD rs50872 (additive model: ORadjusted: 1.32, 95% CI: 1.04-1.67, p = 0.021) were associated with an increased risk of breast cancer. Stratified analysis revealed three polymorphisms (rs11615, rs1800975, and rs50872) to be associated with breast cancer in menopausal females. Three polymorphisms were associated with specific breast cancer grades (rs11615 with grade 3, rs2228000 and rs50872 with grade 1-2). Two polymorphisms (rs2228001 and rs50872) were associated with the risk of breast cancer with negative lymph node involvement. rs1800975 and rs50872 were associated with the risk of ER- and PR- breast cancer, whereas rs11615 was associated with the risk of ER+ and PR+ breast cancer. We found that carriers of the T allele of ERCC1 rs11615, XPC rs2228000 and rs50872, particularly in postmenopausal females, have an increased risk of breast cancer.
Estrogens play pivotal roles in hippocampal synaptic plasticity through nuclear receptors (nERs; including ERα and ERβ) and the membrane receptor (mER; also called GPR30), but the underlying mechanism and the contributions of nERs and mER remain unclear. Mammalian target of rapamycin complex 2 (mTORC2) is involved in actin cytoskeleton polymerization and long-term memory, but whether mTORC2 is involved in the regulation of hippocampal synaptic plasticity by ERs is unclear.
We treated animals with nER antagonists (MPP/PHTPP) or the mER antagonist (G15) alone or in combination with A-443654, an activator of mTORC2. Then, we examined the changes in hippocampal SRC-1 expression, mTORC2 signaling (rictor and phospho-AKTSer473), actin polymerization (phospho-cofilin and profilin-1), synaptic protein expression (GluR1, PSD95, spinophilin, and synaptophysin), CA1 spine density, and synapse density.
All of the examined parameters except synaptophysin expression were significantly decreased by MPP/PHTPP and G15 treatment. MPP/PHTPP and G15 induced a similar decrease in most parameters except p-cofilin, GluR1, and spinophilin expression. The ER antagonist-induced decreases in these parameters were significantly reversed by mTORC2 activation, except for the change in SRC-1, rictor, and synaptophysin expression.
nERs and mER contribute similarly to the changes in proteins and structures associated with synaptic plasticity, and mTORC2 may be a novel target of hippocampal-dependent dementia such as Alzheimer's disease as proposed by previous studies.
Estrogens signal through both nuclear and membrane receptors with most reported effects being mediated via the nuclear estrogen receptors (nERs). Although much work has been reported on nERs in the zebrafish, there is a lack of direct genetic evidence for their functional roles and importance in reproduction. To address this issue, we undertook this study to disrupt all three nERs in the zebrafish, namely esr1 (ERα), esr2a (ERβII), and esr2b (ERβI), by the genome-editing technology clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats and its associated nuclease (CRISPR/Cas9). Using this loss-of-function genetic approach, we successfully created three mutant zebrafish lines with each nER knocked out. In addition, we also generated all possible double and triple knockouts of the three nERs. The phenotypes of these mutants in reproduction were analyzed in all single, double, and triple nER knockouts in both females and males. Surprisingly, all three single nER mutant fish lines display normal reproductive development and function in both females and males, suggesting functional redundancy among these nERs. Further analysis of double and triple knockouts showed that nERs, especially Esr2a and Esr2b, were essential for female reproduction, and loss of these two nERs led to an arrest of folliculogenesis at previtellogenic stage II followed by sex reversal from female to male. In addition, the current study also revealed a unique role for Esr2a in follicle cell proliferation and transdifferentiation, follicle growth, and chorion formation. Taken together, this study provides the most comprehensive genetic analysis for differential functions of esr1, esr2a, and esr2b in fish reproduction.
Sjögren's syndrome (SS) is an autoimmune disease that often results in diminished exocrine gland function. SS patients also experience systemic disease manifestations, including hypergammaglobulinemia and pulmonary and renal pathoses. MyD88 is a ubiquitously expressed adaptor molecule used by all immune cells that is required for IL-1 receptor (IL-1R), IL-18R, and most TLR signaling. The precise role of MyD88 in SS has not been evaluated, although this adaptor is critical for development of lupus, a related autoimmune disease. This study tested the hypothesis that Myd88-mediated signaling is required for local and systemic SS manifestations. To this end, we generated NOD.B10Sn-H2b /J (NOD.B10) mice that are deficient in Myd88 (NOD.B10 
                        Myd88-/-
                     ). We found that NOD.B10 animals that lack Myd88 show reduced exocrine and extraglandular inflammation. Moreover, these animals are protected from loss of salivary flow. Splenocytes from NOD.B10 
                        Myd88-/-
                     mice did not up-regulate activation markers or secrete IL-6 in response to a Myd88-dependent agonist, although BCR signaling remained intact. Finally, IgM, IgG, and anti-nuclear autoantibodies were reduced in NOD.B10 
                        Myd88-/-
                     mice compared with the parental strain. These data demonstrate that Myd88 is a crucial mediator of local and systemic SS disease manifestations.
Stress, injury, and disease trigger glucocorticoid (GC) elevation. Elevated GCs bind to the ubiquitously expressed glucocorticoid receptor (GR). While GRs are in every cell in the nervous system, the expression level varies, suggesting that diverse cell types react differently to GR activation. Stress/GCs induce structural plasticity in neurons, Schwann cells, microglia, oligodendrocytes, and astrocytes as well as affect neurotransmission by changing the release and reuptake of glutamate. While general nervous system plasticity is essential for adaptation and learning and memory, stress-induced plasticity is often maladaptive and contributes to neuropsychiatric disorders and neuropathic pain. In this brief review, we describe the evidence that stress/GCs activate GR to promote cell type-specific changes in cellular plasticity throughout the nervous system.
Glucocorticoids play a fundamental role in many physiologic functions and contribute substantially to the achievement of homeostasis. These pleiotropic glucocorticoid actions are mediated by a ubiquitously expressed transcription factor, the human glucocorticoid receptor (hGR), which may influence the transcription rate of numerous target genes, interact with other transcription factors, trigger the activation of several kinase pathways or modulate mitochondrial DNA expression. Any genetic defects in the NR3C1gene that encodes the hGR may cause Primary Generalized Glucocorticoid Resistance or Hypersensitivity Syndromes, two rare allostatic endocrinologic conditions characterized by partial impaired tissue sensitivity to glucocorticoids. However, there are patients who present with clinical manifestations suggestive of the above syndromes and do not harbor an inactivating or activating point mutation, insertion or deletion in the NR3C1gene. In these cases, several other factors might influence the glucocorticoid signal transduction. In this review, we discuss the numerous glucocorticoid functions and the multiple hGR isoforms, we present the genomic, nongenomic and mitochondrial glucocorticoid signaling cascade and we summarize the clinical manifestations and pathogenesis of Primary Generalized Glucocorticoid Resistance or Hypersensitivity Syndromes. Finally, we speculate that the next generation sequencing technologies will undoubtedly enable us to gain a deeper understanding of the GR "interactome".
Programmed death-1 receptor (PD-1) expressed in many immune cells is known to trigger T-cell exhaustion but the significance of macrophage-associated PD-1 in relevance to macrophage apoptosis is not known. This study is aimed to delineate whether PD-1 pathway has any role in eliciting macrophage apoptosis and, if so, then how the intra-macrophage parasite, Leishmania donovani modulates PD-1 pathway for protecting its niche. Resting macrophages when treated with H2O2 showed increased PD-1 expression and apoptosis, which was further enhanced on PD-1 agonist treatment. The administration of either PD-1 receptor or PD-1 ligand-blocking antibodies reversed the process thus documenting the involvement of PD-1 in macrophage apoptosis. On the contrary, L. donovani-infected macrophages showed decreased PD-1 expression concurrent with inhibition of apoptosis. The activation of PD-1 pathway was found to negatively regulate the phosphorylation of pro-survival AKT, which was reversed during infection. Infection-induced PD-1 downregulation led to the activation of AKT resulting in phosphorylation and subsequent inhibition of proapoptotic protein BAD. Strong association of SHP2 (a SH2-containing ubiquitously expressed tyrosine-specific protein phosphatase) with PD-1 along with AKT deactivation observed in H2O2-treated macrophages was reversed by L. donovani infection. Kinetic analysis coupled with inhibitor-based approach and knockdown experiments demonstrated that L. donovani infection actively downregulated the PD-1 by deactivating NFATc1 as revealed by its reduced nuclear translocation. The study thus elucidates the detailed mechanism of the role of PD-1 in macrophage apoptosis and its negative modulation by Leishmania for their intracellular survival.
Lipid metabolism dysregulation underlies chronic pathologies such as obesity, diabetes and cancer. Besides their role in structure and energy storage, lipids are also important signalling molecules regulating multiple biological functions. Thus, understanding the precise lipid metabolism enzymatic steps that are altered in some pathological conditions is helpful for designing better treatment strategies. Several monoacylglycerol (MAG) species are only recently being recognized as signalling lipid molecules in different tissues. Recent studies indicated the importance of the ubiquitously expressed serine hydrolase α/β-hydrolase domain 6 (ABHD6), which is a MAG hydrolase, in regulating signalling competent MAG in both central and peripheral tissues. The central and peripheral function of the endocannabinoid 2-arachidonoylglycerol, which is a 2-MAG, and its breakdown by both ABHD6 and classical MAG lipase has been well documented. ABHD6 and its substrate MAG appear to be involved in the regulation of various physiological and pathological processes including insulin secretion, adipose browning, food intake, neurotransmission, autoimmune disorders, neurological and metabolic diseases as well as cancer. Diverse cellular targets such as mammalian unc13-1 (Munc13-1), PPARs, GPR119 and CB1/2 receptors, for MAG-mediated signalling processes have been proposed in different cell types. The purpose of this review is to provide a comprehensive summary of the current state of knowledge regarding ABHD6/MAG signalling and its possible therapeutic implications.
Interleukin (IL)-1-type cytokines including IL-1α, IL-1β and interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra) are among the most potent molecules of the innate immune system and exert biological activities through the ubiquitously expressed interleukin-1 receptor type 1 (IL-1R1). The role of IL-1R1 in hepatocytes during acute liver failure (ALF) remains undetermined.
The role of IL-1R1 during ALF was investigated using a novel transgenic mouse model exhibiting deletion of all signaling-capable IL-1R isoforms in hepatocytes (Il1r1Hep-/-).
ALF induced by D-galactosamine (D-GalN) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was significantly attenuated in Il1r1Hep-/- mice leading to reduced mortality. Conditional deletion of Il1r1 decreased activation of injurious c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK)/c-Jun signaling, activated nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) p65, inhibited extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and prevented caspase 3-mediated apoptosis. Moreover, Il1r1Hep-/- mice exhibited reduced local and systemic inflammatory cytokine and chemokine levels, especially TNF-α, IL-1α/β, IL-6, CC-chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2), C-X-C motif ligand 1 (CXCL-1) and CXCL-2, and a reduced neutrophil recruitment into the hepatic tissue in response to injury. NLRP3 inflammasome expression and caspase 1 activation were suppressed in the absence of the hepatocellular IL-1R1. Inhibition of IL-1R1 using IL-1ra (anakinra) attenuated the severity of liver injury, while IL-1α administration exaggerated it. These effects were lost ex vivo and at later time points, supporting a role of IL-1R1 in inflammatory signal amplification during acute liver injury.
IL-1R1 in hepatocytes plays a pivotal role in an IL-1-driven auto-amplification of cell death and inflammation in the onset of ALF.
Acute liver injury which can cause lethal liver failure is medicated by a class of proteins called cytokines. Among these, interleukin-1 (IL-1) and the corresponding receptor IL-1R1 play a prominent role in the immune system, but their role in the liver is undetermined. In the current study, a novel mouse model with defective IL-1R1 in liver cells was studied. Mice lacking this receptor in liver cells were protected from cell death to a certain extent. This protection occurred only in the presence of other, neighboring cells, arguing for the involvement of proteins derived from these cells. This effect is called paracrine signaling and the current study has for the first time shown that the IL-1R1 receptor on hepatocytes is involved in acute liver failure in this context. The approved drug anakinra - which blocks IL-1R1 - had the same effect, supporting the proposed mechanism of action. The findings of this study suggest new treatment options for patients with acute liver failure by blocking defined signals of the immune system.
Peroxisome proliferator activated receptor-alpha (PPARα) is a ubiquitously expressed nuclear receptor. The role of endogenous PPARα in retinal neuronal homeostasis is unknown. Retinal photoreceptors are the highest energy-consuming cells in the body, requiring abundant energy substrates. PPARα is a known regulator of lipid metabolism, and we hypothesized that it may regulate lipid use for oxidative phosphorylation in energetically demanding retinal neurons.
We found that endogenous PPARα is essential for the maintenance and survival of retinal neurons, with Pparα -/- mice developing retinal degeneration first detected at 8 weeks of age. Using extracellular flux analysis, we identified that PPARα mediates retinal utilization of lipids as an energy substrate, and that ablation of PPARα ultimately results in retinal bioenergetic deficiency and neurodegeneration. This may be due to PPARα regulation of lipid transporters, which facilitate the internalization of fatty acids into cell membranes and mitochondria for oxidation and ATP production.
We identify an endogenous role for PPARα in retinal neuronal survival and lipid metabolism, and furthermore underscore the importance of fatty acid oxidation in photoreceptor survival. We also suggest PPARα as a putative therapeutic target for age-related macular degeneration, which may be due in part to decreased mitochondrial efficiency and subsequent energetic deficits.
Upon infection, the immune system produces inflammatory mediators important for pathogen clearance. However, inflammation can also have deleterious effect on the host and is tightly regulated. Immune system-derived cytokines stimulate the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, triggering endogenous glucocorticoid production. Through interaction with ubiquitously expressed glucocorticoid receptors (GRs), this steroid hormone has pleiotropic effects on many cell types. Using a genetic mouse model in which the gene encoding the GR is selectively deleted in NKp46+ innate lymphoid cells (ILCs), we demonstrated a major role for the HPA pathway in host resistance to endotoxin-induced septic shock. GR expression in group 1 ILCs is required to limit their IFN-γ production, thereby allowing the development of IL-10-dependent tolerance to endotoxin. These findings suggest that neuroendocrine axes are crucial for tolerization of the innate immune system to microbial endotoxin exposure through direct corticosterone-mediated effects on NKp46-expressing innate cells, revealing a novel strategy of host protection from immunopathology.
Myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88) is an adaptor protein involved in the interleukin-1 receptor and Toll-like receptor-induced activation of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB). In this study a novel isoform of MyD88 in Sepiella japonica (SjMyD88) was cloned and functionally characterized (GenBank accession no. AQY56781.1). The complete cDNA sequence of SjMyD88 was 1912 bp and contained a 1017 bp open reading frame encoding 338 amino acid residues, which was similar to its mollusk orthologues in the length. BLASTp analysis suggested the deduced amino acids sequence of SjMyD88 shared high identity to the known MyD88, for instance, 64% identity with Octopus bimaculoides. Sequence analysis revealed two conserved domains, the N-terminal DD and the C-terminal TIR domain appeared in SjMyD88, which was consistent with MyD88 proteins from other species. The fusion expression of SjMyD88 and green fluorescent protein (EGFP) in HEK293 cells was conducted and cytoplasm localization was detected. Meanwhile, the TIR-pmCherry fusion protein showed red fluorescence and mainly distributed in the cytoplasm. After cotransfection MyD88-EGFP and TIR-pmCherry red obviously overlapped and changed to yellowish green. The results suggested that there was the interaction between homologous TIR-pmcherry and MyD88-EGFP. Tissues expression profiles analysis showed that SjMyD88 ubiquitously expressed in all tested tissues with the highest expression in the gills and livers except reproductive related tissue, and it was significantly induced in livers under LPS stress. These data provide insight into the roles of SjMyD88 in the TLR signaling pathway of S. japonica in response to pathogenic bacteria.
Nuclear receptor binding protein 1 (NRBP1) is a ubiquitously expressed and highly conserved pseudokinase that has important roles in cellular homoeostasis. Despite recent advances in understanding the biology of NRBP1, the role of NRBP1 and its underlying mechanism in colorectal cancer (CRC) have not been fully elucidated. In the present study, we observed that NRBP1 expression levels were significantly reduced in CRC tissues compared with corresponding adjacent normal tissues, and high NRBP1 expression correlated with better prognosis in CRC. Overexpression of NRBP1 inhibited CRC cell proliferation and promoted apoptosis in vitro and in vivo. In contrast, knockdown of NRBP1 expression increased cell proliferation and decreased the percentage of apoptotic cells. Moreover, overexpression of NRBP1 activated caspase-dependent intrinsic apoptosis. In addition, we further discovered that NRBP1 regulated the apoptotic pathway through interaction with JNK. Finally, NRBP1 overexpression led to attenuated CRC growth in a xenograft mouse model. Our study illustrates the suppressor role of NRBP1 in CRC and provides a potential therapeutic target.
Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) are not a homogenous population but comprehend several cell types, such as stem cells, progenitor cells, fibroblasts, and other types of cells. Among these is a population of pluripotent stem cells, which represent around 1-3% of MSCs. These cells, named multilineage-differentiating stress enduring (Muse) cells, are stress-tolerant cells. Stem cells may undergo several rounds of intrinsic and extrinsic stresses due to their long life and must have a robust and effective DNA damage checkpoint and DNA repair mechanism, which, following a genotoxic episode, promote the complete recovery of cells rather than triggering senescence and/or apoptosis. We evaluated how Muse cells can cope with DNA damaging stress in comparison with MSCs. We found that Muse cells were resistant to chemical and physical genotoxic stresses better than non-Muse cells. Indeed, the level of senescence and apoptosis was lower in Muse cells. Our results proved that the DNA damage repair system (DDR) was properly activated following injury in Muse cells. While in non-Muse cells some anomalies may have occurred because, in some cases, the activation of the DDR persisted by 48 hr post damage, in others no activation took place. In Muse cells, the non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) enzymatic activity increases compared to other cells, while single-strand repair activity (NER, BER) does not. In conclusion, the high ability of Muse cells to cope with genotoxic stress is related to their quick and efficient sensing of DNA damage and activation of DNA repair systems.
Rap1 interacting factor 1 (RIF1) was deemed to be involved in replication timing regulation and DNA damage response. However, little is known about the role of RIF1 in malignancies. Thus, this study aimed to investigate whether the expression of RIF1 is relevant to the response of epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) patients to cisplatin chemotherapy and its underlying mechanism.
Immunohistochemistry was used for detecting the expression of RIF1 in 72 human ovarian cancer tissues followed by association analysis of RIF1 expression with patients' responses to platinum-based chemotherapy. The survival analysis of ovarian patients based on platinum chemotherapy was analyzed using online databases. RNA interference of RIF1 was carried out in OVCAR3 and A2780 cell lines, to determine the effect of lacking RIF1 expression on cellular responses to cisplatin by using MTS assay. The nucleotide excision repair (NER) capacity of these cells was assessed by using host-cell reactivation and UV sensitivity assay. Western Blot analysis was carried out to determine the effect of RIF1 on the proteins of NER and apoptosis signaling pathway by using RIF1 knockdown cells. BALB/c nude mice model was used for detection of response to cisplatin in vivo.
RIF1 expression was significantly associated with the response of ovarian patients to platinum-based chemotherapy (P&lt; 0.01). In cohorts from online databases, high expression of RIF1 was associated with higher mortality of EOC patients based on platinum chemotherapy (P &lt; 0.01). RIF1 knockdown increased sensitivity to cisplatin in EOC in vitro and in vivo. Deletion of RIF1 impaired the NER activity by inhibiting the NER proteins in ovarian cancer cells. Besides, knockdown of RIF1 enhanced cisplatin-induced apoptosis.
RIF1 plays an important role in regulating the expression of NER proteins, which in turn contributes to cellular response to cisplatin and EOC patients' response to platinum-based chemotherapy. RIF1 knockdown also promotes cisplatin-induced apoptosis. RIF1 may serve as a novel biomarker for predicting platinum-based chemosensitivity and the prognosis of EOC patients.
The DNA excision repair protein ERCC-1-DNA repair endonuclease XPF (ERCC1-XPF) is a heterodimeric endonuclease essential for the nucleotide excision repair (NER) DNA repair pathway. Although its activity is required to maintain genome integrity in healthy cells, ERCC1-XPF can counteract the effect of DNA-damaging therapies such as platinum-based chemotherapy in cancer cells. Therefore, a promising approach to enhance the effect of these therapies is to combine their use with small molecules, which can inhibit the repair mechanisms in cancer cells. Currently, there are no structures available for the catalytic site of the human ERCC1-XPF, which performs the metal-mediated cleavage of a DNA damaged strand at 5&amp;prime;. We adopted a homology modeling strategy to build a structural model of the human XPF nuclease domain which contained the active site and to extract dominant conformations of the domain using molecular dynamics simulations followed by clustering of the trajectory. We investigated the binding modes of known small molecule inhibitors targeting the active site to build a pharmacophore model. We then performed a virtual screening of the ZINC Is Not Commercial 15 (ZINC15) database to identify new ERCC1-XPF endonuclease inhibitors. Our work provides structural insights regarding the binding mode of small molecules targeting the ERCC1-XPF active site that can be used to rationally optimize such compounds. We also propose a set of new potential DNA repair inhibitors to be considered for combination cancer therapy strategies.
A prevailing way of extracting valuable information from biomedical literature is to apply text mining methods on unstructured texts. However, the massive amount of literature that needs to be analyzed poses a big data challenge to the processing efficiency of text mining. In this paper, we address this challenge by introducing parallel processing on a supercomputer. We developed paraBTM, a runnable framework that enables parallel text mining on the Tianhe-2 supercomputer. It employs a low-cost yet effective load balancing strategy to maximize the efficiency of parallel processing. We evaluated the performance of paraBTM on several datasets, utilizing three types of named entity recognition tasks as demonstration. Results show that, in most cases, the processing efficiency can be greatly improved with parallel processing, and the proposed load balancing strategy is simple and effective. In addition, our framework can be readily applied to other tasks of biomedical text mining besides NER.
Recognition of biomedical named entities in the textual literature is a highly challenging research topic with great interest, playing as the prerequisite for extracting huge amount of high-valued bio-medical knowledge deposited in unstructured text and transforming them into well-structured formats. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks have recently been employed in various biomedical named entity recognition (NER) models with great success. They, however, often did not take advantages of all useful linguistic information and still have many aspects to be further improved for better performance.
We propose D3NER, a novel biomedical named entity recognition (NER) using conditional random fields and bidirectional long short-term memory improved with fine-tuned embeddings of various linguistic information. D3NER is thoroughly compared with seven very recent state-of-the-art NER models, of which two are even joint models with named entity normalization (NEN), which was proven to bring performance improvements to NER. Experimental results on benchmark datasets, i.e. the BioCreative V Chemical Disease Relation (BC5 CDR), the NCBI Disease, and the FSU-PRGE gene/protein corpus, demonstrate the out-performance and stability of D3NER over all compared models for chemical, gene/protein NER and over all models (without NEN jointed, as D3NER) for disease NER, in almost all cases. On the BC5 CDR corpus, D3NER achieves F1 of 93:14% and 84:68% for the chemical and disease NER, respectively; while on the NCBI Disease corpus, its F1 for the disease NER is 84:41%. Its F1 for the gene/protein NER on FSU-PRGE is 87:62%.

There has long been a fascination in the DNA Repair pathways of archaea, for two main reasons. Firstly, many archaea inhabit extreme environments where the rate of physical damage to DNA is accelerated. These archaea might reasonably be expected to have particularly robust or novel DNA repair pathways to cope with this. Secondly, the archaea have long been understood to be a lineage distinct from the bacteria, and to share a close relationship with the eukarya, particularly in their information processing systems. Recent discoveries suggest the eukarya arose from within the archaeal domain, and in particular from lineages related to the TACK superphylum and Lokiarchaea. Thus, archaeal DNA repair proteins and pathways can represent a useful model system. This review focuses on recent advances in our understanding of archaeal DNA repair processes including Base Excision Repair (BER), Nucleotide Excision Repair (NER), Mismatch Repair (MMR) and Double Strand Break Repair (DSBR). These advances are discussed in the context of the emerging picture of the evolution and relationship of the three domains of life.
All active living organisms mitigate DNA damage via DNA repair, and the so-called nucleotide excision repair pathway (NER) represents a functionally major part of the cell's DNA repair repertoire [1]. In this pathway, the damaged strand of DNA is incised and removed before being resynthesized. This form of DNA repair requires a multitude of proteins working in a complex choreography. Repair thus typically involves detection of a DNA lesion; validation of that detection event; search for an appropriate incision site and subsequent DNA incision; DNA unwinding/removal; and DNA resynthesis and religation. These activities are ultimately the result of molecules randomly diffusing and bumping into each other and acting in succession. It is also true however that repair components are often assembled into functional complexes which may be more efficient or regular in their mode of action. Studying DNA repair complexes for their mechanisms of assembly, action, and disassembly can help address fundamental questions such as whether DNA repair pathways are branched or linear; whether for instance they tolerate fluctuations in numbers of components; and more broadly how search processes between macromolecules take place or can be enhanced.
At the time of spring pre-emergent herbicide application, the soil surface in conservation agriculture is most of the time covered by cover crops (CC) mulches. The state of these mulches depends on their destruction date and on the selected species. Sorption and degradation of 14C-S-metolachlor on and within 8 decaying CC-covered (2 species × 4 initial decomposition state) soils corresponding to conservation agriculture were compared to its fate in bare soil (BS) corresponding to conventional agriculture. 14C-S-metolachlor and its metabolites distribution between mineralized, extractable and non-extractable (NER) fractions was determined at 5 dates during a 20 °C/84-d period. Herbicide mineralization was weak (&lt;2%) for both CC and BS. Extractability of 14C in BS was intermediate between CC that were decomposed 28 or 56 days and 0 or 6 days before application. Degradates consisted in up to 43% of total radioactivity, with specificities according to the CC or soil compartment. NER formation was equivalent in BS and in the much decomposed CC-amended microcosms, and was stronger in less decomposed CC. S-metolachlor DT50 was 23-d in BS, and 9, 15, 39 and 25-d for CC ordered by increased decomposition state at the time of application. These results were attributed to the proportion of 14C intercepted by CC, and to higher levels of organic matter and microbial activity in less decomposed CC as compared with more decomposed ones. Then the state of decomposition level of CC residues determines the behaviour of SMOC (S-metolachlor) sprayed on the mulch in the conditions of conservation agriculture.
Ultraviolet (UV) induces distorting lesions to the DNA that can lead to stalling of the RNA polymerase II (RNAP II) and that are removed by transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair (TC-NER). In humans, mutations in the TC-NER genes CSA and CSB lead to severe postnatal developmental defects in Cockayne syndrome patients. In Caenorhabditis elegans, mutations in the TC-NER genes csa-1 and csb-1, lead to developmental growth arrest upon UV treatment. We conducted a genetic suppressor screen in the nematode to identify mutations that could suppress the developmental defects in csb-1 mutants. We found that mutations in the ERK1/2 MAP kinase mpk-1 alleviate the developmental retardation in TC-NER mutants, while constitutive activation of the RAS-MAPK pathway exacerbates the DNA damage-induced growth arrest. We show that MPK-1 act via insulin/insulin-like signaling pathway and regulates the FOXO transcription factor DAF-16 to mediate the developmental DNA damage response.
Resistance to platinum-based chemotherapy becomes a major obstacle in lung cancer treatment. Compensatory activation of nucleotide excision repair (NER) pathway is the major mechanism accounting for cisplatin-resistance. We aimed at identifying additional regulators in NER-mediated chemoresistance in a hypoxic setting induced by sodium glycididazole (CMNa)-sensitized cisplatin chemotherapy of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
We performed an RNA-sequencing (RNA-Seq) analysis to identify the genes whose expression had been differentially regulated in NER-deficient cells that had been treated by cisplatin/CMNa. DNA damage, apoptosis, and correlational analysis between the differentially expressed gene and drug sensitivity were determined by Western blots, flow cytometry and Oncomine expression analysis.
The stress response gene, NDRG1 (N-Myc downstream-regulated gene 1), was among the differentially expressed genes in NER-deficient cells upon treatment of cisplatin/CMNa. Downregulation of NDRG1 by ERCC1 (excision repair cross-complementing 1) could be a prevalent mechanism for drug resistance. Furthermore, lower NDRG1 level is observed in human lung cancer cells showing chemotherapeutic drug resistance compared with the drug-sensitive cells.
NDRG1 is an important modulator linking DNA damage response and hypoxia-related cellular stress response during the development of drug resistance to cisplatin/CMNa in lung cancer. Targeting both NDRG1 and ERCC1 may be a viable strategy for overcoming drug resistance in cancer therapy, and has significant clinical implications.
Twelve patients with reflex sympathetic dystrophy were referred to a comprehensive orthopaedic rehabilitation center after failure of conservative management. Ten underwent amputation of the affected limb and, although functional improvement occurred in the patients undergoing lower limb amputation, psychosocial dysfunction persisted. All the patients required psychological support. In cases of post-Sudeck amputation, early orthopaedic diagnosis and referral to a comprehensive treatment center are recommended. In the 12 cases described here, apart from the obvious limb pathology, severe psychological inadequacies were found to be present.
Recent reports suggest that oestrogen receptors detected in the cytosolic fraction of homogenized human breast tumours might be mainly nuclear receptor released into the cytoplasm during tissue processing. This study thus compares the tumour content of steroid hormone receptors in conventional cytosolic receptor assays with direct measurements of receptor in the cell nucleus. Unoccupied cytoplasmic oestrogen receptors (cER), cytoplasmic progesterone receptors (cPR) and total (occupied plus unoccupied) nuclear oestrogen receptors (nER) have been measured in parallel in human breast tumour tissue using biochemical radioreceptor assay. Of 125 tumours, 62% and 61% were positive for cER and cPR, respectively, 50% contained nER with high affinity for oestradiol (nER I) and 13% expressed nER with low affinity for oestradiol (nER II). The concentration of cER correlated significantly with age, cPR and log nER I. A significant proportion of tumours which were positive for both cytosol receptors also possessed nuclear receptors with high and low affinity for oestrogen. It is possible that this group of tumours which are positive for cER, cPR, nER I and nER II will respond well to hormone therapy.
NER, a new member of the steroid hormone nuclear receptor (NR)-encoding gene family, was isolated from a human osteosarcoma SAOS/B10 cell line cDNA library. NER codes for a polypeptide of 461 amino acids which contains the conserved sequences of the DNA-binding and ligand-binding domains of typical steroid hormone NR. It has highest homology with the retinoic acid receptors: 55% at the DNA-binding domain and 38-40% at the ligand-binding domain. A single transcript of 2.3 kb was detected in all cells and tissues tested. Although no ligand was identified for NER-I, its wide distribution may indicate that this novel steroid hormone NR may play a basic role in cell function.
Nucleotide excision repair (NER) removes many different types of DNA lesions. Most NER proteins are indispensable for repair. In contrast, the yeast Rad23 represents a class of accessory NER proteins, without which NER activity is reduced but not eliminated. In mammals, the complex of HR23B (Rad23 homolog) and XPC (yeast Rad4 homolog) has been suggested to function in the damage recognition step of NER. However, the precise function of Rad23 or HR23B in NER remains unknown. Recently, it was suggested that the primary function of RAD23 protein in NER is its stabilization of XPC protein. Here, we tested the significance of Rad23-mediated Rad4 stabilization in NER, and analyzed the repair and biochemical activities of purified yeast Rad23 protein. Cellular Rad4 was indeed stabilized by Rad23 in the absence of DNA damage. Persistent overexpression of Rad4 in rad23 mutant cells, however, largely failed to complement the ultraviolet sensitivity of the mutant. Consistently, deficient NER in rad23 mutant cell extracts could not be complemented by purified Rad4 protein in vitro. In contrast, partial complementation was observed with purified Rad23 protein. Specific complementation to the level of wild-type repair was achieved by adding purified Rad23 together with small amounts of Rad4 protein to rad23 mutant cell extracts. Purified Rad23 protein was unable to bind to DNA, but stimulated the binding activity of purified Rad4 protein to N-acetyl-2-aminofluorene-damaged DNA. These results support two roles of Rad23 protein in NER: (i) its direct participation in the repair biochemistry, possibly due to its stimulatory activity on Rad4-mediated damage binding/recognition; and (ii) its stabilization of cellular Rad4 protein.
The seven transmembrane G protein-coupled receptor EBV-induced gene 2 (EBI2), also known as GPR183, is expressed in particular in immune cells. Activated by its endogenous ligands, which are a group of oxysterols, it functions as a chemo-attractant receptor, mediating cell migration. In coordination with other receptors, EBI2 plays important roles in controlling the migration of immune cells during the course of a T-dependent Ab response in the spleen. In recent years, it has become clear that EBI2 also has other roles to play in the immune system. Thus, EBI2 seems to be involved in innate immune responses, such as those mediated by TLR signaling, and it has been implicated in regional immune responses, including immune responses in the CNS. In this review, we describe the functions of EBI2 in B cells, T cells, and dendritic cells during the course of a T-dependent Ab response in the spleen. Furthermore, we review the existing evidence supporting a role for EBI2 in local immune responses and in autoimmune diseases, with a special focus on immune responses in the CNS. Finally, we discuss which type of role EBI2 may play in autoimmune diseases, and we give our opinion about the paths of future research in EBI2.
Dyslipidaemia and hyperglycaemia are associated with ovarian failure and both have been related to hypothyroidism. Hypothyroidism promotes anovulation and ovarian cysts in women and reduces the size of follicles and the expression of aromatase in the ovary of rabbits. Considering that ovarian steroidogenesis and ovulation depend on lipid metabolism and signalling, the aim of the present study was to analyse the effect of hypothyroidism on the lipid content and expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) δ in the ovary. Ovaries from female rabbits belonging to the control (n=7) and hypothyroid (n=7) groups were processed to measure total cholesterol (TC), triacylglycerol (TAG) and glycogen content, as well as to determine the presence of granules containing oxidized lipids (oxysterols and lipofuscin) and the relative expression of perilipin A (PLIN-A) and PPARδ. Hypothyroidism increased TC and glycogen content, but reduced TAG content in the ovary. This was accompanied by a reduction in the expression of PLIN-A in total and cytosolic extracts, changes in the presence of granules containing oxidative lipids and low PPARδ expression. The results of the present study suggest that hypothyroidism modifies the content and signalling of lipids in the ovary, possibly affecting follicle maturation. These results could improve our understanding of the association between hypothyroidism and infertility in females.
Oxidized cholesterol derivatives are thought to exert atherogenic effect thus adversely affecting vascular endothelium. The aim of the study was to assess the effect of 5α,6α-epoxycholesterol on experimentally induced hypercholesterolemia in rabbits, and the levels of homocysteine (HCY), asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA), paraoxonase-1 (PON-1), and inflammatory parameters (IL-6, TNF-α, CRP).
The rabbits were divided into 3 groups, 8 animals each, and fed with basic fodder (C), basic fodder plus cholesterol (Ch) or basic fodder plus 5α,6α-epoxycholesterol, and unoxidized cholesterol (ECh). Serum concentrations of studied parameters were determined at 45-day intervals. The study was continued for six months.
We demonstrated that adding 5α,6α-epoxycholesterol to basic fodder significantly affected lipid status of the experimental animals, increasing total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol levels, as well as HCY and ADMA levels, whilst leaving the PON-1 activity unaffected. Additionally, the ECh group presented with significantly higher concentrations of inflammatory biomarkers (IL-6, TNF-α, and CRP). In the Ch group, lower yet significant (as compared to the C group) changes of levels of studied parameters were observed.
Exposure of animals with experimentally induced hypercholesterolemia to 5α,6α-epoxycholesterol increases dyslipidaemia, endothelial dysfunction, and inflammatory response.
Cholesterol and its oxygenated metabolites, such as oxysterols, are intensively investigated as potential players in the pathophysiology of brain disorder. Altered oxysterol levels have been described in patients with numerous neuropsychiatric disorders, including Alzheimer's disease, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy, and Smith-Lemli-Opitz Syndrome. Recent studies have shown that Autism Spectrum Disorders are associated with disruption of cholesterol metabolism. The present study aimed at investigating the profile of oxysterols in plasma and their association with clinical parameters in patients with Autism Spectrum Disorders. Thirty-six children with Autism Spectrum Disorders and thirty-eight healthy children, from Sfax (a southern area of Tunisia) matched for age and sex, were included in the study. The severity of Autism Spectrum Disorders was evaluated using the childhood autism rating scale. Standard lipid profile (total cholesterol, triglycerides, and high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol), serum glucose, high-sensitive C-reactive protein and orosomucoid levels were measured utilizing standard techniques. Oxysterol levels were measured by isotope-dilution gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. Standard lipid profile, serum glucose, high-sensitive C-reactive protein and orosomucoid levels were similar between the two studied populations. Compared to the control group, children with Autism Spectrum Disorders showed a significant higher plasma level of 24-hydroxycholesterol, while borderline significance was observed for 7α-hydroxycholesterol, and 25-hydroxycholersterol. In patients, 24-hydroxycholesterol was inversely correlated with age. Multivariate analysis showed that high plasma levels of 24-hydroxycholesterol are independent risk factors for Autism Spectrum Disorders. On the other hand, an analysis of the receiver's operating characteristics proved that the measured parameters recorded satisfactory levels of specificity and sensitivity. The present study provides evidence that Autism Spectrum Disorders are associated with altered levels in circulating oxysterols. The finding that 24-hydroxycholesterol is an independent risk factor for the disease and suggests the use of this oxysterol as a diagnostic tool in Autism Spectrum Disorders.
Rett syndrome (RS) is a pervasive neurodevelopmental disorder resulting from loss-of-function mutations in the X-linked gene methyl-Cpg-binding protein 2 (MECP2). Using a well-defined model for RS, the C57BL6/Mecp2 tm1.1Bird mouse, we have previously found a moderate but persistently lower rate of cholesterol synthesis, measured in vivo, in the brains of Mecp2 -/y mice, starting from about the third week after birth. There was no genotypic difference in the total cholesterol concentration throughout the brain at any age. This raised the question of whether the lower rate of cholesterol synthesis in the mutants was balanced by a fall in the rate at which cholesterol was converted via cholesterol 24-hydroxylase (Cyp46A1) to 24S-hydroxycholesterol (24S-OHC), the principal route through which cholesterol is ordinarily removed from the brain. Here, we show that while there were no genotypic differences in the concentrations in plasma and liver of three cholesterol precursors (lanosterol, lathosterol, and desmosterol), two plant sterols (sitosterol and campesterol), and two oxysterols (27-hydroxycholesterol [27-OHC] and 24S-OHC), the brains of the Mecp2 -/y mice had significantly lower concentrations of all three cholesterol precursors, campesterol, and both oxysterols, with the level of 24S-OHC being ~20% less than in their Mecp2 +/y controls. Together, these data suggest that coordinated regulation of cholesterol synthesis and catabolism in the central nervous system is maintained in this model for RS. Furthermore, we speculate that the adaptive changes in these two pathways conceivably resulted from a shift in the permeability of the blood-brain barrier as implied by the significantly lower campesterol and 27-OHC concentrations in the brains of the Mecp2 -/y mice.
Oxysterols play important roles in development and diseases, but can be highly challenging to analyze. To ensure satisfactory measurements, oxysterols must typically be separated with chromatography prior to detection. Here, we will devote attention to the chromatography of oxysterols, focusing on gas chromatography and liquid chromatography. We will present the role of stationary phases, mobile phases, and dimensions and geometries of particles/columns. We discuss how these parameters may affect the chromatography, regarding factors such as speed and resolution. Finally, we present some less explored avenues for separation of oxysterols.
Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is associated with excessive oxidative stress which may affect placental vascular function. Cholesterol homeostasis is crucial for maintaining fetoplacental endothelial function. We aimed to investigate whether and how GDM affects cholesterol metabolism in human fetoplacental endothelial cells (HPEC). HPEC were isolated from fetal term placental arterial vessels of GDM or control subjects. Cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) were detected by H2DCFDA fluorescent dye. Oxysterols were quantified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis. Genes and proteins involved in cholesterol homeostasis were detected by real-time PCR and immunoblotting, respectively. Cholesterol efflux was determined from [3H]-cholesterol labeled HPEC and [14C]-acetate was used as cholesterol precursor to measure cholesterol biosynthesis and esterification. We detected enhanced formation of ROS and of specific, ROS-derived oxysterols in HPEC isolated from GDM versus control pregnancies. ROS-generated oxysterols were simultaneously elevated in cord blood of GDM neonates. Liver-X receptor activation in control HPEC by synthetic agonist TO901319, 7-ketocholesterol, or 7β-hydroxycholesterol upregulated ATP-binding cassette transporters (ABC)A1 and ABCG1 expression, accompanied by increased cellular cholesterol efflux. Upregulation of ABCA1 and ABCG1 and increased cholesterol release to apoA-I and HDL3 (78 ± 17%, 40 ± 9%, respectively) were also observed in GDM versus control HPEC. The LXR antagonist GGPP reversed ABCA1 and ABCG1 upregulation and reduced the increased cholesterol efflux in GDM HPEC. Similar total cellular cholesterol levels were detected in control and GDM HPEC, while GDM enhanced cholesterol biosynthesis along with upregulated 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase (HMGCR) and sterol O-acyltransferase 1 (SOAT1) mRNA and protein levels. Our results suggest that in GDM cellular cholesterol homeostasis in the fetoplacental endothelium is modulated via LXR activation and helps to maintain its proper functionality.
Although male gender, aging, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and smoking are common risk factors for abdominal aortic aneurysm, diabetes mellitus is an independent negative risk factor. In aneurysm tissue, matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) expressed by activated macrophages degrades extracellular matrix proteins. In our previous experimental study, we demonstrated that the aneurysmal formation and macrophage activity were suppressed by inhibiting mimicking hyperglycemia (HG) through upregulation of glucose-sensing nuclear receptor, Nr1h2. Here in this study, we focused on the role of HG-induced altered glucose uptake on macrophage activation.
RAW264.7 murine macrophage cells were pretreated in cultures containing HG (HG group, 15.5 mM) or normal glucose (NG) concentrations (NG group, 5.5 mM) for 7 d. The culture medium was then changed in both groups to NG conditions, and the cells were stimulated with recombinant murine soluble receptor activator of NF-κB ligand (sRANKL). Macrophage activation was confirmed by tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) staining.
Compared with the NG group, MMP-9 expression in the HG group was significantly suppressed. Glucose uptake was increased in the NG group but not in the HG group during macrophage activation. To determine the mechanism of activation, we studied the expression and distribution of glucose transporters (Gluts) in the macrophages. Although Glut expression was unaffected by glucose pretreatment, membrane translocation of Glut-1 was significantly enhanced in macrophages in the NG group but not in the HG group during activation. Insulin receptor and insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) messenger RNA, known stimulate to membrane translocation of Gluts, were both decreased by the HG condition but not by the NG condition.
HG pretreatment suppressed the macrophage activation. sRANKL increased macrophage glucose uptake at NG concentrations, which was impaired by HG pretreatment through the inhibition of Glut1 membrane translocation and the insulin receptor and IRS-1 gene transcription. These data suggest that HG suppressed macrophage activation, through attenuation of glucose uptake via the suppression of the membrane translocation of Glut1 and insulin signaling.
Humans are environmentally exposed not only to single endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) but to mixtures that affect their reproductive health. In reproductive tissues, microRNAs (miRNAs) are emerging as key targets of EDCs. Here, we analysed changes in the testis "miRNome" (and their biogenesis mechanism) in chronically exposed adult mice to a cocktail of five EDCs containing 0.3 mg/kg-body weight (BW)/day of each phthalate (DEHP, DBP, BBP) and 0.05 mg/kg-BW/day of each alkylphenol (NP, OP), from conception to adulthood. The testis "miRNome" was characterised using next-generation sequencing (NGS). Expression levels of genes involved in miRNA biogenesis were measured by RT-qPCR, as well as several physiological and cytological parameters. We found two up-regulated, and eight down-regulated miRNAs and thirty-six differentially expressed isomiRs along with an over-expression of Drosha, Adar and Zcchc11. A significant decrease of intratesticular estradiol but not testosterone was detected. Functional analysis showed altered spermatogenesis, germ cell apoptosis and negative correlation of miR-18a-5p with Nr1h2 involved in the deregulation of the steroidogenesis pathway. Here, we present the first association between miRNA/isomiRs deregulation, their mechanisms of biogenesis and histopathological and hormonal alterations in testes of adult mice exposed to a mixture of low-dose EDCs, which can play a role in male infertility.
To study associations of cerebrovascular metabolism genotypes and haplotypes with age at Alzheimer's disease dementia (AD) onset and with neuropsychiatric symptoms according to each dementia stage.
Consecutive outpatients with late-onset AD were assessed for age at dementia onset and Neuropsychiatric Inventory scores according to Clinical Dementia Rating scores, apolipoprotein E gene (APOE) haplotypes, angiotensin-converting enzyme gene (ACE) variants rs1800764 and rs4291, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol receptor gene (LDLR) variants rs11669576 and rs5930, cholesteryl ester transfer protein gene (CETP) variants I422V and TaqIB, and liver X receptor beta gene (NR1H2) polymorphism rs2695121.
Considering 201 patients, only APOE-ɛ4 carriers had earlier dementia onset in multiple correlations, as well as less apathy, more delusions, and more aberrant motor behavior. Both ACE polymorphisms were associated with less intense frontally mediated behaviors. Regarding LDLR variants, carriers of the A allele of rs11669576 had less anxiety and more aberrant motor behavior, whereas carriers of the A allele of rs5930 had less delusions, less anxiety, more apathy, and more irritability. CETP variants that included G alleles of I422V and TaqIB were mostly associated with less intense frontally mediated behaviors, while severely impaired carriers of the T allele of rs2695121 had more anxiety and more aberrant motor behavior.
Though only APOE haplotypes affected AD onset, cerebrovascular metabolism genotypes were associated with differences in several neuropsychiatric manifestations of AD.
Endometrial cancer (EC) is the most common gynaecological malignancy. Obesity is a major risk factor for EC and is associated with elevated cholesterol. 27-hydroxycholesterol (27HC) is a cholesterol metabolite that functions as an endogenous agonist for Liver X receptor (LXR) and a selective oestrogen receptor modulator (SERM). Exposure to oestrogenic ligands increases risk of developing EC; however, the impact of 27HC on EC is unknown. Samples of stage 1 EC (n = 126) were collected from postmenopausal women undergoing hysterectomy. Expression of LXRs (NR1H3, LXRα; NR1H2, LXRβ) and enzymes required for the synthesis (CYP27A1) or breakdown (CYP7B1) of 27HC were detected in all grades of EC. Cell lines originating from well-, moderate- and poorly-differentiated ECs (Ishikawa, RL95, MFE 280 respectively) were used to assess the impact of 27HC or the LXR agonist GW3965 on proliferation or expression of a luciferase reporter gene under the control of LXR- or ER-dependent promoters (LXRE, ERE). Incubation with 27HC or GW3965 increased transcription via LXRE in Ishikawa, RL95 and MFE 280 cells (P &lt; 0.01). 27HC selectively activated ER-dependent transcription (P &lt; 0.001) in Ishikawa cells and promoted proliferation of both Ishikawa and RL95 cells (P &lt; 0.001). In MFE 280 cells, 27HC did not alter proliferation but selective targeting of LXR with GW3965 significantly reduced cell proliferation (P &lt; 0.0001). These novel results suggest that 27HC can contribute to risk of EC by promoting proliferation of endometrial cancer epithelial cells and highlight LXR as a potential therapeutic target in the treatment of advanced disease.
Dendrogenin A (DDA) is a mammalian metabolite that displays anticancer and chemopreventive properties in mice. At the cancer cell level, DDA induces differentiation and death. We investigated herein the nature of DDA cytoxicity in cancer cells. We showed that DDA triggers biochemical and cellular features of macroautophagy/autophagy and that autophagy is cytotoxic. DDA induces both the accumulation of pro-lysosomal sterols and stimulates the expression of regulators of autophagy such as NR4A, LC3 and TFEB through binding to the liver X receptor (LXR), a ligand-dependent transcription factor consisting of 2 isoforms, NR1H2 and NR1H3. These effects are not observed with canonical LXR agonists such as the oxysterol 22(R)-hydroxycholesterol or the synthetic molecules T0901317 and GW3965. DDA effects were measured on melanoma and acute myeloid leukemia cells including patient-derived leukemia cells in vitro and in vivo. Importantly the induction of lethal autophagy kills cells independently of their cytogenetic subgroups and does not differentiate bulk cancer cells from cancer cell progenitors. Together these data show that DDA drives LXR to induce the expression of autophagic genes leading to cancer cells death. This opens up new perspectives for cancer treatment.
The gene expression of 182 cardiovascular candidate genes was measured in high quality groups of individuals (n = 20) by microarrays to determine whether a subset of genes would discriminate obese and hypertensive individuals, in spite of the existence of a close link between these two cardiovascular risk factors.
The results were validated on the 20 subjects used for microarray analysis and on 62 additional individuals by real-time PCR.
The first analysis, where patient groups were compared with healthy subjects, revealed 15 out of 182 genes that differed in hypertensive, obese or obesity-related hypertensive individuals. These genes were ALOX5, APOA2, SELL, RGS2, CD14, FPR1, CAMP, DEFA3, DEFA4, CBS, CHRM1, ICAM1, NR1H2, SCNN1B and TGFB1. A second analysis was carried out in which patient groups were compared with each other, demonstrating FPR1 and DEFA3 as being significant genes discriminating patient groups. Furthermore, an analysis stratified by sex revealed that, with the exception of DEFA3, there are no other common genes between men and women.
We were able to indentify a number of interesting genes that distinguish patient and healthy subject groups as well as patient groups between them.
In addition, it seems that gender plays an important role, at least for some of the genes we tested. These findings may have important implications in the screening and etiology of hypertension or obesity, and could further help to focus on these specific mRNAs as antisense therapy targets.
Ambient air particulate matter (&lt;2.5μm in diameter) samples were collected on two different filter types in 2014 and 2015 over 24h periods and analyzed for reactive mercury (gaseous oxidized mercury+particulate bound mercury) concentrations and lead isotopes to determine sources of pollution to three sites in Nevada, USA. Two sites were located on the western edge of Nevada (Reno, urban, 1370m and Peavine Peak, rural, high elevation, 2515m); the third location was ~485km east in rural Great Basin National Park, NV (2061m). Reactive mercury samples were collected on cation exchange membranes simultaneously with lead samples, collected on Teflon membranes. Lead isotopic ratios have previously identified trans-Pacific lead sources based on the 206/207 and 208/207 lead ratios. Influence from trans-Pacific air masses was higher from March to June associated with long-range transport of pollutants. Spring months are well known for increased transport across the Pacific; however, fall months were also influenced by trans-Pacific air masses in this study. Western North American background ozone concentrations have been measured and modeled at 50 to 55ppbv. Median ozone concentrations at both rural sites in Nevada were within this range. Sources leading to enhancements in ozone of 2 to 18ppbv above monthly medians in Nevada included emissions from Eurasia, regional urban centers, and global and regional wildfires, resulting in concentrations close to the USA air quality standard. At the high elevation locations, ozone was derived from pollutants being transported in the free troposphere that originate around the globe; however, Eurasia and Asia were dominant sources to the Western USA. Negative correlations between reactive mercury and percent Asian lead, Northern Eurasia and East Asia trajectories indicated reactive mercury concentrations at the two high elevation sites were produced by oxidants from local, regional, and marine boundary layer sources.

High-throughput RNA-seq has revolutionized the process of small RNA (sRNA) discovery, leading to a rapid expansion of sRNA categories. In addition to the previously well-characterized sRNAs such as microRNAs (miRNAs), piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs), and small nucleolar RNA (snoRNAs), recent emerging studies have spotlighted on tRNA-derived sRNAs (tsRNAs) and rRNA-derived sRNAs (rsRNAs) as new categories of sRNAs that bear versatile functions. Since existing software and pipelines for sRNA annotation are mostly focused on analyzing miRNAs or piRNAs, here we developed the sRNA annotation pipelineoptimized for rRNA- and tRNA-derived sRNAs (SPORTS1.0). SPORTS1.0 is optimized for analyzing tsRNAs and rsRNAs from sRNA-seq data, in addition to its capacity to annotate canonical sRNAs such as miRNAs and piRNAs. Moreover, SPORTS1.0 can predict potential RNA modification sites based on nucleotide mismatches within sRNAs. SPORTS1.0 is precompiled to annotate sRNAs for a wide range of 68 species across bacteria, yeast, plant, and animal kingdoms, while additional species for analyses could be readily expanded upon end users' input. For demonstration, by analyzing sRNA datasets using SPORTS1.0, we reveal that distinct signatures are present in tsRNAs and rsRNAs from different mouse cell types. We also find that compared to other sRNA species, tsRNAs bear the highest mismatch rate, which is consistent with their highly modified nature. SPORTS1.0 is an open-source software and can be publically accessed at https://github.com/junchaoshi/sports1.0.
Pterin derivatives are heterocyclic compounds which are present in different biological systems. Neutral aqueous solutions of pterins present acid-base and keto-enol equilibria. These compounds, under UV-A radiation fluoresce, undergo photooxidation, generate reactive oxygen species and photoinduce the oxidation of biological substrates. As photosensitizers, they may act through different mechanisms, mainly through an electron transfer-initiated process (type-I mechanism), but they also produce singlet molecular oxygen (1 O2 ) upon irradiation (type-II mechanism). In general, upon UV-A excitation two triplet states, corresponding to the lactim and lactam tautomers, are formed, but only the last one is the responsible for the photosensitized reactions of biomolecules. We present a study of the photochemical properties of 3-methylpterin (3-Mep) which, in contrast to most pterin derivatives, exists only in the lactam form. Also an improvement in the synthesis of 3-Mep is reported. The spectroscopic properties 3-Mep in aqueous solution were similar to those of the unsubstituted pterin derivative (Ptr) in its acid form, such as absorption, fluorescent and phosphorescent emission spectra. Experiments using 2'-deoxyguanosine 5'-monophosphate (dGMP) as oxidizable target demonstrated that methylation at C-3 position of the pterin moiety does not affect significantly the efficiency of photosensitization, but results in a more photostable sensitizer.
To fertilize an egg, sperm must reside in the female reproductive tract to undergo several maturational changes that are collectively referred to as capacitation. From a molecular point of view, the HCO3--dependent activation of the atypical soluble adenylyl cyclase (ADCY10) is one of the first events that occurs during capacitation and leads to the subsequent cAMP-dependent activation of protein kinase A (PKA). Capacitation is also accompanied by hyperpolarization of the sperm plasma membrane. We previously reported that PKA activation is necessary for CFTR (Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator Channel) activity and for the modulation of membrane potential (Em). However, the main HCO3- transporters involved in the initial transport and the PKA-dependent Em changes are not well known nor characterized. Here, we analyzed how the activity of CFTR regulates Em during capacitation and examined its relationship with an electrogenic Na+/HCO3- cotransporter (NBC) and epithelial Na+ channels (ENaCs). We observed that inhibition of both CFTR and NBC decreased HCO3- influx, resulting in lower PKA activity, and that events downstream the cAMP-activation of PKA are essential for the regulation of Em. Addition of a permeable cAMP analog partially rescued the inhibitory effects caused by these inhibitors. HCO3-  also produced a rapid membrane hyperpolarization mediated by ENaC channels, which contribute to the regulation of Em during capacitation. Altogether, we demonstrate for the first time, that NBC cotransporters and ENaC channels are essential in the CFTR-dependent activation of the cAMP/PKA signaling pathway and Em regulation during human sperm capacitation.
Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) is caused by epigenetic de-repression of the disease locus, leading to pathogenic misexpression of the DUX4 gene in skeletal muscle. While the factors and pathways involved in normal repression of the FSHD locus in healthy cells have been well characterized, very little is known about those responsible for the aberrant activation of DUX4-fl in FSHD myocytes. Reasoning that DUX4-fl activators might represent useful targets for small molecule inhibition, we performed a highly targeted, candidate-based screen of epigenetic regulators in primary FSHD myocytes. We confirmed several of the strongest and most specific candidates (ASH1L, BRD2, KDM4C, and SMARCA5) in skeletal myocytes from two other unrelated FSHD1 patients, and we showed that knockdown led to reduced levels of DUX4-fl and DUX4-FL target genes, as well as altered chromatin at the D4Z4 locus. As a second mode of validation, targeting the CRISPR/dCas9-KRAB transcriptional repressor to the promoters of several candidates also led to reduced levels of DUX4-fl. Furthermore, these candidates can be repressed by different methods in skeletal myocytes without major effects on certain critical muscle genes. Our results demonstrate that expression of DUX4-fl is regulated by multiple epigenetic pathways, and they indicate viable, druggable candidates for therapeutic target development.
Motivated by the recent resurgence of interest in topological superconductivity, we study superconducting pairing instabilities of the hole-doped Rashba-Hubbard model on the square lattice with first- and second-neighbor hopping. Within the random phase approximation, we compute the spin-fluctuation-mediated pairing interactions as a function of filling. Rashba spin-orbit coupling splits the spin degeneracies of the bands, which leads to two van Hove singularities at two different fillings. We find that, for a doping region in between these two van Hove fillings, the spin fluctuations exhibit a strong ferromagnetic contribution. Because of these ferromagnetic fluctuations, there is a strong tendency towards spin-triplet f-wave pairing within this filling region, resulting in a topologically nontrivial phase.
Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are a newly appreciated class of RNAs found across phyla that are generated most commonly from back-splicing of protein-coding exons. Recent profiling of circRNAs genome-wide has shown that hundreds of circRNAs dramatically increase in expression during aging in the brains of multiple organisms. No other class of transcripts has been found to show such a strong correlation with aging as circRNAs-could they be playing a role in the aging process? Here, we discuss the different methods used to profile circRNAs and discuss current limitations of these approaches. We argue that age-related increases in global circRNA levels likely result from their high stability. The functions of circRNAs are only beginning to emerge, and it is an open question whether circRNA accumulation impacts the aging brain. We discuss experimental approaches that could illuminate whether age-accumulation of circRNAs are detrimental or protective to the aging brain.
In this work we study, by means of &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;ab initio&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; calculations, the structural, electronic and magnetic properties of Y-doped BiFeO&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;3&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt; compounds. We determine that there is a morphotropic phase boundary at an yttrium concentration of (18 ± 2)%, where the structure changes from &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;R3c&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; to &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Pnma&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;. This structural transition is driven by the chemical pressure induced by the dopant.&amp;#13; &amp;#13; By analyzing the evolution of the oxygen octahedral tilts we find an enhanced antiferrodistortive distortion when increasing the Y-doping, together with a reduction of the ferroelectric distorsion, that gives rise to a smaller value of the electric polarization. These cooperative effects should lead to a larger canting of the Fe magnetic moments and to a larger ferromagnetic response in the &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;R3c&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; phase, as it is observed in the experiments.&amp;#13.
Although object-related areas were discovered in human parietal cortex a decade ago, surprisingly little is known about the nature and purpose of these representations, and how they differ from those in the ventral processing stream. In this article, we review evidence for the unique contribution of object areas of dorsal cortex to three-dimensional (3-D) shape representation, the localization of objects in space, and in guiding reaching and grasping actions. We also highlight the role of dorsal cortex in form-motion interaction and spatiotemporal integration, possible functional relationships between 3-D shape and motion processing, and how these processes operate together in the service of supporting goal-directed actions with objects. Fundamental differences between the nature of object representations in the dorsal versus ventral processing streams are considered, with an emphasis on how and why dorsal cortex supports veridical (rather than invariant) representations of objects to guide goal-directed hand actions in dynamic visual environments.
To investigate the role of pre-B-cell leukemia homeobox (PBX)3 in migration and invasion of colorectal cancer (CRC) cells.
We detected PBX3 expression in five cell lines and surgical specimens from 111 patients with CRC using real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. We forced expression of PBX3 in low metastatic HT-29 and SW480 cells and knocked down expression of PBX3 in highly metastatic LOVO and HCT-8 cells. Wound healing and Boyden chamber assays were used to detect cell migration and invasion after altered expression of PBX3. Western blot was performed to detect the change of signaling molecule ERK1/2 following PBX3 overexpression.
High level of PBX3 expression was correlated with the invasive potential of CRC cells, and significantly associated with lymph node invasion (P = 0.02), distant metastasis (P = 0.04), advanced TNM stage (P = 0.03) and poor overall survival of patients (P &lt; 0.05). Ectopic expression of PBX3 in low metastatic cells was shown to promote migration and invasion, while inhibited PBX3 expression in highly metastatic cells suppressed migration and invasion. Furthermore, upregulation of phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1/2 was found to be one of the targeted molecules responsible for PBX3-induced CRC cell migration and invasion.
PBX3 induces invasion and metastasis of CRC cells partially through activation of the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway.
Breast cancer is a severe risk to public health and has adequately convoluted pathogenesis. Therefore, the description of key molecular markers and pathways is of much importance for clarifying the molecular mechanism of breast cancer-associated fibroblasts initiation and progression. Breast cancer-associated fibroblasts gene expression dataset was downloaded from Gene Expression Omnibus database.
A total of nine samples, including three normal fibroblasts, three granulin-stimulated fibroblasts and three cancer-associated fibroblasts samples, were used to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between normal fibroblasts, granulin-stimulated fibroblasts and cancer-associated fibroblasts samples. The gene ontology (GO) and pathway enrichment analysis was performed, and protein-protein interaction (PPI) network of the DEGs was constructed by NetworkAnalyst software.
Totally, 190 DEGs were identified, including 66 up-regulated and 124 down-regulated genes. GO analysis results showed that up-regulated DEGs were significantly enriched in biological processes (BP), including cell-cell signalling and negative regulation of cell proliferation; molecular function (MF), including insulin-like growth factor II binding and insulin-like growth factor I binding; cellular component (CC), including insulin-like growth factor binding protein complex and integral component of plasma membrane; the down-regulated DEGs were significantly enriched in BP, including cell adhesion and extracellular matrix organization; MF, including N-acetylgalactosamine 4-sulfate 6-O-sulfotransferase activity and calcium ion binding; CC, including extracellular space and extracellular matrix. WIKIPATHWAYS analysis showed the up-regulated DEGs were enriched in myometrial relaxation and contraction pathways. WIKIPATHWAYS, REACTOME, PID_NCI and KEGG pathway analysis showed the down-regulated DEGs were enriched endochondral ossification, TGF beta signalling pathway, integrin cell surface interactions, beta1 integrin cell surface interactions, malaria and glycosaminoglycan biosynthesis-chondroitin sulfate/dermatan sulphate. The top 5 up-regulated hub genes, CDKN2A, MME, PBX1, IGFBP3, and TFAP2C and top 5 down-regulated hub genes VCAM1, KRT18, TGM2, ACTA2, and STAMBP were identified from the PPI network, and subnetworks revealed these genes were involved in significant pathways, including myometrial relaxation and contraction pathways, integrin cell surface interactions, beta1 integrin cell surface interaction. Besides, the target hsa-mirs for DEGs were identified. hsa-mir-759, hsa-mir-4446-5p, hsa-mir-219a-1-3p and hsa-mir-26a-5p were important miRNAs in this study.
We pinpoint important key genes and pathways closely related with breast cancer-associated fibroblasts initiation and progression by a series of bioinformatics analysis on DEGs. These screened genes and pathways provided for a more detailed molecular mechanism underlying breast cancer-associated fibroblasts occurrence and progression, holding promise for acting as molecular markers and probable therapeutic targets.
MTG16 (myeloid translocation gene on chromosome 16) and its related proteins, MTG8 and MTGR1, define a small family of transcriptional corepressors. These corepressors share highly conserved domain structures yet have distinct biological functions and tissue specificity. In vivo studies have shown that, of the three MTG corepressors, MTG16 is uniquely important for the regulation of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cell (HSPC) proliferation and differentiation. Apart from this physiological function, MTG16 is also involved in carcinomas and leukemias, acting as the genetic target of loss of heterozygosity (LOH) aberrations in breast cancer and recurrent translocations in leukemia. The frequent involvement of MTG16 in these disease etiologies implies an important developmental role for this transcriptional corepressor. Furthermore, mounting evidence suggests that MTG16 indirectly alters the disease course of several leukemias via its regulatory interactions with a variety of pathologic fusion proteins. For example, a recent study has shown that MTG16 can repress not only wild-type E2A-mediated transcription, but also leukemia fusion protein E2A-Pbx1-mediated transcription, suggesting that MTG16 may serve as a potential therapeutic target in acute lymphoblastic leukemia expressing the E2A-Pbx1 fusion protein. Given that leukemia stem cells share similar regulatory pathways with normal HSPCs, studies to further understand how MTG16 regulates cell proliferation and differentiation could lead to novel therapeutic approaches for leukemia treatment.
Trophoblastic cells play a crucial role in implantation and placentogenesis. A large proportion of the failures of conception in cows occur in the peri-implantation period, which are known as early embryo losses. In exploring this critical phenomenon, trophoblastic cell lines can provide substantial information. Unfortunately, there are few cell lines for this purpose in cattle because of the difficulty of raising successive cell stock in the long term. In this study, 12 new cell lines were established using bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP4). BMP4 stimulated embryonic cells to enter the trophoblastic cell lineage but there were no significant differences between intact and BMP4-treated groups. Only one out of 49 embryos developed trophoblastic cells in the intact group. Finally, 12 cell lines were maintained for around 30 passages, and they retained trophoblastic characteristics and expressed bovine trophoblastic genes: placental lactogen, interferon-τ, pregnancy-associated glycoprotein 1, and prolactin-related protein 1. Although the gene expression patterns were different among cell lines and depended on the cells, there was no significant relationship between the expression intensities of genes and the treatment dose of BMP4. All of them expressed bovine POU domain class 5 transcription factor 1 and caudal-type homeobox 2. The expression of these genes was confirmed by quantitative RT-PCR and immunohistochemical detection. These results suggest that BMP4 is involved in the raising of trophoblast cell lines from early embryonic cells and the newly developed cell lines can provide different types of bovine trophoblastic cells with different cell lineages. This may constitute a significant new tool for the examination of trophoblastic differentiation.
The sodium glucose cotransporter (SGLT1) is responsible for all active intestinal glucose uptake. Hepatocyte nuclear factors 1 alpha and beta (HNF 1 alpha and HNF 1 beta) activate the SGLT1 promoter, whereas GATA-binding protein 5 (GATA-5) and caudal-type homeobox protein 2 (CDX2) regulate transcription of other intestinal genes. We investigated SGLT1 regulation by these transcription factors using promoter studies and RNA interference.
Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells were transiently cotransfected with an SGLT1-luciferase promoter construct and combinations of expression vectors for HNF 1 alpha, HNF 1 beta, CDX2, and GATA-5. Caco-2 cells were stably transfected with knockdown vectors for either HNF 1 alpha or HNF 1 beta. mRNA levels of HNF 1 alpha, HNF 1 beta, and SGLT1 were determined using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR).
HNF 1 alpha, GATA-5, and HNF 1 beta significantly activated the SGLT1 promoter (P &lt; .05). Cotransfection of GATA-5 with HNF 1 alpha had an additive effect, whereas HNF 1 beta and CDX2 antagonized HNF 1 alpha and GATA-5. SGLT1 expression was significantly reduced in HNF 1 alpha or HNF 1 beta knockdowns (P &lt; .001). HNF alpha knockdown significantly reduced HNF 1 beta expression and vice versa (P &lt; .005).
HNF 1 alpha and HNF 1 beta are important transcription factors for endogenous SGLT1 expression by cultured enterocytes. GATA-5 and CDX2 also regulate SGLT1 promoter activity and show cooperativity with the HNF1s. We, therefore, propose a multifactorial model for SGLT1 regulation, with interactions between HNF1, GATA-5, and CDX2 modulating intestinal glucose absorption.
Humans express two ACAT (acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase) genes, ACAT1 and ACAT2. ACAT1 is ubiquitously expressed, whereas ACAT2 is primarily expressed in intestinal mucosa and plays an important role in intestinal cholesterol absorption. To investigate the molecular mechanism(s) responsible for the tissue-specific expression of ACAT2, we identified five cis-elements within the human ACAT2 promoter, four for the intestinal-specific transcription factor CDX2 (caudal type homeobox transcription factor 2), and one for the transcription factor HNF1alpha (hepatocyte nuclear factor 1alpha). Results of luciferase reporter and electrophoretic mobility shift assays show that CDX2 and HNF1alpha exert a synergistic effect, enhancing the ACAT2 promoter activity through binding to these cis-elements. In undifferentiated Caco-2 cells, the ACAT2 expression is increased when exogenous CDX2 and/or HNF1alpha are expressed by co-transfection. In differentiated Caco-2 cells, the ACAT2 expression significantly decreases when the endogenous CDX2 or HNF1alpha expression is suppressed by using RNAi (RNA interference) technology. The expression levels of CDX2, HNF1alpha, and ACAT2 are all greatly increased when the Caco-2 cells differentiate to become intestinal-like cells. These results provide a molecular mechanism for the tissue-specific expression of ACAT2 in intestine. In normal adult human liver, CDX2 expression is not detectable and the ACAT2 expression is very low. In the hepatoma cell line HepG2 the CDX2 expression is elevated, accounting for its elevated ACAT2 expression. A high percentage (seven of fourteen) of liver samples from patients affected with hepatocellular carcinoma exhibited elevated ACAT2 expression. Thus, the elevated ACAT2 expression may serve as a new biomarker for certain form(s) of hepatocellular carcinoma.
To establish the methylation profile of the promoter CpG islands of 31 genes that might play etiological roles in colon carcinogenesis.
The methylation specific PCR in conjunction of sequencing verification was used to establish the methylation-profile of the promoter CpG islands of 31 genes in colorectal cancer (n = 65), the neighboring non-cancerous tissues (n = 5), colorectal adenoma (n = 8), and normal mucosa (n = 1). Immunohistochemically, expression of 10 genes was assessed on the home-made tissue microarrays of tissues from 58 patients. The correlation of tumor specific changes with each of clinical-pathologic features was scrutinized with relevant statistic tools.
In comparison with the normal mucosa of the non-cancer patients, the following 14 genes displayed no tumor associated changes: breast cancer 1, early onset (BRCA1), cadherin 1, type 1, E-cadherin (epithelial) (CDH1), death-associated protein kinase 1 (DAPK1), DNA (cytosine-5-)-methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1), melanoma antigen, family A, 1 (directs expression of antigen MZ2-E) (MAGEA1), tumor suppressor candidate 3 (N33), cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1A (p21, Cip1) (p21(WAF1)), cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1B (p27, Kip1) (p27(KIP1)), phosphatase and tensin homolog (mutated in multiple advanced cancers 1) (PTEN), retinoic acid receptor, beta (RAR- , Ras association (RalGDS/AF-6) domain family 1 C (RASSF1C), secreted frizzled-related protein 1 (SFRP1), tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 3 (Sorsby fundus dystrophy, pseudoinflammatory) (TIMP3), and von Hippel-Lindau syndrome (VHL). The rest 17 targets exhibited to various extents the tumor associated changes. As changes in methylation of the following genes occurred marginally, their impact on the formation of colorectal cancer were trivial: adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) (8%, 5/65), Ras association (RalGDS/AF-6) domain family 1A (RASSF1A) (3%, 2/65) and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A, alternated reading frame (p14(ARF)) (6%, 4/65). The following genes exhibited moderate changes in methylation: O-6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) (20%, 13/65), mutL homolog 1, colon cancer, nonpolyposis type 2 (E. coli) (hMLH1) (18%, 12/65), cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A (melanoma, p16, inhibits CDK4) (p16(INK4a)) (10%, 10/65), methylated in tumor 1 (MINT1) (15%, 10/65), methylated in tumor 31 (MINT31) (11%, 7/65). The rest changed greatly in the methylation pattern in colorectal cancer (CRC): cyclin A1 (cyclin a1) (100%, 65/65), caudal type homeobox transcription factor 1 (CDX1) (100%, 65/65), RAR- (85%, 55/65), myogenic factor 3 (MYOD1) (69%, 45/65), cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2B (p15, inhibits CDK4) (p15(INK4b)) (68%, 44/65), prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2 (prostaglandin G/H synthase and cyclooxygenase) (COX2) (72%, 47/65), cadherin 13, H-cadherin (heart) (CDH13) (65%, 42/65), CAAX box 1 (CXX1) (58%, 38/65), tumor protein p73 (p73) (63%, 41/65) and Wilms tumor 1 (WT1) (58%, 38/65). However, no significant correlation of changes in methylation with any given clinical-pathological features was detected. Furthermore, the frequent changes in methylation appeared to be an early phase event of colon carcinogenesis. The in situ expression of 10 genes was assessed by the immunohistochemical approach at the protein level: CDH1, CDH13, COX2, cyclin A1, hMLH1, MGMT, p14(ARF), p73, RAR- , and TIMP3 genes in the context of the methylation status in colorectal cancer. No clear correlation between the hypermethylation of the promoter CpG islands and the negative expression of the genes was established.
The methylation profile of 31 genes was established in patients with colon cancer and colorectal adenomas, which provides new insights into the DNA methylation mediated mechanisms underlying the carcinogenesis of colorectal cancer and may be of prognostic values for colorectal cancer.
Signet-ring cell carcinoma (SRCC) is a unique subtype of adenocarcinoma that is characterized by abundant intracellular mucin accumulation and a crescent-shaped nucleus displaced toward one end of the cell. Identification of an SRCC's primary site is important for better planning of patient management because the treatment and prognosis differs markedly depending on the origin of the SRCC. In the present study, we analyzed the immunohistochemical characteristics of 94 cases of SRCC, including 21 cases of gastric SRCC, 16 of colorectal SRCC, 10 of breast SRCC, and 47 of pulmonary SRCC, with antibodies against Reg IV and claudin-18, which we previously identified as gastric cancer-related genes. We also tested known markers cytokeratin 7, cytokeratin 20, MUC2, MUC5AC, caudal-related homeobox gene 2 (CDX2), thyroid transcription factor-1, mammaglobin, gross cystic disease fluid protein 15, and estrogen receptor. All 21 cases of gastric SRCC and 16 cases of colorectal SRCC were positive for Reg IV, and the remaining SRCCs were negative. Eighteen of 21 (86%) gastric SRCCs and 6 of 16 (38%) colorectal SRCCs were positive for claudin-18, whereas another SRCCs were negative. In conclusion, Reg IV staining and claudin-18 staining can aid in diagnosis of gastrointestinal SRCC.
Mesodiencephalic dopaminergic (mdDA) neurons control locomotion and emotion and are affected in multiple psychiatric and neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson's disease (PD). The homeodomain transcription factor Pitx3 is pivotal in mdDA neuron development and loss of Pitx3 results in programming deficits in a rostrolateral subpopulation of mdDA neurons destined to form the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc), reminiscent of the specific cell loss observed in PD. We show here that in adult mice in which the gene encoding a second homeoprotein, engrailed 1 (En1), has been deleted, dramatic loss of mdDA neurons and striatal innervation defects were observed, partially reminiscent of defects observed in Pitx3(-/-) mice. We then continue to reveal developmental crosstalk between En1 and Pitx3 through genome-wide expression analysis. During development, both En1 and Pitx3 are required to induce expression of mdDA genes in the rostrolateral subset destined to form the SNc. By contrast, Pitx3 and En1 reciprocally regulate a separate gene cluster, which includes Cck, demarcating a caudal mdDA subset in wild-type embryos. Whereas En1 is crucial for induction of this caudal phenotype, Pitx3 antagonizes it rostrolaterally. The combinatorial action of En1 and Pitx3 is potentially realized through at least three levels of molecular interaction: (1) influencing each other's expression level, (2) releasing histone deacetylase-mediated repression of Nurr1 target genes and (3) modulating En1 activity through Pitx3-driven activation of En1 modulatory proteins. These findings show how two crucial mediators of mdDA neuronal development, En1 and Pitx3, interact in dopaminergic subset specification, the importance of which is exemplified by the specific vulnerability of the SNc found in PD. 
A critical cis-regulatory element for the CFTR (cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator) gene is located in intron 11, 100 kb distal to the promoter, with which it interacts. This sequence contains an intestine-selective enhancer and associates with enhancer signature proteins, such as p300, in addition to tissue-specific TFs (transcription factors). In the present study we identify critical TFs that are recruited to this element and demonstrate their importance in regulating CFTR expression. In vitro DNase I footprinting and EMSAs (electrophoretic mobility-shift assays) identified four cell-type-selective regions that bound TFs in vitro. ChIP (chromatin immunoprecipitation) identified FOXA1/A2 (forkhead box A1/A2), HNF1 (hepatocyte nuclear factor 1) and CDX2 (caudal-type homeobox 2) as in vivo trans-interacting factors. Mutation of their binding sites in the intron 11 core compromised its enhancer activity when measured by reporter gene assay. Moreover, siRNA (small interfering RNA)-mediated knockdown of CDX2 caused a significant reduction in endogenous CFTR transcription in intestinal cells, suggesting that this factor is critical for the maintenance of high levels of CFTR expression in these cells. The ChIP data also demonstrate that these TFs interact with multiple cis-regulatory elements across the CFTR locus, implicating a more global role in intestinal expression of the gene.
  To analyse the expression of several mucins (MUC1, MUC2, MUC3, MUC5AC and MUC6), epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), v-erb-b2 erythroblastic leukaemia viral oncogene homologue 2 (HER2), thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF-1), caudal type homeobox 2 (CDX2) and cytokeratin 20 (CK20), and the presence of mutations of EGFR, KRAS and HER2 in congenital pulmonary airway malformations (CPAM).
  Forty-one cases of CPAM and six pulmonary sequestrations were included. TTF-1 expression was observed in all cases but was not seen in mucinogenic growths in CPAM. CDX2 expression was completely negative. MUC1 expression was noted in 12 (29%) CPAM and in 33% sequestrations. MUC5AC was noted in only five cases (26%) by immunohistochemistry and was found in the mucinogenic proliferations of type 1 CPAM. No immunolabelling was noted for the other mucins. EGFR was expressed variably in almost all cases, while HER2 and CK20 was seen exclusively in the mucinogenic proliferations. All mucinous growths were characterized by KRAS mutations. No EGFR and HER2 gene alterations were identified.
  KRAS mutations and MUC5AC, CK20 and HER2 expression was seen in all mucinogenic proliferations, supporting the neoplastic nature of these cytologically bland growths. These findings emphasize the importance of complete surgical resection of such lesions.
Computational analysis and bioinformatics have significantly advanced the ability of researchers to process and analyze biological data. Molecular data from human and model organisms may facilitate drug target validation and identification of biomarkers with increased predictive accuracy. The aim of the present study was to investigate the function of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) using online databases, and to predict their regulatory mechanism. HCC-associated lncRNAs, their downstream transcription factors and microRNAs (miRNAs/miRs), as well as the HCC-associated target genes, were identified using online databases. HCC-associated lncRNAs, including HOX antisense intergenic RNA (HOTAIR) and metastasis-associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1 (MALAT1) were selected based on established databases of lncRNAs. The interaction between the HCC-associated lncRNAs and miRNAs (hsa-miR-1, hsa-miR-20a-5p) was predicted using starBase2.0. Signal transducer and activator of transcription 1, hepatocyte nuclear factor 4α (HNF4A), octamer-binding transcription factor 4, Nanog homeobox (NANOG), caudal type homeobox 2 (CDX2), DEAD-box helicase 5, brahma-related gene 1, MYC-associated factor X and MYC proto-oncogene, bHLH transcription factor have been identified as the transcription factors for HOTAIR and MALAT1 using ChIPBase. Additionally, CDX2, HNF4A, NANOG, ETS transcription factor, Jun proto-oncogene and forkhead box protein A1 were identified as the transcription factors for hsa-miR-1 and hsa-miR-20a-5p. CDX2, HNF4A and NANOG were the transcriptional factors in common between the lncRNAs and miRNAs. Cyclin D1, E2F transcription factor 1, epithelial growth factor receptor, MYC, MET proto-oncogene, receptor tyrosine kinase and vascular endothelial growth factor A were identified as target genes for the HCC progression, two of which were also the target genes of hsa-miR-1 and hsa-miR-20a-5p using the miRwalk and OncoDN. HCC databases. Additionally, these target genes may be involved in biological functions, including the regulation of cell growth, cell cycle progression and mitosis, and in disease progression, as demonstrated using DAVID clustering analysis. The present study aimed to predict a regulatory network of lncRNAs in HCC progression using bioinformatics analysis.
Thyroid and glucocorticoid hormones and several transcriptional factors such as caudal type homeobox (CDX)-2 and hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF)-1α are important for the differentiation of small intestinal absorptive cells and the consequent expression of genes related to the digestion/absorption of carbohydrates. In this study, we investigated whether thyroid and glucocorticoid hormones enhanced the expression of lactase-phlorizin hydrolase (LPH) gene, an intestine-specific gene that encodes an enzyme for lactose digestion, in small intestinal stem-like IEC-6 cells co-transfected with CDX-2 and HNF-1α using a retrovirus system. Changes in expression of intestine-specific genes caused by treatment with thyroid and/or glucocorticoid hormones were monitored in empty vector-transfected cells and in CDX-2/HNF-1α co-transfected cells by qRT-PCR. Stable co-transfection with CDX-2 and HNF-1α evoked the expression of the LPH gene in IEC-6 cells. Furthermore, treatment with a thyroid hormone, triiodothyronine, and a glucocorticoid receptor agonist, dexamethasone, significantly enhanced expression of the LPH, CDX-2 and HNF-1α genes in CDX-2/HNF-1α co-transfected IEC-6 cells. These results suggest that thyroid and glucocorticoid hormones synergistically enhance expression of the LPH gene in CDX-2/HNF-1α co-transfected IEC-6 cells. 
The type 1 carbohydrate chain, Galbeta1-3GlcNAc, is synthesized by UDP-galactose:beta-N-acetylglucosamine beta1,3-galactosyltransferase (beta3Gal-T). Among six beta3Gal-Ts cloned to date, beta3Gal-T5 is an essential enzyme for the synthesis of type 1 chain in epithelium of digestive tracts or pancreatic tissue. It forms the type 1 structure on glycoproteins produced from such tissues. In the present study, we found that the transcriptional regulation of the beta3Gal-T5 gene is controlled by homeoproteins, i.e. members of caudal-related homeobox protein (Cdx) and hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF) families. We found an important region (-151 to -121 from the transcription initiation site), named the beta3Gal-T5 control element (GCE), for the promoter activity. GCE contained the consensus sequences for members of the Cdx and HNF families. Mutations introduced into this sequence abolished the transcriptional activity. Four factors, Cdx1, Cdx2, HNF1alpha, and HNF1beta, could bind to GCE and transcriptionally activate the beta3Gal-T5 gene. Transcriptional regulation of the beta3Gal-T5 gene was consistent with that of members of the Cdx and HNF1 families in two in vivo systems. 1) During in vitro differentiation of Caco-2 cells, transcriptional up-regulation of beta3Gal-T5 was observed in correlation with the increase in transcripts for Cdx2 and HNF1alpha. 2) Both transcript and protein levels of beta3Gal-T5 were determined to be significantly reduced in colon cancer. This down-regulation was correlated with the decrease of Cdx1 and HNF1beta expression in cancer tissue. This is the first finding that a glycosyltransferase gene is transcriptionally regulated under the control of homeoproteins in a tissue-specific manner. beta3Gal-T5, controlled by the intestinal homeoproteins, may play an important role in the specific function of intestinal cells by modifying the carbohydrate structure of glycoproteins.
The caudal homeobox gene Cdx-2 is a transcriptional activator for approximately a dozen genes specifically expressed in pancreatic islets and intestinal cells. It is also involved in preventing the development of colorectal tumors. Studies using "knockout" approaches demonstrated that Cdx-2 is haplo-insufficient in certain tissues including the intestines but not the pancreatic islets. The mechanisms, especially transcription factors, which regulate Cdx-2 expression, are virtually unknown. We found previously that Cdx-2 expression could be autoregulated in a cell type-specific manner. In this study, we located an octamer (OCT) binding site within the mouse Cdx-2 gene promoter. This site, designated as Cdx-2(P)OCT, is involved in the expression of the Cdx-2 promoter. Both pancreatic and intestinal cell lines were found to express a number of POU (OCT binding) homeodomain proteins examined by electrophoretic mobility shift assay. However, it appears that Cdx-2(P)OCT interacts only with OCT1 in the nuclear extracts of the intestinal cell lines examined, although it interacts with OCT1 and at least two other POU proteins that are to be identified in the pancreatic InR1-G9 cell nuclear extract. Co-transfecting OCT1 cDNA but not five other POU gene cDNAs activates the Cdx-2 promoter in the pancreatic InR1-G9 and the intestinal Caco-2 cell lines. In contrast, Cdx-2(P)OCT cannot act as an enhancer element if it is fused to a thymidine kinase promoter. Furthermore, Cdx-2(P)OCT-thymidine kinase fusion promoters cannot be activated by OCT1 co-transfection. Cell type-specific expression, cell type-specific binding affinity of POU proteins to the cis-element Cdx-2(P)OCT, and the DNA content-dependent activation of Cdx-2 promoter via Cdx-2(P)OCT by OCT1 suggest that POU proteins play important and complicated roles in modulating Cdx-2 expression in cell type-specific manners.
The apical sodium-dependent bile acid transporter (ASBT) is expressed abundantly in the ileum and mediates bile acid absorption across the apical membranes. Caudal-type homeobox proteins CDX1 and CDX2 are transcription factors that regulate genes involved in intestinal epithelial differentiation and proliferation. Aberrant expression of both ASBT and CDXs in Barrett's esophagus (BE) prompted us to study, whether the expression of the ASBT gene is regulated by CDXs. Short interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of CDXs resulted in reduced ASBT mRNA expression in intestinal cells. CDXs strongly induced the activity of the ASBT promoter in reporter assays in esophageal and intestinal cells. Nine CDX binding sites were predicted in silico within the ASBT promoter, and binding of CDXs to six of them was verified in vitro and within living cells by electrophoretic mobility shift assays and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays, respectively. RNAs were extracted from esophageal biopsies from 20 BE patients and analyzed by real-time PCR. Correlation with ASBT expression was found for CDX1, CDX2, and HNF-1α in BE biopsies. In conclusion, the human ASBT promoter is activated transcriptionally by CDX1 and CDX2. Our finding provides a possible explanation for the reported observation that ASBT is aberrantly expressed in esophageal metaplasia that also expresses CDX transcription factors.
A clinicopathologic study with an emphasis on tumor immunohistochemical profile is presented.
Sixty-one cases of male invasive breast cancers were studied. Median age of the cohort was 65 years.
Ninety-seven percent were estrogen receptor positive+ and 10% human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 positive. The individual diagnostic marker positivity was 98% for GATA-binding protein 3, 95% for androgen receptor, 90% for progesterone receptor, 88% for deleted in pancreatic cancer 4, 75% for gross cystic disease fluid protein 15, 72% for cytokeratin 7, 55% for mammaglobin, and 15% for vimentin and Wilms tumor protein 1. Caudal type homeobox 2 protein, cytokeratin 20, Napsin A, paired box gene 8, prostate-specific antigen, thyroid transcription factor 1, and uroplakin II were negative in all cases. Survival analyses showed tumor stage, receptor status, and Nottingham prognostic index to be prognostic. The overall survival was 70%, but the breast cancer–specific survival was 92% (mean follow-up, 59 months); 33% developed second malignancy. The immunohistochemistry profile was similar to female breast cancers.
The second malignancies in this cohort affected overall survival and suggest the possibility of other germline mutations in addition to BRCA2 in male patients with breast cancer.
Identification of tissue- and stage-specific gene promoters is valuable for delineating the functional roles of specific genes in genetically engineered animals. Here, through the comparison of gene expression in different tissues by analysis of a microarray database, the intestinal specificity of mucin 2 (MUC2) expression was identified in mice and humans, and further confirmed in chickens by RT-PCR (reverse transcription-PCR) analysis. An analysis of cis-acting elements in avian MUC2 gene promoters revealed conservation of binding sites, within a 2.9 kb proximal promoter region, for transcription factors such as caudal type homeobox 2 (CDX2), GATA binding protein 4 (GATA4), hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 α (HNF4A), and transcription factor 4 (TCF4) that are important for maintaining intestinal homeostasis and functional integrity. By generating transgenic quail, we demonstrated that the 2.9 kb chicken MUC2 promoter could drive green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter expression exclusively in the small intestine, large intestine, and ceca. Fluorescence image analysis further revealed GFP expression in intestine epithelial cells. The GFP expression was barely detectable in the embryonic intestine, but increased during post-hatch development. The spatiotemporal expression pattern of the reporter gene confirmed that the 2.9 kb MUC2 promoter could retain the regulatory element to drive expression of target genes in intestinal tissues after hatching. This new transgene expression system, using the MUC2 promoter, will provide a new method of overexpressing target genes to study gene function in the avian intestine.
Pluripotency is an important feature of cancer stem cells (CSCs) that contributes to self-renewal and chemoresistance. The maintenance of pluripotency of CSCs under various pathophysiological conditions requires a complex interaction between various cellular pathways including those involved in homeostasis and energy metabolism. However, the exact mechanisms that maintain the CSC pluripotency remain poorly understood. In this report, using both human and murine models of CSCs, we demonstrate that basal levels of autophagy are required to maintain the pluripotency of CSCs, and that this process is differentially regulated by the rate-limiting enzyme in the NAD+ synthesis pathway NAMPT (nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase) and the transcription factor POU5F1/OCT4 (POU class 5 homeobox 1). First, our data show that the pharmacological inhibition and knockdown (KD) of NAMPT or the KD of POU5F1 in human CSCs significantly decreased the expression of pluripotency markers POU5F1, NANOG (Nanog homeobox) and SOX2 (SRY-box 2), and upregulated the differentiation markers TUBB3 (tubulin β 3 class III), CSN2 (casein β), SPP1 (secreted phosphoprotein 1), GATA6 (GATA binding protein 6), T (T brachyury transcription factor) and CDX2 (caudal type homeobox 2). Interestingly, these pluripotency-regulating effects of NAMPT and POU5F1 were accompanied by contrasting levels of autophagy, wherein NAMPT KD promoted while POU5F1 KD inhibited the autophagy machinery. Most importantly, any deviation from the basal level of autophagy, either increase (via rapamycin, serum starvation or Tat-beclin 1 [Tat-BECN1] peptide) or decrease (via ATG7 or ATG12 KD), strongly decreased the pluripotency and promoted the differentiation and/or senescence of CSCs. Collectively, these results uncover the link between the NAD+ biosynthesis pathway, CSC transcription factor POU5F1 and pluripotency, and further identify autophagy as a novel regulator of pluripotency of CSCs.
Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disease of the colon with an intractable, recurrent course. Although the goal of UC therapy has recently been to target mucosal healing, the molecular mechanism of mucosal healing remains unknown. In this study, we aimed to elucidate the molecular dynamics related to the proliferation and differentiation of intestinal epithelial cells during cytapheresis therapy in a short duration.
Endoscopy was performed in 26 patients with UC in multicentre hospitals, and biopsy specimens were collected from the rectum before and within two weeks after leukocytapheresis (LCAP). The expression of representative proteins in intestinal epithelial cells and pathological findings was compared before and after LCAP.
The expression of caudal type homeobox 2 (CDX2) and a hes family bHLH transcription factor 1(HES1) markedly increased after LCAP. Patients with endoscopic improvement after LCAP showed the expression of CDX2 before LCAP. Moreover, the number of goblet cells significantly increased after LCAP. Patients without endoscopic improvement after LCAP did not show the expression of CDX2 before LCAP. However, the expression of CDX2 markedly increased after LCAP.
This study suggests that cytapheresis might induce CDX2 expression without affecting the cell proliferation, thus resulting in mucosal healing with goblet cell restoration.
Transcription factor TEA domain family transcription factor 4 (Tead4) is one of the key factors involved in the differentiation of the trophectoderm (TE) in murine embryos. However, knowledge on the roles of TEAD4 in preimplantation development during bovine embryos is currently limited. This study examined the transcript and protein expression patterns of TEAD4 and attempted to elucidate the functions of TEAD4 during bovine preimplantation development using RNA interference. TEAD4 mRNA was found to be upregulated between the 16-cell and morula stages, and nuclear localization of the TEAD4 protein was detected at the morula stage, as well as in subsequent developmental stages. TEAD4 downregulation did not affect embryonic development until the blastocyst stage, and TEAD4-downregulated embryos were capable of forming the TE under both 5% and 21% O2 conditions. Results of gene expression analysis showed that TEAD4 downregulation did not affect the expression levels of POU class 5 transcription factor 1 (OCT-4), NANOG, caudal-type homeobox 2 (CDX2), GATA binding protein 3 (GATA3), and interferon-tau (IFNT). In conclusion, TEAD4 might be dispensable for development until the blastocyst stage and TE differentiation in bovine embryos.
The pathophysiology of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) reflects a balance between mucosal injury and reparative mechanisms. Some regenerating gene (Reg) family members have been reported to be expressed in Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) and to be involved as proliferative mucosal factors in IBD. However, expression of all REG family genes in IBD is still unclear. Here, we analyzed expression of all REG family genes (REG Iα, REG Iβ, REG III, HIP/PAP, and REG IV) in biopsy specimens of UC and CD by real-time RT-PCR. REG Iα, REG Iβ, and REG IV genes were overexpressed in CD samples. REG IV gene was also overexpressed in UC samples. We further analyzed the expression mechanisms of REG Iα, REG Iβ, and REG IV genes in human colon cells. The expression of REG Iα was significantly induced by IL-6 or IL-22, and REG Iβ was induced by IL-22. Deletion analyses revealed that three regions (- 220 to - 211, - 179 to - 156, and - 146 to - 130) in REG Iα and the region (- 274 to- 260) in REG Iβ promoter were responsible for the activation by IL-22/IL-6. The promoters contain consensus transcription factor binding sequences for MZF1, RTEF1/TEAD4, and STAT3 in REG Iα, and HLTF/FOXN2F in REG Iβ, respectively. The introduction of siRNAs for MZF1, RTEF1/TEAD4, STAT3, and HLTF/FOXN2F abolished the transcription of REG Iα and REG Iβ. The gene activation mechanisms of REG Iα/REG Iβ may play a role in colon mucosal regeneration in IBD.
Preimplantation embryos undergo zygotic genome activation and lineage specification resulting in three distinct cell types in the late blastocyst. The molecular mechanisms underlying this progress are largely unknown in bovines. Here, we sought to analyze an extensive set of regulators at the single-cell level to define the events involved in the development of the bovine blastocyst. Using a quantitative microfluidics approach in single cells, we analyzed mRNA levels of 96 genes known to function in early embryonic development and maintenance of stem cell pluripotency in parallel in 384 individual cells from bovine preimplantation embryos. The developmental transitions can be distinguished by distinctive gene expression profiles and we identified NOTCH1, expressed in early developmental stages, while T-box 3 (TBX3) and fibroblast growth factor receptor 4 (FGFR4), expressed in late developmental stages. Three lineages can be segregated in bovine expanded blastocysts based on the expression patterns of lineage-specific genes such as disabled homolog 2 (DAB2), caudal type homeobox 2 (CDX2), ATPase H+/K+ transporting non-gastric alpha2 subunit (ATP12A), keratin 8 (KRT8), and transcription factor AP-2 alpha (TFAP2A) for trophectoderm; GATA binding protein 6 (GATA6) and goosecoid homeobox (GSC) for primitive endoderm; and Nanog homeobox (NANOG), teratocarcinoma-derived growth factor 1 (TDGF1), and PR/SET domain 14 (PRDM14) for epiblast. Moreover, some lineage-specific genes were coexpressed in blastomeres from the morula. The commitment to trophectoderm and inner cell mass lineages in bovines occurs later than in the mouse, and KRT8 might be an earlier marker for bovine trophectoderm cells. We determined that TDGF1 and PRDM14 might play pivotal roles in the primitive endoderm and epiblast specification of bovine blastocysts. Our results shed light on early cell fate determination in bovine preimplantation embryos and offer theoretical support for deriving bovine embryonic stem cells.
Impairment in gut epithelial integrity and barrier function is associated with many diseases. The homeostasis of intestinal barrier is based on a delicate regulation of epithelial proliferation and differentiation. AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a master regulator of energy metabolism, and cellular metabolites are intrinsically involved in epigenetic modifications governing cell differentiation. We aimed to evaluate the regulatory role of AMPK on intestinal epithelial development and barrier function. In this study, AMPK activator (AICAR) improved the barrier function of Caco-2 cells as indicated by increased transepithelial electrical resistance and reduced paracellular FITC-dextran permeability; consistently, AICAR enhanced epithelial differentiation and tight junction formation. Transfection of Caco-2 cells with AMPK WT plasmid, which enhances AMPK activity, improved epithelial barrier function and epithelial differentiation, while K45R (AMPK dominant negative mutant) impaired; these changes were correlated with the expression of caudal type homeobox 2 (CDX2), the key transcription factor committing cells to intestinal epithelial lineage. CDX2 deficiency abolished intestinal differentiation promoted by AMPK activation. Mechanistically, AMPK inactivation was associated with polycomb repressive complex 2 regulated enrichment of H3K27me3, the inhibitory histone modification, and lysine-specific histone demethylase-1-mediated reduction of H3K4me3, a permissive histone modification. Those histone modifications provide a mechanistic link between AMPK and CDX2 expression. Consistently, epithelial AMPK knockout in vivo reduced CDX2 expression, impaired intestinal barrier function, integrity and ultrastructure of tight junction, and epithelial cell migration, promoted intestinal proliferation and exaggerated dextran sulfate sodium-induced colitis. In summary, AMPK enhances intestinal barrier function and epithelial differentiation via promoting CDX2 expression, which is partially mediated by altered histone modifications in the Cdx2 promoter.
Caudal type homeobox 2 (CDX2) has been well-established as a diagnostic marker for colorectal cancer (CRC); however, less is known about its regulation, particularly its potential interactions with the DNA repair proteins, adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) and β-catenin, in a non-transcriptional manner. In the present study, the protein expression of CDX2 was analyzed, depending on the expression of the DNA repair proteins, mismatch repair (MMR), O6-methylguanine DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) and excision repair cross-complementing 1 (ERCC1), and its importance in Wnt signaling was also determined. A total of 101 liver metastases were punched into tissue microarray (TMA) blocks and serial sections were cut for immunohistochemistry. For each protein, an immunoreactive score was generated according to literature data and the scores were fitted to TMA. Subsequently, statistical analysis was performed to compare the levels of expression with each other and with clinical data. CDX2 loss of expression was observed in 38.5% of the CRC liver metastasis cases. A statistically significant association between CDX2 and each of the investigated MMRs was observed: MutL Homolog 1 (P&lt;0.01), MutS protein Homolog (MSH) 2 (P&lt;0.01), MSH6 (P&lt;0.01), and postmeiotic segregation increased 2 (P=0.040). Furthermore, loss of MGMT and ERCC1 was also associated with CDX2 loss (P=0.039 and P&lt;0.01, respectively). In addition, CDX2 and ERCC1 were inversely associated with metastatic tumor size (P=0.038 and P=0.027, respectively). Sustained CDX2 expression was associated with a higher expression of cytoplasmic/membranous β-catenin and with nuclear APC expression (P=0.042 and P&lt;0.01, respectively). In conclusion, CDX2 loss of expression was not a rare event in liver metastasis of CRC and the results suggested that CDX2 may be involved in mechanisms resulting in the loss of DNA repair protein expression, and in turn methylation; however, its exact function in this context remains to be elucidated.
Although the lack of CDX2 expression has recently been proposed as a potential biomarker for a high risk of relapse in patients with stage II and III colon cancer after complete surgical resection, its prognostic role in metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC) remains unclear and warrants investigation.
We identified 145 patients treated at our institution from 2006 to 2016, including 66 patients with CDX2-negative metastatic CRC and a comparison cohort of 79 patients with CDX2-positive metastatic CRC. Overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) for first-line systemic therapy were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. The associations of CDX2 expression with survival were evaluated using Cox proportional hazards regression models.
The prevalence of absent CDX2 expression in our cohort was 5.6%. Patients with CDX2-negative metastatic CRC were significantly more likely to be female, and to have right-sided primary tumors, poorly differentiated histologic features, and distant lymph node metastasis. The median OS for patients with CDX2-negative and -positive metastatic CRC was 8 and 39 months, respectively (hazard ratio [HR], 4.04; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.49-6.54; P &lt; .0001). After adjusting for covariates in a multivariate model, the association of a lack of CDX2 expression and OS remained statistically significant (HR, 4.52; 95% CI, 2.50-8.17; P &lt; .0001). In addition, the median PFS (3 vs. 10 months; HR, 2.23; 95% CI, 1.52-3.27; P &lt; .0001) for first-line chemotherapy was significantly decreased in patients with CDX2-negative metastatic CRC.
The results of the present study show that a lack of CDX2 expression in metastatic CRC is an adverse prognostic feature and a potential negative predictor of the response to chemotherapy.
Caudal type homeobox gene-1 and -2 (CDX-1 and CDX-2), homologues of the Drosophila homeobox gene caudal, encode transcription factors in endoderm derived tissues of the intestine. CDX genes control proliferation and differentiation of intestinal mucosal cells and colon cancer cells. Hirschsprung's Disease (HD) or congenital intestinal aganglionosis, a major developmental anomaly of intestine, which causes functional intestinal obstruction, is frequently associated with enterocolitis. Aetiology of HD-associated enterocolitis (HDEC) remains obscure. Reduction of gut mucosal enteroendocrine cells, and inefficient transfer of the secretory immunoglobulin A across the gut mucosal cell were shown to be associated with enterocolitis in HD patients suggesting that mucosa may directly involve in the pathophysiology of HDEC. This study aims to ascertain whether the CDX-1 and CDX-2 genes, that control the proliferation and differentiation of mucosal cells, play a role in HDEC. Using semi-quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and in situ hybridisation, we analysed the expression of CDX-1 and CDX-2 genes in colon specimens of normal controls, necrotising enterocolitis (NEC) infants, and HD patients with and without enterocolitis. We showed for the first time that CDX-1 and CDX-2 genes were expressed in the colonic mucosal epithelium in normal, NEC and in HD infants. However, the expressions of both genes were reduced in patients with HDEC. Our findings suggest that reduced expression of CDX-1 and CDX-2 genes in mucosa may be associated with the development of HDEC.
In intestinal metaplasia and 30% of gastric carcinomas, MUC2 intestinal mucin and the intestine-specific transcription factors Cdx-1 and Cdx-2 are aberrantly expressed. The involvement of Cdx-1 and Cdx-2 in the intestinal development and their role in transcription of several intestinal genes support the hypothesis that Cdx-1 and/or Cdx-2 play important roles in the aberrant intestinal differentiation program of intestinal metaplasia and gastric carcinoma. To clarify the mechanisms of transcriptional regulation of the MUC2 mucin gene in gastric cells, pGL3 deletion constructs covering 2.6 kb of the human MUC2 promoter were used in transient transfection assays, enabling us to identify a relevant region for MUC2 transcription in all gastric cell lines. To evaluate the role of Cdx-1 and Cdx-2 in MUC2 transcription we performed co-transfection experiments with expression vectors encoding Cdx-1 and Cdx-2. In two of the four gastric carcinoma cell lines and in all colon carcinoma cell lines we observed transactivation of the MUC2 promoter by Cdx-2. Using gel shift assays we identified two Cdx-2 binding sites at -177/-171 and -191/-187. Only simultaneous mutation of the two sites resulted in inhibition of Cdx-2-mediated transactivation of MUC2 promoter, implying that both Cdx-2 sites are active. Finally, stable expression of Cdx-2 in a gastric cell line initially not expressing Cdx-2, led to induction of MUC2 expression. In conclusion, this work demonstrates that Cdx-2 activates the expression of MUC2 mucin gene in gastric cells, inducing an intestinal transdifferentiation phenotype that parallels what is observed both in intestinal metaplasia and some gastric carcinomas.
There have been no detailed reports directly comparing the expression of CDX1 with that of CDX2 in the inflammatory esophageal mucosa and Barrett's epithelium. The present study was designed to examine the expression of CDX 1/2 in inflammatory esophageal mucosa with or without Barrett's epithelium.
The expression of CDX1/2 genes was analyzed using the reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in 34 human esophageal biopsy specimens, and CDX2 expression was also evaluated immunohistochemically, using anti-human CDX2 monoclonal antibody. The biopsy specimens for RNA extraction were taken endoscopically from esophageal mucosa with mucosal break due to gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), Barrett's epithelium, and normal epithelium. The expressions of mucin markers (MUC2) and intestine-specific genes (sucrase-isomal-tase, human defensin-5, alkaline phosphatase) were also comparatively analyzed.
CDX1/2 expression was not found in the normal esophageal mucosa. The prevalence of CDX1/2 mRNA expression was significantly higher in the mucosa with Barrett's epithelium than in the mucosa without Barrett's epithelium. It is noteworthy, however, that the CDX2 mRNA expression was initiated at the stage of esophagitis, when neither CDX1 nor intestine-specific genes had emerged yet. In contrast to CDX2, CDX1 was expressed only in Barrett's epithelium. Immunohistochemical study demonstrated strong and extensive nuclear immunoreactivity for CDX2 in Barrett's epithelium. Furthermore, fine granular cytoplasmic staining was also observed in the cytoplasm in Barrett's epithelium, as well as in inflammatory esophageal mucosa.
We report here, for the first time, that CDX2 is expressed in patients with Barrett's epithelium and inflammatory esophageal mucosa. These findings imply that the expression of CDX2 may be an early event leading to the development of Barrett's esophagus.
The past years have witnessed an increasing number of reports relative to homeobox genes in endoderm-derived tissues. In this review, we focus on the caudal-related Cdx-1 and Cdx-2 homeobox genes to give an overview of the in vivo, in vitro, and ex vivo approaches that emphasize their primary role in intestinal development and in the control of intestinal cell proliferation, differentiation, and identity. The participation of these genes in colon tumorigenesis and their identification as important actors of the oncogenic process are also discussed.
Mouse Cdx and Hox genes presumably evolved from genes on a common ancestor cluster involved in anteroposterior patterning. Drosophila caudal (cad) is involved in specifying the posterior end of the early embryo, and is essential for patterning tissues derived from the most caudal segment, the analia. Two of the three mouse Cdx paralogues, Cdx 1 and Cdx2, are expressed early in a Hox-like manner in the three germ layers. In the nascent paraxial mesoderm, both genes are expressed in cells contributing first to the most rostral, and then to progressively more caudal parts of the vertebral column. Later, expression regresses from the anterior sclerotomes, and is only maintained for Cdx1 in the dorsal part of the somites, and for both genes in the tail bud. Cdx1 null mutants show anterior homeosis of upper cervical and thoracic vertebrae. Cdx2-null embryos die before gastrulation, and Cdx2 heterozygotes display anterior transformations of lower cervical and thoracic vertebrae. We have analysed the genetic interactions between Cdx1 and Cdx2 in compound mutants. Combining mutant alleles for both genes gives rise to anterior homeotic transformations along a more extensive length of the vertebral column than do single mutations. The most severely affected Cdx1 null/Cdx2 heterozygous mice display a posterior shift of their cranio-cervical, cervico-thoracic, thoraco-lumbar, lumbo-sacral and sacro-caudal transitions. The effects of the mutations in Cdx1 and Cdx2 were co-operative in severity, and a more extensive posterior shift of the expression of three Hox genes was observed in double mutants. The alteration in Hox expression boundaries occurred early. We conclude that both Cdx genes cooperate at early stages in instructing the vertebral progenitors all along the axis, at least in part by setting the rostral expression boundaries of Hox genes. In addition, Cdx mutants transiently exhibit alterations in the extent of Hox expression domains in the spinal cord, reminding of the strong effects of overexpressing Cdx genes on Hox gene expression in the neurectoderm. Phenotypical alterations in the peripheral nervous system were observed at mid-gestation stages. Strikingly, the altered phenotype at caudal levels included a posterior truncation of the tail, mildly affecting Cdx2 heterozygotes, but more severely affecting Cdx1/Cdx2 double heterozygotes and Cdx1 null/Cdx2 heterozygotes. Mutations in Cdx1 and Cdx2 therefore also interfere with axis elongation in a cooperative way. The function of Cdx genes in morphogenetic processes during gastrulation and tail bud extension, and their relationship with the Hox genes are discussed in the light of available data in Amphioxus, C. elegans, Drosophila and mice.
The chemokine CCL25 is selectively and constitutively expressed in the small intestinal epithelium and plays an important role in mediating lymphocyte recruitment to this site. In this study, we demonstrate that CCL25 expression in murine small intestinal epithelial cells is independent of signaling through the lymphotoxin beta receptor and is not enhanced by inflammatory stimuli, pathways involved in driving the expression of most other chemokines. We define a transcriptional start site in the CCL25 gene and a region -141 to -5 proximal of exon 1 that is required for minimal promoter activity in the small intestinal epithelial cell lines, MODE-K and mICc12. These cell lines expressed far less CCL25 mRNA than freshly isolated small intestinal epithelial cells indicating that they are missing important factors driving CCL25 expression. The CCL25 promoter contained putative binding sites for the intestinal epithelial-associated Caudal-related homeobox (Cdx) transcription factors Cdx-1 and Cdx-2, and small intestinal epithelial cells but not MODE-K and mICc12 cells expressed Cdx-1 and Cdx-2. EMSA analysis demonstrated that Cdx proteins were present in nuclear extracts from freshly isolated small intestinal epithelial cells but not in MODE-K or mICcl2 cells, and bound to putative Cdx sites within the CCL25 promoter. Finally, cotransfection of MODE-K cells with Cdx transcription factors significantly increased CCL25 promoter activity as well as endogenous CCL25 mRNA levels. Together these results demonstrate a unique pattern of regulation for CCL25 and suggest a role for Cdx proteins in regulating CCL25 transcription.
Adenocarcinomas of the ampulla of Vater demonstrate a characteristic histology but vary significantly in outcome. As a consequence, prognostic factors for these cancers are poorly defined. The caudal-type homeodomain transcription factors 1 (CDX1) and 2 (CDX2) regulate axial development and intestinal differentiation. We assessed the expression of these putative intestinal epithelial-specific transcription factors and their influence on patient outcome.
Fifty-three resected carcinomas of the ampulla of Vater, 31 pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas, and 15 extrahepatic biliary carcinomas were analyzed for CDX1 and CDX2 expression using immunohistochemistry.
Forty percent of carcinomas of the ampulla of Vater but less than 5% of pancreatic and biliary adenocarcinomas expressed CDX. Expression of CDX was associated with a better prognosis (P = .0009). Individually, both CDX1 (P = .02) and CDX2 (P = .02) expression were associated with a survival advantage on univariate analysis. Advanced T stage (P = .02), lymph node metastases (P = .004), and vascular space invasion (P = .0009) were associated with a poor prognosis. Multivariate analysis revealed vascular space invasion (P = .01) and CDX expression (P = .01) to be independent prognostic factors.
Expression of CDX was an independent marker of outcome in patients with resected adenocarcinoma of the ampulla of Vater. Expression of CDX may distinguish good prognosis intestinal-like tumors, which potentially arise within intestinal epithelium, from poorer prognosis pancreatobiliary tumors, which arise in adjacent pancreatic and/or biliary ductal epithelium.
The Cdx-1 and Cdx-2 genes are intestinal transcription factors that may be involved in the regulation of proliferation and differentiation of intestinal epithelial cells. The Cdx-1 and Cdx-2 are expressed in the epithelium of the small intestine and colon but not in the normal epithelium of the esophagus and stomach. Conversely, aberrant Cdx-2 expression is often observed in the esophagus and stomach. We investigated the expression and role of Cdx-2 in intestinal metaplasia and gastric adenocarcinoma.
The gastric tissues obtained endoscopically were analyzed by the reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and histology. The Cdx-1 and Cdx-2 mRNA expression was confirmed and analyzed according to updated Sydney classification. Then, immunohistochemical study with monoclonal anti-Cdx-2 antibody was performed with gastric adenocarcinoma obtained by surgical resection.
The prevalence of Cdx-1 and Cdx-2 mRNA expression was significantly higher in mucosa with intestinal metaplasia than mucosa without intestinal metaplasia. In immunohistochemical study, nuclear staining of Cdx-2 was strong in metaplastic mucosa, but weak in adjacent normal gastric mucosa (p&lt;0.001). The expression of Cdx-2 in gastric adenocarcinoma was lower than in metaplastic mucosa (p&lt;0.001). The Cdx-2 expression was also detected in 97% of intestinal type gastric adenocarcinoma and 61.5% of diffuse type gastric adenocarcinoma (p=0.003).
Aberrant expression of Cdx-2 is observed in intestinal metaplasia and a subset of gastric adenocarcinoma, which is predominant in intestinal-type gastric adenocarcinoma. Therefore, Cdx-2 may play an important role in gastric carcinogenesis, especially in intestinal type adenocarcinoma.
Krüppel-like factor 5 (KLF5) is transcription factor that is expressed by dividing epithelial cells of the intestinal epithelium. KLF5 promotes proliferation in vitro and in vivo and is induced by mitogens and various stress stimuli. To study the role of KLF5 in intestinal epithelial homeostasis, we examined the phenotype of mice with conditional deletion of Klf5 in the gut.
Mice were generated with intestinal-specific deletion of Klf5 (Vil-Cre;Klf5fl/fl). Morphologic changes in the small intestine and colon were examined by immunohistochemistry, immunoblotting, and real-time polymerase chain reaction.
Klf5 mutant mice were born at a normal Mendelian ratio but had high mortality compared with controls. Complete deletion of Klf5 from the intestinal mucosa resulted in neonatal lethality that corresponded with an absence of epithelial proliferation. Variegated intestinal-specific deletion of Klf5 in adult mice resulted in morphologic changes that included a regenerative phenotype, impaired barrier function, and inflammation. Adult mutant mice exhibited defects in epithelial differentiation and migration. These changes were associated with reduced expression of Caudal type homeobox (Cdx) 1, Cdx2, and Eph and ephrin signaling proteins. Concomitantly, Wnt signaling to β-catenin was reduced. Proliferation in regenerative crypts was associated with increased expression of the progenitor cell marker Sox9.
Deletion of Klf5 in the gut epithelium of mice demonstrated that KLF5 maintains epithelial proliferation, differentiation, and cell positioning along the crypt radial axis. Morphologic changes that occur with deletion of Klf5 are associated with disruption of canonical Wnt signaling and increased expression of Sox9.
The human gene MUC4 encodes a large transmembrane mucin that is developmentally regulated and expressed along the undifferentiated pseudostratified epithelium, as early as 6.5 weeks during fetal development. Immunohistochemical analysis of Muc4 expression in developing mouse lung and gastrointestinal tract showed a different spatio-temporal pattern of expression before and after cytodifferentiation. The molecular mechanisms governing MUC4 expression during development are, however, unknown. Hepatocyte nuclear factors (HNF), forkhead box A (FOXA), GATA, and caudal-related homeobox transcription factors (TFs) are known to control cell differentiation of gut endoderm derived-tissues during embryonic development. They also control the expression of cell- and tissue-specific genes and may thus control MUC4 expression. To test this hypothesis, we studied and deciphered the molecular mechanisms responsible for MUC4 transcriptional regulation by these TFs. Experiments using small interfering RNA, cell co-transfection, and site-directed mutagenesis indicated that MUC4 is regulated at the transcriptional level by CDX-1 and -2, HNF-1 alpha and -1 beta, FOXA1/A2, HNF-4 alpha and -4 gamma, and GATA-4, -5, and -6 factors in a cell-specific manner. Binding of TFs was assessed by chromatin immunoprecipitation, and gel-shift assays. Altogether, these results demonstrate that MUC4 is a target gene of endodermal TFs and thus point out an important role for these TFs in regulating MUC4 expression during epithelial differentiation during development, cancer, and repair.
The Cdx (Caudal-type homeobox) group of ParaHox genes (Cdx1, Cdx2 and Cdx4 in the mouse) perform multiple functions in mammalian development. Cdx1 is concerned with axial positional information, and its deletion appears to have no important effect other than a disturbance of axial patterning. In contrast, Cdx2 is required for trophoblast differentiation, axial patterning and extension, as well as for morphological specification (i.e. patterning) of gut endoderm. Cdx4-knockout animals do not present an abnormal phenotype, but, when combined with Cdx2 haploinsufficiency, present a dramatic picture involving abnormal cloacal specification. The latter is probably due in large part to defective paraxial mesodermal development in the caudal region, but may also involve defective endodermal growth. A significant degree of redundancy is apparent between the Cdx genes with respect to caudal extension and possibly also during gut development.
The mechanism of transformation to intestinal metaplasia in Barrett's oesophagus has not been clarified. We previously reported that bile acids activate the Cdx2 promoter via nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB) and stimulate production of Cdx2 protein in oesophageal keratinocytes with a resulting production of intestinal type mucin. In addition to Cdx2, Cdx1 may play an important role in the development of Barrett's oesophagus. Therefore, we studied the direct effects of bile acids on the expression of Cdx1 as well as the precise mechanisms of Cdx1 expression in cultured oesophageal squamous epithelial cells. Furthermore, we investigated the relationship between Cdx1 and Cdx2 expression in cultured oesophageal squamous epithelial cells.
A rat model of Barrett's oesophagus was produced by anastomosing the oesophagus and jejunum. The expression of Cdx1 was investigated by immunohistochemistry, while the response of that expression to bile acids was studied using a Cdx1 promoter luciferase assay. In addition, oesophageal squamous epithelial cells were transfected with a Cdx1 or Cdx2 expression vector, after which their possible transformation to intestinal-type epithelial cells was investigated.
In our Barrett's rat model, the metaplastic epithelium and adjoining squamous epithelium strongly expressed Cdx1. Further, the bile acids mixture dose-dependently increased Cdx1 promoter activity and Cdx1 protein in oesophageal epithelial cells. Transfection of the Cdx1 expression vector in cultured oesophageal epithelial cells induced production of Cdx2 protein.
Bile acid-induced sequential expression of Cdx1 followed by Cdx2 may have an important role in the development of Barrett's epithelium.
Barrett's esophagus, a squamous-to-columnar cell metaplasia that develops as a result of chronic gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), is a risk factor for esophageal adenocarcinoma. The molecular events underlying the pathogenesis of Barrett's metaplasia are poorly understood, but recent studies suggest that interactions among developmental signaling pathways, morphogenetic factors, and Caudal homeobox (Cdx) genes play key roles. Strong expression of Cdx genes normally is found in the intestine but not in the esophagus and stomach. When mice are genetically engineered so that their gastric cells express Cdx, the stomach develops a metaplastic, intestinal-type epithelium similar to that of Barrett's esophagus. Exposure to acid and bile has been shown to activate the Cdx promoter in certain esophageal cell lines, and Cdx expression has been found in inflamed esophageal squamous epithelium and in the specialized intestinal metaplasia of Barrett's esophagus. Barrett's metaplasia must be sustained by stem cells, which might be identified by putative, intestinal stem cell markers like leucine-rich repeat-containing G protein-coupled receptor 5 (Lgr5) and doublecortin and CaM kinase-like-1 (DCAMKL-1). Emerging concepts in tumor biology suggest that Barrett's cancers may develop from growth-promoting mutations in metaplastic stem cells or their progenitor cell progeny. This report reviews the roles of developmental signaling pathways and the Cdx genes in the development of normal gut epithelia and the potential mechanisms whereby GERD may induce the esophageal expression of Cdx genes and other morphogenetic factors that mediate the development of Barrett's metaplasia. The role of stem cells in the development of metaplasia and in carcinogenesis and the potential for therapies directed at those stem cells also is addressed.
Barrett's esophagus (BE), the premalignant lesion of esophageal adenocarcinoma, is believed to develop as a result of chronic gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Approximately 10 % of subjects with GERD progress to BE. Genetic, epigenetic and other risk factors may contribute to this inter-individual variability. Caudal type homeobox 1 (Cdx1) and Caudal type homeobox 2 (Cdx2) play important regulatory roles in the development of human BE.
To determine associations between Cdx1 and Cdx2 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and BE.
Genomic DNA was extracted from blood samples collected from BE (n = 109) and GERD (n = 223) patients for genotyping of 5 SNPs each of Cdx1 and Cdx2 using TaqMan allelic discrimination assays. Odds ratios and 95 % confidence intervals of SNPs and haplotypes were calculated with a logistic regression model adjusted for factors including age, sex and hiatal hernia. Interactions between genetic variants and these three risk factors were also analyzed.
Older age (≥50 years), male sex and hiatal hernia were significantly associated with BE (P &lt; 0.001). Five variants of Cdx1 SNPs (rs3776082, rs717746 and rs3776083), one Cdx1 haplotype, and three variants of Cdx2 SNPs (rs4769585 and rs3812863) were associated with BE (P &lt; 0.05). Statistically significant interactions were detected between most of these SNPs and the three risk factors (P &lt; 0.05).
Certain SNPs of Cdx1 and Cdx2 and their interactions with other risk factors are associated with BE, and may contribute to human susceptibility to BE.
The intestine-specific transcription factor, caudal type homeobox-1 (CDX1), is a candidate tumor suppressor gene that plays key roles in regulating intestinal epithelial differentiation and proliferation. It is aberrantly down-regulated in colorectal cancers and colon cancer-derived cell lines by promoter hypermethylation. Since the effects of oxidative stress on the transcription of tumor suppressor genes are largely unknown, this study explored the epigenetic alterations that occur during reactive oxygen species (ROS)-induced silencing of CDX1 in colorectal cancer cells. Oxidative stress by hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) down-regulated CDX1 mRNA levels and protein expression in the human colorectal cancer cell line, T-84. This down-regulation was abolished by pretreatment with the ROS scavenger, N-acetylcysteine. In addition, the DNA methylation inhibitor, 5-aza-2-deoxycytidine (5-Aza-dC) markedly attenuated the decrease in mRNA and protein expression levels induced by H2O2. Moreover, methylation-specific PCR data revealed that H2O2 treatment increased CDX1 promoter methylation, and treatment with 5-Aza-dC reversed this effect, suggesting that an epigenetic regulatory mechanism triggered by ROS-induced methylation may be involved in CDX1 expression. Furthermore, H2O2 treatment resulted in up-regulation of DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) and histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) expression and activity, and enhanced the association between DNMT1 and HDAC1. Taken together, these results suggest that ROS-induced oxidative stress silences the tumor suppressor CDX1 through epigenetic regulation, and may therefore be associated with the progression of colorectal cancer.
This study was aimed to investigate the expression and clinical significance of CDX1, CDX2 and CDX4 genes in acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL). Expressions of CDX1, CDX2, and CDX4 in 51 adult acute lymphocytic leukemia patients and 14 healthy subjects were detected by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The results indicated that CDX1, CDX2 and CDX4 were not expressed in 14 healthy persons and 15 CR ALL patients, the positive expression rate of CDX2 gene in de novo ALL patients was 60.8%, while it obviously decreased in patients with complete remission (CR) (p &lt; 0.05); the expression of CDX2 was increased again in relapsed patients (81.8%). When the expression of CDX2 was analyzed in different risk groups of ALL patients, the CDX2 expression rate in high risk (HR) patients was 91.7%, and that in the standard risk (SR) group was 45.7%. Furthermore, analyses of CDX1 and CDX4 expression in series of ALL samples did not show the expression of these genes. In patients with adult ALL at diagnosis and relapse, the CR rate of patients with CDX2 positive expression was lower than that of patients with CDX2 negative expression (p &lt; 0.05). The median survival time in CDX2 positive expression patients was shorter than that in negative expression patient. It is concluded that expression of CDX2 may correlated with pathogenesis and relapse of adult ALL, but the expression of CDX1 and CDX4 don' t associated with pathogenesis and relapse of adult ALL; the CR rate and prognosis of patients with CDX2 positive expression is lower and poor. The expression of CDX2 may be used as a marker for occurrence, relapse and poor prognosis of adult ALL patients.
The caudal-type homeobox 1 (CDX1) transcription factor is a member of the caudal-related homeobox transcription factor gene family and has been reported to be down-regulated in a variety of cancers. However, the expression status and significance of CDX1 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is still controversial, and little is known about the role of CDX1 in HCC·In our previous study, we investigated the expression and clinical significance of CDX1 in HCC samples from 313 HCC patients. We found CDX1 was strikingly down-regulated in HCC samples. CDX1 expression was associated with poor differentiation (P = 0.002), and patients with low CDX1 expression had a significantly poorer prognosis. A subgroup analysis revealed a difference in prognosis between groups with low and high CDX1 expression among patients who had tumors &lt;5 cm in size and who were alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) negative. Moreover, low expression was more frequently observed in the early recurrence group (within 2 years, P = 0.002). In addition, multivariate Cox regression analysis indicated that the CDX1 expression level, tumor size, presence of hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg), vascular invasion, and presence of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) were independent risk factors for HCC recurrence, and the CDX1 expression level, tumor size, tumor number, and presence of HBsAg were independent predictor of overall survival of HCC patients. In conclusion, the downregulation of CDX1 is associated with poor prognosis; and it may serve as a novel predictor of the prognosis of HCC patients after curative resection. 
Barrett's oesophagus (BO) is a complicated condition at the gastroesophageal junction in which normal squamous epithelium is changed to columnar and leads to oesophageal adenocarcinoma (OA). In the past decades, the prevalence of Barrett's disease and mortality rate of adenocarcinoma has significantly increased throughout the word. Data has shown that molecular pathogenesis of disease has not been clearly identified. However, a wide-range and successful administration of probiotics in cancer and gastrointestinal diseases has lead to the investigation into the possible inhibitory role of probiotics in oesophageal cancer. This study was conducted to evaluate the inhibitory effect of probiotics on the expression of biomarkers in an in vitro model. Two different Barrett's oesophageal cell lines were selected to co-culture with B. longum and Lactobacillus acidophilus to measure expression of IL-18, TNFα, p53 (tumour suppressor gene), cyclooxygenase 2 and CDX1 (caudal type homeobox 1) genes. In addition, two different aspects of probiotic administration, therapeutic and prophylactic test were also examined. Results showed that micro-organisms could inhibit expression of biomarkers and therapeutic culture conditions were more effective than prophylactic tests. The results obtained suggest that it is possible to incorporate the administration of probiotics in BO and OA prevention. 
The mTOR kinase inhibitor rapamycin (sirolimus) is a drug with potent immunosuppressive and antiproliferative properties. We found that rapamycin induces the TGFbeta/Smad signaling cascade in rat mesangial cells (MC) as depicted by the nuclear translocation of phospho-Smads 2, -3 and Smad-4, respectively. Concomitantly, rapamycin increases the nuclear DNA binding of receptor (R)- and co-Smad proteins to a cognate Smad-binding element (SBE) which in turn causes an increase in profibrotic gene expression as exemplified by the connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) and plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1). Using small interfering (si)RNA we demonstrate that Smad 2/3 activation by rapamycin depends on its endogenous receptor FK binding protein 12 (FKBP12). Mechanistically, Smad induction by rapamycin is initiated by an increase in active TGFbeta(1) as shown by ELISA and by the inhibitory effects of a neutralizing TGFbeta antibody. Using an activin receptor-like kinase (ALK)-5 inhibitor and by siRNA against the TGFbeta type II receptor (TGFbeta-RII) we furthermore demonstrate a functional involvement of both types of TGFbeta receptors. However, rapamycin did not compete with TGFbeta for TGFbeta-receptor binding as found in radioligand-binding assay. Besides SB203580, a specific inhibitor of the p38 MAPK, the reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenger N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC) and a cell-permeable superoxide dismutase (SOD) mimetic strongly abrogated the stimulatory effects of rapamycin on Smad 2 and 3 phosphorylation. Furthermore, the rapid increase in dichlorofluorescein (DCF) formation implies that rapamycin mainly acts through ROS. In conclusion, activation of the profibrotic TGFbeta/Smad signaling cascade accompanies the immunosuppressive and antiproliferative actions of rapamycin.
The brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) Val66Met polymorphism (rs6265) may impact on the in-vivo binding of important serotonergic structures such as the serotonin transporter (5-HTT) and the serotonin-1A (5-HT1A) receptor. Previous positron emission tomography (PET) studies on the association between Val66Met and 5-HTT and 5-HT1A binding potential (BPND) have demonstrated equivocal results.
We conducted an imaging genetics study investigating the effect of Val66Met genotype on 5-HTT or 5-HT1A BPND in 92 subjects. Forty-one subjects (25 healthy subjects and 16 depressive patients) underwent genotyping for Val66Met and PET imaging with the 5-HTT specific radioligand [11C]DASB. Additionally, in 51 healthy subjects Val66Met genotypes and 5-HT1A binding with the radioligand [carbonyl-11C]WAY-100635 were ascertained. Voxel-wise and region of interest-based analyses of variance were used to examine the influence of Val66Met on 5-HTT and 5-HT1A BPND.
No significant differences of 5-HTT nor 5-HT1A BPND between BDNF Val66Met genotype groups (val/val vs. met-carrier) were detected. There was no interaction between depression and Val66Met genotype status.
In line with previous data, our work confirms an absent effect of BDNF Val66Met on two major serotonergic structures. These results could suggest that altered protein expression associated with genetic variants, might be compensated in vivo by several levels of unknown feedback mechanisms. In conclusion, Val66Met genotype status is not associated with changes of in-vivo binding of 5-HTT and 5-HT1A receptors in human subjects.
Huntingtin-associated Protein 1 (HAP1) is expressed in neurons and endocrine cells, and is critical for postnatal survival in mice. HAP1 shares a conserved "HAP1_N" domain with TRAfficking Kinesin proteins TRAK1 and TRAK2 (vertebrate), Milton (Drosophila) and T27A3.1 (C. elegans). HAP1, TRAK1 and TRAK2 have a degree of common function, particularly regarding intracellular receptor trafficking. However, TRAK1, TRAK2 and Milton (which have a "Milt/TRAK" domain that is absent in human and rodent HAP1) differ in function to HAP1 in that they are mitochondrial transport proteins, while HAP1 has emerging roles in starvation response. We have investigated HAP1 function by examining its evolution, and upstream gene promoter sequences. We performed phylogenetic analyses of the HAP1_N domain family of proteins, incorporating HAP1 orthologues (identified by genomic synteny) from 5 vertebrate classes, and also searched the Dictyostelium proteome for a common ancestor. Computational analyses of mammalian HAP1 gene promoters were performed to identify phylogenetically conserved regulatory motifs.
We found that as recently as marsupials, HAP1 contained a Milt/TRAK domain and was more similar to TRAK1 and TRAK2 than to eutherian HAP1. The Milt/TRAK domain likely arose post multicellularity, as it was absent in the Dictyostelium proteome. It was lost from HAP1 in the eutherian lineage, and also from T27A3.1 in C. elegans. The HAP1 promoter from human, mouse, rat, rabbit, horse, dog, Tasmanian devil and opossum contained common sites for transcription factors involved in cell cycle, growth, differentiation, and stress response. A conserved arrangement of regulatory elements was identified, including sites for caudal-related homeobox transcription factors (CDX1 and CDX2), and myc-associated factor X (MAX) in the region of the TATA box. CDX1 and CDX2 are intestine-enriched factors, prompting investigation of HAP1 protein expression in the human duodenum. HAP1 was localized to singly dispersed mucosal cells, including a subset of serotonin-positive enterochromaffin cells.
We have identified eutherian HAP1 as an evolutionarily recent adaptation of a vertebrate TRAK protein-like ancestor, and found conserved CDX1/CDX2 and MAX transcription factor binding sites near the TATA box in mammalian HAP1 gene promoters. We also demonstrated that HAP1 is expressed in endocrine cells of the human gut.
Homeobox genes, including HOX and non-HOX genes, have been identified to be expressed aberrantly in solid tumors. In gastrointestinal (GI) cancers, most studies have focused on the function of non-HOX genes including caudal-related homeobox transcription factor 1 (CDX1) and CDX2. CDX2 is a crucial factor in the development of pre-cancerous lesions such as Barrett's esophagus or intestinal metaplasia in the stomach, and its tumor suppressive role has been investigated in colorectal cancers. Recently, several HOX genes were reported to have specific roles in GI cancers; for example, HOXA13 in esophageal squamous cell cancer and HOXB7 in stomach and colorectal cancers. HOXD10 is upregulated in colorectal cancer while it is silenced epigenetically in gastric cancer. Thus, it is essential to examine the differential expression pattern of various homeobox genes in specific tumor types or cell lineages, and understand their underlying mechanisms. In this review, we summarize the available research on homeobox genes and present their potential value for the prediction of prognosis in GI cancers.
Background. The objectives of this study were to determine the spatiotemporal distribution of human caudal-type homeobox proteins CDX1, CDX2 and CDX4 during development of the hindgut and anorectum in the embryo and to explore the possible roles of CDX genes during morphogenesis of the hindgut and anorectum. Methods. Embryos (89) were cut into sections serially and sagittally. From gestation weeks 4-9, CDX1, CDX2 and CDX4 proteins were detected on the caudal midline by immunohistochemical staining. Results. During week 4, extensive immunoreactivity of CDX1, CDX2 and CDX4 was detected in the dorsal urorectal septum, urogenital sinus and hindgut. From weeks 5-7, CDX1-, CDX2- and CDX4- positive cells were detected mainly in the mesenchyme of the urorectal septum and hindgut. The levels of CDX2 and CDX4 immunoreactivity were lower compared to CDX1. During weeks 8 and 9, the anorectal epithelium stained positive for CDX1 and CDX4, and the anal epithelium was positive for CDX2. Conclusions. The CDX proteins are constantly distributed during development of the hindgut and anorectum and exhibit overlapping distribution patterns in the cloaca/hindgut, suggesting they are important in the morphogenesis of the human hindgut and anorectum. CDX genes might be involved in development of the anorectal epithelium after the rectum has separated from the urorectal septum. 
This study aimed to determine the spatiotemporal expression of caudal-type homeobox genes (CDX1, CDX2 and CDX4) during development of the midgut in human embryos and to explore the possible roles of CDX genes during the morphogenesis of human midgut. Human embryos (n=28) were sectioned serially and sagittally and CDX1, CDX2 and CDX4 proteins were detected on the midline from the 5th to 9th weeks of gestation by immunohistochemical staining.
CDX1, CDX2 and CDX4 proteins were weakly expressed in epithelium and mesenchyme of the midgut in the 6th and 7th weeks of gestation and reached estimated optimal level on the 8th and 9th weeks of gestation. In the 9th week of gestation, immunoreactivities specific to CDX1, CDX2 and CDX4 were restricted in epithelium of the midgut.
CDX1, CDX2 and CDX4 proteins began to express in human midgut in the 6th week of gestation. From the 6th to 9th week of gastation, the expression of CDX1, CDX2 and CDX4 proteins gradually increase and exhibited overlapping expression patterns, suggesting that CDX genes may be involved in early development of the epithelium of human midgut. Cross-regulatory interactions may exist among CDX genes with respect to human midgut development.
The pathogenesis of precursor lesions of gastrointestinal tumors is manifested in many ways. In the esophagus an aberrant genetic expression of intestinal transcription factors, such as CDX2 is initiated by local environment factors. During the subsequent dysplasia to carcinoma sequence, chromosomal gain and loss of genes occurs. A 4-color fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) assay can be applied in dysplasia as well as in Barrett's adenocarcinoma to define prognostic marker combinations. In the gastric carcinogenesis sequence the gene expression of CDX1 is regulatively dependent on an interplay between inflammation and promotor methylation. In the colon sessile serrated adenomas show a sequence with initial BRAF mutation and late onset of MLH1 promotor hypermethylation with consecutive potential cancer progression. This event is accompanied by an increase of intraepithelial lymphocytes, which is an easy to use tool for routine diagnostics using H&amp;E sections. Next generation sequencing (NGS) investigations of germline mutations in colorectal cancer revealed a spectrum of mutations with low penetration in the field of mismatch repair proteins as well as the APC gene. An individual risk stratification for penetration of these germline mutations is necessary. In conclusion, genetics, phenotypes and terminology of gastrointestinal precursor lesions are unified to a mutually influencing concept within medicine.
The packaging of genomic DNA into nucleosomes creates a barrier to transcription that can be relieved through ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling via complexes such as the switch-sucrose non-fermentable (SWI-SNF) chromatin remodeling complex. The SWI-SNF complex remodels chromatin via conformational or positional changes of nucleosomes, thereby altering the access of transcriptional machinery to target genes. The SWI-SNF complex has limited ability to bind to sequence-specific elements, and, therefore, its recruitment to target loci is believed to require interaction with DNA-associated transcription factors. The Cdx family of homeodomain transcript ion factors (Cdx1, Cdx2, and Cdx4) are essential for a number of developmental programs in the mouse. Cdx1 and Cdx2 also regulate intestinal homeostasis throughout life. Although a number of Cdx target genes have been identified, the basis by which Cdx members impact their transcription is poorly understood. We have found that Cdx members interact with the SWI-SNF complex and make direct contact with Brg1, a catalytic member of SWI-SNF. Both Cdx2 and Brg1 co-occupy a number of Cdx target genes, and both factors are necessary for transcriptional regulation of such targets. Finally, Cdx2 and Brg1 occupancy occurs coincident with chromatin remodeling at some of these loci. Taken together, our findings suggest that Cdx transcription factors regulate target gene expression, in part, through recruitment of Brg1-associated SWI-SNF chromatin remodeling activity.
The Cdx transcription factors play essential roles in primitive hematopoiesis in the zebrafish where they exert their effects, in part, through regulation of hox genes. Defects in hematopoiesis have also been reported in Cdx mutant murine embryonic stem cell models, however, to date no mouse model reflecting the zebrafish Cdx mutant hematopoietic phenotype has been described. This is likely due, in part, to functional redundancy among Cdx members and the early lethality of Cdx2 null mutants. To circumvent these limitations, we used Cre-mediated conditional deletion to assess the impact of concomitant loss of Cdx1 and Cdx2 on murine primitive hematopoiesis. We found that Cdx1/Cdx2 double mutants exhibited defects in primitive hematopoiesis and yolk sac vasculature concomitant with reduced expression of several genes encoding hematopoietic transcription factors including Scl/Tal1. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis revealed that Scl was occupied by Cdx2 in vivo, and Cdx mutant hematopoietic yolk sac differentiation defects could be rescued by expression of exogenous Scl. These findings demonstrate critical roles for Cdx members in murine primitive hematopoiesis upstream of Scl.
The NEDD8 conjugation pathway modulates the ubiquitination and activity of a wide range of intracellular proteins, and its blockade by pevonedistat is emerging as a promising therapeutic approach in various cancer settings. However, systematic characterization of pevonedistat efficacy in specific tumor types and definition of response predictors are still missing.
We investigated in vitro sensitivity to pevonedistat in 122 colorectal cancer (CRC) cell lines by an ATP-based proliferation assay and evaluated apoptosis and DNA content by flow cytometry. Associations between pevonedistat sensitivity and CRC molecular features were assessed by Student's t test. A 184-gene transcriptional predictor was generated in cell lines and applied to 87 metastatic CRC samples for which patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) were available. In vivo reponse to pevonedistat was assessed in PDX models (≥5 mice per group). All statistical tests were two-sided.
Sixteen (13.1%) cell lines displayed a marked response to pevonedistat, featuring DNA re-replication, proliferative block, and increased apoptosis. Pevonedistat sensitivity did not statistically significantly correlate with microsatellite instability or mutations in KRAS or BRAF and was functionally associated with low EGFR pathway activity. While ineffective on predicted resistant PDXs, in vivo administration of pevonedistat statistically significantly impaired growth of five out of six predicted sensitive models (P &lt; .01). In samples from CRC patients, transcriptional prediction of pevonedistat sensitivity was associated with poor prognosis after surgery (hazard ratio [HR] = 2.49, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.34 to 4.62, P = .003) and early progression under cetuximab treatment (HR = 3.59, 95% CI = 1.60 to 8.04, P &lt; .001). Histological and immunohistochemical analyses revealed that the pevonedistat sensitivity signature captures transcriptional traits of poor differentiation and high-grade mucinous adenocarcinoma.
These results highlight NEDD8-pathway inhibition by pevonedistat as a potentially effective treatment for poorly differentiated, clinically aggressive CRC.
CDX2 is widely used as a sensitive and specific immunomarker for colorectal carcinoma (CRC), but neither its sensitivity nor its specificity is absolute. The aim of this study was to compare CDX1 and A33 with CDX2 as immunomarkers for CRC.
As a pilot study, whole sections of 51 cases of liver metastatic carcinoma with different origins-colorectum (n = 32), breast (n = 3), oesophagogastric tract (n = 4), lung (n = 3), pancreas (n = 8), and prostate (n = 1)-were immunostained with CDX1, CDX2, and A33. A33 showed higher sensitivity as a CRC immunomarker, greater interobserver reproducibility for assessment of expression and less background cross-reactivity than CDX1. Therefore, only A33 was compared with CDX2 for a tissue microarray (TMA)-based study of primary adenocarcinomas with different origins: CRC (n = 55), liver deposits of metastatic CRC (n = 60), breast (n = 101), lung (n = 40), oesophagogastric tract (n = 134), ovary (n = 67), pancreas (n = 77), and prostate (n = 56). When the whole section and TMA cases of CRC were combined, A33 had a sensitivity of 95.9% and CDX2 had a sensitivity of 97.2%. When the whole section and TMA cases of non-colorectal carcinomas were combined, A33 had a specificity of 85.4% as a marker of CRC and CDX2 had a specificity of 64.3%. The higher specificity of A33 than of CDX2 as a CRC immunomarker was particularly seen among pancreatic and ovarian carcinomas. Furthermore, unlike what was seen with CDX2, none of the prostatic and lung carcinomas studied showed A33 positivity.
A33 shows similar sensitivity to but is more specific than CDX2 as an immunomarker of CRC.
CDX1 and CDX2 are possibly predictive biomarkers in colorectal cancer. We combined digitally-guided (next generation) TMA construction (ngTMA) and the utility of digital image analysis (DIA) to assess accuracy, tumour heterogeneity and the selective impact of different combined intensity-percentage levels on prognosis.CDX1 and CDX2 immunohistochemistry was performed on ngTMAs covering normal tissue, tumour centre and invasive front. The percentages of all epithelial cells per staining intensity per core were analysed digitally. Beyond classical prognosis analysis following REMARK guidelines, we investigated pre-analytical conditions, three different types of heterogeneity (mosaic-like, targeted and haphazard) and influences on cohort segregation and patient selection. The ngTMA-DIA approach produced robust biomarker data with infrequent core loss and excellent on-target punching. The detailed assessment of tumour heterogeneity could - except for a certain diffuse mosaic-like heterogeneity - exclude differences between the invasive front and tumour centre, as well as detect haphazard clonal heterogeneous elements. Moreover, lower CDX1 and CDX2 counts correlated with mucinous histology, higher TNM stage, higher tumour grade and worse survival (p &lt; 0.01, all). Different protein expression intensity levels shared comparable prognostic power and a great overlap in patient selection. The combination of ngTMA with DIA enhances accuracy and controls for biomarker analysis. Beyond the confirmation of CDX1 and CDX2 as prognostically relevant markers in CRC, this study highlights the greater robustness of CDX2 in comparison to CDX1. For the assessment of CDX2 protein loss, cut-points as percentage data of complete protein loss can be deduced as a recommendation.
Caudal type homeobox 2 (CDX2) is expressed in intestinal epithelial cells and plays a role in gut development and homeostasis by regulating cell proliferation. However, whether CDX2 cooperates with the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) and Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathways to stimulate cell proliferation remains unknown. The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of CDX2 on the proliferation of porcine jejunum epithelial cells (IPEC-J2) and the correlation between CDX2, the mTORC1 and Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathways. CDX2 overexpression and knockdown cell culture models were established to explore the regulation of CDX2 on both pathways. Pathway-specific antagonists were used to verify the effects. The results showed that CDX2 overexpression increased IPEC-J2 cell proliferation and activated both the mTORC1 and Wnt/β-catenin pathways, and that CDX2 knockdown decreased cell proliferation and inhibited both pathways. Furthermore, the mTORC1 and Wnt/β-catenin pathway-specific antagonist rapamycin and XAV939 (3,5,7,8-tetrahydro-2-[4-(trifluoromethyl)]-4H -thiopyrano[4,3-d]pyrimidin-4-one) both suppressed the proliferation of IPEC-J2 cells overexpressing CDX2, and that the combination of rapamycin and XAV939 had an additive effect. Regardless of whether the cells were treated with rapamycin or XAV939 alone or in combination, both mTORC1 and Wnt/β-catenin pathways were down-regulated, accompanied by a decrease in CDX2 expression. Taken together, our data indicate that CDX2 stimulates porcine intestinal epithelial cell proliferation by activating the mTORC1 and Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathways.
To investigate the effects and possible mechanisms of action of Curcuma wenyujin Y. H. Chen et C. Ling n-Butyl alcohol extract (CWNAE) on repression of human gastric cancer (GC) AGS cell invasion induced by co-culturing with Helicobacter pylori (HP).
AGS cells were cultured with HP of positive or negative cytotoxin-associated gene A (CagA) and vacuolating cytotoxin gene A (VacA) expression (CagA+/- or VacA+/-) and divided into 5 group. Group A was cultured without HP as a control, Group B with HPCagA+VacA+, Group C with HPCagA-VacA-, Group D with HPCagA+VacA+ and CWNAE, and Group E with HPCagA-VacA- and CWNAE. Methylthiazolyldiphenyl-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) and tumor invasion assays, examinations of morphology and ultramicroscopic structures, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and Western blots were performed to measure the effects and uncover the mechanisms behind these effects of HPCagA+VacA+ and CWNAE on the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of AGS cells.
The 10% inhibitory concentration of CWNAE against AGS cells after a 48 h incubation was 19.73±1.30 μg/mL. More AGS cells were elongated after co-culturing with HPCagA+VacA+ than after culturing with HPCagA-VacA-. In tumor invasion assays, HPCagA+VacA+ significantly enhanced the invasiveness of AGS cells compared to the other experimental groups (all P value &lt;0.05), and this effect was inhibited by CWNAE. Treatment with CWNAE normalized tight junctions and reduced the number of pseudopodia of AGS cells co-cultured with HPCagA+VacA+. HPCagA+VacA+ up-regulated zincfinger ebox binding homeobox 1 (ZEB1) in AGS cells after co-culturing for 24 h. Expression of caudal type homeobox transcription factor (CDX-2) and claudin-2 was significantly increased by HPCagA+VacA+ (P&lt;0.05), but not by HPCagA-VacA-.
HPCagA+VacA+ promoted the invasiveness of AGS cells through up-regulation of ZEB1 transcription and claudin-2 and CDX-2 expression. CWNAE inhibited these effects of HPCagA+VacA+ on AGS cells by down-regulating ZEB1 transcription, and CDX-2 and claudin-2 expression.
Although the intestine plays the major role in 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1,25(OH)2D3] action on calcium homeostasis, the mechanisms involved remain incompletely understood. The established model of 1,25(OH)2D3-regulated intestinal calcium absorption postulates a critical role for the duodenum. However, the distal intestine is where 70% to 80% of ingested calcium is absorbed. To test directly the role of 1,25(OH)2D3 and the vitamin D receptor (VDR) in the distal intestine, three independent knockout (KO)/transgenic (TG) lines expressing VDR exclusively in the ileum, cecum, and colon were generated by breeding VDR KO mice with TG mice expressing human VDR (hVDR) under the control of the 9.5-kb caudal type homeobox 2 promoter. Mice from one TG line (KO/TG3) showed low VDR expression in the distal intestine (&lt;50% of the levels observed in KO/TG1, KO/TG2, and wild-type mice). In the KO/TG mice, hVDR was not expressed in the duodenum, jejunum, kidney, or other tissues. Growth arrest, elevated parathyroid hormone level, and hypocalcemia of the VDR KO mice were prevented in mice from KO/TG lines 1 and 2. Microcomputed tomography analysis revealed that the expression of hVDR in the distal intestine of KO/TG1 and KO/TG2 mice rescued the bone defects associated with systemic VDR deficiency, including growth plate abnormalities and altered trabecular and cortical parameters. KO/TG3 mice showed rickets, but less severely than VDR KO mice. These findings show that expression of VDR exclusively in the distal intestine can prevent abnormalities in calcium homeostasis and bone mineralization associated with systemic VDR deficiency.
In 2014 World Health Organization criteria, seromucinous carcinoma was defined as a new histological subtype in ovarian carcinomas, but "seromucinous carcinoma" was not defined in endometrial carcinomas. The aim of this study was to identify seromucinous carcinoma resembling ovarian seromucinous carcinoma in endometrial carcinomas, and to evaluate the clinical significance for prognoses of the patients.
Central pathological review was conducted for patients with endometrioid carcinoma of the endometrium treated by primary surgery at our hospital between 1990 and 2013.
Among 340 cases included in the study, no case had all tumor cells resembling ovarian seromucinous carcinoma in all specimens, and 31 cases (9.1%) had seromucinous component in combination with endometrioid carcinomas. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed seromucinous component had positive reactivity for cytokeratin (CK) 7, and negative reactivity for CK20 and caudal type homeobox 2 (CDX2) in all cases. Seromucinous component showed lower immunoreactivity of estrogen receptor and progesterone receptor, compared with endometrioid carcinoma component. Progression-free survival of the cases with seromucinous component was better than those without seromucinous component (p=0.049).
Seromucinous component was identified in approximately 10% of endometrioid carcinoma, and could be a histological predictor for prognosis.
A 78-year-old man underwent a detailed examination by upper gastrointestinal endoscopy for the complaint of epigastric pain. The examination revealed a hemicircumferential type 2 tumor in the descending duodenum. A subsequent biopsy led to a diagnosis of neuroendocrine carcinoma. Subtotal stomach-preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy was performed. The lesion was composed of small- and large-cell neuroendocrine carcinomas. The large-cell type component was positive for both caudal homeobox protein 2 and the cluster of differentiation 138, whereas the small-cell type component was negative for both. Our report may provide valuable information regarding the pathogenesis of neuroendocrine carcinoma.
Approximately 15% of colorectal cancer (CRC) cases exhibit microsatellite instability (MSI), which appears to be associated with unique biological behavior. The present study presents a case of appendiceal carcinoma associated with MSI that responded well to adjuvant chemotherapy. Clinical, pathological and immunohistochemical (IHC) characteristics have been described. The 60-year-old male patient had suffered from recurrent lower abdominal pain associated with abdominal distention for 6 months; then, following an acute attack, he was subjected to laparoscopic appendectomy. The histopathological examination revealed moderately differentiated appendiceal adenocarcinoma with mucinous areas, without lymphovascular or perineural invasion. The IHC examination was positive for keratin-20 and caudal type homeobox 2, and negative for MutL Homolog 1, MutS Homolog (MSH) 2 and MSH-6. A postoperative colonoscopy revealed diverticulosis, without the presence of polyps or tumors. However, an abdominal axial computerized tomography scan revealed thickening of the distal portion of the appendix, increased density of the greater omentum, and metastases to the liver capsule, spleen and peritoneum. The treatment of choice was right hemicolectomy with peritoneal debulking, followed by 10 cycles of chemotherapy with 5-fluorouracil, leucovorin and oxaliplatin (FOLFOX regimen). After 5 years of follow-up, the patient remains in good condition, without clinical or radiological signs of recurrence. The good response to chemotherapy corresponds with the observations made in other colon cancers with MSI. Therefore, testing for MSI in appendiceal carcinomas may provide useful information on prognosis and predict response to chemotherapy.
NMR and X-ray crystallography are the two most widely used methods for determining protein structures. Our previous study examining NMR versus X-Ray sources of protein conformations showed improved performance with NMR structures when used in our Multiple Protein Structures (MPS) method for receptor-based pharmacophores (Damm, Carlson, J Am Chem Soc 129:8225-8235, 2007). However, that work was based on a single test case, HIV-1 protease, because of the rich data available for that system. New data for more systems are available now, which calls for further examination of the effect of different sources of protein conformations. The MPS technique was applied to Growth factor receptor bound protein 2 (Grb2), Src SH2 homology domain (Src-SH2), FK506-binding protein 1A (FKBP12), and Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPAR-γ). Pharmacophore models from both crystal and NMR ensembles were able to discriminate between high-affinity, low-affinity, and decoy molecules. As we found in our original study, NMR models showed optimal performance when all elements were used. The crystal models had more pharmacophore elements compared to their NMR counterparts. The crystal-based models exhibited optimum performance only when pharmacophore elements were dropped. This supports our assertion that the higher flexibility in NMR ensembles helps focus the models on the most essential interactions with the protein. Our studies suggest that the "extra" pharmacophore elements seen at the periphery in X-ray models arise as a result of decreased protein flexibility and make very little contribution to model performance.
Buffalo production is spreading globally because of its economic advantage. Then, it has become necessary to improve the reproductive and productive efficiency of these animals, as well as to look for genetic factors that increase this efficiency. The objectives of this study were to characterize the promoter region of the melatonin 1A receptor gene (MTRN1A), to detect possible SNPs and associate them with fertility characteristics, and identify binding sites of transcription factors involved in the regulation of genetic expression in buffaloes in the Amazon. The conventional PCR method was carried out using the two primers designed from the reference sequence deposited in the GenBank AY52466.1. The products of the PCRs were purified, sequenced, and subsequently edited and aligned. Twenty-six SNPs were found, where 73% presented allele frequencies of wild nucleotides above 0.5, and 73% presented deviations from the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (P &lt; 0.05) and FIS varying between 0.06 and 1.00, characterizing high degrees of inbreeding within the population. A block of ACAA deletion (position -1483) was observed in 25% of samples. The associations between these SNPs and reproductive characteristics were observed for calving interval and 5 SNPs: -1289, -1139, -911, -724, and -656 (P &lt; 0.05), and three other SNPs: -1395, -724, and -94 (P &lt; 0.05) were associated significantly with age at first calving, and were not associated with calving concentration. The promoter region was characterized by the different types of binding factors, where only 11 sites are significantly strong enough for transcription factor bindings. The ACAA deletion also exhibited a strong association with transcription factors. As a result, it would be necessary to test the SNPs above with other reproductive characteristics of economic relevance to approve the gene as a strong candidate for the selection of buffaloes in the Amazon.
Hepatocellular adenomas (HCAs) are benign liver tumors that can be assigned to molecular subtypes based on inactivating mutations in hepatocyte nuclear factor 1A, activating mutations in β-catenin, or activation of inflammatory signaling pathways. We aimed to update the classification system for HCA and associate the subtypes with disease risk factors and complications.
We analyzed expression levels of 20 genes and sequenced exon regions of 8 genes (HNF1A, IL6ST, CTNNB1, FRK, STAT3, GNAS, JAK1, and TERT) in 607 samples of 533 HCAs from 411 patients, collected from 28 centers mainly in France from 2000 and 2014. We performed gene expression profile, RNA sequence, whole-exome and genome sequence, and immunohistochemical analyses of select samples. Molecular data were associated with risk factors, histopathology, bleeding, and malignant transformation.
Symptomatic bleeding occurred in 14% of the patients (85% of cases were female, median age, 38 years); 7% of the nodules were borderline between HCA and hepatocellular carcinoma, and 3% of patients developed hepatocellular carcinoma from HCA. Based on molecular features, we classified HCA into 8 subgroups. One new subgroup, composed of previously unclassified HCA, represented 4% of HCAs overall and was associated with obesity and bleeding. These tumors were characterized by activation of sonic hedgehog signaling, due to focal deletions that fuse the promoter of INHBE with GLI1. Analysis of genetic heterogeneity among multiple HCAs, from different patients, revealed a molecular subtype field effect; multiple tumors had different mutations that deregulated similar pathways. Specific molecular subtypes of HCA associated with various HCA risk factors, including imbalances in estrogen or androgen hormones. Specific molecular subgroup of HCA with β-catenin and sonic hedgehog activation associated with malignant transformation and bleeding, respectively.
Using sequencing and gene expression analyses, we identified a subgroup of HCA characterized by fusion of the INHBE and GLI1 genes and activation of sonic hedgehog pathway. Molecular subtypes of HCAs associated with different patients' risk factors for HCA, disease progression, and pathology features of tumors. This classification system might be used to select treatment strategies for patients with HCA.
Accumulation of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mROS) has been implicated in the pathogenesis of fluorosis. As the main mitochondrial deacetylase, SIRT3 is closely associated with oxidative stress. To investigate the role of SIRT3 in response to sodium fluoride (NaF)-induced nephrotoxicity. Our results showed that NaF treatment impaired mitochondrial ultrastructure, decreased cell viability and increased apoptosis in TCMK-1 cells. Oxidative stress, detected by mROS and 8-Hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) were higher in NaF-treated cells, accompanied by decreased level of reduced glutathione (GSH). NaF reduces manganese superoxide dismutase (SOD2) expression through SIRT3-mediated DNA-binding activity of FoxO3a and decrease SOD2 activity by inhibiting SIRT3-mediated deacetylation. These effects were ameliorated by overexpression of SIRT3. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-coactivator 1a (PGC-1α) interacted with nuclear factor erythroid 2 (NF-E2)-related factor 2 (NRF2) that bound to SIRT3 promoter to regulate SIRT3 expression. The study provides new insights into a critical NRF2/PGC-1α-SIRT3 pathway in response to NaF-induced nephritic oxidative injury. In vivo treatment of SIRT3-expressing adenovirus protects against NaF-induced nephritic injury in mice. Moreover, mechanistic study revealed that ERK1/2 activation was associated with increased apoptosis induced by NaF. In conclusion, these data shedding light on new approaches for treatment of NaF-induced nephrotoxicity.
This study was conducted to investigate the effects of methionine hydroxy analogue (MHA) on the physical barrier and immune defence in the gill of young grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella). A total 630 young grass carp with an average initial weight of 259.70 ± 0.47 g were fed graded levels of MHA (0, 2.4, 4.4, 6.4, 8.5 and 10.5 g/kg diet) and one DL-methionine (DLM) group (6.4 g/kg diet) for 8 weeks. After feeding trial, 15 fish from each treatment were challenged with Flavobacterium columnare. Compared to the basal diet, optimal MHA improved cellular structure integrity of gill via repressing death receptor and mitochondria pathways induced apoptosis, which might be related to the down-regulation of c-Jun-N-terminal kinase mRNA levels (P &lt; .05). Simultaneously, optimal MHA supplementation improved cellular structure integrity of gill via elevating glutathione contents, antioxidant enzymes activities and corresponding isoforms mRNA levels to attenuate oxidative damage, which might be to the up-regulation of NF-E2-related factor 2 mRNA levels and down-regulation of Kelch-like ECH-associating protein 1a mRNA levels (P &lt; .05). Besides, optimal MHA improved intercellular structure integrity of immune organs via up-regulating the mRNA levels of intercellular tight junctions-related genes, which might be owing to the down-regulation of myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) mRNA levels (P &lt; .05). Summarily, MHA could improve the physical barrier of fish gill. In addition, optimal MHA supplementation increased lysozyme (LZ) and acid phosphatase (ACP) activities, complement 3 (C3), C4 and immunoglobulin M contents and up-regulated mRNA levels of liver-expressed antimicrobial peptide 2, hepcidin and β-defensin, suggesting that MHA could enhance antimicrobial ability of fish gill. Meanwhile, optimal MHA supplementation enhanced the immune defence of gill via down-regulating pro-inflammatory cytokines mRNA levels and up-regulated anti-inflammatory cytokines mRNA levels, which might be attributed to the down-regulation of nuclear factor κB p65, c-Rel, IκB kinase β, p38 mitogen activated protein kinase, eIF4E-binding protein1 (4E-BP1) and 4E-BP2 mRNA levels and up-regulation of inhibitor of κBα, ribosomal protein S6 kinase 1 and target of rapamycin mRNA levels (P &lt; .05). In conclusion, the positive effect of MHA on gill health is associated with the improvement of the defence against apoptosis, antioxidant status, tight junctions and immune defence of fish gill. Meanwhile, MHA was superior to DLM on improving the physical barrier of fish gill. For the direction to healthy breeding of young grass carp, the optimal MHA supplementation levels on the premise of 4.01 g/kg methionine basal were estimated by quadratic regression curve, such as 5.49, 6.17 and 6.02 g/kg diet bases on the defence against gill-rot, malondialdehyde content and LZ activity in the gill, respectively.
Ghrelin is a peptide consisting of 28 aminoacids and an octadecyl side chain (acyl group) binding to the growth hormone secretagogue receptor type 1a (GHS-R1a). Its des-acylated form, des-acyl ghrelin (DAG) binds to the corticotropin releasing factor receptor type 2a (CRF2a) located on endocrine cancer cells such as the prostate carcinoma cell line DU 145.
The aim of this study is to develop a new DAG-based carrier of radionuclides with potential application in therapy.
Trunctated C-terminal five aminoacids chain of the DAG peptide (H2N-Gly-Ser-Ser-Phe-Leu-COOH) was linked to DTPA to obtain [DTPA-(PABn)-Leu5]-DAG(1-5). For therapeutic application the lutetium-177 (177Lu) radionuclide was coordinated to the peptide. To determine biological and chemical properties of newly synthesized radiopharmaceutical, two iodine-131 (131I)-labelled compounds were used: [131I]-Tyr4-DAG(1-5) and full length [131I]-DAG(1-28) together with their nonradioactive forms: DAG(1-28) and DAG(1-5).
Identical HPLC elution profiles of [177Lu-DTPA-(PABn)-Leu5]-DAG(1-5) before and after incubation with human serum proved its stability. The lipophilicity profile of [177Lu-DTPA-(PABn)-Leu5]-DAG(1-5) was log DO/W=-2.68±0.05, pH 7.4. Receptor affinity of the nonradioactive conjugate [Lu-DTPA-(PABn)-Leu5]-DAG(1-5) was IC50 (21.06 nmol/l), as shown against the [131I]-DAG(1-28) used as a competitor. The 3-(4,5-dimethyldiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay indicated the significant cytotoxicity of the newly synthesized compounds, similar to that of [131I]-Tyr4-DAG(1-5).
The results obtained suggest the potency of the [DTPA-(PABn)-Leu5]-DAG(1-5) as a new carrier of radionuclides in radiopharmacy.
p53 is a tumor suppressor protein involved in regulating a wide array of signaling pathways. The role of p53 in the cell is determined by the type of imposed oxidative stress, its intensity and duration. The last decade of research has unravelled a dual nature in the function of p53 in mediating the oxidative stress burden. However, this is dependent on the specific properties of the applied stress and thus requires further analysis.
A systematic review was performed following an electronic search of Pubmed, Google Scholar, and ScienceDirect databases. Articles published in the English language between January 1, 1990 and March 1, 2017 were identified and isolated based on the analysis of p53 in skeletal muscle in both animal and cell culture models.
Literature was categorized according to the modality of imposed oxidative stress including exercise, diet modification, exogenous oxidizing agents, tissue manipulation, irradiation, and hypoxia. With low to moderate levels of oxidative stress, p53 is involved in activating pathways that increase time for cell repair, such as cell cycle arrest and autophagy, to enhance cell survival. However, with greater levels of stress intensity and duration, such as with irradiation, hypoxia, and oxidizing agents, the role of p53 switches to facilitate increased cellular stress levels by initiating DNA fragmentation to induce apoptosis, thereby preventing aberrant cell proliferation.
Current evidence confirms that p53 acts as a threshold regulator of cellular homeostasis. Therefore, within each modality, the intensity and duration are parameters of the oxidative stressor that must be analyzed to determine the role p53 plays in regulating signaling pathways to maintain cellular health and function in skeletal muscle.

Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is associated with oxidative stress. We surmised that pharmacologic activation of NF-E2 p45-related factor 2 (Nrf2) using the acetylenic tricyclic bis(cyano enone) TBE-31 would suppress NASH because Nrf2 is a transcriptional master regulator of intracellular redox homeostasis.

                     C57BL/6 mice were fed a high-fat plus fructose (HFFr) or regular chow diet for 16 weeks or 30 weeks, and then treated for the final 6 weeks, while still being fed the same HFFr or regular chow diets, with either TBE-31 or dimethyl sulfoxide vehicle control. Measures of whole-body glucose homeostasis, histologic assessment of liver, and biochemical and molecular measurements of steatosis, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, inflammation, apoptosis, fibrosis, and oxidative stress were performed in livers from these animals.
TBE-31 treatment reversed insulin resistance in HFFr-fed wild-type mice, but not in HFFr-fed Nrf2-null mice. TBE-31 treatment of HFFr-fed wild-type mice substantially decreased liver steatosis and expression of lipid synthesis genes, while increasing hepatic expression of fatty acid oxidation and lipoprotein assembly genes. Also, TBE-31 treatment decreased ER stress, expression of inflammation genes, and markers of apoptosis, fibrosis, and oxidative stress in the livers of HFFr-fed wild-type mice. By comparison, TBE-31 did not decrease steatosis, ER stress, lipogenesis, inflammation, fibrosis, or oxidative stress in livers of HFFr-fed Nrf2-null mice.
Pharmacologic activation of Nrf2 in mice that had already been rendered obese and insulin resistant reversed insulin resistance, suppressed hepatic steatosis, and mitigated against NASH and liver fibrosis, effects that we principally attribute to inhibition of ER, inflammatory, and oxidative stress.
Loss of caudal type homeobox 2 (CDX2) is associated with the development of human colorectal cancer, while human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) frequently occurs in variety of human cancers. We investigated the effects of restoration of CDX2 expression using a hypoxia-inducible hTERT promoter-driven vector (pLVX-5HRE-hTERTp-CDX2-3FLAG) on colon cancer cell viability, cell cycle distribution, apoptosis, colony formation, invasion ability and xenograft tumor growth in nude mice. CDX2 overexpression significantly inhibited viability, colony formation, and the invasion and migration ability of LoVo cells, and induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in vitro, especially under hypoxic culture conditions. Overexpression of CDX2 under normoxic conditions significantly suppressed the expression of TGF-β, cyclin D1, uPA, MMP-9, MMP-2, and Bcl-2, and stimulated the expression of collagen IV, laminin-1, and Bax. Overexpression of CDX2 reduced colon cancer xenograft tumor formation in nude mice which was associated with downregulation of Ki-67. In conclusion, overexpression of CDX2 using a hypoxia-inducible hTERT promoter-driven vector suppressed malignant progression of colon cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. These results suggest that pLVX-5HRE-hTERTp-CDX2-3FLAG gene therapy may be a promising novel approach to treat colon cancer.
Pulmonary enteric adenocarcinoma is a markedly rare pathological type of lung adenocarcinoma. As the pancreas is a relatively uncommon site for metastasis, the present case is even more unusual. A 62-year-old male was admitted to hospital following the identification of masses in the left chest wall, right abdominal wall and right upper limb, but with no respiratory symptoms. Computed tomography (CT) of the chest revealed a lump in the lung and a mass in the left chest wall, and 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) uptake by the lumps was increased. An enhanced abdominal CT revealed a hypodense and homogeneous mass on the head of the pancreas, which was slightly enhanced compared with normal pancreatic tissue. In addition, the 18F-FDG uptake of the lesion was increased and the standardized uptake value (SUV) delayed was not evidently decreased compared with SUVearly. A number of other abnormal metabolic lesions were also identified using positron emission tomography/CT, whereas no abnormal 18F-FDG uptake was identified in the gastrointestinal organ. Furthermore, rectocolonoscopy was performed to exclude diagnosis of metastatic colorectal adenocarcinoma. The hematoxylin- and eosin-stained smears of the masses in the right lung and left chest demonstrated an enteric pattern, which shared morphological and immunohistochemical (IHC) features with those of colorectal adenocarcinoma. The IHC detection revealed that the lesions in the right lung were positive for cytokeratin 7 (CK7), and negative for CK20 and thyroid transcription factor 1 (TTF-1), and the expression of caudal type homeobox 2 (CDX2) was weakly positive; the masses in the left chest wall were positive for CK7, negative for TTF-1, and CK20 and CDX2 were weakly expressed.
The concept that flavonoids exert cardioprotection against myocardial ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury has been acknowledged by a large body of evidence. However, recent studies reported cardiotoxic effects of certain flavonoids, while the underlying mechanisms have remained largely elusive. Flavonoids have been demonstrated to activate aryl hydrocarbon receptor (Ahr), which is implicated in an array of cell signaling processes. The present study examined the cardioprotective roles of quercetin (Qu) and β-naphthoflavone (β-NF) against I/R injury and explored whether the underlying mechanism proceeds via molecular signaling downstream of Ahr. An oxygen glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R) model of I/R was established in myocardial H9c2 cells in the absence or presence of Qu or β-NF. Qu as well as β-NF reversed OGD/R-induced overproduction of reactive oxygen species by increasing the anti-oxidative capacity of the cells and protected them from lethal injury, as demonstrated by a decreased cell death rate, lactate hydrogenase leakage and caspase-3 activity as determined by flow cytometry, colorimetric assay and western blot analysis, respectively. Immunocytochemistry, co-immunoprecipitation and western blot assays collectively revealed that Qu and β-NF engendered the translocation of Ahr from the cytoplasm into the cell nucleus, where binding of Ahr with the Ahr nuclear translocator (ARNT) blocked its binding to hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1α, which inhibited the cardioprotection of HIF-1α, including the induction of nitric oxide (NO) and inhibition of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) production. Ahr knockdown recovered the binding of ARNT to HIF-1α and the generation of NO and VEGF. The results of the present study suggested a dual character of Qu and β-NF in the process of myocardial I/R.
Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by the formation of Lewy bodies (LBs) in dopaminergic neurons. α-Synuclein (α-syn), a major protein component of LBs, is known to regulate synaptic plasticity, with a crucial role in memory and motor function in the central nervous system. Levodopa (L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine; also known as L-DOPA) is considered the most effective medication for controlling the symptoms of PD. However, it is unclear whether L-DOPA improves the neuropathology of PD. In the present study, we investigated the effect of L-DOPA on SH-SY5Y neuronal cells under α-syn-induced toxicity. We assessed the protein and mRNA levels of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and cell death markers using western blot analysis and reverse transcription-PCR. Our data showed that L-DOPA could attenuate ER stress markers, including the levels of activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4), C/EBPhomologous protein expression (CHOP), immunoglobulin-heavy-chain-binding protein (BiP), sliced X-box-binding protein 1 (XBP-1), and reduce nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) signaling through dopamine receptor D2 (DRD2) in SH-SY5Y neuronal cells under α-syn-induced toxicity. In conclusion, we suggest that L-DOPA may attenuate the neuropathology of PD by regulating signaling related to DRD2 in neuronal cells under α-syn-induced toxicity. Our study, therefore, indicates an additional role for L-DOPA in the treatment of PD.
Protein conjugation with small ubiquitin-related modifier (SUMO) is a post-translational modification that modulates protein interactions and localisation. RANBP2 is a large nucleoporin endowed with SUMO E3 ligase and SUMO-stabilising activity, and is implicated in some cancer types. RANBP2 is part of a larger complex, consisting of SUMO-modified RANGAP1, the GTP-hydrolysis activating factor for the GTPase RAN. During mitosis, the RANBP2-SUMO-RANGAP1 complex localises to the mitotic spindle and to kinetochores after microtubule attachment. Here, we address the mechanisms that regulate this localisation and how they affect kinetochore functions. Using proximity ligation assays, we find that nuclear transport receptors importin-β and CRM1 play essential roles in localising the RANBP2-SUMO-RANGAP1 complex away from, or at kinetochores, respectively. Using newly generated inducible cell lines, we show that overexpression of nuclear transport receptors affects the timing of RANBP2 localisation in opposite ways. Concomitantly, kinetochore functions are also affected, including the accumulation of SUMO-conjugated topoisomerase-IIα and stability of kinetochore fibres. These results delineate a novel mechanism through which nuclear transport receptors govern the functional state of kinetochores by regulating the timely deposition of RANBP2.
Obesity is characterized by the chronic low-grade activation of the innate immune system. In this respect, macrophage-elicited metabolic inflammation and adipocyte-macrophage interaction has a primary importance in obesity. Large amounts of macrophages are accumulated by different mechanisms in obese adipose tissue. Hypertrophic adipocyte-derived chemotactic monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1)/C-C chemokine receptor 2 (CCR2) pathway also promotes more macrophage accumulation into the obese adipose tissue. However, increased local extracellular lipid concentrations is a final mechanism for adipose tissue macrophage accumulation. A paracrine loop involving free fatty acids and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) between adipocytes and macrophages establishes a vicious cycle that aggravates inflammatory changes in the adipose tissue. Adipocyte-specific caspase-1 and production of interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) by macrophages; both adipocyte and macrophage induction by toll like receptor-4 (TLR4) through nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) activation; free fatty acid-induced and TLR-mediated activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)-related pro-inflammatory pathways in CD11c+ immune cells; are effective in macrophage accumulation and in the development of adipose tissue inflammation. Old adipocytes are removed by macrophages through trogocytosis or sending an "eat me" signal. The obesity-induced changes in adipose tissue macrophage numbers are mainly due to increases in the triple-positive CD11b+ F4/80+ CD11c+ adipose tissue macrophage subpopulation. The ratio of M1-to-M2 macrophages is increased in obesity. Furthermore, hypoxia along with higher concentrations of free fatty acids exacerbates macrophage-mediated inflammation in obesity. The metabolic status of adipocytes is a major determinant of macrophage inflammatory output. Macrophage/adipocyte fatty-acid-binding proteins act at the interface of metabolic and inflammatory pathways. Both macrophages and adipocytes are the sites for active lipid metabolism and signaling.
Cutaneous reactions represent one of the most common adverse drug effects observed in clinical trials leading to substantial compound attrition. Three negative allosteric modulators (NAMs) of metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs), which represent an important target for neurological diseases, developed by Pfizer, were recently failed in preclinical development due to delayed type IV skin hypersensitivity observed in non-human primates (NHPs). Here we employed large-scale phenotypic profiling in standardized panels of human primary cell/co-culture systems to characterize the skin toxicity mechanism(s) of mGluR5 NAMs from two different series. Investigation of a database of chemicals tested in these systems and transcriptional profiling suggested that the mechanism of toxicity may involve modulation of nuclear receptor targets RAR/RXR, and/or VDR with AhR antagonism. The studies reported here demonstrate how phenotypic profiling of preclinical drug candidates using human primary cells can provide insights into the mechanisms of toxicity and inform early drug discovery and development campaigns.
Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is an important mediator of long-term synaptic potentiation (LTP) in the hippocampus. The local effects of BDNF depend on the activation of translation activity, which requires the delivery of transcripts to the synapse. In this work, we found that neuronal activity regulates the dendritic localization of the RNA-binding protein heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein K (hnRNP K) in cultured rat hippocampal neurons by stimulating BDNF-Trk signaling. Microarray experiments identified a large number of transcripts that are coimmunoprecipitated with hnRNP K, and about 60% of these transcripts are dissociated from the protein upon stimulation of rat hippocampal neurons with BDNF. In vivo studies also showed a role for TrkB signaling in the dissociation of transcripts from hnRNP K upon high-frequency stimulation (HFS) of medial perforant path-granule cell synapses of male rat dentate gyrus (DG). Furthermore, treatment of rat hippocampal synaptoneurosomes with BDNF decreased the coimmunoprecipitation of hnRNP K with mRNAs coding for glutamate receptor subunits, Ca2+- and calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IIβ (CaMKIIβ) and BDNF. Downregulation of hnRNP K impaired the BDNF-induced enhancement of NMDA receptor (NMDAR)-mediated mEPSC, and similar results were obtained upon inhibition of protein synthesis with cycloheximide. The results demonstrate that BDNF regulates specific populations of hnRNP-associated mRNAs in neuronal dendrites and suggests an important role of hnRNP K in BDNF-dependent forms of synaptic plasticity.
The RNA-binding protein Argonaute 2 (AGO2) is a key effector of RNA-silencing pathways It exerts a pivotal role in microRNA maturation and activity and can modulate chromatin remodeling, transcriptional gene regulation and RNA splicing. Estrogen receptor beta (ERβ) is endowed with oncosuppressive activities, antagonizing hormone-induced carcinogenesis and inhibiting growth and oncogenic functions in luminal-like breast cancers (BCs), where its expression correlates with a better prognosis of the disease.
Applying interaction proteomics coupled to mass spectrometry to characterize nuclear factors cooperating with ERβ in gene regulation, we identify AGO2 as a novel partner of ERβ in human BC cells. ERβ-AGO2 association was confirmed in vitro and in vivo in both the nucleus and cytoplasm and is shown to be RNA-mediated. ChIP-Seq demonstrates AGO2 association with a large number of ERβ binding sites, and total and nascent RNA-Seq in ERβ + vs ERβ - cells, and before and after AGO2 knock-down in ERβ + cells, reveals a widespread involvement of this factor in ERβ-mediated regulation of gene transcription rate and RNA splicing. Moreover, isolation and sequencing by RIP-Seq of ERβ-associated long and small RNAs in the cytoplasm suggests involvement of the nuclear receptor in RISC loading, indicating that it may also be able to directly control mRNA translation efficiency and stability.
These results demonstrate that AGO2 can act as a pleiotropic functional partner of ERβ, indicating that both factors are endowed with multiple roles in the control of key cellular functions.
Is Growth Regulation by Estrogen in Breast Cancer 1 (GREB1) required for progesterone-driven endometrial stromal cell decidualization?
GREB1 is a novel progesterone-responsive gene required for progesterone-driven human endometrial stromal cell (HESC) decidualization.
Successful establishment of pregnancy requires HESCs to transform from fibroblastic to epithelioid cells in a process called decidualization. This process depends on the hormone progesterone, but the molecular mechanisms by which it occurs have not been determined.
Primary and transformed HESCs in which GREB1 expression was knocked down were decidualized in culture for up to 6 days. Wild-type and progesterone receptor (PR) knockout mice were treated with progesterone, and their uteri were assessed for levels of GREB1 expression.
Analysis of previous data included data mining of expression profile data sets and in silico transcription factor-binding analysis. Endometrial biopsies obtained from healthy women of reproductive age during the proliferative phase (Days 8-12) of their menstrual cycle were used for isolating HESCs. Experiments were carried out with early passage (no more than four passages) HESCs isolated from at least three subjects. Transcript levels of decidualization markers prolactin (PRL) and insulin-like growth factor-binding protein-1 (IGFBP-1) were detected by quantitative RT-PCR as readouts for HESC decidualization. Cells were also imaged by phase-contrast microscopy. To assess the requirement for GREB1, PR and SRC-2, cells were transfected with specifically targeted small interfering RNAs. Results are shown as mean and SE from three replicates of one representative patient-derived primary endometrial cell line. Experiments were also conducted with transformed HESCs.
Progesterone treatment of mice and transformed HESCs led to an ~5-fold (5.6 ± 0.81, P &lt; 0.05, and 5.2 ± 0.26, P &lt; 0.01, respectively) increase in GREB1 transcript levels. This increase was significantly reduced in the uteri of PR knock-out mice (P &lt; 0.01), in HESCs treated with the PR antagonist RU486 (P &lt; 0.01), or in HESCs in which PR expression was knocked down (P &lt; 0.05). When GREB1 expression was knocked down, progesterone-driven decidualization markers in both immortalized and primary HESCs was significantly reduced (P &lt; 0.05 and P &lt; 0.01). Finally, GREB1 knock down signficantly reduced expression of the PR target genes WNT4 and FOXOA1 (P &lt; 0.05 and P &lt; 0.01, respectively).
This study used the Nuclear Receptor Signaling Atlas.
Although in vitro cell culture studies indicate that GREB1 is required for endoemtrial decidualization, the in vivo role of GREB1 in endometrial function and dysfunction should be assessed by using knock-out mouse models.
Identification and functional analysis of GREB1 as a key molecular mediator of decidualization may lead to improved diagnosis and clinical management of women with peri-implantation loss due to inadequate endometrial decidualization.

Endometriotic stromal cells synthesize estradiol via the steroidogenic pathway. Nuclear receptor subfamily 5, group A, member 1 (NR5A1) is critical, but alone not sufficient, in activating this cascade that involves at least 5 genes. To evaluate whether another transcription factor is required for the activation of this pathway, we examined whether GATA Binding Protein 6 (GATA6) can transform a normal endometrial stromal cell (NoEM) into an endometriotic-like cell by conferring an estrogen-producing phenotype. We ectopically expressed GATA6 alone or with NR5A1 in NoEM or silenced these transcription factors in endometriotic stromal cells (OSIS) and assessed the messenger RNAs or proteins encoded by the genes in the steroidogenic cascade. Functionally, we assessed the effects of GATA6 expression or silencing on estradiol formation. In OSIS, GATA6 was necessary for catalyzing the conversion of progesterone to androstenedione (CYP17A1; P &lt; .05). In NoEM, ectopic expression of GATA6 was essential for converting pregnenolone to estrogen (HSD3B2, CYP17A1, and CYP19A1; P &lt; .05). However, simultaneous ectopic expression of both GATA6 and NR5A1 was required and sufficient to confer induction of all 5 genes and their encoded proteins that convert cholesterol to estrogen. Functionally, only simultaneous knockdown of GATA6 and NR5A1 blocked estradiol formation in OSIS ( P &lt; .05). The presence of both transcription factors was required and sufficient to transform endometrial stromal cells into endometriotic-like cells that produced estradiol in large quantities ( P &lt; .05). In summary, GATA6 alone is essential but not sufficient for estrogen formation in endometriosis. However, simultaneous addition of GATA6 and NR5A1 to an endometrial stromal cell is sufficient to transform it into an endometriotic-like cell, manifested by the activation of the estradiol biosynthetic cascade.
Hepatocytes differentiated from human embryonic stem cells (ESCs) could provide a powerful tool for enabling cell-based therapies, studying the mechanisms underlying human liver development and disease, and testing the efficacy and safety of pharmaceuticals. However, currently most in vitro protocols yield hepatocytes with low levels of liver function. In this study, we investigated the potential of Salvianolic acid B (Sal B), an active pharmaceutical compound present in Salvia miltiorrhiza, which has been shown to have an antifibrotic effect in previous studies, to enhance hepatocyte differentiation from human ESCs. After treatment with Sal B, albumin expression and secretion were consistently increased, indicating that Sal B could promote hepatocyte differentiation process. Expression of a large number of important phase 1 and 2 metabolizing enzymes and phase 3 transporters was also increased in treated cells, indicating an enhanced biotransformation function. Our investigations further revealed the activation of Wnt pathway in treated cells, as determined by upregulation of Wnts, which increased amounts of nuclear β-catenin. This increased nuclear β-catenin led in turn to the enhanced expression of T cell factor (TCF) 3 and lymphoid enhancer-binding factor (LEF) 1 which upregulated their downstream targets, cyclin D1 and c-Myc. Notch receptors (Notch1, Notch3), Notch ligand (Jagged2), and Notch receptor targets [hairy and enhancer of split (Hes) 1, 5] were downregulated in treated cells, suggesting that Notch pathway was inhibited. Consistent with the inhibition of Notch pathway, expression of cholangiocyte marker, CK7, was significantly reduced by treatment with Sal B. Numb, a direct transcriptional target of Wnt pathway and a negative regulator of Notch pathway, was upregulated, consistent with activation of Wnt signaling and suppression of Notch signaling. In conclusion, our study demonstrated that Sal B enhanced hepatocyte differentiation from human ESCs through activation of Wnt pathway and inhibition of Notch pathway. Therefore, this study suggests that Sal B can be used as a potential agent to generate more mature hepatocytes for cell-based therapeutics and pharmaceutical studies.
In mammals, excess energy is stored primarily as triglycerides, which are mobilized when energy demands arise. This review mainly focuses on the role of long chain fatty acids (LCFAs) in regulating energy metabolism as ligands of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs). PPAR-alpha expressed primarily in liver is essential for metabolic adaptation to starvation by inducing genes for beta-oxidation and ketogenesis and by downregulating energy expenditure through fibroblast growth factor 21. PPAR-delta is highly expressed in skeletal muscle and induces genes for LCFA oxidation during fasting and endurance exercise. PPAR-delta also regulates glucose metabolism and mitochondrial biogenesis by inducing FOXO1 and PGC1-alpha. Genes targeted by PPAR-gamma in adipocytes suggest that PPAR-gamma senses incoming non-esterified LCFAs and induces the pathways to store LCFAs as triglycerides. Adiponectin, another important target of PPAR-gamma may act as a spacer between adipocytes to maintain their metabolic activity and insulin sensitivity. Another topic of this review is effects of skin LCFAs on energy metabolism. Specific LCFAs are required for the synthesis of skin lipids, which are essential for water barrier and thermal insulation functions of the skin. Disturbance of skin lipid metabolism often causes apparent resistance to developing obesity at the expense of normal skin function. 
By the application of the invariom formalism, which provides aspherical atomic scattering factors, the electron densities of the RXR-selective retinoid agonists bexarotene (1a) and disila-bexarotene (1b) were derived from their known low resolution (d = 0.76 Å) crystal structures. The density distributions allowed us to make a comparison of the electronic properties of these pharmacologically relevant compounds. Differences were found to be restricted to relatively small regions in the terminal six-membered rings of the tetrahydronaphthalene and tetrahydrodisilanaphthalene fragments. In total, the replacement of two carbon atoms in 1a by silicon atoms (→1b) does neither influence the electronic structures nor the pharmacological properties (RXR receptor activation) significantly. It should be noted that the almost completely software supported invariom formalism can yield electronic information for biologically interacting systems with moderate effort. This offers interesting possibilities for drug research, in that steric and electronic information can be combined for the analysis of intermolecular recognition and interaction on an atomic scale. This approach is also valuable for the design and development of silicon-containing drugs using the carbon/silicon switch strategy.
Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) are nuclear hormone receptors that play key roles in lipid and energy homeostasis. Paralichthys olivaceus PPARα (PoPPARα) cDNA was isolated by initial reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) using conserved region among fish species and rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE). The full-length of PoPPARα cDNA is 2040-bp long encoding a polypeptide with 505 amino acids and containing a DNA binding domain (C4-type zinc finger) and a ligand-binding domain. PoPPARα was detected from 1 day post-hatch and was highly expressed in the stomach, liver, and intestine of continuously fed flounder, approximately 16 cm in size. PoPPARα mRNA expression was down-regulated in the kidney, stomach, and liver of the 4.5-month-old flounder after a 30 day food-deprivation period. PoPPARα activates the PPAR response element (PPRE)-driven reporter, and treatment with Wy14643, a PPARα agonist, augmented PoPPARα-stimulated peroxisome proliferator response element activity in HINAE and HepG2 cells. PoPPARα activated the expression of fatty acid β-oxidation related genes such as carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1A, medium chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase, and acyl-CoA oxidase 1 and inhibited the expression of sterol regulatory element binding protein and fatty acid synthase by competitively inhibiting LXR/RXR heterodimer formation. These results suggest that PoPPARα plays an important role in lipid metabolism of olive flounder and that it is functionally and evolutionarily conserved in olive flounder and mammals.
The high expression of folate receptor (FR) on cancer cells might be a potential target for cancer therapy. In this study, the FR-β expression and the modulation effect of all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) in a number of cancer cell lines were analyzed. The gateway of ATRA activity on FR-β expression was further studied by a panel of retinoid activators and inhibitors. The results revealed that ATRA was capable of upregulating the expression of FR-β protein in KG-1 cells in a dosage-dependent manner, not in KG-1a, NB4, HL60, 293, L1210, JAR, and Hela cells. FR-β mRNA expression in KG-1 cells was higher when ATRA was present in culture medium at 10⁻⁶ mol/L for 5 days, and it went down to baseline when ATRA was removed from the medium, vice versa. The upregulation of FR-β expression in KG-1 cells by ATRA was not associated with cell proliferation and differentiation. In addition, activators of retinoid acid receptor (RAR)α and RARγ, CD336, and CD2781 also induced FR-β expression. The induction of FR-β expression by CD336 could be inhibited by RARγ antagonist CD2665; RARβ agonist CD-417 and CD-2314 as well as retinoid X receptor (RXR) agonist LG100364 could not induce FR-β expression. These results indicate that ATRA within a certain range of concentration could reversibly induce the expression of FR-β in a dosage- and cell type-dependent manner, and its action in KG-1 cells might be associated with the signal transduction of retinoid receptor RARα and RARγ, rather than RARβ and RXRs.
Retinoid X receptors (RXRs) are members of the nuclear receptor superfamily and can be activated by 9-cis retinoic acid (9CRA). RXRs form homodimers and heterodimers with other nuclear receptors such as the retinoic acid receptor and NR4 subfamily nuclear receptors, Nur77 and NURR1. Potential physiological roles of the Nur77-RXR and NURR1-RXR heterodimers have not been elucidated. In this study, we identified a gene regulated by these heterodimers utilizing HX600, a selective RXR agonist for Nur77-RXR and NURR1-RXR. While 9CRA induced many genes, including RAR-target genes, HX600 effectively induced only carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1A (CPT1A) in human teratocarcinoma NT2/D1 cells, which express RXRα, Nur77 and NURR1. HX600 also increased CPT1A expression in human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells and hepatocyte-derived HepG2 cells. Although HX600 induced CPT1A less effectively than 9CRA, overexpression of Nur77 or NURR1 increased the HX600 response to levels similar to 9CRA in NT2/D1 and HEK293 cells. A dominant-negative form of Nur77 or NURR1 repressed the induction of CPT1A by HX600. A protein synthesis inhibitor did not alter HX600-dependent CPT1A induction. Thus, the rexinoid HX600 directly induces expression of CPT1A through a Nur77 or NURR1-mediated mechanism. CPT1A, a gene involved in fatty acid β-oxidation, could be a target of RXR-NR4 receptor heterodimers.
This study aimed to develop a greater understanding of the mechanisms underlying acute corneal allograft rejection by identifying differentially expressed tear proteins at defined stages and discovering potentially important proteins involved in the process.
The isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ)-two-dimensional liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (2DLC-MS/MS) technique was used to identify tear proteins showing significant alterations in a rat penetrating keratoplasty model at different time points. Bioinformatics technology was applied to analyze the significant proteins, and a potential protein was verified by Western blotting.
A total of 269 proteins were quantified, and 118 proteins were considered to be significantly altered by at least 2.0- or 0.5-fold. For gene ontology annotations, the top enrichments were neurological disease, free radical scavenging, cell death and survival, and cell movement. For pathway analyses, the top enrichments were LXR/RXR activation, acute phase response signaling, clathrin-mediated endocytosis signaling, and coagulation system. Coronin-1A was verified as a potential protein involved in the early stage of acute corneal allograft rejection.
This study first demonstrates that tear proteomics is a powerful tool for better understanding of the mechanisms underlying acute corneal rejection, and that coronin-1A in tears might be closely related to allograft rejection.
Resistance to radiation therapy constitutes a significant challenge in the treatment of head and neck squamous cell cancer (HNSCC). Alteration in DNA methylation is thought to play a role in this resistance. Here, we analyzed DNA methylation changes in a matched model of radiation resistance for HNSCC using the Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip. Our results show that compared to radiation-sensitive cells (SCC-61), radiation-resistant cells (rSCC-61) had a significant increase in DNA methylation. After combining these results with microarray gene expression data, we identified 84 differentially methylated and expressed genes between these 2 cell lines. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis revealed ILK signaling, glucocorticoid receptor signaling, fatty acid α-oxidation, and cell cycle regulation as top canonical pathways associated with radiation resistance. Validation studies focused on CCND2, a protein involved in cell cycle regulation, which was identified as hypermethylated in the promoter region and downregulated in rSCC-61 relative to SCC-61 cells. Treatment of rSCC-61 and SCC-61 with the DNA hypomethylating agent 5-aza-2'deoxycitidine increased CCND2 levels only in rSCC-61 cells, while treatment with the control reagent cytosine arabinoside did not influence the expression of this gene. Further analysis of HNSCC data from The Cancer Genome Atlas found increased methylation in radiation-resistant tumors, consistent with the cell culture data. Our findings point to global DNA methylation status as a biomarker of radiation resistance in HNSCC, and suggest a need for targeted manipulation of DNA methylation to increase radiation response in HNSCC. 
RXR partial agonist NEt-4IB (2a, 6-[ethyl-(4-isobutoxy-3-isopropylphenyl)amino]pyridine-3-carboxylic acid: EC50 = 169 nM, E max = 55%) showed a blood concentration higher than its E max after single oral administration at 30 mg/kg to mice, and repeated oral administration at 10 mg/kg/day to KK-A(y) mice afforded antitype 2 diabetes activity without the side effects caused by RXR full agonists. However, RXR full agonist NEt-3IB (1a), in which the isobutoxy and isopropyl groups of 2a are interchanged, gave a much lower blood concentration than 2a. Here we used positron emission tomography (PET) with tracers [(11)C]1a, [(11)C]2a and fluorinated derivatives [(18)F]1b, [(18)F]2b, which have longer half-lives, to examine the reason why 1a and 2a exhibited significantly different blood concentrations. As a result, the reason for the high blood concentration of 2a after oral administration was found to be linked to higher intestinal absorbability together with lower biliary excretion, compared with 1a. 
It is well known that retinoic acid (RA) suppresses adipogenesis, although there are some contradicting reports. In this study, we examined the effect of extracellular glucose on RA-induced suppression of adipogenesis in 3T3L1 cell culture. When the cells were cultured in normal glucose medium (NG), the addition of RA suppressed lipid accumulation. However, when cultured in high glucose medium (HG), addition of RA to the cells enhanced lipid accumulation. These changes were accompanied by parallel alterations in fatty acid synthase (FAS) and sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP)-1 gene expression. Transfection of SREBP-1 siRNA suppressed RA-induced enhancement of lipid accumulation and FAS expression in the cells cultured with HG. Transfection of the nuclear form of SREBP-1a cDNA into the cells cultured with NG inhibited RA-induced suppression of lipid accumulation and FAS expression. Moreover, RA- and HG-induced SREBP-1a expression occurred at the early phase of adipogenesis and was dependent on glucocorticoid to induce liver X receptor (LXR) β, peroxisomal proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) γ and retinoid X receptor (RXR), the key nuclear factors influencing the SREBP-1a gene expression. These results suggest that RA suppresses and enhances lipid accumulation through extracellular glucose concentration-dependent modulation of SREBP-1 expression.
Metabolomics studies of human plasma demonstrate a correlation of lower plasma lysophosphatidylcholines (LPC) concentrations with insulin resistance, obesity, and inflammation. This relationship is not unraveled on a molecular level. Here we investigated the effects of the abundant LPC(16:0) and LPC(18:1) on human skeletal muscle cells differentiated to myotubes. Transcriptome analysis of human myotubes treated with 10μM LPC for 24h revealed enrichment of up-regulated peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) target transcripts, including ANGPTL4, PDK4, PLIN2, and CPT1A. The increase in both PDK4 and ANGPTL4 RNA expression was abolished in the presence of either PPARδ antagonist GSK0660 or GSK3787. The induction of PDK4 by LPCs was blocked with siRNA against PPARD. The activation of PPARδ transcriptional activity by LPC was shown as PPARδ-dependent luciferase reporter gene expression and enhanced DNA binding of the PPARδ/RXR dimer. On a functional level, further results show that the LPC-mediated activation of PPARδ can reduce fatty acid-induced inflammation and ER stress in human skeletal muscle cells. The protective effect of LPC was prevented in the presence of the PPARδ antagonist GSK0660. Taking together, LPCs can activate PPARδ, which is consistent with the association of high plasma LPC levels and PPARδ-dependent anti-diabetic and anti-inflammatory effects.
The marine white spot disease caused by protozoan ectoparasite Cryptocaryon irritans is a severe problem to the large yellow croaker farming industry. To understand the molecular immune mechanisms and improve its immune capacity are particular important. STING, one of the important second messengers in innate immune response process, plays pivotal roles in defensing against different pathogenic microorganisms. Many reports have pointed that STING could not only combine the uncovered dsDNA, ssDNA directly in the cytoplasm from the pathogens or biology itself, but it also could recognize cyclic diguanylate monophosphate (c-di-GMP), cyclic diadenylate monophosphate (c-di-AMP). Based on the STING sequence, a variant of the L. crocea STING (termed LcSTING2) was found by accident. RACE was used to clone the full-length cDNA of LcSTING2 which contained a 5'- UTR of 154 bp, a 3'-UTR of 592 bp and an ORF of 1227 bp encoding 408 amino acids. The predicted protein molecular weight (Mw) was 45.83 KDa and the estimated theoretical isoelectric point (pI) was 6.24. The deduced protein of LcSTING2 contains no signal peptide. One transmembrane motif (TM) in the N-terminal region, a TMEM173 domain and five putative motifs (RXR) found in resident endoplasmic reticulum proteins were also conserved. According to the partial genomic sequence, the unknown sequences were amplified, it contained 6 exons and 5 introns, and all the exon-intron boundaries were in accordance with classical GT-AG rule (GT/intron/AG). The similarity shared with fishes was higher than other high vertebrates. qRT-PCR results showed that LcSTING (two variants) distributed in all examined tissues, and it was the most abundant in gill. After challenged by C. irritans, LcSTING mRNA only appeared instantaneous up-regulation during the infective stage of theronts in the head kidney and was also up-regulated during the whole infectious cycle of C. irritans in the liver, which implied LcSTING gene was likely to be involved in the defensing against C. irritans infection, it is the first time to explore the STING taking part in the immune response to ectoparasite rather than bacterium or viruses.
Non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) remains the leading cause of cancer deaths in the United States. More than half of NSCLC patients have clinical presentations with locally advanced or metastatic disease at the time of diagnosis. The large-scale genomic analysis of NSCLC has demonstrated that molecular alterations are substantially different between adenocarcinoma (ADC) and squamous cell carcinoma (SqCC). However, a comprehensive analysis of proteins and glycoproteins in different subtypes of NSCLC using advanced proteomic approaches has not yet been conducted.
We applied mass spectrometry (MS) technology featuring proteomics and glycoproteomics to analyze six primary lung SqCCs and eleven ADCs, and we compared the expression level of proteins and glycoproteins in tumors using quantitative proteomics. Glycoproteins were analyzed by enrichment using a chemoenzymatic method, solid-phase extraction of glycopeptides, and quantified by iTRAQ-LC-MS/MS. Protein quantitation was further annotated via Ingenuity Pathway Analysis.
Over 6000 global proteins and 480 glycoproteins were quantitatively identified in both SqCC and ADC. ADC proteins (8337) consisted of enzymes (22.11%), kinases (5.11%), transcription factors (6.85%), transporters (6.79%), and peptidases (3.30%). SqCC proteins (6967) had a very similar distribution. The identified glycoproteins, in order of relative abundance, included membrane (42%) and extracellular matrix (&gt;33%) glycoproteins. Oncogene-coded proteins (82) increased 1.5-fold among 1047 oncogenes identified in ADC, while 124 proteins from SqCC were up-regulated in tumor tissues among a total of 827 proteins. We identified 680 and 563 tumor suppressor genes from ADC and SqCC, respectively.
Our systematic analysis of proteins and glycoproteins demonstrates changes of protein and glycoprotein relative abundance in SqCC (TP53, U2AF1, and RXR) and in ADC (SMARCA4, NOTCH1, PTEN, and MST1). Among them, eleven glycoproteins were upregulated in both ADC and SqCC. Two glycoproteins (ELANE and IGFBP3) were only increased in SqCC, and six glycoproteins (ACAN, LAMC2, THBS1, LTBP1, PSAP and COL1A2) were increased in ADC. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) showed that several crucial pathways were activated in SqCC and ADC tumor tissues.
In many fish species, including salmonids, the growth-hormone is encoded by two duplicated paralogous genes, gh1 and gh2. Both genes were already in place at the time of divergence of species in this group. A comparison of the entire sequence of these genes of salmonids has shown that their conserved regions are associated with exons, while their most variable regions correspond to introns. Introns C and D include putative regulatory elements (sites Pit-1, CRE, and ERE), that are also conserved. In chars, the degree of polymorphism of gh2 gene is 2-3 times as large as that in gh1 gene. However, a comparison across all Salmonidae species would not extent this observation to other species. In both these chars' genes, the promoters are conserved mainly because they correspond to putative regulatory sequences (TATA box, binding sites for the pituitary transcription factor Pit-1 (F1-F4), CRE, GRE and RAR/RXR elements). The promoter of gh2 gene has a greater degree of polymorphism compared with gh1 gene promoter in all investigated species of salmonids. The observed differences in the rates of accumulation of changes in growth hormone encoding paralogs could be explained by differences in the intensity of selection.
Large numbers of statistically significant associations between sentinel SNPs and case-control status have been replicated by genome-wide association studies. Nevertheless, few underlying molecular mechanisms of complex disease are currently known. We investigated whether variation in binding of a transcription factor, the vitamin D receptor (VDR), whose activating ligand vitamin D has been proposed as a modifiable factor in multiple disorders, could explain any of these associations. VDR modifies gene expression by binding DNA as a heterodimer with the Retinoid X receptor (RXR). We identified 43,332 genetic variants significantly associated with altered VDR binding affinity (VDR-BVs) using a high-resolution (ChIP-exo) genome-wide analysis of 27 HapMap lymphoblastoid cell lines. VDR-BVs are enriched in consensus RXR::VDR binding motifs, yet most fell outside of these motifs, implying that genetic variation often affects the binding affinity only indirectly. Finally, we compared 341 VDR-BVs replicating by position in multiple individuals against background sets of variants lying within VDR-binding regions that had been matched in allele frequency and were independent with respect to linkage disequilibrium. In this stringent test, these replicated VDR-BVs were significantly (q &lt; 0.1) and substantially (&gt;2-fold) enriched in genomic intervals associated with autoimmune and other diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease, Crohn's disease and rheumatoid arthritis. The approach's validity is underscored by RXR::VDR motif sequence being predictive of binding strength and being evolutionarily constrained. Our findings are consistent with altered RXR::VDR binding contributing to immunity-related diseases. Replicated VDR-BVs associated with these disorders could represent causal disease risk alleles whose effect may be modifiable by vitamin D levels.
Taking advantage of a large transcriptomic dataset recently obtained in the sentinel crustacean amphipod Gammarus fossarum, we developed an approach based on sequence similarity and phylogenetic reconstruction to identify key players involved in the endocrine regulation of G. fossarum. Our work identified three genes of interest: the nuclear receptors RXR and E75, and the regulator broad-complex (BR). Their involvement in the regulation of molting and reproduction, along with their sensitivity to chemical contamination were experimentally assessed by studying gene expression during the female reproductive cycle, and after laboratory exposure to model endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs): pyriproxyfen, tebufenozide and piperonyl butoxide. RXR expression suggested a role of this gene in ecdysis and post-molting processes. E75 presented two expression peaks that suggested a role in vitellogenesis, and molting. BR expression showed no variation during molting/reproductive cycle. After exposure to the three EDCs, a strong inhibition of the inter-molt E75 peak was observed with tebufenozide, and an induction of RXR after exposure to pyriproxyfen and piperonyl butoxide. These results confirm the implication of RXR and E75 in hormonal regulation of female reproductive cycles in G. fossarum and their sensitivity towards EDCs opens the possibility of using them as specific endocrine disruption biomarkers.
Major depressive disorder is a severe neuropsychiatric disease that negatively impacts the quality of life of a large portion of the population. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying depression are still unclear. The pathogenesis of depression involves several brain regions. However, most previous studies have focused only on one specific brain region. Plasma and brain tissues exchange numerous components through the blood‑brain barrier. Therefore, in the present study, plasma samples from control (CON) mice and mice subjected to chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) were used to investigate the molecular pathogenesis of depression, and the association between the peripheral circulation and the central nervous system. A total of 47 significant differentially expressed proteins were identified between the CUMS and CON group by an isobaric tag for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ) coupled with tandem mass spectrometry approach. These 47 differentially expressed proteins were analyzed with ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA) software. This revealed that the acute phase response, LXR/RXR and FXR/RXR activation, the complement system and the intrinsic prothrombin activation pathway were significantly changed. Four of the significant differentially expressed proteins (lipopolysaccharide binding protein, fibrinogen β chain, α‑1 antitrypsin, and complement factor H) were validated by western blotting. the present findings provide a novel insight into the molecular pathogenesis of depression.
One major difference between limb and extraocular muscles (EOM) is the presence of an enriched population of Pitx2-positive myogenic precursor cells in EOM compared to limb muscle. We hypothesize that retinoic acid regulates Pitx2 expression in EOM myogenic precursor cells and that its effects would differ in leg muscle. The two muscle groups expressed differential retinoic acid receptor (RAR) and retinoid X receptor (RXR) levels. RXR co-localized with the Pitx2-positive cells but not with those expressing Pax7. EOM-derived and LEG-derived EECD34 cells were treated with vehicle, retinoic acid, the RXR agonist bexarotene, the RAR inverse agonist BMS493, or the RXR antagonist UVI 3003. In vitro, fewer EOM-derived EECD34 cells expressed desmin and fused, while more LEG-derived cells expressed desmin and fused when treated with retinoic acid compared to vehicle. Both EOM and LEG-derived EECD34 cells exposed to retinoic acid showed a higher percentage of cells expressing Pitx2 compared to vehicle, supporting the hypothesis that retinoic acid plays a role in maintaining Pitx2 expression. We hypothesize that retinoic acid signaling aids in the maintenance of large numbers of undifferentiated myogenic precursor cells in the EOM, which would be required to maintain EOM normalcy throughout a lifetime of myonuclear turnover.
Epidemiological studies have shown that many welders experience respiratory symptoms. During the welding process a large number of airborne nanosized particles are generated, which might be inhaled and deposited in the respiratory tract. Knowledge of the underlying mechanisms behind observed symptoms is still partly lacking, although inflammation is suggested to play a central role. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of welding fume particle exposure on the proteome expression level in welders suffering from respiratory symptoms, and changes in protein mediators in nasal lavage samples were analyzed. Such mediators will be helpful to clarify the pathomechanisms behind welding fume particle-induced effects.
In an exposure chamber, 11 welders with work-related symptoms in the lower airways during the last month were exposed to mild-steel welding fume particles (1 mg/m3) and to filtered air, respectively, in a double-blind manner. Nasal lavage samples were collected before, immediately after, and the day after exposure. The proteins in the nasal lavage were analyzed with two different mass spectrometry approaches, label-free discovery shotgun LC-MS/MS and a targeted selected reaction monitoring LC-MS/MS analyzing 130 proteins and four in vivo peptide degradation products.
The analysis revealed 30 significantly changed proteins that were associated with two main pathways; activation of acute phase response signaling and activation of LXR/RXR, which is a nuclear receptor family involved in lipid signaling. Connective tissue proteins and proteins controlling the degradation of such tissues, including two different matrix metalloprotease proteins, MMP8 and MMP9, were among the significantly changed enzymes and were identified as important key players in the pathways.
Exposure to mild-steel welding fume particles causes measurable changes on the proteome level in nasal lavage matrix in exposed welders, although no clinical symptoms were manifested. The results suggested that the exposure causes an immediate effect on the proteome level involving acute phase proteins and mediators regulating lipid signaling. Proteases involved in maintaining the balance between the formation and degradation of extracellular matrix proteins are important key proteins in the induced effects.
Contaminating proteins have been identified by “shotgun” proteomic analysis in 14 recombinant preparations of human membrane heme- and flavoproteins expressed in Escherichia coli and purified by immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography. Immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography of ten proteins was performed on Ni2+-NTA-sepharose 6B, and the remaining four proteins were purified by ligand affinity chromatography on 2',5'-ADP-sepharose 4B. Proteomic analysis allowed to detect 50 protein impurities from E. coli. The most common contaminant was Elongation factor Tu2. It is characterized by a large dipole moment and a cluster arrangement of acidic amino acid residues that mediate the specific interaction with the sorbent. Peptidyl prolyl-cis-trans isomerase SlyD, glutamine-fructose-6-phosphate aminotransferase, and catalase HPII that contained repeating HxH, QxQ, and RxR fragments capable of specific interaction with the sorbent were identified among the protein contaminants as well. GroL/GroS chaperonins were probably copurified due to the formation of complexes with the target proteins. The Ni2+ cations leakage from the sorbent during lead to formation of free carboxyl groups that is the reason of cation exchanger properties of the sorbent. This was the putative reason for the copurification of basic proteins, such as the ribosomal proteins of E. coli and the widely occurring uncharacterized protein YqjD. The results of the analysis revealed variation in the contaminant composition related to the type of protein expressed. This is probably related to the reaction of E. coli cell proteome to the expression of a foreign protein. We concluded that the nature of the protein contaminants in a preparation of a recombinant protein purified by immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography on a certain sorbent could be predicted if information on the host cell proteome were available.
CdxA is a homeobox gene of the caudal type that was previously shown to be expressed in the endoderm-derived gut epithelium during early embryogenesis. Expression of the CDXA protein was studied during intestine morphogenesis from stage 11 (13 somites) to adulthood in the chicken. The CDXA protein can be detected during all stages of gut closure, from stage 11 to 5 days of incubation, and is mainly localized to the intestinal portals, the region where the splanchnopleure is undergoing closure. In this region, which represents the transition between the open and closed gut, the CDXA protein is restricted to the endoderm-derived epithelium. At about day 5 of incubation, the process of formation of the previllous ridges begins, which marks the beginning of the morphogenesis of the villi. From this stage to day 11 expression of CDXA is localized to the epithelial lining of the intestine. In parallel, a gradual increase in CDXA protein expression begins in the mesenchyme that is close in proximity to the CDXA-positive endoderm. Maximal CDXA levels in the mesenchyme are observed at day 9 of incubation. During days 10 and 11 CDXA levels in the mesenchyme remain constant, and by day 12 CDXA becomes undetectable in these cells and the epithelium again becomes the main site of expression. From day 12 of incubation until adulthood the CDXA protein is present in the intestinal epithelium. Until day 18 of incubation expression can be detected along the whole length of the villus with a stronger signal at the tip. With hatching the distribution along the villi changes so that the main site of CDXA protein expression is at the base of the villi and in the crypts. The transient expression of CDXA in the mesenchyme between days 5 and 11 may be related to the interactions taking place between the mesenchyme and the epithelium that ultimately result in the axial specification of the alimentary canal and the differentiation of its various epithelia. The main CDXA spatial distribution during morphogenesis suggests a tight linkage to the formation and differentiation of the intestinal epithelium itself. CDXA appears to play a role in the morphogenetic events leading to closure of the alimentary canal. During previllous ridge formation the CDXA protein is transiently expressed in the mesenchymal cells thought to provide instructive interactions for the regionalization and differentiation of the gut epithelium.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
Helicobacter pylori encoded CagA is presently the only known virulence factor that is injected into gastric epithelial cells where it destroys apical junctional complexes and induces dedifferentiation of gastric epithelial cells, leading to H. pylori-related gastric carcinogensis. However, little is known about the molecular mechanisms by which CagA mediates these changes. Caudal-related homeobox 2 (Cdx2) is an intestine-specific transcription factor highly expressed in multistage tissues of dysplasia and cancer. One specific target of Cdx2, Claudin-2, is involved in the regulation of tight junction (TJ) permeability. In this study, our findings showed that the activity of Cdx2 binding to Cdx binding sites of CdxA (GTTTATG) and CdxB (TTTTAGG) of probes corresponding to claudin-2 flanking region increased in AGS cells, infected with CagA positive wild-type strain of H. pylori, compared to CagA negative isogenic mutant-type strain. Moreover, Cdx2 upregulated claudin-2 expression at transcriptional level and translational level. In the meantime, we found that TJs of AGS cells, infected with CagA positive wild-type strain of H. pylori, compared to CagA negative isogenic mutant-type strain, were more severely destroyed, leading to wider cell gap, interference of contact, scattering and highly elevated migration of cells. Herein, this study is firstly demonstrated that H. pylori-encoded CagA disrupts TJs and induces invasiveness of AGS gastric carcinoma cells via Cdx2-dependent targeting of Claudin-2. This provides a new mechanism whereby CagA induced dedifferentiation of AGS cells, leading to malignant behavior of biology.
Ingestion of carbohydrates from the small intestine is the major route of energy supply in animals. In mammals these functions develop both pre- and postnatally and are coordinated for the sucking period. In birds, the physiological requirements are different and hatchlings ingest diets rich in complex carbohydrates soon after hatching. The present study examined the ontogeny of intestinal carbohydrate uptake in the chicken. The expression of mRNA for a brush border enzyme, sucrase-isomaltase (SI), which is critical in disaccharide digestion, was determined, together with that of the Na-glucose transporter (SGLT)-1, which is the major apical glucose transporter, In addition, the homeobox gene cdx, which is involved in inducing SI expression in mammals was examined. It was found that the expression of cdxA mRNA and cdxA protein increased from day 15 of incubation until hatch, after which further changes were small. CdxA protein was shown to bind to the promoter region of SI in the chick indicating that cdxA is similar to the mammalian cdx2. The mRNA of SI was observed at 15 d incubation, increased from 17 d of incubation to a peak on day 19, decreased at hatch and had a further peak of expression 2 d post-hatch. In contrast, the mRNA of SGLT-1 was not detected until 19 d of incubation when a major peak of expression was observed followed by a decrease to low levels at hatch and small increases post-hatch. It appears that both SI and SGLT-1 mRNA are expressed before hatch in the chick, but the ontogeny of expression is controlled by different mechanisms.
Nuclear receptors (NRs) rely on coregulator proteins to modulate transcription of target genes. NR coregulators can be broadly subdivided into coactivators which potentiate transcription and corepressors which silence gene expression. The prevailing view of coregulator action holds that in the absence of agonist the receptor interacts with a corepressor via the corepressor nuclear receptor (CoRNR, "corner") box motifs within the corepressor. Upon agonist binding, a conformational change in the receptor causes the shedding of corepressor and the binding of a coactivator which interacts with the receptor via NR boxes within the coregulator. This view was challenged with the discovery of RIP140 which acts as a NR corepressor in the presence of agonist and utilizes NR boxes. Since then a number of other corepressors of agonist-bound NRs have been discovered. Among them are LCoR, PRAME, REA, MTA1, NSD1, and COPR1 Although they exhibit a great diversity of structure, mechanism of repression and pathophysiological function, these corepressors frequently have one or more NR boxes and often recruit histone deacetylases to exert their repressive effects. This review highlights these more recently discovered corepressors and addresses their potential functions in transcription regulation, disease pharmacologic responses and xenobiotic metabolism.
Keratinocyte (KC) gene expression is regulated by members of the nuclear receptor (NR) superfamily including retinoic acid receptors, retinoid X receptors (RAR and RXR, respectively), and peroxisome proliferator activated receptors (PPAR). In addition to ligand, NR transcriptional activity is controlled by interaction with proteins, collectively known as coregulators, which function as corepressors or coactivators. To improve our understanding of coregulators expressed in epidermis, we screened a KC cDNA library for PPARalpha-interacting proteins. The screen yielded previously unknown proteins including one we named COPR1, for comodulator of PPAR and RXR. COPR1 and its longer variant COPR2 target the AF-2 domains of NR but exhibit quantitative differences in their functional interactions with RAR, RXRalpha and PPAR. They decrease but do not completely repress the activity of RXRalpha and PPARalpha because of a proline-acid-rich autonomous activation domain. An NR box motif contributes to but is not solely responsible for functional and physical association with RXRalpha. The activation domain, their relatively small size (COPR1, 26.9 kDa; COPR2, 32.4 kDa), and strict dependence on AF-2 for interaction distinguish COPR1 and COPR2 from the SMRT/NCoR type of corepressor and may represent a means of control that dampens rather than completely represses NR-mediated gene expression.
To compare responses of a soil bacterium to Cu and Cd.
In minimal medium, Cd caused a dose-dependent growth stasis of logarithmic phase cells of Pseudomonas putida, strain KT2440, whereas Cu did not compromise growth up to 10 mg l(-1). Proteomics showed changes in accumulation of both membrane and soluble proteins by 6 h of treatment; increased Krebs cycle enzymes were apparent. Transcript analysis showed Cd- and Cu-induced different genes. Cd-induced genes encoding the transcriptional regulator CzrR2; an outer membrane protein associated with lipopolysaccharide stability, H1; two oxidative stress protective proteins and the P-type ATPase, CadA2, associated with Cd(2+) efflux. The genes most responsive to Cu encoded the regulator CopR1 and the outer membrane resistance protein regulated by CopR1, CopB1; a putative porin, PorD and the Cu-binding protein, PacZ or CopZ, and CopA2.
These findings support that a soil pseudomonad restricts internalization of the metals by using different sets of binding proteins and efflux pumps. Activation of mechanisms to protect against oxidative stress also was evident especially with Cd exposure.
The differential cellular responses to Cd and Cu suggest that risk assessment for Cd and Cu should be different.
Bacterial response to metals can require complex regulation. We report an overlapping regulation for copper and zinc resistance genes in the denitrifying bacterium, Pseudomonas stutzeri RCH2, by three two-component regulatory proteins CopR1, CopR2 and CzcR. We conducted genome-wide evaluations to identify gene targets of two paralogous regulators, CopR1 and CopR2, annotated for copper signaling, and compared the results with the gene targets for CzcR, implicated in zinc signaling. We discovered that the CopRs and CzcR have largely common targets, and crossregulate a core set of P. stutzeri copper and zinc responsive genes. We established that this crossregulation is enabled by a conserved binding motif in the upstream regulatory regions of the target genes. The crossregulation is physiologically relevant as these regulators synergistically and antagonistically target multicopper oxidases, metal efflux and sequestration systems. CopR1 and CopR2 upregulate two cop operons encoding copper tolerance genes, while all three regulators downregulate a putative copper chaperone, Psest_1595. CzcR also upregulated the oprD gene and the CzcIABC Zn2+ efflux system, while CopR1 and CopR2 downregulated these genes. Our study suggests that crossregulation of copper and zinc homeostasis can be advantageous, and in P. stutzeri this is enabled by shared binding motifs for multiple response regulators.
A growth factor, as initially defined, is a secreted biologically active molecule that can affect the growth of cells. This definition has been expanded to include secreted molecules that promote or inhibit mitosis or affect cellular differentiation (1). Growth factors can act on specific cell surface receptors that are then able to transmit their growth signals to other intracellular components and eventually alter gene expression. The general process of transmitting an external molecular signal to a cell to evoke a cellular response is called signal transduction. Protein phosphorylation cascades play a key role in transmitting growth signals (2). Enzymes with kinase activity or phosphatase activity are important in this signaling process. Kinases put a phosphate group on a protein, and phosphatases take off a phosphate group. Many growth factors are peptides/proteins, and this type of growth factor typically binds with high affinity to a specific surface receptor which is a plasma membrane-bound protein. A peptide is defined as having between two and 50 amino acid residues, whereas a protein has more than 50 amino acid residues. The receptor binding site for peptide/protein growth factors is on the outer cell membrane surface, in other words, the extracellular domain. Most cell surface receptors for growth factors show tyrosine kinase activity, meaning they put a phosphate group on a downstream protein tyrosine residue. An exception is the surface receptors for the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) family of cytokines. When activated by binding of TGF-beta cytokines, this receptor can phosphorylate downstream proteins on serine and threonine residues. “Downstream” here means an event triggered after TGF-beta binding to its receptor. Some growth factors are small peptides called cytokines. While all cytokines affect signal transduction pathways, only those cytokines affecting cell growth/differentiation signaling pathways are considered growth factors. Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) is an example of a cytokine growth factor since it promotes the production of white blood cells by stem cells. Examples of protein growth factors are vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), epidermal growth factor (EGF) and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF). Growth factor specificity to particular cells types can be achieved by the expression of highly specific cell surface receptors. For example, some growth factors act only hematopoietic cells which are cells derived from bone marrow. Some growth factors like lipid-soluble steroid hormones, do not have a surface receptor and can directly pass through the cell's plasma membrane, bind to an intracellular protein receptor, or nuclear receptors, and then transmit a growth signal. All hormones are produced by glands and are secreted into the circulatory system. Estrogens, androgens, and progestogens are examples of steroid hormones that are growth factors. Not all hormones are growth factors, only those affecting cell growth/differentiation. Even simple small molecules such as nitric oxide or reactive oxygen species (ROS) can act as growth factors.
Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors (VEGFs) are promising molecules for the treatment of ischemic diseases by pro-angiogenic therapy. Snake venom VEGFs are a novel subgroup with unique receptor binding profiles and as such are potential new therapeutic agents. We determined the ligand-receptor interactions, gene regulation and angiogenic properties of Vipera ammodytes venom VEGF, Vammin, and compared it to the canonical angiogenic factor VEGF-A to evaluate the use of Vammin for therapeutic angiogenesis. Vammin efficiently induced VEGFR-2 mediated proliferation and expression of genes associated with proliferation, migration and angiogenesis. VEGF-A165 and especially VEGF-A109 induced less pronounced effects. Vammin regulates a number of signaling pathways by inducing the expression of NR4A family nuclear receptors and regulators of calcium signaling and MAP kinase pathways. Interestingly, MARC1, which encodes an enzyme discovered to catalyze reduction of nitrate to NO, was identified as a novel VEGFR-2 regulated gene. In rabbit skeletal muscle adenoviral delivery of Vammin induced prominent angiogenic responses. Both the vector dose and the co-receptor binding of the ligand were critical parameters controlling the type of angiogenic response from sprouting angiogenesis to vessel enlargement. Vammin induced VEGFR-2/NRP-1 mediated signaling more effectively than VEGF-A, consequently it is a promising candidate for development of pro-angiogenic therapies.
Many patients worldwide suffer from cardiovascular diseases for which an underlying factor is thrombosis. Devising a molecular imaging technique for early detection of thrombosis in a clinical setting is highly recommended. Because fibrin is a major constituent of clots and is present in all types of thrombi but absent in circulation, it is a highly specific and sensitive target for molecular imaging of thrombi. It is assumed that cyclization of peptides will improve the receptor binding affinity and stability of the peptide. In the present study, we have developed linear and cyclic fibrin-binding peptides for thrombus imaging and compared their biological properties.
Linear HYNIC-GPRPP and cyclic HYNIC-CGPRPPC peptides were synthesized using a standard Fmoc strategy and radiolabeled with Tc-99m. The stability of the radiolabeled peptides in human plasma and their affinity for fibrin and blood clots were determined. Blood clearance and biodistribution were evaluated in rats and mice, respectively. The peptide with the highest affinity was injected to a live rabbit femoral thrombosis model, and scintigraphic images were obtained.
In vitro studies show that peptides are stable in human plasma and have a high affinity for human fibrin. They also demonstrated fast blood clearance in rats and high thrombus uptake in the Balb/c mice femoral thrombosis model. Femoral thrombosis was visualized 30 min postinjection of cyclic peptide in a live rabbit model using single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT)/X-ray computed tomography.
The results indicate that the cyclic peptide is a promising agent for molecular imaging of fibrin using SPECT.
The class III phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase complex I (PI3KC3-C1) is central to autophagy initiation. We previously reported the V-shaped architecture of the four-subunit version of PI3KC3-C1 consisting of VPS (vacuolar protein sorting) 34, VPS15, BECN1 (Beclin 1), and ATG (autophagy-related) 14. Here we show that a putative fifth subunit, nuclear receptor binding factor 2 (NRBF2), is a tightly bound component of the complex that profoundly affects its activity and architecture. NRBF2 enhances the lipid kinase activity of the catalytic subunit, VPS34, by roughly 10-fold. We used hydrogen-deuterium exchange coupled to mass spectrometry and negative-stain electron microscopy to map NRBF2 to the base of the V-shaped complex. NRBF2 interacts primarily with the N termini of ATG14 and BECN1. We show that NRBF2 is a homodimer and drives the dimerization of the larger PI3KC3-C1 complex, with implications for the higher-order organization of the preautophagosomal structure.
Mounting evidence demonstrates that CYP2B6 plays a much larger role in human drug metabolism than was previously believed. The discovery of multiple important substrates of CYP2B6 as well as polymorphic differences has sparked increasing interest in the genetic and xenobiotic factors contributing to the expression and function of the enzyme. The expression of CYP2B6 is regulated primarily by the xenobiotic receptors constitutive androstane receptor (CAR) and pregnane X receptor (PXR) in the liver. In addition to CYP2B6, these receptors also mediate the inductive expression of CYP3A4, and a number of important phase II enzymes and drug transporters. CYP2B6 has been demonstrated to play a role in the metabolism of 2%-10% of clinically used drugs including widely used antineoplastic agents cyclophosphamide and ifosfamide, anesthetics propofol and ketamine, synthetic opioids pethidine and methadone, and the antiretrovirals nevirapine and efavirenz, among others. Significant inter-individual variability in the expression and function of the human CYP2B6 gene exists and can result in altered clinical outcomes in patients receiving treatment with CYP2B6-substrate drugs. These variances arise from a number of sources including genetic polymorphism, and xenobiotic intervention. In this review, we will provide an overview of the key players in CYP2B6 expression and function and highlight recent advances made in assessing clinical ramifications of important CYP2B6-mediated drug-drug interactions.
We demonstrate that OCT4 expression is regulated by germ cell nuclear factor (GCNF) via its interactions with three nuclear receptor (NR) binding sites within OCT4 promoter conserved regions (CRs) in human embryonic carcinoma (EC) NCCIT cells. OCT4 expression is gradually reduced during the retinoic acid-induced differentiation, while GCNF temporarily increased after 2 days and then significantly decreased. In addition, OCT4 expression is significantly reduced by overexpression of exogenous GCNF, but increased by GCNF shRNA-mediated knockdown. The transcriptional activity of OCT4 is significantly inhibited by dose-dependent overexpression of GCNF. While mutants at each of the NR binding sites retain the repressive effects of GCNF on OCT4 promoter activity, the repressive effect was completely eliminated in the reporter construct with all binding sites mutated even in the presence of GCNF. Furthermore, the transcriptional activity of native minimal promoter (CR1-Luc) containing the first NR binding site was significantly reduced by GCNF overexpression, while the mutant retained basal activity to some extent. Next, an exogenous minimal ti promoter-inserted CR2 reporter construct containing the second and third NR binding sites (CR2-ti-Luc) was co-transfected with GCNF expression vector. The transcriptional activity of CR2-ti-Luc was significantly decreased by GCNF overexpression, while mutation of both binding sites retained the transcriptional activity of the reporter construct. Binding assays confirmed the direct interaction of GCNF with all three NR binding sites cooperatively. Taken together, GCNF acts as a transcriptional repressor in the regulation of OCT4 gene expression through cooperative interaction with three NR binding elements in pluripotent NCCIT cells.
Alzheimer disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disease characterized by the deposition of amyloid plaque in the brain. The autophagy-associated PIK3C3-containing phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PtdIns3K) complex has been shown to interfere with APP metabolism and amyloid beta peptide (Aβ) homeostasis via poorly understood mechanisms. Here we report that NRBF2 (nuclear receptor binding factor 2), a key component and regulator of the PtdIns3K, is involved in APP-CTFs homeostasis in AD cell models. We found that NRBF2 interacts with APP in vivo and its expression levels are reduced in hippocampus of 5XFAD AD mice; we further demonstrated that NRBF2 overexpression promotes degradation of APP C-terminal fragments (APP-CTFs), and reduces Aβ1-40 and Aβ1-42 levels in human mutant APP-overexpressing cells. Conversely, APP-CTFs, Aβ1-40 and Aβ1-42 levels were increased in Nrbf2 knockdown or nrbf2 knockout cells. Furthermore, NRBF2 positively regulates autophagy in neuronal cells and NRBF2-mediated reduction of APP-CTFs levels is autophagy dependent. Importantly, nrbf2 knockout attenuates the recruitment of APP and APP-CTFs into phagophores and the sorting of APP and APP-CTFs into endosomal intralumenal vesicles, which is accompanied by the accumulation of the APP and APP-CTFs into RAB5-positive early endosomes. Collectively, our results reveal the potential connection between NRBF2 and the AD-associated protein APP by showing that NRBF2 plays an important role in regulating degradation of APP-CTFs through modulating autophagy.
Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have identified dozens of loci associated with gout, but for most cases, the risk genes and the underlying molecular mechanisms contributing to these associations are unknown. This study sought to understand the molecular mechanism of a common genetic variant, rs780093, in the development of gout, both in vitro and in vivo.
Nuclear receptor binding protein 1 (NRBP1), as a gout risk gene, and its regulatory region, 72 bp upstream of the transcription start site, designated as B1, were identified through integrative analyses of genome-wide genotype and DNA methylation data. We observed elevated NRBP1 expression in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from gout patients. In vitro luciferase reporter and protein pulldown assay results showed that DNA methylation could increase the binding of the transcription factor TFAP2A to B1, leading to suppressed gene expression. There results were further confirmed by in vivo bisulfite pyrosequencing showing that hypomethylation on B1 is associated with increased NRBP1 expression in gout patients.
Hypomethylation at the promoter region of NRBP1 reduces the binding of TFAP2A and thus leads to elevated NRBP1 expression, which might contribute to the development of gout.
Epigenetic modulators play critical roles in reprogramming of cellular functions, emerging as a new class of promising therapeutic targets. Nuclear receptor binding SET domain protein 3 (NSD3) is a member of the lysine methyltransferase family. Interestingly, the short isoform of NSD3 without the methyltransferase fragment, NSD3S, exhibits oncogenic activity in a wide range of cancers. We recently showed that NSD3S interacts with MYC, a central regulator of tumorigenesis, suggesting a mechanism by which NSD3S regulates cell proliferation through engaging MYC. Thus, small molecule inhibitors of the NSD3S/MYC interaction will be valuable tools for understanding the function of NSD3 in tumorigenesis for potential cancer therapeutic discovery. Here we report the development of a cell lysate-based time-resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer (TR-FRET) assay in an ultrahigh-throughput screening (uHTS) format to monitor the interaction of NSD3S with MYC. In our TR-FRET assay, anti-Flag-terbium and anti-glutathione S-transferase (GST)-d2, a paired fluorophores, were used to indirectly label Flag-tagged NSD3 and GST-MYC in HEK293T cell lysates. This TR-FRET assay is robust in a 1,536-well uHTS format, with signal-to-background &gt;8 and a Z' factor &gt;0.7. A pilot screening with the Spectrum library of 2,000 compounds identified several positive hits. One positive compound was confirmed to disrupt the NSD3/MYC interaction in an orthogonal protein-protein interaction assay. Thus, our optimized uHTS assay could be applied to future scaling up of a screening campaign to identify small molecule inhibitors targeting the NSD3/MYC interaction.
Notch signaling as a conserved cell fate regulator is involved in the regulation of cell quiescence, proliferation, differentiation and postnatal tissue regeneration. However, how Notch signaling regulates porcine satellite cells (PSCs) has not been elucidated. We stably transfected Notch1 intracellular domain (N1ICD) into PSCs to analyze the gene expression profile and miRNA-seq. The analysis of the gene expression profile identified 295 differentially-expressed genes (DEGs) in proliferating-N1ICD PSCs (P-N1ICD) and nine DEGs on differentiating-N1ICD PSCs (D-N1ICD), compared with that in control groups (P-Control and D-Control, respectively). Analyzing the underlying function of DEGs showed that most of the upregulated DEGs enriched in P-N1ICD PSCs are related to the cell cycle. Forty-four and 12 known differentially-expressed miRNAs (DEMs) were identified in the P-N1ICD PSCs and D-N1ICD PSCs group, respectively. Furthermore, we constructed the gene-miRNA network of the DEGs and DEMs. In P-N1ICD PSCs, miR-125a, miR-125b, miR-10a-5p, ssc-miR-214, miR-423 and miR-149 are downregulated hub miRNAs, whose corresponding hub genes are marker of proliferation Ki-67 (MKI67) and nuclear receptor binding SET domain protein 2 (WHSC1). By contrast, miR-27a, miR-146a-5p and miR-221-3p are upregulated hub miRNAs, whose hub genes are RUNX1 translocation partner 1 (RUNX1T1) and fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2). All the hub miRNAs and genes are associated with cell proliferation. Quantitative RT-PCR results are consistent with the gene expression profile and miRNA-seq results. The results of our study provide valuable information for understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying Notch signaling in PSCs and skeletal muscle development.
Mild exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation is also harmful and hazardous to the skin and often causes a photosensitivity disorder accompanied by sunburn. To understand the action of UV on the skin we performed a microarray analysis to isolate UV-sensitive genes. We show here that UV irradiation promoted sunburn and downregulated filaggrin (Flg); fucoxanthin (FX) exerted a protective effect. In vitro analysis showed that UV irradiation of human dermal fibroblasts caused production of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) without cellular toxicity. ROS production was diminished by N-acetylcysteine (NAC) or FX, but not by retinoic acid (RA). In vivo analysis showed that UV irradiation caused sunburn and Flg downregulation, and that FX, but not NAC, RA or clobetasol, exerted a protective effect. FX stimulated Flg promoter activity in a concentration-dependent manner. Flg promoter deletion and chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis showed that caudal type homeo box transcription factor 1 (Cdx1) was a key factor for Flg induction. Cdx1 was also downregulated in UV-exposed skin. Therefore, our data suggested that the protective effects of FX against UV-induced sunburn might be exerted by promotion of skin barrier formation through induction of Flg, unrelated to quenching of ROS or an RA-like action.
Serial cloning by somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) is a critical tool for the expansion of precious transgenic lines or resetting the lifespan of primary transgenic cells for multiple genetic modifications. We successfully produced second-generation cloned goats using donor neonatal fibroblasts from first-generation clones. However, our attempts to produce any third-generation clones failed. SCNT efficiency decreased progressively with the clonal generations. The rate of pregnancy loss was significantly greater in recloning groups (P&lt;0.05). While no pregnancy loss was observed during the first round of SCNT, 14 out of 21 pregnancies aborted in the second round of SCNT and all pregnancies aborted in the third round of SCNT. In this retrospective study, we also investigated the expression of 21 developmentally important genes in muscle tissue of cloned (G1) and recloned (G2) offspring. The expression of most of these genes in live clones was found to be largely comparable to naturally reproduced control goats, but fibroblast growth factor 10 (FGF10), methyl CpG binding protein 2 (MECP2) and growth factor receptor bound protein 10 (GRB10) were differentially expressed (P&lt;0.05) in G2 goats compared with G1 and controls. To study the effects of serial cloning on DNA methylation, the methylation pattern of differentially methylated regions in imprinted genes H19 and insulin like growth factor 2 receptor (IGF2R) were also analysed. Aberrant H19 DNA methylation patterns were detected in G1 and G2 clones.
Chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps is characterized by a T helper cell 2-skewed upper airway inflammation. Mucosal Staphylococcus aureus colonization is found in the majority of nasal polyps patients. Staphylococcus aureus is known to induce type 2 cytokine release via enterotoxins.
We investigated the impact of non-enterotoxin producing Staphylococcus aureus on type 2 cytokine release.
Thymic stromal lymphopoietin, interleukin-33 and type 2 cytokines were assessed in a human mucosal tissue model upon Staphylococcus aureus infection.
Staphylococcus aureus exposure increased the expression of interleukin-33, thymic stromal lymphopoietin, interleukin-5 and interleukin-13 in nasal polyps tissue, accompanied by elevated expression levels of thymic stromal lymphopoietin and interleukin-33 receptors; on predominantly CD3+T cells. Staphylococcus aureus infection led to the release of thymic stromal lymphopoietin, but not interleukin-33, interleukin-5 or interleukin-13, from healthy inferior turbinate tissue. In contrast, Staphylococcus epidermidis did not induce any epithelial cell-derived cytokine in nasal polyp or healthy tissue. Staphylococcus aureus infection also increased the release of interleukin-33 and thymic stromal lymphopoietin in BEAS-2B epithelial cells, accompanied by activation of nuclear factor-κappaB pathways. Incubation with CU-CPT22, a specific toll like receptor 2 antagonist, significantly reduced the Staphylococcus aureus-induced release of thymic stromal lymphopoietin, interleukin-33 and the activity of the nuclear factor-κappa B signal in BEAS-2B cells.
This study has for the first time demonstrated that Staphylococcus aureus can directly induce epithelial cell-derived cytokine release via binding to toll like receptor 2, and may thereby propagate type 2 cytokine expression in nasal polyp tissue.
The tripartite motif protein 38 (TRIM38), a member of the TRIM family, is involved in various cellular processes such as cell proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, and antiviral defense. However, the role of TRIM38 in osteoclast and osteoblast differentiation is not yet known. In this study, we report the involvement of TRIM38 in osteoclast and osteoblast differentiation. Overexpression of TRIM38, in osteoclast precursor cells, attenuated receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B ligand (RANKL)-induced osteoclast formation, RANKL-triggered NF-κB activation, and expression of osteoclast marker genes, such as NFATc1, osteoclast-associated receptor (OSCAR), and tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP); and down-regulation of TRIM38 expression showed the opposite effects. Ectopic expression of TRIM38 in osteoblast precursors induced increased osteoblast differentiation and function. Elevated expression of alkaline phosphatase (ALP), bone sialoprotein (BSP), and osteocalcin was also observed due to blockade of NF-κB activation. Conversely, knockdown of TRIM38 showed the opposite effects. TRIM38 also induced degradation of lysosome-dependent transforming growth factor beta-activated kinase 1 and MAP3K7-binding protein 2 (TAB2), further blocking NF-κB activation. Taken together, our data suggest that TRIM38 plays a critical role in bone remodeling as a negative regulator of NF-κB in both osteoclast and osteoblast differentiation.
2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) induces hepatic oxidative stress following activation of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR). Our recent studies showed TCDD induced pyruvate kinase muscle isoform 2 (Pkm2) as a novel antioxidant response in normal differentiated hepatocytes. To investigate cooperative regulation between nuclear factor, erythroid derived 2, like 2 (Nrf2) and the AhR in the induction of Pkm2, hepatic ChIP-seq analyses were integrated with RNA-seq time course data from mice treated with TCDD for 2 - 168h. ChIP-seq analysis 2h after TCDD treatment identified genome-wide NRF2 enrichment. Approximately 842 NRF2 enriched regions were located in the regulatory region of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) while 579 DEGs showed both NRF2 and AhR enrichment. Sequence analysis of regions with overlapping NRF2 and AhR enrichment showed over-representation of either antioxidant or dioxin response elements (ARE and DRE, respectively), although 18 possessed both motifs. NRF2 exhibited negligible enrichment within a closed Pkm chromatin region while the AhR was enriched 29-fold. Furthermore, TCDD induced Pkm2 in primary hepatocytes from wild-type and Nrf2 null mice, indicating NRF2 is not required. Although NRF2 and AhR cooperate to regulate numerous antioxidant gene expression responses, the induction of Pkm2 by TCDD is independent of ROS-mediated NRF2 activation.
The mechanisms by which the liver fails in end-stage liver disease remain elusive. Disruption of the transcription factor network in hepatocytes has been suggested to mediate terminal liver failure in animals. However, this hypothesis remains unexplored in human subjects. To study the relevance of transcription factor expression in terminal stages of chronic liver failure in humans, we analyzed the expression of liver-enriched transcription factors (LETFs) hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF)4α, HNF1α, forkhead box protein A2 (FOXA2), CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (CEBP)α, and CEBPβ. We then selected downstream genes responsible for some hepatic functions (ornithine transcarbamylase [OTC], cytochrome P450 3A4 [CYP3A4], coagulation factor VII [F7], cadherin 1 [CDH1], phospho-ezrin (Thr567)/radixin (Thr564)/moesin (Thr558) [p-ERM], phospho-myosin light chain [p-MLC], low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 [LRP1]) in liver tissue from patients at different stages of decompensated liver function based upon Child-Pugh classification, Model for End-Stage Liver Disease score, and degree of inflammatory activity/fibrosis. We first examined differential expression of LETF and determined whether a relationship exists between transcript and protein expression, and liver function. We found HNF4α expression was down-regulated and correlated well with the extent of liver dysfunction (P = 0.001), stage of fibrosis (P = 0.0005), and serum levels of total bilirubin (P = 0.009; r = 0.35), albumin (P &lt; 0.001; r = 0.52), and prothrombin time activity (P = 0.002; r = 0.41). HNF4α expression also correlated with CYP3A4, OTC, and F7 as well as CDH1 RNA levels. The Rho/Rho-associated protein kinase pathways, which have been implicated in the regulation of HNF4α, were also differentially expressed, in concert with LRP1, a reported upstream regulator of RhoA function. Conclusion: HNF4α and other members of the LETFs appear to be important regulators of hepatocyte function in patients with chronic hepatic failure. (Hepatology Communications 2018;2:582-594).
Stressful conditions occuring during cancer, inflammation or infection activate adaptive responses that are controlled by the unfolded protein response (UPR) and the nuclear factor of kappa light polypeptide gene enhancer in B-cells (NF-κB) signaling pathway. These systems can be triggered by chemical compounds but also by cytokines, toll-like receptor ligands, nucleic acids, lipids, bacteria and viruses. Despite representing unique signaling cascades, new data indicate that the UPR and NF-κB pathways converge within the nucleus through ten major transcription factors (TFs), namely activating transcription factor (ATF)4, ATF3, CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (CEBP) homologous protein (CHOP), X-box-binding protein (XBP)1, ATF6α and the five NF-κB subunits. The combinatorial occupancy of numerous genomic regions (enhancers and promoters) coordinates the transcriptional activation or repression of hundreds of genes that collectively determine the balance between metabolic and inflammatory phenotypes and the extent of apoptosis and autophagy or repair of cell damage and survival. Here, we also discuss results from genetic experiments and chemical activators of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress that suggest a link to the cytosolic inhibitor of NF-κB (IκB)α degradation pathway. These data show that the UPR affects this major control point of NF-κB activation through several mechanisms. Taken together, available evidence indicates that the UPR and NF-κB interact at multiple levels. This crosstalk provides ample opportunities to fine-tune cellular stress responses and could also be exploited therapeutically in the future.
Lambertianic acid (LA) is a biologically active compound from the leaves of Pinus koraiensis. In the present study, apoptotic mechanisms of LA plus TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) were elucidated in non-small cell lung cancer cells (NSCLCs). Cytotoxicity assay, flow cytometry, immunoprecipitation, and Western blotting were performed. Here, combined treatment of LA and TRAIL increased cytotoxicity, sub-G1 population, cleaved poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), and caspase3/8/9 in A549 and H1299 cells compared to LA or TRAIL alone. Furthermore, combined treatment of LA and TRAIL significantly decreased antiapoptotic proteins such as B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2), Fas-like inhibitor protein (FLIP), and X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP), and enhanced the activation of proapoptotic proteins Bid compared to LA or TRAIL alone. In addition, combined treatment of LA and TRAIL upregulated the expression of Death receptor 4 (DR4) and downregulated phosphorylation of nuclear factor κ-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (p-NF-κB), inhibitory protein of kB family (p-IκB), and FLIP in A549 and H1299 cells along with disrupted binding of XIAP with caspase3 or NF-κB. Overall, these findings suggest that lambertianic acid enhances TRAIL-induced apoptosis via inhibition of XIAP/NF-κB in TRAIL resistant NSCLCs.
There is considerable interest in the ex vivo propagation of primary human basal epithelial stem/progenitor cells with a view to their use in drug development, toxicity testing and regenerative medicine. These cells can be expanded in co-culture with mitotically inactivated 3T3-J2 murine embryonic feeder cells but, similar to other epithelial cell culture systems employing 3T3-J2 cells, the aspects of cross-talk between 3T3-J2 cells and human airway basal cells that are critical for their expansion remain largely unknown. In this study, we investigated secreted growth factors that are produced by 3T3-J2 cells and act upon primary human airway basal cells. We found robust production of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) from fibroblast feeder cells following mitotic inactivation. Consistent with the limited cross-species reactivity of murine HGF on the human HGF receptor (MET; HGFR), MET inhibition did not affect proliferative responses in human airway basal cells and HGF could not replace feeder cells in this culture system. However, we found that murine HGF is not completely inactive on human airway epithelial cells or cancer cell lines but stimulates the phosphorylation of GRB2-associated-binding protein 2 (GAB2) and signal transducer and activator of transcription 6 (STAT6). Although HGF induces phosphorylation of STAT6 tyrosine 641 (Y641), there is no subsequent STAT6 nuclear translocation or STAT6-driven transcriptional response. Overall, these findings highlight the relevance of cross-species protein interactions between murine feeder cells and human epithelial cells in 3T3-J2 co-culture and demonstrate that STAT6 phosphorylation occurs in response to MET activation in epithelial cells. However, STAT6 nuclear translocation does not occur in response to HGF, precluding the transcriptional activity of STAT6.
The clinical application of GX1, an optimal gastric cancer (GC) targeting peptide, is greatly limited because its receptor in the GC vasculature is unknown. In this study, we screened the candidate receptor of GX1, transglutaminase-2(TGM2), by co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) combined with mass spectrometry. We found that TGM2 was up-regulated in GC vascular endothelial cells and that GX1 receptor expression was suppressed correspondingly after TGM2 downregulation. A highly consistent co-localization of GX1 receptor and TGM2 was detected at both the cellular and tissue levels. High TGM2 expression was evident in GC tissues from patients with poor prognosis. After TGM2 downregulation, the GX1-mediated inhibition of proliferation and migration and the induction of the apoptosis of GC vascular endothelial cells were weakened or even reversed. Finally, we observed that GX1 could inhibit the GTP-binding activity of TGM2 by reducing its intracellular distribution and downregulating its downstream molecular targets (nuclear factor-kappa B, NF-κB; hypoxia-inducible factor 1-α, HIF1α) in GC vascular endothelial cells. Our study confirms that peptide GX1 can inhibit angiogenesis by directly binding to TGM2, subsequently reducing the GTP-binding activity of TGM2 and thereby suppressing its downstream pathway(NF-κB/HIF1α). Our conclusions suggest that GX1/TGM2 may provide a new target for the diagnosis and treatment of GC.
The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of targeted photoimmunotherapy (PIT) in vitro on cell lines with various expression levels of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) using an anti-EGFR targeted conjugate composed of Cetuximab and IR700DX, phthalocyanine dye.
Relative EGFR density and cell binding assay was conducted in three human head &amp; neck cancer cell lines (scc-U2, scc-U8, and OSC19) and one reference cell line A431. After incubation with the conjugate for 1 or 24 hours, cellular uptake and localization were investigated by confocal laser scanning microscopy and quantified by image analysis. Cell survival was determined using the MTS assay and alamarBlue assay after PIT with a 690 nm laser to a dose of 7 J.cm-2 (at 5 mW.cm-2 ). The mode of cell death was examined with flow cytometry using apoptosis/necrosis staining by Annexin V/propidium iodide, together with immunoblots of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL.
A431 cells had the highest EGFR density followed by OSC19, and then scc-U2 and scc-U8. The conjugates were localized both on the surface and in the cytosol of the cells after 1- and 24-hour incubation. After 24-hour incubation the granular pattern was more pronounced and in a similar pattern of a lysosomal probe, suggesting that the uptake of conjugates by cells was via receptor-mediated endocytosis. The results obtained from the quantitative imaging analysis correlate with the level of EGFR expression. Targeted PIT killed scc-U8 and A431 cells efficiently; while scc-U2 and OSC19 were less sensitive to this treatment, despite having similar EGFR density, uptake and localization pattern. Scc-U2 cells showed less apoptotic cell dealth than in A431 after 24-hour targeted PIT. Immunoblots showed significantly higher expression of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL proteins in scc-U2 cell lines compared to scc-U8.
Our study suggests that the effectiveness of EGFR targeted PIT is not only dependent upon EGFR density. Intrinsic biological properties of tumor cell lines also play a role in determining the efficacy of targeted PIT. We have shown that in scc-U2 cells this difference may be caused by differences in the apoptopic pathway. Lasers Surg. Med. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
The metabolites of vitamin D3 (VD3) mediated by different cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes, play fundamental roles in many physiological processes in relation to human health. These metabolites regulate a variety of cellular signal pathways through the direct binding of activated vitamin D receptor/retinoic X receptor (VDR/RXR) heterodimeric complex to specific DNA sequences. Thus, the polymorphisms of VDR and VD3 metabolizing enzymes lead to differentiated efficiency of VD3 and further affect serum VD3 levels. Moreover, VDR activation is demonstrated to inhibit the growth of various cancers, including colorectal cancer. However, excessive intake of vitamin D may lead to hypercalcemia, which limits the application of vitamin D tremendously. In this review, we have summarized the advances in VD3 research, especially the metabolism map of VD3 and the molecular mechanisms of inhibiting growth and inducing differentiation in colorectal cancer mediated by VDR-associated cellular signal pathways. The relationship between VDR polymorphism and the risk of colorectal cancer is also illustrated. In particular, novel pathways of the activation of VD3 started by CYP11A1 and CYP3A4 are highlighted, which produce several noncalcemic and antiproliferative metabolites. At last, the hypothesis is put forward that further research of CYP-mediated VD3 metabolites may develop therapeutic agents for colorectal cancer without resulting in hypercalcemia.
Rexinoids are powerful ligands that bind to retinoid-X-receptors (RXRs) and show great promise as therapeutics for a wide range of diseases, including cancer. However, only one rexinoid, bexarotene (Targretin TM) has been successfully transitioned from the bench to the clinic and used to treat cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL). Our goal is to develop novel potent rexinoids with a less untoward side effect profile than bexarotene. To this end, we have synthesized a wide array of rexinoids with EC50 values and biological activity similar to bexarotene. In order to determine their suitability for additional downstream analysis, and to identify potential candidate analogs for clinical translation, we treated human CTCL cells in culture and employed microarray technology to assess gene expression profiles. We analyzed twelve rexinoids and found they could be stratified into three distinct categories based on their gene expression: similar to bexarotene, moderately different from bexarotene, and substantially different from bexarotene. Surprisingly, small changes in the structure of the bexarotene parent compound led to marked differences in gene expression profiles. Furthermore, specific analogs diverged markedly from our hypothesis in expression of genes expected to be important for therapeutic promise. However, promoter analysis of genes whose expression was analyzed indicates general regulatory trends along structural frameworks. Our results suggest that certain structural motifs, particularly the basic frameworks found in analog 4 and analog 9, represent important starting points to exploit in generating additional rexinoids for future study and therapeutic applications.
The possible involvement of 13-cis retinoic acid (CRA) in the regulation of ovarian development in Oziotelphusa senex senex was investigated. Injection of CRA, into avitellogenic crabs significantly increased ovarian index, oocyte diameter and ovarian vitellogenin levels. Injection of CRA also resulted in a significant increase in the secretory rates of mandibular organs and Y-organs and circulatory levels of the methyl farnesoate and ecdysteroids. Further, administration of CRA into avitellogenic crabs produced higher amounts of Retinoid X Receptor, Ecdysteroid Receptor, E75 and vitellogenin mRNAs in the hepatopancreas. Mandibular organ and Y-organ explants isolated from avitellogenic crabs secreted more of methyl farnesoate and ecdysteroids respectively when incubated with CRA. Taken together, these observations led us to hypothesize that CRA stimulates ecdysteroidogenesis and methyl farnesoate synthesis, up-regulates EcR, RXR and E75 expression in hepatopancreas, which then induces vitellogenin gene expression. Vitellogenin is subsequently taken up from hemolymph by ovaries ensuing in ovarian maturation.
Retinoid X-receptors (RXRs) are members of the ligand-dependent transcription factor family of nuclear receptors that have gained recent research focus as potential targets for neurodegenerative disorders. Bexarotene is an RXR pharmacological agonist that is shown to be neuroprotective through its effects in promoting amyloid beta (Aβ) uptake by the glial cells in the brain. This study aimed to evaluate the dose-dependent effects of bexarotene on RXR expression in SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells and validate the drug effects in the brain in vivo. The protein expression studies were carried out using a combination of various drug treatment paradigms followed by expression analysis using Western blotting and immunofluorescence. Our study demonstrated that bexarotene promoted the expression of RXR α, β and γ isoforms at optimal concentrations in the cells and in the mice brain. Interestingly, a decreased RXR expression was identified in Alzheimer's disease mouse model and in the cells that were treated with Aβ. Bexarotene treatment not only rescued the RXR expression loss caused by Aβ treatment (p &lt; 0.05) but also protected the cells against Aβ-induced ER stress (p &lt; 0.05) and pro-apoptotic BAD protein activation (p &lt; 0.05). In contrast, higher concentrations of bexarotene upregulated the ER stress proteins and led to BAD activation. Our study revealed that these downstream neurotoxic effects of high drug concentrations could be prevented by pharmacological targeting of the TrkB receptor. The ER stress and BAD activation induced by high concentrations of bexarotene were rescued by the TrkB agonist, 7,8 dihydroxyflavone (p &lt; 0.05) while TrkB inhibitor CTX-B treatment further exacerbated these effects. Together, these findings suggest a cross-talk of TrkB signalling with downstream effects of bexarotene toxicity and indicate that therapeutic targeting of RXRs could prevent the Aβ-induced molecular neurotoxic effects.
Bisphenol A (BPA), perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), and tributyltin (TBT) are emerging endocrine disruptors (EDCs) with still poorly defined mechanisms of toxicity and metabolic effects in aquatic organisms. We used an untargeted liquid chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS) metabolomic approach to study the effects of sub-lethal doses of these three EDCs on the metabolic profiles of zebrafish embryos exposed from 48 to 120hpf (hours post fertilization). Advanced chemometric data analysis methods were used to reveal effects on the subjacent regulatory pathways. EDC treatments induced changes in concentrations of about 50 metabolites for TBT and BPA, and of 25 metabolites for PFOS. The analysis of the corresponding metabolic changes suggested the presence of similar underlying zebrafish responses to BPA, TBT and PFOS affecting the metabolism of glycerophospholipids, amino acids, purines and 2-oxocarboxylic acids. We related the changes in glycerophospholipid metabolism to alterations in absorption of the yolk sack, the main source of nutrients (including lipids) for the developing embryo, linking the molecular markers with adverse phenotypic effects. We propose a general mode of action for all three chemical compounds, probably related to their already described interaction with the PPAR/RXR complex, combined with specific effects on different signaling pathways resulting in particular alterations in the zebrafish embryos metabolism.
Retinoic acid is the active metabolite of vitamin A and regulates several important cellular processes by activating retinoic acid receptors (RAR) and retinoid X receptors (RXR). These receptors generally act as transcription factors, though non-genomic actions of both retinoic acid and the receptors have also been reported. One such nongenomic effect includes the modulation of Ca2+ levels during homeostatic synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus. Retinoic acid can thus affect Ca2+ signaling and can potentially control both synaptic plasticity and neuronal firing. However, whether retinoic acid can regulate voltage-gated Ca2+ channels (either via genomic or nongenomic actions), which are fundamental to these processes, has not yet been studied in detail. Here we demonstrate the effects of retinoic acid on the biophysical properties of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels in cultured invertebrate motorneurons. Overnight exposure to physiological concentrations of retinoic acid significantly inhibited the voltage-gated Ca2+ current (ICa) in an isomer-dependent manner. Specifically, all-trans retinoic acid (atRA), but not 9-cis RA (9cRA), depolarized the voltage of half-maximal activation of ICa. AtRA also reduced the rate of channel activation and delayed recovery from inactivation. We provide evidence that both L-type and non-L-type voltage-gated Ca2+ channels are affected by atRA, as both nifedipine-sensitive and nifedipine-resistant ICa were inhibited in these neurons. These effects of retinoic acid are thought to be at least partially mediated by the retinoid receptors, as treatment of the neurons with synthetic RAR and RXR agonists produced a similar inhibition of ICa.
The epithelium of the small intestine plays an important role in detoxification processes due to the presence of various xenobiotic-metabolizing enzymes from phase I and II, as well as transport proteins of the ATP-binding cassette superfamily. Exposure to xenobiotics induces the expression of these proteins in the small intestine, with multiple signaling pathways stimulated by exogenous compounds converging at individual gene promoters by mechanisms which have not been fully understood yet. In this context the promoter region of the CYP1A1 gene, encoding the phase I monooxygenase cytochrome P450 1A1, was analyzed by chromatin immunoprecipitation with regard to binding of xeno-sensing receptors following stimulation of Caco-2 cells with agonists of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) and retinoid receptors. Histone acetylation in the regulatory region of CYP1A1 was enhanced by treatment with 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) or all-trans retinoic acid (at-RA). Binding of retinoid-X-receptor (RXR) α to the promoter region was detected in response to at-RA, while AHR bound to the gene promoter following its activation by TCDD. Of note, enhanced RXRα binding was also detected after AHR stimulation, and increased AHR binding was observed after retinoid receptor activation by at-RA. Exposure of Caco-2 cells to mixtures of AHR and retinoid receptor agonists yielded synergistic induction of CYP1A1 mRNA. In conclusion, the present data improve our knowledge on retinoic acid-dependent effects on CYP1A1 expression and demonstrate unexpected mixture effects by cross-talk of the different receptors.
It is estimated that ~1% of the world's population has intellectual disability, with males affected more often than females. OGT is an X-linked gene encoding for the enzyme O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT), which carries out the reversible addition of N-Acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) to Ser/Thr residues of its intracellular substrates. Three missense mutations in the tetratricopeptide (TPR) repeats of OGT have recently been reported to cause X-linked Intellectual Disability (XLID). Here we report the discovery of two additional novel missense mutations (c. 775 G&gt;A, p. A259T and c. 1016 A&gt;G, p. E339G) in the TPR domain of OGT that segregate with XLID in affected families. Characterization of all five of these XLID missense variants of OGT demonstrates modest declines in thermodynamic stability and/or activities of the variants. We engineered each of the mutations into a male human embryonic stem cell line using CRISPR/Cas9. Investigation of the global O-GlcNAc profile as well as OGT and OGA levels by Western blotting showed no gross changes in steady-state levels in the engineered lines.  However, analyses of the differential transcriptomes of the OGT variant expressing stem cells revealed shared deregulation of genes involved in cell fate determination and LXR/RXR signaling, which has been implicated in neuronal development. Thus, here we reveal 2 additional mutations encoding residues in the TPR regions of OGT that appear causal for XLID and provide evidence that the relatively stable and active TPR variants may share a common, unelucidated, mechanism of altering gene expression profiles in human embryonic stem cells.
Appropriate thyroid hormone (TH) signaling through thyroid hormone receptors (TRs) is essential for vertebrate development. Amphibian metamorphosis is initiated and sustained through the action of TH on TRs which are conserved across vertebrates. TRs heterodimerize with retinoid-X receptors (RXRs) on thyroid hormone-response elements (TREs) in the genome, yet in most cell line and adult animal studies, RXR ligands do not affect expression of TR target genes. We used a quantitative, precocious metamorphosis assay to interrogate the effects of the RXR agonist bexarotene (Bex) and the RXR antagonist UVI 3003 (UVI) on T3-induced resorption phenotypes in Xenopus laevis tadpoles one-week post-fertilization. Bex potentiated gill and tail resorption, and UVI abrogated T3 action. These results held in transgenic tadpoles bearing a TRE-driven luciferase reporter. Therefore, we used Tag-Seq transcriptomic analysis to determine their effects on T3-induced gene expression. We also assayed the environmental pollutant tributyltin (TBT), which is an RXR agonist. We found that the proteases that carry out resorption were potentiated by Bex and TBT but not significantly inhibited by UVI. However, several transcription factors from multiple families (sox4, fosl2, mxd1, mafb, nfib) were both inhibited by UVI and potentiated by Bex and TBT. All required T3 for induction. Time course analysis of gene expression showed that while the agonists could potentiate within 12 hours, the antagonist response lagged. These data indicate that the agonists and antagonist are not necessarily functioning through the same mechanism, and suggest that RXR liganding may modulate TH competence in metamorphic signaling.
Epidemiological studies suggest that levels of n-3 and n-6 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids are associated with risk of cardio-metabolic outcomes across different ethnic groups. Recent genome-wide association studies in populations of European ancestry have identified several loci associated with plasma and/or erythrocyte polyunsaturated fatty acids. To identify additional novel loci, we carried out a genome-wide association study in two population-based cohorts consisting of 3521 Chinese participants, followed by a trans-ethnic meta-analysis with meta-analysis results from 8962 participants of European ancestry. Four novel loci (MYB, AGPAT4, DGAT2 and PPT2) reached genome-wide significance in the trans-ethnic meta-analysis (log10(Bayes Factor) ≥ 6). Of them, associations of MYB and AGPAT4 with docosatetraenoic acid (log10(Bayes Factor) = 11.5 and 8.69, respectively) also reached genome-wide significance in the Chinese-specific genome-wide association analyses (P = 4.15 × 10(-14) and 4.30 × 10(-12), respectively), while associations of DGAT2 with gamma-linolenic acid (log10(Bayes Factor) = 6.16) and of PPT2 with docosapentaenoic acid (log10(Bayes Factor) = 6.24) were nominally significant in both Chinese- and European-specific genome-wide association analyses (P ≤ 0.003). We also confirmed previously reported loci including FADS1, NTAN1, NRBF2, ELOVL2 and GCKR. Different effect sizes in FADS1 and independent association signals in ELOVL2 were observed. These results provide novel insight into the genetic background of polyunsaturated fatty acids and their differences between Chinese and European populations. 
Autophagy is an important lysosomal degradation pathway that aids in the maintenance of cellular homeostasis by breaking down and recycling intracellular contents. Dysregulation of autophagy is linked to a growing number of human diseases. The Beclin 1-Vps34 protein-protein interaction network is critical for autophagy regulation and is therefore essential to cellular integrity. Manipulation of autophagy, in particular via modulation of the action of the Beclin 1-Vps34 complexes, is considered a promising route to combat autophagy-related diseases. Here we summarize recent findings on the core components and structural architecture of the Beclin 1-Vps34 complexes, and how these findings provide valuable insights into the molecular mechanisms that underlie the multiple functions of these complexes and for devising therapeutic strategies.
High altitude environments are of particular interest in the studies of local adaptation as well as their implications in physiology and clinical medicine in human. Some Chinese pig breeds, such as Tibetan pig (TBP) that is well adapted to the high altitude and Dahe pig (DHP) that dwells at the moderate altitude, provide ideal materials to study local adaptation to altitudes. Yet, it is still short of in-depth analysis and understanding of the genetic adaptation to high altitude in the two pig populations. In this study we conducted a genomic scan for selective sweeps using FST to identify genes showing evidence of local adaptations in TBP and DHP, with Wuzhishan pig (WZSP) as the low-altitude reference. Totally, we identified 12 specific selective genes (CCBE1, F2RL1, AGGF1, ZFPM2, IL2, FGF5, PLA2G4A, ADAMTS9, NRBF2, JMJD1C, VEGFC and ADAM19) for TBP and six (OGG1, FOXM, FLT3, RTEL1, CRELD1 and RHOG) for DHP. In addition, six selective genes (VPS13A, GNA14, GDAP1, PARP8, FGF10 and ADAMTS16) were shared by the two pig breeds. Among these selective genes, three (VEGFC, FGF10 and ADAMTS9) were previously reported to be linked to the local adaptation to high altitudes in pigs, while many others were newly identified by this study. Further bioinformatics analysis demonstrated that majority of these selective signatures have some biological functions relevant to the altitude adaptation, for examples, response to hypoxia, development of blood vessels, DNA repair and several hematological involvements. These results suggest that the local adaptation to high altitude environments is sophisticated, involving numerous genes and multiple biological processes, and the shared selective signatures by the two pig breeds may provide an effective avenue to identify the common adaptive mechanisms to different altitudes. 
Autophagy is a tightly regulated lysosomal degradation pathway for maintaining cellular homeostasis and responding to stresses. Beclin 1 and its interacting proteins, including the class III phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase Vps34, play crucial roles in autophagy regulation in mammals. We identified nuclear receptor binding factor 2 (Nrbf2) as a Beclin 1-interacting protein from Becn1(-/-);Becn1-EGFP/+ mouse liver and brain. We also found that Nrbf2-Beclin 1 interaction required the N terminus of Nrbf2. We next used the human retinal pigment epithelial cell line RPE-1 as a model system and showed that transiently knocking down Nrbf2 by siRNA increased autophagic flux under both nutrient-rich and starvation conditions. To investigate the mechanism by which Nrbf2 regulates autophagy, we demonstrated that Nrbf2 interacted and colocalized with Atg14L, suggesting that Nrbf2 is a component of the Atg14L-containing Beclin 1-Vps34 complex. Moreover, ectopically expressed Nrbf2 formed cytosolic puncta that were positive for isolation membrane markers. These results suggest that Nrbf2 is involved in autophagosome biogenesis. Furthermore, we showed that Nrbf2 deficiency led to increased intracellular phosphatidylinositol-3 phosphate levels and diminished Atg14L-Vps34/Vps15 interactions, suggesting that Nrbf2-mediated Atg14L-Vps34/Vps15 interactions likely inhibit Vps34 activity. Therefore, we propose that Nrbf2 may interact with the Atg14L-containing Beclin 1-Vps34 protein complex to modulate protein-protein interactions within the complex, leading to suppression of Vps34 activity, autophagosome biogenesis, and autophagic flux. This work reveals a novel aspect of the intricate mechanism for the Beclin 1-Vps34 protein-protein interaction network to achieve precise control of autophagy. 
Genome-wide association studies have identified SNPs near ZNF365 at 10q21.2 that are associated with both breast cancer risk and mammographic density. To identify the most likely causal SNPs, we fine mapped the association signal by genotyping 428 SNPs across the region in 89,050 European and 12,893 Asian case and control subjects from the Breast Cancer Association Consortium. We identified four independent sets of correlated, highly trait-associated variants (iCHAVs), three of which were located within ZNF365. The most strongly risk-associated SNP, rs10995201 in iCHAV1, showed clear evidence of association with both estrogen receptor (ER)-positive (OR = 0.85 [0.82-0.88]) and ER-negative (OR = 0.87 [0.82-0.91]) disease, and was also the SNP most strongly associated with percent mammographic density. iCHAV2 (lead SNP, chr10: 64,258,684:D) and iCHAV3 (lead SNP, rs7922449) were also associated with ER-positive (OR = 0.93 [0.91-0.95] and OR = 1.06 [1.03-1.09]) and ER-negative (OR = 0.95 [0.91-0.98] and OR = 1.08 [1.04-1.13]) disease. There was weaker evidence for iCHAV4, located 5' of ADO, associated only with ER-positive breast cancer (OR = 0.93 [0.90-0.96]). We found 12, 17, 18, and 2 candidate causal SNPs for breast cancer in iCHAVs 1-4, respectively. Chromosome conformation capture analysis showed that iCHAV2 interacts with the ZNF365 and NRBF2 (more than 600 kb away) promoters in normal and cancerous breast epithelial cells. Luciferase assays did not identify SNPs that affect transactivation of ZNF365, but identified a protective haplotype in iCHAV2, associated with silencing of the NRBF2 promoter, implicating this gene in the etiology of breast cancer. 
NRBF2/Atg38 has been identified as the fifth subunit of the macroautophagic/autophagic class III phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PtdIns3K) complex, along with ATG14/Barkor, BECN1/Vps30, PIK3R4/p150/Vps15 and PIK3C3/Vps34. However, its functional mechanism and regulation are not fully understood. Here, we report that NRBF2 is a fine tuning regulator of PtdIns3K controlled by phosphorylation. Human NRBF2 is phosphorylated by MTORC1 at S113 and S120. Upon nutrient starvation or MTORC1 inhibition, NRBF2 phosphorylation is diminished. Phosphorylated NRBF2 preferentially interacts with PIK3C3/PIK3R4. Suppression of NRBF2 phosphorylation by MTORC1 inhibition alters its binding preference from PIK3C3/PIK3R4 to ATG14/BECN1, leading to increased autophagic PtdIns3K complex assembly, as well as enhancement of ULK1 protein complex association. Consequently, NRBF2 in its unphosphorylated form promotes PtdIns3K lipid kinase activity and autophagy flux, whereas its phosphorylated form blocks them. This study reveals NRBF2 as a critical molecular switch of PtdIns3K and autophagy activation, and its on/off state is precisely controlled by MTORC1 through phosphorylation.
The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase Vps34 is part of several protein complexes. The structural organization of heterotetrameric complexes is starting to emerge, but little is known about organization of additional accessory subunits that interact with these assemblies. Combining hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS), X-ray crystallography and electron microscopy (EM), we have characterized Atg38 and its human ortholog NRBF2, accessory components of complex I consisting of Vps15-Vps34-Vps30/Atg6-Atg14 (yeast) and PIK3R4/VPS15-PIK3C3/VPS34-BECN1/Beclin 1-ATG14 (human). HDX-MS shows that Atg38 binds the Vps30-Atg14 subcomplex of complex I, using mainly its N-terminal MIT domain and bridges the coiled-coil I regions of Atg14 and Vps30 in the base of complex I. The Atg38 C-terminal domain is important for localization to the phagophore assembly site (PAS) and homodimerization. Our 2.2 Å resolution crystal structure of the Atg38 C-terminal homodimerization domain shows 2 segments of α-helices assembling into a mushroom-like asymmetric homodimer with a 4-helix cap and a parallel coiled-coil stalk. One Atg38 homodimer engages a single complex I. This is in sharp contrast to human NRBF2, which also forms a homodimer, but this homodimer can bridge 2 complex I assemblies.
Multi-subunit tethering complexes control membrane fusion events in eukaryotic cells. CORVET and HOPS are two such complexes, both containing the Sec1/Munc18 protein subunit VPS33A. Metazoans additionally possess VPS33B, which has considerable sequence similarity to VPS33A but does not integrate into CORVET or HOPS complexes and instead stably interacts with VIPAR. It has been recently suggested that VPS33B and VIPAR comprise two subunits of a novel multi-subunit tethering complex (named "CHEVI"), perhaps analogous in configuration to CORVET and HOPS. We utilised the BioID proximity biotinylation assay to compare and contrast the interactomes of VPS33A and VPS33B. Overall, few proteins were identified as associating with both VPS33A and VPS33B, suggesting these proteins have distinct sub-cellular localisations. Consistent with previous reports, we observed that VPS33A was co-localised with many components of class III phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3KC3) complexes: PIK3C3, PIK3R4, NRBF2, UVRAG and RUBICON. Although VPS33A clearly co-localised with several subunits of CORVET and HOPS in this assay, no proteins with the canonical CORVET/HOPS domain architecture were found to co-localise with VPS33B. Instead, we identified that VPS33B interacts directly with CCDC22, a member of the CCC complex. CCDC22 does not co-fractionate with VPS33B and VIPAR in gel filtration of human cell lysates, suggesting that CCDC22 interacts transiently with VPS33B/VIPAR rather than forming a stable complex with these proteins in cells. We also observed that the protein complex containing VPS33B and VIPAR is considerably smaller than CORVET/HOPS, suggesting that the CHEVI complex comprises just VPS33B and VIPAR.
Allergic rhinitis is a common chronic disorder characterized by immunoglobulin E-mediated inflammation. To identify new genes associated with this trait, we performed genome- and epigenome-wide association studies and linked marginally significant CpGs located in genes or its promoter and SNPs located 1 Mb from the CpGs, by identifying cis methylation quantitative trait loci (mQTL). This approach relies on functional cellular aspects rather than stringent statistical correction. We were able to identify one gene with significant cis-mQTL for allergic rhinitis, caudal-type homeobox 1 (CDX1). We also identified 11 genes with marginally significant cis-mQTLs (p &lt; 0.05) including one with both allergic rhinitis with or without asthma (RNF39). Moreover, most SNPs identified were not located closest to the gene they were linked to through cis-mQTLs counting the one linked to CDX1 located in a gene previously associated with asthma and atopic dermatitis. By combining omics data, we were able to identify new genes associated with allergic rhinitis and better assess the genes linked to associated SNPs.
Long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) is an important member of non-coding RNA family and emerging evidence has indicated that it plays a pivotal role in many physiological and pathological processes. The lncRNA X inactive specific transcript (XIST) is a potential tumour suppressor in some types of cancers. However, the expression and function of XIST in breast cancer remain largely unclear. The objective of this study was to evaluate the expression and biological role of XIST in breast cancer. The results showed that XIST was significantly down-regulated in breast cancer tissues and cell lines. Further functional analysis indicated that overexpression of XIST remarkably inhibited breast cancer cell growth, migration, and invasion. The results of luciferase reporter assays verified that miR-155 was a direct target of XIST in breast cancer. Moreover, caudal-type homeobox 1 (CDX1) was identified as a direct target of miR-155 and miR-155/CDX1 rescued the effects of XIST in breast cancer cells. Taken together, our results suggest that XIST is down-regulated in breast cancer and suppresses breast cancer cell growth, migration, and invasion via the miR-155/CDX1 axis.
A transgene constructed from the rat liver fatty acid binding protein gene (Fabp1) promoter is active in all murine small intestinal crypt and villus epithelial cells. Coincident Cdx and C/EBP transcription factor binding sites were identified spanning Fabp1 nucleotides -90 to -78. CDX-1, CDX-2, C/EBPalpha, and C/EBPbeta activated the Fabp1 transgene in CaCo-2 cells, and mutagenizing the -78 site prevented activation by these factors. CDX but not C/EBP factors bound to the site in vitro, although C/EBP factors competed with CDX factors for transgene activation. The -78 site adjoins an HNF-1 site, and CDX and C/EBP family factors cooperated with HNF-1alpha but not HNF-1beta to activate the transgene. Furthermore, CDX-1, CDX-2, C/EBPalpha, and C/EBPbeta bound to HNF-1alpha and HNF-1beta. The transgene with a mutagenized -78 site was silenced in vivo specifically in small intestinal crypt epithelial cells but remained active in villus cells. These results demonstrate functional interactions between HNF-1, C/EBP, and CDX family factors and suggest that these interactions may contribute to differential transcriptional regulation in the small intestinal crypt and villus compartments.
The vertebrate caudal proteins, being upstream regulators of the Hox genes, play a role in establishment of the body plan. We describe analysis of two orthologous caudal genes (chick cdx-A and mouse cdx-1) by use of lacZ reporters expressed in transgenic mouse embryos. The expression patterns show many similarities to the expression of endogenous mouse cdx-1. At 8.7 days, cdx/lacZ activity within neurectoderm and mesoderm forms posterior-to-anterior gradients, and we discuss the possibility that similar gradients of cdx gene expression may function as morphogen gradients for the establishment of Hox gene expression boundaries. Our observations suggest that gradients form by decay of cdx/lacZ activity in cells that have moved anterior to the vicinity of the node. The cdx-A/lacZ expression pattern requires an intron enhancer that includes two functional control elements: a DR2-type retinoic acid response element and a Tcf/beta-catenin binding motif. These motifs are structurally conserved in mouse cdx-1.
To investigate the effect of bile acid on the expression of histidine decarboxylase (HDC), which is a major enzyme involved in histamine production, and gene expression of gastric transcription factors upon cooperative activation.
HDC expression was examined by immunohistochemistry, reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, and promoter assay in human gastric precancerous tissues, normal stomach tissue, and gastric cancer cell lines. The relationship between gastric precancerous state and HDC expression induced by bile acid was determined. The association between the expression of HDC and various specific transcription factors in gastric cells was also evaluated. MKN45 and AGS human gastric carcinoma cell lines were transfected with farnesoid X receptor (FXR), small heterodimer partner (SHP), and caudal-type homeodomain transcription factor (CDX)1 expression plasmids. The effects of various transcription factors on HDC expression were monitored by luciferase-reporter promoter assay.
Histamine production and secretion in the stomach play critical roles in gastric acid secretion and in the pathogenesis of gastric diseases. Here, we show that bile acid increased the expression of HDC, which is a rate-limiting enzyme of the histamine production pathway. FXR was found to be a primary regulatory transcription factor for bile acid-induced HDC expression. In addition, the transcription factors CDX1 and SHP synergistically enhanced bile acid-induced elevation of HDC gene expression. We confirmed similar expression patterns for HDC, CDX1, and SHP in patient tissues.
HDC production in the stomach is associated with bile acid exposure and its related transcriptional regulation network of FXR, SHP, and CDX1.
Colorectal cancers (CRCs) are classified as having microsatellite instability (MSI) or chromosomal instability (CIN); herein termed microsatellite stable (MSS). MSI colon cancers frequently display a poorly differentiated histology for which the molecular basis is not well understood. Gene expression and immunohistochemical profiling of MSS and MSI CRC cell lines and tumors revealed significant down-regulation of the intestinal-specific cytoskeletal protein villin in MSI colon cancer, with complete absence in 62% and 17% of MSI cell lines and tumors, respectively. Investigation of 577 CRCs linked loss of villin expression to poorly differentiated histology in MSI and MSS tumors. Furthermore, mislocalization of villin from the membrane was prognostic for poorer outcome in MSS patients. Loss of villin expression was not due to coding sequence mutations, epigenetic inactivation, or promoter mutation. Conversely, in transient transfection assays villin promoter activity reflected endogenous villin expression, suggesting transcriptional control. A screen of gut-specific transcription factors revealed a significant correlation between expression of villin and the homeobox transcription factor Cdx-1. Cdx-1 overexpression induced villin promoter activity, Cdx-1 knockdown down-regulated endogenous villin expression, and deletion of a key Cdx-binding site within the villin promoter attenuated promoter activity. Loss of Cdx-1 expression in CRC lines was associated with Cdx-1 promoter methylation. These findings demonstrate that loss of villin expression due to Cdx-1 loss is a feature of poorly differentiated CRCs.
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play important roles in the tumorigenesis of glioma. Recent studies showed that miR-155 expression was increased in types of cancer, including glioma. However, the underlying mechanism of miR-155 on glioma is still unclear. In the present study, expression of miR-155 and caudal-type homeobox 1 (CDX1) was determined in glioma tissues by qRT-PCR, and the regulatory axis was further studied in glioma cells. We showed that miR-155 expression was significantly increased in glioma tissues while CDX1 expression was decreased. Correlation analysis revealed that miR-155 was negatively correlated with CDX1 expression in glioma tissues. Moreover, Kaplan-Meier analysis indicated that patients with high miR-155 expression had a poor overall survival. In addition, our results showed that the translation of CDX1 expression could be suppressed by miR-155 mimics. And miR-155 mimics promoted glioma cell proliferation could be reversed by CDX1 overexpression. In vivo assay, we showed that miR-155 overexpression promoted the progress of tumor formation. Therefore, we suggested that miR-155 might promote glioma cell growth partially by targeting CDX1, which provided a novel therapeutic strategy for glioma patients.
Developing anatomy along the head-tail axis of bilaterian embryos is specified, to a large extent, by the overlapping patterns of expression of the Hox genes. Hox gene enhancers respond to a variety of signals in order to regulate these discreet domains of expression. For mouse Hoxc8, the 399bp "early enhancer" plays a major role. Activation of this enhancer is now examined using luciferase expression constructs transfected into HepG2 cells. Constructs are activated by the combined actions of Gdf11/Smad and Cdx protein signalling pathways, both of which are functional in early embryos. Each of these pathways alone has little stimulatory effect. Stimulation by the two pathways together exceeds the sum of the effects of each pathway alone, indicating synergistic activity. By mutation analysis, two Smad binding motifs are identified as mediators of the Gdf11 effect and two Cdx binding motifs mediate the Cdx effect. The two Smad motifs and one of the Cdx sites are conserved from fish to mammals. Gdf11 stimulation is partially inhibited by Specific Inhibitor of Smad3, suggesting that Smad3 plays a part in signal transduction. Fgf2 increases luciferase activation by the Hoxc8 enhancer, but not, apparently, by specific interactions with either Gdf11 or Cdx effects.
Gene expression microarrays have identified many tumor markers and therapeutic targets for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). However, microarray profilings have limited sensitivity and are prone to cross-hybridization between homologous DNA fragments. Here, we perform a transcriptome analysis of paired tumor and adjacent benign pancreatic tissues from 10 patients who underwent resection for PDAC. We identify a total of 2736 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) with false discovery rate less than 0.05, including 1554 upregulated, 1182 downregulated, and 6 microRNAs (miR-614, miR-217, miR-27b, miR-4451, miR-3609, and miR-612). Overexpression of five DEGs, i.e. KRT16, HOXA10, CDX1, SI, and SERPINB5 in tumors is confirmed by RT-PCR in 20 additional tissues. Overexpression of KRT16 in PDAC is also verified on protein level. In addition, top canonical pathways such as granulocyte adhesion and diapedesis pathway have been identified. Our study represents a comprehensive characterization of the PDAC transcriptome and provides insight to the mechanisms of pancreatic carcinogenesis and potential biomarkers and novel therapeutic targets for pancreatic cancer.
Hypermethylation of CpG islands in the promoter region of tumor suppressor genes (TSGs) and their subsequent silencing is thought to be one of the main mechanisms of carcinogenesis. MBD2b enrichment coupled with a NimbleGen array was applied to examine the genome-wide CpG island methylation profile of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Hypermethylated DNA of 58 pairs of HCC and adjacent tissue samples was enriched and hybridized in the same array. Aberrant hypermethylated peaks of HCC and adjacent tissues were screened and annotated after data processing using NimbleScan2.5 and our newly developed Weighting and Scoring (WAS) method, respectively. Validation using bisulfite sequencing of randomly selected ANKRD45, APC, CDX1, HOXD3, PTGER and TUBB6 genes demonstrated significant hypermethylation modification in HCC samples, consistent with the array data.
Gastric cancer is a world health problem and depicts the fourth leading mortality cause from malignancy in Mexico. Causation of gastric cancer is not only due to the combined effects of environmental factors and genetic variants. Recent molecular studies have transgressed a number of genes involved in gastric carcinogenesis. The aim of this review is to understand the recent basics of gene expression in the development of the process of gastric carcinogenesis. Genetic variants, polymorphisms, desoxyribonucleic acid methylation, and genes involved in mediating inflammation have been associated with the development of gastric carcinogenesis. Recently, these genes (interleukin 10, Il-17, mucin 1, β-catenin, CDX1, SMAD4, SERPINE1, hypoxia-inducible factor 1 subunit alpha, GSK3β, CDH17, matrix metalloproteinase 7, RUNX3, RASSF1A, TFF1, HAI-2, and COX-2) have been studied in association with oncogenic activation or inactivation of tumor suppressor genes. All these mechanisms have been investigated to elucidate the process of gastric carcinogenesis, as well as their potential use as biomarkers and/or molecular targets to treatment of disease.
The NanoString nCounter assay is a high-throughput hybridization technique using target-specific probes that can be customized to test for numerous fusion transcripts in a single assay using RNA from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded material. We designed a NanoString assay targeting 174 unique fusion junctions in 25 sarcoma types. The study cohort comprised 212 cases, 96 of which showed fusion gene expression by the NanoString assay, including all 20 Ewing sarcomas, 11 synovial sarcomas, and 5 myxoid liposarcomas tested. Among these 96 cases, 15 showed fusion expression not identified by standard clinical assay, including EWSR1-FLI1, EWSR1-ERG, BCOR-CCNB3, ZC3H7B-BCOR, HEY1-NCOA2, CIC-DUX4, COL1A1-PDGFB, MYH9-USP6, YAP1-TFE3, and IRF2BP2-CDX1 fusions. There were no false-positive results; however, four cases were false negative when compared with clinically available fluorescence in situ hybridization or RT-PCR testing. When batched as six cases, the per-sample reagent cost was less than conventional techniques, such as fluorescence in situ hybridization, with technologist hands-on time of 1.2 hours per case and assay time of 36 hours. In summary, the NanoString nCounter Sarcoma Fusion CodeSet reliably and cost-effectively identifies fusion genes in sarcomas using formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded material, including many fusions missed by standard clinical assays, and can serve as a first-line clinical diagnostic test for sarcoma fusion gene identification, replacing multiple individual clinical assays.
Anorectal malformation (ARM) is a common congenital anomaly with a wide clinical spectrum. Recently, many genetic and molecular studies have been conducted worldwide highlighting the contribution of genetic factors in its etiology. We summarize the current literature on such genetic factors.
Literature search was done using different combinations of terms related to genetics in anorectal malformations. From 2012 to June 2017, articles published in the English literature and studies conducted on human population were included.
A paradigm shift was observed from the earlier studies concentrating on genetic aberrations in specific pathways to genome wide arrays exploring single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and copy number variations (CNVs) in ARM patients. Rare CNVs (including 79 genes) and SNPs have been found to genetically contribute to ARM. Out of disrupted 79 genes one such putative gene is DKK4. Down regulation of CDX-1 gene has also been implicated in isolated ARM patients. In syndromic ARM de novo microdeletion at 17q12 and a few others have been identified.
Major genetic aberrations proposed in the pathogenesis of ARM affect members of the Wnt, Hox (homebox) genes, Sonic hedgehog (Shh) and Gli2, Bmp4, Fgf and CDX1 signalling pathways; probable targets of future molecular gene therapy.
Mesenchymal chondrosarcoma is a rare but deadly form of chondrosarcoma that typically affects adolescents and young adults. While curative intent is possible for patients with localized disease, few options exist for patients in the unresectable/metastatic setting. Thus, it is imperative to understand the fusion-driven biology of this rare malignant neoplasm so as to lead to the future development of better therapeutics for this disease. This manuscript will briefly review the clinical and pathologic features of mesenchymal chondrosarcoma followed by an appraisal of existing data linked to the fusions, HEY1-NCOA2 and IRF2BP2-CDX1, and the associated downstream pathways.
Adjuvant chemotherapy after surgery improves survival of patients with stage II-III, resectable gastric cancer. However, the overall survival benefit observed after adjuvant chemotherapy is moderate, suggesting that not all patients with resectable gastric cancer treated with adjuvant chemotherapy benefit from it. We aimed to develop and validate a predictive test for adjuvant chemotherapy response in patients with resectable, stage II-III gastric cancer.
In this multi-cohort, retrospective study, we developed through a multi-step strategy a predictive test consisting of two rule-based classifier algorithms with predictive value for adjuvant chemotherapy response and prognosis. Exploratory bioinformatics analyses identified biologically relevant candidate genes in gastric cancer transcriptome datasets. In the discovery analysis, a four-gene, real-time RT-PCR assay was developed and analytically validated in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumour tissues from an internal cohort of 307 patients with stage II-III gastric cancer treated at the Yonsei Cancer Center with D2 gastrectomy plus adjuvant fluorouracil-based chemotherapy (n=193) or surgery alone (n=114). The same internal cohort was used to evaluate the prognostic and chemotherapy response predictive value of the single patient classifier genes using associations with 5-year overall survival. The results were validated with a subset (n=625) of FFPE tumour samples from an independent cohort of patients treated in the CLASSIC trial (NCT00411229), who received D2 gastrectomy plus capecitabine and oxaliplatin chemotherapy (n=323) or surgery alone (n=302). The primary endpoint was 5-year overall survival.
We identified four classifier genes related to relevant gastric cancer features (GZMB, WARS, SFRP4, and CDX1) that formed the single patient classifier assay. In the validation cohort, the prognostic single patient classifier (based on the expression of GZMB, WARS, and SFRP4) identified 79 (13%) of 625 patients as low risk, 296 (47%) as intermediate risk, and 250 (40%) as high risk, and 5-year overall survival for these groups was 83·2% (95% CI 75·2-92·0), 74·8% (69·9-80·1), and 66·0% (60·1-72·4), respectively (p=0·012). The predictive single patient classifier (based on the expression of GZMB, WARS, and CDX1) assigned 281 (45%) of 625 patients in the validation cohort to the chemotherapy-benefit group and 344 (55%) to the no-benefit group. In the predicted chemotherapy-benefit group, 5-year overall survival was significantly improved in those patients who had received adjuvant chemotherapy after surgery compared with those who received surgery only (80% [95% CI 73·5-87·1] vs 64·5% [56·8-73·3]; univariate hazard ratio 0·47 [95% CI 0·30-0·75], p=0·0015), whereas no such improvement in 5-year overall survival was observed in the no-benefit group (72·9% [66·5-79·9] in patients who received chemotherapy plus surgery vs 72·5% [65·8-79·9] in patients who only had surgery; 0·93 [0·62-1·38], p=0·71). The predictive single patient classifier groups (chemotherapy benefit vs no-benefit) could predict adjuvant chemotherapy benefit in terms of 5-year overall survival in the validation cohort (pinteraction=0·036 in univariate analysis). Similar results were obtained in the internal evaluation cohort.
The single patient classifiers validated in this study provide clinically important prognostic information independent of standard risk-stratification methods and predicted chemotherapy response after surgery in two independent cohorts of patients with resectable, stage II-III gastric cancer. The single patient classifiers could complement TNM staging to optimise decision making in patients with resectable gastric cancer who are eligible for adjuvant chemotherapy after surgery. Further validation of these results in prospective studies is warranted.

The human interferon alpha-receptor (IFNAR gene product) is a transmembranal protein of 557 amino acids with an intracytoplasmic domain of 100 amino acids containing four tyrosines. Antibodies to a C-terminal peptide (residues 521-536) were developed which efficiently immunoprecipitate the 105 kDa IFNAR protein from detergent extracts of human cells. We show that the IFNAR protein becomes tyrosine phosphorylated within 5 min after treatment of human myeloma U266 cells with IFN-alpha 2, IFN-alpha 8 or IFN-beta. The IFNAR chain interacts with both IFN-alpha 2 and IFN-beta, as demonstrated by cross-linking. Among elements involved in signal transduction by type I IFNs, the tyrosine kinase Tyk2 but not Jak1, and the ISGF3 transcription factor subunit Stat2 (p113) but not Stat1 (p91), are found associated with the IFNAR protein. After IFN-beta treatment for 5 min, a tyrosine-phosphorylated protein of approximately 95 kDa (beta-PTyr) is found bound to IFNAR, but can be dissociated by denaturation. The beta-PTyr protein is present on the cell surface, like IFNAR, as shown by extracellular biotin tagging. The ratio of beta-PTyr to IFNAR tyrosine phosphorylation is much higher with IFN-beta than with IFN-alpha 2 or 8. Both are IFN dependent and abrogated by a monoclonal antibody which blocks IFNAR action. The beta-PTyr component may represent an important difference in the action of IFN-beta as compared with IFN-alpha in their shared receptor system.
The ubiquitin-like protein interferon-stimulated gene, 15 kDa (ISG15) plays an ambiguous role in the progression and response to chemotherapy of solid cancers. We aimed to investigate the prognostic impact of ISG15 and its link to the nuclear factor κB pathway in ovarian high-grade serous carcinoma. Immunohistochemistry was performed in a cohort of 128 primary ovarian high-grade serous carcinomas treated with standard surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy using tissue microarrays. In addition, 28 matched relapsed carcinomas were investigated. ISG15 protein expression was significantly increased in relapsed carcinomas as compared to primary tumors (P=0.027). In primary carcinoma, ISG15 was positively associated with total inhibitor of κB α (IκBα) (P=0.001) as well as nuclear and cytoplasmic phospho-IκBα (p-IκBα) expression (P=0.039 and P=0.002, respectively). Patients with ISG15-positive carcinomas had a significantly longer overall survival in univariate analysis (P=0.002), and in multivariate analysis [hazard ratio=0.35 (95% confidence interval, 0.14-0.84, P=0.019)]. ISG15 is a potential prognostic marker in high-grade serous carcinoma of the ovary. Its impact on survival might be explained by its tight link to the nuclear factor κB pathway, and the further evaluation of the interplay between ISGylation machinery and nuclear factor κB, particularly with regard to response to chemotherapy, would be desirable. 
Cardiovascular complications are the most common causes of morbidity and mortality in acromegaly. However, there is little data regarding cardiac autonomic functions in these patients. Herein, we aimed to investigate several parameters of cardiac autonomic functions in patients with acromegaly compared to healthy subjects. We enrolled 20 newly diagnosed acromegalic patients (55% female, age:45.7 ± 12.6 years) and 32 age- and gender-matched healthy subjects. All participants underwent 24 h Holter recording. Heart rate recovery (HRR) indices were calculated by subtracting 1st, 2nd and 3rd minute heart rates from maximal heart rate. All patients underwent heart rate variability (HRV) and QT dynamicity analysis. Baseline characteristics were similar except diabetes mellitus and hypertension among groups. Mean HRR1 (29.2 ± 12.3 vs 42.6 ± 6.5, p = 0.001), HRR2 (43.5 ± 15.6 vs 61.1 ± 10.8, p = 0.001) and HRR3 (46.4 ± 16.2 vs 65.8 ± 9.8, p = 0.001) values were significantly higher in control group. HRV parameters as, SDNN [standard deviation of all NN intervals] (p = 0.001), SDANN [SD of the 5 min mean RR intervals] (p = 0.001), RMSSD [root square of successive differences in RR interval] (p = 0.001), PNN50 [proportion of differences in successive NN intervals &gt;50 ms] (p = 0.001) and high-frequency [HF] (p = 0.001) were significantly decreased in patients with acromegaly; but low frequency [LF] (p = 0.046) and LF/HF (p = 0.001) were significantly higher in acromegaly patients. QTec (p = 0.009), QTac/RR slope (p = 0.017) and QTec/RR slope (p = 0.01) were significantly higher in patients with acromegaly. Additionally, there were significant negative correlation of disease duration with HRR2, HRR3, SDNN, PNN50, RMSSD, variability index. Our study results suggest that cardiac autonomic functions are impaired in patients with acromegaly. Further large scale studies are needed to exhibit the prognostic significance of impaired autonomic functions in patients with acromegaly.
A large body of evidence exists indicating that autonomic imbalance is characteristic of heart failure, with several parameters of autonomic function associated with adverse clinical outcomes. The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to investigate the effects of exercise training on parameters of autonomic function in patients with heart failure and where possible quantify the size of the effect. We conducted database searches (PubMed, EMBASE and Cochrane Trials Register to 31 March 2017) for exercise-based rehabilitation trials in heart failure; using search terms, exercise training, autonomic function, heart rate recovery, heart rate variability and muscle sympathetic nerve activity. Pooled data indicated a statistically significant increase in heart rate recovery at 1 min (HRR1) in exercise compared to control groups, mean difference 5.90 bpm (95%CI 5.12, 6.69; p &lt; 0.00001). Pooled data also indicated that exercise training improved the short-term heart rate variability (HRV) parameters of root mean square of successive differences between normal heart beats (RMSSD (ms)) [mean difference 10.44 (95%CI 0.60, 20.28, p = 0.04)] and high-frequency normalised units (HFnu) [mean difference 7.72 (95%CI 3.32, 12.12, p = 0.0006), which are predominantly reflective of parasympathetic activity. Analyses also indicated a statistically significant decrease in muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA) bursts/minute (mean difference - 11.09 (95%CI - 16.18, - 6.00; p &lt; 0.0001) and MSNA bursts/100 heart beats (mean difference - 15.44 (95%CI - 20.95, -9.92; p &lt; 0.00001) in exercise groups compared to controls. With improvements in HRR, HRV and MSNA, exercise training appears to facilitate an improvement in parasympathetic tone and reduction in sympathetic activity.
Despite a growing clinical interest in determining the heart rate recovery (HRR) response to exercise, the limits of a normal HRR have not yet been well established.
This study was designed to examine HRR following a controlled maximal exercise test in healthy, physically active adult men.
The subjects recruited (n = 789) performed a maximal stress test on a treadmill. HRR indices were calculated by subtracting the first and third minute heart rates (HRs) during recovery from the maximal HR obtained during stress testing and designated these as HRR-1 and HRR-3, respectively. The relative change in HRR was determined as the decrease in HR produced at the time points 1 and 3 min after exercise as a percentage of the peak HR (%HRR-1/HR(peak) and %HRR-3/HR(peak), respectively). Percentile values of HRR-1 and HRR-3 were generated for the study population.
Mean HHR-1 and HHR-3 were 15.24 ± 8.36 and 64.58 ± 12.17 bpm, respectively, and %HRR-1/HR(peak) and %HRR-3/HR(peak) were 8.60 ± 4.70 and 36.35 ± 6.79%, respectively. Significant correlation was detected between Peak VO2 and HRR-3 (r = 0.36; p &lt; 0.001) or %HRR-3/HR(peak) (r = 0.23; p &lt; 0.001).
Our study provides normality data for HRR following a maximal Ergometry test obtained in a large population of physically active men.
Some studies have reported that p53 mutations or certain types of p53 mutation are associated with poor prognosis in colon cancer, while other studies have failed to show such a relationship. None of these previous studies was population-based. We therefore evaluated the prognostic significance of p53 mutations in a large, population-based study of 1,464 individuals with colon cancer from Utah and California. Mutations in exons 5-8 were detected by SSCP analysis, followed by sequencing of aberrant bands. p53 mutations were identified in colon cancers from 665 of 1,464 (45.4%) individuals. p53 mutations were significantly more common in distal tumors (p &lt; 0.01), tumors of relatively high stage (p = 0.04), tumors without MSI (p &lt; 0.01) and tumors without Ki-ras mutations (p &lt; 0.01). In a univariate analysis, tumors with p53 mutations were associated with a significantly worse 5-year survival than those with wild-type p53 (53.4% vs. 58.8%, p = 0.04); significantly worse prognosis also was seen with missense mutations, transitions, transversions, mutations affecting the structure of the p53 molecule, mutations within the beta-sandwich motif and mutations in proximal tumors. In multivariate analyses, however, the only significant predictors of poor prognosis were G245 hot spot mutations (HRR = 2.16, 95% CI 1.06-4.40) and p53 mutations in proximal tumors (HRR = 1.34, 95% CI 1.07-1.63). We conclude that overall p53 mutational status is not an independent predictor of poor prognosis in colon cancer. However, specific classes of mutations, namely, the G245 hot spot mutation and mutations in proximal tumors, are related to significantly worse survival even after adjusting for age and stage.
A hallmark feature of atherosclerosis is inflammation mediated by prostaglandins (PGs) catalyzed by the enzyme cyclooxygenase (COX). The present study explored whether the COX-2 G-765C polymorphism contributes to increased incidence of coronary heart disease (CHD) or stroke in the large prospective Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) Study.
Incidences of CHD and stroke were identified through annual follow-up and hospital and death certificate surveillance. The study included 1488 incident CHD and 527 stroke events after an average of 14 years of follow-up. The frequency of the -765C variant allele was markedly different between African-Americans and whites, therefore all analyses were performed separately by race. Due to the small number of persons with the -765CC genotype, heterozygous and homozygous variant genotypes were combined for this analysis.
The COX-2 G-765C polymorphism was not a significant predictor of CHD in either racial group, but it was a significant predictor of incident stroke in African-Americans. After adjustment for age and gender, the hazard rate ratio for developing stroke for the CG+CC genotypes relative to the GG genotype was 1.34 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.03-1.74, P=0.03) in African-Americans. This result was essentially unchanged when established predictors such as smoking, diabetes and hypertension were added to the model (HRR 1.34, 95%CI 1.03-1.76, P=0.03).
We have found the COX-2 G-765C polymorphism to be a risk factor for incident stroke in African-Americans. This study provides additional evidence for utilizing inflammation-related genetic polymorphisms for identifying individuals at increased risk for stroke.
Globally, the majority of childhood deaths in the post-neonatal period are caused by infections that can be effectively treated or prevented with inexpensive interventions delivered through even very basic health facilities. To understand the role of inadequate health systems on childhood mortality in Kenya, we assemble a large, retrospective cohort of children (born 1996-2013) and describe the health systems context of each child using health facility survey data representative of the province at the time of a child's birth. We examine the relationship between survival beyond 59 months of age and geographic distribution of health facilities, quality of services, and cost of services. We find significant geographic heterogeneity in survival that can be partially explained by differences in distribution of health facilities and user fees. Higher per capita density of health facilities resulted in a 25% reduction in the risk of death (HRR = 0.73, 95% CI:0.58 to 0.91) and accounted for 30% of the between-province heterogeneity in survival. User fees for sick-child visits increased risk by 30% (HRR = 1.30, 95% CI:1.11 to 1.53). These results implicate health systems constraints in child mortality, quantify the contribution of specific domains of health services, and suggest priority areas for improvement to accelerate reductions in child mortality.
This population-based cohort study investigated the association between a lifetime history of a work-related low back injury, in those who had recovered to have no or mild low back pain, and the development of troublesome low back pain (LBP). A secondary analysis explored the possible effects of misclassification of the exposure by examining the association between a lifetime history of having taken time off work or performed light duties at work because of a work-related low back injury. Current evidence from cross-sectional studies suggests that individuals with a history of a work-related low back injury are more likely to experience future LBP. However, there is a need to examine this association prospectively in a large population-based cohort with adequate control of known confounders.
We formed a cohort of 810 randomly sampled Saskatchewan adults with no or mild LBP in September 1995. At baseline, participants were asked if they had ever injured their low back at work. The secondary analysis asked if they had ever had to take time off work or perform light duties at work because of a work-related low back injury. Prospective follow-up 6 and 12 months later, asked about the presence of troublesome LBP (grade II-IV) on the Chronic Pain Grade Questionnaire. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression analysis was used to estimate these associations while controlling for known confounders.
The proportion followed up at 6 and 12 months was 76 and 65%, respectively. We found an association between a history of work-related low back injury and the onset of troublesome LBP after controlling for gender (adjusted HRR = 2.24; 95% CI 1.41-3.56). When covariates that may also be mediators of the association were added to the model, the effect estimate was attenuated (adjusted HRR = 1.37; 95% CI 1.41-3.56). We found a similar association between a lifetime history of having taken time off work or had to work light duties at work because of a work-related low back injury, adjusted for gender (adjusted HRR = 2.31; 95% CI 1.39-3.85) which was also diluted by the further adjustment for covariates that may also be mediators of the association (adjusted HRR = 1.80; 95% CI 1.08-3.01).
Our study suggests that a history of work-related low back injury or taking time off work or having to perform light duties at work due to a work-related low back injury may be a risk factor for the development of troublesome LBP. Residual confounding may account for some of the observed associations, but this was less in the group who took time off work or had to work light duties due to a work-related low back injury.
Glucocorticoids can have psychosis as a potential side effect, but have also been suggested to yield protective effects due to anti-inflammatory properties. Nonetheless, knowledge is sparse on the association between glucocorticoid treatment and development of psychosis, which we aimed to study in this first large-scale longitudinal study. Among all individuals born in Denmark 1995-2003 (n=597,257), we compared individuals who had redeemed ≥1 prescription for glucocorticoids to an active comparator group and a non-exposed group concerning subsequent development of schizophrenia spectrum disorders until 2013. Hazard rate ratios (HRR) were estimated using Cox regression adjusted for calendar year, age, gender, urbanization, somatic diseases, parental educational level and psychiatric history. The risk for a subsequent diagnosis of early-onset schizophrenia spectrum disorder (N=1141) was increased after exposure to both non-systemic (HRR=1.47; 95%-CI=1.25-1.73; N=371) and systemic glucocorticoids (HRR=1.66; 95%-CI=1.13-2.43; N=34), when compared to non-exposed individuals. Similar elevated risks were observed when comparing to the active comparator group, for schizophrenia and acute psychosis, and within an older cohort. The risk of psychosis was elevated the most within the first year after exposure to glucocorticoids (P&lt;0.001) without any indication for a dose-response association. However, in individuals with asthma, exposure to glucocorticoids did not further increase the risk of psychosis. Glucocorticoid exposure was associated with an increased risk for psychotic disorders, which may be explained by an effect of the underlying somatic disease, such as asthma. A potential beneficial effect of glucocorticoids on psychotic symptoms should be investigated in clinical trials.
Recent studies show that bile acids are involved in glucose and energy homeostasis through activation of G protein coupled membrane receptor (TGR5) and farnesoid X receptor (FXR). A few researches have explored changes of TGR5 and FXR in animals with impaired glucose regulation. This study aimed to observe changes of plasma total bile acids (TBA), glucagon-like-peptide 1 (GLP-1), fibroblast growth factor 15 (FGF15), intestinal expressions of TGR5 and FXR, and correlations between them in rats with glucose intolerance.
Besides plasma fasting glucose, lipid, TBAs, alanine transaminase (ALT), active GLP-1(GLP-1A) and FGF15, a postprandial meal test was used to compare responses in glucose, insulin and GLP-1A among groups. The expressions of TGR5 and FXR in distal ileum and ascending colon were quantified by real-time PCR and western blot.
TGR5 expression was significantly decreased in distal ileum in DM group compared to other groups, and TGR5 and FXR expressions in ascending colon were also decreased in DM group compared to other groups. Correlation analysis showed correlations between TBA and GLP-1A or FGF15. GLP-1A was correlated with TGR5 mRNA expression in colon, and FGF15 was correlated with FXR mRNA expression in colon.
These results indicates that bile acid-TGR5/FXR axis contributes to glucose homeostasis.
Tartrazine is a food colour that activates the transcriptional function of the human oestrogen receptor alpha in an in vitro cell model. Since oestrogens are cholestatic, we hypothesised tartrazine will cause periportal injury to the liver in vivo. To test this hypothesis, tartrazine was initially administered systemically to mice resulting in a periportal recruitment of inflammatory cells, increased serum alkaline phosphatase activity and mild periportal fibrosis. To determine whether an oestrogenic effect may be a key event in this response, tartrazine, sulphonated metabolites and a food additive contaminant were screened for their ability to interact with murine oestrogen receptors. In all cases, there were no interactions as agonists or antagonists and further, no oestrogenicity was observed with tartrazine in an in vivo uterine growth assay. To examine the relevance of the hepatic effects of tartrazine to its use as a food additive, tartrazine was orally administered to transgenic NF-κB-Luc mice. Pre- and concurrent oral treatment with alcohol was incorporated given its potential to promote gut permeability and hepatic inflammation. Tartrazine alone induced NF- κB activities in the colon and liver but there was no periportal recruitment of inflammatory cells or fibrosis. Tartrazine, its sulphonated metabolites and the contaminant inhibited sulphotransferase activities in murine hepatic S9 extracts. Given the role of sulfotransferases in bile acid excretion, the initiating event giving rise to periportal inflammation and subsequent hepatic pathology through systemic tartrazine exposure is therefore potentially associated an inhibition of bile acid sulphation and excretion and not on oestrogen receptor-mediated transcriptional function. However, these effects were restricted to systemic exposures to tartrazine and did not occur to any significant effect after oral exposure.
The role of endoplasmic reticulum stress and the unfolded protein response (UPR) in cholestatic liver disease and fibrosis is not fully unraveled. Tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA), a hydrophilic bile acid, has been shown to reduce endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and counteract apoptosis in different pathologies. We aimed to investigate the therapeutic potential of TUDCA in experimental secondary biliary liver fibrosis in mice, induced by common bile duct ligation. The kinetics of the hepatic UPR and apoptosis during the development of biliary fibrosis was studied by measuring markers at six different timepoints post-surgery by qPCR and Western blot. Next, we investigated the therapeutic potential of TUDCA, 10 mg/kg/day in drinking water, on liver damage (AST/ALT levels) and fibrosis (Sirius red-staining), in both a preventive and therapeutic setting. Common bile duct ligation resulted in the increased protein expression of CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein homologous protein (CHOP) at all timepoints, along with upregulation of pro-apoptotic caspase 3 and 12, tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily, member 1A (TNFRsf1a) and Fas-Associated protein with Death Domain (FADD) expression. Treatment with TUDCA led to a significant reduction of liver fibrosis, accompanied by a slight reduction of liver damage, decreased hepatic protein expression of CHOP and reduced gene and protein expression of pro-apoptotic markers. These data indicate that TUDCA exerts a beneficial effect on liver fibrosis in a model of cholestatic liver disease, and suggest that this effect might, at least in part, be attributed to decreased hepatic UPR signaling and apoptotic cell death.
The mitochondrial and endoplasmic reticulum unfolded protein responses (UPR(mt) and UPR(ER)) are important for cellular homeostasis during stimulus-induced increases in protein synthesis. Exercise triggers the synthesis of mitochondrial proteins, regulated in part by peroxisome proliferator activator receptor-γ coactivator 1α (PGC-1α). To investigate the role of the UPR in exercise-induced adaptations, we subjected rats to 3 h of chronic contractile activity (CCA) for 1, 2, 3, 5, or 7 days followed by 3 h of recovery. Mitochondrial biogenesis signaling, through PGC-1α mRNA, increased 14-fold after 1 day of CCA. This resulted in 10-32% increases in cytochrome c oxidase activity, indicative of mitochondrial content, between days 3 and 7, as well as increases in the autophagic degradation of p62 and microtubule-associated proteins 1A/1B light chain 3A (LC3)-II protein. Before these adaptations, the UPR(ER) transcripts activating transcription factor-4, spliced X-box-binding protein 1, and binding immunoglobulin protein were elevated (1.3- to 3.8-fold) at days 1-3, while CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein homologous protein (CHOP) and chaperones binding immunoglobulin protein and heat shock protein (HSP) 70 were elevated at mRNA and protein levels (1.5- to 3.9-fold) at days 1-7 of CCA. The mitochondrial chaperones 10-kDa chaperonin, HSP60, and 75-kDa mitochondrial HSP, the protease ATP-dependent Clp protease proteolytic subunit, and the regulatory protein sirtuin-3 of the UPR(mt) were concurrently induced 10-80% between days 1 and 7 To test the role of the UPR in CCA-induced remodeling, we treated animals with the endoplasmic reticulum stress suppressor tauroursodeoxycholic acid and subjected them to 2 or 7 days of CCA. Tauroursodeoxycholic acid attenuated CHOP and HSP70 protein induction; however, this failed to impact mitochondrial remodeling. Our data indicate that signaling to the UPR is rapidly activated following acute contractile activity, that this is attenuated with repeated bouts, and that the UPR is involved in chronic adaptations to CCA; however, this appears to be independent of CHOP signaling. 
Activin A, a multifunctional cytokine, plays an important role in hepatocyte growth suppression and is involved in liver size control. The present study was aimed to determine the cell location of activin A in the normal rat liver microenvironment and the contribution of activin A signaling to the hepatocyte phenotype to obtain insight into molecular mechanisms. Immunohistochemical and in situ hybridization analyses identified hepatocytes as the major activin A-positive cell population in normal liver and identified mast cells as an additional activin A source. To investigate paracrine and autocrine activin A-stimulated effects, hepatocytes were cocultured with engineered activin A-secreting cell lines (RF1, TL8) or transduced with an adeno-associated virus vector encoding activin βA, which led to strikingly altered expression of cell cycle-related genes (Ki-67, E2F transcription factor 1 [E2F1], minichromosome maintenance complex component 2 [Mcm2], forkhead box M1 [FoxM1]) and senescence-related genes (cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2B [p15INK4b/CDKN2B], differentiated embryo-chondrocyte expressed gene 1 [DEC1]) and reduced proliferation and induction of senescence. Microarray analyses identified 453 differentially expressed genes, many of which were not yet recognized as activin A downstream targets (e.g., ADAM metallopeptidase domain 12 [Adam12], semaphorin 7A [Sema7a], LIM and cysteine-rich domains-1 [Lmcd1], DAB2, clathrin adaptor protein [Dab2]). Among the main activin A-mediated molecular/cellular functions are cellular growth/proliferation and movement, molecular transport, and metabolic processes containing highly down-regulated genes, such as cytochrome P450, subfamily 2, polypeptide 11 (Cyp2C11), sulfotransferase family 1A, member 1 (Sult1a1), glycine-N-acyltransferase (Glyat), and bile acid-CoA:amino acid N-acyltransferase (Baat). Moreover, Ingenuity Pathway Analyses identified particular gene networks regulated by hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF)-4α and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) as key targets of activin A signaling. Conclusion: Our in vitro models demonstrated that activin A-stimulated growth inhibition and cellular senescence is mediated through p15INK4b/CDKN2B and is associated with up- and down-regulation of numerous target genes involved in multiple biological processes performed by hepatocytes, suggesting that activin A fulfills a critical role in normal liver function.

In cholestatic liver diseases, impaired bile excretion disrupts lipid homeostasis. We investigated changes of lipid metabolism, including mitochondrial β-oxidation, in a rat model of bile duct ligation (BDL) in which chorionic plate-derived mesenchymal stem cells (CP-MSCs) were transplanted. Serum cholesterol level, which was elevated after BDL, was significantly decreased following CP-MSC transplantation. The expression levels of genes involved in intracellular lipid uptake, including long-chain fatty acyl-CoA synthetases and fatty acid transport proteins, were decreased in rats after BDL; however, they were not significantly changed by subsequent CP-MSC transplantation. Carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1A (CPT1A), a rate-limiting enzyme in mitochondrial β-oxidation, was upregulated after BDL and then was downregulated after CP-MSC transplantation. CPT1A expression was changed via microRNA-33-a posttranscriptional regulator of CPT1A-in a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α-independent manner. Cellular adenosine triphosphate production-an indicator of mitochondrial function-was reduced after BDL and was restored by CP-MSC transplantation. Expression levels of heme oxygenases also were significantly affected following BDL and CP-MSC transplantation. Lipid metabolism is altered in response to chronic cholestatic liver injury and can be restored by CP-MSC transplantation. Our study findings support the therapeutic potential of CP-MSCs in cholestatic liver diseases and help in understanding the fundamental mechanisms by which CP-MSCs affect energy metabolism.
The p38α mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) has been related to gluconeogenesis and lipid metabolism. However, the roles and related mechanisms of p38α MAPK in intestinal failure (IF)-associated liver steatosis remained poor understood. Here, our experimental evidence suggested that p38α MAPK significantly suppressed the fat accumulation in livers of IF patients mainly through two mechanisms. On the one hand, p38α MAPK increased hepatic bile acid (BA) synthesis by upregulating the expression of the rate-limiting enzyme cholesterol 7-α-hydroxylase (CYP7A1) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator-1α (PGC-1α), which in turn activated the transcription of the CYP7A1. On the other hand, p38α MAPK promoted fatty acid (FA) β-oxidation via upregulating peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARα) and its transcriptional target genes carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1A (CPT1A) and peroxisomal acyl-coenzyme aoxidase 1 (ACOX1). Dual luciferase assays indicated that p38α MAPK increased the transcription of PPARα, PGC-1α and CYP7A1 by upregulating their promoters' activities. In addition, in vitro and in vivo assays indicated p38α MAPK negatively regulates the hepatic steatosis by controlling JNK activation. In conculsion, our findings demonstrate that hepatic p38α MAPK functions as a negative regulator of liver steatosis in maintaining BA synthesis and FAO by antagonizing the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK).
MAF bZIP transcription factor G (MAFG) is activated by the farnesoid X receptor (FXR) to repress bile acid synthesis. However, expression of MAFG increases during cholestatic liver injury in mice and in cholangiocarcinomas. MAFG interacts directly with methionine adenosyltransferase 1A (MAT1A) and other transcription factors at the E-box element to repress transcription. We studied mechanisms of MAFG upregulation in cholestatic tissues and the pathways by which S-adenosylmethionine (SAMe) and ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) prevent the increase in MAFG expression. We also investigated whether obeticholic acid (OCA), an FXR agonist, affects MAFG expression and how it contributes to tumor growth in mice.
We obtained 7 human cholangiocarcinoma specimens and adjacent non-tumor tissues from patients that underwent surgical resection in California and 113 hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) specimens and adjacent non-tumor tissues from China, along with clinical data from patients. Tissues were analyzed by immunohistochemistry. MAT1A, MAT2A, c-MYC, and MAFG were overexpressed or knocked down with small interfering RNAs in MzChA-1, KMCH, Hep3B, and HepG2 cells; some cells were incubated with lithocholic acid (LCA, which causes the same changes in gene expression observed during chronic cholestatic liver injury in mice), SAMe, UDCA (100 μM), or FXR agonists. MAFG expression and promoter activity were measured using real-time PCR, immunoblot, and transient transfection. We performed electrophoretic mobility shift, and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays to study proteins that occupy promoter regions. We studied mice with bile-duct ligation, orthotopic cholangiocarcinomas, cholestasis-induced cholangiocarcinoma, diethylnitrosamine-induced liver tumors, and xenograft tumors.
LCA activated expression of MAFG in HepG2 and MzChA-1 cells, which required the AP-1, NF-κB, and E-box sites in the MAFG promoter. LCA reduced expression of MAT1A but increased expression of MAT2A in cells. Overexpression of MAT2A increased activity of the MAFG promoter whereas knockdown of MAT2A reduced it; MAT1A and MAT2A had opposite effects on the AP-1, NF-κB, and E-box-mediated promoter activity. Expression of MAFG and MAT2A increased, and expression of MAT1A decreased, in diethylnitrosamine-induced liver tumors in mice. SAMe and UDCA had shared and distinct mechanisms of preventing LCA-mediated increased expression of MAFG. OCA increased expression of MAFG, MAT2A, and c-MYC but reduced expression of MAT1A. Incubation of human liver and biliary cancer cells lines with OCA promoted their proliferation; in nude mice given OCA, xenograft tumors were larger than in mice given vehicle. Levels of MAFG were increased in human HCC and cholangiocarcinoma tissues compared with non-tumor tissues. High levels of MAFG in HCC samples correlated with hepatitis B, vascular invasion, and shorter survival times of patients.
Expression of MAFG increases in cells and tissues with cholestasis, as well as in human cholangiocarcinoma and HCC specimens; high expression levels correlate with tumor progression and reduced survival time. SAMe and UDCA reduce expression of MAFG in response to cholestasis, by shared and distinct mechanisms. OCA induces MAFG expression, cancer cell proliferation, and growth of xenograft tumors in mice.
We previously reported that alcohol drinkers with and without cirrhosis showed a significant increase in fecal bile acid secretion compared to nondrinkers. We hypothesized this may be due to activation by alcohol of hepatic cyclic adenosine monophosphate responsive element-binding protein 3-like protein 3 (CREBH), which induces cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase (Cyp7a1). Alternatively, the gut microbiota composition in the absence of alcohol might increase bile acid synthesis by up-regulating Cyp7a1. To test this hypothesis, we humanized germ-free (GF) mice with stool from healthy human subjects (Ctrl-Hum), human subjects with cirrhosis (Cirr-Hum), and human subjects with cirrhosis and active alcoholism (Alc-Hum). All animals were fed a normal chow diet, and none demonstrated cirrhosis. Both hepatic Cyp7a1 and sterol 12α-hydroxylase (Cyp8b1) messenger RNA (mRNA) levels were significantly induced in the Alc-Hum and Ctrl-Hum mice but not in the Cirr-Hum mice or GF mice. Liver bile acid concentration was correspondingly increased in the Alc-Hum mice despite fibroblast growth factor 15, fibroblast growth receptor 4, and small heterodimer partner mRNA levels being significantly induced in the large bowel and liver of the Ctrl-Hum mice and Alc-Hum mice but not in the Cirr-Hum mice or GF mice. This suggests that the normal pathways of Cyp7a1 repression were activated in the Alc-Hum mice and Ctrl-Hum mice. CREBH mRNA was significantly induced only in the Ctrl-Hum mice and Alc-Hum mice, possibly indicating that the gut microbiota up-regulate CREBH and induce bile acid synthesis genes. Analysis of stool bile acids showed that the microbiota of the Cirr-Hum and Alc-Hum mice had a greater ability to deconjugate and 7α-dehydroxylate primary bile acids compared to the microbiota of the Cirr-Hum mice. 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing of the gut microbiota showed that the relative abundance of taxa that 7-α dehydroxylate primary bile acids was higher in the Ctrl-Hum and Alc-Hum groups. Conclusion: The composition of gut microbiota influences the regulation of the rate-limiting enzymes in bile acid synthesis in the liver. (Hepatology Communications 2017;1:61-70).
Gut metagenomic sequences provide a rich source of microbial genes, the majority of which are annotated by homology or unknown. Genes and gene pathways that encode enzymes catalyzing biotransformation of host bile acids are important to identify in gut metagenomic sequences due to the importance of bile acids in gut microbiome structure and host physiology. Hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases (HSDHs) are pyridine nucleotide-dependent enzymes with stereospecificity and regiospecificity for bile acid and steroid hydroxyl groups. HSDHs have been identified in several protein families, including medium-chain and short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase families as well as the aldo-keto reductase family. These protein families are large and contain diverse functionalities, making prediction of HSDH-encoding genes difficult and necessitating biochemical characterization. We located a gene cluster in Eggerthella sp. CAG:298 predicted to encode three HSDHs (CDD59473, CDD59474, and CDD59475) and synthesized the genes for heterologous expression in Escherichia coli We then screened bile acid substrates against the purified recombinant enzymes. CDD59475 is a novel 12α-HSDH, and we determined that CDD59474 (3α-HSDH) and CDD59473 (3β-HSDH) constitute novel enzymes in an iso-bile acid pathway. Phylogenetic analysis of these HSDHs with other gut bacterial HSDHs and closest homologues in the database revealed predictable clustering of HSDHs by function and identified several likely HSDH sequences from bacteria isolated or sequenced from diverse mammalian and avian gut samples.IMPORTANCE Bacterial HSDHs have the potential to significantly alter the physicochemical properties of bile acids, with implications for increased/decreased toxicity for gut bacteria and the host. The generation of oxo-bile acids is known to inhibit host enzymes involved in glucocorticoid metabolism and may alter signaling through nuclear receptors such as farnesoid X receptor and G-protein-coupled receptor TGR5. Biochemical or similar approaches are required to fill in many gaps in our ability to link a particular enzymatic function with a nucleic acid or amino acid sequence. In this regard, we have identified a novel 12α-HSDH and a novel set of genes encoding an iso-bile acid pathway (3α-HSDH and 3β-HSDH) involved in epimerization and detoxification of harmful secondary bile acids.
In the present study, farnesoid X receptor (FXR) was cloned and characterized from liver of large yellow croaker (L crocea) and the effects of dietary chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA), a nature ligand of FXR, on the inflammatory genes expression in the intestine and spleen of large yellow croaker were investigated. Multiple alignments showed that FXR of large yellow croaker contained highly conserved DNA-binding domain and ligand binding domain compared with other species. The subcellular localization analysis showed that FXR-GFP fusion protein could target to the nucleus in HEK 293t. The tissue specific results demonstrated that FXR was highly expressed in liver, intestine and kidney of large yellow croaker. In addition, dietary soybean oil decreased the expression of FXR and IL-10 and significantly increased the expression of the pro-inflammatory genes in the intestine or spleen, such as TNFα, COX-2, IL-1β, IL-6, while the supplementation of CDCA could partly reverse these effects. These results suggested that the supplementation of CDCA may relieve the inflammation of intestine and spleen in large yellow croaker via the activation of FXR.
Bile salts represent signalling molecules with a variety of endocrine functions. Bile salt effects are mediated by different receptor molecules, comprising ligand-activated nuclear transcription factors as well as G protein-coupled membrane-bound receptors. The farnesoid X receptor (FXR) and the plasma membrane-bound G protein-coupled receptor TGR5 (Gpbar-1) are prototypic bile salt receptors of both classes and are highly expressed in the liver including the biliary tree as well as in the intestine. In liver, TGR5 is localized in different non-parenchymal cells such as sinusoidal endothelial cells, Kupffer cells, hepatic stellate cells and small and large cholangiocytes. Through TGR5 bile salts can mediate choleretic, cell-protective as well as proliferative effects in cholangiocytes. A disturbance of these signalling mechanisms can contribute to the development of biliary diseases. In line with the important role of TGR5 for bile salt signalling, TGR5 knockout mice are more susceptible to cholestatic liver damage. Furthermore, in absence of TGR5 cholangiocyte proliferation in response to cholestasis is attenuated and intrahepatic and extrahepatic bile ducts show increased cell damage, underscoring the role of the receptor for biliary physiology. Decreased TGR5 expression may also contribute to the development or progression of cholangiopathies like primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) and primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) since reduced TGR5-dependent cell-protective mechanisms such as bicarbonate secretion renders cholangiocytes more vulnerable towards bile salt toxicity. Nevertheless, TGR5 overexpression or constant stimulation of the receptor can promote cholangiocyte proliferation leading to cyst growth in polycystic liver disease or even progression of cholangiocarcinoma. Not only the stimulation of TGR5-mediated pathways by suitable TGR5 agonists but also the inhibition of TGR5 signalling by the use of antagonists represent potential therapeutic approaches for different types of biliary diseases.

Dafachronic acid (DA) is a bile acid-like steroid hormone that regulates dauer formation, heterochrony, and lifespan in C. elegans. Here, we describe that DA is an inhibitor of C. elegans germ stem cell proliferation in adult hermaphrodites. Using a C. elegans germ cell primary culture system, we show that DA inhibits the proliferation of germ cells in vitro. Exogenous DA reduces the frequency of large tumors in adult tumorous germline mutants and decreases the proliferation of wild-type germ stem cells in adult hermaphrodites. In contrast, DA has no appreciable effect on the proliferation of larval-stage germ cells in wild type. The inhibition of adult germ cell proliferation by DA requires its canonical receptor DAF-12. Blocking DA production by inactivating the cytochrome P450 DAF-9 increases germ cell proliferation in wild-type adult hermaphrodites and the frequency of large tumors in germline tumorous mutants, suggesting that DA inhibits the rate of germ cell proliferation under normal growth conditions.
The nuclear receptor FXR regulates the expression of genes involved in bile acids, glucose and lipid homeostasis. For its role as guardian of metabolism, FXR has been identified a promising pharmacological target in liver bile acid and lipid accumulation, such as cholestasis and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). The field of FXR research is extremely competitive with a large number of patents and articles published in the last decades identifying promising hit compounds. Areas covered. The present review summarizes recent patent activity (2014-to date) filing for synthetic and natural FXR ligands, including bile acid derivatives and non-steroidal compounds, alongside their in vitro and in vivo efficacy as well as their therapeutic applications. Expert opinion. While the first FXR agonist, obeticholic acid, has gained approval, significant safety issues have been emerged. Today is unclear whether these safety issues are class related or restricted to the bile acid scaffold of this agent. Despite the significant number of patent applications claiming steroidal and non-steroidal FXR agonists, several questions on their therapeutic potential in cholestasis and NASH remain open leaving a space for the development of novel compounds.
The bile acid-sensitive ion channel is activated by amphiphilic substances such as bile acids or artificial detergents via membrane alterations; however, the mechanism of membrane sensitivity of the bile acid-sensitive ion channel is not known. It has also not been systematically investigated whether other members of the degenerin/epithelial Na+ channel (DEG/ENaC) gene family are affected by amphiphilic compounds. Here, we show that DEG/ENaCs ASIC1a, ASIC3, ENaC, and the purinergic receptor P2X2 are modulated by a large number of different, structurally unrelated amphiphilic substances, namely the detergents N-lauroylsarcosine, Triton X-100, and β-octylglucoside; the fenamate flufenamic acid; the antipsychotic drug chlorpromazine; the natural phenol resveratrol; the chili pepper compound capsaicin; the loop diuretic furosemide; and the antiarrythmic agent verapamil. We determined the modification of membrane properties using large-angle x-ray diffraction experiments on model lipid bilayers, revealing that the amphiphilic compounds are positioned in a characteristic fashion either in the lipid tail group region or in the lipid head group region, demonstrating that they perturbed the membrane structure. Collectively, our results show that DEG/ENaCs and structurally related P2X receptors are modulated by diverse amphiphilic molecules. Furthermore, they suggest alterations of membrane properties by amphiphilic compounds as a mechanism contributing to modulation.
We attempted to clarify the therapeutic capability of antagonists of the farnesoid X receptor (FXR), a nuclear receptor that regulates lipid and bile acid metabolism. Herein, we report the antidyslipidemic effects of a novel synthesized FXR antagonist, compound-T1, utilizing a dyslipidemic hamster model. Compound-T1 selectively inhibited chenodeoxycholic acid-induced FXR activation (IC 50, 2.1 nmol·L-1). A hamster model of diet-induced hyperlipidemia was prepared to investigate the antidyslipidemic effects of compound-T1 through comparative studies of the nonstatin lipid-modulating agents ezetimibe, cholestyramine, and torcetrapib. In the hamster model, compound-T1 (6 mg·kg-1·day-1, p.o.) increased the level of plasma high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol (+22.2%) and decreased the levels of plasma non-HDL-cholesterol (-43.6%) and triglycerides (-31.1%). Compound-T1 also increased hepatic cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase expression and fecal bile acid excretion, and decreased hepatic cholesterol content. Moreover, the hamster model could reflect clinical results of other nonstatin agents. Torcetrapib especially increased large HDL particles compared with compound-T1. Additionally, in the human hepatoma Huh-7 cells, compound-T1 enhanced apolipoprotein A-I secretion at a concentration close to its IC 50 value for FXR. Our results indicated the usefulness of the hamster model in evaluating FXR antagonists and nonstatin agents. Notably, compound-T1 exhibited beneficial effects on both blood non-HDL-cholesterol and HDL-cholesterol, which are thought to involve enhancement of cholesterol catabolism and apolipoprotein A-I production. These findings aid the understanding of the antidyslipidemic potential of FXR antagonists with a unique lipid and bile acid modulation.
Whole-grain highland hull-less barley (WHLB) contains high amounts of bioactive compounds that potentially exhibit cholesterol-lowering effects. This study investigated the hypocholesterolaemic effect of WHLB. A total of seventy-two male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into four groups and were fed with the normal control diet, high-fat diet (HFD) and HFD containing low or high dose (10 or 48·95 %) of WHLB. High dose of WHLB significantly decreased the organ indexes of liver and abdominal fat and lipid levels of plasma and liver in HFD rats. The lipid regulation effect of WHLB, which was reconfirmed through hepatocyte morphologic observation, was accompanied by a large excretion of bile acids in the small intestinal contents and the faeces. Real-time PCR analyses, which were further reconfirmed through Western blot analyses, revealed that a high dose of WHLB significantly enhanced the hepatic expressions of AMP-activated protein kinase α, cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase, LDL receptor, liver X receptor, and PPARα and decreased the expression of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase. It also enhanced the ileal expression of farnesoid X receptor and resulted in the decrease of expression of apical sodium-dependent bile acid transporter. WHLB exhibited hypocholesterolaemic effects mainly by inhibiting cholesterol synthesis, cholesterol accumulation in peripheral tissue, and bile acid reabsorption and by stimulating bile acid synthesis.
Prevalence of diabetes mellitus, a chronic metabolic disease characterized by hyperglycemia, is growing worldwide. The majority of the cases belong to type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Globally, India ranks second in terms of diabetes prevalence among adults. Currently available classes of therapeutic agents are used alone or in combinations but seldom achieve treatment targets. Diverse pathophysiology and the need of therapeutic agents with more favourable pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamics profile make newer drug discoveries in the field of T2DM essential. A large number of molecules, some with novel mechanisms, are in pipeline. The essence of this review is to track and discuss these potential agents, based on their developmental stages, especially those in phase 3 or phase 2. Unique molecules are being developed for existing drug classes like insulins, DPP-4 inhibitors, GLP-1 analogues; and under newer classes like dual/pan PPAR agonists, dual SGLT1/SGLT2 inhibitors, glimins, anti-inflammatory agents, glucokinase activators, G-protein coupled receptor agonists, hybrid peptide agonists, apical sodium-dependent bile acid transporter (ASBT) inhibitors, glucagon receptor antagonists etc. The heterogeneous clinical presentation and therapeutic outcomes in phenotypically similar patients is a clue to think beyond the standard treatment strategy.
Vitamin A is a fat-soluble vitamin important for vision, reproduction, embryonic development, cell differentiation, epithelial barrier function and adequate immune responses. Efficient absorption of dietary vitamin A depends on the fat-solubilizing properties of bile acids. Bile acids are synthesized in the liver and maintained in an enterohepatic circulation. The liver is also the main storage site for vitamin A in the mammalian body, where an intimate collaboration between hepatocytes and hepatic stellate cells leads to the accumulation of retinyl esters in large cytoplasmic lipid droplet hepatic stellate cells. Chronic liver diseases are often characterized by disturbed bile acid and vitamin A homeostasis, where bile production is impaired and hepatic stellate cells lose their vitamin A in a transdifferentiation process to myofibroblasts, cells that produce excessive extracellular matrix proteins leading to fibrosis. Chronic liver diseases thus may lead to vitamin A deficiency. Recent data reveal an intricate crosstalk between vitamin A metabolites and bile acids, in part via the Retinoic Acid Receptor (RAR), Retinoid X Receptor (RXR) and the Farnesoid X Receptor (FXR), in maintaining vitamin A and bile acid homeostasis. Here, we provide an overview of the various levels of "communication" between vitamin A metabolites and bile acids and its relevance for the treatment of chronic liver diseases.
Bile acids are end products of cholesterol metabolism generated in the liver and released in the intestine. Primary and secondary bile acids are the result of the symbiotic relation between the host and intestinal microbiota. In addition to their role in nutrient absorption, bile acids are increasingly recognized as regulatory signals that exert their function beyond the intestine by activating a network of membrane and nuclear receptors. The best characterized of these bile acid-activated receptors, GPBAR1 (also known as TGR5) and the farnesosid-X-receptor (FXR), have also been detected in the vascular system and their activation mediates the vasodilatory effects of bile acids in the systemic and splanchnic circulation. GPBAR1, is a G protein-coupled receptor, that is preferentially activated by lithocholic acid (LCA) a secondary bile acid. GPBAR1 is expressed in endothelial cells and liver sinusoidal cells (LSECs) and responds to LCA by regulating the expression of both endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) and cystathionine-γ-lyase (CSE), an enzyme involved in generation of hydrogen sulfide (H2S). Activation of CSE by GPBAR1 ligands in LSECs is due to genomic and nongenomic effects, involves protein phosphorylation, and leads to release of H2S. Despite that species-specific effects have been described, vasodilation caused by GPBAR1 ligands in the liver microcirculation and aortic rings is abrogated by inhibition of CSE but not by eNOS inhibitor. Vasodilation caused by GPBAR1 (and FXR) ligands also involves large conductance calcium-activated potassium channels likely acting downstream to H2S. The identification of GPBAR1 as a vasodilatory receptor is of relevance in the treatment of complex disorders including metabolic syndrome-associated diseases, liver steatohepatitis, and portal hypertension.
The organic cation transporter 1 (OCT1) is the dominant carrier of organic cationic drugs and some positively charged endogenous compounds into hepatocytes. OCT1 has unique expression pattern. It has the highest expression among drug transporters in normal human hepatocytes with large interindividual variability, but it has negligible expression in other tissues or their tumors. Nowadays, it is clear that the regulation of SLC22A1 gene encoding OCT1 transporter is rather complex and that transactivation with hepatocyte nuclear factor 4α (HNF4α) and CCAAT-enhancer-binding protein (C/EBPs) transcription factors as well as epigenetic regulation contribute to its unique hepatocyte-specific expression pattern. Unfortunately, species- and tissue-specific regulation of OCT1 and its orthologs as well as significant down-regulation in most immortalized cell lines hamper the study of SLC22A1 gene regulation. In the current review, we summarize our current understanding of human OCT1 transporter hepatic gene regulation and we propose potential post-transcriptional regulation by predicted miRNAs. We also discuss in detail recent findings on indirect regulation of the transporter via farnesoid X receptor (FXR), glucocorticoid receptor and pregnane X (PXR) receptor, which point out to potential novel mechanisms of xenobiotic-transporting and drug-metabolizing proteins regulation in the human liver as well as to potentially novel drug-drug interaction mechanisms. We also propose that comprehensive understanding of mechanisms of SLC22A1 gene regulation could direct research for other drug transporters and drug-metabolizing enzymes highly expressed in hepatocytes and controlled by HNF4α or other liver-enriched transcription factors.
There is a great need for risk stratification in patients with chronic cholestatic diseases in order to allow for more personalized care and adapted management as well as for well-designed therapeutic trials. Novel tools for monitoring primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) and primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) patients have been recently proposed. In addition, major insight has been gained into bile acid (BA) physiology during the last decade including the role of BAs as metabolic modulators and the gut-liver axis. As a consequence, alongside drugs targeting immune response or fibrotic processes, a number of novel anti-cholestatic agents have undergone pre-clinical and clinical evaluation and have shown promising results although none has been approved yet.
Biochemical non-response to ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) (mainly defined by bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase levels at 1 year) is a strong prognostic factor in PBC whereas present biochemical surrogates are far from robust in PSC. By contrast, liver stiffness measurement by vibration-controlled transient elastography (VCTE) is a very promising tool in both PBC and PSC. Novel therapeutic approaches include (i) agonists of nuclear receptors, especially farnesoid X receptor (FXR), pregnane X receptor (PXR), glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα) that are transcriptional modifiers of bile formation; (ii) agonists of TGR5, a BA membrane receptor expressed in various tissues; (iii) inhibitors of the ileal apical sodium BA transporter; (iv) derivatives of the FXR-induced fibroblast growth factor 19 from the ileum that suppresses hepatic BA synthesis and (v) norUDCA, a side chain shortened UDCA derivative with specific physicochemical and therapeutic properties. The most advanced clinical evaluation (PBC patients) relates to agonists for PPARα, FXR and GR/PXR most often in combination with UDCA, namely fibrates, obeticholic acid (OCA) and budesonide, respectively. Existing results look promising even though some side effects are worrisome such as pruritus in OCA-treated patients. Results of large well-designed studies are eagerly awaited.
Major advances in the management of cholestatic liver diseases are in progress and promising times for these patients seem likely in the near future.
The farnesoid X receptor (FXR) is a nuclear receptor responsible for homeostasis of bile acids, lipids, and glucose. Compounds that alter endogenous FXR signaling can be used as therapeutic candidates or identified as potentially hazardous compounds depending on exposure doses and health states. Therefore, there is an increasing need for high-throughput screening assays of FXR activity to profile large numbers of environmental chemicals and drugs. This chapter describes a workflow of FXR modulator identification and characterization. To identify compounds that modulate FXR transactivation at the cellular level, we first screen compounds from the Tox21 10 K compound library in an FXR-driven beta-lactamase reporter gene assay multiplexed with a cell viability assay in the same well of the 1536-well plates. The selected compounds are then tested biochemically for their ability to modulate FXR-coactivator binding interactions using a time-resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer (TR-FRET) coactivator assay. The assay results from the workflow can be used to prioritize compounds for more extensive investigations.
Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) represents a spectrum, including 'simple' steatosis, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), and fibrosis. Increasing prevalence of NAFLD has followed the international rise in obesity and lifestyle modification is the mainstay therapy for children. To date, pharmacological trials have had varying efficacy but a large number of new agents are in early phase trials for adults. Areas covered: This review explores the effect of current and potential future paediatric NAFLD treatments in terms of histological and biochemical endpoints. The potential for the extension of adult treatments to children is discussed, as well as what limits the use of certain agents in children. Expert commentary: No drugs have yet to be licenced for NAFLD. Trial heterogeneity makes comparison of drugs between studies challenging. FXR agonists are yet to be trialled in children but may represent a safe and potentially efficacious therapy. Future treatments would likely encompass a multimodal approach that may include bariatric surgery.
The development of hepatoblastoma (HBL) is associated with failure of hepatic stem cells (HSC) to differentiate into hepatocytes. Despite intensive investigations, mechanisms of the failure of HSC to differentiate are not known. We found that oncogene Gankyrin (Gank) is involved in the inhibition of differentiation of HSC via triggering degradation of tumor suppressor proteins (TSPs) Rb, p53, C/EBPα and HNF4α. Our data show that the activation of a repressor of Gank, farnesoid X receptor, FXR, after initiation of liver cancer by Diethylnitrosamine (DEN) prevents the development of liver cancer by inhibiting Gank and rescuing tumor suppressor proteins. We next analyzed FXR-Gank-Tumor suppressor pathways in a large cohort of HBL patients which include 6 controls and 53 HBL samples. Systemic analysis of these samples and RNA-Seq approach revealed that the FXR-Gank axis is activated; markers of hepatic stem cells are dramatically elevated and hepatocyte markers are reduced in HBL samples. In the course of these studies, we found that RNA binding protein CUGBP1 is a new tumor suppressor protein which is reduced in all HBL samples. Therefore, we generated CUGBP1 KO mice and examined HBL signatures in the liver of these mice. Micro-array studies revealed that the HBL-specific molecular signature is developed in livers of CUGBP1 KO mice at very early ages. Thus, we conclude that FXR-Gank-TSPs-Stem cells pathway is a key determinant of liver cancer in animal models and in pediatric liver cancer. Our data provide a strong basis for development of FXR-Gank-based therapy for treatment of patients with hepatoblastoma.
Tissue repair is orchestrated by a finely tuned interplay between processes of regeneration, inflammation and cell protection, allowing organisms to restore their integrity after partial loss of cells or organs. An important, although largely unexplored feature is that after injury and during liver repair, liver functions have to be maintained to fulfill the peripheral demand. This is particularly critical for bile secretion, which has to be finely modulated in order to preserve liver parenchyma from bile-induced injury. However, mechanisms allowing the liver to maintain biliary homeostasis during repair after injury are not completely understood. Besides cytokines and growth factors, bile acids (BA) and their receptors constitute an insufficiently explored signaling network during liver regeneration and repair. BA signal through both nuclear (mainly Farnesoid X Receptor, FXR) and membrane (mainly G Protein-coupled BA Receptor 1, GPBAR-1 or TGR5) receptors which distributions are large in the organism, and which activation elicits a wide array of biological responses. While a number of studies have been dedicated to FXR signaling in liver repair processes, TGR5 remains poorly explored in this context. Because of the massive and potentially harmful BA overload that faces the remnant liver after partial ablation or destruction, both BA-induced adaptive and proliferative responses may stand in a central position to contribute to the regenerative response. Based on the available literature, both BA receptors may act in synergy during the regeneration process, in order to protect the remnant liver and maintain biliary homeostasis, otherwise potentially toxic BA overload would result in parenchymal insult and compromise optimal restoration of a functional liver mass.
microRNAs (miRNAs or miRs) are small non-coding RNAs that are involved in post-transcriptional regulation of their target genes in a sequence-specific manner. Emerging evidence demonstrates that miRNAs are critical regulators of lipid synthesis, fatty acid oxidation and lipoprotein formation and secretion. Dysregulation of miRNAs disrupts gene regulatory network, leading to metabolic syndrome and its related diseases. In this review, we introduced epigenetic and transcriptional regulation of miRNAs expression. We emphasized on several representative miRNAs that are functionally involved into lipid metabolism, including miR-33/33(⁎), miR122, miR27a/b, miR378/378(⁎), miR-34a and miR-21. Understanding the function of miRNAs in lipid homeostasis may provide potential therapeutic strategies for fatty liver disease. 
Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1), the most conserved mammalian oxidized nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide-dependent protein deacetylase, is an important metabolic sensor in many tissues. However, little is known about its role in the small intestine, which absorbs and senses nutrients. We investigated the functions of intestinal SIRT1 in systemic bile acid and cholesterol metabolism in mice.
SIRT1 was specifically deleted from the intestines of mice using the flox-Villin-Cre system (SIRT1 iKO mice). Intestinal and hepatic tissues were collected, and bile acid absorption was analyzed using the everted gut sac experiment. Systemic bile acid metabolism was studied in SIRT1 iKO and flox control mice placed on standard diets, diets containing 0.5% cholic acid or 1.25% cholesterol, or lithogenic diets.
SIRT1 iKO mice had reduced intestinal farnesoid X receptor (FXR) signaling via hepatocyte nuclear factor 1α (HNF-1α) compared with controls, which reduced expression of the bile acid transporter genes Asbt and Mcf2l (encodes Ost) and absorption of ileal bile acids. SIRT1 regulated HNF-1α/FXR signaling partially through dimerization cofactor of HNF-1a (Dcoh2) Dcoh2, which increases dimerization of HNF-1α. SIRT1 was found to deacetylate Dcoh2, promoting its interaction with HNF-1α and inducing DNA binding by HNF-1α. Intestine-specific deletion of SIRT1 increased hepatic bile acid biosynthesis, reduced hepatic accumulation of bile acids, and protected animals from liver damage from a diet high in levels of bile acids.
Intestinal SIRT1, a key nutrient sensor, is required for ileal bile acid absorption and systemic bile acid homeostasis in mice. We delineated the mechanism of metabolic regulation of HNF-1α/FXR signaling. Reagents designed to inhibit intestinal SIRT1 might be developed to treat bile acid-related diseases such as cholestasis.
The third component of human complement (C3) plays a central role in innate immune function as its activation is required to trigger classical as well as alternative complement pathways. In this study, we have observed that sera from patients chronically infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV) displayed significantly lower C3 levels than sera from healthy individuals. Liver biopsy specimens from the same patients also exhibited lower C3 mRNA expression than liver tissues from healthy donors. C3 mRNA level was reduced in hepatocytes upon infection with cell culture-grown HCV genotype 1a or 2a in vitro. Further analysis suggested that HCV core protein displayed a weak repression of C3 promoter activity by downregulating the transcription factor farnesoid X receptor (FXR). On the other hand, HCV NS5A protein strongly downregulated C3 promoter activity at the basal level or in the presence of interleukin-1β (IL-1β) as an inducer. In addition, the expression of the transcription factor CAAT/enhancer binding protein beta (C/EBP-β), which binds to the IL-1/IL-6 response element in the C3 promoter, was inhibited in liver biopsy specimens. Furthermore, expression of C/EBP-β was reduced in hepatocytes infected with cell culture-grown HCV, as well as in hepatocytes transfected with the NS5A genomic region of HCV. Together, these results underscore the role of HCV NS5A protein in impairing innate immune function.
To further explore the optimum placement of the acid moiety in conformationally constrained analogs of GW 4064 1a, a series of stilbene replacements were prepared. The benzothiophene 1f and the indole 1g display the optimal orientation of the carboxylate for enhanced FXR agonist potency.
The pentacyclic triterpene oleanolic acid (OA, 1) with known farnesoid X receptor (FXR) modulatory activity was modified at its C-3 position to find new FXR-interacting agents. A diverse substitution library of OA derivatives was constructed in silico through a 2D fingerprint similarity cluster strategy. With further docking analysis, four top-scored OA 3-O-ester derivatives were selected for synthesis. The bioassay results indicated that all four compounds 3 inhibited chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA)-induced FXR transactivation in a concentration-dependent mode. Among them 3b and 3d are more active than the parent compound OA. A molecular simulation study was performed to attempt to explain the structure-activity relationship (SAR) and the antagonistic action. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on semi-synthetic pentacyclic triterpenoids with FXR-modulatory activities.
Pyrrolizidine alkaloids (PAs) comprise a large group of more than 660 secondary metabolites found in more than 6000 plant species worldwide. Acute PA intoxication induces severe liver damage. Chronic exposure to sub-lethal doses may cause cumulative damage or cancer. Nuclear receptor activation often constitutes a molecular event for xenobiotic-induced toxicity. However, so far nothing is known about potential interactions of PAs with nuclear receptors as a toxicological mode of action. Thus, in the present study PA-dependent activation of a comprehensive panel of nuclear receptors (PPARs, LXRα, RARα, RXRα, FXR, CAR, PXR, ERα/β) was investigated using GAL4/UAS-based transactivation reporter gene assays. To cover the most frequently occurring PA structure types (retronecine, heliotridine and otonecine type; as well as monoester, open-chain diester and cyclic diester) different PAs were analyzed for interaction with nuclear receptors. Most of the nuclear receptors investigated were not affected by the tested PAs. However, significant activation was found for PXR, which was exclusively activated by the open-chain diesters, echimidine and lasiocarpine. Induction of the model PXR target gene CYP3A4 by PAs was verified at the mRNA, protein and enzyme activity level. In conclusion, PXR activation and PXR-mediated induction of CYP3A4 expression by PAs seem to be structure-dependent. Data suggest that only open-chain diesters act as PXR agonists. This might imply that a PXR-mediated mode of action may contribute to the hepatotoxicity of PAs that is dependent on PA structure.
The liver is to date the best example of a sexually dimorphic non-reproductive organ. Over 1,000 genes are differentially expressed between sexes indicating that female and male livers are two metabolically distinct organs. The spectrum of liver diseases is broad and is usually prevalent in one or the other sex, with different contributing genetic and environmental factors. It is thus difficult to predict individual's disease outcomes and treatment options. Systems approaches including mathematical modeling can aid importantly in understanding the multifactorial liver disease etiology leading toward tailored diagnostics, prognostics and therapy. The currently established computational models of hepatic metabolism that have proven to be essential for understanding of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are limited to the description of gender-independent response or reflect solely the response of the males. Herein we present LiverSex, the first sex-based multi-tissue and multi-level liver metabolic computational model. The model was constructed based on in silico liver model SteatoNet and the object-oriented modeling. The crucial factor in adaptation of liver metabolism to the sex is the inclusion of estrogen and androgen receptor responses to respective hormones and the link to sex-differences in growth hormone release. The model was extensively validated on literature data and experimental data obtained from wild type C57BL/6 mice fed with regular chow and western diet. These experimental results show extensive sex-dependent changes and could not be reproduced in silico with the uniform model SteatoNet. LiverSex represents the first large-scale liver metabolic model, which allows a detailed insight into the sex-dependent complex liver pathologies, and how the genetic and environmental factors interact with the sex in disease appearance and progression. We used the model to identify the most important sex-dependent metabolic pathways, which are involved in accumulation of triglycerides representing initial steps of NAFLD. We identified PGC1A, PPARα, FXR, and LXR as regulatory factors that could become important in sex-dependent personalized treatment of NAFLD.
The farnesoid X receptor (FXR or NR1H4) is an important bile-acid-activated, transcriptional regulator of genes involved in bile acid, lipid, and glucose homeostasis. Accordingly, interindividual variations in FXR expression and function could manifest as variable susceptibility to conditions such as cholesterol gallstone disease, atherosclerosis, and diabetes. We performed an FXR polymorphism discovery analysis of European-, African-, Chinese-, and Hispanic-Americans and identified two rare gain-of-function variants and a common single nucleotide polymorphism resulting in a G-1T substitution in the nucleotide adjacent to the translation initiation site (FXR*1B) with population allelic frequencies ranging from 2.5 to 12%. In cell-based transactivation assays, FXR*1B (-1T) activity was reduced compared with FXR*1A (-1G). This reduced activity for FXR*1B resulted from neither decreased translational efficiency nor the potential formation of a truncated translational variant. To further define the relevance of this polymorphism, gene expression was examined in a human liver bank to reveal that levels of the FXR target genes small heterodimer partner and organic anion transporting polypeptide 1B3 were significantly reduced in livers harboring an FXR*1B allele. These findings are the first to identify the presence of a common genetic variant in FXR with functional consequences that could contribute to disease risk or therapeutic outcomes.
Bone tissue contains bile acids which accumulate from serum and which can be released in large amounts in the bone microenvironment during bone resorption. However, the direct effects of bile acids on bone cells remain largely unexplored. Bile acids have been identified as physiological ligands of the farnesoid X receptor (FXR, NR1H4). In the present study, we have examined the effects of FXR activation/inhibition on the osteoblastic differentiation of human bone marrow stromal cells (BMSC). We first demonstrated the expression of FXR in BMSC and SaOS2 osteoblast-like cells, and observed that FXR activation by chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) or by farnesol (FOH) increases the activity of alkaline phosphatase and the calcification of the extracellular matrix. In addition, we observed that FXR agonists are able to stimulate the expression of osteoblast marker genes [bone sialoprotein (BSP), osteocalcin (OC), osteopontin (OPN) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP)] (FXR involvement validated by shRNA-induced gene silencing), as well as the DNA binding activity of the bone transcription factor RUNX2 (EMSA and ChIP assay). Importantly, we observed that nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates (BPs) inhibit the basal osteoblastic differentiation of BMSC, possibly through suppression of endogenous FOH production, independently of their effects on protein prenylation. Likewise, we found that the FXR antagonist guggulsterone (GGS) inhibits ALP activity, calcium deposition, DNA binding of RUNX2, and bone marker expression, indicating that GGS interferes with osteoblastic differentiation. Furthermore, GGS induced the appearance of lipid vesicles in BMSC and stimulated the expression of adipose tissue markers (peroxisome proliferator activated receptor-gamma (PPARγ), adipoQ, leptin and CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein-alpha (C/EBPα)). In conclusion, our data support a new role for FXR in the modulation of osteoblast/adipocyte balance: its activation stimulates RUNX2-mediated osteoblastic differentiation of BMSC, whereas its inhibition leads to an adipocyte-like phenotype.
Maturity-onset diabetes of the young type 3 (MODY3) is caused by haploinsufficiency of hepatocyte nuclear factor-1alpha (encoded by TCF1). Tcf1-/- mice have type 2 diabetes, dwarfism, renal Fanconi syndrome, hepatic dysfunction and hypercholestrolemia. Here we explore the molecular basis for the hypercholesterolemia using oligonucleotide microchip expression analysis. We demonstrate that Tcf1-/- mice have a defect in bile acid transport, increased bile acid and liver cholesterol synthesis, and impaired HDL metabolism. Tcf1-/- liver has decreased expression of the basolateral membrane bile acid transporters Slc10a1, Slc21a3 and Slc21a5, leading to impaired portal bile acid uptake and elevated plasma bile acid concentrations. In intestine and kidneys, Tcf1-/- mice lack expression of the ileal bile acid transporter (Slc10a2), resulting in increased fecal and urinary bile acid excretion. The Tcf1 protein (also known as HNF-1alpha) also regulates transcription of the gene (Nr1h4) encoding the farnesoid X receptor-1 (Fxr-1), thereby leading to reduced expression of small heterodimer partner-1 (Shp-1) and repression of Cyp7a1, the rate-limiting enzyme in the classic bile acid biosynthesis pathway. In addition, hepatocyte bile acid storage protein is absent from Tcf1-/- mice. Increased plasma cholesterol of Tcf1-/- mice resides predominantly in large, buoyant, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) particles. This is most likely due to reduced activity of the HDL-catabolic enzyme hepatic lipase (Lipc) and increased expression of HDL-cholesterol esterifying enzyme lecithin:cholesterol acyl transferase (Lcat). Our studies demonstrate that Tcf1, in addition to being an important regulator of insulin secretion, is an essential transcriptional regulator of bile acid and HDL-cholesterol metabolism.
As nuclear receptors and transcription factors have an important regulatory function in adipocyte differentiation and fat storage, genetic variation in these key regulators and downstream pathways may be involved in the onset of obesity.
To explore associations between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in candidate genes from regulatory pathways that control fatty acid and glucose metabolism, and repeated measurements of body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference in a large Dutch study population.
Data of 327 SNPs across 239 genes were analyzed for 3575 participants of the Doetinchem cohort, who were examined three times during 11 years, using the Illumina Golden Gate assay. Adjusted random coefficient models were used to analyze the relationship between SNPS and obesity phenotypes. False discovery rate q-values were calculated to account for multiple testing. Significance of the associations was defined as a q-value &lt; or = 0.20.
Two SNPs (in NR1H4 and SMARCA2 in women only) were significantly associated with both BMI and waist circumference. In addition, two SNPs (in SIRT1 and SCAP in women only) were associated with BMI alone. A functional SNP, in IL6, was strongly associated with waist.
In this explorative study among participants of a large population-based cohort, five SNPs, mainly located in transcription mediator genes, were strongly associated with obesity phenotypes. The results from whole genome and candidate gene studies support the potential role of NR1H4, SIRT1, SMARCA2 and IL6 in obesity. Although replication of our findings and further research on the functionality of these SNPs and underlying mechanism is necessary, our data indirectly suggest a role of GATA transcription factors in weight control.
Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP) has a complex etiology with a significant genetic component. Heterozygous mutations of canalicular transporters occur in a subset of ICP cases and a population susceptibility allele (p.444A) has been identified in ABCB11. We sought to expand our knowledge of the detailed genetic contribution to ICP by investigation of common variation around candidate loci with biological plausibility for a role in ICP (ABCB4, ABCB11, ABCC2, ATP8B1, NR1H4, and FGF19).
ICP patients (n=563) of white western European origin and controls (n=642) were analyzed in a case-control design. Single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers (n=83) were selected from the HapMap data set (Tagger, Haploview 4.1 (build 22)). Genotyping was performed by allelic discrimination assay on a robotic platform. Following quality control, SNP data were analyzed by Armitage's trend test.
Cochran-Armitage trend testing identified six SNPs in ABCB11 together with six SNPs in ABCB4 that showed significant evidence of association. The minimum Bonferroni corrected P value for trend testing ABCB11 was 5.81×10(-4) (rs3815676) and for ABCB4 it was 4.6×10(-7)(rs2109505). Conditional analysis of the two clusters of association signals suggested a single signal in ABCB4 but evidence for two independent signals in ABCB11. To confirm these findings, a second study was performed in a further 227 cases, which confirmed and strengthened the original findings.
Our analysis of a large cohort of ICP cases has identified a key role for common variation around the ABCB4 and ABCB11 loci, identified the core associations, and expanded our knowledge of ICP susceptibility.
Increased consumption of folic acid is prevalent, leading to concerns about negative consequences. The effects of folic acid on the liver, the primary organ for folate metabolism, are largely unknown. Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) provides methyl donors for S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) synthesis and methylation reactions.
Our goal was to investigate the impact of high folic acid intake on liver disease and methyl metabolism.
Folic acid-supplemented diet (FASD, 10-fold higher than recommended) and control diet were fed to male Mthfr(+/+) and Mthfr(+/-) mice for 6 mo to assess gene-nutrient interactions. Liver pathology, folate and choline metabolites, and gene expression in folate and lipid pathways were examined.
Liver and spleen weights were higher and hematologic profiles were altered in FASD-fed mice. Liver histology revealed unusually large, degenerating cells in FASD Mthfr(+/-) mice, consistent with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. High folic acid inhibited MTHFR activity in vitro, and MTHFR protein was reduced in FASD-fed mice. 5-Methyltetrahydrofolate, SAM, and SAM/S-adenosylhomocysteine ratios were lower in FASD and Mthfr(+/-) livers. Choline metabolites, including phosphatidylcholine, were reduced due to genotype and/or diet in an attempt to restore methylation capacity through choline/betaine-dependent SAM synthesis. Expression changes in genes of one-carbon and lipid metabolism were particularly significant in FASD Mthfr(+/-) mice. The latter changes, which included higher nuclear sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1, higher Srepb2 messenger RNA (mRNA), lower farnesoid X receptor (Nr1h4) mRNA, and lower Cyp7a1 mRNA, would lead to greater lipogenesis and reduced cholesterol catabolism into bile.
We suggest that high folic acid consumption reduces MTHFR protein and activity levels, creating a pseudo-MTHFR deficiency. This deficiency results in hepatocyte degeneration, suggesting a 2-hit mechanism whereby mutant hepatocytes cannot accommodate the lipid disturbances and altered membrane integrity arising from changes in phospholipid/lipid metabolism. These preliminary findings may have clinical implications for individuals consuming high-dose folic acid supplements, particularly those who are MTHFR deficient.
Objective Sinus tachycardia is frequently reported in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), while there are limited data on post-exercise ability to slow heart rate (i.e. heart rate recovery, HRR) in this group of patients. Methods We studied consecutive 70 patients with SLE and 30 healthy controls. All examined individuals underwent detailed clinical examination, echocardiography, Holter monitoring with heart rate variability and treadmill stress test using Bruce's protocol. HRR values were calculated as the difference between maximum HR during exercise and HR at the first (HRR1) and third (HRR3) minute of rest. Individuals with coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus and suspected pulmonary hypertension were excluded from further analysis ( n = 15). Results Fifty-five SLE patients were eligible for this study: aged 41.5 ± 12.4 years, 87.3% women, SLICC/ACR-DI score 3.58 ± 1.85. In the SLE group 36.4% patients received beta-blockers, usually for previously detected sinus tachycardia and/or arterial hypertension. Mean HRR1 (36.9 ± 12.6 vs 49.5 ± 18.6, p = 0.0004) and HRR3 (55.5 ± 14.3 vs 69.2 ± 16.4, p = 0.0001) were significantly lower in SLE than in healthy individuals. Significantly negative correlations between SLICC/ACR-DI score and HRR1 ( r = -0.299, p = 0.01), HRR3 ( r = -0.361, p = 0.001) and exercise capacity ( r = -0.422, p &lt; 0.0001) were revealed. Additionally, beta-blocker treatment was also revealed to alter significantly HRR1, HRR3 and exercise capacity in SLE. Conclusion Patients with SLE are characterized by attenuated HRR after exercise. In our study impaired HRR was associated with disease severity and beta-blocker treatment and probably with disease duration. The use of HRR assessment in SLE can be used as an additional marker of cardiac autonomic nervous system dysfunction.
To determine if in-season changes in heart rate recovery (HRR) are related to aerobic fitness and performance in collegiate rowers. Twenty-two female collegiate rowers completed testing before and after their competitive season. Body fat percentage (BF%) was determined by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Maximal aerobic capacity (VO2max ) and time to exhaustion (Tmax ) were determined during maximal rowing ergometer testing followed by 1 minute of recovery. HRR was expressed absolutely and as a percentage of maximal HR (HRR%1 min ). Variables were compared using paired Wilcoxon tests. Multivariable regression models were used to predict in-season changes in HRR using changes in VO2max and Tmax , while accounting for changes in BF%. From preseason to post-season, VO2max and BF% decreased (3.98±0.42 vs 3.78±0.35 L/min, P=.002 and 23.8±3.4 vs 21.3±3.9%, P&lt;.001, respectively), while Tmax increased (11.7±1.3 vs 12.6±1.3 min, P=.002), and HRR%1 min increased (11.1±2.7 vs 13.8±3.8, P=.001). In-season changes in VO2max were not associated with HRR%1 min (P&gt;.05). In-season changes in Tmax were related to changes in HRR%1 min (β=-1.67, P=.006). In-season changes in BF% were not related to changes in HRR (P&gt;.05 for all). HRR1 min and HRR%1 min were faster preseason to post-season, although the changes were unrelated to VO2max . Faster HRR%1 min post-season was inversely related to changes in Tmax . This suggests that HRR should not be used as a measure of aerobic capacity in collegiate rowers, but is a promising measure of training status in this population.
The study was designed to observe the effects and relationship of exercise on chronotropic response (CR) and exercise capacity in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). A total of 30 patients with T2DM underwent symptom-limited cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) after excluding contraindication. For each subject individualized exercise prescription was formulated, and they received 12 weeks of exercise training after CPET retest to complete the comparison of CR indicators, including the ratio of maximum exercise heart rate to predicted maximum heart rate value (rHR), heart rate reserve rate (HRRes), heart rate recovery (HRR) of 1-6 min after exercise termination (HRR1-6), exercise capacity (peak VO2/kg) and other indicators. The results showed that after 12 weeks of exercise treatment, rHR, HRRes, HRR1-6, and peak VO2/kg were significantly higher than before (P&lt;0.05), with peak VO2/kg being positively correlated to rHR and HRRes (P&lt;0.01). In conclusion, exercise training can improve cardiac dysfunction, abnormal HRR, enhance exercise capacity and adaptability of the cardiovascular system to exercise stress in T2DM patients.
The purpose of this study was to examine the association of free-living, objectively-measured physical activity on treadmill-based heart rate recovery (HRR), a parameter known to associate with morbidity and mortality. Data was used from 2003 to 2004 NHANES. Physical activity was assessed via accelerometry, with HRR recovery assessed from a treadmill-based test. Heart rate recovery minute 1 (HRR1) and minute 2 (HRR2) were calculated. After adjustment, light and vigorous-intensity free-living physical activity, respectively, were associated with HRR1 (βadjusted = 0.69, 95% CI 0.22-1.14; βadjusted 1.94, 95% CI 0.01-3.9) and HRR2 (βadjusted = 0.99, 95% CI 0.35-1.62; βadjusted = 5.88, 95% CI 2.63-9.12). Moderate physical activity was not associated with HRR1 (βadjusted = 0.60, 95% CI -0.41 to 1.62), but was with HRR2 (βadjusted = 2.28, 95% CI 1.27-3.28). As free-living physical activity intensity increased, there was a greater association with HRR. This finding may provide mechanistic insight of previous research observations demonstrating intensity-specific effects of physical activity on various health outcomes.
Abnormalities of autonomic function have been reported in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Our objectives were to identify determinants of abnormal heart rate recovery at 1 min (HRR1) following completion of the 6-min walk test (6MWT) in COPD and to establish whether abnormal HRR1 predicts acute exacerbations (AECOPD).
Hundred one COPD patients (FEV1 (SD) 53 (19)  % predicted) were prospectively recruited in a multi-center study. HRR1 after the 6MWT was evaluated as the difference between heart rate at the end of the test and 1 min into the recovery (HRR1). Linear and logistic regression was used to identify predictors of HRR1 and AECOPD, respectively. The best HRR1 cut-off point to predict AECOPD was selected using the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curves. The follow-up period was 12 months.
Distance covered during the 6MWT (m) and DLco (% predicted) were independently associated with HRR1 (r 2 = 0.51, p = 0.001). Among several potential covariates, HRR1 emerged as the most significant predictor of AECOPD (Odds ratio [OR], 0.91 per beat of recovery; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.85-0.97; p = 0.02). The ROC analysis indicated that subjects with HRR1 less than 14 beats (AUC, 0.71 [CI] 0.60-0.80; p = 0.0001) were more likely to suffer an exacerbation during the follow-up period (for HRR1, p = 0.004 [log-rank test]).
HRR1 after the 6MWT is an independent predictor factor for AECOPD. Further studies are warranted to examine the physiological mechanisms associating a delayed HRR and acute exacerbations in COPD patients.
An efficient cardiac rehabilitation programme (CRP) can improve the functional ability of patients after acute coronary syndrome (ACS).
To examine the effect of a CRP on parasympathetic reactivation and heart rate recovery (HRR) measured after a 6-min walk test (6MWT), and correlation with 6MWT distance and well-being after ACS.
Eleven normoweight patients after ACS (BMI&lt;25kg/m2; 10 males; mean [SD] age 61 [9] years) underwent an 8-week CRP. Before (pre-) and at weeks 4 (W4) and 8 (W8) during the CRP, they performed a 6MWT on a treadmill, followed by 10-min of seated passive recovery, with HRR and HR variability (HRV) recordings. HRR was measured at 1, 3, 5 and 10min after the 6MWT (HRR1, HRR3, HRR5, HRR10), then modelized by a mono-exponential function. Time-domain (square root of the mean of the sum of the squares of differences between adjacent normal R-R intervals [RMSSD]) and frequency-domain (with high- and low-frequency band powers) were used to analyse HRV. Participants completed a mental and physical well-being questionnaire at pre- and W8. Exhaustion after tests was assessed by the Borg scale. Pearson correlation was used to assess correlations.
HRR3, HRR5 and HRR10 increased by 37%, 36% and 28%, respectively, between pre- and W8 (P&lt;0.05), and were positively correlated with change in 6MWT distance (r=0.58, 0.66 and 0.76; P&lt;0.05). Percentage change in HRR3 was positively correlated with change in well-being (r=0.70; P=0.01). Parasympathic reactivation (RMSSD) was improved only during the first 30sec of recovery (P=0.04).
Among patients undergoing a CRP after ACS, increased HRR after a 6MWT, especially at 3min, was positively correlated with 6MWT distance and improved well-being. HRR raw data seem more sensitive than post-exercise HRV analysis for monitoring functional and autonomic improvement after ACS.
Objective Although carotid artery stenting (CAS) is an effective treatment for severe carotid stenosis, it has been associated with alterations in autonomic functions long term after the procedure. Patients with CAS have been reported to have autonomic nervous system (ANS) dysfunction. This study aimed to evaluate heart rate recovery (HRR) indices and exercise test parameters after CAS. Methods Patients (10 male, 11 female) suitable for CAS, without a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, severe coronary artery or valvular heart disease, were enrolled in our study. Basal electrocardiography, echocardiography, and treadmill exercise testing were performed in all patients pre- and post-procedure. The HRR index was defined as the reduction in the heart rate from the rate at peak exercise to the rate first minute (HRR1), second minute (HRR2), third minute (HRR3) and fifth minute (HRR5) after the cessation of exercise stress testing. Results The exercise time, maximal heart rate, maximal blood pressure and maximal metabolic equivalents values were significantly decreased after the procedure. The first- and second-minute HRR indices of patients before procedure were significantly lower than after procedure (23.5 ± 6.6 vs 25.8 ± 8.3; p &lt; 0.001 and 41.8 ± 12.3 vs 50.2 ± 16.3; p &lt; 0.001, respectively). Similarly, HRR indices after the third and fifth minutes of the recovery period were significantly lower in patients before procedure, when compared with those indices after procedure (52.9 ± 13.1 vs 60.7 ± 14.4; p &lt; 0.001 and 62.4 ± 12.8 vs 71.9 ± 14.1; p &lt; 0.001). Conclusion We have demonstrated that HRR indices increased in the first, second, third and fifth minutes of the recovery period after maximal exercise testing in patients after the CAS procedure, which may be a reflection of parasympathetic dominance after CAS.
The 6-min walk test (6MWT) is commonly performed to assess functional status in patients with chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension. However, changes in heart rate and oxygen saturation (SpO2 ) patterns during 6MWT in patients with chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension remain unclear.
Thirty-one subjects with chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension were retrospectively evaluated to examine the relationships between the change in heart rate (Δheart rate), heart rate acceleration time, slope of heart rate acceleration, heart rate recovery during the first minute after 6MWT (HRR1), change in SpO2 (ΔSpO2 ), SpO2 reduction time, and SpO2 recovery time during 6MWT, and the severity of pulmonary hemodynamics assessed by right heart catheterization and echocardiography.
Subjects with severe chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension had significantly longer heart rate acceleration time (144.9 ± 63.9 s vs 96.0 ± 42.5 s, P = .033), lower Δheart rate (47.4 ± 16.9 vs 61.8 ± 13.6 beats, P = .02), and lower HRR1 (13.3 ± 9.0 beats vs 27.1 ± 9.2 beats, P &lt; .001) compared to subjects with mild chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension. Subjects with severe chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension also had significantly longer SpO2 reduction time (178.3 ± 70.3 s vs 134.3 ± 58.4 s, P = .03) and SpO2 recovery time (107.6 ± 35.3 s vs 69.8 ± 32.7 s, P = .004) than did subjects with mild chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension. Multivariate linear regression analysis showed only mean pulmonary arterial pressure independently was associated with heart rate acceleration time and slope of heart rate acceleration.
Heart rate and SpO2 change patterns during 6MWT are predominantly associated with pulmonary hemodynamics in subjects with chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension. Evaluating heart rate and SpO2 change patterns during 6MWT may serve as a safe and convenient way to follow the change in pulmonary hemodynamics.
Erectile dysfunction (ED) and cardiovascular (CV) diseases share common risk factors and ED has been accepted as an early manifestation of CV disease. Exercise stress testing (EST) is used to evaluate CV functions in men with ED. Low exercise workload, a slower heart rate recovery (HRR) after exercise, and inability to increase heart rate during EST (chronotropic incompetence) are independent negative predictors of adverse CV outcomes.
To assess the association among EST parameters, ED, and testosterone levels.
The study population consisted of 41 patients with ED and 40 controls. All participants underwent treadmill EST to assess cardiac autonomic functions. HRR indices were calculated by subtracting 1st (HRR1), 2nd (HRR2), and 3rd (HRR3) minute heart rates during the recovery period from maximal heart rate. Total exercise duration, exercise capacity and chronotropic response, and plasma testosterone levels were evaluated. Erectile functions were evaluated with the Sexual Health Inventory for Men. Patients were divided into subgroups according to severity and duration of ED.
Mean HRR1 (30.6 ± 11.9 vs 36.9 ± 9.9; P = .01), HRR2 (44.9 ± 12.4 vs 54.9 ± 7.8; P &lt; .001), and HRR3 (50.1 ± 11.7 vs 63.0 ± 7.9; P &lt; .001) were significantly lower in the ED than in the control group. Total exercise duration (9.4 ± 1.9 vs 10.9 ± 1.7 minutes; P &lt; .001), exercise capacity (12.5 ± 1.9 vs 13.6 ± 1.4 metabolic equivalents; P = .004), and chronotropic response (0.88 ± 0.1 vs 1.0 ± 0.1; P &lt; .001) were worse in the ED group. However, we found no association between severity and duration of ED and EST parameters. In addition, serum testosterone levels were significantly correlated with HRR1 (r = 0.36, P = .02) in men with ED.
Our data suggested that cardiac autonomic functions are impaired in patients with ED. A weak correlation between cardiac autonomic dysfunction and low testosterone levels in patients with ED was noted. However, further studies are needed to elucidate the prognostic significance and clinical implications of impaired autonomic functions and testosterone replacement therapy in patients with ED.

Clozapine remains the only evidence-based treatment for treatment-resistant schizophrenia, and prediction of clozapine response is important in developing stratified treatment. We studied potential predictors of clozapine response, applying functional assessments as well as service use.
We performed a nationwide cohort study among all individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia in Denmark after 1995 (age, ≥18 years) who initiated clozapine treatment between 2004 and 2011 with a Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF-F) score registered at clozapine initiation. During up to 2-year follow-up, clinical response was defined as (a) no further hospitalization with schizophrenia or (b) improvement in GAF-F score (moderate improvement: increase, ≥10; substantial improvement: increase, ≥20; and GAF-F, ≥50). We performed Cox regression analysis and report adjusted hazard rate ratios (HRRs; 95% confidence intervals [95% CIs]).
Among 502 clozapine users with a registered GAF-F score, 232 (46.2%) remained out of hospital, 96 (19.1%) achieved moderate functional improvement, and 29 (5.8%) substantial functional improvement. Of all potential predictors, voluntary status at clozapine initiation showed borderline statistical significance with nonhospitalization (HRR, 1.61; 95% CI, 0.97-2.67). Regarding functional improvement, living with a partner was the strongest predictor with an almost threefold increased HRR (2.78; 95% CI, 1.07-7.23). Female sex was only nonsignificantly associated with functional improvement, whereas the chance of substantial improvement decreased by 15% (HRR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.72-1.00) for each year delay in clozapine initiation among females.
Living with a partner was the strongest predictor of functioning after clozapine initiation in this study. Although potentially indicating better premorbid functioning, this finding stresses the need and importance of social support during the course of the treatment independent of clinical factors.
In Spain, anti-pneumococcal vaccination is recommended for all children under 2 years old, high-risk groups and adults ≥65 years old. However, it is not funded in most autonomous communities. This study aims to compare pneumococcal disease hospitalisation rates between Period 1 (2007-2009), when 7-valent (PCV7) vaccine was available, and Period 2 (2011-2013), after the change to 13-valent (PCV13) vaccine in Spain. Data on hospitalisations were obtained from the National Registry of Hospitalisations. We calculated hospitalisation rates (HRs) and hospitalisation rate ratios (HRRs) among periods by age group and autonomous community, for all and by clinical presentation. From 138,361 patients hospitalised, 83,528 (60.4 %) were males. The median age was 73.8 years. The most common clinical presentation was pneumonia (133,204 hospitalisations; 96.3 %), followed by septicaemia (7053 hospitalisations; 5.1 %) and meningitis (3182 hospitalisations; 2.3 %). In Period 2, hospitalisations among children &lt;5 years old decreased for pneumonia [HRR: 0.37; 95 % confidence interval (95 % CI): 0.35 to 0.39] and meningitis (HRR: 0.53; 95 % CI: 0.44 to 0.65). For adults ≥65 years old, pneumonia (HRR: 0.49; 95 % CI: 0.49 to 0.50) and peritonitis (HRR: 0.34; 95 % CI: 0.19 to 0.63) hospitalisations decreased and septicaemia hospitalisations (HRR: 1.27; 95 % CI: 1.18 to 1.36) increased. Significant changes in HRs for pneumococcal disease were observed even without an integrated and continuous vaccination programme after the introduction of PCV13, especially in children &lt;5 years old and for pneumonia. The impact of the PCV13 adult vaccination new recommendations on the septicaemia increase reported should be evaluated in the future.
Accumulated moderate physical activity (PA) for 30 min in a day is the only recommended treatment of prehypertension.
We investigated autonomic modulation as a possible mechanism for the decrease in blood pressure (BP) during the rest periods in each 10 min session of PA.
We conducted a single-blind randomized multi-arm control trial on 40 prehypertensive (pre-HT) young male adults.
Participants were randomly divided by using random number table into four groups. Control (no intervention); Group 1 (walking at 50% of predicted VO2 peak); Group 2 (walking at 60% of predicted VO2 peak); Group 3 (walking at 70% of predicted VO2 peak). BP, heart rate variability (HRV), and heart rate recovery 1 min (HRR 1 min) were measured at baseline and during the rest period after each session of 10 min over 30 min of accumulated physical activity (PAcumm).
Significant diastolic BP (DBP) reduction (P &lt; 0.001) was observed during the rest period after each session of PAcumm in intervention groups. An average reduction in DBP was more in pre-HT undertaking PAcumm at 70% of predicted VO2 Peak. Decrease in the mean value of low-frequency (LF) and LF/high-frequency ratio was observed following PAcumm in all intervention groups irrespective of the intensity of PA. No significant association of reduction of BP with HRV and HRR 1 s was observed.
Reduction in BP was observed during the rest period after each 10 min session of PAcumm irrespective of the intensity of PA. Autonomic modulation does not seem to be the possible mechanism for the reduction in BP during the sessions.
Maternal smoking has consistently been associated with multiple adverse childhood outcomes including externalizing disorders. In contrast the association between maternal smoking during pregnancy (MSDP) and internalizing (anxiety and depressive) disorders in offspring has received less investigation.
We conducted a nationwide cohort study including 957635 individuals born in Denmark between 1991 and 2007. Data on MSDP and diagnoses of depression or anxiety disorders were derived from national registers and patients were followed up from the age of 5 years to the end of 2012. Hazard rate ratios (HRRs) were estimated using stratified Cox regression models. Sibling data were used to disentangle individual- and familial-level effects of MSDP and to control for unmeasured familial confounding.
At the population level, offspring exposed to MSDP were at increased risk for both severe depression [HRR 1.29, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.22-1.36] and severe anxiety disorders (HRR 1.26, 95% CI 1.20-1.32) even when controlling for maternal and paternal traits. However, there was no association between MSDP and internalizing disorders when controlling for the mother's propensity for MSDP (depression: HRR 1.11, 95% CI 0.94-1.30; anxiety disorders: HRR 0.94, 95% CI 0.80-1.11) or comparing differentially exposed siblings (depression: HRR 1.18, 95% CI 0.75-1.89; anxiety disorders: HRR 0.87, 95% CI 0.55-1.36).
The results suggest that familial background factors account for the association between MSDP and severe internalizing disorders not the specific exposure to MSDP.
Heart rate recovery after 1 min of exercise cessation (HRR-1) is an important prognostic factor in patients with cardiovascular disease (CVD). We aimed to further elucidate the association between HRR-1 and known psychosocial risk factors in patients referred for comprehensive cardiac rehabilitation. We examined 521 patients with coronary heart disease in the first week of an outpatient cardiac rehabilitation program. Depressive and anxiety symptoms were measured with the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, and positive (PA) and negative affect were rated with the Global Mood Scale. Depressive symptoms showed a significant inverse relationship with HRR-1 (p &lt; .05), controlling for sociodemographic and medical covariates, whereas anxiety symptoms did not show a significant association. PA made a significant contribution to HRR-1 as well (p &lt; .05). Our findings suggest an independent association between HRR-1 and psychosocial risk factors of CVD.
Sepsis is the leading noncardiac cause of intensive care unit (ICU) death. Pre-ICU admission site may be associated with mortality of ICU patients with sepsis. This study quantifies mortality differences among patients with sepsis admitted to an ICU from a hospital ward, emergency department (ED), or an operating room (OR).
We conducted a retrospective cohort study of 1762 adults with sepsis using ICU record data obtained from a clinical database of an academic medical center. Survival analysis provided crude and adjusted hazard rate ratio (HRR) estimates comparing hospital mortality among patients from hospital wards, EDs, and ORs, adjusted for age, sex, and severity of illness.
Mortality of patients with sepsis differed based on the pre-ICU admission site. Compared to patients admitted from an ED, patients admitted from hospital wards had higher mortality (HRR: 1.35; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.09-1.68) and those admitted from an OR had lower mortality (HRR: 0.37; 95% CI: 0.23-0.58).
Patients with sepsis admitted to an ICU from a hospital ward experienced greater mortality than patients with sepsis admitted to an ICU from an ED. These findings indicate that there may be systematic differences in the selection of patient care locations, recognition, and management of patients with sepsis that warrant further investigation.
One challenge of intensive pig production is tail damage caused by tail biting, and farmers often decrease the prevalence of tail damage through tail docking. However, tail docking is not an optimal preventive measure against tail damage and thus, it would be preferable to replace it. The aim of the current study was to investigate the relative effect of three possible preventive measures against tail damage. The study included 112 pens with 1624 finisher pigs divided between four batches. Pens were randomly assigned to one level of each of three treatments: (1) tail-docked (n=60 pens) v. undocked (n=52 pens), (2) 150 g of straw provided per pig per day on the solid floor (n=56 pens) v. no straw provided (n=56 pens), (3) stocking density of 1.21 m2/pig (11 pig/pen; n=56 pens) v. 0.73 m2/pig (18 pigs/pen; n=56 pens). Tail damage was recorded three times per week throughout the finisher period by scoring the tail of each individual pig. A pen was recorded as a tail damage pen and no longer included in the study if at least one pig in a pen had a bleeding tail wound; thus, only the first incidence of tail damage on pen level was recorded. Data were analysed by a Cox regression for survival analysis assuming proportional hazards. Results are presented as hazards, and a higher hazard means that a pen has a higher risk of tail damage and of it happening earlier in the finisher period. Pens with undocked pigs had a 4.32-fold higher hazard of tail damage compared with pens with docked pigs (P&lt;0.001). Pens with no straw provided had a 2.22-fold higher hazard of tail damage compared with pens with straw provided (P&lt;0.01). No interactions was seen between the treatments, but the effect of tail docking was higher than the effect of straw provision (P&lt;0.001). Stocking density did not have a significant effect on the hazard of tail damage (hazard rate ratios (HRR)=1.67; P=0.064). However, a combination of straw provision and lowered stocking density showed a similar hazard of tail damage as seen with only tail docking (HRR=1.58; P=0.39). In conclusion, tail docking and straw provision were preventive measures against tail damage, and tail docking reduced the risk more than straw provision. A combination of other preventive measures is necessary to reduce the risk of tail damage in undocked pigs to the same level as in docked pigs.
Bosentan is well known to induce cholestatic liver toxicity in humans. The present study was set up to characterize the hepatotoxic effects of this drug at the transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomic levels. For this purpose, human hepatoma-derived HepaRG cells were exposed to a number of concentrations of bosentan during different periods of time. Bosentan was found to functionally and transcriptionally suppress the bile salt export pump as well as to alter bile acid levels. Pathway analysis of both transcriptomics and proteomics data identified cholestasis as a major toxicological event. Transcriptomics results further showed several gene changes related to the activation of the nuclear farnesoid X receptor. Induction of oxidative stress and inflammation were also observed. Metabolomics analysis indicated changes in the abundance of specific endogenous metabolites related to mitochondrial impairment. The outcome of this study may assist in the further optimization of adverse outcome pathway constructs that mechanistically describe the processes involved in cholestatic liver injury.
Biliary acute pancreatitis (AP) is a serious condition, which currently has no specific treatment. Taurolithocholic acid 3-sulfate (TLC-S) is one of the most potent bile acids causing cytosolic Ca2+ overload in pancreatic acinar cells (PACs), which results in premature activation of digestive enzymes and necrosis, hallmarks of AP. The inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (IP3R) and the ryanodine receptor (RyR) play major roles in intracellular Ca2+ signaling. Inhibition of these endoplasmic reticulum-located channels suppresses TLC-S-induced Ca2+ release and necrosis, decreasing the severity of AP. Anti-apoptotic B-cell lymphoma (Bcl)-2-family members, such as Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL, have emerged as important modulators of IP3Rs and RyRs. These proteins contain four Bcl-2 homology (BH) domains of which the N-terminal BH4 domain exerts critical roles in regulating intracellular Ca2+ release channels. The BH4 domain of Bcl-2, but not of Bcl-XL, binds to and inhibits IP3Rs, whereas both BH4 domains inhibit RyRs. Although clear cytoprotective effects have been reported for these BH4 domains, it remains unclear whether they are capable of inhibiting pathological Ca2+-overload, associated with AP. Here we demonstrate in PACs that the BH4 domains of Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL inhibit RyR activity in response to the physiological agonist cholecystokinin. In addition, these BH4 domains inhibit pathophysiological TLC-S-induced Ca2+ overload in PACs via RyR inhibition, which in turn protects these cells from TLC-S-induced necrosis. This study shows for the first time the therapeutic potential of BH4 domain function by inhibiting pathological RyR-mediated Ca2+ release and necrosis, events that trigger AP.
While bile acids are important for both digestion and signaling, hydrophobic bile acids can be harmful especially when in high concentrations. Mechanisms for protection of cholangiocytes against bile acid cytotoxicity include negative feedback loops via farnesoid X nuclear receptor (FXR) activation, the bicarbonate umbrella, cholehepatic shunting and anti-inflammatory signaling, among others. By altering or overwhelming these defense mechanisms, cholestatic diseases such as primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) and primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) can further progress to biliary cirrhosis, end-stage liver disease and death or liver transplantation. While PBC is currently treated with ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) and obeticholic acid (OCA), many fail treatment, and we have yet to find an effective therapy for PSC. Novel therapies under evaluation target nuclear and surface receptors including FXR, Trans-membrane G-protein coupled receptor 5 (TGR5), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR), and pregnane X receptor (PXR). Modulation of these receptors leads to altered bile composition, decreased cytotoxicity, decreased inflammation, and improved metabolism. This review summarizes our current understanding of the role of bile acids in the pathophysiology of cholestatic liver diseases, presents the rationale for already approved medical therapies, and discusses novel pharmacologic therapies under investigation.

The aim of this study was to determine the effects of Lactobacillus plantarum YS-3 (LP-YS3) on activated carbon-induced constipation in Kunming mice. The results of the experiment show that the antigastric acid activity and bile salt tolerance of LP-YS3 were stronger than those of Lactobacillus bulgaricus (LB). LP-YS3 inhibited loss of body weight caused by constipation and further reductions in fecal weight, particle number, and water content in mice. Moreover, LP-YS3 elevated the gastrointestinal transit rate and reduced the time required for initial black stool defecation. LP-YS3 also elevated motilin (MTL), endothelin (ET), acetylcholinesterase (AChE), substance P (SP), and VIP serum levels and reduced somatostatin (SS) levels in constipated mice. Hematoxylin-eosin (H&amp;E) staining revealed that high concentration of LP-YS3 reduced the incidence of injuries to small intestine villi and the intestinal wall compared to carbon-induced constipation groups. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and western blot experiments demonstrated that LP-YS3 upregulated c-Kit, stem cell factor, and glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor mRNA and protein expression and downregulated transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 and nitric oxide synthase expression in small intestine tissue from constipated mice. In conclusion, high concentrations of LP-YS3 had stronger and more beneficial effects than LB. Based on these results, we conclude that LP-YS3 can effectively inhibit constipation.
Hepatitis B virus (HBV) constitutes a significant public health burden, and currently available treatment options are not generally curative, necessitating the development of new therapeutics. Here we have applied random non-standard peptide integrated discovery (RaPID) screening to identify small macrocyclic peptide inhibitors of HBV entry that target the cell-surface receptor for HBV, sodium taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide (NTCP). In addition to their anti-HBV activity, these molecules also inhibit cellular entry by the related hepatitis D virus (HDV), and are active against diverse strains of HBV (including clinically relevant nucleos(t)ide analog-resistant and vaccine escaping strains). Importantly, these macrocyclic peptides, in contrast to other NTCP-binding HBV entry inhibitors, exhibited no inhibition of NTCP-mediated bile acid uptake, making them appealing candidates for therapeutic development.
TGR5 (also known as G protein-coupled bile acid receptor 1, GPBAR1) is a G protein-coupled bile acid receptor that is expressed in many diverse tissues. TGR5 is involved in various metabolic processes, including glucose metabolism and energy expenditure; however, TGR5's function in skeletal muscle is not fully understood. Using both gain- and loss-of-function mouse models, we demonstrate here that Tgr5 activation promotes muscle cell differentiation and muscle hypertrophy. Both young and old transgenic mice with muscle-specific Tgr5 expression exhibited increased muscle strength. Moreover, we found that Tgr5 expression is increased by the unfolded protein response (UPR), which is an adaptive response required for maintenance of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) homeostasis. Both ER stress response element (ERSE)- and unfolded protein response element (UPRE)-like sites are present in the 5' upstream region of the Tgr5 gene promoter and are essential for Tgr5 expression by activating transcription factor 6α (Atf6α), a well-known UPR-activated transcriptional regulator. We observed that in the skeletal muscle of mice, exercise-induced UPR increases Tgr5 expression, an effect that was abrogated in Atf6α KO mice, indicating that Atf6α is essential for this response. These findings indicate that the bile acid receptor Tgr5 contributes to improved muscle function and provide an additional explanation for the beneficial effects of exercise on skeletal muscle activity.
Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery (RYGB) remains one of the most effective treatments for obesity and type 2 diabetes. Despite this, the mechanisms through which it acts are still not well understood. Bile acid signaling through the transmembrane G-protein-coupled receptor TGR5 has been shown to have significant effects on metabolism and has recently been reported to be necessary for the full effects of vertical sleeve gastrectomy (VSG), a bariatric surgery with similar effects to RYGB. The goal of the current study is therefore to investigate the role of bile acid signaling through TGR5 to see if it is necessary to obtain the full effects of RYGB.
High-fat diet-induced obese TGR5-/- and wildtype mice (WT) were subjected to RYGB, sham surgery, or weight matching (WM) to RYGB mice via caloric restriction. Body weight, body composition, food intake, energy expenditure, glucose tolerance, insulin sensitivity, and liver weight were measured.
Although the difference in fat mass 20 weeks after surgery between RYGB and sham-operated mice was slightly reduced in TGR5-/- mice when compared to wildtype mice, loss of body weight and fat mass from preoperative levels, reduction of food intake, increase of energy expenditure, and improvement in glycemic control were similar in the two genotypes. Furthermore, improvements in glycemic control were similar in non-surgical mice weight-matched to RYGB.
We conclude that bile acid signaling through TGR5 is not required for the beneficial effects of RYGB in the mouse and that RYGB and VSG may achieve their similar beneficial effects through different mechanisms.
Fasiglifam is an orally available and selective partial agonist of hGPR40 receptor, which was unexpectedly terminated at phase III clinical trials due to its severe hepatotoxicity. To fully understand its mechanism of action, it is necessary to investigate the in vitro and in vivo metabolic profiles of fasiglifam.
For in vitro metabolism, fasiglifam was incubated with rat or human liver microsomes in the presence of NADPH, GSH and UDPGA for 60 min. For in vivo metabolism, fasiglifam was orally administered to rats at a single dose of 20 mg/kg and the bile was collected. In vitro and in vivo samples were analyzed by the developed UHPLC-Q Exactive Orbitrap-MS. The structures of metabolites were proposed according to their accurate masses and fragment ions.
A total of 8 metabolites, including an acyl-GSH adduct, were detected and identified. M1 (acylglucuronide) and M5 (carboxylic acid derivative) were the major metabolites of fasiglifam. Metabolic pathways of fasiglifam involved oxygenation, oxidative dealkylation, dehydrogenation, glucuronidation and GSH conjugation. Fasiglifam may undergo metabolic bioactivation via acylglucuronide.
Oxidative dealkylation and glucuronidation were the predominant metabolic pathways of fasiglifam in vitro and in vivo. Metabolic bioactivation via acylglucuronide may be the perpetrator of its hepatotoxicity. Our findings would be helpful in understanding the disposition of fasiglifam as well as its hepatotoxicity.
The hepatitis B virus (HBV) is predominantly a hepatotropic virus but also infects cells of the lymphatic system. HBV genomes (DNA, messenger (m)RNA, covalently closed circular (ccc) DNA) and proteins have been found in extrahepatic sites such as peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), lymph nodes, spleen, bone marrow and cerebrospinal fluid. HBV entry into hepatocytes occurs by binding of the HBV preS1 surface protein to its specific receptor, the bile acid transporter, sodium taurocholate co-transporting polypeptide (NTCP). Although the mechanism of HBV entry into lymphatic cells is unknown, the pre S1 encoded surface protein is thought to be involved. Extrahepatic HBV infection has been studied in both chronic HBV (CHB) and in occult HBV infection (OBI). Studies have shown that HBV genomes are present in different PBMC subsets from chronically infected carriers. Unique HBV variants have been found in PBMC compared to plasma or liver in both nucleos(t)ide analogue (NA) treated and untreated CHB carriers, suggesting replication and compartment specific evolution of HBV. In HBV coinfection, HBV genomes were found in PBMC from hepatitis C virus (HCV), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis delta virus (HDV) co-infected individuals. Moreover, during pregnancy, the trans placental passage of HBV infected PBMC from highly viremic mothers to infants is one of the postulated means of vertical transmission of HBV. Taken together, HBV infection in extrahepatic sites (i.e., PBMC) is implicated in multiple facets of HBV pathogenesis such as persistence, viral evolution and vertical transmission.
There are few large-scale studies on the utility of peripheral dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (pDXA) in children. As central dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (cDXA) equipment is not commonly available in the developing world, we assessed the correlation of bone mineral density (BMD) with cDXA and pDXA in children to determine the optimal Z-score thresholds of pDXA for predicting two predefined Z-score cutoffs (≤-1, ≤-2) of cDXA in 844 subjects (441 boys, 403 girls) aged 10-18 years. The BMD of antero-posterior lumbar spine (L1-L4), proximal femur and forearm was measured by cDXA, while the peripheral BMD of forearm and calcaneus was estimated using pDXA. The correlation was statistically significant at all sites (p&lt;0.01). The coefficients ranged from 0.56 to 0.79 in boys and 0.17 to 0.32 in girls. A significant positive correlation was observed between BMD by pDXA and cDXA in Indian children, with a strong gender difference in both the extent of correlation and the ability of peripheral BMD to predict central BMD.
Interferon regulatory factor 2 (IRF-2) is a multi-functional transcription factor in the IRF family exhibiting both transcriptional activating and repressing activities. In this study, an IRF-2 gene (HcIRF-2) from Hyriopsis cumingii was identified and characterized. The cDNA sequence consisted of 2688 bp, encoding a 329 amino acid-protein. The amino acid sequence had a highly conserved N-terminal DBD structure, containing characteristic repeats of six tryptophan residues. The 5'-flanking region contained several transcription regulation elements such as AP1, CdxA, HSF, NIT2 and HNF-3b. Nine SNPs were obtained through direct sequencing of HcIRF-2 from resistant and susceptible stock. Only +2365T/C SNP was significantly associated with resistance/susceptibility of H. cumingii to Aeromonas hydrophila both in genotype (P = 0.021) and allele (P = 0.006) analysis. The SNPs +2248T/C and +2365T/C were in high linkage disequilibrium, and haplotype analysis revealed that haplotype TT frequency in the resistant group was significantly higher than in the susceptible group. The mortality in +2248CC genotype individuals was significantly higher than in CT and TT genotype individuals. These results indicated that haplotype TT and genotype +2248CT and +2248GT individuals were resistant to A. hydrophila, which could make them potential markers in selective breeding of H. cumingii.
Based on the cDNA sequence of GPX in Hyriopsis cumingii, the complete genomic DNA of GPX gene and it's 5'-flanking region were identified from H. cumingii using PCR and genome walking technique. The length of the complete genomic sequence was 6 708 bp including the 5'-flanking region, two exons, and one intron. Sequence analysis of the 992 bp 5'-flanking region revealed that it contained a core promoter element (TATA-box) and other transcription regulation elements such as AP1, C/EBP, and CdxA. The sequence lengths of the two exons were 273 bp and 991 bp, respectively, and the intron was 4 491 bp in length. Sixteen single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were detected in the GPX gene from resistant stock (RS) and susceptible stock (SS) of H. cumingii. These polymorphisms were analyzed with regard to resistance to Aeromonas hydrophila. Among them, three SNPs including A-99G, A-86C, and A-49C in GPX promoter and five SNPs including A2841T, C2847T, G3146C, A3150G, and G4645T in GPX introns were associated with resistance/susceptibility of H. cumingii to A. hydrophila, both in genotype and allele frequency. Linkage disequilibrium analysis revealed that A-86C, A-49C, C2847T, A3150G, G4645T, A2841T, and G3146C were in high linkage disequilibrium, and haplotype analysis revealed that the frequency of two major predominant haplotypes (ACTGT and TG) in the resistant group was significantly higher than that in the susceptible group. The results suggest that the polymorphic loci in the GPX gene could be potential genetic markers for future molecular selection of strains resistant to diseases.
The high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) protein is a multifunctional cytokine-like molecule that plays an important role in the pathogenesis of tumors. In this study, real-time polymerase chain reactions and Western blot assays indicated that HMGB1 transcriptional activity and protein level are increased in Tax+-T cells (TaxP). To clarify the mechanisms, a series of HMGB1 deletion reporter plasmids (pHLuc1 to pHLuc6) were transfected into Tax--T cells (TaxN, Jurkat) and Tax+-T cells (TaxP). We found that promoter activity in Tax+-T cells to be higher than that in Tax--T cells, indicating a significant increase in pHLuc6. Bay11-7082 (NF-κB inhibitor) treatment did not block the enhancing effect. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays revealed that Tax was retained on a HMGB1 promoter fragment encompassing -1163 to -975. Bioinformatics analysis showed six characteristic cis-elements for CdxA, AP-1, AML-1a, USF, v-Myb, and C/EBP in the fragment in question. Mutation of cis- elements for C/EBP reduced significant HMGB1 promoter activity induced by Tax. These findings indicate that Tax enhances the expression of HMGB1 gene at the transcriptional level, possibly by interacting with C/EBP.
Phenoloxidases (POs) play key roles in various physiological functions in insects, e.g., cuticular sclerotization, wound healing, egg tanning, cuticle formation and melanotic encapsulaction of pathogens. Previously, we identified five POs, designated As-pro-PO I-V, from the mosquito Armigeres subalbatus and demonstrated that the functions of As-pro-PO I, II and III, were associated with filarial parasite melanization, blood feeding and cuticle formation, respectively. In the present study, we delineate the dual functions of As-pro-PO V. We found that the level of As-pro-PO V mRNA in mosquitoes was significantly increased after microfilaria challenge or blood feeding, and decreased to normal level after oviposition. Knockdown of As-pro-PO V by dsRNA resulted in significant decreases in the degree of microfilaria melanization, egg chronic melanization rates and egg hatching rates in Ar. subalbatus. Further transfection and electrophoretic mobility-shift assays verified the As-pro-PO V gene might regulated by both AP-1, a putative immune-related regulatory element and CdxA, a developmental regulatory element. The binding of AP-1 and CdxA motif with mosquito nuclear extracts was significantly enhanced after microfilaria challenge and blood-feeding in Ar. subalbatus, respectively. These results indicate that As-pro-PO V is a critical enzyme that is required for both an effective melanization immune response and egg chorion melanization in this mosquito. 
Our recent genome-wide association study (GWAS) had discovered a new locus at 8p23 (rs2738048) associated with IgA nephropathy (IgAN) in Chinese Han patients, implicating the DEFA gene family within this locus as susceptibility genes. However, it is still unknown whether there are additional variations within these genes associated with the disease susceptibility. The aim of this study is to investigate the polymorphisms of DEFA genes in the susceptibility to IgAN and explore possible disease mechanisms. Sixteen tag single-nucleotide polymorphisms (tag SNPs) were selected for association study in 1,000 IgAN cases and 1,000 controls by using Sequenom MassArray system or TaqMan SNP genotyping assays. We found seven SNPs within DEFA genes that were significantly associated with IgAN, including rs2738048 discovered in our previous GWAS (p = 0.0007, OR = 0.77) and additional 6 SNPs (rs2615787, p = 0.0001, OR = 0.74; rs2738081, p = 0.0003, OR = 0.72; rs2738058, p = 0.0001, OR = 0.73; rs4288398, p = 0.0008, OR = 0.78; rs6984215, p = 0.002, OR = 0.63; rs12716641, p = 0.00002, OR = 0.71). Electrophoretic mobility shift assays and luciferase assays demonstrated that fragments containing rs2738048, rs2738081 and rs6984215 were transcription factor binding sites for CTF, SP1 and CdxA, respectively, and the allele status of rs2738048 and rs6984215 could significantly change the luciferase activity. These results suggest that polymorphisms within DEFA genes are involved in gene transcriptional regulation, and this may have some effect in mediating susceptibility to IgAN in southern Chinese. 
This study examined the associations between vitamin D status, bone mineral content (BMC), areal bone mineral density (aBMD), and markers of calcium homeostasis in preschool-aged children. Children (n=488; age range: 1.8-6.0 y) were randomly recruited from Montreal. The distal forearm was scanned using a peripheral dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry scanner (Lunar PIXI; GE Healthcare, Fairfield, CT). A subset (n=81) had clinical dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (cDXA) scans (Hologic 4500A Discovery Series) of lumbar spine (LS) 1-4, whole body, and ultradistal forearm. All were assessed for plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] and parathyroid hormone concentrations (Liaison; Diasorin), ionized calcium (ABL80 FLEX; Radiometer Medical A/S), and dietary vitamin D and calcium intakes by survey. Age (p&lt;0.001) and weight-for-age Z-score (p&lt;0.001) were positively associated with BMC and aBMD in all regression models, whereas male sex contributed positively to forearm BMC and aBMD. Having a 25(OH)D concentration of &gt;75 nmol/L positively associated with forearm and whole body BMC and aBMD (p&lt;0.036). Sun index related to (p&lt;0.029) cDXA forearm and LS 1-4 BMC and whole-body aBMD. Nutrient intakes did not relate to BMC or aBMD. In conclusion, higher vitamin D status is linked to higher BMC and aBMD of forearm and whole body in preschool-aged children.
Claudin-6 (CLDN6) is an integral component of the tight junction proteins in polarized epithelial and endothelial cells and plays a crucial role in maintaining cell integrity. Deregulation of CLDN6 expression and distribution in tumor tissues have been widely documented and correlated with cancer progression and metastasis. However, a complete mechanistic understanding of CLDN6 regulation and function remains to be studied. Herein, we show new potential properties of CLDN6 regulation and functions from bioinformatics analysis. Using numerous algorithms to characterize the CLDN6 gene promoter elements and the CLDN6 protein structure, physio-chemical and localization properties, and its evolutionary relationships. CLDN6 is regulated by a diverse set of transcription factors (SP1, SPR, AML-1a, CdxA, CRE-BP and CREB) and associated with the levels of methylation of CpG islands in promoters. The structural properties of CLDN6 indicate that it promotes cancer cell behavior via the ASK1-p38/JNK MAPK secretory signaling pathway. In conclusion, this information from bioinformatics analysis will help future attempts to better understand CLDN6 regulation and functions.
miRNAs have been widely investigated in terms of cell proliferation and differentiation. However, little is known about their effects on bird growth. Here we characterized the promoter of miR-206 in chicken and found that the preferable promoter was located in 1200 bp upstream of pri-miR-206. In this region, many key transcription factors, including MyoD, c-Myb, CEBPα/β, AP-4, RAP1, Brn2, GATA-1/2/3, E47, Sn, upstream stimulatory factor (USF) and CdxA, were predicted to bind and interact with miR-206 promoter. Overexpression of MyoD sharply increased miR-206 expression in both fibroblast and myoblast cells, and also the regulation in the myoblast cells was much stronger, indicating that miR-206 was regulated by MyoD combined with other muscle specific transcriptional factors. Aiming to further investigate the relationship between miR-206 mutation and transcriptional expression, total of 23 SNPs were identified in the two distinct bird lines by sequencing. Interestingly, the motif bound by MyoD was individually destroyed by G-to-C mutation located at 419 bp upstream of miR-206 precursor. Co-transfecting MyoD and miR-206 promoter in DF-1 cells, the luciferase activity of promoter containing homozygous GG types was significantly higher than CC ones (p &lt; 0.05). Thus, this mutation caused low expression of miR-206. Consistently, eight variants including G-419C mutation exhibited a great effect on birthweight through maker-trait association analysis in F2 population (p &lt; 0.05). Additionally, the regulation of miR-206 on embryo muscle mass mainly by increasing MyoG and muscle creatine kinase (MCK) expression (p &lt; 0.05) with little change in MyoD, TMEM8C and myosin heavy chain (MHC). In conclusion, our findings provide a novel mutation destroying the promoter activity of miR-206 in birds and shed new light to understand the regulation mechanism of miR-206 on the embryonic muscle growth. 
Twenty-epi analogs of 1alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25D3) are 100-1000 times more potent transcriptionally than the natural hormone. To determine whether this enhanced activity is mediated through modulation of the dimerization process or through interaction with coactivators, we performed quantitative protein-protein interaction assays with in vitro translated vitamin D receptor (ivtVDR) and fusion proteins containing glutathione-S-transferase (GST) and either the ligand-binding domain of retinoid X receptor (RXRalpha), or the nuclear receptor-interacting domain of the steroid receptor coactivator 1 (SRC-1), or the glucocorticoid receptor-interacting protein 1 (GRIP-1). We found that heterodimerization of the ligand-binding domains of RXRalpha and VDR was primarily deltanoid dependent as was the interaction of VDR with the SRC-1 or with GRIP-1. The ED50 for induction of heterodimerization was 2 nM for 1,25D3 and 0.05 nM for 20-epi-1,25D3. However, the ED50 for induction of VDR interaction with SRC-1 was similar for both 1,25D3 and the 20-epi analog (ED50 = 0.7-1.0 nM) as was the ED50 for ligand-mediated interaction of VDR with GRIP-1 (ED50 = 0.1-0.3 nM). Mutations in heptad 9 diminished both 1,25D3 and the 20-epi analog-mediated dimerization, without changing binding of these ligands to VDR. Mutations in VDR's activation function 2 (AF-2) domain/helix 12 residues diminished the ability of 1,25D3 to induce heterodimerization and interaction with SRC-1. These mutations did not change the ability of 20-epi-1,25D3 to induce dimerization but did diminish its ability to induce interaction with SRC-1. We hypothesize that both the hormone and the analog stabilize receptor conformations that expose VDR's functional interfaces. The mechanisms by which the two ligands expose these functional interfaces differ with respect to participation of the AF-2 domain.
Cognate cDNAs are described for 2 of the 10 thyroid hormone receptor-associated proteins (TRAPs) that are immunopurified with thyroid hormone receptor alpha (TRalpha) from ligand-treated HeLa (alpha-2) cells. Both TRAP220 and TRAP100 contain LXXLL domains found in other nuclear receptor-interacting proteins and both appear to reside in a single complex with other TRAPs (in the absence of TR). However, only TRAP220 shows a direct ligand-dependent interaction with TRalpha, and these interactions are mediated through the C terminus of TRalpha and (at least in part) the LXXLL domains of TRAP220. TRAP220 also interacts with other nuclear receptors [vitamin D receptor, retinoic acid receptor alpha, retinoid X receptor alpha, peroxisome proliferation-activated receptor (PPAR) alpha, PPARgamma and, to a lesser extent, estrogen receptor] in a ligand-dependent manner, whereas TRAP100 shows only marginal interactions with estrogen receptor, retinoid X receptor alpha, PPARalpha, and PPARgamma. Consistent with these results, TRAP220 moderately stimulates human TRalpha-mediated transcription in transfected cells, whereas a fragment containing the LXXLL motifs acts as a dominant negative inhibitor of nuclear receptor-mediated transcription both in transfected cells (TRalpha) and in cell free transcription systems (TRalpha and vitamin D receptor). These studies indicate that TRAP220 plays a major role in anchoring other TRAPs to TRalpha during the function of the TRalpha-TRAP complex and, further, that TRAP220 (possibly along with other TRAPs) may be a global coactivator for the nuclear receptor superfamily.
The thyroid hormone receptor (TR) and retinoic acid receptor (RAR) isoforms have the capacity to silence gene expression in the absence of their ligands on target response elements. This active repression is mediated by the ability of the corepressors, nuclear receptor corepressor (NCoR) and silencing mediator of retinoid and thyroid hormone receptors (SMRT), to recruit a complex containing histone deacetylase activity. Interestingly, NCoR and SMRT share significant differences in the their two nuclear receptor-interacting domains (IDs), suggesting that they may recruit receptors with different affinities. In addition, the role of the receptor complex bound to a response element has not been fully evaluated in its ability to recruit separate corepressors. We demonstrate in this report that the proximal ID in NCoR and SMRT, which share only 23% homology, allows preferential recognition of nuclear receptors, such that TR prefers to recruit NCoR, and RAR prefers to recruit SMRT, to DNA response elements. However, mutations in the TR found in the syndromes of resistance to thyroid hormone can change the corepressor recruited by changing the complex (homodimer or heterodimer) formed on the TRE. These results demonstrate that the corepressor complex recruited can be both nuclear receptor- and receptor complex-specific.
Proteins belonging to the 14--3-3 family interact with various regulatory proteins involved in cellular signaling, cell cycle regulation, or apoptosis. 14--3-3 proteins have been suggested to act by regulating the cytoplasmic/nuclear localization of their target proteins or by acting as molecular scaffolds or chaperones. We have previously shown that overexpression of 14--3-3 enhances the transcriptional activity of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), which is a member of the nuclear receptor family. In this study, we show that 14--3-3 interacts with the nuclear receptor corepressor RIP140. In transfection assays, RIP140 antagonizes 14--3-3- enhanced GR transactivation. Using colocalization studies we demonstrate that 14--3-3 can export RIP140 out of the nucleus and, interestingly, can also change its intranuclear localization. Moreover, we also observed that 14--3-3 can bind various other nuclear receptors and cofactors. In summary, our findings suggest that 14--3-3-mediated intracellular relocalization of the GR corepressor RIP140 might be a novel mechanism to enhance glucocorticoid responsiveness of target genes. They furthermore indicate a more general role for 14--3-3 protein by influencing the nuclear availability of nuclear receptor-associated cofactors.
Originally called retinoid X receptor interacting protein 14 (RIP14), the farnesoid X receptor (FXR) was renamed after the ability of its rat form to bind supra-physiological concentrations of farnesol. In 1999 FXR was de-orphanized since primary bile acids were identified as natural ligands. Strongly expressed in the liver and intestine, FXR has been shown to be the master transcriptional regulator of several entero-hepatic metabolic pathways with relevance to the pathophysiology of conditions such as cholestasis, fatty liver disease, cholesterol gallstone disease, intestinal inflammation and tumors. Furthermore, given the importance of FXR in the gut-liver axis feedbacks regulating lipid and glucose homeostasis, FXR modulation appears to have great input in diseases such as metabolic syndrome and diabetes. Exciting results from several cellular and animal models have provided the impetus to develop synthetic FXR ligands as novel pharmacological agents. Fourteen years from its discovery, FXR has gone from bench to bedside; a novel nuclear receptor ligand is going into clinical use.
Bile acids (BAs) circulate between the liver and intestine, and regulate the homeostasis of glucose, lipid, and energy. Recent studies demonstrated an essential role of BAs in neurological diseases, suggesting an interaction between BAs and the nervous system. In the present study, we showed that impaired vagus function in rats induced by vagotomy resulted in an increase in bile flow without causing liver injury. The concentrations of unconjugated and glycine-conjugated BAs were increased in both serum and bile of rats after vagotomy, which was due to impaired tight junctions and thus increased passive absorption of BAs in the intestine. Vagotomy markedly suppressed the expression of the rate-limiting BA synthetic enzyme Cyp7a1, which was not due to activation of Fxr-Shp signaling in the liver, but due to activation of Fxr-Fgf15 signaling in the intestine. Furthermore, vagotomy produced a BA profile in the bile favorable for Fxr activation by decreasing tauro-β-muricholic acid, a natural Fxr antagonist, and increasing glyco-chenodeoxycholic acid, a natural Fxr agonist. In summary, the present study provides the first comprehensive analysis of the critical role of the vagus nerve in regulating BA metabolism and signaling pathway.
Mice lacking farnesoid X receptor (FXR) are used as a model for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease because their livers exhibit hepatomegaly, hepatic steatosis, and hepatic inflammation. The influence of fish oil feeding on hepatomegaly and disrupted hepatic function was investigated using female Fxr-null mice and wild-type mice fed a fish oil diet (2% fish oil and 2% corn oil) or a control diet (4% corn oil) for 4 weeks. Hepatic n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) levels, including 22:6 n-3 docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and 20:5 n-3 eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) were significantly higher in the fish oil group than those in the control group of Fxr-null mice and wild-type mice. Fxr-null mouse livers of the control group showed a whitish brown coloration, whereas Fxr-null mouse livers of the fish oil group showed a dark brown coloration similar to that of wild-type mice. The liver in Fxr-null mice of the fish oil group was smaller than that of the control group. There was a significant decrease in the levels of hepatic damage-associated diagnostic markers, hepatic and serum bile acids, triglycerides, free fatty acids, and total cholesterol levels in Fxr-null mice because of fish oil feeding. It also reversed elevated mRNA levels of oxidative stress-related genes (Hmox1, Gsta1, and Gsta2) and reduced mRNA levels of transcriptional factors (Pparα and Shp) in Fxr-null mice. These results suggest that fish oil feeding reverses hepatomegaly and disrupted hepatic function due to the lack of FXR signaling.
The Farnesoid X receptor (FXR) is a nuclear receptor activated by bile acids (BAs). BAs are amphipathic molecules that serve as fat solubilizers in the intestine under postprandial conditions. In the post-absorptive state, BAs bind FXR in the hepatocytes, which in turn provides feedback signals on BA synthesis and transport and regulates lipid, glucose and amino acid metabolism. Therefore, FXR acts as a homeostat of all three classes of nutrients, fats, sugars and proteins. Here we re-analyze the function of FXR in the perspective of nutritional metabolism, and discuss the role of FXR in liver energy homeostasis in postprandial, post-absorptive and fasting/starvation states. FXR, by regulating nutritional metabolism, represses autophagy in conditions of nutrient abundance, and controls the metabolic needs of proliferative cells. In addition, FXR regulates inflammation via direct effects and via its impact on nutrient metabolism. These functions indicate that FXR is an attractive therapeutic target for liver diseases.
Recently obeticholic acid (OCA) which is a farnesoid X receptor (FXR) agonist was approved by FDA to treat cholestatic liver diseases, which provided us a novel therapeutic strategy against cholestasis. Herein, we used a novel computational strategy with two-dimensional virtual screening for FXR agonists. For the first time, we found that auraptene (AUR), a natural product, can activate FXR to exert hepatoprotective effect against cholestatic liver injury in vivo and in vitro. Importantly, AUR was found to significantly decrease the mortality of cholestatic mice. Dynamic change analysis of bile acids and gene analysis revealed that AUR promoted bile acid efflux from liver into intestine via an induction in FXR-target genes Bsep and Mrp2 expression, and reduced hepatic uptake through an inhibition in Ntcp. Furthermore, AUR reduced bile acid synthesis through repressing FXR-target genes Cyp7a1 and Cyp8b1, and increased bile acid metabolism through an induction in Sult2a1. In addition, AUR promoted liver repair through an induction in liver regeneration-related gene, and suppressed liver inflammation through repressing inflammation-related gene NF-κB, TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6. However, the changes in these genes and protein, as well as ameliorative liver histology induced by AUR were abrogated by FXR antagonist guggulsterone in vivo and FXR siRNA in vitro. These findings suggest that AUR may be an effective approach for the prevention against cholestatic liver diseases.
We previously showed that increased asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) biliary excretion occurs during hepatic ischemia/reperfusion (I/R), prompting us to study the effects of the farnesoid X receptor (FXR) agonist obeticholic acid (OCA) on bile, serum and tissue levels of ADMA after I/R.
Male Wistar rats were orally administered 10mg/kg/day of OCA or vehicle for 5 days and were subjected to 60 min partial hepatic ischemia or sham-operated. After a 60 min reperfusion, serum, tissue and bile ADMA levels, liver mRNA and protein expression of ADMA transporters (CAT-1, CAT-2A, CAT-2B, OCT-1, MATE-1), and enzymes involved in ADMA synthesis (protein-arginine-N-methyltransferase-1, PRMT-1) and metabolism (dimethylarginine-dimethylaminohydrolase-1, DDAH-1) were measured.
OCA administration induced a further increase in biliary ADMA levels both in sham and I/R groups, with no significant changes in hepatic ADMA content. A reduction in CAT-1, CAT-2A or CAT-2B transcripts was found in OCA-treated sham-operated rats compared with vehicle. Conversely, OCA administration did not change CAT-1, CAT-2A or CAT-2B expression, already reduced by I/R. However, a marked decrease in OCT-1 and increase in MATE-1 expression was observed. A similar trend occurred with protein expression.
The reduced mRNA expression of hepatic CAT transporters suggests that the increase in serum ADMA levels is probably due to decreased liver uptake of ADMA from the systemic circulation. Conversely, the mechanism involved in further increasing biliary ADMA levels in sham and I/R groups treated with OCA appears to be MATE-1-dependent.
Date palm fruit (Phoenix dactylifera) consumption reduces serum triglyceride levels in human subjects. The objective of this study was to prepare an extract from dates and determine whether it acts as a ligand for the farnesoid x receptor (FXR), a nuclear receptor important for maintaining triglyceride and cholesterol homeostasis. Freeze-dried extracts were isolated from California-grown dates (Deglet Noor and Medjool) from the 2014 and 2015 harvests, by means of liquid extraction and solid phase separation. Each date palm extract (DPE) was characterized via HPLC and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry, and the procyanidin content was qualitatively determined. Extracts were tested to determine their ability to modulate nuclear receptor-mediated transactivation using transient transfection. The effect of DPE on FXR-target genes regulating bile acid absorption and transport was then assessed in vitro, in Caco-2 cells. Characterization reveals that DPE is a rich source of polyphenols including hydroxycinnamic acids, proanthocyanidins, and lipohilic polyphenols, and comprises 13% proanthocyanidins. Transactivation results show that DPE acts as a co-agonist ligand for both mouse and human FXR, wherein it activates bile acid-bound FXR greater than that seen with bile acid alone. Additionally, DPE alone activated a peroxisome proliferator activated receptor alpha (PPARα) chimera in a dose-dependent manner. Consistent with DPE as a co-agonist ligand for FXR, studies in Caco-2 cells reveal that co-incubation with bile acid, dose-dependently enhances the expression of fibroblast growth factor 19 (FGF19), compared to treatment with bile acid alone. In contrast, DPE inhibited bile acid-induced expression of ileal bile acid binding protein (IBABP). Our results demonstrate that DPE acts as a potent co-agonist ligand for FXR, and that it differentially regulates FXR-target gene expression in vitro in human intestinal cells. This study provides novel insight into a potential mechanism by which dates may exert a hypotriglyceridemic effect via FXR and modulation of bile acid homeostasis.
Glucuronidation is considered an important detoxification pathway of bile acids especially in cholestatic conditions. Glucuronides are less toxic than the parent free forms and are more easily excreted in urine. However, the pathophysiological significance of bile acid glucuronidation is still controversial and debated among the scientific community. Progress in this field has been strongly limited by the lack of appropriate methods for the preparation of pure glucuronides in the amount needed for biological and pharmacological studies. In this work, we have developed a new synthesis of bile acid C3-glucuronides enabling the convenient preparation of gram-scale quantities. The synthesized compounds have been characterized in terms of physicochemical properties and abilities to modulate key nuclear receptors including the farnesoid X receptor (FXR). In particular, we found that C3-glucuronides of chenodeoxycholic acid and lithocholic acid, respectively the most abundant and potentially cytotoxic species formed in patients affected by cholestasis, behave as FXR agonists and positively regulate the gene expression of transporter proteins, the function of which is critical in human conditions related to imbalances of bile acid homeostasis.
Impaired regulation of bile acid (BA) homeostasis has been suggested to be associated with adverse metabolic consequences. However, whether BA homeostasis is altered in diabetes-induced cognitive dysfunction (DCD) remains unknown. In the present study, mice were divided into four groups, namely normal control (NC) group, high-fat diet (HFD) group, diabetes without cognitive dysfunction (unDCD) group, and DCD group. Compared to HFD mice, the concentration of total BAs in liver was higher in unDCD and DCD mice, due to increased intestinal BA absorption. DCD mice tended to have higher BA concentrations in both liver and ileum than unDCD mice. Consequently, DCD mice had increased basolateral BA efflux (Ostα, Ostβ, and Mrp4) and decreased BA synthesis (Cyp7a1, Cyp8b1, and Cyp7b1) in the liver as well as activated Fxr-Fgf15 signaling in the ileum. DCD mice also had increased BA hydroxylation (Cyp3a11) and BA sulfation (Sult2a1) in the liver compared to HFD mice. Furthermore, the bacterial community composition was altered in the cecum of DCD mice, characterized with a marked increase in Defferribacteres and Candidatus Saccharibacteria. In summary, the present study provides the first comprehensive analysis of BA homeostasis in DCD mice, and revealed a potential role of BAs in DCD development.
Evaluating whether changes in gut microbiota induced by a bifidobacterial strain may have an effect on the hepatic vascular function in portal hypertensive cirrhotic rats.
Bile duct ligation (BDL) was performed in rats. A subgroup of animals received B. pseudocatenulatum CECT7765 (109 cfu/daily ig.) for 1 week prior to laparotomy. Hemodynamic, biochemical and inflammatory markers were evaluated. Ileal microbiota composition was identified. Statistical analysis was performed.
Sham-operated (n = 6), BDL (n = 6) and BDL treated with bifidobacteria (n = 8) rats were included. B. pseudocatenulatum CECT7765 significantly decreased proteobacteria (p = 0.001) and increased Bacteroidetes (p = 0.001) relative abundance. The bifidobacteria decreased the Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio in the BDL model (p = 0.03). BDL with bifidobacteria vs BDL rats showed: significantly reduced portal vein area, portal flow, congestion index, alkaline phosphatase and total bilirubin, significantly increased serum cytokines and nitric oxide levels, gene expression levels of bile acids receptor FXR and endothelial nitric oxide synthase. Quantitative changes in the Clostridiales and Bacteroidales orders were independently associated with variations in portal vein area and portal flow, while changes in the Proteobacteria phylum were independently associated with congestion. Variations in all liver function markers significantly correlated with total OTUs mainly in the Firmicutes, but only changes in the Clostridiales were independently associated with alkaline phosphatase in the ANCOVA analysis.
Hemodynamic alterations and liver dysfunction induced by BDL in rats are partially restored after oral administration of B. pseudocatenulatum CECT7765. Results provide a proof-of-concept for the beneficial effect of this bifidobacterial strain in reducing complications derived from portal hypertension in cirrhosis.
Inflammation has a recognized role in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) progression. The present work studied the effect of high fat diet (HFD) on arachidonic acid metabolism in the liver and investigated the role of the farnesoid X receptor (FXR, NR1H4) in eicosanoid biosynthetic pathways and NF-kB signaling, major modulators of the inflammatory cascade. Mice were fed a HFD to induce NAFLD, then, treated with the FXR ligand obeticholic acid (OCA). Histology and gene expression analysis were performed on liver tissue. Eicosanoid levels were measured from serum and urine samples. The molecular mechanism underlying the effect of FXR activation on arachidonic acid metabolism and NF-kB signaling was studied in Huh7 cells and primary cultured hepatocytes. NAFLD was characterized by higher (~25%) pro-inflammatory (leukotrienes, LTB4) and lower (~3fold) anti-inflammatory (epoxyeicosatrienoic acids, EETs) eicosanoid levels than in chow mice. OCA induced the expression of several hepatic Cyp450 epoxygenases, the enzymes responsible for EET synthesis, and mitigated HFD-induced hepatic injury. In vitro, induction of CYP450 epoxygenases was sufficient to inhibit NF-kB signaling and cell migration. The CYP450 epoxygenase pan-inhibitor gemfibrozil fully abolished the protective effect of OCA indicating that OCA-mediated inhibition of NF-kB signaling was EET-dependent. In summary non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) was characterized by an imbalance in arachidonate metabolism. Farnesoid X receptor (FXR) activation reprogramed arachidonate metabolism by inducing CYP450 epoxygenase expression and EET production. In vitro, FXR-mediated NF-kB inhibition, required active CYP450 epoxygenases.
Emerging evidence has shown that FXR activation ameliorates the development of alcoholic liver diseases (ALD) while whole-body deficiency of FXR in mice leads to more severe ALD. However, it's unknown whether the enhanced susceptibility to ALD development in FXR-/- mice is due to deficiency of hepatic FXR or increased toxicity secondary to increased bile acid (BA) levels. Hepatocyte-specific FXR knockout mice (FXRhep-/-) present similar BA levels compared to wild-type mice, and are therefore a useful model to study a direct role of hepatic FXR in ALD development. FXRhep-/- mice were subject to an ALD model with chronic plus binge drinking of alcohol to determine the effects of hepatic FXR deficiency on ALD development. The FXRhep-/- mice showed an altered expression of genes involved in BA and lipid homeostasis with alcohol treatment. Despite a slightly increased trend in hepatic lipid deposition and collagen accumulation in FXRhep-/- mice, there were no significant differences in the severity of steatosis, inflammation, or fibrosis between WT and FXRhep-/- mice. Therefore, these findings indicate that FXR deficiency in hepatocytes might only play a minor role in ALD development. Deficiency of FXR in other non-hepatic tissues and/or increased BA levels resultant from whole-body FXR deficiency might be responsible for more severe ALD development.
Hypertonicity in renal medulla is critical for the kidney to produce concentrated urine. Renal medullary cells have to survive high medullary osmolarity during antidiuresis. Previous study reported that farnesoid X receptor (FXR), a nuclear receptor transcription factor activated by endogenous bile acids, increases urine concentrating ability by up-regulating aquaporin 2 expression in medullary collecting duct cells (MCDs). However, whether FXR is also involved in the maintenance of cell survival of MCDs under dehydration condition and hypertonic stress remains largely unknown. In the present study, we demonstrate that 24-hours water restriction selectively up-regulated renal medullary expression of FXR with little MCD apoptosis in wild-type mice. In contrast, water deprivation caused a massive apoptosis of MCDs in both global FXR gene-deficient mice and collecting duct-specific FXR knockout mice. In vitro studies showed that hypertonicity significantly increased FXR and tonicity response enhancer binding protein (TonEBP) expression in mIMCD3 cell line and primary cultured MCDs. Activation and overexpression of FXR markedly increased cell viability and decreased cell apoptosis under hyperosmotic conditions. In addition, FXR can increase gene expression and nuclear translocation of TonEBP. We conclude that FXR protects MCDs from hypertonicity-induced cell injury very likely via increasing TonEBP expression and nuclear translocation. This study provides insights into the molecular mechanism by which FXR enhances urine concentration via maintaining cell viability of MCDs under hyperosmotic condition.
Farnesoid X receptor (FXR) is a member of nuclear receptor family involved in multiple physiological processes through regulating specific target genes. The critical role of FXR as a transcriptional regulator makes it a promising target for diverse diseases, especially those related to metabolic disorders such as diabetes and cholestasis. However, the underlying activation mechanism of FXR is still a blur owing to the absence of proper FXR modulators. To identify potential FXR modulators, an in-house natural product database (NPD) containing over 4,000 compounds was screened by structure-based virtual screening strategy and subsequent hit-based similarity searching method. After the yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) assay, six natural products were identified as FXR antagonists which blocked the CDCA-induced SRC-1 association. The IC50 values of compounds 2a, a diterpene bearing polycyclic skeleton, and 3a, named daphneone with chain scaffold, are as low as 1.29 and 1.79 μM, respectively. Compared to the control compound guggulsterone (IC50 = 6.47 μM), compounds 2a and 3a displayed 5- and 3-fold higher antagonistic activities against FXR, respectively. Remarkably, the two representative compounds shared low topological similarities with other reported FXR antagonists. According to the putative binding poses, the molecular basis of these antagonists against FXR was also elucidated in this report.
The primary cilia are evolutionarily conserved microtubule-based cellular organelles that perceive metabolic status and thus link the sensory system to cellular signaling pathways. Therefore, ciliogenesis is thought to be tightly linked to autophagy, which is also regulated by nutrient-sensing transcription factors, such as PPARA (peroxisome proliferator activated receptor alpha) and NR1H4/FXR (nuclear receptor subfamily 1, group H, member 4). However, the relationship between these factors and ciliogenesis has not been clearly demonstrated. Here, we present direct evidence for the involvement of macroautophagic/autophagic regulators in controlling ciliogenesis. We showed that activation of PPARA facilitated ciliogenesis independently of cellular nutritional states. Importantly, PPARA-induced ciliogenesis was mediated by controlling autophagy, since either pharmacological or genetic inactivation of autophagy significantly repressed ciliogenesis. Moreover, we showed that pharmacological activator of autophagy, rapamycin, recovered repressed ciliogenesis in ppara-/- cells. Conversely, activation of NR1H4 repressed cilia formation, while knockdown of NR1H4 enhanced ciliogenesis by inducing autophagy. The reciprocal activities of PPARA and NR1H4 in regulating ciliogenesis were highlighted in a condition where de-repressed ciliogenesis by NR1H4 knockdown was further enhanced by PPARA activation. The in vivo roles of PPARA and NR1H4 in regulating ciliogenesis were examined in greater detail in ppara-/- mice. In response to starvation, ciliogenesis was facilitated in wild-type mice via enhanced autophagy in kidney, while ppara-/- mice displayed impaired autophagy and kidney damage resembling ciliopathy. Furthermore, an NR1H4 agonist exacerbated kidney damage associated with starvation in ppara-/- mice. These findings indicate a previously unknown role for PPARA and NR1H4 in regulating the autophagy-ciliogenesis axis in vivo.
Understanding of the temporal changes of hepatic lesions in the progression and regression of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is vital to elucidation of the pathogenesis of NASH, and critical to the development of a strategy for NASH pharmacotherapy. There are challenges in studying hepatic lesion progression and regression in NASH patients due to the slow development of NASH in humans, one being the requirement for multiple biopsies during the longitudinal follow-up. Here we studied lesion progression and regression in the diet-induced animal model of NASH by application or removal of the pathogenic diet for multiple time periods. Male C57BL/6 mice fed Western diet developed progressive hepatic steatosis/macrovesicular vacuolation, inflammation, and hepatocyte degeneration, as well as perisinusoidal fibrosis and occasionally portal fibrosis as early as 2 months after initiation of the Western diet. In the same period, the mice exhibited elevated ALT (alanine aminotransferase) and AST (aspartate aminotransferase) enzyme activities, CK18 (cytokeratin-18), PIIINP (N-terminal propeptide of type III collagen), and TIMP-1 (tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1). Hepatic steatosis diminished rapidly when the Western diet was replaced by normal rodent chow diet and hepatic inflammation and hepatocyte degeneration were also reduced. Interestingly, perisinusoidal fibrosis and portal fibrosis regressed 8 months after chow diet replacement. To understand pharmacotherapy for NASH, mice with established NASH hepatic lesions were treated with either FXR agonist obeticholic acid (Ocaliva), or CCR2/5 antagonist Cenicriviroc. Similar to the diet replacement, metabolic modulator Ocaliva markedly reduced steatosis/macrovesicular vacuolation, hepatic inflammation, and hepatocyte degeneration effectively, but exhibited no significant effect on liver fibrosis. Anti-inflammation drug Cenicriviroc, on the other hand, markedly decreased inflammation and hepatocyte degeneration, and mildly decreased liver fibrosis, but exhibited no effect on hepatic steatosis/macrovesicular vacuolation. In conclusion, we found the progression of NASH hepatic steatosis/macrovesicular vacuolation, and inflammation eventually lead to hepatocyte death and fibrosis. Life style change and current pharmacotherapies in development may be effective in treating NASH, but their effects on NASH-induced fibrosis may be mild. Since fibrosis is known to be an independent risk for decompensated cirrhosis, cardiovascular events, and mortality, our study suggests that effective anti-fibrosis therapy should be an essential component of the combined pharmacotherapy for advanced NASH.
Retinoids are crucial regulators of a wide variety of processes in both developing and adult animals. These effects are thought to be mediated by the retinoic acid (RA) receptors and the retinoid X receptors (RXRs). We have identified an additional retinoid-activated receptor that is neither a retinoic acid receptors nor an RXR. RXR-interacting protein 14 (RIP14), a recently described orphan member of the nuclear receptor superfamily, can be activated by either all-trans-RA (tRA) or the synthetic retinoid TTNPB [[E]-4-[2-(5, 6, 7, 8-tetrahydro-5, 5, 8, 8-tetramethyl-2-naphthalenyl)propen-1-yl]benzoic acid].RIP14 binds to DNA as a heterodimer with RXR. In the presence of either tRA or TTNPB, the addition of 9-cis-RA or the RXR-specific agonist LG1069 [4-[1-(3, 5, 5, 8, 8-pentamethyl-5, 6, 7, 8-tertrahydro-2-naphthyl)ethenyl]benzoic acid] results in additional activation. Mutations of the ligand-dependent transcriptional activation functions indicate that TTNPB activates the RIP14 component of the RIP14-RXR heterodimer, that 9-cis-RA and LG1069 activate RXR, and that tRA activates via both RIP14 and RXR. Despite the very effective activation of RIP14 by tRA or TTNPB, relatively high concentrations of these compounds are required, and no evidence for direct binding of either compound was obtained using several approaches. These results suggest that RIP14 is the receptor for an as-yet-unidentified retinoid metabolite.
Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) affects obesity-associated metabolic syndrome, which exhibits hepatic steatosis, insulin insensitivity and glucose intolerance. Previous studies indicated that hepatic microRNAs (miRs) play critical roles in the development of NAFLD. In this study, we aim to explore the pathophysiological role of miR-194 in obesity-mediated metabolic dysfunction. Our findings show that the high fat diet or palmitic acid treatment significantly increase hepatic miR-194 levels in vivo and in vitro. Silence of miR-194 protects palmitic acid-induced inflammatory response in cultured hepatocytes, and attenuates structural disorders, lipid deposits and inflammatory response in fatty liver. MiR-194 inhibitor also improves glucose and insulin intolerance in obese mice. Through dual luciferase assay, we demonstrate that miR-194 directly binds to FXR/Nr1h4 3'-UTR, and inhibits gene expression of FXR/Nr1h4. Furthermore, overexpression of miR-194 downregulates FXR/Nr1h4 in cultured hepatocytes, but miR-194 inhibitor reversely increases FXR/Nr1h4 expression in obese mouse liver tissues. On the contrast, silence of FXR/Nr1h4 abolishes the hepatic benefits in obese mice treated with miR-194 inhibitor. Present study provides a novel finding that suppression of miR-194 attenuates dietary-induced NAFLD via upregulation of FXR/Nr1h4. The findings suggest miR-194/FXR are potential diagnostic markers and therapeutic targets for NAFLD.
Experimental studies suggest that maternal hypercholesterolemia may be relevant for the early onset of cardiovascular disease in offspring. We investigated the effect of perinatal hypercholesterolemia on the atherosclerosis development in the offspring of apolipoprotein E-deficient mice and the underlying mechanism.
Atherosclerosis and related parameters were studied in adult male or female apolipoprotein E-deficient mice offspring from either normocholesterolemic or hypercholesterolemic mothers and normocholesterolemic fathers. Female born to hypercholesterolemic mothers had more aortic root lesions than female born to normocholesterolemic mothers. Lesions in whole aorta did not differ between groups. Higher trimethylamine-N-oxide levels and Fmo3 hepatic gene expression were higher in female born to hypercholesterolemic mothers offspring compared with female born to normocholesterolemic mothers and male. Trimethylamine-N-oxide levels were correlated with the size of atherosclerotic root lesions. Levels of hepatic cholesterol and gallbladder bile acid were greater in male born to hypercholesterolemic mothers compared with male born to normocholesterolemic mothers. At 18 weeks of age, female born to hypercholesterolemic mothers showed lower hepatic Scarb1 and Cyp7a1 but higher Nr1h4 gene expression compared with female born to normocholesterolemic mothers. Male born to hypercholesterolemic mothers showed an increase in Scarb1 and Ldlr gene expression compared with male born to normocholesterolemic mothers. At 25 weeks of age, female born to hypercholesterolemic mothers had lower Cyp7a1 gene expression compared with female born to normocholesterolemic mothers. DNA methylation of Fmo3, Scarb1, and Ldlr promoter regions was slightly modified and may explain the mRNA expression modulation.
Our findings suggest that maternal hypercholesterolemia may exacerbate the development of atherosclerosis in female offspring by affecting metabolism of trimethylamine-N-oxide and bile acids. These data could be explained by epigenetic alterations.
The transcription factor hepatocyte nuclear factor-1β (HNF-1β) is essential for normal kidney development and function. Inactivation of HNF-1β in mouse kidney tubules leads to early-onset cyst formation and postnatal lethality. Here, we used Pkhd1/Cre mice to delete HNF-1β specifically in renal collecting ducts (CDs). CD-specific HNF-1β mutant mice survived long term and developed slowly progressive cystic kidney disease, renal fibrosis, and hydronephrosis. Compared with wild-type littermates, HNF-1β mutant mice exhibited polyuria and polydipsia. Before the development of significant renal structural abnormalities, mutant mice exhibited low urine osmolality at baseline and after water restriction and administration of desmopressin. However, mutant and wild-type mice had similar plasma vasopressin and solute excretion levels. HNF-1β mutant kidneys showed increased expression of aquaporin-2 mRNA but mislocalized expression of aquaporin-2 protein in the cytoplasm of CD cells. Mutant kidneys also had decreased expression of the UT-A urea transporter and collectrin, which is involved in apical membrane vesicle trafficking. Treatment of HNF-1β mutant mIMCD3 cells with hypertonic NaCl inhibited the induction of osmoregulated genes, including Nr1h4, which encodes the transcription factor FXR that is required for maximal urinary concentration. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and sequencing experiments revealed HNF-1β binding to the Nr1h4 promoter in wild-type kidneys, and immunoblot analysis revealed downregulated expression of FXR in HNF-1β mutant kidneys. These findings reveal a novel role of HNF-1β in osmoregulation and identify multiple mechanisms, whereby mutations of HNF-1β produce defects in urinary concentration.
Control of gene transcription relies on concomitant regulation by multiple transcriptional regulators (TRs). However, how recruitment of a myriad of TRs is orchestrated at cis-regulatory modules (CRMs) to account for coregulation of specific biological pathways is only partially understood. Here, we have used mouse liver CRMs involved in regulatory activities of the hepatic TR, NR1H4 (FXR; farnesoid X receptor), as our model system to tackle this question. Using integrative cistromic, epigenomic, transcriptomic, and interactomic analyses, we reveal a logical organization where trans-regulatory modules (TRMs), which consist of subsets of preferentially and coordinately corecruited TRs, assemble into hierarchical combinations at hepatic CRMs. Different combinations of TRMs add to a core TRM, broadly found across the whole landscape of CRMs, to discriminate promoters from enhancers. These combinations also specify distinct sets of CRM differentially organized along the genome and involved in regulation of either housekeeping/cellular maintenance genes or liver-specific functions. In addition to these TRMs which we define as obligatory, we show that facultative TRMs, such as one comprising core circadian TRs, are further recruited to selective subsets of CRMs to modulate their activities. TRMs transcend TR classification into ubiquitous versus liver-identity factors, as well as TR grouping into functional families. Hence, hierarchical superimpositions of obligatory and facultative TRMs bring about independent transcriptional regulatory inputs defining different sets of CRMs with logical connection to regulation of specific gene sets and biological pathways. Altogether, our study reveals novel principles of concerted transcriptional regulation by multiple TRs at CRMs.
Eculizumab-treated paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) patients (pts) show a dramatic decrease in serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activities and bilirubin concentrations. However, some pts remain hyperbilirubinemic, possibly indicating an inadequate response due to extravascular hemolysis.
Mutation analyses of hepatocanalicular transporter/nuclear receptor variants (ABCB4, ABCB11, ATP8B1, NR1H4) were performed in eight (five of eight males; mean age 38 years [range 26-68 years]) out of the 174 pts with PNH/-clone at our department due to a persistent increase in total bilirubin concentrations (median 3.4 mg/dL; range 2.1-8.1 mg/dL) during chronic eculizumab treatment and normal/or slightly increased serum aminotransferase activities. Median observation time was 70.1 months (range 10.6-135.2 months). All pts were treated according to German PNH guidelines.
Homozygous and heterozygous procholestatic variants in the ABCB4, ABCB11, and ATP8B1 genes were identified in all eight pts. All carried the common ABCB4 c.787A&gt;T polymorphism. The A(TA)7 TAA variant in the UGT1A1 promoter causing Gilbert syndrome was detected in three pts (5/8).
Hyperbilirubinemia in PNH pts treated with eculizumab might not only be due to an insufficient response but rather a combination of mutations in hepatocanalicular transporter variants, Gilbert syndrome, and extravascular hemolysis. Our findings warrant further studies concerning transporter and enzyme variants in PNH to determine their clinical significance.
Progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis (PFIC) is a genetically heterogeneous disorder of bile flow disruption due to abnormal canalicular transport or impaired bile acid (BA) metabolism, causing excess BA accumulation and liver failure. We reported an intrahepatic cholestasis mouse model based on loss of function of both farnesoid X receptor (FXR; NR1H4) and small heterodimer partner (SHP, NR0B2) (DKO), which has strong similarities to human PFIC type 5. Here, we compare the pathogenesis of the DKO liver to that of another intrahepatic cholestasis model, Bsep-/-, which represents human PFIC2. Both models exhibit severe hepatomegaly and hepatic BA accumulation, but DKO show higher circulating BA and liver injury, whereas Bsep-/- have milder phenotypes. Molecular profiling of BAs uncovered specific enrichment of cholic acid (CA)-derived BAs in DKO liver, but chenodeoxycholate (CDCA)-derived BAs in Bsep-/- liver. Transcriptomic and proteomic analysis revealed specific activation of CA synthesis and alternative basolateral BA transport in DKO, but increased CDCA synthesis and canalicular transport in Bsep-/-. The CAR/PXR-CYP2B/CYP2C axis is activated in DKO livers, but not in other cholestasis models. Loss of this axis in Fxr:Shp:Car:Pxr quadruple knockouts blocked Cyp2b/Cyp2c gene induction, impaired bilirubin conjugation/elimination, and increased liver injury. Differential CYP2B expression in DKO and Bsep-/- was recapitulated in human PFIC5 and PFIC2 livers.
Loss of FXR/SHP results in distinct molecular pathogenesis and CAR/PXR activation, which promotes Cyp2b/Cyp2c gene transcription and bilirubin clearance; CAR/PXR activation is not observed in Bsep-/- mice or PFIC2 patients. This result provides a deeper understanding of the heterogeneity of intrahepatic cholestasis.
Cholesterol levels are strictly regulated to maintain its homeostasis; therefore, if it is not absorbed with the diet, the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway is enhanced and vice versa. Nowadays, the commonly prescribed therapeutic treatments for hypocholesterolemic patients are targeted toward the reduction of both cholesterol intestinal absorption and/or its endogenous biosynthesis. But, when hypercholesterolemia is still moderate the consumption of food products with cholesterol-lowering capacities is more desirable than using drugs. Marketed foods supplemented with hypocholesterolemic compounds are only inhibiting mechanisms for cholesterol absorption (i.e. phytosterols and cereal β-glucans). However, certain fungal extracts obtained from edible mushrooms might be able to modulate cholesterol levels by both strategies, pharmaceutical drugs and functional foods. In vitro and in vivo studies indicated that fungal sterols down-regulated genes involved in cholesterol homeostasis (such as Srebf2 and Nr1h4 (FXR)) and other specific mushroom extracts (β-glucans and other water-soluble compounds) also stimulated transcriptional profiles similar to simvastatin or ezetimibe (two hypocholesterolemic drugs). These and other observations suggested that the hypocholesterolemic effect of mushroom extracts could be due to transcriptional and post-transcriptional modulations besides other indirect effects.
Farnesoid X receptor (FXR, NR1H4) is a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily of ligand-activated transcription factors. Since the role of FXR in osteoclast differentiation remains ill-defined, we investigated the biological function of FXR on osteoclastogenesis, using FXR-deficient mice. We demonstrated that FXR deficiency increases osteoclast formation in vitro and in vivo. First, FXR deficiency was found to accelerate osteoclast formation via down-regulation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) 1/2 expression. Increased expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)γ and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1 (PGC-1)β seems to mediate the pro-osteoclastogenic effect of FXR deficiency via the JNK pathway. In addition, we found that FXR deficiency downregulated the expression of interferon-β (IFN-β), a strong inhibitor of osteoclastogenesis, via receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappaB ligand (RANKL). We further suggested that interference of IFN-β expression by FXR deficiency impaired the downstream JAK3-STAT1 signaling pathways, which in turn increased osteoclast formation. Finally, FXR deficiency accelerated unloading- or ovariectomy-induced bone loss in vivo. Thus, our findings demonstrate that FXR is a negative modulator in osteoclast differentiation and identify FXR as a potential therapeutic target for postmenopausal osteoporosis and unloading-induced bone loss.
Clinical and experimental studies showed that the reflux of bile into the stomach contributes to the induction of intestinal metaplasia of the stomach and gastric carcinogenesis. Caudal-type homeobox 2 (Cdx2) plays a key role in the exhibition of intestinal phenotypes by regulating the expression of intestine-specific genes such as goblet-specific gene mucin 2 (MUC2). We investigated the involvement of the farnesoid X receptor (FXR), a nuclear receptor for bile acids, in the chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA)-induced expression of Cdx2 and MUC2 in normal rat gastric epithelial cells (RGM-1 cells). RGM-1 cells were treated with CDCA or GW4064, an FXR agonist, in the presence or absence of guggulsterone, an FXR antagonist. CDCA induced dose-dependent expression of Cdx2 and MUC2 at both the mRNA and protein levels. The maximum stimulation of Cdx2 and MUC2 mRNA induced by CDCA was observed at 3 h and by 6 h, respectively. GW4064 also induced expression of these molecules. The effects of CDCA and GW4064 on expression of Cdx2 and MUC2 were abolished by guggulsterone. These findings suggest that bile acids may induce gastric intestinal metaplasia and carcinogenesis through the FXR.
The immunoreactivity of thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF-1) is a very specific marker for lung and thyroid neoplasms; the expression of TTF-1 has also been demonstrated in extrapulmonary carcinomas. We examined the expression of TTF-1 in 15 intestinal-type adenocarcinomas of the extrahepatic bile duct. We then compared the expression to TTF-1 staining with other immunohistochemical markers including cytokeratin (CK) 7, CK20, caudal-type homeobox transcription factor 2 (CDX2), Napsin A, and MUC2. We additionally compared the clinicopathological prognostic factors with the TTF-1 expression status.
Nuclear TTF-1 staining was detected in 2 cases (13.3%), and Napsin A was positive in the same 2 cases (13.3%). All cases were positive for CK20, CDX2, and MUC2; 5 cases were positive for CK7. There was no correlation between TTF-1 expression and the clinicopathological characteristics.
To avoid potential pitfalls, TTF-1 should be interpreted in conjunction with the clinical setting, histology, and the results of markers such as CK7, CK20, Napsin A, and CDX2. This report is the first of TTF-1 positivity in adenocarcinomas from the extrahepatic biliary tract.
The 5' cap of human messenger RNA contains 2'-O-methylation of the first and often second transcribed nucleotide that is important for its processing, translation and stability. Human enzymes that methylate these nucleotides, termed CMTr1 and CMTr2, respectively, have recently been identified. However, the structures of these enzymes and their mechanisms of action remain unknown. In the present study, we solve the crystal structures of the active CMTr1 catalytic domain in complex with a methyl group donor and a capped oligoribonucleotide, thereby revealing the mechanism of specific recognition of capped RNA. This mechanism differs significantly from viral enzymes, thus providing a framework for their specific targeting. Based on the crystal structure of CMTr1, a comparative model of the CMTr2 catalytic domain is generated. This model, together with mutational analysis, leads to the identification of residues involved in RNA and methyl group donor binding. 
Intestinal metaplasia (IM) is a biologically interesting and clinically relevant condition in which one differentiated type of epithelium is replaced by another that is morphologically similar to normal intestinal epithelium. Two classic examples of this are gastric IM and Barrett's esophagus (BE). In both, a chronic inflammatory microenvironment, provoked either by Helicobacter pylori infection of the stomach or acid and bile reflux into the esophagus, precedes the metaplasia. The Caudal-related homeodomain transcription factors Cdx1 and Cdx2 are critical regulators of the normal intestinal epithelial cell phenotype. Ectopic expression of Cdx1 and Cdx2 occurs in both gastric IM as well as in BE. This expression precedes the onset of the metaplasia and implies a causal role for these factors in this process. We review the observations regarding the role of chronic inflammation and the Cdx transcription factors in the pathogenesis of gastric IM and BE.
Metaplasia is the conversion of one cell or tissue type to another and can predispose patients to neoplasia. Perhaps one of the best-known examples of metaplasia is Barrett's metaplasia (BM), a pathological condition in which the distal oesophageal epithelium switches from stratified squamous to intestinal-type columnar epithelium. BM predisposes to oesophageal adenocarcinoma and is the consequence of long-term acid bile reflux. The incidence of BM and oesophageal adenocarcinoma has risen dramatically in recent years. A key event in the pathogenesis of BM is the induction of oesophageal CDX2 expression. Importantly, recent data reveal the molecular mechanisms that link inflammation in the development of Barrett's metaplasia, CDX2 and the progression to cancer. This review highlights the relationship between inflammation, metaplasia and carcinogenesis.
Barrett's esophagus is a premalignant condition whereby the normal stratified squamous esophageal epithelium undergoes a transdifferentiation program resulting in a simple columnar epithelium reminiscent of the small intestine. These changes are typically associated with the stratified squamous epithelium chronically exposed to acid and bile salts as a result of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Despite this well-defined epidemiologic association between acid reflux and Barrett's esophagus, the genetic changes that induce this transdifferentiation process in esophageal keratinocytes have remained undefined.
To begin to identify the genetic changes responsible for transdifferentiaiton in Barrett's esophagus, we performed a microarray analysis of normal esophageal, Barrett's esophagus and small intestinal biopsy specimens to identify candidate signaling pathways and transcription factors that may be involved. Through this screen we identified the Cdx1 homeodomain transcription factor and the c-myc pathway as possible candidates. Cdx1 and c-myc were then tested for their ability to induce transdifferentiation in immortalized human esophageal keratinocytes using organotypic culturing methods. Analyses of these cultures reveal that c-myc and cdx1 cooperate to induce mucin production and changes in keratin expression that are observed in the epithelium of Barrett's esophagus.
These data demonstrate the ability of Cdx1 and c-myc to initiate the earliest stages of transdifferentiation of esophageal keratinocytes toward a cell fate characteristic of Barrett's esophagus.
The caudal-related homeobox gene, CDX1, encodes for an intestinal-specific transcription factor and is involved in the induction of intestinal metaplasia (IM) of the stomach in gastric cancer. Gastric IM induced by bile reflux is a precancerous gastric adenocarcinomal lesion and has been associated with the induction of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2). In this study, we demonstrate the molecular mechanisms underlying the transcriptional regulation of COX-2 by bile acid in gastric cells. We noted that the ectopic expression of CDX1 enhanced COX-2 gene expression and that bile acid was associated with the induction of CDX1 expression. Furthermore, the induction of CDX1 by bile acid was mediated by the orphan nuclear receptor, small heterodimer partner (SHP). Finally, it was verified that the expression of COX-2, CDX1, SHP and CCAAT element-binding protein beta messenger RNA in human IM lesions were significantly higher than in lesions associated with gastritis. Collectively, these results reveal that bile acid induces an increase in the gene expression of COX-2 via the sequential transcriptional induction of SHP and CDX1 in precancerous lesions of human gastric cancer.
Barrett's esophagus (BE) is characterized by intestinal metaplasia with the differentiated epithelium replaced by another type of epithelium morphologically similar to normal intestinal epithelium. The metaplasia is preceded by bile and acid reflux into the esophagus. BE is a premalignant condition associated with increased risk of esophageal cancer, especially esophageal adenocarcinoma. The Caudal-related homeodomain transcription factors Caudal-related homeodomain transcription factor CDX1 and CDX2 are expressed exclusively in the small and large intestine, playing important roles in proliferation and differentiation of intestinal epithelial cells. Ectopic expression of CDX1 and CDX2 occurs in BE. The apical sodium-dependent bile acid transporter (ASBT) is expressed primarily in terminal ileum where it is a key factor for intestinal reabsorption of bile salts. In addition to upregulation of CDX1 and CDX2, ASBT expression is up-regulated in BE. Furthermore, both CDX1/CDX2 and ASBT expressions are down-regulated in high-grade esophageal dysplasia. The alteration of the above-mentioned factors calls for attention: what is the relationship between CDXs and ASBT aberrant expression in BE? In this commentary, we discuss this issue on basis of the recent study done by Ma et al.
Barrett's esophagus (BE) is an intestinal metaplasia that occurs in the setting of chronic acid and bile reflux and is associated with a risk for adenocarcinoma. Expression of intestine-specific transcription factors in the esophagus likely contributes to metaplasia development. Our objective was to explore the effects of an intestine-specific transcription factor when expressed in the mouse esophageal epithelium. Transgenic mice were derived in which the transcription factor Cdx2 is expressed in squamous epithelium using the murine Keratin-14 gene promoter. Effects of the transgene upon cell proliferation and differentiation, gene expression, and barrier integrity were explored. K14-Cdx2 mice express the Cdx2 transgene in esophageal squamous tissues. Cdx2 expression was associated with reduced basal epithelial cell proliferation and altered cell morphology. Ultrastructurally two changes were noted. Cdx2 expression was associated with dilated space between the basal cells and diminished cell-cell adhesion caused by reduced Desmocollin-3 mRNA and protein expression. This compromised epithelial barrier function, as the measured trans-epithelial electrical resistance (TEER) of the K14-Cdx2 epithelium was significantly reduced compared to controls (1189 Ohm*cm(2) ±343.5 to 508 Ohm*cm(2)±92.48, p = 0.0532). Secondly, basal cells with features of a transitional cell type, intermediate between keratinocytes and columnar Barrett's epithelial cells, were observed. These cells had reduced keratin bundles and increased endoplasmic reticulum levels, suggesting the adoption of secretory-cell features. Moreover, at the ultrastructural level they resembled "Distinctive" cells associated with multilayered epithelium. Treatment of the K14-Cdx2 mice with 5'-Azacytidine elicited expression of BE-associated genes including Cdx1, Krt18, and Slc26a3/Dra, suggesting the phenotype could be advanced under certain conditions. We conclude that ectopic Cdx2 expression in keratinocytes alters cell proliferation, barrier function, and differentiation. These altered cells represent a transitional cell type between normal squamous and columnar BE cells. The K14-Cdx2 mice represent a useful model to study progression from squamous epithelium to BE.
Oesophageal exposure to duodenogastroesophageal refluxate is implicated in the development of Barrett's metaplasia (BM), with increased risk of progression to oesophageal adenocarcinoma. The literature proposes that reflux exposure activates NF-κB, driving the aberrant expression of intestine-specific caudal-related homeobox (CDX) genes. However, early events in the pathogenesis of BM from normal epithelium are poorly understood. To investigate this, our study subjected a 3D model of the normal human oesophageal mucosa to repeated, pulsatile exposure to specific bile components and examined changes in gene expression. Initial 2D experiments with a range of bile salts observed that taurochenodeoxycholate (TCDC) impacted upon NF-κB activation without causing cell death. Informed by this, the 3D oesophageal model was repeatedly exposed to TCDC in the presence and absence of acid, and the epithelial cells underwent gene expression profiling. We identified ~300 differentially expressed genes following each treatment, with a large and significant overlap between treatments. Enrichment analysis (Broad GSEA, DAVID and Metacore™; GeneGo Inc) identified multiple gene sets related to cell signalling, inflammation, proliferation, differentiation and cell adhesion. Specifically NF-κB activation, Wnt signalling, cell adhesion and targets for the transcription factors PTF1A and HNF4α were highlighted. Our data suggest that HNF4α isoform switching may be an early event in Barrett's pathogenesis. CDX1/2 targets were, however, not enriched, suggesting that although CDX1/2 activation reportedly plays a role in BM development, it may not be an initial event. Our findings highlight new areas for investigation in the earliest stages of BM pathogenesis of oesophageal diseases and new potential therapeutic targets. 
Conventional adsorbents, namely zeolites and silica gel, are often used to control humidity by adsorbing water; however, adsorbents capable of the dual functionality of humidification and dehumidification, offering the desired control of the moisture level at room temperature, have yet to be explored. Here we report Y-shp-MOF-5, a hybrid microporous highly connected rare-earth-based metal-organic framework (MOF), with dual functionality for moisture control within the recommended range of relative humidity (45%-65% RH) set by the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE). Y-shp-MOF-5 exhibits exceptional structural integrity, robustness, and unique humidity-control performance, as confirmed by the large number (thousand) of conducted water vapor adsorption-desorption cycles. The retained structural integrity and the mechanism of water sorption were corroborated using in situ single-crystal X-ray diffraction (SCXRD) studies. The resultant working water uptake of 0.45 g·g-1 is solely regulated by a simple adjustment of the relative humidity, positioning this hydrolytically stable MOF as a prospective adsorbent for humidity control in confined spaces, such as space shuttles, aircraft cabins, and air-conditioned buildings.
To evaluate the construct validity of the Workers Productivity and Impairment Activity Index: Specific Health Problem (WPAI:SHP) in Australian systemic sclerosis (SSc) patients.
SSc patients, identified through the Australian Scleroderma Cohort Study database, completed the WPAI:SHP and a quality of life instrument (PROMIS-29) cross-sectionally. The construct validity of the WPAI:SHP was assessed by the correlations between the WPAI:SHP and a range of SSc health states. Non-parametric correlation, including Spearman's correlation (ρ), was used to test the validity of WPAI:SHP and ability to distinguish between different health states.
A total of 476 completed questionnaires was returned, equating to a response rate of 63.7%. Among those under 65 years of age, 155 patients (55.2%) were in paid employment. Employed patients had a mean (± SD) age of 56.5 (9.8) years and were predominantly female (87.3%) with limited disease subtype (75.6%). The WPAI:SHP showed construct validity based on moderate to strong correlations with health status as assessed by a range of health outcome measures including disease activity (ρ=0.34-0.39, p=0.001), physical function (ρ=0.55-0.62, p=0.001), disease severity(ρ=0.55-0.62, p=0.001), fatigue (ρ= 0.62-0.63, p=0.001), pain (ρ=0.68-0.71, p=0.001), and breathlessness (ρ=0.39-0.46, p=0.001). Furthermore, according to the effect size, the WPAI:SHP scores have a large discriminative ability (d=1.26-1.47) for distinguishing SSc patients with different health outcomes.
The WPAI is a valid questionnaire for assessing impairments in paid employment and social activities in SSc patients, and for measuring the relative differences between SSc patients with varying health states.
Superhydrophobic (SHP) coatings inspired by lotus have great application prospect for our daily life. Regrettably, three formidable challenges, namely, complex fabrication, weak mechanical stability and large-scale fabrication, have already existed for a long time in this research field. Here, a robust micro-nanoscale P25 (Nano TiO2)/MgO/epoxy resin (ER) SHP coating has been fabricated via facile one-pot route, which can be applied to arbitrary substrates through multiples methods. P25/MgO/ER SHP coating not only displays excellent mechanical stability but also shows unique repairable ability to recover its superhydrophobicity under various damages by extreme environment such as low temperature, strong acid or alkali and this repairable process can be repeated for many times. P25/MgO/ER SHP coating also is easy to large-scale fabrication with very low cost.
We previously reported that early-stage gastric diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (DLBCLs), including DLBCLs with mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (DLBCL[MALT]) and without ("pure" DLBCL) the features of MALT lymphomas, can achieve long-term complete remission after frontline Helicobacter pylori (HP) eradication (HPE). We recently reported that expression of cytotoxin-associated gene A (CagA) and CagA-signaling molecules (phospho-Src homology-2 domain-containing phosphatase [p-SHP2] and phospho-extracellular signal-regulated kinase [p-ERK]) is associated with HP dependence of gastric MALT lymphoma. However, the significance of CagA and CagA-signaling molecules in gastric DLBCL remains unexplored. The association between expression of CagA, p-SHP-2, and p-ERK in malignant B cells and tumor response to HPE was evaluated in 63 patients with stage IE/IIE1 HP-positive gastric DLBCL who received HPE as frontline treatment. We detected CagA expression in 20 of 42 DLBCL (MALT) cases (47.6%) and in 13 of 21 "pure" DLBCL cases (61.9%). CagA expression was higher in HP-dependent tumors than in HP-independent tumors (74.3% [26 of 35] vs 25.0% [7 of 28]). Patients with CagA expression responded to HPE quicker than those without expression (median time to complete remission, 4.0 months vs 5.0 months). The expression of CagA was closely associated with p-SHP-2 and p-ERK expression. Combined CagA, p-SHP-2, and p-ERK expression showed an increased positive predictive value (81.8% vs 75.9%) and an increased specificity (84.0% vs 75.0%) for HP dependence compared with CagA expression alone. Our results indicated that CagA and its signaling molecules can be detected in the malignant B cells of gastric DLBCL, and the expression of these molecules is clinically and biologically associated with HP dependence.
Self-reactive B cells are tolerized at various stages of B-cell development and differentiation, including the immature B-cell stage (central tolerance) and the germinal center (GC) B-cell stage, and B-cell tolerance involves various mechanisms such as deletion, anergy, and receptor editing. Self-reactive B cells generated by random immunoglobulin variable gene rearrangements are tolerized by central tolerance and anergy in the periphery, and these processes involve apoptosis regulated by Bim, a pro-apoptotic member of the Bcl-2 family, and regulation of B-cell signaling by various phosphatases, including SHIP-1 and SHP-1. Self-reactive B cells generated by somatic mutations during GC reaction are also eliminated. Fas is not directly involved in this process but prevents persistence of GC reaction that allows generation of less stringently regulated B cells, including self-reactive B cells. Defects in self-tolerance preferentially cause lupus-like disease with production of anti-nuclear antibodies, probably due to the presence of a large potential B-cell repertoire reactive to nucleic acids and the presence of nucleic acid-induced activation mechanisms in various immune cells, including B cells and dendritic cells. A feed-forward loop composed of anti-nuclear antibodies produced by B cells and type 1 interferons secreted from nucleic acid-activated dendritic cells plays a crucial role in the development of systemic lupus erythematosus.
To investigate acute care hospitals' adoption speed of patient engagement health information technology (HIT) functionalities from 2008 to 2013 and how this speed is contingent on environmental factors and hospital characteristics.
Data on non-government acute care hospitals located in the United States was obtained from merging three databases: the American Hospital Association's (AHA) annual survey information technology supplement, AHA annual survey, and the Area Health Resource File (AHRF). The variables obtained from these datasets were the amount of annually adopted patient engagement HIT functionalities and environmental and organizational characteristics. Environmental factors included were uncertainty, munificence, and complexity. Hospital characteristics included size, system membership, ownership, and teaching status.
A regression analysis of 4176 hospital-year observations revealed a positive trend in the adoption of HIT functionalities for patient engagement (β= 1.109, p &lt; 0.05). Moreover, the study showed that large, system-affiliated, not-for-profit, teaching hospitals adopt patient engagement HIT functionalities at a faster speed than their counterparts. Environmental munificence and uncertainty were also associated with an accelerating speed of adoption. Environmental complexity however did not show a significant impact on the speed of adoption.
From 2008 to 2013, there was a significant acceleration in the speed of adopting patient engagement HIT functionalities. Further efforts should be made to ensure proper adoption and consistent use by patients in order to reap the benefits of these IT investments.
Hospitals adopted at least one HIT functionality for patient engagement per year. The adoption speed varied across hospitals, depending on both environmental and organizational factors.
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the main primary cancer of the liver. Many studies have shown that insulin resistance is a risk factor for HCC. We previously discovered the overexpression and oncogenic role of the Reptin/RUVBL2 ATPase in HCC. Here, we found that Reptin silencing enhanced insulin sensitivity in 2 HCC cell lines, as shown by a large potentiation of insulin-induced AKT phosphorylation on Ser473 and Thr308, and of downstream signalling. Reptin silencing did not affect the tyrosine phosphorylation of the insulin receptor nor of IRS1, but it enhanced the tyrosine phosphorylation of the p85 subunit of PI3K. The expression of the SHP-1/PTPN6 phosphatase, which dephosphorylates p85, was reduced after Reptin depletion. Forced expression of SHP-1 restored a normal AKT phosphorylation after insulin treatment in cells where Reptin was silenced, demonstrating that the downregulation of SHP1 is mechanistically linked to increased Akt phosphorylation. In conclusion, we have uncovered a new function for Reptin in regulating insulin signalling in HCC cells via the regulation of SHP-1 expression. We suggest that the regulation of insulin sensitivity by Reptin contributes to its oncogenic action in the liver.
Although the impacts of large dams on freshwater biota are relatively well known, the effects of small hydropower plants (SHP) are not well investigated. In this work, we studied if mercury (Hg) concentrations in fish rise in two tropical SHP reservoirs, and whether similar effects take place during impoundment. Total Hg concentrations in several fish species were determined at two SHP in the Upper Guaporé River basin floodplain, Brazil. In total, 185 specimens were analysed for Hg content in dorsal muscle and none of them reported levels above the safety limit (500 μg kg-1) for fish consumption recommended by the World Health Organisation (WHO). The highest levels of Hg (231 and 447 μg kg-1) were found in carnivorous species in both reservoirs. Mercury increased as a function of standard length in most of the fish populations in the reservoirs, and higher Hg concentrations were found in fish at the reservoir compared with fish downstream. The high dissolved oxygen concentrations and high transparency of the water column (i.e. oligotrophic reservoir) together with the absence of thermal stratification may explain low Hg methylation and low MeHg levels found in fish after flooding. Overall, according to limnological characteristics of water, we may hypothesise that reservoir conditions are not favourable to high net Hg methylation.
Microbes communicate with each other by using quorum sensing (QS) systems and modulate their collective 'behavior' for in-host colonization and virulence, biofilm formation, and environmental adaptation. The recent increase in genome data availability reveals the presence of several putative QS sensing circuits in microbial pathogens, but many of these have not been functionally characterized yet, despite their possible utility as drug targets. To increase the repertoire of functionally characterized QS systems in bacteria, we studied Rgg144/Shp144 and Rgg939/Shp939, two putative QS systems in the important human pathogen Streptococcus pneumoniae. We find that both of these QS circuits are induced by short hydrophobic peptides (Shp) upon sensing sugars found in the respiratory tract, such as galactose and mannose. Microarray analyses using cultures grown on mannose and galactose revealed that the expression of a large number of genes is controlled by these QS systems, especially those encoding for essential physiological functions and virulence-related genes such as the capsular locus. Moreover, the array data revealed evidence for cross-talk between these systems. Finally, these Rgg systems play a key role in colonization and virulence, as deletion mutants of these QS systems are attenuated in the mouse models of colonization and pneumonia.
Despite its low cellular abundance, phosphotyrosine (pTyr) regulates numerous cell signaling pathways in health and disease. We applied comprehensive phosphoproteomics to unravel differential regulators of receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK)-initiated signaling networks upon activation by Pdgf-ββ, Fgf-2, or Igf-1 and identified more than 40,000 phosphorylation sites, including many phosphotyrosine sites without additional enrichment. The analysis revealed RTK-specific regulation of hundreds of pTyr sites on key signaling molecules. We found the tyrosine phosphatase Shp-2 to be the master regulator of Pdgfr pTyr signaling. Application of a recently introduced allosteric Shp-2 inhibitor revealed global regulation of the Pdgf-dependent tyrosine phosphoproteome, which significantly impaired cell migration. In addition, we present a list of hundreds of Shp-2-dependent targets and putative substrates, including Rasa1 and Cortactin with increased pTyr and Gab1 and Erk1/2 with decreased pTyr. Our study demonstrates that large-scale quantitative phosphoproteomics can precisely dissect tightly regulated kinase-phosphatase signaling networks.
The aim of the present study was to identify the signaling mechanism(s) responsible for the modulation of growth hormone secretagogue receptor type 1a (GHSR1a)-associated Akt activity. Ghrelin leads to the activation of Akt through the interplay of distinct signaling mechanisms: an early G(i/o) protein-dependent pathway and a late pathway mediated by β-arrestins. We found that the Src homology 2-containing protein tyrosine phosphatase (SHP-1) was an essential molecule in both G(i/o) protein-dependent and β-arrestin-mediated pathways. More specifically, the role of SHP-1 in the G(i/o) protein-dependent pathway was demonstrated by the fact that the overexpression of a catalytically defective SHP-1 augments tyrosine phosphorylation of the PI3K regulatory subunit p85, leading to an increase in the phosphorylation of cSrc and phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1, and finally activating Akt. The presence of SHP-1 in the β-arrestin-scaffolded complex and its attenuating effect on the cSrc and Akt activities verified that SHP-1 regulates not only the G(i/o) protein-dependent pathway but also the β-arrestin-mediated pathway. Assays performed in preadipocyte and adipocyte 3T3-L1 cells showed SHP-1 expression. According to our results in HEK-GHSR1a cells, ghrelin stimulated SHP-1 phosphorylation in 3T3-L1 cells. The increase in ghrelin-induced Akt activity was enhanced by small interfering RNA of SHP-1 in preadipocyte 3T3-L1 cells. These results were reproduced in white adipose tissue obtained from mice, in which SHP-1 exhibited higher expression in omental than in subcutaneous tissue. Furthermore, this pattern of expression was inverted in mice fed a high-fat diet, suggesting a role for SHP-1 in controlling ghrelin sensitivity in adipose tissue. Indeed, SHP-1 deficiency was associated with augmented ghrelin-evoked Akt phosphorylation in omental tissue, as well as decreased phosphorylation under overexpression of SHP-1 in subcutaneous tissue. These findings showed a novel role for SHP-1 in the regulation of Akt activity through the modulation of the ghrelin/GHSR1a system signaling.
To determine wether there were connections among hepatocyte nuclear factor-1 alfa (HNF-1a), liver receptor homolog-1 (LRH-1), apolipoprotein M (apoM) and to investigate the effects of HNF-1a in HepG2 on the expressions of apoM, apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I) and the key enzymes in cholesterol metabolism and biotransformation. The mRNA expressions of apoM, LRH-1 and HNF-1a were detected by RT-PCR. HNF-1a was interfered and RT-PCR was used to detect the changes of apo M, apo A-I, Cyp7A1, farnesoid X receptor (FXR) and small heterodimer partner-1 (SHP-1). Western blot was used to detect the change of apo M protein. The expressions of apoM, LRH-1 and HNF-1amRNA were obviously higher in HCC tissue than that in para-cancer tissue (the vaule of t is -7.167, -7.075, -8.803, P less than 0.01 respectively). HNF-1a and LRH-1 positively correlated with the expression of apoM (r=0.353, P less than 0.01; r=0.523, P less than 0.01 respectively); RT-PCR and western blot results showed that the expressions of apoM, FXR and SHP-1 mRNA, could be obviously suppressed by HNF-1a interfering as compared to the negative controls by 47.4%, 47.9%and 65.2% (P less than 0.01) respectively, and the expression of apoM protein also decreased by 54.3% (F = 43.482, P less than 0.01). The expressions of HMGCR and CYP7A mRNA increased by 101.1% and 138.5% (P less than 0.01) respectively as compared to the negative control. But there is no effect on expression of apoA-I mRNA (F = 0.170, P more than 0.05). HNF-1a could promote cholesterol biotransformation by increasing the expression of apoM and the key enzymes in cholesterol metabolism and decreasing inhibiting factor. So HNF-1a provided protection against cardiovascular disease. 
Protein tyrosine phosphatase SHP-1 is an essential regulatory molecule in many different signaling pathways. The biological importance of SHP-1 is underscored by the motheaten mutant mouse strains with immunological disorders involving multiple organs and by the close association of aberrant SHP-1 expression with several human diseases. Recent studies provided some compelling evidence that supports a role of SHP-1 in regulating mast cell development and function and also in regulating type 2 allergic inflammatory responses in both innate and adaptive immune responses. In this article, we summarize the recent advancement of our understanding of this interesting phosphatase in the important area of allergic inflammation.
The purpose of the present study is to evaluate the effects of arsenic trioxide (ATO) on human acute promyelocytic leukemia NB-4 cells. Microculture tetrazolium test, bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) cell proliferation assay, caspase 3 activity assay, cell-based nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB) phosphorylation measurement by ELISA and real-time RT-PCR were employed to appraise the effects of ATO on metabolic activity, DNA synthesis, induction of programmed cell death and NF-kappaB activation. The suppressive effects of ATO on metabolic potential, cell proliferation and NF-kappaB activation were associated with induction of apoptosis in NB-4 cells. In addition, an expressive enhancement in mRNA levels of p73, cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1A (p21), tumor protein 53-induced nuclear protein 1 (TP53INP1), WNK lysine deficient protein kinase 2 (WNK2) and lipocalin 2 coupled with a significant reduction in transcriptional levels of NF-kappaB inhibitor beta (IKK2), Nemo, BCL2-like 1 (BCL-X(L)), inhibitor of apoptosis protein 1 (cIAP2), X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP), survivin, Bcl-2, TIP60, ataxia telangiectasia (ATM), SHP-2 and sirtuin (SIRT1) were observed. Altogether, these issues show for the first time that ATO treatment could trammel cell growth and proliferation as well as induces apoptosis in NB-4 cells through induction of transcriptional levels of p73, TP53INP1, WNK2, lipocalin 2 as well as suppression of NF-kappaB-mediated induction of BCL-X(L), cIAP2, XIAP and survivin. Furthermore, the inductionary effects of ATO on transcriptional stimulation of p73 might be through cramping the NF-kappaB module (through suppression of p65 phosphorylation as well as transcriptional hindering of IKK2, ATM and Nemo) along with diminishing the mRNA expression of TIP60, SHP-2 and SIRT1.
The recently recognized importance of B cells in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) raises the question as to whether those expressing CD5 predominate over the remaining B lymphocytes in the pathophysiology of this disease. Owing to their B B-cell receptor (BCR) polyspecificity, autoantibody production has been originally ascribed to CD5-positive B1 lymphocytes. Instead, it has since been established that high-affinity autoantibodies derive from CD5-negative B2 cells. Even worse, in the light of current findings, CD5-positive B cells have been considered to play a paradoxical role in preventing, rather than inducing, autoimmunity. In this context, there is evidence that the membrane expression of CD5 is regulated, and, to this end, a genetic mechanism has been described, based on the selection between exon 1A (E1A) and exon 1B (E1B). The full-length protein variant, encoded by E1A-cd5, translocates the phosphatase SHP-1 to the vicinity of the BCR, raises its threshold, and thereby limits the response of autoreactive B cells. In contrast, the truncated variant, encoded by E1B-cd5, remains in the cytoplasm, along with SHP1. Normally, EIB E1B is silenced by methylation and its product degraded in the proteosomes. Hence, a defect in the DNA methyl transfer favors the development of SLE, by preventing the effects of SHP-1.
Signal transduction from the BCR is regulated by the equilibrium between kinases (e.g., spleen tyrosine kinase [Syk]) and phosphatases (e.g., Shp-1). Previous studies showed that Syk-deficient B cells have a developmental block at the pro/pre-B cell stage, whereas a B cell-specific Shp-1 deficiency promoted B-1a cell development and led to autoimmunity. We generated B cell-specific Shp-1 and Syk double-knockout (DKO) mice and compared them to the single-knockout mice deficient for either Syk or Shp-1. Unlike Syk-deficient mice, the DKO mice can generate mature B cells, albeit at &gt;20-fold reduced B cell numbers. The DKO B-2 cells are all Syk-negative, whereas the peritoneal B1 cells of the DKO mice still express Syk, indicating that they require this kinase for their proper development. The DKO B-2 cells cannot be stimulated via the BCR, whereas they are efficiently activated via TLR or CD40. We also found that in DKO pre-B cells, the kinase Zap70 is associated with the pre-BCR, suggesting that Zap70 is important to promote B cell maturation in the absence of Syk and SHP-1. Together, our data show that a properly balanced kinase/phosphatase equilibrium is crucial for normal B cell development and function. 
B-1 cells constitute a unique subset of B cells identified in several species including mice and humans. B-1 cells are further subdivided into B-1a and B-1b subsets as the former but not the later express CD5. The B-1a subset contributes to innate type of immune responses while the B-1b B cell subset contributes to adaptive responses. B-1 cell responses to B cell receptor (BCR) as well as Toll-like receptor (TLR) ligation are tightly regulated due to the cross-reactivity of antigen specific receptors on B-1 cells to self-antigens. B-1 cells are elevated in several autoimmune diseases. CD5 plays a major role in down regulation of BCR responses in the B-1a cell subset. Reduced amplification of BCR induced signals via CD19 and autoregulation of BCR and TLR responses by B-1 cell produced IL-10 appear to have a role in regulation of both B-1a and B-1b B cell responses. Siglec G receptors and Lyn kinase also regulate B-1 cell responses but their differential role in the two B-1 cell subsets is unknown.
Short heterodimer partner (SHP) is an orphan nuclear receptor that interacts with ER(alpha) and ERbeta and inhibits E2-induced transcription. We examined how SHP affects tamoxifen's estrogen agonist activity in endometrial cells. We report that SHP interacts with 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4-OHT) or E2-occupied ER(alpha) in a temperature-dependent manner in vitro. In transient transfection assays, SHP inhibited 4-OHT-stimulated reporter gene activity from an estrogen response element (ERE) in ER-positive RL95-2 but not in HEC-1A human endometrial carcinoma cells transfected with ER(alpha) or ERbeta. SHP inhibited E2-induced transcriptional activity in ER(alpha)- or ERbeta-transfected HEC-1A or Chinese hamster ovary-K1 cells. SHP inhibition of E2 activity was greater for ER(alpha) than ERbeta from the nonpalindromic ERE in the pS2 gene promoter in Chinese hamster ovary-K1 but not HEC-1A cells. Thus, ER subtype, cell type, and ERE sequence influence SHP repressor activity. An ER(alpha) mutant lacking activator function-1 showed reduced inhibition by SHP. In glutathione S-transferase pull-down experiments, SHP inhibited ER(alpha) dimerization, providing a possible mechanism to account for the inhibitory effect of SHP on ER activity. These results identify SHP as novel target for blocking 4-OHT agonist activity in endometrial cells.
During the third trimester of pregnancy, there is an increase in serum triglyceride and cholesterol levels. The mechanisms accounting for these changes in lipid metabolism during pregnancy are unknown. We hypothesized that, during pregnancy, the expression of nuclear hormone receptors involved in regulating lipid metabolism would decrease. In 19-day pregnant mice, serum triglyceride and non-HDL cholesterol levels were significantly increased, whereas total cholesterol was slightly decreased, because of a decrease in the HDL fraction. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)alpha, PPARbeta/delta, and PPARgamma, liver X receptor (LXR)alpha and LXRbeta, farnesoid X receptor (FXR), and retinoid X receptor (RXR)alpha, RXRbeta, and RXRgamma mRNA levels were significantly decreased in the livers of 19-day pregnant mice. Additionally, the expressions of thyroid receptor (TR)alpha, pregnane X receptor, sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBP)-1a, SREBP-1c, SREBP-2, and liver receptor homolog 1 were also decreased, whereas the expression of TRbeta, constitutive androstane receptor, and hepatic nuclear factor 4 showed no significant change. mRNA levels of the PPAR target genes carnitine-palmitoyl transferase 1alpha and acyl-CoA oxidase, the LXR target genes SREBP1c, ATP-binding cassettes G5 and G8, the FXR target gene SHP, and the TR target genes malic enzyme and Spot14 were all significantly decreased. Finally, the expressions of PPARgamma coactivator (PGC)-1alpha and PGC-1beta, known activators of a number of nuclear hormone receptors, were also significantly decreased. The decreases in expression of RXRs, PPARs, LXRs, FXR, TRs, SREBPs, and PGC-1s could contribute to the alterations in lipid metabolism during late pregnancy.
The small heterodimer partner (SHP) is an atypical nuclear receptor lacking the N-terminal ligand-independent activation domain and the DNA binding domain. SHP acts as transcriptional inhibitor of a large set of nuclear receptors, among which ER, AR, CAR, RXR, GR, LXR and ERRgamma. The repression mechanism of SHP involves several actions including competition with coactivators binding on the AF-2 of nuclear receptors and recruitment of transcriptional inhibitors such as EID-1. The investigation of the structure and repression mechanism of SHP is a challenging task for a full understanding of nuclear receptor interaction pathways and functions. So far, mutational analyses in multiple populations identified loss of function mutants of SHP gene involved in mild obesity, increased birth weight and insulin levels. Furthermore, experimental mutagenesis has been exploited to characterize the interactions between SHP and the transcriptional inhibitor EID-1. With the aim of gaining insight into the structural basis of SHP repression mechanism, we modelled SHP and EID-1 structures. Docking experiments were carried out to identify the EID-1 binding surface on SHP structure. The results obtained in this study allow for the first time a unique interpretation of many experimental data available from the published literature. In addition, a fascinating hypothesis raises from the inspection of the proposed SHP structure: the presence of a potential unexpected ligand binding site, supported by recently available experimental data that may represent a breakthrough in the design and development of synthetic modulators of SHP functions.
Nuclear orphan receptors represent a large and diverse subgroup in the nuclear receptor superfamily. Although putative ligands for these orphan members remain to be identified, some of these receptors possess intrinsic activating, inhibitory, or dual regulatory functions in development, differentiation, homeostasis, and reproduction. In particular, gene-silencing events elicited by chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter-transcription factors (COUP-TFs); dosage-sensitive sex reversal-adrenal hypoplasia congenita critical region on the X chromosome, gene 1 (DAX-1); germ cell nuclear factor (GCNF); short heterodimer partner (SHP); and testicular receptors 2 and 4 (TR2 and TR4) are among the best characterized. These orphan receptors are critical in controlling basal activities or hormonal responsiveness of numerous target genes. They employ multiple and distinct mechanisms to mediate target gene repression. Complex cross-talk exists between these orphan receptors at their cognate DNA binding elements and an array of steroid?nonsteroid hormone receptors, other transcriptional activators, coactivators and corepressors, histone modification enzyme complexes, and components of basal transcriptional components. Therefore, perturbation induced by these orphan receptors at multiple levels, including DNA binding activities, receptor homo- or heterodimerization, recruitment of cofactor proteins, communication with general transcriptional machinery, and changes at histone acetylation status and chromatin structures, may contribute to silencing of target gene expression in a specific promoter or cell-type context. Moreover, the findings derived from gene-targeting studies have demonstrated the significance of these orphan receptors' function in physiologic settings. Thus, COUP-TFs, DAX-1, GCNF, SHP, and TR2 and 4 are known to be required for multiple physiologic and biologic functions, including neurogenesis and development of the heart and vascular system steroidogenesis and sex determination, gametogenesis and embryonic development, and cholesterol?lipid homeostasis.
SHP (small heterodimer partner) is a well-known NR (nuclear receptor) co-regulator. In the present study, we have identified a new SHP-interacting protein, termed SMILE (SHP-interacting leucine zipper protein), which was previously designated as ZF (Zhangfei) via a yeast two-hybrid system. We have determined that the SMILE gene generates two isoforms [SMILE-L (long isoform of SMILE) and SMILE-S (short isoform of SMILE)]. Mutational analysis has demonstrated that the SMILE isoforms arise from the alternative usage of initiation codons. We have confirmed the in vivo interaction and co-localization of the SMILE isoforms and SHP. Domain-mapping analysis indicates that the entire N-terminus of SHP and the middle region of SMILE-L are involved in this interaction. Interestingly, the SMILE isoforms counteract the SHP repressive effect on the transactivation of ERs (estrogen receptors) in HEK-293T cells (human embryonic kidney cells expressing the large T-antigen of simian virus 40), but enhance the SHP-repressive effect in MCF-7, T47D and MDA-MB-435 cells. Knockdown of SMILE gene expression using siRNA (small interfering RNA) in MCF-7 cells increases ER-mediated transcriptional activity. Moreover, adenovirus-mediated overexpression of SMILE and SHP down-regulates estrogen-induced mRNA expression of the critical cell-cycle regulator E2F1. Collectively, these results indicate that SMILE isoforms regulate the inhibition of ER transactivation by SHP in a cell-type-specific manner and act as a novel transcriptional co-regulator in ER signalling.
The small heterodimer partner (SHP, nuclear receptor subfamily 0, group B, member 2; NR0B2) is an atypical nuclear receptor known mainly for its role in bile acid homeostasis in the enterohepatic tract. We previously showed that NR0B2 controls testicular functions such as testosterone synthesis. Moreover, NR0B2 mediates the deleterious testicular effects of estrogenic endocrine disruptors leading to infertility. The endocrine homeostasis is essential for health, because it controls many physiological functions. This is supported by a large number of studies demonstrating that alterations of steroid activity lead to several kinds of diseases such as obesity and infertility. Within the testis, the functions of the Leydig cells are mainly controlled by the hypothalamo-pituitary axis via LH/chorionic gonadotropin (CG). Here, we show that LH/CG represses Nr0b2 expression through the protein kinase A-AMP protein kinase pathway. Moreover, using a transgenic mouse model invalidated for Nr0b2, we point out that NR0B2 mediates the repression of testosterone synthesis and subsequent germ cell apoptosis induced by exposure to anti-GnRH compound. Together, our data demonstrate a new link between hypothalamo-pituitary axis and NR0B2 in testicular androgen metabolism, making NR0B2 a major actor of testicular physiology in case of alteration of LH/CG levels.
1alpha,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D(3) (1,25(OH)(2)D(3)), a natural ligand of the vitamin D receptor (VDR), was found to increase the rat ileal Asbt and bile acid absorption. The effects of VDR, whose expression is low in liver, on hepatic transporters and enzymes are unknown. Protein and mRNA levels of target genes in the small intestine, colon and liver after intraperitoneal dosing of 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) (0-2.56 nmol/kg/day for 4 days) to the rat were determined by Western blotting and qPCR, respectively. The 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) treatment increased total Cyp3a protein and Cyp3a1 mRNA expressions in the proximal small intestine, and the short heterodimer partner (SHP), the fibroblast growth factor 15 (FGF15), organic solute transporter (Ostalpha and Ostbeta) mRNA and Asbt protein expressions in the ileum. About 50% higher portal bile acid concentration (65.1+/-14.9 vs 41.9+/-7.8 microm, p&lt;0.05) and elevated expressions of the hepatic farnesoid X receptor (FXR) and SHP mRNA resulted with 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) treatment. Increased Bsep and Ostalpha mRNA expressions in liver and a&gt;50% reduction in the Cyp7a1 protein level (p&lt;0.05) and cholesterol metabolism in rat liver microsomes (p=0.002), likely consequences of the bile acid-FXR-SHP cascade and activation of the signaling pathway for Cyp7a1 inhibition by FGF15, were found. Increased hepatic multidrug resistance-associated protein (Mrp3) and multidrug resistance protein 1a (Mdr1a) mRNA and P-gp protein were also observed. It was concluded that the changes in hepatic transporters and enzymes in the rat were indirect, secondary effects of the liver FXR-SHP cascade due to increased intestinal absorption of bile acids and elevated levels of FGF15, events that led to the activation of FXR.
Hypertriglyceridemia is an independent risk factor in the development of cardiovascular diseases, and we have previously reported that oral administration of a grape seed procyanidin extract (GSPE) drastically decreases plasma levels of triglycerides (TG) and apolipoprotein B (ApoB) in normolipidemic rats, with a concomitant induction in the hepatic expression of the nuclear receptor small heterodimer partner (NR0B2/SHP). Our objective in this study was to elucidate whether SHP is the mediator of the reduction of TG-rich ApoB-containing lipoproteins triggered by GSPE. We show that GSPE inhibited TG and ApoB secretion in human hepatocarcinoma HepG2 cells and had and hypotriglyceridemic effect in wild-type mouse. The TG-lowering action of GSPE was abolished in HepG2 cells transfected with a SHP-specific siRNA and in a SHP-null mouse. Moreover, in mouse liver, GSPE downregulated several lipogenic genes, including steroid response element binding protein 1c (SREBP-1c), and upregulated carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1A (CPT-1A) and apolipoprotein A5 (ApoA5), in a SHP-dependent manner. In HepG2 cells GSPE also inhibited ApoB secretion, but in a SHP-independent manner. In conclusion, SHP is a key mediator of the hypotriglyceridemic response triggered by GSPE. This novel signaling pathway of procyanidins through SHP may be relevant to explain the health effects ascribed to the regular consumption of dietary flavonoids.
Previous studies showed glucose and insulin signaling can regulate bile acid (BA) metabolism during fasting or feeding. However, limited knowledge is available on the effect of calorie restriction (CR), a well-known anti-aging intervention, on BA homeostasis. To address this, the present study utilized a "dose-response" model of CR, where male C57BL/6 mice were fed 0, 15, 30, or 40% CR diets for one month, followed by BA profiling in various compartments of the enterohepatic circulation by UPLC-MS/MS technique. This study showed that 40% CR increased the BA pool size (162%) as well as total BAs in serum, gallbladder, and small intestinal contents. In addition, CR "dose-dependently" increased the concentrations of tauro-cholic acid (TCA) and many secondary BAs (produced by intestinal bacteria) in serum, such as tauro-deoxycholic acid (TDCA), DCA, lithocholic acid, ω-muricholic acid (ωMCA), and hyodeoxycholic acid. Notably, 40% CR increased TDCA by over 1000% (serum, liver, and gallbladder). Interestingly, 40% CR increased the proportion of 12α-hydroxylated BAs (CA and DCA), which correlated with improved glucose tolerance and lipid parameters. The CR-induced increase in BAs correlated with increased expression of BA-synthetic (Cyp7a1) and conjugating enzymes (BAL), and the ileal BA-binding protein (Ibabp). These results suggest that CR increases BAs in male mice possibly through orchestrated increases in BA synthesis and conjugation in liver as well as intracellular transport in ileum. 
Changes in bile acid (BA) metabolism and gallbladder function are critical factors in the pathogenesis of gallstones. Patients with hypertriglyceridemia (HTG) - often overweight and insulin resistant - are at risk for gallstone disease. The question arises whether HTG itself contributes to gallstone formation or whether gallstone disease only associates with this disorder. Triglycerides are formed in response to fluxes of non-esterified fatty acids and glucose. Hypertriglyceridemia results from either overproduction of triglycerides by the liver, impaired lipolysis or a combination of both. Hyperinsulinemia, as observed in the insulin resistant state, stimulates very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL)-triglyceride synthesis. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs), liver X receptors (LXRs), farnesoid X receptor (FXR) and hepatocyte nuclear factor 4α (HNF4α) are the nuclear receptors involved in the regulation of lipogenesis. Microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP) is involved in the production of VLDL and its activation is also under control of transcription factors as FXR and Forkhead box-O1 (FoxO1). Triglyceride and BA metabolism are linked. There is an inverse relationship between bile acid fluxes and pool size and VLDL production and SHP (small heterodimer partner) and FXR are the link between BAs and TG metabolism. BAs are also ligands for FXR and G-protein-coupled receptors, such as TGR5. FXR activation by BAs suppresses the expression of MTP, transcription factor sterol regulatory element binding protein (SREBP)-1c and other lipogenic genes. LXRs stimulate lipogenesis whereas FXRs inhibit the metabolic process. Synthesis of BAs from cholesterol occurs either via the classical pathway (7α-hydroxylation of cholesterol; CYP7A1) or via the alternate pathway (CYP39A1 or CYP7B1). BAs induce FXR, which inhibits CYP7A1 transcription by activation of SHP and inhibition of HNF4α transactivation. Bile composition (supersaturation with cholesterol), gallbladder dysmotility, inflammation, hypersecretion of mucin gel in the gallbladder and slow large intestinal motility and increased intestinal cholesterol absorption may contribute to the pathogenesis of cholesterol gallstones. In HTG patients supersaturated bile may be related to the presence of obesity rather than to HTG itself. Contraction and relaxation of the gallbladder are regulated by neuronal, hormonal and paracrine factors. Postprandial gallbladder emptying is regulated by cholecystokinin (CCK). Poor postprandial gallbladder contraction may be due to the magnitude of the CCK response and to the amount of CCK receptors in the gallbladder smooth muscle cells. In the fasting state gallbladder motility is associated with the intestinal migrating motor complex (MMC) activity and with elevated plasma motilin levels. Fibroblast growth factor (FGF19), produced on arrival of bile acids in the ileum, is also important for gallbladder motility. Gallbladder motility is impaired in HTG patients compared to BMI matched controls. There is evidence that the gallbladder in HTG is less sensitive to CCK and that this sensitivity improves after reversal of high serum TG levels by use of TG lowering agents. In hypertriglyceridemia TG lowering therapy (fibrates or fish-oil) is essential to prevent cardiovascular disease and pancreatitis. Fibrates, however, also increase the risk for cholelithiasis by increasing biliary cholesterol saturation and by reduction of bile acid synthesis. On the other hand fish-oil decreases biliary cholesterol saturation. Fish-oil may increase bile acid synthesis by activation of 7alpha-hydroxylase and may inhibit VLDL production and secretion through activation of nuclear factors and increased apoB degradation. In HTG patients, gallbladder motility improves during bezafibrate as well as during fish-oil therapy. The question remains whether improvement of gallbladder motility and increased lithogenicity of bile by bezafibrate therapy counteract each other or still result in gallstone formation in HTG patients.
The histone H3-lysine-4 methyltransferase mixed-lineage leukemia 3 (MLL3) belongs to a large complex that functions as a coactivator of multiple transcription factors, including the bile acid (BA)-activated nuclear receptor, farnesoid X receptor (FXR), a critical player in BA homeostasis. BA-activated FXR induces hepatic expression of small heterodimer partner (SHP), which in turn suppresses expression of BA synthesis genes, Cyp7a1 and Cyp8b1. Thus, MLL3(Δ/Δ) mice that express a catalytically inactive mutant form of MLL3 display increased BA levels. Recently, we have discovered a distinct regulatory pathway for BA homeostasis, in which p53 independently up-regulates SHP expression in the liver. Here, we show that the MLL3 complex is also essential for p53 transactivation of SHP. Although activated p53 signaling in MLL3(+/+) mice results in decreased BA levels through hepatic up-regulation of SHP, these changes are abolished in MLL3(Δ/Δ) mice. For both HepG2 cells and mouse liver, we also demonstrate that p53 directs the recruitment of different components of the MLL3 complex to the p53-response elements of SHP and that p53-dependent H3-lysine-4-trimethylation of SHP requires MLL3. From these results, we conclude that both FXR- and p53-dependent regulatory pathways for SHP expression in BA homeostasis require the MLL3 complex; thus, the MLL3 complex is likely a master regulator of BA homeostasis. Using a common coregulator complex for multiple transcription factors, which independently control expression of the same gene, might be a prevalent theme in gene regulation and may also play critical roles in assigning a specific biological function to a coregulator complex.
With only 1.3-4.3% in total hepatic CYP content, human CYP2D6 can metabolize more than 160 drugs. It is a highly polymorphic enzyme and subject to marked inhibition by a number of drugs, causing a large interindividual variability in drug clearance and drug response and drug-drug interactions. The expression and activity of CYP2D6 are regulated by a number of physiological, pathological and environmental factors at transcriptional, post-transcriptional, translational and epigenetic levels. DNA hypermethylation and histone modifications can repress the expression of CYP2D6. Hepatocyte nuclear factor-4α binds to a directly repeated element in the promoter of CYP2D6 and thus regulates the expression of CYP2D6. Small heterodimer partner represses hepatocyte nuclear factor-4α-mediated transactivation of CYP2D6. GW4064, a farnesoid X receptor agonist, decreases hepatic CYP2D6 expression and activity while increasing small heterodimer partner expression and its recruitment to the CYP2D6 promoter. The genotypes are key determinants of interindividual variability in CYP2D6 expression and activity. Recent genome-wide association studies have identified a large number of genes that can regulate CYP2D6. Pregnancy induces CYP2D6 via unknown mechanisms. Renal or liver diseases, smoking and alcohol use have minor to moderate effects only on CYP2D6 activity. Unlike CYP1 and 3 and other CYP2 members, CYP2D6 is resistant to typical inducers such as rifampin, phenobarbital and dexamethasone. Post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation of CYP2D6 Ser135 have been observed, but the functional impact is unknown. Further functional and validation studies are needed to clarify the role of nuclear receptors, epigenetic factors and other factors in the regulation of CYP2D6. 
Cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) is a major drug-metabolizing enzyme responsible for eliminating approximately 20% of marketed drugs. Studies have shown that differential transcriptional regulation of CYP2D6 may contribute to large interindividual variability in CYP2D6-mediated drug metabolism. However, the factors governing CYP2D6 transcription are largely unknown. We previously demonstrated small heterodimer partner (SHP) as a novel transcriptional repressor of CYP2D6 expression. SHP is a representative target gene of the farnesoid X receptor (FXR). The objective of this study is to investigate whether an agonist of FXR, 3-(2,6-dichlorophenyl)-4-(3'-carboxy-2-chlorostilben-4-yl)oxymethyl-5-isopropylisoxazole (GW4064), alters CYP2D6 expression and activity. In CYP2D6-humanized transgenic mice, GW4064 decreased hepatic CYP2D6 expression and activity (by 2-fold) while increasing SHP expression (by 2-fold) and SHP recruitment to the CYP2D6 promoter. CYP2D6 repression by GW4064 was abrogated in Shp(-/-);CYP2D6 mice, indicating a critical role of SHP in CYP2D6 regulation by GW4064. Also, GW4064 decreased CYP2D6 expression (by 2-fold) in primary human hepatocytes, suggesting that the results obtained in CYP2D6-humanized transgenic mice can be translated to humans. This proof of concept study provides evidence for CYP2D6 regulation by an inducer of SHP expression, namely, the FXR agonist GW4064. 
Saccharomyces cerevisiae Msl5 orchestrates spliceosome assembly by binding the intron branchpoint sequence 5'-UACUAAC and, with its heterodimer partner protein Mud2, establishing cross intron-bridging interactions with the U1 snRNP at the 5' splice site. Here we define the central Msl5 KH-QUA2 domain as sufficient for branchpoint RNA recognition. The 1.8 Å crystal structure of Msl5-(KH-QUA2) bound to the branchpoint highlights an extensive network of direct and water-mediated protein-RNA and intra-RNA atomic contacts at the interface that illuminate how Msl5 recognizes each nucleobase of the UACUAAC element. The Msl5 structure rationalizes a large body of mutational data and inspires new functional studies herein, which reveal how perturbations of the Msl5·RNA interface impede the splicing of specific yeast pre-mRNAs. We also identify interfacial mutations in Msl5 that bypass the essentiality of Sub2, a DExD-box ATPase implicated in displacing Msl5 from the branchpoint in exchange for the U2 snRNP. These studies establish an atomic resolution framework for understanding splice site selection and early spliceosome dynamics. 
CYP2D6-mediated drug metabolism exhibits large interindividual variability. Although genetic variations in the CYP2D6 gene are well known contributors to the variability, the sources of CYP2D6 variability in individuals of the same genotype remain unexplained. Accumulating data indicate that transcriptional regulation of CYP2D6 may account for part of CYP2D6 variability. Yet, our understanding of factors governing transcriptional regulation of CYP2D6 is limited. Recently, mechanistic studies of increased CYP2D6-mediated drug metabolism in pregnancy revealed two transcription factors, small heterodimer partner (SHP) and Krüppel-like factor 9, as a transcriptional repressor and an activator, respectively, of CYP2D6. Chemicals that increase SHP expression (e.g., retinoids and activators of farnesoid X receptor) were shown to downregulate CYP2D6 expression in the humanized mice as well as in human hepatocytes. This review summarizes the series of studies on the transcriptional regulation of CYP2D6 expression, potentially providing a basis to better understand the large interindividual variability in CYP2D6-mediated drug metabolism.
The mechanism of transformation to intestinal metaplasia in Barrett's oesophagus has not been clarified. We investigated the effects of various bile acids on expression of the caudal related homeobox gene Cdx2 in cultured oesophageal squamous epithelial cells. In addition, morphological and histochemical changes in squamous cells to intestinal epithelial cells were studied in response to bile acid induced expression of Cdx2.
A rat model of Barrett's oesophagus was created by anastomosing the oesophagus and jejunum, and Cdx2 expression was investigated by immunohistochemistry. Also, the response of various bile acids on Cdx2 gene expression was studied in the human colon epithelial cell lines Caco-2 and HT-29, as well as in cultured rat oesophageal squamous epithelial cells using a Cdx2 promoter luciferase assay. In addition, primary cultured oesophageal squamous epithelial cells were transfected with Cdx2 expression vectors and their possible transformation to intestinal-type epithelial cells was investigated.
Oesophagojejunal anastomoses formed intestinal goblet cell metaplasia in rat oesophagus specimens and metaplastic epithelia strongly expressed Cdx2. When the effects of 11 types of bile acids on Cdx2 gene expression were examined, only cholic acid (CA) and dehydrocholic acid dose dependently increased Cdx2 promoter activity and Cdx2 protein production in Caco-2 and HT-29 cells, and cultured rat oesophageal keratinocytes. Results from mutation analysis of Cdx2 promoter suggested that two nuclear factor kappaB (NFkappaB) binding sites were responsible for the bile acid induced activation of the Cdx2 promoter. When bile acids were measured in oesophageal refluxate of rats with experimental Barrett's oesophagus, the concentration of CA was found to be consistent with the experimental dose that augmented Cdx2 expression in vitro. Furthermore, transfection of the Cdx2 expression vector in cultured rat oesophageal keratinocytes induced production of intestinal-type mucin, MUC2, in cells that expressed Cdx2.
We found that CA activates Cdx2 promoter via NFkappaB and stimulates production of Cdx2 protein in oesophageal keratinocytes with production of intestinal-type mucin. This may be one of the mechanisms of metaplasia in Barrett's oesophagus.
Androgens increase muscle mass, decrease fat mass, and reduce high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL), but the relationship between body composition, lipoprotein metabolism, and androgens has not been explained. Here we treated ovariectomized cynomolgus monkeys with 5alpha-dihydrotestosterone (DHT) or vehicle for 14 d and measured lipoprotein and triglycerides. Nuclear magnetic resonance analysis revealed that DHT dose-dependently reduced the cholesterol content of large HDL particles and decreased mean HDL particle size (P &lt; 0.01) and also tended to lower low-density lipoprotein cholesterol without altering other lipoprotein particles. Liver and visceral fat biopsies taken before and after DHT treatment for 1 or 14 d were analyzed by genome-wide microarrays. In liver, DHT did not alter the expression of most genes involved in cholesterol synthesis or uptake but rapidly increased small heterodimer partner (SHP) RNA, along with concomitant repression of CYP7A1, a target of SHP transcriptional repression and the rate-limiting enzyme in bile acid synthesis. DHT regulation of SHP and CYP7A1 also occurs in rats, indicating a conserved mechanism. In adipose tissue, pathway analyses suggested coordinate regulation of adipogenesis, tissue remodeling, and lipid homeostasis. Genes encoding IGF-I and beta-catenin were induced, as were extracellular matrix, cell adhesion, and cytoskeletal components, whereas there was consistent down-regulation of genes involved in triacylglycerol metabolism. Interestingly, cholesterol ester transfer protein RNA was induced rapidly in monkey adipose tissue, whereas its inhibitor apolipoprotein CI was repressed. These data provide insight into the androgenic regulation of lipoprotein homeostasis and suggest that changes in adipose lipoprotein metabolism could contribute to HDL cholesterol reduction.
Variations of the small heterodimer partner (SHP, NR0B2) gene, an atypical nuclear receptor that inhibits transactivation by hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF)-4alpha, are associated with obesity among Japanese. The purpose of the study was to evaluate the prevalence of SHP variants among obese Danish men. Using combined SSCP and heteroduplex analysis, we analyzed the entire coding region of SHP for variants in a cohort of 750 Danish men with early-onset obesity and genotyped a cohort of 795 nonobese control subjects using PCR-RFLP. Functional analyses of the identified coding region variants were performed in both MIN6-m9 and HepG2 cell lines. A total of five novel variants, including three missense variants (c.100C&gt;G [p.R34G], c.278G&gt;A [p.G93D], and c.415C&gt;A [p.P139H]) and two silent variants (c.65C&gt;T [p.Y22Y] and c.339G&gt;A [p.P113P]) were identified. Moreover, the previously reported c.512G&gt;C [p.G171A] polymorphism was identified. The 171A allele was not associated with obesity (p = 0.07). The 34G, 93D, and 139H-alleles were rare variants, which were found only among obese subjects. Among the four coding region variants, the 93D-allele showed a reduced in vitro inhibition of the HNF-4alpha transactivation of the HNF-1alpha promoter expression when expressed in MIN6-m9 and HepG2 cell lines (p&lt;0.01). In contrast to reported findings among obese Japanese, functional variants are rare among Danish men. A functional 93D variant of SHP was identified in 1 out of 750 obese and in none of 795 nonobese control subjects. Further large-scale population studies are necessary to assess the clinical impact of this rare variant on obesity risk among European subjects.
Loss of function mutations in the small heterodimer partner (SHP) gene have been reported to cause obesity and increased birth weight. We examined the relation between genetic variation in SHP and birth weight, adiposity, and insulin levels in three independent populations. The coding regions and 562 bases of the SHP promoter were screened for mutations in 329 subjects with severe early-onset obesity. Two novel missense mutations, R34G and R36C, were identified; these were not found in control subjects and did not cosegregate with obesity in family studies. Two common polymorphisms, G171A and -195CTGAdel, were found in 12 and 16% of subjects, respectively. Within the obese cohort, G171A and -195CTGAdel carriers had higher and lower birth weights, respectively, than wild-type subjects, the rare homozygotes for G171A being particularly large at birth. In a U.K. population-based cohort of 1,079 children, the 171A allele was associated with higher BMI (P &lt; 0.05) and waist circumference (P = 0.001). Children carrying the G171A variant had higher 30-min insulin responses to a glucose load (P = 0.03). In conclusion, although mutations in SHP are not a common cause of severe human obesity, genetic variation in the SHP locus may influence birth weight and have effects on BMI, possibly through effects on insulin secretion.
Expression of hepatic bile salt transporters is partly regulated by bile salts via activation of nuclear farnesoid X-activated receptor (Fxr). We investigated the physiological relevance of this regulation by evaluating transporter expression in mice experiencing different transhepatic bile salt fluxes.
Bile salt flux was manipulated by dietary supplementation with taurocholate (0.5% w/w) or cholestyramine (2% w/w) or by disruption of the cholesterol 7alpha-hydroxylase-gene (Cyp7A(-/-) mice) leading to reduced bile salt pool size. Expression of hepatic transporters was assessed (polymerase chain reaction (PCR), immunoblotting, and immunohistochemistry).
Biliary bile salt secretion was increased (+350%) or decreased (-50%) after taurocholate or cholestyramine feeding, respectively, but plasma bile salt concentrations and hepatic Fxr expression were not affected. The bile salt uptake system Na(+)-taurocholate co-transporting polypeptide (Ntcp) and organic anion transporting polypeptide-1 (Oatp1) were down-regulated by taurocholate and not affected by cholestyramine feeding. Cyp7A(-/-) mice did not show altered Ntcp or Oatp1 expression. Canalicular bile salt export pump (Bsep) was up-regulated by 65% in taurocholate-fed mice, and slightly down-regulated in Cyp7A(-/-) mice.
Large variations in hepatic bile salt flux have minor effects on expression of murine Ntcp and Bsep in vivo, suggesting that these transporters are abundantly expressed and able to accommodate a wide range of 'physiological' bile salt fluxes.
Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-mediated death. Although various therapeutic approaches are used for lung cancer treatment, these mainly target the tumor suppressor p53 transcription factor, which is involved in apoptosis and cell cycle arrest. However, p53-targeted therapies have limited application in lung cancer, since p53 is found to be mutated in more than half of lung cancers. In this study, we propose tumor suppressor FOXA2 as an alternative target protein for therapies against lung cancer and reveal a possible FOXA2-centered transcriptional regulation network by identifying new target genes and binding partners of FOXA2 by using various screening techniques. The genes encoding Glu/Asp-rich carboxy-terminal domain 2 (CITED2), nuclear receptor subfamily 0, group B, member 2 (NR0B2), cell adhesion molecule 1 (CADM1) and BCL2-associated X protein (BAX) were identified as putative target genes of FOXA2. Additionally, the proteins including highly similar to heat shock protein HSP 90-beta (HSP90A), heat shock 70 kDa protein 1A variant (HSPA1A), histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) and HDAC3 were identified as novel interacting partners of FOXA2. Moreover, we showed that FOXA2-dependent promoter activation of BAX and p21 genes is significantly reduced via physical interactions between the identified binding partners and FOXA2. These results provide opportunities to understand the FOXA2-centered transcriptional regulation network and novel therapeutic targets to modulate this network in p53-deficient lung cancer. 
The nuclear receptors are a large family of eukaryotic transcription factors that constitute major pharmacological targets. They exert their combinatorial control through homotypic heterodimerisation. Elucidation of this dimerisation network is vital in order to understand the complex dynamics and potential cross-talk involved.
Phylogeny, protein-protein interactions, protein-DNA interactions and gene expression data have been integrated to provide a comprehensive and up-to-date description of the topology and properties of the nuclear receptor interaction network in humans. We discriminate between DNA-binding and non-DNA-binding dimers, and provide a comprehensive interaction map, that identifies potential cross-talk between the various pathways of nuclear receptors.
We infer that the topology of this network is hub-based, and much more connected than previously thought. The hub-based topology of the network and the wide tissue expression pattern of NRs create a highly competitive environment for the common heterodimerising partners. Furthermore, a significant number of negative feedback loops is present, with the hub protein SHP [NR0B2] playing a major role. We also compare the evolution, topology and properties of the nuclear receptor network with the hub-based dimerisation network of the bHLH transcription factors in order to identify both unique themes and ubiquitous properties in gene regulation. In terms of methodology, we conclude that such a comprehensive picture can only be assembled by semi-automated text-mining, manual curation and integration of data from various sources.
Testosterone production by Leydig cells is a tightly regulated process requiring synchronized expression of several steroidogenic genes by numerous transcription factors. Myocyte enhancer factor 2 (MEF2) are transcription factors recently identified in somatic cells of the male gonad. In other tissues, MEF2 factors are essential regulators of organogenesis and cell differentiation. So far in the testis, MEF2 factors were found to regulate Leydig cell steroidogenesis by controlling Nr4a1 and Star gene expression. To expand our understanding of the role of MEF2 in Leydig cells, we performed microarray analyses of MEF2-depleted MA-10 Leydig cells, and the results were analyzed using Partek and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis software. Several genes were differentially expressed in MEF2-depleted Leydig cells, and 16 were validated by quantitative RT-PCR. A large number of these genes are known to be involved in fertility, gonad morphology, and steroidogenesis. These include Ahr, Bmal1, Cyp1b1, Hsd3b1, Hsd17b7, Map2k1, Nr0b2, Pde8a, Por, Smad4, Star, and Tsc22d3, which were all downregulated in the absence of MEF2. In silico analyses revealed the presence of MEF2-binding sites within the first 2 kb upstream of the transcription start site of the Por, Bmal1, and Nr0b2 promoters, suggesting direct regulation by MEF2. Using transient transfections in MA-10 Leydig cells, small interfering RNA knockdown, and a MEF2-Engrailed dominant negative, we found that MEF2 activates the Por, Bmal1, and Nr0b2 promoters and that this requires an intact MEF2 element. Our results identify novel target genes for MEF2 and define MEF2 as an important regulator of Leydig cell function and male reproduction. 
Therapeutic resistance is a central problem in clinical oncology. We have developed a systematic genome-wide computational methodology to allow prioritization of patients with favorable and poor therapeutic response. Our method, which integrates DNA methylation and mRNA expression data, uncovered a panel of 5 differentially methylated sites, which explain expression changes in their site-harboring genes, and demonstrated their ability to predict primary resistance to androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT) in the TCGA prostate cancer patient cohort (hazard ratio = 4.37). Furthermore, this panel was able to accurately predict response to ADT across independent prostate cancer cohorts and demonstrated that it was not affected by Gleason, age, or therapy subtypes. We propose that this panel could be utilized to prioritize patients who would benefit from ADT and patients at risk of resistance that should be offered an alternative regimen. Such approach holds a long-term objective to build an adaptable accurate platform for precision therapeutics.
Cell cycle quiescence is critical for hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) maintenance. TGF-β signaling in bone marrow niche has been identified in regulating HSC quiescence; however, the intrinsic regulatory mechanisms remain unclear. This study reports that Shp-1 knockout HSCs have attenuated quiescence and impaired long-term self-renewal. SHP-1-activated HSCs are surrounded by megakaryocytes, which regulate HSC quiescence by producing TGF-β1. Mechanistically, SHP-1 interacts with the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibition motif on TGF-β receptor 1 and is critical for TGF-β signaling activation in HSCs. Functionally, Shp-1 knockout HSCs do not respond to TGF-β-enforced HSC quiescence regulation, both in vitro and in vivo. Therefore, we identify TGF-β-SHP-1 as a novel intrinsic regulatory mechanism for HSC quiescence maintenance.
Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a burgeoning health problem worldwide, ranging from nonalcoholic fatty liver (NAFL, steatosis without hepatocellular injury) to the more aggressive nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH, steatosis with ballooning, inflammation, or fibrosis). Although many studies have greatly contributed to the elucidation of NAFLD pathogenesis, the disease progression from NAFL to NASH still remains incompletely understood. Nuclear receptor small heterodimer partner (Nr0b2, SHP) is a transcriptional regulator critical for the regulation of bile acid, glucose, and lipid metabolism. Here, we show that SHP levels are decreased in the livers of patients with NASH and in diet-induced mouse NASH. Exposing primary mouse hepatocytes to palmitic acid (PA) and liposaccharide (LPS) in vitro, we demonstrated that the suppression of Shp expression in hepatocytes is due to c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) activation, which stimulates c-Jun-mediated transcriptional repression of Shp. Interestingly, in vivo induction of hepatocyte-specific SHP in steatotic mouse liver ameliorated NASH progression by attenuating liver inflammation and fibrosis, but not steatosis. Moreover, a key mechanism linking the anti-inflammatory role of hepatocyte-specific SHP expression to inflammation involved SHP-induced suppression of NFκB p65-mediated induction of chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2 (CCL2) which activates macrophage proinflammatory polarization and migration. In summary, our results indicate that a JNK/SHP/NFκB/CCL2 regulatory network controls communications between hepatocytes and macrophages and contributes to the disease progression from NAFL to NASH. Our findings may benefit the development of new management or prevention strategies for NASH.
B cell antigen receptor (BCR) signaling is a tightly regulated process governed by both positive and negative mediators/regulators to ensure appropriate responses to exogenous and autologous antigens. Upon naïve B cell recognition of antigen CD79 [the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM)-containing signaling subunit of the BCR] is phosphorylated and recruits Src and Syk family kinases that then phosphorylate proximal intermediaries linked to downstream activating signaling circuitry. This plasma membrane localized signalosome activates PI3K leading to generation of PIP3 critical for membrane localization and activation of plecktrin homology domain-containing effectors. Conversely, in anergic B cells, chronic antigen stimulation drives biased monophosphorylation of CD79 ITAMs leading to recruitment of Lyn, but not Syk, which docks only to bi-phosphorylated ITAMS. In this context, Lyn appears to function primarily as a driver of inhibitory signaling pathways promoting the inhibition of the PI3K pathway by inositol phosphatases, SHIP-1 and PTEN, which hydrolyze PIP3 to PIP2. Lyn may also exert negative regulation of signaling through recruitment of SHP-1, a tyrosine phosphatase that dephosphorylates activating signaling molecules. Alleles of genes that encode or regulate expression of components of this axis, including SHIP-1, SHP-1, Csk/PTPn22, and Lyn, have been shown to confer risk of autoimmunity. This review will discuss functional interplay of components of this pathway and the impact of risk alleles on its function.
The aims of this study were to better characterize the adrenal response to i.v. adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) in horses with and without gastric disease and to validate and simplify the ACTH stimulation test by determining the diagnostic accuracy of six consecutive sampling time points after ACTH administration for equine glandular gastric disease (EGGD) and equine squamous gastric disease (ESGD). Twenty-six endurance and eventing horses without clinical disease [Sport Horse Population (SHP)] and an independent population of 62 horses [General Population (GP)] were grouped by gastroscopic findings (no/mild vs. moderate/severe EGGD, grade 0-1 vs. 2-4 ESGD, respectively) and underwent an ACTH stimulation test. Salivary cortisol (ng/mL) was analyzed before and 30, 60, 90, 120, and 150 min after i.v. injection of 1 µg/kg BW synthetic ACTH1-24. The association between having moderate or severe EGGD or ESGD and the amount of salivary cortisol was analyzed by means of receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. The following explanatory variables were considered: cortisol values for every time point, the area under the curve (AUC)-including all time points and corrected for the baseline-and the partial areas under the curve AUC0-90 and AUC90-150. Sampling after 60 min had highest association with moderate/severe EGGD. The diagnostic potential of the ACTH test was higher for the SHP [sensitivity 100% (95% CI 54% to 100%), specificity 75% (95% CI 51% to 91%), ROC-AUC 91% (95% CI 69% to 98%), 1-sided P-value &lt; 0.001] than for the GP [sensitivity 75% (95% CI 48% to 93%), specificity 52% (95% CI 37% to 67%), ROC-AUC 68% (95% CI 51% to 79%), 1-sided P-value = 0.0064]. There were, however, no significant associations with ESGD. The superiority of sampling after 60 min suggests that the initial release of cortisol rather than its peak or the AUC are relevant regarding EGGD. Even though the wide confidence intervals and thus the lack of diagnostic accuracy do not presently support clinical use, characterization of the adrenal response to an ACTH stimulus improves the understanding of EGGD pathophysiology and its relation to stress.
Autoimmune blistering diseases (AIBD) is known to negatively impact upon quality of life (QoL), however there is a paucity of research on the effect of AIBD on work productivity. AIBD can be quite disfiguring in terms of a patient's appearance due to its blistering nature.
To determine the impact of AIBD on work productivity and to determine whether patients are stigmatized at work due to their appearance.
Sixty one patients with AIBD completed the Work Productivity and Activity Impairment Questionnaire-Specific Health Problem (WPAIQ-SHP), the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI), the Autoimmune Bullous Disease Quality of Life (ABQOL), and the Treatment of Autoimmune Bullous Disease Quality of Life questionnaires (TABQOL).
Nonresponders to treatment had more work and activity impairment compared to responders. Worse WPAIQ-SHP scores were correlated with higher ABQOL, TABQOL and DLQI scores. Approximately 14.8% of subjects experienced stigmatization at work due to their appearance. The most common body areas stigmatized were easily visible sites, particularly the hands, arms and feet, with the majority of occurrences related to co-workers; for some patients, this stigmatization occurred on a daily basis. Loss of productivity at work was statistically much higher in those with higher disease severity, ABQOL &amp; TABQOL scores and in nonresponders to treatment.
AIBD negatively impacts upon work productivity and activity. Stigmatization was common in the workplace which leads to increased stress, itself a stimulator of pemphigus. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
The change-point detection has been carried out in terms of the Euclidean minimum spanning tree (MST) and shortest Hamiltonian path (SHP), with successful applications in the determination of authorship of a classic novel, the detection of change in a network over time, the detection of cell divisions, etc. However, these Euclidean graph-based tests may fail if a dataset contains random interferences. To solve this problem, we present a powerful non-Euclidean SHP-based test, which is consistent and distribution-free. The simulation shows that the test is more powerful than both Euclidean MST- and SHP-based tests and the non-Euclidean MST-based test. Its applicability in detecting both landing and departure times in video data of bees' flower visits is illustrated.
Src homology region 2 (SH2) domain-containing phosphatase 1 (SHP-1, also known as PTPN6), is a nonreceptor protein tyrosine phosphatase that acts as a negative regulator of inflammation. Emerging evidence indicates that SHP-1 plays a role in inhibiting the progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the role of SHP-1 in hepatocarcinogenesis remains unknown. Here we find that levels of SHP-1 are significantly downregulated in human HCC tissues compared with those in noncancerous tissues (P &amp;lt; 0.001) and inversely correlate with tumor diameters (r = -0.4130, P = 0.0002) and serum alpha-fetoprotein(AFP) levels (P = 0.047). Reduced SHP-1 expression was associated with shorter overall survival of HCC patients with HBV infection. Overexpression of SHP-1 suppressed proliferation, migration, invasion and tumorigenicity of HCC cells, whereas knockdown of SHP-1 enhanced the malignant phenotype. Moreover, knockout of Ptpn6 in hepatocytes (Ptpn6HKO) enhanced hepatocarcinogenesis induced by diethylnitrosamine (DEN) as well as metastasis of primary liver cancer in mice. Furthermore, systemic delivery of SHP-1 by an adenovirus expression vector exerted a therapeutic effect in an orthotopic model of HCC in NOD/SCID mice and DEN-induced primary liver cancers in Ptpn6HKO mice. In addition, SHP-1 inhibited the activation of JAK/STAT, NF-κB, and AKT signaling pathways, but not the MAPK pathway in primary hepatocytes from DEN-treated mice and human HCC cells. Together, our data implicate SHP-1 as a tumor suppressor of hepatocarcinogenesis and HCC progression and propose it as a novel prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target of HCC.
Small heterodimer partner (SHP) is a transcriptional corepressor regulating diverse metabolic processes. Here, we show that SHP acts as an intrinsic negative regulator of iron homeostasis. SHP-deficient mice maintained on a high-iron diet showed increased serum hepcidin levels, decreased expression of the iron exporter ferroportin as well as iron accumulation compared to WT mice. Conversely, overexpression of either SHP or AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a metabolic sensor inducing SHP expression, suppressed BMP6-induced hepcidin expression. In addition, an inhibitory effect of AMPK activators metformin and AICAR on BMP6-mediated hepcidin gene expression was significantly attenuated by ablation of SHP expression. Interestingly, SHP physically interacted with SMAD1 and suppressed BMP6-mediated recruitment of the SMAD complex to the hepcidin gene promoter by inhibiting the formation of SMAD1 and SMAD4 complex. Finally, overexpression of SHP and metformin treatment of BMP6 stimulated mice substantially restored hepcidin expression and serum iron to baseline levels. These results reveal a previously unrecognized role for SHP in the transcriptional control of iron homeostasis.
Small heterodimer partner (SHP, NR0B2) is a nuclear orphan receptor without endogenous ligands. Due to its crucial inhibitory role in liver cancer, it is of importance to identify small molecule agonists of SHP. As such, we initiated a probe discovery effort to identify compounds capable of modulating SHP function. First, we performed binding assays using small molecule microarrays (SMM) and discovered 5-(diethylsulfamoyl)-3-hydroxynaphthalene-2-carboxylic acid (DSHN) as a novel activator of SHP. DSHN transcriptionally activated Shp mRNA, but also stabilized the SHP protein by preventing its ubiquitination and degradation. Second, we identified Ccl2 as a new SHP target gene by RNA-seq. We showed that activation of SHP by DSHN repressed Ccl2 expression and secretion by inhibiting p65 activation of CCL2 promoter activity, as demonstrated in vivo in Shp-/- mice and in vitro in HCC cells with SHP overexpression and knockdown. Third, we elucidated a strong inhibitory effect of SHP and DSHN on HCC cell migration and invasion by antagonizing the effect of CCL2. Lastly, by interrogating a publicly available database to retrieve SHP expression profiles from multiple types of human cancers, we established a negative association of SHP expression with human cancer metastasis and patient survival. In summary, the discovery of a novel small molecule activator of SHP provides a therapeutic perspective for future translational and preclinical studies to inhibit HCC metastasis by blocking Ccl2 signaling.

Orphan nuclear receptors are members of the nuclear receptor (NR) superfamily and are so named because their endogenous physiological ligands are either unknown or may not exist. Because of their important regulatory roles in many key physiological processes, dysregulation of signalings controlled by these receptors is associated with many diseases including cancer. Over years, studies of orphan NRs have become an area of great interest because their specific physiological and pathological roles have not been well-defined, and some of them are promising drug targets for diseases. The recently identified synthetic small molecule ligands, acting as agonists or antagonists, to these orphan NRs not only help to understand better their functional roles but also highlight that the signalings mediated by these ligand-independent NRs in diseases could be therapeutically intervened. This review is a summary of the recent advances in elucidating the emerging functional roles of orphan NRs in cancers, especially prostate cancer. In particular, some orphan NRs, RORγ, TR2, TR4, COUP-IFII, ERRα, DAX1 and SHP, exhibit crosstalk or interference with androgen receptor (AR) signaling in either normal or malignant prostatic cells, highlighting their involvement in prostate cancer progression as androgen and AR signaling pathway play critical roles in this process. We also propose that a better understanding of the mechanism of actions of these orphan NRs in prostate gland or prostate cancer could help to evaluate their potential value as therapeutic targets for prostate cancer.
Deficiency of the orphan nuclear hormone receptor small heterodimer partner (SHP, NR0B2) protects mice from diet-induced hepatic steatosis, in part, via repression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-γ2 (Pparg2) gene expression. Alcoholic fatty liver diseases (AFLD) share many common pathophysiological features with non-AFLD. To study the role of SHP and PPARγ2 in AFLD, we used a strategy of chronic ethanol feeding plus a single binge ethanol feeding to challenge wild-type (WT) and SHP-null (SHP(-/-)) mice with ethanol. The ethanol feeding induced liver fat accumulation and mRNA expression of hepatic Pparg2 in WT mice, which suggests that a high level of PPARγ2 is a common driving force for fat accumulation induced by ethanol or a high-fat diet. Interestingly, ethanol-fed SHP(-/-) mice displayed hepatic fat accumulation similar to that of ethanol-fed WT mice, even though their Pparg2 expression level remained lower. Mortality of SHP(-/-) mice after ethanol binge feeding was significantly reduced and their acetaldehyde dehydrogenase (Aldh2) mRNA level was higher than that of their WT counterparts. After an intoxicating dose of ethanol, SHP(-/-) mice exhibited faster blood ethanol clearance and earlier wake-up time than WT mice. Higher blood acetate, the end product of ethanol metabolism, and lower acetaldehyde levels were evident in the ethanol-challenged SHP(-/-) than WT mice. Ethanol-induced inflammatory responses and lipid peroxidation were also lower in SHP(-/-) mice. The current data show faster ethanol catabolism and extra fat storage through conversion of acetate to acetyl-CoA before its release into the circulation in this ethanol-feeding model in SHP(-/-) mice. 
Bile acids (BAs) are recently recognized signalling molecules that profoundly affect metabolism. Because of detergent-like toxicity, BA levels must be tightly regulated. An orphan nuclear receptor, Small Heterodimer Partner (SHP), plays a key role in this regulation, but how SHP senses the BA signal for feedback transcriptional responses is not clearly understood. We show an unexpected function of a nucleoporin, RanBP2, in maintaining BA homoeostasis through SUMOylation of SHP. Upon BA signalling, RanBP2 co-localizes with SHP at the nuclear envelope region and mediates SUMO2 modification at K68, which facilitates nuclear transport of SHP and its interaction with repressive histone modifiers to inhibit BA synthetic genes. Mice expressing a SUMO-defective K68R SHP mutant have increased liver BA levels, and upon BA- or drug-induced biliary insults, these mice exhibit exacerbated cholestatic pathologies. These results demonstrate a function of RanBP2-mediated SUMOylation of SHP in maintaining BA homoeostasis and protecting from the BA hepatotoxicity. 
The glucocorticoid receptor (GR) is a transcription factor of which the underlying gene regulatory mechanisms are complex and incompletely understood. The non-steroidal anti-inflammatory Compound A (CpdA), a selective GR modulating compound in various cell models, has been shown to favour GR-mediated gene repression but not GR-mediated gene activation. Shifting balances towards only a particular subset of GR gene regulatory events may be of benefit in the treatment of inflammatory diseases. We present evidence to support that the combination of CpdA with Dexamethasone (DEX), a classic steroidal GR ligand, can shape GR function towards a unique gene regulatory profile in a cell type-dependent manner. The molecular basis hereof is a changed GR phosphorylation status concomitant with a change in the GR cofactor recruitment profile. We subsequently identified and confirmed the orphan nuclear receptor SHP as a coregulator that is specifically enriched at GR when CpdA and DEX are combined. Combining CpdA with DEX not only leads to stronger suppression of pro-inflammatory gene expression, but also enhanced anti-inflammatory GR target gene expression in epithelial cells, making ligand combination strategies in future a potentially attractive alternative manner of skewing and fine-tuning GR effects towards an improved therapeutic benefit.
The orphan nuclear receptor, small heterodimer partner (SHP), plays a negative regulatory role in innate immune responses and is involved in various inflammatory signaling pathways. In the present study, we aimed to ascertain whether SHP is effective in preventing hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)-induced kidney tubular inflammation and explored the molecular mechanisms underlying the protective effects of SHP. Renal ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury was induced in mice by clamping both renal pedicles for 30 min. The effects of H2O2 on cell viability in human renal proximal tubule (HK-2) cells were determined using MTT assays. 2',7'-DCF-DA was used to determine intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS). SHP, cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) levels, and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) expression levels were determined by semi-quantitative immunoblotting and real-time polymerase chain reaction. In addition, SHP, nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), and activator protein-1 (AP-1) promoter activities were determined by luciferase assays. SHP mRNA and protein expression levels were reduced, whereas COX-2 and iNOS levels were increased in mice subjected to renal I/R. H2O2 treatment in HK-2 cells decreased cell viability, increased ROS production, and induced COX-2 and iNOS expression. These changes were counteracted by transient transfection with SHP. H2O2 treatment decreased SHP luciferase activity, which was recovered by treatment with the NF-κB inhibitor Bay11-7082, transfection with dominant-negative c-Jun or treatment with N-acetyl cysteine (NAC). AP-1 and NF-κB promoter activities were increased by H2O2 and this increase was blocked by SHP transfection. To conclude, SHP protected HK-2 cells from H2O2-induced tubular injury by inhibition of COX-2 and iNOS through suppression of AP-1 and NF-κB promoter activities.
The small heterodimer partner (SHP) is an orphan nuclear receptor that lacks the DNA binding domain while conserves a putative ligand-binding site, thought that endogenous ligands for this receptor are unknown. Previous studies have determined that SHP activation protects against development of liver fibrosis a process driven by trans-differentiation and activation of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), a miofibroblast like cell type, involved in extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition. To dissect signals involved in this activity we generated SHP-overexpressing human and rat HSCs. Forced expression of SHP in HSC-T6 altered the expression of 574 genes. By pathway and functional enrichment analyses we detected a cluster of 46 differentially expressed genes involved in HSCs trans-differentiation. Using a isoxazole scaffold we designed and synthesized a series of SHP agonists. The most potent member of this group, ISO-COOH (EC50: 9 μM), attenuated HSCs trans-differentiation and ECM deposition in vitro, while in mice rendered cirrhotic by carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) or α-naphthyl-isothiocyanate (ANIT), protected against development of liver fibrosis as measured by morphometric analysis and expression of α-SMA and α1-collagen mRNAs. In aggregate, present results identify SHP as a counter-regulatory signal for HSCs transactivation and describe a novel class of SHP agonists endowed with anti-fibrotic activity.
Although detailed pathophysiological mechanisms of fulminant hepatitis remain elusive, immune cell recruitment with excessive cytokine production is a well-recognized hallmark of the disease. We determined the function of orphan nuclear receptor small heterodimer partner (SHP) in concanavalin A (ConA)-induced hepatitis model. Male C57BL/6 J mice were injected intravenously with either a lethal dose (25 mg/kg) or a sub-lethal dose (15 mg/kg) of ConA. For the C-X-C motif chemokine ligand (CXCL) 2 neutralization study, mice were intravenously administered anti-mouse CXCL2 antibody (100 μg/mouse). Thirty-six hours following lethal dose of ConA administration, 47% wild type (WT) mice were alive, whereas &gt;85% of Shp knockout (KO) were dead. Shp KO mice were highly susceptible to ConA-induced liver injury and exhibited increased liver necrosis upon sub-lethal dose of ConA administration. FACS analysis and immunohistochemical staining showed significantly higher neutrophil infiltration in Shp KO mice, as compared with WT mice. We found that also in the WT situation, Shp expression gradually decreased, while Cxcl2 expression increased until 6 h, and vice versa at 24 h upon ConA-treatment, indicating an inverse correlation between Shp and Cxcl2 expression during ConA-induced hepatitis. Furthermore, in vivo neutralization of CXCL2 with neutralizing antibody reduces ConA-induced plasma ALT and AST levels, hepatocyte death and neutrophil infiltration in Shp KO mice. Collectively, these results confirm that lacking of SHP results in CXCL2-dependent neutrophil infiltration in ConA-induced liver damage. SHP plays a protective, anti-inflammatory role in liver during acute liver inflammation.
Binge drinking among alcohol consumers is a common occurrence, and may result in the development of numerous diseases, including liver disorders. It has previously been reported that natural killer T (NKT) cells induce alcohol‑associated liver injury by promoting neutrophil infiltration. In the present study, the role of the orphan nuclear receptor small heterodimer partner (SHP), which is encoded by the NR0B2 gene, in acute binge drinking‑induced liver injury was investigated. SHP‑knockout (KO) and wild‑type (WT) control mice were intragastrically administered single doses of alcohol. The plasma concentrations of alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase in SHP‑KO mice following alcohol treatment were significantly increased compared with WT mice. However, results of oil red O staining and 2',7'‑dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate staining indicated that levels of acute binge drinking‑associated hepatic lipid accumulation and oxidative stress were not significantly different between WT and SHP‑KO alcohol‑treated mice. Notably, tumor necrosis factor‑α mRNA expression in the liver of SHP‑KO mice was significantly increased following alcohol administration, compared with WT mice. Furthermore, the mRNA expression levels of C‑C motif chemokine ligand 2, C‑X‑C motif chemokine ligand 2 and interleukin‑4, which are all potent chemoattractants of NKT cells, as well as neutrophil expression levels, were significantly increased in the livers of SHP‑KO mice compared with WT mice following alcohol administration, as determined by reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction and flow cytometry. Enhanced infiltration of NKT cells, determined by flow cytometry, was also demonstrated in the livers of SHP‑KO mice following alcohol administration, compared with WT mice. The results of the present study indicate that SHP may be involved in liver‑associated protective mechanisms, with regards to the attenuation of damage caused by acute binge drinking, via regulation of NKT cell and neutrophil migration to the liver. The modulation of SHP may be a novel therapeutic strategy for the treatment of acute binge drinking‑induced liver injury.
Arthroplasty has been widely performed worldwide. However, peri-prosthetic osteolysis and aseptic loosening induced by macrophages activated by wear particles still remain a predominant cause of long term prosthetic failure. Our study aimed to identify the role of small heterodimer partner (SHP) in secretion of proinflammatory cytokines by macrophages through Toll-like Recepters (TLR)s signaling pathway activated by wear particles both in vivo and in vitro. The effect of SHP on activation of TLR4 pathway and secretion of cytokines was observed in RAW264.7 cells and SHP gene over-expressed mice. Expression of TLR4, TRAF6, NEMO complex and proinflammatory cytokine TNF-α in macrophages stimulated by wear particles was up-regulated, while SHP was down-regulated. On the other hand, inhibition of SHP up-regulated the expression of NEMO complex and proinflammatory cytokine TNF-α in RAW264.7 stimulated by wear particles, while over-expression of SHP gene showed an opposite result. Over-expression of SHP gene could inhibit cranial osteolysis induced by wear particles in mice model. In conclusion, SHP down-regulates TLR4 signaling pathway to reduce osteolysis induced by titanium particles via in vitro and in vivo experimental models.
Prostate cancer (PCa) is the second most common cancer in men worldwide. Currently, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test and digital rectal exam are the main screening tests used for PCa diagnosis. However, due to the low specificity of these tests, new alternative biomarkers such as deregulated RNAs and microRNAs have been implemented.
Aberrant expressions of small heterodimer partner gene (SHP, NR0B2) and mir-141 are reported in various cancers. The aim of this study was to investigate the SHP and miR-141 expression level in tissue samples of prostate cancer.
The expression level of SHP gene and miR-141 was assessed by real time PCR and their relative amounts were calculated by the Δ⁢ΔCT method. Also, IHC technique was used to determine the expression level of SHP protein.
The miR-141 was significantly up-regulated in the samples of metastatic tumors compared to localized tumor samples (P&lt; 0.001, 31.17-fold change). Tumor samples showed lower SHP mRNA expression levels than BPH samples (p= 0.014, 4.7-fold change). The results of paired t-test analysis showed there was no significant difference between the SHP gene expression in PCa samples and their matched tumor-adjacent normal tissue (p= 0.5).
The data obtained in our study confirm the involvement of miR-141 in PCa progression and metastasis. These effects could be mediated by AR via down-regulation of its co-repressor protein, i.e., SHP.
The regulation of hepatic very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) secretion plays an important role in the pathogenesis of dyslipidemia and fatty liver diseases. VLDL is controlled by hepatic microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTTP). Mttp is regulated by carbohydrate response element binding protein (ChREBP) and small heterodimer partner (SHP). However, it is unclear whether both coordinately regulate Mttp expression and VLDL secretion. Here, adenoviral overexpression of ChREBP and SHP in rat primary hepatocytes induced and suppressed Mttp mRNA, respectively. However, Mttp induction by ChREBP was much more potent than suppression by SHP. Promoter assays of Mttp and the liver type pyruvate kinase gene revealed that SHP and ChREBP did not affect the transcriptional activity of each other. Mttp mRNA and protein levels of Shp-/- mice were similar to those of wild-types; however, those of Chrebp-/-Shp-/- and Chrebp-/- mice were significantly much lower. Consistent with this, the VLDL particle number and VLDL secretion rates in Shp-/- mice were similar to wild-types but were much lower in Chrebp-/- and Chrebp-/-Shp-/- mice. These findings suggest that ChREBP, rather than SHP, regulates VLDL secretion under normal conditions and that ChREBP and SHP do not affect the transcriptional activities of each other.
This article is a report on a symposium entitled "Physiological Regulation of Drug Metabolism and Transport" sponsored by the American Society for Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics and held at the Experimental Biology 2017 meeting in Chicago, IL. The contributions of physiologic and pathophysiological regulation of drug-metabolizing enzymes and transporters to interindividual variability in drug metabolism are increasingly recognized but in many cases are not well understood. The presentations herein discuss the phenomenology, consequences, and mechanism of such regulation. CYP2D6 transgenic mice were used to provide insights into the mechanism of regulation of this enzyme in pregnancy, via hepatocyte nuclear factor 4α, small heterodimer partner, and retinoids. Regulation of intestinal and hepatic drug-processing enzymes by the intestinal microbiota via tryptophan and its metabolites was investigated. The potential impact of parasitic infections on human drug metabolism and clearance was assessed in mice infected with Schistosoma mansoni or Plasmodium chabaudi chabaudi AS, both of which produced widespread and profound effects on murine hepatic drug-metabolizing enzymes. Finally, the induction of Abcc drug efflux transporters by fasting was investigated. This was demonstrated to occur via a cAMP, protein kinase A/nuclear factor-E2-related factor 2/Sirtuin 1 pathway via antioxidant response elements on the Abcc genes.
The bile acid activated transcription factor farnesoid X receptor (FXR) regulates numerous metabolic processes and is a rising target for the treatment of hepatic and metabolic disorders. FXR agonists have revealed efficacy in treating non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), diabetes and dyslipidemia. Here we characterize imatinib as first-in-class allosteric FXR modulator and report the development of an optimized descendant that markedly promotes agonist induced FXR activation in a reporter gene assay and FXR target gene expression in HepG2 cells. Differential effects of imatinib on agonist-induced bile salt export protein and small heterodimer partner expression suggest that allosteric FXR modulation could open a new avenue to gene-selective FXR modulators.
Fructose malabsorption is a common digestive disorder in which absorption of fructose in the small intestine is impaired. An abnormality of the main intestinal fructose transporter proteins has been proposed as a cause for fructose malabsorption. However the underlying molecular mechanism for this remains unclear. In this study, we investigated whether carbohydrate response element-binding protein (ChREBP) plays a role in intestinal fructose absorption through the regulation of genes involved in fructose transport and metabolism and ion transport.
Wild type (WT) and Chrebp knockout (KO) mice (6 or 8 weeks old) were fed a control diet (55% starch, 15% maltodextrin 10) or high-fructose diet (HFrD, 60% fructose, 10% starch) for 3-12 days. Body weight and food intake were measured, signs of fructose malabsorption were monitored, and the expression of genes involved in fructose transport/metabolism and ion transport was evaluated. Furthermore, transient transfection and chromatin immunoprecipitation were performed to show the direct interaction between ChREBP and carbohydrate response elements in the promoter of Slc2A5, which encodes the fructose transporter GLUT5.
Chrebp KO mice fed the control diet maintained a constant body weight, whereas those fed a HFrD showed significant weight loss within 3-5 days. In addition, Chrebp KO mice fed the HFrD exhibited a markedly distended cecum and proximal colon containing both fluid and gas, suggesting incomplete fructose absorption. Fructose-induced increases of genes involved in fructose transport (GLUT5), fructose metabolism (fructokinase, aldolase B, triokinase, and lactate dehydrogenase), and gluconeogenesis (glucose-6-phosphatase and fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase) were observed in the intestine of WT but not of Chrebp KO mice. Moreover the Na+/H+ exchanger NHE3, which is involved in Na+ and water absorption in the intestine, was significantly decreased in HFrD-fed Chrebp KO mice. Consistent with this finding, the high-fructose diet-fed Chrebp KO mice developed severe diarrhea. Results of chromatin immunoprecipitation assays showed a direct interaction of ChREBP with the Glut5 promoter, but not the Nhe3 promoter, in the small intestine. Ectopic co-expression of ChREBP and its heterodimer partner Max-like protein X activated the Glut5 promoter in Caco-2BBE cells.
ChREBP plays a key role in the dietary fructose transport as well as conversion into lactate and glucose through direct transcriptional control of genes involved in fructose transport, fructolysis, and gluconeogenesis. Moreover, ablation of Chrebp results in a severe diarrhea in mice fed a high-fructose diet, which is associated with the insufficient induction of GLUT5 in the intestine.
