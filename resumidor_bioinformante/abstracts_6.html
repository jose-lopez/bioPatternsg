To describe the English language required to deal with the daily demands of nursing in the UK. To compare these abilities with the stipulated levels on the language test.
A tracking study was conducted with 4 nurses, and focus groups with 11 further nurses. The transcripts of the interviews and focus groups were analysed thematically for recurrent themes. These findings were then compared with the requirements of the IELTS spoken test.
The study was conducted outside the participants' working shifts in busy London hospitals.
The participants in the tracking study were selected opportunistically;all were trained in non-English speaking countries. Snowball sampling was used for the focus groups, of whom 4 were non-native and 7 native speakers of English.
In the tracking study, each of the 4 nurses was interviewed on four occasions, outside the workplace, and as close to the end of a shift as possible. They were asked to recount their spoken interactions during the course of their shift. The participants in the focus groups were asked to describe their typical interactions with patients, family members, doctors, and nursing colleagues. They were prompted to recall specific instances of frequently-occurring communication problems. All interactions were audio-recorded, with the participants' permission,and transcribed.
Nurses are at the centre of communication for patient care. They have to use appropriate registers to communicate with a range of health professionals, patients and their families. They must elicit information, calm and reassure, instruct, check procedures, ask for and give opinions,agree and disagree. Politeness strategies are needed to avoid threats to face. They participate in medical team discussions, and provide information. They have to be able to translate between everyday and medical registers. This requires socio-pragmatic competence, much of which is not tested by IELTS.
In addition to linguistic knowledge and fluency, nursing requires considerable cultural and pragmatic knowledge and competence. Our findings support arguments for including socio-pragmatic competence in language tests specifically designed for nurses. They also indicate a need for further research to find or design more appropriate assessment, and greater awareness amongst policy makers of the principles of language test design and use.
Executive function (EF) deficits in patients with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are ubiquitous and understudied. Further, there are no effective, neuroscience-based treatments to address this impairing feature of ASD. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) has demonstrated promise in addressing EF deficits in adult neuropsychiatric disorders. This article will outline the design of a novel randomized-controlled trial of bilateral, 20 Hz, rTMS applied to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) for treatment of EF deficits in ASD that is currently ongoing. We describe prior therapeutic rTMS research for ASD and prior rTMS trials targeting EFs in adult neuropsychiatric disorders. A neurophysiological rationale for rTMS treatment of EF deficits in ASD is presented.
An ongoing protocol will enroll participants aged 16-35 with ASD and no intellectual disability. Psychotropic medications will be continued during the 4-week trial of active 20 Hz versus sham rTMS applied to the DLPFC. Twenty, active treatment sessions consisting of 25 stimulation trains at a 90% motor threshold will be administered. The primary outcome measure is the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB) spatial working memory task. At present, recruitment, enrollment, and treatment within the described clinical trial are ongoing.
EF deficits are common and impairing symptoms of ASD. There are no evidence-based treatments for EF deficits in ASD. The protocol described here will provide important preliminary data on the feasibility and efficacy of 20 Hz rTMS to DLPFC for EF deficits in ASD.
Morbid obesity is related to chronic inflammation and many metabolic complications. Interleukin (IL)-6 plays a pivotal pathophysiological role in obesity, and IL-6 trans-signaling through the soluble IL-6 receptor (sIL-6R) has a major proinflammatory effect. The aim of this study was to investigate the association between sIL-6R, adipocyte size, and insulin resistance in morbidly obese individuals.
We measured concentrations of sIL-6R, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, and lipid parameters and estimated homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) before the patients underwent bariatric surgery. Mesenteric adipose tissue was collected during surgery, and adipocyte size and concentrations of membrane-bound IL-6 receptor (mIL-6R) were evaluated. In total, 35 adults (20 men and 15 women) were recruited.
The subjects with high HOMA-IR (≥2.4) had higher fasting glucose/insulin, triglycerides, sIL-6R, and adipocyte size and lower high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and mIL-6R than those with low HOMA-IR (&lt;2.4). Adipocyte size positively correlated with sIL-6R (r = 0.559, P = 0.001) and HOMA-IR (r = 0.773, P ≤ 0.001) independent of age, gender, body mass index (BMI), waist, and use of diabetic drugs. In addition, every 1 ng/mL increase in sIL-6R concentration corresponded to a 10.2% decrease in the likelihood of maintaining lower insulin resistance. Furthermore, an sIL-6R level of 77.45 ng/mL was a reasonable cutoff level to propose lower insulin resistance in morbidly obese subjects.
Circulating sIL-6R is more closely associated with insulin resistance status than waist-to-hip ratio or BMI in morbidly obese Taiwanese adults. sIL-6R may be a useful biomarker to assess insulin resistance among morbidly obese subjects.
TCF21 knockout mice display cardiac defects, including ventricular septal defects (VSDs). Functional rs12190287 polymorphisms located within the 3' untranslated region (3'-UTR) of TCF21 were associated with a risk of coronary heart disease in the European and Eastern populations. However, whether rs12190287 polymorphisms in the TCF21-3'UTR confer predisposition to congenital heart disease (CHD) is unclear.
A case-control study was designed consisting of 781 nonsyndromic VSD patients and 867 non-CHD control subjects. The genotype frequency of rs12190287 polymorphisms was determined by real-time polymerase chain reaction.
There were significant differences in the genotype and allele frequencies of rs12190287 between the cases and controls in a Chinese population. Allele G of rs12190287 was significantly associated with an increased risk of VSD in a Chinese population.
Our results demonstrate that rs12190287 polymorphisms confer predisposition to VSDs in the Chinese population studied here.
Blastomycosis elicits a pyogranulomatous inflammatory response, which involves a prominent recruitment of neutrophils to the site of infection. While neutrophils are efficiently recruited to the site of infection, this event is paradoxically coupled with the host's inability to control infection by Blastomyces dermatitidis, the causative agent. The mechanisms underlying this characteristic pyogranulomatous response and inability of neutrophils to kill the yeast are poorly understood. We recently reported that the fungal protease DppIVA promotes B. dermatitidis virulence by cleaving a dipeptide from the N-terminus of C-C chemokines and GM-CSF, thereby inactivating them. Herein, we present evidence that DppIVA can also truncate the N-terminus of members of the ELR(+) CXC chemokine family, which are known to modulate neutrophil function. We show that the DppIVA cleaved form of human (h) CXCL-2, e.g. hCXCL-2 (3-73), is a more potent neutrophil chemoattractant than its intact counterpart, but hCXCL-2 (3-73) is conversely impaired in its ability to prime the reactive oxygen species (ROS) response of neutrophils. Thus, DppIVA action on ELR(+) CXC chemokines may promote the pyogranulomatous response that is typical of blastomycosis, while also explaining the inability of neutrophils to control infection.
The Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) serine protease Hip1 (Hydrolase important for pathogenesis; Rv2224c) promotes tuberculosis (TB) pathogenesis by impairing host immune responses through proteolysis of a protein substrate, Mtb GroEL2. The cell surface localization of Hip1 and its immunomodulatory functions make Hip1 a good drug target for new adjunctive immune therapies for TB. Here we report the crystal structure of Hip1 to a resolution of 2.6 Å and the kinetic studies of the enzyme against model substrates and the protein GroEL2. The structure shows a two-domain protein, one of which contains the catalytic residues that are the signature of a serine protease. Surprisingly, a threonine is located within the active site close enough to hydrogen bond with the catalytic residues Asp463 and His490. Mutation of this residue, Thr466, to alanine established its importance for function. Our studies provide insights into the structure of a member of a novel family of proteases. Knowledge of the Hip1 structure will aid in designing inhibitors that could block Hip1 activity.
Since medieval times, an association between religiosity and anorexia nervosa has been suggested, but few systematic studies exist. This study examines in a nationwide setting whether personal or family religiosity is associated with lifetime anorexia nervosa among women in adolescence and early adulthood. Women (N = 2,825) from the 1975 to 1979 birth cohorts of Finnish twins were screened for lifetime DSM-5 anorexia nervosa (N = 92). Parental religiosity was assessed by self-report when the women were aged 16 years. The women self-reported their religiosity at ages 16 and 22 to 27 years. Parental religiosity did not increase the risk of lifetime anorexia nervosa, and neither did religiosity of the women themselves in adolescence. In early adulthood, a J-shaped curve was compatible with the data, indicating increased risk both at low and high levels of religiosity, but this result was statistically non-significant. Religiosity was weakly negatively correlated with body dissatisfaction. There was some suggestive evidence for socioregional variation in the association of religiosity with lifetime anorexia nervosa. In this first population study to directly address religiosity and anorexia nervosa, no evidence was found for a significant association of religiosity with anorexia nervosa either at the personal or family level. Some regional differences are possible. A modest protective association of religiosity with body dissatisfaction is also possible. Despite compelling case descriptions of "holy anorexia," religiosity does not appear to be a central factor in the development of anorexia nervosa in Finland, a highly secularized Christian country.
Primates represent one of the most species rich, wide ranging and ecologically diverse clades of mammals. What major macroevolutionary factors have driven their diversification and contributed to the modern distribution of primate species remains widely debated. We employed phylogenetic comparative methods to examine the role of clade age and evolutionary rate heterogeneity in the modern distribution of species diversity of Primates. Primate diversification has accelerated since its origin, with decreased extinction leading to a shift to even higher evolutionary rates in the most species rich family (Cercopithecidae). Older primate clades tended to be more diverse, however a shift in evolutionary rate was necessary to adequately explain the imbalance in species diversity. Species richness was also poorly explained by geographic distribution, especially once clade age and evolutionary rate shifts were accounted for, and may relate instead to other ecological factors. The global distribution of primate species diversity appears to have been strongly impacted by heterogeneity in evolutionary rates. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
Progress toward growing the primary care workforce is at risk of being derailed by an emerging crisis: a critical shortage of family medicine faculty. In response to the faculty shortage, the Society of Teachers of Family Medicine (STFM) launched a 2-year initiative called "Faculty for Tomorrow" (F4T). The F4T Task Force created a workshop designed to increase residents' interest in, and prepare them for, careers in academic family medicine. We aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of this workshop.
Participants were family medicine residents who preregistered for and attended the F4T Resident Workshop at the 2016 STFM Annual Spring Conference. The intervention was a full-day, 9-hour preconference workshop delivered by a multi-institutional faculty team. Participants were asked to complete a questionnaire before and immediately after the workshop. Data collected included demographics, residency program characteristics, future career plans, self-reported confidence in skills, and general knowledge relevant to becoming faculty.
A total of 75 participants attended the workshop. The proportion of those who were "extremely likely" to pursue a career in academic family medicine increased from 58% to 72%. Participants reported statistically significant improvements in their confidence in clinical teaching, providing feedback to learners, writing an effective CV, knowledge about the structure of academic family medicine, and knowledge about applying for a faculty position.
The STFM F4T Resident Workshop was effective at increasing participants' interest in academic careers, as well as self-reported confidence in skills and knowledge relevant to becoming faculty. The data collected from participants regarding their career plans may inform future interventions.
Encouraging resident scholarly activity has been a longstanding challenge for medical educators. The Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) has been increasing its emphasis on scholarly activity, forcing programs to evaluate their existing processes. This study sought to evaluate the impact of a scholarly activity point system on the resident scholarly productivity at multiple programs.
Five military family medicine residencies evaluated resident outcomes 2 years before and 2 years after the introduction of a scholarly activity point system. Outcome measures included peer-reviewed publications with a resident as first author, peer-reviewed publications with a resident as any author, resident presentation of scholarship at a regional, national, and international conference, IRB-approved protocols with a resident as principal investigator, and IRB-approved protocols with a resident in any role.
Four of the five programs experienced substantial increases in nearly every outcome. The fifth program, which had a more robust culture of inquiry at baseline, did not experience an increase in resident scholarly productivity.
A scholarly activity point system was associated with an increase in resident scholarly production in family medicine programs. It appears to work best in programs that start from a lower level of scholarly productivity at baseline. A point system appears to be a useful addition to scholarly activity curricula.
Group prenatal care has been shown to improve both maternal and neonatal outcomes. With increasing adaption of group prenatal care by family medicine residencies, this model may serve as a potential method to increase exposure to and interest in maternity care among trainees. This study aims to describe the penetration, regional and program variations, and potential impacts on future maternity care practice of group prenatal care in US family medicine residencies.
The CAFM Educational Research Alliance (CERA) conducted a survey of all US family medicine residency program directors in 2013 containing questions about maternity care training. A secondary data analysis was completed to examine relevant data on group prenatal care in US family medicine residencies and maternity care practice patterns.
23.1% of family medicine residency programs report provision of group prenatal care. Programs with group prenatal care reported increased number of vaginal deliveries per resident. Controlling for average number of vaginal deliveries per resident, programs with group prenatal care had a 2.35 higher odds of having more than 10% of graduates practice obstetrics and a 2.93 higher odds of having at least one graduate in the past 5 years enter an obstetrics fellowship.
Residency programs with group prenatal care models report more graduates entering OB fellowships and practicing maternity care. Implementing group prenatal care in residency training can be one method in a multifaceted approach to increasing maternity care practice among US family physicians.
Maternity care is an integral part of family medicine, and the quality and cost-effectiveness of maternity care provided by family physicians is well documented. Considering the population health perspective, increasing the number of family physicians competent to provide maternity care is imperative, as is working to overcome the barriers discouraging maternity care practice. A standard that clearly defines maternity care competency and a systematic set of tools to assess competency levels could help overcome these barriers. National discussions between 2012 and 2014 revealed that tools for competency assessment varied widely. These discussions resulted in the formation of a workgroup, culminating in a Family Medicine Maternity Care Summit in October 2014. This summit allowed for expert consensus to describe three scopes of maternity practice, draft procedural and competency assessment tools for each scope, and then revise the tools, guided by the Family Medicine and OB/GYN Milestones documents from the respective residency review committees. The summit group proposed that achievement of a specified number of procedures completed should not determine competency; instead, a standardized competency assessment should take place after a minimum number is performed. The traditionally held required numbers for core procedures were reassessed at the summit, and the resulting consensus opinion is proposed here. Several ways in which these evaluation tools can be disseminated and refined through the creation of a learning collaborative across residency programs is described. The summit group believed that standardization in training will more clearly define the competencies of family medicine maternity care providers and begin to reduce one of the barriers that may discourage family physicians from providing maternity care.
High-quality family medicine education is needed in sub-Saharan Africa to facilitate the future growth of primary care health systems. Current faculty educators recognize the value of dedicated teacher training and ongoing faculty development. However, they are constrained by inadequate faculty development program availability and institutional support.
A cross-sectional study design was used to conduct a qualitative needs assessment comprised of 37 in-depth, semi-structured interviews of individual faculty trainers from postgraduate family medicine training programs in eight sub-Saharan African countries. Data were analyzed according to qualitative description.
Informants described desired qualities for a family medicine educator in sub-Saharan Africa: (1) pedagogical expertise in topics and perspectives unique to family medicine, (2) engagement in self-directed, lifelong learning, and (3) exemplary character and behavior that inspires others. Informant recommendations to guide the development of faculty development programs include: (1) sustainability, partnership, and responsiveness to the needs of the institution, (2) intentional faculty development must begin early and be supported with high-quality mentorship, (3) presumptions of teaching competence based on clinical training must be overcome, and (4) evaluation and feedback are critical components of faculty development.
High-quality faculty development in family medicine is critically important to the primary care workforce in sub-Saharan Africa. Our study describes specific needs and recommendations for family medicine faculty development in sub-Saharan Africa. Next steps include piloting and evaluating innovative models of faculty development that respond to specific institutional or regional needs.
Reducing the shortage of primary care physicians in sub-Saharan Africa requires expansion of training programs in family medicine. Challenges remain in preparing, recruiting, and retaining faculty qualified to teach in these pioneering programs. Little is known about the unique faculty development needs of family medicine faculty within the sub-Saharan African context. The purpose of this study was to assess the current status and future needs for developing robust family medicine faculty in sub-Saharan Africa. The results are reported in two companion articles.
A cross-sectional study design was used to conduct a qualitative needs assessment comprising 37 in-depth, semi-structured interviews of individual faculty trainers from postgraduate family medicine training programs in eight sub-Saharan African countries. Data were analyzed according to qualitative description.
While faculty development opportunities in sub-Saharan Africa were identified, current faculty note many barriers to faculty development and limited participation in available programs. Faculty value teaching competency, but institutional structures do not provide adequate support.
Sub-Saharan African family physicians and postgraduate trainee physicians value good teachers and recognize that clinical training alone does not provide all of the skills needed by educators. The current status of limited resources of institutions and individuals constrain faculty development efforts. Where faculty development opportunities do exist, they are too infrequent or otherwise inaccessible to provide trainers the necessary skills to help them succeed as educators.
Monocyte Chemoattractant protein-induced protein 1 (MCPIP1), also known as Regnase-1, is encoded by the ZC3H12a gene, and it mediates inflammatory processes by regulating the stability of transcripts coding for proinflammatory cytokines and controlling activity of transcription factors, such as NF-κB and AP1. We found that MCPIP1 transcript and protein levels are strongly downregulated in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) samples, which were derived from patients surgically treated for renal cancer compared to surrounded normal tissues. Using Caki-1 cells as a model, we analyzed the role of MCPIP1 in cancer development. We showed that MCPIP1 expression depends on the proteasome activity; however, hypoxia and hypoxia inducible factor 2 alfa (HIF2α) are key factors lowering MCPIP1 expression. Furthermore, we found that MCPIP1 negatively regulates HIF1α and HIF2α levels and in the case of the last one, the mechanism is based on the regulation of the half time of transcript coding for HIF2α. Enhanced expression of MCPIP1 in Caki-1 cells results in a downregulation of transcripts encoding VEGFA, GLUT1, and IL-6. Furthermore, MCPIP1 decreases the activity of mTOR and protein kinase B (Akt) in normoxic conditions. Taken together, MCPIP1 contributes to the ccRCC development.
The IL-17 family cytokines IL-17A and IL-17C drive the pathogenesis of psoriatic skin inflammation, and anti-IL-17A Abs were recently approved to treat human psoriasis. Little is known about mechanisms that restrain IL-17 cytokine-mediated signaling, particularly IL-17C. In this article, we show that the endoribonuclease MCP-1-induced protein 1 (MCPIP1; also known as regnase-1) is markedly upregulated in human psoriatic skin lesions. Similarly, MCPIP1 was overexpressed in the imiquimod (IMQ)-driven mouse model of cutaneous inflammation. Mice with an MCPIP1 deficiency (Zc3h12a(+/-)) displayed no baseline skin inflammation, but they showed exacerbated pathology following IMQ treatment. Pathology in Zc3h12a(+/-) mice was associated with elevated expression of IL-17A- and IL-17C-dependent genes, as well as with increased accumulation of neutrophils in skin. However, IL-17A and IL-17C expression was unaltered, suggesting that the increased inflammation in Zc3h12a(+/-) mice was due to enhanced downstream IL-17R signaling. Radiation chimeras demonstrated that MCPIP1 in nonhematopoietic cells is responsible for controlling skin pathology. Moreover, Zc3h12a(+/-)Il17ra(-/-) mice given IMQ showed almost no disease. To identify which IL-17RA ligand was essential, Zc3h12a(+/-)Il17a(-/-) and Zc3h12a(+/-)Il17c(-/-) mice were given IMQ; these mice had reduced but not fully abrogated pathology, indicating that MCPIP1 inhibits IL-17A and IL-17C signaling. Confirming this hypothesis, Zc3h12a(-/-) keratinocytes showed increased responsiveness to IL-17A and IL-17C stimulation. Thus, MCPIP1 is a potent negative regulator of psoriatic skin inflammation through IL-17A and IL-17C. Moreover, to our knowledge, MCPIP1 is the first described negative regulator of IL-17C signaling.
Silicosis is characterized by the accumulation of fibroblasts and the excessive deposition of extracellular matrix. Fibroblast generation via endothelial-mesenchymal transition (EndMT) is one process responsible for this accumulation of fibroblasts. However, the mechanisms underlying EndMT remain unknown.
Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were exposed to SiO2 (50 µg/cm2). Specific endothelial and mesenchymal markers were evaluated using immunofluorescence and western blot analysis. Functional changes were evaluated by analyzing cell migration and proliferation. LC3-adenovirus transfections were performed, and changes in autophagy were measured using a marker of autophagy.
SiO2 induced decreases in the endothelial cell-specific markers in HUVECs while dramatically increasing mesenchymal cell product levels and mesenchymal functions. Although MCPIP1 expression increased in parallel with the increase in specific mesenchymal cell products, the MCPIP1 expression level was not consistent with the observed decrease in specific endothelial marker expression. Autophagy mediated the effects of MCPIP1, as rapamycin and 3-MA enhanced and attenuated the effect of SiO2 on HUVECs, respectively. MAPKs and the PI3K/Akt pathway were involved in the regulation of MCPIP1 by SiO2, and Pyk2 and MLC-2 mediated cell migration.
Our findings reveal a new potential function of MCPIP1, suggesting a possible mechanism of fibrosis in pulmonary silicosis.
Cellular signaling is in part regulated by the composition and subcellular localization of a series of protein interactions that collectively form a signaling complex. Using the α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (α7nAChR) as a proof-of-concept target, we developed a platform to identify functional modulators (or auxiliary proteins) of α7nAChR signaling. The Broad cDNA library was transiently cotransfected with α7nAChR cDNA in HEK293T cells in a high-throughput fashion. Using this approach in combination with a functional assay, we identified positive modulators of α7nAChR activity. We identified known positive modulators/auxiliary proteins present in the cDNA library that regulate α7nAChR signaling, in addition to identifying novel modulators of α7nAChR signaling. These included NACHO, SPDYE11, TCF4, and ZC3H12A, all of which increased PNU-120596-mediated nicotine-dependent calcium flux. Importantly, these auxiliary proteins did not modulate GluR1(o)-mediated Ca flux. To elucidate a possible mechanism of action, we employed an α7nAChR-HA surface staining assay. NACHO enhanced α7nAChR surface expression; however, the mechanism responsible for the SPDYE11-, TCF4-, and ZC3H12A-dependent modulation of α7nAChR has yet to be defined. This report describes the development and validation of a high-throughput, genome-wide cDNA screening platform coupled to FLIPR functional assays in order to identify functional modulators of α7nAChR signaling.
Silicosis is characterized by accumulation of fibroblasts and excessive deposition of extracellular matrix. Monocyte chemotactic protein-1-induced protein 1 (MCPIP1) plays a critical role in fibrosis induced by SiO2. However, the details of the downstream events of MCPIP1 activity in pulmonary fibrosis remain unclear. To elucidate the role of MCPIP1-induced autophagy in SiO2-induced fibrosis, both the upstream molecular mechanisms and the functional effects of SiO2 on cell apoptosis, proliferation and migration were investigated.
Experiments using primary cultures of alveolar macrophages from healthy donors and silicosis patients as well as differentiated U937 macrophages demonstrated the following results: 1) SiO2 induced macrophage autophagy in association with enhanced expression of MCPIP1; 2) autophagy promoted apoptosis and activation of macrophages exposed to SiO2, and these events induced the development of silicosis; 3) MCPIP1 facilitated macrophage apoptosis and activation via p53 signaling-mediated autophagy; and 4) SiO2-activated macrophages promoted the proliferation and migration of fibroblasts via the MCPIP1/p53-mediated autophagy pathway.
Our results elucidated a link between SiO2-induced fibrosis and MCPIP1/p53 signaling-mediated autophagy. These findings provide novel insight into the potential targeting of MCPIP1 or autophagy in the development of potential therapeutic strategies for silicosis.
Obesity is a global health issue, arousing interest in molecular mechanisms controlling fat. Transcriptional regulation of fat has received much attention, and key transcription factors involved in lipid metabolism, such as SBP-1/SREBP, LPD-2/C/EBP, and MDT-15, are conserved from nematodes to mammals. However, there is a growing awareness that lipid metabolism can also be controlled by post-transcriptional mechanisms. Here, we show that the Caenorhabditis elegans RNase, REGE-1, related to MCPIP1/Zc3h12a/Regnase-1, a key regulator of mammalian innate immunity, promotes accumulation of body fat. Using exon-intron split analysis, we find that REGE-1 promotes fat by degrading the mRNA encoding ETS-4, a fat-loss-promoting transcription factor. Because ETS-4, in turn, induces rege-1 transcription, REGE-1 and ETS-4 appear to form an auto-regulatory module. We propose that this type of fat regulation may be of key importance when, if faced with an environmental change, an animal must rapidly but precisely remodel its metabolism.
The mechanisms regulating transcript turnover are key processes in the regulation of gene expression. The list of proteins involved in mRNAs' degradation is still growing, however, the details of RNase-mRNAs interactions are not fully understood. ZC3H12A is a recently discovered inflammation-related RNase engaged in the control of proinflammatory cytokine transcript turnover. ZC3H12A also regulates its own transcript half-live. Here, we studied the details of this regulation. Our results confirm the importance of the 3'UTR in ZC3H12A-dependent ZC3H12A mRNA degradation. We compared the mouse and human stemloop structures present in this region and discovered that the human conserved stem-loop structure is not sufficient for ZC3H12A-dependent degradation. However, this structure is important for the ZC3H12A mRNA post-transcriptional regulation. Our studies emphasize the importance of the neighboring features of the identified stem-loop structure for its biological activity. Removal of this region together with the stem-loop structure greatly inhibits the ZC3H12A regulation of the investigated 3'-untranslated region (3'UTR).
ZC3H12D belongs to a recently discovered family of proteins containing four members of which the most studied and best described is the RNase ZC3H12A (MCPIP1/Regnase-1). ZC3H12A is a crucial negative regulator of inflammation. It accelerates the turnover of transcripts of a spectrum of proinflammatory cytokines, as well as its own mRNA. The biological role of ZC3H12D is less clear, although it was shown that this member of ZC3H12 family is also involved in the regulation of inflammation. Here, we show that ZC3H12A and ZC3H12D recognize a set of common target mRNAs encoding proteins that play important roles in the course of the inflammation. Similarly to ZC3H12A, ZC3H12D participates in the 3'UTR-dependent regulation of the turnover of mRNAs encoding interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor (TNF), and immediate early response 3 gene (IER3). The ZC3H12A mRNA is also among the identified ZC3H12D targets. Using the combination of immunofluorescence with single molecule RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization (smRNA FISH) we have shown that ZC3H12D protein interacts with the ZC3H12A transcript. The direct binding of these two molecules in vivo was further confirmed by RNA immunoprecipitation. Simultaneously, overexpression of ZC3H12D increases the turnover rate of transcripts containing ZC3H12A 3'UTR. Using reporter gene assays we have confirmed that the Asp95 residue present in the NYN/PIN-like domain is crucial for ZC3H12D biological activity. We have also revealed that ZC3H12D recognizes the same structural elements present in the 3'UTRs of the investigated transcripts, as ZC3H12A. J. Cell. Biochem. 118: 487-498, 2017. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
ZC3H12A, which encodes the RNase monocyte chemotactic protein-induced protein 1 (MCPIP1), is up-regulated in psoriatic skin and reduced to normal levels after clinical treatments with anti-IL-17A/IL-17R neutralizing antibodies. In IL-17A-stimulated keratinocytes, MCPIP1 is rapidly increased at the transcript and protein levels. Also, IL-17A was found to be the main inducer of ZC3H12A expression in keratinocytes treated with supernatants derived from a Streptococcus pyogenes-activated psoriatic ex vivo model based on the co-culture of psoriatic cutaneous lymphocyte-associated antigen (CLA(+)) T cells and lesional epidermal cells. Moreover, MCPIP1 was aberrantly distributed in the suprabasal layers of psoriatic epidermis. In psoriatic samples, IL-17A-stimulated epidermal cell suspensions showed an increased MCPIP1 expression, especially in the mid-differentiated cellular compartment. The knockdown of ZC3H12A showed that this RNase participates in the regulation of the mRNAs present in suprabasal differentiated keratinocytes. Furthermore, JAK/STAT3 inhibition prevented the IL-17A-dependent induction of MCPIP1. In the mouse model of imiquimod-induced psoriasis, Zc3h12a expression was abrogated in Il17ra(-/-) mice. These results support the notion that IL-17A-mediated induction of MCPIP1 is involved in the regulation of local altered gene expression in suprabasal epidermal layers in psoriasis.
Regnase-1 is an RNase that directly cleaves mRNAs of inflammatory genes such as IL-6 and IL-12p40, and negatively regulates cellular inflammatory responses. Here, we report the structures of four domains of Regnase-1 from Mus musculus-the N-terminal domain (NTD), PilT N-terminus like (PIN) domain, zinc finger (ZF) domain and C-terminal domain (CTD). The PIN domain harbors the RNase catalytic center; however, it is insufficient for enzymatic activity. We found that the NTD associates with the PIN domain and significantly enhances its RNase activity. The PIN domain forms a head-to-tail oligomer and the dimer interface overlaps with the NTD binding site. Interestingly, mutations blocking PIN oligomerization had no RNase activity, indicating that both oligomerization and NTD binding are crucial for RNase activity in vitro. These results suggest that Regnase-1 RNase activity is tightly controlled by both intramolecular (NTD-PIN) and intermolecular (PIN-PIN) interactions.
Myasthenia gravis (MG) is an antibody-mediated autoimmune disease characterized by exertional weakness. There is no biomarker to reflect disease activity and guide treatment decision. Here, we reported a pilot blood transcriptome study using RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) that identified differences of 5 samples in active status and 5 in remission from 8 different patients and 2 patients provided samples for both active and remission phase. We found a total of 28 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) possibly related to disease activity (23 up-regulated and 5 down-regulated). The DEGs were enriched for the cell motion and cell migration processes in which included were ICAM1, CCL3, S100P and GAB2. The apoptosis and cell death pathway was also significantly enriched, which includes NFKBIA, ZC3H12A, TNFAIP3, and PPP1R15A. Our result suggests that transcript abundance profiles of the genes involved in cell trafficking and apoptosis may be a molecular signature of the disease activity in MG patients.
The ability of cancer cells to evade apoptosis is dictated by a shift in the balance between proapoptotic and antiapoptotic gene expression programs. Monocyte chemotactic protein-induced protein 1 (MCPIP1) is a zinc-finger RNA binding protein with important roles in mediating inflammatory responses. Overexpression of MCPIP1 in different cancer cell types has been implicated in eliciting an antitumor response, but a direct role of MCPIP1 in apoptosis has not been established. In this study, we demonstrate that MCPIP1 functions as a potent tumor suppressor that induces apoptosis of breast tumor cells by selectively enhancing mRNA decay of antiapoptotic gene transcripts, including Bcl2L1, Bcl2A1, RelB, Birc3, and Bcl3. Mechanistically, MCPIP1 physically interacted with a stem-loop structure in the 3' untranslated region of these transcripts through its PIN domain, causing mRNA destabilization. Furthermore, we found that MCPIP1 expression was repressed in breast tumor cells, and overexpression of MCPIP1 induced apoptosis, whereas its depletion enhanced cancer cell proliferation. Moreover, MCPIP1 induction in vivo resulted in complete regression of established tumors and a significant reduction in metastatic disease. Notably, low MCPIP1 expression in tumor samples from breast cancer patients was strongly associated with poor survival over 13 years of follow-up. Collectively, our results highlight that MCPIP1 is a new tumor suppressor in breast cancer that induces cell death by tipping the balance in favor of proapoptotic gene expression.
We report that the addition of an host paracaspase MALT1 inhibitor, MI-2, to HIV latently infected ACH-2, Jurkat E4, and J-LAT cells accelerated cell death in the presence of cell stimuli or the protein kinase C agonist, bryostatin 1. MI-2-mediated cell death correlated with the induction of the cellular RNase MCPIP1 and requires the presence of viral component(s). Altogether, the combination of MI-2 and bryostatin 1 displays selective killing of HIV latently infected CD4(+) T cells.
Hypercholesterolemia is an important risk factor for atherosclerosis and cholesterol treatment would cause multiple damages, including DNA damage, on endothelial cells. In this work, we have used human umbilical vein endothelial cell line (HUVEC) to explore the mechanism of cholesterol induced damage. We have found that cholesterol treatment on HUVEC could induce the expression of MCPIP1. When given 12.5 mg/L cholesterol on HUVEC, the expression of MCPIP1 starts to increase since 4 hr after treatment and at 24 hr after treatment it could reach to 10 fold of base line level. We hypothesis this induction of MCPIP1 may contribute to the damaging process and we have used siRNA of MCPIP1 in further research. This MCPIP1 siRNA (siMCPIP) could down regulate MCPIP1 by 73.4% and when using this siRNA on HUVECs, we could see the cholesterol induced DNA damage have been reduced. We have detected DNA damage by γH2AX foci formation in nuclear, γH2AX protein level and COMET assay. Compare to cholesterol alone group, siMCPIP group shows much less γH2AX foci formation in nuclear after cholesterol treatment, less γH2AX protein level in cell and also less tail moment detected in COMET assay. We have also seen that using siMCPIP1 could result in less reactive oxygen species (ROS) in cell after cholesterol treatment. We have also seen that using siMCPIP could reduce the protein level of Nox4 and p47(phox), two major regulators in ROS production. These results suggest that MCPIP1 may play an important role in cholesterol induced damage.
Silicosis is a systemic disease caused by inhaling silicon dioxide (SiO2). Phagocytosis of SiO2 in the lungs initiates an inflammatory cascade that results in fibroblast proliferation and migration followed by fibrosis. According to previous data from our laboratory, monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) plays a critical role in fibroblast proliferation and migration in conventional two-dimensional (2D) monolayer cultures. The present study aimed to explore the downstream cascade of MCP-1 in both 2D and three-dimensional (3D) cell culture models of silicosis. Experiments using primary cultured adult human pulmonary fibroblasts (HPF-a) demonstrated the following: 1) SiO2 treatment induces expression of MCP-1-induced protein (MCPIP1) in a time- and dose-dependent manner in both 2D and 3D cultures; 2) the MAPK and phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathways are involved in SiO2-induced MCPIP1 expression; and 3) MCPIP1 induction mediates the SiO2-induced increase in cell migration in both 2D and 3D cultures. The effect of MCP-1 in silicosis occurs mainly through MCPIP1, which, in turn, mediates the observed SiO2-induced increase in pulmonary fibroblast migration. However, the time frame for MCPIP1 induction differed between 2D and 3D cultures, indicating that, compared with conventional 2D cell culture systems, 3D culture may be useful for analyses of fibroblast physiology under conditions that more closely resemble in vivo environments. Our study determined the link between fibroblast-derived MCPIP1 and SiO2-induced cell migration, and this finding provides novel evidence of the potential of MCPIP1 in the development of novel therapeutic strategies for silicosis.
Bone adaptation to mechanical loading is regulated via signal transduction by mechano-sensing osteocytes. Mineral-embedded osteocytes experience strain-induced interstitial fluid flow and fluid shear stress, and broad shifts in gene expression are key components in the signaling pathways that regulate bone turnover. RNA sequencing analysis, or RNA-Seq, enables more complete characterization of mechano-responsive transcriptome regulation than previously possible. We hypothesized that RNA-Seq of osteocytic MLO-Y4 cells reveals both expected and novel gene transcript regulation in cells previously fluid flowed and analyzed using gene microarrays. MLO-Y4 cells were flowed for 2h with 1Pa oscillating fluid shear stress and post-incubated 2h. RNA-Seq of original samples detected 55 fluid flow-regulated gene transcripts (p-corrected &lt;0.05), the same number previously detected by microarray. However, RNA-Seq demonstrated greater dynamic range, with all 55 transcripts increased &gt;1.5-fold or decreased &lt;0.67-fold whereas 10 of 55 met this cut-off by microarray. Analyses were complimentary in patterns of regulation, though only 6 transcripts were significant in both RNA-Seq and microarray analyses: Cxcl5, Cxcl1, Zc3h12a, Ereg, Slc2a1, and Egln1. As part of a broad inflammatory response inferred by gene ontology analyses, we again observed greatest up-regulation of inflammatory C-X-C motif chemokines, and newly implicated HIF-1α and AMPK signaling pathways. Importantly, we detected both expected fluid flow-sensitive transcripts (e.g. Nos2 [iNOS], Ptgs2 [COX-2], Ccl7) and transcripts not previously identified as flow-sensitive, e.g. Ccl2. We found RNA-Seq advantageous over microarrays because of its greater dynamic range and ability to analyze unbiased estimation of gene expression, informing our understanding of osteocyte signaling.
Although the concept of combining immunofluorescence (IF) with single-molecule RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization (smRNA FISH) seems obvious, the specific materials used during IF and smRNA FISH make it difficult to perform these procedures simultaneously on the same specimen. Even though there are reports where IF and smRNA FISH were combined with success, these were insufficient in terms of signal intensities, staining patterns, and GFP-compatibility, and a detailed exploration of the various factors that influence IF and smRNA FISH outcome has not been published yet. Here, we report a detailed study of conditions and reagents used in classic IF and smRNA FISH that allowed us to establish an easy, robust, and GFP-compatible procedure. Our protocol enables simultaneous detection of mRNA and protein quantity as well as the subcellular distribution of these molecules in single cells by combining an RNase-free modification of the IF technique and the more recent smRNA FISH method. Using this procedure, we have shown the direct interaction of RNase MCPIP1 with IL-6 mRNA. We also demonstrate the use of our protocol in heterogeneous cell population analysis, revealing cell-to-cell differences in mRNA and protein content.
IL-6 is an inflammatory cytokine and its overexpression plays an important role in osteoarthritis (OA) pathogenesis. Expression of IL-6 is regulated post-transcriptionally by MCPIP1. The 3' untranslated region (UTR) of MCPIP1 mRNA harbors a miR-139 'seed sequence', therefore we examined the post-transcriptional regulation of MCPIP1 by miR-139 and its impact on IL-6 expression in OA chondrocytes. Expression of miR-139 was found to be high in the damaged portion of the OA cartilage compared with unaffected cartilage from the same patient and was also induced by IL-1β in OA chondrocytes. Inhibition of miR-139 decreased the expression of IL-6 mRNA by 38% and of secreted IL-6 protein by 40%. However, overexpression of miR-139 increased the expression of IL-6 mRNA by 36% and of secreted IL-6 protein by 56%. These data correlated with altered expression profile of MCPIP1 in transfected chondrocytes. Studies with a luciferase reporter construct confirmed the interactions of miR-139 with the 'seed sequence' located in the 3' UTR of MCPIP mRNA. Furthermore, miR-139 overexpression increased the catabolic gene expression but expression of anabolic markers remained unchanged. Overexpression of miR-139 also induced apoptosis in OA chondrocytes. Importantly, we also discovered that IL-6 is a potent inducer of miR-139 expression in OA chondrocytes. These findings indicate that miR-139 functions as a post-transcriptional regulator of MCPIP1 expression and enhances IL-6 expression, which further upregulates miR-139 expression in OA chondrocytes. These results support our hypothesis that miR-139-mediated downregulation of MCPIP1 promotes IL-6 expression in OA. Therefore, targeting miR-139 could be therapeutically beneficial in the management of OA.
T follicular helper (Tfh) cells are crucial to induce protective extrafollicular and germinal center antibody responses against protein antigens. Over the last decade, control of Tfh cell numbers has emerged as an important regulatory checkpoint which, when perturbed, may lead to production of autoantibodies. Recent progress in understanding how Tfh cells are kept limiting has revealed an important role for posttranscriptional control of gene expression mediated by microRNAs such as miR-17 ∼ 92, miR-155 and miR-146a, and the RNA-binding proteins Roquin and Regnase. Additionally, T cell microRNAs dysregulated in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus have been shown to influence processes such as DNA hypomethylation, IL-2 and CCL5 secretion, and Treg function, which contribute to autoantibody formation and tissue damage.
The fibroblast-populated three-dimensional (3-D) collagen matrix has been used to model matrix contraction, cell motility, and general fibroblast biology. MCPIP1 (monocyte chemotactic protein-induced protein 1) has been shown to regulate inflammation, angiogenesis, and cellular motility. In the present study, we demonstrated induction of MCPIP1 in human fibroblasts embedded in the stress-released 3-D collagen matrix, which occurred through activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases, phosphoinositide 3-kinase, and NF-κB. Furthermore, MCPIP1 induction was associated with inhibition of fibroblast migration out of the nested collagen matrix. MCPIP1 induction or ectopic expression also upregulated p53. RNA interference of p53 prevented the inhibition of migration produced by induction or ectopic expression of MCPIP1. Our findings suggest a new role for MCPIP1 as a molecular switch that regulates fibroblast migration in the nested collagen matrix model.
A group of novel chalcone derivatives comprising hydroxamic acid or 2-aminobenzamide group as zinc binding groups (ZBG) were synthesized. The structure of the prepared compounds was fully characterized by IR, NMR and elemental microanalyses. Most of the tested compounds displayed strong to moderate HDAC inhibitory activity. Some of these compounds showed potent anti-proliferative activity against human HepG2, MCF-7 and HCT-116 cell lines. In particular, compounds 4a and 4b exhibited significant anti-proliferative activity against the three cell lines compared to SAHA as reference drug and displayed promising profile as anti-tumor candidates. The results indicated that these chalcone derivatives could serve as a promising lead compounds for further optimization as antitumor agents.
Zinc-finger BED domain-containing 3 (Zbed3) is a member of the zinc-finger domain protein superfamily. Recent studies have shown that Zbed3 is associated with insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes mellitus. However, no report has demonstrated the association of Zbed3 with metabolic syndrome (MetS) in humans. The purpose of this study is to examine the association between Zbed3 and MetS in a cross-sectional study.
We conducted a cross-sectional study of a Chinese population, including 167 non-MetS subjects and 144 newly diagnosed MetS (nMetS) patients. Circulating Zbed3 levels were examined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The relationship between circulating Zbed3 levels and the components of MetS was assessed.
Circulating Zbed3 levels were significantly higher in nMetS patients than in non-MetS subjects (134.6 ± 32.1 vs. 106.5 ± 26.1 ng/L, P &lt; 0.01). Circulating Zbed3 correlated positively with markers of adiposity (waist circumference, P &lt; 0.01). It also correlated with glucose and lipid parameters (increasing fasting blood glucose and triglycerides and decreasing high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, all P &lt; 0.01) and blood pressure (elevating systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure, both P &lt; 0.01) and inflammatory marker (elevating tumor necrosis factor alpha, P &lt; 0.01). The relative risks for MetS showed significant elevation with an increase in Zbed3 quartiles. Circulating levels of Zbed3 were progressively elevated with an increased number of components of MetS.
These data suggest that Zbed3 may correlate with the pathogenesis of MetS in humans.

The amino acid condensation reaction on a heterogeneous mineral surface has been regarded as one of the important pathways for peptide bond formation. Keeping this in view, we have studied the oligomerization of the simple amino acids, glycine and alanine, on nickel ferrite (NiFe₂O₄), cobalt ferrite (CoFe₂O₄), copper ferrite (CuFe₂O₄), zinc ferrite (ZnFe₂O₄), and manganese ferrite (MnFe₂O₄) nanoparticles surfaces, in the temperature range from 50-120 °C for 1-35 days, without applying any wetting/drying cycles. Among the metal ferrites tested for their catalytic activity, NiFe₂O₄ produced the highest yield of products by oligomerizing glycine to the trimer level and alanine to the dimer level, whereas MnFe₂O₄ was the least efficient catalyst, producing the lowest yield of products, as well as shorter oligomers of amino acids under the same set of experimental conditions. It produced primarily diketopiperazine (Ala) with a trace amount of alanine dimer from alanine condensation, while glycine was oligomerized to the dimer level. The trend in product formation is in accordance with the surface area of the minerals used. A temperature as low as 50 °C can even favor peptide bond formation in the present study, which is important in the sense that the condensation process is highly feasible without any sort of localized heat that may originate from volcanoes or hydrothermal vents. However, at a high temperature of 120 °C, anhydrides of glycine and alanine formation are favored, while the optimum temperature for the highest yield of product formation was found to be 90 °C.
Adenosine deaminases acting on RNA (ADARs) are zinc-containing enzymes that deaminate adenosine bases to inosines within dsRNA regions in transcripts. In short, structured dsRNA hairpins individual adenosine bases may be targeted specifically and edited with up to one hundred percent efficiency, leading to the production of alternative protein variants. However, the majority of editing events occur within longer stretches of dsRNA formed by pairing of repetitive sequences. Here, many different adenosine bases are potential targets but editing efficiency is usually much lower. Recent work shows that ADAR RNA editing is also required to prevent aberrant activation of antiviral innate immune sensors that detect viral dsRNA in the cytoplasm. Missense mutations in the ADAR1 RNA editing enzyme causes a fatal auto-inflammatory disease, Aicardi-Goutières syndrome (AGS) in affected children. In addition RNA editing by ADARs has been observed to increase in many cancers and also can contribute to vascular disease. Thus the role of RNA editing in the progression of various diseases can no longer be ignored. The ability of ADARs to alter the sequence of RNAs has also been used to artificially target model RNAs in vitro and in cells for RNA editing. Potentially this approach may be used to repair genetic defects and to alter genetic information at the RNA level. In this review we focus on the role of ADARs in disease development and progression and on their potential use to artificially modify RNAs in a targeted manner.
LiZn ferrite ceramics with high saturation magnetization (4πMs) and low ferromagnetic resonance line widths (ΔH) represent a very critical class of material for microwave ferrite devices. Many existing approaches emphasize promotion of the grain growth (average size is 10-50 μm) of ferrite ceramics to improve the gyromagnetic properties at relatively low sintering temperatures. This paper describes a new strategy for obtaining uniform and compact LiZn ferrite ceramics (average grains size is ∼2 μm) with enhanced magnetic performance by suppressing grain growth in great detail. The LiZn ferrites with a formula of Li0.415Zn0.27Mn0.06Ti0.1Fe2.155O4 were prepared by solid reaction routes with two new sintering strategies. Interestingly, results show that uniform, compact, and pure spinel ferrite ceramics were synthesized at a low temperature (∼850 °C) without obvious grain growth. We also find that a fast second sintering treatment (FSST) can further improve their gyromagnetic properties, such as higher 4πMs and lower ΔH. The two new strategies are facile and efficient for densification of LiZn ferrite ceramics via suppressing grain growth at low temperatures. The sintering strategy reported in this study also provides a referential experience for other ceramics, such as soft magnetism ferrite ceramics or dielectric ceramics.
We report the first preparation of a symmetric tetrathiafulvalene (TTF)-pyridyl thiolato zinc(ii) complex in which two TTF parts connect to the central zinc atom through pyridines and thiolates. We also discuss the crystal structure analysis and physical properties of the complex, especially photocurrent generations measured on its thin-film sample and single crystal.
Aluminium (Al)-doped zinc oxide (ZnO) nanowires (NWs) with a unique core-shell structure and a Δ-doping profile at the interface were successfully grown using a combination of chemical vapor deposition re-growth and few-layer AlxOy atomic layer deposition. Unlike the conventional heavy doping which degrades the near-band-edge (NBE) luminescence and increases the electron-phonon coupling (EPC), it was found that there was an over 20-fold enhanced NBE emission and a notably-weakened EPC in this type of interfacially Al-doped ZnO NWs. Further experiments revealed a greatly suppressed nonradiative decay process and a much enhanced radiative recombination rate. By comparing the finite-difference time-domain simulation with the experimental results from intentionally designed different NWs, this enhanced radiative decay rate was attributed to the Purcell effect induced by the confined and intensified optical field within the interfacial layer. The ability to manipulate the confinement, transport and relaxation dynamics of ZnO excitons can be naturally guaranteed with this unique interfacial Δ-doping strategy, which is certainly desirable for the applications using ZnO-based nano-photonic and nano-optoelectronic devices.
Phelan McDermid Syndrome (PMDS) is a genetic disorder characterized by features of Autism spectrum disorders. Similar to reports of Zn deficiency in autistic children, we have previously reported high incidence of Zn deficiency in PMDS. However, the underlying mechanisms are currently not well understood. Here, using inductively coupled plasma mass-spectrometry to measure the concentration of Zinc (Zn) and Copper (Cu) in hair samples from individuals with PMDS with 22q13.3 deletion including SHANK3 (SH3 and multiple ankyrin repeat domains 3), we report a high rate of abnormally low Zn/Cu ratios. To investigate possible underlying mechanisms, we generated enterocytes from PMDS patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells and used Caco-2 cells with knockdown of SHANK3. We detected decreased expression of Zn uptake transporters ZIP2 and ZIP4 on mRNA and protein level correlating with SHANK3 expression levels, and found reduced levels of ZIP4 protein co-localizing with SHANK3 at the plasma membrane. We demonstrated that especially ZIP4 exists in a complex with SHANK3. Furthermore, we performed immunohistochemistry on gut sections from Shank3αβ knockout mice and confirmed a link between enterocytic SHANK3, ZIP2 and ZIP4. We conclude that apart from its well-known role in the CNS, SHANK3 might play a specific role in the GI tract.
Because they generate excellent images, nanoparticles (NPs), especially biosynthesized NPs, provide a new solution for tumor imaging. In this research, we unveil a novel type of biosynthesized NPs featuring multicolor fluorescence. These NPs exhibit little cytotoxicity to cells. The explored NPs, designated Zn-ZFP-GST NPs (Zinc NPs in abbreviation), are generated from leukemia cells treated with a Zn(2+) solution, while zinc-finger protein and glutathione S-transferase (GST) were also identified in the Zinc NPs. Under near-UV illumination, the Zinc NPs simultaneously emit green, yellow, and red fluorescence. In addition, the intensity of the fluorescence increases with the existence of sulfides. Besides, the NPs are encapsulated by microvesicles (MVs) shed from the plasma membrane. As observed in whole-body research of nude mice, the NP-MVs migrate via blood circulation and are distinguished by their fluorescent signals. Furthermore, the folic acid (FA) &amp;AVR2 (human VEGF antibody)-coated NP-MVs are exploited to target the tumor location, and the feasibility of this approach has been confirmed empirically. The Zinc NPs shed light on an alternative solution to tumor detection.
To develop an effective and sustainable cell therapy for sickle cell disease (SCD), we investigated the feasibility of targeted disruption of the BCL11A gene, either within exon 2 or at the GATAA motif in the intronic erythroid-specific enhancer, using zinc finger nucleases in human bone marrow (BM) CD34(+) hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs). Both targeting strategies upregulated fetal globin expression in erythroid cells to levels predicted to inhibit hemoglobin S polymerization. However, complete inactivation of BCL11A resulting from bi-allelic frameshift mutations in BCL11A exon 2 adversely affected erythroid enucleation. In contrast, bi-allelic disruption of the GATAA motif in the erythroid enhancer of BCL11A did not negatively impact enucleation. Furthermore, BCL11A exon 2-edited BM-CD34(+) cells demonstrated a significantly reduced engraftment potential in immunodeficient mice. Such an adverse effect on HSPC function was not observed upon BCL11A erythroid-enhancer GATAA motif editing, because enhancer-edited CD34(+) cells achieved robust long-term engraftment and gave rise to erythroid cells with elevated levels of fetal globin expression when chimeric BM was cultured ex vivo. Altogether, our results support further clinical development of the BCL11A erythroid-specific enhancer editing in BM-CD34(+) HSPCs as an autologous stem cell therapy in SCD patients.
The main objectives of this study were for comparing the effect of batteries and deep litter rearing systems of domesticated Japanese quail, Coturnix coturnix japonica, on the concentration levels of cadmium, copper, lead, and zinc from the quail meat and offal in Ismailia, Egypt.
A total of 40 quail meat and their offal samples were randomly collected from two main quail rearing systems: Battery (Group I) and deep litter system (Group II) for determination of concentration levels of cadmium, copper, lead, and zinc. In addition, 80 water and feed samples were randomly collected from water and feeders of both systems in the Food Hygiene Laboratory, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Suez Canal University for heavy metals determination.
The mean concentration levels of cadmium, copper, lead, and zinc in Group I were 0.010, 0.027, 1.137, and 0.516 ppm and for Group II were 0.093, 0.832, 0.601, and 1.651 ppm, respectively. The mean concentration levels of cadmium, copper, lead, and zinc in quail feed in Group I were 1.114, 1.606, 5.822, and 35.11 ppm and for Group II were 3.010, 2.576, 5.852, and 23.616 ppm, respectively. The mean concentration levels of cadmium, copper, lead, and zinc in quail meat for Group I were 0.058, 5.902, 10.244, and 290 ppm and for Group II were 0.086, 6.092, 0.136, and 1.280 ppm, respectively. The mean concentration levels of cadmium, copper, lead, and zinc for liver samples in Group I were 0.15, 8.32, 1.05, and 3.41 ppm and for Group II were 0.13, 8.88, 0.95, and 4.21 ppm, respectively. The mean concentration levels of cadmium, copper, lead, and zinc in kidney samples for the Group I were 0.24, 4.21, 1.96, and 4.03 ppm and for Group II were 0.20, 5.00, 1.56, and 3.78 ppm, respectively. Kidney had the highest concentration levels of heavy metals followed by liver then muscles. The highest concentration levels of copper were observed in liver samples. The order of the levels of these trace elements obtained from the four different quail organs is Ca &gt; Pb &gt; Zn &gt; Cu. Lead and cadmium concentration levels in quail meat samples were exceeded the Egyptian standardization limits and suggesting a health threat from lead and cadmium to the quail consumers.
Battery rearing system is more hygienic than deep litter system from the point of heavy metals pollution of water and feeds of quail. Feed samples from battery system had means concentration levels of lead not significantly higher (p&gt;0.05) than those samples from deep litter system. Meanwhile, water samples from battery system had means concentration levels of cadmium, copper, and zinc significantly higher (p&gt;0.05) than those samples from deep litter system. Quail may carry health risks to consumers.
The aim of the study was to investigate if alcohol and disulfiram (DSF) individually and in combination affect bioelements' and red-ox homeostasis in testes of the exposed rats. The animals were divided into groups according to the duration of treatment (21 and/or 42 days): C21/C42 groups (controls); OL21/OL42 groups (0.5 mL olive oil intake); A1-21 groups (3 mL 20% ethanol intake); DSF1-21 groups (178.5 mg DSF/kg/day); and A21+DSF22-42 groups (the DSF ingestion followed previous 21 days' treatment with alcohol). The measured parameters in testes are: metals: zinc (Zn), copper (Cu), iron (Fe), magnesium (Mg) and selenium(Se); as well as oxidative stress (OS) parameters: superoxide anion radical (O2(●-)), glutathione reduced (GSH) and oxidized (GSSG), malondialdehyde (MDA), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) decomposition and activities of total superoxide dismutase (tSOD), glutathione-S-transferase (GST) and glutathione reductase (GR). Metal status is changed in all experimental groups (Fe rise and Zn fall; and additionally, Cu increase A21+DSF24-32 groups). Development of OS was demonstrated in A1-21 groups, but not in DSF1-21 groups. In A21+DSF2242 groups, OS was partially reduced compared to A groups (A1-21 &gt; MDA &gt; C, A1-21 &lt; GSH &lt; C). High metal-binding affinity of DSF/DDTC changes red-ox homeostasis in rat testes.
Osteopontin (OPN), an extracellular matrix (ECM) glyco-phosphoprotein, plays an important role in autoimmune-mediated demyelinating diseases, including multiple sclerosis and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). As an integrin and CD44 binding protein it participates in bidirectional communication between the ECM and target cells and affects transduction pathways that maintain neuronal and immune cells homeostasis. Its biological activity is also heavily influenced by microenvironment, which stimulates the cleavage of OPN and changes its functions. In this study we estimated the expression profile of OPN in neural tissues of DA rats during the first relapse of chronic relapsing EAE and investigated the relationship of OPN to metallothionein I+II (MTs), which injury and play pivotal role in zinc-related cell homeostasis. The data showed that in EAE rats OPN mRNA and protein levels increased concurrently with the transcription of MTs and that within the spinal cord (SC) lysates EAE-afflicted rats had a higher content of OPN fragments of low molecular weight than untreated and CFA-treated rats. The expression of OPN and MTs was upregulated on ependymal, lymphoid and astroglial cells and on multiple αvβ3+ neurons in SC and in the brain (cortex, white matter, hippocampus, and cerebellum). Besides, multiple cells co-expressed OPN and MTs. Granular OPN signals were detected in secretory vesicles of Golgy (αvβ3 neurons) and in patches adjacent to the plasma membrane (subventricular zone). The findings imply that in demyelinating lesions are generated proteolytic OPN fragments and that OPN/MTs interactions contribute to tissue remodeling during an autoimmune attack.
A panel of 22 phenols was investigated as inhibitors of the β-class carbonic anhydrase (CAs, EC 4.2.1.1) from the fungal parasite Malassezia globosa (MgCA), a validated anti-dandruff drug target. The displayed inhibitory activities were compared to the ones previously reported against the off-target widely distributed human (h) isoforms hCA I and II. All tested phenols possessed a better efficacy in inhibiting MgCA than the clinically used sulfonamide acetazolamide, with KIs in the range of 2.5 and 65.0μM. A homology-built model of MgCA was also used for understanding the binding mode of phenols to the fungal enzyme. Indeed, a wide network of hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions between the phenol and active site residues were evidenced. The OH moiety of the inhibitor was observed anchored to the zinc-coordinated water, also making hydrogen bonds with Ser48 and Asp49. The diverse substituents at the phenolic scaffold were observed to interact with different portions of the hydrophobic pocket according to their nature and position. Considering the effective MgCA inhibitory properties of phenols, beside to the rather low inhibition against the off-target hCA I and II, this class of compounds might be of considerable interest in the cosmetics field as potential anti-dandruff drugs.
Zinc contamination in near- and sub-surface environments is a serious threat to many ecosystems and to public health. Sufficient understanding of Zn speciation and transport mechanisms is therefore critical to evaluating its risk to the environment and to developing remediation strategies. The geochemical and mineralogical characteristics of contaminated soils in the vicinity of a Zn ore transportation route were thoroughly investigated using a variety of analytical techniques (sequential extraction, XRF, XRD, SEM, and XAFS). Imported Zn-concentrate (ZnS) was deposited in a receiving facility and dispersed over time to the surrounding roadside areas and rice-paddy soils. Subsequent physical and chemical weathering resulted in dispersal into the subsurface. The species identified in the contaminated areas included Zn-sulfide, Zn-carbonate, other O-coordinated Zn-minerals, and Zn species bound to Fe/Mn oxides or clays, as confirmed by XAFS spectroscopy and sequential extraction. The observed transformation from S-coordinated Zn to O-coordinated Zn associated with minerals suggests that this contaminant can change into more soluble and labile forms as a result of weathering. For the purpose of developing a soil washing remediation process, the contaminated samples were extracted with dilute acids. The extraction efficiency increased with the increase of O-coordinated Zn relative to S-coordinated Zn in the sediment. This study demonstrates that improved understanding of Zn speciation in contaminated soils is essential for well-informed decision making regarding metal mobility and toxicity, as well as for choosing an appropriate remediation strategy using soil washing.
To examine the role of iron and zinc in arsenic excretion and metabolism in children.
An analysis of urinary arsenic (UAs) concentrations from a double-blind randomized trial originally testing the efficacy of iron and zinc for lowering blood lead levels in children. A 2 × 2 factorial design was used, with children randomized individually, stratified by sex and classroom, to receive 30 mg ferrous fumarate (n = 148), 30 mg zinc oxide (n = 144), iron and zinc together (n = 148), or placebo (n = 151). Of the 602 children enrolled, 527 completed the 6-month treatment, and 485 had both baseline and final UAs values. The baseline total UAs concentration ranged from 3.2 to 215.9 µg/L.
At baseline, children in the highest tertile of serum ferritin concentration had higher excretion of dimethylarsinic acid (DMA; 1.93 ± 0.86%; P &lt; .05), but lower excretion of monomethylarsonic acid (-0.91 ± 0.39%; P &lt; .05), compared with children in the lowest tertile. In an intention-to-treat analysis, iron had no effect on arsenic methylation or UAs excretion, but children receiving zinc had lower %DMA in urine (-1.7 ± 0.8; P &lt; .05).
Iron and zinc status are not related to arsenic metabolism in children, and supplementation with these minerals has limited application in lowering arsenic concentrations.

In this work, we prepared glutathione (GSH)-capped copper nanoclusters (Cu NCs) with red emission by simply adjusting the pH of GSH/Cu(2+) mixture at room temperature. A photoluminescence light-up method for detecting Zn(2+) was then developed based on the aggregation induced emission enhancement of GSH-capped Cu NCs. Zn(2+) could trigger the aggregation of Cu NCs, inducing the enhancement of luminescence and the increase of absolute quantum yield from 1.3% to 6.2%. GSH-capped Cu NCs and the formed aggregates were characterized, and the possible mechanism was also discussed. The prepared GSH-capped Cu NCs exhibited a fast response towards Zn(2+) and a wider detection range from 4.68 to 2240μM. The detection limit (1.17μM) is much lower than that of the World Health Organization permitted in drinking water. Furthermore, taking advantages of the low cytotoxicity, large Stokes shift, red emission and light-up detection mode, we explored the use of the prepared GSH-capped Cu NCs in the imaging of Zn(2+) in living cells. The developed luminescence light-up nanoprobe may hold the potentials for Zn(2+)-related drinking water safety and biological applications.
Type I IFNs play crucial roles in antiviral immune responses. By inducing cellular resistance to viral infection and apoptosis of virus-infected cells, they impair virus replication and eliminate the invading pathogens. However, in CHB patients, generation of type I IFN was significantly impaired and the underlying mechanisms have not been fully understood. MicroRNA-548 family has been implicated in regulating antiviral response upon various infections. Here we explored the potential role of miR-548j in modulating type I IFN production in CHB. We found that miR-548j expression increased in MoDCs from CHB patients than that from healthy volunteers and transient transfection of miR-548j mimic led to a marked decrease of IFN-α/β production in MoDCs from healthy volunteers while blockade of miR-548j by anti-miR-548j significantly restored IFN-α/β secretion in MoDCs from CHB patients. In addition, Zinc finger and BTB domain containing 11 (ZBTB11) was predicted and finally confirmed to be a target of miR-548j. Forced expression of ZBTB11 also restored IFN-α/β secretion in MoDCs from CHB patients. These results indicate the involvement of miR-548j in aberrant production of type I IFN in CHB patients, and provide a potential target for developing anti-HBV therapies.
Considering that heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) and the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)-mediated pathway are involved in the pathophysiology of depression and that zinc has been shown to exert beneficial effects in the management of depression, this study investigated the influence of these targets on the antidepressant-like effect of zinc.
Mice were treated with sub-effective or effective doses of zinc chloride (ZnCl2, 10mg/kg, po), and 45min later, they received intracerebroventricular (icv) injections of sub-effective doses of either zinc protoporphyrin IX (ZnPP, 10μg/mouse, HO-1 inhibitor), cobalt protoporphyrin IX (CoPP, 0.01μg/mouse, HO-1 inducer) or K-252a (1μg/mouse, TrkB receptor antagonist). Immobility time and locomotor activity were evaluated through the tail suspension test (TST) and open-field test (OFT), respectively. HO-1 immunocontents were evaluated in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus 60min after ZnCl2 (10mg/kg, po) treatment.
The antidepressant-like effect of ZnCl2 was prevented by the treatment with ZnPP and K-252a. Furthermore, sub-effective doses of CoPP and ZnCl2 produced a synergistic antidepressant-like effect in the TST. None of the treatments altered locomotor activity. ZnCl2 administration increased HO-1 immunocontents only in the prefrontal cortex.
The results indicate that the antidepressant-like effect of ZnCl2 in the TST may depend on the induction of HO-1, and activation of TrkB receptor.
Environmental glucose is an important regulator of biological processes, as it can launch different cell processes depending on its concentration. Thus, low glucose concentration can induce entry into quiescence, which ensures long-term viability for the cells or in other cases mycelial growth in the dimorphic species, which, in turn, provides the cells with fresh nutrients. Several genes, such as the genes of cAMP cascade, are involved in glucose sensing and response. Since this signal transduction pathway seemed to be an evolutionarily conserved process, we assumed that its genes were also conserved and preserved their functional homology. To obtain evidence, Schizosaccharomyces pombe rsv1 and its orthologous genes were investigated using in silico and experimental approaches. Our results supported that the Rsv1 zinc-finger transcription factors of Schizosaccharomyces japonicus and Schizosaccharomyces octosporus and the Candida albicans cas5p were really functional homologues of the S. pombe Rsv1. Namely, the homologous proteins were able to restore mutant phenotype of the S. pombe rsv1-deleted cells. Bioinformatic anaysis revealed that the most conserved parts of the proteins always contained the C2H2 domains and the complementation abilities of the counterpart genes were not uniform regarding the investigated features, which can be in connection with the conserved regions outside C2H2.
Menkes disease (MD) is an X-linked recessive neurodegenerative disorder caused by mutations in ATP7A gene. Depending on the residual ATP7A activity, manifestation may be classical MD, occipital horn syndrome, or distal motor neuropathy. Neurological sparing is expected in female carriers. However, on rare occasions, females may manifest with classical clinical phenotype due to skewed X-chromosome inactivation, X-autosome translocation, and XO genotype. Here, we describe a small series of probands with MD and their response to copper histidine therapy. This series also includes a female with X-13 translocation manifesting neurological symptoms.
The clinical profile, laboratory and radiological data, and follow-up of four children with MD were collected from the hospital database and are being presented.
All the four children in our series had developmental delay, recurrent respiratory tract infections, hair and skeletal changes, axial hypotonia, tortuous vessels on imaging, low serum copper, ceruloplasmin, and elevated lactate. Fetal hypokinesia and fetal growth retardation were present in two cases. Failure to thrive was present in three children and only one child had epilepsy. Subcutaneous copper histidine was administered to all children. The average time lapse in the initiation of treatment was 20.3 months, and average duration of follow-up was 14.3 months.
We conclude that copper histidine therapy is beneficial in reversing the skin and hair changes, improving appendicular tone, socio-cognitive milestones, and improving weight gain, and immunity. Early diagnosis and management of MD are essential to have a better clinical outcome. More research is needed to explore and devise new strategies in the management of patients with MD.
Diabetes Mellitus (DM) is characterized by elevated blood glucose levels (hyperglycemia). It can occur due to impaired secretion or action of the hormone insulin, which is produced by pancreatic beta-cells to promote the entry of glucose into the cells. It is known that hyperglycemia has an important role in the production of reactive oxygen species in all types of DM and that an imbalance of transition metal as Cu and Fe plays a pivotal role in stimulating the oxidative stress. Different levels of some transition metals, as Cu, Fe, Mn, and Zn has been reported comparing diabetic animal models with the control group. An increased Cu status is also described in diabetic patients. Homeostasis of Cu depends on distinct proteins, where Cu(I)-ATPases are important transmembrane proteins for acquisition, active transport, distribution and elimination of Cu ions. In this review we first provide an overview of the literature about the relationship between diabetes and copper, the modulation of Cu(I)-ATPases activity and protein expression in DM, to next discuss the alternative treatments for diabetes using Cu chelation. © 2016 IUBMB Life, 69(4):255-262, 2017.
The essential transition metal copper is important in lipid metabolism, redox balance, iron mobilization, and many other critical processes in eukaryotic organisms. Genetic diseases where copper homeostasis is disrupted, including Menkes disease and Wilson disease, indicate the importance of copper balance to human health. The severe consequences of insufficient copper supply are illustrated by Menkes disease, caused by mutation in the X-linked ATP7A gene encoding a protein that transports copper from intestinal epithelia into the bloodstream and across the blood-brain barrier. Inadequate copper supply to the body due to poor diet quality or malabsorption can disrupt several molecular level pathways and processes. Though much of the copper distribution machinery has been described and consequences of disrupted copper handling have been characterized in human disease as well as animal models, physiological consequences of sub-optimal copper due to poor nutrition or malabsorption have not been extensively studied. Recent work indicates that insufficient copper may be important in a number of common diseases including obesity, ischemic heart disease, and metabolic syndrome. Specifically, marginal copper deficiency (CuD) has been reported as a potential etiologic factor in diseases characterized by disrupted lipid metabolism such as non-alcoholic fatty-liver disease (NAFLD). In this review, we discuss the available data suggesting that a significant portion of the North American population may consume insufficient copper, the potential mechanisms by which CuD may promote lipid biosynthesis, and the interaction between CuD and dietary fructose in the etiology of NAFLD. © 2016 IUBMB Life, 69(4):263-270, 2017.
Copper transporters ATP7A and ATP7B regulate copper levels in the human cells and deliver copper to the biosynthetic pathways. ATP7A and ATP7B belong to the P-type ATPases and share much of the domain architecture and the mechanism of ATP hydrolysis with the other, well-studied, enzymes of this type. A unique structural feature of the copper ATPases is the chain of six cytosolic metal-binding domains (MBDs), which are believed to be involved in copper-dependent regulation of the activity and intracellular localization of these enzymes. Although the structures of all the MBDs have been solved, the mechanism of copper-dependent regulation of ATP7B and ATP7A, the roles of individual MBDs, and the relationship between the regulatory and catalytic copper binding are still unknown. We describe the structure and dynamics of the MBDs, review the current knowledge about their functional roles and propose a mechanism of regulation of ATP7B by copper-dependent changes in the dynamics and conformation of the MBD chain. Transient interactions between the MBDs, rather than transitions between distinct static conformations are likely to form the structural basis of regulation of the ATP-dependent copper transporters in human cells. © 2016 IUBMB Life, 69(4):226-235, 2017.
Mosaic mutant mice displaying functional dysfunction of Atp7a copper transporter (the Menkes ATPase) are an established animal model of Menkes disease and constitute a convenient tool for investigating connections between copper and iron metabolisms. This model allows to explore changes in iron metabolism in suckling mutant mice suffering from systemic copper deficiency as well as in young and adult ones undergone copper therapy, which reduces lethal effect of the Atp7a gene mutation. Our recent study demonstrated that 14-day-old mosaic mutant males display blood cell abnormalities associated with intravascular hemolysis, and show disturbances in the functioning of the hepcidin-ferroportin regulatory axis, which controls systemic iron homeostasis. We thus aimed to check whether copper supplementation recovers mutants from hemolytic insult and rebalance systemic iron regulation. Copper supplementation of 14-day-old mosaic mutants resulted in the reestablishment of hematological status, attenuation of hepicidin and concomitant induction of the iron exporter ferroportin/Slc40a1 expression in the liver, down-regulated in untreated mutants. Interestingly, treatment of wild-type males with copper, induced hepcidin-independent up-regulation of ferroportin protein level in hepatic macrophages in both young and adult (6-month-old) animals. Stimulatory effect of copper on ferroportin mRNA and protein levels was confirmed in bone marrow-derived macrophages isolated from both wild-type and mosaic mutant males. Our study indicates that copper is an important player in the regulation of the Slc40a1 gene expression.
ATP7A and ATP7B are Cu(+) -transporting ATPases of subclass IB and play a fundamental role in intracellular copper homeostasis. ATP7A/B transfer Cu(+) ions across the membrane from delivery to acceptor proteins without establishing a free Cu(+) gradient. Transfer of copper across the membrane is coupled to ATP hydrolysis. Current measurements on solid supported membranes (SSM) were performed to investigate the mechanism of copper-related charge transfer across ATP7A and ATP7B. SSM measurements demonstrated that electrogenic copper displacement occurs within ATP7A/B following addition of ATP and formation of the phosphorylated intermediate. Comparison of the time constants for cation displacement in ATP7A/B and sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) -ATPase is consistent with the slower phosphoenzyme formation in copper ATPases. Moreover, ATP-dependent copper transfer in ATP7A/B is not affected by varying the pH, suggesting that net proton counter-transport may not occur in copper ATPases. Platinum anticancer drugs activate ATP7A/B and are subjected to ATP-dependent vectorial displacement with a mechanism analogous to that of copper. © 2016 IUBMB Life, 69(4):218-225, 2017.
Copper is an essential biometal, and several inherited diseases are directly associated with a disruption to normal copper homeostasis. The best characterized are the copper deficiency and toxicity disorders Menkes and Wilson diseases caused by mutations in the p-type Cu-ATPase genes ATP7A and ATP7B, respectively. Missense mutations in the C-terminal portion of ATP7A have also been shown to cause distal motor neuropathy, whereas polymorphisms in ATP7B are associated with increased risk of Alzheimer's disease. We have generated a single, in vivo model for studying multiple pathogenic mutations in ATP7 proteins using Drosophila melanogaster, which has a single orthologue of ATP7A and ATP7B. Four pathogenic ATP7A mutations and two ATP7B mutations were introduced into a genomic ATP7 rescue construct containing an in-frame C-terminal GFP tag. Analysis of the wild type ATP7-GFP transgene confirmed that ATP7 is expressed at the basolateral membrane of larval midgut copper cells and that the transgene can rescue a normally early lethal ATP7 deletion allele to adulthood. Analysis of the gATP7-GFP transgenes containing pathogenic mutations showed that the function of ATP7 was affected, to varying degrees, by all six of the mutations investigated in this study. Of particular interest, the ATP7B(K832R) Alzheimer's disease susceptibility allele was found, for the first time, to be a loss of function allele. This in vivo system allows us to assess the severity of individual ATP7A/B mutations in an invariant genetic background and has the potential to be used to screen for therapeutic compounds able to restore function to faulty copper transport proteins.
The essential role of copper in eukaryotic cellular physiology is known, but has not been recognized as important in the context of influenza A virus infection. In this study, we investigated the effect of cellular copper on influenza A virus replication.
Influenza A/WSN/33 (H1N1) virus growth and macromolecule syntheses were assessed in cultured human lung cells (A549) where the copper concentration of the growth medium was modified, or expression of host genes involved in copper homeostasis was targeted by RNA interference.
Exogenously increasing copper concentration, or chelating copper, resulted in moderate defects in viral growth. Nucleoprotein (NP) localization, neuraminidase activity assays and transmission electron microscopy did not reveal significant defects in virion assembly, morphology or release under these conditions. However, RNAi knockdown of the high-affinity copper importer CTR1 resulted in significant viral growth defects (7.3-fold reduced titer at 24 hours post-infection, p = 0.04). Knockdown of CTR1 or the trans-Golgi copper transporter ATP7A significantly reduced polymerase activity in a minigenome assay. Both copper transporters were required for authentic viral RNA synthesis and NP and matrix (M1) protein accumulation in the infected cell.
These results demonstrate that intracellular copper regulates the influenza virus life cycle, with potentially distinct mechanisms in specific cellular compartments. These observations provide a new avenue for drug development and studies of influenza virus pathogenesis.
Copper metabolism disturbances in mammary gland (MG) cells have severe consequences in newborns. The mechanism that controls the balance of copper in the MG has not been thoroughly characterized. Four primary copper homeostasis genes in mammals: (1) ceruloplasmin (Cp) encoding multifunction multicopper blue (ferr)oxidase; (2) CTR1 encoding high affinity copper importer 1; and (3 and 4) two similar genes encoding Cu(I)/Cu(II)-ATPases P1 type (ATP7A and ATP7B) responsible for copper efflux from the cells and metallation of cuproenzymes formed in the Golgi complex are expressed in MG. This study aimed to characterize expression of these genes during pregnancy, lactation and forced involution in the rat MG. We found that Cp anchored to the plasma membrane and ATP7A were expressed during pregnancy and lactation. Soluble Cp and ATP7B were highly expressed in lactating MG decreasing to its ending. CTR1 activity increased during MG growth and reached its maximum at postpartum and then it decreased until the end of lactation. During early forced MG involution, Cp gene expression persisted; while a form of Cp that lacked exon 18 appeared. We suggest that Cp gene expressional changes at the transcriptional and posttranscriptional level reflect various physiological functions of Cp proteins during MG remodeling.
Copper-associated hepatitis is recognized with increasing frequency in dogs. The disease is characterized by centrolobular hepatic copper accumulation, leading to hepatitis and eventually cirrhosis. The only way to establish the diagnosis is by histologic assessment of copper distribution and copper quantification in a liver biopsy. Treatment with the copper chelator d-penicillamine is the most commonly used treatment. In addition, a low-copper/high-zinc diet can help prevent accumulation or reaccumulation of hepatic copper. Mutations in the copper metabolism genes COMMD1 or ATP7A and ATP7B have been associated with hepatic copper concentrations in Bedlington terriers and Labrador retrievers respectively. In the Labrador retriever, dietary copper intake contributes strongly to the disease phenotype.
Copper transporter 1 (CTR1), copper transporter 2 (CTR2), copper-transporting p-type adenosine triphosphatase 1 and 2 (ATP7A and ATP7B) are key mediators of cellular cisplatin, carboplatin and oxaliplatin accumulation. In this meta-analysis, we aimed to evaluate the relation of CTR1, CTR2, ATP7A and ATP7B to overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), disease-free survival (DFS) and treatment response (TR) of cancer patients who received chemotherapy based on published literatures, the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) datasets. Hazard ratios (HRs) and odds ratios (ORs) were pooled using random-effect models. Subgroup analysis and sensitivity analysis were conducted; heterogeneity and publication bias were assessed. Twelve literatures and eight datasets with 2149 patients were included. Our results suggested that high CTR1 expression was associated with favorable OS, PFS, DFS and TR in cancer patients who underwent chemotherapy with acceptable heterogeneity. The relationship of CTR1 to cancer prognosis remained significant in the subgroup of patients who underwent platinum-based chemotherapy, the patients with ovarian cancer and those with lung cancer. The significance of these relationships was not influenced by geological region of publication, data origin or detection method. However, there was no evidence for relation of CTR2, ATP7A or ATP7B to OS, PFS, DFS or TR. Test of publication bias and sensitivity analysis suggested a robustness of all the summary effect estimates. In conclusion, high CTR1 level predicts prolonged survival and enhanced response to chemotherapy in cancer patients who underwent chemotherapy and CTR1 might be a potential target to circumvent chemotherapy resistance.
Copper has a wide and important role in biological systems, determining conformation and activity of many metalloproteins and enzymes, such as cytochrome oxidase and superoxide dismutase . Furthermore, due to its possible reactivity with nonspecific proteins and toxic effects, elaborate systems of absorption, concentration buffering, delivery to specific protein sites and elimination, require a complex system including small carriers, chaperones and active transporters. The P-type copper ATPases ATP7A and ATP7B provide an important system for acquisition, active transport, distribution and elimination of copper. Relevance of copper metabolism to human diseases and therapy is already known. It is quite certain that further studies will reveal detailed and useful information on biochemical mechanisms and relevance to diseases. © 2016 IUBMB Life, 69(4):211-217, 2017.
Copper plays key catalytic and regulatory roles in biochemical processes essential for normal growth, development, and health. Defects in copper metabolism cause Menkes and Wilson's disease, myeloneuropathy, and cardiovascular disease and are associated with other pathophysiological states. Consequently, it is critical to understand the mechanisms by which organisms control the acquisition, distribution, and utilization of copper. The intestinal enterocyte is a key regulatory point for copper absorption into the body; however, the mechanisms by which intestinal cells transport copper to maintain organismal copper homeostasis are poorly understood. Here, we identify a mechanism by which organismal copper homeostasis is maintained by intestinal copper exporter trafficking that is coordinated with extraintestinal copper levels in Caenorhabditis elegans Specifically, we show that CUA-1, the C. elegans homolog of ATP7A/B, localizes to lysosome-like organelles (gut granules) in the intestine under copper overload conditions for copper detoxification, whereas copper deficiency results in a redistribution of CUA-1 to basolateral membranes for copper efflux to peripheral tissues. Worms defective in gut granule biogenesis exhibit defects in copper sequestration and increased susceptibility to toxic copper levels. Interestingly, however, a splice isoform CUA-1.2 that lacks a portion of the N-terminal domain is targeted constitutively to the basolateral membrane irrespective of dietary copper concentration. Our studies establish that CUA-1 is a key intestinal copper exporter and that its trafficking is regulated to maintain systemic copper homeostasis. C. elegans could therefore be exploited as a whole-animal model system to study regulation of intra- and intercellular copper trafficking pathways.
Menkes disease is an X-linked multisystem disorder with epilepsy, kinky hair, and neurodegeneration caused by mutations in the copper transporter ATP7A. Other ATP7A mutations have been linked to juvenile occipital horn syndrome and adult-onset hereditary motor neuropathy.(1,2) About 5%-10% of the patients present with "atypical Menkes disease" characterized by longer survival, cerebellar ataxia, and developmental delay.(2) The intracellular copper transport is regulated by 2 P type ATPase copper transporters ATP7A and ATP7B. These proteins are expressed in the trans-Golgi network that guides copper to intracellular compartments, and in copper excess, it relocates copper to the plasma membrane to pump it out from the cells.(3)ATP7B mutations cause Wilson disease with dystonia, ataxia, tremor, and abnormal copper accumulation in the brain, liver, and other organs.(4).
Purpose: Platinum derivatives, such as cisplatin (DDP), carboplatin and oxaliplatin, are widely used components of modern cancer chemotherapy including esophageal squamous cell cancer (ESCC). However, their roles are limited by the impact of intrinsic/acquired resistance mechanisms on tumor responses. Recent studies have shown that the mammalian copper transporters CTR1, ATP7A and ATP7B are involved in cisplatin-resistance to some cancers. Methods: The cytotoxicities of DDP in different cell lines were determined using the MTT assay. To determine whether knockdown the expression of ATP7A could reverse the platinum-resistance of EC109/DDP cells or not, we used RNA interference system to explore the role of ATP7A in platinum resistance. Results: We found that DDP-resistant cell sublines EC109/DDP (8.490 folds) showed cross-resistance to carboplatin (5.27 folds) and oxaliplatin (4.12 folds). ATP7A expressions in DDP-resistant cell sublines (EC109/DDP) were much higher than DDP-sensitive cell lines (EC109) at both mRNA and protein levels. ATP7A targeted small interfering RNA duplex at 100nM final concentration added into DDP-resistant cancer cells (EC109/DDP) markedly inhibited the expression of ATP7A as determined by Western blot (83.0%) and partially reversed DDP-resistance (37.09%), moreover, it also increased cell apoptosis at different DDP concentrations. Conclusions: These findings indicate that ATP7A high expression plays an important role in platinum-resistance of ESCC. This study sheds light on platinum resistance in ESCC patients and may have implications for therapeutic reversal of drug resistance.
Cisplatin is an effective breast cancer drug but resistance often develops over prolonged chemotherapy. Therefore, we performed a candidate approach RNAi screen in combination with cisplatin treatment to identify molecular pathways conferring survival advantages. The screen identified ATP7A as a therapeutic target. ATP7A is a copper ATPase transporter responsible for intercellular movement and sequestering of cisplatin. Pharmaceutical replacement for ATP7A by ammonium tetrathiomolybdate (TM) enhanced cisplatin treatment in breast cancer cells. Allograft and xenograft models in athymic nude mice treated with cisplatin/TM exhibited retarded tumor growth, reduced accumulation of cancer stem cells and decreased cell proliferation as compared to mono-treatment with cisplatin or TM. Cisplatin/TM treatment of cisplatin-resistant tumors reduced ATP7A protein levels, attenuated cisplatin sequestering by ATP7A, increased nuclear availability of cisplatin, and subsequently enhanced DNA damage and apoptosis. Microarray analysis of gene ontology pathways that responded uniquely to cisplatin/TM double treatment depicted changes in cell cycle regulation, specifically in the G1/S transition. These findings offer the potential to combat platinum-resistant tumors and sensitize patients to conventional breast cancer treatment by identifying and targeting the resistant tumors' unique molecular adaptations.
Intestinal iron absorption is highly regulated since no mechanism for iron excretion exists. We previously demonstrated that expression of an intestinal copper transporter (Atp7a) increases in parallel with genes encoding iron transporters in the rat duodenal epithelium during iron deprivation (Am. J. Physiol.: Gastrointest. Liver Physiol., 2005, 288, G964-G971). This led us to postulate that Atp7a may influence intestinal iron flux. Therefore, to test the hypothesis that Atp7a is required for optimal iron transport, we silenced Atp7a in rat IEC-6 and human Caco-2 cells. Iron transport was subsequently quantified in fully-differentiated cells plated on collagen-coated, transwell inserts. Interestingly, (59)Fe uptake and efflux were impaired in both cell lines by Atp7a silencing. Concurrent changes in the expression of key iron transport-related genes were also noted in IEC-6 cells. Expression of Dmt1 (the iron importer), Dcytb (an apical membrane ferrireductase) and Fpn1 (the iron exporter) was decreased in Atp7a knockdown (KD) cells. Paradoxically, cell-surface ferrireductase activity increased (&gt;5-fold) in Atp7a KD cells despite decreased Dcytb mRNA expression. Moreover, increased expression (&gt;10-fold) of hephaestin (an iron oxidase involved in iron efflux) was associated with increased ferroxidase activity in KD cells. Increases in ferrireductase and ferroxidase activity may be compensatory responses to increase iron flux. In summary, in these reductionist models of the mammalian intestinal epithelium, Atp7a KD altered expression of iron transporters and impaired iron flux. Since Atp7a is a copper transporter, it is a logical supposition that perturbations in intracellular copper homeostasis underlie the noted biologic changes in these cell lines.
Octylphenol (OP) and bisphenol A (BPA) are known as endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs). During pregnancy, the expression of steroid hormone receptors is controlled by maternal and fetal nutrition. To evaluate the impact of EDCs during pregnancy, ethinyl estradiol (EE, 0.2 mg/kg/day), OP (50 mg/kg/day), and BPA (50 mg/kg/day) were administered to pregnant mice. The mRNA levels of TRPV6 (transient receptor potential cation channels in subfamily V, member 6) decreased significantly by EE and OP. The PMCA1 (ATPase, Ca(++) transporting, plasma membrane 1) mRNA and protein levels decreased significantly by EE, OP, and BPA. CTR1 (solute carrier family 31, member 1) and ATP7A (ATPase, Cu(++) transporting, alpha polypeptide) expression decreased significantly by EE, OP, and BPA. The mRNA levels of IREG1 (iron-regulated transporter, member 1) decreased significantly by EE. Hephaestin (HEPH) mRNA levels decreased significantly by EE, OP, and BPA, and protein levels decreased significantly by BPA. As a result of immunohistochemistry analysis, all cation transporter proteins were found in labyrinth of placenta. To confirm the cytosolic level of cations, levels of cation level in fetal serum were measured. EE, OP, and BPA significantly reduced serum calcium and copper levels, and iron levels were reduced by BPA. Taken together, some EDCs, such as OP and BPA, could modulate the calcium, copper, and iron ion-transporting channels during pregnancy. The fetus relies on the mother for ionic transportation, and, therefore, pregnant women should avoid exposure to cation-channel-disrupting chemicals.
Menkes disease (MD) is a disorder of copper metabolism due to ATP7A gene mutation that leads to severe copper deficiency. Deformed blood vessels can be found in many parts of the body, and intracranial hematoma is generally reported.
We report a Taiwanese boy with MD who had recurrent spontaneous subserosal hematoma of ileum presenting as intestinal obstruction, with the 2 episodes 23 months apart. The patient returned to the usual physical status after surgical removal of the hematoma.
The defective copper metabolism causes dysfunction of a plenty of copper-dependent enzymes, giving rise to unique kinky hair appearance, progressive neurodegeneration, and connective tissue abnormalities. To our knowledge, this is the first report on recurrent subserosal hemorrhage of intestine in MD.
Owing to the fragile structure of blood vessels, subserosal hematoma should be considered when patients with MD having intestinal obstruction.
Copper (Cu) is an indispensable metal for normal development and function of humans, especially in central nervous system (CNS). However, its redox activity requires accurate Cu transport system. ATP7A, a main Cu(2+) transporting-ATPase, is necessary to efflux Cu across the plasma membrane and synthesize cuproenzymes. Menkes disease (MD) is caused by mutations in ATP7A gene. Clinically, MD is Cu deficiency syndrome and is treated with Cu-histidine injections soon after definite diagnosis. But outcome of the most remains poor. To estimate the standard therapy, Cu distribution in the treated classic MD patients is analyzed by synchrotron-generated X-ray fluorescence technique (SR-XRF), which identifies and quantifies an individual atom up to at subcellular level of resolution with wide detection area. SR-XRF analysis newly reveals that Cu exists in spinal cord parenchyma and flows out via venous and lymph systems. By systemic analysis, excess Cu is detected in the proximal tubular cells of the kidney, the mucosal epithelial cells of the intestine, and the lymph and venous systems. The current study suggests that the standard therapy supply almost enough Cu for patient tissues. But given Cu passes through the tissues to venous and lymph systems, or accumulate in the cells responsible for Cu absorption.
Menkes disease, occipital horn syndrome (OHS), and ATP7A-related distal motor neuropathy (DMN) are disorders of copper transport caused by pathogenic variants in ATP7A (encoding a copper-transporting ATPase). Infants with classic Menkes disease appear healthy until age two to three months, when loss of developmental milestones, hypotonia, seizures, and failure to thrive occur. The diagnosis is usually suspected when infants exhibit typical neurologic changes and concomitant characteristic changes of the hair (short, sparse, coarse, twisted, and often lightly pigmented). Temperature instability and hypoglycemia may be present in the neonatal period. Death usually occurs by age three years. OHS is characterized by “occipital horns,” distinctive wedge-shaped calcifications at the sites of attachment of the trapezius muscle and the sternocleidomastoid muscle to the occipital bone. Occipital horns may be clinically palpable or observed on skull radiographs. Individuals with OHS also have lax skin and joints, bladder diverticula, inguinal hernias, and vascular tortuosity. Intellect is normal or slightly reduced. ATP7A-related DMN, an adult-onset disorder resembling Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, shares none of the clinical or biochemical abnormalities characteristic of Menkes disease or OHS.
Menkes disease and OHS are characterized by low concentrations of copper in some tissues as a result of impaired intestinal copper absorption, accumulation of copper in other tissues, and reduced activity of copper-dependent enzymes such as dopamine beta hydroxylase (DBH) and lysyl oxidase. While serum copper concentration and serum ceruloplasmin concentration are low in Menkes disease and OHS, they are normal in ATP7A-related DMN. The diagnosis of ATP7A-related copper transport disorders is most commonly established in a proband by detection of either a hemizygous ATP7A pathogenic variant in a male or a heterozygous ATP7A pathogenic variant in a female.
Treatment of manifestations: Classic Menkes disease: gastrostomy tube placement to manage caloric intake; surgery for bladder diverticula. Prevention of primary manifestations: Subcutaneous injections of copper histidine or copper chloride before age ten days normalizes developmental outcome in some children and improves the neurologic outcome in others. Prevention of secondary complications: Antibiotic prophylaxis may prevent bladder infection.
The ATP7A-related copper transport disorders are inherited in an X-linked manner. Approximately one third of affected males have no family history of Menkes disease/OHS/DMN. If the mother is a heterozygote, the risk of transmitting the ATP7A pathogenic variant is 50% in each pregnancy: a male who inherits the pathogenic variant will be affected with the disorder present in his brother; females who inherit the pathogenic variant will be heterozygotes and will not be affected. Males with OHS or ATP7A-related DMN will pass the pathogenic variant to all of their daughters and none of their sons. Individuals with classic Menkes disease do not reproduce. When the pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected family member, heterozygote testing for at-risk female relatives, prenatal testing for pregnancies at increased risk, and preimplantation genetic diagnosis are possible. Prenatal testing for Menkes disease is technically possible by copper transport studies in cultured chorionic villus cells or amniocytes, although its availability is limited.
The present study was conducted to explore the effects of waterborne Cu exposure on intestinal Cu transport and lipid metabolism of Synechogobius hasta. S. hasta were exposed to 0, 0.4721 and 0.9442μM Cu, respectively. Sampling occurred on days 0, 21 and 42, respectively. Growth performance, intestinal lipid deposition, Cu content, and activities and mRNA expression of enzymes and genes involved in Cu transport and lipid metabolism were analyzed. Cu exposure decreased WG and SGR on days 21 and 42. Cu exposure increased intestinal Cu and lipid contents. Increased Cu accumulation was attributable to increased enzymatic activities (Cu-ATPase and Cu, Zn-SOD) and genes' (CTR1, CTR2, DMT1, ATP7a, ATP7b, MT1 and MT2) expression involved in Cu transport. Waterborne Cu exposure also increased activities of lipogenic enzymes (6PGD and ICDH on both days 21 and 42, ME on day 42), up-regulated mRNA levels of lipogenic genes (G6PD, 6PGD, ME, ICDH, FAS and ACCa), lipolytic genes (ACCb, CPT I and HSLa) and genes involved in intestinal fatty acid uptake (IFABP and FATP4) on both days 21 and 42. The up-regulation of lipolysis may result from the increased metabolic expenditure for detoxification and maintenance of the normal body functions in a response to Cu exposure. Meantime, Cu exposure increased lipogenesis and fatty acid uptake, leading to net lipid accumulation in the intestine despite increased lipolysis. To our knowledge, this is the first report involved in intestinal lipid metabolism in combination with intestinal Cu absorption following waterborne Cu exposure, which provides new insights and evidence into Cu toxicity in fish.
Copper is one of essential trace elements. Copper deficiency lead to growth and developmental failure and/or neurological dysfunction. However, excess copper is also problems for human life. There are two disorders of inborn error of copper metabolism, Menkes disease and Wilson disease. Menkes disease is an X linked recessive disorder with copper deficiency and Wilson disease is an autosomal recessive disorder with copper accumulation. These both disorders result from the defective functioning of copper transport P-type ATPase, ATP7A of Menkes disease and ATP7B of Wilson disease. In this paper, the author describes about copper metabolism of human, and clinical feature, diagnosis and treatment of Menkes disease and Wilson disease.
The ATP7A protein is a ubiquitous copper-transporting P-type ATPase that is mutated in the lethal pediatric disorder of copper metabolism, Menkes disease. The steady-state location of ATP7A is within the trans-Golgi network (TGN), where it delivers copper to copper-dependent enzymes within the secretory pathway. However, ATP7A constantly cycles between the TGN and the plasma membrane, and in the presence of high copper concentrations, the exocytic arm of this cycling pathway is enhanced to promote a steady-state distribution of ATP7A to post-Golgi vesicles and the plasma membrane. A single di-leucine endocytic motif within the cytosolic carboxy tail of ATP7A (1487LL) was previously shown to be essential for TGN localization by functioning in retrieval from the plasma membrane, however, the requirement of other di-leucine signals in this region has not been fully investigated. While there has been some success in identifying sequence elements within ATP7A required for trafficking and catalysis, progress has been hampered by the instability of the ATP7A cDNA in high-copy plasmids during replication in Escherichia coli. In this study, we find that the use of DNA synthesis to generate silent mutations across the majority of both mouse and human ATP7A open reading frames was sufficient to stabilize these genes in high-copy plasmids, thus permitting the generation of full-length expression constructs. Using the stabilized mouse Atp7a construct, we identify a second di-leucine motif in the carboxy tail of ATP7A (1459LL) as essential for steady-state localization in the TGN by functioning in endosome-to-TGN trafficking. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that multiple di-leucine signals are required for recycling ATP7A from the plasma membrane to the TGN and illustrate the utility of large-scale codon reassignment as a simple and effective approach to circumvent cDNA instability in high-copy plasmids.
ATP7A is a P-type ATPase essential for cellular copper (Cu) transport and homeostasis. Loss-of-function ATP7A mutations causing systemic Cu deficiency are associated with severe Menkes disease or its milder allelic variant, occipital horn syndrome. We previously identified two rare ATP7A missense mutations (P1386S and T994I) leading to a non-fatal form of motor neuron disorder, X-linked distal hereditary motor neuropathy (dHMNX), without overt signs of systemic Cu deficiency. Recent investigations using a tissue specific Atp7a knock out model have demonstrated that Cu plays an essential role in motor neuron maintenance and function, however the underlying pathogenic mechanisms of ATP7A mutations causing axonal degeneration remain unknown. We have generated an Atp7a conditional knock in mouse model of dHMNX expressing Atp7a(T985I), the orthologue of the human ATP7A(T994I) identified in dHMNX patients. Although a degenerative motor phenotype is not observed, the knock in Atp7a(T985I/Y) mice show altered Cu levels within the peripheral and central nervous systems, an increased diameter of the muscle fibres and altered myogenin and myostatin gene expression. Atp7a(T985I/Y) mice have reduced Atp7a protein levels and recapitulate the defective trafficking and altered post-translational regulatory mechanisms observed in the human ATP7A(T994I) patient fibroblasts. Our model provides a unique opportunity to characterise the molecular phenotype of dHMNX and the time course of cellular events leading to the process of axonal degeneration in this disease.
Cuproproteins such as PHM and DBM mature in late endosomal vesicles of the mammalian secretory pathway where changes in vesicle pH are employed for sorting and post-translational processing. Colocation with the P1B-type ATPase ATP7A suggests that the latter is the source of copper and supports a mechanism where selectivity in metal transfer is achieved by spatial colocation of partner proteins in their specific organelles or vesicles. In previous work we have suggested that a lumenal loop sequence located between trans-membrane helices TM1 and TM2 of the ATPase, and containing five histidines and four methionines, acts as an organelle-specific chaperone for metallation of the cuproproteins. The hypothesis posits that the pH of the vesicle regulates copper ligation and loop conformation via a mechanism which involves His to Met ligand switching induced by histidine protonation. Here we report the effect of pH on the HM loop copper coordination using X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), and show via selenium substitution of the Met residues that the HM loop undergoes similar conformational switching to that found earlier for its partner PHM. We hypothesize that in the absence of specific chaperones, HM motifs provide a template for building a flexible, pH-sensitive transfer site whose structure and function can be regulated to accommodate the different active site structural elements and pH environments of its partner proteins.
Copper-transporting ATPase ATP7A is essential for mammalian copper homeostasis. Loss of ATP7A activity is associated with fatal Menkes disease and various other pathologies. In cells, ATP7A inactivation disrupts copper transport from the cytosol into the secretory pathway. Using fibroblasts from Menkes disease patients and mouse 3T3-L1 cells with a CRISPR/Cas9-inactivated ATP7A, we demonstrate that ATP7A dysfunction is also damaging to mitochondrial redox balance. In these cells, copper accumulates in nuclei, cytosol, and mitochondria, causing distinct changes in their redox environment. Quantitative imaging of live cells using GRX1-roGFP2 and HyPer sensors reveals highest glutathione oxidation and elevation of H2O2 in mitochondria, whereas the redox environment of nuclei and the cytosol is much less affected. Decreasing the H2O2 levels in mitochondria with MitoQ does not prevent glutathione oxidation; i.e. elevated copper and not H2O2 is a primary cause of glutathione oxidation. Redox misbalance does not significantly affect mitochondrion morphology or the activity of respiratory complex IV but markedly increases cell sensitivity to even mild glutathione depletion, resulting in loss of cell viability. Thus, ATP7A activity protects mitochondria from excessive copper entry, which is deleterious to redox buffers. Mitochondrial redox misbalance could significantly contribute to pathologies associated with ATP7A inactivation in tissues with paradoxical accumulation of copper (i.e. renal epithelia).
The expression levels of the copper transporter P-type adenosine triphosphatase (ATP7B) are known correlate with tumor cell sensitivity to cisplatin. However, the mechanisms underlying cisplatin resistance remained poorly understood. Therefore, in the present study, we treated Hep-2 cells and in-house-developed vincristine-resistant Hep-2v cells with 50, 100, or 200 µM cisplatin and assessed cell viability after 24 or 48 h. Hep-2v cells were shown to be resistant to 50-200 µM cisplatin. Furthermore, using immunofluorescence staining and western blot analysis, we noted that ATP7B, but not copper-transporting ATPase 1 (ATP7A), expression was significantly increased in Hep-2v cells, and this increase was maintained at a higher level compared with Hep-2 cells. As ATP7B is a target of microRNA 133a (miR‑133a), the ability of miR‑133a to influence cisplatin sensitivity in Hep-2v cells was then assessed by CCK-8 assay. We noted that miR‑133a expression was lower in both Hep-2 and Hep-2v cells compared with epithelial NP69 cells. Following treatment with 50 µM cisplatin, in Hep-2v cells expressing exogenous miR‑133a we noted reduced ATP7B expression, and these cells had a significantly lower survival rate compared with the control. The present study demonstrates that miR‑133a enhances the sensitivity of multidrug-resistant Hep-2v cells to cisplatin by downregulating ATP7B expression.
We have recently reported that vatalanib, an orally active small molecule multi-tyrosine kinase inhibitor (Hess-Stumpp et al., 2005 [1]), can sensitize multidrug resistant (MDR) colon cancer cells to chemotherapy under hypoxia by inhibiting two MDR transporters ABCB1 and ABCG2 (To et al., 2015 [2]). This data article describes the possible circumvention of resistance to specifically platinum (Pt)-based anticancer drugs by vatalanib via inhibition of two other efflux transporters ABCC2 and ATP7A. Data from the flow cytometric transporter efflux assay showed specific inhibition of ABCC2 activity by vatalanib in stable transfected cells and ABCC2-overexpressing oxaliplatin-resistant colon cancer cells HCT116/Oxa. We also performed the transporter ABCC2 ATPase assay and showed an increase in ATP hydrolysis by ABCC2 in the presence of vatalanib. ATP7A mRNA expression was also shown to be upregulated in HCT116/Oxa cells. Vatalanib was shown to suppress this upregulated ATP7A expression. Data from the cellular Pt accumulation assay showed a lower Pt accumulation in HCT116/Oxa cells than the parental sensitive HCT116 cells. Vatalanib was shown to increase cellular Pt accumulation in a concentration-dependent manner. Combination of oxaliplatin and vatalanib was shown to restore the suppressed apoptosis in HCT116/Oxa cells.
Hypomyelination in developing brain is often accompanied by congenital metabolic disorders. Menkes kinky hair disease is an X-linked neurodegenerative disease of impaired copper transport, resulting from a mutation of the Menkes disease gene, a transmembrane copper-transporting p-type ATPase gene (ATP7A). In a macular mutant mouse model, the murine ortholog of Menkes gene (mottled gene) is mutated, and widespread neurodegeneration and subsequent death are observed. Although some biochemical analysis of myelin protein in macular mouse has been reported, detailed histological study of myelination in this mouse model is currently lacking. Since myelin abnormality is one of the neuropathologic findings of human Menkes disease, in this study early myelination in macular mouse brain was evaluated by immunohistochemistry. Two-week-old macular mice and normal littermates were perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde. Immunohistochemical staining of paraffin embedded and vibratome sections was performed using antibodies against either CNPase, cleaved caspase-3 or O4 (marker of immature oligodendrocytes). This staining showed that cerebral myelination in macular mouse was generally hypoplastic and that hypomyelination was remarkable in internal capsule, corpus callosum, and cingulate cortex. In addition, an increased number of cleaved caspase-3 positive cells were observed in corpus callosum and internal capsule. Copper deficiency induced by low copper diet has been reported to induce oligodendrocyte dysfunction and leads to hypomyelination in this mouse model. Taken together, hypomyelination observed in this study in a mouse model of Menkes disease is assumed to be induced by increased apoptosis of immature oligodendrocytes in developing cerebrum, through deficient intracellular copper metabolism.
The discovery of small molecules that selectively inhibit Mnks is considered of paramount importance towards deciphering the exact role of these proteins in carcinogenesis and to further validate them as anti-cancer drug targets. However, the dearth of structural information of Mnks is a major hurdle. This study unveils the 7H-pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidine derivatives as potent inhibitors of Mnks. ATP and substrate competition assays showed that this scaffold interacts with the ATP binding site, but not with the substrate site. Screened against a panel of cancer cells, Mnk inhibitors were most potent against MV4-11 acute myeloid leukemia cells. The induction of apoptosis was shown to be mediated by downregulation of Mcl-1.
Brain development requires a fine-tuned copper homoeostasis. Copper deficiency or excess results in severe neuro-pathologies. We demonstrate that upon neuronal differentiation, cellular demand for copper increases, especially within the secretory pathway. Copper flow to this compartment is facilitated through transcriptional and metabolic regulation. Quantitative real-time imaging revealed a gradual change in the oxidation state of cytosolic glutathione upon neuronal differentiation. Transition from a broad range of redox states to a uniformly reducing cytosol facilitates reduction of the copper chaperone Atox1, liberating its metal-binding site. Concomitantly, expression of Atox1 and its partner, a copper transporter ATP7A, is upregulated. These events produce a higher flux of copper through the secretory pathway that balances copper in the cytosol and increases supply of the cofactor to copper-dependent enzymes, expression of which is elevated in differentiated neurons. Direct link between glutathione oxidation and copper compartmentalization allows for rapid metabolic adjustments essential for normal neuronal function.
Senescence, defined as irreversible cell-cycle arrest, is the main driving force of aging and age-related diseases. Here, we performed high-throughput screening to identify compounds that alleviate senescence and identified the ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) inhibitor KU-60019 as an effective agent. To elucidate the mechanism underlying ATM's role in senescence, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screen and found that ATM interacted with the vacuolar ATPase V1 subunits ATP6V1E1 and ATP6V1G1. Specifically, ATM decreased E-G dimerization through direct phosphorylation of ATP6V1G1. Attenuation of ATM activity restored the dimerization, thus consequently facilitating assembly of the V1 and V0 domains with concomitant reacidification of the lysosome. In turn, this reacidification induced the functional recovery of the lysosome/autophagy system and was coupled with mitochondrial functional recovery and metabolic reprogramming. Together, our data reveal a new mechanism through which senescence is controlled by the lysosomal-mitochondrial axis, whose function is modulated by the fine-tuning of ATM activity.
Deletion of a single phenylalanine residue at position 508 of the protein CFTR (cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator), a chloride channel in lung epithelium, is the most common cause for cystic fibrosis. As a consequence, folding of the CFTRΔF508 protein and delivery to the cell surface are compromised, resulting in degradation of the polypeptide. Accordingly, decreased surface presence of CFTRΔF508 causes impaired chloride ion conductivity and is associated with mucus accumulation, a hallmark of cystic fibrosis. Molecular chaperones such as Hsp90 and its co-chaperone partner Aha1 are thought to play a key role in targeting folding-deficient CFTRΔF508 for degradation. Thus, pharmacologic manipulation to inhibit Hsp90-Aha1 chaperone complex formation appears beneficial to inhibit proteolysis of CFTRΔF508 and rescue its residual chloride channel activity. Therefore, we have screened a collection of 14,400 druglike chemical compounds for inhibitors of the Hsp90-Aha1 complex by amplified luminescence proximity homogeneous assay (Alpha). We identified two druglike molecules that showed promising results when we tested their ability to restore chloride channel activity in culture cells expressing the mutant CFTRΔF508 protein. The two molecules were most effective in combination with the corrector VX-809 and may therefore serve as a lead compound that can be further developed into a drug to treat cystic fibrosis patients.
Rotary enzymes are complex, highly challenging biomolecular machines whose biochemical working mechanism involves intersubunit rotation. The true intrinsic rate of rotation of any rotary enzyme is not known in a native, unmodified state. Here we use the effect of an oscillating electric (AC) field on the biochemical activity of a rotary enzyme, the vacuolar proton-ATPase (V-ATPase), to directly measure its mean rate of rotation in its native membrane environment, without any genetic, chemical or mechanical modification of the enzyme, for the first time. The results suggest that a transmembrane AC field is able to synchronise the steps of ion-pumping in individual enzymes via a hold-and-release mechanism, which opens up the possibility of biotechnological exploitation. Our approach is likely to work for other transmembrane ion-transporting assemblies, not only rotary enzymes, to determine intrinsic in situ rates of ion pumping.
Recent studies demonstrated that in addition to Na(+),K(+)-ATPase inhibition cardiotonic steroids (CTSs) affect diverse intracellular signaling pathways. This study examines the relative impact of [Na(+)]i/[K(+)]i-mediated and -independent signaling in transcriptomic changes triggered by the endogenous CTSs ouabain and marinobufagenin (MBG) in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC). We noted that prolongation of incubation increased the apparent affinity for ouabain estimated by the loss of [K(+)]i and gain of [Na(+)]i. Six hour exposure of HUVEC to 100 and 3,000 nM ouabain resulted in elevation of the [Na(+)]i/[K(+)]i ratio by ~15 and 80-fold and differential expression of 258 and 2185 transcripts, respectively. Neither [Na(+)]i/[K(+)]i ratio nor transcriptome were affected by 6-h incubation with 30 nM ouabain. The 96-h incubation with 3 nM ouabain or 30 nM MBG elevated the [Na(+)]i/[K(+)]i ratio by ~14 and 3-fold and led to differential expression of 880 and 484 transcripts, respectively. These parameters were not changed after 96-h incubation with 1 nM ouabain or 10 nM MBG. Thus, our results demonstrate that elevation of the [Na(+)]i/[K(+)]i ratio is an obligatory step for transcriptomic changes evoked by CTS in HUVEC. The molecular origin of upstream [Na(+)]i/[K(+)]i sensors involved in transcription regulation should be identified in forthcoming studies.
Eplerenone, an aldosterone antagonist, repolarizes muscle membrane in-vitro and increases strength in-vivo in channelopathies. In Duchenne dystrophy, it is administered for cardiomyopathy. We studied its mechanism of action on skeletal muscle to test its suitability for increasing strength in Duchenne dystrophy. Using membrane potential measurements, quantitative PCR, ELISA, and Western blots, we examined the effects of eplerenone on skeletal muscle Na,K-ATPase. The repolarizing effect of eplerenone in muscle fibres was counteracted by oubain, an ATPase blocker. In our experiment, ATPA1A mRNA and total ATPase protein were not elevated. Instead, Tyr10 of the α1 subunit was dephosphorylated which would agree with ATPase activation. Dephosporylation of the coupled Akt kinase corroborated our findings. We conclude that eplerenone repolarizes muscle membrane by Na,K-ATPase activation by dephosphorylation at Tyr10. Since ATPase protein is known to be compensatorily increased in Duchenne patients without activity change, eplerenone treatment may be beneficial.
Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is a condition of increased intracranial pressure (ICP) without identifiable cause. The majority of IIH patients are obese, which suggests a connection between ICP and obesity. The aim of the study was to compare ICP in lean and obese rats. We also aimed to clarify if any ICP difference could be attributed to changes in some well-known ICP modulators; retinol and arterial partial pressure of CO2 (pCO2). Another potential explanation could be differences in water transport across the choroid plexus (CP) epithelia, and thus we furthermore investigated expression profiles of aquaporin 1 and Na/K ATPase.
ICP was measured in obese and lean Zucker rats over a period of 28 days. Arterial pCO2 and serum retinol were measured in serum samples. The CPs were isolated and target mRNA and protein were analyzed by qPCR and western blot, respectively.
Obese rats had elevated ICP compared to lean controls on all recording days except day 0 (P&lt;0.001). Serum retinol (P=0.35) and arterial pCO2 (P=0.16) did not differ between the two groups. Both aquaporin 1 (AQP1) mRNA and protein levels were increased in the CP of the obese rats compared to lean rats (P=0.0422 and P=0.0281). There was no difference in Na/K ATPase mRNA or protein levels (P=0.2688 and P=0.1304).
Obese Zucker rats display intracranial hypertension and increased AQP1 expression in CP compared to lean controls. The mechanisms behind these changes are still unknown, but appear to be unrelated to altered pCO2 levels or retinol metabolism. This indicates that the increase in ICP might be related to increased AQP1 levels in CP. Although further studies are warranted, obese Zucker rats could potentially model some aspects of the IIH pathophysiology.International Journal of Obesity accepted article preview online, 27 March 2017. doi:10.1038/ijo.2017.83.
We investigated the metabolic and cellular stress responses in an endemic catfish Horabagrus brachysoma acclimated to ambient (26°C), 31, 33 and 36°C for 30 days. After acclimation, fish were sampled to investigate changes in the levels of blood glucose, tissue glycogen and ascorbic acid, activities of enzymes involved in glycolysis (LDH), citric acid cycle (MDH), gluconeogenesis (FBPase and G6Pase), pentose phosphate pathway (G6PDH), protein metabolism (AST and ALT), phosphate metabolism (ACP and ALP) and energy metabolism (ATPase), and HSP70 levels in various tissues. Acclimation to higher temperatures (33 and 36°C) significantly increased activities of LDH, MDH, ALP, ACP, AST, ALT and ATPase and blood glucose levels, whereas decreased the G6PDH enzyme activity and, tissue glycogen and ascorbic acid. Results indicated an overall increase in the carbohydrate, protein and lipid metabolism implying increased metabolic demands for maintaining homeostasis in fish acclimated to higher temperatures (33 and 36°C). We observed tissue specific response of HSP70 in H. brachysoma, with significant increase in gill and liver at 33 and 36°C, and in brain and muscle at 36°C, enabling cellular protection at higher acclimation temperatures. In conclusion, H. brachysoma adjusted metabolic and cellular responses to withstand increased temperatures, however, these responses suggest that the fish was under stress at 33°C or higher temperature.
Interactions between short protein segments and phospholipid bilayers dictate fundamental aspects of cellular activity and have important applications in biotechnology. Yet, a lack of suitable methodology for directly probing these interactions has hindered mechanistic understanding. We developed a precision atomic force microscope (AFM)-based single-molecule force spectroscopy assay and probed partitioning into lipid bilayers by measuring the mechanical force experienced by a peptide. Protein segments were constructed from the peripheral membrane protein SecA, a key ATPase in bacterial secretion. We focused on the first 10 amino-terminal residues of SecA (SecA2-11) which are known to be lipophilic. In addition to the core SecA2-11 sequence, constructs with nearly identical chemical composition but with differing geometry were used: two copies of SecA2-11 linked in series, and two copies in parallel. Lipid bilayer partitioning interactions of peptides with differing structures were distinguished. To model the energetic landscape, a theory of diffusive barrier crossing was extended to incorporate a superposition of potential barriers with variable weights. Analysis revealed two dissociation pathways for the core SecA2-11 sequence with well-separated intrinsic dissociation rates. Molecular dynamics simulations showed that the three peptides had significant conformational differences in solution that correlated well with measured variations in the propensity to partition into the bilayer. The methodology is generalizable and can be applied to other peptide and lipid species.
Bone is a metabolically active organ subjected to continuous remodeling process that involves resorption by osteoclast and subsequent formation by osteoblasts. Osteoclast involvement in this physiological event is regulated by macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) and receptor activator of nuclear factor κB ligand (RANKL). Fusion of mono-nuclear pre-osteoclasts is a critical event for osteoclast differentiation and for bone resorption. Here we show that PBMCs can be successfully fused with polyethylenglicol (PEG) in order to generated viable osteoclast-like cells that exhibit tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) and bone resorptive activities. PEG-fused PBMCs expressed additional markers compatible with osteoclastogenic differentiation such as carbonic anhydrase II (CAII), calcitonin receptor (CR), cathepsin K (Cat K), vacuolar ATPase (V-ATPase) subunit C1 (V-ATPase), integrin β3, RANK and cell surface aminopeptidase N/CD13. Actin redistribution in PEG-fused cells was found to be affected by cell cycle synchronization at G0/G1 or G2/M phases. PEG-induced fusion also led to expression of tyrosine kinases c-Src and Syk in their phosphorylated state. Scanning electron microscopy images showed morphological features typical of osteoclast-like cells. The results here shown allow concluding that PEG-induced fusion of PBMCs provides a suitable model system for understanding the mechanisms involved in osteoclastogenesis and for assaying new therapeutic strategies.
Proteins are subject to oxidative modification and the formation of adducts with a broad spectrum of reactive species via enzymatic and non-enzymatic mechanisms. Here we report that in vitro non-enzymatic methylglyoxal (MGO) binding causes the inhibition and formation of MGO advanced glycation end-products (MAGEs) in Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase (NKA). Concretely, MGO adducts with NKA amino acid residues (mainly Arg) and N(ε)-(carboxymethyl)lysine (CML) formation were found. MGO is not only an inhibitor for solubilized NKA (IC50 = 91±16 μM), but also for reconstituted NKA in the lipid bilayer environment, which was clearly demonstrated using a DPPC/DPPE liposome model in the presence or absence of the NKA-selective inhibitor ouabain. High-resolution mass spectrometric analysis of a tryptic digest of NKA isolated from pig (Sus scrofa) kidney indicates that the intracellular α-subunit is naturally (post-translationally) modified by MGO in vivo. In contrast to this, the β-subunit could only be modified by MGO artificially, and the transmembrane part of the protein did not undergo MGO binding under the experimental setup used. As with bovine serum albumin, serving as the water-soluble model, we also demonstrated a high binding capacity of MGO to water-poorly soluble NKA using a multi-spectral methodology based on electroanalytical, immunochemical and fluorimetric tools. In addition, a partial suppression of the MGO-mediated inhibitory effect could be observed in the presence of aminoguanidine (pimagedine), a glycation suppressor and MGO-scavenger. All the results here were obtained with the X-ray structure of NKA in the E1 conformation (3WGV) and could be used in the further interpretation of the functionality of this key enzyme in the presence of highly-reactive metabolic side-products, glycation agents and generally under oxidative stress conditions.
Ecumicin is a well-known and potent inhibitor of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Although the target of ecumicin is caseinolytic protease C1 (ClpC1), the exact mechanism by which ecumicin inhibits ClpC1 has not been identified. To analyze ecumicin's action on ClpC1, site-directed mutagenesis was performed on its binding site. The estimated binding residues within ClpC1 to ecumicin were selected via in silico analysis using molecular docking. The selected residues were mutated by site-directed mutagenesis and the effects on ecumicin binding were analyzed. Mutation at the R83 residue, especially the R83A mutation, in ClpC1 resulted in strong resistance to ATPase activation and inhibition of proteolytic activity. In addition, binding of ecumicin to the R83A ClpC1 N-terminal domain (residues 1-145) was not observed in native gel analysis. These results reveal that the R83 residue plays an important role in the binding of ecumicin. This result provides a basis for the development of an anti-tuberculosis agent based on ecumicin derivatives.
Wnt/β-catenin signaling plays a key role in embryonic development, stem cell biology, and neurogenesis. However, the mechanisms of Wnt signal transmission, notably how the receptors are regulated, remain incompletely understood. Here we describe that the Parkinson's disease-associated receptor GPR37 functions in the maturation of the N-terminal bulky β-propellers of the Wnt co-receptor LRP6. GPR37 is required for Wnt/β-catenin signaling and protects LRP6 from ER-associated degradation via CHIP (carboxyl terminus of Hsc70-interacting protein) and the ATPase VCP GPR37 is highly expressed in neural progenitor cells (NPCs) where it is required for Wnt-dependent neurogenesis. We conclude that GPR37 is crucial for cellular protein quality control during Wnt signaling.
The mechanisms of breast cancer collective invasion are poorly understood limiting the metastasis therapy. The ATPase RUVBL1 is frequently overexpressed in various cancers and plays a crucial role in oncogenic process. We further investigated the role of RUVBL1 in promoting collective invasion and uncovered that targeting RUVBL1 could inhibit metastatic progression.
The expression levels of RUVBL1 and ITFG1 were examined by Western blot and qRT-PCR. Co-localization and interaction of RUVBL1 and ITFG1 were determined by immunofluorescence and co-immunoprecipitation. The invasive ability was examined by transwell assay and microfluidic assay. The metastatic and tumorigenic abilities of breast cancer cells were revealed in BALB/c nude mice by xenograft and tail vein injection.
ATPase RUVBL1 is highly expressed in breast cancer and predicts the poor prognosis. Elevated expression of RUVBL1 is found in high metastatic breast cancer cells. Silencing RUVBL1 suppresses cancer cell expansion and invasion in vitro and in vivo. RUVBL1 interacts with a conserved transmembrane protein ITFG1 in cytoplasm and plasma membrane to promote the collective invasion. Using a microfluidic model, we demonstrated that silencing RUVBL1 or ITFG1 individually compromises collective invasion of breast cancer cells.
RUVBL1 is a vital regulator for collective invasion. The interactions between RUVBL1 and ITFG1 are required for breast cancer cell collective invasion and progression.
Targeting collective invasion promoted by RUVBL1-ITFG1 complex provides a novel therapeutic strategy to improve the prognosis of invasive breast cancer.
The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is an ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter that uniquely functions as an ion channel. Here, we present a 3.9 Å structure of dephosphorylated human CFTR without nucleotides, determined by electron cryomicroscopy (cryo-EM). Close resemblance of this human CFTR structure to zebrafish CFTR under identical conditions reinforces its relevance for understanding CFTR function. The human CFTR structure reveals a previously unresolved helix belonging to the R domain docked inside the intracellular vestibule, precluding channel opening. By analyzing the sigmoid time course of CFTR current activation, we propose that PKA phosphorylation of the R domain is enabled by its infrequent spontaneous disengagement, which also explains residual ATPase and gating activity of dephosphorylated CFTR. From comparison with MRP1, a feature distinguishing CFTR from all other ABC transporters is the helix-loop transition in transmembrane helix 8, which likely forms the structural basis for CFTR's channel function.
Oxidative stress is one of the major causes of methotrexate induced lung injury (MILI). Alpha-lipoic acid (ALA), which occurs naturally in human food, has antioxidative and anti-inflammatory activities. The aim of this study was to research the potential protective role of ALA on MILI in rats.
Twenty one rats were randomly subdivided into three groups: control (group I), methotrexate (MTX) treated (group II), and MTX+ALA treated (group III). Lung injury was performed with a single dose of MTX (20 mg/kg) to groups 2 and 3. On the sixth day, animals in all groups were sacrificed by decapitation and lung tissue and blood samples were removed for histological examination and also measurement the levels of interleukin-1-beta (IL-1β), malondialdehyde (MDA), glutathione (GSH), tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), myeloperoxidase (MPO), and sodium potassium-adenosine triphosphatase (Na+/K+ATPase).
In MTX group tissue GSH, Na+/K+ATPase activities were lower, tissue MDA, MPO and plasma IL-1?, TNF-? were significantly higher than the other groups. Histopathological examination showed that lung injury was less severe in group 2 according to group 3.
Oxidative damage of MTX in rat lung is partially reduced when combined with ALA.
The objectives of this study were to describe alterations that age and dietary inclusion of direct-fed microbial (DFM) Bacillus subtilis (BS) and a specific essential oil (EO) blend (carvacrol, cinnamaldehyde, cineol, and pepper extract) causes in the activity of digestive enzymes (maltase: MALT; aminopeptidase-N: APN; intestinal alkaline phosphate: IAP) and expression patterns of genes related to transport (oligopeptide transporter gene: SLC15A1; Na+-dependent glucose and galactose transporter gene: SLC5A1; Na+-independent glucose, galactose, and fructose transporter gene: SLC2A2; ATPase, Na+/K+ transporting gene: ATP1A1) and digestion (aminopeptidase-N gene: ANPEP; maltase-glucoamylase gene: MGAM; Sucrase-isomaltase gene: SI) of carbohydrates and proteins in the small intestine of broilers. Also, the objective was to analyze if growth performance of broilers is affected by supplementation (BS and EO blend). Day-old male broiler chicks (n = 1,320) were assigned to 5 treatments. Diets included a basal diet (BD) as a negative control (CON); experimental diets were BD + BS; BD + BS + EO; BD + EO; BD + antibiotic growth promoter (AGP) avilamycin was the positive control. Performance was evaluated between 1 to 42 d. Transcript abundance of transport-related genes and digestion-related genes were assayed by RT-qPCR and determined at d 7, 21, and 42. MALT-, APN-, and IAP-specific activities were determined at d 7, 21, and 42. Broilers fed BS had greater SLC15A1 mRNA abundance compared to CON, while EO and AGP were related to higher activities of IAP and APN. Analysis over time revealed higher abundance of MGAM, SLC2A2, SLC15A1, SLC5A1 and SI mRNA at d 42 when compared to d 7. Activity of IAP decreased after d 7 and activity of MALT increased with age. The current study suggests that age had effect over carbohydrate and protein transport and carbohydrate digestion. The supplementation of BS DFM hade evident effect over protein transport and that the use of EO in the diet enhanced the activities of carbohydrate and protein digestion, reflecting improvement in digestive and transport physiology of birds. Changes performed by BS DFM and EO did not favor performance.
Epidemiological investigations indicate that certain ingredients in tea bricks can antagonize the adverse effects of fluoride. Tea polyphenols (TPs), the most bioactive ingredient in tea bricks, have been demonstrated to be potent bone-supporting agents. ClC‑7 is known to be crucial for osteoclast (OC) bone resorption. Thus, in this study, we investigated the potential protective effects of TPs against fluorosis using a mouse model and explored the underlying mechanisms with particular focus on ClC‑7. A total of 40, healthy, 3‑week‑old male C57BL/6 mice were randomly divided into 4 groups (n=10/group) by weight as follows: distilled water (control group), 100 mg/l fluoridated water (F group), water containing 10 g/l TPs (TP group) and water containing 100 mg/l fluoride and 10 g/l TPs (F + TP group). After 15 weeks, and after the mice were sacrificed, the long bones were removed and bone marrow-derived macrophages were cultured ex vivo in order to perform several experiments. OCs were identified and counted by tartrate‑resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) staining. The consumption of fluoride resulted in severe fluorosis and in an impaired OC function [impaired bone resorption, and a low mRNA expression of nuclear factor of activated T-cells 1 (NFATc1), ATPase H+ transporting V0 subunit D2 (ATP6v0d2) and osteopetrosis‑associated transmembrane protein 1 (Ostm1)]. In the F + TP group, fluorosis was attenuated and OC function was restored, but not the high bone fluoride content. Compared with the F group, mature OCs in the F + TP group expressed higher mRNA levels of ClC‑7 and Ostm1; the transportation and retaining of Cl‑ was improved, as shown by the fluorescence intensity experiment. On the whole, our findings indicate that TPs mitigate fluorosis in C57BL/6 mice by regulating OC bone resorption. Fluoride inhibits OC resorption by inhibiting ClC‑7 and Ostm1, whereas TPs attenuate this inhibitory effect of fluoride.
Clinically, patients with significant reductions in renal function present with cardiovascular dysfunction typically termed, uremic cardiomyopathy. It is a progressive series of cardiac pathophysiological changes, including left ventricular diastolic dysfunction and hypertrophy (LVH) which sometimes progress to left ventricular dilation (LVD) and systolic dysfunction in the setting of chronic kidney disease (CKD). Uremic cardiomyopathy is almost ubiquitous in patients afflicted with end stage renal disease (ESRD). Areas covered: This article reviews recent epidemiology, pathophysiology of uremic cardiomyopathy and provide a board overview of Na/K-ATPase research with detailed discussion on the mechanisms of Na/K-ATPase/Src/ROS amplification loop. We also present clinical and preclinical evidences as well as molecular mechanism of this amplification loop in the development of uremic cardiomyopathy. A potential therapeutic peptide that targets on this loop is discussed. Expert opinion: Current clinical treatment for uremic cardiomyopathy remains disappointing. Targeting the ROS amplification loop mediated by the Na/K-ATPase signaling function may provide a novel therapeutic target for uremic cardiomyopathy and related diseases. Additional studies of Na/K-ATPase and other strategies that regulate this loop will lead to new therapeutics.
Asthma is a common disorder characterized, in part, by airway smooth muscle (ASM) hyperresponsiveness. Transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) is a non-selective cation channel expressed on airway nerve fibers that modulates afferent signals resulting in cough, and potentially bronchoconstriction. In the present study, the TRPV1 transcript was detected by RT-PCR in primary cultured human ASM cells, and the TRPV1 protein was detected in ASM of human trachea by immunohistochemistry. Proximity ligation assays suggest that TRPV1 is expressed in the sarcoplasmic reticulum membrane of human ASM cells in close association with sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase 2. In guinea pig tracheal ring organ bath experiments, the TRPV1 agonist capsaicin led to ASM contraction, but this contraction was significantly attenuated by the sodium-channel inhibitor bupivicaine (N=4, p&lt;0.05) and the NK-2 receptor antagonist GR 159897 (N=4, p&lt;0.05), suggesting that this contraction is neurally-mediated. However, pretreatment of guinea pig and human ASM in organ bath experiments with the TRPV1 antagonist capsazepine inhibited the maintenance phase of an acetylcholine-induced contraction (N=4, p&lt;0.01 for both species). Similarly, capsazepine inhibited methacholine-induced contraction of peripheral airways in mouse precision-cut lung slice (PCLS) experiments (N=4-5, p&lt;0.05). Although capsazepine did not inhibit store-operated calicum entry in mouse ASM cells in PCLS (N=4-7, p=NS), it did inhibit calcium oscillations (N=3, p&lt;0.001). These studies suggest that TRPV1 is expressed on ASM, including the SR, but that ASM TRPV1 activation does not play a significant role in initiation of ASM contraction. However, capsazepine does inhibit maintenance of contraction, likely by inhibiting calcium oscillation.
Astrocytes play key roles in the central nervous system and regulate local blood flow and synaptic transmission via intracellular calcium (Ca(2+)) signaling. Astrocytic Ca(2+) signals are generated by multiple pathways: Ca(2+) release from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) via the inositol 1, 4, 5-trisphosphate receptor (IP3R) and Ca(2+) influx through various Ca(2+) channels on the plasma membrane. However, the Ca(2+) channels involved in astrocytic Ca(2+) homeostasis or signaling have not been fully characterized. Here, we demonstrate that spontaneous astrocytic Ca(2+) transients in cultured hippocampal astrocytes were induced by cooperation between the Ca(2+) release from the ER and the Ca(2+) influx through store-operated calcium channels (SOCCs) on the plasma membrane. Ca(2+) imaging with plasma membrane targeted GCaMP6f revealed that spontaneous astroglial Ca(2+) transients were impaired by pharmacological blockade of not only Ca(2+) release through IP3Rs, but also Ca(2+) influx through SOCCs. Loss of SOCC activity resulted in the depletion of ER Ca(2+), suggesting that SOCCs are activated without store depletion in hippocampal astrocytes. Our findings indicate that sustained SOCC activity, together with that of the sarco-endoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase, contribute to the maintenance of astrocytic Ca(2+) store levels, ultimately enabling astrocytic Ca(2+) signaling.
The eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) is considered as a key survival protein involved in cell cycle progression, transformation and apoptosis resistance. Herein, we demonstrate that medicinal plant derivative 3-AWA (from Withaferin A) suppressed the proliferation and metastasis of CaP cells through abrogation of eIF4E activation and expression via c-FLIP dependent mechanism. This translational attenuation prevents the de novo synthesis of major players of metastatic cascades viz. c-FLIP, c-Myc and cyclin D1. Moreover, the suppression of c-FLIP due to inhibition of translation initiation complex by 3-AWA enhanced FAS trafficking, BID and caspase 8 cleavage. Further ectopically restored c-Myc and GFP-HRas mediated activation of eIF4E was reduced by 3-AWA in transformed NIH3T3 cells. Detailed underlying mechanisms revealed that 3-AWA inhibited Ras-Mnk and PI3-AKT-mTOR, two major pathways through which eIF4E converges upon eIF4F hub. In addition to in vitro studies, we confirmed that 3-AWA efficiently suppressed tumor growth and metastasis in different mouse models. Given that 3-AWA inhibits c-FLIP through abrogation of translation initiation by co-targeting mTOR and Mnk-eIF4E, it (3-AWA) can be exploited as a lead pharmacophore for promising anti-cancer therapeutic development.
To explore the changes in the body weight and height of Menkes disease (MNK) patients treated with long-term copper-histidine.
A survey involving a retrospective review of medical records or summaries of MNK patients was conducted. Patients were 44 males born after 1994, and their feeding method and genetic analysis of the ATP7A gene were reviewed. We compared the data of body weight and height from birth until 6 years between classical MNK patients and the general population obtained from national data and between patients who received early treatment and patients who received late treatment.
Although five patients who received early treatment reached some developmental milestones, the body weight and height did not differ from patients who received late treatment in the mode of oral nutrition, and were lower in comparison to the national data (&lt;3 percentile).
We reported changes in the body weight and height of MNK patients who received early and late treatment. Although early treatment with copper-histidine had favorable effects on neurological development, it did not result in improvements in body weight and height. We suggest that the establishment of sufficient nutritional support is necessary along with early parenteral copper treatment to improve whole body condition in MNK patients.
To examine levels of lactate (LA) and pyruvate (PA) in both blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in patients with Menkes disease (MNK).
A nationwide survey involving a retrospective review of medical records or medical record summaries of 42 male patients with MNK born between 1993 and 2008 were performed, and the genetic analysis of their ATP7A gene was reviewed.
In these patients, LA and PA levels and the lactate vs pyruvate ratio (L/P ratio) at diagnosis in both blood and CSF were abnormally high. There were no significant differences in LA levels, PA levels, and the L/P ratio between blood and CSF at diagnosis (P &gt; .05). There was also no correlation between LA levels, PA levels, and the L/P ratio, and age at measurement (P &gt; .05). There was no or slight metabolic acidosis, as analyzed by blood gas analysis, in 7 patients. During treatment with subcutaneous injections of copper-histidine, LA and PA levels and the L/P ratio in both the blood and CSF decreased.
Our findings suggest that LA and PA levels, and in particular, the L/P ratio, and blood gas analysis can be used to guide the diagnosis and management of MNK.
Mnk kinases regulate the phosphorylation and activation of the eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (eIF4E), a protein that plays key roles in the initiation of messenger RNA translation and whose activity is critical for various cellular functions. eIF4E is deregulated in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and its aberrant activity contributes to leukemogenesis. We determined whether cercosporamide, an antifungal agent that was recently shown to act as a unique Mnk inhibitor, exhibits antileukemic properties. Treatment of AML cells with cercosporamide resulted in a dose-dependent suppression of eIF4E phosphorylation. Such suppression of Mnk kinase activity and eIF4E phosphorylation by cercosporamide resulted in dose-dependent suppressive effects on primitive leukemic progenitors (CFU-L) from AML patients and enhanced the antileukemic properties of cytarabine (Ara-C) or mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) complex 1 inhibition. Similarly, the combination of cercosporamide with cytarabine resulted in enhanced antileukemic responses in a xenograft mouse model in vivo. Altogether, this work demonstrates that the unique Mnk inhibitor cercosporamide suppresses phosphorylation of eIF4E and exhibits antileukemic effects, in support of future clinical-translational efforts involving combinations of Mnk inhibitors with cytarabine and/or mTOR inhibitors for the treatment of AML.
Menkes disease (MNK) is an X-linked recessive disorder. Incidence of live-born infants with MNK is 2.8 per million live births in Japan. The aim of this study was to observe congenital malformations (CMs) in MNK patients. Subjects comprised 35 Japanese male patients with classical MNK who received copper histidine treatment. Patient clinical data were obtained anonymously from medical records or medical record summaries by pediatrician's retrospective review through a survey. We observed 21 different CMs in 14 patients. Eight of these had a single CM, while six had multiple CMs. The most frequent CM was higher arched palate with other CMs found in five patients. There was no relationship between CMs and mutations in the ATP7A gene. Using Mann-Whitney U tests, age at death was also significantly lower in MNK patients with CMs (P&lt;0.05), compared to those without CMs, even though there was no significant difference of age onset, age at diagnosis and age at start of treatment with copper histidine between both groups of patients. Sudden death occurred in three MNK patients with CMs only: two with congenital heart disease, and one with microphallus.
Menkes disease is an infantile-onset X-linked recessive neurodegenerative disorder caused by diverse mutations in a copper-transport gene, ATP7A. Affected patients are characterized by progressive hypotonia, seizures, failure to thrive and death in early childhood. Here, we report a case of Menkes disease presented by intractable seizures and infantile spasms. A 3-month-old male infant had visited our pediatric clinic for lethargy, floppy muscle tone, poor oral intake and partial seizures. His hair was kinky, brown colored and fragile. Partial seizures became more frequent, generalized and intractable to antiseizure medications. An EEG showed frequent posteriorly dominant generalized spikes that were consistent with a generalized seizure. From a genetic analysis, a c.2743C&gt;T (p.Gln915X) mutation was detected and diagnosed as Menkes disease. The mutation is a novel one that has not been previously reported as a cause of Menkes disease.
Copper is an essential trace element necessary for normal growth and development. During pregnancy, copper is transported from the maternal circulation to the fetus by mechanisms which have not been clearly elucidated. Two copper transporting ATPases, Menkes (ATP7A; MNK) and Wilson (ATP7B; WND) are known to be expressed in the placenta and are thought to have a role in copper transport to the fetus. In this study, the intracellular localisation of the MNK and WND proteins in the third trimester human placental tissue was investigated in detail using double-label immunohistochemistry and immuno-electron microscopy. MNK and WND were differentially localised within the placenta. MNK was present at the basal side of the syncytiotrophoblast layer and also within the fetal vascular endothelial cells, whereas WND was localised at the microvillous membrane of the syncytiotrophoblast. These data offer some insights into possible differential roles for MNK and WND within the placenta.
The copper-translocating Menkes (ATP7A, MNK protein) and Wilson (ATP7B, WND protein) P-type ATPases are pivotal for copper (Cu) homeostasis, functioning in the biosynthetic incorporation of Cu into copper-dependent enzymes of the secretory pathway, Cu detoxification via Cu efflux, and specialized roles such as systemic Cu absorption (MNK) and Cu excretion (WND). Essential to these functions is their Cu and hormone-responsive distribution between the trans-Golgi network (TGN) and exocytic vesicles located at or proximal to the apical (WND) or basolateral (MNK) cell surface. Intriguingly, MNK and WND Cu-ATPases expressed in the same tissues perform distinct yet complementary roles. While intramolecular differences may specify their distinct roles, cellular signaling components are predicted to be critical for both differences and synergy between these enzymes. This review focuses on these mechanisms, including the cell signaling pathways that influence trafficking and bi-functionality of Cu-ATPases. Phosphorylation events are hypothesized to play a central role in Cu homeostasis, promoting multi-layered regulation and cross-talk between cuproenzymes and Cu-independent mechanisms.
Prion diseases are associated with the conformational conversion of the host-encoded cellular prion protein into an abnormal pathogenic isoform. Reduction in prion protein levels has potential as a therapeutic approach in treating these diseases. Key targets for this goal are factors that affect the regulation of the prion protein gene. Recent in vivo and in vitro studies have suggested a role for prion protein in copper homeostasis. Copper can also induce prion gene expression in rat neurons. However, the mechanism involved in this regulation remains to be determined. We hypothesized that transcription factors SP1 and metal transcription factor-1 (MTF-1) may be involved in copper-mediated regulation of human prion gene. To test the hypothesis, we utilized human fibroblasts that are deleted or overexpressing the Menkes protein (MNK), a major mammalian copper efflux protein. Menkes deletion fibroblasts have high intracellular copper, whereas Menkes overexpressed fibroblasts have severely depleted intracellular copper. We have utilized this system previously to demonstrate copper-dependent regulation of the Alzheimer amyloid precursor protein. Here we demonstrate that copper depletion in MNK overexpressed fibroblasts decreases cellular prion protein and PRNP gene levels. Conversely, expression of transcription factors SP1 and/or MTF-1 significantly increases prion protein levels and up-regulates prion gene expression in copper-replete MNK deletion cells. Furthermore, siRNA "knockdown" of SP1 or MTF-1 in MNK deletion cells decreases prion protein levels and down-regulates prion gene expression. These data support a novel mechanism whereby SP1 and MTF-1 act as copper-sensing transcriptional activators to regulate human prion gene expression and further support a role for the prion protein to function in copper homeostasis. Expression of the prion protein is a vital component for the propagation of prion diseases; thus SP1 and MTF-1 represent new targets in the development of key therapeutics toward modulating the expression of the cellular prion protein and ultimately the prevention of prion disease.
Deregulation of the phosphatidyl inositol trisphosphate kinase/AKT/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and RAS/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/MNK pathways frequently occurs in human prostate carcinomas (PCas) and leads to aberrant modulation of messenger RNA (mRNA) translation. We have investigated the relative contribution of these pathways to translational regulation and proliferation of PCa cells. MNK-dependent phosphorylation of eIF4E is elevated in DU145 cells, which have low basal levels of AKT/mTOR activity due to the expression of the tumor suppressor PTEN. In contrast, eIF4E phosphorylation is low in PC3 and LNCaP cells with mutated PTEN and constitutively active AKT/mTOR pathway, but it can be strongly induced through inhibition of mTOR activity by rapamycin or serum depletion. Remarkably, we found that inhibition of MNKs strongly reduced the polysomal recruitment of terminal oligopyrimidine messenger RNAs (TOP mRNAs), which are known targets of mTOR-dependent translational control. Pull-down assays of the eIF4F complex indicated that translation initiation was differently affected by inhibition of MNKs and mTOR. In addition, concomitant treatment with MNK inhibitor and rapamycin exerted additive effects on polysomal recruitment of TOP mRNAs and protein synthesis. The MNK inhibitor was more effective than rapamycin in blocking proliferation of PTEN-expressing cells, whereas combination of the two inhibitors suppressed cell cycle progression in both cell lines. Microarray analysis showed that MNK affected translation of mRNAs involved in cell cycle progression. Thus, our results indicate that a balance between the activity of the AKT/mTOR and the MAPK/MNK pathway in PCa cells maintains a defined translational level of specific mRNAs required for ribosome biogenesis, cell proliferation and stress response and might confer to these cells the ability to overcome negative insults.
The extracellular superoxide dismutase (SOD3), a secretory copper-containing enzyme, regulates angiotensin II (Ang II)-induced hypertension by modulating levels of extracellular superoxide anion. The present study was designed to determine the role of the copper transporter Menkes ATPase (MNK) in Ang II-induced SOD3 activity and hypertension in vivo. Here we show that chronic Ang II infusion enhanced systolic blood pressure and vascular superoxide anion production in MNK mutant (MNK(mut)) mice as compared with those in wild-type mice, which are associated with impaired acetylcholine-induced endothelium-dependent vasorelaxation in MNK(mut) mice. These effects in MNK(mut) mice are rescued by infusion of the SOD mimetic Tempol. By contrast, norepinephrine-induced hypertension, which is not associated with an increase in vascular superoxide anion production, is not affected in MNK(mut) mice. Mechanistically, basal and Ang II infusion-induced increase in vascular SOD3-specific activity is significantly inhibited in MNK(mut) mice. Coimmunoprecipitation analysis reveals that Ang II stimulation promotes association of MNK with SOD3 in cultured vascular smooth muscle cell and in mouse aortas, which may contribute to SOD3-specific activity by increasing copper delivery to SOD3 through MNK. In summary, MNK plays an important role in modulating Ang II-induced hypertension and endothelial function by regulating SOD3 activity and vascular superoxide anion production and becomes a potential therapeutic target for oxidant stress-dependent cardiovascular diseases.
Neurodegenerative illnesses are characterized by aberrant metabolism of biometals such as copper (Cu), zinc (Zn) and iron (Fe). However, little is known about the metabolic effects associated with altered metal homeostasis. In this study, we used an in vitro model of altered Cu homeostasis to investigate how Cu regulates cellular protein expression. Human fibroblasts containing a natural deletion mutation of the Menkes (MNK) ATP7A Cu transporter (MNK deleted) were compared to fibroblasts overexpressing ATP7A (MNK transfected). Cultures of MNK-transfected (Low-Cu) cells exhibited 95% less intracellular Cu than MNK-deleted (High-Cu) cells. Comparative proteomic analysis of the two cell-lines was performed using antibody microarrays, and significant differential protein expression was observed between Low-Cu and High-Cu cell-lines. Western blot analysis confirmed the altered protein expression of Ku80, nexilin, L-caldesmon, MAP4, Inhibitor 2 and DNA topoisomerase I. The top 50 altered proteins were analysed using the software program Pathway Studio (Ariadne Genomics) and revealed a significant over-representation of proteins involved in DNA repair and maintenance. Further analysis confirmed that expression of the DNA repair protein Ku80 was dependent on cellular Cu homeostasis and that Low-Cu levels in fibroblasts resulted in elevated susceptibility to DNA oxidation.
The copper transporting ATPases, Menkes (ATP7A; MNK) and Wilson (ATP7B; WND) are essential for normal copper transport in the human body. The placenta is the key organ in copper supply to the fetus during pregnancy and it is one of the few organs in the body to express both of the ATPases. The placenta therefore provides a unique opportunity to elucidate the specific roles of these transporters within the one cell type.
Using polarized placental Jeg-3 cells, siRNA technology and radio-labelled 64Cu transport assays, MNK and WND were shown to have distinct roles in the vectorial transport of copper. MNK transported copper from the cell via the basolateral membrane and in contrast, WND transported copper from the apical membrane. Inactivation of MNK resulted in decreased activity of two important cuproenzymes, lysyl oxidase and Cu/Zn-superoxide dismutase.
Overall, these results provide definitive evidence for distinct roles of MNK and WND in the human placenta, and are consistent with a role for MNK in the transport of copper into the fetal circulation, and through delivery of copper to placental cuproenzymes, whilst WND contributes to the maintenance of placental copper homeostasis by transporting copper to the maternal circulation.
ATP7A (MNK) regulates copper homeostasis by translocating from a compartment localized within the trans-Golgi network to the plasma membrane (PM) in response to increased copper load. The mechanisms that regulate the biogenesis of the MNK compartment and the trafficking of MNK are unclear. Here we show that the architecture of the MNK compartment is linked to the structure of the Golgi ribbon. Depletion of p115 tethering factor, which causes fragmentation of the Golgi ribbon, also disrupts the MNK compartment. In p115-depleted cells, MNK localizes to punctate structures that pattern on Golgi ministacks dispersed throughout the cell. Despite altered localization MNK trafficking still occurs, and MNK relocates from and returns to the fragmented compartment in response to copper. We further show that the biogenesis of the MNK compartment requires activation of ADP-ribosylation factor (Arf)1 GTPase, shown previously to facilitate the biogenesis of the Golgi ribbon. Activation of cellular Arf1 is prevented by 1) expressing an inactive "empty" form of Arf (Arf1/N126I), 2) expressing an inactive form of GBF1 (GBF1/E794K), guanine nucleotide exchange factor for Arf1, or 3) treating cells with brefeldin A, an inhibitor of GBF1 that disrupts MNK into a diffuse pattern. Importantly, preventing Arf activation inhibits copper-responsive trafficking of MNK to the PM. Our findings support a model in which active Arf is essential for the generation of the MNK compartment and for copper-responsive trafficking of MNK from there to the PM. Our findings provide an exciting foundation for identifying Arf1 effectors that facilitate the biogenesis of the MNK compartment and MNK traffic.
Owing to mutations in the copper-transporting P-type ATPase, ATP7A (or MNK), patients with Menkes disease (MD) have an inadequate supply of copper to various copper-dependent enzymes. The ATP7A protein is located in the trans-Golgi network, where it transports copper via secretory compartments to copper-dependent enzymes. Raised copper concentrations result in the trafficking of ATP7A to the plasma membrane, where it functions in copper export. An important model of MD is the Mottled mouse, which possesses mutations in Atp7A. The Mottled mouse displays three distinct phenotypic severities: embryonic lethal, perinatal lethal and a longer-lived viable phenotype. However, the effects of mutations from these phenotypic classes on the ATP7A protein are unknown. In this study, we found that these classes of mutation differentially affect the copper transport and trafficking functions of the ATP7A protein. The embryonic lethal mutation, Atp7a(mo11H) (11H), caused mislocalisation of the protein to the endoplasmic reticulum, impaired glycosylation, and abolished copper delivery to the secretory pathway. In contrast, the perinatal lethal and viable mutations, Atp7a(moMac) (Macular) and Atp7a(moVbr) (Viable brindle) both resulted in a reduction in copper delivery to the secretory pathway and constitutive trafficking of the ATP7A protein to the plasma membrane in the absence of additional copper. In the case of Viable brindle, this hypertrafficking response was dependent on the catalytic phosphorylation site of ATP7A, whereas no such requirement was found for the Macular mutation. These findings provide evidence that the degree of MD severity in mice is associated with both copper transport and trafficking defects in the ATP7A protein.
Copper (Cu) plays a critical role in the developing foetus, but virtually nothing is known concerning the regulation of its uptake and metabolism in the placenta. In this issue of the Biochemical Journal, Hardman and colleagues, using a model of placental trophoblasts in culture, identify differential hormonal regulation of two copper-transporting ATPases; namely, those responsible for Menkes disease (ATP7A; MNK) and Wilson disease (ATP7B; WND). Insulin and oestrogen, which are essential during gestation, up-regulate MNK and this leads to trafficking of the MNK protein from the Golgi to the basolateral membrane, resulting in increased Cu efflux. At the same time, insulin decreased WND levels, and this leads to intracellular sequestration of the protein to a perinuclear region that reduces apical Cu release. As such, this results in a concerted flux of Cu from the basolateral surface of the trophoblast that would potentially be used by the developing foetus. An integrated model of vectorized Cu transport is proposed, which involves co-ordinated expression of transporters, organelle interactions and probable protein-protein interactions. The findings have wider implications for considering general models of intracellular metal transport.
Copper deficiency during pregnancy results in early embryonic death and foetal structural abnormalities including skeletal, pulmonary and cardiovascular defects. During pregnancy, copper is transported from the maternal circulation to the foetus by mechanisms which have not been clearly elucidated. Two copper-transporting ATPases, Menkes (ATP7A; MNK) and Wilson (ATP7B; WND), are expressed in the placenta and both are involved in placental copper transport, as copper accumulates in the placenta in both Menkes and Wilson disease. The regulatory mechanisms of MNK and WND and their exact role in the placenta are unknown. Using a differentiated polarized Jeg-3 cell culture model of placental trophoblasts, MNK and WND were shown to be expressed within these cells. Distinct roles for MNK and WND are suggested on the basis of their opposing responses to insulin. Insulin and oestrogen increased both MNK mRNA and protein levels, altered the localization of MNK towards the basolateral membrane in a copper-independent manner, and increased the transport of copper across this membrane. In contrast, levels of WND were decreased in response to insulin, and the protein was located in a tight perinuclear region, with a corresponding decrease in copper efflux across the apical membrane. These results are consistent with a model of copper transport in the placenta in which MNK delivers copper to the foetus and WND returns excess copper to the maternal circulation. Insulin and oestrogen stimulate copper transport to the foetus by increasing the expression of MNK and reducing the expression of WND. These data show for the first time that MNK and WND are differentially regulated by the hormones insulin and oestrogen in human placental cells.
The MNK (Menkes disease protein; ATP7A) is a major copper- transporting P-type ATPase involved in the delivery of copper to cuproenzymes in the secretory pathway and the efflux of excess copper from extrahepatic tissues. Mutations in the MNK (ATP7A) gene result in Menkes disease, a fatal neurodegenerative copper deficiency disorder. Currently, detailed biochemical and biophysical analyses of MNK to better understand its mechanisms of copper transport are not possible due to the lack of purified MNK in an active form. To address this issue, we expressed human MNK with an N-terminal Glu-Glu tag in Sf9 [Spodoptera frugiperda (fall armyworm) 9] insect cells and purified it by antibody affinity chromatography followed by size-exclusion chromatography in the presence of the non-ionic detergent DDM (n-dodecyl beta-D-maltopyranoside). Formation of the classical vanadate-sensitive phosphoenzyme by purified MNK was activated by Cu(I) [EC50=0.7 microM; h (Hill coefficient) was 4.6]. Furthermore, we report the first measurement of Cu(I)-dependent ATPase activity of MNK (K0.5=0.6 microM; h=5.0). The purified MNK demonstrated active ATP-dependent vectorial 64Cu transport when reconstituted into soya-bean asolectin liposomes. Together, these data demonstrated that Cu(I) interacts with MNK in a co-operative manner and with high affinity in the sub-micromolar range. The present study provides the first biochemical characterization of a purified full-length mammalian copper-transporting P-type ATPase associated with a human disease.
Skin aging has long been important to human beings and in recent years this field has received tremendous attention by both researchers and the general population. Cutaneous aging includes two distinct phenomena, intrinsic aging and photoaging, and is characterized mainly by the loss of collagen fibers from dermis. Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are widely prescribed gastric acid-reducing agents that are usually consumed for long periods in some conditions such as gastroesophageal reflux disease. We suggest that PPIs can accentuate skin aging by two mechanisms. First, through increasing intralysosomal PH, PPIs can suppress transforming growth factor-beta (TGFbeta) processing and consequently decrease its secretion. Second, through inhibiting MNK, a P-type ATPase with steady-state localization at the trans-Golgi network, PPIs can hamper copper transport and consequently curb lysyl oxidase activity.
Copper homeostasis is achieved by a combination of regulated uptake, efflux and sequestration and is essential for animal health and viability. Transmembrane copper transport proteins of the P-type ATPase family play key roles in cellular copper efflux. Here, the transcriptional and post-translational regulation of DmATP7, the sole Drosophila melanogaster ortholog of the human MNK and WND copper transport genes, is examined. An enhancer element with sufficient regulatory information to rescue DmATP7 mutant flies to adulthood is identified. This regulatory element drives expression in all neuronal tissues examined and demonstrates copper-inducible, Mtf-1 dependent expression in the larval midgut. These results support an important functional role for copper transport in neuronal tissues and indicate that regulation of DmATP7 expression is not used to limit copper absorption in toxic copper conditions. Localisation of a functional EYFP-DmATP7 fusion protein is also examined. This fusion protein localises at or proximal to the basolateral membrane of DmATP7 expressing midgut cells supporting a role for DmATP7 in export of copper from midgut cells.
Wilson and Menkes diseases are genetic disorders of copper metabolism caused by mutations in the Wilson (WND) and Menkes (MNK) copper-transporting P1B-type ATPases. The N termini of these ATPases consist of six metal binding domains (MBDs). The MBDs interact with the copper chaperone Atox1 and are believed to play roles in catalysis and in copper-mediated cellular relocalization of WND and MNK. Although all six MBDs have similar folds and bind one Cu(I) ion via a conserved CXXC motif, biochemical and genetic data suggest that they have distinct functions. Most studies aimed at characterizing the MBDs have employed smaller polypeptides consisting of one or two domains. The role of each MBD is probably defined by its environment within the six-domain N terminus, however. To study the properties of the individual domains within the context of the intact Wilson N terminus (N-WND), a series of variants in which five of the six metal binding CXXC motifs are mutated to SXXS was generated. For each variant, the Cu(I) binding affinity and the ability to exchange Cu(I) with Atox1 were investigated. The results indicate that Atox1 can deliver Cu(I) to and remove Cu(I) from each MBD, that each MBD has stronger Cu(I) retention properties than Atox1, and that all of the MBDs as well as Atox1 have similar K(Cu) values of (2.2-6.3) x 10(10) m(-1). Therefore, the specific role of each MBD is not conferred by its position within the intact N-WND but may be related to interactions with other domains and partner proteins.
Althouygh Menkes disease has well-recognized neurologic, developmental, and cutaneous features, the initial presentation may resemble child abuse. We describe a 5-month-old boy with multiple fractures indicative of nonaccidental trauma who was ultimately diagnosed with Menkes disease. Copper deficiency leads to connective tissue abnormalities and may result in subdural hematomas, wormian bones, cervical spine defects, rib fractures, and spurring of the long bone metaphyses. Several of these findings, including fractures and subdural hematomas, may be misinterpreted as child abuse.
Reducing the exposure of children and young people to the marketing of unhealthy foods is a core strategy for reducing the high overweight and obesity prevalence in this population. The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) has recently reviewed its self-regulatory codes and proposed a revised single code on advertising to children. This article evaluates the proposed code against eight criteria for an effective code, which were included in a submission to the ASA review process from over 70 New Zealand health professors. The evaluation found that the proposed code largely represents no change or uncertain change from the existing codes, and cannot be expected to provide substantial protection for children and young people from the marketing of unhealthy foods. Government regulations will be needed to achieve this important outcome.
Fulfilling a bevy of biological roles, copper is an essential metal for healthy brain function. Cu dyshomeostasis has been demonstrated to be involved in some neurological conditions including Menkes and Alzheimer's diseases. We have previously reported localized Cu-rich aggregates in astrocytes of the subventricular zone (SVZ) in rodent brains with Cu concentrations in the hundreds of millimolar. Metallothionein, a cysteine-rich protein critical to metal homeostasis and known to participate in a variety of neuroprotective and neuroregenerative processes, was proposed as a binding protein. Here, we present an analysis of metallothionein(1,2) knockout (MTKO) mice and age-matched controls using X-ray fluorescence microscopy. In large structures such as the corpus callosum, cortex, and striatum, there is no significant difference in Cu, Fe, or Zn concentrations in MTKO mice compared to age-matched controls. In the astrocyte-rich subventricular zone where Cu-rich aggregates reside, approximately 1/3 as many Cu-rich aggregates persist in MTKO mice resulting in a decrease in periventricular Cu concentration. Aggregates in both wild-type and MTKO mice show XANES spectra characteristic of CuxSy multimetallic clusters and have similar [S]/[Cu] ratios. Consistent with assignment as a CuxSy multimetallic cluster, the astrocyte-rich SVZ of both MTKO and wild-type mice exhibit autofluorescent bodies, though MTKO mice exhibit fewer. Furthermore, XRF imaging of Au-labeled lysosomes and ubiquitin demonstrates a lack of co-localization with Cu-rich aggregates suggesting they are not involved in a degradation pathway. Overall, these data suggest that Cu in aggregates is bound by either metallothionein-3 or a yet unknown protein similar to metallothionein.
We examined the extent to which ethnicity, cannabis and alcohol use could predict prevalence of violence and self-harm in an inpatient psychiatric sample.
We collected demographic and clinical data in a series of 141 adult psychiatric inpatients in Hamilton, New Zealand. The Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) and Cannabis Use Disorders Identification Test, Revised (CUDIT-R) were used to measure substance use. Clinical assessment and file review were used to verify histories of self-harm and violence.
It was found that 66% had a history of violence, 54% of self-harm, and 40% of both; only 20% had neither. Cannabis use was found to significantly predict lifetime history of violence ( p = 0.02); other independent variables (gender, age, ethnicity, alcohol use, psychiatric diagnosis) did not. Self-harm was strikingly predicted by female gender ( p &lt; 0.001), as well as by measures both of cannabis ( p = 0.025) and alcohol use ( p = 0.036); age, ethnicity and diagnosis did not reach significance. Less than 10% of patients were engaged with drug or alcohol services.
Cannabis use is a significant predictor of lifetime violence among the severely mentally ill, while both alcohol and cannabis use predict self-harm. Few affected patients receive specific treatment for substance use comorbidity.
Deficiency of one of the copper transporters ATP7A and ATP7B leads to the rare X-linked disorder Menkes Disease (MD) or the rare autosomal disorder Wilson disease (WD), respectively. In order to investigate whether the ATP7A and the ATP7B genes may be transcriptionally regulated, we measured the expression level of the two genes at various concentrations of iron, copper, and insulin. Treating fibroblasts from controls or from individuals with MD or WD for 3 and 10 days with iron chelators revealed that iron deficiency led to increased transcript levels of both ATP7A and ATP7B. Copper deficiency obtained by treatment with the copper chelator led to a downregulation of ATP7A in the control fibroblasts, but surprisingly not in the WD fibroblasts. In contrast, the addition of copper led to an increased expression of ATP7A, but a decreased expression of ATP7B. Thus, whereas similar regulation patterns for the two genes were observed in response to iron deficiency, different responses were observed after changes in the access to copper. Mosaic fibroblast cultures from female carriers of MD treated with copper or copper chelator for 6-8 weeks led to clonal selection. Cells that express the normal ATP7A allele had a selective growth advantage at high copper concentrations, whereas more surprisingly, cells that express the mutant ATP7A allele had a selective growth advantage at low copper concentrations. Thus, although the transcription of ATP7A is regulated by copper, clonal growth selection in mosaic cell cultures is affected by the level of copper. Female carriers of MD are rarely affected probably due to a skewed inactivation of the X-chromosome bearing the ATP7A mutation.
Disorders of copper homeostasis are currently recognized across the life span. Their recognition and links to human disease have spanned several decades, beginning with the recognition of a degenerative disorder in the offspring of sheep grazing in copper-deficient pastures, through to the description of infants suffering from a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by epileptic seizures, developmental regression, failure to thrive, and an unusual hair quality (giving the condition its distinctive label of "kinky hair disease"). In this review, we trace the historical background and describe the biochemistry and physiology of copper metabolism and transport, inheritance patterns, molecular genetics, and genotype-phenotype correlations based on current understanding of the disorder. It is clear from the clinical presentations and variants that disorders of copper homeostasis include phenotypes ranging from mild occipital horn syndrome to intermediate and severe forms of classical Menkes disease. The symptoms involve multiple organ systems such as brain, lung, gastrointestinal tract, urinary tract, connective tissue, and skin. A multisystem disorder needs a multidisciplinary approach to care, as treatment interventions permit longer survival for some individuals. Animal models have been developed to help screen treatment options and provide a better understanding of these disorders in the laboratory. Finally, we propose a multidisciplinary approach to promote continued research (both basic and clinical) to improve survival, quality of life, and care for these conditions.
Chronic airway diseases are characterized by airway remodeling which is attributed partly to the proliferation and migration of airway smooth muscle cells (ASMCs). ATP-sensitive potassium (KATP) channels have been identified in ASMCs. Mount evidence has suggested that KATP channel openers can reduce airway hyperresponsiveness and alleviate airway remodeling. Opening K(+) channels triggers K(+) efflux, which leading to membrane hyperpolarization, preventing Ca(2+)entry through closing voltage-operated Ca(2+) channels. Intracellular Ca(2+) is the most important regulator of muscle contraction, cell proliferation and migration. K(+) efflux decreases Ca(2+) influx, which consequently influences ASMCs proliferation and migration. As a KATP channel opener, iptakalim (Ipt) has been reported to restrain the proliferation of pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells (PASMCs) involved in vascular remodeling, while little is known about its impact on ASMCs. The present study was designed to investigate the effects of Ipt on human ASMCs and the mechanisms underlying. Results obtained from cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8), flow cytometry and 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine (EdU) incorporation showed that Ipt significantly inhibited platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-BB-induced ASMCs proliferation. ASMCs migration induced by PDGF-BB was also suppressed by Ipt in transwell migration and scratch assay. Besides, the phosphorylation of Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaMKII), extracellular regulated protein kinases 1/2 (ERK1/2), protein kinase B (Akt), and cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) response element binding protein (CREB) were as well alleviated by Ipt administration. Furthermore, we found that the inhibition of Ipt on the PDGF-BB-induced proliferation and migration in human ASMCs was blocked by glibenclamide (Gli), a selective KATP channel antagonist. These findings provide a strong evidence to support that Ipt antagonize the proliferating and migrating effects of PDGF-BB on human ASMCs through opening KATP channels. Altogether, our results highlighted a novel profile of Ipt as a potent option against the airway remodeling in chronic airway diseases.
Zinc may act as a neurotransmitter in the central nervous system by activation of the GPR39 metabotropic receptors.
In the present study, we investigated whether GPR39 knockout would cause depressive-like and/or anxiety-like behavior, as measured by the forced swim test, tail suspension test, and light/dark test. We also investigated whether lack of GPR39 would change levels of cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB),brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and tropomyosin related kinase B (TrkB) protein in the hippocampus and frontal cortex of GPR39 knockout mice subjected to the forced swim test, as measured by Western-blot analysis.
In this study, GPR39 knockout mice showed an increased immobility time in both the forced swim test and tail suspension test, indicating depressive-like behavior and displayed anxiety-like phenotype. GPR39 knockout mice had lower CREB and BDNF levels in the hippocampus, but not in the frontal cortex, which indicates region specificity for the impaired CREB/BDNF pathway (which is important in antidepressant response) in the absence of GPR39. There were no changes in TrkB protein in either structure. In the present study, we also investigated activity in the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis under both zinc- and GPR39-deficient conditions. Zinc-deficient mice had higher serum corticosterone levels and lower glucocorticoid receptor levels in the hippocampus and frontal cortex.
There were no changes in the GPR39 knockout mice in comparison with the wild-type control mice, which does not support a role of GPR39 in hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis regulation. The results of this study indicate the involvement of the GPR39 Zn(2+)-sensing receptor in the pathophysiology of depression with component of anxiety.
Understanding the mechanism of action of the yessotoxin (YTX) is crucial since this drug has potential pharmacological effects in allergic processes, tumor proliferation and neurodegenerative diseases. It has been described that YTX activates apoptosis after 24h of treatment, while after 48 h of incubation with the toxin a decrease in cell viability corresponding to cellular differentiation or non-apoptotic cell death was observed. In this paper, these processes were extensively studied by using the erythroleukemia K-562 cell line. On one hand, events of K-562 cell differentiation into erythrocytes after YTX treatment were studied using hemin as positive control of cell differentiation. Cell differentiation was studied through the cyclic nucleotide response element binding (phospho-CREB) and the transferrin receptor (TfR) expression. On the other hand, using rapamycin as positive control, autophagic hallmarks, as non-apoptotic cell death, were studied after toxin exposure. In this case, the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) and light chain 3B (LC3B) levels were measured to check autophagy activation. The results showed that cell differentiation was not occurring after 48 h of toxin incubation while at this time the autophagy was triggered. Furthermore after 24h of toxin treatment none of these processes were activated. In addition, the role of the type 4A phosphodiesterase (PDE4A), the intracellular target of YTX, was checked. PDE4A-silencing experiments showed different regulation steps of PDE4A in the autophagic processes triggered either by traditional compounds or YTX. In summary, after 48 h YTX treatment PDE4A-dependent autophagy, as non-apoptotic programmed cell death, is activated.
Early life nutritional intervention causes adult-onset insulin resistance and obesity in rats. Thyroid hormone receptor (TR), in turn, transcriptionally enhances skeletal muscle Glut4 expression. We tested the hypothesis that reduced circulating thyroid-stimulating hormone and T4 concentrations encountered in postnatal (PN4-PN24) high-carbohydrate (HC) milk formula-fed versus the mother-fed controls (MF) would epigenetically interfere with TR induction of adult (100 days) male rat skeletal muscle Glut4 expression, thereby providing a molecular mechanism mediating insulin resistance. We observed increased DNA methylation of the CpG island with enhanced recruitment of Dnmt3a, Dnmt3b and MeCP2 in the glut4 promoter region along with reduced acetylation of histone (H)2A.Z and H4 particularly at the H4.lysine (K)16 residue, which was predominantly mediated by histone deacetylase 4 (HDAC4). This was followed by enhanced recruitment of heterochromatin protein 1β to the glut4 promoter with increased Suv39H1 methylase concentrations. These changes reduced TR binding of the T3 response element of the glut4 gene (TREs; -473 to -450 bp) detected qualitatively in vivo (electromobility shift assay) and quantified ex vivo (chromatin immunoprecipitation). In addition, the recruitment of steroid receptor coactivator and CREB-binding protein to the glut4 promoter-protein complex was reduced. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments confirmed the interaction between TR and CBP to be reduced and HDAC4 to be enhanced in HC versus MF groups. These molecular changes were associated with diminished skeletal muscle Glut4 mRNA and protein concentrations. We conclude that early postnatal exposure to HC diet epigenetically reduced TR induction of adult male skeletal muscle Glut4 expression, uncovering novel molecular mechanisms contributing to adult insulin resistance and obesity.
We have integrated and analyzed a large number of data sets from a variety of genomic assays using a novel computational pipeline to provide a global view of estrogen receptor 1 (ESR1; a.k.a. ERα) enhancers in MCF-7 human breast cancer cells. Using this approach, we have defined a class of primary transcripts (eRNAs) that are transcribed uni- or bidirectionally from estrogen receptor binding sites (ERBSs) with an average transcription unit length of ∼3-5 kb. The majority are up-regulated by short treatments with estradiol (i.e., 10, 25, or 40 min) with kinetics that precede or match the induction of the target genes. The production of eRNAs at ERBSs is strongly correlated with the enrichment of a number of genomic features that are associated with enhancers (e.g., H3K4me1, H3K27ac, EP300/CREBBP, RNA polymerase II, open chromatin architecture), as well as enhancer looping to target gene promoters. In the absence of eRNA production, strong enrichment of these features is not observed, even though ESR1 binding is evident. We find that flavopiridol, a CDK9 inhibitor that blocks transcription elongation, inhibits eRNA production but does not affect other molecular indicators of enhancer activity, suggesting that eRNA production occurs after the assembly of active enhancers. Finally, we show that an enhancer transcription "signature" based on GRO-seq data can be used for de novo enhancer prediction across cell types. Together, our studies shed new light on the activity of ESR1 at its enhancer sites and provide new insights about enhancer function.
Proteins that contain long disordered regions are prevalent in the proteome and frequently associated with diseases. However, the mechanisms by which such intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) recognize their targets are not well understood. Here, we report the first experimental investigation of the interaction kinetics of the nuclear co-activator binding domain of CREB-binding protein and the activation domain from the p160 transcriptional co-activator for thyroid hormone and retinoid receptors. Both protein domains are intrinsically disordered in the free state and synergistically fold upon binding each other. Using the stopped-flow technique, we found that the binding reaction is fast, with an association rate constant of 3 × 10(7) m(-1) s(-1) at 277 K. Mutation of a conserved buried intermolecular salt bridge showed that electrostatics govern the rapid association. Furthermore, upon mutation of the salt bridge or at high salt concentration, an additional kinetic phase was detected (∼20 and ∼40 s(-1), respectively, at 277 K), suggesting that the salt bridge may steer formation of the productive bimolecular complex in an intramolecular step. Finally, we directly measured slow kinetics for the IDP domains (∼1 s(-1) at 277 K) related to conformational transitions upon binding. Together, the experiments demonstrate that the interaction involves several steps and accumulation of intermediate states. Our data are consistent with an induced fit mechanism, in agreement with previous simulations. We propose that the slow transitions may be a consequence of the multipartner interactions of IDPs.
Epigenetic regulation of gene expression is under normal circumstances tightly controlled by the specific methylation of cytosine residues in CpG dinucleotides and coordinated by adjustments in the histone-dependent configuration of chromatin. Following our original report, providing the first description of potential tumor suppressor function associated with the histone methyltransferase SET domain containing 2 (SETD2) in breast cancer, the objective of this study was to determine the expression profiles of 16 further histone-modifier genes in a well annotated cohort of patients with primary operable breast cancer.
Breast cancer tissues (n=127) and normal tissues (n=33) underwent RNA extraction and reverse transcription, and histone-modifier gene transcript levels were determined using real-time quantitative PCR. The histone-modifier genes included: histone acetyltransferases (cAMP response element-binding protein-binding protein (CREBBP)); class I (histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) and histone deacetylase 2 (HDAC2)), II (histone deacetylase 5 (HDAC5)) and III (sirtuin 1 (SIRT1)) histone deacetylases; and histone methyltransferases (SET domain containing suppressor of variegation 3-9 homolog 1 (SUV39H1) and suppressor of variegation 3-9 homolog 2 (SUV39H2)) amongst others. Expression levels were analysed against tumor size, grade, nodal involvement, histological subtype, receptor status, TNM stage, Nottingham Prognostic Index, and disease-free and overall survival over a 10-year follow-up period.
Expression of histone-modifier genes in breast cancer differed significantly from those in normal tissue (HDAC5, HDAC1, lysine (K)-specific demethylase 4A (KDM4A) and lysine (K)-specific demethylase 6A (KDM6A)). Differences in expression profiles were also found to exist between individual breast tumors and, in some cases, were significantly associated with conventional pathological parameters and prognostic indices: tumor grade (K (lysine) acetyltransferase 5 (KAT5), HDAC1, KDM4A, SUV39H1 and KDM6A)); TNM stage (SUV39H1, K (lysine) acetyltransferase 2B (KAT2B), lysine (K)-specific demethylase 1A (KDM1A), KDM4A, lysine (K)-specific demethylase 5C (KDM5C), K (lysine) acetyltransferase 8 (KAT8), HDAC5 and KAT5)); Nottingham Prognostic Index (KDM5C, myeloid/lymphoid or mixed-lineage leukemia (MLL), KAT8 and SET and MYND domain containing 3 (SMYD3)); receptor status (KAT5, SMYD3 and KDM1A); histological type (KAT5, KDM5C, KAT8, KDM4A and MLL); disease-free survival (SUV39H1, SMYD3, HDAC5, KDM6A, HDAC1, KDM1A, KDM4A, KAT8, KDM5C, KAT5 and MLL) and overall survival (KAT8). Significant correlations were identified between the differential expression profiles of particular histone-modifying genes.
Expression levels of histone-modifier genes in breast cancer differ significantly from normal tissue. Differences in expression profiles exist between breast tumors and are significantly associated with conventional pathological parameters and clinical outcomes. Further study is warranted to determine the consequences of altered expression for each specific histone-modifier gene and the biological and clinical implications of combinatorial variations in expression profiles. Histone-modifier enzymes offer utility as biomarkers and potential for targeted therapeutic strategies.
Cholesterol is a major component of membrane lipid rafts. It is more abundant in the brain than in other tissues and plays a critical role in maintaining brain function. We report here that a significant enhancement in apoptosis in rat cerebellar granule neurons (CGNs) was observed upon incubation with 5mM K(+) /serum free (LK-S) medium. Cholesterol enrichment further potentiated CGN apoptosis incubated under LK-S medium. On the contrary, cholesterol depletion using methyl-beta-cyclodextrin protected the CGNs from apoptosis induced by LK-S treatment. Cholesterol enrichment, however, did not induce apoptosis in CGNs that have been incubated with 25mM K(+) /serum medium. Mechanistically, increased I(K) currents and DNA fragmentation were found in CGNs incubated in LK-S, which was further potentiated in the presence of cholesterol. Cholesterol-treated CGNs also exhibited increased cAMP levels and up-regulation of Kv2.1 expression. Increased levels of activated form of PKA and phospho-CREB further supported activation of the cAMP/PKA pathway upon treatment of CGNs with cholesterol-containing LK-S medium. Conversely, inhibition of PKA or small G protein Gs abolished the increase in I(K) current and the potentiation of Kv2.1 expression, leading to reduced susceptibility of CGNs to LK-S and cholesterol-induced apoptosis. Our results demonstrate that the elevation of membrane cholesterol enhances CGN susceptibility to apoptotic stimuli via cAMP/PKA/CREB-dependent up-regulation of Kv2.1. Our data provide new evidence for the role of cholesterol in eliciting neuronal cell death.
o,p'-Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (o,p'-DDT) is a DDT isomer and xenoestrogen that can induce inflammation and cancer. However, the effect of o,p'-DDT on aromatase is unclear. Thus, we investigated the effects of o,p'-DDT on aromatase expression in human breast cancer cells. We also examined whether cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) is involved in o,p'-DDT-mediated aromatase expression. Treatment with o,p'-DDT-induced aromatase protein expression in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells; enhancing aromatase gene expression, and enzyme and promoter activity. Treatment with ICI 182.780, a estrogen receptor antagonist, did not affect the inductive effects of o,p'-DDT on aromatase expression. In addition, o,p'-DDT increased COX-2 protein levels markedly, increased COX-2 mRNA expression and promoter activity, enhanced the production of prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)), induced cyclic AMP response element (CRE) activation, and cAMP levels and binding of CREB. o,p'-DDT also increased the phosphorylation of PKA, Akt, ERK, and JNK in their signaling pathways in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells. Finally, o,p'-DDT induction of aromatase was inhibited by various inhibitors [COX-2 (by NS-398), PKA (H-89), PI3-K/Akt (LY 294002), EP2 (AH6809), and EP4 receptor (AH23848)]. Together, these results suggest that o,p'-DDT increases aromatase, and that o,p'-DDT-induced aromatase is correlated with COX-2 up-regulation, mediated via the CRE activation and PKA and PI3-kinase/Akt signaling pathways in breast cancer cells.
Chronic hepatitis B (HBV) and C (HCV) virus infections are the most important factors associated with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), but tumor prognosis remains poor due to the lack of diagnostic biomarkers. In order to identify novel diagnostic markers and therapeutic targets, the gene expression profile associated with viral and non-viral HCC was assessed in 9 tumor samples by oligo-microarrays. The differentially expressed genes were examined using a z-score and KEGG pathway for the search of ontological biological processes. We selected a non-redundant set of 15 genes with the lowest P value for clustering samples into three groups using the non-supervised algorithm k-means. Fisher's linear discriminant analysis was then applied in an exhaustive search of trios of genes that could be used to build classifiers for class distinction. Different transcriptional levels of genes were identified in HCC of different etiologies and from different HCC samples. When comparing HBV-HCC vs HCV-HCC, HBV-HCC/HCV-HCC vs non-viral (NV)-HCC, HBC-HCC vs NV-HCC, and HCV-HCC vs NV-HCC of the 58 non-redundant differentially expressed genes, only 6 genes (IKBKbeta, CREBBP, WNT10B, PRDX6, ITGAV, and IFNAR1) were found to be associated with hepatic carcinogenesis. By combining trios, classifiers could be generated, which correctly classified 100% of the samples. This expression profiling may provide a useful tool for research into the pathophysiology of HCC. A detailed understanding of how these distinct genes are involved in molecular pathways is of fundamental importance to the development of effective HCC chemoprevention and treatment.
The introduction of molecular karyotyping technologies facilitated the identification of specific genetic disorders associated with imbalances of certain genomic regions. A detailed phenotypic delineation of interstitial 16p13.3 duplications is hampered by the scarcity of such patients.
To delineate the phenotypic spectrum associated with interstitial 16p13.3 duplications, and perform a genotype-phenotype analysis.
The present report describes the genotypic and phenotypic delineation of nine submicroscopic interstitial 16p13.3 duplications. The critically duplicated region encompasses a single gene, CREBBP, which is mutated or deleted in Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome. In 10 out of the 12 hitherto described probands, the duplication arose de novo.
Interstitial 16p13.3 duplications have a recognizable phenotype, characterized by normal to moderately retarded mental development, normal growth, mild arthrogryposis, frequently small and proximally implanted thumbs and characteristic facial features. Occasionally, developmental defects of the heart, genitalia, palate or the eyes are observed. The frequent de novo occurrence of 16p13.3 duplications demonstrates the reduced reproductive fitness associated with this genotype. Inheritance of the duplication from a clinically normal parent in two cases indicates that the associated phenotype is incompletely penetrant.
Here, we characterized behavioral abnormalities induced by prolonged social isolation in adult rodents. Social isolation induced both anxiety- and anhedonia-like symptoms and decreased cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) activity in the nucleus accumbens shell (NAcSh). All of these abnormalities were reversed by chronic, but not acute, antidepressant treatment. However, although the anxiety phenotype and its reversal by antidepressant treatment were CREB-dependent, the anhedonia-like symptoms were not mediated by CREB in NAcSh. We found that decreased CREB activity in NAcSh correlated with increased expression of certain K(+) channels and reduced electrical excitability of NAcSh neurons, which was sufficient to induce anxiety-like behaviors and was reversed by chronic antidepressant treatment. Together, our results describe a model that distinguishes anxiety- and depression-like behavioral phenotypes, establish a selective role of decreased CREB activity in NAcSh in anxiety-like behavior, and provide a mechanism by which antidepressant treatment alleviates anxiety symptoms after social isolation.
Decoy receptor 3 (DcR3) is a soluble decoy receptor belonging to the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily that is overexpressed in various malignant tumor types. DcR3 has been implicated in tumor cell survival by inhibiting apoptosis and by interfering with immune surveillance. A previous study showed that DcR3 expression is associated with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-positive lymphomas but rarely with non-EBV-positive B-cell lymphomas, suggesting that the presence of EBV may affect DcR3 expression. Here, we demonstrated enhanced DcR3 expression upon EBV reactivation in P3HR1 cells and in EBV-infected 293 cells. This enhancement, however, could not be detected in 293 cells infected with EBV with BRLF1 deleted. We found that EBV transactivator, Rta, could upregulate DcR3 expression by direct binding to an Rta-responsive element (RRE) located in the DcR3 promoter region and that this RRE is important for Rta-mediated DcR3 expression. Overexpressing CREB-binding protein (CBP) further enhanced Rta-dependent DcR3 expression, suggesting Rta-dependent DcR3 transcription activity is mediated by CBP. Previously, Rta was shown to enhance phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3-K) activity. However, Rta-transduced PI 3-K activity plays a minor role in DcR3 expression. This is the first report to demonstrate that Rta upregulates a cellular gene by direct binding to an RRE.
X-linked Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy (X-EDMD) is inherited through mutations in emerin, a nuclear membrane protein. Emerin has proposed roles in nuclear architecture and gene regulation, but direct molecular links to disease were unknown. We report that Lim-domain only 7 (Lmo7) binds emerin directly with 125 nM affinity; the C-terminal half of human Lmo7 (hLmo7C) was sufficient to bind emerin in vitro. Lmo7 appeared relevant to EDMD because a deletion that removes Lmo7 (plus eight exons of a neighboring gene) in mice causes dystrophic muscles [Semenova, E., Wang, X., Jablonski, M.M., Levorse, J. and Tilghman, S.M. (2003) An engineered 800 kilobase deletion of Uchl3 and Lmo7 on mouse chromosome 14 causes defects in viability, postnatal growth and degeneration of muscle and retina. Hum. Mol. Genet., 12, 1301-1312]. Lmo7 localizes in the nucleus, cytoplasm and cell surface, particularly adhesion junctions [Ooshio, T., Irie, K., Morimoto, K., Fukuhara, A., Imai, T. and Takai, Y. (2004) Involvement of LMO7 in the association of two cell-cell adhesion molecules, nectin and E-cadherin, through afadin and alpha-actinin in epithelial cells. J. Biol. Chem., 279, 31365-31373]. Our data suggest endogenous Lmo7 is a nucleocytoplasmic shuttling protein, and might also localize at focal adhesions in HeLa cells. Two key results show that Lmo7 regulates emerin gene expression: rat Lmo7 isoforms directly activated a luciferase reporter gene in vivo, and emerin mRNA expression decreased 93% in Lmo7-downregulated HeLa cells. Thus, Lmo7 not only binds emerin protein but is also required for emerin gene transcription. Microarray analysis of Lmo7-downregulated HeLa cells identified over 4200 misregulated genes, including 46 genes important for muscle or heart. Misregulation of 11 genes, including four (CREBBP, NAP1L1, LAP2, RBL2) known to be misregulated in X-EDMD patients and emerin-null mice [Bakay, M., Wang, Z., Melcon, G., Schiltz, L., Xuan, J., Zhao, P., Sartorelli, V., Seo, J., Pegoraro, E., Angelini, C. et al. (2006) Nuclear envelope dystrophies show a transcriptional fingerprint suggesting disruption of Rb-MyoD pathways in muscle regeneration. Brain, 129, 996-1013; Melcon, G., Kozlov, S., Cutler, D.A., Sullivan, T., Hernandez, L., Zhao, P., Mitchell, S., Nader, G., Bakay, M., Rottman, J.N. et al. (2006) Loss of emerin at the nuclear envelope disrupts the Rb1/E2F and MyoD pathways during muscle regeneration. Hum. Mol. Genet., 15, 637-651] was confirmed by real-time PCR. Overexpression of wild-type emerin, but not emerin mutant P183H (which causes EDMD and selectively disrupts binding to Lmo7), decreased the expression of CREBBP, NAP1L1 and LAP2, suggesting Lmo7 activity is both EDMD-relevant and inhibited by direct binding to emerin. We conclude that Lmo7 positively regulates many EDMD-relevant genes (including emerin), and is feedback-regulated by binding to emerin.
In the present study, we analyzed human follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH)-induced cell proliferation and transactivation of estrogen-sensitive reporter genes-in L cells stably expressing the human FSH receptor [L-(hFSHR(+)) cells]. In order to dissect the signaling pathways involved in this process, L-(hFSHR(+)) cells were transiently transfected with either the 3X-ERE-TAT-Luc or the ERE-VitA2-TK-CAT reporter genes and treated with FSH or PKA activators (cholera toxin, forskolin and 8-Br-cAMP) in the presence or absence of various kinase inhibitors. We found that FSH and all PKA activators, specifically induced transactivation of both reporter genes. Transactivation of estrogen-sensitive genes by FSH or PKA activators were blocked (approximately 90%) by H89 (PKA inhibitor) and LY294002 but not by Wortmannin (PI3-K inhibitors), 4-OH-tamoxifen, ICI182,780 or SB203580 (p38 MAPK inhibitor); PD98059 (ERK1/2 inhibitor) partially (approximately 30%) blocked the FSH-mediated effect. The combination of FSH and estradiol resulted in a synergistic effect on transactivation as well as on cell proliferation, and this enhancement was attenuated by antiestrogens. We additionally analyzed the participation of the coactivators SRC-1 and cAMP response element binding protein (CREB)-binding protein (CBP) in FSH-evoked estrogen receptor (ER)-dependent transactivation; we found that CBP but not SRC-1 potentiated FSH-induced transcriptional activation of both ER-sensitive reporters, being this effect stronger on the ERE-VitA2-TK-CAT than on the 3X-ERE-TAT-Luc reporter. Thus, in L-(hFSHR(+)) cells FSH induces transcriptional activation of estrogen-sensitive genes through an A-kinase-triggered signaling pathway, using also to a lesser extent the ERK1/2 and p38 pathways. PI3-K is not apparently involved in this FSH-mediated process since LY294002, but not Wortmannin, specifically binds ERs and completely blocks estrogen action. Presumably, CBP cooperates with the ER on genes that contain estrogen responsive elements through mechanisms involving the participation of other proteins and/or basal transcription factors (e.g. CREB), which in turn mediate the transcriptional response of estrogen-sensitive reporter genes to FSH stimulation.
Kaposi's sarcoma (KS)-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) is involved in the pathogenesis of KS, primary effusion lymphoma, and multicentric Castleman's disease. K-bZIP, the protein encoded by the open reading frame K8 of KSHV, is a member of the basic region-leucine zipper family of transcription factors. We studied the mechanisms that underlie KSHV-induced oncogenesis by investigating whether K-bZIP perturbs signaling through transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta), which inhibits proliferation of a wide range of cell types. K-bZIP repressed TGF-beta-induced, Smad-mediated transcriptional activity and antagonized the growth-inhibitory effects of TGF-beta. Since both K-bZIP and Smad are known to interact with CREB-binding protein (CBP), the effect of CBP on inhibition of Smad-mediated transcriptional activation by K-bZIP was examined. K-bZIP mutants, which lacked the CBP-binding site, could not repress TGF-beta-induced or Smad3-mediated transcriptional activity. Overexpression of CBP restored K-bZIP-induced inhibition of Smad3-mediated transcriptional activity. Competitive interaction studies showed that K-bZIP inhibited the interaction of Smad3 with CBP. These results suggest that K-bZIP, through its binding to CBP, disrupts TGF-beta signaling by interfering with the recruitment of CBP into transcription initiation complexes on TGF-beta-responsive elements. We propose a possibility that K-bZIP may contribute to oncogenesis through its ability to promote cell survival by repressing TGF-beta signaling.
Experience-dependent gene transcription is required for nervous system development and function. However, the DNA regulatory elements that control this program of gene expression are not well defined. Here we characterize the enhancers that function across the genome to mediate activity-dependent transcription in mouse cortical neurons. We find that the subset of enhancers enriched for monomethylation of histone H3 Lys4 (H3K4me1) and binding of the transcriptional coactivator CREBBP (also called CBP) that shows increased acetylation of histone H3 Lys27 (H3K27ac) after membrane depolarization of cortical neurons functions to regulate activity-dependent transcription. A subset of these enhancers appears to require binding of FOS, which was previously thought to bind primarily to promoters. These findings suggest that FOS functions at enhancers to control activity-dependent gene programs that are critical for nervous system function and provide a resource of functional cis-regulatory elements that may give insight into the genetic variants that contribute to brain development and disease.
The incretins, GIP (glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide) and GLP-1 (glucagon-like peptide-1) are gastrointestinal hormones conferring a number of beneficial effects on β-cell secretion, survival and proliferation. In a previous study, it was demonstrated that delayed rectifier channel protein Kv2.1 contributes to β-cell apoptosis and that the prosurvival effects of incretins involve Kv2.1 PTMs (post-translational modifications), including phosphorylation and acetylation. Since Kv1.5 overexpression was also shown to stimulate β-cell death, the present study was initiated in order to determine whether incretins modulate Kv1.5α-Kvβ2 interaction via PTM and the mechanisms involved. GIP and GLP-1 reduced apoptosis in INS-1 β-cells (clone 832/13) overexpressing Kv1.5, and RNAi (RNA interference)-mediated knockdown of endogenous Kv1.5 attenuated apoptotic β-cell death. Both GIP and GLP-1 increased phosphorylation and acetylation of Kv1.5 and its Kvβ2 protein subunit, leading to their enhanced interaction. Further studies demonstrated that CBP [CREB (cAMP-response-element-binding protein)-binding protein]/SirT1 mediated acetylation/deacetylation and interaction between Kvβ2 and Kv1.5 in response to GIP or GLP-1. Incretin regulation of β-cell function therefore involves the acetylation of multiple Kvα and Kvβ subunits.
Vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) relaxes smooth muscle by generation of cAMP and activation of protein kinase A (PKA). However, PKA activation also phosphorylates the transcription factor CREB. The aim of this study was to investigate whether the phosphorylation of CREB induces gene expression of the pore-forming alpha(1C) subunit of Ca(v)1.2 channels (L-type calcium channels), whose promoter has 2 binding sites for CREB.
The experiments were performed on primary cultures of human colonic circular smooth muscle cells and freshly obtained human and rat colonic circular muscle strips.
The incubation of human colonic circular smooth muscle cells or muscle strips with VIP for 24 hours enhanced the expression of alpha(1C) protein and mRNA as well as the contractile response to acetylcholine and KCl. On the contrary, incubation of the muscle strips with VIP antagonist for 24 hours suppressed cell contractility. The incubation of the cells with VIP caused sustained generation of cAMP for 24 hours, but PKA activation and CREB phosphorylation were transient. The inhibition of PKA by H-89 or silencing of CREB gene with targeted RNAi blocked the transcription of alpha(1C). Progressive 5' deletions of halpha(1C)1b promoter and site-directed mutations of the 2 CREB binding cis-elements indicated that most of alpha(1C) transcription was mediated by the 5' cAMP response element.
The excitation-transcription coupling stimulated by VIP induces expression of the Ca(v)1.2 channels. The influx of calcium through these channels is a critical step in excitation-contraction coupling in smooth muscle cells.
Because activation of ERK1/2 MAP kinase (MAPK) is critical for hippocampus-dependent memory, there is considerable interest in mechanisms for regulation of MAPK during memory formation. Here we report that MAPK and CREB-mediated transcription are negatively regulated by SCOP (suprachiasmatic nucleus [SCN] circadian oscillatory protein) and that SCOP is proteolyzed by calpain when hippocampal neurons are stimulated by brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), KCl depolarization, or NMDA. Moreover, training for novel object memory decreases SCOP in the hippocampus. To determine if hippocampus-dependent memory is influenced by SCOP in vivo, we generated a transgenic mouse strain for the inducible overexpression of SCOP in the forebrain. Overexpression of SCOP completely blocked memory for novel objects. We conclude that degradation of SCOP by calpain contributes to activation of MAPK during memory formation.
Cholecystokinin (CCK) is one of the most abundant peptide transmitters in the mammalian brain. Despite the physiological significance of CCK expression in long-term memory and psychiatric disorders, little is known about the factors that regulate the expression of CCK peptides. Here, we report that KCl and forskolin synergistically increase CCK gene transcription via protein kinase A (PKA) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signalling pathways, activating cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) associated with the CRE(- 80) element of the CCK promoter. Whereas, CREB Ser133 phosphorylation was essential for transcriptional activation, the synergistic stimulation was not correlated to the level of Ser133 phosphorylation, indicating that recruitment and/or activation of additional downstream factors were required for maximal stimulation. Transcriptional activation was reduced by co-expression of adenovirus 12S E1A, that inhibits binding of CREB-binding protein (CBP) to CREB. Moreover GAL4-CREB-DIEDML, which mediates the phosphorylation-independent binding of CBP, and the C-terminal domain of CBP was synergistically activated by forskolin and KCl. Taken together the results imply that neuronal CCK gene transcription is regulated by the cumulative action of calcium and cAMP via stimulation of the PKA and ERK signalling pathways and that synergy is accomplished by the coordinate activation of CREB and CBP.
Cerebellar granule neurons undergo apoptosis when switched from medium containing depolarizing levels of potassium (high K+ medium, HK) to medium containing low K+ (LK). NF-kappaB, a ubiquitously expressed transcription factor, is involved in the survival-promoting effects of HK. However, neither the expression nor the intracellular localization of the five NF-kappaB proteins, or of IkappaB-alpha and IkappaB-beta, are altered in neurons primed to undergo apoptosis by LK, suggesting that uncommon mechanisms regulate NF-kappaB activity in granule neurons. In this study, we show that p65 interacts with the transcriptional co-activator, CREB-binding protein (CBP), in healthy neurons. The decrease in NF-kappaB transcriptional activity caused by LK treatment is accompanied by a reduction in the interaction between p65 and CBP, an alteration that is accompanied by hyperphosporylation of CBP. LK-induced CBP hyperphosphorylation can be mimicked by inhibitors of protein phosphatase (PP) 2A and PP2A-like phosphatases such as okadaic acid and cantharidin, which also causes a reduction in p65-CBP association. In addition, treatment with these inhibitors induces cell death. Treatment with high concentrations of the broad-spectrum kinase inhibitor staurosporine prevents LK-mediated CBP hyperphosphorylation and inhibits cell death. In vitro kinase assays using glutathione-S-transferase (GST)-CBP fusion proteins map the LK-regulated site of phosphorylation to a region spanning residues 1662-1840 of CBP. Our results are consistent with possibility that LK-induced apoptosis is triggered by CBP hyperphosphorylation, an alteration that causes the dissociation of CBP and NF-kappaB.
The transcription factor CREB is involved in mediating many of the long-term effects of activity-dependent plasticity at glutamatergic synapses. Here, we show that activation of NMDA receptors and voltage-sensitive calcium channels leads to CREB-mediated transcription in cortical neurons via a mechanism regulated by CREB-binding protein (CBP). Recruitment of CBP to the promoter is not sufficient for transactivation, but calcium influx can induce CBP-mediated transcription via two distinct transactivation domains. CBP-mediated transcription is stimulus strength-dependent and can be induced by activation of CaM kinase II, CaM kinase IV, and protein kinase A, but not by activation of the Ras-MAP kinase pathway. These observations indicate that CBP can function as a calcium-sensitive transcriptional coactivator that may act as a regulatory switch for glutamate-induced CREB-mediated transcription.
The suprachiasmatic nucleus of the hypothalamus (SCN) is the master clock that regulates circadian and seasonal rhythms. Among these, the SCN regulates the phasic release of hormones and provides for the timing of the preovulatory luteinizing hormone (LH) surge necessary for ovulation in females. There is little evidence, however, of sex hormone effects on mechanisms underlying SCN function. This study examined the effects of exogenous administration of estradiol on the light-induced expression of transcription factors in the SCN of female rats. Ovariectomized (OVX) female rats were given estradiol or cholesterol implants and perfused 48 h later. Half of the animals were sacrificed 1 h after the regular onset of light within the colony. The rest had the lights go on 2 h prior to the regular time and perfused 1 h later. Collected brains were sliced and sets of SCN sections were processed for immunoreactivity (ir) detecting the Fos, pCREB, egr-1, CREB binding protein (CBP), and calbindin-D (28K) proteins. Following quantification, statistical analyses demonstrated that estradiol enhanced Fos and p-CREB-ir in the SCN of females that experienced a 2-h phase advance. The phase advance also enhanced calbindin and egr-1-ir, but the expression of these proteins was not affected by estradiol. These results demonstrate that estradiol enhances the levels of transcription factors that precede the expression of clock gene proteins in the SCN in response to advances in the onset of environmental light. These data support the hypothesis that steroid hormones play an important role in the fine tuning of the clock in the face of environmental changes in daylight.
Preanalytical variables account for most of laboratory errors. There is a wide range of factors that affect the reliability of laboratory report. Most convenient sample type for routine laboratory analysis is serum. BD Vacutainer(®) Rapid Serum Tube (RST) (Becton, Dickinson and Company, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) blood collection tube provides rapid clotting time allowing fast serum separation. Our aim was to evaluate the comparability of routine chemistry parameters in BD Vacutainer(®) RST blood collection tube in reference with the BD Vacutainer(®) Serum Separating Tubes II Advance Tube (SST) (Becton, Dickinson and Company, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA).
Blood specimens were collected from 90 participants for evaluation on its results, clotting time and stability study of six routine biochemistry parameters: glucose (Glu), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), calcium (Ca), lactate dehidrogenase (LD) and potassium (K) measured with Olympus AU2700 analyzer (Beckman Coulter, Tokyo, Japan). The significance of the differences between samples was assessed by paired t-test or Wilcoxon Matched-Pairs Rank test after checking for normality.
Clotting process was significantly shorter in the RSTs compared to SSTs (2.49 min vs. 19.47 min, respectively; P &lt; 0.001). There was a statistically significant difference between the RST and SST II tubes for glucose, calcium and LD (P &lt; 0.001). Differences for glucose and LD were also clinically significant. Analyte stability studies showed that all analytes were stable for 24 h at 4 °C.
Most results (except LD and glucose) from RST are comparable with those from SST. In addition, RST tube provides shorter clotting time.
Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome (RSTS) is a multiple congenital anomalies-intellectual disability syndrome. One of the complications is keloid formation. Keloids are proliferative fibrous growths resulting from excessive tissue response to skin trauma.
To describe the clinical characteristics of keloids in individuals with RSTS reported in the literature and in a cohort of personally evaluated individuals with RSTS.
We performed a literature search for descriptions of RSTS individuals with keloids. All known individuals with RSTS in the Netherlands filled out three dedicated questionnaires. All individuals with (possible) keloids were personally evaluated. A further series of individuals with RSTS from the U.K. was personally evaluated.
Reliable data were available for 62 of the 83 Dutch individuals with RSTS and showed 15 individuals with RSTS (24%) to have keloids. The 15 Dutch and 12 U.K. individuals with RSTS with keloids demonstrated that most patients have multiple keloids (n &gt; 1: 82%; n &gt; 5: 30%). Mean age of onset is 11·9 years. The majority of keloids are located on the shoulders and chest. The mean length × width of the largest keloid was 7·1 × 2·8 cm, and the mean thickness was 0·7 cm. All affected individuals complained of itching. Generally, treatment results were disappointing.
Keloids occur in 24% of individuals with RSTS, either spontaneously or after a minor trauma, usually starting in early puberty. Management schedules have disappointing results. RSTS is a Mendelian disorder with a known molecular basis, and offers excellent opportunities to study the pathogenesis of keloids in general and to search for possible treatments.
The purpose of this study was to investigate variations in IncF plasmids and the genetic environments of bla(CTX-M-15) in CTX-M-15-producing Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates from South Korea.
A total of 56 E. coli and 15 K. pneumoniae isolates, which were previously characterized for CTX-M-15 production, sequence type by multilocus sequence typing and replicon type, were included in this study. Replicon sequence typing for IncF plasmids was performed and the genetic environments of bla(CTX-M-15) were determined using PCR and sequencing.
A total of 34 and 10 IncF-replicon sequence types (RSTs) were identified among the E. coli and K. pneumoniae isolates, respectively. Only eight and four IncF-RSTs were found in multiple isolates of E. coli and K. pneumoniae, respectively. No common IncF-RSTs were found between E. coli and K. pneumoniae isolates. Five and three different bla(CTX-M-15) genetic environments were identified in E. coli and K. pneumoniae isolates, respectively. Even in the same E. coli clone, diverse IncF-RSTs and bla(CTX-M-15) genetic environments were identified.
Diverse IncF plasmids have incorporated into diverse strains of E. coli and K. pneumoniae, contributing to the spread of the CTX-M-15 extended-spectrum β-lactamase in South Korea. It can also be inferred that bla(CTX-M-15) has not been transferred directly from E. coli to K. pneumoniae.
Most of the Borrelia burgdorferi genotypes have been isolated from erythema migrans (EM) skin lesions in patients with Lyme disease. OspC type K strains, which are 16S-23S ribosomal RNA intergenic spacer type 2 (RST2) strains, are most commonly recovered, but a higher percentage of OspC type A strains (RST1), the next most commonly recovered type, is detectable in blood. The goal of this study was to determine the B burgdorferi genotypes in the joints of patients with Lyme arthritis.
Joint fluid samples from 124 patients seen over a 30-year period were analyzed for OspC types by semi-nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sequencing, and for RSTs by nested PCR and restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. These results were correlated with clinical outcome.
OspC and RST genotypes were identified in 49 of the 124 joint fluid samples (40%). In these 49 samples, OspC type K strains (RST2) were identified in 21 samples (43%), OspC type A strains (RST1) were identified in 11 samples (22%), and 8 other OspC types and all 3 RSTs were identified among the remaining 17 samples (35%). However, among the 17 patients who had been treated with antibiotics according to current guidelines, all 7 patients who were infected with RST1 strains had antibiotic-refractory arthritis, compared with 4 of 6 patients infected with RST2 strains and only 1 of 4 infected with RST3 strains (P = 0.03).
Most of the B burgdorferi genotypes, particularly OspC type K (RST2), were identified in the joint fluid of patients with Lyme arthritis, and the genotype frequencies found in joints reflected those in EM skin lesions. However, RST1 strains were most frequent in patients with antibiotic-refractory arthritis. Our results help to further the understanding of the differential pathogenicity of strains of B burgdorferi.
The purpose of this study was to analyze the results of treatment of retroperitoneal soft tissue sarcomas (RSTS) by surgery combined with intraoperative brachytherapy (IOBRT).
Seventy adult patients with RSTS were considered for combined treatment (surgery plus IOBRT) between June 1998 and February 2004. There were 64 (91%) recurrent tumors, and 93% of tumors exceeded 5 cm. IOBRT was performed with high-dose-rate Gammamed 12 with iridium 192 (IOBRT time range, 20-87 minutes; median, 56 minutes).
After intraoperative re-evaluation, 24 patients (34%) were found to be ineligible for IOBRT because of multiple intraperitoneal recurrences, macroscopically nonradical resection, poor general condition, and technical aspects. Thirty-seven patients underwent IOBRT immediately after surgery during the same general anesthesia procedure. Nine patients underwent delayed IOBRT within 1 to 3 days after the primary operation. Ten (21.5%) of 46 patients underwent reoperation because of surgical complications. One patient died in the postoperative period. After IOBRT, 24 patients (52%) underwent adjuvant external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) to a total dose of 50 Gy. Over a median follow-up time of 20 months, the estimated 5-year overall survival and local recurrence-free survival rates in IOBRT patients were 55% and 51%, respectively. Application of adjuvant EBRT showed a favorable local control rate.
The scheduled combined treatment (surgery plus IOBRT) was possible to perform in 66% of RSTS cases that received surgical treatment. The complication rate was high, but we consider it acceptable because of the necessity for extensive aggressive surgical treatment in regionally advanced RSTS. EBRT seems to be an indispensable part of treatment that provides better local control.
We identified putative long terminal repeat- (LTR) retrotransposon sequences among the 50,000 random sequence tags (RSTs) obtained by the Génolevures project from genomic libraries of 13 Hemiascomycetes species. In most cases additional sequencing enabled us to assemble the whole sequences of these retrotransposons. These approaches identified 17 distinct families, 10 of which are defined by full-length elements. We also identified five families of solo LTRs that were not associated with retrotransposons. Ty1-like retrotransposons were found in four of five species that are phylogenetically related to Saccharomyces cerevisiae (S. uvarum, S. exiguus, S. servazzii, and S. kluyveri but not Zygosaccharomyces rouxii), and in two of three Kluyveromyces species (K. lactis and K. marxianus but not K. thermotolerans). Only multiply crippled elements could be identified in the K. lactis and S. servazzii strains analyzed, and only solo LTRs could be identified in S. uvarum. Ty4-like elements were only detected in S. uvarum, indicating that these elements appeared recently before speciation of the Saccharomyces sensu stricto species. Ty5-like elements were detected in S. exiguus, Pichia angusta, and Debaryomyces hansenii. A retrotransposon homologous with Tca2 from Candida albicans, an element absent from S. cerevisiae, was detected in the closely related species D. hansenii. A complete Ty3/gypsy element was present in S. exiguus, whereas only partial, often degenerate, sequences resembling this element were found in S. servazzii, Z. rouxii, S. kluyveri, C. tropicalis, and Yarrowica lipolytica. P. farinosa (syn. P. sorbitophila) is currently the only yeast species in which no LTR retrotransposons or remnants have been found. Thorough analysis of protein sequences, structural characteristics of the elements, and phylogenetic relationships deduced from these data allowed us to propose a classification for the Ty1/copia elements of hemiascomycetous yeasts and a model of LTR-retrotransposon evolution in yeasts.
A genomic exploration of Kluyveromyces thermotolerans was performed by random sequence tag (RST) analysis. We sequenced 2653 RSTs corresponding to inserts sequenced from both ends. We performed a systematic comparison with a complete set of proteins from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, other completely sequenced genomes and SwissProt. We identified six mitochondrial genes and 1358-1496 nuclear genes by comparison with S. cerevisiae. In addition, 25 genes were identified by comparison with other organisms. This corresponds to about 24% of the estimated gene content of this organism. A lower level of conservation is observed with orthologues to genes of S. cerevisiae previously classified as orphans. Gene order was found to be conserved between S. cerevisiae and K. thermotolerans in 56.5% of studied cases.
Outward-rectifying K+ channels are modulated in response to environmental stimuli by a range of intracellular factors, such as cytoplasmic Ca2+, pH, kinases and phosphatases. Here we report that voltage-dependent outward-rectifying K+ channels in tomato cells are also targets for modulation by 14-3-3 proteins. In whole-cell patch-clamp experiments, recombinant 14-3-3 protein (tomato isoform TFT7) was introduced into tomato cell protoplasts via the patch pipette. As a result the steady-state outward K+ current increased twofold and this increase was not dependent upon the presence of cytoplasmic ATP. A phosphorylated peptide that contained a phosphorylated 14-3-3 target-binding motif (RSTS*TP), derived from nitrate reductase, blocked the effect of 14-3-3, thus showing the specific nature of 14-3-3 action. Kinetic parameters of the conductance, like (de)activation kinetics, voltage dependence of gating and activation potential, were not significantly different between control and 14-3-3 infused cells. Analysis of single-channel activity and whole-cell noise indicated that the single-channel conductance was not affected by 14-3-3 infusion. We conclude that 14-3-3 proteins recruit 'sleepy' channels into a voltage-activatable state. The molecular mechanism underlying the 1 : 1 ratio of constitutively active and 14-3-3 recruited channels is discussed in the light of known functions of 14-3-3 dimers.
The genome of the yeast Kluyveromyces lactis was explored by sequencing 588 short tags from two random genomic libraries (random sequenced tags, or RSTs), representing altogether 1.3% of the K. lactis genome. After systematic translation of the RSTs in all six possible frames and comparison with the complete set of proteins predicted from the Saccharomyces cerevisiae genomic sequence using an internally standardized threshold, 296 K.lactis genes were identified of which 292 are new. This corresponds to approximately 5% of the estimated genes of this organism and triples the total number of identified genes in this species. Of the novel K.lactis genes, 169 (58%) are homologous to S.cerevisiae genes of known or assigned functions, allowing tentative functional assignment, but 59 others (20%) correspond to S.cerevisiae genes of unknown function and previously without homolog among all completely sequenced genomes. Interestingly, a lower degree of sequence conservation is observed in this latter class. In nearly all instances in which the novel K.lactis genes have homologs in different species, sequence conservation is higher with their S.cerevisiae counterparts than with any of the other organisms examined. Conserved gene order relationships (synteny) between the two yeast species are also observed for half of the cases studied.
Understanding dynamic, patient-level transcriptomic response to therapy is an important step forward for precision medicine. However, conventional transcriptome analysis aims to discover cohort-level change, lacking the capacity to unveil patient-specific response to therapy. To address this gap, we previously developed two N-of-1-pathways methods, Wilcoxon and Mahalanobis distance, to detect unidirectionally responsive transcripts within a pathway using a pair of samples from a single subject. Yet, these methods cannot recognize bidirectionally (up and down) responsive pathways. Further, our previous approaches have not been assessed in presence of background noise and are not designed to identify differentially expressed mRNAs between two samples of a patient taken in different contexts (e.g. cancer vs non cancer), which we termed responsive transcripts (RTs).
We propose a new N-of-1-pathways method, k-Means Enrichment (kMEn), that detects bidirectionally responsive pathways, despite background noise, using a pair of transcriptomes from a single patient. kMEn identifies transcripts responsive to the stimulus through k-means clustering and then tests for an over-representation of the responsive genes within each pathway. The pathways identified by kMEn are mechanistically interpretable pathways significantly responding to a stimulus.
In ∼9000 simulations varying six parameters, superior performance of kMEn over previous single-subject methods is evident by: (i) improved precision-recall at various levels of bidirectional response and (ii) lower rates of false positives (1-specificity) when more than 10% of genes in the genome are differentially expressed (background noise). In a clinical proof-of-concept, personal treatment-specific pathways identified by kMEn correlate with therapeutic response (p-value&lt;0.01).
Through improved single-subject transcriptome dynamics of bidirectionally-regulated signals, kMEn provides a novel approach to identify mechanism-level biomarkers.
We investigate the hopping conduction and random telegraph signal caused by various species of interface charge scatterers in a MoS2 multilayer field-effect transistor. The temperature dependence of the channel resistivity shows that at low temperatures and low carrier densities the carrier transport is via Mott variable range hopping with a hopping length changing from 41 to 80 nm. The hopping conduction was due to electron tunneling through localized band tail states formed by the scatterers located in the vicinity of the MoS2 layer. In the temperature range of 40-70 K, we observed random telegraph signal (RTS) that is caused by the capture and emission of a carrier by the interface traps that are located away from the layer. These traps form strong potential that interact with the layer and change the potential profile of the electron system. The characteristics of RTS depend strongly on gate bias and temperature, as well as the application of a magnetic field.
A number of nucleic acid aptamers with high affinities to human immunodeficiency virus reverse transcriptase (HIV-1 RT) are currently known. They can potentially be developed as broad-spectrum antiviral drugs, but there is little known about their binding interaction with mutant HIV-1 RT. Therefore, we utilized non-equilibrium capillary electrophoresis of equilibrium mixture (NECEEM) to study the interaction of three HIV-1 RTs (wild type, K103N, and double mutant (K103N/Y181C)) with RT1t49 and RT12 aptamers. This approach was used to study and evaluate the K d values of these molecules. The results showed that the K d values of the tested aptamers were lower than that of the DNA substrate. The results also pointed out that RT1t49 could bind with all HIV-1 RTs and compete with the DNA substrate at the active site. Moreover, we studied the binding stoichiometry of HIV-1 RT using aptamers as probes. The findings showed evidence of two binding stoichiometries with HIV-1 RT and the RT12 aptamer but only one binding stoichiometry for RT1t49. In addition, RT1t49 could bind specifically with the wild-type, K103N, and double mutants in Escherichia coli lysate. This result also indicated that the aptamer could detect HIV-1 RT in the presence of E. coli lysate.
The analysis of highly polar and amphoteric compounds in seawater is a continuing challenge in analytical chemistry due to the possible formation of complexes with the metal cations present in salt-based matrices. Here we provide information for the development of analytical methods for glyphosate, glufosinate, AMPA, and 2-AEP in salt water, based on studies of the effects of salt matrices on reversed-phase liquid chromatography-heated electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry (RP-LC-HESI-MS/MS) after derivatization of the target compounds with FMOC-Cl. The results showed that glyphosate was the only analyte with a strong tendency to form glyphosate-metal complexes (GMC), which clearly influenced the analysis. The retention times (RTs) of GMC and free glyphosate differed by approximately 7.00min, reflecting their distinct RP-LC behaviors. Divalent cations, but not monovalent (Na(+), K(+)) or trivalent (Al(3+), Fe(3+)) cations, contributed to this effect and their influence was concentration-dependent. In addition, Cu(2+), Co(2+), Zn(2+), and Mn(2+) prevented glyphosate detection whereas Ca(2+), Mg(2+), and Sr(2+) altered the retention time. At certain tested concentrations of Ca(2+) and Sr(2+) glyphosate yielded two peaks, which violated the fundamental rule of LC, that under the same analytical conditions a single substance yields only one LC-peak with a specific RT. Salt-matrix-induced ion suppression was observed for all analytes, especially under high salt concentrations. For glyphosate and AMPA, the use of isotopically labeled internal standards well-corrected the salt-matrix effects, with better results achieved for glufosinate and 2-AEP with the AMPA internal standard than with the glyphosate internal standard. Thus, our study demonstrated that Ca(2+), Mg(2+), and Sr(2+) can be used together with FMOC-Cl to form GMC-FMOC which is suitable for RP-LC-HESI-MS/MS analysis.
Malaria remains a major global public health concern, especially in sub-Saharan Africa. The RTS,S/AS01 malaria candidate vaccine was reviewed by the European Medicines Agency and received a positive scientific opinion; WHO subsequently recommended pilot implementation in sub-Saharan African countries. Because malaria and HIV overlap geographically, HIV-infected children should be considered for RTS,S/AS01 vaccination. We therefore aimed to assess the safety of RTS,S/AS01 in HIV-infected children at two sites in western Kenya.
We did a randomised, double-blind, controlled trial at the clinical trial sites of the Kenya Medical Research Institute (KEMRI)-Walter Reed Army Institute of research in Kisumu and the KEMRI/US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Siaya. Eligible participants were infants and children aged from 6 weeks to 17 months with WHO stage 1 or 2 HIV disease (documented positive by DNA PCR), whether or not they were receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART). We randomly assigned participants (1:1) to receive three doses of either RTS,S/AS01 or rabies vaccine (both 0·5 mL per dose by intramuscular injection), given once per month at 0, 1, and 2 months. We did the treatment allocation using a web-based central randomisation system stratified by age (6 weeks-4 months, 5-17 months), and by baseline CD4% (&lt;10, 10-14, 15-19, and ≥20). Data were obtained in an observer-blind manner, and the vaccine recipient, their parent or carer, the funder, and investigators responsible for the assessment of endpoints were all masked to treatment allocation (only staff responsible for the preparation and administration of the vaccines were aware of the assignment and these individuals played no other role in the study). We provided ART, even if the participants were not receiving ART before the study, and daily co-trimoxazole for prevention of opportunistic infections. The primary outcome was the occurrence of serious adverse events until 14 months after dose 1 of the vaccine, assessed in the intention-to-treat population. This trial was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01148459.
Between July 30, 2010, and May 24, 2013, we enrolled 200 children to our study and randomly assigned 99 to receive RTS,S/AS01 and 101 to receive rabies vaccine. 177 (89%) of the 200 children enrolled completed 14 months of follow-up. Serious adverse events were noted in 41 (41·4%, 95% CI 31·6-51·8) of 99 RTS,S/AS01 recipients and 37 (36·6%, 27·3-46·8) of 101 rabies-vaccine recipients (relative risk 1·1, 95% CI 0·8-1·6). 20 (20·2%, 95% CI 12·8-29·5) of 99 RTS,S/AS01 recipients and 12 (11·9%, 6·3-19·8) of 101 rabies-vaccine recipients had at least one serious adverse event within 30 days after vaccination, mainly pneumonia, febrile convulsions, and salmonella sepsis. Five (5·1%, 95% CI 1·7-11·4) of 99 RTS,S/AS01 recipients and four (4·0%, 1·1-9·8) of 101 rabies-vaccine recipients died, but no deaths were deemed related to vaccination. Mortality was associated with five cases of pneumonia (1% RTS,S/AS01 recipients vs 3% rabies-vaccine recipients), five cases of gastroenteritis (3% RTS,S/AS01 recipients vs 2% rabies-vaccine recipients), five cases of malnutrition (2% RTS,S/AS01 recipients vs 3% rabies-vaccine recipients), one case of sepsis (1% rabies-vaccine recipients), one case of Haemophilus influenza meningitis (1% rabies-vaccine recipients), and one case of tuberculosis (1% RTS,S/AS01 recipients).
RTS, S/AS01 was well tolerated when given to children with WHO clinical stage 1 or 2 HIV disease along with high antiretroviral and co-trimoxazole use. Children with HIV disease could be included in future RTS,S/AS01 vaccination programmes.

The candidate malaria vaccine RTS,S/AS01 is being evaluated in order to inform a decision regarding its inclusion in routine vaccination schedules.
We conducted 7 years of follow-up in children who had been randomly assigned, at 5 to 17 months of age, to receive three doses of either the RTS,S/AS01 vaccine or a rabies (control) vaccine. The end point was clinical malaria (temperature of ≥37.5°C and infection with Plasmodium falciparum of &gt;2500 parasites per cubic millimeter). In an analysis that was not prespecified, the malaria exposure of each child was estimated with the use of information on the prevalence of malaria among residents within a 1-km radius of the child's home. Vaccine efficacy was defined as 1 minus the hazard ratio or the incidence-rate ratio, multiplied by 100, in the RTS,S/AS01 group versus the control group.
Over 7 years of follow-up, we identified 1002 episodes of clinical malaria among 223 children randomly assigned to the RTS,S/AS01 group and 992 episodes among 224 children randomly assigned to the control group. The vaccine efficacy, as assessed by negative binomial regression, was 4.4% (95% confidence interval [CI], -17.0 to 21.9; P=0.66) in the intention-to-treat analysis and 7.0% (95% CI, -14.5 to 24.6; P=0.52) in the per-protocol analysis. Vaccine efficacy waned over time (P=0.006 for the interaction between vaccination and time), including negative efficacy during the fifth year among children with higher-than-average exposure to malaria parasites (intention-to-treat analysis: -43.5%; 95% CI, -100.3 to -2.8 [P=0.03]; per-protocol analysis: -56.8%; 95% CI, -118.7 to -12.3 [P=0.008]).
A three-dose vaccination with RTS,S/AS01 was initially protective against clinical malaria, but this result was offset by rebound in later years in areas with higher-than-average exposure to malaria parasites.

Growth of the elderly population is linked to the increase of comorbid conditions such as chronic kidney disease (CKD), depression, and cognitive impairment (CI). Cognitive impairment can vary from minimal deficits in the normal aging, to mild cognitive impairment with a prevalence ranging from 1 to 29 % in people ≥ 65 years of age, up to severe impairment with a prevalence of 6 to 42 %. The CI induced by depression usually affects the functional performance of the elderly.
The objective of the study is to describe the prevalence of CI and depression in patients ≥ 55 years with CKD stages 3 and 4, attending a secondary prevention program during 2012-2013.
The design of the study is a cross-sectional study of simple random sampling, and 308 patients were invited to participate.
Patients were being treated in a CKD secondary prevention program in Bogotá, Colombia, during 2012-2013.
Participants were over 54 years diagnosed with CKD in stages 3 to 4 according to the K/DOQI classification.
CI was assessed using NEUROPSI and modified Lawton Scale; depression was measured with Yesavage Geriatric Depression Scale and the MINI International Neuropsychiatric Interview.
Through an interview with the subjects, information regarding age, occupation, civil status, educational level, and clinical baseline variables was collected. Clinical assessment with specific instruments was performed by a multidisciplinary team composed of nephrologists, a psychiatrist, a neurologist, and a neuropsychologist.
Two hundred and fifty-one patients agreed to participate. The average age was 76.3 (SD = 7.9) years, 67 % were males, and 86.5 % had CKD stage 3. Overall prevalence of CI was 51 % (95 % CI 44.7 to 57.2), and the prevalence of major depression reached 8 % (95 % CI 4.5 to 11.3); 4.8 % of the patients (n = 12) had both CI and depression.
A limitation of the study is its design, which does not allow establishing the direction of the association between predictors and outcomes. Suggested associations must be interpreted cautiously as they are generated as hypothesis, which should be investigated in properly designed trials.
CI and depression are prevalent conditions among patients with CKD stages 3-4, with the greatest occurrence of CI, affecting half of the investigated Colombian patients with age ≥ 55 years.
On a constaté un lien entre la croissance de la population âgée et l’augmentation de pathologies comorbides telles que les maladies rénales chroniques et la dépression ou un trouble cognitif. Ce dernier peut varier de la déficience légère observée lors du vieillissement normal à un trouble cognitif léger, dont la prévalence s’étend de 1 à 29 % chez les gens âgés de plus de 65 ans, jusqu’à une déficience grave dont la prévalence se situe entre 6 et 42 %. Le trouble cognitif provoqué par la dépression a des répercussions sur les performances fonctionnelles des personnes âgées.
Cette étude avait pour but de qualifier la prévalence d’un trouble cognitif et de la dépression chez les patients âgés de plus de 55 ans atteints d’insuffisance rénale chronique (IRC) de stade 3 ou de stade 4, et engagés dans un programme de prévention secondaire en 2012 et 2013.
Il s’agit d’une étude transversale où on a utilisé un échantillonnage aléatoire simple et à laquelle 308 patients ont été invités à participer.
L’étude a porté sur des cas de patients provenant d’un programme de prévention secondaire à Bogota, en Colombie. Les participants étaient tous âgés de plus de 54 ans et avaient reçu un diagnostic d’IRC de stade 3 ou de stade 4 conformément au classement de la KDOQI (Kidney Disease Outcome Quality Initiative).
Le trouble cognitif a été mesuré à l’aide de l’évaluation neuropsychologique NEUROPSI et d’une échelle de Lawton modifiée. La dépression a été diagnostiquée en utilisant l’échelle de dépression gériatrique de Yesavage et le questionnaire MINI (Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview).
Les renseignements personnels des participants tels que l’âge, la profession, l’état civil, le niveau de scolarité et les paramètres cliniques initiaux des participants ont été recueillis par le biais d’entrevues. L’évaluation clinique, effectuée à l’aide d’instruments spécifiques, est le fruit de la collaboration d’une équipe multidisciplinaire composée de néphrologues, d’un psychiatre, d’un neurologue et d’un neuropsychologue.
En tout, 251 patients ont accepté de participer à l’étude. Les hommes constituaient 67 % de la cohorte, l’âge médian se situait à 76,3 ans avec un écart-type de 7,9 ans et 85 % des participants souffraient d’IRC de stade 3. La prévalence globale d’un trouble cognitif était de 51 % (IC à 95 % entre 44,7 et 57,2) et la prévalence de dépression majeure se situait à 8 % (IC à 95 % entre 4,5 et 11,3). De plus, 4,8 % des participants (n = 12) présentaient à la fois un trouble cognitif et une forme de dépression.
La méthodologie de cette étude en limite la portée puisqu’elle ne permet pas d’établir la nature de l’association entre les indicateurs prévisionnels et les résultats. Ainsi, les liens potentiels devraient être interprétés avec prudence. Ils sont générés à titre d’hypothèses et devraient faire l’objet d’études ultérieures menées dans le cadre d’essais bien conçus.
La dépression et les troubles cognitifs sont des affections prévalentes chez les patients souffrant d’IRC de stade 3 et de stade 4. Les troubles cognitifs se sont avérés très fréquents, affectant la moitié des patients Colombiens de plus de 55 ans ayant fait l’objet de cette étude.
Anatomy-based injury severity scores are commonly used with physiological scores for reporting severity of injury in a standardized manner. However, there is lack of consensus on choice of scoring system, with the commonly used injury severity score (ISS) performing poorly for certain sub-groups, eg head-injured patients. We hypothesized that adding a dichotomous variable for polytrauma (yes/no for Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) scores of 3 or more in at least two body regions) to the New Injury Severity Score (NISS) would improve the prediction of in-hospital mortality in injured patients, including head-injured patients-a subgroup that has a disproportionately high mortality. Our secondary hypothesis was that the ISS over-estimates the risk of death in polytrauma patients, while the NISS under-estimates it.
Univariate and multivariable analysis was performed on retrospective cohort data of blunt injured patients aged 18 and over with an ISS over 9 from the Singapore National Trauma Registry from 2011-2013. Model diagnostics were tested using discrimination (c-statistic) and calibration (Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit statistic). All models included age, gender, and comorbidities.
Our results showed that the polytrauma and NISS model outperformed the other models (polytrauma and ISS, NISS alone or ISS alone) in predicting 30-day and in-hospital mortality. The NISS underestimated the risk of death for patients with polytrauma, while the ISS overestimated the risk of death for these patients. When used together with the NISS and polytrauma, categorical variables for deranged physiology (systolic blood pressure of 90 mmHg or less, GCS of 8 or less) outperformed the traditional 'ISS and RTS (Revised Trauma Score)' model, with a c-statistic of greater than 0.90. This could be useful in cases when the RTS cannot be scored due to missing respiratory rate.
The NISS and polytrauma model is superior to current scores for prediction of 30-day and in-hospital mortality. We propose that this score replace the ISS or NISS in institutions using AIS-based scores.
Adding polytrauma to the NISS or ISS improves prediction of 30-day mortality. The superiority of the NISS or ISS depends on the proportion of polytrauma and head-injured patients in the study population.
Previous studies have provided evidence that updating, inhibiting, and shifting abilities underlying executive control determine response time (RT) in language production. However, little is known about their electrophysiological basis and dynamics. In the present electroencephalography study, we assessed noun-phrase production using picture description and a picture-word interference paradigm. We measured picture description RTs to assess length, distractor, and switch effects, which have been related to the updating, inhibiting, and shifting abilities. In addition, we measured event-related brain potentials (ERPs). Previous research has suggested that inhibiting and shifting are associated with anterior and posterior N200 subcomponents, respectively, and updating with the P300. We obtained length, distractor, and switch effects in the RTs, and an interaction between length and switch. There was a widely distributed switch effect in the N200, an interaction of length and midline site in the N200, and a length effect in the P300, whereas distractor did not yield any ERP modulation. Moreover, length and switch interacted in the posterior N200. We argue that these results provide electrophysiological evidence that inhibiting and shifting of task set occur before updating in phrase planning.
Rapid tests (RTs) might have several advantages over standard laboratory procedures, increasing access to diagnosis, especially among vulnerable populations and/or those living in remote areas. The aim of this study was to evaluate the performance of RTs for the detection of hepatitis B virus surface antigen (HBsAg) in samples from different populations/settings.
Three RTs for HBsAg detection (Vikia® HBsAg, HBsAg Teste Rápido®, and Imuno-Rápido HBsAg®) and different biological specimens (serum, whole blood, and saliva) were evaluated. Analyses comprised a reference panel and samples from field studies targeting suspected cases of hepatitis B virus (HBV) (G I), individuals living in deprived areas (G II), and highly vulnerable individuals (G III). Enzyme immunoassay (EIA) was defined as the gold standard in this study. Reproducibility, repeatability, and cross-reactivity with other infectious agents such as dengue, immunodeficiency (HIV), and hepatitis C (HCV) viruses and T. pallidum were determined.
For the reference panel, the sensitivity and specificity of all HBsAg RTs were higher than 93.00 %. G I presented the highest kappa values for all rapid assays using sera samples. When using serum, the sensitivity values were higher than 93.40 for G I, 60.00 % for G II and 66.77 % for G III, and the specificity values were higher than 99.50 for GI, 97.20 for G II and 99.10 % for G III for all tests. For whole blood samples &amp; the Vikia® HBsAg assay, the best performance was achieved for GIII (k = 79.75 %). For saliva samples, the Imuno-Rápido HBsAg® assay showed the highest concordance values with EIA for G I (40.68 %) and G II (32.20 %). The reproducibility and repeatability of all RTs for serum and saliva were excellent, and the concordance between HBsAg EIAs and RTs using samples reactive with other infectious agents varied from 70.10 % to 100.00 %.
The overall performance of RTs for HBsAg in serum was high/moderately high for all groups, thereby promoting increased access to HBV diagnosis among vulnerable populations as well as samples from individuals in emergency settings or remote areas. Rapid tests for HBsAg using whole blood could be used in prevalence studies, though these assays should not be used for saliva samples.
The RTS,S/AS01 vaccine targets the circumsporozoite protein of Plasmodium falciparum and has partial protective efficacy against clinical and severe malaria disease in infants and children. We investigated whether the vaccine efficacy was specific to certain parasite genotypes at the circumsporozoite protein locus.
We used polymerase chain reaction-based next-generation sequencing of DNA extracted from samples from 4985 participants to survey circumsporozoite protein polymorphisms. We evaluated the effect that polymorphic positions and haplotypic regions within the circumsporozoite protein had on vaccine efficacy against first episodes of clinical malaria within 1 year after vaccination.
In the per-protocol group of 4577 RTS,S/AS01-vaccinated participants and 2335 control-vaccinated participants who were 5 to 17 months of age, the 1-year cumulative vaccine efficacy was 50.3% (95% confidence interval [CI], 34.6 to 62.3) against clinical malaria in which parasites matched the vaccine in the entire circumsporozoite protein C-terminal (139 infections), as compared with 33.4% (95% CI, 29.3 to 37.2) against mismatched malaria (1951 infections) (P=0.04 for differential vaccine efficacy). The vaccine efficacy based on the hazard ratio was 62.7% (95% CI, 51.6 to 71.3) against matched infections versus 54.2% (95% CI, 49.9 to 58.1) against mismatched infections (P=0.06). In the group of infants 6 to 12 weeks of age, there was no evidence of differential allele-specific vaccine efficacy.
These results suggest that among children 5 to 17 months of age, the RTS,S vaccine has greater activity against malaria parasites with the matched circumsporozoite protein allele than against mismatched malaria. The overall vaccine efficacy in this age category will depend on the proportion of matched alleles in the local parasite population; in this trial, less than 10% of parasites had matched alleles.

Kv11.1 (hERG) blockers with comparable potencies but different binding kinetics might display divergent pro-arrhythmic risks. In the present study, we explored structure-kinetics relationships in four series of Kv11.1 blockers next to their structure-affinity relationships. We learned that despite dramatic differences in affinities and association rates, there were hardly any variations in the dissociation rate constants of these molecules with residence times (RTs) of a few minutes only. Hence, we synthesized 16 novel molecules, in particular in the pyridinium class of compounds, to further address this peculiar phenomenon. We found molecules with very short RTs (e.g., 0.34 min for 37) and much longer RTs (e.g., 105 min for 38). This enabled us to construct a k on-k off-KD kinetic map for all compounds and subsequently divide the map into four provisional quadrants, providing a possible framework for a further and more precise categorization of Kv11.1 blockers. Additionally, two representative compounds (21 and 38) were tested in patch clamp assays, and their RTs were linked to their functional IC50 values. Our findings strongly suggest the importance of the simultaneous study of ligand affinities and kinetic parameters, which may help to explain and predict Kv11.1-mediated cardiotoxicity.
Cognitive control impairments are linked to functional outcome in schizophrenia. The goal of the current study was to investigate precise abnormalities in two aspects of cognitive control: reactively changing a prepared response, and monitoring performance and adjusting behavior accordingly. We adapted an oculomotor task from neurophysiological studies of the cellular basis of cognitive control in nonhuman primates.
16 medicated outpatients with schizophrenia (SZ) and 18 demographically-matched healthy controls performed the modified double-step task. In this task, participants were required to make a saccade to a visual target. Infrequently, the target jumped to a new location and participants were instructed to rapidly inhibit and change their response. A race model provided an estimate of the time needed to cancel a planned movement. Response monitoring was assessed by measuring reaction time (RT) adjustments based on trial history.
SZ patients had normal visually-guided saccadic RTs but required more time to switch the response to the new target location. Additionally, the estimated latency of inhibition was longer in patients and related to employment. Finally, although both groups slowed down on trials that required inhibiting and changing a response, patients showed exaggerated performance-based adjustments in RTs, which was correlated with positive symptom severity.
SZ patients have impairments in rapidly inhibiting eye movements and show idiosyncratic response monitoring. These results are consistent with functional abnormalities in a network involving cortical oculomotor regions, the superior colliculus, and basal ganglia, as described in neurophysiological studies of non-human primates using an identical paradigm, and provide a translational bridge for understanding cognitive symptoms of SZ.
Host SAM domain and HD domain-containing protein 1 (SAMHD1) suppresses reverse transcription kinetics of HIV-1 in nondividing cells such as macrophages by hydrolyzing and nearly depleting cellular dNTPs, which are the substrates of viral reverse transcriptase (RT). However, unlike HIV-1, HIV-2 and SIVsm encode viral protein X (Vpx), which counteracts the dNTPase activity of SAMHD1 and elevates dNTP concentration, allowing the viruses to replicate under abundant dNTP conditions even in nondividing cells.
Here we tested whether RTs of these Vpx coding and noncoding lentiviruses display different enzyme kinetic profiles in response to dNTP concentrations. For this test, we characterized an extensive collection of RTs from 7 HIV-1 strains, 4 HIV-2 strains and 7 SIV strains, and determined their steady-state kinetic parameters. The K m values of all HIV-1 RTs were consistently low and close to the low dNTP concentrations found in macrophages. However, the K m values of SIV and HIV-2 RTs were not only higher than those of HIV-1 RTs but also varied significantly, indicating that HIV-2/SIV RTs require higher dNTP concentrations for efficient DNA synthesis, compared to HIV-1 RT. However, the k cat values of all eighteen lentiviral RTs were very similar.
Our biochemical analysis supports the hypothesis that the enzymological properties, particularly, K m values, of lentivirus RTs, are mechanistically tied with the cellular dNTP availability in nondividing target cells, which is controlled by SAMHD1 and Vpx.
Gunshot wounds and blast injuries to the face (GSWBIFs) produce complex wounds requiring management by multiple surgical specialties. Previous work is limited to single institution reports with little information on processes of care or outcome. We sought to determine those factors associated with hospital complications and mortality.
We performed an 11-year multicenter retrospective cohort analysis of patients sustaining GSWBIF. The face, defined as the area anterior to the external auditory meatuses from the top of the forehead to the chin, was categorized into three zones: I, the chin to the base of the nose; II, the base of the nose to the eyebrows; III, above the brows. We analyzed the effect of multiple factors on outcome.
From January 1, 2000, to December 31, 2010, we treated 720 patients with GSWBIF (539 males, 75%), with a median age of 29 years. The wounding agent was handgun in 41%, explosive (shotgun and blast) in 20%, rifle in 6%, and unknown in 33%. Prehospital or resuscitative phase airway was required in 236 patients (33%). Definitive care was rendered by multiple specialties in 271 patients (38%). Overall, 185 patients died (26%), 146 (79%) within 48 hours. Of the 481 patients hospitalized greater than 48 hours, 184 had at least one complication (38%). Factors significantly associated with any of a total of 207 complications were total number of operations (p &lt; 0.001), Revised Trauma Score (RTS, p &lt; 0.001), and head Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) score (p &lt; 0.05). Factors significantly associated with mortality were RTS (p &lt; 0.001), head AIS score (p &lt; 0.001), total number of operations (p &lt; 0.001), and age (p &lt; 0.05). An injury located in Zone III was independently associated with mortality (p &lt; 0.001).
GSWBIFs have high mortality and are associated with significant morbidity. The multispecialty involvement required for definitive care necessitates triage to a trauma center and underscores the need for an organized approach and the development of effective guidelines.

In this report, we evaluated whether radiological technologists' (RTs') awareness of patient safety would improve and what kind of effects would be seen at the department of radiological technology by introducing KYT [K: kiken (hazard), Y: yochi (prediction), T: (training)].
KYT was carried out by ten RTs based on a KYT sheet for the department of radiological technology. To evaluate the effects of KYT, we asked nine questions each to ten participants before and after KYT enforcement with regard to their attitude to patient safety and to operating procedures for working safely.
Significant improvements after KYT enforcement were obtained in two items concerning medical safety: It is important for any risk to be considered by more than one person; The interest in preventive measures against medical accident degree conducted now) and one concerning operating procedures (It is necessary to have a nurse assist during testing with the mobile X-ray apparatus) (p&lt;0.05).
Performing KYT resulted in improved awareness of the importance of patient safety. KYT also enabled medical staffers to evaluate objectively whether the medical safety measures currently performed would be effective for patients.
Rapid automatized naming (RAN) is widely used to identify reading disabilities (RD) and has recently been considered a potential predictor of risk for mathematics learning disabilities (MLD). Here we longitudinally examine RAN performance from Grades K to 8, to view how growth on RAN response time differs for children with RD versus MLD. Across all participants, there was significant stability of RAN performance for all three subtests. For all three subtests, there was significant between-child variability in response times (RTs) at kindergarten and Grade 8; for select combinations of subtests, there was also between-child variability in difference scores over time. Relative to typically achieving peers, children with MLD or RD were slower on all three subtests at kindergarten, but these deficits were most pronounced for children with MLD versus RD at kindergarten and more persistent through Grade 8 for children with RD. RAN numbers and letters performance was closely related in the RD group, more so than in the MLD group, despite deficits on both subtests across groups. Our findings indicate that empirically guided modifications of RAN are needed for extending its use for evaluating risk for MLD.
To verify that tinnitus itself could disturb speech perception and to evaluate the effects of masking noise on speech perception ability in the patients with normal hearing but unilateral chronic tinnitus using the hearing in noise test.
Prospective, nonrandomized study.
Between June 2009 and May 2011, we enrolled 20 patients with normal hearing and subjective unilateral tinnitus that had persisted for more than 12 months, along with 20 healthy controls of the same age. All subjects were evaluated using audiologic examinations, the tinnitus handicap inventory, and the Korean version of the Hearing in Noise Test (K-HINT) to assess characteristics of tinnitus and speech perception ability in various noisy situations.
Reception threshold for speech (RTS) in a quiet environment and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in various conditions of noise were significantly higher in the tinnitus than in the control group, regardless of whether noise came from the front, right, or left (p &lt; 0.05). When the tinnitus group was subdivided according to the site of noise exposure, the mean SNR of the contralateral noise group was -7.9 ± 1.4 dB, which was significantly higher than the ipsilateral noise (-9.1 ± 1.8 dB) or control group (right, -10.0 ± 0.6 dB; left, -10.1 ± 0.5 dB) (p &lt; 0.05). In addition, there was no significant difference between ipsilateral noise and control groups.
From this study, we showed that tinnitus itself could adversely affect speech perception ability by increasing both RTS and SNR in the tinnitus patients in comparison with healthy controls. In addition, we suggest that proper level of noise on the site of tinnitus might be helpful to increase speech perception in the patients who experience chronic subjective tinnitus.
Although recent reports have provided strong evidence to suggest that xenotropic murine leukemia virus-related virus (XMRV) is unlikely to be the causative agent of prostate cancer and chronic fatigue syndrome, this recombinant retrovirus can nonetheless infect human cells in vitro and induce a chronic infection in macaques. In the present study, we determined the accuracy of DNA synthesis of the reverse transcriptases (RTs) of XMRV and Moloney murine leukemia virus (MoMLV) using a combination of pre-steady-state kinetics of nucleotide incorporation and an M13mp2-based forward mutation assay. The results obtained were compared with those previously reported for the HIV type 1 BH10 strain (HIV-1(BH10)) RT. MoMLV and XMRV RTs were 13.9 and 110 times less efficient [as determined by the catalytic rate constant of the nucleotide incorporation reaction ((pol))/equilibrium constant (K(d))] than the HIV-1(BH10) RT in incorporating correct nucleotides. Misinsertion and mispair extension kinetic studies demonstrated that MoMLV RT was more accurate than the HIV-1(BH10) RT. In comparison with the MoMLV RT, the XMRV RT showed decreased mispair extension fidelity and was less faithful when misincorporating C or A opposite A. However, the XMRV RT showed stronger selectivity against G in misinsertion fidelity assays. Forward mutation assays revealed that XMRV and MoMLV RTs had similar accuracy of DNA-dependent DNA synthesis, but were &gt; 13 times more faithful than the HIV-1(BH10) enzyme. The mutational spectra of XMRV and MoMLV RTs were similar in having a relatively higher proportion of frameshifts and transversions compared with the HIV-1(BH10) RT. However, the XMRV polymerase was less prone to introduce large deletions and one-nucleotide insertions.
Cognitive development is known to involve improvements in accuracy, capacity, and processing speed. Less is known about the role of performance consistency, and there has been virtually no empirical examination of the neural underpinnings of within-person variability in development. In a sample of 92 healthy children and adolescents aged 8-19 years, we aimed to characterize age-related changes in trial-to-trial intraindividual variability (IIV) of reaction time (RT) and to test whether IIV is related to white matter (WM) integrity as indexed by diffusion tensor imaging. IIV was quantified as the SD of correct RTs in a speeded arrow flanker task, and Tract-Based Spatial Statistics was used to test relationships with diffusion characteristics. Large age-related reductions in IIV in both simple congruent trials and more complex incongruent trials were found. Independently of sex, age, and median RT (mRT), lower IIV was associated with higher fractional anisotropy and lower overall diffusivity. Effects were seen for IIV in one or both trial types in the corticospinal tract, the left superior longitudinal fasciculus, the uncinate fasciculus, the forceps minor, and in the genu and splenium of the corpus callosum. There were no significant associations between mRT and any of the diffusion indices. The findings support the proposition that developmental reductions in IIV reflect maturation of WM connectivity and highlight the importance of considering within-person variability in theories of cognitive development and its neurobiological foundation.
Long QT2 (LQT2) syndrome is characterized by bifid (or notched) T waves, whose mechanism is not understood.
The purpose of this study was to test whether increased interventricular dispersion of repolarization induces bifid T waves.
We simultaneously recorded surface ECG and unipolar electrograms at baseline and after dofetilide in a canine model of dofetilide-induced LQT2 (6 male mongrel dogs). Standard ECG variables, T-wave duration, and moments of peaks of bifid T waves (Tp1 and Tp2) were correlated with moments of local repolarization. Epicardial electrograms were recorded over the left ventricular (LV) and right ventricular (RV) anterior walls (11 × 11 electrode grid, 5-mm interelectrode distance). In 5 of the 6 hearts, we also recorded intramural unipolar electrograms (n = 4-7 needles per heart). In each unipolar recording, we determined activation time, repolarization time (RTs), and activation-recovery interval. In addition, we studied RT response to heart rate changes.
Dofetilide prolonged QT and QTc, induced bifid T waves in 4 of 6 animals, and prolonged RT heterogeneously in LV and RV, resulting in increased interventricular and LV intraventricular RT dispersion. Dofetilide did not induce a disparate response in activation-recovery interval across the transmural axis. Dofetilide-induced separation of RT across the RV-LV interface concurred with the moments of T-wave peaks. Dofetilide-induced steepening of restitution slopes was larger in LV than RV.
Dofetilide-induced bifid T waves result from interventricular RT dispersion.
A single-laboratory validation (SLV) and a ring trial (RT) were undertaken to determine nine nutritional elements in food products by inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometry in order to modernize AOAC Official Method 984.27. The improvements involved extension of the scope to all food matrixes (including infant formula), optimized microwave digestion, selected analytical lines, internal standardization, and ion buffering. Simultaneous determination of nine elements (calcium, copper, iron, potassium, magnesium, manganese, sodium, phosphorus, and zinc) was made in food products. Sample digestion was performed through wet digestion of food samples by microwave technology with either closed- or open-vessel systems. Validation was performed to characterize the method for selectivity, sensitivity, linearity, accuracy, precision, recovery, ruggedness, and uncertainty. The robustness and efficiency of this method was proven through a successful RT using experienced independent food industry laboratories. Performance characteristics are reported for 13 certified and in-house reference materials, populating the AOAC triangle food sectors, which fulfilled AOAC criteria and recommendations for accuracy (trueness, recovery, and z-scores) and precision (repeatability and reproducibility RSD, and HorRat values) regarding SLVs and RTs. This multielemental method is cost-efficient, time-saving, accurate, and fit-for-purpose according to ISO 17025 Norm and AOAC acceptability criteria, and is proposed as an extended updated version of AOAC Official Method 984.27 for fortified food products, including infant formula.
Atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumors (AT/RT) are aggressive embryonal tumors having a poor prognosis and are associated with mutations in the tumor suppressor gene hSNF5/SMARCB1/INI1. Differential diagnosis includes choroid plexus carcinoma which has occasionally been attributed as showing an inactivation of INI1/SMARCB1 nuclear staining in immunohistochemistry. However, these findings have been challenged by others. We therefore examined eight AT/RTs from six patients by immunohistochemistry for membranous expression of the inward rectifier potassium channel Kir7.1, which was in the central nervous system so far considered specific for choroid plexus tumors and normal choroid plexus epithelium. Two AT/RT cases exhibited membranous staining of Kir7.1, indicating a plexus epithelial differentiation of these tumors. The implications of these results on tumor diagnosis are discussed.
Retrotransposons are ubiquitous in eukaryotic genomes and now proving to be useful genetic tools for genetic diversity and phylogenetic analyses, especially in plants. In order to assess the diversity of Ty1/Copia-like retrotransposons of cassava, we used PCR primers anchored on the conserved domains of reverse transcriptases (RTs) to amplify cassava Ty1/Copia-like RT. The PCR product was cloned and sequenced. Sequences analysis of the clones revealed the presence of 69 families of Ty1/Copia-like retrotransposon in the genome of cassava. Comparative analyses of the predicted amino acid sequences of these clones with those of other plants showed that retroelements of this class are very heterogeneous in cassava. Cassava is widely grown for its edible roots in the tropical and subtropical regions of the world. Cassava roots, though poor in protein, are rich in starch (makes up about 80% of the dry matter), vitamin C, carotenes, calcium and potassium. It has a great commercial importance as a source of starch and starch based products. Realizing the importance of cassava, it stands out as a crop to benefit from biotechnology development. Heterogeneity of Mecops (Manihot esculenta copia-like Retrotransposons) showed that they may be useful for genetic diversity and phylogenetic analyses of cassava germplasm.

Comparison of the three-dimensional structure of the active sites of MuLV and HIV-1 reverse transcriptases shows the presence of a lysine residue (K152) in the substrate-binding region in MuLV RT, while its equivalent position in HIV-1 RT is occupied by a glycine (G112). To investigate the role of K152 in the mechanism of the polymerase reaction catalyzed by MuLV RT, four mutant RTs, namely, K152A, K152R, K152E, and K152G, were generated and biochemically characterized. All muteins exhibited reduced polymerase activity on both RNA and DNA template-primers with K152E being the most defective. The template-primer binding affinity and the processivity of DNA synthesis, however, remained unchanged. The steady-state kinetic characterization showed little change in K(m.dNTP) (except for that of K152E) and an approximately 3-10-fold decrease in k(cat) depending upon the template-primer and mutational substitutions. The ddNTP resistance patterns were unchanged for all muteins, suggesting no participation of K152 in ddNTP recognition. The ability of individual muteins to add dNTP on the covalently cross-linked enzyme-template-primer complex was significantly decreased. These results together with the analysis of the ion pairs in the catalytic apparatus of MuLV RT suggest that K152 participates in maintaining the integrity of the active site of MuLV RT. Examination of the prepolymerase ternary complex formation showed that neither the wild type nor any of the K152 muteins of MuLV RT are capable of forming stable ternary complexes. This property is in contrast to that of HIV-1 RT, which readily forms stable ternary complexes under similar conditions. These results further indicate that the catalytic mechanism of MuLV RT is significantly different from that of HIV-1 RT, despite the presence of a number of conserved motifs and amino acid residues.
The aim of this work was to evaluate the effect of low temperature (LT) on the contractile and relaxing responses of rat tracheas (RTs) after electrical field stimulation (EFS).
Voltage-dependent (10-60 V, 40 Hz) and frequency-dependent (0.1-60 Hz, 40 V) response curves were constructed at 37 and 18 degrees C after the activation of tracheal intramural nerves with a Grass S88 stimulator. The EFS that produced half of the maximum contractile response (ES50) at 37 or 18 degrees C was determined and considered as the dependent variable. The % relaxation of pre-contracted RTs (EFS; 5 Hz, 40 V) to sodium nitroprusside (SNP; 1 x 10(-7) - 1 x 10(-3) M) isoproterenol (ISP; 1 x 10(-9) - 1 x 10(-5) M) and to 20 mM potassium chloride (KCl) after low-K+ inhibition of the Na+/K+ pump at 18 and 37 degrees C were determined.
We found that the tracheal responses elicited by EFS at 37 and 18 degrees C were completely blocked with 1 microM atropine. LT slightly increases the voltage-dependent ES50, from 33.7 +/- 4.0 to 37.8 +/- 4.8 V, n = 5 but decreases the frequency-dependent ES50 from 19.3 +/- 4.3 to 1.0 +/- 0.28 Hz, n = 5, p &lt; 0.05. Relaxing responses to SNP, ISP and KCl at 37 degrees C correspond to 43.5 +/- 6, 36.7 +/- 12 and 12.1 +/- 1.5% respectively. No significant tracheal relaxations were elicited at 18 degrees C. Our results indicate that in RTs, LT enhances tracheal sensitivity to EFS and decreases it in response to bronchorelaxants. The LT-dependent enhanced contractile response is observed only after a low frequency stimulation range (0.1-20 Hz), that is very close to the frequency of vagal stimuli required for inducing bronchoconstriction in vivo. Furthermore, LT abolishes the sensitivity of RTs to exogenously added bronchorelaxants (NO and ISP). In addition, LT appears to decrease the Na(+)-K+ pump activity; this effect has been associated with increased tracheal hyperreactivity in vitro. ACH appears to be the main endogenous neurotransmitter involved on neurally mediated contractile responses at 37 and 18 degrees C.
Low temperature enhances the contractile response of rat tracheas in response to endogenous ACH release. The effect of LT is limited to frequencies below 20 Hz, which are within the physiological range required for bronchoconstriction. Furthermore, LT severely impairs the sensitivity of RTs to relaxant stimuli, either of endogenous of exogenous origin.
We have constructed a plasmid that induces in bacteria the synthesis of an enzymically active reverse transcriptase (RT) of mouse mammary tumour virus (MMTV), a retrovirus with a typical B-type morphology. The highest catalytic activity was detected only when 27 residues from the C-terminus of the protease were included in the N-terminus of the recombinant RT, after an extra deoxyadenosine was added between the pro and pol genes to overcome the -1 frameshift event (which occurs naturally in virus-infected cells). The recombinant protein with a six-histidine tag was purified to homogeneity by a two-column purification procedure, Ni2+ nitriloacetic acid/agarose followed by carboxymethyl-Sepharose chromatography. Unlike most RTs, the purified MMTV RT is enzymically active as a monomer even after binding a DNA substrate. Like all RTs studied, the recombinant MMTV RT possesses RNA-dependent and DNA-dependent DNA polymerase activities as well as RNase H activity, all of which show a preference for Mg2+ over Mn2+ ions. Other features of these enzymic activities, such as extension of DNA primers, processivity of DNA synthesis, pH dependence, steady-state kinetic constants, effects of Na+ or K+ ions and sensitivity to a thiol-specific reagent and to a zinc chelator, have been evaluated. The catalytic properties of MMTV RT were compared with those of the well-studied RT of HIV-1, the causative agent of AIDS. Interestingly, MMTV RT exhibits a high sensitivity to nucleoside triphosphate analogues (which are known to be potent inhibitors of HIV RTs and are being used as the major anti-AIDS drugs), as high as that of HIV-1 and HIV-2 RTs. Furthermore the recombinant MMTV RT shows a processivity of DNA synthesis higher than that of HIV-1 RT.
Curing effects of chlorine, ozone and ultraviolet (UV) on plasmid DNAs were investigated as one of the measures of bio-hazards due to recombinant plasmids. For donor strains of plasmids, Pseudomonas aeruginosa RM 2046 harboring the self-transmissible plasmid R68 and RM 2021 harboring the cloning vector R1162, Escherichia coli C 600 ML 4903 and ML 1410 harboring the self-transmissible plasmid Rts-1 and RP4, and E. coli JM 109 harboring the cloning vector pBR 322 were used. The curing rate showed a tendency to increase with treatment time in a L-shaped curve for each plasmid DNA. The rates reached steady state after more than 5-10 minutes of the chlorination and ozone treatment, or 5-10 seconds of the UV treatment, independent of the treatment intensity. It became clear by use of replica technique that effective curing took place by chlorination for Rts-1, R1162 and pBR322, by ozone treatment for R68, and by UV treatment for PR4, respectively. Of the three disinfection treatments excellent curing effect occurred with chlorination, as more than 90% of the curing rate was obtained by that treatment for all donor strains.
There are four EF-hand polypeptides in calmodulin, a natural ubiquitous calcium binding protein that activates the enzymes involved in Ca(2+)-mediated signal transduction. An EF-hand polypeptide has six carboxylate functional groups in the middle loop region between two rigid polypeptides. In this study, a calcium binding polymer (CBP) with a structure of poly(L-alanine)-poly(L-alanine-co-L-glutamic acid)-poly(ethylene glycol)-poly(L-alanine-co-L-glutamic acid)-poly(L-alanine) (PA-PAE-PEG-PAE-PA; A11.1-A3.4E3.2-EG40.1-A3.4E3.2-A11.1) was synthesized by mimicking the EF-hand polypeptide. The 6-7 carboxylate functional groups from PAE are expected to form a binding site for Ca(2+). As the Ca(2+) bound to CBP, small changes in the circular dichroism spectra and (13)C NMR spectra were observed, indicating that Ca(2+) binding to CBP induced changes in the conformation of CBP. The binding constant of CBP to Ca(2+) was investigated by using the competitive binding of 2,2',2″,2‴-{ethane-1,2-diylbis[oxy(4-bromo-2,1-phenylene)nitrilo]} tetraacetic acid (5,5-Br2-BAPTA). The binding constant obtained with a CaLigator program by least-squares fitting of the absorbance profile as a function of Ca(2+) concentration was 5.1 × 10(5) M(-1), which was similar to that of calmodulin. The selectivity of CBP for metal ion binding was compared among Ca(2+), Cu(2+), and Zn(2+). The binding constant was obtained through a similar competitive binding study with murexide. The binding constants for Ca(2+), Cu(2+), and Zn(2+) were 7.0 × 10(5), 4.2 × 10(5), and 1.7 × 10(5) M(-1), respectively, indicating 2-4-fold higher selectivity of CBP for Ca(2+) compared to Cu(2+) and Zn(2+). The CBP has selectivity for Ca(2+), and binding affinity for Ca(2+) was similar to the biological Ca(2+) binding motif of calmodulin.
The p300 and CBP transcriptional coactivator paralogs (p300/CBP) regulate a variety of different cellular pathways, in part, by acetylating histones and more than 70 non-histone protein substrates. Mutation, chromosomal translocation, or other aberrant activities of p300/CBP are linked to many different diseases, including cancer. Because of its pleiotropic biological roles and connection to disease, it is important to understand the mechanism of acetyl transfer by p300/CBP, in part so that inhibitors can be more rationally developed. Toward this goal, a structure of p300 bound to a Lys-CoA bisubstrate HAT inhibitor has been previously elucidated, and the enzyme's catalytic mechanism has been investigated. Nonetheless, many questions underlying p300/CBP structure and mechanism remain. Here, we report a structural characterization of different reaction states in the p300 activity cycle. We present the structures of p300 in complex with an acetyl-CoA substrate, a CoA product, and an acetonyl-CoA inhibitor. A comparison of these structures with the previously reported p300/Lys-CoA complex demonstrates that the conformation of the enzyme active site depends on the interaction of the enzyme with the cofactor, and is not apparently influenced by protein substrate lysine binding. The p300/CoA crystals also contain two poly(ethylene glycol) moieties bound proximal to the cofactor binding site, implicating the path of protein substrate association. The structure of the p300/acetonyl-CoA complex explains the inhibitory and tight binding properties of the acetonyl-CoA toward p300. Together, these studies provide new insights into the molecular basis of acetylation by p300 and have implications for the rational development of new small molecule p300 inhibitors.
We report quantitative analysis of peptide-peptide interactions on a 27 MHz quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) in aqueous solution. The KID (kinase-inducible domain) of transcription factor CREB (cyclic AMP response element binding protein) is known to interact with the KIX domain of coactivator CBP (CREB binding protein), facilitated by phosphorylation at Ser-133 of the KID. The KIX domain peptide (86 aa) was immobilized on the QCM gold electrode surface by means of a poly(ethylene glycol) spacer. Binding of the KID peptide (46 aa) to the KIX peptide was detected by frequency decreases (mass increases) of the QCM. Both maximum binding amount (Deltammax) and association constants (Ka) obtained from the QCM measurements increased as a result of phosphorylation of Ser-133 of the KID peptide. The Ka values for KIX peptide to the phosphorylated (pKID) and unphosphorylated KID peptides were (93+/-2) x 10(3) and (5+/-1) x 10(3) M(-1), respectively. This difference was explained by the dissociation rate constant (k(-1)) of the pKID being 20 times smaller than that of the KID, while association rate constants (k1) were independent of phosphorylation.
A high affinity calcium-binding protein has recently been purified from the adrenal medulla (Kuo, I.C.Y., and Coffee, C.J. (1976) J. Biol. Chem. 251, 1603-1609). This protein is closely related in its chemical and physical properties to troponin-C (TN-C) of muscle tissue. Further examination of the adrenal medulla protein indicates that the removal of calcium is accompanied by a marked change in the conformation. This change in structure is similar, if not identical, to the calcium-dependent conformational change which has been described for skeletal muscle TN-C (Murray, A.C., and Kay, C.M. (1972) Biochemistry 11, 2622). The far ultraviolet circular dichroism spectrum of native adrenal medulla calcium-binding protein (AM-CBP) shows characteristic helical ellipticity bands at 222 and 207 nm. The helical content, as estimated from these data, is between 40 and 45%. Removal of calcium is accompanied by a change in ellipticity which corresponds to a decrease from 40 to 20% in the helical content. The near-ultraviolet circular dichroism spectrum shows negative dichroic bands at 262 and 268 nm which are characteristic of phenylalanine. These bands are relatively insensitive to changes in the calcium ion concentration. Sedimentation velocity studies likewise are indicative of a calcium-dependent structural alteration. The sedimentation coefficient of the native protein was observed to be 1.89 S. Similar measurements performed in the presence of 3 mM ethylene glycol bis(beta-aminoethyl ether) N,N, N', N'-tetraacetic acid (EGTA) gave a sedimentation coefficient of 1.50 S. The molecular weight, as determined by sedimentation equilibrium studies, was 16,000 regardless of whether the measurements were made in the presence of CaCl2 or EGTA. From the elution properties of AM-CBP on Sephadex G-100, the Stokes radius was observed to be 19.8 A in the presence of calcium and 21.9 A in the presence of EGTA. All of these changes which were induced by the addition of EGTA were completely reversible by the readdition of excess CaCl2. These data suggest that the removal of calcium from AM-CBP is accompanied by a pronounced conformational change which occurs without a molecular weight change. The decreased sedimentation coefficient, the increased Stokes radius, and the reduced helical content, which are observed for the apoprotein, indicate that removal of calcium results in a transformation from a compact symmetrical structure to one that is less ordered and more asymmetrical.
Cell migration is orchestrated by dynamic interactions of microtubules with the plasma membrane cortex. How these interactions facilitate these dynamic processes is still being actively investigated. TIP150 is a newly characterized microtubule plus end tracking protein essential for mitosis and entosis (Ward, T., Wang, M., Liu, X., Wang, Z., Xia, P., Chu, Y., Wang, X., Liu, L., Jiang, K., Yu, H., Yan, M., Wang, J., Hill, D. L., Huang, Y., Zhu, T., and Yao, X. (2013) Regulation of a dynamic interaction between two microtubule-binding proteins, EB1 and TIP150, by the mitotic p300/CBP-associated factor (PCAF) orchestrates kinetochore microtubule plasticity and chromosome stability during mitosis. J. Biol. Chem. 288, 15771-15785; Xia, P., Zhou, J., Song, X., Wu, B., Liu, X., Li, D., Zhang, S., Wang, Z., Yu, H., Ward, T., Zhang, J., Li, Y., Wang, X., Chen, Y., Guo, Z., and Yao, X. (2014) Aurora A orchestrates entosis by regulating a dynamic MCAK-TIP150 interaction. J. Mol. Cell Biol. 6, 240-254). Here we show that TIP150 links dynamic microtubules to steer cell migration by interacting with cortactin. Mechanistically, TIP150 binds to cortactin via its C-terminal tail. Interestingly, the C-terminal TIP150 proline-rich region (CT150) binds to the Src homology 3 domain of cortactin specifically, and such an interaction is negatively regulated by EGF-elicited tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin. Importantly, suppression of TIP150 or overexpression of phospho-mimicking cortactin inhibits polarized cell migration. In addition, CT150 disrupts the biochemical interaction between TIP150 and cortactin in vitro, and perturbation of the TIP150-cortactin interaction in vivo using a membrane-permeable TAT-CT150 peptide results in an inhibition of directional cell migration. We reason that a dynamic TIP150-cortactin interaction orchestrates directional cell migration via coupling dynamic microtubule plus ends to the cortical cytoskeleton.
At variance with the long established paradigm that retinal arteriolar narrowing trails hypertension, several longitudinal studies, all based on conventional blood pressure (CBP) measurement, proposed that retinal arteriolar narrowing indicates heightened microvascular resistance and precedes hypertension. In 783 randomly recruited Flemish (mean age, 38.2 years; 51.3% women), we investigated to what extent CBP and daytime (10 am to 8 pm) ambulatory blood pressure (ABP) measured at baseline (1989-2008) predicted the central retinal arteriolar equivalent (CRAE) in retinal photographs obtained at follow-up (2008-2015). Systolic/diastolic hypertension thresholds were 140/90 mm Hg for CBP and 135/85 mm Hg for ABP. In multivariable-adjusted models including both baseline CBP and ABP, CRAE after 10.3 years (median) of follow-up was unrelated to CBP (P≥0.14), whereas ABP predicted CRAE narrowing (P≤0.011). Per 1-SD increment in systolic/diastolic blood pressure, the association sizes were -0.95 µm (95% confidence interval, -2.20 to 0.30)/-0.75 µm (-1.93 to 0.42) for CBP and -1.76 µm (-2.95 to -0.58)/-1.48 µm (-2.61 to -0.34) for ABP. Patients with ambulatory hypertension at baseline (17.0%) had smaller CRAE (146.5 versus 152.6 µm; P&lt;0.001) at follow-up. CRAE was not different (P≥0.31) between true normotension (normal CBP and ABP; prevalence, 77.6%) and white-coat hypertension (elevated CBP and normal ABP, 5.4%) and between masked hypertension (normal CBP and elevated ABP, 10.2%) and hypertension (elevated CBP and ABP, 6.8%). In conclusion, the paradigm that retinal arteriolar narrowing precedes hypertension can be explained by the limitations of CBP measurement, including nonidentification of masked and white-coat hypertension.
Ras is a molecular switch cycling between an active, GTP-bound and an inactive, GDP-bound state. Mutations in Ras, mostly affecting the off-switch, are found in many human tumours. Recently, it has been shown that K-Ras 4B is targeted by lysine acetylation at K104. Based on results obtained for an acetylation mimetic Ras mutant (K104Q), it was hypothesised that K104-acetylation might interfere with its oncogenicity by impairing SOS-catalysed guanine-nucleotide exchange. We prepared site-specifically K104-acetylated K-Ras 4B and the corresponding oncogenic mutant protein G12V using the genetic-code expansion concept. We found that SOS-catalysed nucleotide exchange, also of allosterically activated SOS, was neither affected by acetylation of K104 in wildtype K-Ras 4B nor in the G12V mutant, suggesting that glutamine is a poor mimetic for acetylation at this site. In vitro, the lysine-acetyltransferases CBP and p300 were able to acetylate both, wildtype and G12V K-Ras 4B. In addition to K104 we identified further acetylation sites in K-Ras 4B, including K147, within the important G5/SAK-motif. However, the intrinsic and the SOS-catalysed nucleotide exchange was not affected by K147-acetylation of K-Ras 4B. Finally, we show that Sirt2 and HDAC6 do neither deacetylate K-Ras 4B if acetylated at K104 nor if acetylated at K147 in vitro.
The effect of pethidine as patient-controlled epidural analgesia (PCEA) on specific biochemical components in breast milk in relation to the timing of secretory activation is not well investigated. The aim of this study was to compare biochemical timing of secretory activation between women who had a vaginal (V) or Caesarean birth with pethidine-PCEA (CBP). Several milk samples were collected daily from 36 mothers (17 V, 19 CBP) for the first 265 h post-partum. Protein and lactose concentrations and Na(+) and K(+) ion levels were measured. Samples were assigned to three time periods: 0-72, &gt;72-165 and &gt;165-265 h post-partum for statistical analyses. Data were analyzed using linear mixed effect models. In the first 72 h post-partum, the mean difference in lactose concentration was 5 gL(-1) higher in group V (P &lt; 0.05). From &gt;72-165 h post-partum, protein and Na(+) concentrations were lower in group V (P = 0.05, P = 0.02), and K(+) levels were higher in group V (P &lt; 0.001). From &gt;165-265 h post-partum, there were no significant differences between the groups. Biochemically, secretory activation had occurred by 72 h post-partum in both groups. There were greater variations in measured biochemical components observed within group CBP initially. However, by 165 h post-partum, there were no differences in the biochemical components between the groups. This suggests that effects of pethidine-PCEA are diminished by 72 h post-partum and undetected by 165 h.
The PIAS proteins (Protein Inhibitor of Activated STATs) constitute a family of multifunctional nuclear proteins operating as SUMO E3 ligases and being involved in a multitude of interactions. They participate in a range of biological processes, also beyond their well-established role in the immune system and cytokine signalling. They act both as transcriptional corepressors and coactivators depending on the context. In the present work, we investigated mechanisms by which PIAS1 causes activation or repression of c-Myb dependent target genes. Analysis of global expression data shows that c-Myb and PIAS1 knockdowns affect a subset of common targets, but with a dual outcome consistent with a role of PIAS1 as either a corepressor or coactivator. Our mechanistic studies show that PIAS1 engages in a novel interaction with the acetyltransferase and coactivator p300. Interaction and ChIP analysis suggest a bridging function where PIAS1 enhances p300 recruitment to c-Myb-bound sites through interaction with both proteins. In addition, the E3 activity of PIAS1 enhances further its coactivation. Remarkably, the SUMO status of c-Myb had a decisive role, indicating a SUMO-dependent switch in the way PIAS1 affects c-Myb, either as a coactivator or corepressor. Removal of the two major SUMO-conjugation sites in c-Myb (2KR mutant), which enhances its activity significantly, turned PIAS1 into a corepressor. Also, p300 was less efficiently recruited to chromatin by c-Myb-2KR. We propose that PIAS1 acts as a "protein inhibitor of activated c-Myb" in the absence of SUMOylation while, in its presence, PIAS behaves as a "protein activator of repressed c-Myb".
Epigenetic modifications may play a relevant role in the pathogenesis of human abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). The aim of the study was therefore to investigate histone acetylation and expression of corresponding lysine [K] histone acetyltransferases (KATs) in AAA.
A comparative study of AAA tissue samples (n = 37, open surgical intervention) and healthy aortae (n = 12, trauma surgery) was performed using quantitative PCR, immunohistochemistry (IHC), and Western blot. Expression of the KAT families GNAT (KAT2A, KAT2B), p300/CBP (KAT3A, KAT3B), and MYST (KAT5, KAT6A, KAT6B, KAT7, KAT8) was significantly higher in AAA than in controls (P ≤ 0.019). Highest expression was observed for KAT2B, KAT3A, KAT3B, and KAT6B (P ≤ 0.007). Expression of KAT2B significantly correlated with KAT3A, KAT3B, and KAT6B (r = 0.705, 0.564, and 0.528, respectively, P &lt; 0.001), and KAT6B with KAT3A, KAT3B, and KAT6A (r = 0.407, 0.500, and 0.531, respectively, P &lt; 0.05). Localization of highly expressed KAT2B, KAT3B, and KAT6B was further characterized by immunostaining. Significant correlations were observed between KAT2B with endothelial cells (ECs) (r = 0.486, P &lt; 0.01), KAT3B with T cells and macrophages, (r = 0.421 and r = 0.351, respectively, P &lt; 0.05), KAT6A with intramural ECs (r = 0.541, P &lt; 0.001) and with a contractile phenotype of smooth muscle cells (SMCs) (r = 0.425, P &lt; 0.01), and KAT6B with T cells (r = 0.553, P &lt; 0.001). Furthermore, KAT2B was associated with AAA diameter (r = 0.382, P &lt; 0.05), and KAT3B, KAT6A, and KAT6B correlated negatively with blood urea nitrogen (r = -0.403, -0.408, -0.478, P &lt; 0.05). In addtion, acetylation of the histone substrates H3K9, H3K18 and H3K14 was increased in AAA compared to control aortae.
Our results demonstrate that aberrant epigenetic modifications such as changes in the expression of KATs and acetylation of corresponding histones are present in AAA. These findings may provide new insight in the pathomechanism of AAA.
Cyclic AMP-responsive element-binding protein 3-like 3, hepatocyte specific (CREBH), is a hepatic transcription factor that functions as a key regulator of energy homeostasis. Here, we defined a regulatory CREBH posttranslational modification process, namely, lysine-specific acetylation, and its functional involvement in fasting-induced hepatic lipid metabolism. Fasting induces CREBH acetylation in mouse livers in a time-dependent manner, and this event is critical for CREBH transcriptional activity in regulating hepatic lipid homeostasis. The histone acetyltransferase PCAF-mediated acetylation and the deacetylase sirtuin-1-mediated deacetylation coexist to maintain CREBH acetylation states under fasting conditions. Site-directed mutagenesis and functional analyses revealed that the lysine (K) residue at position 294 (K294) within the bZIP domain of the CREBH protein is the site where fasting-induced acetylation/deacetylation occurs. Introduction of the acetylation-deficient (K294R) or acetylation-mimicking (K294Q) mutation inhibited or enhanced CREBH transcriptional activity, respectively. Importantly, CREBH acetylation at lysine 294 was required for the interaction and synergy between CREBH and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα) in activating their target genes upon fasting or glucagon stimulation. Introduction of the CREBH lysine 294 mutation in the liver leads to hepatic steatosis and hyperlipidemia in animals under prolonged fasting. In summary, our study reveals a molecular mechanism by which fasting or glucagon stimulation modulates lipid homeostasis through acetylation of CREBH.
Historically, the human frontal pole (FP) has been considered as a single architectonic area. Brodmann's area 10 is located in the frontal lobe with known contributions in the execution of various higher order cognitive processes. However, recent cytoarchitectural studies of the FP in humans have shown that this portion of cortex contains two distinct cytoarchitectonic regions. Since architectonic differences are accompanied by differential connectivity and functions, the frontal pole qualifies as a candidate region for exploratory parcellation into functionally discrete sub-regions. We investigated whether this functional heterogeneity is reflected in distinct segregations within cytoarchitectonically defined FP-areas using meta-analytic co-activation based parcellation (CBP). The CBP method examined the co-activation patterns of all voxels within the FP as reported in functional neuroimaging studies archived in the BrainMap database. Voxels within the FP were subsequently clustered into sub-regions based on the similarity of their respective meta-analytically derived co-activation maps. Performing this CBP analysis on the FP via k-means clustering produced a distinct 3-cluster parcellation for each hemisphere corresponding to previously identified cytoarchitectural differences. Post-hoc functional characterization of clusters via BrainMap metadata revealed that lateral regions of the FP mapped to memory and emotion domains, while the dorso- and ventromedial clusters were associated broadly with emotion and social cognition processes. Furthermore, the dorsomedial regions contain an emphasis on theory of mind and affective related paradigms whereas ventromedial regions couple with reward tasks. Results from this study support previous segregations of the FP and provide meta-analytic contributions to the ongoing discussion of elucidating functional architecture within human FP.
Wnt/β-catenin signaling has an important role in the angiogenic activity of endothelial cells (ECs). Bach1 is a transcription factor and is expressed in ECs, but whether Bach1 regulates angiogenesis is unknown.
This study evaluated the role of Bach1 in angiogenesis and Wnt/β-catenin signaling.
Hind-limb ischemia was surgically induced in Bach1(-/-) mice and their wild-type littermates and in C57BL/6J mice treated with adenoviruses coding for Bach1 or GFP. Lack of Bach1 expression was associated with significant increases in perfusion and vascular density and in the expression of proangiogenic cytokines in the ischemic hindlimb of mice, with enhancement of the angiogenic activity of ECs (eg, tube formation, migration, and proliferation). Bach1 overexpression impaired angiogenesis in mice with hind-limb ischemia and inhibited Wnt3a-stimulated angiogenic response and the expression of Wnt/β-catenin target genes, such as interleukin-8 and vascular endothelial growth factor, in human umbilical vein ECs. Interleukin-8 and vascular endothelial growth factor were responsible for the antiangiogenic response of Bach1. Immunoprecipitation and GST pull-down assessments indicated that Bach1 binds directly to TCF4 and reduces the interaction of β-catenin with TCF4. Bach1 overexpression reduces the interaction between p300/CBP and β-catenin, as well as β-catenin acetylation, and chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments confirmed that Bach1 occupies the TCF4-binding site of the interleukin-8 promoter and recruits histone deacetylase 1 to the interleukin-8 promoter in human umbilical vein ECs.
Bach1 suppresses angiogenesis after ischemic injury and impairs Wnt/β-catenin signaling by disrupting the interaction between β-catenin and TCF4 and by recruiting histone deacetylase 1 to the promoter of TCF4-targeted genes.
NK cells play a key role in innate elimination of virally infected or neoplastic cells but they can be circumvented by immunoevasive mechanisms enabling viral spread or tumor progression. Engagement of the NKG2D activating receptor with soluble forms of its ligand is one such mechanism of inducing NK cell hyporesponsiveness. Interestingly, this immunoevasive strategy among others is described at the maternal-fetal interface where tolerance of the semi-allogeneic fetus is required to allow successful human pregnancy. Understanding of maternal-fetal tolerance is increasing but mechanisms preventing alloreactivity of fetal immune cells against the maternal host are less well understood. The study of umbilical cord blood has enabled insight of the fetal immune system, which appears immature and inert. We have found that soluble NKG2D ligands (sNKG2DLs) are present in cord blood plasma (CBP) and associate with adult NK cell hyporesponsiveness demonstrated by reduced CD107a expression and secretion of IFN-γ upon stimulation. The capacity of NK cells to kill K562 cells or proliferate was also reduced by incubation with CBP; however, physical removal of sNKG2DL from CBP restored K562 lytic function and NKG2D expression. Therefore, our results strongly suggest sNKG2DLs are expressed in CBP as a mechanism of fetal-maternal tolerance in human pregnancy.
Thermotolerant inulin-utilizing yeast strains were successfully isolated in this study. Among the isolated strains, Kluyveromyces marxianus DBKKU Y-102 was found to be the most effective strain for direct ethanol fermentation at high temperature from fresh Jerusalem artichoke (JA) tubers without inulin hydrolysis under consolidated bioprocessing (CBP). The maximum ethanol concentrations produced by this strain under the optimum culture conditions were 104.83 and 97.46 g L(-1) at 37 and 40 °C, respectively. Data from this study clearly demonstrated that the use of thermotolerant inulin-utilizing yeast K. marxianus for ethanol production from fresh JA tubers in the CBP process not only provided high levels of ethanol, but also could eliminate the addition of external enzyme for inulin hydrolysis, which might lead to the reduction of operating costs. The expression of genes involved in carbohydrate metabolism in K. marxianus DBKKU Y-102 during ethanol fermentation was investigated by real-time RT-PCR, and the results revealed that expression levels were distinctive depending on the growth phase and growth conditions. However, among the genes tested, adh4 and tdh2 were highly expressed under high temperature conditions in both exponential- and stationary-growth phases, suggesting that these genes might play a crucial role in acquiring thermotolerance ability in this organism under stress conditions.
Histone acetylation modulates gene expression and has been described as increased in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). We investigated interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF1) interactions that influence H4 acetylation (H4ac) in SLE. Intracellular flow cytometry for H4 acetylated lysine (K) 5, K8, K12, and K16 was performed. Histone acetylation was defined in monocytes and T cells from controls and SLE patients. RNA-Seq studies were performed on monocytes to look for an imbalance in histone acetyltransferases and histone deacetylase enzyme expression. Expression levels were validated using real-time quantitative RT-PCR. IRF1 induction of H4ac was evaluated using D54MG cells overexpressing IRF1. IRF1 protein interactions were studied using co-immunoprecipitation assays. IRF1-dependent recruitment of histone acetyltransferases to target genes was examined by ChIP assays using p300 antibody. Flow cytometry data showed significantly increased H4K5, H4K8, H4K12, and H4K16 acetylation in SLE monocytes. HDAC3 and HDAC11 gene expression were decreased in SLE monocytes. PCAF showed significantly higher gene expression in SLE than controls. IRF1-overexpressing D54MG cells were associated with significantly increased H4K5, H4K8, and H4K12 acetylation compared to vector-control D54MG cells both globally and at specific target genes. Co-immunoprecipitation studies using D54MG cells revealed IRF1 protein-protein interactions with PCAF, P300, CBP, GCN5, ATF2, and HDAC3. ChIP experiments demonstrated increased p300 recruitment to known IRF1 targets in D54MG cells overexpressing IRF1. In contrast, p300 binding to IRF1 targets decreased in D54MG cells with IRF1 knockdown. SLE appears to be associated with an imbalance in histone acetyltransferases and histone deacetylase enzymes favoring pathologic H4 acetylation. Furthermore, IRF1 directly interacts with chromatin modifying enzymes, supporting a model where recruitment to specific target genes is mediated in part by IRF1.
Histone acetyltransferase (HAT) inhibitors can inhibit proliferation and induce apoptosis in cancer cell lines. The novel cell-permeable p300/CREB-binding protein (CBP)-selective HAT inhibitor HATi II can reduce histone H3 acetylation and induce chromatin condensation in HeLa cells. Here, we examined the effects and mechanism of action of HATi II in glioma cell lines.
Cell viability was assessed using the CCK-8 assay. Cell cycle analysis was performed using flow cytometry. Apoptosis was evaluated using Annexin V staining and flow cytometry, Hoechst 33342 staining and the TUNEL assay. Expression and cleavage of caspase-3, caspase-9 and poly ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) were assessed by Western blotting. Statistical analysis was performed using two-tailed Student's t-tests. The gene expression profiles of U251 glioma cells treated with HATi II or DMSO were analyzed using the Arraystar Human 8 x 60 K LncRNA/mRNA expression array; data was analyzed using MEV (Multi Experiment View) cluster software. Datasets representing genes with altered expression profiles (≥2-fold) derived from the cluster analyses were subjected to gene ontology and pathway analysis.
HATi II inhibited the proliferation of U251, U87, HS683 and SHG44 cells in a dose-dependent manner. HATi II induced cell cycle arrest at the G2/M phase, and induced significant levels of apoptosis, apoptotic body formation and DNA fragmentation in HATi II-treated U251 and SHG44 cells. HATi II induced cleavage of caspase-3, caspase-9 and PARP in U251 and SHG44 cells. In HATi II-treated U251 cells, 965 genes were upregulated, 984 genes were downregulated and 3492/33327 lncRNAs were differentially expressed. GO analysis showed the differentially expressed genes with known functions are involved in a variety of processes; alcoholism, p53 signaling pathway, cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction and transcriptional mis-regulation in cancer were the four most significant pathways. Upregulation of p53 signaling pathway-related genes in HATi II-treated cells was confirmed by quantitative RT-PCR and Western blotting.
HATi II inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis via the caspase-dependent pathway in human glioma cell lines, possibly by activating the p53 signaling pathway. HATi II deserves further investigation as a novel treatment for glioma.
Whether blood pressure thresholds for hypertension should differ according to sex or age remains debated. We did a subject-level meta-analysis of 5018 people untreated for hypertension and randomly recruited from 5 populations (women, 56.7%; ≥60 years, 42.3%). We used multivariable-adjusted Cox regression and a bootstrap procedure to determine home blood pressure (HBP) levels yielding 10-year cardiovascular risks similar to those associated with established systolic/diastolic thresholds (140-160/80-100 mm Hg) for the conventional blood pressure (CBP). Conversely, we estimated CBP thresholds providing 10-year cardiovascular risks similar to those associated established HBP levels (125-135/80-85 mm Hg). All analyses were stratified for sex and age (&lt;60 versus ≥60 years). During 8.3 years (median), 414 participants experienced a cardiovascular event. The sex differences between HBP thresholds derived from CBP and between CBP thresholds derived from HBP were all nonsignificant (P≥0.24), ranging from -4.6 to 3.6 mm Hg systolic and from -4.3 to 2.1 mm Hg diastolic. The age differences between HBP thresholds derived from CBP and between CBP thresholds derived from HBP ranged from -6.7 to 8.4 mm Hg systolic and from -1.9 to 1.7 mm Hg diastolic and were nonsignificant (P≥0.08), except for HBP thresholds derived from CBP levels of 140 mm Hg systolic and 80 mm Hg diastolic (P≤0.04). Sensitivity analyses based on cardiac or cerebrovascular complications were confirmatory. In conclusion, our findings based on outcome-driven criteria support contemporary guidelines that propose single blood pressure thresholds that can be indiscriminately applied in both sexes and across the age range.
Dietary restriction or reduced food intake was supported to protect against renal and hepatic ischemic injury. In this vein, short fasting was recently shown to protect in situ rat liver against ischemia-reperfusion. Here, perfused ex vivo instead of in situ livers were exposed to ischemia-reperfusion to study the impact of disconnecting liver from extrahepatic supply in energetic substrates on the protection given by short-term fasting.
Perfused ex vivo livers using short (18 h) fasted compared with fed rats were submitted to ischemia-reperfusion and studied for release of cytolysis markers in the perfusate. Energetic stores are differently available in time and cell energetic charges (ratio of adenosine triphosphate plus half of the adenosine diphosphate concentrations to the sum of adenosine triphosphate + adenosine diphosphate + adenosine monophosphate concentrations), adenosine phosphates, and glycogen, which were further measured at different time points in livers.
Short fasting versus feeding failed to protect perfused ex vivo rat livers against ischemia/reperfusion, increasing the release of cytolysis markers (potassium, cytochrome c, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, and lactate dehydrogenase) in the perfusate during reoxygenation phase. Toxicity of short fasting versus feeding was associated with lower glycogen and energetic charges in livers and lower lactate levels in the perfusate.
High energetic charge, intracellular content in glycogen, and glycolytic activity may protect liver against ischemia/reperfusion injury. This work does not question how much the protective role previously demonstrated in the literature for dietary restriction and short fasting. In fact, it suggests that exceeding the energy charge threshold value of 0.3 might trigger the effectiveness of this protective role.
People with diabetes have accelerated arterial stiffening. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of increasing fruit, vegetable and dairy intake for 12 months on carotid femoral pulse wave velocity (cfPWV), augmentation index (AIx), and central blood pressure (cBP), compared to a usual diet control, in people with type 1 and type 2 diabetes. In a 12 months randomised controlled trial, cfPWV, AIx and cBP were measured every 3 months. The intervention group received dietary counselling to increase consumption of fruit (+1 serving/day; 150 g/day), vegetables (+2 servings/day; 150 g/day) and dairy (+1 serving/day; 200-250 g/day) at baseline, 1, 3, 6 and 9 months. The control group continued on their usual diet. One hundred and nine participants were randomised and 92 (intervention n = 45; control n = 47) completed. At 3 months, fruit (184 g/day; p = 0.001) and dairy (83 g/day; p = 0.037) intake increased in the intervention group compared with the control group but this increase was not maintained at 12 months. After adjustment for baseline measurements there was no time by treatment effect for central systolic or diastolic BP, AIx or cfPWV. A time effect existed for AIx which modestly increased over time. Peripheral diastolic BP and central pulse pressure were improved in the intervention group compared with the control group at 12 months. In the cohort with type 1 and type 2 diabetes, improving dietary quality by increasing consumption of fruit, vegetables and dairy did not improve cBP, AIx or cfPWV, compared with a control group continuing on their usual diet, after 12 months.
The cochlear nucleus (CN) and superior olivary complex are auditory brainstem centers with essential roles in encoding temporal features of vocalizations, localization of sound sources and descending modulation of the cochlea. Numerous neuronal populations, across a multitude of laboratory mammals, have been characterized within these brainstem centers based on cell body morphology, dendritic architecture, afferent/efferent connections and neurochemistry. However, scant details are available for these neuronal populations in humans. The objective of this study is to further characterize human auditory hindbrain nuclei and examine the axonal connections between these structures. To this end, we have used immunohistochemistry and morphometric techniques to characterize neuronal populations and axonal projections in the human brainstem. Herein, we provide evidence for calretinin immunoreactive neurons and synaptic boutons in the ventral CN, axons in the trapezoid body, peridendritic boutons in the medial superior olive and calyceal endings in the medial nucleus of the trapezoid body (MNTB). Further, we demonstrate that the majority of neurons in the human MNTB are calbindin and Kv3.1b immunoreactive and that perisomatic profiles in this nucleus are vesicular glutamate transporter and Rab3a positive, suggesting that such profiles are in fact synaptic terminals.
This study demonstrates that the increased potassium content in the body seems to change both the blood pressure and renal tubular function. We wanted to test the hypotheses that amiloride and spironolactone induced potassium retention reduces ambulatory blood pressure (ABP) and central blood pressure (CBP) during baseline conditions and after furosemide and that the tubular transport via the epithelial sodium channels (ENaCs) and aquaporin-2 (AQP2) water channels was increased by furosemide in arterial hypertension. Each of three 28-day treatment periods (placebo, amiloride, and spironolactone) was completed by a 4-day period with standardized diet regarding calories and sodium and water intake. At the end of each period, we measured pulse wave velocity (PWV), central systolic blood pressure (CSBP), central diastolic blood pressure (CDBP), glomerular filtration rate (GFR), free water clearance (CH2O), fractional excretion of sodium (FENa) and potassium (FEK), urinary excretion of AQP2 (u-AQP2), urinary excretion of γ-fraction of the ENaC (u-ENaCγ), and plasma concentrations of renin (PRC), angiotensin II (p-Ang II), and aldosterone (p-Aldo) at baseline conditions and after furosemide bolus. Ambulatory blood pressure and CBP were significantly lowered by amiloride and spironolactone. During 24-hour urine collection and at baseline, GFR, CH2O, FENa, FEK, u-AQP2 and u-ENaCγ were the same. After furosemide, CH2O, FENa, FEK, u-AQP2, u-ENaCγ, PRC, p-Ang II, p-Aldo, PWV and CDBP increased after all treatments. However, during amiloride treatment, FEK increased to a larger extent than after spironolactone and during placebo after furosemide, and CSBP was not significantly reduced. The increases in water and sodium absorption via AQP2 and ENaC after furosemide most likely are compensatory phenomena to antagonize water and sodium depletion. Amiloride is less effective than spironolactone to reduce renal potassium excretion.
To determine the effectiveness of Continuous blood purification (CBP) therapy on diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and acute kidney injury (AKI) in diabetic nephropathy (DN) patients.
Sixteen DN patients who developed severe DKA and AKI between 2008 and 2011 in the West China Hospital were recruited. All of the recruited patients presented with severe metabolic acidosis, electrolyte disturbance and dehydration. In addition to routine treatments, continuous venovenous hemofiltration (CVVH) was performed for at least 48 h with Baxter Accura or B. Braun Diapact CRRT machine and B. Braun Diacap Acute M hemofilter. Hemofiltration was accomplished using predilution bicarbonate replacement fluid at the rate of 3000 mL/h and citrate or low-molecular weight heparin (LMWH) for anticoagulation, with blood flow rates of 180 to 250 mL/min.
One patient died unexpectedly 10 h after admission to hospital. The other fifteen patients had significant improvements in metabolic acidosis index after 12 hours of CVVH therapy, such as an average increase of 7.21 +/- 0.07 carbon dioxide combining power (CO2CP)and improvement of arterial PH. The blood urea nitrogen (BUN), serum creatinine (SCr), serum glucose (Glu), serum potassium (K(+)) and bloodosmotic pressure of the 15 patients decreased significantly after 48 hours of CVVH therapy. Eleven cases entered into diuretic phase and had renal functions recovered (12 +/- 5) d and (18 +/- 12) d after admission to the hospital, respectively.
CVVH therapy as an early intervention can bring significant benefits to DN patients with DKA and AKI. Early institution of CVVH therapy may be considered not only for treating uremia and fluid retention but also for correcting metabolic abnormalities like metabolic acidosis.
Potassium is the main intracellular cation, which contributes to keeping the intracellular membrane potential slightly negative and elicits contraction of smooth, skeletal and cardiac muscle. A change in potassium intake modifies both cardiovascular and renal tubular function. The purpose of the trial was to investigate the effect of dietary potassium supplementation, 100 mmol daily in a randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover trial of healthy participants during two periods of 28 days duration. The participants (N = 21) received a diet that was standardized regarding energy requirement, and sodium and water intake.
24-hour ambulatory blood pressure (ABP) and applanation tonometry were used to assess blood pressure, pulse wave velocity (PWV), augmentation index (AIx) and central blood pressure (CBP). Immunoassays were used for measurements of plasma concentrations of vasoactive hormones: renin (PRC), angiotensin II (Ang II), aldosterone (Aldo), atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), vasopressin (AVP), pro-brain natriuretic peptide (pro-BNP),endothelin (Endo), urinary excretions of aquaporin 2 (AQP2), cyclic AMP (cAMP), and the β-fraction of the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC(ß)).
AQP2 excretion increased during potassium supplementation, and free water clearance fell. The changes in urinary potassium excretion and urinary AQP2 excretion were significantly and positively correlated. Aldo increased. GFR, u-ENaC- β, PRC, Ang II, ANP, BNP, Endo, blood pressure and AI were not significantly changed by potassium supplementation, whereas PWV increased slightly.
Potassium supplementation changed renal tubular function and increased water absorption in the distal part of the nephron. In spite of an increase in aldosterone in plasma, blood pressure remained unchanged after potassium supplementation.
Modified ultrafiltration (MUF) reduces some of the complications associated with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) in pediatric cardiac surgery. However, we have observed hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia in children when MUF is used. Such alterations may elicit severe arrhythmias in the postoperative period. To date, no studies have focused on the effects MUF may have in plasma levels of potassium (K) and magnesium (Mg). The objective of our study was to determine if there is any variation in plasma levels of K (plK) and Mg (plMg) after MUF in children undergoing cardiac surgery with CPB.
Sixteen children scheduled for cardiac surgery with CBP and MUF were prospectively studied. Anesthetic, CPB and MUF management were standardized for all patients, the latter lasting for 10 minutes.
Plasma K average levels before and after MUF were 4.16 mmol/L and 3.58 mmol/L, respectively. The average plasma Mg levels before and after MUF were 4.82 mmol/L and 4.81 mmol/L, respectively.
The plasma level of K is reduced by 13.7% after MUF (p&lt;0.0001). The reduction in Mg at the same period of time was not statistically significant (p&lt;0.970).
Different plant organelles have high internal stores of Ca(2+) compared to the cytoplasm and could play independent roles in stress responses or signal transduction. We used a GFP fusion with the C-domain of calreticulin, which shows low-affinity, high capacity Ca(2+) binding in the ER, as a calcium-binding peptide (CBP) to specifically increase stores in the ER and nucleus. Despite the presence of a signal sequence and KDEL retention sequence, our work and previous studies (Brandizzi et al. Plant Journal 34:269-281, 2003) demonstrated both ER and nuclear localization of GFP-CBP. Under normal conditions, GFP-CBP-expressing lines had ~25% more total Ca(2+) and higher levels of chlorophyll and seed yield than wild type and GFP controls. CBP-expressing plants also had better survival under intermittent drought or high salt treatments and increased root growth. One member of the CIPK (calcineurin B-like interacting protein kinase) gene family, CIPK6, was up-regulated in CBP-expressing plants, even under non-stress conditions. A null mutation in cipk6 abolished the increased stress tolerance of CBP-transgenic plants, as well as the CBP-mediated induction of two stress-associated genes, DREB1A and RD29A, under non-stress conditions. Although this suggested that it was the induction of CIPK6, rather than localized changes in Ca(2+), that resulted in increased survival under adverse conditions, CIPK6 induction still required Ca(2+). This work demonstrates that ER (or nuclear) Ca(2+) can directly participate in signal transduction to alter gene expression. The discovery of a method for increasing Ca(2+) levels without deleterious effects on plant growth may have practical applications.
Glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) are the major incretin hormones that exert insulinotropic and anti-apoptotic actions on pancreatic β-cells. Insulinotropic actions of the incretins involve modulation of voltage-gated potassium (Kv) channels. In multiple cell types, Kv channel activity has been implicated in cell volume changes accompanying initiation of the apoptotic program. Focusing on Kv2.1, we examined whether regulation of Kv channels in β-cells contributes to the prosurvival effects of incretins. Overexpression of Kv2.1 in INS-1 β-cells potentiated apoptosis in response to mitochondrial and ER stress and, conversely, co-stimulation with GIP/GLP-1 uncoupled this potentiation, suppressing apoptosis. In parallel, incretins promoted phosphorylation and acetylation of Kv2.1 via pathways involving protein kinase A (PKA)/mitogen- and stress-activated kinase-1 (MSK-1) and histone acetyltransferase (HAT)/histone deacetylase (HDAC). Further studies demonstrated that acetylation of Kv2.1 was mediated by incretin actions on nuclear/cytoplasmic shuttling of CREB binding protein (CBP) and its interaction with Kv2.1. Regulation of β-cell survival by GIP and GLP-1 therefore involves post-translational modifications (PTMs) of Kv channels by PKA/MSK-1 and HAT/HDAC. This appears to be the first demonstration of modulation of delayed rectifier Kv channels contributing to the β-cell prosurvival effects of incretins and of 7-transmembrane G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR)-stimulated export of a nuclear lysine acetyltransferase that regulates cell surface ion channel function.
Aldosterone-to-renin ratio (ARR) is used to screen primary hyperaldosteronism. We investigated the association between ARR and the prevalence of hypertension using home blood pressure (HBP) measurements in community residents stratified for long-term habitual dietary sodium intake. We obtained HBP and conventional blood pressure (CBP) data for 514 participants aged ≥35 years not receiving antihypertensive treatment in the general population of Ohasama (mean age: 59.7±10.8 years; 71.2% women). A standardized method was used to calculate habitual sodium intake from a food-frequency questionnaire. The prevalence of HBP hypertension (≥135/85 mmHg) and CBP hypertension (≥140/90 mmHg) were 12.6 and 20.2%, respectively. The median plasma renin activity (PRA), plasma aldosterone concentration (PAC) and ARR were 1.1 ngml(-1)h(-1), 6.4 ng per 100 ml and 5.5 ng per 100 ml per ngml(-1)h(-1), respectively. After adjustment for possible confounding factors, each 1 s.d. increase in logARR was associated with the prevalence of HBP hypertension (odds ratio 1.37; P=0.04), but not with the prevalence of CBP hypertension (P=0.2). The association of ARR with HBP hypertension was strengthened for subjects with high sodium intake (greater than or equal to the median of 4822 mgday(-1)), whereas it became nonsignificant for those with low sodium intake (interaction P=0.03). Among subjects with high sodium intake, HBP hypertensives had significantly lower PRA than normotensives, despite no differences in PAC. In conclusion, relative aldosterone excess or low-renin hypertension may have an important role in HBP hypertension in the general population with high sodium intake.
The mechanisms underlying hypercalciuria in pseudohypoaldosteronism type II (PHAII) caused by WNK4 mutations remain unclear. In this study, we used Wnk4(D561A/+) knock-in mice as a model of human PHAII for investigating the pathogenesis of hypercalciuria in PHAII. Serum and urine biochemistries were obtained from Wnk4(+/+) and Wnk4(D561A/+) littermates. Expression of the epithelial Ca(2+) channels [transient receptor potential channel vanilloid subtype 5 (TRPV5) and TRPV6] and calbindin-D28k (CBP-D28k) in the distal nephron and two upstream Na(+) transporters, Na(+)/H(+) exchanger 3 and Na(+)-K(+)-2Cl(-) cotransporter 2 involved in paracellular Ca(2+) reabsorption, were examined by real-time PCR, immunofluorescent staining, and immunoblotting. Compared with Wnk4(+/+) littermate controls, Wnk4(D561A/+) mice manifested hypercalciuria despite no significant differences in serum creatinine, ionized Ca(2+), PTH, and 1,25 hydroxylvitamin D(3) levels. There was no significant difference in TRPV5 expression, but a significant increase in TRPV6 and CBP-D28k was observed in Wnk4(D561A/+) mice. Despite no significant change in Na(+)/H(+) exchanger 3 expression, Na(+)-K(+)-2Cl(-) cotransporter 2 expression was significantly attenuated and urine Ca(2+) excretion rate in response to furosemide was blunted in Wnk4(D561A/+) mice. Decreased Ca(2+) reabsorption in the upstream nephron, especially in the thick ascending loops of Henle, with a secondary adaptive increase in TRPV6 and CBP-D28k expression in the distal tubules might be involved in the hypercalciuria of PHAII.
The new classification of malignant fibrous histiocytoma leaves only a small group of tumors without further line of differentiation, so-called pleomorphic sarcomas, not otherwise specified (NOS) as a pseudo-entity. This study focused on these tumors and analyzed the association of gene expression profiles to clinical outcome.
Ten fresh samples of pleomorphic NOS sarcomas were evaluated histopathologically and by means of microarray analysis. Analysis of expression profiles was performed by clustering methods as well as by statistical analysis of primary vs recurrent tumors, irradiated vs nonirradiated tumors, tumors of patients above and below 60 years of age, male and female, and of tumors that developed metastatic or recurrent disease during the clinical course and those that did not.
Tumor clustering did not correlate to any histopathological or clinical finding. Detailed gene expression analysis showed a variety of genes whose upregulation (platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha polypeptide, solute carrier family 39 member 14, solute carrier family 2 member 3, pleiotrophin, trophinin, pleckstrin and Sec7 domain containing 3, enolase 2, biglycan, SH3 and cysteine-rich domain, matrix metalloproteinases 16) and whose downregulation (tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 4, hairy/enhancer of split related with YRPW motif 2, protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor-type Z polypeptide 1, SH3 domain GRB2-like 2, microtubule-associated protein 7, potassium voltage-gated channel shaker-related subfamily member 1, RUN and FYVE domain containing 3, Sin3A-associated protein 18 kDa, proline-rich 4, calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase ID, myeloid/lymphoid or mixed-lineage leukemia translocated to 3, insulin-like growth factor binding protein 5, nucleoside diphosphate-linked moiety X-type motif 9, NudC domain containing 3, imprinted in Prader-Willi syndrome, TAF6-like RNA polymerase II p300/CBP-associated factor 65 kDa, WD repeat and SOCS box-containing 2, adenosine diphosphate ribosylation factor 3, KRR1, proliferation-associated 2G4; CD36, complement component (3b/4b) receptor 1, solute carrier family 4 sodium bicarbonate cotransporter member 4, lipoprotein lipase (LPL), GATA binding protein 3, LPL, glutathione peroxidase 3, D: -aspartate oxidase, apolipoprotein E, sphingomyelin phosphodiesterase acid-like 3A) were associated with poor clinical outcome in terms of development of metastatic or recurrent disease.
The classification of these tumors may undergo further changes in the future. Gene expression profiling can provide additional information to categorize pleomorphic sarcoma (NOS) and reveal potential prognostic factors in this "entity."
Using gene chip analyses, we have identified novel neuronal activity-dependent genes. Application of 25 mM KCl to mature (14-day culture) rat cortical neurons resulted in more than 1.5-fold induction of 19 genes and reduction of 42 genes among 1200 neural genes. Changes in the overall gene expression profiles appeared to be related to the reduction of excitability and induction of cellular survival signals. Among the genes identified, three transcriptional modulators [encoding Cbp/p300-interacting transactivator with ED-rich tail 2 (CITED2), CCAAT/enhancer binding protein beta (C/EBPbeta) and neuronal orphan receptor-1, (NOR1)] were newly identified as activity-dependent transcription factors, and two of these (CITED2 and NOR1) were found to be influenced by electroconvulsive shock (ECS). NOR1 was induced in specific brain regions by behavioral activation, such as exposure to a novel environment. Because the brain regions that exhibited the induction of these newly identified neuronal activity-dependent transcriptional modulators were distinct from those showing the induction of previously identified activity-dependent genes such as c-fos, these genes might be useful markers for mapping neuronal activity in vivo.
Since continuous blood purification (CBP) has the effects of eliminating inflammatory mediators and improving organs function, CBP had been applied to treat non-renal diseases for nearly 10 years, but few studies have been conducted in children with sepsis and multiorgan dysfunction syndrome (MODS), especially in China. The present study aimed to evaluate the clinical effect of CBP in treatment of children with severe sepsis and MODS.
Twenty-two children with severe sepsis and MODS admitted to our PICU from Aug. 2003 to Aug. 2005 were treated with continuous veno-venous hemodialysis filtration. Their heart rate, arterial blood pressure, doses of vasoactive agents, spontaneous respiratory rate, PO2/FiO2 and prognosis were investigated.
Catheterization and CBP were carried out in all the 22 children. Continuous vein-vein hemodialysis filtration (CVVHDF) and pre-dilution were chosen. The duration of CBP was (64.4 +/- 34.5) h. All the children had tachycardia before CBP and the heart rate fell gradually to 45 +/- 13 bpm 4 h after CBP. Blood pressure (BP) was stable in 7 children without shock during CBP. Ten children with early shock could maintain normal BP during CBP, but the doses of vasoactive agents were tapered 1 to 5 h after beginning of CBP and use of these agents was discontinued at 2 to 8 h. BP was elevated by (25.2 +/- 10.7) mmHg (1 mmHg = 0.133 kPa) in 5 refractorily shocked children 4 h after CBP and returned to normal level 8 h later. The doses of the vasoactive drugs were reduced at 2 to 8 h and ended 4 to 16 h later, which was longer than that of children with early stage shock. The accelerated spontaneous respiratory rate was slowed down by 7 +/- 4 per minute 4 h later, PO2/FiO2 rose from (177.7 +/- 53.1) mmHg before CBP to (341.0 +/- 60.2) mmHg 4 h after CBP in children with respiratory failure and reached the normal value (5.3 +/- 2.1) h later. FiO2 declined to less than 50%. Pediatric critical illness score was 62.2 +/- 7.4 on admission and elevated to (86.6 +/- 9.0) 24 h later, which was a significant elevation as compared to that of children with sepsis who were not treated with CBP seen between Aug. 2001 and July 2003. The survival rate was 72.7% after CBP and the effective rate of the treatment was 90.9%, but was 36% in children who were not treated with CVVHDF.
CBP can effectively improve the vital organ's function of children with sepsis and MODS and raise their survival rate. Replacement fluid of modified Ports formula was useful for stability of serum potassium and sodium, but resulted in elevation of serum glucose, calcium, and osmolarity. The application of CBP in children with sepsis can lead to slight drop of blood pressure at the beginning and to bleeding during CBP.
Transcription factors are known to interact with each other to modulate their transcriptional activity. In this study, we found that the transcriptional activity of human Erg (one of the Ets family-transcription factors) was repressed by several nuclear receptors, including human estrogen receptor ERalpha, nonsteroid receptors and orphan receptors. Conversely, Erg inhibited ERalpha-dependent transcription. These reciprocal functional interactions extended to other nuclear receptors such as thyroid hormone and retinoic acid receptors, as well as to Fli1, an ERG-related ETS factor. Although similarly inhibited by overexpression of the orphan nuclear receptors ERR1 and RORalpha, ERG activity was unaffected by either REV-ERBalpha1 or COUP-TFII. The antagonism between ERG and ERalpha did not depend on DNA binding inhibition or direct protein-protein interactions. Repression of ERalpha-dependent transcription required the carboxyterminal and aminoterminal transactivation domains of Erg whereas the carboxyterminal AF-2 domain of ERalpha was necessary for repression of Erg activity. Reciprocal inhibition between Erg and ERalpha was not alleviated by overexpressing CBP, SRC-1 or RIP 140, three nuclear coactivator proteins. A negative cross-talk observed between Erg and ERalpha expands their potential range of regulation and may be relevant in vivo, particularly in endothelial, urogenital and cartilaginous tissues where both factors are expressed.
Hole-surface charged body potential (CBP) measurements were taken over a 173-day period during a drip-injection, tracer experiment in partially saturated, fractured basalt. A continuous, enhanced conductivity, potassium chloride (KCl) solution was dripped into the fractured basalt and energized directly through a current electrode placed in the conductive solution. The constant concentration, KCl solution was introduced above a perched water table at an average rate of 10.07 L/day under a constant hydraulic head for 76 days. The KCl drip period was followed by a 34-day tap water drip period and a 62-day drainage period. Hole-surface CBP measurements were taken over time to delineate the evolution of the asymmetrical, vadose zone, plume. A 15 by 15 grid of land surface based, porous pot electrodes (copper sulfate), located symmetrically about the centrally located injection borehole, was used for the hole-surface CBP experiment. Ratios of electrical potentials measured at the land surface over time were contoured and profiled to delineate the evolution of the electrolyte plume.
Immediate early genes are expressed in the mammalian suprachiasmatic nucleus in response to photic information arriving from the retina at restricted times of the day, therefore their expression is regulated by the circadian biological clock. These light-induced genes are also activated by the phosphorylated form of CREB (pCREB) that binds to a cAMP response element upstream of the genes. The nuclear proteins CBP and p300 are known to be coactivators with pCREB in certain cell types, but their identification within the rodent SCN has not been reported. Therefore, in this study we examined the distribution of both CBP and p300 in the hamster suprachiasmatic nucleus. CBP and p300 immunoreactivity is detected in cells throughout the suprachiasmatic nucleus, and the pattern of staining within cells is indicative of a nuclear location for these proteins. The number of cells immunoreactive for both CBP and p300 significantly decreases at mid-night circadian times with respect to mid-day circadian times, although the reduction is less than 20%. Neither CBP nor p300 expression is affected by a circadian phase-resetting light pulse given late in the night. The ability of CBP and p300 to interact with pCREB as well as with the clock gene BMAL1 is discussed, and we propose that CBP and p300 may interact with, and link, both clock genes and clock-controlled genes in the generation of circadian rhythms in mammals. We further suggest that there will be a general importance for the role of transcriptional coactivators such as CBP and p300 in many of the molecular pathways related to the mammalian circadian clock.
