<!DOCTYPE html><html><head>	<meta charset="utf-8">	<title>generación de archivo html</title></head><body>An outbreak of Zika virus (ZIKV) infection has been reported in South and Central America and the Caribbean. Neonatal microcephaly potentially associated with ZIKV infection has already caused a public health emergency of international concern. Currently, there are no clinically effective vaccines or antiviral drugs available to treat ZIKV infection. The methyltransferase domain (MTase) of ZIKV nonstructural protein 5 (NS5) can sequentially methylate guanine N-7 and ribose 2'-O to form m7NGpppA2'Om cap structure in the new RNA transcripts. This methylation step is crucial for ZIKV replication cycle and evading the host immune system, making it a target for drug design. Here, we present the 1.76 Å crystal structure of ZIKV MTase in complex with the byproduct SAH, providing insight into the elegant methylation process, which will benefit the following antiviral drug development.
The Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) nonstructural protein 16 (nsp16) is an S-adenosyl-l-methionine (SAM)-dependent 2'-O-methyltransferase (2'-O-MTase) that is thought to methylate the ribose 2'-OH of the first transcribed nucleotide (N1) of viral RNA cap structures. This 2'-O-MTase activity is regulated by nsp10. The 2'-O methylation prevents virus detection by cell innate immunity mechanisms and viral translation inhibition by the interferon-stimulated IFIT-1 protein. To unravel the regulation of nsp10/nsp16 2'-O-MTase activity, we used purified MERS-CoV nsp16 and nsp10. First, we showed that nsp16 recruited N7-methylated capped RNA and SAM. The SAM binding promotes the assembly of the enzymatically active nsp10/nsp16 complex that converted 7mGpppG (cap-0) into 7mGpppG2'Om (cap-1) RNA by 2'-OH methylation of N1 in a SAM-dependent manner. The subsequent release of SAH speeds up nsp10/nsp16 dissociation that stimulates the reaction turnover. Alanine mutagenesis and RNA binding assays allowed the identification of the nsp16 residues involved in RNA recognition forming the RNA binding groove (K46, K170, E203, D133, R38, Y47, and Y181) and the cap-0 binding site (Y30, Y132, and H174). Finally, we found that nsp10/nsp16 2'-O-MTase activity is sensitive to known MTase inhibitors, such as sinefungin and cap analogues. This characterization of the MERS-CoV 2'-O-MTase is a preliminary step toward the development of molecules to inhibit cap 2'-O methylation and to restore the host antiviral response. IMPORTANCE MERS-CoV codes for a cap 2'-O-methyltransferase that converts cap-0 into cap-1 structure in order to prevent virus detection by cell innate immunity mechanisms. We report the biochemical properties of MERS-CoV 2'O-methyltransferase, which is stimulated by nsp10 acting as an allosteric activator of the nsp16 2'-O-methyltransferase possibly through enhanced RNA binding affinity. In addition, we show that SAM promotes the formation of the active nsp10/nsp16 complex. Conversely, after cap methylation, the reaction turnover is speeded up by cap-1 RNA release and nsp10/nsp16 complex dissociation, at the low intracellular SAH concentration. These results suggest that SAM/SAH balance is a regulator of the 2'-O-methyltransferase activity and raises the possibility that SAH hydrolase inhibitors might interfere with CoV replication cycle. The enzymatic and RNA binding assays developed in this work were also used to identify nsp16 residues involved in cap-0 RNA recognition and to understand the action mode of known methyltransferase inhibitors.
Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) is the most common etiological agent of epidemic viral encephalitis. JEV encodes a single methyltransferase (MTase) domain located at the N-terminal region of the viral nonstructural protein NS5. JEV MTase is essential for viral replication and specifically catalyzes methylation of the viral RNA cap, which occurs exclusively in the cytoplasm. Therefore, JEV MTase is a potential target for antiviral therapy. Here, we identified specific and avid RNA aptamer (Kd ∼ 12 nM) with modified 2'-O-methyl pyrimidines against JEV MTase. The RNA aptamer efficiently inhibited viral cap methylation activity of MTase and interfered with JEV production in cells. Moreover, we generated a 24-mer truncated aptamer that could specifically bind to JEV MTase with high affinity (Kd ∼16 nM). The 24-mer aptamer efficiently inhibited JEV production and replication in cells. Therefore, MTase-specific RNA aptamer might be useful as an anti-JEV agent.
The mRNA cap structure, which is added to nascent RNA pol II transcripts, recruits the protein complexes required for pre-mRNA transcript processing, mRNA export and translation initiation. The enzymes which catalyze mRNA cap synthesis are regulated by cellular signaling pathways which impact on their expression, localization and activity. Here we discuss the recent observation that the mRNA cap methyltransferase, RNMT, is phosphorylated on Thr-77 by CDK1-cyclin B1, which regulates its activity and the proteins with which it interacts. RNMT Thr-77 phosphorylation provides a burst of mRNA cap methyltransferase activity during early G1 phase at a time when transcription is reactivated following completion of the cell cycle. This co-ordination of transcription and mRNA capping makes an important contribution to gene expression in the cell; preventing RNMT Thr-77 phosphorylation inhibits cell proliferation. Here we discuss these findings and how mRNA cap synthesis may be regulated in other scenarios.
The Flavivirus Zika virus (ZIKV) is the causal agent of neurological disorders like microcephaly in newborns or Guillain-Barre syndrome. Its NS5 protein embeds a methyltransferase (MTase) domain involved in the formation of the viral mRNA cap. We investigated the structural and functional properties of the ZIKV MTase. We show that the ZIKV MTase can methylate RNA cap structures at the N-7 position of the cap, and at the 2'-O position on the ribose of the first nucleotide, yielding a cap-1 structure. In addition, the ZIKV MTase methylates the ribose 2'-O position of internal adenosines of RNA substrates. The crystal structure of the ZIKV MTase determined at a 2.01-Å resolution reveals a crystallographic homodimer. One chain is bound to the methyl donor (S-adenosyl-l-methionine [SAM]) and shows a high structural similarity to the dengue virus (DENV) MTase. The second chain lacks SAM and displays conformational changes in the αX α-helix contributing to the SAM and RNA binding. These conformational modifications reveal a possible molecular mechanism of the enzymatic turnover involving a conserved Ser/Arg motif. In the second chain, the SAM binding site accommodates a sulfate close to a glycerol that could serve as a basis for structure-based drug design. In addition, compounds known to inhibit the DENV MTase show similar inhibition potency on the ZIKV MTase. Altogether these results contribute to a better understanding of the ZIKV MTase, a central player in viral replication and host innate immune response, and lay the basis for the development of potential antiviral drugs.IMPORTANCE The Zika virus (ZIKV) is associated with microcephaly in newborns, and other neurological disorders such as Guillain-Barre syndrome. It is urgent to develop antiviral strategies inhibiting the viral replication. The ZIKV NS5 embeds a methyltransferase involved in the viral mRNA capping process, which is essential for viral replication and control of virus detection by innate immune mechanisms. We demonstrate that the ZIKV methyltransferase methylates the mRNA cap and adenosines located in RNA sequences. The structure of ZIKV methyltransferase shows high structural similarities to the dengue virus methyltransferase, but conformational specificities highlight the role of a conserved Ser/Arg motif, which participates in RNA and SAM recognition during the reaction turnover. In addition, the SAM binding site accommodates a sulfate and a glycerol, offering structural information to initiate structure-based drug design. Altogether, these results contribute to a better understanding of the Flavivirus methyltransferases, which are central players in the virus replication.
In eukaryotes, transcriptionally inactive loci are enriched within highly condensed heterochromatin. In plants, as in mammals, the DNA of heterochromatin is densely methylated and wrapped by histones displaying a characteristic subset of post-translational modifications. Growing evidence indicates that these chromatin modifications are not sufficient for silencing. Instead, they are prerequisites for further assembly of higher-order chromatin structures that are refractory to transcription but not fully understood. We show that silencing of transposons in the pericentromeric heterochromatin of Arabidopsis thaliana requires SMC4, a core subunit of condensins I and II, acting in conjunction with CG methylation by MET1 (DNA METHYLTRANSFERASE 1), CHG methylation by CMT3 (CHROMOMETHYLASE 3), the chromatin remodeler DDM1 (DECREASE IN DNA METHYLATION 1), and histone modifications, including histone H3 Lys 27 monomethylation (H3K27me1), imparted by ATXR5 and ATXR6. SMC4/condensin also acts within the mostly euchromatic chromosome arms to suppress conditionally expressed genes involved in flowering or DNA repair, including the DNA glycosylase ROS1, which facilitates DNA demethylation. Collectively, our genome-wide analyses implicate condensin in the suppression of hundreds of loci, acting in both DNA methylation-dependent and methylation-independent pathways.
Two highly pathogenic human coronaviruses associated with severe respiratory syndromes emerged since the beginning of the century. The severe acute respiratory syndrome SARS-coronavirus (CoV) spread first in southern China in 2003 with about 8000 infected cases in few months. Then in 2012, the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV) emerged from the Arabian Peninsula giving a still on-going epidemic associated to a high fatality rate. CoVs are thus considered a major health threat. This is especially true as no vaccine nor specific therapeutic are available against either SARS- or MERS-CoV. Therefore, new drugs need to be identified in order to develop antiviral treatments limiting CoV replication. In this study, we focus on the nsp14 protein, which plays a key role in virus replication as it methylates the RNA cap structure at the N7 position of the guanine. We developed a high-throughput N7-MTase assay based on Homogenous Time Resolved Fluorescence (HTRF®) and screened chemical libraries (2000 compounds) on the SARS-CoV nsp14. 20 compounds inhibiting the SARS-CoV nsp14 were further evaluated by IC50 determination and their specificity was assessed toward flavivirus- and human cap N7-MTases. Our results reveal three classes of compounds: 1) molecules inhibiting several MTases as well as the dengue virus polymerase activity unspecifically, 2) pan MTases inhibitors targeting both viral and cellular MTases, and 3) inhibitors targeting one viral MTase more specifically showing however activity against the human cap N7-MTase. These compounds provide a first basis towards the development of more specific inhibitors of viral methyltransferases.
The Zika virus (ZIKV) has emerged as a major health hazard. We present here a high resolution structure (1.55 Å) of ZIKV NS5 methyltransferase bound to a novel S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) analog in which a 4-fluorophenyl moiety substitutes for the methyl group. We show that the 4-fluorophenyl moiety extends into a portion of the RNA binding tunnel that typically contains the adenosine 2'OH of the RNA-cap moiety. Together, the new SAM analog and the high-resolution crystal structure are a step towards the development of antivirals against ZIKV and other flaviviruses.
Gene expression can be post-transcriptionally regulated via dynamic and reversible RNA modifications. N1-methyladenosine (m1A) is a recently identified mRNA modification; however, little is known about its precise location and biogenesis. Here, we develop a base-resolution m1A profiling method, based on m1A-induced misincorporation during reverse transcription, and report distinct classes of m1A methylome in the human transcriptome. m1A in 5' UTR, particularly those at the mRNA cap, associate with increased translation efficiency. A different, small subset of m1A exhibit a GUUCRA tRNA-like motif, are evenly distributed in the transcriptome, and are dependent on the methyltransferase TRMT6/61A. Additionally, we show that m1A is prevalent in the mitochondrial-encoded transcripts. Manipulation of m1A level via TRMT61B, a mitochondria-localizing m1A methyltransferase, demonstrates that m1A in mitochondrial mRNA interferes with translation. Collectively, our approaches reveal distinct classes of m1A methylome and provide a resource for functional studies of m1A-mediated epitranscriptomic regulation.
Several selenoprotein mRNAs undergo 5' cap maturation events whereby their classical monomethylated m7G cap becomes trimethylated (m32,2,7G) by the trimethylguanosine synthase 1 (Tgs1). Here, we describe immunoprecipitation methods for the detection of endogenous m32,2,7G-capped selenoprotein mRNAs from total cell extracts or after polysome fractionation of cytoplasmic extracts. We have also developed a method for the in vitro cap hypermethylation of selenoprotein mRNA transcripts using purified Tgs1 enzyme.
The oncogene E2a-Pbx1 is formed by the t(1;19) translocation, which joins the N-terminal transactivation domain of E2a with the C-terminal homeodomain of PBX1. The goal of this work was to elucidate the mechanisms by which E2a-Pbx1 can lead to deregulated target gene expression. For reporter constructs it was shown that E2a-Pbx1 can activate transcription through homodimer elements (TGATTGAT) or through heterodimer elements with Hox proteins (e.g. TGATTAAT). We show a novel mechanism by which E2a-Pbx1 activates transcription of EF-9 using a promoter in intron 1 of the EF-9 gene, resulting in an aminoterminal truncated transcript. Our results indicate that the LDFS motif of E2a is essential for the transactivation of EF-9, but dispensable for transactivation of fibroblast growth factor 15. The E2a LDFS motif was also essential for proliferation of NIH3T3 fibroblasts but was dispensable for the E2a-Pbx1-induced differentiation arrest of myeloid progenitors.
Homeobox (hox) proteins have been shown to regulate cell fate and segment identity by promoting the expression of specific genetic programs. In contrast to their restricted biological action in vivo, however, most homeodomain factors exhibit promiscuous DNA binding properties in vitro, suggesting a requirement for additional cofactors that enhance target site selectivity. In this regard, the pbx family of homeobox genes has been found to heterodimerize with and thereby augment the DNA binding activity of certain hox proteins on a subset of potential target sites. Here we examine the transcriptional properties of a forced hox-pbx heterodimer containing the pancreas-specific orphan homeobox factor pdx fused to pbx-1a. Compared to the pdx monomer, the forced pdx-pbx1a dimer, displayed 10- to 20-fold-higher affinity for a consensus hox-pbx binding site but was completely unable to bind a hox monomer recognition site. The pdx-pbx dimer stimulated target gene expression via an N-terminal trans-activation domain in pdx that interacts with the coactivator CREB binding protein. The pdx-pbx dimer was also found to repress transcription via a C-terminal domain in pbx-1a that associates with the corepressors SMRT and NCoR. The transcriptional properties of the pdx-pbx1 complex appear to be regulated at the level of alternative splicing; a pdx-pbx polypeptide containing the pbx1b isoform, which lacks the C-terminal extension in pbx1a, was unable to repress target gene expression via NCoR-SMRT. Since pbx1a and pbx1b are differentially expressed in endocrine versus exocrine compartments of the adult pancreas, our results illustrate a novel mechanism by which pbx proteins may modulate the expression of specific genetic programs, either positively or negatively, during development.
In roughly 5% of cases of acute lymphoblastic leukemia, a chromosomal translocation leads to expression of the oncogenic protein E2A-PBX1. The N-terminal portion of E2A-PBX1, encoded by the E2A gene, is identical in sequence to the corresponding portion of the E proteins E12/E47 and includes transcriptional activation domains. The C terminus consists of most of the HOX interacting transcription factor PBX1, including its DNA-binding homeodomain. Structure-function correlative experiments have suggested that oncogenesis by E2A-PBX1 requires an activation domain, called AD1, at the extreme N terminus. We recently demonstrated that a potentially helical portion of AD1 interacts directly with the transcriptional coactivator protein cyclic AMP response element-binding protein (CBP) and that this interaction is essential in the immortalization of primary bone marrow cells in tissue culture. Here we show that a conserved LXXLL motif within AD1 is required in the interaction between E2A-PBX1 and the KIX domain of CBP. We show by circular dichroism spectroscopy that the LXXLL-containing portion of AD1 undergoes a helical transition upon interacting with the KIX domain and that amino acid substitutions that prevent helix formation prevent both the KIX interaction and cell immortalization by E2A-PBX1. Perhaps most strikingly, substitution of a single, conserved leucine residue (L20) within the LXXLL motif impairs leukemia induction in mice after transplantation with E2A-PBX1-expressing bone marrow. The KIX domain of CBP mediates well-characterized interactions with several transcription factors of relevance to leukemia induction. Circumstantial evidence suggests that the side chain of L20 might interact with a deep hydrophobic pocket in the KIX domain. Therefore, our results serve to identify a potential new drug target.
The E2A gene encodes the E-protein transcription factors E12 and E47 that play critical roles in B-lymphopoiesis. A somatic chromosomal translocation detectable in 5% of cases of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) involves E2A and results in expression of the oncogenic transcription factor E2A-PBX1. CREB binding protein (CBP) and its close paralog p300 are transcriptional co-activators with intrinsic histone acetyltransferase (HAT) activity. We and others have shown that direct binding of an N-terminal transcriptional activation domain present in E12/E47 and E2A-PBX1 to the KIX domain of CBP/p300 contributes to E2A protein function. In the current work we show for the first time that the catalytic HAT activity of CBP/p300 is increased in the presence of residues 1-483 of E2A (i.e., the portion present in E2A-PBX1). The addition of purified, recombinant E2A protein to in vitro assays results in a two-fold augmentation of CBP/p300 HAT activity, whereas in vivo assays show a ten-fold augmentation of HAT-dependent transcriptional induction and a five-fold augmentation of acetylation of reporter plasmid-associated histone by CBP in response to co-transfected E2A. Our results indicate that the HAT-enhancing effect is independent of the well-documented E2A-CBP interaction involving the KIX domain and suggest a role for direct, perhaps low affinity binding of E2A to a portion of CBP that includes the HAT domain and flanking elements. Our findings add to a growing body of literature indicating that interactions between CBP/p300 and transcription factors can function in a specific manner to modulate HAT catalytic activity.
E-proteins are critical transcription factors in B-cell lymphopoiesis. E2A, 1 of 3 E-protein-encoding genes, is implicated in the induction of acute lymphoblastic leukemia through its involvement in the chromosomal translocation 1;19 and consequent expression of the E2A-PBX1 oncoprotein. An interaction involving a region within the N-terminal transcriptional activation domain of E2A-PBX1, termed the PCET motif, which has previously been implicated in E-protein silencing, and the KIX domain of the transcriptional coactivator CBP/p300, critical for leukemogenesis. However, the structural details of this interaction remain unknown. Here we report the structure of a 1:1 complex between PCET motif peptide and the KIX domain. Residues throughout the helical PCET motif that contact the KIX domain are important for both binding KIX and bone marrow immortalization by E2A-PBX1. These results provide molecular insights into E-protein-driven differentiation of B-cells and the mechanism of E-protein silencing, and reveal the PCET/KIX interaction as a therapeutic target for E2A-PBX1-induced leukemia.
A major mechanism of cellular resistance to viral invasion involves genes from the interferon signaling pathway, called ISGs (interferon stimulated genes). Global transcriptional profiling studies have linked increased expression of ISG95 (KIAA0082) to response to interferon treatment and viral infection, suggesting that it may be part of the cellular defense against viral replication. In this work, we show that the ISG95 promoter can drive interferon-induced transcription of a reporter gene in Vero cells. Recombinant ISG95 shows RNA- and S-adenosyl-methionine binding and protein methyltransferase activity in vitro. ISG95 interacts with the C-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II, which is consistent with its nuclear localization and with the predicted function of the WW domain found in the C-terminal region of ISG95. The results presented in this work indicate that ISG95 is part of the interferon response pathway and functions in the pre-mRNA processing events mediated by the C-terminal domain of the RNA polymerase II.
Chimeric transcription factor E2A-PBX1 induces the development of acute lymphoblastic B-cell leukemia in children. Using a transgenic mouse model, we previously demonstrated that homeobox (HOX) gene HOXA9 genetically interact with E2A-PBX1 gene in the development of B-cell leukemia in mice. HOXA9 itself is a potent oncogene resulting in myeloid leukemia when overexpressed, which is strongly accelerated by its collaborator Meis1. HOX, PBX1 and MEIS1 proteins have been shown to form hetero dimeric or trimeric complexes in different combinations. Cooperative interaction between PBX1 and HOX proteins enhances their DNA binding specificity, essential for HOX dependent developmental programs. PBX1 is retained in E2A-PBX1, and thus the strong transcriptional activator properties of E2A-PBX1 may lead to aberrant activation of normally repressed targets of HOX-PBX complexes. However, although there is evidence that E2A-PBX1 could bind to HOX and MEIS1 proteins it is still unclear whether such complexes are actually required for leukemic transformation or whether E2A-PBX1 and HOXA9 are each part of larger protein complexes acting in independent complementing oncogenic pathways. In this study we aim to search for other HOXA9 and E2A-PBX1 interacting proteins. To identify novel proteins interacting with human E2A-PBX1 or HOXA9 we used tandem affinity purification (TAP) of protein complexes from 697 pre-B leukemic and HeLa cell lines transduced to express E2A-PBX1 or HOXA9, respectively, with covalently attached FLAG/HA peptides. The protein composition of each complex was determined using tandem mass-spectrometry. In the E2A-PBX1 containing complex we identified lymphoid transcription factor IKAROS, chromatin remodeling factors of SWI/SNF family while multiple subunits of translation initiation factor eIF3, E3 ubiquitin ligase UBR5 emerged from the HOXA9 complex as potential critical protein partners. This is the first time the protein partners of either E2A-PBX1 or HOXA9 oncoproteins were identified using an unbiased biochemical approach. The identification of translation initiation factors associated with HOXA9 might indicate a novel function for HOX proteins independent of their transcriptional activity.
Congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract (CAKUT) occur in three to six of 1000 live births, represent about 20% of the prenatally detected anomalies, and constitute the main cause of CKD in children. These disorders are phenotypically and genetically heterogeneous. Monogenic causes of CAKUT in humans and mice have been identified. However, despite high-throughput sequencing studies, the cause of the disease remains unknown in most patients, and several studies support more complex inheritance and the role of environmental factors and/or epigenetics in the pathophysiology of CAKUT. Here, we report the targeted exome sequencing of 330 genes, including genes known to be involved in CAKUT and candidate genes, in a cohort of 204 unrelated patients with CAKUT; 45% of the patients were severe fetal cases. We identified pathogenic mutations in 36 of 204 (17.6%) patients. These mutations included five de novo heterozygous loss of function mutations/deletions in the PBX homeobox 1 gene (PBX1), a gene known to have a crucial role in kidney development. In contrast, the frequency of SOX17 and DSTYK variants recently reported as pathogenic in CAKUT did not indicate causality. These findings suggest that PBX1 is involved in monogenic CAKUT in humans and call into question the role of some gene variants recently reported as pathogenic in CAKUT. Targeted exome sequencing also proved to be an efficient and cost-effective strategy to identify pathogenic mutations and deletions in known CAKUT genes.
This study aimed to explore the role of miR-320a in the pathogenesis of osteoarthritis (OA).
Human cartilage cells (C28/I2) were transfected with miR-320a or antisense oligonucleotides (ASO)-miR-320a, and treated with IL-1β. Subsequently the expression of collagen type II alpha 1 (Col2α1) and aggrecan (ACAN), and the concentrations of sulfated glycosaminoglycans (sGAG) and matrix metallopeptidase 13 (MMP-13), were assessed. Luciferase reporter assay, qRT-PCR, and Western blot were performed to explore whether pre-B-cell leukemia Homeobox 3 (PBX3) was a target of miR-320a. Furthermore, cells were co-transfected with miR-320a and PBX3 expressing vector, or cells were transfected with miR-320a and treated with a nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) antagonist MG132. The changes in Col2α1 and ACAN expression, and in sGAG and MMP-13 concentrations, were measured again. Statistical comparisons were made between two groups by using the two-tailed paired t-test.
Expression of miR-320a was elevated in OA cartilage tissues and chondrocytes, and in IL-1β-stimulated C28/I2 cells (p &lt; 0.05 or p &lt; 0.01). MiR-320a overexpression enhanced IL-1β-induced down-regulation of Col2α1 and ACAN and sGAG, and increased the IL-1β-induced overexpression of MMP-13 (p &lt; 0.01). PBX3 was a direct target of miR-320a. PBX3 and MG132 co-transfection attenuated the effects of miR-320a on the expression of Col2α1, ACAN, sGAG and MMP-13(p &lt; 0.01).
Overexpression of miR-320a might enhance IL-1β-induced cartilage degradation factors. These effects might be via targeting PBX3 and regulating NF-κB.Cite this article: Y. Jin, X. Chen, Z. Y. Gao, K.

Risk biomarkers for estrogen receptor (ER)-negative breast cancer have clear value for breast cancer prevention. We previously reported a set of lipid metabolism (LiMe) genes with high expression in the contralateral unaffected breasts (CUBs) of ER-negative cancer cases. We now further examine LiMe gene expression in both tumor and CUB, and investigate the role of Pre-B-cell leukemia homeobox-1 (PBX1) as a candidate common transcription factor for LiMe gene expression. mRNA was extracted from laser-capture microdissected epithelium from tumor and CUB of 84 subjects (28 ER-positive cases, 28 ER-negative cases, 28 healthy controls). Gene expression was quantitated by qRT-PCR. Logistic regression models were generated to predict ER status of the contralateral cancer. Protein expression of HMGCS2 and PBX1 was measured using immunohistochemistry. The effect of PBX1 on LiMe gene expression was examined by overexpressing PBX1 in MCF10A cells with or without ER, and by suppressing PBX1 in MDA-MB-453 cells. The expression of DHRS2, HMGCS2, UGT2B7, UGT2B11, ALOX15B, HPGD, UGT2B28 and GLYATL1 was significantly higher in ER-negative versus ER-positive CUBs, and predicted ER status of the tumor in test and validation sets. In contrast, LiMe gene expression was significantly lower in ER-negative than ER-positive tumors. PBX1 overexpression in MCF10A cells up-regulated most LiMe genes, but not in MCF10A cells overexpressing ER. Suppressing PBX1 in MDA-MB-453 cells resulted in decrease of LiMe gene expression. Four binding sites of PBX1 and cofactor were identified in three lipid metabolism genes using ChIP-qPCR. These data suggest a novel role for PBX1 in the regulation of lipid metabolism genes in benign breast, which may contribute to ER-negative tumorigenesis.
Pre-B-cell leukemia homeobox 1 (PBX1) was originally identified as a proto-oncogene in human leukemia. Although this protein has been shown to contribute to cellular development and tumorigenesis, the role of PBX1 in gastric carcinoma (GC) remains unclear. In this study, we observed increased expression of PBX1 in GC tissues compared with adjacent normal tissues. This increase in PBX1 expression levels negatively correlated with HOXB9 mRNA expression and was also associated with malignancy and metastasis. PBX1 promoted proliferation and metastasis of GC cells both in vitro and in vivo.These phenomena were also accompanied by epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Additionally, we observed that PBX1 promotes the expression of tumor growth and angiogenic factors. A structural model of the PBX1-HOX complex revealed that hydrophobic binding between PBX1 and the hexapeptide motif might be required for EMT induction. This analysis also demonstrated that the Phe252 residue in the first helix of the TALE homeodomain is involved in the latter hydrophobic binding reaction. In vitro data from PBX1 mutants suggest that PBX1 cannot promote tumorigenesis of GC cells via EMT induction when Phe252 residues lose hydrophobicity. It is likely that the presence of this residue is essential in facilitating hydrophobic binding with the hexapeptide motif. These findings suggest that PBX1 may be a potential target for GC treatment and this study provides a platform to elucidate the molecular mechanisms that underpin the role of PBX1 in GC tumorigenesis.
Esophageal cancer (EC) was one of the most lethal malignancies worldwide with intricate mechanisms. Here we reported that Forkhead box C1 (FoxC1), a member of the forkhead family transcription factors, was up-regulated in EC tissues and cell lines in comparison with controls. FoxC1 levels were negatively correlated with tumor stage, lymph node metastasis and survival status of EC patients. Knockdown of FoxC1 inhibited the proliferation, colony formation and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of EC cells, while overexpression of FoxC1 promoted these biological behaviors. Mechanically, serial deletion and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays showed that ZEB2, a well-reported transcriptional suppressor of E-cadherin, was a direct transcriptional target of FoxC1. Moreover, FoxC1 was recruited to the ZEB2 promoter by its interaction with the pioneer transcription factor pre-B-cell leukemia homeobox 1 (PBX1). Importantly, significant correlation between levels of FoxC1 and ZEB2 was observed in EC tissues and the two proteins could be used as prognostic biomarkers together. Hence, our results revealed a critical role of FoxC1 in the EMT process of EC and uncovered a novel mechanism for the regulation of ZEB2-E-cadherin axis in EC.
Long non-coding RNA urothelial carcinoma associated 1 (lncRNA UCA1) has gained more attention in recent years due to its oncogenic roles in various cancers. MicroRNA-144 (miR-144) participates in the regulation of many cancer cells growth. This study investigated the interaction between lncRNA UCA1 and miR-144 in lung cancer cells. The potential downstream protein of miR-144 was also assessed. Our results found that lncRNA UCA1 was highly expressed in human lung cancer A549, H517, H4006, H1299 and H1650 cells compared to normal embryonic lung WI-38 and HEL-1 cells. Knockdown of lncRNA UCA1 significantly inhibited lung cancer A549 cell viability, migration, invasion and cell cycle progression, but promoted cell apoptosis. Besides, we found that lncRNA UCA1 was bound to miR-144. miR-144 participated in the regulation effects of lncRNA UCA1 on A549 cell viability, migrataion, invasion, cell cycle transition and cell apoptosis. In addition Pre-B cell leukemia homeobox 3 (PBX3) was found to be a direct target gene of miR-144. Overexpression of PBX3 promoted A549 cell proliferation and metastasis. Suppression of PBX3 had an opposite effects.
Pre-B-cell leukemia homeobox (PBX) and myeloid ecotropic viral integration site (MEIS) proteins control cell fate decisions in many physiological and pathophysiological contexts, but how these proteins function mechanistically remains poorly defined. Focusing on the first hours of neuronal differentiation of adult subventricular zone-derived stem/progenitor cells, we describe a sequence of events by which PBX-MEIS facilitates chromatin accessibility of transcriptionally inactive genes: In undifferentiated cells, PBX1 is bound to the H1-compacted promoter/proximal enhancer of the neuron-specific gene doublecortin (Dcx) Once differentiation is induced, MEIS associates with chromatin-bound PBX1, recruits PARP1/ARTD1, and initiates PARP1-mediated eviction of H1 from the chromatin fiber. These results for the first time link MEIS proteins to PARP-regulated chromatin dynamics and provide a mechanistic basis to explain the profound cellular changes elicited by these proteins.
Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are transcripts longer than 200 bp with no protein-coding capacity. Transcribed ultraconserved regions (T-UCRs) are a type of lncRNA and are conserved among human, chick, dog, mouse and rat genomes. These sequences are involved in cancer biology and tumourigenesis. Nevertheless, the clinical significance and biological mechanism of T-UCRs in breast cancer remain largely unknown. The expression of uc.38, a T-UCR, was down-regulated in both breast cancer tissues and breast cancer cell lines. However, uc.38 was expressed at significantly lower levels in larger tumours and tumours of more advanced stages. Based on the results of in vitro and in vivo experiments, up-regulation of uc.38 expression inhibited cell proliferation and induced cell apoptosis. Thus, uc.38 suppressed breast cancer. Additional experiments revealed that uc.38 negatively regulated the expression of the pre-B-cell leukaemia homeobox 1 (PBX1) protein and subsequently affected the expression of Bcl-2 family members, ultimately inducing breast cancer cell apoptosis. Describing the uc.38/PBX1 axis has improved our understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in breast cancer apoptosis and has suggested that this axis is a potential therapeutic target for breast cancer.
MiR-320 is downregulated in multiple cancers, including glioma and acts as tumor suppressor through inhibiting tumor cells proliferation and inducing apoptosis. PBX3 (Pre-B cell leukemia homeobox 3), a putative target gene of miR-320, has been reported to be upregulated in various tumors and promote tumor cell growth through regulating MAKP/ERK pathway. This study aimed to verify whether miR-320 influences glioma cells growth through regulating PBX3.
Twenty-four human glioma and paired adjacent nontumorous tissues were collected for determination of miR-320 and PBX3 expression using RT-qPCR and western blot assays. Luciferase reporter assay was performed to verify the interaction between miR-320 and its targeting sequence in the 3' UTR of PBX3 in glioma cells U87 and U251. Increased miR-320 level in U87 and U251 cells was achieved through miR-320 mimic transfection and the effect of which on glioma cells growth, proliferation, cell cycle, apoptosis and activation of Raf-1/MAPK pathway was determined using MTT, colony formation, flow cytometry and western blot assays. PBX3 knockdown was performed using shPBX3 and the influence on MAPK pathway activation was evaluated.
MiR-320 downregulation and PBX3 upregulation was found in glioma tissues. Luciferase reporter assays identified miR-320 directly blinds to the 3' UTR of PBX3 in glioma cells. MiR-320 mimic transfection suppressed glioma cells proliferation, and induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Both miR-320 overexpression and PBX3 knockdown inhibited Raf-1/MAPK activation.
MiR-320 may suppress glioma cells growth and induced apoptosis through the PBX3/Raf-1/MAPK axis, and miR-320 oligonucleotides may be a potential cancer therapeutic for glioma.
Cellular eukaryotic mRNAs are capped at their 5' ends with a 7-methylguanosine nucleotide, a structural feature that has been shown to be important for conferring mRNA stability, stimulating mRNA biogenesis (splicing, poly(A) addition, nucleocytoplasmic transport), and increasing translational efficiency. Whereas yeast mRNAs have no additional modifications to the cap, called cap0, higher eukaryotes are methylated at the 2'-O-ribose of the first or the first and second transcribed nucleotides, called cap1 and cap2, respectively. In the present study, we identify the methyltransferase responsible for cap1 formation in human cells, which we call hMTr1 (also known as FTSJD2 and ISG95). We show in vitro that hMTr1 catalyzes specific methylation of the 2'-O-ribose of the first nucleotide of a capped RNA transcript. Using siRNA-mediated knockdown of hMTr1 in HeLa cells, we demonstrate that hMTr1 is responsible for cap1 formation in vivo.
Activating mutations in PIK3CA, the gene encoding phosphoinositide-(3)-kinase α (PI3Kα), are frequently found in estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer. PI3Kα inhibitors, now in late-stage clinical development, elicit a robust compensatory increase in ER-dependent transcription that limits therapeutic efficacy. We investigated the chromatin-based mechanisms leading to the activation of ER upon PI3Kα inhibition. We found that PI3Kα inhibition mediates an open chromatin state at the ER target loci in breast cancer models and clinical samples. KMT2D, a histone H3 lysine 4 methyltransferase, is required for FOXA1, PBX1, and ER recruitment and activation. AKT binds and phosphorylates KMT2D, attenuating methyltransferase activity and ER function, whereas PI3Kα inhibition enhances KMT2D activity. These findings uncover a mechanism that controls the activation of ER by the posttranslational modification of epigenetic regulators, providing a rationale for epigenetic therapy in ER-positive breast cancer.
Congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract (CAKUT) represent a significant healthcare burden since it is the primary cause of chronic kidney in children. CNVs represent a recurrent molecular cause of CAKUT but the culprit gene remains often elusive. Our study aimed to define the gene responsible for CAKUT in patients with an 1q23.3q24.1 microdeletion.
We describe eight patients presenting with CAKUT carrying an 1q23.3q24.1 microdeletion as identified by chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA). Clinical features were collected, especially the renal and urinary tract phenotype, and extrarenal features. We characterised PBX1 expression and localisation in fetal and adult kidneys using quantitative RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry.
We defined a 276-kb minimal common region (MCR) that only overlaps with the PBX1 gene. All eight patients presented with syndromic CAKUT. CAKUT were mostly bilateral renal hypoplasia (75%). The most frequent extrarenal symptoms were developmental delay and ear malformations. We demonstrate that PBX1 is strongly expressed in fetal kidneys and brain and expression levels decreased in adult samples. In control fetal kidneys, PBX1 was localised in nuclei of medullary, interstitial and mesenchymal cells, whereas it was present in endothelial cells in adult kidneys.
Our results indicate that PBX1 haploinsufficiency leads to syndromic CAKUT as supported by the Pbx1-null mice model. Correct PBX1 dosage appears to be critical for normal nephrogenesis and seems important for brain development in humans. CMA should be recommended in cases of fetal renal anomalies to improve genetic counselling and pregnancy management.
Epigenetic mechanisms are believed to play key roles in the establishment of cell-specific transcription programs. Accordingly, the modified bases 5-methylcytosine (5mC) and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) have been observed in DNA of genomic regulatory regions such as enhancers, and oxidation of 5mC into 5hmC by Ten-eleven translocation (TET) proteins correlates with enhancer activation. However, the functional relationship between cytosine modifications and the chromatin architecture of enhancers remains elusive. To gain insights into their function, 5mC and 5hmC levels were perturbed by inhibiting DNA methyltransferases and TETs during differentiation of mouse embryonal carcinoma cells into neural progenitors, and chromatin characteristics of enhancers bound by the pioneer transcription factors FOXA1, MEIS1, and PBX1 were interrogated. In a large fraction of the tested enhancers, inhibition of DNA methylation was associated with a significant increase in monomethylation of H3K4, a characteristic mark of enhancer priming. In addition, at some specific enhancers, 5mC oxidation by TETs facilitated chromatin opening, a process that may stabilize MEIS1 binding to these genomic regions.
To clarify the mechanisms of connexin 32 (Cx32) downregulation by potential transcriptional factors (TFs) in Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori)-associated gastric carcinogenesis.
Approximately 25 specimens at each developmental stage of gastric carcinogenesis [non-atrophic gastritis, chronic atrophic gastritis, intestinal metaplasia, dysplasia and gastric carcinoma (GC)] with H. pylori infection [H. pylori (+)] and 25 normal gastric mucosa (NGM) without H. pylori infection [H. pylori (-)] were collected. After transcriptional factor array analysis, the Cx32 and PBX1 expression levels of H. pylori-infected tissues from the developmental stages of GC and NGM with no H. pylori infection were measured by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Western blot analysis. Regarding H. pylori-infected animal models, the Cx32 and PBX1 mRNA expression levels and correlation between the gastric mucosa from 10 Mongolian gerbils with long-term H. pylori colonization and 10 controls were analyzed. PBX1 and Cx32 mRNA and protein levels were further studied under the H. pylori-infected condition as well as PBX1 overexpression and knockdown conditions in vitro.
Incremental PBX1 was first detected by TF microarray in H. pylori-related gastric carcinogenesis. The identical trend of PBX1 and Cx32 expression was confirmed in the developmental stages of H. pylori-related clinical specimens. The negative correlation of PBX1 and Cx32 was confirmed in H. pylori-infected Mongolian gerbils. Furthermore, decreased PBX1 expression was detected in the normal gastric epithelial cell line GES-1 with H. pylori infection. Enforced overexpression or RNAi-mediated knockdown of PBX1 contributed to the diminished or restored Cx32 expression in GES-1 and the gastric carcinoma cell line BGC823, respectively. Finally, dual-luciferase reporter assay in HEK293T cells showed that Cx32 promoter activity decreased by 30% after PBX1 vector co-transfection, indicating PBX1 as a transcriptional downregulator of Cx32 by directly binding to its promoters.
PBX1 is one of the determinants in the Cx32 promoter targeting site, preventing further damage of gap junction protein in H. pylori-associated gastric carcinogenesis.
Human cleft lip with or without cleft palate (CL/P) is a common craniofacial abnormality caused by impaired fusion of the facial prominences. We have previously reported that, in the mouse embryo, epithelial apoptosis mediates fusion at the seam where the prominences coalesce. Here, we show that apoptosis alone is not sufficient to remove the epithelial layers. We observed morphological changes in the seam epithelia, intermingling of cells of epithelial descent into the mesenchyme and molecular signatures of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Utilizing mouse lines with cephalic epithelium-specific Pbx loss exhibiting CL/P, we demonstrate that these cellular behaviors are Pbx dependent, as is the transcriptional regulation of the EMT driver Snail1. Furthermore, in the embryo, the majority of epithelial cells expressing high levels of Snail1 do not undergo apoptosis. Pbx1 loss- and gain-of-function in a tractable epithelial culture system revealed that Pbx1 is both necessary and sufficient for EMT induction. This study establishes that Pbx-dependent EMT programs mediate murine upper lip/primary palate morphogenesis and fusion via regulation of Snail1. Of note, the EMT signatures observed in the embryo are mirrored in the epithelial culture system.
In previous studies, TUC40-, a new long noncoding RNA, was found to be overexpressed in human ventricular septal defect (VSD) embryonic heart samples. In this article, we carried out experiments on the P19 cell line to elucidate the effects of TUC40- overexpression on cardiomyocyte development relevant to VSD pathogenesis.
We established the overexpression cell model by plasmid transfection, and explored the expression profile of Pbx1, the sense gene of TUC40-, and the marker genes of cardiomyocyte linage commitment (Nkx2.5 and GATA4) and maturation (cardiac troponin T). In addition, we combined cell cycle and Cell Counting Kit-8 analysis to detect cell proliferation and used flow cytometry and caspase-3 assays to test apoptosis. At last, bioinformatics analysis was performed to show the possible role of TUC40-.
In the control group, Pbx1 elevated steadily during cardiomyocyte induction; whereas in the overexpression group, it showed significantly lower expression at day 6, 8 and 10 of induction. Cells in the overexpression group failed to induce cardiomyocytes indicated by GATA4 and cardiac troponin T. Proliferation was inhibited possibly owing to G2/M cell cycle arrest and the induced apoptosis rate was higher in the overexpression group.
TUC40- overexpression reduced Pbx1 expression, cardiomyocyte induction and differentiation, inhibited proliferation and promoted apoptosis. Combining the results and previous studies, we propose TUC40- as a potential pathologic factor for VSD.
E2A-PBX1 fusion gene caused by t(1;19)(q23;p13), has been well characterized in acute lymphoid leukemia (ALL). There is no report on E2A-PBX1 fusion transcripts in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
We used polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to detect E2A-PBX1 fusion transcripts in human NSCLC tissue specimens and cell lines. We analyzed correlation of E2A-PBX1 fusion transcripts with clinical outcomes in 76 patients with adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS) and other subgroups. We compared mutation status of k-ras, p53 and EGFR in 22 patients with E2A-PBX1 fusion transcripts.
We detected E2A-PBX1 transcripts in 23 of 184 (12.5%) NSCLC tissue specimens and 3 of 13 (23.1%) NSCLC cell lines. Presence of E2A-PBX1 fusion transcripts correlated with smoking status in female patients (P=0.048), AIS histology (P=0.006) and tumor size (P=0.026). The overall survival was associated with gender among AIS patients (P=0.0378) and AIS patients without E2A-PBX1 fusion transcripts (P=0.0345), but not among AIS patients with E2A-PBX1 fusion transcripts (P=0.6401). The overall survival was also associated with status of E2A-PBX1 fusion transcripts among AIS stage IA patients (P=0.0363) and AIS stage IA female patients (P=0.0174). In addition, among the 22 patients with E2A-PBX1 fusion transcripts, 12 (54.5%) patients including all four non-smokers, showed no common mutations in k-ras, p53 and EGFR.
E2A-PBX1 fusion gene caused by t(1;19)(q23;p13) may be a common genetic change in AIS and a survival determinant for female AIS patients at early stage.
We present eight patients with de novo, deleterious sequence variants in the PBX1 gene. PBX1 encodes a three amino acid loop extension (TALE) homeodomain transcription factor that forms multimeric complexes with TALE and HOX proteins to regulate target gene transcription during development. As previously reported, Pbx1 homozygous mutant mice (Pbx1-/-) develop malformations and hypoplasia or aplasia of multiple organs, including the craniofacial skeleton, ear, branchial arches, heart, lungs, diaphragm, gut, kidneys, and gonads. Clinical findings similar to those in Pbx mutant mice were observed in all patients with varying expressivity and severity, including external ear anomalies, abnormal branchial arch derivatives, heart malformations, diaphragmatic hernia, renal hypoplasia and ambiguous genitalia. All patients but one had developmental delays. Previously reported patients with congenital anomalies affecting the kidney and urinary tract exhibited deletions and loss of function variants in PBX1. The sequence variants in our cases included missense substitutions adjacent to the PBX1 homeodomain (p.Arg184Pro, p.Met224Lys, and p.Arg227Pro) or within the homeodomain (p.Arg234Pro, and p.Arg235Gln), whereas p.Ser262Glnfs*2, and p.Arg288* yielded truncated PBX1 proteins. Functional studies on five PBX1 sequence variants revealed perturbation of intrinsic, PBX-dependent transactivation ability and altered nuclear translocation, suggesting abnormal interactions between mutant PBX1 proteins and wild-type TALE or HOX cofactors. It is likely that the mutations directly affect the transcription of PBX1 target genes to impact embryonic development. We conclude that deleterious sequence variants in PBX1 cause intellectual disability and pleiotropic malformations resembling those in Pbx1 mutant mice, arguing for strong conservation of gene function between these two species.
Basic and translational research achievements over the past 2 decades have disclosed the molecular mechanisms underlying several genetic forms of hypopituitarism. Disorders that are limited to the hypothalamic, pituitary, GH axis are caused by mutations in individual components of that axis. Disorders involving GH and one or more additional pituitary hormones are caused by mutations in the homeodomain transcription factors that direct embryological development of the anterior pituitary gland. Pit-1 has a POU-specific and a POU-homeo DNA-binding domain. The phenotype produced by mutations in the PIT1 gene involves deficiencies of GH, PRL, and TSH. Pituitary glands are either small or normally sized. The PROP1 gene encodes a transcription factor with a single paired-like DNA-binding domain. Persons with inactivating mutations in PROP1 have deficiencies of LH and FSH, as well as GH, PRL, and TSH. Their pituitary glands may be small, normally sized, or extremely large and show suprasellar extension. Pituitary degeneration may produce acquired deficiency of ACTH. Expression of the HESX1 gene precedes expression of PROP1 and PIT1, and it is much more widespread. The protein has a paired-like domain, and it competes with the product of PROP1 for DNA-binding. Homozygosity for inactivating mutations of HESX1 produces a complex phenotype that resembles septo-optic dysplasia. Much more needs to be learned about the role of HESX1 mutations in other forms of hypopituitarism.
The PROP1 protein, encoded by the prophet of Pit-1 (PROP1) gene, exhibits both DNA-binding and transcriptional activation abilities. Its expression leads to the ontogenesis of growth hormone (GH), prolactin (PRL), thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), and pituitary hormone. The missense mutation H173R in PROP1 may result in deficiencies of GH, PRL, TSH, and Pit-1, thereby affecting growth traits. The objective of this study was to characterize the H173R mutation within the PROP1 gene and examine its associations with growth traits in cattle. Accordingly, the H173R mutation was genotyped in 1207 cows belonging to five Chinese native breeds. Three genotypes were identified among the specimens, with genotype AA being the major one. Consequently, the "G" allele was the minor allele. Association testing revealed that the H173R mutation was significantly associated with body weight, average daily weight gain and physical parameters in the analyzed breeds. Interestingly, the cows with genotype AG and/or AA had superior growth traits compared with those expressing the GG genotype, in all tested breeds. These findings revealed that the "A" allele had positive effects on growth traits, which was consistent with the increasing binding ability and enhanced activation capacity associated with the bovine isoform PROP1-173H, representing the "A" allele. Therefore, the H173R mutation can be considered as a DNA marker for selecting individuals with superior growth traits, thereby contributing to research on breeding and genetics in the beef industry. 
Mutations in PROP1 are the most frequent defect detected in patients with combined pituitary hormone deficiency (MIM #262600), characterized by a clinical phenotype of proportionate growth deficit due to impaired production of growth hormone in combination with deficiency of one or more of the additional anterior pituitary hormones. Approximately one third of patients with PROP1 inactivating mutations present with abnormal development of the anterior lobe of the pituitary gland as revealed by MRI. We report on the clinical and molecular characterization of the fourth complete PROP1 deletion in a girl with proportional short stature, combined pituitary hormone deficiency and a suprasellar mass mimicking a hypothalamic glioma. The proband, born to consanguineous parents, presented with proportional growth failure (height 108.8 cm, -3.48 SDS), combined pituitary hormone deficiency (GH, TSH, PRL and gonadotropins) and a suprasellar mass with optic chiasm invasion, compatible with a diagnosis of chiasmatic hypothalamic glioma, as revealed by MRI. PROP1 mutation screening by PCR and MLPA detected a homozygous deletion of the entire PROP1. The deletion was delimited to at least 7.7 kb upstream of PROP1 and more finely to ∼541-74 bp downstream from PROP1 by aCGH and PCR mapping. We describe the fourth case with a complete PROP1 deletion in homozygosis. The apparent location of the respective 5' (within a highly repetitive region, rich in Alu sequences) and 3' (within an Alu sequence) breakpoints, suggests that the deletion may have arisen through homologous recombination. The differentiation between PROP1 mutation associated pituitary enlargements from craniopharyngioma, pituitary adenoma, dys-germinoma, or Rathke's pouch cyst, is critical for the correct patient management. It is important to recognize that PROP1 mutations can present associated with evolving pituitary masses and/or other MRI alterations of the pituitary during early childhood and that surgery is not indicated in these patients. Therefore, in the presence of combined pituitary hormone deficiency and a pituitary or hypothalamic mass, PROP1 analysis should be considered before referring the patient to a neurosurgeon.
The HOX genes are a highly conserved subgroup of homeodomain-containing             transcription factors that are crucial to normal development. Forced expression             of HOXA1 results in oncogenic transformation of immortalized human mammary cells             with aggressive tumour formation in vivo. Microarray analysis identified that             the prolactin receptor (PRLR) was significantly upregulated by forced expression             of HOXA1 in mammary carcinoma cells. To determine prolactin (PRL) involvement             in HOXA1‑induced oncogenicity in mammary carcinoma cells (MCF-7), we examined             the effect of human prolactin (hPRL)-initiated PRLR signal transduction on changes             in cellular behaviour mediated by HOXA1. Forced expression of HOXA1 in MCF-7 cells             increased PRLR mRNA and protein expression. Forced expression of HOXA1 also enhanced             hPRL-stimulated phosphorylation of both STAT5A/B and p44/42 MAPK, and increased             subsequent transcriptional activity of STAT5A and STAT5B, and Elk-1 and Sap1a,             respectively. Moreover, forced expression of HOXA1 in MCF-7 cells enhanced the             hPRL‑stimulated increase in total cell number as a consequence of enhanced cell             proliferation and cell survival, and also enhanced hPRL-stimulated anchorage-independent             growth in soft agar. Increased anchorage-independent growth was attenuated by             the PRLR antagonist ∆1-9-G129R‑hPRL. In conclusion, we have demonstrated that             HOXA1 increases expression of the cell surface receptor PRLR and enhances PRLR-mediated             signal transduction. Thus, the PRLR is one mediator of HOXA1‑stimulated oncogenicity             in mammary carcinoma cells.
In humans, pituitary hormone deficiency may be part of a syndrome including extra-pituitary defects like ocular abnormalities. Very few genes have been linked to this particular phenotype. In the mouse, Lhx2, which encodes a member of the LIM (Lin-11, Isl-1, and Mec-3) class of homeodomain proteins, was shown to be expressed during early development in the posterior pituitary, eye, and liver, and its expression persists in adulthood in the central nervous system Lhx2(-/-) mice display absence of posterior pituitary and intermediate lobes, malformation of the anterior lobe, anophthalmia, and they die from anemia.
We tested the implication of the LHX2 gene in patients presenting pituitary hormone deficiency associated with ectopic or nonvisible posterior pituitary and developmental ocular defects. A cohort of 59 patients, including two familial cases, was studied. Direct sequencing of the LHX2 coding sequence and intron/exon boundaries was performed. LHX2 transcriptional activity on several pituitary promoters (AGSU, PRL, POU1F1, and TSHB) was tested in vitro.
Six heterozygous sequence variations were identified, among which two are novel missense changes (p.Ala203Thr and p.Val333Met). In vitro, LHX2 activates transcription of TSHB, PRL, and POU1F1 promoters in the HEK293 cell line. A synergistic action of POU1F1 and LHX2 was also shown on these promoters. The two missense variations were tested and no significant difference was observed, leading to the conclusion that they are not deleterious.
These results suggest that if LHX2 is involved in pituitary hormone deficiency associated with posterior pituitary and ocular defects, it would be a rare cause of this disease condition.
Combined pituitary hormone deficiency (CPHD) diseases result in severe outcomes for patients including short stature, developmental delays, and reproductive deficiencies. Little is known about their etiology, especially the developmental profiles and the influences of genetic background on disease progression. Animal models for CPHD provide valuable tools to investigate disease mechanisms and inform diagnostic and treatment protocols. Here we examined hormone production during pituitary development and the influence of genetic background on phenotypic severity in the Lhx3(W227ter/W227ter) mouse model. Lhx3(W227ter/W227ter) embryos have deficiencies of ACTH, α-glycoprotein subunit, GH, PRL, TSHβ, and LHβ during prenatal development. Furthermore, mutant mice have significant reduction in the critical pituitary transcriptional activator-1 (PIT1). Through breeding, the Lhx3(W227ter/W227ter) genotype was placed onto the 129/Sv and C57BL/6 backgrounds. Intriguingly, the genetic background significantly affected viability: whereas Lhx3(W227ter/W227ter) animals were found in the expected frequencies in C57BL/6, homozygous animals were not viable in the 129/Sv genetic environment. The hormone marker and PIT1 reductions observed in Lhx3(W227ter/W227ter) mice on a mixed background were also seen in the separate strains but in some cases were more severe in 129/Sv. To further characterize the molecular changes in diseased mice, we conducted a quantitative proteomic analysis of pituitary proteins. This showed significantly lower levels of PRL, pro-opiomelanocortin (ACTH), and α-glycoprotein subunit proteins in Lhx3(W227ter/W227ter) mice. Together, these data show that hormone deficiency disease is apparent in early prenatal stages in this CPHD model system. Furthermore, as is noted in human disease, genetic background significantly impacts the phenotypic outcome of these monogenic endocrine diseases.
The role of genetic background in childhood-onset combined pituitary hormone deficiency (CPHD) has been extensively studied. The major contributors are the PROP1, POU1F1, LHX3, LHX4 and HESX1 genes coding transcription factors implicated in pituitary organogenesis. The clinical consequences of mutations encompass impaired synthesis of a growth hormone (GH) and one or more concurrent pituitary hormones (i.e. LH, FSH, TSH, PRL). Manifestation of the disorder may vary due to various mutation impacts on the final gene products or an influence of environmental factors during pituitary organogenesis. We describe the clinical and molecular characteristics of two brothers aged 47 and 39 years presenting an uncommon manifestation of congenital hypopituitarism. Sequencing of the PROP1, POU1F1, LHX3, LHX4 and HESX1 genes was performed to confirm the genetic origin of the disorder. A compound heterozygosity in the PROP1 gene has been identified for both probands. The first change represents a mutational hot spot (c.150delA, p.R53fsX164), whereas the second is a novel alteration (p.R112X) that leads to protein disruption. Based on precise genetic diagnosis, an in silico prediction of a p.R112X mutation on protein architecture was performed. The resulting clinical phenotype was surprisingly distinct compared to most patients with genetic alterations in PROP1 reported in the current literature. This may be caused by a residual activity of a newly identified p.R112X protein that preserves over 70 % of the homeodomain structure. This examination may confirm a key role of a DNA-binding homeodomain in maintaining PROP1 functionality and suggests a conceivable explanation of an unusual phenotype. 
LHX3 is a LIM-homeodomain transcription factor with critical roles in pituitary and nervous system development. Mutations in the LHX3 gene are associated with pediatric diseases featuring severe hormone deficiencies, hearing loss, developmental delay, and other symptoms. The mechanisms that govern LHX3/Lhx3 transcription are poorly understood. In this study, we examined the role of DNA methylation in the expression status of the mouse Lhx3 gene. Pituitary cells that do not normally express Lhx3 (Pit-1/0 cells) were treated with 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine, a demethylating reagent. This treatment leads to activation of Lhx3 gene expression suggesting that methylation contributes to Lhx3 regulation. Treatment of Pit-1/0 pituitary cells with a combination of a demethylating reagent and a histone deacetylase inhibitor led to rapid activation of Lhx3 expression, suggesting possible crosstalk between DNA methylation and histone modification processes. To assess DNA methylation levels, treated and untreated Pit-1/0 genomic DNAs were subjected to bisulfite conversion and sequencing. Treated Pit-1/0 cells had decreased methylation at specific sites in the Lhx3 locus compared to untreated cells. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated interactions between the MeCp2 methyl binding protein and Lhx3 promoter regions in the Pit-1/0 cell line. Overall, this study demonstrates that DNA methylation patterns of the Lhx3 gene are associated with its expression status.
The paired-like homeodomain transcription factor 2 (PITX2) gene plays a critical role in cell proliferation, differentiation, hematopoiesis and organogenesis. This gene regulates several genes' expressions in the Wnt/beta-catenin and POU1F1 pathways, thereby probably affecting milk performance. The goal of this study was to characterize the genetic variants of the PITX2 gene and test their associations with milk traits in dairy goats. Herein, four novel single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), AC_000163:g.18117T&gt;C, g.18161C&gt;G, g.18322C&gt;A and g.18353T&gt;C, within the caprine PITX2 gene, were found in two famous Chinese dairy goat breeds. These SNPs mapping at Cys28Arg, Pro42Pro, IVS1+79C&gt;A and IVS1+110T&gt;C, were genotyped by the MvaI, SmaI, MspI and RsaI aCRS-RFLP or PCR-RFLP methods, respectively. Accordingly, two main haplotypes (CGCT and CGCC) were identified among the specimens. Association testing revealed that the SmaI and RsaI polymorphisms were significantly associated with the milk fat content, milk lactose content and milk density (P&lt;0.05 or P&lt;0.01) in the Guanzhong (GZ) dairy goats, respectively. At the same time, the RsaI locus was also found to significantly link to the second lactation milk yield, milk fat content, milk lactose content, milk density and milk total solid content (P&lt;0.05 or P&lt;0.01) in the Xinong Saanen (XNSN) dairy goats, respectively. These results indicated that the caprine PITX2 gene had the significant effects on milk traits. Hence, the RsaI and SmaI loci could be regarded as two DNA markers for selecting superior milk performance in dairy goats. These preliminary findings not only would extend the spectrum of genetic variation of the goat PITX2 gene, but also would contribute to implementing marker-assisted selection (MAS) in breeding and genetics in dairy goats.
To investigate the effect of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) on mouse decidual endometrial stromal cells (ESCs) and to explore mechanisms regulating endometrial receptivity.
Mouse ESCs were incubated with increasing concentrations of DHEA during decidualization. Treatment with flutamide (FLU), a specific androgen receptor (AR) antagonist, was also performed. Flow cytometry was used to measure intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS). Real time-PCR was used to determine mRNA expression of decidual PRL-related protein (dPRP), AR, and HomeoboxA10 (HOXA10). Protein levels of AR and HOXA10 were measured by western blot.
DHEA significantly inhibited ESC proliferation at concentrations ≥1×10(-6)M. DHEA treatment reduced intracellular ROS in a dose-dependent manner. Expression of dPRP was minimally affected by DHEA at concentrations of 1 to 100nM. However, DHEA (100nM) significantly increased the expression of HOXA10 at both the mRNA and protein levels (P&lt;0.01). Importantly, this DHEA-mediated increase in HOXA10 was attenuated by treatment with FLU. Finally, neither DHEA nor FLU influenced expression of AR mRNA or protein.
Low concentration of DHEA improves the antioxidant capacity of decidual ESCs. DHEA treatment may also improve endometrium receptivity via AR.
POU1F1, a pituitary-specific POU-homeo domain transcription factor, plays an essential role in the specification of the somatotroph, lactotroph and thyrotroph lineages and in the activation of GH1, PRL and TSHβ transcription. Individuals with mutations in POU1F1 present with combined deficiency of GH, PRL and TSH. Here, we identified a heterozygous missense mutation with evidence of pathogenicity, at the POU1F1 locus, in a large family in which an isolated growth hormone deficiency segregates as an autosomal dominant trait. The corresponding p.Pro76Leu mutation maps to a conserved site within the POU1F1 transactivation domain. Bandshift assays revealed that the mutation alters wild-type POU1F1 binding to cognate sites within the hGH-LCR and hGH1 promoter, but not to sites within the PRL promoter, and it selectively increases binding affinity to sites within the hGH-LCR. Co-immunoprecipitation studies reveal that this substitution enhances interactions of POU1F1 with three of its cofactors, PITX1, LHX3a and ELK1, and that residue 76 plays a critical role in these interactions. The insertion of the mutation at the mouse Pou1f1 locus results in a dramatic loss of protein expression despite normal mRNA concentrations. Mice heterozygous for the p.Pro76Leu mutation were phenotypically normal while homozygotes demonstrated a dwarf phenotype. Overall, this study unveils the involvement of POU1F1 in dominantly inherited isolated GH deficiency and demonstrates a significant impact of the Pro76Leu mutation on DNA-binding activities, alterations in transactivating functions and interactions with cofactors. Our data further highlight difficulties in modeling human genetic disorders in the mouse despite apparent conservation of gene expression pathways and physiologic functions. 
All animal subcellular membranes require cholesterol, which influences membrane fluidity and permeability, fission and fusion processes, and membrane protein function. The distribution of cholesterol among subcellular membranes is highly heterogeneous and the cholesterol content of each membrane must be carefully regulated. Compared to other subcellular membranes, mitochondrial membranes are cholesterol-poor, particularly the inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM). As a result, steroidogenesis can be controlled through the delivery of cholesterol to the IMM, where it is converted to pregnenolone. The low basal levels of cholesterol also make mitochondria sensitive to changes in cholesterol content, which can have a relatively large impact on the biophysical and functional characteristics of mitochondrial membranes. Increased mitochondrial cholesterol levels have been observed in diverse pathological conditions including cancer, steatohepatitis, Alzheimer disease and Niemann-Pick Type C1-deficiency, and are associated with increased oxidative stress, impaired oxidative phosphorylation, and changes in the susceptibility to apoptosis, among other alterations in mitochondrial function. Mitochondria are not included in the vesicular trafficking network; therefore, cholesterol transport to mitochondria is mostly achieved through the activity of lipid transfer proteins at membrane contact sites or by cytosolic, diffusible lipid transfer proteins. Here we will give an overview of the main mechanisms involved in mitochondrial cholesterol import, focusing on the steroidogenic acute regulatory protein StAR/STARD1 and other members of the StAR-related lipid transfer (START) domain protein family, and we will discuss how changes in mitochondrial cholesterol levels can arise and affect mitochondrial function. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Lipids of Mitochondria edited by Guenther Daum.
Niemann-Pick disease type C (NP-C) is a neurovisceral lysosomal cholesterol trafficking and lipid storage disorder caused by mutations in one of the two genes, NPC1 or NPC2. Diagnosis has often been a difficult task, due to the wide range in age of onset of NP-C and clinical presentation of the disease, combined with the complexity of the cell biology (filipin) laboratory testing, even in combination with genetic testing. This has led to substantial delays in diagnosis, largely depending on the access to specialist centres and the level of knowledge about NP-C of the physician in the area. In recent years, advances in mass spectrometry has allowed identification of several sensitive plasma biomarkers elevated in NP-C (e.g. cholestane-3β,5α,6β-triol, lysosphingomyelin isoforms and bile acid metabolites), which, together with the concomitant progress in molecular genetic technology, have greatly impacted the strategy of laboratory testing. Specificity of the biomarkers is currently under investigation and other pathologies are being found to also result in elevations. Molecular genetic testing also has its limitations, notably with unidentified mutations and the classification of new variants. This review is intended to increase awareness on the currently available approaches to laboratory diagnosis of NP-C, to provide an up to date, comprehensive and critical evaluation of the various techniques (cell biology, biochemical biomarkers and molecular genetics), and to briefly discuss ongoing/future developments. The use of current tests in proper combination enables a rapid and correct diagnosis in a large majority of cases. However, even with recent progress, definitive diagnosis remains challenging in some patients, for whom combined genetic/biochemical/cytochemical markers do not provide a clear answer. Expertise and reference laboratories thus remain essential, and further work is still required to fulfill unmet needs.
Niemann Pick type C (NP-C) is a rare neurodegenerative disorder caused by an impairment of intracellular lipid transport. Due to the heterogeneous clinical phenotype and the lack of a reliable blood test, diagnosis and therapy are often delayed for years. In the cell, accumulating cholesterol leads to increased formation of oxysterols that can be used as a powerful screening parameter for NP-C. In a large scale study, we evaluated the oxysterol cholestane-3β,5α,6β-triol (c-triol) as potential biomarker for a rapid diagnosis of NP-C. Using GC/MS, c-triol has been analyzed in 1902 plasma samples of patients with the suspicion for NP-C. Diagnosis in patients with elevated oxysterols was confirmed by genetic analysis. 71 new NP-C patients (69 NP-C1 and two NP-C2) and 12 Niemann Pick type A/B patients were identified. 24 new mutations in NPC1, one new mutation in NPC2 and three new mutations in the SMPD1 gene were found. Cholestane-3β,5α,6β-triol was elevated in Niemann Pick type C1, type C2, type A/B and in CESD disease. No other study has ever identified so many NP-C patients, proving that c-triol is a rapid and reliable biomarker to detect patients with NP-C disease and related cholesterol transport disorders. It should replace the filipin test as the first-line diagnostic assay. 
We have studied the pathophysiology of lung disease which occurs in two mouse models of Niemann-Pick C1 disease. We utilized Npc1(-/-) mice transgenic for normal gene expression in glia or neurons and glia at ages several fold the usual and a mouse model of the juvenile form of NPC1, a point mutation, at one age to confirm some findings. Lung weights, as per cent of body weight, increase much more than liver and spleen weights. Although pulmonary function parameters only vary for hysteresis between young and older Npc1(-/-) mice, they are markedly different than those found in normal control mice. Cholesterol accumulation continued in the older mice but sphingosine-1-phosphate was not increased. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) showed a massive increase (26×) in the number of macrophages. Histologic examination from the older, transgenic Npc1(-/-) mice showed small foci of alveolar proteinosis and evidence of hemorrhage, as well as dense macrophage accumulation. A large subset of macrophages was immunopositive for Fizz1 or arginase-1, markers of the alternative activation pathway, while no Fizz1 or arginase-1 positive macrophages were found in wild-type mice. The percentage of marker positive macrophages was relatively stable at 5-10% at various ages and within the 2 transgenic models. Phosphohistone H3 and Ki67 showed low levels of proliferation of these macrophages. Apoptosis was prominent within lung capillary endothelial cells, but limited within macrophages. Thus, activation of the alternative pathway is involved in Niemann-Pick C1 associated pulmonary macrophage accumulation, with low proliferation of these cells balanced by low levels of apoptosis. 
Niemann-Pick C1 protein (NPC1) is a late-endosomal membrane protein involved in trafficking of LDL-derived cholesterol, Niemann-Pick disease type C, and Ebola virus infection. NPC1 contains 13 transmembrane segments (TMs), five of which are thought to represent a "sterol-sensing domain" (SSD). Although present also in other key regulatory proteins of cholesterol biosynthesis, uptake, and signaling, the structure and mechanism of action of the SSD are unknown. Here we report a crystal structure of a large fragment of human NPC1 at 3.6 Å resolution, which reveals internal twofold pseudosymmetry along TM 2-13 and two structurally homologous domains that protrude 60 Å into the endosomal lumen. Strikingly, NPC1's SSD forms a cavity that is accessible from both the luminal bilayer leaflet and the endosomal lumen; computational modeling suggests that this cavity is large enough to accommodate one cholesterol molecule. We propose a model for NPC1 function in cholesterol sensing and transport.
Niemann-Pick C (NPC) disease is an autosomal recessive disorder that leads to excessive storage of cholesterol and other lipids in late endosomes and lysosomes. The large majority of NPC disease is caused by mutations in NPC1, a large polytopic membrane protein that functions in late endosomes. There are many disease-associated mutations in NPC1, and most patients are compound heterozygotes. The most common mutation, NPC1I1061T, has been shown to cause endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation of the NPC1 protein. Treatment of patient-derived NPC1I1061T fibroblasts with histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACis) vorinostat or panobinostat increases expression of the mutant NPC1 protein and leads to correction of the cholesterol storage. Here, we show that several other human NPC1 mutant fibroblast cell lines can also be corrected by vorinostat or panobinostat and that treatment with vorinostat extends the lifetime of the NPC1I1061T protein. To test effects of HDACi on a large number of NPC1 mutants, we engineered a U2OS cell line to suppress NPC1 expression by shRNA and then transiently transfected these cells with 60 different NPC1 mutant constructs. The mutant NPC1 did not significantly reduce cholesterol accumulation, but approximately 85% of the mutants showed reduced cholesterol accumulation when treated with vorinostat or panobinostat.
Niemann-Pick disease Type C (NP-C) is a genetic lipid storage disorder characterised by progressive neurovisceral symptomatology. Typically, disease progression is more pronounced in patients with early onset of neurological symptoms. Heterogeneous clinical presentation may hinder disease recognition and lead to delays in diagnosis. Here we describe the prevalence of signs and symptoms observed in patients with NP-C and analyse the relationship between these symptoms in different age groups.
The combined patient cohort used in the analyses comprised NP-C cases (n=164) and controls (n=135) aged 0 to 60years from two previously published cohorts; a cohort of all ages from which patients ≤4years of age were excluded and a cohort with early-onset NP-C and age-matched controls. The analysis of relationships between different signs and symptoms was performed for both NP-C cases and controls in two sub-groups, ≤4 and &gt;4years of age, using cluster analyses. The threshold of 4years of age was selected to reflect the minimum age cut-off for satisfactory discriminatory power of the original NP-C SI. To assess the prevalence of individual signs and symptoms at age of diagnosis, patients were categorised by age into 5-year sub-groups, and prevalence values estimated for each sign and symptom of NP-C.
Two main clusters of symptoms were clearly defined for NP-C cases in each age sub-group, whereas clusters were not as clearly defined for controls. For NP-C cases ≤4years of age, one cluster comprised exclusively visceral symptoms; the second cluster combined all other signs and symptoms in this age group. For NP-C cases &gt;4years of age, each cluster contained a mixture of visceral, neurological and psychiatric items. Prevalence estimations showed that visceral symptoms (e.g. isolated unexplained splenomegaly) were most common in NP-C cases ≤4years of age. Neurological symptoms were generally more common in NP-C cases &gt;4years of age than in younger patients, with the exception of hypotonia and delayed developmental milestones.
These analyses provide a comprehensive overview of symptomatology observed in a large combined cohort of patients with NP-C and controls across a wide range of ages. The results largely reflect observations from clinical practice and support the importance of multi-disciplinary approaches for identification of patients with NP-C, taking into account age-specific manifestations and their possible correlations.
Atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory disease of medium and large vessels and is typically characterized by the predominant accumulation of low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol inside macrophages that reside in the vessel walls. Previous studies clearly demonstrated an association specifically between the oxidized type of LDL (oxLDL) and atherosclerotic lesion formation. Further observations revealed that these atherosclerotic lesions displayed enlarged, lipid-loaded lysosomes. By increasing natural antibodies against oxLDL, pneumococcal vaccination has been shown to reduce atherosclerosis in LDL receptor knockout (Ldlr-/-) mice. Relevantly, loss of the lysosomal membrane protein Niemann-Pick Type C1 (NPC1) led to lysosomal accumulation of various lipids and promoted atherosclerosis. Yet, the importance of lysosomal oxLDL accumulation inside macrophages, compared to non-modified LDL, in atherosclerosis has never been established.
By transplanting NPC1 bone marrow into lethally irradiated Ldlr-/- mice, a hematopoietic mouse model for lysosomal cholesterol accumulation was created. Through injections with heat-inactivated pneumococci, we aimed to demonstrate the specific contribution of lysosomal oxLDL accumulation inside macrophages in atherosclerosis development.
While there were no differences in plaque morphology, a reduction in plaque size and plaque inflammation was found in immunized NPC1mut-transplanted mice, compared to non-immunized NPC1mut-transplanted mice.
Lysosomal oxLDL accumulation within macrophages contributes to murine atherosclerosis. Future intervention strategies should focus specifically on preventing oxLDL, unlike non-modified LDL, from being internalized into lysosomes. Such an intervention can have an additive effect to current existing treatments against atherosclerosis.
This is the first study to objectively measure gait, balance, and upper limb coordination in a group of patients with NPC1 and compare the results to age and gender matched controls. This is also the first study to report effect sizes in these measures. Spatiotemporal gait analysis, static and dynamic posturography, and upper limb reaching motion analysis were performed. The findings showed that the NPC1 subjects had statistically significant deficits on 12 out of the 16 parameters investigated compared to controls, and large effect sizes for all but 1 parameter. When ranking the variables in terms of the effect sizes, the top 5 included at least 1 parameter from each of the 3 motor domains investigated. These results can provide insight to clinical researchers on the selection of outcome measures for longitudinal and interventional studies.
The biological diagnosis of sphingolipidoses currently relies on the measurement of specific enzymatic activities and/or genetic studies. Lysosphingolipids have recently emerged as potential biomarkers of sphingolipidoses and Niemann-Pick type C in plasma.
We developed a sensitive and specific method enabling the simultaneous quantification of lysosphingolipids by LC-MS/MS: lysoglobotriaosylceramide for Fabry disease, lysohexosylceramide (i.e. lysoglucosylceramide and/or lysogalactosylceramide) for Gaucher and Krabbe diseases, lysosphingomyelin and its carboxylated analogue lysosphingomyelin-509 for Niemann-Pick type A or B, and C diseases, lysoGM1 ganglioside for GM1gangliosidosis and lysoGM2 ganglioside for GM2 gangliosidosis.
The diagnostic performances were validated in plasma samples analysing a large series of patients affected with sphingolipidoses and Niemann-Pick type C disease (n = 98), other inborn errors of metabolism (n = 23), and controls (n = 228). The multiplex measurement of lysosphingolipids allowed the screening of Fabry (including female patients and late-onset variants), Gaucher and infantile Krabbe, Niemann-Pick type A/B and C diseases with high sensitivity and specificity. LysoGM1 and LysoGM2 were elevated in most of the patients affected with GM1 and GM2 gangliosidosis respectively. In amniotic fluid supernatant from pregnancies presenting non-immune hydrops fetalis (n = 77, including previously diagnosed Gaucher (n = 5), GM1 gangliosidosis (n = 4) and galactosialidosis (n = 4) fetuses) and from normal pregnancies (n = 15), a specific and dramatic increase of lysohexosylceramide was observed only in the Gaucher amniotic fluid samples.
This multiplex assay which allows the simultaneous measurement of lysosphingolipids in plasma modifies the diagnostic strategy of sphingolipidoses and Niemann-Pick type C. Furthermore, in pregnancies presenting non-immune hydrops fetalis, lysohexosylceramide measurement in amniotic fluid offers a rapid screening of fetal Gaucher disease without waiting for glucocerebrosidase activity measurement in cultured amniocytes.
Pre-B-cell leukemia homeobox (PBX) transcription factors are known to regulate organogenesis, but their molecular targets and function in midbrain dopaminergic neurons (mDAn) as well as their role in neurodegenerative diseases are unknown. Here, we show that PBX1 controls a novel transcriptional network required for mDAn specification and survival, which is sufficient to generate mDAn from human stem cells. Mechanistically, PBX1 plays a dual role in transcription by directly repressing or activating genes, such as Onecut2 to inhibit lateral fates during embryogenesis, Pitx3 to promote mDAn development, and Nfe2l1 to protect from oxidative stress. Notably, PBX1 and NFE2L1 levels are severely reduced in dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra of Parkinson's disease (PD) patients and decreased NFE2L1 levels increases damage by oxidative stress in human midbrain cells. Thus, our results reveal novel roles for PBX1 and its transcriptional network in mDAn development and PD, opening the door for new therapeutic interventions.
There is a great need to identify new and better prognostic and predictive biomarkers to stratify prostate cancer patients for optimal treatment. The aims of this study were to characterize the expression profile of pre-B cell leukemia homeobox (PBX) transcription factors in prostate cancer with an emphasis on investigating whether PBX3 harbours any prognostic value. The expression profile of PBX3 and PBX1 in prostate tissue was determined by immunohistochemical and immunoblot analysis. Furthermore, the expression of PBX3 transcript variants was analyzed by RT-PCR, NanoString Technologies®, and by analyzing RNA sequence data. The potential of PBX3 to predict prognosis, either at mRNA or protein level, was studied in four independent cohorts. PBX3 was mainly expressed in the nucleus of normal prostate basal cells, while it showed cytosolic expression in prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia and cancer cells. We detected four PBX3 transcript variants in prostate tissue. Competing risk regression analysis revealed that high PBX3 expression was associated with slower progression to castration resistant prostate cancer (sub-hazard ratio (SHR) 0.18, 95% CI: 0.081-0.42, p values &lt; 0.001). PBX3 expression had a high predictive accuracy (area under the curve (AUC) = 0.82) when combined with Gleason score and age. Patients undergoing radical prostatectomy, with high levels of PBX3 mRNA, had improved prostate cancer specific survival compared to patients expressing low levels (SHR 0.21, 95% CI: 0.46-0.93, p values &lt; 0.001, and AUC = 0.75). Our findings strongly indicate that PBX3 has potential as a biomarker, both as part of a larger gene panel and as an immunohistochemical marker, for aggressive prostate cancer.
Hox homeobox transcription factors drive leukemogenesis efficiently only in the presence of Meis or Pbx proteins. Here we show that Pbx3 and Meis1 need to dimerize to support Hox-induced leukemia and we analyze the molecular details of this cooperation. In the absence of Pbx3, Meis1 was highly unstable. As shown by a deletion analysis Meis1 degradation was contingent on a motif coinciding with the Pbx-binding domain. Either deletion of this sequence or binding to Pbx3 prolonged the half-life of Meis1 by preventing its ubiquitination. Meis1 break-down could also be blocked by inhibition of the ubiquitin proteasome system, indicating tight post-transcriptional control. In addition, Meis1 and Pbx3 cooperated genetically as overexpression of Pbx3 induced endogenous Meis1 transcription. These functional interactions translated into in vivo activity. Blocking Meis1/Pbx3 dimerization abrogated the ability to enhance proliferation and colony-forming cell numbers in primary cells transformed by Hoxa9. Furthermore, expression of Meis1 target genes Flt3 and Trib2 was dependent on Pbx3/Meis1 dimerization. This correlated with the requirement of Meis1 to bind Pbx3 in order to form high affinity DNA/Hoxa9/Meis1/Pbx3 complexes in vitro. Finally, kinetics and severity of disease in transplantation assays indicated that Pbx3/Meis1 dimers are rate-limiting factors for Hoxa9-induced leukemia. 
The development and progression of melanoma have been attributed to independent or combined genetic and epigenetic events. There has been remarkable progress in understanding melanoma pathogenesis in terms of genetic alterations. However, recent studies have revealed a complex involvement of epigenetic mechanisms in the regulation of gene expression, including methylation, chromatin modification and remodeling, and the diverse activities of non-coding RNAs. The roles of gene methylation and miRNAs have been relatively well studied in melanoma, but other studies have shown that changes in chromatin status and in the differential expression of long non-coding RNAs can lead to altered regulation of key genes. Taken together, they affect the functioning of signaling pathways that influence each other, intersect, and form networks in which local perturbations disturb the activity of the whole system. Here, we focus on how epigenetic events intertwine with these pathways and contribute to the molecular pathogenesis of melanoma. 
Mixed lineage leukemias have a relatively poor prognosis and arise as a result of translocations between the MLL(KMT2A) gene and one of multiple partner genes. Downstream targets of MLL are aberrantly upregulated and include the developmentally important HOX genes and MEIS1, as well as multiple microRNAs (miRNAs), including the miR-17∼92 cluster. Here we examined the contribution of specific miRNAs to MLL leukemias through knockdown studies utilizing custom anti-microRNA oligonucleotides. Combinatorial treatment against miR-17-5p and miR-19a-3p of the miR-17∼92 cluster dramatically reduces colony forming ability of MLL-fusion containing cell lines relative to non-MLL acute myeloid leukemia (AML) controls. To determine the mechanism by which these miRNAs contribute to leukemia, we validated PKNOX1 as a target of both miR-17-5p and miR-19a-3p. MEIS1 and PKNOX1 are TALE domain proteins that participate in ternary complexes with HOX and PBX partners. Here we establish the competitive relationship between PKNOX1 and MEIS1 in PBX-containing complex formation and determine the antagonistic role of PKNOX1 to leukemia in a murine MLL-AF9 model. These data implicate the miR-17∼92 cluster as part of a regulatory mechanism necessary to maintain MEIS1/HOXA9 -mediated transformation in MLL leukemia, indicating that targeting multiple non-homologous miRNAs may be utilized as a novel therapeutic regimen.
The liver plays a central role in metabolism and produces important hormones. Hepatic estrogen receptors and the release of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) are critical links between liver function and the reproductive system. However, the role of liver in pubertal development is not fully understood. To explore this question, we applied transcriptomic analyses to liver samples of pre- and post-pubertal Brahman heifers and identified differentially expressed (DE) genes and genes encoding transcription factors (TFs). Differential expression of genes suggests potential biological mechanisms and pathways linking liver function to puberty. The analyses identified 452 DE genes and 82 TF with significant contribution to differential gene expression by using a regulatory impact factor metric. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor was observed as the most down-regulated gene (P = 0.003) in post-pubertal heifers and we propose this gene influences pubertal development in Brahman heifers. Additionally, co-expression network analysis provided evidence for three TF as key regulators of liver function during pubertal development: the signal transducer and activator of transcription 6, PBX homeobox 2, and polybromo 1. Pathway enrichment analysis identified transforming growth factor-beta and Wnt signaling pathways as significant annotation terms for the list of DE genes and TF in the co-expression network. Molecular information regarding genes and pathways described in this work are important to further our understanding of puberty onset in Brahman heifers.
Glaucoma is characterized as a visual field defect, which is the second most common cause of blindness. The present study performed an integrated analysis of microarray studies of glaucoma derived from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). Following the identification of the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in glaucoma compared with normal control (NC) tissues, the functional annotation, glaucoma‑specific protein‑protein interaction (PPI) network and transcriptional regulatory network constructions were performed. The acute intraocular pressure (IOP) elevation rat models were established and reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT‑qPCR) was performed for DEGs expression confirmation. Three datasets were downloaded from GEO. A total of 97 DEGs, 82 upregulated and 15 downregulated were identified in glaucoma compared with NC groups with false discovery rate &lt;0.05. Response to virus and immune response were two significantly enriched GO terms in glaucoma. Valine, leucine and isoleucine degradation was a significantly enriched pathway of DEGs in glaucoma. According to the PPI network, HDAC1, HBN, UBR4 and PDK1 were hub proteins in glaucoma. FOXD3, HNF‑4 and AP‑1 were the three transcription factors (TFs) derived from top 10 TFs which covered the majority of downstream DEGs in glaucoma. Based on the RT‑qPCR results, the expression levels of 3 DEGs, raftlin, lipid raft linker 1 (RFTN1), PBX homeobox 1 (PBX1), HDAC1 were significantly upregulated and the expression of GEM was significantly downregulated in acute IOP elevation rat model at the first and fifth day. These four DEGs had the same expression pattern with our integrated analysis. Therefore, the current study concluded that 6 DEGs, including HEPH, SELENBP1, RFTN1, ID1, HDAC‑1 and PBX1 and three TFs, including FOXD3, HNF‑4 and AP‑1 may be involved with the pathogenesis of glaucoma. The findings of the current study may improve diagnosis and drug design for glaucoma.
A five-step synthesis of an array of N-aryl-3-alkylidenepyrrolinones, which are potential Niemann-Pick type C (NPC) disease therapeutics, is described. The synthetic route allows for the production of analogues, including photoaffinity and biotinylated derivatives. Compound 1a increased esterification by acyl-coenzyme A:cholesteryl acyltransferase in NPC1 mutant cells. It also decreased LDL uptake and increased cholesterol efflux in both NPC1-deficient and normal cells.
Gamma-secretase is a unique intramembrane-cleaving protease complex, which cleaves the Alzheimer's disease-associated beta-amyloid precursor protein (APP) and a number of other type I membrane proteins. Human gamma-secretase consists of the catalytic subunit presenilin (PS) (PS1 or PS2), the substrate receptor nicastrin, APH-1 (APH-1a or APH-1b), and PEN-2. To facilitate in-depth biochemical analysis of gamma-secretase, we developed a fast and convenient multistep purification procedure for the endogenous enzyme. The enzyme was purified from HEK293 cells in an active form and had a molecular mass of approximately 500 kDa. Purified gamma-secretase was capable of producing the major amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) species, such as Abeta40 and Abeta42, from a recombinant APP substrate in physiological ratios. Abeta generation could be modulated by pharmacological gamma-secretase modulators. Moreover, the Abeta42/Abeta40 ratio was strongly increased by purified PS1 L166P, an aggressive familial Alzheimer's disease mutant. Tandem mass spectrometry analysis revealed the consistent coisolation of several proteins with the known gamma-secretase core subunits. Among these were the previously described gamma-secretase interactors CD147 and TMP21 as well as other known interactors of these. Interestingly, the Niemann-Pick type C1 protein, a cholesterol transporter previously implicated in gamma-secretase-mediated processing of APP, was identified as a major copurifying protein. Affinity capture experiments using a biotinylated transition-state analogue inhibitor of gamma-secretase showed that these proteins are absent from active gamma-secretase complexes. Taken together, we provide an effective procedure for isolating endogenous gamma-secretase in considerably high grade, thus aiding further characterization of this pivotal enzyme. In addition, we provide evidence that the copurifying proteins identified are unlikely to be part of the active gamma-secretase enzyme.
Alternative splicing is an important regulator of the transcriptome. However, mutations may cause alteration of splicing patterns, which in turn leads to disease. During the past 10 years, exon skipping has been looked upon as a powerful tool for correction of missplicing in disease and progress has been made towards clinical trials. In this review, we discuss the use of antisense oligonucleotides to correct splicing defects through exon skipping, with a special focus on diseases affecting the nervous system, and the latest stage achieved in its progress. 
Our previous study demonstrated a progressive glycolytic perturbation during the course of DMBA-induced hamster oral carcinogenesis, which was attenuated by salvianolic acid B (Sal-B) treatment along with decreased incidences of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) formation. It was proposed that metabolic modulation should be an additional mode of action attributable to Sal-B's anti-carcinogenic activity. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying Sal-B-induced metabolic modulation function remained elusive. In the present study, we performed next-generation sequencing (NGS) profiling in the same animal model and found Sal-B treatment evoked a general downregulation of the phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase (PI3K) and hypoxia inducible factor 1α subunit (HIF-1α) signaling pathways, which might contribute to Sal-B's metabolic modulation activity. The inhibitory effects of Sal-B on aerobic glycolysis, as well as PI3K/AKT and HIF-1α signaling pathways, were validated in two well-characterized OSCC cell lines (Cal27 and HN4), and premalignant oral Leuk1 cells and Sal-B treatment led to elevation of the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), increased cell apoptosis, and reduced abilities of colony formation. Rescue assays suggested that compared with Sal-B treatment group, Akt or hif-1a overexpression attenuated the inhibitory effect of Sal-B on glucose uptake and intracellular lactate level. Taken together, our results suggested that Sal-B modulated aberrant glucose metabolism via the PI3K/AKT/HIF-1α signaling pathways, which might contribute to the anti-carcinogenic activity of Sal-B.
Cannabidiol (CBD) represents a new promising drug due to a wide spectrum of pharmacological actions. In order to relate CBD clinical efficacy to its pharmacological mechanisms of action, we performed a bibliographic search on PUBMED about all clinical studies investigating the use of CBD as a treatment of psychiatric symptoms. Findings to date suggest that (a) CBD may exert antipsychotic effects in schizophrenia mainly through facilitation of endocannabinoid signalling and cannabinoid receptor type 1 antagonism; (b) CBD administration may exhibit acute anxiolytic effects in patients with generalised social anxiety disorder through modification of cerebral blood flow in specific brain sites and serotonin 1A receptor agonism; (c) CBD may reduce withdrawal symptoms and cannabis/tobacco dependence through modulation of endocannabinoid, serotoninergic and glutamatergic systems; (d) the preclinical pro-cognitive effects of CBD still lack significant results in psychiatric disorders. In conclusion, current evidences suggest that CBD has the ability to reduce psychotic, anxiety and withdrawal symptoms by means of several hypothesised pharmacological properties. However, further studies should include larger randomised controlled samples and investigate the impact of CBD on biological measures in order to correlate CBD's clinical effects to potential modifications of neurotransmitters signalling and structural and functional cerebral changes.
The efficient capture and storage of radioactive iodine (129I or 131I), which can be formed during nuclear energy generation or storage of nuclear waste, is of paramount importance. Herein we present highly eﬃcient aerogels for reversible iodine capture, namely Porous Silsesquioxane-Imine Frameworks (PSIF), constructed by a condensation of octa(3-aminopropyl)silsesquioxane cage compound (OAS-POSS) and selected multitopic aldehydes. The resulting PSIFs are permanently porous (Brunauer-Emmet-Teller (BET) surface areas up to 574 m2/g), thermally stable and present a combination of micro-, meso- and macropores in their structures. The presence of a high number of imine functional groups in combination with silsesquioxane cores results in extremely high I2 aﬃnity with uptake capacities up to 485%wt, which is the highest reported to date. Porous properties can be controlled by the strut length and rigidity of linkers. In addition, PSIF-1a could be recycled at least 4 times while maintaining 94% I2 uptake capacity. Kinetic studies of I2 desorption show two strong binding sites with apparent activation energies of 77.0 kJ/mol and 89.0 kJ/mol. These energies are considerably higher than the enthalpy of sublimation of bulk I2.
To identify the prevalence of distal adding-on phenomenon after posterior selective fusion in type Lenke 1A idiopathic scoliosis, to analyze its risk factors so as to find the reasonable choice for lowest instrumented vertebra (LIV).
A retrospective study was made on the clinical data of 43 patients with type Lenke 1A idiopathic scoliosis undergoing posterior selection fusion with pedicle screw instrumentation between July 2011 and December 2015. There were 15 males and 28 females, aged 12-18 years (mean, 16 years). The preoperative Cobb angle was (50.1±11.3)°. The anteroposterior and lateral radiographs were taken at preoperation, immediate after operation, and last follow-up to measure the radiographic parameters. Forty-three patients were divided into adding-on group and control group according to whether or not the occurrence of distal adding-on phenomenon on anteroposterior radiographs of the spine at last follow-up. All the factors that maybe cause distsal adding-on were evaluated by statistical analysis.
The patients were followed up 12-50 months (mean, 26.5 months). At last follow-up, distal adding-on was observed in 10 of 43 patients (23.3%), including 2 males (13.3%) and 8 females (28.6%). Univariate analyses showed following several factors associated with adding-on:preoperative lumbar flexibility, preoperative pelvic tilt in coronal plane, preoperative LIV+1 deviation from center sacral vertical line, L4 subtype, the difference between LIV and last touching vertebra (LTV) (LIV-LTV), the difference between LIV and lower end vertebra (LEV) (LIV-LEV), and the difference between LIV and stable vertebra (SV) (LIV-SV). The risk factors above were brought into Logistic regression model, the results showed that preoperative LIV+1 deviation (deviation&gt;10 mm, odds ratio=10.812, P=0.026), LIV-LTV (LIV-LTV&lt;1, odds ratio=9.017, P=0.04), and L4 subtype (1A-R, odds ratio=9.744, P=0.047) were significantly associated with adding-on.
Preoperative LIV+1 deviation of &gt;10 mm, L4 subtype (1A-R) and LIV-LTV of &lt;1 are independent predictive factors of adding-on after surgery. As high risk of adding-on was closely related with the incorrect fusion level, it plays an important role for surgeons to decide the level of the fusion before surgery thoroughly. The LIV should be extended at least to LTV+1 to avoid adding-on phenomenon.
对Lenke 1A型青少年特发性脊柱侧凸行后路选择性胸弯融合术后远端叠加现象的发生率进行研究,对可能的危险因素进行分析,以期得出更为合理的远端固定椎（lowest instrumented vertebra,LIV）选择策略。.
回顾性分析2011年7月-2015年12月行后路椎弓根螺钉系统选择性胸弯融合术矫正治疗的43例Lenke 1A型脊柱侧凸患者。其中男15例,女28例;年龄12～18岁,平均16岁。术前主胸弯Cobb角（50.1±11.3）°。所有患者均在术前、术后即刻及末次随访时摄站立位脊柱全长正侧位X线片,测量手术前后各影像学参数。在末次随访X线片上判定是否发生了术后远端叠加现象,将发生远端叠加现象的患者纳入叠加组,未叠加患者为非叠加组。将可能发生叠加现象的参数进行统计分析。.
43例均获随访,随访时间12～50个月,平均26.5个月。末次随访时10例（23.3%）发生了远端叠加现象,其中男2例（13.3%）,女8例（28.6%）。单因素分析显示,两组间比较术前腰弯柔韧性、术前骨盆冠状面倾斜角、术前LIV+1与骶骨中线偏移距离、L4亚分型、LIV与远端触及椎（last touching vertebra,LTV）节段差距（LIV-LTV）、LIV与下端椎（lower end vertebra,LEV）节段差距（LIV-LEV）、LIV与稳定椎（stable vertebra,SV）节段差距（LIV-SV）7个参数差异有统计学意义（P＜0.05）;而性别、年龄、Risser征、LIV与中立椎节段差距、手术前后主胸弯Cobb角、术前主胸弯柔韧性、术前代偿性腰弯Cobb角及术后代偿性腰弯残余角、术前顶椎偏移、术前LIV倾斜角、术后主胸弯及腰弯Cobb角矫正率、术后顶椎偏移、末次随访时主胸弯及腰弯Cobb角矫正丢失等参数差异均无统计学意义（P＞0.05）。将差异有统计学意义的7个变量带入Logistic回归模型,采用逐步回归法进行变量筛选,结果显示术前LIV+1偏移（＞10 mm,OR值=10.812,P=0.026）、LIV-LTV（＜1,OR值=9.017,P=0.040）、L4亚分型（L4向右倾斜,OR值=9.744,P=0.047）与远端叠加现象明显相关。.
术前LIV+1偏移＞10 mm、LIV-LTV&lt;1、L4亚分型（L4向右倾斜）是术后发生叠加现象的独立危险因素。由于叠加现象的发生与远端融合平面的选择密切相关,因此术前应全面考虑下端融合平面并且至少延伸至LTV+1,以防止术后远端叠加现象的发生。.
Viral diseases are considered main threats that face the humanity worldwide. The emergence of new viruses like influenza viruses emphasizes the significance of designing novel antiviral drugs.
The aim of this work is to synthesize a new set of nucleoside and non-nucleoside cyanopyridine, characterized and evaluated for their in vitro antiviral properties against various strains.
More than compounds showed variable antiviral potential against a panel of eighteen DNA and RNA viruses. The screening data suggested that the order of activity of the active compounds are in the order of O-glycosyl &gt; O-alkyl &gt; N-alkyl &gt; S-alkyl derivatives. In addition, the 4-fluoro substituted compounds are more effective among the O- and N-alkyl analogs, whereas remarkable antiviral activity was ascribed to the methoxylated O-glycosyl derivatives. Most of the active compounds proved to be more selective towards the inhibition of the replication of DNA- rather than the RNA-viruses. The analogs 1a, 2a, 12b, 14b and 16b possessed broad spectrum and noticeable antiviral potential against most of the tested DNA- and RNA-viruses (EC50 ≈ 0.8-20 µM), accompanied with considerably low cytotoxic margin (MCC ≈ 4-20 µM), and comparable with reference standard antiviral agents.
Objectives To evaluate the association between hypoxia during embryo development and oral clefts in an animal model, and to evaluate the association between polymorphisms in the HIF-1A gene with oral clefts in human families. Material and Methods The study with the animal model used zebrafish embryos at 8 hours post-fertilization submitted to 30% and 50% hypoxia for 24 hours. At 5 days post-fertilization, the larvae were fixed. The cartilage structures were stained to evaluate craniofacial phenotypes. The family-based association study included 148 Brazilian nuclear families with oral clefts. The association between the genetic polymorphisms rs2301113 and rs2057482 in HIF-1A with oral clefts was tested. We used real time PCR genotyping approach. ANOVA with Tukey's post-test was used to compare means. The transmission/disequilibrium test was used to analyze the distortion of the inheritance of alleles from parents to their affected offspring. Results For the hypoxic animal model, the anterior portion of the ethmoid plate presented a gap in the anterior edge, forming a cleft. The hypoxia level was associated with the severity of the phenotype (p&lt;0.0001). For the families, there was no under-transmitted allele among the affected progeny (p&gt;0.05). Conclusion Hypoxia is involved in the oral cleft etiology, however, polymorphisms in HIF-1A are not associated with oral clefts in humans.
Computational studies on five membered heterocycles with single heteroatom and their isomeric dehydro-borole 1a-c, cyclopentadiene 2a-c, pyrrole 3a-c, furan 4b-c, phosphole 5a-c and thiophene 6b-c radicals have been carried out. Geometrical aspects through ground state electronic structures and stability aspects using bond dissociation energies (BDE) and radical stabilization energies (RSE) have been envisaged in this regard. Spin densities, electrostatic potentials (ESP) and natural bond orbital (NBO) analysis unveiled the extent of spin delocalization. The estimated nucleus-independent chemical shifts (NICS) values revealed the difference in aromaticity characteristics of radicals. Particularly the heteroatom centered radicals exhibit odd electron -delocalized systems with a quasi-antiaromatic character. Various factors such as, the relative position of the radical center with respect to heteroatoms, resonance, ring strain and orbital interactions influence the stability that follows the order: heteroatom centered &gt; β-centered &gt; α-centered radicals. Among the influences of various factors, we confirmed the existence of a competition between delocalization and the ring strain, and the interplay of both decides the overall stability order.
Accumulating data indicate that long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) serve as important modulators in biological processes and are dysregulated in diverse tumors. The function of FOXD2-AS1 in gastric cancer (GC) progression and related biological mechanisms remain undefined. A comprehensive analysis identified that FOXD2-AS1 enrichment was upregulated markedly in GC and positively correlated with a large tumor size, a later pathologic stage, and a poor prognosis. Gene-set enrichment analysis (GSEA) in GEO datasets uncovered that cell cycle and DNA replication associated genes were enriched in patients with high FOXD2-AS1 expression. Loss of FOXD2-AS1 function inhibited cell growth via inhibiting the cell cycle in GC, whereas upregulation of FOXD2-AS1 expression promoted cancer progression. The enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) and lysine (K)-specific demethylase 1A (LSD1) proteins were found to serve as binding partners of FOXD2-AS1 and mediators of FOXD2-AS1 function. Mechanically, FOXD2-AS1 promoted GC tumorigenesis partly through EZH2 and LSD1 mediated EphB3 downregulation. The present results revealed that FOXD2-AS1 acted as a tumor inducer in GC partly through EphB3 inhibition by direct interaction with EZH2 and LSD1, and may prove to be a potential biomarker of carcinogenesis.
Consumer values, including but not limited to materialism, have received much less attention than other topics within research on Asian Americans.
Across 3 studies (N = 6,955), the author explored the difference between Asian Americans and White/European Americans on materialism, and the mediating and moderating mechanisms.
Studies 1a-1c found Asian Americans, compared to White/European Americans, more strongly endorsed materialistic values. In Study 2, the author tested a multiple mediation model and demonstrated that Asian Americans, compared to White/European Americans, more strongly endorse materialistic values because they reported higher extrinsic aspirations (i.e., stronger desires for money, image, and popularity). Finally, in Study 3, the author tested a moderation model and found that Asian Americans who are higher on a general tendency to adhere to norms endorse a greater level of materialism than White/European Americans.
The author discussed how these results have implications for expanding the research topics within research on Asian Americans, consequences for mental health and provide future directions to counteract materialism. (PsycINFO Database Record
Four previously undescribed isochromanes were isolated from the fermentation broth of an endophytic fungus Aspergillus fumigatus, which was obtained from the fruiting body of Cordyceps sinensis. Their structures were elucidated through extensive spectroscopic analyses. One racemic isochromane was further purified by chiral HPLC to yield a pair of enantiomers and their absolute configurations were determined by quantum chemical ECD calculations. These isolated compounds were evaluated for cytotoxicity against two cell lines (MV4-11 and MDA-ME-231) and the result showed that compounds 1a and 2 exhibited moderate growth inhibition against MV4-11 cell line.
Rapid industrialization and urbanization pose pressure on water resources in China. Virtual water trade proves to be an increasingly useful tool in water stress alleviation for water-scarce regions, while bringing opportunities and challenges for less developed water-rich regions. In this study, Yunnan, a typical province in southwest China, was selected as the case study area to explore its potential in socio-economic development in the context of water sustainability. Both input-output analysis and structural decomposition analysis on Yunnan's water footprint for the period of 2002-2012 were performed at not only an aggregated level but also a sectoral level. Results show that although the virtual water content of all economic sectors decreased due to technological progress, Yunnan's total water footprint still increased as a result of economic scale expansion. From the sectoral perspective, sectors with large water footprints include construction sector, agriculture sector, food manufacturing &amp; processing sector, and service sector, while metal products sector and food manufacturing &amp; processing sector were the major virtual water exporters, and textile &amp; clothing sector and construction sector were the major importers. Based on local conditions, policy suggestions were proposed, including economic structure and efficiency optimization, technology promotion and appropriate virtual water trade scheme. This study provides valuable insights for regions facing "resource curse" by exploring potential socio-economic progress while ensuring water security.
Although childhood maltreatment is associated with long-term impairment, some children function well despite this adversity. This study aimed to identify the key protective factors for good educational attainment and positive emotional health in adolescents who experienced maltreatment in early childhood. Data were analyzed from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children, a large UK prospective cohort study. The sample was defined by maternally reported exposure to physical or emotional maltreatment by a parent prior to 5 years. 1118 (8.0%) children were emotionally maltreated and 375 (2.7%) were physically maltreated before the age of 5. There were too few cases of sexual abuse to be considered. Positive outcomes were operationalized as achieving 5 or more grade A*-C GCSE exam grades at 16 years and scores above the cohort median on the self-report Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale and Bachmann Self-Esteem Scale at 17.5 years. The associations of individual, family and community covariates with successful adaptation to the adversity of maltreatment were investigated using logistic regression. School related factors, including engagement in extracurricular activities, satisfaction with school and not being bullied were the most important in facilitating resilience in educational attainment, self-esteem and wellbeing. Good communication and social skills was the most protective individual trait. There was insufficient evidence to suggest that family factors were associated with resilience to maltreatment. School-based interventions are recommended to promote positive adaptation following parental maltreatment. Future research should evaluate outcomes across the life-course to understand whether the protective influences of school persist into adulthood.
Many mountainous regions with high wind energy potential are characterized by multi-scale variabilities of vegetation in both spatial and time dimensions, which strongly affect the spatial distribution of wind resource and its time evolution. To this end, we developed a coupled interdisciplinary modeling framework capable of assessing the shifts in wind energy potential following land-use driven vegetation dynamics in complex mountain terrain. It was applied to a case study area in the Romanian Carpathians. The results show that the overall shifts in wind energy potential following the changes of vegetation pattern due to different land-use policies can be dramatic. This suggests that the planning of wind energy project should be integrated with the land-use planning at a specific site to ensure that the expected energy production of the planned wind farm can be reached over its entire lifetime. Moreover, the changes in the spatial distribution of wind and turbulence under different scenarios of land-use are complex, and they must be taken into account in the micro-siting of wind turbines to maximize wind energy production and minimize fatigue loads (and associated maintenance costs). The proposed new modeling framework offers, for the first time, a powerful tool for assessing long-term variability in local wind energy potential that emerges from land-use change driven vegetation dynamics over complex terrain. Following a previously unexplored pathway of cause-effect relationships, it demonstrates a new linkage of agro- and forest policies in landscape development with an ultimate trade-off between renewable energy production and biodiversity targets. Moreover, it can be extended to study the potential effects of micro-climatic changes associated with wind farms on vegetation development (growth and patterning), which could in turn have a long-term feedback effect on wind resource distribution in mountainous regions.
Brain aging and associated neurodegeneration constitute a major societal challenge as well as one for the neuroimaging community. A full understanding of the physiological mechanisms underlying neurodegeneration still eludes medical researchers, fuelling the development of in vivo neuroimaging markers. Hence it is increasingly recognized that our understanding of neurodegenerative processes likely will depend upon the available information provided by imaging techniques. At the same time, the imaging techniques are often developed in response to the desire to observe certain physiological processes. In this context, functional MRI (fMRI), which has for decades provided information on neuronal activity, has evolved into a large family of techniques well suited for in vivo observations of brain physiology. Given the rapid technical advances in fMRI in recent years, this review aims to summarize the physiological basis of fMRI observations in healthy aging as well as in age-related neurodegeneration. This review focuses on in-vivo human brain imaging studies in this review and on disease features that can be imaged using fMRI methods. In addition to providing detailed literature summaries, this review also discusses future directions in the study of brain physiology using fMRI in the clinical setting.
DiNP (Di-isononyl phthalate) has been recently introduced as DEHP (Bis (2-ethylhexyl) phthalate) substitute and due to its chemical properties, DiNP is commonly used in a large variety of plastic items. The endocannabinoid system (ECS) is a lipid signaling system involved in a plethora of physiological pathways including the control of the reproductive and metabolic processes. In this study, the effects of DiNP on the ECS of zebrafish (male and female) gonads were analyzed. Adult zebrafish were chronically exposed for 21 days via water to 3 environmentally relevant concentrations of DiNP (42 μg/L; 4.2 μg/L; 0.42 μg/L). In females, the Gonadosomatic Index (GSI) and the number of fertilized eggs were reduced by the lowest concentration of DiNP tested. The levels of two endocannabinoids, Anandamide (AEA) and 2-Arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG), were not affected, while a reduction of the N-oleoyl-ethanolamine (OEA) level was observed. Transcriptional changes were reported in relation to genes coding for the ECS receptors and the enzymes involved in the ECS pathway. DiNP exposure in males reduced the GSI as well as changed the levels of endocannabinoids. Moreover, DiNP treatment induced significative changes in the genes coding for the ECS receptors and enzymes, and significantly increased the activity of the fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH). In summary, in zebrafish, exposure to environmentally relevant concentrations of DiNP disrupted the ECS and affected reproduction in a gender specific manner.
Synthetic azo dyes have increasingly become a matter of great concern as a result of the genotoxic and mutagenic potential of the products derived from azo dye biotransformation. This work evaluates the manner in which reducing enzymes produced by Escherichia coli (E. coli) act on three disperse dyes bearing azo groups, namely Disperse Red 73 (DR 73), Disperse Red 78 (DR 78), and Disperse Red 167 (DR 167). UV-Vis spectrophotometry, high-performance liquid chromatography with diode array detector (HPLC-DAD), and liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) were applied towards the identification of the main products. Seven days of incubation of the azo dyes with the tested enzymes yielded a completely bleached solution. 3-4-Aminophenyl-ethyl-amino-propanitrile was detected following the biotransformation of both DR 73 and DR 78. 4-Nitroaniline and 2-chloro-4-nitroaniline were detected upon the biotransformation of DR 73 and DR 78, respectively. The main products derived from the biotransformation of DR 167 were dimethyl 3,3'-3-acetamido-4-aminophenyl-azanedyl-dipropanoate and 2-chloro-4-nitroaniline. The results imply that DR 73 lost the CN- substituent during the biotransformation. Furthermore, theoretical calculations were also carried out aiming at evaluating the interaction and reactivity of these compounds with DNA. Taken together, the results indicate that DR 73, DR 78, and DR 167 pose health risks and serious threats to both human beings and the environment at large as their biotransformation produces harmful compounds such as amines, which have been widely condemned by the International Agency for Research on Cancer.
Pedobarography produces large sets of plantar pressure samples that are routinely subsampled (e.g. using regions of interest) or aggregated (e.g. center of pressure trajectories, peak pressure images) in order to simplify statistical analysis and provide intuitive clinical measures.
We hypothesize that these data reductions discard gait information that can be used to differentiate between groups or conditions.
To test the hypothesis of null information loss, we created an implementation of statistical parametric mapping (SPM) for dynamic plantar pressure datasets (i.e. plantar pressure videos). Our SPM software framework brings all plantar pressure videos into anatomical and temporal correspondence, then performs statistical tests at each sampling location in space and time. Novelly, we introduce non-linear temporal registration into the framework in order to normalize for timing differences within the stance phase. We refer to our software framework as STAPP: spatiotemporal analysis of plantar pressure measurements. Using STAPP, we tested our hypothesis on plantar pressure videos from 33 healthy subjects walking at different speeds.
As walking speed increased, STAPP was able to identify significant decreases in plantar pressure at mid-stance from the heel through the lateral forefoot. The extent of these plantar pressure decreases has not previously been observed using existing plantar pressure analysis techniques.
We therefore conclude that the subsampling of plantar pressure videos - a task which led to the discarding of gait information in our study - can be avoided using STAPP.
Although liquid phase exfoliation is a powerful method to produce MoS2 nanosheets in large scale, but its effectiveness is limited by the diversity of produced nanosheets sizes. Here a novel approach for separation of MoS2 flakes having various lateral sizes and thicknesses based on the cascaded centrifugation has been introduced. This method involves a pre-separation step which is performed through low-speed centrifugation to avoid the deposition of large area single and few-layers by the heavier particles. The bulk MoS2 powders were dispersed in an aqueous solution of sodium cholate (SC) and sonicated for 12 h. The main separation step was performed using different speed centrifugation intervals of 10-11, 8-10, 6-8, 4-6, 2-4 and 0.5-2 krpm by which nanosheets containing 2, 4, 7, 8, 14, 18 and 29 layers were obtained respectively. The samples were characterized using XRD, FESEM, AFM, TEM, DLS and also UV-vis, Raman and PL spectroscopy measurements. Dynamic light scattering (DLS) measurements have confirmed the existence of a larger number of single or few-layers MoS2 nanosheets compared to when the pre-separation step was not used. Finally, Photocurrent and cyclic voltammetry of different samples were measured and found that the flakes with bigger surface area had larger CV loop area. Our results provide a method for the preparation of a MoS2 monolayer enriched suspension which can be used for different applications.
End-stage renal disease, the last and most severe stage of chronic kidney disease, represents a major and rising concern for countries in Latin America, driven in large part by aging populations and the near-epidemic rises in diabetes, obesity, and hypertension. This places a great clinical, economic, and social burden on the region's health systems. During the ISPOR 6th Latin America Conference held in Sao Paulo, Brazil, in September 2017, an educational forum debated on value-based decision making in the treatment of end-stage renal disease in Latin America. We summarize the current state and how to build strategies and implement actions to move to a more patient-centered, outcomes-based approach for renal care in the region, taken from the discussions in the conference and also from a literature review. Models of renal care used in Ontario (Canada), Colombia, and a Chilean hospital stress the importance of empowering and supporting patients and their families, allowing for a better coordination between primary care providers and specialists, providing financial incentives to health units, and establishing an entity that holds insurers and providers accountable for health outcomes and costs of treatment. The study uses the framework of value-based health care for the evaluation of different dialysis options-peritoneal dialysis, hemodialysis, home dialysis, and so forth-and calls for the countries to adopt an integrated care model. We emphasize that countries in Latin America need to recognize the chronic kidney disease challenge and develop health systems and efficient renal care models to be able to reduce the burden of the disease.
Excessive existences of nutrients such as phosphate in the aqueous environment remain as a heavy concern although many researches have been reported for dealing with their removal. Based on the understanding toward the interactions of Fe compounds with phosphate and carbonate from many available researches, we designed a very simple and efficient approach for phosphate removal by using in situ generated fresh trivalent Fe composition through the interaction of Fe(II) as FeSO4 on CaCO3. Addition and agitation of Fe(II) and CaCO3 simultaneously to phosphate solution allowed an amorphous Fe(III)-P or Ca-Fe(III)-P precipitation, with a phosphate removal rate close to 100%, to reduce the residual phosphorus concentration less than 0.03 mg/L from 100 mg/L, reaching the discharge limit, even with the addition amounts of CaCO3 as low as a stoichiometric ratio of CaCO3/PO43- at 0.9 and ratio of Fe(II)/PO43- at 1.5, and the percent of P2O5 in the precipitate was as high as 19.4% enough as phosphate source for fertilizer production. Different from the alkaline process with enough OH- group, the slow hydrolysis of CaCO3 resulting in low concentration of OH- group for the formation of Fe(OH)2, which was oxidized soon by air into trivalent Fe, achieved a continuous generation of fresh ferric composition for phosphate precipitation and could avoid its rapid formation and subsequent transformation into stable FeOOH of large particle size to lose the activity. These results based on the synergistic effect of using CaCO3 and Fe(II) together may have applications in the treatment of eutrophic wastewater through a process with many advantages of easy operation and low-cost besides the high removal efficiency with phosphate percentage inside the precipitate high enough to serve for fertilizer production.
Niemann-Pick type C (NPC) disease is a fatal neurodegenerative disorder characterized by over-accumulation of low-density lipoprotein-derived cholesterol and glycosphingolipids in late endosomes/lysosomes (LE/L) throughout the body. Human mutations in either NPC1 or NPC2 genes have been directly associated with impaired cholesterol efflux from LE/L. Independent from its role in cholesterol homeostasis and its NPC2 partner, NPC1 was unexpectedly identified as a critical player controlling intracellular entry of filoviruses such as Ebola. In this study, a yeast three-hybrid system revealed that the NPC1 cytoplasmic tail directly interacts with the clathrin adaptor protein AP-1 via its acidic/di-leucine motif. Consequently, a nonfunctional AP-1A cytosolic complex resulted in a typical NPC-like phenotype mainly due to a direct impairment of NPC1 trafficking to LE/L and a partial secretion of NPC2. Furthermore, the mislocalization of NPC1 was not due to cholesterol accumulation in LE/L, as it was not rescued upon treatment with Mβ-cyclodextrin, which almost completely eliminated intracellular free cholesterol. Our cumulative data demonstrate that the cytosolic clathrin adaptor AP-1A is essential for the lysosomal targeting and function of NPC1 and NPC2.
Oxysterol-binding protein (OSBP) and its related proteins (ORPs) constitute a large and evolutionarily conserved family of lipid-binding proteins that target organelle membranes to mediate sterol signaling and/or transport. Here we characterize ORP5, a tail-anchored ORP protein that localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum. Knocking down ORP5 causes cholesterol accumulation in late endosomes and lysosomes, which is reminiscent of the cholesterol trafficking defect in Niemann Pick C (NPC) fibroblasts. Cholesterol appears to accumulate in the limiting membranes of endosomal compartments in ORP5-depleted cells, whereas depletion of NPC1 or both ORP5 and NPC1 results in luminal accumulation of cholesterol. Moreover, trans-Golgi resident proteins mislocalize to endosomal compartments upon ORP5 depletion, which depends on a functional NPC1. Our results establish the first link between NPC1 and a cytoplasmic sterol carrier, and suggest that ORP5 may cooperate with NPC1 to mediate the exit of cholesterol from endosomes/lysosomes.
Niemann-Pick type C disease (NPC) is a rare neurodegenerative disorder characterised by lysosomal/late endosomal accumulation of endocytosed unesterified cholesterol and delayed induction of cholesterol homeostatic reactions. The large majority of mutations in the NPC1 gene described thus far have been associated with severe cellular cholesterol trafficking impairment (classic biochemical phenotype, present in about 85% of NPC patients). In our population of 13 unrelated NP-C1 patients, among which 12 were of Portuguese extraction, we observed an unusually large proportion of families presenting mild alterations of intracellular cholesterol transport (variant biochemical phenotype), without strict correlation between the biochemical phenotype and the clinical expression of the disease. Mutational studies were carried out to compare molecular lesions associated with severe and mild cholesterol traffic impairment. Levels of NPC1 protein were studied by Western blot in cultured fibroblasts of four patients with homozygous mutant alleles. Ten novel mutations were identified (Q92R, C177Y, R518W, W942C, R978C, A1035V, 2129delA, 3662delT, IVS23+1 G&gt;A and IVS16-82 G&gt;A). The mutational profile appeared to be correlated with the biochemical phenotype. Splicing mutations, I1061T and A1035V, corresponded to "classic" alleles, while three missense mutations, C177Y, R978C and P1007A, could be defined as "variant" alleles. All "variant" mutations described so far appear to be clustered within the cysteine-rich luminal loop between TM 8 and 9, with the remarkable exception of C177Y. The latter mutant allele, at variance with P1007A, was correlated to a decreased level of NPC1 protein and a severe course of the disease, and disclosed a new location for "variant" mutations, the luminal loop located at the N-terminal end of the protein.
Glycosphingolipids are endocytosed and targeted to the Golgi apparatus but are mistargeted to lysosomes in sphingolipid storage disorders. Substrate reduction therapy utilizes imino sugars to inhibit glucosylceramide synthase and potentially abrogate the effects of storage. Niemann-Pick type C (NPC) disease is a disorder of intracellular transport where glycosphingolipids (GSLs) and cholesterol accumulate in endosomal compartments. The mechanisms of altered intracellular trafficking are not known but may involve the mistargeting and disrupted function of proteins associated with GSL membrane microdomains. Membrane microdomains were isolated by Triton X-100 and sucrose density gradient ultracentrifugation. High pressure liquid chromatography and mass spectrometric analysis of NPC1(-/-) mouse brain revealed large increases in GSL. Sphingosine was also found to be a component of membrane microdomains, and in NPC liver and spleen, large increases in cholesterol and sphingosine were found. GSL and cholesterol levels were increased in mutant NPC1-null Chinese hamster ovary cells as well as U18666A and progesterone induced NPC cell culture models. However, inhibition of GSL synthesis in NPC cells with N-butyldeoxygalactonojirimycin led to marked decreases in GSL but only small decreases in cholesterol levels. Both annexin 2 and 6, membrane-associated proteins that are important in endocytic trafficking, show distorted distributions in NPC cells. Altered BODIPY lactosylceramide targeting, decreased endocytic uptake of a fluid phase marker, and mistargeting of annexin 2 (phenotypes associated with NPC) are reversed by inhibition of GSL synthesis. It is suggested that accumulating GSL is part of a mislocalized membrane microdomain and is responsible for the deficit in endocytic trafficking found in NPC disease.
Progesterone, the cationic amphiphile U18666A and a phospholipase inhibitor (Methyl Arachidonyl Fluoro Phosphonate, MAFP) inhibited by 70%-90% HIV production in viral reservoir cells, i.e. human THP-1 monocytes and monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM). These compounds triggered an inhibition of fluid phase endocytosis (macropinocytosis) and modified cellular lipid homeostasis since endosomes accumulated filipin-stained sterols and Bis(Monoacylglycero)Phosphate (BMP). BMP was quantified using a new cytometry procedure and was increased by 1.25 times with MAFP, 1.7 times with U18666A and 2.5 times with progesterone. MAFP but not progesterone or U18666A inhibited the hydrolysis of BMP by the Pancreatic Lipase Related Protein 2 (PLRP2) as shown by in-vitro experiments. The possible role of sterol transporters in steroid-mediated BMP increase is discussed. Electron microscopy showed the accumulation of viral particles either into large intracellular viral-containing compartments or outside the cells, indicating that endosomal accumulation of BMP could block intracellular biogenesis of viral particles while inhibition of macropinocytosis would prevent viral particle uptake. This is the first report linking BMP metabolism with a natural steroid such as progesterone or with involvement of a phospholipase A1 activity. BMP cellular content could be used as a biomarker for efficient anti-viral drugs. 
A central feature of Niemann-Pick Type C (NPC) disease is sequestration of cholesterol and glycosphingolipids in lysosomes. A large phenotypic variability, on both a clinical as well as a molecular level, challenges NPC diagnosis. For example, substantial difficulties in identifying or excluding NPC in a patient exist in cases with a "variant" biochemical phenotype, where cholesterol levels in cultured fibroblasts, the primary diagnostic indicator, are only moderately elevated. Here we apply quantitative microscopy as an accurate and objective diagnostic tool to measure cholesterol accumulation at the level of single cells. When employed to characterize cholesterol enrichment in fibroblasts from 20 NPC patients and 11 controls, considerable heterogeneity became evident both within the population of cells cultured from one individual as well as between samples from different probands. An obvious correlation between biochemical phenotype and clinical disease course was not apparent from our dataset. However, plasma levels of HDL-cholesterol (HDL-c) tended to be in the normal range in patients with a "variant" as opposed to a "classic" biochemical phenotype. Attenuated lysosomal cholesterol accumulation in "variant" cells was associated with detectable NPC1 protein and residual capability to upregulate expression of ABCA1 in response to LDL. Taken together, our approach opens perspectives not only to support diagnosis, but also to better characterize mechanisms impacting cholesterol accumulation in NPC patient-derived cells.
Promoting lysosomal trafficking represents a promising therapeutic approach for lysosome storage diseases. Efficient Ca(2+) mobilization from lysosomes is important for lysosomal trafficking. Ca(2+) release from lysosomes could generate a negative potential in the lumen to disturb subsequent Ca(2+) release in the absence of counter ion flux. Here we report that lysosomes express big-conductance Ca(2+)-activated potassium (BK) channels that form physical and functional coupling with the lysosomal Ca(2+) release channel, TRPML1. Ca(2+) release via TRPML1 causes BK activation, which in turn facilitates further lysosomal Ca(2+) release and membrane trafficking. Importantly, BK overexpression rescues the impaired TRPML1-mediated Ca(2+) release and abnormal lysosomal storage in cells from Niemann-Pick C1 patients. Therefore, we have identified a lysosomal K(+) channel that provides a positive feedback mechanism to facilitate TRPML1-mediated Ca(2+) release and membrane trafficking. Our findings suggest that upregulating BK may be a potential therapeutic strategy for certain lysosomal storage diseases and common neurodegenerative disorders. 
The filovirus surface glycoprotein (GP) mediates viral entry into host cells. Following viral internalization into endosomes, GP is cleaved by host cysteine proteases to expose a receptor-binding site (RBS) that is otherwise hidden from immune surveillance. Here, we present the crystal structure of proteolytically cleaved Ebola virus GP to a resolution of 3.3 Å. We use this structure in conjunction with functional analysis of a large panel of pseudotyped viruses bearing mutant GP proteins to map the Ebola virus GP endosomal RBS at molecular resolution. Our studies indicate that binding of GP to its endosomal receptor Niemann-Pick C1 occurs in two distinct stages: the initial electrostatic interactions are followed by specific interactions with a hydrophobic trough that is exposed on the endosomally cleaved GP1 subunit. Finally, we demonstrate that monoclonal antibodies targeting the filovirus RBS neutralize all known filovirus GPs, making this conserved pocket a promising target for the development of panfilovirus therapeutics.
Ebola virus uses its glycoprotein (GP) to enter new host cells. During entry, GP must be cleaved by human enzymes in order for receptor binding to occur. Here, we provide the crystal structure of the cleaved form of Ebola virus GP. We demonstrate that cleavage exposes a site at the top of GP and that this site binds the critical domain C of the receptor, termed Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1). We perform mutagenesis to find parts of the site essential for binding NPC1 and map distinct roles for an upper, charged crest and lower, hydrophobic trough in cleaved GP. We find that this 3-dimensional site is conserved across the filovirus family and that antibody directed against this site is able to bind cleaved GP from every filovirus tested and neutralize viruses bearing those GPs.
Filovirus infection is mediated by engagement of the surface-exposed glycoprotein (GP) by its cellular receptor, NPC1 (Niemann-Pick C1). Two loops in the C domain of NPC1 (NPC1-C) bind filovirus GP. Herein, we show that filovirus GP and NPC1-C evolve under mutual selective pressure. Analysis of a large mammalian phylogeny indicated that strong functional/structural constraints limit the NPC1 sequence space available for adaptive change and most sites at the contact interface with GP are under negative selection. These constraints notwithstanding, we detected positive selection at NPC1-C in all mammalian orders, from Primates to Xenarthra. Different codons evolved adaptively in distinct mammals, and most selected sites are located within the two NPC1-C loops that engage GP, or at their anchor points. In Homininae, NPC1-C was a preferential selection target, and the T419I variant possibly represents a human-specific adaptation to filovirus infection. On the other side of the arms-race, GP evolved adaptively during filovirus speciation. One of the selected sites (S142Q) establishes several atom-to-atom contacts with NPC1-C. Additional selected sites are located within epitopes recognized by neutralizing antibodies, including the 14G7 epitope, where sites selected during the recent EBOV epidemic also map. Finally, pairs of co-evolving sites in Marburgviruses and Ebolaviruses were found to involve antigenic determinants. These findings suggest that the host humoral immune response was a major selective pressure during filovirus speciation. The S142Q variant may contribute to determine Ebolavirus host range in the wild. If this were the case, EBOV/BDBV (S142) and SUDV (Q142) may not share the same reservoir(s).
Cardiovascular morbidity and mortality are of increasing concern, not only to patients but also to the health care profession and service providers. The preventative benefit of treatment of dyslipidaemia is unquestioned but there is a large, so far unmet need to improve clinical outcome. There are exciting new discoveries of targets that may translate into improved clinical outcome. Areas covered: This review highlights some new pathways in cholesterol and triglyceride metabolism and examines new targets, new drugs and new molecules. The review includes the results of recent trials of relatively new drugs that have shown benefit in cardiovascular endpoint outcomes, drugs that have been licenced without endpoint trials yet available and new drugs that have not yet been licenced but have produced exciting results in animal studies and some in early phase 2 human studies. Expert opinion: The new areas that have been discovered as the cause of dyslipidaemia have opened up a host of new targets for new drugs including antisense RNA's, microRNA's and human monoclonal antibodies. The plethora of new targets and new drugs has made it an extraordinarily exciting time in the development of therapeutics to combat atherosclerosis.
Lutein accumulates in the macula and brain, where it is assumed to play physiologic roles. The bioavailability of lutein is assumed to display a high interindividual variability that has been hypothesized to be attributable, at least partly, to genetic polymorphisms.
We characterized the interindividual variability in lutein bioavailability in humans, assessed the relation between this variability and the fasting blood lutein concentration, and identified single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) involved in this phenomenon.
In a randomized, 2-way crossover study, 39 healthy men consumed a meal that contained a lutein supplement or the same meal for which lutein was provided through a tomato puree. The lutein concentration was measured in plasma chylomicrons isolated at regular time intervals over 8 h postprandially. Multivariate statistical analyses were used to identify a combination of SNPs associated with the postprandial chylomicron lutein response (0-8-h area under the curve). A total of 1785 SNPs in 51 candidate genes were selected.
Postprandial chylomicron lutein responses to meals were very variable (CV of 75% and 137% for the lutein-supplement meal and the meal with tomato-sourced lutein, respectively). Postprandial chylomicron lutein responses measured after the 2 meals were positively correlated (r = 0.68, P &lt; 0.0001) and positively correlated to the fasting plasma lutein concentration (r = 0.51, P &lt; 0.005 for the lutein-supplement-containing meal). A significant (P = 1.9 × 10(-4)) and validated partial least-squares regression model, which included 29 SNPs in 15 genes, explained most of the variance in the postprandial chylomicron lutein response.
The ability to respond to lutein appears to be, at least in part, genetically determined. The ability is explained, in large part, by a combination of SNPs in 15 genes related to both lutein and chylomicron metabolism. Finally, our results suggest that the ability to respond to lutein and blood lutein status are related. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT02100774.
The formation of cholesterol gallstones is a very complex and polygenic disorder that involves an alteration of the secretion of bile lipids, cholesterol crystallization, important immunological reactions in the gallbladder tissue, formation of biliary sludge composed of mucin, and inadequate gallbladder motility. The search for a therapeutic target is oriented towards decreasing bile secretion and intestinal absorption of cholesterol, in which Niemann-Pick C1L1 (NPC1L1) proteins play an important role. In basic and clinical studies, regulating the expression of these proteins can reduce intestinal, liver, plasma and bile cholesterol levels, a therapeutic effect that would be useful not only for treating the disease, but to prevent it, given the large quantity of risk factors. We discuss these effects in this review and propose NPC1L1 proteins as future therapeutic targets of cholesterol gallstones disease. 
Lipid metabolism is regulated by several factors, such as apolipoproteins, lipoprotein receptors, enzymes, and transfer proteins. From the early 1980s until now, molecular biology has been developing rapidly. Hence, genetic analyses have accelerated all over the world. Using these techniques, many genetic investigations have been performed in large-scale studies, which revealed the close associations between genetic abnormalities of the above-mentioned factors and a variety of dyslipidemic disorders. In recent years, novel genes which regulate cholesterol metabolism were reported. For instance, proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin type 9 (PCSK9) and autosomal recessive hypercholesterolemia (ARH) were found as causal genes in patients whose phenotypes are similar to familial hypercholesterolemia. Niemann-Pick C1-Like 1 (NPC1L1), ATP-binding cassette (ABC) A1 (ABCA1), and G5/G8 (ABCG5/G8) were also identified as cholesterol transporters in intestinal epithelial cells and hepatocytes. NPC1L1 is recognized as a target of ezetimibe, a cholesterol absorption inhibitor classified into a new class of lipid-lowering agents. However, we have not been fully successful in identifying candidate genes for all dyslipidemias. In this review, we summarize major dyslipidemic disorders and their causal genes, pathosis, clinical features, diagnosis, and therapeutic approaches. Because it is difficult to analyze genetic abnormalities in clinical laboratories at present, simple and convenient procedures for genetic analyses are expected to be developed in the near future. Such techniques may reveal unknown pathologics for heritable dyslipidemias, which may lead to the search for potential drug targets.
The Niemann-Pick C1 like 1 (NPC1L1) protein is a polytopic transmembrane protein responsible for dietary cholesterol absorption. Genetic variation in the NPC1L1 gene affects cholesterol absorption and serum cholesterol levels. However, NCP1L1 genotypes have not previously been invesigated. In this study, genotyping of the NPC1L1 gene was examined in healthy individuals as well as patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV) and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). A total of 541 individuals were enrolled in the study, including 80 patients with HCV hepatitis, 205 with ulcerative colitis (UC) and 127 with Crohn's disease (CD). Genotyping was performed using TaqMan® SNP assays. Minor allelic frequencies of the 17345C&gt;G (rs2072183) and 19031G&gt;A (rs4720470) SNPs were found to be 0.40 and 0.30, respectively. No significant differences were detected in serum HCV levels in the 1735C&gt;G or 19031G&gt;A SNPs. The 1735C&gt;G SNPs were not associated with total cholesterol (TC) levels in the healthy controls and/or HCV patients. However, statistically significant associations between the 1735GG variant and TC levels were detected in CD patients, with 1735GG carriers having the highest TC levels compared to the 1735CC and 1735CG carriers (P=0.048). Similar trends were noted in UC patients, but did not reach statistical significance (P= 0.19). The 19031G&gt;A SNPs were not associated with TC levels in the healthy controls or patients. This study showed the allelic and genotypic distribution of 1735C&gt;G and 19031G&gt;ASNPs of the NPC1L1 gene in a large number of subjects. The NPC1L1 1735GG variant may therefore be favorable for CD accompanied with malnutrition.
The small intestine plays a fundamentally important role in regulating whole body cholesterol balance and plasma lipoprotein composition. This is articulated through the interplay of a constellation of genes that ultimately determines the net amount of chylomicron cholesterol delivered to the liver. Major advances in our insights into regulation of the cholesterol absorption pathway have been made using genetically manipulated mouse models and agents such as ezetimibe. One unresolved question is how a sustained pharmacological inhibition of intestinal cholesterol synthesis in vivo may affect cholesterol handling by the absorptive cells. Here we show that the lanosterol cyclase inhibitor, Ro 48-8071, when fed to BALB/c mice in a chow diet (20 mg/day/kg body weight), leads to a rapid and sustained inhibition (&gt;50%) of cholesterol synthesis in the whole small intestine. Sterol synthesis was also reduced in the large intestine and stomach. In contrast, hepatic cholesterol synthesis, while markedly suppressed initially, rebounded to higher than baseline rates within 7 days. Whole body cholesterol synthesis, fractional cholesterol absorption, and fecal neutral and acidic sterol excretion were not consistently changed with Ro 48-8071 treatment. There were no discernible effects of this agent on intestinal histology as determined by H&amp;E staining and the level of Ki67, an index of proliferation. The mRNA expression for multiple genes involved in intestinal cholesterol regulation including NPC1L1 was mostly unchanged although there was a marked rise in the mRNA level for the PXR target genes CYP3A11 and CES2A.
CVD affect a large proportion of the world's population, with dyslipidaemia as the major risk factor. The regular consumption of both probiotic bacteria and yeast has been associated with improvement in the serum lipid profile. Thus, the present review aims to describe and discuss the potential mechanisms responsible for the hypocholesterolaemic effect of regular consumption of probiotic bacteria and yeast. Regarding the hypocholesterolaemic effect of probiotic bacteria, the potential mechanisms responsible include: deconjugation of bile salts; modulation of lipid metabolism; and decreased absorption of intestinal cholesterol through co-precipitation of intestinal cholesterol with the deconjugated bile salts, incorporation and assimilation of cholesterol in the cell membrane of the probiotics, intestinal conversion of cholesterol in coprostanol, and inhibition of the expression of the intestinal cholesterol transporter Niemann-Pick C1 like 1 (NPC1L1) in the enterocytes. The potential mechanisms responsible for the hypocholesterolaemic effect of probiotic yeasts include: deconjugation of bile salts; co-precipitation of intestinal cholesterol with the deconjugated bile salts; incorporation and assimilation of cholesterol in the cell membrane; and inhibition of hepatic cholesterol synthesis. The regular consumption of probiotic bacteria and yeast, as a non-pharmaceutical approach to help manage cardiovascular risk, holds promise, according to the beneficial hypocholesterolaemic effects described herein. However, the hypocholesterolaemic effects vary according to the strains used, the physiological state of the host, and the type of diet to which the probiotics are added. Further studies are necessary to fill the gaps with regard to the knowledge related to this topic.
Statins are used daily by a large and increasing number of individuals worldwide. They were initially designed as 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutharyl-coenzyme A reductase (HMG-CoAR) inhibitors to treat patients with hypercholesterolemia. Recent studies on HCV chronically infected individuals have suggested that their use in vivo in combination with PEG-IFN and ribavirin favor the sustained viral response (SVR). Herein, we describe the effects of a set of statins on HCV entry and on HCV key entry factors in vitro. Our results suggest that all tested statins exert a proviral effect through the upregulation of LDLR. Interestingly, at higher concentration, we also provide evidence of a yet unknown competing antiviral effect of statins (except for pravastatin) through the downregulation of CLDN-1. Importantly, this work enlightens the blunt proviral effect of pravastatin at the entry step of HCV in vitro.
Recent studies have associated endocrine-disrupting chemical (EDC) exposure with the increased risk of cardiovascular disease in humans, but the underlying mechanisms responsible for these associations remain elusive. Many EDCs have been implicated in activation of the nuclear receptor pregnane X receptor (PXR), which acts as a xenobiotic sensor to regulate xenobiotic metabolism in the liver and intestine. Here we report an important role of intestinal PXR in linking xenobiotic exposure and hyperlipidemia. We identified tributyl citrate (TBC), one of a large group of Food and Drug Administration-approved plasticizers for pharmaceutical or food applications, as a potent and selective PXR agonist. TBC efficiently activated PXR and induced PXR target gene expression in vitro and in vivo. Interestingly, TBC activated intestinal PXR but did not affect hepatic PXR activity. Exposure to TBC increased plasma total cholesterol and atherogenic low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels in wild-type mice, but not in PXR-deficient mice. TBC-mediated PXR activation stimulated the expression of an essential cholesterol transporter, Niemann-Pick C1-like 1 (NPC1L1), in the intestine. Promoter analysis revealed a DR-4 type of PXR response element in the human NPC1L1 promoter, and TBC promoted PXR recruitment onto the NPC1L1 promoter. Consistently, TBC treatment significantly increased lipid uptake by human and murine intestinal cells and deficiency of PXR inhibited TBC-elicited lipid uptake. These findings provide critical mechanistic insight for understanding the impact of EDC-mediated PXR activation on lipid homeostasis and demonstrate a potential role of PXR in mediating the adverse effects of EDCs on cardiovascular disease risk in humans. 
Ischemic heart disease is the main cause of death worldwide and it is accelerated by increased low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (LDL-C) and/or lipoprotein (a) (Lp(a)) concentrations. Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) alters both LDL-C and in part Lp(a) concentrations through its ability to induce degradation of the LDL receptor (LDLR). PCSK9, however, has additional targets which are potentially involved in lipid metabolism regulation such as the very low density lipoprotein receptor (VLDL), CD36 (cluster of differentiation 36) and the epithelial cholesterol transporter (NPC1L1) and it affects expression of apolipoprotein B48. The PCSK9 activity is tightly regulated at several levels by factors influencing its transcription, secretion, or by extracellular inactivation and clearance. Many comorbidities (kidney insufficiency, hypothyreoidism, hyperinsulinemia, inflammation) modify PCSK9 expression and release. Two humanized antibodies directed against extracellular PCSK9 received approval by the European and US authorities and additional PCSK9 directed therapeutics (such as silencing RNA) are already in clinical trials. Their results demonstrate a significant reduction in both LDL-C and Lp(a) concentrations - independent of the concomitant medication - and one of them reduced plaque size in high risk cardiovascular patients; results of two ongoing large clinical endpoints studies are awaited. In this review, we summarize and discuss the recent biological data on PCSK9, the regulation of PCSK9, and finally briefly summarize the data of recent clinical studies in the context of lipid metabolism.
Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) plays a causal role in atherosclerosis. One way to reduce LDL-C levels is to inhibit cholesterol absorption. Plant sterols and stanols compete with cholesterol for absorption in the intestine and induce an average decrease in LDL-C by 5% to 15% in a dose-dependent manner, but not in all individuals. This review focuses on the interindividual variability in response to dietary supplementation with plant sterols and stanols. Dietary plant sterols and stanols have no significant effects on LDL-C in substantial numbers of individuals. Higher responses, in absolute value and percentage of LDL-C, are observed in individuals with higher cholesterol absorption and a lower rate of cholesterol synthesis. Some data provide evidence of the influence of genetics on the response to plant sterols and stanols. Further studies in large populations are required to extend these conclusions about genetic influences.
Ezetimibe (EZE) selectively blocks intestinal cholesterol absorption by interacting with Niemann-Pick C1 Like 1 (NPC1L1). After administration, EZE is extensively metabolized in liver and intestine to its phenolic glucuronide form (EZE-G) by uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs), among which UGT1A1 and 1A3 exhibit highest activity. EZE-G is excreted into bile and undergoes extensive enterohepatic recirculation. Considering the pharmacokinetic properties of EZE and an in vitro binding study showing the high affinity binding of EZE-G to NPC1L1, glucuronidation by UGTs has been believed to be essential for the pharmacological efficacy of EZE. To study the role of glucuronidation by UGTs for the cholesterol-lowering effect of EZE, in vitro and in vivo studies were performed using Gunn rats, which hereditarily lack the expression of UGT1A enzymes. The biliary excreted amount of EZE-G was reduced by 73% up to 3 h after administration of EZE (0.3 mg/kg) in Gunn rats, which is consistent with the reduction of in vitro EZE glucuronidation activity found in liver and intestinal microsome from Gunn rats. These results indicate that the formation of EZE-G in Gunn rats is much lower than that in Wistar rats. However, in vivo study showed that 0.3 mg/kg EZE, which is the clinically relevant dose, reduced cholesterol absorption in both Wistar and Gunn rats to nearly the same degree and the dose dependence was not significantly different between Wistar and Gunn rats at the range 0.001 approximately 0.3 mg/kg. These results indicate that a deficiency of UGT1A activity does not necessarily alter the cholesterol-lowering effect of EZE in rats at therapeutic doses.
The recent discovery of transporters in the intestinal mucosa and the canalicular membrane has given new insights into the regulation of intestinal absorption as well as the biliary output of cholesterol and plant sterols. The 2 adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-binding cassette (ABC) half-transporters ABCG5 and ABCG8 are expressed in the mucosa cells and the canalicular membrane, and they resecrete sterols, especially absorbed plant sterols, back into the intestinal lumen and from the liver into bile. Defects of either of these cotransporters lead to the rare inherited disease of phytosterolemia, which is clinically defined by hyperabsorption and diminished biliary excretion of plant sterols. Furthermore, it has been recently demonstrated that the Niemann-Pick C1-Like 1 (NPC1L1) transporter is most likely responsible for the transport of cholesterol and plant sterols from the brush border membrane into the intestinal mucosa. Ezetimibe interferes with NPC1L1, reducing the intestinal uptake of cholesterol and plant sterols. These new findings contribute to our understanding of cholesterol and plant sterol concentrations in serum, and the effect of dietary and drug intervention to reduce serum concentrations of sterols.
Disposition of the lipid-lowering agent ezetimibe (EZ) and its glucuronide (GLUC), which is mainly formed by UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) 1A1, is influenced by the intestinal efflux transporters P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and multidrug resistance-associated protein (MRP) 2. To evaluate the role of Mrp2 in overall disposition and pharmacodynamic effects of EZ, wild-type and Mrp2-deficient (TR-negative) Lewis.1W rats (eight males each) fed with a cholesterol-enriched diet were orally treated with 5 mg/kg EZ for 14 days. EZ and GLUC in serum, urine, and feces, and cholesterol, campesterol, and sitosterol in serum, were assayed using liquid chromatography (LC)-tandem mass spectrometry and LC-mass spectrometry methods, respectively. Gene expression of Bsep (bile salt exporting pump), multidrug resistance (Mdr) 1a, Mdr1b, Mrp2, Mrp3, Ntcp (sodium taurocholate co-transporting polypeptide), organic anion transporting polypeptides (Oatp) 1, 2, 4, and Ugt1a1 was quantified in several tissues using real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Mrp2 deficiency resulted in lower serum levels and fecal excretion of EZ (1.4 +/- 0.4 versus 3.1 +/- 1.1 ng/ml; 115 +/- 48 versus 361 +/- 102 microg/day, both p &lt; 0.01), whereas serum concentrations of GLUC were manyfold increased compared with wild type (196 +/- 76 versus 23 +/- 25 ng/ml; p &lt; 0.01), associated with elevated renal excretion and decreased intestinal clearance (7.8 +/- 3.1 versus 0.4 +/- 0.4 microg/day, p &lt; 0.01; 0.3 +/- 0.3 versus 15 +/- 17 ml/min; p &lt; 0.05). The sterol-lowering effect of EZ was reduced in correlation to EZ serum levels (cholesterol: r = 0.449, p = 0.093; campesterol: r = 0.717, p = 0.003; sitosterol: r = 0.507, p = 0.054), whereas GLUC was inversely correlated (r = -0.743, p = 0.002; r =-0.768, p = 0.001; r =-0.634, p = 0.011). Disposition of EZ may have been additionally influenced by hepatic P-gp, Mrp3, and Ugt1a1, which were expressed significantly higher in Mrp2-deficient rats. Mrp2 deficiency in rats is associated with decreased sterol-lowering effect of ezetimibe, obviously caused by lower intestinal clearance of the glucuronide and decreased enterosystemic and enterohepatic recycling of the parent ezetimibe to the intestinal Niemann-Pick C 1-like 1 sterol-uptake compartment.
The involvement of lipid transporters, the scavenger receptor class B, type I (SR-BI) and Niemann-Pick type C1 Like 1 protein (NPC1L1) in carotenoid absorption is demonstrated in intestinal cells and animal models. Dietary ω-3 fatty acids are known to possess antilipidemic properties, which could be mediated by activation of PPAR family transcription factors. The present study was conducted to determine the effect of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), on intestinal β-carotene absorption. β-carotene uptake in Caco-2/TC7 cells was inhibited by EPA (p &lt; 0.01) and PPARα agonist (P &lt; 0.01), but not by DHA, PPARγ or PPARδ agonists. Despite unaltered β-carotene uptake, both DHA and PPARδ agonists inhibited the NPC1L1 expression. Further, EPA also induced the expression of carnitine palmitoyl transferase 1A (CPT1A) expression, a PPARα target gene. Interestingly, EPA induced inhibition of β-carotene uptake and SR B1 expression were abrogated by specific PPARα antagonist, but not by PPARδ antagonist. EPA and PPARα agonist also inhibited the basolateral secretion of β-carotene from Caco-2 cells grown on permeable supports. These results suggest that EPA inhibits intestinal β-carotene absorption by down regulation of SR B1 expression via PPARα dependent mechanism and provide an evidence for dietary modulation of intestinal β-carotene absorption. 
The transcription factor cyclic AMP-responsive element-binding protein H (CREBH, encoded by Creb3l3) is highly expressed in the liver and small intestine. Hepatic CREBH contributes to glucose and triglyceride metabolism by regulating fibroblast growth factor 21 (Fgf21) expression. However, the intestinal CREBH function remains unknown.
To investigate the influence of intestinal CREBH on cholesterol metabolism, we compared plasma, bile, fecal, and tissue cholesterol levels between wild-type (WT) mice and mice overexpressing active human CREBH mainly in the small intestine (CREBH Tg mice) under different dietary conditions.
Plasma cholesterol, hepatic lipid, and cholesterol crystal formation in the gallbladder were lower in CREBH Tg mice fed a lithogenic diet (LD) than in LD-fed WTs, while fecal cholesterol output was higher in the former. These results suggest that intestinal CREBH overexpression suppresses cholesterol absorption, leading to reduced plasma cholesterol, limited hepatic supply, and greater excretion. The expression of Niemann-Pick C1-like 1 (Npc1l1), a rate-limiting transporter mediating intestinal cholesterol absorption, was reduced in the small intestine of CREBH Tg mice. Adenosine triphosphate-binding cassette transporter A1 (Abca1), Abcg5/8, and scavenger receptor class B, member 1 (Srb1) expression levels were also reduced in CREBH Tg mice. Promoter assays revealed that CREBH directly regulates Npc1l1 expression. Conversely, CREBH null mice exhibited higher intestinal Npc1l1 expression, elevated plasma and hepatic cholesterol, and lower fecal output.
Intestinal CREBH regulates dietary cholesterol flow from the small intestine by controlling the expression of multiple intestinal transporters. We propose that intestinal CREBH could be a therapeutic target for hypercholesterolemia.
The survival rate of children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) has increased to approximately 90% after substantial progress in risk-oriented treatment strategies. Between 2005 and 2013, the Tokyo Children's Cancer Study Group (TCCSG) conducted a risk-oriented, non-randomized study, L04-16. The principal aim of this study was to assemble background characteristics and treatment outcomes, and gather genetic information on leukemic cells under central diagnosis. This report outlines the background characteristics and treatment outcomes of 1033 children with ALL treated according to a TCCSG platform. The 5-year event-free and overall survival (OS) rates for all children were 78.1 ± 1.3 and 89.6 ± 1.0%, respectively. The OS rate was significantly higher in children with B-cell precursor (BCP)-ALL (91.9 ± 1.0%, n = 916) than in those with T-ALL (71.9 ± 4.3%, n = 117, p &lt; 0.001). In univariate analysis for BCP-ALL, children aged 1-6 years (5y-OS: 94.2 ± 1.0%), with an initial white blood cell count of &lt; 20,000/μL (94.0 ± 1.0%), high hyperdiploidy (95.4 ± 1.6%), ETV6-RUNX1 (97.4 ± 1.2%) or TCF3-PBX1 (96.9 ± 2.1%), and "Day8NoBlasts" (96.4 ± 1.1%) had the best outcomes. Genetic investigation revealed two novel fusion genes within this cohort: ETV6-ZNF385A and ZNF362-TCF4. Our study highlighted the clinical aspects of genomic features of ALL in Japanese children. We provide fundamental information for the further molecular investigation of this disease.
Congenital heart disease (CHD)-structural abnormalities of the heart that arise during embryonic development-is the most common inborn malformation, affecting ≤1% of the population. However, currently, only a minority of cases can be explained by genetic abnormalities. The goal of this study was to identify disease-causal genetic variants in 30 families affected by CHD.
Whole-exome sequencing was performed with the DNA of multiple family members. We utilized a 2-tiered whole-exome variant screening and interpretation procedure. First, we manually curated a high-confidence list of 90 genes known to cause CHD in humans, identified predicted damaging variants in genes on this list, and rated their pathogenicity using American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics-Association for Molecular Pathology guidelines.
In 3 families (10%), we found pathogenic variants in known CHD genes TBX5, TFAP2B, and PTPN11, explaining the cardiac lesions. Second, exomes were comprehensively analyzed to identify additional predicted damaging variants that segregate with disease in CHD candidate genes. In 10 additional families (33%), likely disease-causal variants were uncovered in PBX1, CNOT1, ZFP36L2, TEK, USP34, UPF2, KDM5A, KMT2C, TIE1, TEAD2, and FLT4.
The pathogenesis of CHD could be explained using our high-confidence CHD gene list for variant filtering in a subset of cases. Furthermore, our unbiased screening procedure of family exomes implicates additional genes and variants in the pathogenesis of CHD, which suggest themselves for functional validation. This 2-tiered approach provides a means of (1) identifying clinically actionable variants and (2) identifying additional disease-causal genes, both of which are essential for improving the molecular diagnosis of CHD.
Self-renewal and differentiation of adult stem cells are tightly regulated partly through configuration of chromatin structure by chromatin remodelers. Using knockout mice, we here demonstrate that bromodomain PHD finger transcription factor (BPTF), a component of the nucleosome remodeling factor (NURF) chromatin-remodeling complex, is essential for maintaining the population size of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs), including long-term hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). Bptf-deficient HSCs are defective in reconstituted hematopoiesis, and hematopoietic-specific knockout of Bptf caused profound defects including bone marrow failure and anemia. Genome-wide transcriptome profiling revealed that BPTF loss caused downregulation of HSC-specific gene-expression programs, which contain several master transcription factors (Meis1, Pbx1, Mn1, and Lmo2) required for HSC maintenance and self-renewal. Furthermore, we show that BPTF potentiates the chromatin accessibility of key HSC "stemness" genes. These results demonstrate an essential requirement of the chromatin remodeler BPTF and NURF for activation of "stemness" gene-expression programs and proper function of adult HSCs.
PBX1 was abnormally overexpressed and its intracellular localization was found to be frequently amplified in many types of cancer, including renal clear cell carcinoma. PBX1 displays oncogenic activity in several different types of cells, but little is known about how signaling pathways are altered, and the function of PBX1 in renal clear cell carcinoma has not been well investigated. In this study, we demonstrate that the expression of PBX1 was significantly upregulated in 30 pairs of human tissues compared to adjacent normal tissues and the overall survival rate of PBX1-high group was significantly worse than that of PBX1-low group. Furthermore, JAK2 expression is significantly correlated to PBX1 expression in human clinical specimen and PBX1 knockdown inhibits STAT3 phosphorylation and reduced transcription of STAT3 target genes Cyclin D1. More interestingly, PBX1 knockdown inhibits ccRCC cell viability, proliferation and cell cycle progression in vivo and in vitro. Thus, our results demonstrate that PBX1 plays an oncogenic role in ccRCC via JAK2/STAT3 pathway and indicate its potential application for the treatment of human ccRCC in future.
Direct reprogramming of non-fibroblastic cells to the neuronal cell types including induced neurons (iNs) and induced neural stem cells (iNSCs) has provided an alternative approach for the direct reprogramming of fibroblasts to those cells. However, to increase the efficiency of the reprogramming process the underlying mechanisms should be clarified. In the current study, we analyzed the gene expression profiles of five different cellular conversions to understand the most significant molecular mechanisms and transcription factors (TFs) underlying each conversion. For each conversion, we found the list of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and the list of differentially expressed TFs (DE-TFs) which regulate expression of DEGs. Moreover, we constructed gene regulatory networks based on the TF-binding sites' data and found the most central regulators and the most active part of the networks. Furthermore, protein complexes were identified from constructed protein-protein interaction networks for DE-TFs. Finally, we proposed a list of main regulators for each conversion; for example, in the direct conversion of epithelial-like cells (ECs) to iNSCs, combination of centrality with active modules or protein complex analyses highlighted the role of POU3F2, BACH1, AR, PBX1, SOX2 and NANOG genes in this conversion. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first one that analyzed the direct conversion of non-fibroblastic cells toward iNs and iNSCs and we believe that the expression manipulation of identified genes may increase efficiency of these processes.
Adult neurogenesis is regulated by stem cell niche-derived extrinsic factors and cell-intrinsic regulators, yet the mechanisms by which niche signals impinge on the activity of intrinsic neurogenic transcription factors remain poorly defined. Here, we report that MEIS2, an essential regulator of adult SVZ neurogenesis, is subject to posttranslational regulation in the SVZ olfactory bulb neurogenic system. Nuclear accumulation of MEIS2 in adult SVZ-derived progenitor cells follows downregulation of EGFR signaling and is modulated by methylation of MEIS2 on a conserved arginine, which lies in close proximity to nested binding sites for the nuclear export receptor CRM1 and the MEIS dimerization partner PBX1. Methylation impairs interaction with CRM1 without affecting PBX1 dimerization and thereby allows MEIS2 nuclear accumulation, a prerequisite for neuronal differentiation. Our results describe a form of posttranscriptional modulation of adult SVZ neurogenesis whereby an extrinsic signal fine-tunes neurogenesis through posttranslational modification of a transcriptional regulator of cell fate.
The E2A-PBX1 rearrangement is common in B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL). However, whether this fusion gene can be used as a reliable marker for minimal residual disease (MRD) following allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) remains unknown. In this study, clinical data were collected from 28 consecutive B-ALL patients who received allo-HSCT. Their MRD was evaluated by E2A-PBX1 and leukemia-associated immunophenotype (LAIP). The median follow-up was 374 days (55-2342 days). Of the enrolled patients, seven (25%) patients died of leukemia relapse. A total of nine (32.1%) patients experienced relapse at a median of 164 days (75-559 days) after transplantation. The median expression level in the first positive sample was 0.14% (0.0071-902.4%). The duration from E2A-PBX1-positive results to hematological relapse was 74 days (30-469 days). E2A-PBX1 expression generally became positive prior to flow cytometry. Patients with positive E2A-PBX1 gene expression pre-transplantation were more likely to have positive E2A-PBX1 expression after transplantation. Taken all together, E2A-PBX1 expression determined by real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RQ-PCR) could be used to evaluate MRD status after allo-HSCT. Patients with positive E2A-PBX1 expression after transplant will have a poor prognosis.
Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is associated with significant morbidity and mortality, necessitating further improvements in diagnosis and therapy. Targeted therapies directed against chromatin regulators are emerging as promising approaches in preclinical studies and early clinical trials. Here, we demonstrate an oncogenic role for the protein lysine methyltransferase SETDB2 in leukemia pathogenesis. It is overexpressed in pre-BCR+ ALL and required for their maintenance in vitro and in vivo. SETDB2 expression is maintained as a direct target gene of the chimeric transcription factor E2A-PBX1 in a subset of ALL and suppresses expression of the cell-cycle inhibitor CDKN2C through histone H3K9 tri-methylation, thus establishing an oncogenic pathway subordinate to E2A-PBX1 that silences a major tumor suppressor in ALL. In contrast, SETDB2 was relatively dispensable for normal hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell proliferation. SETDB2 knockdown enhances sensitivity to kinase and chromatin inhibitors, providing a mechanistic rationale for targeting SETDB2 therapeutically in ALL.
Treatment for dyslipidemia in diabetes reduces cardiovascular events. Diabetes is associated with major abnormalities in fatty acid metabolism. The resulting disturbance results in an abnormal lipoprotein cascade from the large chylomicron through to the small HDL particle. This suggests that drugs that alter formation of the chylomicron particle might have a very important role in diabetic dyslipidemia. Achieving normal glycemia will reverse the abnormalities in fatty acid metabolism, but this is difficult, particularly as the disease progresses. Genes that regulate cholesterol absorption and excretion have been described (Niemann Pick C1-like 1 [NPC1-L1] and ATP binding cassette proteins [ABC] G5 and G8). An effective NPC1-L1 inhibitor (ezetimibe) improves the reduction in cholesterol caused by statins. Agonists of ABCG5 and G8 may become important in the treatment of dyslipidemia. Microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP) is responsible for the assembly of the chylomicron and VLDL particles. New MTP inhibitors, acting only on the intestine, are exciting possible treatments. The advisability of sitosterol-enriched foods to lower cholesterol may have to be reassessed for patients with diabetes, since these products may lead to an increase in chylomicron sitosterol in diabetic patients. More successful treatment of diabetic dyslipidemia is essential if we are to reduce the burden of cardiovascular disease so commonly found in diabetes.
The Niemann-Pick C1 Like 1 (NPC1L1) is a predicted polytopic membrane protein that is critical for cholesterol absorption. NPC1L1 takes up free cholesterol into cells through vesicular endocytosis. Ezetimibe, a clinically used cholesterol absorption inhibitor, blocks the endocytosis of NPC1L1 thereby inhibiting cholesterol uptake. Human NPC1L1 is a 1,332-amino acid protein with a putative sterol-sensing domain (SSD) that shows sequence homo-logy to HMG-CoA reductase (HMGCR), Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1), and SREBP cleavage-activating protein (SCAP). Here, we use protease protection and immunofluorescence in selectively permeabilized cells to study the topology of human NPC1L1. Our data indicate that NPC1L1 contains 13 transmembrane helices. The NH2-terminus of NPC1L1 is in the lumen while the COOH-terminus projects to the cytosol. human NPC1L1 contains seven small cytoplasmic loops--four small and three large luminal loops--one of which has been reported to bind ezetimibe. Ezetimibe-glucuronide, the major metabolite of ezetimibe in vivo, can block the internalization of NPC1L1 and cholesterol. The membrane topology of NPC1L1 is similar to that of NPC1, and the putative SSD of NPC1L1 is oriented in the same manner as those of HMGCR, NPC1, and SCAP. The defined topology of NPC1L1 provides necessary information for further dissecting the functions of the different domains of NPC1L1.
Niemann-Pick C1-like 1 (NPC1L1) is an intestinal cholesterol transporter and the molecular target of ezetimibe, a cholesterol absorption inhibitor demonstrated to reduce LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C) both as monotherapy and when co-administered with 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins). Interestingly, significant interindividual variability has been observed for rates of intestinal cholesterol absorption and LDL-C reductions at both baseline and post ezetimibe treatment. To test the hypothesis that genetic variation in NPC1L1 could influence the LDL-C response to ezetimibe, we performed extensive resequencing of the gene in 375 apparently healthy individuals and genotyped hypercholesterolemic patients from clinical trial cohorts. No association was observed between NPC1L1 single-nucleotide polymorphism and baseline cholesterol. However, significant associations to LDL-C response to treatment with ezetimibe were observed in patients treated with ezetimibe in two large clinical trials. Our data demonstrate that DNA sequence variants in NPC1L1 are associated with an improvement in response to ezetimibe pharmacotherapy and suggest that detailed analysis of genetic variability in clinical trial cohorts can lead to improved understanding of factors contributing to variable drug response.
Ezetimibe is a novel lipid-lowering agent that inhibits intestinal absorption of dietary and biliary cholesterol. The effects of ezetimibe on low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol were found to generally consistent across all subgroups analyzed, including baseline lipid profile, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and body mass index. Furthermore, recent clinical studies also revealed that co-administration of ezetimibe with on-going statins offered a well-tolerated and efficacious treatment to lower LDL-cholesterol levels in hypercholesterolemic patients with diabetes mellitus or the metabolic syndrome. Niemann-Pick C1 like 1 (NPC1L1) protein is recently found to be critical for intestinal cholesterol absorption, and is a target protein for ezetimibe. Human NPC1L1 protein is predominantly expressed in liver, whereas small intestine expression is only about 2-4% of that found in the liver. Thus, NPC1L1 does not function solely in the intestinal cholesterol absorption. Furthermore, loss of NPC1L1 expression has been shown to protect against diet-induced fatty liver. These observations let us to speculate that ezetimibe will become a new therapeutic approach for the treatment of non-alcoholic fatty liver, the hepatic manifestation of insulin resistant patients with the metabolic syndrome. In this paper, we would like to propose the possible ways of testing our hypothesis as follows. (1) Does ezetimibe treatment improve fatty liver in patients with hypercholesterolemia or the metabolic syndrome? If the answers are yes, are these beneficial effects of ezetimibe superior to those of other anti-hyperlipidemic resins with equihypolipidemic properties? (2) Does ezetimibe treatment improve insulin sensitivity in fatty liver patients with the metabolic syndrome? (3) How about the effects of ezetimibe treatment on serum levels of adiponectin, a key adipokine with insulin-sensitizing property? Large clinical trials will provide us with more definite information whether ezetimibe treatment can improve fatty liver and resultantly reduce the risk of progression of liver diseases in patients with the metabolic syndrome.
Administration of beta-sitosterol (42 mg/kg per day) for 3 weeks to 8-month-old male LXRbeta-/- mice resulted in the death of motor neurons in the lumbar region of the spinal cord and loss of tyrosine hydroxylase-positive dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. In mice at 5 months of age, beta-sitosterol had no observed toxicity but at 16 months of age, it caused severe paralysis and symptoms typical of dopaminergic dysfunction in LXRbeta-/- mice. WT mice were not affected by these doses of beta-sitosterol. In 5-month-old mice, levels of the intestinal transporters, ABCG5/8 and Niemann-Pick C1 Like 1, were not affected by loss of liver X receptor (LXR) beta and/or treatment with beta-sitosterol nor were there changes in plasma levels of cholesterol or beta-sitosterol. In 8-month-old LXRbeta-/- mice there was activation of microglia in the substantia nigra pars reticulata and aggregates of ubiquitin and TDP-43 in the cytoplasm of large motor neurons in the lumbar spinal cord. Brain cholesterol concentrations were higher in LXRbeta-/- than in their WT counterparts, and treatment with beta-sitosterol reduced brain cholesterol in both WT and LXRbeta-/- mice. In LXRbeta-/- mice but not in WT mice levels of 24-hydrocholesterol were increased upon beta-sitosterol treatment. These data indicate that multiple mechanisms are involved in the sensitivity of LXRbeta-/- mice to beta-sitosterol. These include activation of microglia, accumulation of protein aggregates in the cytoplasm of large motor neurons, and depletion of brain cholesterol.
Niemann-Pick C1-like 1 protein (NPC1L1), a transporter crucial in intestinal cholesterol absorption, is expressed in human liver but not in murine liver. To elucidate the role of hepatic NPC1L1 on lipid metabolism, we overexpressed NPC1L1 in murine liver utilizing adenovirus-mediated gene transfer. C57BL/6 mice, fed on normal chow with or without ezetimibe, were injected with NPC1L1 adenovirus (L1-mice) or control virus (Null-mice), and lipid analyses were performed five days after the injection. The plasma cholesterol levels increased in L1-mice, and FPLC analyses revealed increased cholesterol contents in large HDL lipoprotein fractions. These fractions, which showed α-mobility on agarose electrophoresis, were rich in apoE and free cholesterol. These lipoprotein changes were partially inhibited by ezetimibe treatment and were not observed in apoE-deficient mice. In addition, plasma and VLDL triglyceride (TG) levels decreased in L1-mice. The expression of microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP) was markedly decreased in L1-mice, accompanied by the reduced protein levels of forkhead box protein O1 (FoxO1). These changes were not observed in mice with increased hepatic de novo cholesterol synthesis. These data demonstrate that cholesterol absorbed through NPC1L1 plays a distinct role in cellular and plasma lipid metabolism, such as the appearance of apoE-rich lipoproteins and the diminished VLDL-TG secretion.
Niemann-Pick disease type C (NPC) is a rare, fatal neurovisceral disorder with autosomal recessive inheritance, and featuring striking clinical variability dependent on the age at onset of neurological symptoms. We report data from a large cohort of 56 Czech patients with NPC diagnosed over a period of 37 years.
An observational, retrospective analysis of historic and current clinical and laboratory information was performed among all NPC patients originating from the area of the contemporary Czech Republic and diagnosed between 1975 and 2012. All patients with ≥1 positive diagnostic test and relevant clinical information were included. Data on diagnostic methods (histopathological and/or ultrastructural; biochemical; genetic), clinical status and general information on treatment were collated. Data were examined in accordance with international guidelines for the management of NPC.
Between 1975 and 1985 diagnoses were based exclusively on specific histopathological findings, often at autopsy. Bone marrow smear (BMS) analyses have proved to be a very specific indicator for NPC and have become an important part of our diagnostic algorithm. Filipin staining and cholesterol esterification assays became the definitive diagnostic tests after 1985 and were applied in 24 of our patients. Since 2005, more and more patients have been assessed using NPC1/NPC2 gene sequencing. Twelve patients were diagnosed with neonatal/early-infantile onset NPC, 13 with the late-infantile onset form, 20 with the juvenile onset form, and nine with the adolescent/adult onset form. Two diagnosed patients remained neurologically asymptomatic at study completion. Nineteen patients were siblings. Causal NPC1 mutations were determined in 38 patients; two identical NPC2 mutations were identified in one patient. In total, 30 different mutations were identified, 14 of which have been confirmed as novel. The frequency of individual mutated NPC1 alleles in our cohort differs compared with previous published data: the most frequent mutant NPC1 allele was p.R1186H (n = 13), followed by p.P1007A (n = 8), p.S954L (n = 8) and p.I1061T (n = 4).
These data demonstrate the evolution of the diagnostic process in NPC over the last four decades. We estimate the contemporary birth prevalence of NPC in the Czech Republic at 0.93 per 100,000.
The yolk sac (YS) is an extra-embryonic tissue that surrounds the yolk and absorbs, digests and transports nutrients during incubation of the avian embryo as well as during early term mammalian embryonic development. Understanding YS functions and development may enhance the efficient transfer of nutrients and optimize embryo development. To identify temporal large-scale patterns of gene expression and gain insights into processes and mechanisms in the YS, we performed a transcriptome study of the YS of chick embryos on embryonic days (E) E13, E15, E17, E19, and E21 (hatch).
3547 genes exhibited a significantly changed expression across days. Clustering and functional annotation of these genes as well as histological sectioning of the YS revealed that we monitored two cell types: the epithelial cells and the erythropoietic cells of the YS. We observed a significant up-regulation of epithelial genes involved in lipid transport and metabolism between E13 and E19. YS epithelial cells expressed a vast array of lipoprotein receptors and fatty acid transporters. Several lysosomal genes (CTSA, PSAP, NPC2) and apolipoproteins genes (apoA1, A2, B, C3) were among the highest expressed, reflecting the intensive digestion and re-synthesis of lipoproteins in YS epithelial cells. Genes associated with cytoskeletal structure were down-regulated between E17 and E21 supporting histological evidence of a degradation of YS epithelial cells towards hatch. Expression patterns of hemoglobin synthesis genes indicated a high erythropoietic capacity of the YS between E13 and E15, which decreased towards hatch. YS histological sections confirmed these results. We also observed that YS epithelial cells expressed high levels of genes coding for plasma carrier proteins (ALB, AFP, LTF, TTR), normally produced by the liver.
Here we expand current knowledge on developmental, nutritional and molecular processes in the YS. We demonstrate that in the final week of chick embryonic development, the YS plays different roles to support or replace the functions of several organs that have not yet reached their full functional capacity. The YS has a similar functional role as the intestine in digestion and transport of nutrients, the liver in producing plasma carrier proteins and coagulation factors, and the bone marrow in synthesis of blood cells.
Single particle tracking (SPT) is becoming a standard method to extract transport parameters from time-lapse image sequences of fluorescent vesicles in living cells. Another method to obtain these data is temporal image correlation spectroscopy (TICS), but this method is less often used for measurement of intracellular vesicle transport. Here, we present an extensive comparison of SPT and TICS. First we examine the effect of photobleaching, shading and noise on SPT and TICS analysis using simulated image sequences. To this end, we developed a simple photophysical model, which relates spatially varying illumination intensity to the bleaching propensity and fluorescence intensity of the moving particles. We found that neither SPT nor TICS are affected by photobleaching per se, but the transport parameters obtained by both methods are sensitive to the signal-to-noise ratio. In addition, the number of obtained trajectories in SPT is affected by noise. Diffusion constants determined by TICS are significantly overestimated when large immobile fluorescent structures are present in the image sequences, while the opposite is true for SPT. To improve the performance of both techniques, we compare three different methods for image denoising. Appropriate denoising significantly reduced the effect of noise and of immobile structures on both methods. Shape fluctuations of simulated particles had a more pronounced effect on TICS than on SPT analysis. In denoised images of fluorescent beads or cytosolic vesicles containing fluorescent protein NPC2 in human skin fibroblast cells, the transport parameters acquired by SPT and TICS were comparable emphasizing the value of both analysis methods. 
Niemann-Pick type C disease (NPC) is a devastating, recessive, inherited disorder that causes accumulation of cholesterol and other lipids in late endosomes and lysosomes. Mutations in 2 genes, NPC1 and NPC2, are responsible for the disease, which affects about 1 in 120,000 live births. About 95% of patients have mutations in NPC1, a large polytopic membrane protein that is normally found in late endosomes. More than 200 missense mutations in NPC1 have been found in NPC patients. The disease is progressive, typically leading to death before the age of 20 years, although some affected individuals live well into adulthood. The disease affects peripheral organs, including the liver, spleen, and lungs, but the most severe symptoms are associated with neurological disease. There are some palliative treatments that slow progression of NPC disease. Recently, it was found that histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors that are effective against HDACs 1, 2, and 3 can reduce the cholesterol accumulation in fibroblasts derived from NPC patients with mutations in NPC1. One example is vorinostat. As vorinostat is a Food and Drug Administration-approved drug for treatment of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, this opens up the possibility that HDAC inhibitors could be repurposed for treatment of this rare disease. The mechanism of action of the HDAC inhibitors requires further study, but these drugs increase the level of the NPC1 protein. This may be due to post-translational stabilization of the NPC1 protein, allowing it to be transported out of the endoplasmic reticulum.
Ants are eusocial insects that are found in most regions of the world. Within its caste, worker ants are responsible for various tasks that are required for colony maintenance. In their chemical communication, α-helical carrier proteins, odorant-binding proteins, and chemosensory proteins, which accumulate in the sensillum lymph in the antennae, play essential roles in transferring hydrophobic semiochemicals to chemosensory receptors. It has been hypothesized that semiochemicals are recognized by α-helical carrier proteins. The number of these proteins, however, is not sufficient to interact with a large number of semiochemicals estimated from chemosensory receptor genes. Here we shed light on this conundrum by identifying a Niemann-Pick type C2 (NPC2) protein from the antenna of the worker Japanese carpenter ant, Camponotus japonicus (CjapNPC2). CjapNPC2 accumulated in the sensillum cavity in the basiconic sensillum. The ligand-binding pocket of CjapNPC2 was composed of a flexible β-structure that allowed it to bind to a wide range of potential semiochemicals. Some of the semiochemicals elicited electrophysiolgical responses in the worker antenna. In vertebrates, NPC2 acts as an essential carrier protein for cholesterol from late endosomes and lysosomes to other cellular organelles. However, the ants have evolved an NPC2 with a malleable ligand-binding pocket as a moderately selective carrier protein in the sensillum cavity of the basiconic sensillum. CjapNPC2 might be able to deliver various hydrophobic semiochemicals to chemosensory receptor neurons and plays crucial roles in chemical communication required to perform the worker ant tasks. 
With the wide adoption of transcriptome sequencing an ever increasing amount of information is becoming available, together with spurious data originating from contamination. We show that sometimes errors and inaccuracy can turn beneficial, revealing insect and arthropod pests when analysing plant transcriptomes. We have found a large number of soluble olfactory proteins, odorant-binding proteins (OBPs) and chemosensory proteins (CSPs), in plant databases, likely due to contamination by guest insects. In fact, both classes of proteins are only expressed in insects, with few CSPs also present in other arthropods. In addition, we found many sequences of the Niemann-Pick (Npc2) family, proteins dedicated to cholesterol transport in vertebrates and hypothesised to be involved in chemical communication in insects, but absent in plants. In several cases we were able to trace down members of the three classes of proteins to the insect or arthopod species responsible for contamination. Our work suggests that genes found in plants and recognised as contaminants can be turned into useful information to investigate plant-insect relationships or to identify new sequences from insects species not yet investigated.
Niemann-Pick disease type C (NPC) is a recessive, neurodegenerative, lysosomal storage disease caused by mutations in either NPC1 or NPC2. The diagnosis is difficult and frequently delayed. Ascertainment is likely incomplete because of both these factors and because the full phenotypic spectrum may not have been fully delineated. Given the recent development of a blood-based diagnostic test and the development of potential therapies, understanding the incidence of NPC and defining at-risk patient populations are important.
We evaluated data from four large, massively parallel exome sequencing data sets. Variant sequences were identified and classified as pathogenic or nonpathogenic based on a combination of literature review and bioinformatic analysis. This methodology provided an unbiased approach to determining the allele frequency.
Our data suggest an incidence rate for NPC1 and NPC2 of 1/92,104 and 1/2,858,998, respectively. Evaluation of common NPC1 variants, however, suggests that there may be a late-onset NPC1 phenotype with a markedly higher incidence, on the order of 1/19,000-1/36,000.
We determined a combined incidence of classical NPC of 1/89,229, or 1.12 affected patients per 100,000 conceptions, but predict incomplete ascertainment of a late-onset phenotype of NPC1. This finding strongly supports the need for increased screening of potential patients.
In arthropods, the large majority of studies on olfaction have been focused on insects, where most of the proteins involved have been identified. In particular, chemosensing in insects relies on two families of membrane receptors, olfactory/gustatory receptors (ORs/GRs) and ionotropic receptors (IRs), and two classes of soluble proteins, odorant-binding proteins (OBPs) and chemosensory proteins (CSPs). In other arthropods, such as ticks and mites, only IRs have been identified, while genes encoding for OBPs and CSPs are absent. A third class of soluble proteins, called Niemann-Pick C2 (NPC2) has been suggested as potential carrier for semiochemicals both in insects and other arthropods. Here we report the results of a proteomic analysis on olfactory organs (Haller's organ and palps) and control tissues of the tick Ixodes ricinus, and of immunostaining experiments targeting NPC2s. Adopting different extraction and proteomic approaches, we identified a large number of proteins, and highlighted those differentially expressed. None of the 13 NPC2s known for this species was found. On the other hand, using immunocytochemistry, we detected reaction against one NPC2 in the Haller's organ and palp sensilla. We hypothesized that the low concentration of such proteins in the tick's tissues could possibly explain the discrepant results. In ligand-binding assays the corresponding recombinant NPC2 showed good affinity to the fluorescent probe N-phenylnaphthylamine and to few organic compounds, supporting a putative role of NPC2s as odorant carriers.
Niemann-Pick type C1 (NPC1) disease is caused by defects in the NPC1 protein, which result in perturbation of subcellular cholesterol transport. To identify related proteins that may be involved in subcellular cholesterol trafficking, the expressed sequence tag (EST) database was searched to find homologues of human NPC1. A short, weakly similar EST was identified and used to obtain a full-length human cDNA of about 5 kb and two alternatively spliced transcripts. The gene, named NPC1L1, was mapped to chromosome 7p13, contained 20 exons, including an unusually large 1526-bp exon 2, and spanned approximately 29 kb. In contrast to NPC1, the NPC1L1 putative promoter region contained a sterol-regulatory element. The predicted protein shared 42% identity and 51% similarity with NPC1. Interestingly, NPC1L1 contains the conserved amino-terminal "NPC1 domain" and the putative sterol-sensing domain, providing strong evidence that it is related to human NPC1 and suggesting that these may comprise a new family of NPC1-related proteins. However, the two differ with respect to their putative intracellular targeting signals. Collectively, these data suggest that NPC1L1 and NPC1 form part of a family of related proteins that may have similar functions at different subcellular locations, perhaps at sequential steps of the same cholesterol transport pathway.
Niemann-Pick C disease (NPC) is a neuro-visceral lysosomal storage disorder mainly caused by genetic defects in the NPC1 gene. As a result of loss of NPC1 function large quantities of free cholesterol and other lipids accumulate within late endosomes and lysosomes. In NPC livers and brains, the buildup of lipids correlates with oxidative damage; however the molecular mechanisms that trigger it remain unknown. Here we study potential alterations in vitamin E (α-tocopherol, α-TOH), the most potent endogenous antioxidant, in liver tissue and neurons from NPC1 mice. We found increased levels of α-TOH in NPC cells. We observed accumulation and entrapment of α-TOH in NPC neurons, mainly in the late endocytic pathway. Accordingly, α-TOH levels were increased in cerebellum of NPC1 mice. Also, we found decreased mRNA levels of the α-TOH transporter, α-Tocopherol Transfer Protein (α-TTP), in the cerebellum of NPC1 mice. Finally, by subcellular fractionation studies we detected a significant increase in the hepatic α-TOH content in purified lysosomes from NPC1 mice. In conclusion, these results suggest that NPC cells cannot transport vitamin E correctly leading to α-TOH buildup in the endosomal/lysosomal system. This may result in a decreased bioavailability and impaired antioxidant function of vitamin E in NPC, contributing to the disease pathogenesis.
A 20-kDa glycoprotein, EPV20, was isolated from bovine milk and characterized. The primary structure was determined by cDNA and protein sequencing combined with mass spectrometry. EPV20 is a 130-residue polypeptide synthesized with a 19-residue signal peptide. The function of EPV20 is unknown, but it displays 79% sequence similarity to a putative protein deduced from a human testis cDNA sequence designated HE1 (human epididymis clone 1) (Kirchhoff, C., 1992. EMBL/GeneBank/DDBJ Databases, accession number X67698). Northern blot analysis showed the bovine EPV20 to be expressed in kidney, spleen, liver and mammary gland, but remarkably not in bovine testis. The six Cys residues of EPV20 were found to be disulfide-linked in a 1-6, 2-3 and 4 5 pattern. This disulfide arrangement has been observed in other proteins, e.g. in human prostatic acid phosphatase, but the spacing between the cystines differs. Therefore, EPV20 represents a new structure among the large group of proteins containing domains with three disulfide bonds.
The physiology of the epididymis is an integral part of the maturation process by which human spermatozoa acquire the ability to reach and fertilize an oocyte. Because of the high degree of species specificity exhibited by the epididymal proteins involved in sperm maturation, we have assessed tissue from several alternative species for their suitability as a model for human epididymal physiology. Of these, the dog appears to offer an appropriate system. Northern hybridization using cDNA probes specific for human epididymal genes established that, irrespective of dog breed, the canine equivalents of the epididymis-specific HE1, HE4 and HE5 mRNAs were expressed highly in the canine epididymis. cDNA cloning and sequencing confirmed that the canine gene products, CE1, CE4 and CE5 were indeed true structural homologues of their human counterparts. Finally, tissue culture conditions were established wherein all three specific canine genes remained up-regulated after 5 days of culture. Thus, the prerequisite criteria for the development of a system which models human epididymal physiology are to a large degree fulfilled by this canine culture system.
Events related to both ecdysis and metamorphosis require the expression of a new set of genes, the majority of which are regulated by the changes in ecdysteroid levels. We have initiated studies to identify genes whose expression is up-regulated between 24 and 4 h before pupal ecdysis in Manduca sexta. In this paper we report the partial characterization of one such gene, esr16. The transcript of esr16 is detected by Northern blot analysis in nervous tissue, muscle and trachea isolated from animals 4 h before, but not 24 h before pupal ecdysis. In situ hybridization showed that the transcript was expressed in epithelial cells of the large tracheae surrounding the nervous system and muscle. Sequence analysis suggested that the gene encoded a secreted protein with 35% identity to HE1, a human epididymal-specific gene.
Niemann-Pick disease type C (NP-C) is an inherited disorder that is characterized biochemically by cellular cholesterol and glycolipid storage, and clinically by progressive neurodegeneration. Most cases of NP-C are caused by inactivating mutations of the npc1 gene, but about 5% are linked to npc2, which encodes a soluble cholesterol binding protein, previously identified as epididymal secretory glycoprotein 1 (HE1). The present study was carried out to investigate the immunocytochemical localization of HE1/NPC2 protein in the mouse brain. Using an antibody against recombinant HE1/NPC2, we found HE1/NPC2 to be localized predominantly in neurons in the brain. Immunoreactivity for HE1/NPC2 was observed in pyramidal or projection neurons in the cerebral cortex and amygdala, and Purkinje neurons in the cerebellum. Neurons in the thalamus, hypothalamus, and globus pallidus were lightly labeled, or unlabeled. This regional pattern of expression of HE1/NPC2 is similar to our previous findings with NPC1, with a low level of expression of both NPC1 and HE1/NPC2 proteins in regions derived from the diencephalon, such as the thalamus and hypothalamus. In contrast to NPC1, however, which is predominantly in astrocytes, HE1/NPC2 was observed mainly in neurons. Electron microscopic immunocytochemistry showed that HE1/NPC2 is present in the cytosol of dendrites and on post-synaptic densities (PSD). The occurrence of HE1/NPC2 in the PSD was confirmed by Western blots of PSD-enriched brain subcellular fractions that showed the presence of HE1/NPC2 together with the PSD-associated protein, PSD-95. These results suggest that NPC1 and HE1/NPC2 are differentially enriched in astrocytes and neurons, respectively, and that HE1/NPC2 may function in supporting the integrity of the PSD of neurons.
Primary cultures of the differentiated, adult epididymal duct epithelium were immortalized by retroviral transduction with the simian virus (SV)40 large T antigen. The canine epididymis was chosen here as a model with high human relevance, representing a convenient and acceptable source of differentiated epididymal tissue and, compared to other animal models, expressing a relatively large number of gene products which are also expressed by the human epididymis. To determine whether the immortalized canine epididymal (IMCE) cells retained a phenotype comparable to the original tissue, epithelial cytokeratins, various epididymal transcription factors as well as mRNAs encoding abundant epididymal secretory proteins, were studied as molecular markers. All IMCE populations obtained after transduction were of epithelial origin. The nuclear androgen receptor (AR) and the polyoma enhancer activator (PEA3), as well as the epididymal mRNA encoding the canine counterparts of human HE1, HE4 and HE5/CD52 epididymal mRNA, were retained in all populations tested. The majority of tested clones were oestrogen receptor ERalpha-positive, but ERbeta-negative, while one ERalpha-negative cell population was positive for ERbeta. The IMCE populations described thus represent useful permanent tools for studying gene expression of the epididymal duct epithelium, and for other types of experiments, examples including drug effects and toxicity on the epididymis.
The lipoproteins derived from cholesterol are the key to understanding atherogenesis. The main source of lipids for macrophages presented in the subendothelial space are lipoproteins undergoing oxidative modification or aggregation. Lipoproteins internalized in macrophages via endocytosis or phagocytosis are delivered to peripheral endosomes or lysosomes, where they are hydrolyzed. Large amounts of cholesteryl esters bound to cytoplasmic membranes are permanently affected by neutral hydrolase and repeated re-esterification by ACAT. Liberated free cholesterol is provided to the plasma membrane and other intracellulare structures, probably by vesicular transport. This transport is probably partially mediated by npc1 and npc2 (HE1) proteins, as well as lysobiphosphatidic acid. If some cholesterol acceptors, for example HDL particles, are available, some of the cholesterol can leave the cell, enter the circulation, and be transported to the liver in a process of reverse cholesterol transport. Modification of the lipid droplets fluidity by lipid composition is an important factor in susceptibility to this cholesterol efflux. The free cholesterol, especially crystalline, induces apoptosis. Finally, foam cells die and cellular cholesterol esters and free cholesterol are released into the lesion. This represents lipid or necrotic core formation in advanced atheromata. In this paper the role of oxysterols, triglycerides, fatty acids, and phospholips in atherogenesis are also described.
The present study describes the seminal plasma proteome of Bos indicus bulls. Fifty-six, 24-month old Australian Brahman sires were evaluated and subjected to electroejaculation. Seminal plasma proteins were separated by 2-D SDS-PAGE and identified by mass spectrometry. The percentage of progressively motile and morphologically normal sperm of the bulls were 70.4 ± 2.3 and 64 ± 3.2%, respectively. A total of 108 spots were identified in the 2-D maps, corresponding to 46 proteins. Binder of sperm proteins accounted for 55.8% of all spots detected in the maps and spermadhesins comprised the second most abundant constituents. Other proteins of the Bos indicus seminal plasma include clusterin, albumin, transferrin, metalloproteinase inhibitor 2, osteopontin, epididymal secretory protein E1, apolipoprotein A-1, heat shock 70 kDa protein, glutathione peroxidase 3, cathelicidins, alpha-enolase, tripeptidyl-peptidase 1, zinc-alpha-2-glycoprotein, plasma serine protease inhibitor, beta 2-microglobulin, proteasome subunit beta type-4, actin, cathepsins, nucleobinding-1, protein S100-A9, hemoglobin subunit alpha, cadherin-1, angiogenin-1, fibrinogen alpha and beta chain, ephirin-A1, protein DJ-1, serpin A3-7, alpha-2-macroglobulin, annexin A1, complement factor B, polymeric immunoglobulin receptor, seminal ribonuclease, ribonuclease-4, prostaglandin-H2 d-isomerase, platelet-activating factor acetylhydrolase, and phosphoglycerate kinase 1. In conclusion, this work uniquely portrays the Bos indicus seminal fluid proteome, based on samples from a large set of animals representing the Brahman cattle of the tropical Northern Australia. Based on putative biochemical attributes, seminal proteins act during sperm maturation, protection, capacitation and fertilization.
A novel electrochemical immunoassay system for the detection of human epididymis-specific protein 4 (HE4) was developed. A chitosan-titanium carbide (TiC) nanocomposition film was first electrodeposited onto a tin-doped indium oxide (ITO) electrode at a constant potential. Gold (Au) nanoparticles were then electrodeposited on the surface of the chitosan-TiC film by cyclic voltammetry (CV). The capture antibody (anti-HE4) was adsorbed onto the Au and TiC nanoparticles. After a specific sandwich immunoreaction among the capture antibody, HE4, and biotinylated secondary antibody, biotinylated primer DNA was immobilized on the secondary antibody by biotin-streptavidin system. Appropriate amounts of circular template DNA and biotinylated primer DNA were used for rolling circle amplification (RCA) under optimal conditions. The RCA products provided a large number of sites to link DNA detection probes. Doxorubicin hydrochloride intercalated the CG-GC steps between the RCA products and the DNA detection probes, which was monitored by differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) based on the current signal of doxorubicin hydrochloride. With the above-mentioned amplification factors, the current responded to HE4 linearly in the concentration range of 3-300 pM under optimal detection conditions, with a detection limit of 0.06 pM. Stepwise changes in the microscopic features of the surfaces and electrochemical properties upon the formation of each layer were confirmed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). This system was successfully employed for the detection of HE4 with good accuracy and renewable ability.
Human Epididymis-specific protein 6 [HE6 (GPR64)] is a highly conserved, tissue-specific seven-transmembrane receptor of the human epididymis. The rodent counterparts were cloned and 5'-inverse PCR employed to confirm that the cDNA sequences were full length. Downstream from the highly conserved signal peptide-coding sequence, the 5'-regions contained at least six mini-exons of less than 50 nucleotides. Multiple splice variants involving these mini-exons were cloned in the human, the majority of which was also found in rodents. Northern blot analysis showed that the tissue distribution of the mRNA was very similar in human and rodents. The human HE6 gene was assigned to the X chromosome in a region, which is syntenic to the mouse. The HE6 sequence predicted a two-subunit receptor of the LNB-TM7 subfamily. A membrane preparation and protein solubilization method was adopted to identify the endogenous epididymal proteins. Two sets of peptides were chosen for antibody production, assuming that protein scission had occurred within the conserved GPS-motif. Western blot analysis revealed abundant two-subunit proteins in human and rodents, comprising an approximately 180 kDa hydrophilic ectosubunit and a &lt;40 kDa hydrophobic endosubunit. Deglycosylation experiments showed that the large ectosubunits were highly glycosylated, the carbohydrate side chains dramatically increasing the apparent molecular mass. Immunohistochemical studies revealed that both subunits were associated with apical membranes of efferent ductule and proximal epididymal duct epithelia.
TEX101 is a cell membrane protein exclusively expressed by testicular germ cells and shed into seminal plasma. We previously verified human TEX101 as a biomarker for the differential diagnosis of azoospermia, and developed a first-of-its-kind TEX101 ELISA. To demonstrate the clinical utility of TEX101, in this work we aimed at evaluating ELISA performance in a large population of fertile, subfertile, and infertile men.
Mass spectrometry, size-exclusion chromatography, ultracentrifugation, and immunohistochemistry were used to characterize TEX101 protein as an analyte in seminal plasma. Using the optimized protocol for seminal plasma pretreatment, TEX101 was measured by ELISA in 805 seminal plasma samples.
We demonstrated that TEX101 was present in seminal plasma mostly in a free soluble form and that its small fraction was associated with seminal microvesicles. TEX101 median values were estimated in healthy, fertile pre-vasectomy men (5436 ng/mL, N = 64) and in patients with unexplained infertility (4967 ng/mL, N = 277), oligospermia (450 ng/mL, N = 270), and azoospermia (0.5 ng/mL, N = 137). Fertile post-vasectomy men (N = 57) and patients with Sertoli cell-only syndrome (N = 13) and obstructive azoospermia (N = 36) had undetectable levels of TEX101 (≤0.5 ng/mL). A cut-off value of 0.9 ng/mL provided 100% sensitivity at 100% specificity for distinguishing pre- and post-vasectomy men. The combination of a concentration of TEX101 &gt; 0.9 ng/mL and epididymis-specific protein ECM1 &gt; 2.3 μg/mL provided 81% sensitivity at 100% specificity for differentiating between non-obstructive and obstructive azoospermia, thus eliminating the majority of diagnostic testicular biopsies. In addition, a cut-off value of ≥0.6 ng/mL provided 73% sensitivity at 64% specificity for predicting sperm or spermatid retrieval in patients with non-obstructive azoospermia.
We demonstrated the clinical utility of TEX101 ELISA as a test to evaluate vasectomy success, to stratify azoospermia forms, and to better select patients for sperm retrieval.
Niemann-Pick diseases are hereditary neurovisceral lysosomal lipid storage disorders, of which the rare type C2 almost uniformly presents with respiratory distress in early infancy. In the patient presented here, the NPC2 exon 4 frameshift mutation c.408_409delAA caused reduced NPC2 protein levels in serum and lung lavage fluid and the synthesis of an aberrant, larger sized protein of around 28 kDa. Protein expression was strongly reduced also in alveolar macrophages. The infant developed failure to thrive and tachypnea. Lung lavage, computer tomography, and histology showed typical signs of pulmonary alveolar proteinosis with an abnormal intraalveolar accumulation of surfactant as well as macrophages. An NPC2-hypomorph animal model also showed pulmonary alveolar proteinosis and accumulation of macrophages in the lung, liver, and spleen long before the mice died. Due to the elevation of cholesterol, the surfactant had an abnormal composition and function. Despite the removal of large amounts of surfactant from the lungs by therapeutic lung lavages, this treatment was only temporarily successful and the infant died of respiratory failure. Our data indicate that respiratory distress in NPC2 disease is associated with a loss of normal NPC2 protein expression in alveolar macrophages and the accumulation of functionally inactive surfactant rich in cholesterol.
Complete lecithin cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) deficiency is a rare genetic cause of extreme reduction in high density lipoproteins and there is a high prevalence of chronic renal dysfunction that may progress to renal failure. Previous in vitro studies suggest the vesicular lipoprotein X (LpX) particles commonly seen in LCAT-deficient plasmas may be causative. To test this hypothesis, we have generated a novel murine model that selectively accumulate LpX in the circulation by cross breeding the sterol regulatory element binding protein (SREBP) 1a transgenic mice (S+) with the LCAT knockout (lcat-/-) mice. Fast protein liquid chromatography fractionation of pooled plasma lipids revealed that virtually all cholesterol is concentrated in the very low density lipoprotein (VLDL)-sized fractions. These fractions are enriched in free cholesterol and phospholipid but extremely poor in triglyceride. Electron microscopy of the d &lt;1.063 g/ml fraction of the S+lcat-/- mice revealed abnormal large vesicular particles, suggestive of LpX. The S+lcat-/- mice developed glomerular lesions spontaneously evident at 6 months with glomerular and tubulointerstitial lipid-deposits. Immunohistochemical staining with RhoA showed marked positive focal staining in glomeruli in the S+lcat-/- mice and undetectable in the S+/lcat+/+ control. By 10 months of age, the kidneys showed progressive glomerular injury including segmental foam cell infiltrates, mesangial expansion, and hyalinosis. Renal abnormalities are very similar to those seen in human LCAT deficiency. We conclude that the selective high-level accumulation of plasma LpX in the S+lcat-/- mice is strongly associated with a spontaneous glomerulopathy, providing in vivo evidence that LpX contributes to the LCAT deficiency-related nephropathy.
The chemical composition of the major classes of lipids were evaluated in the plasma and in various other tissues of a 68-year-old woman with a syringomyelia-like syndrome affecting cranial, cervical and brachial regions. No tonsillar abnormalities were apparent on visual examination of the oropharynx but the absence of alpha-lipoproteins on serum lipoprotein electrophoresis prompted the tentative diagnosis of Tangier disease. The diagnosis was confirmed by lipid, lipoprotein and apolipoprotein analyses of the plasma. The plasma cholesterol was low (93-113 mg/dl) and the triglyceride concentration normal (133-160 mg/dl). The very low density lipoproteins had normal chemical composition and morphology, but migrated with beta rather than pre-beta mobility on paper electrophoresis. Low density lipoproteins were deficient in cholesteryl esters and enriched in triglycerides; their electrophoretic mobility and morphology were normal. A small amount of high density lipoprotein (approximately 1.4 mg/dl) was recovered from the plasma. This contained few particles of the size of normal high density lipoprotein and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the lipid-free protein demonstrated a disproportionate increase in the A-II apolipoprotein. All of these abnormalities are consistent with Tangier disease. The serum concentration of glycosphingolipids was approximately 40% lower than normal, with the most marked reductions in the glucosylceramide (GL-1a) and trihexosylceramide (GL-3a) fractions. The relative quantity of long chain fatty acids (23 or more carbons) in serum sphingomyelin was reduced about 38% of that in control sera. Serum lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase (EC 2.3.1.43; LCAT) activity was 25% of normal and the reduced activity was shown not to be related to a change of enzyme specificity or to a lack of appropriate substrate. These findings are likely related to the HDL deficiency which characterizes Tangier disease. A biopsy sample of apparently normal tonsil contained three to four times the normal amount of cholesterol, and the increase was due entirely to abnormal quantities of cholesteryl esters. Of great interest was the chemical documentation of increased cholesteryl esters in a nerve biopsy specimen. These findings indicate that the neurologic as well as the reticuloendothelial manifestations of Tangier disease may be related to cholesteryl ester accumulation. Lipoprotein profiles, their triglyceride and cholesterol concentration, and LCAT activity were obtained on the plasma of 7 closely related members of the kinship. None of these relatives were found to have the biochemical derangement of Tangier disease.
We have previously observed low levels of high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol in active sarcoidosis. The aim of this study was to analyze the role of serum amyloid A (SAA) on this lipid disorder.
Eighty five untreated sarcoid patients, 40 with active disease and 45 with inactive disease, were recruited. Sarcoidosis activity was evaluated by means of clinical, chest X-ray, gallium-67 scan, serum angiotensin converting enzyme (peptidyl-dipeptidase A) values, and pulmonary function tests. Analysis of lipoprotein metabolism included: serum cholesterol, low density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, HDL(2)-cholesterol, HDL(3)-cholesterol, apolipoprotein A-I (apo A-I), apolipoprotein B (apo B), and triglyceride concentrations. Serum amyloid A protein and lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) activity were measured.
In active sarcoidosis we found significantly reduced levels of HDL-cholesterol (1.17+/-0.36 vs. 1. 44+/-0.39 mmol/l, P=0.002), HDL(3)-cholesterol (0.78+/-0.23 vs. 1. 02+/-0.21 mmol/l, P&lt;0.0001), and apo A-I (1.36+/-0.29 vs. 1.61+/-0. 27 g/l, P&lt;0.0001) and significantly increased levels of triglyceride (1.51+/-0.64 vs. 1.03+/-0.46 mmol/l, P&lt;0.0001), and apo B (1.14+/-0. 25 vs. 0.99+/-0.27 g/l, P=0.012) versus inactive sarcoidosis. Serum amyloid A concentrations were significantly increased in the patients with active disease (155.45+/-154.01 mg/ml) compared to the inactive sarcoid patients (89.70+/-65.36 mg/ml) (P=0.011). There were no significant differences in cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, HDL(2)-cholesterol or LCAT values between groups. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that HDL-cholesterol (regression coefficient b=-1.96; S.E.=0.87; P=0.02) and SAA (regression coefficient b=0.01; S.E.=0.004; P=0.01) were the two variables independently associated with disease activity. Moreover, a significant negative correlation was observed between SAA levels and both HDL-cholesterol (r=-0.39; P=0.01) and apo A-I (r=-0.35; P=0.03) levels, in the active sarcoid group. Conversely, no correlation was found in the inactive sarcoid group.
The low HDL-cholesterol and apo A-I concentrations seen in active sarcoid patients are associated with a significant increase of SAA levels. We suggest that the displacement of apo A-I by SAA on HDL accounts for the lower level of HDL-cholesterol seen in active sarcoidosis.
Myricetin is a natural flavonoid used in various health management systems. In this present study myricetin tested to evaluate the effect on lipids and lipid metabolism enzymes in normal and streptozotocin (STZ) with cadmium (Cd) induced diabetic nephrotoxic rats. Diabetic nephrotoxic rats were significantly (P&lt;0.05) increased the levels of urinary albumin and lipid profiles: total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TGs), free fatty acids (FFAs), phospholipids (PLs), low density lipoprotein (LDL), very low-density lipoproteins (VLDL), and decreased in the levels of high-density lipoproteins (HDL). In addition, the activity of lipoprotein lipase (LPL) and lecithin cholesterol acyl transferase (LCAT) were decreased significantly, whereas the 3-hydroxy 3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HmgCoA) reductase activity was increased. The upregulation of sterol regulatory element binding protein-1a (SREBP-1a), SREBP-1c, SREBP-2, transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and downregulation peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPAR-α) proteins expression levels were noticed. An administration of myricetin (1.0 mg/kg body weight (b/w)) for 12 weeks was brought the above parameters towards normal level. Histopathological study of kidney samples showed that extracellular mesangial matrix expansion, glomerulosclerosis and interstitial fibrosis in diabetic nephrotoxic rats was suppressed by myricetin treatment. Further our results indicate that administration of myricetin afforded remarkable protection against STZ-Cd induced alterations in lipid metabolism and thereby reduced the diabetic nephropathy in experimental rats. 
Hepatic cholesterol accumulation and autophagy defects contribute to hepatocyte injury in fatty liver disease. Bile acid synthesis is a major pathway for cholesterol catabolism in the liver. This study aims to understand the molecular link between cholesterol and bile acid metabolism and hepatic autophagy activity.
The effects of cholesterol and cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase (CYP7A1) expression on autophagy and lysosome function were studied in cell models. The effects and mechanism of disrupting enterohepatic bile acid circulation on hepatic autophagy were studied in mice.
The results first showed differential regulation of hepatic autophagy by free cholesterol and cholesterol ester, whereby a modest increase of cellular free cholesterol, but not cholesterol ester, impaired lysosome function and caused marked autolysosome accumulation. We found that CYP7A1 induction, either by cholestyramine feeding in mice or adenovirus-mediated CYP7A1 expression in hepatocytes, caused strong autophagy induction. Mechanistically, we showed that CYP7A1 expression markedly attenuated growth factor/AKT signaling activation of mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR), but not amino acid signaling to mTOR in vitro and in vivo. Metabolomics analysis further found that CYP7A1 induction not only decreased hepatic cholesterol but also altered phospholipid and sphingolipid compositions. Collectively, these results suggest that CYP7A1 induction interferes with growth factor activation of AKT/mTOR signaling possibly by altering membrane lipid composition. Finally, we showed that cholestyramine feeding restored impaired hepatic autophagy and improved metabolic homeostasis in Western diet-fed mice.
This study identified a novel CYP7A1-AKT-mTOR signaling axis that selectively induces hepatic autophagy, which helps improve hepatocellular integrity and metabolic homeostasis.
While genetic determinants strongly influence HDL cholesterol (HDLc) levels, most genetic causes underlying variation in HDLc remain unknown. We aimed to identify novel rare mutations with large effects in candidate genes contributing to extreme HDLc in humans, utilizing family-based Mendelian genetics. We performed next-generation sequencing of 456 candidate HDLc-regulating genes in 200 unrelated probands with extremely low (≤10th percentile) or high (≥90th percentile) HDLc. Probands were excluded if known mutations existed in the established HDLc-regulating genes ABCA1, APOA1, LCAT, cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP), endothelial lipase (LIPG), and UDP-N-acetyl-α-D-galactosamine:polypeptide N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase 2 (GALNT2). We identified 93 novel coding or splice-site variants in 72 candidate genes. Each variant was genotyped in the proband's family. Family-based association analyses were performed for variants with sufficient power to detect significance at P &lt; 0.05 with a total of 627 family members being assessed. Mutations in the genes glucokinase regulatory protein (GCKR), RNase L (RNASEL), leukocyte immunoglobulin-like receptor 3 (LILRA3), and dynein axonemal heavy chain 10 (DNAH10) segregated with elevated HDLc levels in families, while no mutations associated with low HDLc. Taken together, we have identified mutations in four novel genes that may play a role in regulating HDLc levels in humans. 
In familial lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) deficiency (FLD), deposition of abnormal lipoproteins in the renal stroma ultimately leads to renal failure. However, fish-eye disease (FED) does not lead to renal damage although the causative mutations for both FLD and FED lie within the same LCAT gene. This study was performed to identify the lipoproteins important for the development of renal failure in genetically diagnosed FLD in comparison with FED, using high-performance liquid chromatography with a gel filtration column.
Lipoprotein profiles of 9 patients with LCAT deficiency were examined. Four lipoprotein fractions specific to both FLD and FED were identified: (1) large lipoproteins (&gt;80 nm), (2) lipoproteins corresponding to large low-density lipoprotein (LDL), (3) lipoproteins corresponding to small LDL to large high-density lipoprotein, and (4) to small high-density lipoprotein. Contents of cholesteryl ester and triglyceride of the large LDL in FLD (below detection limit and 45.8±3.8%) and FED (20.7±6.4% and 28.0±6.5%) were significantly different, respectively. On in vitro incubation with recombinant LCAT, content of cholesteryl ester in the large LDL in FLD, but not in FED, was significantly increased (to 4.2±1.4%), whereas dysfunctional high-density lipoprotein was diminished in both FLD and FED.
Our novel analytic approach using high-performance liquid chromatography with a gel filtration column identified large LDL and high-density lipoprotein with a composition specific to FLD, but not to FED. The abnormal lipoproteins were sensitive to treatment with recombinant LCAT and thus may play a causal role in the renal pathology of FLD.
A kindred affected with fish eye disease (FED) from Oklahoma is reported. Two probands with corneal opacification had mean levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (C), apolipoprotein (apo) A-I, and apoA-I in very large alpha-1 HDL particles that were 9%, 17%, and 5% of normal, whereas their parents and 1 sibling had values that were 61%, 77%, and 72% of normal. The probands had no detectable lipoprotein-X, and had mean low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and triglyceride levels that were elevated. Their mean lecithin cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) activities, cholesterol esterification rates, and free cholesterol levels were 8%, 42%, and 258% of normal, whereas their parents and 1 sibling had values that were 55%, 49%, and 114% of normal. The defect was due to 1 common variant in the LCAT gene in exon 1: c101t causing a proline34leucine substitution and a novel mutation c1177t causing a threonine37methionine substitution, with the former variant being found in the father and 1 sibling, and the latter mutation being found in the mother, and both mutations being present in the 2 probands. FED is distinguished from familial LCAT deficiency (FLD) by the lack of anemia, splenomegaly, and renal insufficiency as well as normal or increased LDL-C. Both FLD and FED cases have marked HDL deficiency and corneal opacification, and FED cases may have premature coronary heart disease in contrast to FLD cases. Therapy, using presently available agents, in FED should be to optimize LDL-C levels, and 1 proband responded well to statin therapy. The investigational use of human recombinant LCAT as an enzyme source is ongoing. 
Although hypocholesterolemia is a reported finding in sickle cell disease (SCD), low-density lipoprotein (LDL)/high-density lipoprotein (HDL) subfractions and HDL-associated enzymes have not been determined in SCD patients. Blood was collected from 38 hemoglobin (Hb)A volunteers and 45 homozygous HbSS patients who had not received blood transfusions in the last 3 months. Serum lipids were measured by automated analyzer while LDL and HDL subfraction analysis was done by continuous disc polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Serum levels of cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP), lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT), apolipoprotein B (apoB) and apolipoprotein A-1 (apoA-I) were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels were significantly decreased, while TG levels were significantly increased in SCD patients compared to controls. A significant decrease in intermediate-density lipoprotein (IDL)-C, IDL-B, IDL-A and LDL-1 fractions were seen in SCD patients, while no significant difference was observed in small dense LDL particles. A significant decrease was seen in HDL-large, HDL-intermediate and HDL-small fractions in SCD patients versus controls. Levels of LCAT and ApoA-1 protein measured in SCD patients were significantly lower while no significant difference was observed in CETP and ApoB protein levels compared to controls. The reduction observed in LDL- and HDL-C in SCD patients was reflected as significantly decreased IDL, LDL-1 and HDL-subfractions. Decreased HDL subfractions may possibly lead to the reduced ApoA-1 and LCAT protein levels observed in SCD patients.
Epidemiological and clinical studies have shown that a low plasma high‑density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) level is a strong predictor of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) is a key enzyme in the formation, maturation and function of HDL. Therefore impaired LCAT function may enhance atherosclerosis because of defective cholesterol transport. In this study, we examined a 34-year old LCAT‑deficient patient and eight first-degree family members. There was a strong family history for CVD and type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2). The proband was found homozygous for a previously reported LCAT gene mutation (Thr37Met). A sister and two sons of the proband were heterozygous for the same mutation. The proband had DM2 and showed severe multivessel coronary artery disease, corneal opacification and extremely low HDL-C levels. Large HDL particles were absent while small HDL particles were increased. The HDL of the patient had a reduced ability to promote cell cholesterol efflux, and the low‑density lipoproteins (LDL) were more susceptible to oxidation. Among his family members, two heterozygotes and one non-carrier had early carotid or coronary atherosclerosis. In conclusion, as the increased LDL oxidability and structural and functional abnormalities of HDL particles have been reported in patients with obesity and diabetes, the results suggested that the adverse coronary risk profile, and not being LCAT deficient, may be responsible for the CVD found in our proband, and for the early atherosclerosis observed in the two heterozygotes and in the wild‑type family members.
We report a novel heterozygous apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I) missense mutation (c.517C&gt;A, p.Arg149Ser, designated as apoA-IBoston) in a 67-year-old woman and her 2 sons, who had mean serum high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, apoA-I, and apoA-I in very large α-1 HDL that were 10%, 35%, and 16% of normal, respectively (all P &lt; .05). The percentage of HDL cholesterol in the esterified form was also significantly (P &lt; .05) reduced to 52% of control values. Cholesteryl ester tranfer protein (CETP) activity was normal. The mean global, adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-binding cassette transporter A1 and scavenger receptor B type I-mediated cellular cholesterol efflux capacity in apoB-depleted serum from affected family members were 41%, 37%, 47%, 54%, and 48% of control values, respectively (all P &lt; .05). lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) activity in plasma was 71% of controls, whereas in the cell-based assay, it was 73% of control values (P &lt; .05). The data indicate that this novel apoA-I missense is associated with markedly decreased levels of HDL cholesterol and very large α-1 HDL, as well as decreased serum cellular cholesterol efflux and LCAT activity, but not with premature coronary heart disease, similar to other apoA-I mutations that have been associated with decreased LCAT activity. 
The cholesterol-esterifying enzyme, lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT), is believed to play a key role in reverse cholesterol transport. However, recent investigations have demonstrated that higher LCAT activity levels increase the formation of triglyceride (TG)-rich lipoproteins (TRLs) and atherogenesis. We hypothesized that higher LCAT activity measured as a serum cholesterol esterification rate by the endogenous substrate method might increase the formation of TRLs and thereby alter low-density lipoprotein (LDL) heterogeneity. The estimated LDL particle size [relative LDL migration (LDL-Rm)] was measured by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with the LipoPhor system (Joko, Tokyo, Japan) in 538 consecutive patients with at least risk factor for atherosclerosis. Multivariate regression analysis after adjustments for traditional risk factors identified elevated TRL-related marker (TG, remnant-like particle cholesterol, apolipoprotein C-II, and apolipoprotein C-III) levels as independent predictors of smaller-sized LDL particle size, both in the overall subject population and in the subset of patients with serum LDL cholesterol levels of &lt;100 mg/dL. Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of the LCAT activity (0.79; sensitivity 60 %; specificity 84.8 %) was observed for the evaluation of the indicators of an LDL-Rm value of ≥0.40, which suggests the presence of large amounts of small-dense LDL. The results lend support to the hypothesis that increased LCAT activity may be associated with increased formation of TRLs, leading to a reduction in LDL particle size. Therefore, to reduce the risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, it may be of importance to pay attention not only to a quantitative change in the serum LDL-C, but also to the LCAT activity which is possibly associated with LDL heterogeneity. 
Plasma apolipoprotein (apo)D, a ubiquitously expressed protein that binds small hydrophobic ligands, is found mainly on HDL particles. According to studies of human genetics and lipid disorders, plasma apoD levels positively correlate with HDL-cholesterol and apoAI levels. Thus, we tested the hypothesis that apoD was a regulator of HDL metabolism.
We compared the plasma lipid and lipoprotein profiles of wild-type (WT) C57BL/6 mice with apoD-/- mice on a C57BL/6 background after receiving a high fat-high cholesterol diet for 12 weeks. ApoD-/- mice had higher HDL-cholesterol levels (61±13-apoD-/- vs. 52±10-WT-males; 37±11-apoD-/- vs. 22±2 WT-female) than WT mice with sex-specific changes in total plasma levels of cholesterol and other lipids. Compared to WT, the HDL of apoD-/- mice showed an increase in large, lipid-rich HDL particles and according to size various quantities and sizes of LDL particles. Plasma levels of lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase in the control and apoD-/- mice were not different, however, plasma phospholipid transfer protein activity was modestly elevated (+10%) only in male apoD-/- mice. An in vivo HDL metabolism experiment with isolated Western-fed apoD-/- HDL particles showed that female apoD-/- mice had a 36% decrease in the fractional catabolic rate of HDL cholesteryl ester. Hepatic SR-BI and LDLR protein levels were significantly decreased; accordingly, LDL-cholesterol and apoB levels were increased in female mice.
In the context of a high fat-high cholesterol diet, apoD deficiency in female mice is associated with increases in both plasma HDL and LDL-cholesterol levels, reflecting changes in expression of SR-BI and LDL receptors, which may impact diet-induced atherosclerosis.
Low high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C) in patients with coronary heart disease (CHD) may be caused by rate-limiting amounts of lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT). Raising LCAT may be beneficial for CHD, as well as for familial LCAT deficiency, a rare disorder of low HDL-C.
To determine safety and tolerability of recombinant human LCAT infusion in subjects with stable CHD and low HDL-C and its effect on plasma lipoproteins.
A phase 1b, open-label, single-dose escalation study was conducted to evaluate safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of recombinant human LCAT (ACP-501). Four cohorts with stable CHD and low HDL-C were dosed (0.9, 3.0, 9.0, and 13.5 mg/kg, single 1-hour infusions) and followed up for 28 days. ACP-501 was well tolerated, and there were no serious adverse events. Plasma LCAT concentrations were dose-proportional, increased rapidly, and declined with an apparent terminal half-life of 42 hours. The 0.9-mg/kg dose did not significantly change HDL-C; however, 6 hours after doses of 3.0, 9.0, and 13.5 mg/kg, HDL-C was elevated by 6%, 36%, and 42%, respectively, and remained above baseline ≤4 days. Plasma cholesteryl esters followed a similar time course as HDL-C. ACP-501 infusion rapidly decreased small- and intermediate-sized HDL, whereas large HDL increased. Pre-β-HDL also rapidly decreased and was undetectable ≤12 hours post ACP-501 infusion.
ACP-501 has an acceptable safety profile after a single intravenous infusion. Lipid and lipoprotein changes indicate that recombinant human LCAT favorably alters HDL metabolism and support recombinant human LCAT use in future clinical trials in CHD and familial LCAT deficiency patients.

Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is associated with changes in HDL levels, composition and sub-fraction profile. Whether these alterations affect HDL anti-atherogenic function, specifically measured as its capacity to perform cholesterol efflux, is not yet clearly known.
To evaluate the relation between serum cholesterol efflux capacity and the changes in HDL composition and sub-fraction profile in MetS.
In 35 non-treated MetS patients and 15 healthy controls, HDL mediated cholesterol efflux was measured as the ability of apoB-depleted serum to accept cholesterol from cholesterol-loaded BHK cells expressing either ABCA1 or ABCG1. Additionally we determined: lipid profile, HDL sub-fractions (NMR) and LCAT mass (ELISA). Isolated HDL (δ:1.063-1.210 g/mL) was chemically characterized. Pre-β1-HDL was determined by 2D-electrophoresis in a sub-group of MetS and controls (n = 6 each).
Surprisingly, MetS patients presented higher ABCA1 mediated cholesterol efflux (10.4 ± 1.8 vs. 8.7 ± 0.3%; p = 0.0001), without differences in ABCG1 efflux. In MetS, HDL showed reduction in particle size and number (p &lt; 0.02) and lower large/small HDL ratio (p = 0.05), as well as triglyceride enrichment (p = 0.0001). Pre-β1-HDL was increased in MetS (p = 0.048) and correlated with ABCA1-cholesterol efflux (r = 0.64; p = 0.042). LCAT mass showed a tendency to reduction in MetS (p = 0.08), and inversely correlated with ABCA1-cholesterol efflux (r = -0.51; p = 0.001), independently of obesity and insulin-resistance (β = -0.40, p = 0.034).
This is the first description of ABCA1 mediated cholesterol efflux in MetS. Regardless the reduced HDL-cholesterol, in vitro cholesterol efflux capacity by ABCA1 was enhanced, linked to increased pre-β1-HDL and slightly reduced in LCAT mass that would probably reflect a delay in reverse cholesterol transport occurring in MetS.
Antarctic fishes of the suborder Notothenioidei characteristically possess large stores of neutral lipids that have been shown to be important both in conferring buoyant lift and as a caloric resource for energy metabolism. Previous work has established that the aerobic energy metabolism of Antarctic fish is fueled predominantly by the catabolism of fatty acids, with the catabolic machinery displaying a preference for the oxidation of unsaturated fatty acids. The composition of the fatty acids released from adipose tissue of Antarctic fish during lipolysis, however, has not previously been demonstrated. Employing a substrate competition assay, we have characterized the substrate specificity of hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) from adipose tissue of the Antarctic fish Trematomus newnesi. Rates of oleic acid release from radiolabeled triolein were quantified in the presence and absence of a nonradiolabeled cosubstrate. Polyunsaturated species of triacylglycerols (TAGs) containing 18:2 or 20:4 depressed rates of oleate release by 70-75% below control values. Most of the molecular species of TAG containing monoenoic fatty acids (i.e. those containing 14:1, 16:1 or 20:1) had no significant effect on rates of oleate release. By contrast, oleate release from triolein was actually stimulated (by 2-4-fold) by both saturated species of TAG (i.e. those containing 14:0, 16:0 and 18:0) and those possessing long-chain (22:1 and 24:1) monoenes (by 1.2-1.5-fold). Thus, the rank order of substrate preference for adipose tissue HSL was: polyunsaturates &gt; monoenes &gt; saturates. Degree of fatty acid unsaturation had a more marked effect on rates of hydrolysis than did fatty acid chain length. In addition, the enzyme displayed a preference for the hydrolysis of sn-1,2 rather than sn-1,3 diacylglycerols. These data indicate that the substrate specificity of adipose tissue HSL may be an important factor in determining which fatty acids are mobilized during stimulated lipolysis and which are made available for catabolism by other tissues of Antarctic fishes. Our data further suggest that TAGs containing some saturated fatty acids may be sufficiently poor substrates for catabolism by HSL to explain their disproportionate accumulation in adipose tissue. Such a mechanism could also contribute to the ontogenetic accumulation of fats that has been reported as an underlying basis for the positive correlation of buoyancy with increasing body mass in this group.
The effects of dexamethasone on lipid accumulation by human monocyte-derived macrophages were investigated. Preincubation of macrophages with dexamethasone for a period of 16-20 h resulted in a reproducible increase (3.5-fold) in the incorporation of oleate into cholesteryl esters. The effect was specific because no alterations were observed in oleate incorporation into triglycerides or phospholipids. Measurement of cellular cholesteryl esters indicated a fourfold increase after preincubation with dexamethasone. This increase was mediated by opposite effects on synthesis and breakdown of these lipids. Dexamethasone produced a 60% increase in activity of the enzyme acyl-CoA: cholesterol O-acyltransferase (ACAT), active in synthesis of cholesteryl esters, and a 40% decrease in that of neutral cholesteryl esterase, active in cholesteryl ester breakdown. The increased ACAT activity appeared to reflect increased mRNA for the enzyme. The effects of dexamethasone on cholesteryl ester accumulation by macrophages reached statistical significance at a concentration of 100 nM. They were dose dependent, and saturation was observed at around 1 microM. The effects were significant at low concentrations of cholesterol in the medium. At high-medium cholesterol, there was a large cholesterol-induced increase in ACAT activity that obscured most of the effect of dexamethasone. In general, the data suggest that high glucocorticoid levels enhance lipid accumulation by macrophages and thus would have an atherogenic action that is independent of serum cholesterol.
In cerebral amyloidoses, such as Alzheimer's disease, proteolytic processing of the precursor protein is a fundamental mechanism of the disease, since it generates the amyloid protein. However, the putative significance of proteases in extracerebral amyloidoses is less well defined. In this study, we investigated the biological significance of cathepsin (Cath) B, CathK, and CathL in the pathology and pathogenesis of extracerebral amyloidoses by using the murine model of reactive or secondary AA amyloidosis with three different cathepsin-deficient mouse strains. Extracerebral AA amyloid was induced by injecting amyloid-enhancing factor and silver nitrate into CathB(-/-), CathK(-/-), and CathL(-/-) mice. Wild-type mice served as a control. CathK(-/-) mice deposited over 90% more amyloid and CathL(-/-) mice 60% less amyloid than the control (p &lt; 0.0001). The amyloid load in CathB(-/-) mice did not differ from that in wild-type mice. In vitro degradation experiments with recombinant human and murine serum amyloid A (SAA) 1.1 and CathK and CathL showed that CathL generates a large number of differently sized SAA cleavage products. One of these fragments spans the heparin/heparan sulphate binding site and the neutral cholesterol ester hydrolase activating region of SAA. CathK showed only endoproteolytic activity and did not generate any AA amyloid-like peptides. This study provides unequivocal evidence that proteases modulate amyloid load in extracerebral amyloidosis. CathL was identified as an amyloid-promoting and CathK as an amyloid-retarding cysteine protease. CathB may only modulate the primary structure of the amyloid peptide without affecting amyloid load.
Neutral cholesterol ester hydrolase (NCEH) accounts for a large part of the nCEH activity in macrophage foam cells, a hallmark of atherosclerosis, but its subcellular localization and structure-function relationship are unknown. Here, we determined subcellular localization, glycosylation, and nCEH activity of a series of NCEH mutants expressed in macrophages. NCEH is a single-membrane-spanning type II membrane protein comprising three domains: N-terminal, catalytic, and lipid-binding domains. The N-terminal domain serves as a type II signal anchor sequence to recruit NCEH to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) with its catalytic domain within the lumen. All of the putative N-linked glycosylation sites (Asn(270), Asn(367), and Asn(389)) of NCEH are glycosylated. Glycosylation at Asn(270), which is located closest to the catalytic serine motif, is important for the enzymatic activity. Cholesterol loading by incubation with acetyl-LDL does not change the ER localization of NCEH. In conclusion, NCEH is targeted to the ER of macrophages, where it hydrolyzes CE to deliver cholesterol for efflux out of the cells.
The objective of this assessment was to identify and evaluate data sets for use in the surveillance of arsenic hazards and private well drinking water use in Louisiana.
Features, strengths, and limitations of the data sets are described, and prioritization criteria are applied to identify areas in need of further monitoring or outreach.
Recent efforts have been made by the Environmental Public Health Tracking Network to evaluate the quality of private well water data for the purpose of supporting state and national surveillance activities. Like most states, Louisiana does not collect or mandate reporting of private well water quality data. Therefore, responding to public concerns about private well water quality requires an identification and evaluation of existing data.
Data evaluated include measures of arsenic in groundwater and soil, private well water use, and biomonitoring results.
The Environmental Protection Agency's Safe Drinking Water Information System and the US Geological Survey's Water Use data set were the most informative, nationally available data sets for conducting private well water arsenic surveillance. Three priority parishes were identified on the basis of a selection criteria, although all parishes require more private well sampling data.
While the data reviewed enabled preliminary identification of parishes in need of monitoring and outreach, data limitations (particularly, a lack of statewide well water quality data) prevent a comprehensive evaluation of well water arsenic hazards and private well water use. A large number of unregistered wells further impede risk determination. Reliance on existing data sources is necessary, but development of metadata documentation is essential to prevent data misinterpretation. Increased outreach and policies to promote or mandate private well testing and reporting are needed to enable a comprehensive private well water tracking system.
Geographically distributed environmental factors influence the burden of diseases such as asthma. Our objective was to identify sparse environmental variables associated with asthma diagnosis gathered from a large electronic health record (EHR) dataset while controlling for spatial variation. An EHR dataset from the University of Wisconsin's Family Medicine, Internal Medicine and Pediatrics Departments was obtained for 199,220 patients aged 5-50years over a three-year period. Each patient's home address was geocoded to one of 3456 geographic census block groups. Over one thousand block group variables were obtained from a commercial database. We developed a Sparse Spatial Environmental Analysis (SASEA). Using this method, the environmental variables were first dimensionally reduced with sparse principal component analysis. Logistic thin plate regression spline modeling was then used to identify block group variables associated with asthma from sparse principal components. The addresses of patients from the EHR dataset were distributed throughout the majority of Wisconsin's geography. Logistic thin plate regression spline modeling captured spatial variation of asthma. Four sparse principal components identified via model selection consisted of food at home, dog ownership, household size, and disposable income variables. In rural areas, dog ownership and renter occupied housing units from significant sparse principal components were associated with asthma. Our main contribution is the incorporation of sparsity in spatial modeling. SASEA sequentially added sparse principal components to Logistic thin plate regression spline modeling. This method allowed association of geographically distributed environmental factors with asthma using EHR and environmental datasets. SASEA can be applied to other diseases with environmental risk factors. 
Poikilothermic disease vectors can respond to altered climates through spatial changes in both population size and phenology. Quantitative descriptors to characterize, analyze and visualize these dynamic responses are lacking, particularly across large spatial domains. In order to demonstrate the value of a spatially explicit, dynamic modeling approach, we assessed spatial changes in the population dynamics of Ixodes scapularis, the Lyme disease vector, using a temperature-forced population model simulated across a grid of 4 × 4 km cells covering the eastern United States, using both modeled (Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) 3.2.1) baseline/current (2001-2004) and projected (Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 4.5 and RCP 8.5; 2057-2059) climate data. Ten dynamic population features (DPFs) were derived from simulated populations and analyzed spatially to characterize the regional population response to current and future climate across the domain. Each DPF under the current climate was assessed for its ability to discriminate observed Lyme disease risk and known vector presence/absence, using data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Peak vector population and month of peak vector population were the DPFs that performed best as predictors of current Lyme disease risk. When examined under baseline and projected climate scenarios, the spatial and temporal distributions of DPFs shift and the seasonal cycle of key questing life stages is compressed under some scenarios. Our results demonstrate the utility of spatial characterization, analysis and visualization of dynamic population responses-including altered phenology-of disease vectors to altered climate.
We compared a statewide telephone health survey with electronic health record (EHR) data from a large Wisconsin health system to estimate asthma prevalence in Wisconsin.
We developed frequency tables and logistic regression models using Wisconsin Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System and University of Wisconsin primary care clinic data. We compared adjusted odds ratios (AORs) from each model.
Between 2007 and 2009, the EHR database contained 376,000 patients (30,000 with asthma), and 23,000 (1850 with asthma) responded to the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System telephone survey. AORs for asthma were similar in magnitude and direction for the majority of covariates, including gender, age, and race/ethnicity, between survey and EHR models. The EHR data had greater statistical power to detect associations than did survey data, especially in pediatric and ethnic populations, because of larger sample sizes.
EHRs can be used to estimate asthma prevalence in Wisconsin adults and children. EHR data may improve public health chronic disease surveillance using high-quality data at the local level to better identify areas of disparity and risk factors and guide education and health care interventions.
Mercury is a metal with widespread distribution in aquatic ecosystems and significant neurodevelopmental toxicity in humans. Fish biomonitoring for total mercury has been conducted in South Carolina (SC) since 1976, and consumption advisories have been posted for many SC waterways. However, there is limited information on the potential reproductive impacts of mercury due to recreational or subsistence fish consumption.
To address this issue, geocoded residential locations for live births from the Vital Statistics Registry (1995-2005, N = 362,625) were linked with spatially interpolated total mercury concentrations in fish to estimate potential mercury exposure from consumption of locally caught fish. Generalized estimating equations were used to test the hypothesis that risk of low birth weight (LBW, &lt;2,500 grams) or preterm birth (PTB, &lt; 37 weeks clinical gestation) was greater among women living in areas with elevated total mercury in fish, after adjustment for confounding. Separate analyses estimated term LBW and PTB risks using residential proximity to rivers with fish consumption advisories to characterize exposure.
Term LBW was more likely among women residing in areas in the upper quartile of predicted total mercury in fish (odds ratio [OR] = 1.04; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.00-1.09) or within 8 kilometers of a river with a 'do not eat' fish advisory (1.05; 1.00-1.11) compared to the lowest quartile, or rivers without fish consumption restrictions, respectively. When stratified by race, risks for term LBW or PTB were 10-18% more likely among African-American (AA) mothers living in areas with the highest total fish mercury concentrations.
To our knowledge, this is the first study to examine the relationship between fish total mercury concentrations and adverse reproductive outcomes in a large population-based sample that included AA women. The ecologic nature of exposure assessment in this study precludes causal inference. However, the results suggest a need for more detailed investigations to characterize patterns of local fish consumption and potential dose-response relationships between mercury exposure and adverse reproductive outcomes, particularly among AA mothers.
Benthic dinoflagellates in the genus Gambierdiscus produce the ciguatoxin precursors responsible for the occurrence of ciguatera toxicity. The prevalence of ciguatera toxins in fish has been linked to the presence and distribution of toxin-producing species in coral reef ecosystems, which is largely determined by the presence of suitable benthic habitat and environmental conditions favorable for growth. Here using single factor experiments, we examined the effects of salinity, irradiance, and temperature on growth of 17 strains of Gambierdiscus representing eight species/phylotypes (G. belizeanus, G. caribaeus, G. carolinianus, G. carpenteri, G. pacificus, G. silvae, Gambierdiscus sp. type 4-5), most of which were established from either Marakei Island, Republic of Kiribati, or St. Thomas, United States Virgin Island (USVI). Comparable to prior studies, growth rates fell within the range of 0-0.48 divisions day(-1). In the salinity and temperature studies, Gambierdiscus responded in a near Gaussian, non-linear manner typical for such studies, with optimal and suboptimal growth occurring in the range of salinities of 25 and 45 and 21.0 and 32.5°C. In the irradiance experiment, no mortality was observed; however, growth rates at 55 μmol photons · m(-2) · s(-1) were lower than those at 110-400 μmol photons · m(-2) · s(-1). At the extremes of the environmental conditions tested, growth rates were highly variable, evidenced by large coefficients of variability. However, significant differences in intraspecific growth rates were typically found only at optimal or near-optimal growth conditions. Polynomial regression analyses showed that maximum growth occurred at salinity and temperature levels of 30.1-38.5 and 23.8-29.2°C, respectively. Gambierdiscus growth patterns varied among species, and within individual species: G. belizeanus, G. caribaeus, G. carpenteri, and G. pacificus generally exhibited a wider range of tolerance to environmental conditions, which may explain their broad geographic distribution. In contrast, G. silvae and Gambierdiscus sp. types 4-5 all displayed a comparatively narrow range of tolerance to temperature, salinity, and irradiance.
To assess gaps in emergency department (ED) asthma management at Florida hospitals.
Survey instrument with open- and closed-ended questions. Topics included availability of specific asthma management modalities, compliance with national guidelines, employment of specialized asthma care personnel, and efforts toward performance improvement.
Emergency departments at 10 large hospitals in the state of Florida.
Clinical care providers and health administrators from participating hospitals.
Compliance with national asthma care guideline standards, provision of specific recommended treatment modalities and resources, employment of specialized asthma care personnel, and engagement in performance improvement efforts.
Our results suggest inconsistency among sampled Florida hospitals' adherence to national standards for treatment of asthma in EDs. Several hospitals were refining their emergency care protocols to incorporate guideline recommendations. Despite a lack of formal ED protocols in some hospitals, adherence to national guidelines for emergency care nonetheless remained robust for patient education and medication prescribing, but it was weaker for formal care planning and medical follow-up.
Identified deficiencies in emergency asthma care present a number of opportunities for strategic mitigation of identified gaps. We conclude with suggestions to help Florida hospitals achieve success with ED asthma care reform. Team-based learning activities may offer an optimal strategy for sharing and implementing best practices.
Obesity prevention has emerged as one of public health's top priorities. Public health agencies need reliable data on population health status to guide prevention efforts. Existing survey data sources provide county-level estimates; obtaining sub-county estimates from survey data can be prohibitively expensive. State-issued identification cards are an alternate data source for community-level obesity estimates. We computed body mass index for 3.2 million adult Oregonians who were issued a driver license or identification card between 2003 and 2010. Statewide estimates of obesity prevalence and average body mass index were compared to the Oregon Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS). After geocoding addresses we calculated average adult body mass index for every census tract and block group in the state. Sub-county estimates reveal striking patterns in the population's weight status. Annual obesity prevalence estimates from identification cards averaged 18% lower than the BRFSS for men and 31% lower for women. Body mass index estimates averaged 2% lower than the BRFSS for men and 5% lower for women. Identification card records are a promising data source to augment tracking of obesity. People do tend to misrepresent their weight, but the consistent bias does not obscure patterns and trends. Large numbers of records allow for stable estimates for small geographic areas. 
Electronic health record (EHR) systems provide an opportunity to use a novel data source for population health surveillance. Validation studies that compare prevalence estimates from EHRs and surveys most often use difference testing, which can, because of large sample sizes, lead to detection of significant differences that are not meaningful. We explored a novel application of the two one-sided t test (TOST) to assess the equivalence of prevalence estimates in 2 population-based surveys to inform margin selection for validating EHR-based surveillance prevalence estimates derived from large samples.
We compared prevalence estimates of health indicators in the 2013 Community Health Survey (CHS) and the 2013-2014 New York City Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NYC HANES) by using TOST, a 2-tailed t test, and other goodness-of-fit measures.
A ±5 percentage-point equivalence margin for a TOST performed well for most health indicators. For health indicators with a prevalence estimate of less than 10% (extreme obesity [CHS, 3.5%; NYC HANES, 5.1%] and serious psychological distress [CHS, 5.2%; NYC HANES, 4.8%]), a ±2.5 percentage-point margin was more consistent with other goodness-of-fit measures than the larger percentage-point margins.
A TOST with a ±5 percentage-point margin was useful in establishing equivalence, but a ±2.5 percentage-point margin may be appropriate for health indicators with a prevalence estimate of less than 10%. Equivalence testing can guide future efforts to validate EHR data.
Electronic health records (EHRs) from primary care providers can be used for chronic disease surveillance; however, EHR-based prevalence estimates may be biased toward people who seek care. This study sought to describe the characteristics of an in-care population and compare them with those of a not-in-care population to inform interpretation of EHR data.
We used data from the 2013-2014 New York City Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NYC HANES), considered the gold standard for estimating disease prevalence, and the 2013 Community Health Survey, and classified participants as in care or not in care, on the basis of their report of seeing a health care provider in the previous year. We used χ(2) tests to compare the distribution of demographic characteristics, health care coverage and access, and chronic conditions between the 2 populations.
According to the Community Health Survey, approximately 4.1 million (71.7%) adults aged 20 or older had seen a health care provider in the previous year; according to NYC HANES, approximately 4.7 million (75.1%) had. In both surveys, the in-care population was more likely to be older, female, non-Hispanic, and insured compared with the not-in-care population. The in-care population from the NYC HANES also had a higher prevalence of diabetes (16.7% vs 6.9%; P &lt; .001), hypercholesterolemia (35.7% vs 22.3%; P &lt; .001), and hypertension (35.5% vs 26.4%; P &lt; .001) than the not-in-care population.
Systematic differences between in-care and not-in-care populations warrant caution in using primary care data to generalize to the population at large. Future efforts to use primary care data for chronic disease surveillance need to consider the intended purpose of data collected in these systems as well as the characteristics of the population using primary care.
Human embryonic tissues were investigated during the period of organogenesis with a combination of substrate probes, selective inhibitors and immunoprobes in terms of their capacity to express functional P450 isoforms. A series of phenoxazone ethers utilized as substrate probes revealed that human embryonic hepatic, pulmonary, renal, adrenal and cardiac tissues each contained a complement of functional P450 isoforms when analyzed between days 50 and 60 of gestation. Preparations of each of these tissues contained isoforms capable of catalyzing O-demethylation, O-deethylation, O-depentylation and O-debenzylation of the respective phenoxazone ethers. Investigations with chemical inhibitors and inhibitory antibodies as well as comparisons with vector-expressed, human P450 isoforms suggested that isoforms of P450 subfamilies 1A, 2B, 2C or 3A were not major contributors to any of the observed reactions. The P450-dependent reactions studied exhibited several unexpected and unusual characteristics including a preference for NADH over NADPH as the initial electron donor. Results were consistent with the concept that conceptal-specific P450 isoforms participate in the human embryonic O-dealkylation/debenzylation probe reactions investigated.
A region of high nucleic acid conservation present in many members of the phenobarbital (PB) family of cytochromes P-450 (P-450s) was targeted for the construction of an 18 base, eight-fold degenerate, consensus oligomer (the PB-mer). When utilized to screen a rabbit liver cDNA library, the PB-mer enabled the isolation of P-450 cDNAs. One isolate, designated pP-450 1a, was characterized by nucleotide sequence, as well as Northern and Southern blot analyses and was demonstrated to be a novel form. Primary nucleotide sequence indicates that this cDNA is highly homologous to several P-450 cDNAs, but only in the protein coding region. The 3'-noncoding segment of P-450 1a is longer and diverges markedly from known P-450 cDNAs in the rabbit PB family.
Prenatal cocaine exposure results in behavioral abnormalities throughout development in rats, but little is known regarding the biological mechanisms underlying these abnormalities. Pregnant rats received subcutaneous twice-daily injections (1 ml/kg) of normal saline or 15 mg/kg of cocaine hydrochloride throughout gestation (gestation days 1-20). Following delivery, pups were placed with untreated surrogates. Male and female pups were killed on postnatal days 30, 60 or 120 for assessment of 5-HT(1A) receptor development in the forebrain, diencephalon, midbrain and pons using radiolabel immunocytochemistry. Findings revealed gender and age differences in developmental regulation of 5-HT(1A) receptors, indicating that male rats are more susceptible to long-term consequences of prenatal cocaine exposure in comparison to females. This study also demonstrates gender-specific development of serotonin (5-HT(1A)) receptors across postnatal ages, demonstrating a fundamentally different pattern of development of 5-HT(1A) receptors between males and females.
Multiple genes have been shown to be independently hypermethylated in lymphoid malignancies. We report here on the extent of concurrent methylation of E-cadherin, Dap-kinase, O(6)MGMT, p73, p16, p15 and p14 in 129 pediatric ALL cases. While most of these genes demonstrated methylation in a proportion of cases, O(6)MGMT, p16 and p14 were infrequently methylated (11, 7 and 3%, respectively). Methylation of at least one gene was found in the vast majority (83%) of cases. To determine the extent and concordance of methylation we calculated a methylation index (MI=number of methylated genes/number of studied genes) for each sample. The average MI was 0.28, corresponding to 2/7 methylated genes. MI was correlated with standard prognostic factors, including immunophenotype, age, sex, WBC and presence of specific translocations (TEL-AML1, BCR-ABL, E2A-PBX1 or MLL-AF4). We determined that children &gt;/=10 years old and children presenting with high WBC (&gt;/=50 x 10(9)/l) both associated with a higher MI (P&lt;0.01 and &lt;0.05, respectively). T-ALLs demonstrated a lower MI (median=0.17) than precursor B ALLs (median=0.28). Among the different molecular subgroups, MLL-ALLs had the highest MI (mean=0.35), while ALLs carrying the t(1;19) had the lowest MI (mean=0.07). The most common epigenetic lesion in childhood ALL was methylation of E-cadherin (72%) independent of the molecular subtype or other clinicopathological factors.
The most common nonrandom translocation found among childhood pre-B acute lymphoblastic leukemias (ALL) is t(1;19)(q23;p13), which frequently results in fusion of E2A with PBX1. However, rare cases of childhood ALL and various other hematological diseases with t(1;19) lack the E2A-PBX1 fusion. Analyzing a cell line with pre-B-cell phenotype, TS-2, that carries t(1;19)(q23;p13) but lacks the E2A-PBX1 fusion, we successfully cloned the breakpoints, which fell within introns of MEF2D and DAZAP1. Both chimeric transcripts, MEF2D-DAZAP1 and DAZAP1-MEF2D, whose sequences indicated in-frame fusions between MEF2D and DAZAP1, were expressed in TS-2 cells and in bone-marrow cells of the patient from whom the TS-2 was established. MEF2D-DAZAP1 and DAZAP1-MEF2D proteins were both located in the nucleus, and MEF2D-DAZAP1 was able to form dimers with MEF2D and HDAC4. In addition, exogenous expression of MEF2D-DAZAP1 and DAZAP1-MEF2D promoted the growth of HeLa cells. Given the frequency of t(1;19) without the E2A-PBX1 fusion in hematological malignancies, we suggest that MEF2D / DAZAP1 rearrangements might be involved in the pathogenesis of those diseases.
Human monocyte chemotactic factor-3 (MCP-3) belongs to the C-C chemokines, which are cytokines involved in cell recruitment in inflammation and cancer. Northern blotting and reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analyses showed that the MCP-3 gene is expressed in many human tissues and tumor cell lines and that the expression level is increased by various stimuli. Measles virus and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) induced MCP-3 mRNA after 6 hr of stimulation. Interferon-beta (IFN-beta) induced MCP-3 mRNA after 16 hr, a time point when the PMA-induced mRNA had the tendency to level off. No significant increase in MCP-3 mRNA levels was observed in MG-63 cells after stimulation with interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta). To elucidate the regulation of MCP-3 gene expression, we determined the sequence of 5 kb of the MCP-3 promoter. This sequence contained a microsatellite that was shown to be polymorphic in various cell lines. Next 5'-deletion mutants of the promoter were generated and transfected into MG-63 cells, demonstrating the presence of several positive and negative transcriptional regulatory elements. One of the positive elements was located at -37, only 21 bp upstream from the TATAA box. This element was similar to an AP-1 element and also to a homeodomain protein Pbx1 binding site. A deletion mutant from -110 to +52 possessed the highest promoter activity, and the longer deletion mutants had relatively low activities. The region between -190 and -172 contained an Ets-like element and inhibited promoter activity. Stimulation with PMA dramatically increased promoter activity through activation of a positive element present between -172 and -100. The same 5'-deletion mutants were transfected into HeLa and Jurkat cells. None of the deletion mutants had any significant activity in Jurkat cells. In HeLa cells, low levels of MCP-3 mRNA were detected by RT-PCR, but the profile of the promoter activities of the deletion mutants was different from that seen in MG-63 cells.
To demonstrate that a molecular screening by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) of TEL/AML1, E2A/PBX1 and BCR/ABL genes in pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukaemia is a rapid method that allows one to exceed the percentage of adult patients with the BCR/ABL rearrangement.
12 Spanish children with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia were studied, 11 of them newly diagnosed and 1 relapsed. The patients were between 18 months and 10 years old. Bone marrow aspiration was collected between april and december 1996, RNA was isolated and cDNA was subjected to PCR amplification for TEL/AML1, E2A/PBX1 and BCR/ABL genes. Normal ABL and E2A genes were studied as amplification controls.
One of these hybrid genes was found in 33.3% of patients studied. TEL/AML1 in two cases (16.6%), E2A/PBX1 in one case (8.3%) and BCR/ABL in another one (8.3%).
On the basis of these data it would be useful to achieve a molecular screening of TEL/AML1, E2A/PBX1 and BCR/ABL genes in pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukaemia for allowing a molecular classification in a great percentage of patients that exceed the BCR/ABL positivity in adults.
Genetic examination of childhood leukemia has not been available in Iraq. We here report the frequency of TEL-AML1, E2A-PBX1, MLL-AF4, and BCR-ABL chimeric transcripts in 264 Iraqi children newly diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), using FTA cards impregnated with bone marrow aspirate or whole blood.
The diagnosis of ALL was made according to standard French-American-British morphologic criteria. Based on the results of storage temperature and duration, most of the FTA samples were preserved at 4°C for up to 6 weeks in five Iraqi hospitals and then transferred to Japan for molecular analysis. Nested reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction was adopted for the analysis.
TEL-AML1 chimeric transcript product was found in 32 (12.1%) of 264 ALL patients. Eleven (4.2%) patients, 4 (1.5%) patients, and 11 (4.2%) patients had E2A-PBX1 mRNA, MLL-AF4 mRNA, and BCR-ABL mRNA, respectively. One patient had both TEL-AML1 and E2A-PBX1 fusion genes. The incidence of TEL-AML1 in Iraqi ALL children appears to be similar to or slightly higher than those of Jordan (12%) and Kuwait (7%). The prevalence and clinical findings of ALL patients with either E2A-PBX1 or BCR-ABL were comparable to the data reported elsewhere.
International collaboration via FTA cards may be helpful to improve diagnosis and management of patients with hematological malignancies in low-income and underdeveloped countries.
To detect the expression of the fusion genes resulting from chromosome abnormalities in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia(ALL) and its conformity to WHO classification.
Sixty-two children with ALL were investigated. The expression of fusion genes was determined by multiplex reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), karyotyping (R band) and immunophenotyping (by flow cytometry) were also performed.
Of the 62 patients, 23(37.1%) were found to carry 13 different fusion genes. The patients with immunophenotype of Pre-B-ALL were found to carry: TEL/AML1(3 cases); E2A/PBX1, E2A/HLF, TLS/ERG, MLL/AF4, MLL/AF9, MLL/AF10, MLL/AFX-MLL/AF6-MLL/ELL, MLL/AF6-MLL/ELL, dupMLL (one case for each); and HOX11 (6 cases). The patients with immunophenotype of Pre-T-ALL were found to carry: TAL1D (4 cases, one is also found to have HOX11 expression); and HOX11 (2 cases). The multiplex RT-PCR in combination with chromosome analysis revealed genetic abnormalities in 69.4%(43/62) of childhood ALL.
Multiplex RT-PCR combined with chromosome analysis and immunophenotyping can provide reliable and helpful information for the diagnosis, therapy evaluation and prognosis prediction in childhood ALL, which may also serve as a basis on which to implement the criteria of WHO classification.
It remains controversial whether deficiency of the Niemann-Pick C1 (npc1) protein results in altered cholesterol signaling at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). In this report, we have measured the processed, nuclear form of sterol regulatory element binding protein (SREBP)-1 in livers of npc1 wild-type, heterozygous, and homozygous deficient mice, alone, and in combination with deficiencies of the low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) or the multiple drug resistant (mdr)1a, P-glycoprotein. Cleavage of SREBPs to activated forms normally occurs when the ER is deficient in cholesterol. A large decrease in processed SREBP-1 was evident in fasted npc1(-/-) mice and npc1(-/-), mdr1a(-/-) mice, with no decrease evident in npc1(-/-), LDLR(-/-) mice. These results suggest that the increase in cellular cholesterol which occurs in npc1(-/-) and in npc1(-/-), mdr1a(-/-) mice includes the sites responsible for cholesterol signaling, while the similar increase in cholesterol found in npc1(-/-), LDLR(-/-) mice does not.
Similar to other positive-strand RNA viruses, hepatitis C virus (HCV) causes massive rearrangements of intracellular membranes, resulting in a membranous web (MW) composed of predominantly double-membrane vesicles (DMVs), the presumed sites of RNA replication. DMVs are enriched for cholesterol, but mechanistic details on the source and recruitment of cholesterol to the viral replication organelle are only partially known. Here we focused on selected lipid transfer proteins implicated in direct lipid transfer at various endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-membrane contact sites. RNA interference (RNAi)-mediated knockdown identified several hitherto unknown HCV dependency factors, such as steroidogenic acute regulatory protein-related lipid transfer domain protein 3 (STARD3), oxysterol-binding protein-related protein 1A and -B (OSBPL1A and -B), and Niemann-Pick-type C1 (NPC1), all residing at late endosome and lysosome membranes and required for efficient HCV RNA replication but not for replication of the closely related dengue virus. Focusing on NPC1, we found that knockdown or pharmacological inhibition caused cholesterol entrapment in lysosomal vesicles concomitant with decreased cholesterol abundance at sites containing the viral replicase factor NS5A. In untreated HCV-infected cells, unesterified cholesterol accumulated at the perinuclear region, partially colocalizing with NS5A at DMVs, arguing for NPC1-mediated endosomal cholesterol transport to the viral replication organelle. Consistent with cholesterol being an important structural component of DMVs, reducing NPC1-dependent endosomal cholesterol transport impaired MW integrity. This suggests that HCV usurps lipid transfer proteins, such as NPC1, at ER-late endosome/lysosome membrane contact sites to recruit cholesterol to the viral replication organelle, where it contributes to MW functionality.IMPORTANCE A key feature of the replication of positive-strand RNA viruses is the rearrangement of the host cell endomembrane system to produce a membranous replication organelle (RO). The underlying mechanisms are far from being elucidated fully. In this report, we provide evidence that HCV RNA replication depends on functional lipid transport along the endosomal-lysosomal pathway that is mediated by several lipid transfer proteins, such as the Niemann-Pick type C1 (NPC1) protein. Pharmacological inhibition of NPC1 function reduced viral replication, impaired the transport of cholesterol to the viral replication organelle, and altered organelle morphology. Besides NPC1, our study reports the importance of additional endosomal and lysosomal lipid transfer proteins required for viral replication, thus contributing to our understanding of how HCV manipulates their function in order to generate a membranous replication organelle. These results might have implications for the biogenesis of replication organelles of other positive-strand RNA viruses.
Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9), a major regulator of cholesterol homeostasis, is associated with glucose metabolism. Liraglutide, a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist, can increase insulin secretion in a glucose-dependent manner and lower blood glucose. We aimed to investigate the relationship between liraglutide and PCSK9.
At the cellular level, the expressions of PCSK9 and hepatocyte nuclear factor 1 alpha (HNF1α) protein in HepG2 cells stimulated by liraglutide was examined using Western blot. Seven-week old db/db mice and wild type (WT) mice were administered either liraglutide (200 μg/kg) or equivoluminal saline subcutaneously, twice daily for 7 weeks. Fasting glucose level, food intake and body weight were measured every week. After the 7-week treatment, the blood was collected for lipid and PCSK9 levels detection and the liver was removed from the mice for oil red O staining, immunohistochemical analysis, immunofluorescence test and Western bolt.
Firstly, liraglutide suppressed both PCSK9 and HNF1α expression in HepG2 cells in a time and concentration dependent manner. Secondly, liraglutide induced weight loss in WT and db/db mice, decreased serum PCSK9, glucose and lipid levels and improved hepatic accumulation in db/db but not WT mice. Thirdly, liraglutide reduced both hepatic PCSK9 and low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) expression with a decrease in HNF1α in db/db mice but not in WT mice.
Liraglutide suppressed PCSK9 expression through HNF1α-dependent mechanism in HepG2 cells and db/db mice, and decreased LDLR possibly via PCSK9-independent pathways in db/db mice.
Fatty liver is an increasingly serious disease of fish in aquaculture. However, the mechanisms responsible for the occurrence of fatty liver remain unclear, and no effective methods for the prevention and treatment of this disease have yet been found. In the present study, we aimed to develop an in vitro model of hepatocyte injury using oleic acid as hepatotoxicant and evaluate the protective effects of Rhizoma Alismatis extract (RAE) in Jian carp using this model. Primary hepatocytes from Jian carp were isolated and purified and cultured in vitro. The result indicated that 0.4 mmol L-1 oleic acid and 48 h could be the optimal conditions to induce hepatocyte injury model in cultured hepatocytes. Hepatocytes were exposed to oleic acid, followed by the addition of RAE at 0, 1, 5, 10, 20, or 50 μg mL-1. The hepatocytes and supernatant were then analyzed. RAE suppressed oleic acid-induced elevations in aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, triglycerides, total cholesterol, lactate dehydrogenase, alkaline phosphatase, cholinesterase, malondialdehyde, γ-glutamyl transferase, cytochrome P450 1A, cytochrome P450 2E1, liver-type fatty acid binding protein, free fatty acid, fatty acid synthetase, and tumor necrosis factor-α (P &lt; 0.01 or P &lt; 0.05); reduced protein levels of cytochrome P450 1A, nuclear factor (NF)-κB p65, and NF-κB c-Rel; and inhibited cytochrome P4503A, NF-κB c-Rel, nuclear factor erythroid-related factor 2, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-α, and cytochrome P4501A mRNA levels. In conclusion, RAE exhibited a protective effect against hepatocyte injury in Jian carp. Further in vivo studies are needed to provide more evidence for the use of RAE as a hepatoprotective agent for the treatment of hepatocyte injury.
The key lipid metabolism transcription factor sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP)-1a integrates gene regulatory effects of hormones, cytokines, nutrition and metabolites as lipids, glucose, or cholesterol via phosphorylation by different mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades. We have previously reported the impact of SREBP-1a phosphorylation on the phenotype in transgenic mouse models with liver-specific overexpression of the N-terminal transcriptional active domain of SREBP-1a (alb-SREBP-1a) or a MAPK phosphorylation site-deficient variant (alb-SREBP-1a∆P; (S63A, S117A, T426V)), respectively. In this report, we investigated the molecular basis of the systemic observations by holistic analyses of gene expression in liver and of proteome patterns in lipid-degrading organelles involved in the pathogenesis of metabolic syndrome, i.e., peroxisomes, using 2D-DIGE and mass spectrometry. The differences in hepatic gene expression and peroxisomal protein patterns were surprisingly small between the control and alb-SREBP-1a mice, although the latter develop a severe phenotype with visceral obesity and fatty liver. In contrast, phosphorylation site-deficient alb-SREBP-1a∆P mice, which are protected from fatty liver disease, showed marked differences in hepatic gene expression and peroxisomal proteome patterns. Further knowledge-based analyses revealed that disruption of SREBP-1a phosphorylation resulted in massive alteration of cellular processes, including signs for loss of targeting lipid pathways.
Trans fatty acids (TFAs) are risk factors for cardiovascular disorders, and the cancer-promoting effects of TFAs have been previously reported. The present study examined the effects and signaling of elaidic acid (EA), a TFA, in colorectal cancer (CRC) cells. Oral intake of EA was found to increase metastasis of HT29 human CRC cells. Results indicated that, in the plasma membrane, EA was integrated into cholesterol rafts, which contain epidermal growth factor receptors (EGFR). EA increased nanog and c-myc, and decreased PGC-1A through lipid raft-associated EGFR signaling in HT29 cells. Depletion of cholesterol by methyl-β-cyclodextrin treatment abrogated the EA-induced stemness and oxidative phosphorylation. Simvastatin treatment also abrogated EA-enhanced tumor growth. These results indicate that EA enhances the stemness by activating EGFR in lipid rafts.
Marine n-3 (omega-3) fatty acids alter gene expression by regulating the activity of transcription factors. Krill oil is a source of marine n-3 fatty acids that has been shown to modulate gene expression in animal studies; however, the effect in humans is not known. Hence, we aimed to compare the effect of intake of krill oil, lean and fatty fish with a similar content of n-3 fatty acids, and high-oleic sunflower oil (HOSO) with added astaxanthin on the expression of genes involved in glucose and lipid metabolism and inflammation in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) as well as circulating inflammatory markers. In an 8-week trial, healthy men and women aged 18-70 years with fasting TAG of 1·3-4·0 mmol/l were randomised to receive krill oil capsules (n 12), HOSO capsules (n 12) or lean and fatty fish (n 12). The weekly intakes of marine n-3 fatty acids from the interventions were 4654, 0 and 4103 mg, respectively. The mRNA expression of four genes, PPAR γ coactivator 1A (PPARGC1A), steaoryl-CoA desaturase (SCD), ATP binding cassette A1 (ABCA1) and cluster of differentiation 40 (CD40), were differently altered by the interventions. Furthermore, within-group analyses revealed that krill oil down-regulated the mRNA expression of thirteen genes, including genes involved in glucose and cholesterol metabolism and β-oxidation. Fish altered the mRNA expression of four genes and HOSO down-regulated sixteen genes, including several inflammation-related genes. There were no differences between the groups in circulating inflammatory markers after the intervention. In conclusion, the intake of krill oil and HOSO with added astaxanthin alter the PBMC mRNA expression of more genes than the intake of fish.
Individuals with elevated lipid levels are at risk for developing cardiovascular disease as well as cancer. Sterol regulatory element-binding protein transcription factors (SREBPs) are inducers of lipid synthesis. Elevated SREBPs levels are linked to cell proliferation and metastasis. Using biochemical and mouse models of cancer, Zhao et al. have discovered that nuclear SREBP-1a-dependent transcription is activated by pyruvate kinase M2 in cancer cells, which promotes tumor growth. Targeting the lipogenesis pathway may therefore be a promising avenue for cancer treatment.
The prevalence of infra-renal aortic abdominal aneurysms (AAA) is about 3 to 4 times higher in men, with a recommendation I 1a for screening men &gt; 65y. Althoug women only represente 20% of the total AAAs they have a significant higher rupture rate - threefold higher - and a worse outcome after ruptured AAA repair. Screening is not consensual but can be recommended for women &gt; 65y who have smoked or have a family history of AAA. Against screening is the fact that the AAA in women have not only a lower incidence but also a late presentation (&gt;80y) but references have been made to the fact that smoking became popular more than 30 years after than men and so the effects just now can start to be seen.
A retrospective review was made to all women with an infra- renal AAA who undergo a surgical treatment, elective or urgent, in the past 7 years (January 2010 - August 2017) in our hospital. Information was obtained through the clinical process. It was made an evaluation of the demographic information and anatomic features.
15 cases were reviewed, 4 elective and 11 ruptured surgical repairs. The mean age was 74 and only 4 women were more than 80 years old, with a minium age of 57. More than half the patients were previously diagnosis with hypertension but only 30% had high cholesterol. Only one was a known smoker. None had a diagnosis of cardiac disease. One had a sintomatic cerebrovascular disease. Within the elective cases, all open repair, the intra-hospitalar mortality was zero with a mean stay of 7,5 days. The ruptured cases, 1 endovascular, had a perioperative mortality of 50% The mean aortic diametre at rupture was less than 6 cm.
Data supports the evidence of the morbidity of a ruptured AAA and the high intra-hospitalar mortality in women. Early detection and elective repair should be considered. Sex-specific research is needed to provide the best medical treatment.
Sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP)-1a is a key transcription factor that activates the expression of genes involved in the synthesis of fatty acids, triglycerides (TGs), and cholesterol. Transgenic mice that overexpress the nuclear form of SREBP-1a under the control of the phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase promoter (Tg-1a) were previously shown to display a lipodystrophic phenotype characterized by enlarged and fatty livers, diminished peripheral white adipose tissue (WAT), and insulin resistance. In the current study, we crossed these Tg-1a mice with genetically obese (ob/ob) mice (Tg-1a;ob/ob) and examined change in fat distribution between liver and adipose tissues in severe obesity and mechanism underlying the lipodystrophic phenotype in mice with Tg-1a. Tg-1a;ob/ob mice developed more severe steatohepatitis but had reduced WAT mass and body weight compared with ob/ob mice. The reduction of WAT mass in Tg-1a and Tg-1a;ob/ob mice was accompanied by enhanced lipogenesis and lipid uptake in the liver, reduced plasma lipid levels, impaired adipocyte differentiation, reduced food intake, enhanced energy expenditure, and extended macrophage infiltration and fibrosis in WAT. Despite the improved glucose tolerance, Tg-1a;ob/ob mice showed severe peripheral insulin resistance. Adenoviral hepatic expression of SREBP-1a mimicked these phenotypes. The "fat steal"-like lipodystrophy phenotype of the Tg-1a;ob/ob model demonstrates that hepatic SREBP-1a activation has a strong impact on the partition of TG accumulation, resulting in adipose-tissue remodeling by inflammation and fibrosis and insulin resistance.
Sphingomyelin- and cholesterol- enriched membrane domains, commonly referred to as "rafts" play a crucial role in a large number of intra- and intercellular processes. Recent experiments suggest that not only the volumetric inhomogeneity of lipid distribution in rafts, but also the arrangement of the 1D boundary between the raft and the surrounding membrane is important for the membrane-associated processes. The reason is that the boundary preferentially recruits different peptides, such as HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) fusion peptide. In the present work, we report a theoretical investigation of mechanisms of influence of the raft boundary arrangement upon virus-induced membrane fusion. We theoretically predict that the raft boundary can act as an attractor for viral fusion peptides, which preferentially distribute into the vicinity of the boundary, playing the role of 'line active components' of the membrane ('linactants'). We have calculated the height of the fusion energy barrier and demonstrated that, in the case of fusion between HIV membrane and the target cell, presence of the raft boundary in the vicinity of the fusion site facilitates fusion. The results we obtained can be further generalized to be applicable to other enveloped viruses.
The anti-hypercholesterolemic effect of berbamine (BBM) isolated from Rhizoma Coptidis (RC) was investigated in hypercholesterolemic zebrafish model induced by high-cholesterol (HC) diet. Zebrafish embryo assay revealed no significant difference in morphology and cell death with the treatment of BBM less than 20 μg/mL. In zebrafish larvae, the fluorescently labeled cholesterol in caudal artery was reduced dose-dependently after BBM treatment. For adult zebrafish, administration of 0.2% BBM exhibited a significant decrease in plasma total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c) levels by 37%, 38% and 28%, respectively, along with a fall in lipid content in liver. Further investigation suggested that the mRNA expression of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (HMGCR) and microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP) in liver were down-regulated and the transcription levels of liver gene low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) and cytochrome P450 polypeptide 1a of subfamily A of family 7 (CYP7A1a) were significantly up-regulated with BBM treatment. Histological study showed that BBM can alleviate hepatic steatosis induced by HC diet. These data suggested that BBM has anti-hypercholesterolemic and hepatoprotective effects. The mechanism probably related to the up-regulation of cholesterol transport and bile acid synthesis as well as inhibition of cholesterol synthesis and lipoprotein assembly or secretion.
This is a case report of a 38-year-old Syrian refugee male with early-onset extensive atherosclerosis. The physical and laboratory examination were remarkable with severe xanthomas in the upper and lower extremities and with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) 417 mg/dL, total cholesterol 495 mg/dL, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol 30 mg/dL, and triglycerides 242 mg/dL. LDL-C level responded poorly to the high-dose statin treatment. The genetic analysis indicated that the patient had a large homozygous deletion in LDL receptor gene including the exons 7-14. A 12-kb deletion had occurred between the 2 Alu repetitive sequences that were oriented in opposite directions, one in intron 6 and the other in intron 14. This deletion eliminated exons 7-14, which exactly corresponded to the entire exon sequence coding the epidermal growth factor precursor homology domain. This deletion in LDL receptor was previously reported. This rare case of homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia presenting with multiple large and widely distributed xanthomas implicates the need for novel treatment options in familial hypercholesterolemia patients. The case is a Syrian refugee and emphasizes the urgent need to address orphan disease in refugee populations throughout the world.
Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), i.e. indomethacin used for rheumatoid arthritis and non-rheumatoid inflammatory diseases, are known for their injurious actions on the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Mucosal damage can be avoided by using nanoscale systems composed by a combination of liposomes and biodegradable natural polymer, i.e. chitosan, for enhancing drug activity. Aim of this study was to prepare chitosan-lipid hybrid delivery systems for indomethacin dosage through a novel continuous method based on microfluidic principles. The drop-wise conventional method was also applied in order to investigate the effect of the two polymeric coverage processes on the nanostructures features and their interactions with indomethacin. Thermal-physical properties, mucoadhesiveness, drug entrapment efficiency, in vitro release behavior in simulated GI fluids and stability in stocking conditions were assayed and compared, respectively, for the uncoated and chitosan-coated nanoliposomes prepared by the two introduced methods. The prepared chitosan-lipid hybrid structures, with nanometric size, have shown high indomethacin loading (about 10%) and drug encapsulation efficiency up to 99%. TEM investigation has highlighted that the developed novel simil-microfluidic method is able to put a polymeric layer, surrounding indomethacin loaded nanoliposomes, thicker and smoother than that achievable by the drop-wise method, improving their storage stability. Finally, double pH tests have confirmed that the chitosan-lipid hybrid nanostructures have a gastro retentive behavior in simulated gastric and intestinal fluids thus can be used as delivery systems for the oral-controlled release of indomethacin. Based on the present results, the simil-microfluidic method, working with large volumes, in a rapid manner, without the use of drastic conditions and with a precise control over the covering process, seems to be the most promising method for the production of suitable indomethacin delivery system, with a great potential in industrial manufacturing.
Cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy (CAN) is a well known prognostic marker in diabetes. A large angle between the QRS- and the T-wave vector (QRS-T angle) in the electrocardiogram (ECG) has recently been introduced as another marker of poor prognosis.
To assess and compare the long-term predictive power of the frontal plane QRS-T angle with CAN in people with diabetes.
In 1992-93 people with diabetes in the municipality of Horsens, Denmark, were identified by the prescription method andan age and gender stratified sample of 240 individuals with diabetes were randomly selected. The presence of CAN was defined using the heart rate response to Valsalva manoeuvre. The QRS-T angle was read using the method described by Gandhi. In July 2015 vital statistics were obtained fromthe Danish Civil Registration System.
178 individuals accepted to participate in the study, of which 153 (86%) completed the Valsalva manoeuvre and had sinus rhythm. Total observation time was 21.5 (0.18) years, in which 99 (65%) individuals died. An elevated QRS-T angle and the presence of cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy were both found to be significant predictors of death. In Cox regression analyses, adjusting for the effect of gender, age, duration of diabetes, BMI, total-cholesterol, diabetes type, haemoglobin A1c, smoking status, hypertension and previous MI, an independent prognostic value was found for the QRS-T angle as well as the Valsalva ratio.
A large QRS-T angle and the presence of cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy are both strong and independent long-term predictors of all-cause mortality in people with diabetes.
Healthy eating is a critical aspect of the prevention and management of type 2 diabetes (T2DM). Disrupted eating patterns can result in poor glucose control and increase the likelihood of diabetic complications. Teneligliptin inhibits dipeptidyl peptidase-4 activity for 24 h and suppresses postprandial hyperglycemia after all three daily meals. This interim analysis of data from the large-scale post-marketing surveillance of teneligliptin (RUBY) in Japan examined eating patterns and their relationship with metabolic parameters and diabetic complications. We also examined whether eating patterns affected safety and efficacy of teneligliptin.
We analyzed baseline data from survey forms collected in RUBY between May 2013 and June 2017, including patient characteristics, metabolic parameters, and eating patterns (eating three meals per day or not; timing of evening meal) before teneligliptin treatment was initiated. Safety and efficacy of 12 months' teneligliptin (20-40 mg/day) treatment was assessed.
Data from 10,532 patients were available for analysis. Most patients who did not eat three meals per day (n  =757) or who ate their evening meal after 10 PM (n  =206) were 64 years old or younger. At baseline, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), fasting blood glucose, triglycerides, total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, body mass index, alanine aminotransferase, and aspartate aminotransferase levels were higher in those patients who did not eat three meals per day (p &lt; 0.05) or who ate their evening meal late (p &lt; 0.05). Diabetic complications were more common in patients who did not eat three meals per day. Treatment with teneligliptin reduced HbA1c over 6 or 12 months across all eating patterns, with a low incidence of adverse drug reactions.
Eating patterns may be associated with altered metabolic parameters and diabetic complications among Japanese patients with T2DM. Teneligliptin may be well tolerated and improve hyperglycemia in patients with T2DM irrespective of eating patterns.

Standard approaches for large scale phenotypic screens using electronic health record (EHR) data apply thresholds, such as ≥2 diagnosis codes, to define subjects as having a phenotype. However, the variation in the accuracy of diagnosis codes can impair the power of such screens. Our objective was to develop and evaluate an approach which converts diagnosis codes into a probability of a phenotype (PheProb). We hypothesized that this alternate approach for defining phenotypes would improve power for genetic association studies.
The PheProb approach employs unsupervised clustering to separate patients into 2 groups based on diagnosis codes. Subjects are assigned a probability of having the phenotype based on the number of diagnosis codes. This approach was developed using simulated EHR data and tested in a real world EHR cohort. In the latter, we tested the association between low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) genetic risk alleles known for association with hyperlipidemia and hyperlipidemia codes (ICD-9 272.x). PheProb and thresholding approaches were compared.
Among n = 1462 subjects in the real world EHR cohort, the threshold-based p-values for association between the genetic risk score (GRS) and hyperlipidemia were 0.126 (≥1 code), 0.123 (≥2 codes), and 0.142 (≥3 codes). The PheProb approach produced the expected significant association between the GRS and hyperlipidemia: p = .001.
PheProb improves statistical power for association studies relative to standard thresholding approaches by leveraging information about the phenotype in the billing code counts. The PheProb approach has direct applications where efficient approaches are required, such as in Phenome-Wide Association Studies.
Low and high birthweight is known to increase the risk of acute and longer-term adverse outcomes, such as stillbirth, infant mortality, obesity, type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. Gestational dyslipidaemia is associated with a numbers of adverse birth outcomes, but evidence regarding birthweight is still inconsistent to reliably inform clinical practice and treatment recommendations.
The aim of this study was to explore the relationship between maternal gestational dyslipidaemia and neonatal health outcomes, namely, birthweight, metabolic factors and inflammatory parameters.
We searched systematically Embase, MEDLINE, PubMed, CINAHL Plus and Cochrane Library up to 1 August 2016 (with an updated search in MEDLINE at the end of July 2017) for longitudinal studies that assessed the association of maternal lipid levels during pregnancy with neonatal birthweight, or metabolic and inflammatory parameters up to 3 years old.
Data from 46 publications including 31,402 pregnancies suggest that maternal high triglycerides and low high-density-lipoprotein cholesterol levels throughout pregnancy are associated with increased birthweight, higher risk of large for gestational age and macrosomia and lower risk of small-for-gestational age. The findings were consistent across the studied populations, but stronger associations were observed in women who were overweight or obese prior to pregnancy.
This meta-analysis suggested that the potential under-recognized adverse effects of intrauterine exposure to maternal dyslipidaemia may warrant further investigation into the relationship between maternal dyslipidaemia and birthweight in large prospective cohorts or in randomized trials.
Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is the most frequent autosomal codominant disease worldwide and is characterized by elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and premature coronary artery disease (CAD). Polymorphisms in phosphatase and actin regulator 1 (PHACTR1) have been shown to be associated with cardiovascular risk in large genome-wide association studies studies.
The aim of the present study is to evaluate the association between the rs12526453 polymorphism in the PHACTR1 gene and the prevalence of CAD in FH patients.
A cohort of 668 adult genetically confirmed heterozygous FH subjects were included in the present study. Logistic regression models were used to evaluate the strength of the association between rs12526453 genotype and CAD prevalence.
Noncarriers (CC) of the rs12526453 represented 41% of the cohort, whereas heterozygous (CG) and homozygous (GG) carriers represented 44% and 15%, respectively. The prevalence of CAD was significantly higher in non-carriers of the rs12526453 polymorphism compared to heterozygous and homozygous carriers (38.0%, 25.8%, 24.5%, respectively, P = .001). When a dominant logistic regression model was studied, the association between this single-nucleotide polymorphism and CAD prevalence was significant even after correction for all classical cardiovascular risk factors (odds ratio 0.48, 95% confidence intervals 0.31-0.74, P = .001).
In the present study, we have shown that the rs12526453 single-nucleotide polymorphism of the PHACTR1 gene is significantly associated with a 50% reduction in the odds of CAD events in FH subjects. Because the protective G allele is frequent in the Caucasian population (allelic frequency of 0.26), screening for this polymorphism in Caucasian FH subjects could further help to stratify risk of CAD in this population.
Lipid accumulation product (LAP), a simple and low-cost tool, is a novel biomarker of central lipid accumulation and represents a potential surrogate marker for atherogenic lipoprotein profile. However, its association with lipoprotein subfractions has not been described in the literature.
To determine whether LAP index could be used as a marker of low- and high-density lipoprotein (LDL and HDL) size in Brazilian individuals.
This cross-sectional study included patients (n = 351) of both sexes and age between 30-74 years. Clinical and sociodemographic data and family history of diseases were evaluated. Lipoprotein size, and levels of total cholesterol (TC), lipoproteins, apolipoprotein AI and B (APO AI/APO B), glucose, insulin, insulin resistance index (HOMA-IR) and non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA) were assessed in blood samples. LAP was calculated by the formulas [(waist circumference[cm]-58) × (triglycerides[mmol/L]) for women and (waist circumference [cm]-65) × (triglycerides [mmol/L]) for men]. The association between LAP and metabolic parameters were tested by linear trend (general linear model, GLM test) before and after multiple adjustments for potential confounders (sex, age, smoking, statin, fibrate, and hypoglycemic drugs) at significant level p &lt; 0.05.
LAP was positively associated with TC, APO B, NEFA, glucose, insulin and HOMA-IR values, and negatively associated with HDL-C. Higher central lipid accumulation was corelated with higher percentage of intermediate HDL and of small LDL and HDL and less amount of large HDL. LDL size was also reduced in greater LAP index values. The negative impact of LAP was maintained after adjustment for multiple variables.
LAP was robustly associated with atherogenic profile of lipoprotein subfractions, independently of multiple confounders.
The effect of cholesterol on membrane dipole potential has been the subject of a great number of experimental and theoretical investigations, but these studies have yielded different findings and interpretations at high cholesterol concentrations. This suggests that the underlying mechanism of the cholesterol effect is not well addressed. Moreover, as far as we know, none of the previously proposed coarse-grained (CG) models (including MARTINI and its improved versions) has been successfully used to probe the effect of cholesterol on membrane dipole potential, owing to either an inaccurate description of water-cholesterol electrostatics or the neglect of the contribution of cholesterol to membrane dipole potential. In our previous works, we proposed a CG model CAVS (charge attached to virtual site) for lipid and water, showing the advantage of the CAVS model in the calculations of membrane dipole potential as compared to the MARTINI model. In this work, we present the CAVS model for cholesterol in order to enable us to investigate the effect of cholesterol on membrane dipole potential at large spatial scale. Our works showed that the CAVS and CHARMM models produced similar results in the study of the effects of cholesterol on lipid bilayer structures and membrane dipole potential. In particular, by combining the CHARMM and CAVS simulations, we explicitly calculated the individual contributions of membrane components (cholesterol, water, and lipid) to membrane dipole potential at different cholesterol concentrations, and we discovered that an increase in cholesterol content would result in a non-linear variation of the individual contributions of water and lipid with cholesterol concentration. On the other side, we observed that the individual contribution of cholesterol to membrane dipole potential would non-linearly increase with increasing cholesterol concentration. Thus, the effect of cholesterol on membrane dipole potential is complicated owing to the different variation of individual contributions of membrane components (water, lipid, and cholesterol) with cholesterol concentration.
We selected twenty genes from the "Top Results" list on the AlzGene database website and assessed their association with risk of developing Alzheimer's disease (AD) in a large, genome-wide association study (using 526 SNPs from 2,032 AD cases and 5,328 controls) performed in France. The APOE, CLU, PICALM, and CR1 loci were excluded, since they had already been extensively analyzed. Ten genes/loci (TFAM, SORL1, CHRNB2, SORCS1, DAPK1, MTHFR, GWA 14q32.13, BDNF, NEDD9, and CH25H) showed weak nominal association with AD risk, in line with previous studies. In the remaining ten genes/loci (TNK1, ACE, CST3, IL1B, hCG2039140, PRNP, GAB2, LOC651924, IL1A, and TF), no single nucleotide polymorphisms were associated in our dataset. Of the genes showing nominal association in our cohorts, TFAM and CHRNB2 appear particularly interesting and warrant further genetic and functional follow-up analyses.
The genetics of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is heterogeneous and remains only ill-defined. We have recently created a freely available and continuously updated online database (AlzGene; http://www.alzgene.org ) for which we collect all published genetic association studies in AD and perform systematic meta-analyses on all polymorphisms with sufficient genotype data. In this study, we tested 27 genes (ACE, BDNF, CH25H, CHRNB2, CST3, CTSD, DAPK1, GALP, hCG2039140, IL1B, LMNA, LOC439999, LOC651924, MAPT, MTHFR, MYH13, PCK1, PGBD1, PRNP, PSEN1, SORCS1, SORL1, TF, TFAM, TNK1, GWA_14q32.13, and GWA_7p15.2), all showing significant association with AD risk in the AlzGene meta-analyses, in a large collection of family-based samples comprised of 4,180 subjects from over 1,300 pedigrees. Overall, we observe significant association with risk for AD and polymorphisms in ACE, CHRNB2, TF, and an as yet uncharacterized locus on chromosome 7p15.2 [rs1859849]. For all four loci, the association was observed with the same alleles as in the AlzGene meta-analyses. The convergence of case-control and family-based findings suggests that these loci currently represent the most promising AD gene candidates. Further fine-mapping and functional analyses are warranted to elucidate the potential biochemical mechanisms and epidemiological relevance of these genes.
The host-pathogen interactions between the Pacific oyster (Crassostrea gigas) and Ostreid herpesvirus type 1 (OsHV-1) are poorly characterised. Herpesviruses are a group of large, DNA viruses that are known to encode gene products that subvert their host's antiviral response. It is likely that OsHV-1 has also evolved similar strategies as its genome encodes genes with high homology to C. gigas inhibitors of apoptosis (IAPs) and an interferon-stimulated gene (termed CH25H). The first objective of this study was to simultaneously investigate the expression of C. gigas and OsHV-1 genes that share high sequence homology during an acute infection. Comparison of apoptosis-related genes revealed that components of the extrinsic apoptosis pathway (TNF) were induced in response to OsHV-1 infection, but we failed to observe evidence of apoptosis using a combination of biochemical and molecular assays. IAPs encoded by OsHV-1 were highly expressed during the acute stage of infection and may explain why we didn't observe evidence of apoptosis. However, C. gigas must have an alternative mechanism to apoptosis for clearing OsHV-1 from infected gill cells as we observed a reduction in viral DNA between 27 and 54 h post-infection. The reduction of viral DNA in C. gigas gill cells occurred after the up-regulation of interferon-stimulated genes (viperin, PKR, ADAR). In a second objective, we manipulated the host's anti-viral response by injecting C. gigas with a small dose of poly I:C at the time of OsHV-1 infection. This small dose of poly I:C was unable to induce transcription of known antiviral effectors (ISGs), but these oysters were still capable of inhibiting OsHV-1 replication. This result suggests dsRNA induces an anti-viral response that is additional to the IFN-like pathway.
During first merogony Eimeria bovis forms large macromeronts in endothelial host cells containing &gt;120 000 merozoites I. During multiplication, large amounts of cholesterol are indispensable for the enormous offspring membrane production. Cholesterol auxotrophy was proven for other apicomplexan parasites. Consequently they scavenge cholesterol from their host cell apparently in a parasite-specific manner. We here analyzed the influence of E. bovis infection on endothelial host cell cholesterol metabolism and found considerable differences to other coccidian parasites. Overall, free cholesterol significantly accumulated in E. bovis infected host cells. Furthermore, a striking increase of lipid droplet formation was observed within immature macromeronts. Artificial host cell lipid droplet enrichment significantly improved E. bovis merozoite I production confirming the key role of lipid droplet contents for optimal parasite proliferation. The transcription of several genes being involved in both, cholesterol de novo biosynthesis and low density lipoprotein-(LDL) mediated uptake, was significantly up-regulated at a time in infected cells suggesting a simultaneous exploitation of these two cholesterol acquisition pathways. E. bovis scavenges LDL-derived cholesterol apparently through significantly increased levels of surface LDL receptor abundance and LDL binding to infected cells. Consequently, LDL supplementation significantly improved parasite replication. The up-regulation of the oxidized LDL receptor 1 furthermore identified this scavenger receptor as a key molecule in parasite-triggered LDL uptake. Moreover, cellular cholesterol processing was altered in infected cells as indicated by up-regulation of cholesterol-25-hydroxylase and sterol O-acyltransferase. Overall, these results show that E. bovis considerably exploits the host cell cholesterol metabolism to guarantee its massive intracellular growth and replication. 
The oxysterol 25-hydroxycholesterol is a widely used compound displaying an array of pharmacological actions in in vitro systems and cell based experimental systems. In spite of the frequent use of this compound over the last few decades and a large number of studies in vitro and in vivo, its mechanism of formation in vivo is still not well understood. Cholesterol autoxidation does not seem to be an important contributor to in vivo formation of 25-hydroxycholesterol. A number of different cytochrome P450 enzymes such as CYP27A1 and CYP3A4 have been reported to catalyze the conversion of cholesterol to 25-hydroxycholesterol in vitro, but the importance of these reactions in vivo remains unclear. The dioxygenase enzyme cholesterol 25-hydroxylase has been shown to generate 25-hydroxycholesterol, but in cholesterol 25-hydroxylase knockout mice there are still significant levels of 25-hydroxycholesterol in several tissues. This suggests that cholesterol 25-hydroxylase is not the sole producer of 25-hydroxycholesterol. The relative importance of different mechanisms of formation of 25-hydroxycholesterol in vivo have still to be elucidated. The maintenance of cholesterol homeostasis is of great importance to supply tissues with the appropriate amount of cholesterol and prevent accumulation that may affect health. Numerous articles mention 25-hydroxycholesterol as an important regulator of cholesterol metabolism. However, mice with a disruption of the cholesterol 25-hydroxylase gene regulate cholesterol metabolism normally and patients with highly elevated levels of 25-hydroxycholesterol also display normal cholesterol and bile acid levels. These reports challenge the hypothesis that 25-hydroxycholesterol is an important regulator of cholesterol metabolism. Recent reports suggest that 25-hydroxycholesterol and one of its metabolites may have functions in regulation of humoral immunity. Thus, 25-hydroxycholesterol may be more important as a regulator of immunity than as a regulator of cholesterol metabolism.
Understanding the genetic basis of phenotypic diversity is a challenge in contemporary biology. Domestication provides a model for unravelling aspects of the genetic basis of stress sensitivity. The ancestral Red Junglefowl (RJF) exhibits greater fear-related behaviour and a more pronounced HPA-axis reactivity than its domesticated counterpart, the White Leghorn (WL). By comparing hormones (plasmatic) and adrenal global gene transcription profiles between WL and RJF in response to an acute stress event, we investigated the molecular basis for the altered physiological stress responsiveness in domesticated chickens. Basal levels of pregnenolone and dehydroepiandrosterone as well as corticosterone response were lower in WL. Microarray analysis of gene expression in adrenal glands showed a significant breed effect in a large number of transcripts with over-representation of genes in the channel activity pathway. The expression of the best-known steroidogenesis genes were similar across the breeds used. Transcription levels of acute stress response genes such as StAR, CH25 and POMC were upregulated in response to acute stress. Dampened HPA reactivity in domesticated chickens was associated with changes in the expression of several genes that presents potentially minor regulatory effects rather than by means of change in expression of critical steroidogenic genes in the adrenal. 
In this study, alterations in lipid metabolism associated with acute aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) induced hepatotoxicity and gene expression changes underlying these effects were investigated. Rats were orally administered three doses (0.25 mg/kg, 0.5 mg/kg and 1.0 mg/kg) of AFB1 for seven days; after which blood was collected and liver excised. Lipid profiles of plasma and liver were determined spectrophotometrically while the expression of genes associated with lipid and lipoprotein metabolism was assayed by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. Acute exposure to AFB1 increased the levels of plasma and liver cholesterol, triglycerides and phospholipids. AFB1 at 0.5 mg/kg and 1.0 mg/kg resulted in a dose-dependent (1.2 and 1.5 fold, respectively) downregulation of hepatic Cpt1a with a concomitant 1.2 and 1.5 fold increase in the level of plasma FFA, respectively. A similar observation of 1.2 and 1.3 fold increase was also observed in plasma triglyceride concentration, at both respective doses. AFB1 also decreased the relative expression of Ahr, Lipc and Lcat whereas, it upregulated Scarb1 in a dose dependent manner. AFB1-induced dysregulation of the expression of lipid and lipoprotein metabolizing genes may be one mechanism linking AFB1 to altered lipid metabolism and ultimately risk for coronary heart disease.
Dietary phospholipid (PL) supplementation has been shown to reduce lipid accumulation in the tissues of farmed fish; however, the mechanisms underlying this effect are largely unknown. Thus, the present study was conducted to evaluate the potential impacts of PL on hepatic lipid metabolism both in vivo and in vitro. For in vivo study, four experimental diets - low lipid and low PL diet, as control diet (LL-LP diet, containing 12 % lipid and 1·5 % PL), low-lipid and high-PL diet (containing 12 % lipid and 8 % PL), high-lipid and low-PL diet (HL-LP diet, containing 20 % lipid and 1·5 % PL) and high-lipid and high-PL diet (HL-HP diet, containing 20 % lipid and 8 % PL) - were randomly allocated to four groups of large yellow croaker (Larimichthys crocea) (three cages per group) with similar initial body weight (approximately 8 g). For in vitro study, primary hepatocytes isolated from large yellow croaker were incubated either with graded levels of phosphatidylcholine (PC) (0-250 μm) or small interfering RNA (siRNA) for CTP: choline phosphate cytidylyltranferase α (CCTα) (siRNA-CCTα). Results showed that survival was independent of dietary treatments (P&gt;0·05). Weight gain and feed efficiency in the HL-HP group were significantly higher than in the LL-LP and HL-LP groups (P&lt;0·05). High level of dietary PL could markedly reduce abnormal hepatic lipid accumulation induced by the HL-LP diet (P&lt;0·05). Similarly, compared with the corresponding controls, a significant decrease/increase in lipid content was observed in primary hepatocytes incubated with PC/siRNA-CCTα (P&lt;0·05). High level of dietary PL reversed the HL-LP diet-induced increased levels of mRNA of fatty acid uptake and lipid synthesis related genes (P&lt;0·05). In addition, High level of dietary PL markedly down-regulated the transcript levels of fatty acid oxidation-related genes and enhanced the transcript levels of VLDL assembly-related genes regardless of dietary lipid levels (P&lt;0·05). Compared with corresponding controls, primary hepatocytes treated with PC showed significantly higher mRNA expression of lipid synthesis and VLDL assembly-related genes and lower mRNA expression of fatty acid oxidation-related genes, with hepatocytes treated with siRNA-CCTα exhibiting the opposite trend (P&lt;0·05). In summary, these results demonstrated that high level of dietary PL might reverse the HL-LP diet-induced abnormal lipid accumulation in the liver through inhibiting fatty acid uptake and lipid synthesis, together with promoting the lipid export at the transcriptional level. Lipid export-promoting effect of PC was confirmed by in vitro studies. The present study showed for the first time that PL or PC could influence various metabolic pathways to regulate hepatic lipid deposition in fish at least at the transcriptional level.
Numerous histiocytes are sometimes noted in glomeruli, giving rise to a foamy-appearing glomerulus. Foamy-appearing glomeruli may also be noted in conditions that do not contain numerous histiocytes. These disease entities are rare, have different underlying causes and pathophysiology, and can cause a diagnostic dilemma. We have observed this histiocytic/foamy glomerular change on the kidney biopsy specimen in 5 different disease entities: crystal-storing histiocytosis, histiocytic glomerulopathy associated with macrophage-activating syndrome, thrombotic microangiopathy, lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase deficiency, and lipoprotein glomerulopathy. We describe and compare the kidney biopsy findings of these histiocytic and foamy-appearing entities. It is important to recognize the kidney biopsy findings of these rare conditions to correctly evaluate and identify the cause and manage these patients. 
Apolipoprotein A-I is the main protein of high-density lipoprotein particles, and is encoded by the APOA1 gene. Several APOA1 mutations have been found, either affecting the lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase activity, determining familial HDL deficiency, or resulting in amyloid formation with prevalent deposits in the kidney and liver. Evaluation of familial tubulointerstitial nephritis in patients with the Leu75Pro APOA-I amyloidosis mutation resulted in the identification of 253 carriers belonging to 50 families from Brescia, Italy. A total of 219 mutation carriers underwent clinical, laboratory, and instrumental tests. Of these, 62% had renal, hepatic, and testicular disease; 38% were asymptomatic. The disease showed an age-dependent penetrance. Tubulointerstitial nephritis was diagnosed in 49% of the carriers, 13% of whom progressed to kidney failure requiring dialysis. Hepatic involvement with elevation of cholestasis indices was diagnosed in 30% of the carriers, 38% of whom developed portal hypertension. Impaired spermatogenesis and hypogonadism was found in 68% of male carriers. The cholesterol levels were lower than normal in 80% of the mutation carriers. Thus, tubulointerstitial nephritis was highly prevalent in this large series of patients with Leu75Pro apoA-I amyloidosis. Persistent elevation of alkaline phosphatase, reduced HDL cholesterol plasma levels, and hypogonadism in men are key diagnostic features of this form of amyloidosis. 
Lipidoses occur for an abnormal storage parenchymal deposition of lipids and products of their metabolism in large amounts or sometimes, involving only some particular tissue structures. The lipid storage is usually due to an inborn error causing an enzyme absence /deficiency in the primary lipidoses and to a complex metabolism alterations in the secondary forms. However, histologically all lipid depositions look very similar, and immunohistochemical investigation, clinical pictures knowledge and genetic tests need to make a correct diagnosis. Lipid deposition causes parenchymal structural changes especially of glomeruli resulting in renal function impairment and proteinuria and haematuria appearance. This manuscript gathers clinical and histological features present in these storage pathologies. Renal involvement is described in Anderson-Fabry disease, in hyperlipoproteinemias, in lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase deficiency, in Gaucher disease and finally in secondary lipidoses features such as nephrotic syndrome, Alagille disease, and toxic or ischemic renal damage. Recently the replacement enzymatic therapy availability is substantially modifying the clinical picture and the outcome in some lipidoses such as Anderson-Fabry and Gaucher diseases. Therefore, it is import to be aware of these disorders, not only for making a correct diagnosis but also for starting, when it is possible, an effective therapy.
Corn silk (CS) extract contains large amounts of maysin, which is a major flavonoid in CS. However, studies regarding the effect of CS extract on cholesterol metabolism is limited. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to determine the effect of CS extract on cholesterol metabolism in C57BL/6J mouse fed high-fat diets.
Normal-fat group fed 7% fat diet, high-fat (HF) group fed 25% fat diet, and high-fat with corn silk (HFCS) group were orally administered CS extract (100 mg/kg body weight) daily. Serum and hepatic levels of total lipids, triglycerides, and total cholesterol as well as serum free fatty acid, glucose, and insulin levels were determined. The mRNA expression levels of acyl-CoA: cholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT), cholesterol 7-alpha hydroxylase (CYP7A1), farnesoid X receptor (FXR), lecithin cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT), low-density lipoprotein receptor, 3-hyroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (HMG-CoA reductase), adiponectin, leptin, and tumor necrosis factor α were determined.
Oral administration of CS extract with HF improved serum glucose and insulin levels as well as attenuated HF-induced fatty liver. CS extracts significantly elevated mRNA expression levels of adipocytokines and reduced mRNA expression levels of HMG-CoA reductase, ACAT, and FXR. The mRNA expression levels of CYP7A1 and LCAT between the HF group and HFCS group were not statistically different.
CS extract supplementation with a high-fat diet improves levels of adipocytokine secretion and glucose homeostasis. CS extract is also effective in decreasing the regulatory pool of hepatic cholesterol, in line with decreased blood and hepatic levels of cholesterol though modulation of mRNA expression levels of HMG-CoA reductase, ACAT, and FXR.
Psoriasis is a systemic inflammatory disease associated with increased cardiovascular (CV) risk and altered lipid metabolism. Tofacitinib is an oral Janus kinase inhibitor.
The aim of the study was to investigate the effects of tofacitinib on traditional and nontraditional lipid parameters and CV risk markers in patients with psoriasis from a phase III study, OPT Pivotal 1.
Patients with psoriasis were randomized to tofacitinib 5 or 10 mg twice daily (BID) or placebo BID. Serum samples were collected at baseline, week 4, and week 16. Analyses included serum cholesterol levels, triglycerides, lipoproteins, lipid particles, lipid-related parameters/CV risk markers, and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) function analyses.
At week 16, small concurrent increases in mean low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and HDL cholesterol (HDL-C) levels were observed with tofacitinib; total cholesterol/HDL-C ratio did not change. There was no significant change in the number of small dense LDL particles, which are considered to be more atherogenic than large particles, and oxidized LDL did not increase. Paraoxonase 1 activity, linked to HDL antioxidant capacity, increased, and HDL-associated serum amyloid A, which reduces the anti-atherogenic potential of HDL, decreased. HDL capacity to promote cholesterol efflux from macrophages did not change. Lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase activity, which is associated with reverse cholesterol transport, increased. Markers of systemic inflammation, serum amyloid A and C-reactive protein, decreased with tofacitinib.
While small increases in lipid levels are observed with tofacitinib treatment in patients with psoriasis, effects on selected lipid-related parameters and other circulating CV risk biomarkers are not suggestive of an increased CV risk [NCT01276639].
Background: HDL function may be more important than HDL concentration in determining risk for cardiovascular disease. In addition, HDL is a carrier of carotenoids and antioxidant enzymes, which protect HDL and LDL particles against oxidation.Objective: The goal of this study was to determine the impact of consuming 0-3 eggs/d on LDL and HDL particle size, HDL function, and plasma antioxidants in a young, healthy population.Methods: Thirty-eight healthy men and women [age 18-30 y, body mass index (in kg/m2) 18.5-29.9] participated in this 14-wk crossover intervention. Subjects underwent a 2-wk washout (0 eggs/d) followed by sequentially increasing intake of 1, 2, and 3 eggs/d for 4 wk each. After each period, fasting blood was collected for analysis of lipoprotein subfractions, plasma apolipoprotein (apo) concentration, lutein and zeaxanthin concentration, and activities of lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase, cholesteryl ester transfer protein, and paraoxonase-1.Results: Compared with intake of 0 eggs/d, consuming 1-3 eggs/d resulted in increased large-LDL (21-37%) and large-HDL (6-13%) particle concentrations, plasma apoAI (9-15%), and lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase activity (5-15%) (P &lt; 0.05 for all biomarkers). Intake of 2-3 eggs/d also promoted an 11% increase in apoAII (P &lt; 0.05) and a 20-31% increase in plasma lutein and zeaxanthin (P &lt; 0.05), whereas intake of 3 eggs/d resulted in a 9-16% increase in serum paraoxonase-1 activity compared with intake of 1-2 eggs/d (P &lt; 0.05). Egg intake did not affect cholesteryl ester transfer protein activity.Conclusions: Intake of 1 egg/d was sufficient to increase HDL function and large-LDL particle concentration; however, intake of 2-3 eggs/d supported greater improvements in HDL function as well as increased plasma carotenoids. Overall, intake of ≤3 eggs/d favored a less atherogenic LDL particle profile, improved HDL function, and increased plasma antioxidants in young, healthy adults. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT02531958.
Recent studies showed that atherosclerosis is a lysosomal storage disease (LSD) and Niemann-Pick disease type C1 (NPC1) is the most important protein of the lysosomal membrane that is involved in the removal of FC from lysosomes. Whereas several in vitro and in vivo studies have described the crosstalk between lysosomal cholesterol accumulation and increased inflammation, there is no study addressing the correlation between NPC1 gene expression and an anti-inflammatory cytokine, interleukin 10 (IL-10) serum concentration in atherosclerotic patients.
IL-10 and 25-hydroxyvitamin D serum concentrations were quantified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in atherosclerotic patients (n = 40) and a control group (n = 40). NPC1 gene expression analysis was performed by quantitative real-time PCR, and correlation between the two parameters was assessed.
Mean IL-10 serum concentration and peripheral blood mononuclear cells' (PBMCs) gene expression of NPC1, adjusted for drug consumption, age, and BMI, was not significantly different between the patient and control groups (p = 0.6 and 0.67 respectively). However, NPC1 gene expression showed positive significant correlation with IL-10 serum concentration (p = 0.04, r = 0.29). We also observed lower serum concentration of IL-10 in the subjects with lower 25-hydroxyvitamin D serum concentration (p = 0.034).
Our findings supported the previous observations showing the contribution of lysosomal lipid homeostasis of PBMCs to inflammation and pathogenesis of atherosclerosis.
Niemann-Pick disease Type C1 (NPC1) is a rare hereditary neurodegenerative disease. NPC1-patients suffer, amongst others, from ataxia, based on a loss of cerebellar Purkinje cells (PCs). Impaired expression/function of excitatory amino acid transporters (EAATs) are suspected of contributing to PC-degeneration in hereditary spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs). Thus, we studied EAAT-expression and its impact to PC-activity in NPC1-/-mice. Western blot revealed reduced EAAT1, EAAT2, EAAT4, and βIII-spectrin levels in NPC1-/-mice. EAATs play a crucial role in synaptic transmission, thus we were interested in the impact of the reduced EAAT-expression on the function of PCs. Patch-clamp recordings of PCs showed no differences in the firing patterns of NPC1+/+and NPC1-/-mice using a low internal chloride concentration. Because EAAT4 also comprises a chloride permeable ion pore, we perturbed the chloride homeostasis using a high internal chloride concentration. We observed differences in the firing patterns of NPC1+/+and NPC1-/-mice, suggesting an impact of the altered EAAT4-expression. Additionally, the EAAT-antagonist DL-TBOA acts differently in NPC1+/+and NPC1-/-mice. Our data support the line of evidence that an altered EAAT-expression/function is involved in neurodegeneration of PCs observed in SCAs. Thus, we suggest that similar pathogenic mechanisms contribute the loss of PCs in NPC1.
We have tested the efficacy of hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin (HPBCD) delivered by the nasal route in the mouse model of juvenile Niemann-Pick C1 disease (NPC1), as pulmonary disease has not responded to systemic therapy with this drug. Since mice have no gag reflex, coating of the nasal cavity, with possible access to the brain, would be followed by delivery of HPBCD to the lung. While foamy macrophages, containing stored cholesterol, were found in the Npc1 nmf164 homozygous mice, a marked inflammatory response was found with inhaled HPBCD, both in mutant and wild-type animals. Slight inflammation also occasionally occurred with saline inhalation. There was no difference between the saline-treated, HPBCD-treated, and untreated Npc1 nmf164 homozygous mice for weight, balance beam performance, or coat hanger performance. Interestingly, there was a trend to longer survival in the HPBCD-treated Npc1 nmf164 homozygous mice, which, when combined with the survival times of the saline-treated survivals (each of which was not different), became significant.
Intrathecal 2-hydoxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin has been found to mobilize cholesterol, extend life, reduce cerebellar pathology, and delay onset of ataxia in the mouse and cat models of Niemann-Pick disease, type C1, a clinically variable progressive and ultimately fatal neurodegenerative storage disorder characterized by endolysosomal accumulation of unesterified cholesterol.
In this study, the long-term effects of intrathecal 2-hydoxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin treatment for 2.5 to three years in humans with Niemann-Pick disease, type C, were evaluated.
Three patients with Niemann-Pick disease, type C, in different stages of progression and displaying varying disease manifestations were treated with intrathecal 2-hydoxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin (VTS-270) delivered by lumbar puncture infusion through an intermediate-size patient population investigational new drug application for expanded access. Disease progression was monitored with the Niemann-Pick disease, type C, Neurological Severity Scale and numerous objective measures of function in five neurological domains typically impacted by the disease: cognitive/language, gait/balance, fine motor, swallowing, and eye movement.
No worsening in any domain except eye movements (vertical pursuit gain) was seen for any of the three patients, and in the other domains, improved scores on measures were seen over time for one or more patients. The Niemann-Pick disease type C (NPC) Neurological Severity Scale (NSS) showed stable to slightly improved ratings.
These trajectories are not consistent with the typical trajectory of the disease and suggest that intrathecal 2-hydoxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin has stabilized the disease over an extended period of time, supporting the current phase 2/3 controlled registration trial with VTS-270.
Niemann-Pick-disease type C1 (NPC1) is an autosomal-recessive cholesterol-storage disorder. Besides other symptoms, NPC1 patients develop liver dysfunction and hepatosplenomegaly. The mechanisms of hepatomegaly and alterations of lipid metabolism-related genes in NPC1 disease are still poorly understood. Here, we used an NPC1 mouse model to study an additive hepatoprotective effect of a combination of 2-hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin (HPβCD), miglustat and allopregnanolone (combination therapy) with the previously established monotherapy using HPβCD. We examined transgene effects as well as treatment effects on liver morphology and hepatic lipid metabolism, focusing on hepatic cholesterol transporter genes. Livers of Npc1-/- mice showed hepatic cholesterol sequestration with consecutive liver injury, an increase of lipogenetic gene expression, e.g., HMG-CoA, a decrease of lipolytic gene expression, e.g., pparα and acox1, and a decrease of lipid transporter gene expression, e.g., acat1, abca1 and fatp2. Both, combination therapy and monotherapy, led to a reduction of hepatic lipids and an amelioration of NPC1 liver disease symptoms. Monotherapy effects were related to pparα- and acox1-associated lipolysis/β-oxidation and to fatp2-induced fatty acid transport, whereas the combination therapy additionally increased the cholesterol transport via abca1 and apoE. However, HPβCD monotherapy additionally increased cholesterol synthesis as indicated by a marked increase of the HMG-CoA and srebp-2 mRNA expression, probably as a result of increased hepatocellular proliferation.
Supramolecular chemistry is an extremely useful and important domain for understanding pharmaceutical sciences because various physiological reactions and drug activities are based on supramolecular chemistry. However, it is not a major domain in the pharmaceutical field. In this review, we propose a new concept in pharmaceutical sciences termed "supramolecular pharmaceutical sciences," which combines pharmaceutical sciences and supramolecular chemistry. This concept could be useful for developing new ideas, methods, hypotheses, strategies, materials, and mechanisms in pharmaceutical sciences. Herein, we focus on cyclodextrin (CyD)-based supermolecules, because CyDs have been used not only as pharmaceutical excipients or active pharmaceutical ingredients but also as components of supermolecules.
Niemann-Pick C1-like 1 (NPC1L1) and Niemann-Pick C2 (NPC2) is a critical mediator of cholesterol absorption. The aim of the present study was to investigate the prognostic value of NPC1L1 and NPC2 in human primary hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The expression level of NPC1L1 and NPC2 were evaluated by Immunohistochemistry, Westen blot and Real-time Quantitative PCR. Protein expression level in tissue was represented by integral optic density (IOD). For prognosis analyses, outcome-based cut-point was calculated by X-tile software. Kaplan-Meier analysis, Cox regression analysis were used evaluate prognostic value of NPC1L1 and NPC2 and NPC1L1/NPC2 combination. Both of NPC1L1 and NPC2 were significantly decreased in HCC tissues than peritumoral liver tissues (61 pairs of tissue for Immunohistochemistry and 10 pairs of tissues for Western blot and Real-time Quantitative PCR), respectively. (n=61: p=0.0005 for NPC1L1 and p=0.0001 for NPC2; n=10: p=0.0002 for NPC1L1 and p=0.0489 for NPC2). Kaplan-Meier analyses in 265 HCC cases were showed that the low expression level of NPC1L1 and NPC2 and NPC1L1/NPC2 combination were significantly correlated with poor overall survival (OS) and shorter time to recurrence (TTR). In addition, univariate and multivariate Cox analyses showed that the expression level of NPC1L1/NPC2 combination in HCC was an independent prognostic factor for OS and TTR. Conclusion: NPC1L1 and NPC2 were lowly expressed in HCC compared with peritumoral liver tissues, and low expression of NPC1L1 and NPC2 in HCC tissues may indicate poor outcome of HCC patients after surgery. NPC1L1/NPC2 combination is an independent prognostic factor for OS and TTR in postoperative HCC patients.
Niemann-Pick Type C1 (NPC1) disease is an autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disease characterized by an excessive accumulation of unesterified cholesterol in late endosomes/lysosomes. Patients with NPC1 disease show a series of symptoms in neuropathology, including a gradually increased loss of motor control and seizures. However, mechanism of the neurological manifestations in NPC1 disease is not fully understood yet. In this study, we utilized the micro-electrode array (MEA) to analyze the spontaneous extracellular electrical activity in cultivated cortical neurons of the NPC1 mutant (NPC1-/-) mouse. Our results show a decrease of the spontaneous electrical activity in NPC1-/- neuronal network when compared to wild type neurons, as indicated by the decreased spike rate, burst rate, event rate, and the increased burst period and event period. Application of 3, 5-dihydroxyphenylglycine (DHPG), a specific agonist of group I metabotropic glutamate receptors, improved the electrical activity of the NPC1-/- neuronal network, suggesting that DHPG can be used as a potential therapeutic strategy for recovery of the electrical activity in NPC1 disease.
Niemann-Pick disease, type C1 (NPC1) is a neurodegenerative disorder with limited treatment options. NPC1 is associated with neuroinflammation; however, attempts to therapeutically target neuroinflammation in NPC1 have had mixed success. We show here that NPC1 neuroinflammation is characterized by an atypical microglia activation phenotype. Specifically, Npc1-/- microglia demonstrated altered morphology, reduced levels of lineage markers and a shift towards glycolytic metabolism. Treatment with 2-hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin (HPβCD), a drug currently being studied in a phase 3 clinical trial, reversed all microglia-associated defects in Npc1-/- animals. In addition, impairing microglia mediated neuroinflammation by genetic deletion of IRF8 led to decreased symptoms and increased lifespan. We identified CD22 as a marker of dysregulated microglia in Npc1 mutant mice and subsequently demonstrated that elevated cerebrospinal fluid levels of CD22 in NPC1 patients responds to HPβCD administration. Collectively, these data provide the first in-depth analysis of microglia function in NPC1 and suggests possible new therapeutic approaches.
Associations between cells and the basement membrane are critical for a variety of biological events including cell proliferation, cell migration, cell differentiation and the maintenance of tissue integrity. Dystroglycan is a highly glycosylated basement membrane receptor, and is involved in physiological processes that maintain integrity of the skeletal muscle, as well as development and function of the central nervous system. Aberrant O-glycosylation of the α subunit of this protein, and a concomitant loss of dystroglycan's ability to function as a receptor for extracellular matrix (ECM) ligands that bear laminin globular (LG) domains, occurs in several congenital/limb-girdle muscular dystrophies (also referred to as dystroglycanopathies). Recent genetic studies revealed that mutations in DAG1 (which encodes dystroglycan) and at least 17 other genes disrupt the ECM receptor function of dystroglycan and cause disease. Here, we summarize recent advances in our understanding of the enzymatic functions of two of these disease genes: the like-glycosyltransferase (LARGE) and protein O-mannose kinase (POMK, previously referred to as SGK196). In addition, we discuss the structure of the glycan that directly binds the ECM ligands and the mechanisms by which this functional motif is linked to dystroglycan. In light of the fact that dystroglycan functions as a matrix receptor and the polysaccharide synthesized by LARGE is the binding motif for matrix proteins, we propose to name this novel polysaccharide structure matriglycan. 
Dystroglycanopathies are a group of congenital muscular dystrophies (CMD) often caused by mutations in genes encoding glycosyltransferases that lead to hypoglycosylation of α-dystroglycan (α-DG) and reduce its extracellular matrix-binding activity. Overexpressing LARGE (formerly known as like-glycosyltransferase) generates an extracellular matrix-binding carbohydrate epitope in cells with CMD-causing mutations in not only LARGE but also other glycosyltransferases, including POMT1, POMGnT1, and fukutin, creating the possibilities of a one-for-all gene therapy. To determine the feasibility of LARGE gene therapy, a serotype 9 adeno-associated viral vector for overexpressing LARGE (AAV9-LARGE) was injected intracardially into newborns of two mouse models of CMD: the natural LARGE mutant Large(myd) mice and protein O-mannose N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase 1 (POMGnT1) knockout mice. AAV9-LARGE virus treatment yielded partial restoration of α-DG glycosylation and ligand-binding activity. The muscular dystrophy phenotype in skeletal muscles was ameliorated as revealed by significantly reduced fibrosis, necrosis, and numbers of centrally located nuclei with improved motor function. These results indicate that LARGE overexpression in vivo by AAV9-mediated gene therapy is effective at restoring functional glycosylation of α-DG and rescuing the muscular dystrophy phenotype in deficiency of not only LARGE but also POMGnT1, providing evidence that in vivo LARGE gene therapy may be broadly useful in dystroglycanopathies.
Genetic defects in like-glycosyltransferase (LARGE) cause congenital muscular dystrophy with central nervous system manifestations. The underlying molecular pathomechanism is the hypoglycosylation of α-dystroglycan (α-DG), which is evidenced by diminished immunoreactivity to IIH6C4 and VIA4-1, antibodies that recognize carbohydrate epitopes. Previous studies indicate that LARGE participates in the formation of a phosphoryl glycan branch on O-linked mannose or it modifies complex N- and mucin O-glycans. In this study, we overexpressed LARGE in neural stem cells deficient in protein O-mannosyltransferase 2 (POMT2), an enzyme required for O-mannosyl glycosylation. The results showed that overexpressing LARGE did not lead to hyperglycosylation of α-DG in POMT2 knockout (KO) cells but did generate IIH6C4 and VIA4-1 immunoreactivity and laminin-binding activity. Additionally, overexpressing LARGE in cells deficient in both POMT2 and α-DG generated laminin-binding IIH6C4 immunoreactivity. These results indicate that LARGE expression resulted in the glycosylation of proteins other than α-DG in the absence of O-mannosyl glycosylation. The IIH6C4 immunoreactivity generated in double-KO cells was largely removed by treatment either with peptide N-glycosidase F or with cold aqueous hydrofluoric acid, suggesting that LARGE expression caused phosphoryl glycosylation of N-glycans. However, the glycosylation of α-DG by LARGE is dependent on POMT2, indicating that LARGE expression only modifies O-linked mannosyl glycans of α-DG. Thus, LARGE expression mediates the phosphoryl glycosylation of not only O-mannosyl glycans including those on α-DG but also N-glycans on proteins other than α-DG.
The Haemophilus influenzae HMW1 adhesin is an important virulence exoprotein that is secreted via the two-partner secretion pathway and is glycosylated at multiple asparagine residues in consensus N-linked sequons. Unlike the heavily branched glycans found in eukaryotic N-linked glycoproteins, the modifying glycan structures in HMW1 are mono-hexoses or di-hexoses. Recent work demonstrated that the H. influenzae HMW1C protein is the glycosyltransferase responsible for transferring glucose and galactose to the acceptor sites of HMW1. An Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae protein designated ApHMW1C shares high-level homology with HMW1C and has been assigned to the GT41 family, which otherwise contains only O-glycosyltransferases. In this study, we demonstrated that ApHMW1C has N-glycosyltransferase activity and is able to transfer glucose and galactose to known asparagine sites in HMW1. In addition, we found that ApHMW1C is able to complement a deficiency of HMW1C and mediate HMW1 glycosylation and adhesive activity in whole bacteria. Initial structure-function studies suggested that ApHMW1C consists of two domains, including a 15-kDa N-terminal domain and a 55-kDa C-terminal domain harboring glycosyltransferase activity. These findings suggest a new subfamily of HMW1C-like glycosyltransferases distinct from other GT41 family O-glycosyltransferases.
LARGE (like-glycosyltransferase) and LARGE2 (glycosyltransferase-like 1B (GYLTL1B)) are homologous Golgi glycosyltransferases possessing two catalytic domains with homology to members of glycosyltransferase families GT8 and GT49. Mutations in human and mouse Large result in muscular dystrophy due to underglycosylation of dystroglycan. The systemic function of LARGE2 is unknown, but at a cellular level the enzyme can substitute for LARGE in glycosylating dystroglycan. Here, we show that LARGE2 catalyzes the same glycosylation reaction as LARGE. It is a bifunctional glycosyltransferase using uridine diphosphate (UDP)-xylose (Xyl) and UDP-glucuronic acid (GlcA) as donor sugars to produce a xyloglucuronan with alternating Xyl and GlcA residues.
Helicobacter heilmannii naturally colonizes the stomachs of dogs and cats and has been associated with gastric disorders in humans. Nine feline Helicobacter strains, classified as H. heilmannii based on ureAB and 16S rRNA gene sequences, were divided into a highly virulent and a low-virulence group. The genomes of these strains were sequenced to investigate their phylogenetic relationships, to define their gene content and diversity, and to determine if the differences in pathogenicity were associated with the presence or absence of potential virulence genes. The capacities of these helicobacters to bind to the gastric mucosa were investigated as well. Our analyses revealed that the low-virulence strains do not belong to the species H. heilmannii but to a novel, closely related species for which we propose the name Helicobacter ailurogastricus. Several homologs of H. pylori virulence factors, such as IceA1, HrgA, and jhp0562-like glycosyltransferase, are present in H. heilmannii but absent in H. ailurogastricus. Both species contain a VacA-like autotransporter, for which the passenger domain is remarkably larger in H. ailurogastricus than in H. heilmannii. In addition, H. ailurogastricus shows clear differences in binding to the gastric mucosa compared to H. heilmannii. These findings highlight the low-virulence character of this novel Helicobacter species. 
Emerging evidence indicates that the islet fibrosis is attributable to activation of islet stellate cells (ISCs). In the present study, we compared the differences in biological activity of ISCs isolated from diabetic db/db and non-diabetic db/m mice, and the effects of the regenerating islet-derived protein 1 (Reg1) on ISC function. We showed that ISCs isolated from db/db mice were activated more rapidly than those from db/m mice during culture. Both Reg1 and its putative receptor exostosin-like glycosyltransferase 3 (EXTL3) were highly expressed by diabetic ISCs. Treatment with Reg1 inhibited migration, viability, and synthesis and secretion of Type I Collagen(Col-I), Type III Collagen(Col-III) and Fibronectin(FN) by diabetic ISCs, and this was associated with deactivation of the PI3K/Akt, MAPK/Erk1/2 signaling pathway in an EXTL3-dependent manner. In conclusion, our observations (i) confirmed the presence of fibrogenic stellate cells within pancreatic islets, which are prone to be activated in Type 2 diabetes, and (ii) revealed a potential role for Reg1 in preventing ISC activation. 
Mutations in fukutin-related protein (FKRP) gene are characterized with lack of functionally glycosylated α-dystroglycan (F-α-DG). Surprisingly, a few muscle fibers express strong F-α-DG. Herein, we investigated the restoration of F-α-DG in the FKRP mutant muscles and showed that the restoration of glycosylation is associated with muscle regeneration and dependent on the expression of both like-glycosyltransferase (LARGE) and partially functional FKRP. F-α-DG in the regenerating fibers reaches up to normal levels and lasts for &gt;4 weeks, but no up-regulation of the LARGE and FKRP is detected during the regeneration process. The FKRP protein with P448L mutation is sufficient for functional glycosylation of α-DG in regenerating fibers, but not in mature fibers. Thus, factors other than FKRP enable regenerating fibers to produce functional α-DG, compensating for the defect in FKRP function. Identification of factors other than LARGE and FKRP could generate new approaches for restoration of F-α-DG in mature muscle fibers with defects in FKRP functions. 
Spondylo-epi-metaphyseal dysplasia (SEMD) is a group of inherited skeletal diseases characterized by the anomalies in spine, epiphyses and metaphyses. SEMD is highly heterogeneous and &gt;20 distinct entities have been identified. Here we describe a novel type of SEMD in two unrelated Turkish patients who presented with severe platyspondyly, kyphoscoliosis, pelvic distortion, constriction of the proximal femora and brachydactyly. Although these phenotypes overlap considerably with some known SEMDs, they had a novel causal gene, exostosin-like glycosyltransferase 3 (EXTL3), that encodes a glycosyltransferase involved in the synthesis of heparin and heparan sulfate. The EXTL3 mutation identified in the patients was a homozygous missense mutation (c.953C&gt;T) that caused a substitution in a highly conserved amino acid (p.P318L). The enzyme activity of the mutant EXTL3 protein was significantly decreased compared to the wild-type protein. Both patients had spinal cord compression at the cranio-vertebral junction and multiple liver cysts since early infancy. One of the patients showed severe immunodeficiency, which is considered non-fortuitous association. Our findings would help define a novel type of SEMD caused by EXTL3 mutations.
Selection signals of Korean cattle might be attributed largely to artificial selection for meat quality. Rapidly increased intragenic markers of newly annotated genes in the bovine genome would help overcome limited findings of genetic markers associated with meat quality at the selection signals in a previous study. The present study examined genetic associations of marbling score (MS) with intragenic nucleotide variants at selection signals of Korean cattle. A total of 39 092 nucleotide variants of 407 Korean cattle were utilized in the association analysis. A total of 129 variants were selected within newly annotated genes in the bovine genome. Their genetic associations were analyzed using the mixed model with random polygenic effects based on identical-by-state genetic relationships among animals in order to control for spurious associations produced by population structure. Genetic associations of MS were found (P&lt;3.88×10-4) with six intragenic nucleotide variants on bovine autosomes 3 (cache domain containing 1, CACHD1), 5 (like-glycosyltransferase, LARGE), 16 (cell division cycle 42 binding protein kinase alpha, CDC42BPA) and 21 (snurportin 1, SNUPN; protein tyrosine phosphatase, non-receptor type 9, PTPN9; chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan 4, CSPG4). In particular, the genetic associations with CDC42BPA and LARGE were confirmed using an independent data set of Korean cattle. The results implied that allele frequencies of functional variants and their proximity variants have been augmented by directional selection for greater MS and remain selection signals in the bovine genome. Further studies of fine mapping would be useful to incorporate favorable alleles in marker-assisted selection for MS of Korean cattle. 
Upon nutrient starvation, autophagy digests unwanted cellular components to generate catabolites that are required for housekeeping biosynthesis processes. A complete execution of autophagy demands an enhancement in lysosome function and biogenesis to match the increase in autophagosome formation. Here, we report that mucolipin-1 (also known as TRPML1 or ML1), a Ca(2+) channel in the lysosome that regulates many aspects of lysosomal trafficking, plays a central role in this quality-control process. By using Ca(2+) imaging and whole-lysosome patch clamping, lysosomal Ca(2+) release and ML1 currents were detected within hours of nutrient starvation and were potently up-regulated. In contrast, lysosomal Na(+)-selective currents were not up-regulated. Inhibition of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) or activation of transcription factor EB (TFEB) mimicked a starvation effect in fed cells. The starvation effect also included an increase in lysosomal proteostasis and enhanced clearance of lysosomal storage, including cholesterol accumulation in Niemann-Pick disease type C (NPC) cells. However, this effect was not observed when ML1 was pharmacologically inhibited or genetically deleted. Furthermore, overexpression of ML1 mimicked the starvation effect. Hence, lysosomal adaptation to environmental cues such as nutrient levels requires mTOR/TFEB-dependent, lysosome-to-nucleus regulation of lysosomal ML1 channels and Ca(2+) signaling. 
Niemann-Pick disease type C (NPC) is an atypical lysosomal storage disease resulting from mutations in one of two genes, either NPC1 or NPC2. Although a neurovisceral disorder, it is above all a neurodegenerative disease in the vast majority of patients. Not an enzyme deficiency, it is currently conceived as a lipid trafficking disorder. Impaired egress of cholesterol from the late endosomal/lysosomal (LE/L) compartment is a specific and key element of the pathogenesis, but other lipids, more specially sphingolipids, are also involved, and there are indications for further abnormalities. The full function of the NPC1 and NPC2 proteins is still unclear. This review provides a reappraisal of lipid storage and lysosomal enzymes activities in tissues/cells from NPC patients and animal models. It summarizes the current knowledge on the NPC1 and NPC2 proteins and their function in transport of cholesterol within the late endosomal-lysosomal compartment, with emphasis on differences between systemic organs and the brain; it also discusses regulation by membrane lipids of the NPC2-mediated cholesterol trafficking, interplay between cholesterol and sphingomyelin, the metabolic origin of glycosphingolipids stored in brain, and the putative role of free sphingoid bases in pathogenesis. Brief mention is finally made of diseases affecting other genes that were very recently shown to impact the "NPC pathway". 
Post-lysosomal cholesterol trafficking is an important, but poorly understood process that is essential to maintain lipid homeostasis. Niemann-Pick type C1 (NPC1), an integral membrane protein on the limiting membrane of late endosome/lysosome (LE/LY), is known to accept cholesterol from NPC2 and then mediate cholesterol transport from LE/LY to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and plasma membrane in a vesicle- or oxysterol-binding protein (OSBP)-related protein 5 (ORP5)-dependent manner. Mutations in the NPC1 gene can be found in the majority of NPC patients, who accumulate massive amounts of cholesterol and other lipids in the LE/LY due to a defect in intracellular lipid trafficking. Liver X receptor (LXR) is the major positive regulator of NPC1 expression. Atherosclerosis is the pathological basis of coronary heart disease, one of the major causes of death worldwide. NPC1 has been shown to play a critical role in the atherosclerotic progression. In this review, we have summarized the role of NPC1 in regulating intracellular cholesterol trafficking and atherosclerosis. 
During endocytosis, membrane components move to intraluminal vesicles of the endolysosomal compartment for digestion. At the late endosomes, cholesterol is sorted out mainly by two sterol-binding proteins, Niemann-Pick protein type C (NPC)1 and NPC2. To study the NPC2-mediated intervesicular cholesterol transfer, we developed a liposomal assay system. (Abdul-Hammed, M., B. Breiden, M. A. Adebayo, J. O. Babalola, G. Schwarzmann, and K. Sandhoff. 2010. Role of endosomal membrane lipids and NPC2 in cholesterol transfer and membrane fusion. J. Lipid Res. 51: 1747-1760.) Anionic lipids stimulate cholesterol transfer between liposomes while SM inhibits it, even in the presence of anionic bis(monoacylglycero)phosphate (BMP). Preincubation of vesicles containing SM with acid sphingomyelinase (ASM) (SM phosphodiesterase, EC 3.1.4.12) results in hydrolysis of SM to ceramide (Cer), which enhances cholesterol transfer. Besides SM, ASM also cleaves liposomal phosphatidylcholine. Anionic phospholipids derived from the plasma membrane (phosphatidylglycerol and phosphatidic acid) stimulate SM and phosphatidylcholine hydrolysis by ASM more effectively than BMP, which is generated during endocytosis. ASM-mediated hydrolysis of liposomal SM was also stimulated by incorporation of diacylglycerol (DAG), Cer, and free fatty acids into the liposomal membranes. Conversely, phosphatidylcholine hydrolysis was inhibited by incorporation of cholesterol, Cer, DAG, monoacylglycerol, and fatty acids. Our data suggest that SM degradation by ASM is required for physiological secretion of cholesterol from the late endosomal compartment, and is a key regulator of endolysosomal lipid digestion. 
Aging and pathologic conditions cause intracellular aggregation of macromolecules and the dysfunction and degeneration of neurons, but the mechanisms are largely unknown. Prime examples are lysosomal storage disorders such as Niemann-Pick type C (NPC) disease, where defects in the endosomal-lysosomal protein NPC1 or NPC2 cause intracellular accumulation of unesterified cholesterol and other lipids leading to neurodegeneration and fatal neurovisceral symptoms. Here, we investigated the impact of NPC1 deficiency on rodent neurons using pharmacologic and genetic models of the disease. Improved ultrastructural detection of lipids and correlative light and electron microscopy identified lamellar inclusions as the subcellular site of cholesterol accumulation in neurons with impaired NPC1 activity. Immunogold labeling combined with transmission electron microscopy revealed the presence of CD63 on internal lamellae and of LAMP1 on the membrane surrounding the inclusions, indicating their origins from intraluminal vesicles of late endosomes and of a lysosomal compartment, respectively. Lamellar inclusions contained cell-intrinsic cholesterol and surface-labeled GM1, indicating the incorporation of plasma membrane components. Scanning electron microscopy revealed that the therapeutic drug candidate β-cyclodextrin induces the subplasmalemmal location of lamellar inclusions and their subsequent release to the extracellular space. In parallel, β-cyclodextrin mediated the NPC1-independent redistribution of cholesterol within neurons and thereby abolished a deleterious cycle of enhanced cholesterol synthesis and its intracellular accumulation, which was indicated by neuron-specific transcript analysis. Our study provides new mechanistic insight into the pathologic aggregation of macromolecules in neurons and suggests exocytosis as cellular target for its therapeutic reversal.
Many neurodegenerative diseases involve pathologic accumulation of molecules within neurons, but the subcellular location and the cellular impact are often unknown and therapeutic approaches lacking. We investigated these questions in the lysosomal storage disorder Niemann-Pick type C (NPC), where a defect in intracellular cholesterol transport causes loss of neurons and fatal neurovisceral symptoms. Here, we identify lamellar inclusions as the subcellular site of lipid accumulation in neurons, we uncover a vicious cycle of cholesterol synthesis and accretion, which may cause gradual neurodegeneration, and we reveal how β-cyclodextrin, a potential therapeutic drug, reverts these changes. Our study provides new mechanistic insight in NPC disease and uncovers new targets for therapeutic approaches.
The cholesterol storage disorder Niemann-Pick type C (NPC) disease is caused by defects in either of two late endosomal/lysosomal proteins, NPC1 and NPC2. NPC2 is a 16-kDa soluble protein that binds cholesterol in a 1:1 stoichiometry and can transfer cholesterol between membranes by a mechanism that involves protein-membrane interactions. To examine the structural basis of NPC2 function in cholesterol trafficking, a series of point mutations were generated across the surface of the protein. Several NPC2 mutants exhibited deficient sterol transport properties in a set of fluorescence-based assays. Notably, these mutants were also unable to promote egress of accumulated intracellular cholesterol from npc2(-/-) fibroblasts. The mutations mapped to several regions on the protein surface, suggesting that NPC2 can bind to more than one membrane simultaneously. Indeed, we have previously demonstrated that WT NPC2 promotes vesicle-vesicle interactions. These interactions were abrogated, however, by mutations causing defective sterol transfer properties. Molecular modeling shows that NPC2 is highly plastic, with several intense positively charged regions across the surface that could interact favorably with negatively charged membrane phospholipids. The point mutations generated in this study caused changes in NPC2 surface charge distribution with minimal conformational changes. The plasticity, coupled with membrane flexibility, probably allows for multiple cholesterol transfer routes. Thus, we hypothesize that, in part, NPC2 rapidly traffics cholesterol between closely appositioned membranes within the multilamellar interior of late endosomal/lysosomal proteins, ultimately effecting cholesterol egress from this compartment.
Niemann-Pick type C disease (NPC) is a disorder characterized by abnormal intracellular accumulation of unesterified cholesterol and glycolipids. Two distinct disease-causing genes have been isolated, NPC1 and NPC2. The NPC1 protein is involved in the sorting and recycling of cholesterol and glycosphingolipids in the late endosomal/lysosomal system. It has extensive homology with the Patched1 (Ptc1) receptor, a transmembrane protein localized in the primary cilium, and involved in the Hedgehog signaling (Shh) pathway. We assessed the presence of NPC1 and Ptc1 proteins and evaluated the relative distribution and morphology of primary cilia in fibroblasts from five NPC1 patients and controls, and in normal fibroblasts treated with 3-ß-[2-(diethylamino)ethoxy]androst-5-en-17-one (U18666A), a cholesterol transport-inhibiting drug that is widely used to mimic NPC. Immunofluorescence and western blot analyses showed a significant decrease in expression of NPC1 and Ptc1 in NPC1 fibroblasts, while they were normally expressed in U18666A-treated fibroblasts. Moreover, fibroblasts from NPC1 patients and U18666A-treated cells showed a lower percentage distribution of primary cilia and a significant reduction in median cilia length with respect to controls. These are the first results demonstrating altered cytoplasmic expression of Ptc1 and reduced number and length of primary cilia, where Ptc1 is located, in fibroblasts from NPC1 patients. We suggest that the alterations in Ptc1 expression in cells from NPC1 patients are closely related to NPC1 expression deficit, while the primary cilia alterations observed in NPC1 and U18666A-treated fibroblasts may represent a secondary event derived from a defective metabolic pathway.
Mammalian cells acquire most exogenous cholesterol through receptor-mediated endocytosis of low-density lipoproteins (LDLs). After internalization, LDL cholesteryl esters are hydrolyzed to release free cholesterol, which then translocates to late endosomes (LEs)/lysosomes (LYs) and incorporates into the membranes by co-ordinated actions of Niemann-Pick type C (NPC) 1 and NPC2 proteins. However, how cholesterol exits LEs/LYs and moves to other organelles remain largely unclear. Growing evidence has suggested that nonvesicular transport is critically involved in the post-endosomal cholesterol trafficking. Numerous sterol-transfer proteins (STPs) have been identified to mediate directional cholesterol transfer at membrane contact sites (MCSs) formed between 2 closely apposed organelles. In addition, a recent study reveals that lysosome-peroxisome membrane contact (LPMC) established by a non-STP synaptotagmin VII and a specific phospholipid phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate also serves as a novel and important path for LDL-cholesterol trafficking. These findings highlight an essential role of MCSs in intracellular cholesterol transport, and further work is needed to unveil how various routes are regulated and integrated to maintain proper cholesterol distribution and homeostasis in eukaryotic cells.
Rice bran oil (RBO) possesses a plasma cholesterol-lowering activity, while effect of wheat bran oil (WBO) on plasma cholesterol remains unknown. The present study compared the cholesterol-lowering activity of WBO with that of RBO in hamsters. Fifty-four male hamsters were divided into seven groups fed either a noncholesterol diet (NCD) or one of six high-cholesterol diets, namely HCD diet (0.2% cholesterol +9.5% lard), HCD+C diet (0.2% cholesterol +9.5% lard +0.5% cholestyramine), WL diet (0.2% cholesterol +4.8% Lard +4.8% WBO), WH diet (0.2% cholesterol +9.5% WBO), RL diet (0.2% cholesterol +4.8% Lard +4.8% RBO), and RH diet (0.2% cholesterol +9.5% RBO). Plasma total cholesterol (TC) in HCD group was 327.4 ± 31.8 mg/dL, while plasma TC in two WBO and two RBO groups was 242.2 ± 20.8, 243.1 ± 31.7, 257.1 ± 16.3, and 243.4 ± 46.0 mg/dL, respectively, leading to a decrease in plasma TC by 22-26% ( P &lt; 0.01). No significant difference in cholesterol-lowering potency was seen between WBO and RBO. Plasma cholesterol-lowering activity of WBO and RBO was accompanied by down-regulation of hepatic 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase and fatty acid synthase, while up-regulation of cholesterol-7α-hydroxylase. WL, WH, RL, and RH diets increased the fecal excretion of total neutral sterols by 72.8%, 106.9%, 5.4%, and 36.8% ( P &lt; 0.01) respectively. Results indicated WBO and RBO could inhibit cholesterol absorption via down-regulation of intestinal Niemann-Pick C1 like 1 protein, acyl CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase 2, and ATP binding cassette transporter 5. In summary, WBO was equally effective as RBO in decreasing plasma cholesterol in hypercholesterolemia hamsters.
Intestinal cholesterol absorption includes intestinal Niemann-Pick C1-like 1 (NPC1L1) and is an important target pathway in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). We investigated the expression of NPC1L1 and its correlation with liver X receptor (LXR) expression in peripheral mononuclear (PMN) cells in patients with NAFLD.
We evaluated intestinal expression of NPC1L1 in 25 NAFLD patients and 28 healthy controls. We calculated the mRNA expression levels of LXR and farnesoid X receptor (FXR), which are master players of cholesterol metabolism in PMN cells. The protein expression of ABCA1, ABCG5/8, NPC1L1, SREBP, LXR, FXR, and CD36 was measured on tissue samples from the duodenum and ileum.
The expression of LXR (p = 0.01) and FXR (p = 0.03) in PMN cells was increased in the NAFLD group compared to the control group. Duodenal NPC1L1 decreased in the NAFLD group compared to the healthy controls (3.38 ± 1.4 vs. 2.42 ± 1.2, p = 0.05). NPC1L1 expression in the duodenum was negatively correlated with LXR expression in PMN cells. Expression of LXR and FXR in the ileum was also negatively correlated with the expression of LXR in PMN cells.
Duodenal NPC1L1 expression was decreased in NAFLD and was negatively correlated with LXR expression in PMN cells.
Fatty acids have been shown to modulate intestinal cholesterol absorption in cells and animals, a process that is mediated by several transporter proteins. Of these proteins, Niemann-Pick C1-Like 1 (NPC1L1) is a major contributor to this process. The current study investigates the unknown mechanism by which fatty acids modulate cholesterol absorption.
We evaluated the effects of six fatty acids palmitic acid (PAM), oleic acid (OLA), linoleic acid (LNA), arachidonic acid (ARA), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) on cholesterol uptake and transport in human enterocytes Caco-2 cells, and on the mRNA expression levels of NPC1L1, others proteins (ABCG5, ABCG8, ABCA1, ACAT2, MTP, Caveolin 1, Annexin-2) involved in cholesterol absorption, and SREBP-1 and SREBP-2 that are responsible for lipid metabolism.
The polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), especially for EPA and DHA, dose-dependently inhibited cholesterol uptake and transport in Caco-2 monolayer, while saturated fatty acids (SFAs) and monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) had no inhibitory effects. EPA and DHA inhibited cholesterol absorption in Caco-2 monolayer might be caused by down-regulating NPC1L1 mRNA and protein levels, which were associated with inhibition of SREBP-1/- 2 mRNA expression levels.
Results from this study indicate that functional food containing high PUFAs may have potential therapeutic benefit to reduce cholesterol absorption. Further studies on this topic may provide approaches to control lipid metabolism and to promote health.
Cholesterol is delivered to the limiting membrane of late endosomes by Niemann-Pick Type C1 and C2 proteins. This review summarizes recent evidence that cholesterol transfer from endosomes to the endoplasmic reticulum and other organelles is mediated by lipid-binding proteins that localize to membrane contact sites (MCS).
LDL-cholesterol in the late endosomal/lysosomes is exported to the plasma membrane, where most cholesterol resides, and the endoplasmic reticulum, which harbors the regulatory complexes and enzymes that control the synthesis and esterification of cholesterol. A major advance in dissecting these cholesterol transport pathways was identification of frequent and dynamic MCS between endosomes and the endoplasmic reticulum, peroxisomes and plasma membrane. Positioned at these MCS are members of the oxysterol-binding protein (OSBP) and steroidogenic acute regulatory protein-related lipid-transfer family of lipid transfer proteins that bridge the opposing membranes and directly or indirectly mediate cholesterol transfer. OSBP-related protein 1L (ORP1L), ORP5 and ORP6 mediate cholesterol transfer to the endoplasmic reticulum that regulates cholesterol homeostasis. ORP1L and STARD3 also move cholesterol from the endoplasmic reticulum-to-late endosomal/lysosomes under low-cholesterol conditions to facilitate intraluminal vesicle formation. Cholesterol transport also occurs at MCS with peroxisomes and possibly the plasma membrane.
Frequent contacts between organelles and the endo-lysosomal vesicles are sites for bidirectional transfer of cholesterol.
Niemann-Pick C1-like1 (NPC1L1), a crucial cholesterol absorption receptor expressed in human intestine and liver. But in mouse it is only expressed in intestine. Previous studies elucidated that expression of human NPC1L1 in mouse liver led to increase of plasma cholesterol due to activation of absorption from bile. However, hepatic NPC1L1 function was not elucidated in LDL receptor deficient mouse (LDLR-/-) in which LDL was a main lipoprotein as in human.
L1-Tg/LDLR-/- mouse was created by crossing liver-specific NPC1L1 transgenic mouse (L1-Tg) with LDLR-/-. L1-Tg/LDLR-/- mice developed hyperlipidemia when fed with atherogenic diet (AD) containing 0.2% cholesterol for 21days. Compared with control mice, biliary cholesterol level in L1-Tg/LDLR-/- mice was significantly lower, plasma cholesterol level was significantly higher in L1-Tg/LDLR-/- mice under both chow diet and AD feeding. New finding in this study is augmentations of plasma TAG L1-Tg/LDLR-/- mice fed with AD. Results were shown that very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) secretion was elevated in L1-Tg/LDLR-/- mice after AD fed. The increase of VLDL secretion was further confirmed by higher expression of hepatic triacylglycerol hydrolase (TGH) and microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP).
L1-Tg/LDLR-/- mouse is a humanized model to study cholesterol absorption and transportation. The results obtained from L1-Tg/LDLR-/- mouse indicated no feedback mechanism to inhibit NPC1L1 function in liver and hepatic expression of NPC1L1 correlated with VLDL secretion in hypercholesterolemia state.
Phospholipids have been shown to modulate intestinal cholesterol absorption in cells and animals, a process that is regulated by several transporter proteins. Of these proteins, Niemann-Pick C1-Like 1 (NPC1L1) is a major contributor to this process. The mechanism by which phospholipids modulate cholesterol absorption remains unknown. Here, we evaluate the effects of egg-yolk phospholipids on cholesterol absorption and transport in human colon carcinoma cell line (Caco-2 cells) and on the expression of NPC1L1 and others proteins associated with cholesterol absorption (ABCG5, ABCG8, ABCA1, ACAT2, MTP, CAV-1, ANX-2). The roles of SREBP-1 and SREBP-2 in this process were also investigated. The results show that egg-yolk sphingomyelin (CerPCho) and phosphatidylcholine (PtdCho) inhibit cholesterol transport in the Caco-2 monolayer in a dose-dependent manner. These might be due to the decrease of the cholesterol solubility in micelles as well as to the increases in the micellar sizes and the bile acid-binding capacity. Furthermore, the treatments with egg-yolk CerPCho or PtdCho at 1.2 mmol/L reduced the expression levels of NPC1L1 protein to 21 or 22%, respectively, and its mRNA to 9 or 31% of that in the control group (p &lt; 0.05). Moreover, there was a general inhibitory effect of egg-yolk PtdCho and CerPCho on the mRNA levels of SREBP-1, and SREBP-2. These results suggest that the inhibitory effect of egg-yolk CerPCho and PtdCho on cholesterol transport might be due to their interference with the physicochemical properties of micelles and their regulations on the expression of the NPC1L1 gene.
Ebola virus (EBOV) causes fatal hemorrhagic fever with high death rates in human. Currently, there are no available clinically-approved prophylactic or therapeutic treatments. The recently solved crystal structure of cleavage-primed EBOV glycoprotein (GPcl) in complex with the C domain of endosomal protein Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1) provides a new target for the development of EBOV entry inhibitors. In this work, a computational approach using docking and molecular dynamic simulations is carried out for the rational design of peptide inhibitors. A novel cyclo-peptide (Pep-3.3) was identified to target at the late stage of EBOV entry and exhibit specific inhibitory activity against EBOV-GP pseudotyped viruses, with 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 5.1 μM. In vitro binding assay and molecular simulations revealed that Pep-3.3 binds to GPcl with a KD value of 69.7 μM, through interacting with predicted residues in the hydrophobic binding pocket of GPcl. Mutation of predicted residues T83 caused resistance to Pep-3.3 inhibition in viral infectivity, providing preliminary support for the model of the peptide binding to GPcl. This study demonstrates the feasibility of inhibiting EBOV entry by targeting GPcl with peptides.
Diapause is a natural phenomenon characterized by an arrest in development that ensures the survival of organisms under extreme environmental conditions. The process has been well documented in arthropods. However, its molecular basis has been mainly studied in species from temperate zones, leaving a knowledge gap of this phenomenon in tropical species. In the present study, the Neotropical and solitary bee Tetrapedia diversipes was employed as a model for investigating diapause in species from tropical zones. Being a bivoltine insect, Tetrapedia diversipes produce two generations of offspring per year. The first generation, normally born during the wet season, develops faster than individuals from the second generation, born after the dry season. Furthermore, it has been shown that the development of the progeny, of the second generation, is halted at the 5th larval instar, and remains in larval diapause during the dry season. Towards the goal of gaining a better understanding of the diapause phenomenon we compared the global gene expression pattern, in larvae, from both reproductive generations and during diapause. The results demonstrate that there are similarities in the observed gene expression patterns to those already described for temperate climate models, and also identify diapause-related genes that have not been previously reported in the literature.
The RNA-Seq analysis identified 2275 differentially expressed transcripts, of which 1167 were annotated. Of these genes, during diapause, 352 were upregulated and 815 were downregulated. According to their biological functions, these genes were categorized into the following groups: cellular detoxification, cytoskeleton, cuticle, sterol and lipid metabolism, cell cycle, heat shock proteins, immune response, circadian clock, and epigenetic control.
Many of the identified genes have already been described as being related to diapause; however, new genes were discovered, for the first time, in this study. Among those, we highlight: Niemann-Pick type C1, NPC2 and Acyl-CoA binding protein homolog (all involved in ecdysteroid synthesis); RhoBTB2 and SASH1 (associated with cell cycle regulation) and Histone acetyltransferase KAT7 (related to epigenetic transcriptional regulation). The results presented here add important findings to the understanding of diapause in tropical species, thus increasing the comprehension of diapause-related molecular mechanisms.
Bofutsushosan (fangfengtongshengsan in Chinese, BTS) is a formula in traditional Japanese Kampo medicine and Chinese medicine comprising 18 crude drugs that is used for treating obesity and metabolic syndrome.
We evaluated the promotive effects of BTS on lipid and cholesterol elimination in mice.
Mice were reared with a high-fat diet containing boiled water extract of BTS for 30 days, and their biochemical parameters as well as the weight and lipid content of feces were measured. We also measured cholesterol uptake into Caco-2 cells cultured with or without BTS extract.
The body weight and amounts of visceral fat and subcutaneous fat on day 28; the weights of epididymal, perirenal, and mesenteric fat; and the serum concentrations of triglyceride, glucose, and hemoglobin A1c on day 30 were significantly lower in the BTS extract-treated groups than in the control in a dose-dependent manner. The amounts of lipid and cholesterol in the feces collected from day 6-23 were significantly greater than in the control. When Caco-2 cells were incubated with BTS extract, the uptake of cholesterol into cells was significantly reduced in a concentration-dependent manner. Among the components of BTS, the methanol extracts of Platycodi Radix and Zingiberis Rhizoma contribute but the extracts of Ephedrae Herba and Rhei Rhizoma counteract the suppressive effect of BTS on cholesterol uptake into Caco-2 cells.
BTS has beneficial effects on obesity and metabolic syndrome, and its mechanisms of action include the promotion of lipid elimination and the inhibition of cholesterol absorption in the intestine.
This work studied the cell transport of peptidase-generated peptides from cowpea bean proteins and their effects on mRNA expression of cholesterol-related genes in intestinal and liver cells. The ≤3 kDa hydrolysate was obtained and incubated with Caco-2 intestinal cells using Transwell® plates. HepG2 liver cells were incubated with synthetic analogues of peptides (MELNAVSVVHS and MELNAVSVVSH) identified by "de novo" peptide sequencing in the Caco-2 monolayer permeates. The mRNA expression of NPC1L1, ABCA1 and ABCG1 was measured in Caco-2 cells, in the presence or absence of ≤3 kDa hydrolysate and the expression of HMGCR, SREBP2, LXRα, AMPK1, was determined in the HepG2 cells in the presence or absence of synthetic peptides. Exposure of Caco-2 cells to cowpea ≤3 kDa hydrolysate (2.5 and 5 mg/mL) increased ABCG1 expression at 6 h and 12 h. SREBP2, HMGCR and LDLR mRNA levels were reduced in HepG2 cells after 24 h of treatment with MELNAVSVVHS peptide (50 μM and 100 μM). These results suggest that MELNAVSVVHS peptide is able to cross intestinal barrier and to modulate genes involved in cholesterol homeostasis.
The hypocholesterolemic effect of Lonicera caerulea berry extract rich in polyphenols (LCBP) on high cholesterol-induced hypercholesterolemia and lipoprotein metabolite changes was examined in Caco-2 cells and rats. Cyanidin-3-glucoside, catechin, and chlorogenic acid are the major phenolic components of LCBP. The cholesterol-reducing effect and antioxidant capacity of these components were compared in Caco-2 cells. LCBP (80 μg/mL) and cyanidin-3-glucoside, catechin, and chlorogenic acid (50 μM) were found to be effective (p &lt; 0.05). Rats were fed a high cholesterol diet (HCD) with or without LCBP supplementation (75, 150, and 300 mg/kg body weight intragastrically once daily) for 12 weeks. Compared with the HCD control group, LCBP supplementation at 150 and 300 mg/kg decreased the levels of TC, TG, and LDL-C, but increased that of HDL-C. LCBP treatment promoted greater neutral and acidic sterol excretion (p &lt; 0.05) and improved the antioxidant capacity of the colon tissue, colon contents, and blood. Moreover, trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) levels were decreased in serum (p &lt; 0.05). NPC1L1, ACAT2, and MTP mRNA and protein expression were reduced and ABCG5/8 expression was increased (p &lt; 0.05) after LCBP treatment. Our results suggest that LCBP could be used as a functional food for the prevention and treatment of diseases related to excessive cholesterol accumulation.
Type 2 diabetes is associated with a characteristic dyslipidemia that may exacerbate cardiovascular risk. The causes of, and the effects of new antihyperglycemia medications on, this dyslipidemia, are under investigation. In an unexpected reciprocal manner, lowering LDL-cholesterol with statins slightly increases the risk of diabetes. Here we review the latest findings.
The inverse relationship between LDL-cholesterol and diabetes has now been confirmed by multiple lines of evidence. This includes clinical trials, genetic instruments using aggregate single nucleotide polymorphisms, as well as at least eight individual genes - HMGCR, NPC1L1, HNF4A, GCKR, APOE, PCKS9, TM6SF2, and PNPLA3 - support this inverse association. Genetic and pharmacologic evidence suggest that HDL-cholesterol may also be inversely associated with diabetes risk. Regarding the effects of diabetes on lipoproteins, new evidence suggests that insulin resistance but not diabetes per se may explain impaired secretion and clearance of VLDL-triglycerides. Weight loss, bariatric surgery, and incretin-based therapies all lower triglycerides, whereas SGLT2 inhibitors may slightly increase HDL-cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol.
Diabetes and lipoproteins are highly interregulated. Further research is expected to uncover new mechanisms governing the metabolism of glucose, fat, and cholesterol. This topic has important implications for treating type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease.
Sterols are essential nutrients for eukaryotes. Insects are obligate sterol auxotrophs and must acquire this key nutrient from their diets. The digestive tract is the organ for absorbing nutrients as well as sterols from food. In mice, the Niemann-Pick type C1 Like 1 (NPC1L1) gene is highly expressed in the intestine and is critical for cholesterol absorption. In contrast, the molecular mechanisms for the absorption of dietary sterols in insects have not been well studied. We annotated NPC1 genes in 39 insects from 10 orders using available genomic and transcriptomic information and inferred phylogenetic relationships. Insect NPC1 genes were grouped into two sister-clades, NPC1a and NPC1b, suggesting a likely duplication in the ancestor of insects. The former exhibited weaker gut-biased expression or a complete lack of tissue-biased expression, depending on the species, while the latter was highly enriched in the gut of three lepidopteran species. This result is similar to previous findings in Drosophila melanogaster. In insects, NPC1a accumulated non-synonymous substitutions at a lower rate than NPC1b. This pattern was consistent across orders, indicating that NPC1a evolved under stronger molecular constraint than NPC1b.
High fat diet consumes and thyroid hormones (THs) disorders may affect nutrients metabolism, but their impact on the absorptive epithelium, the first place of nutrients access, remains unknown. Our aim was to evaluate the intestinal morphology and nutrients transporters content in mice fed standard (LFD) or high fat (HFD) diets in hypo or hyperthyroidism-induced condition.
C57BL/6 male mice fed LFD or HFD diets for 12 weeks, followed by saline, PTU (antithyroid drug) or T3 treatment up to 30 days. The mice were euthanized and proximal intestine was removed to study GLUT2, GLUT5, PEPT1, FAT-CD36, FATP4, NPC1L1 and NHE3 distribution by Western blotting. Since PPAR-a is activated by fatty acids, which is abundant in the HFD, we also evaluated whether PPAR-a affects nutrients transporters. Thus, mice were treated with fenofibrate, a PPAR-a agonist.
HFD decreased GLUT2, PEPT1, FAT-CD6 and NPC1L1, but increased NHE3, while GLUT5 and FATP4 remained unaltered. THs did not alter distribution of nutrients transporters neither in LFD nor in HFD groups, but they increased villi length and depth crypt in LFD and HFD, respectively. Fenofibrate did not affect content of nutrients transporters, excluding PPAR-a involvement on the HFD-induced changes.
We assume that chronic HFD consumption reduced most of the nutrients transporters content in the small intestine of mice, which might limit the entrance of nutrients and gain weight. Since NHE3 promotes sodium absorption, and it was increased in HFD group, this finding could contribute to explain the hypertension observed in obesity.
Gallstone disease is related to hypersecretion of cholesterol in bile, and low serum phytosterol levels. We examined how genetic polymorphisms of sterol transporters affect childhood cholesterol metabolism trait predicting adult gallstone disease.
In retrospective controlled study, we determined D19H polymorphism of ABCG8 gene, genetic variation at Niemann-Pick C1-like 1 (NPC1L1) gene locus (rs41279633, rs17655652, rs2072183, rs217434 and rs2073548), and serum cholesterol, noncholesterol sterols and lipids in children affected by gallstones decades later (n = 66) and controls (n = 126).
In childhood, phytosterols were lower (9.7%-23.4%) in carriers of risk allele 19H compared to 19D homozygotes. Lowest campesterol/cholesterol tertile consisted of 1.9-times more future gallstone subjects, and 3.7-times more 19H carriers than highest one. Campesterol/cholesterol-ratio was highest in 19D homozygote controls, but ∼11% lower in gallstone 19D homozygotes and ∼25% lower among gallstone and control carriers of 19H. Gallstone subjects with alleles CC of rs41279633 and TT of rs217434 of NPC1L1 had ∼18% lower campesterol/cholesterol-ratio compared to mutation carriers.
Risk trait of cholesterol metabolism (low phytosterols) in childhood favouring cholesterol gallstone disease later in adulthood is influenced by risk variant 19H of ABCG8 and obviously also other factors. NPC1L1 variants have minor influence on noncholesterol sterols.
The cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)-responsive element-binding protein H (CREBH, encoded by CREB3L3) is a membrane-bound transcriptional factor that primarily localizes in the liver and small intestine. CREBH governs triglyceride metabolism in the liver, which mediates the changes in gene expression governing fatty acid oxidation, ketogenesis, and apolipoproteins related to lipoprotein lipase (LPL) activation. CREBH in the small intestine reduces cholesterol transporter gene Npc1l1 and suppresses cholesterol absorption from diet. A deficiency of CREBH in mice leads to severe hypertriglyceridemia, fatty liver, and atherosclerosis. CREBH, in synergy with peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor &amp;alpha; (PPAR&amp;alpha;), has a crucial role in upregulating Fgf21 expression, which is implicated in metabolic homeostasis including glucose and lipid metabolism. CREBH binds to and functions as a co-activator for both PPAR&amp;alpha; and liver X receptor alpha (LXR&amp;alpha;) in regulating gene expression of lipid metabolism. Therefore, CREBH has a crucial role in glucose and lipid metabolism in the liver and small intestine.
Neuro D1 is a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor expressed in the endocrine cells of pancreas and in a subset of neurons as they undergo terminal differentiation. In the adult pituitary gland, Neuro D1 is expressed in corticotroph cells and contributes to the corticotroph-specific pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) transcription by interacting with Pituitary homeobox 1 (Ptx 1) transcription factor. In the present study, we investigated the expression of Neuro D1 in human normal pituitaries and different types of human pituitary adenomas using the RT-PCR and immunohistochemical techniques. Using RT-PCR, Neuro D1 mRNA was found to be expressed in ACTH-secreting adenomas (n = 3) and 6 of 8 non-functioning adenomas. On the other hand, GH-secreting adenomas (n = 5) and PRL-secreting adenomas (n = 3) were completely negative for Neuro D1 mRNA. Immunohistochemically, Neuro D1 was expressed in all ACTH-secreting adenomas (n = 10), and in 14 of 20 nonfunctioning adenomas. In contrast, 3 of 10 PRL-secreting adenomas and 2 of 10 GH-secreting adenomas showed positive Neuro D1 staining in the nuclei. The above results suggest that Neuro D1 contribute to the functional expression and the differentiation of ACTH-secreting adenomas. It also appears from our study that Neuro D1 might play a role in the differentiation of non-functioning adenomas, the mechanism of which remains to be further investigated. This is the first study on Neuro D1 in case of human pituitary adenomas.
In mammals, the pituitary POU homeodomain protein, Pit-1, binds to proximal and distal 5'-flanking sequences of the PRL gene that dictate tissue-specific expression. These DNA sequences are highly conserved among mammals but are dramatically different from PRL 5' sequences in the teleost species, Oncorhynchus tschawytscha (chinook salmon). To analyze the molecular basis for pituitary-specific gene expression in a distantly related vertebrate, we transfected CAT reporter gene constructs containing 2.4 kilobases (kb) 5'-flanking sequence from the salmon PRL (sPRL) gene into various cell types. Expression of the sPRL gene was restricted to pituitary cells, but in rat pituitary GH4 cells levels of expression were at least 90-fold lower than those obtained with a -3 kb rat PRL (rPRL) construct. Conversely, in primary teleost pituitary cells, -2.4 kb sPRL/CAT was expressed at levels about 10-fold higher than -3 kb rPRL/CAT. To determine whether species-specific transactivation by Pit-1 was sufficient to explain these species differences in PRL gene expression, we isolated a cDNA clone encoding the salmon Pit-1 POU domain and constructed a rat Pit-1 expression vector that contained salmon Pit-1 POU domain sequences substituted in frame. The chimeric Pit-1 encoded 14 amino acids unique to salmon. Coexpression of rat Pit-1 with salmon or rat PRL/CAT in transfected HeLa cells resulted in specific and strikingly comparable levels of promoter activation. Moreover, the specificity and efficacy of the chimeric salmon/rat Pit-1 was similar to wild type rat Pit-1 in activating salmon and rat PRL/CAT.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
The POU domain protein GHF-1 has a critical role in generation, proliferation and phenotypic expression of three pituitary cell types. GHF-1 functions in part by binding to and transactivating the promoters of both the growth hormone (GH) and prolactin (PRL) genes and that of the GHF1 gene itself. We describe a naturally occurring isoform of GHF-1, GHF-2, in which an additional 26 amino acids are inserted into the activation domain of the protein as a result of alternative splicing. GHF-2 retains the DNA binding activity of GHF-1 and can activate the GH promoter but has lost the ability to activate the PRL and GHF1 promoters. These results suggest that GHF-2 may function in differential target gene activation during differentiation of the somatotrophic lineage. Both GHF-1 and GHF-2 transcripts are specifically expressed in the anterior pituitary. Analysis of the genomic GHF1 gene shows that most of the distinct functional domains of GHF-1 (and GHF-2) are encoded by separate exons. Gene segment duplication and exon shuffling may have contributed to the evolution of this cell type-specific transcriptional regulatory gene.
The correlation of growth hormone (GH) mRNA abundance and expression of specific transcription factors was studied in pituitaries of panhypopituitary (Ames df/df and Snell dwJ/dwJ dwarf), isolated GH-deficient (lit/lit), and GH-overproducing (growth hormone-releasing hormone [GHRH] transgenic) mice compared with normal littermates. A fluorescence-based reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction assay was developed for seven target mRNAs: GH, prolactin (PRL), pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC), alpha-subunit of the glycoprotein hormones (alphaSU), Pit-1, Prop-1, and Zn-16. Amplification parameters for each of these primer pairs were determined in order to calculate initial mRNA transcript number. The reproducibility of the assay was found to be +/-10% for either Pit-1 or Zn-16 mRNAs measured in characterized murine GHFT1-5 somatotroph precursor cells. The cell extracts also showed an increased abundance of both Zn-16 and Pit-1 mRNAs when compared with whole pituitary extracts. Measurement of copy number in normal pituitaries showed that for every 10(6) GH or PRL mRNAs, there were 3 x 10(5) POMC, 4 x 10(4) alphaSU, 2 x 10(3) Pit-1, and only 70 Zn-16 or Prop-1 transcripts. Transcript abundance in GH-altered mice as a percentage of copy number per normal gland showed that POMC was significantly reduced in dwJ/dwJ (p &lt; 0.01) and df/df (p &lt; 0.05) mice. AlphaSU mRNA was reduced in df/df (p &lt; 0.05), dwJ/dwJ (p &lt; 0.05), and lit/lit (p &lt; 0.05) mice, but not in GHRH-excess mice. PRL mRNA was not detected in dwarf mice, reduced to 52% of normal in lit/lit (p &lt; 0.05), and unchanged in GHRH-excess animals. GH mRNA was not detected in dwarf mice, reduced to 1.3% in lit/lit (p &lt; 0.005), and increased to 242% in GHRH-excess mice (p &lt; 0.05). Pit-1 mRNA was not detected in dwarf mice, was 2.9% of normal in lit/lit (p &lt; 0.005) mice, and increased to 200% in GHRH-excess mice (p &lt; 0.05). Prop-1 was not present in dwarf mice, was decreased to 1.4% in lit/lit (p &lt; 0.01), and increased to 223% in GHRH-excess mice (p &lt; 0.05). Zn-16 abundance in df/df mice was significantly reduced (p &lt; 0.05) to 4.8% of normals, to 6.3% of normals in dwJ/dwJ (p &lt; 0.005), to 6.1% of normals in lit/lit (p &lt; 0.005) mice, and significantly elevated in GHRH-excess mice to 197% (p &lt; 0.05). Altered pituitary mRNA abundance was found for several products not previously measured, or thought not to be affected by these mutations. Correlation of GH mRNA abundance with transcription factor copy number showed a significant correlation for Pit-1, Prop-1, and Zn-16. These quantitative analyses provide the first in vivo evidence that Zn-16 mRNA abundance correlates with GH expression.
Phosphatase of regenerating liver 3 (PRL-3) is known to be overexpressed in many tumors, and its transcript level is high in the vasculature and endothelial cells of malignant tumor tissue. However, the mechanism(s) underlying its enhanced expression and its function in endothelial cells remain unknown. Here, we report that vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) can induce PRL-3 transcription in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC). An analysis of its 5'UTR revealed that PRL-3 transcription is initiated from two distinct sites, which results in the formation of the two transcripts, PRL-3-iso1 and PRL-3-iso2, but only the latter is up-regulated in HUVEC by VEGF. The PRL-3-iso2 promoter region includes two functional MEF2 (myocyte enhancer factor2) binding sites. The over-expression of the constitutively active form of MEF2C promotes the abundance of the PRL-3-iso2 transcript in a number of human cell lines. The siRNA-induced knockdown of MEF2C abolished the stimulative effect of VEGF on PRL-3 transcript in HUVEC, indicating that the VEGF-induced promotion of PRL-3 expression requires the presence of MEF2C. Finally, blocking PRL-3 activity or expression suppresses tube formation by HUVEC. We suggest that PRL-3 functions downstream of the VEGF/MEF2C pathway in endothelial cells and may play an important role in tumor angiogenesis.
The molecular events linking lipid accumulation in atherosclerotic plaques to complications such as aneurysm formation and plaque disruption are poorly understood. BALB/c-Apoe(-/-) mice bearing a null mutation in the Npc1 gene display prominent medial erosion and atherothrombosis, whereas their macrophages accumulate free cholesterol in late endosomes and show increased cathepsin K (Ctsk) expression. We now show increased cathepsin K immunostaining and increased cysteinyl proteinase activity using near infrared fluorescence imaging over proximal aortas of Apoe(-/-), Npc1(-/-) mice. In mechanistic studies, cholesterol loading of macrophage plasma membranes (cyclodextrin-cholesterol) or endosomal system (AcLDL+U18666A or Npc1 null mutation) activated Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling, leading to sustained phosphorylation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase and induction of p38 targets, including Ctsk, S100a8, Mmp8, and Mmp14. Studies in macrophages from knockout mice showed major roles for TLR4, following plasma membrane cholesterol loading, and for TLR3, after late endosomal loading. TLR signaling via p38 led to phosphorylation and activation of the transcription factor Microphthalmia transcription factor, acting at E-box elements in the Ctsk promoter. These studies suggest that free cholesterol enrichment of either plasma or endosomal membranes in macrophages leads to activation of signaling via various TLRs, prolonged p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase activation, and induction of Mmps, Ctsk, and S100a8, potentially contributing to plaque complications.
In C. elegans, steroid hormones function in conjunction with insulin/IGF-1-like signaling in promoting reproductive development over entry into the diapausal dauer stage. The NCR-1 and -2 (NPC1-related) intracellular cholesterol transporters function redundantly in preventing dauer arrest, presumably by regulating the availability of substrates for steroid hormone synthesis. We have identified hsd-1 as a new component of this cholesterol trafficking/processing pathway, using an ncr-1 enhancer screen. HSD-1 is orthologous to 3beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase/Delta(5)-Delta(4) isomerases (3beta-HSDs), which are key steroidogenic enzymes in vertebrates, and is exclusively expressed in two neuron-like XXX cells that are crucial in preventing dauer arrest, suggesting that it is involved in biosynthesis of dauer-preventing steroid hormones. The hsd-1 null mutant displays defects in inhibiting dauer arrest: it forms dauers in the deletion mutant backgrounds of ncr-1 or daf-28/insulin; as a single mutant, it is hypersensitive to dauer pheromone. We found that hsd-1 defects can be rescued by feeding mutant animals with several steroid intermediates that are either downstream of or in parallel to the 3beta-HSD function in the dafachronic acid biosynthetic pathway, suggesting that HSD-1 functions as a 3beta-HSD. Interestingly, sterols that rescued hsd-1 defects also bypassed the need for the NCR-1 and/or -2 functions, suggesting that HSD-1-mediated steroid hormone production is an important functional output of the NCR transporters. Finally, we found that the HSD-1-mediated signal activates insulin/IGF-I signaling in a cell non-autonomous fashion, suggesting a novel mechanism for how these two endocrine pathways intersect in directing development.
Dietary and biliary cholesterol are taken up by intestinal epithelial cells and transported to the endoplasmic reticulum. At the endoplasmic reticulum, cholesterol is esterified, packaged into chylomicrons and secreted into the lymph for delivery to the bloodstream. NPC1L1 (Niemann-Pick C1-like 1) is a protein on the enterocyte brush-border membrane that facilitates cholesterol absorption. Cholesterol's itinerary as it moves to the endoplasmic reticulum is unknown, as is the identity of any cellular proteins that facilitate the movement. Two proteins that play an important role in intracellular cholesterol transport and could potentially influence NPC1L1-mediated cholesterol uptake are NPC1 and NPC2 (Niemann-Pick type C disease proteins 1 and 2). In this issue of the Biochemical Journal, Dixit and colleagues show that the absence or presence of NPC1 and NPC2 has no effect on intestinal cholesterol absorption in the mouse. Thus neither protein fills the gap in our knowledge of intra-enterocyte cholesterol transport. Furthermore, the NPC1/NPC2 pathway would not be a good target for limiting the uptake of dietary cholesterol.
The 3beta-(2-diethylaminoethoxy)-androstenone HCl (U18666A), progesterone and several cationic amphiphilic drugs have been shown to alter the trafficking of a number of intracellular membrane proteins including CD63/Lamp-3, insulin growth factor 2/mannose 6-phosphate receptor (IGF2/MPR), and the Niemann-Pick C1 gene product (NPC1) as well as ganglioside GM1. We have examined the effects of these compounds on cultured melanocytes at concentrations that have been shown to effectively alter intracellular trafficking. Treatment of melanocytes with U18666A (2.5 micro M) or progesterone (15 micro M) for 96 h decreased melanin content an average of 67% as compared with control without lowering the total cellular tyrosinase activity. Steroidal alkaloids that preferentially act on the Sonic Hedgehog signaling pathway showed no related specificity in their ability to decrease pigmentation. In melanocytes treated with U18666A, tyrosinase accumulates in a compartment that contains both lysosome-associated membrane protein-1 (Lamp 1) and MPR, and stains with filipin, consistent with cholesterol-laden late endosomes/lysosomes. Our results suggest that tyrosinase, like the NPC1 gene product, traverses a U18666A-sensitive trafficking pathway.
Niemann-Pick disease is a genetic disorder, affecting approximately 1 to 150,000 living births per year; in Poland 1-5 cases. Usually diagnosed in the childhood, Niemann-Pick disease results in death in the teenage years. Niemann-Pick disease is defined as a lysosomal storage disorder and is related to impaired transport and/or accumulation of specific lipids inside the cell. In this report, we provide evidence about potential role of annexins, calcium- and membrane-binding proteins, in the formation and stabilization of cholesterol-rich microdomains and their possible function in organizing the membranes of early and late endosomes, organelles affected in the type C Niemann-Pick disease characterized by abnormal accumulation of cholesterol and glycosphingolipids in lysosomal like organelles.
While the autophagic process is mainly regulated at the post-translational level, a growing body of evidence suggests that autophagy might also be regulated at the transcriptional level. The identification of transcription factors involved in the regulation of autophagy genes has provided compelling evidence for such regulation. In this context, a powerful high throughput analysis tool to simultaneously monitor the expression level of autophagy genes is urgently needed. Here we describe setting up the first comprehensive human autophagy database (HADb, available at www.autophagy.lu) and the development of a companion Human Autophagy-dedicated cDNA Microarray which comprises 234 genes involved in or related to autophagy. The autophagy microarray tool used on breast adenocarcinoma MCF-7 cell line allowed the identification of 47 differentially expressed autophagy genes associated with the acquisition of resistance to the cytotoxic effect of TNFα. The autophagy-core machinery genes DRAM (Damage-Regulated Autophagy Modulator), BNIP3L (BCL2/adenovirus E1B 19 kDa interacting protein 3-like), BECN1 (Beclin 1), GABARAP (Gamma-AminoButyric Acid Receptor-Associated Protein) and UVRAG (UV radiation resistance associated gene) were found upregulated in TNF-resistant cells, suggesting a constitutive activation of the autophagy machinery in these cells. More interestingly, we identified NPC1 as the most upregulated genes in TNF-resistant compared to TNF-sensitive MCF-7 cells, suggesting a relation between the intracellular transport of cholesterol, the regulation of autophagy and NPC1 expression in TNF-resistant tumor cells. In conclusion, we describe here new tools that may help investigating autophagy gene regulation in various cellular models and diseases.
The transmembrane protein Niemann-Pick C1 Like 1 (NPC1L1) belongs to the Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1) family of cholesterol transporters and is mainly expressed in the liver and the small intestine. NPC1L1 is believed to be the main transporter responsible for the absorption of dietary cholesterol. Like NPC1, NPC1L1 contains a sterol sensing domain, suggesting that it might be sensitive to dietary cholesterol. To test this hypothesis, mucosal explants were cultured in the presence or absence of cholesterol. In the absence of cholesterol NPC1L1 was localized mainly in the brush border of the enterocyte, colocalizing with the brush border enzyme aminopeptidase N (APN), and only a minor part was present in intracellular compartments. In contrast, following culture in the presence of cholesterol a major part of NPC1L1 was found in intracellular compartments positive for the early endosomal marker early endosome antigen 1, whereas only a minor fraction was left in the brush border. Neither APN, lactase, nor sucrase-isomaltase was endocytosed in parallel, demonstrating that this is a selective cholesterol-induced endocytosis of NPC1L1. Conceivably either the induced internalization could be due to NPC1L1 acting as an endocytic cholesterol receptor or it could be a mechanism to reduce the cholesterol uptake. The fluorescent cholesterol analog NBD-cholesterol readily labeled the cytoplasm also under conditions nonpermissible for endocytosis, arguing against a receptor-mediated uptake. We therefore propose that cholesterol is absorbed by NPC1L1 acting as a membrane transporter and that NPC1L1 is internalized to an endosomal compartment to reduce the absorption of cholesterol.
In the context of the global prevalence of vitamin D insufficiency, we compared two key determinants of the bioavailability of 3 vitamin D forms with significant biopotencies: cholecalciferol, 25-hydroxycholecalciferol and 1-α-hydroxycholecalciferol. To this aim, we studied their incorporation into synthetic mixed micelles and their uptake by intestinal cells in culture. Our results show that 1-α-hydroxycholecalciferol was significantly more solubilized into mixed micelles compared to the other forms (1.6-fold and 2.9-fold improvement compared to cholecalciferol and 25-hydroxycholecalciferol, respectively). In Caco-2 TC7 cells, the hydroxylated forms were taken up more efficiently than cholecalciferol (p &lt; 0.05), and conversely to cholecalciferol, their uptake was neither SR-BI(Scavenger-Receptor class B type I)- nor NPC1L1 (NPC1 like intracellular cholesterol transporter 1)-dependent. Besides, the apical membrane sodium-bile acid transporter ASBT (Apical Sodium-dependent Bile acid Transporter) was not involved, at least in vitro, in the uptake of any of the three vitamin D forms. Further investigations are needed to identify the uptake pathways of both 1-α-hydroxycholecalciferol and 25-hydroxycholecalciferol. However, considering its high bioavailability, our results suggest the potential interest of using 1-α-hydroxycholecalciferol in the treatment of severe vitamin D deficiency.
Human adenoviruses (Ads) generally cause mild self-limiting infections but can lead to serious disease and even be fatal in high-risk individuals, underscoring the importance of understanding how the virus counteracts host defense mechanisms. This study had two goals. First, we wished to determine the molecular basis of cholesterol homeostatic responses induced by the early region 3 membrane protein RIDα via its direct interaction with the sterol-binding protein ORP1L, a member of the evolutionarily conserved family of oxysterol-binding protein (OSBP)-related proteins (ORPs). Second, we wished to determine how this interaction regulates innate immunity to adenovirus. ORP1L is known to form highly dynamic contacts with endoplasmic reticulum-resident VAP proteins that regulate late endosome function under regulation of Rab7-GTP. Our studies have demonstrated that ORP1L-VAP complexes also support transport of LDL-derived cholesterol from endosomes to the endoplasmic reticulum, where it was converted to cholesteryl esters stored in lipid droplets when ORP1L was bound to RIDα. The virally induced mechanism counteracted defects in the predominant cholesterol transport pathway regulated by the late endosomal membrane protein Niemann-Pick disease type C protein 1 (NPC1) arising during early stages of viral infection. However, unlike NPC1, RIDα did not reconstitute transport to endoplasmic reticulum pools that regulate SREBP transcription factors. RIDα-induced lipid trafficking also attenuated proinflammatory signaling by Toll-like receptor 4, which has a central role in Ad pathogenesis and is known to be tightly regulated by cholesterol-rich "lipid rafts." Collectively, these data show that RIDα utilizes ORP1L in a way that is distinct from its normal function in uninfected cells to fine-tune lipid raft cholesterol that regulates innate immunity to adenovirus in endosomes.IMPORTANCE Early region 3 proteins encoded by human adenoviruses that attenuate immune-mediated pathology have been a particularly rich source of information regarding intracellular protein trafficking. Our studies with the early region 3-encoded RIDα protein also provided fundamental new information regarding mechanisms of nonvesicular lipid transport and the flow of molecular information at membrane contacts between different organelles. We describe a new pathway that delivers cholesterol from endosomes to the endoplasmic reticulum, where it is esterified and stored in lipid droplets. Although lipid droplets are attracting renewed interest from the standpoint of normal physiology and human diseases, including those resulting from viral infections, experimental model systems for evaluating how and why they accumulate are still limited. Our studies also revealed an intriguing relationship between lipid droplets and innate immunity that may represent a new paradigm for viruses utilizing these organelles.
Niemann-Pick type C1 disease (NPC1) is a rare progressive neurodegenerative disorder caused by mutations in the NPC1 gene. In this lysosomal storage disorder the intracellular transport and sequestration of several lipids like cholesterol is severely impaired, resulting in an accumulation of lipids in late endosomes and lysosomes. The neurological manifestation of the disease is caused by dysfunction and cell death in the central nervous system. Several animal models were used to analyze the impaired pathways. However, the underlying pathogenic mechanisms are still not completely understood and the genetic variability in humans cannot be reflected in these models. Therefore, a human model using patient-specific induced pluripotent stem cells provides a promising approach.
We reprogrammed human fibroblasts from a NPC1 patient and a healthy control by retroviral transduction with Oct4, Klf4, Sox2 and c-Myc. The obtained human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) were characterized by immunocytochemical analyses. Neural progenitor cells were generated and patch clamp recordings were performed for a functional analysis of derived neuronal cells. Filipin stainings and the Amplex Red assay were used to demonstrate and quantify cholesterol accumulation.
The hiPSCs expressed different stem cell markers, e.g. Nanog, Tra-1-81 and SSEA4. Using the embryoid body assay, the cells were differentiated in cells of all three germ layers and induced teratoma in immunodeficient mice, demonstrating their pluripotency. In addition, neural progenitor cells were derived and differentiated into functional neuronal cells. Patch clamp recordings revealed voltage dependent channels, spontaneous action potentials and postsynaptic currents. The accumulation of cholesterol in different tissues is the main hallmark of NPC1. In this study we found an accumulation of cholesterol in fibroblasts of a NPC1 patient, derived hiPSCs, and neural progenitor cells, but not in cells derived from fibroblasts of a healthy individual. These findings were quantified by the Amplex Red assay, demonstrating a significantly elevated cholesterol level in cells derived from fibroblasts of a NPC1 patient.
We generated a neuronal model based on induced pluripotent stem cells derived from patient fibroblasts, providing a human in vitro model to study the pathogenic mechanisms of NPC1 disease.
Niemann-Pick type C disease (NPC) is a rare, neurovisceral, autosomal recessive disease, with an extremely heterogeneous clinical presentation. The adult form of the disease is usually expressed as a neurological form. Non-specific psychiatric symptoms are often associated with NPC. For some cases, it can also be expressed as an isolated psychiatric disorder form. Since 2009, the launching of a medicine called miglustat has helped to improve the disease evolution.
We report two siblings followed-up in the same department of psychiatry and with an atypical psychotic symptomatology. Case 1 is a 27-year-old French male. He was hospitalised several times due to disordered behaviour, psychomotor excitation, mood instability and wandering. He was originally diagnosed with schizophrenia. However, the patient's psychosis proved refractory to treatment. He also exhibited a number of neurological signs (pyramidal signs and abnormal movements of the hands, head and limbs), which were considered related to his antipsychotic medication. Three years later, a full physical, neurological and neuropsychological examination revealed various neurological and visceral symptoms. He was diagnosed with NPC based on a classical biochemical NPC-phenotype following filipin staining in cultured skin fibroblasts. NPC1 gene sequencing revealed that he was a compound heterozygote for the p.S954L and p.N1156S mutations. The patient's psychiatric and neurological symptoms are currently stabilized by miglustat, allowing the patient to cease antipsychotic medication. Case 2 is the elder sister of Case 1. She was hospitalised several times due to acute delirium, hallucinations and suicidal tendencies. She was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia at 22 years of age. She has received a variety of typical and atypical antipsychotics. Many of these drugs proved initially effective but the patient's symptoms repeatedly returned. The patient shows persistent and worsening gait disorder and abnormal arm movements. A follow-up neurological examination at age 29 did not detect any ataxia, cataplexy or vertical supra-nuclear gaze palsy. Direct NPC1 gene sequencing detected a mutant NPC1 allele held in common with her brother, but full sequencing of both the NPC1 and NPC2 genes and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) did not detect any other pathogenic mutation or other anomalies.
Because NPC is an autosomal recessive condition, heterozygous individuals carrying only one causal gene mutation are usually asymptomatic. Thus, while the accepted wisdom would suggest that patient 2 is not affected by the disease, it is interesting to consider why she has developed neurological and psychiatric disorders like her brother. Several hypotheses are discussed: mental expression in heterozygous genetic factor predisposing to schizophrenia, comorbidity or fortuitous association. It is not currently known whether a patient with a single NPC gene mutation can express NPC in full, partially, or perhaps just to a minimal degree. This case of a patient with a heterozygous "carrier" NPC genotype and neuropsychiatric disorders suggestive of the disease raises the possibility that symptomatic heterozygous NPC patients may exist. On the other hand, if the heterozygous genotype of patient 2 does not give rise to symptomatic disease, it is pertinent to question whether it could be a predisposing factor for the development of psychiatric pathologies. There are currently no published data on the occurrence of heterozygous NPC1 or NPC2 mutations among patients with atypical psychiatric presentations combined with neurological symptoms. Conversely, there are no published data demonstrating an increased frequency of psychiatric disorders in families affected by NPC. Finally, in view of the history of psychiatric disorders in this family, it is possible that psychosis simply occurred concomitantly with symptomatic NPC in patient 1 by chance, and that schizophrenia occurred simultaneously with an asymptomatic NPC carrier genotype in patient 2. To investigate this further, NPC patients' carrier family members (parents and siblings) should be fully screened for signs suggestive of the disease.
We have previously shown that decreased dosage of Niemann-Pick C1 (Npc1) protein, caused by heterozygosity at the null mutation, Npc1 (nih), locus, causes altered lipid metabolism in mice. When studied on the "lean" BALB/cJ genetic background, the decreased protein was associated with no weight changes in either males or females when on a regular diet but increased weights and adiposity when on a high fat diet Jelinek et al. (Obesity 18: 1457-1459, 2010, Gene 491:128-134, 2012). When the heterozygotes were studied on a mixed C57BL/6J, BALB/cJ background, increased weight and adiposity were also found on a regular diet (sexes pooled Jelinek et al. [Hum Molec Genet 20:312-321, 2011]). We find somewhat different results when the hypomorphic Npc1 mutation, Npc1 (nmf164), is studied on a pure C57BL/6J, "metabolic syndrome" genetic background with male, but not female, heterozygotes having lower weights on the regular diet. The result does not seem to be due to the difference in the two mutations as heterozygous Npc1 (nmf164) mice on the BALB/cJ background acted like the null mutant heterozygotes. Studies of glucose tolerance, liver enzymes, liver triglycerides and fat deposition, and adipose tissue caveolin 1 levels did not disclose reasons for these differing results.
Niemann-Pick type C disease (NPC) is a rare hereditary disease, which psychiatrists do not face often in France. Indeed, only a couple of articles specifically describing the psychiatric-disorders in the adult form have been published. And for the most part, they were not written by psychiatrists. This comprehensive international literature review aims at providing knowledge on this disease to French psychiatrists.
To achieve this literature review, we used the "PubMed" search engine, looking for the following keywords: Niemann-Pick type C AND (schizophrenia OR psychosis).
Niemann-Pick type C disease (NPC) is a rare, neurovisceral, autosomal recessive disease, with an extremely heterogeneous clinical presentation. It is characterized by a wide range of symptoms that are not specific, such as neurological, systemic or psychiatric symptoms. The adult form of the disease concerns a small proportion (5 %) of the people affected and is usually expressed as a neurological form. A variety of progressive and disabling symptoms are encountered, mainly cerebellar signs (cerebellar ataxia, impaired gait, dysarthria), but also movement disorders, cataplexy, seizures and dysphagia. Patients face constant cognitive deterioration, which can result in severe dementia. Abnormal saccadic eye movement is often the first manifestation of the disease. Supranuclear gaze palsy is considered to be a specific sign and should be systematically searched for. In terms of systemic signs, the usual infantile hepatosplenomegaly is very fickle in the adult form; if present, it is usually asymptomatic. Non-specific psychiatric symptoms are often associated with NPC disease. For one third of cases, it can also express as an isolated psychiatric-disorder form, such as schizophrenia-like psychosis (paranoid delusions, auditory hallucinations, interpretative thoughts, and disorganization), depression, bipolar disorder, obsessive-compulsive behaviour and behavioural problems (sleep disorders, hyperactivity, agitation, aggressiveness or self-mutilations). This psychiatric overview is mostly atypical and is accompanied by visual hallucinations, confusion, symptom fluctuations, treatment resistance or aggravation with neuroleptic drugs, catatonia, progressive cognitive decline, but also seizures. The late appearance of neurological manifestations is often wrongfully attributed to the effects of antipsychotic medication, which generates tardy diagnosis. Most of NPC affected patients die prematurely. NPC diagnosis is based on a filipin test on a fibroblast culture from a skin biopsy and also on a sequencing of the NPC1 and NPC2 genes. Routine laboratory biochemistry profiles are generally normal. The early diagnosis is fundamental to deploy the best follow-up care. The patient should therefore be in contact with a reference centre. Until recently, NPC treatment consisted in supportive therapies and symptomatic drugs, useful, however, with variable efficacy. The recent discovery of a medicine called Miglustat (N-butyldeoxynojirimycin; NB-DJN; Zavesca(®), Actelion Pharmaceuticals Ltd.) which improves the disease evolution, should encourage psychiatrists to look for it in every atypical psychosis.
Niemann-Pick disease type C (NPC) is an inherited metabolic disorder; due to defect in cellular cholesterol trafficking. It is clinically a heterogeneous disease with variable age of onset with multiple organ systems being involved. NPC1 gene is involved in 95% cases where as remaining ~5% cases are linked with NPC2 gene.
Case-1, a 14-months-old female presented with recurrent respiratory distress, failure to thrive and hepatosplenomegaly. Lung biopsy was suggestive of alveolar proteinosis and liver biopsy confirmed foamy macrophages. Molecular analysis revealed homozygous mutation c.141C &gt; A in exon 2 of NPC2 gene. Case-2, a 3-year-old male presented with dyspnoea and hepatomegaly noticed at 1 year of age. HRCT-scan of thoracic region showed consolidation with mediastinal lymphadenopathy. Broncho-alveolar lavage revealed moderate amount of foamy macrophages and bone marrow examination detected foam cells. Homozygous T &gt; C transition in intron 1 of the NPC2 gene was identified.
Our study demonstrates that NPC2 can present in early years of life with pulmonary complications like alveolar proteinosis and hepatosplenomegaly or hepatomegaly due to mutation in NPC2 gene. An early suspicion will help clinicians to clinch its diagnosis, management and genetic counselling.
Misexpression of the AtNPC1 - 1 and AtNPC1 - 2 genes leads to altered sphingolipid metabolism, growth impairment, and male reproductive defects in a hemizygous Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) double-mutant population. Abolishing the expression of both gene copies has lethal effects. Niemann-Pick disease type C1 is a lysosomal storage disorder caused by mutations in the NPC1 gene. At the cellular level, the disorder is characterized by the accumulation of storage lipids and lipid trafficking defects. The Arabidopsis thaliana genome contains two genes (At1g42470 and At4g38350) with weak homology to mammalian NPC1. The corresponding proteins have 11 predicted membrane-spanning regions and contain a putative sterol-sensing domain. The At1g42470 protein is localized to the plasma membrane, while At4g38350 protein has a dual localization in the plasma and tonoplast membranes. A phenotypic analysis of T-DNA insertion mutants indicated that At1g42470 and At4g38350 (designated AtNPC1-1 and AtNPC1-2, respectively) have partially redundant functions and are essential for plant reproductive viability and development. Homozygous plants impaired in the expression of both genes were not recoverable. Plants of a hemizygous AtNPC1-1/atnpc1-1/atnpc1-2/atnpc1-2 population were severely dwarfed and exhibited male gametophytic defects. These gene disruptions did not have an effect on sterol concentrations; however, hemizygous AtNPC1-1/atnpc1-1/atnpc1-2/atnpc1-2 mutants had increased fatty acid amounts. Among these, fatty acid α-hydroxytetracosanoic acid (h24:0) occurs in plant sphingolipids. Follow-up analyses confirmed the accumulation of significantly increased levels of sphingolipids (assayed as hydrolyzed sphingoid base component) in the hemizygous double-mutant population. Certain effects of NPC1 misexpression may be common across divergent lineages of eukaryotes (sphingolipid accumulation), while other defects (sterol accumulation) may occur only in certain groups of eukaryotic organisms.
Niemann-Pick type C disease (NPCD) is an autosomal recessive storage disorder, characterized by abnormal sequestration of unesterified cholesterol within the late endo-lysosomal compartment of cells. In the central nervous system, hypoxic insults could result in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) oxidation and Lectin-like oxidized LDL receptor-1 (LOX-1) induction, leading to a pathological hippocampal response, namely, ischemic long-term potentiation (i-LTP). These events may correlate with the progressive neural loss observed in NPCD. To test these hypotheses, hippocampal slices from Wild Type (WT) and NPC1-/- mice were prepared, and field potential in the CA1 region was analyzed during transient oxygen/glucose deprivation (OGD). Moreover, LOX-1 expression was evaluated by RT-qPCR, immunocytochemical, and Western blot analyses before and after an anoxic episode. Our results demonstrate the development of a precocious i-LTP in NPC1-/- mice during OGD application. We also observed a higher expression of LOX-1 transcript and protein in NPC1-/- mice with respect to WT mice; after anoxic damage to LOX-1 expression, a further increase in both NPC1-/- and WT mice was observed, although the protein expression seems to be delayed, suggesting a different kinetic of induction. These data clearly suggest an elevated susceptibility to neurodegeneration in NPC1-/- mice due to oxidative stress. The observed up-regulation of LOX-1 in the hippocampus of NPC1-/- mice may also open a new scenario in which new biomarkers can be identified.
The role of ezetimibe in lowering plasma cholesterol has been established; however, controversy remains about its clinical benefit. A recent study utilizes naturally occurring genetic variation within the NPC1-like 1 gene (NPC1L1) to demonstrate the potential for pharmacologic inhibition of the protein to reduce the risk of coronary heart disease. This research demonstrates the application of the concept of genocopy to a population-based validation of NPC1L1 as a therapeutic target. 
Synthetic systems are widely used to unveil the molecular mechanisms of complex cellular events. Artificial membranes are key examples of models employed to address lipid-lipid and lipid-protein interactions. In this work, we developed a new synthetic system that more closely resembles the lysosome - the lysosome-mimicking vesicles (LMVs) - displaying stable acid-to-neutral pH gradient across the membrane. To evaluate the advantages of this synthetic system, we assessed the distinct effects of sphingosine (Sph) accumulation in membrane structure and biophysical properties of standard liposomes (no pH gradient) and in LMVs with lipid composition tuned to mimic physiological- or NPC1-like lysosomes. Ternary 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC)/Sphingomyelin (SM)/Cholesterol (Chol) mixtures with, respectively, low and high Chol/SM levels were prepared. The effect of Sph on membrane permeability and biophysical properties was evaluated by fluorescence spectroscopy, electrophoretic and dynamic light scattering. The results showed that overall Sph has the ability to cause a shift in vesicle surface charge, increase membrane order and promote a rapid increase in membrane permeability. These effects are enhanced in NPC1- LMVs. The results suggest that lysosomal accumulation of these lipids, as observed under pathological conditions, might significantly affect lysosomal membrane structure and integrity, and therefore contribute to the impairment of cell function.
Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) lyase irreversibly cleaves S1P, thereby catalysing the ultimate step of sphingolipid degradation. We show here that embryonic fibroblasts from S1P lyase-deficient mice (Sgpl1-/--MEFs), in which S1P and sphingosine accumulate, have features of Niemann-Pick disease type C (NPC) cells. In the presence of serum, overall cholesterol content was elevated in Sgpl1-/--MEFs, due to upregulation of the LDL receptor and enhanced cholesterol uptake. Despite this, activation of sterol regulatory element-binding protein-2 was increased in Sgpl1-/--MEFs, indicating a local lack of cholesterol at the ER. Indeed, free cholesterol was retained in NPC1-containing vesicles, which is a hallmark of NPC. Furthermore, upregulation of amyloid precursor protein in Sgpl1-/--MEFs was mimicked by an NPC1 inhibitor in Sgpl1+/+-MEFs and reduced by overexpression of NPC1. Lysosomal pH was not altered by S1P lyase deficiency, similar to NPC. Interestingly, lysosomal Ca2+ content and bafilomycin A1-induced [Ca2+]i increases were enhanced in Sgpl1-/--MEFs, contrary to NPC. These results show that both a primary defect in cholesterol trafficking and S1P lyase deficiency cause overlapping phenotypic alterations, and challenge the present view on the role of sphingosine in lysosomal Ca2+ homeostasis.
Niemann-Pick type C (NPC) disease, characterized by intracellular accumulation of unesterified cholesterol and other lipids owing to defects in two proteins NPC1 and NPC2, causes neurodegeneration and other fatal neurovisceral symptoms. Currently, treatment of NPC involves the use of 2-hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin (HP-β-CD). HP-β-CD is effective in the treatment of hepatosplenomegaly in NPC disease, albeit at a very high dose. One of the methods to reduce the required dose of HP-β-CD for treatment of NPC is to actively targeting hepatocytes with β-cyclodextrin (β-CD). The aim of the present study was to synthesize a novel multi-lactose-appended β-CD (multi-Lac-β-CD) and to evaluate its cholesterol-lowering effect in U18666A-treated HepG2 (NPC-like HepG2) cells. Further, the study aimed at delivering β-CD to hepatocytes via cholesterol-accumulated HepG2 cells, and indicated that the newly synthesized multi-Lac-β-CD had an average degree of substitution of lactose (DSL) of 5.6. This newly synthesized multi-Lac-β-CD was found to significantly decrease the concentration of intracellular cholesterol with negligible cytotoxicity as compared to HP-β-CD. An increased internalization of TRITC-multi-Lac-β-CD (DSL 5.6) as compared to TRITC-HP-β-CD was observed in NPC-like HepG2 cells. Further, the dissociation constant of peanut lectin with multi-Lac-β-CD (DSL5.6) was found to be extremely low (2.5 × 10-8 M). These results indicate that multi-Lac-β-CD (DSL5.6) diminished intracellular cholesterol levels in NPC-like HepG2 cells via asialoglycoprotein receptor (ASGPR)-mediated endocytosis.
Niemann-Pick disease type C (NPC) is a rare autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disorder, which manifests clinically with a wide range of neurological signs and symptoms. We assessed multiple neurological, neuropsychological and neurophysiological biomarkers using a transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) multi-paradigm approach in two patients with NPC carrying a homozygous mutation in the NPC1 gene, and in two heterozygous family members.We assessed short-interval intracortical inhibition (SICI), intracortical facilitation (ICF), long-interval intracortical inhibition (LICI), short-latency afferent inhibition (SAI) and long-term potentiation (LTP)-like cortical plasticity with a paired associative stimulation (PAS) protocol.Baseline SAI and LTP-like plasticity were impaired in both patients with NPC and in the symptomatic heterozygous NPC1 gene mutation carrier. Only a limited decrease in SICI and ICF was observed, while LICI was within normal range in all subjects at baseline. After 12 months of treatment with miglustat, a considerable improvement in SAI and LTP-like plasticity was observed in both patients with NPC. In conclusion, these biomarkers could help to confirm the diagnosis of NPC, and may give an indication of prognostic outcomes in pharmacological trials.
Phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate 5-kinase (PIKfyve) is a lipid kinase involved in endosome maturation that emerged from a haploid genetic screen as being required for Ebola virus (EBOV) infection. Here we analyzed the effects of apilimod, a PIKfyve inhibitor that was reported to be well tolerated in humans in phase 2 clinical trials, for its effects on entry and infection of EBOV and Marburg virus (MARV). We first found that apilimod blocks infections by EBOV and MARV in Huh 7, Vero E6 and primary human macrophage cells, with notable potency in the macrophages (IC50, 10 nM). We next observed that similar doses of apilimod block EBOV-glycoprotein-virus like particle (VLP) entry and transcription-replication competent VLP infection, suggesting that the primary mode of action of apilimod is as an entry inhibitor, preventing release of the viral genome into the cytoplasm to initiate replication. After providing evidence that the anti-EBOV action of apilimod is via PIKfyve, we showed that it blocks trafficking of EBOV VLPs to endolysosomes containing Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1), the intracellular receptor for EBOV. Concurrently apilimod caused VLPs to accumulate in early endosome antigen 1-positive endosomes. We did not detect any effects of apilimod on bulk endosome acidification, on the activity of cathepsins B and L, or on cholesterol export from endolysosomes. Hence by antagonizing PIKfyve, apilimod appears to block EBOV trafficking to its site of fusion and entry into the cytoplasm. Given the drug's observed anti-filoviral activity, relatively unexplored mechanism of entry inhibition, and reported tolerability in humans, we propose that apilimod be further explored as part of a therapeutic regimen to treat filoviral infections.
Interest in using herbal medicines to treat the hypercholesterolemia is increasing. Cranberry extract could decrease plasma cholesterol, however, the active ingredients and the underlying mechanisms remain largely unknown.
The present study was to test the hypothesis that cranberry anthocyanins (CrA) were at least one of the active ingredients responsible for the cholesterol-lowering activity of cranberry fruits via a mechanism of increasing fecal sterol excretion.
Forty-four hamsters were randomly divided into five groups and fed one of the five diets, namely a non-cholesterol control diet (NCD), a high-cholesterol control diet (HCD), a HCD diet supplemented with a low dose of 1% CrA (CL), a HCD diet supplemented with a high dose of 2% CrA (CH), and a HCD diet supplemented with 0.5% cholestyramine as a positive control drug (P-CTL), respectively, for six weeks. Plasma lipoprotein cholesterol was quantified using the enzymatic kits, while the gene expressions of transporters, enzymes and receptors involved in cholesterol absorption and metabolism were quantified using the quantitative RT-PCR. Fecal sterols were quantified using gas chromatography (GC).
Plasma total cholesterol and aorta atherosclerotic plaque decreased dose-dependently with the increasing amounts of CrA added into diets. This was accompanied by a dose-dependent increase in excretion of both neutral and acidic sterols. CrA had no effect on the mRNA levels of intestinal Niemann-Pick C1 like 1 protein (NPC1L1), acyl CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase2 (ACAT2), microsomal triacylglycerol transport protein (MTP), and ATP binding cassette transporter 5 (ABCG5) as well as hepatic cholesterol-7α-hydroxylase (CYP7A1), 3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl reductase (HMG-CoA-R), sterol regulatory element binding protein 2 (SREBP2), LDL receptor (LDL-R), and Liver X receptor alpha (LXRα).
CrA as an herbal medicine could favorably modify the lipoprotein profile in hamsters fed a high cholesterol diet by enhancing excretion of fecal neutral and acidic sterols, most likely not mediated by interaction with genes of transporters, enzymes and proteins involved in cholesterol absorption and metabolism.
The aim of the study was to investigate how the dietary sterol composition, including cholesterol, phytosterol:cholesterol ratio and phytosterols, affect the absorption, biliary excretion, retention, tissue storage and distribution of cholesterol and individual phytosterols in Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.). A feeding trial was conducted at two different temperatures (6 and 12°C), using nine different diets with varying contents of phytosterols, cholesterol and phytosterol:cholesterol ratio. Cholesterol retention values were clearly dependent on dietary cholesterol, and showed that fish fed cholesterol levels &lt;1000 mg/kg feed produced considerable quantities of cholesterol de novo. Despite this production, cholesterol content increased with increasing dietary cholesterol in liver, plasma, bile, muscle, adipose tissue and whole fish at 12°C, and in plasma, bile and whole fish at 6°C. The tissue sterol composition generally depended on the dietary cholesterol content and on the dietary phytosterol:cholesterol ratio, but not on the dietary phytosterol content in itself. Campesterol and brassicasterol appeared to be the phytosterols with the highest intestinal absorption in Atlantic salmon. There was a high biliary excretion of campesterol, but not of brassicasterol, which accumulated in tissues and particularly in adipose tissue, with 2-fold-higher retention at 12°C compared with 6°C. Campesterol had the second highest retention of the phytosterols in the fish, but with no difference between the two temperatures. Other phytosterols had very low retention. Although brassicasterol retention decreased with increasing dietary phytosterols, campesterol retention decreased with increasing dietary cholesterol, indicating differences in the uptake mechanisms for these two sterols.
To discuss recent insights into the measurement and cellular basis of transintestinal cholesterol excretion (TICE) in humans and to explore TICE as a therapeutic target for increasing reverse cholesterol transport.
TICE is the net effect of cholesterol excretion by the enterocyte into the intestinal lumen and is the balance between input and output fluxes through the enterocytes. These fluxes are: cholesterol excretion into the intestinal lumen mainly via ATP-binding cassette (ABC) G5/8, cholesterol absorption from the intestine by Niemann-Pick C1 like protein 1, the uptake of plasma lipoproteins by enterocytes at the basolateral membrane, and the excretion of cholesterol in chylomicrons into the lymph. Multiple studies have shown that TICE contributes to fecal neutral sterol (FNS) excretion in humans. TICE can be targeted with plant sterols, liver X receptor agonists, bile acids, ezetimibe, and proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 inhibitors.
TICE contributes significantly to FNS excretion in humans, independently of the biliary pathway. Knowledge about its underlying cellular mechanisms surges through in-vivo and in-vitro studies in mice and humans. TICE might be an interesting therapeutic target for increasing cholesterol disposal with the feces. Albeit multiple therapeutic options are available, studies showing clinical benefit are still needed.
Saponins identified from fenugreek (Trigonella foenum-graecum) seeds are reported effective on dyslipidemia. However, the definite mechanism is still not elucidated systematically. In this study, we evaluate the effects of saponin extract on cholesterol absorption, metabolism, synthesis, and reverse cholesterol transport in vivo.
Saponin extract was prepared according to a craft established in our previous study. After the establishment of dyslipidemia model, 40 male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into five groups, namely the control group (normal diet plus normal saline), HFD group (high fat diet plus normal saline), Lipitor group (high fat diet plus Lipitor (2 mg/kg)), and L, M, and H-saponin groups (high fat diet plus saponin in dosages of 6, 12, and 24 mg/kg, respectively). Rats were sacrificed at the end of the 9th week after treatment. Biochemical characteristics of rats were tested, histopathological sections of liver tissue were observed, and the protein and mRNA expression of related factors of cholesterol in the intestine and liver were determined. One-way ANOVA test (SPSS software version 11.5, Chicago, IL, USA) was used to determine statistically significant differences between the HFD and other groups.
In saponin groups, the serum lipid, bile acid efflux, anti-peroxide activities, and lipid area of liver tissue improved. Cholesterol 7alpha-hydroxylase and scavenger receptor class B type I elevated in the liver. 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase levels were suppressed in both the serum and liver. However, significant cholesterol efflux was not found and Niemann-Pick C1-Like 1 levels elevated in the intestine.
The mechanisms of saponin in Fenugreek effect on ameliorating dyslipidemia are probably related to accelerated cholesterol metabolism, inhibited cholesterol synthesis, and facilitated reverse cholesterol transport, but not cholesterol absorption.
Lysosomal acid lipase deficiency is an autosomal recessive metabolic disease with a wide range of severity from Wolman Disease to Cholesterol Ester Storage Disease. Recently enzyme replacement therapy with sebelipase alpha has been approved by drug agencies for treatment of this lysosomal disease. Ezetimibe is an azetidine derivative which blocks Niemann Pick C1-Like 1 Protein; as its consequence, plasmatic concentration of low density lipoproteins and other apoB-containing lipoproteins, that are the substrate of lysosomal acid lipase, are decreased. Furthermore, ezetimibe acts by blocking inflammasome activation which is the cause of liver fibrosis in steatohepatitis and in lysosomal storage diseases.
Two patients with Cholesterol Ester Storage Disease were treated with ezetimibe for 9 years and a third patients for 10 years. Treatment was supplemented with low dose of atorvastatin in the first two patients during the last 6 years. All patients showed a significant reduction of alanine aminotransferase, cholesterol and triglyceride. Furthermore, no progression of liver fibrosis was demonstrated.
In this observational case series, ezetimibe is effective, safe, and sustainable treatment for lysosomal acid lipase deficiency. Further studies are warranted to demonstrate that ezetimibe is an alternative therapy to enzyme replacement therapy.
Niemann-Pick Type C (NPC) is a progressive and life limiting autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations in either the NPC1 or NPC2 gene. Mutations in these genes are associated with abnormal endosomal-lysosomal trafficking, resulting in the accumulation of multiple tissue specific lipids in the lysosomes. The clinical spectrum of NPC disease ranges from a neonatal rapidly progressive fatal disorder to an adult-onset chronic neurodegenerative disease. The age of onset of the first (beyond 3 months of life) neurological symptom may predict the severity of the disease and determines life expectancy.NPC has an estimated incidence of ~ 1: 100,000 and the rarity of the disease translate into misdiagnosis, delayed diagnosis and barriers to good care. For these reasons, we have developed clinical guidelines that define standard of care for NPC patients, foster shared care arrangements between expert centres and family physicians, and empower patients. The information contained in these guidelines was obtained through a systematic review of the literature and the experiences of the authors in their care of patients with NPC. We adopted the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research &amp; Evaluation (AGREE II) system as method of choice for the guideline development process. We made a series of conclusive statements and scored them according to level of evidence, strengths of recommendations and expert opinions. These guidelines can inform care providers, care funders, patients and their carers of best practice of care for patients with NPC. In addition, these guidelines have identified gaps in the knowledge that must be filled by future research. It is anticipated that the implementation of these guidelines will lead to a step change in the quality of care for patients with NPC irrespective of their geographical location.
Niemann-Pick disease type C2 is a lipid storage disorder in which mutations in the NPC2 protein cause accumulation of lipoprotein-derived cholesterol in late endosomes and lysosomes (LE/LYSs). Whether cholesterol delivered by other means to NPC2 deficient cells also accumulates in LE/LYSs is currently unknown. We show that the close cholesterol analog dehydroergosterol (DHE), when delivered to the plasma membrane (PM) accumulates in LE/LYSs of human fibroblasts lacking functional NPC2. We measured two different time scales of sterol diffusion; while DHE rich LE/LYSs moved by slow anomalous diffusion in disease cells (D ∼ 4.6∙10-4 μm2/sec; α∼0.76), a small pool of sterol could exchange rapidly with D ∼ 3 μm2/s between LE/LYSs, as shown by fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP). By quantitative lipid mass spectrometry we found that esterification of 13C-labeled cholesterol but not of DHE is reduced 10-fold in disease fibroblasts compared to control cells. Internalized NPC2 rescued the sterol storage phenotype and strongly expanded the dynamic sterol pool seen in FRAP experiments. Together, our study shows that cholesterol esterification and trafficking of sterols between the PM and LE/LYSs depends on a functional NPC2 protein. NPC2 likely acts inside LE/LYSs from where it increases non-vesicular sterol exchange with other organelles.
Hepatic cholesterol deposition drives inflammation and fibrosis in non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). The Niemann-Pick type C2 (NPC2) protein plays an important role in regulating intracellular cholesterol trafficking and homeostasis. We hypothesized that intravenous NPC2 supplementation reduces cholesterol accumulation, hepatic inflammation and fibrogenesis in a nutritional NASH rat model.
Rats were fed a high-fat, high-cholesterol (HFHC) diet for four weeks resulting in moderately severe NASH. Animals were treated with intravenous NPC2 or placebo twice weekly for either the last two weeks or the entire four weeks. End-points were liver/body- and spleen/body weight ratios, histopathological NASH scores, fibrosis, serum liver enzymes, cholesterol, lipoproteins, cytokines, and quantitative polymerase chain reaction derived hepatic gene expression related to cholesterol metabolism, inflammation, and fibrosis.
HFHC rats developed hepatomegaly, non-fibrotic NASH histopathology, elevated liver enzymes, serum cholesterol, and pro-inflammatory cytokines. Their sterol regulatory element binding factor 2 (SREBF2) and low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDL-R) mRNAs were down-regulated compared with rats on standard chow. NPC2 did not improve liver weight, histopathology, levels of serum liver enzymes or pro-inflammatory tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα), Interleukin (IL)-6, or IL-1β in HFHC rats. Two weeks of NPC2 treatment lowered hepatic TNFα and COL1A1 mRNA expression. However, this effect was ultimately reversed following additional two weeks of treatment. Four weeks NPC2 treatment of rats raised ATP-binding cassette A1 (ABCA1) and low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) mRNAs in the liver, concurrent with a strong tendency towards higher serum high-density lipoprotein (HDL). Furthermore, the peroxisome proliferator activated receptor-ɣ (PPARG) gene expression was reduced.
NPC2 proved inefficient at modifying robust hepatic NASH end-points in a HFHC NASH model. Nonetheless, our data suggest that hepatic ABCA1 expression and reverse cholesterol transport were upregulated by NPC2 treatment, thus presenting putative therapeutic effects in diseases associated with deregulated lipid metabolism.
Thyroid ultrasound and ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration (USG/FNA) biopsy are currently used for diagnosing papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC), but their detection limit could be improved by combining other biomarkers. To discover novel PTC biomarkers, we herein applied a GeLC-MS/MS strategy to analyze the proteome profiles of serum-abundant-protein-depleted FNA cystic fluid from benign and PTC patients, as well as two PTC cell line secretomes. From them, we identified 346, 488, and 2105 proteins, respectively. Comparative analysis revealed that 191 proteins were detected in the PTC but not the benign cystic fluid samples, and thus may represent potential PTC biomarkers. Among these proteins, 101 were detected in the PTC cell line secretomes, and seven of them (NPC2, CTSC, AGRN, GPNMB, DPP4, ERAP2, and SH3BGRL3) were reported in public PTC transcriptome datasets as having 4681 elevated mRNA expression in PTC. Immunoblot analysis confirmed the elevated expression levels of five proteins (NPC2, CTSC, GPNMB, DPP4, and ERAP2) in PTC versus benign cystic fluids. Immunohistochemical studies from near 100 pairs of PTC tissue and their adjacent non-tumor counterparts further showed that AGRN (n = 98), CTSC (n = 99), ERAP2 (n = 98) and GPNMB (n = 100) were significantly (p &lt; 0.05) overexpressed in PTC and higher expression levels of AGRN and CTSC were also significantly associated with metastasis and poor prognosis of PTC patients. Collectively, our results indicate that an integrated analysis of FNA cystic fluid proteome, cancer cell secretome and tissue transcriptome datasets represents a useful strategy for efficiently discovering novel PTC biomarker candidates.
Niemann-Pick type C2 (NPC2) disease is a rare, neurodegenerative disorder caused by mutations in the NPC2 gene, leading to lysosomal accumulation of unesterified cholesterol and other lipids. It is characterized by hepatosplenomegaly, liver dysfunction and severe neurological manifestations, resulting in early death. There is no effective therapy for NPC2 disease. Here, we evaluated the effectiveness of an adeno-associated virus (AAV), serotype rh.10 gene transfer vector expressing the mouse Npc2 gene (AAVrh.10-mNpc2-HA, HA tagged to facilitate analysis) to treat the disease in an Npc2-/- mouse model. A single intracisternal administration of the AAVrh.10-mNpc2-HA to 6 week old Npc2-/- mice mediated vector DNA, transgene mRNA and protein expression in brain and other organs. Compared to untreated Npc2-/- mice, AAV-treated Npc2-/- mice demonstrated amelioration of disease pathology in the brain, reduced lysosomal storage, reduced Purkinje cell death, decreased gliosis, and improved performance in behavioral tasks. Treatment-related reduction in serum disease markers was detected early and this effect persisted. Liver and spleen pathology were improved with significant reduction of liver cholesterol and sphingomyelin levels in treated Npc2-/- mice. Finally, administration of AAVrh.10-mNpc2-HA significantly extended life-span. Taken together, these data demonstrate the benefit of a one-time intracisternal administration of AAVrh.10-mNpc2-HA as a life-long treatment for NPC2 disease.
Phospholipases play crucial roles in plant membrane lipid homeostasis. Nonspecific phospholipase C (NPCs) establish a unique class of phospholipases found only in plants and certain bacteria. Here, we show that two previously uncharacterized NPC isoforms, NPC2 and NPC6, are required for male and female gametophyte development in Arabidopsis. Double mutant plants of npc2-1 npc6-2 could not be retrieved because npc2-1 npc6-2 ovule and pollen development is affected. Genetic complementation, reciprocal crossing and microscope observation of npc2-1/- npc6-2/+ and npc2-1/+ npc6-2/- plants suggest that NPC2 and NPC6 are redundant and are required for normal gametophyte development. Both NPC2 and NPC6 proteins are localized to the plastids. Promoter-GUS assays in transgenic Arabidopsis revealed that NPC2 and NPC6 are preferentially expressed in floral organs rather than in leaves. In vitro enzyme assays showed that NPC2 and NPC6 hydrolyze phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine, but not phosphatidate, being consistent with the reported substrate selectivity of NPCs. The amounts of phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylglycerol were increased in buds but not in flowers of npc2-1/- npc6-2/+ and npc2-1/+ npc6-2/- plants, presumably due to reduced phospholipid hydrolysis activity in developing flowers. Our results demonstrate that NPC2 and NPC6 play crucial roles in gametogenesis during flower development.
We have performed a proteomic analysis on chemosensory organs of Varroa destructor, the honey bee mite, in order to identify putative soluble carriers for pheromones and other olfactory cues emitted by the host. In particular, we have analysed forelegs, mouthparts (palps, chelicera and hypostome) and the second pair of legs (as control tissue) in reproductive and phoretic stages of the Varroa life cycle. We identified 958 Varroa proteins, most of them common to the different organs and stages. Sequence analysis shows that four proteins can be assigned to the odorant-binding protein (OBP)-like class, which bear some similarity to insect OBPs, but so far have only been reported in some Chelicerata. In addition, we have detected the presence of two proteins belonging to the Niemann-Pick family, type C2 (NPC2), which have also been suggested as semiochemical carriers. Biological significance: The mite Varroa destructor is the major parasite of the honey bee and is responsible for great economical losses. The biochemical tools used by Varroa to detect semiochemicals produced by the host are still largely unknown. This work contributes to understand the molecular basis of olfaction in Varroa and, more generally, how detection of semiochemicals has evolved in terrestrial non-hexapod Arthropoda. Moreover, the identification of molecular carriers involved in olfaction can contribute to the development of control strategies for this important parasite.
Cryptic (hidden) pockets are sites that are not visible on unliganded target proteins' structures and only become apparent when a ligand binds. They might provide a valid alternative to classical binding sites in otherwise "undruggable" targets, but their hidden nature makes it difficult to use standard structure-based or computer-aided drug discovery approaches. Our group recently developed a Hamiltonian replica-exchange method (sampling water interfaces through scaled Hamiltonians or SWISH) that improves the sampling of hydrophobic cavities by scaling the interactions between water molecules and protein atoms. Here, we discuss further improvements to SWISH and its combination with fragment probe simulations. We tested the robustness and general applicability of the improved approach in a variety of pharmaceutically relevant targets. The chosen proteins: NPC2, p38α, LfrR, and hPNMT, represent a set of diversified and interesting targets harboring nontrivial cryptic binding sites. In all cases, the updated version of our algorithm efficiently explored the cryptic sites.
Niemann-Pick type C (NPC) disease is characterized by the lysosomal accumulation of cholesterols and impaired autophagic flux due to the inhibited fusion of autophagosomes to lysosomes. We have recently developed β-cyclodextrin (β-CD)-threaded biocleavable polyrotaxanes (PRXs), which can release threaded β-CDs in response to intracellular environments as a therapeutic for NPC disease. The biocleavable PRXs exhibited effective cholesterol reduction ability and negligible toxic effect compared with hydroxypropyl-β-CD (HP-β-CD). In this study, we investigated the effect of biocleavable PRX and HP-β-CD on the impaired autophagy in NPC disease. The NPC patient-derived fibroblasts (NPC1 fibroblasts) showed an increase in the number of LC3-positive puncta compared with normal fibroblasts, even in the basal conditions; the HP-β-CD treatment markedly increased the number of LC3-positive puncta and the levels of p62 in NPC1 fibroblasts, indicating that autophagic flux was further perturbed. In sharp contrast, the biocleavable PRX reduced the number of LC3-positive puncta and the levels of p62 in NPC1 fibroblasts through an mTOR-independent mechanism. The mRFP-GFP-LC3 reporter gene expression experiments revealed that the biocleavable PRX facilitated the formation of autolysosomes to allow for autophagic protein degradation. Therefore, the β-CD-threaded biocleavable PRXs may be promising therapeutics for ameliorating not only cholesterol accumulation but also autophagy impairment in NPC disease. 
Mitochondria are essential sites for steroid hormone biosynthesis. Mitochondria in the steroidogenic cells of the adrenal, gonad, placenta and brain contain the cholesterol side-chain cleavage enzyme, P450scc, and its two electron-transfer partners, ferredoxin reductase and ferredoxin. This enzyme system converts cholesterol to pregnenolone and determines net steroidogenic capacity, so that it serves as the chronic regulator of steroidogenesis. Several other steroidogenic enzymes, including 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, 11β-hydroxylase and aldosterone synthase also reside in mitochondria. Similarly, the mitochondria of renal tubular cells contain two key enzymes participating in the activation and degradation of vitamin D. The access of cholesterol to the mitochondria is regulated by the steroidogenic acute regulatory protein, StAR, serving as the acute regulator of steroidogenesis. StAR action requires a complex multi-component molecular machine on the outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM). Components of this machine include the 18 kDa translocator protein (TSPO), the voltage-dependent anion chanel (VDAC-1), TSPO-associated protein 7 (PAP7, ACBD3), and protein kinase A regulatory subunit 1α (PKAR1A). The precise fashion in which these proteins interact and move cholesterol from the OMM to P450scc, and the means by which cholesterol is loaded into the OMM, remain unclear. Human deficiency diseases have been described for StAR and for all the mitochondrial steroidogenic enzymes, but not for the electron transfer proteins or for the components of the cholesterol import machine.
Niemann-Pick type C1 (NPC1) disease is a rare neurovisceral disorder characterized by intracellular accumulation of unesterified cholesterol, sphingolipids, and other lipids in the lysosomal compartment. A deregulation of lysosomal calcium has been identified as one of the earliest steps of the degenerative process. Since adenosine A2A receptors (A2ARs) control lysosome trafficking and pH, which closely regulates lysosomal calcium, we hypothesized a role for these receptors in NPC1. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of the A2AR agonist CGS21680 on human control and NPC1 fibroblasts. We show that CGS21680 raises lysosomal calcium levels and rescues mitochondrial functionality (mitochondrial inner membrane potential and expression of the complex IV of the mitochondrial respiratory chain), which is compromised in NPC1 cells. These effects are prevented by the selective blockade of A2ARs by the antagonist ZM241385. The effects of A2AR activation on lysosomal calcium are not mediated by the cAMP/PKA pathway but they appear to involve the phosphorylation of ERK1/2. Finally, CGS21680 reduces cholesterol accumulation (Filipin III staining), which is the main criterion currently used for identification of a compound or pathway that would be beneficial for NPC disease, and such an effect is prevented by the Ca(2+) chelator BAPTA-AM. Our findings strongly support the hypothesis that A2AR agonists may represent a therapeutic option for NPC1 and provide insights on their mechanisms of action. 
Export of LDL-derived cholesterol from lysosomes requires the cooperation of the integral membrane protein Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1) and a soluble protein, Niemann-Pick C2 (NPC2). Mutations in the genes encoding these proteins lead to Niemann-Pick disease type C (NPC). NPC2 binds to NPC1's second (middle), lumenally oriented domain (MLD) and transfers cholesterol to NPC1's N-terminal domain (NTD). Here, we report the 2.4-Å resolution crystal structure of a complex of human NPC1-MLD and NPC2 bearing bound cholesterol-3-O-sulfate. NPC1-MLD uses two protruding loops to bind NPC2, analogous to its interaction with the primed Ebola virus glycoprotein. Docking of the NPC1-NPC2 complex onto the full-length NPC1 structure reveals a direct cholesterol transfer tunnel between NPC2 and NTD cholesterol binding pockets, supporting the "hydrophobic hand-off" cholesterol transfer model.
Proper intracellular cholesterol trafficking is critical for cellular function. Two lysosome-resident proteins, NPC1 and NPC2, mediate the egress of low-density lipoprotein-derived cholesterol from lysosomes. However, other proteins involved in this process remain largely unknown. Through amphotericin B-based selection, we isolated two cholesterol transport-defective cell lines. Subsequent whole-transcriptome-sequencing analysis revealed two cell lines bearing the same mutation in the vacuolar protein sorting 53 (Vps53) gene. Depletion of VPS53 or other subunits of the Golgi-associated retrograde protein (GARP) complex impaired NPC2 sorting to lysosomes and caused cholesterol accumulation. GARP deficiency blocked the retrieval of the cation-independent mannose 6-phosphate receptor (CI-MPR) to the trans-Golgi network. Further, Vps54 mutant mice displayed reduced cellular NPC2 protein levels and increased cholesterol accumulation, underscoring the physiological role of the GARP complex in cholesterol transport. We conclude that the GARP complex contributes to intracellular cholesterol transport by targeting NPC2 to lysosomes in a CI-MPR-dependent manner.
The sense of bitter taste plays a critical role in animals as it can help them to avoid intake of toxic and harmful substances. Previous research had revealed that chicken has only three bitter taste receptor genes (Tas2r1, Tas2r2 and Tas2r7). To better understand the genetic polymorphisms and importance of bitter taste receptor genes (Tas2rs) in chicken, here, we sequenced Tas2rs of 30 Sichuan domestic chickens and 30 Tibetan chickens. Thirteen single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) including three nonsynonymous mutations (m.359G&gt;C, m.503C&gt;A and m.583A&gt;G) were detected in Tas2r1 (m. is the abbreviation for mutation); three SNPs were detected in Tas2r2, but none of them were missense mutation; eight SNPs were detected in Tas2r7 including six nonsynonymous substitutions (m.178G&gt;A, m.421A&gt;C, m.787C&gt;T, m.832G&gt;T, m.907A&gt;T and m.943G&gt;A). Tajima's D neutral test indicates that there is no population expansion in both populations, and the size of the population is relatively stable. All the three networks indicate that red jungle fowls share haplotypes with domestic chickens. In addition, we found that haplotypes H1 and HE1 were positively associated with high-altitude adaptation, whereas haplotypes H4 and HE4 showed a negative correlation with high-altitude adaptation in Tas2rs. Although, chicken has only three Tas2rs, our results showed that both Sichuan domestic chickens and Tibetan chickens have abundant haplotypes in Tas2rs, especially in Tas2r7, which might help chickens to recognize a wide variety of bitter-tasting compounds. 
High molecular weight organic compounds (HMW-OCs), formed as secondary organic aerosols (SOA), have been reported in many laboratory studies. However, little evidence of HMW-OCs formation, in particular during winter season in the real atmosphere, has been reported. In January 2013, Beijing faced historically severe haze pollution, in which the hourly PM2.5 concentration reached as high as 974 μg m-3. Four typical haze events (HE1 to HE4) were identified, and HE2 (Jan. 9-16) was the most serious of these. Based on the hourly observed chemical composition of PM2.5 and the daily organic composition analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS), we found that abundant ion peaks in m/z 200-850 appeared on heavy haze days, whereas these were negligible on a clear day, indicating the existence of HMW-OCs in the wintertime haze. A negative nonlinear correlation between HMW-OCs and O3 suggested that gas oxidation was not likely to be the dominant mechanism for HMW-OCs formation. During the heavy haze events, the relative humidity and mass ratio of H2O/PM2.5 reached as high as 80% and 0.2, respectively. The high water content and its good positive correlation with HMW-OCs indicated that an aqueous-phase process may be a significant pathway in wintertime. The evidence that acidity was much higher during HE2 (0.37 μg m-3) than on other days, as well as its strong correlation with HMW-OCs, indicated that acid-catalyzed reactions likely resulted in HMW-OCs formation during the heavy winter haze in Beijing.
Protein and lipid composition of sperm plasma membrane are modified as these gametes continue to mature during their transit along the spermatic tract. Our previous study revealed that during its journey through the spermatic duct of the black tiger prawn, Penaeus monodon, sperm cholesterol content decreases through the action of lipid-binding proteins within the luminal environment. In this study, the full cDNA sequence of epididymal secretory protein E1 (HE1), or Niemann-Pick C2 (NPC2), was cloned from P. monodon (termed Pmnpc2), and its conserved cholesterol/lipid-binding domain was characterized. The putative tertiary structure of PmNPC2 showed high similarity with the structure of Bos taurus NPC2. Pmnpc2 is expressed in many tissues, including the spermatic tract (i.e., testis, vas deferens, terminal ampoule) and the female thelycum. In situ hybridization revealed the presence of Pmnpc2 transcripts in the vas deferens, terminal ampoule, and thelycum epithelia, suggesting that PmNPC2 could be secreted into the lumen of the spermatic duct. A recombinant hexahistidine-tagged PmNPC2 (rPmNPC2-6His) was able to bind cholesterol and sperm lipid extracts, while co-incubation of sperm from the vas deferens with rPmNPC2-6His resulted in the depletion of cholesterol from these gametes. Together, these results suggest that PmNPC2 participates in sperm cholesterol efflux during the sperm maturation process in P. monodon. Mol. Reprod.

The pathogenesis of hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is not fully understood yet. Hyperammonemia due to liver failure and subsequent disturbance of cerebral osmolytic balance is thought to play a pivotal role in the emergence of HE. The aim of this in-vivo MR spectroscopy study was to investigate the levels of γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and its correlations with clinical symptoms of HE, blood ammonia, critical flicker frequency, and osmolytic levels. Thirty patients with minimal HE or HE1 and 16 age-matched healthy controls underwent graduation of HE according to the West-Haven criteria and including the critical flicker frequency (CFF), neuropsychometric testing and blood testing. Edited proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((1)H MRS) was used to non-invasively measure the concentrations of GABA, glutamate (Glu), glutamine (Gln), and myo-inositol (mI) - all normalized to creatine (Cr) - in visual and sensorimotor cortex. GABA/Cr in the visual area was significantly decreased in mHE and HE1 patients and correlated both to the CFF (r = 0.401, P = 0.013) and blood ammonia levels (r = -0.434, P = 0.006). Visual GABA/Cr was also strongly linked to mI/Cr (r = 0.720, P &lt; 0.001) and Gln/Cr (r = -0.699, P &lt; 0.001). No group differences or correlations were found for GABA/Cr in the sensorimotor area. Hepatic encephalopathy is associated with a regional specific decrease of GABA levels in the visual cortex, while no changes were revealed for the sensorimotor cortex. Correlations of visual GABA/Cr with CFF, blood ammonia, and osmolytic regulators mI and Gln indicate that decreased visual GABA levels might contribute to HE symptoms, most likely as a consequence of hyperammonemia.
The purpose of this study was to investigate the influence of respiratory motion on the evaluation of the intratumoral heterogeneity of FDG uptake using cumulative SUV-volume histogram (CSH) and fractal analyses.
We used an NEMA IEC body phantom with a homogeneous hot sphere phantom (HO) and two heterogeneous hot sphere phantoms (HE1 and HE2). The background radioactivity of (18)F in the NEMA phantom was 5.3 kBq/mL. The ratio of radioactivity was 4:2:1 for the HO and the outer rims of the HE1 and HE2 phantoms, the inner cores of the HE1 and HE2 phantoms, and background, respectively. Respiratory motion was simulated using a motion table with an amplitude of 2 cm. PET/CT data were acquired using Biograph mCT in motionless and moving conditions. The PET images were analyzed by both CSH and fractal analyses. The area under the CSH (AUC-CSH) and the fractal dimension (FD) was used as quantitative metrics.
In motionless conditions, the AUC-CSHs of the HO (0.80), HE1 (0.75) and HE2 (0.65) phantoms were different. They did not differ in moving conditions (HO, 0.63; HE1, 0.65; HE2, 0.60). The FD of the HO phantom (0.77) was smaller than the FDs of the HE1 (1.71) and HE2 (1.98) phantoms in motionless conditions; however, the FDs of the HO (1.99) and HE1 (2.19) phantoms were not different from each other and were smaller than that of the HE2 (3.73) phantom in moving conditions.
Respiratory motion affected the results of the CSH and fractal analyses for the evaluation of the heterogeneity of the PET/CT images. The influence of respiratory motion was considered to vary depending on the object size.
Defect perovskites (He2-x□x)(CaZr)F6 can be prepared by inserting helium into CaZrF6 at high pressure. They can be recovered to ambient pressure at low temperature. There are no prior examples of perovskites with noble gases on the A-sites. The insertion of helium gas into CaZrF6 both elastically stiffens the material and reduces the magnitude of its negative thermal expansion. It also suppresses the onset of structural disorder, which is seen on compression in other media. Measurements of the gas released on warming to room temperature and Rietveld analyses of neutron diffraction data at low temperature indicate that exposure to helium gas at 500 MPa leads to a stoichiometry close to (He1□1)(CaZr)F6. Helium has a much higher solubility in CaZrF6 than silica glass or crystobalite. An analogue with composition (H2)2(CaZr)F6 would have a volumetric hydrogen storage capacity greater than current US DOE targets. We anticipate that other hybrid perovskites with small neutral molecules on the A-site can also be prepared and that they will display a rich structural chemistry.
Objective. The aim of the present study is to evaluate the usability of the telehealth system, coined Telekit, by using an iterative, mixed usability approach. Materials and Methods. Ten double experts participated in two heuristic evaluations (HE1, HE2), and 11 COPD patients attended two think-aloud tests. The double experts identified usability violations and classified them into Jakob Nielsen's heuristics. These violations were then translated into measurable values on a scale of 0 to 4 indicating degree of severity. In the think-aloud tests, COPD participants were invited to verbalise their thoughts. Results. The double experts identified 86 usability violations in HE1 and 101 usability violations in HE2. The majority of the violations were rated in the 0-2 range. The findings from the think-aloud tests resulted in 12 themes and associated examples regarding the usability of the Telekit system. The use of the iterative, mixed usability approach produced both quantitative and qualitative results. Conclusion. The iterative, mixed usability approach yields a strong result owing to the high number of problems identified in the tests because the double experts and the COPD participants focus on different aspects of Telekit's usability. This trial is registered with Clinicaltrials.gov, NCT01984840, November 14, 2013.
To explore the in vivo anticancer, anti-angiogenesis and immunomodulatory efficacies of the bioactive polysaccharide isolated from cold aqueous extract of Jania rubens (JCEM) and Pterocladia capillacea (PCEM) as well as hot aqueous extract of Enteromorpha intestinalis (EHEM) against hepatocellular carcinoma rat model (HCC) and to study their chemical composition.
The sugars and amino acids composition of the bioactive polysaccharides of JCEM, PCEM and EHEM were determined using gas liquid chromatography and amino acid analyzer, respectively. These polysaccharide extracts (20 mg/kg b.wt. for 5 weeks) were assessed on hepatocarcinogenesis in rats and α-fetoprotein (AFP), carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), glypican-3 (GPC-3), hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and Ig G levels were evaluated.
The GLC analysis of JCEM, PCEM and EHEM polysaccharide revealed the presence of 10, 9 and 10 sugars, in addition the amino acid analyzer enable identification of 16, 15 and 15 amino acids, respectively. These polysaccharide extracts of JCEM, PCEM and EHEM produced significant decrease in serum AFP, CEA, GPC-3, HGF and VEGF compared with untreated HCC group. JCEM, PCEM and EHEM had an immunostimulatory responses by increasing the IgG levels as compared by naïve value (1.23, 1.53 and 1.17 folds), respectively. The bioactive polysaccharides in HCC induced rats improved the humoral immune response. The photomicrographs of liver tissue sections of the groups of HCC treated with polysaccharide extracts of Jania rubens and Enteromorpha intestinalis showed intact histological structure. Moreover, fractions HE1, HE4, HE7 obtained from polysaccharide of EHEM showed moderate cytotoxic activity against HepG2 in vitro with IC50 73.1, 42.6, 76.2 μg/mL. However, fractions of PCEM and JCEM show no or weak cytotoxicity against HepG2 in vitro where the cytotoxic activity of their crude polysaccharide extract proved synergetic effect.
The pronounced antitumor activity of sulfated polysaccharide-protein complexes of JCEM and EHEM is due to direct cytotoxic activity, anti-hepatocarcinogenesis, and anti-angiogenesis. In addition, JCEM, PCEM and EHEM had an immunostimulatory response and improved the humoral immune response in HCC induced rats.
Two novel bacterial strains were isolated from the roots of tomato plants (Solanum lycopersicum L.) from Dengfeng, Henan Province, China. Phylogenetic analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequences showed that the isolates NEAU-DE8(1)T and NEAU-HE1(2) are closely related to one another (99.6% similarity) and are closely relate to Nonomuraea zeae NEAU-ND5T (98.3, 98.3%) and Nonomuraea gerenzanensis DSM 100948T (98.3, 98.0%). Phylogenetic trees constructed based on 16S rRNA gene sequences revealed that both strains grouped with N. zeae NEAU-ND5T within the clade comprising the members of the genus Nonomuraea. Moreover, key chemotaxonomic properties including major menaquinones, fatty acid composition and phospholipid profiles also confirmed the affiliation of the two strains to the genus Nonomuraea. However, DNA-DNA hybridization data, together with physiological and morphological properties, showed that two isolates could be readily distinguished from their close phylogenetic relatives. Thus, on the basis of these phenotypic and genotypic data, strains NEAU-DE8(1)T and NEAU-HE1(2) are concluded to represent a novel species of the genus Nonomuraea, for which the name Nonomuraea lycopersici sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is NEAU-DE8(1)T (= CGMCC 4.7412T = DSM 104642T).
The present study investigated the litter performance of multiparous sows fed 3% and 6% densified diets at farrowing to weaning during summer with mean maximum room temperature of 30.5°C.
A total of 60 crossbred multiparous sows were allotted to one of three treatments based on body weight according to a completely randomized design. Three different nutrient levels based on NRC were applied as standard diet (ST; metabolizable energy, 3,300 kcal/kg), high nutrient level 1 (HE1; ST+3% higher energy and 16.59% protein) and high nutrient level 2 (HE2; ST+6% higher energy and 17.04% protein).
There was no variation in the body weight change. However, backfat thickness change tended to reduce in HE1 in comparison to ST treatment. Dietary treatments had no effects on feed intake, daily energy intake and weaning-to-estrus interval in lactating sows. Litter size, litter weight at weaning and average daily gain of piglets were significantly greater in sows in HE1 compared with ST, however, no difference was observed between HE2 and ST. Increasing the nutrient levels had no effects on the blood urea nitrogen, glucose, triglyceride, and creatinine at post-farrowing and weaning time. The concentration of follicle stimulating hormone, cortisol and insulin were not affected by dietary treatments either in post-farrowing or weaning time. The concentration of blood luteinizing hormone of sows in ST treatment was numerically less than sows in HE2 treatment at weaning. Milk and colostrum compositions such as protein, fat and lactose were not affected by the treatments.
An energy level of 3,400 kcal/kg (14.23 MJ/kg) with 166 g/kg crude protein is suggested as the optimal level of dietary nutrients for heat stressed lactating sows with significant beneficial effects on litter size.
Microarray profiling is a powerful approach to establish gene expression patterns for different histopathological stages of a malignancy, and at the same time, to identify individual genes that may have important functions in the early and/or advanced stages of a neoplasm. To identify genes that hitherto have not been shown to be expressed or play a role in advanced-stage melanomas, we conducted microarray analyses with RNAs from primary melanoma and melanoma-positive lymph node specimens. Using RT-PCR, quantitative, real-time RT-PCR, and fluorochrome oligonucleotide-based optical imaging, we established the level and pattern of expression of five of the identified known genes [Suppression of Tumorigenicity 13 (ST13), Cystatin 8 (CST-8), Dyskeratosis Congentia 1 (DKC1), Neuroendocrine Secretory Protein 55 (NESP55), Niemann-Pick Disease, type C2 (NP-C2)], and a gene with unknown function (16.7 kD Hypothetical Protein) in benign and atypical nevocytic lesions, advanced-stage melanomas, and melanoma-positive lymph nodes.
Niemann-Pick type C2 disease (NP-C2) is a fatal hereditary disorder of unknown etiology characterized by defective egress of cholesterol from lysosomes. Here we show that the disease is caused by a deficiency in HE1, a ubiquitously expressed lysosomal protein identified previously as a cholesterol-binding protein. HE1 was undetectable in fibroblasts from NP-C2 patients but present in fibroblasts from unaffected controls and NP-C1 patients. Mutations in the HE1 gene, which maps to chromosome 14q24.3, were found in NP-C2 patients but not in controls. Treatment of NP-C2 fibroblasts with exogenous recombinant HE1 protein ameliorated lysosomal accumulation of low density lipoprotein-derived cholesterol.
Niemann-Pick disease type C2 (NP-C2) is a fatal hereditary disease characterized by accumulation of low-density lipoprotein-derived cholesterol in lysosomes. Here we report the 1.7-A resolution crystal structure of the cholesterol-binding protein deficient in this disease, NPC2, and the characterization of its ligand binding properties. Human NPC2 binds the cholesterol analog dehydroergosterol with submicromolar affinity at both acidic and neutral pH. NPC2 has an Ig-like fold stabilized by three disulfide bonds. The structure of the bovine protein reveals a loosely packed region penetrating from the surface into the hydrophobic core that forms adjacent small cavities with a total volume of approximately 160 A(3). We propose that this region represents the incipient cholesterol-binding site that dilates to accommodate an approximately 740-A(3) cholesterol molecule.
We report the fifth case of neonatal form of type C2 (NP-C2) Niemann-Pick disease with early and fatal respiratory distress. Eleven families presenting such cases are known to date in the world. Since December 2000, isolation of the underlying gene HE1/NPC2 and its mutations has allowed major advances in diagnosis.
Elisa was born in May 2000. NP-C2 disease was associated with severe respiratory distress leading to death at the age of four months. On the next pregnancy in September 2000, prenatal diagnosis was performed by means of biological tests that required four weeks response time. In December 2000, isolation of the HE1/NPC2 gene located to 14q24.3 and of some of its mutations allowed to characterize the patient as being homozygote for the nonsense mutation E20X. On the the two next pregnancies, prenatal diagnosis was performed at 12 SA, in 48 hours, by the means of mutation analysis. The last fetus was heterozygote for the mutation E20X, allowing the birth at term of a healthy male newborn baby.
Niemann-Pick type C disease is a rare lysosomal lipid storage disease with severe prognosis. It is characterized by abnormalities of intracellular transport of endocytosed cholesterol. Diagnosis relies on biological tests that require cultured cells. Genetic heterogeneity defines two different genetic complementation groups C1 and C2. Severe and early respiratory distress is more likely to be associated with the rare type C2. Since December 2000, after identification of the disease-causing mutations in the proband, mutation analysis of gene HE1/NPC2 on direct chorionic villus samples allows early and fast (48 hours) prenatal diagnosis.
Our goal is to decipher which DNA sequences are required for tissue-specific expression of epididymal genes. At least 6 epididymis-specific lipocalin genes are known. These are differently regulated and regionalized in the epididymis. Lipocalin 5 (Lcn5 or mE-RABP) and Lipocalin 8 (Lcn8 or mEP17) are homologous genes belonging to the epididymis-specific lipocalin gene cluster. Both the 5 kb promoter fragment of the Lcn5 gene and the 5.3 kb promoter fragment of the Lcn8 gene can direct transgene expression in the epididymis (Lcn5 to the distal caput and Lcn8 to the initial segment), indicating that these promoter fragments contain important cis-regulatory element(s) for epididymis-specific gene expression. To define further the fragments regulating gene expression, the Lcn5 promoter was examined in transgenic mice and immortalized epididymal cell lines. After serial deletion, the 1.8 kb promoter fragment of the Lcn5 gene was sufficient for tissue-specific and region-specific gene expression in transgenic mice. Transient transfection analysis revealed that a transcription factor forkhead box A2 (Foxa2) interacts with androgen receptor and binds to the 100 bp fragment of the Lcn5 promoter between 1.2 kb and 1.3 kb and that Foxa2 expression inhibits androgen-dependent induction of the Lcn5 promoter activity. Immunohistochemistry indicated a restricted expression of Foxa2 in the epididymis where endogenous Lcn5 gene expression is suppressed and that the Foxa2 inhibition of the Lcn5 promoter is consistent with the lack of expression of Lcn5 in the corpus and cauda. Our approach provides a basic strategy for further analysis of the epididymal lipocalin gene regulation and flexible control of epididymal function.
The sperm from the testis acquires complete fertilizing ability and forward progressive motility following its transit through the epididymis. Acquisition of these characteristics results from the modification of the sperm proteome following interactions with epididymal secretions. In our attempts to identify epididymis-specific sperm plasma membrane proteins, a partial 2.83-kb clone was identified by immunoscreening a monkey epididymal cDNA library with an agglutinating monoclonal antibody raised against washed human spermatozoa. The sequence of the 2.83-kb clone exhibited homology to the region between 1 and 1097 bp of the homeobox gene, Hoxb2. This sequence was found to be species conserved, as revealed by RT-PCR analysis. To obtain a full-length clone of the sequence, 5' RACE-PCR (rapid amplification of cDNA ends PCR) was carried out using rat epididymal RNA as the template. It resulted in a full-length 1.657-kb cDNA encoding a 32.9-kDa putative protein. The protein designated HOXBES2 exhibited homology to the conserved 61-amino acid homeodomain region of the HOXB2 homeoprotein. However, characteristic differences were noted in its amino and carboxyl termini compared with HOXB2. A putative 30-kDa protein was detected in the tissue extracts from adult rat epididymis and caudal spermatozoa, and a 37-kDa protein was detected in the rat embryo when probed with a polyclonal antibody against HOXB2 protein. Multiple tissue Western blot and immunohistochemical analysis further indicated its expression in the cytoplasm of the principal and basal epithelial cells, with maximal expression in the distal epididymal segments. Northern blot analysis detected a single approximately 2.5-kb transcript from the adult epididymis. Indirect immunofluorescence localized the protein to the acrosome, midpiece, and equatorial segments of rat caudal and ejaculated human and monkey spermatozoa, respectively. In conclusion, we have identified and characterized a novel epididymal homeoprotein different from HOXB2 protein and hereafter referred to as HOXBES2, (HOXB2 homeodomain containing epididymis-specific sperm protein) with a probable role in fertilization.
To provide materials for the study of the function of ESC42 protein specifically expressed in the human epididymis.
The ESC42 gene was amplified from the human epididymis cDNA library by PCR and then cloned into prokaryotic expression vector pGEX-4T-1, expressed and purified by recombinant DNA techniques. The specificity of ESC42 protein was identified by Western blot and MALDI-TOF-MS. The database was searched by Ms-Fit.
The recombinant plasmid expressed a Mr 38 x 10(3) fusion protein in E. coli at a level of 30% of the total protein, and the purity was as high as 99%. The ESC42 protein was identified by ESC42 monoclonal antibody and its molecular weight was 11 978.12, tested by MALDI-TOF-MS. The peptide mass fingerprint analysis showed that the coverage rate of the sequence reached 48% with 100% matching. The motif scan in Prosite database reveal that ESC42 belonged to the beta-defensin family and had antibacterial activity.
Obtaining high purity of rhESC42 protein may lay a foundation for the study of its functions.
Spermatozoa bind a variety of proteins as they pass through the proximal regions of the epididymis, where they acquire forward motility and fertilizing ability. Recent evidence indicates that certain epididymis-specific secretory proteins that bind sperm have antibacterial activity and may function as part of the innate immune system. We reported earlier that ESC42, now designated human beta-defensin 118 (DEFB118), is a sperm-binding protein. In this study, we demonstrate that DEFB118 has potent antibacterial activity that is dose, time, and structure dependent. Incubation of Escherichia coli for 60 min with 10 microg/ml DEFB118 reduced bacterial survival to 20% of the control, and 25 microg/ml reduced survival to 5% of the control. DEFB118 concentrations of 50 and 100 microg/ml further reduced survival to less than 2 and 1%, respectively. A biphasic effect of salt concentration on the antibacterial activity of DEFB118 was observed. Reduction of disulfide bonds and alkylation of cysteines resulted in the complete loss of antibacterial activity. DEFB118 caused rapid permeabilization of both outer and inner membranes of E. coli and striking morphological alterations in the bacterial surfaces visible by scanning electron microscopy consistent with a membrane-disruptive mechanism of bacterial killing. In contrast, eukaryotic cell membranes were not permeabilized by DEFB118, as indicated by the rat erythrocyte hemolytic assay. Studies on DEFB118 inhibition of macromolecular synthesis and membrane permeability in E. coli were consistent with a primary effect at the cell membrane level. DEFB118 may contribute to epididymal innate immunity and protect the sperm against attack by microorganisms in the male and female reproductive tracts.
The importance of early diagnosis to reduce the morbidity and mortality from cancer has led to a search for new sensitive and specific tumour markers. Molecular techniques developed over the past few years allow simultaneous screening of thousands of genes, and have been applied to different cancers to identify many genes that are modulated in various cancers. Of these, attention has focused on genes coding for a family of proteins with whey-acidic-protein (WAP) motifs. Most notably, the genes coding for elafin, antileukoproteinase 1 (previously called secretory leucocyte proteinase inhibitor, SLPI), WAP four disulphide core domain protein 1 (previously called prostate stromal protein 20 kDa, PS20), and WAP four disulphide core domain protein 2 (previously called major human epididymis-specific protein E4, HE4), have been identified as candidate molecular markers for several cancers. In this review, we assess data for an association between cancer and human WAP proteins, and discuss their potential role in tumour progression. We also propose a new mechanism by which WAP proteins might have a role in carcinogenesis.
The objective of the present study was to investigate in healthy young women the fluctuations in serum concentration of human epididymal secretory protein human epididymis-specific protein 4 (HE4) and CA125 during the phases of the menstrual cycle and the correlation between HE4 and CA125 values and age. Forty women with regular menstrual cycles were included in the study. Pelvic and transvaginal ultrasound were performed in order to exclude ovarian pathologies. Blood samples were collected at follicular (FP), ovulatory (OP), and luteal (LP) phases of the hormonal cycle. The values of HE4 (expressed as picomoles per liter) observed were (mean ± SEM) 39.1 ± 1.1 (FP), 45.3 ± 1.19 (OP), and 42.0 ± 1.3 (LP). The difference between FP and OP was statistically significant (p = 0.0002). By contrast, serum CA125 levels (expressed as units per milliliter) were 14.35 ± 0.66 (FP), 13.15 ± 0.54 (OP), and 13.70 ± 0.54 (LP), respectively. The levels of HE4 observed in serum samples of women below 35 years were 37.5 ± 1.28 in the FP, 46.6 ± 1.4 in the OP, and 42.8 ± 1.49 in the LP. In this group, a statistically significant difference was observed in the FP compared with the OP (p &lt; 0.0001), whereas no statistically significant difference was observed during the different hormonal phases in the group of women over 35. In conclusion, the correct interpretation of laboratory data is essential to define a threshold of normality, and for what concerns HE4 levels, the menstrual cycle phase-dependent variability appears indicated in the interpretation of the results.
BIN1b was reported as an epididymis-specific beta-defensin antimicrobial peptide. In this paper, the recombinant BIN1b was expressed and purified by fusing with GB1-His tag. The size-exclusion gel filtration experiment indicated that the fusion protein GB1-BIN1b formed multimers at pH 7.4, and existed as monomer at pH 4.5. The oligomerization of GB1-BIN1b was only related to pH value, neither to NaCl concentration nor protein concentration. Far-UV circular dichroism (CD) spectra also showed the fusion protein had more ordered secondary structures at pH 4.5 than at pH 7.4, as a negative peak appeared around 218 nm indicative of typical beta-sheet. The 2D (15)N-(1)H heteronuclear single-quantum coherence (HSQC) spectra suggested that the fusion protein adopted a compact three-dimensional structure at pH 4.5. Colony forming unit (CFU) inhibition assay demonstrated that 25 microM fusion protein at pH 7.4 had an antimicrobial activity of 40% against E. coli K(12)D(31), which might imply the fusion protein functions as multimeric states. In conclusion, the GB1 fusion partner helps BIN1b form a stable homogenous conformation to facilitate subsequent structural determination without a significant effect on the antimicrobial activity.
To evaluate the validity and compare the performance of cancer antigen-125 (CA-125), human epididymis protein 4 (HE4), the risk of malignancy index (RMI), and the risk of ovarian malignancy algorithm (ROMA) in the diagnosis of ovarian cancer in patients with ovarian lesions discovered during their preoperative work-up investigations.
This prospective, cross-sectional study looked at patients who attended the gynecology department at the Royal Hospital, Muscat, from 1 March 2014 to 30 April 2015, for the evaluation of an ovarian lesion. The inclusion criteria included women who underwent surgical intervention and who had a preoperative pelvic ultrasound with laboratory investigation for CA-125 and HE4. The study validated the diagnostic performance of CA-125, RMI, HE4, and ROMA using histopathological diagnosis as the gold standard.
The study population had a total of 213 cases of various types of benign (77%) and malignant (23%) ovarian tumors. CA-125 showed the highest sensitivity (79%) when looking at the total patient population. When divided by age, the sensitivity was 67% in premenopausal women. In postmenopausal women, CA-125 had lower sensitivity (89%) compared to RMI, HE4, and ROMA (93% each). A high specificity of 90% was found for HE4 in the total patient population, 93% in premenopausal women and 75% in postmenopausal women. CA-125 had the highest specificity (79%) in postmenopausal women. Both CA-125 and RMI were frequently elevated in benign gynecological conditions particularly in endometriosis when compared to HE4 and ROMA. We also studied modifications of the optimal cut-offs for the four parameters. Both CA-125 and RMI showed a significant increase in their specificity if the cut-off was increased to ≥ 60 U/mL for CA-125 and to ≥ 250 for RMI. For HE4, we noted an improvement in its specificity in postmenopausal women when its cut-off was increased to140 pmol/L.
HE4 and ROMA showed a very high specificity, but were less sensitive than CA-125 and RMI in premenopausal women. However, they were of comparable sensitivity in postmenopausal women and were valuable in distinguishing benign ovarian tumors or endometriosis from ovarian cancer. Modifying the cut-off values of the different markers resulted in a higher accuracy compared to the standard cut-offs, but at the expense of reduced sensitivity.
The purpose of this study was to determine the association of three proteins involved in sperm function on the freezability of porcine semen: the heat shock protein 90 alpha (HSP90a), the Niemann-Pick disease type C2 protein (NPC2), and lipocalin-type prostaglandin D synthase (L-PGDS). Six adult boars (each boar was ejaculated three times, 18 in total) were classified by freezability based on the percentage of functionally competent sperm. The male semen with highest freezability (MHF) and the male semen with lowest freezability (MLF) were centrifuged immediately after collection to separate seminal plasma and spermatozoa to make four possible combinations of these two components and to incubate them for 3 h, adjusting the temperature to 17 °C, to freeze them afterwards. The quantification of proteins was performed in two stages: at zero and at 3 h after incubation of the four combinations.
The spermatozoa × incubation time (IT) interaction only had effect (P &lt; 0.01) on HSP90a levels; this protein increased in seminal plasma, after 3 h of incubation, in larger quantity (P &lt; 0.05) in combinations with MLF spermatozoa. In relation with the NPC2 protein, two isoforms of 16 and 19 kDa were identified. The 19 kDa isoform was affected (P &lt; 0.01) only by the seminal plasma × IT interaction, with superior values (P &lt; 0.01) both at zero and three hours of incubation, in the combinations with MHF seminal plasma; and 16 kDa isoform was affected (P &lt; 0.01) only by the IT with reduction after 3 h of incubation. The levels of L-PGDS was affected (P &lt; 0.01) only by the spermatozoa × IT interaction, which reduced (P &lt; 0.01) in combinations with MLF spermatozoa after 3 h of incubation.
It is possible to consider that the three proteins evaluated were associated with freezability of boar semen due, especially, to the fact that mixtures with MLF spermatozoa showed greater increase levels of the HSP90a protein and reduction of L-PGDS in plasma. In addition, the seminal plasma of MHF had higher concentration of the NPC2 of 19 kDa protein, which was reduced by incubating with MHF spermatozoa.
Neuronal growth regulator 1 (NEGR1) is a newly identified raft-associated protein, which has recently been spotlighted as a new locus related to human obesity. Niemann-Pick disease Type C2 (NPC2) protein functions as a key player in the intracellular cholesterol trafficking, and its defect is linked to a fatal human neurodegenerative disease, NPC. In this study, we identified that NEGR1 interacts with NPC2 and increases its protein stability. Ectopically expressed NEGR1 proteins relieved an abnormal cholesterol accumulation in endosomal compartments. Importantly, NEGR1-defective mouse embryonic fibroblast cells exhibit increased cholesterol levels and triglyceride contents. These findings provide the first insight into the role of NEGR1 in intracellular cholesterol homeostasis, possibly explaining the missing link between NEGR1 with human obesity.
In chronic liver diseases, regardless of their etiology, the development of fibrosis is the first step toward the progression to cirrhosis, portal hypertension, and hepatocellular carcinoma. Hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) are the main profibrogenic cells that promote the pathogenesis of liver fibrosis, and so it is important to identify the molecules that regulate HSCs activation and liver fibrosis. Niemann-Pick type C2 (NPC2) protein plays an important role in the regulation of intracellular cholesterol homeostasis by directly binding with free cholesterol. However, the roles of NPC2 in HSCs activation and liver fibrosis have not been explored in detail. Since a high-cholesterol diet exacerbates liver fibrosis progression in both rodents and humans, we propose that the expression of NPC2 affects free cholesterol metabolism and regulates HSCs activation. In this study, we found that NPC2 is decreased in both thioacetamide- and carbon tetrachloride-induced liver fibrosis tissues. In addition, NPC2 is expressed in quiescent HSCs, but its activation status is down-regulated. Knockdown of NPC2 in HSC-T6 cells resulted in marked increases in transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1)-induced collagen type 1 α1 (Col1a1), α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) expression, and Smad2 phosphorylation. In contrast, NPC2 overexpression decreased TGF-β1-induced HSCs activation. We further demonstrated that NPC2 deficiency significantly increased the accumulation of free cholesterol in HSCs, increasing Col1a1 and α-SMA expression and activating Smad2, and leading to sensitization of HSCs to TGF-β1 activation. In contrast, overexpression of NPC2 decreased U18666A-induced free cholesterol accumulation and inhibited the subsequent HSCs activation. In conclusion, our study has demonstrated that NPC2 plays an important role in HSCs activation by regulating the accumulation of free cholesterol. NPC2 overexpression may thus represent a new treatment strategy for liver fibrosis. 
In this study, we investigated the role and mechanism of Niemann-Pick type C (NPC)2 in regulating lysosomal activity, mitophagy, and mitochondrial function in adipocytes. We found that knocking down NPC2 impaired lysosomal activity, as evidenced by the reduced mature cathepsin B, the increased accumulation of light chain 3 (LC3) and p62, and the decreased autophagic flux. In NPC2-knockdown (kd) adipocytes, the starvation-induced conversion of LC3-I to LC3-II was abolished. More interestingly, the majority of NPC2 was found in the mitochondrial fraction, and NPC2 deficiency led to impaired autophagic flux and decreased induction of LC3-II in the mitochondrial fraction during mitochondrial stress. Moreover, cellular respiration profiling revealed that NPC2-kd adipocytes had significantly decreased basal/maximal respiration and mitochondrial gene expression compared with scrambled cells, suggesting mitochondrial dysfunction. Additionally, we found that the mitochondrial recruitment of LC3-II induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS), but not TNFα, was blunted in NPC2-kd adipocytes. Most intriguingly, NPC2-kd selectively diminished LPS-induced NFκB and ERK1/2 phosphorylation and the expression of pro-inflammatory genes, indicating that toll-like receptor signaling activation is impaired in the absence of NPC2. Our results suggest that NPC2 is in a mitochondrially associated autophagosome and plays an important role in regulating mitophagy, mitochondrial quality control, and mitochondrial function.
Chemosensing is a primary sense in nature, however little is known about its mechanism in Chelicerata. As a model organism we used the mite Varroa destructor, a key parasite of honeybees. Here we describe a transcriptomic analysis of two physiological stages for the Varroa foreleg, the site of primary olfactory organ. The transcriptomic analysis revealed transcripts of chemosensory related genes belonging to several groups. These include Niemann-Pick disease protein, type C2 (NPC2), gustatory receptors (GRs), ionotropic receptors (IRs), sensory neuron membrane proteins (SNMPs) and odorant binding proteins (OBP). However, no insect odorant receptors (ORs) and odorant co-receptors (ORcos) were found. In addition, we identified a homolog of the most ancient IR co-receptor, IR25a, in Varroa as well as in other members of Acari. High expression of this transcript in the mite's forelegs, while not detectable in the other pairs of legs, suggests a function for this IR25a-like in Varroa chemosensing.
Lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) plays a key role in reverse cholesterol transport by transferring an acyl group from phosphatidylcholine to cholesterol, promoting the maturation of high-density lipoproteins (HDL) from discoidal to spherical particles. LCAT is activated through an unknown mechanism by apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I) and other mimetic peptides that form a belt around HDL. Here, we report the crystal structure of LCAT with an extended lid that blocks access to the active site, consistent with an inactive conformation. Residues Thr-123 and Phe-382 in the catalytic domain form a latch-like interaction with hydrophobic residues in the lid. Because these residues are mutated in genetic disease, lid displacement was hypothesized to be an important feature of apoA-I activation. Functional studies of site-directed mutants revealed that loss of latch interactions or the entire lid enhanced activity against soluble ester substrates, and hydrogen-deuterium exchange (HDX) mass spectrometry revealed that the LCAT lid is extremely dynamic in solution. Upon addition of a covalent inhibitor that mimics one of the reaction intermediates, there is an overall decrease in HDX in the lid and adjacent regions of the protein, consistent with ordering. These data suggest a model wherein the active site of LCAT is shielded from soluble substrates by a dynamic lid until it interacts with HDL to allow transesterification to proceed.
Betaine has previously been demonstrated to protect the liver against alcohol‑induced fat accumulation. However, the mechanism through which betaine affects alcohol‑induced hepatic lipid metabolic disorders has not been extensively studied. The present study aimed to investigate the effect of betaine on alcoholic simple fatty liver and hepatic lipid metabolism disorders. A total of 36 rats were randomly divided into control, ethanol and ethanol + betaine groups. Liver function, morphological alterations, lipid content and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)‑α levels were determined. Hepatic expression levels of diacylglycerol acyltransferase (DGAT) 1, DGAT2, sterol regulatory element binding protein (SREBP)‑1c, SREBP‑2, fatty acid synthase (FAS), 3‑hydroxy‑3‑methyl‑glutaryl (HMG)‑CoA reductase, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor λ coactivator (PGC)‑1α, adiponectin receptor (AdipoR) 1 and AdipoR2 were quantified. Serum and adipose tissue adiponectin levels were assessed using an enzyme‑linked immunoassay. The results demonstrated that alcohol‑induced ultramicrostructural alterations in hepatocytes, including the presence of lipid droplets and swollen mitochondria, were attenuated by betaine. Hepatic triglyceride, free fatty acid, total cholesterol and cholesterol ester contents and the expression of DGAT1, DGAT2, SREBP‑1c, SREBP‑2, FAS and HMG‑CoA reductase were increased following ethanol consumption, however were maintained at control levels following betaine supplementation. Alcohol‑induced decreases in hepatic PGC‑1α mRNA levels and serum and adipose tissue adiponectin concentrations were prevented by betaine. The downregulation of hepatic AdipoR1 which resulted from alcohol exposure was partially attenuated by betaine. No significant differences in liver function, TNF‑α, phospholipid and AdipoR2 levels were observed among the control, ethanol and ethanol + betaine groups. Overall, these results indicated that betaine attenuated the alcoholic simple fatty liver by improving hepatic lipid metabolism via suppression of DGAT1, DGAT2, SREBP‑1c, FAS, SREBP‑2 and HMG‑CoA reductase and upregulation of PGC‑1α.
A key to effective treatment of cardiovascular disease is to understand the body's complex lipoprotein transport system. Reverse cholesterol transport (RCT) is the process of cholesterol movement from the extrahepatic tissues back to the liver. Lipoproteins containing apoA-I [highdensity lipoprotein (HDL)] are key mediators in RCT, whereas non-high-density lipoproteins (non-HDL, lipoproteins containing apoB) are involved in the lipid delivery pathway. HDL particles are heterogeneous; they differ in proportion of proteins and lipids, size, shape, and charge. HDL heterogeneity is the result of the activity of several factors that assemble and remodel HDL particles in plasma: ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1), lecithin cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT), cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP), hepatic lipase (HL), phospholipid transfer protein (PLTP), endothelial lipase (EL), and scavenger receptor class B type I (SR-BI). The RCT pathway consists of the following steps: 1. Cholesterol efflux from peripheral tissues to plasma, 2. LCAT-mediated esterification of cholesterol and remodeling of HDL particles, 3. direct pathway of HDL cholesterol delivery to the liver, and 4. indirect pathway of HDL cholesterol delivery to the liver via CETP-mediated transfer There are several established strategies for raising HDL cholesterol in humans, such as lifestyle changes; use of drugs including fibrates, statins, and niacin; and new therapeutic approaches. The therapeutic approaches include CETP inhibition, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) agonists, synthetic farnesoid X receptor agonists, and gene therapy. Results of clinical trials should be awaited before further clinical management of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.
Pharmacological interventions to increase the concentration of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) have led to disappointing results and have contributed to the emergence of the concept of HDL functionality. The anti-atherogenic activity of HDLs can be explained by their functionality or quality. The capacity of HDLs to maintain cellular cholesterol homeostasis and to transport cholesterol from peripheral cells to the liver for elimination is one of their principal anti-atherogenic activities. However, HDLs possess several other attributes that contribute to their protective effect against cardiovascular diseases. HDL functionality is regulated by various proteins and lipids making up HDL particles. However, several studies investigated the role of paraoxonase 1 (PON1) and suggest a significant role of this protein in the regulation of the functionality of HDLs. Moreover, research on PON1 attracted much interest following several studies indicating that it is involved in cardiovascular protection. However, the mechanisms by which PON1 exerts these effects remain to be elucidated.
Thymoquinone (TQ), has been reported to possess strong antihyperlipidemic properties. However, a variety of serious side effects has been reported for TQ. The present study aimed to evaluate the potential antihyperlipidemic activity of newly synthesized TQ analogs.
first, novel TQ derivatives were studied against radiation-induced dyslipidemia in male rats. Second, the most promising sulfur derivatives (4-7), were further tested to elucidate their possible mechanism(s) of actions. Results showed that they possess Hydroxymethyl Glutaryl-Co A reductase inhibitory activity, as well as stimulatory effects on the activities of each of plasma Lecithin-Cholesterol Acyltransferase and lipoprotein lipase enzymes.
TQ derivatives (4-7), could be considered as promising agents in pathologies implicating impaired lipid metabolism, preclinical evaluation is warranted. [Formula: see text].
ApoA-I activates LCAT that converts lipoprotein cholesterol to cholesteryl ester (CE). Molecular dynamic simulations suggested earlier that helices 5 of two antiparallel apoA-I molecules on discoidal HDL form an amphipathic tunnel for migration of acyl chains and unesterified cholesterol to the active sites of LCAT. Our recent crystal structure of Δ(185-243)apoA-I showed the tunnel formed by helices 5/5, with two positively charged residues arginine 123 positioned at the edge of the hydrophobic tunnel. We hypothesized that these uniquely positioned residues Arg123 are poised for interaction with fatty acids produced by LCAT hydrolysis of the sn-2 chains of phosphatidylcholine, thus positioning the fatty acids for esterification to cholesterol. To test the importance of Arg123 for LCAT phospholipid hydrolysis and CE formation, we generated apoA-I[R123A] and apoA-I[R123E] mutants and made discoidal HDL with the mutants and WT apoA-I. Neither mutation of Arg123 changed the particle composition or size, or the protein conformation or stability. However, both mutations of Arg123 significantly reduced LCAT catalytic efficiency and the apparent Vmax for CE formation without affecting LCAT phospholipid hydrolysis. A control mutation, apoA-I[R131A], did not affect LCAT phospholipid hydrolysis or CE formation. These data suggest that Arg123 of apoA-I on discoidal HDL participates in LCAT-mediated cholesterol esterification.
Reverse cholesterol transport comprises cholesterol efflux from ABCA1-expressing macrophages to apolipoprotein (apo) AI, giving nascent high-density lipoprotein (nHDL), esterification of nHDL-free cholesterol (FC), selective hepatic extraction of HDL lipids, and hepatic conversion of HDL cholesterol to bile salts, which are excreted. We tested this model by identifying the fates of nHDL-[3H]FC, [14C] phospholipid (PL), and [125I]apo AI in serum in vitro and in vivo.
During in vitro incubation of human serum, nHDL-[3H]FC and [14C]PL rapidly transfer to HDL and low-density lipoproteins (t1/2=2-7 minutes), whereas nHDL-[125I]apo AI transfers solely to HDL (t1/2&lt;10 minutes) and to the lipid-free form (t1/2&gt;480 minutes). After injection into mice, nHDL-[3H]FC and [14C]PL rapidly transfer to liver (t1/2=≈2-3 minutes), whereas apo AI clears with t1/2=≈460 minutes. The plasma nHDL-[3H]FC esterification rate is slow (0.46%/h) compared with hepatic uptake. PL transfer protein enhances nHDL-[14C]PL but not nHDL-[3H]FC transfer to cultured Huh7 hepatocytes.
nHDL-FC, PL, and apo AI enter different pathways in vivo. Most nHDL-[3H]FC and [14C]PL are rapidly extracted by the liver via SR-B1 (scavenger receptor class B member 1) and spontaneous transfer; hepatic PL uptake is promoted by PL transfer protein. nHDL-[125I]apo AI transfers to HDL and to the lipid-free form that can be recycled to nHDL formation. Cholesterol esterification by lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase is a minor process in nHDL metabolism. These findings could guide the design of therapies that better mobilize peripheral tissue-FC to hepatic disposal.
Many intracellular pathogens subvert host membrane trafficking pathways to promote their replication. Toxoplasma multiplies in a membrane-bound parasitophorous vacuole (PV) that interacts with mammalian host organelles and intercepts Golgi Rab vesicles to acquire sphingolipids. The mechanisms of host vesicle internalization and processing within the PV remain undefined. We demonstrate that Toxoplasma sequesters a broad range of Rab vesicles into the PV. Correlative light and electron microscopy analysis of infected cells illustrates that intravacuolar Rab1A vesicles are surrounded by the PV membrane, suggesting a phagocytic-like process for vesicle engulfment. Rab11A vesicles concentrate to an intravacuolar network (IVN), but this is reduced in Δgra2 and Δgra2Δgra6 parasites, suggesting that tubules stabilized by the TgGRA2 and TgGRA6 proteins secreted by the parasite within the PV contribute to host vesicle sequestration. Overexpression of a phospholipase TgLCAT, which is localized to the IVN, results in a decrease in the number of intravacuolar GFP-Rab11A vesicles, suggesting that TgLCAT controls lipolytic degradation of Rab vesicles for cargo release.
LCAT is an enzyme responsible for the formation of cholesteryl esters from unesterified cholesterol (UC) and phospholipid (PL) molecules in HDL particles. However, it is poorly understood how LCAT interacts with lipoproteins and how apoA-I activates it. Here we have studied the interactions between LCAT and lipids through molecular simulations. In addition, we studied the binding of LCAT to apoA-I-derived peptides, and their effect on LCAT lipid association-utilizing experiments. Results show that LCAT anchors itself to lipoprotein surfaces by utilizing nonpolar amino acids located in the membrane-binding domain and the active site tunnel opening. Meanwhile, the membrane-anchoring hydrophobic amino acids attract cholesterol molecules next to them. The results also highlight the role of the lid-loop in the lipid binding and conformation of LCAT with respect to the lipid surface. The apoA-I-derived peptides from the LCAT-activating region bind to LCAT and promote its lipid surface interactions, although some of these peptides do not bind lipids individually. The transfer free-energy of PL from the lipid bilayer into the active site is consistent with the activation energy of LCAT. Furthermore, the entry of UC molecules into the active site becomes highly favorable by the acylation of SER181.
The measurement of lecithin: cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT, EC 2.3.1.43) activity is important in high-density lipoprotein (HDL) metabolism study and cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk assessment. However, current methods suffer from complex design and preparation of exogenous substrate, low reproducibility, and interference of cofactors. In this study, we developed a simple and precise high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method for the measurement of LCAT activity. By using 7-dehydrocholesterol (7-DHC) and 1,2-didecanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine(10:0PC) as substrates, and an LCAT activating peptide (P642) as activator and emulsifier, the substrate reagent was easily made by vortex. The substrate reagent was mixed with serum samples (50:1, v/v) and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. After incubation, the lipid was extracted with hexane and ethanol. With a conjugated double bond and ultraviolet absorption, 7-DHC and its esterification product could be separated and analyzed by a single HPLC run without calibration. LCAT activity was a linear function of the serum sample volume and the intra- and total assay coefficients of variation (CV) less than 2.5% were obtained under the standardized conditions. The substrate reagent was stable, and assay result accurately reflected LCAT activity. LCAT activities in 120 healthy subjects were positively correlated with triglyceride (P &lt; 0.05), fractional esterification rate of HDL cholesterol (FERHDL) (P &lt; 0.0001), and negatively correlated with apolipoprotein AI (apoAI) (P &lt; 0.05) and HDL cholesterol (HDL-C) (P &lt; 0.001). These results suggest that this method is sensitive, reproducible, and not greatly influenced by serum components and added substances, and will be a useful tool in the lipid metabolism study and the risk assessment of CVD.
Formation of foam cells is a hallmark at the initial stages of atherosclerosis. Monocytes attracted by pro-inflammatory stimuli attach to the inflamed vascular endothelium and penetrate to the arterial intima where they differentiate to macrophages. Intimal macrophages phagocytize oxidized low-density lipoproteins (oxLDL). Several scavenger receptors (SR), including CD36, SR-A1 and lectin-like oxLDL receptor-1 (LOX-1), mediate oxLDL uptake. In late endosomes/lysosomes of macrophages, oxLDL are catabolysed. Lysosomal acid lipase (LAL) hydrolyses cholesterol esters that are enriched in LDL to free cholesterol and free fatty acids. In the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), acyl coenzyme A: cholesterol acyltransferase-1 (ACAT1) in turn catalyses esterification of cholesterol to store cholesterol esters as lipid droplets in the ER of macrophages. Neutral cholesteryl ester hydrolases nCEH and NCEH1 are involved in a secondary hydrolysis of cholesterol esters to liberate free cholesterol that could be then out-flowed from macrophages by cholesterol ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters ABCA1 and ABCG1 and SR-BI. In atherosclerosis, disruption of lipid homoeostasis in macrophages leads to cholesterol accumulation and formation of foam cells. 
Alterations in the expression and activity of the transcriptional coactivator peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator-1α (ppargc1a or PGC-1α) have been reported in multiple movement disorders, yet it is unclear how a lack of PGC-1α impacts transcription and function of the cerebellum, a region with high PGC-1α expression. We show here that mice lacking PGC-1α exhibit ataxia in addition to the previously described deficits in motor coordination. Using q-RT-PCR in cerebellar homogenates from PGC-1α(-/-) mice, we measured expression of 37 microarray-identified transcripts upregulated by PGC-1α in SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells with neuroanatomical overlap with PGC-1α or parvalbumin (PV), a calcium buffer highly expressed by Purkinje cells. We found significant reductions in transcripts with synaptic (complexin1, Cplx1; Pacsin2), structural (neurofilament heavy chain, Nefh), and metabolic (isocitrate dehydrogenase 3a, Idh3a; neutral cholesterol ester hydrolase 1, Nceh1; pyruvate dehydrogenase alpha 1, Pdha1; phytanoyl-CoA hydroxylase, Phyh; ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase, Rieske iron-sulfur polypeptide 1, Uqcrfs1) functions. Using conditional deletion of PGC-1α in PV-positive neurons, we determined that 50% of PGC-1α expression and a reduction in a subset of these transcripts could be explained by its concentration in PV-positive neuronal populations in the cerbellum. To determine whether there were functional consequences associated with these changes, we conducted stereological counts and spike rate analysis in Purkinje cells, a cell type rich in PV, from PGC-1α(-/-) mice. We observed a significant loss of Purkinje cells by 6 weeks of age, and the remaining Purkinje cells exhibited a 50% reduction in spike rate. Together, these data highlight the complexity of PGC-1α's actions in the central nervous system and suggest that dysfunction in multiple cell types contribute to motor deficits in the context of PGC-1α deficiency. 
Accumulating evidence strongly implicates the transcriptional coactivator peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator 1α (PGC-1α) in the pathophysiology of multiple neurological disorders, but the downstream gene targets of PGC-1α in the brain have remained enigmatic. Previous data demonstrate that PGC-1α is primarily concentrated in inhibitory neurons and that PGC-1α is required for the expression of the interneuron-specific Ca(2+)-binding protein parvalbumin (PV) throughout the cortex. To identify other possible transcriptional targets of PGC-1α in neural tissue, we conducted a microarray on neuroblastoma cells overexpressing PGC-1α, mined results for genes with physiological relevance to interneurons, and measured cortical gene and protein expression of these genes in mice with underexpression and overexpression of PGC-1α. We observed bidirectional regulation of novel PGC-1α-dependent transcripts spanning synaptic [synaptotagmin 2 (Syt2) and complexin 1 (Cplx1)], structural [neurofilament heavy chain (Nefh)], and metabolic [neutral cholesterol ester hydrolase 1 (Nceh1), adenylate kinase 1 (Ak1), inositol polyphosphate 5-phosphatase J (Inpp5j), ATP synthase mitochondrial F1 complex O subunit (Atp5o), phytanol-CoA-2hydroxylase (Phyh), and ATP synthase mitrochondrial F1 complex α subunit 1 (Atp5a1)] functions. The neuron-specific genes Syt2, Cplx1, and Nefh were developmentally upregulated in an expression pattern consistent with that of PGC-1α and were expressed in cortical interneurons. Conditional deletion of PGC-1α in PV-positive neurons significantly decreased cortical transcript expression of these genes, promoted asynchronous GABA release, and impaired long-term memory. Collectively, these data demonstrate that PGC-1α is required for normal PV-positive interneuron function and that loss of PGC-1α in this interneuron subpopulation could contribute to cortical dysfunction in disease states.
As a cholesterol-induced metabolic disease, cholesterolosis of the gallbladder is often resected clinically, which could lead to many complications. The histopathology of cholesterolosis is due to excessive lipid droplet accumulation in epithelial and subcutaneous tissues. The main components of lipid droplets are cholesterol esters (CEs). Removal of CEs from gallbladder epithelial cells (GBECs) is very important for maintaining intracellular cholesterol homeostasis and for treating cholesterol-related diseases. In this study, pioglitazone was used to reduce intracellular CEs. To further elucidate the mechanism, cholesterolosis GBECs were treated with pioglitazone, 22-(R)-hydroxycholesterol (a liver X receptor α (LXRα) agonist), or peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) siRNA. Western blotting for PPARγ, LXRα, ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1), and neutral cholesteryl ester hydrolase 1 (NCEH1) was performed. At length, cholesterol efflux to apoA-I was measured, and oil red O staining was used to visualize lipid droplet variations in cells. In conclusion, we observed that pioglitazone increased ABCA1 expression in an LXR-dependent manner and NCEH1 expression in an LXRα-independent manner, which mobilized CE hydrolysis and cholesterol efflux to reduce lipid droplet content in cholesterolosis GBECs. Our data provide a plausible alternative to human gallbladder cholesterolosis. 
Inflammation is a hallmark of many human diseases, including pain, arthritis, atherosclerosis, obesity and diabetes, cancer, and neurodegenerative diseases. Although there are several successfully marketed small molecules anti-inflammatory drugs such as cyclooxygenase inhibitors and glucocorticoids, many of these compounds are also associated with various adverse cardiovascular or immunosuppressive side effects. Thus, identifying novel anti-inflammatory small molecules and their targets is critical for developing safer and more effective next-generation treatment strategies for inflammatory diseases. Here, we have conducted a chemical genetics screen to identify small molecules that suppress the release of the inflammatory cytokine TNFα from stimulated macrophages. We have used an enzyme class-directed chemical library for our screening efforts to facilitate subsequent target identification using activity-based protein profiling (ABPP). Using this strategy, we have found that KIAA1363 is a novel target for lowering key pro-inflammatory cytokines through affecting key ether lipid metabolism pathways. Our study highlights the application of combining chemical genetics with chemoproteomic and metabolomic approaches toward identifying and characterizing anti-inflammatory smal molecules and their targets. 
Psoriasis is an immune-mediated inflammatory disease, which is associated with a high risk of developing systemic comorbidities, such as obesity, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes mellitus. However, the mechanistic links between psoriatic skin inflammation and systemic comorbidities remain largely unknown. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are recently discovered gene regulators that play important roles in psoriasis skin inflammation. In this study we aimed to explore whether the skin inflammation in psoriasis affects miRNA expression of the underlying subcutaneous adipose tissue and whether this may be a link between psoriasis and comorbidities. To this end, we compared the miRNA expression profile of subcutaneous adipose tissue underneath lesional and nonlesional psoriatic skin. We further validated the differential expression of several miRNAs and characterized their expression patterns in different cell types present in subcutaneous adipose tissue. We focused on miR-26b-5p, which was highly up-regulated in subcutaneous adipose tissue underneath lesional psoriasis skin. We showed that it targets and down-regulates neutral cholesterol ester hydrolase 1, an enzyme essential for cholesterol efflux, in monocytes/macrophages, adipocytes, vascular endothelial cells, and fibroblasts. We conclude that this miRNA may serve as a mechanistic link between psoriatic skin inflammation and its systemic comorbidities. 
The low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1) is a ubiquitously expressed cell surface receptor that protects from intracellular cholesterol accumulation. However, the underlying mechanisms are unknown. Here we show that the extracellular (α) chain of LRP1 mediates TGFβ-induced enhancement of Wnt5a, which limits intracellular cholesterol accumulation by inhibiting cholesterol biosynthesis and by promoting cholesterol export. Moreover, we demonstrate that the cytoplasmic (β) chain of LRP1 suffices to limit cholesterol accumulation in LRP1(-/-) cells. Through binding of Erk2 to the second of its carboxyl-terminal NPXY motifs, LRP1 β-chain positively regulates the expression of ATP binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) and of neutral cholesterol ester hydrolase (NCEH1). These results highlight the unexpected functions of LRP1 and the canonical Wnt5a pathway and new therapeutic potential in cholesterol-associated disorders including cardiovascular diseases. 
Oxons are bioactive metabolites of organophosphorus insecticides (OPs) that covalently inactivate serine hydrolases. KIAA1363 is one of the most abundant serine hydrolases in mouse brain. Although the physiological consequences related to the inhibition of KIAA1363 due to environmental exposures to OPs are poorly understood, the enzyme was previously shown to have a role in the detoxification of oxons. Here, we overexpressed human KIAA1363 and CES1 in COS7 cells and compared the potency of inhibition (IC50s, 15 min) of KIAA1363 and CES1 by chlorpyrifos oxon (CPO), paraoxon (PO), and methyl paraoxon (MPO). The order of potency was CPO &gt; PO &gt; MPO for both enzymes. We also determined the bimolecular rate constants (kinact/Ki) for reactions of CPO and PO with KIAA1363 and CES1. KIAA1363 and CES1 were inactivated by CPO at comparable rates (4.4 × 10(6) s(-1) M(-1) and 6.7 × 10(6) s(-1) M(-1), respectively), whereas PO inactivated both enzymes at slower rates (0.4 × 10(6) s(-1) M(-1) and 1.5 × 10(6) s(-1) M(-1), respectively). Finally, the reactivation rate of KIAA1363 following inhibition by CPO was evaluated. Together, the results define the kinetics of inhibition of KIAA1363 by active metabolites of agrochemicals and indicate that KIAA1363 is highly sensitive to inhibition by these compounds. 
Parkinson's disease (PD) is an aging-associated neurodegenerative disease affecting millions worldwide. Misfolding, oligomerization and accumulation of the human α-synuclein protein is a key pathological hallmark of PD and is associated with the progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons over the course of aging. Lifespan extension via the suppression of IGF-1/insulin-like signaling (IIS) offers a possibility to retard disease onset through induction of metabolic changes that provide neuroprotection. The nceh-1 gene of Caenorhabditis elegans encodes an ortholog of neutral cholesterol ester hydrolase 1 (NCEH-1), an IIS downstream protein that was identified in a screen as a modulator of α-synuclein accumulation in vivo. The mechanism whereby cholesterol metabolism functionally impacts neurodegeneration induced by α-synuclein is undefined. Here we report that NCEH-1 protects dopaminergic neurons from α-synuclein-dependent neurotoxicity in C. elegans via a mechanism that is independent of lifespan extension. We discovered that the presence of cholesterol, LDLR-mediated cholesterol endocytosis, and cholesterol efflux are all essential to NCEH-1-mediated neuroprotection. In protecting from α-synuclein neurotoxicity, NCEH-1 also stimulates cholesterol-derived neurosteroid formation and lowers cellular reactive oxygen species in mitochondria. Collectively, this study augments our understanding of how cholesterol metabolism can modulate a neuroprotective mechanism that attenuates α-synuclein neurotoxicity, thereby pointing toward regulation of neuronal cholesterol turnover as a potential therapeutic avenue for PD.
The first NIR KIAA1363-targeting probe, NB-AX, specifically and instantly featured an "off-on" switch upon gradual addition of KIAA1363 over all kinds of other biomolecules, and its detection limit was initially calculated to be 0.58 μg mL-1 (3δ/k). The probe was also able to be used in ultrafast distinguishing of breast cancer cells from normal cells in fluorescence imaging and applied in tissue imaging and tumor imaging in vivo.
Omentin-1, a novel adipocytokine expressed in visceral fat tissue, is negatively correlated with obesity, insulin resistance, and stable coronary artery disease (CAD). However, there have been no previous reports regarding the effects of omentin-1 on atherogenesis.
This study was performed to evaluate the atheroprotective effects of omentin-1 on human monocyte-derived macrophages, human aortic smooth muscle cells (HASMCs) in vitro, and aortic lesions in Apoe(-/-) mice in vivo. The histological expression of omentin-1 in coronary artery lesions and epicardial adipose tissues and its plasma levels were compared between CAD and non-CAD patients. Omentin-1 was abundantly expressed in human umbilical vein endothelial cells, macrophages, HASMCs, and human coronary artery SMCs in vitro. Omentin-1 promoted anti-inflammatory M2 phenotype during differentiation of human monocytes into macrophages. Omentin-1 suppressed oxidized low-density lipoprotein-induced foam cell formation associated with down-regulation of CD36, scavenger receptor class A, and acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase-1 and up-regulation of neutral cholesterol ester hydrolase in human macrophages. Omentin-1 suppressed angiotensin II-induced migration and platelet-derived growth factor-BB-induced proliferation, and collagen-1 and -3 expression in HASMCs. Four-week infusion of omentin-1 into Apoe(-/-) mice retarded the development of aortic atherosclerotic lesions with reduced contents of monocytes/macrophages, SMCs, and collagen fibres along with peritoneal M2-activated macrophages with inflammasome down-regulation and lowered plasma total cholesterol levels. Omentin-1 levels were markedly reduced in coronary endothelium and epicardial fat but increased in plasma and atheromatous plaques (macrophages/SMCs) in CAD patients compared with non-CAD patients.
This study provided the first evidence that omentin-1 may serve as a novel therapeutic target for atherosclerosis and CAD.
Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and cholesterol homeostasis in the peripheral blood is maintained by specialized cells, such as macrophages. Macrophages express a variety of scavenger receptors (SR) that interact with lipoproteins, including SR-A1, CD36, and lectin-like oxLDL receptor-1 (LOX-1). These cells also have several cholesterol transporters, including ATP-binding cassette transporter ABCA1, ABCG1, and SR-BI, that are involved in reverse cholesterol transport. Lipids internalized by phagocytosis are transported to late endosomes/lysosomes, where lysosomal acid lipase (LAL) digests cholesteryl esters releasing free cholesterol. Free cholesterol in turn is processed by acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase (ACAT1), an enzyme that transforms cholesterol to cholesteryl esters. The endoplasmic reticulum serves as a depot for maintaining newly synthesized cholesteryl esters that can be processed by neutral cholesterol ester hydrolase (NCEH), which generates free cholesterol that can exit via cholesterol transporters. In atherosclerosis, pro-inflammatory stimuli upregulate expression of scavenger receptors, especially LOX-1, and downregulate expression of cholesterol transporters. ACAT1 is also increased, while NCEH expression is reduced. This results in deposition of free and esterified cholesterol in macrophages and generation of foam cells. Moreover, other cell types, such as endothelial (ECs) and vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs), can also become foam cells. In this review, we discuss known pathways of foam cell formation in atherosclerosis.
Variations in the gene LDAH (C2ORF43), which encodes lipid droplet-associated hydrolase (LDAH), are among few loci associated with human prostate cancer. Homologs of LDAH have been identified as proteins of lipid droplets (LDs). LDs are cellular organelles that store neutral lipids, such as triacylglycerols and sterol esters, as precursors for membrane components and as reservoirs of metabolic energy. LDAH is reported to hydrolyze cholesterol esters and to be important in macrophage cholesterol ester metabolism. Here, we confirm that LDAH is localized to LDs in several model systems. We generated a murine model in which Ldah is disrupted but found no evidence for a major function of LDAH in cholesterol ester or triacylglycerol metabolism in vivo, nor a role in energy or glucose metabolism. Our data suggest that LDAH is not a major cholesterol ester hydrolase, and an alternative metabolic function may be responsible for its possible effect on development of prostate cancer.
The NOD-like receptor family, pyrin domain-containing protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome plays an important role in the development of atherosclerosis. The activated NLRP3 inflammasome has been reported to promote macrophage foam cell formation, but not all studies have obtained the same result, and how NLRP3 inflammasome is involved in the formation of foam cells remains elusive. We used selective NLRP3 inflammasome inhibitors and NLRP3-deficient THP-1 cells to assess the effect of NLRP3 inflammasome inhibition on macrophage foam cell formation, oxidized low-density lipoprotein (ox-LDL) uptake, esterification, and cholesterol efflux, as well as the expression of associated proteins. Inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome attenuated foam cell formation, diminished ox-LDL uptake, and promoted cholesterol efflux from THP-1 macrophages. Moreover, it downregulated CD36, acyl coenzyme A: cholesterol acyltransferase-1 and neutral cholesterol ester hydrolase expression; upregulated ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) and scavenger receptor class B type I (SR-BI) expression; but had no effect on the expression of scavenger receptor class A and ATP-binding cassette transporter G1. Collectively, our findings show that inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome decreases foam cell formation of THP-1 macrophages via suppression of ox-LDL uptake and enhancement of cholesterol efflux, which may be due to downregulation of CD36 expression and upregulation of ABCA1 and SR-BI expression, respectively.
KIAA1363 is a serine hydrolase whose activity has been shown to be positively associated with tumor cell invasiveness. Thus, inhibitors of KIAA1363 represent a novel targeted therapy approach towards cancer. AX11890 ((1-bromo-2-naphthyl) N,N-dimethylcarbamate) was identified as a KIAA1363 inhibitor with an IC(50) value of 1.2 μM and was shown using ESI-MS to carbamylate the catalytic residue Ser(191). SAR studies explored both substitution of the 1-bromo group and derivatization of the 6-position. Activity-based protein profiling demonstrated AX13057 inhibited tumor-localized KIAA1363 in SK-OV-3 xenograft-bearing mice.
Cancer cells show alterations in metabolism that support malignancy and disease progression. Prominent among these metabolic changes is elevations in neutral ether lipids (NELs). We have previously shown that the hydrolytic enzyme KIAA1363 (or AADACL1) is highly elevated in aggressive cancer cells, where it plays a key role in generating the monoalkylglycerol ether (MAGE) class of NELs. Here, we use activity-based protein profiling-guided medicinal chemistry to discover a highly potent and selective inhibitor of KIAA1363, the carbamate JW480. We show that JW480, and an shRNA probe that targets KIAA1363, reduce MAGEs and impair the migration, invasion, survival, and in vivo tumor growth of human prostate cancer cell lines. These findings indicate that the KIAA1363-MAGE pathway is important for prostate cancer pathogenesis and designate JW480 as a versatile pharmacological probe for disrupting this pro-tumorigenic metabolic pathway.
A comprehensive knowledge of the platelet proteome is necessary for understanding thrombosis and for envisioning antiplatelet therapies. To discover other biochemical pathways in human platelets, we screened platelets with a carbamate library designed to interrogate the serine hydrolase subproteome and used competitive activity-based protein profiling to map the targets of active carbamates. We identified an inhibitor that targets arylacetamide deacetylase-like 1 (AADACL1), a lipid deacetylase originally identified in invasive cancers. Using this compound, along with highly selective second-generation inhibitors of AADACL1, metabolomics, and RNA interference, we show that AADACL1 regulates platelet aggregation, thrombus growth, RAP1 and PKC activation, lipid metabolism, and fibrinogen binding to platelets and megakaryocytes. These data provide evidence that AADACL1 regulates platelet and megakaryocyte activation and highlight the value of this chemoproteomic strategy for target discovery in platelets. 
Lipid droplets are universal intracellular organelles composed of a triglyceride, cholesteryl ester and retinyl ester core, surrounded by a monolayer of phospholipids and free (unesterified) cholesterol and lipid droplet-associated proteins. Core lipids are hydrolyzed by lipases to provide fatty acids, cholesterol and retinol for various cellular functions. In addition to cytosolic adipose triglyceride lipase and hormone-sensitive lipase, recent studies show the existence of other neutral lipid hydrolases that reside in the endoplasmic reticulum. In this review we highlight the role of these novel lipases including several members of the carboxylesterase family and enzymes termed arylacetamide deacetylase and KIAA1363/neutral cholesteryl ester hydrolase1/arylacetamide deacetylase-like 1. Some of these enzymes might be attractive targets for the treatment of dyslipidemias, viral infection and atherosclerosis.
An excess of cholesterol and/or oxysterols induces apoptosis in macrophages, contributing to the development of advanced atherosclerotic lesions. In foam cells, these sterols are stored in esterified forms, which are hydrolyzed by two enzymes: neutral cholesterol ester hydrolase 1 (Nceh1) and hormone-sensitive lipase (Lipe). A deficiency in either enzyme leads to accelerated growth of atherosclerotic lesions in mice. However, it is poorly understood how the esterification and hydrolysis of sterols are linked to apoptosis. Remarkably, Nceh1-deficient thioglycollate-elicited peritoneal macrophages (TGEMs), but not Lipe-deficient TGEMs, were more susceptible to apoptosis induced by oxysterols, particularly 25-hydroxycholesterol (25-HC), and incubation with 25-HC caused massive accumulation of 25-HC ester in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) due to its defective hydrolysis, thereby activating ER stress signaling such as induction of CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein-homologous protein (CHOP). These changes were nearly reversed by inhibition of ACAT1. In conclusion, deficiency of Nceh1 augments 25-HC-induced ER stress and subsequent apoptosis in TGEMs. In addition to reducing the cholesteryl ester content of foam cells, Nceh1 may protect against the pro-apoptotic effect of oxysterols and modulate the development of atherosclerosis. 
Crusted or Norwegian scabies is an infectious skin dermatopathology usually associated with an underlying immunodeficiency condition. It is caused when the mite Sarcoptes scabiei infects the skin, and the immune system is unable to control its spread, leading to a massive hyperinfestation with a simultaneous inflammatory and hyperkeratotic reaction. This is the first report of a novel 1p36 duplication associated with a recurrent infection of crusted scabies.
We describe a 34-year-old patient with a cutaneous immunodeficiency characterized by recurrent crusted scabies infestation, diffuse tinea, and recurrent staphylococcal cellulitis, who we suspected had an undiagnosed syndrome. The patient also suffered from mental retardation, renal failure, and premature senescence. A cytogenetic fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis revealed a 9.34 Mb duplication within the short (p) arm of chromosome 1, precisely from 1p36.11 to 1p36.21, with an adjacent 193 kb copy gain entirely within 1p36.11. In addition, chromosome 4 had a 906 kb gain in 4p16.1 and chromosome 9 had a 81 kb copy gain in 9p24.3. Over 100 genes localized within these duplicated regions. Gene expression array revealed 82 genes whose expression changed &gt;1.5-fold compared to a healthy age-matched skin control, but among them only the lipolytic enzyme arylacetamide deacetylase-like 3 was found within the duplicated 1p36 region of chromosome 1.
Although genetic duplications in the 1p36 region have been previously described, our report describes a novel duplicative variant within the 1p36 region. The patient did not have a past history of immunosuppression but was afflicted by a recurrent case of crusted scabies, raising the possibility that the recurrent infection was associated with the 1p36 genetic duplication.
To our knowledge, the specific duplicated sequence between 1p36.11 and p36.21 found in our patient has never been previously reported. We reviewed and compared the clinical, genotyping, and gene microarray results of our patient in order to characterize this novel 1p36 duplication syndrome, which might have contributed to the recurrent scabies infection in this patient.
The development of potent and selective inhibitors of the biosynthesis of the endocannabinoid 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) via DAG lipases (DAGL) α and β is just starting to be considered as a novel and promising source of pharmaceuticals for the treatment of disorders that might benefit from a reduction in endocannabinoid tone, such as hyperphagia in obese subjects.
Three new fluorophosphonate compounds O-7458, O-7459 and O-7460 were synthesized and characterized in various enzymatic assays. The effects of O-7460 on high-fat diet intake were tested in mice.
Of the new compounds, O-7460 exhibited the highest potency (IC₅₀ = 690 nM) against the human recombinant DAGLα, and selectivity (IC₅₀ &gt; 10 μM) towards COS-7 cell and human monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL), and rat brain fatty acid amide hydrolase. Competitive activity-based protein profiling confirmed that O-7460 inhibits mouse brain MAGL only at concentrations ≥ 10 μM, and showed that this compound has only one major 'off-target', that is, the serine hydrolase KIAA1363. O-7460 did not exhibit measurable affinity for human recombinant CB₁ or CB₂ cannabinoid receptors (Ki &gt; 10 μM). In mouse neuroblastoma N18TG2 cells stimulated with ionomycin, O-7460 (10 μM) reduced 2-AG levels. When administered to mice, O-7460 dose-dependently (0-12 mg·kg⁻¹, i.p.) inhibited the intake of a high-fat diet over a 14 h observation period, and, subsequently, slightly but significantly reduced body weight.
O-7460 might be considered a useful pharmacological tool to investigate further the role played by 2-AG both in vitro and in vivo under physiological as well as pathological conditions.
Several controversies exist related to the molecular identity and subcellular localization of the enzyme catalyzing macrophage cholesteryl ester hydrolysis. Some of these issues have been reviewed earlier and this review summarizes new developments that describe effects of overexpression or gene ablation. The main objective is to highlight the disagreement between lack of gene expression and incomplete abolition of macrophage cholesteryl ester hydrolytic activity and to emphasize the importance of redundancy.
New information resulting from the continuing characterization of the various cholesteryl ester hydrolases (hormone-sensitive lipase, HSL; cholesteryl ester hydrolase, CEH; and KIAA1363/NCEH1) is reviewed. Whereas CEH overexpression leads to beneficial effects such as decreased inflammation, improved glucose tolerance/insulin sensitivity, and attenuation of atherosclerotic lesion progression, deficiency/ablation of HSL or KIAA1363/NCEH1 results in incomplete loss of macrophage cholesteryl ester hydrolysis/turnover. New paradigms challenging the classical view of cytoplasmic cholesteryl ester hydrolysis and reverse cholesterol transport are also presented.
The observed beneficial effects of CEH overexpression identify macrophage cholesteryl ester hydrolysis as an important therapeutic target and future studies will determine whether similar effects are obtained with overexpression of HSL or KIAA1363/NCEH1. It is imperative that, for clinical benefit, mechanisms to enhance endogenous cholesteryl ester hydrolase(s) are established.
The profiles of serine hydrolases in human and mouse macrophages are similar yet different. For instance, human macrophages express high levels of carboxylesterase 1 (CES1), whereas mouse macrophages have minimal amounts of the orthologous murine CES1. On the other hand, macrophages from both species exhibit limited expression of the canonical 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) hydrolytic enzyme, MAGL. Our previous study showed CES1 was partly responsible for the hydrolysis of 2-AG (50%) and prostaglandin glyceryl esters (PG-Gs) (80-95%) in human THP1 monocytes and macrophages. However, MAGL and other endocannabinoid hydrolases, FAAH, ABHD6, and ABHD12, did not have a role because of limited expression or no expression. Thus, another enzyme was hypothesized to be responsible for the remaining 2-AG hydrolysis activity following chemical inhibition and immunodepletion of CES1 (previous study) or CES1 gene knockdown (this study). Here we identified two candidate serine hydrolases in THP1 cell lysates by activity-based protein profiling (ABPP)-MUDPIT and Western blotting: cathepsin G and palmitoyl protein thioesterase 1 (PPT1). Both proteins exhibited electrophoretic properties similar to those of a serine hydrolase in THP1 cells detected by gel-based ABPP at 31-32 kDa; however, only PPT1 exhibited lipolytic activity and hydrolyzed 2-AG in vitro. Interestingly, PPT1 was strongly expressed in THP1 cells but was significantly less reactive than cathepsin G toward the activity-based probe, fluorophosphonate-biotin. KIAA1363, another serine hydrolase, was also identified in THP1 cells but did not have significant lipolytic activity. On the basis of chemoproteomic profiling, immunodepletion studies, and chemical inhibitor profiles, we estimated that PPT1 contributed 32-40% of 2-AG hydrolysis activity in the THP1 cell line. In addition, pure recombinant PPT1 catalyzed the hydrolysis of 2-AG, PGE2-G, and PGF2α-G, although the catalytic efficiency of hydrolysis of 2-AG by PPT1 was ~10-fold lower than that of CES1. PPT1 was also insensitive to several chemical inhibitors that potently inhibit CES1, such as organophosphate poisons and JZL184. This is the first report to document the expression of PPT1 in a human monocyte and macrophage cell line and to show PPT1 can hydrolyze the natural substrates 2-AG and PG-Gs. These findings suggest that PPT1 may participate in endocannabinoid metabolism within specific cellular contexts and highlights the functional redundancy often exhibited by enzymes involved in lipid metabolism.
Lowering LDL cholesterol reduces the risk of atherosclerotic vascular disease in a wide range of patients with chronic kidney disease, with no evidence of a threshold below which further reductions no longer reduce risk. Statins safely lower LDL cholesterol, but novel inhibitors of proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin 9 (PCSK9) provide additional reductions which may reduce atherosclerotic vascular disease yet further in this high risk population.
A healthy diet is an important component of secondary prevention of coronary heart disease (CHD). The TEXT ME study was a randomised clinical trial of people with CHD that were randomised into standard care or a text-message programme in addition to standard care. This analysis aimed to: 1) assess the effects of the intervention onadherence to the dietary guideline recommendations; 2) assess the consistency of effect across sub-groups; and 3) assess whether adherence to the dietary guideline recommendations mediated the improvements in objective clinical outcomes.
Dietary data were collected using a self-report questionnaire to evaluate adherence to eight dietary guideline recommendations in Australia, including consumption of vegetables, fruits, fish, type of fat used for cooking and in spreads, takeaway food, salt and standard alcohol drinks. The primary outcome of this analysis was the proportion of patients adhering to ≥ 4 dietary guideline recommendations concomitantly and each recommendation was assessed individually as secondary outcomes. Data were analysed using log-binomial regression for categorical variables and analysis of covariance for continuous variables.
Among 710 patients, 54% were adhering to ≥ 4 dietary guideline recommendations (intervention 53% vs control 56%, p = 0.376) at baseline. At six months, the intervention group had a significantly higher proportion of patients adhering to ≥ 4 recommendations (314, 93%) compared to the control group (264, 75%, RR 1.23, 95% CI 1.15-1.31, p &lt; 0.001). In addition, the intervention patients reported consuming higher amounts of vegetables, fruits, and fish per week; less takeaway foods per week; and greater salt intake control. The intervention had a similar effect in all sub-groups tested. There were significant mediational effects of the increase in adherence to the recommendations for the association between the intervention and LDL-cholesterol (p &lt; 0.001) and body mass index (BMI) at six months follow-up (p = 0.005).
A lifestyle-focused text-message programme improved adherence to the dietary guideline recommendations, and specifically improved self-reported consumption of vegetables, fruits, fish, takeaway foods and salt intake. Importantly, these improvements partially mediated improvements in LDL-cholesterol and BMI. This simple and scalable text-messaging intervention could be used as a strategy to improve diet in people with CHD.

Gallstones are one of the most common diseases worldwide. Recently, the incidence of gallstones has increased and the pattern of gallstones has changed in Korea. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is the standard treatment for symptomatic gallstones. Expectant management is considered the most appropriate choice in patients with asymptomatic gallstones. The dissolution of cholesterol gallstones by oral bile acid, such as ursodeoxycholic acid, can be considered in selected patients with gallstones. Although the advent of laparoscopic cholecystectomy has moved interest away from the pharmacologic treatment of gallstones, several promising agents related to various mechanisms are under investigation.
Purpose The purpose of this study is to evaluate the impact of a collaborative diabetes shared medical appointment on patient outcomes in an urban family medicine practice. Methods Fifty-nine patients were enrolled to participate in multiple shared medical appointments (SMAs) over 12 months. Baseline data included hemoglobin (A1C), lipids, systolic blood pressure (SBP), weight, adherence to American Diabetes Association (ADA) guidelines, and surveys, including the Problem Areas in Diabetes (PAID-2) scale and the Spoken Knowledge in Low Literacy in Diabetes Scale (SKILLD). A1C and SBP were evaluated at each visit. Lipid control was assessed at baseline and at 6 and 12 months. Adherence to ADA guidelines, SKILLD and PAID-2 survey scores, and number of antihyperglycemic and antihypertensive medications were also evaluated at 12 months. Results Thirty-eight patients completed the study. Compared with baseline, A1C and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels decreased significantly over 12 months ( P &lt; .001 and P = .004, respectively). More patients became compliant with the ADA guidelines throughout the course of the study. Specifically, more patients achieved the LDL-C goal of ≤100 mg/dL (2.59 mmol/L; P &lt; .001), were prescribed appropriate antihypertensive medications ( P &lt; .001) and aspirin ( P &lt; .001), and received the pneumonia vaccine ( P &lt; .001). PAID-2 and SKILLD survey scores also significantly improved over the course of the study ( P ≤ .001 and P = .003, respectively). Conclusion Short-term interdisciplinary SMAs decreased A1C and LDL-C, improved patient adherence to ADA guidelines, improved emotional distress related to diabetes, and increased knowledge of diabetes.
Anger expression is assumed to have mostly negative health effects. Yet, evidence is mixed on how anger expression influences African Americans' cardiovascular health. The present research aimed to clarify this link by examining moderating effects of chronic discrimination on the relationship between anger expression and cardiovascular risk among African Americans in experimental (Study 1) and epidemiological (Study 2) studies.
Study 1 examined how African Americans' trait anger expression was linked to (a) physiologic reactivity to acute social rejection during an interracial encounter (Session 1); and (b) total/HDL cholesterol assessed two months later (Session 2). Study 2 examined the relationship between anger expression and total/HDL cholesterol with a larger sample of African Americans from the Midlife in the United States (MIDUS) survey. Both studies examined perceptions of chronic discrimination as a moderator of the relationships between anger expression and biological responses.
In Study 1 higher anger expression was associated with quicker cortisol recovery and greater testosterone reactivity following outgroup social rejection in Session 1 and lower total/HDL cholesterol in Session 2. Study 2 replicated the relationship between anger expression and lower total/HDL cholesterol and further showed that this relationship was unique to the expressive aspect of anger. Importantly, in both studies, these potentially beneficial effects of anger expression were only evident among individuals with lower perceptions of chronic discrimination.
These findings suggest that anger expression, when coupled with low levels of chronic discrimination, is associated with adaptive patterns of physiologic responses among African Americans. (PsycINFO Database Record
Because resveratrol (RSV) has been shown to improve learning and memory, so we investigated the potential benefit of RSV on learning and memory deficits in juvenile mice fed with a HC diet and explored the molecular mechanisms underlying this process.
Six-week-old C57BL/6J mice were divided into three different diet groups: control, HC diet, and HC + RSV diet. Serum insulin and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) levels were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Protein expression was examined by immunohistochemistry and western blotting.
Administration of RSV daily (30 mg/kg) prevented the HC diet-induced increase in juvenile animal body weight but did not improve any other physiological conditions, including fasting blood glucose and serum cholesterol, triglyceride, insulin, and IGF-1 levels. However, RSV did prevent learning and memory deficits in the HC group. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) was downregulated in the CA1 region of the hippocampus in both the HC and HC + RSV groups, but the reduction was significantly greater in the HC + RSV group (P &lt; .01 compared with the HC group). Moreover, although the HC diet reduced the number of p16-positive neurons, the HC + RSV diet significantly upregulated p16 expression in the CA1 region of the hippocampus (P &lt; .01 compared with the HC group).
RSV protected against learning and memory impairments in juvenile animals fed with a HC diet, possibly via upregulation of p16 or downregulation of PPARγ in the hippocampal CA1 region.
Atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases (ASCVDs) are associated with a substantial mortality, physical morbidity, and mental disability. Elevated plasma low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels play a major role in the pathophysiology of ASCVDs. Statins have been shown to reduce ASCVD risk and associated events and are recommended as first-line therapy for treatment of hypercholesterolemia by current international guidelines. The key issue is to attain guideline-recommended LDL-C levels (below 70 mg/dl) for patients at very high cardiovascular risk. However, many high-risk and very-high-risk patients on statin therapy remain beyond treatment goals despite lifestyle modification and statins, and are exposed to a high risk of future cardiovascular events including myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, revascularization procedures, and death. This clearly emphasizes the urgent need for additional LDL-C reduction with new therapeutic strategies to target these highly atherogenic particles and to further reduce the burden of ASCVDs. Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) plays a major role as a key regulator of the hepatic LDL receptor recycling process. Developments over the past 15 years have demonstrated PCSK9 inhibition to be a novel therapeutic strategy to manage increased LDL-C levels. A number of clinical studies using humanized monoclonal antibody technology against PCSK9 have shown profound reductions of LDL-C levels when used either alone or in combination with statin therapy. Recently, the first cardiovascular outcome study demonstrated a significant reduction of ASCV events when evolocumab was added to a statin therapy. This review will discuss current knowledge about antibody-mediated PCSK9 inhibition as add-on therapy to statin and the clinical potential that may be expected.
Non-LDL dyslipidemia (NLD) confers cardiovascular risk, and prevalence rates appear to be high in elderly populations. Small cohorts have identified several lifestyle, anthropometric, and medical factors associated with NLD. We aimed to assess sex- and age-specific prevalence of NLD in a contemporary population cohort (n = 167 729), and to identify independent determinants of NLD, focusing on lifestyle, anthropometric, and medical factors.
The prevalence of NLD was assessed per 10-year age intervals in adults without cardiovascular disease not using lipid-modifying drugs from the Dutch LifeLines cohort. NLD was defined as low HDL-cholesterol or high triglycerides or high remnant cholesterol as per guideline cut-off values. Multivariable regression was used to identify factors independently associated with NLD. Determinants included age, smoking, alcohol use, physical activity, diet, BMI, diabetes mellitus (DM), chronic kidney disease, and in women, menopausal state and oral contraceptive use.
NLD occurred in 15-19% of women and 13-30% of men in this cohort, with the highest prevalence of 30% in 35-55 year old men. In most age groups, the prevalence in women was lower than in men. Obesity (both sexes: Odds ratio (OR) 5.3, 95% confidence interval (95%CI) 5.0-5.7), current smoking (men: OR 1.8, 95%CI 1.7-1.9; women OR 2.2, 95%CI 2.1-2.3), and DM (men: OR 2.2, 95%CI 1.8-2.6; women: OR 2.7, 95%CI 2.3-3.1) were strongly associated with NLD.
NLD already occurs frequently at an early age. Modifiable lifestyle choices, obesity, and DM were strong determinants of NLD. Public health efforts could substantially contribute to decrease NLD.
Dietary habits may strongly influence intestinal homeostasis. Oxysterols, the oxidized products of cholesterol present in cholesterol-containing foodstuffs, have been shown to exert pro-oxidant and pro-inflammatory effects, altering intestinal epithelial layer and thus contributing to the pathogenesis of human inflammatory bowel diseases and colon cancer. Extra virgin olive oil polyphenols possess antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, and concentrate in the intestinal lumen, where may help in preventing intestinal diseases. In the present study we evaluated the ability of an extra virgin olive oil phenolic extract to counteract the pro-oxidant and pro-inflammatory action of a representative mixture of dietary oxysterols in the human colon adenocarcinoma cell line (Caco-2) undergoing full differentiation into enterocyte-like cells. Oxysterols treatment significantly altered differentiated Caco-2 cells redox status, leading to oxidant species production and a decrease of GSH levels, after 1 h exposure, followed by an increase of cytokines production, IL-6 and IL-8, after 24 h. Oxysterol cell treatment also induced after 48 h an increase of NO release, due to the induction of iNOS. Pretreatment with the phenolic extract counteracted oxysterols effects, at least in part by modulating one of the main pathways activated in the cellular response to the action of oxysterols, the MAPK-NF-kB pathway. We demonstrated the ability of the phenolic extract to directly modulate p38 and JNK1/2 phosphorylation and activation of NF-kB, following its inhibitor IkB phosphorylation. The phenolic extract also inhibited iNOS induction, keeping NO concentration at the control level. Our results suggest a protective effect at intestinal level of extra virgin olive oil polyphenols, able to prevent or limit redox unbalance and the onset and progression of chronic intestinal inflammation.
Viruses exploit the host and induce drastic metabolic changes to ensure an optimal environment for replication and the production of viral progenies. In response, the host has developed diverse countermeasures to sense and limit these alterations to combat viral infection. One such host mechanism is through interferon signaling. Interferons are cytokines that enhances the transcription of hundreds of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) whose products are key players in the innate immune response to viral infection. In addition to their direct targeting of viral components, interferons and ISGs exert profound effects on cellular metabolism. Recent studies have started to illuminate on the specific role of interferon in rewiring cellular metabolism to activate immune cells and limit viral infection. This review reflects on our current understanding of the complex networking that occurs between the virus and host at the interface of cellular metabolism, with a focus on the ISGs in particular, cholesterol-25-hydroxylase (CH25H), spermidine/spermine acetyltransferase 1 (SAT1), indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase (IDO1) and sterile alpha motif and histidine/aspartic acid domain-containing protein 1 (SAMHD1), which were recently discovered to modulate specific metabolic events and consequently deter viral infection.
Cholesterol 25-hydroxylase (CH25H) catalyzes the production of 25-hydroxycholesterol (25-HC), an oxysterol that can play an important role in different biological processes. However, the mechanisms regulating CH25H expression have not been fully elucidated. In this study, we determined that CH25H is highly expressed in mouse liver and peritoneal macrophages. We identified several liver X receptor (LXR) response elements (LXREs) in the human CH25H promoter. In HepG2 cells, activation of LXR by 25-HC or other oxysterols and synthetic ligands [T0901317 (T317) and GW3965] induced CH25H protein expression, which was associated with increased CH25H mRNA expression. 25-HC or T317 activated CH25H transcription in an LXRE-dependent manner. Thus, high-expressing LXRα or LXRβ activated CH25H expression, and the activation was further enhanced by LXR ligands. In contrast, inhibition of LXRα/β expression attenuated 25-HC or T317-induced CH25H expression. Deficiency of interferon γ expression reduced, but did not block, LXR ligand-induced hepatic CH25H expression. Activation of LXR also substantially induced macrophage CH25H expression. In vivo, administration of GW3965 to mice increased CH25H expression in both liver and peritoneal macrophages. Taken together, our study demonstrates that 25-HC can activate CH25H expression in an LXR-dependent manner, which may be an important mechanism to exert the biological actions of 25-HC.
Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA virus of the Arteriviridae family, has become a global health threat for swine. Cholesterol 25-hydroxylase (CH25H) is an enzyme that catalyzes oxidation of cholesterol to 25-hydroxycholesterol (25HC). The purpose of this study was to explore the antiviral activity of CH25H against PRRSV infection. We found that CH25H was induced by interferon-α and PRRSV in Marc-145 monkey kidney cells. In addition, CH25H and 25HC significantly inhibited PRRSV infection by preventing virus entry. A CH25H mutant that exhibited decreased catalytic activity had an antiviral effect against PRRSV. Treatment with 25HC pre-infection or post-infection significantly inhibited PRRSV infection in primary porcine alveolar macrophages. Our results reveal that CH25H is an interferon-stimulated gene and its production of 25HC can be used as a natural antiviral agent to combat PRRSV infection.
Type I interferon restrains interleukin-1β (IL-1β)-driven inflammation in macrophages by upregulating cholesterol-25-hydroxylase (Ch25h) and repressing SREBP transcription factors. However, the molecular links between lipid metabolism and IL-1β production remain obscure. Here, we demonstrate that production of 25-hydroxycholesterol (25-HC) by macrophages is required to prevent inflammasome activation by the DNA sensor protein absent in melanoma 2 (AIM2). We find that in response to bacterial infection or lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation, macrophages upregulate Ch25h to maintain repression of SREBP2 activation and cholesterol synthesis. Increasing macrophage cholesterol content is sufficient to trigger IL-1β release in a crystal-independent but AIM2-dependent manner. Ch25h deficiency results in cholesterol-dependent reduced mitochondrial respiratory capacity and release of mitochondrial DNA into the cytosol. AIM2 deficiency rescues the increased inflammasome activity observed in Ch25h-/-. Therefore, activated macrophages utilize 25-HC in an anti-inflammatory circuit that maintains mitochondrial integrity and prevents spurious AIM2 inflammasome activation.
The association of eosinophils with inflammation and tissue remodeling is at least partially due to their release of toxic granule proteins and other mediators, including cytokines. Tissue remodeling and consequent functional defects are affected by activity of connective tissue fibroblasts. Exaggerated fibroblast activation, accumulation and change of phenotype may lead to fibrosis and loss of tissue function. So far, little information has been reported on how eosinophils affect inflammation and tissue remodeling via the activation of fibroblasts. We have recently shown that eosinophil activation with IL-3 led to a robust eosinophil degranulation on immunoglobin-G (IgG) coated plates. Thus, in the present study, we analyze the effects of IL-3-activated eosinophil degranulation products on primary human lung fibroblasts (HLF) using whole transcriptome sequencing.
Conditioned media was obtained from eosinophils that were pre-activated with IL-3 or IL-5 and subsequently cultured for 6 h on IgG to induce degranulation. This conditioned media was added on human lung fibroblasts (HLF) for 24 h and the cell lysates were then subjected to whole transcriptome sequencing to identify global changes in gene expression. Differentially expressed genes were analyzed using the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA), and validated by qPCR.
In HLF, the expression level of 300 genes was changed by conditioned media from IL-3-activated eosinophils compared to control fibroblast cultures. Among these 300 genes, the expression level of 35 genes coding for known proteins was upregulated by IL-3- versus IL-5-pre-activated eosinophils. Of the 35 upregulated genes, IPA identified C3, CH25H, CXCL1, CXCL8, CYP1A1, ICAM1, IL6 and UCN2 as having downstream functions on inflammation, tissue remodeling and lipid synthesis. This analysis combined with previous RNA sequencing analyses of eosinophils suggest IL-1ß, OSM and TNFSF12 as potential upstream regulators of fibroblasts.
This study has identified several novel pro-inflammatory and pro-remodeling mediators produced by fibroblasts in response to activated eosinophils. These findings may have significant implications on the role of eosinophil/fibroblast interactions in eosinophilic disorders.
This review focuses on research in the areas of epidemiology, neuropathology, molecular biology and genetics that implicates herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) as a causative agent in the pathogenesis of sporadic Alzheimer's disease (AD). Molecular mechanisms whereby HSV-1 induces AD-related pathophysiology and pathology, including neuronal production and accumulation of amyloid beta (Aβ), hyperphosphorylation of tau proteins, dysregulation of calcium homeostasis, and impaired autophagy, are discussed. HSV-1 causes additional AD pathologies through mechanisms that promote neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, mitochondrial damage, synaptic dysfunction, and neuronal apoptosis. The AD susceptibility genes apolipoprotein E (APOE), phosphatidylinositol binding clathrin assembly protein (PICALM), complement receptor 1 (CR1) and clusterin (CLU) are involved in the HSV lifecycle. Polymorphisms in these genes may affect brain susceptibility to HSV-1 infection. APOE, for example, influences susceptibility to certain viral infections, HSV-1 viral load in the brain, and the innate immune response. The AD susceptibility gene cholesterol 25-hydroxylase (CH25H) is upregulated in the AD brain and is involved in the antiviral immune response. HSV-1 interacts with additional genes to affect cognition-related pathways and key enzymes involved in Aβ production, Aβ clearance, and hyperphosphorylation of tau proteins. Aβ itself functions as an antimicrobial peptide (AMP) against various pathogens including HSV-1. Evidence is presented supporting the hypothesis that Aβ is produced as an AMP in response to HSV-1 and other brain infections, leading to Aβ deposition and plaque formation in AD. Epidemiologic studies associating HSV-1 infection with AD and cognitive impairment are discussed. Studies are reviewed supporting subclinical chronic reactivation of latent HSV-1 in the brain as significant in the pathogenesis of AD. Finally, the rationale for and importance of clinical trials treating HSV-1-infected MCI and AD patients with antiviral medication is discussed.
We fed rats noodle (N) -diet containing 30 wt.% instant noodle with a 26% fat-to-energy ratio for 30 days (N-group). Compared with rats that were fed the same amount of nutrients (C-group), the N-group showed lower liver triacylglycerol levels and higher fecal cholesterol levels. We then analyzed transcriptome of the hypothalamic-pituitary (HP), the liver and the white adipose tissue (WAT). Thyroid stimulating hormone (Tshb), and its partner, glycoprotein hormone genes were up-regulated in the HP of N-group. Sterol regulatory element binding transcription factors were activated in the liver of N-group, while an up-regulation of the angiogenic signal occurred in the WAT of N-group. N-group showed higher urine noradrenaline (NA) level suggesting that these tissue signals are regulated by NA and Tshb. The N-diet contains 0.326 wt.% glutamate, 0.00236 wt.% 6-shogaol and Maillard reaction products. Our results suggest that these ingredients may affect lipid homeostasis via the HP axis.
Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress triggers or amplifies inflammatory signals and cytokine production in immune cells. Upon the resolution of ER stress, the inducible phosphatase 1 cofactor GADD34 promotes the dephosphorylation of the initiation factor eIF2α, thereby enabling protein translation to resume. Several aminoguanidine compounds, such as guanabenz, perturb the eIF2α phosphorylation-dephosphorylation cycle and protect different cell or tissue types from protein misfolding and degeneration. We investigated how pharmacological interference with the eIF2α pathway could be beneficial to treat autoinflammatory diseases dependent on proinflammatory cytokines and type I interferons (IFNs), the production of which is regulated by GADD34 in dendritic cells (DCs). In mouse and human DCs and B cells, guanabenz prevented the activation of Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) by CpG oligodeoxynucleotides or DNA-immunoglobulin complexes in endosomes. In vivo, guanabenz protected mice from CpG oligonucleotide-dependent cytokine shock and decreased autoimmune symptom severity in a chemically induced model of systemic lupus erythematosus. However, we found that guanabenz exerted its inhibitory effect independently of GADD34 activity on eIF2α and instead decreased the abundance of CH25H, a cholesterol hydroxylase linked to antiviral immunity. Our results therefore suggest that guanabenz and similar compounds could be used to treat type I IFN-dependent pathologies and that CH25H could be a therapeutic target to control these diseases.
Dihydroxycholesterols such as 7α,25-dihydroxysterols (7α,25-OHC) and 7α,27-OHC are generated from cholesterol by the enzymes CH25H, CYP7B1 and CYP27A1 in steady state but also in the context of inflammation. The G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) Epstein-Barr virus-induced gene 2 (EBI2), also known as GPR183, senses these oxysterols and induces chemotactic migration of immune cells towards higher concentrations of these ligands. We recently showed that these ligands are upregulated in the CNS in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an animal model for multiple sclerosis and that EBI2 enhanced early infiltration of encephalitogenic T cells into the CNS. In this short-review we discuss the role of dihydroxysterol-sensing by immune cells in neuroinflammation.
The development of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) pathogenesis remains unclear, but emerging evidence supports a crucial role for inducible bronchus-associated lymphoid tissue (iBALT) in disease progression. Mechanisms underlying iBALT generation, particularly during chronic CS exposure, remain to be defined. Oxysterol metabolism of cholesterol is crucial to immune cell localization in secondary lymphoid tissue. Here, we demonstrate that oxysterols also critically regulate iBALT generation and the immune pathogenesis of COPD In both COPD patients and cigarette smoke (CS)-exposed mice, we identified significantly upregulated CH25H and CYP7B1 expression in airway epithelial cells, regulating CS-induced B-cell migration and iBALT formation. Mice deficient in CH25H or the oxysterol receptor EBI2 exhibited decreased iBALT and subsequent CS-induced emphysema. Further, inhibition of the oxysterol pathway using clotrimazole resolved iBALT formation and attenuated CS-induced emphysema in vivo therapeutically. Collectively, our studies are the first to mechanistically interrogate oxysterol-dependent iBALT formation in the pathogenesis of COPD, and identify a novel therapeutic target for the treatment of COPD and potentially other diseases driven by the generation of tertiary lymphoid organs.
The behaviors of lymphocytes, including CD4+ T helper cells, are controlled on many levels by internal metabolic properties. Lipid metabolites have recently been ascribed a novel function as immune response modulators and perturbation of steroids pathways modulates inflammation and potentially promotes a variety of diseases. However, the impact of lipid metabolism on autoimmune disease development and lymphocyte biology is still largely unraveled. In this line, oxysterols, oxidized forms of cholesterol, have pleiotropic roles on the immune response aside from their involvements in lipid metabolism. The oxysterols 25-hydroxycholesterol (25-OHC) and 7α,25-dihydroxycholesterol (7α,25-OHC) regulate antiviral immunity and immune cell chemotaxis. However, their physiological effects on adaptive immune response in particular on various subset CD4+ T lymphocytes are largely unknown. Here, we assessed oxysterol levels in subset of CD4+ T cells and demonstrated that 25-OHC and transcript levels of its synthesizing enzyme, cholesterol 25-hydroxylase, were specifically increased in IL-27-induced type 1 regulatory T (TR1) cells. We further showed that 25-OHC acts as a negative regulator of TR1 cells in particular of IL-10 secretion via liver X receptor signaling. Not only do these findings unravel molecular mechanisms accounting for IL-27 signaling but also they highlight oxysterols as pro-inflammatory mediators that dampens regulatory T cell responses and thus unleash a pro-inflammatory response.
Oxysterols are a family of cholesterol oxygenated derivatives with diverse roles in many biological activities and have recently been linked with the induction of a cellular antiviral state. The antiviral effects of 25-hydroxycholesterol (25HC) extend to several mammalian enveloped and non-enveloped viruses. It has been reported that the expression of the gene encoding cholesterol 25-hydroxylase (CH25H) is induced by interferons (IFNs). In this work, five ch25h genes were identified in the zebrafish (Danio rerio) genome. The ch25h genes showed different tissue expression patterns and differed in their expression after immune stimulation with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (PolyI:C) and Spring Viremia Carp Virus (SVCV). Only one of the 5 genes, ch25hb, was overexpressed after the administration of the treatments. Synteny and phylogenetic analyses revealed that ch25hb is the putative homolog of mammalian Ch25h in zebrafish, while the remaining zebrafish ch25h genes are products of duplications within the teleost lineage. Interestingly, its modulation was not mediated by type I IFNs, contrasting previous reports on mammalian orthologs. Nevertheless, in vivo overexpression of ch25hb in zebrafish larvae significantly reduced mortality after SVCV challenge. Viral replication was also negatively affected by 25HC administration to the zebrafish cell line ZF4. In conclusion, the interferon-independent antiviral role of 25HC was extended to a non-mammalian species for the first time, and dual activity that both protects the cells and interacts with the virus cannot be discarded.
Cholesterol 25-hydroxylase (CH25H) has recently been identified as a host restriction factor that exerts antiviral effects by catalyzing the production of 25-hydroxycholesterol (25HC). CH25H can be rapidly induced upon infection with some viruses. Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), an arterivirus, has ranked among the most important swine pathogens since it was discovered in the late 1980s. In this study, we found that PRRSV infection significantly downregulated the expression of CH25H in cells by a so-far unknown mechanism, suggesting that CH25H exerts antiviral activity against PRRSV. Indeed, overexpression of CH25H inhibited PRRSV replication, whereas knockdown of CH25H by short interfering RNA (siRNA) promoted PRRSV infection. The anti-PRRSV effect of 25HC operates via inhibition of viral penetration. Interestingly, a CH25H mutant (CH25H-M) lacking hydroxylase activity still inhibited PRRSV infection. Screening using a yeast two-hybrid system followed by coimmunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence colocalization analyses confirmed that both CH25H and CH25H-M interact with the nonstructural protein 1 alpha (nsp1α) of PRRSV. Unexpectedly, the expression of nsp1α decreased following coexpression with CH25H or CH25H-M. Detailed analyses demonstrated that CH25H/CH25H-M could degrade nsp1α through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway and that site K169 in the nsp1α protein is the key site of ubiquitination. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that CH25H restricts PRRSV replication by targeting viral penetration as well as degrading nsp1α, revealing a novel antiviral mechanism used by CH25H.IMPORTANCE PRRSV has been a continuous threat to the global swine industry, and current vaccines are insufficient to provide sustainable control. CH25H has been found to exert a broad antiviral effect; thus, it is an attractive target for the development of anti-PRRSV drugs. Here, we demonstrate that CH25H is an interferon-stimulated gene that is highly expressed in porcine alveolar macrophages. CH25H exerts its anti-PRRSV effect not only via the production of 25HC to inhibit viral penetration but also by degrading viral protein through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, suggesting that CH25H is a candidate for the development of antiviral therapeutics. However, PRRSV infection appears to actively decrease CH25H expression to promote viral replication, highlighting the complex game between PRRSV and its host.
Atherosclerosis is a multifaceted inflammatory disease involving cells in the vascular wall (eg, endothelial cells [ECs]), as well as circulating and resident immunogenic cells (eg, monocytes/macrophages). Acting as a ligand for liver X receptor (LXR), but an inhibitor of SREBP2 (sterol regulatory element-binding protein 2), 25-hydroxycholesterol, and its catalyzing enzyme cholesterol-25-hydroxylase (Ch25h) are important in regulating cellular inflammatory status and cholesterol biosynthesis in both ECs and monocytes/macrophages.
Bioinformatic analyses were used to investigate RNA-sequencing data to identify cholesterol oxidation and efflux genes regulated by Krüppel-like factor 4 (KLF4). In vitro experiments involving cultured ECs and macrophages and in vivo methods involving mice with Ch25h ablation were then used to explore the atheroprotective role of KLF4-Ch25h/LXR.
Vasoprotective stimuli increased the expression of Ch25h and LXR via KLF4. The KLF4-Ch25h/LXR homeostatic axis functions through suppressing inflammation, evidenced by the reduction of inflammasome activity in ECs and the promotion of M1 to M2 phenotypic transition in macrophages. The increased atherosclerosis in apolipoprotein E-/-/Ch25h-/- mice further demonstrates the beneficial role of the KLF4-Ch25h/LXR axis in vascular function and disease.
KLF4 transactivates Ch25h and LXR, thereby promoting the synergistic effects between ECs and macrophages to protect against atherosclerosis susceptibility.
Stromal cells (SCs) establish the compartmentalization of lymphoid tissues critical to the immune response. However, the full diversity of lymph node (LN) SCs remains undefined. Using droplet-based single-cell RNA sequencing, we identified nine peripheral LN non-endothelial SC clusters. Included are the established subsets, Ccl19hi T-zone reticular cells (TRCs), marginal reticular cells, follicular dendritic cells (FDCs), and perivascular cells. We also identified Ccl19lo TRCs, likely including cholesterol-25-hydroxylase+ cells located at the T-zone perimeter, Cxcl9+ TRCs in the T-zone and interfollicular region, CD34+ SCs in the capsule and medullary vessel adventitia, indolethylamine N-methyltransferase+ SCs in the medullary cords, and Nr4a1+ SCs in several niches. These data help define how transcriptionally distinct LN SCs support niche-restricted immune functions and provide evidence that many SCs are in an activated state.
Most eukaryotic centromeres contain long arrays of tandem repeats, with unit lengths of 150-300 bp. We searched for such repeats in the functional centromeres of the model legume Medicago truncatula (Medicago) accession Jemalong A17. To this end three repeats, MtR1, MtR2 and MtR3, were identified in 20 Mb of a low-pass, whole genome sequencing data set generated by a random shotgun approach. The nucleotide sequence composition, genomic organization and abundance of these repeats were characterized. Fluorescent in situ hybridization of these repeats on chromosomes at meiosis I showed that only the MtR3 repeat, encompassing stretches of 450 kb to more than 1.0 Mb, is located in the functional portion of all eight centromeres. MtR1 and MtR2 occupy distinct regions in pericentromeric heterochromatin. We also studied the presence and distribution of MtRs in Medicago accession R108-1, a genotype with a genome that is 20% smaller than that of Jemalong A17. We determined that while MtR3 is also centromeric on all pachytene bivalents in R108-1, MtR1 and MtR2 are not present in the R108 genome.
An important control step in the regulation of cytoplasmic mRNA turnover is the removal of the m(7)G cap structure at the 5' end of the message. Here, we describe the functional characterization of Dhh1, a highly conserved member of the family of DEAD box-containing proteins, as a regulator of mRNA decapping in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Dhh1 is a cytoplasmic protein and is shown to be in a complex with the mRNA degradation factor Pat1/Mtr1 and with the 5'-3' exoribonuclease Xrn1. Dhh1 specifically affects mRNA turnover in the deadenylation-dependent decay pathway, but does not act on the degradation of nonsense-containing mRNAs. Cells that lack dhh1 accumulate degradation intermediates that have lost their poly(A) tail but contain an intact 5' cap structure, suggesting that Dhh1 is required for efficient decapping in vivo. Furthermore, recombinant Dhh1 is able to stimulate the activity of the purified decapping enzyme Dcp1 in an in vitro decapping assay. We propose that the DEAD box protein Dhh1 regulates the access of the decapping enzyme to the m(7)G cap by modulating the structure at the 5' end of mRNAs.
Mouse chromosome 7F4/F5 is a syntenic locus of human 11p15.5 in which many imprinted genes are clustered. Transmission of aberrant human 11p15.5 or duplicated 11p causes Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (BWS) depending on which parent the chromosome is derived from. To analyze a syntenic mouse locus corresponding to human 11p15.5, mouse BAC contigs were constructed between Nap2 and Tapa1, in which 390 kb was sequenced between Kvlqt1 and Tapa1. An unexpected finding was that of highly conserved intronic sequences of Kvlqt1 between mouse and human, and their homologies came up to at least 160 kb because the length of this gene extended to 350 kb, suggesting the possibility of some functional constraint due to transcriptional and/or post-transcriptional regulation of this region. Many expressed sequence tags (ESTs) were mapped on this locus. Three genes, Lit1 (Kvlqt1-AS), Mtr1 and Tssc4, were identified and characterized. Lit1 is an antisense-transcript of Kvlqt1 and paternally expressed and maternally methylated throughout the developmental stage. The position where Lit1 exists corresponded to a highly conserved region between mouse and human. This transcript extends at least 60 kb from downstream to upstream of exon 10 in Kvlqt1. Tssc4 and Mtr1 carried putative open reading frames but neither was imprinted. Further characterization of this locus based on the sequence comparison between mouse and human will contribute valuable information towards resolving the mechanism of the occurrence of BWS and the associated childhood tumor.
We recently described a novel putative Ca(2+) channel gene, MTR1, which shows a high level of homology to the human TRPC7 gene and the melastatin 1 (MLSN1) gene, another Trp (transient receptor potential protein)-related gene whose transcript was found to be downregulated in metastatic melanomas. It maps to human chromosome band 11p15.5, which is associated with the Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome and predisposition to a variety of neoplasias. Here we report the isolation and characterization of the murine orthologue Mtr1. The chromosomal localization on distal chromosome 7 places it in a cluster of imprinted genes, flanked by the previously described Tapa1 and Kcnq1 genes. The Mtr1 gene encodes a 4.4-kb transcript, present in a variety of fetal and adult tissues. The putative open reading frame consists of 24 exons, encoding 1158 amino acids. Transmembrane prediction algorithms indicate the presence of six membrane-spanning domains in the proposed protein. Imprinting analysis, using RT-PCR on RNA from reciprocal mouse crosses harboring a sequence polymorphism, revealed biallelic expression of Mtr1 transcripts at all stages and tissues examined.
A molecular cytogenetic map of Medicago truncatula (2n = 2x = 16) was constructed on the basis of a pachytene DAPI karyogram. Chromosomes at this meiotic prophase stage are 20 times longer than at mitotic metaphase, and display a well differentiated pattern of brightly fluorescing heterochromatin segments. We describe here a pachytene karyogram in which all chromosomes can be identified based on chromosome length, centromere position, heterochromatin patterns, and the positions of three repetitive sequences (5S rDNA, 45S rDNA and the MtR1 tandem repeat), visualized by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). We determined the correlation between genetic linkage groups and chromosomes by FISH mapping of bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clones, with two to five BACs per linkage group. In the cytogenetic map, chromosomes were numbered according to their corresponding linkage groups. We determined the relative positions of the 20 BACs and three repetitive sequences on the pachytene chromosomes, and compared the genetic and cytological distances between markers. The mapping resolution was determined in a euchromatic part of chromosome 5 by comparing the cytological distances between FISH signals of clones of a BAC contig with their corresponding physical distance, and showed that resolution in this region is about 60 kb. The establishment of this FISH pachytene karyotype, with a far better mapping resolution and detection sensitivity compared to those in the highly condensed mitotic metaphase complements, has created the basis for the integration of molecular, genetic and cytogenetic maps in M. truncatula.
The microtubule cytoskeleton plays important roles in cell polarity, motility and division. Microtubules inherently undergo dynamic instability, stochastically switching between phases of growth and shrinkage. In cells, some microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs) and molecular motors can further modulate microtubule dynamics. We present here the fission yeast mtr1(+), a new regulator of microtubule dynamics that appears to be not a MAP or a motor. mtr1-deletion (mtr1Δ) primarily results in longer microtubule dwell-time at the cell tip cortex, suggesting that mtr1p acts directly or indirectly as a destabilizer of microtubules. mtr1p is antagonistic to mal3p, the ortholog of mammalian EB1, which stabilizes microtubules. mal3Δ results in short microtubules, but can be partially rescued by mtr1Δ, as the double mutant mal3Δ mtr1Δ exhibits longer microtubules than mal3Δ single mutant. By sequence homology, mtr1p is predicted to be a component of the ribosomal quality control complex. Intriguingly, deletion of a predicted ribosomal gene, rps1801, also resulted in longer microtubule dwell-time similar to mtr1Δ. The double-mutant mal3Δ rps1801Δ also exhibits longer microtubules than mal3Δ single mutant alone. Our study suggests a possible involvement of mtr1p and the ribosome complex in modulating microtubule dynamics. 
In flowering plants, formation of the haploid male gametophytes in anthers requires the interaction between reproductive cells and the neighboring somatic cells, yet the underlying mechanism remains poorly understood. Here, we reveal the crucial role of a fasciclin glycoprotein, MICROSPORE AND TAPETUM REGULATOR1 (MTR1), in controlling the development of sporophytic and reproductive cells in rice (Oryza sativa). MTR1 is specifically expressed in the male reproductive cells, yet its mutant exhibits defects in both tapetum and microspore development, causing complete male sterility. We also demonstrate that the fasciclin domains, N-glycolation, and N-terminal signal peptide-mediated plasma membrane localization of MTR1 are required for normal anther development and pollen fertility. Our findings show that rice male reproductive cells secrete the MTR1 protein to control the development of reproductive cells and their adjacent somatic cells, thus providing novel insights into the mechanism of plant male reproductive development.
Two distinct biosynthetic pathways for Phe in plants have been proposed: conversion of prephenate to Phe via phenylpyruvate or arogenate. The reactions catalyzed by prephenate dehydratase (PDT) and arogenate dehydratase (ADT) contribute to these respective pathways. The Mtr1 mutant of rice (Oryza sativa) manifests accumulation of Phe, Trp, and several phenylpropanoids, suggesting a link between the synthesis of Phe and Trp. Here, we show that the Mtr1 mutant gene (mtr1-D) encodes a form of rice PDT with a point mutation in the putative allosteric regulatory region of the protein. Transformed callus lines expressing mtr1-D exhibited all the characteristics of Mtr1 callus tissue. Biochemical analysis revealed that rice PDT possesses both PDT and ADT activities, with a preference for arogenate as substrate, suggesting that it functions primarily as an ADT. The wild-type enzyme is feedback regulated by Phe, whereas the mutant enzyme showed a reduced feedback sensitivity, resulting in Phe accumulation. In addition, these observations indicate that rice PDT is critical for regulating the size of the Phe pool in plant cells. Feeding external Phe to wild-type callus tissue and seedlings resulted in Trp accumulation, demonstrating a connection between Phe accumulation and Trp pool size.
We tested the hypothesis that melatonin prevents brain death (BD) tissue extract (BDEX)-induced cardiac damage by suppressing inflammatory damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP) signaling in rats. Six hours after BD induction, levels of a DAMP component (HMGB1) and inflammatory markers (TLR-2, TLR-4, MYD88, IκB, NF-κB, IL-1β, IFN-γ, TNF-α and IL-6) were higher in brain tissue from BD animals than controls. Levels of HMGB1 and inflammatory markers were higher in BDEX-treated H9C2 cardiac myoblasts than in cells treated with healthy brain tissue extract. These increases were attenuated by melatonin but re-induced with luzindole (all P &lt; 0.001). Additional male rats (n = 30) were divided into groups 1 (negative control), 2 (healthy brain tissue extract implanted in the left ventricular myocardium [LVM]), 3 (BDEX-LVM), 4 (BDEX-LVM + melatonin), and 5 (BDEX-LVM + melatonin + luzindole). Collagen deposition/fibrosis and LVM levels of MTR2, HMGB1, inflammatory markers, oxidative stress, apoptosis, mitochondrial damage and DNA damage were highest in group 3, lowest in groups 1 and 2, and higher in group 5 than in group 4. Heart function and LVM levels of MTR1 and anti-inflammatory, mitochondrial-integrity and anti-oxidative markers exhibited a pattern opposite that of the inflammatory markers in the five groups (all P &lt; 0.0001). These results indicate melatonin inhibits BDEX-induced cardiac damage by suppressing the DAMP inflammatory axis.
The cytosolic helicase retinoic acid-inducible gene-I (RIG-I) initiates immune responses to most RNA viruses by detecting viral 5'-triphosphorylated RNA (pppRNA). Although endogenous mRNA is also 5'-triphosphorylated, backbone modifications and the 5'-ppp-linked methylguanosine ((m7)G) cap prevent immunorecognition. Here we show that the methylation status of endogenous capped mRNA at the 5'-terminal nucleotide (N1) was crucial to prevent RIG-I activation. Moreover, we identified a single conserved amino acid (H830) in the RIG-I RNA binding pocket as the mediator of steric exclusion of N1-2'O-methylated RNA. H830A alteration (RIG-I(H830A)) restored binding of N1-2'O-methylated pppRNA. Consequently, endogenous mRNA activated the RIG-I(H830A) mutant but not wild-type RIG-I. Similarly, knockdown of the endogenous N1-2'O-methyltransferase led to considerable RIG-I stimulation in the absence of exogenous stimuli. Studies involving yellow-fever-virus-encoded 2'O-methyltransferase and RIG-I(H830A) revealed that viruses exploit this mechanism to escape RIG-I. Our data reveal a new role for cap N1-2'O-methylation in RIG-I tolerance of self-RNA. 
The stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHRSP) showed an exaggerated response to a high-fat, high-cholesterol (HFC) diet, and the resulting reactive hypercholesterolemia was suggested to exacerbate the atherogenic process in this rat. We thus performed a quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis on the serum cholesterol level of SHRSP before and after the HFC diet, with the final goal being the identification of the genetic mechanisms of its reactive hypercholesterolemia. Three hundred fifty-eight F2 rats between SHRSP and Wistar-Kyoto rat were employed in the study. The serum cholesterol and apoprotein E were measured before and after 2 wk of feeding with the HFC diet. Multiple QTLs for the basal cholesterol level were identified on chromosomes 1 and 5, whereas those for the postdietary cholesterol level were on chromosomes 7, 15, and 16. The cholesterol QTLs before and after HFC diet did not overlap with one another, implying that the involved metabolic processes were considerably different between the two conditions. Supporting this, VLDL and LDL cholesterol were the major components of the postdietary serum cholesterol, whereas the basal cholesterol level consisted mainly of HDL cholesterol. A substantial difference of the QTLs between males and females was observed, especially after the HFC diet. The QTL on chromosome 15 had an inverse effect on the cholesterol level, suggesting that the congenic substitution of the SHRSP fragment with that of Wistar-Kyoto rats could induce a greater cholesterol level in SHRSP. This observation is significant in establishing a new model for atherosclerosis with hypertension in rats.
Atherosclerosis is a complex disease resulting from the interaction of multiple genes, including those causing dyslipidemia. Relatively few of the causative genes have been identified. Previously, we identified Apoa2 as a major determinant of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels in the mouse model. To identify additional HDL-C level quantitative trait loci (QTLs), while controlling for the effect of the Apoa2 locus, we performed linkage analysis in 179 standard diet-fed F(2) mice derived from strains BALB/cJ and B6.C-H25(c) (a congenic strain carrying the BALB/c Apoa2 allele). Three significant QTLs and one suggestive locus were identified. A female-specific locus mapping to chromosome 6 (Chr 6) also exhibited effects on plasma non-HDL-C, apolipoprotein AII (apoAII), apoB, and apoE levels. A Chr 6 QTL was independently isolated in a related congenic strain (C57BL/6J vs. B6.NODc6: P = 0.003 and P = 0.0001 for HDL-C and non-HDL-C levels, respectively). These data are consistent with polygenic inheritance of HDL-C levels in the mouse model and provide candidate loci for HDL-C and non-HDL-C level determination in humans.
High-density lipoproteins (HDLs) are anti-atherogenic lipoproteins that have a major role in transporting cholesterol from peripheral tissues to the liver, where it is removed. Epidemiologic studies have shown that low levels of high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C) are associated with an increased incidence of coronary heart disease and an increased mortality rate, indicating a protective role of high concentrations of HDL-C against atherogenesis and the development of coronary heart disease. HDL-C level is influenced by several genetic and nongenetic factors. Nongenetic factors include smoking, which has been shown to decrease the HDL-C level. Exercise and alcohol have been shown to increase HDL-C levels. Decreased HDL-C is often associated with other coronary heart disease risk factors such as obesity, hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance, hypertriglyceridemia and hypertension. Although several genes have been identified for rare forms of dyslipidemia, the genes accounting for major variation in HDL-C levels have yet to be identified. Using a multipoint variance components linkage approach, we found strong evidence of linkage (lod score=3.4; P=0.00004) of a quantitative trait locus (QTL) for HDL-C level to a genetic location between markers D9S925 and D9S741 on chromosome 9p in Mexican Americans. A replication study in an independent set of Mexican American families confirmed the existence of a QTL on chromosome 9p.
The amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) technique is a DNA technology that generates the so-called AFLP markers. These markers are genomic restriction fragments detected after two rounds of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) without prior knowledge of nucleotide sequence. Here we describe the first application of the AFLP technique in the rabbit. We have tested two primer combinations. The results obtained with the DNA from rabbits of different breeds justify the conclusion that AFLP analysis is an effective tool for genetic studies in the rabbit. In addition, we contribute to the linkage map of the rabbit by localizing two AFLP markers on rabbit linkage group VI (LG VI). For this purpose the progeny of a IIIVO/JU x [IIIVO/JU x AX/JU]F(1) backcross were genotyped for 12 AFLP markers and 3 LG VI classical markers [one coat color marker (e) and two biochemical markers (Es-1 and Est-2)]. AX/JU is a dietary cholesterol-susceptible (hyperresponding) inbred strain and IIIVO/JU is a dietary cholesterol resistant (hyporesponding) inbred strain. Moreover, it is possible to evoke dietary cholesterol-induced aorta atherosclerosis in a relatively short time period in AX/JU rabbits, in contrast to IIIVO/JU rabbits. A significant cosegregation was found between basal serum HDL cholesterol level (i.e., the level on a low-cholesterol, control diet) and an AFLP marker on LG VI. It is concluded that one or more genes of LG VI are regulating the basal serum HDL cholesterol level in rabbits. Thus the present study with rabbits clearly illustrates the value of AFLP markers for the construction of linkage maps and mapping of quantitative trait loci (QTL).
Serum lipids are associated with many serious cardiovascular diseases and obesity problems. Many quantitative trait loci (QTL) have been reported in the pig mostly for performance traits but very few for the serum lipid traits. In contrast, remarkable numbers of QTL are mapped for serum lipids in humans and mice. Therefore, the objective of this research was to investigate the chromosomal regions influencing the serum level of the total cholesterol (CT), triglyceride (TG), high density protein cholesterol (HDL) and low density protein cholesterol (LDL) in pigs. For this purpose, a total of 330 animals from a Duroc × Pietrain F2 resource population were phenotyped for serum lipids using ELISA and were genotyped by using 122 microsatellite markers covering all porcine autosomes for QTL study in QTL Express. Blood sampling was performed at approximately 175 days before slaughter of the pig.
Most of the traits were correlated with each other and were influenced by average daily gain, slaughter date and age. A total of 18 QTL including three QTL with imprinting effect were identified on 11 different porcine autosomes. Most of the QTL reached to 5% chromosome-wide (CW) level significance including a QTL at 5% experiment-wide (GW) and a QTL at 1% GW level significance. Of these QTL four were identified for both the CT and LDL and two QTL were identified for both the TG and LDL. Moreover, three chromosomal regions were detected for the HDL/LDL ratio in this study. One QTL for HDL on SSC2 and two QTL for TG on SSC11 and 17 were detected with imprinting effect. The highly significant QTL (1% GW) was detected for LDL at 82 cM on SSC1, whereas significant QTL (5% GW) was identified for HDL/LDL on SSC1 at 87 cM. Chromosomal regions with pleiotropic effects were detected for correlated traits on SSC1, 7 and 12. Most of the QTL identified for serum lipid traits correspond with the previously reported QTL for similar traits in other mammals. Two novel QTL on SSC16 for HDL and HDL/LDL ratio and an imprinted QTL on SSS17 for TG were detected in the pig for the first time.
The newly identified QTL are potentially involved in lipid metabolism. The results of this work shed new light on the genetic background of serum lipid concentrations and these findings will be helpful to identify candidate genes in these QTL regions related to lipid metabolism and serum lipid concentrations in pigs.
Plasma HDL cholesterol levels (HDL-C) are an independent predictor of coronary artery disease (CAD). We have completed a genome-wide linkage scan for HDL-C in a US cohort consisting of 388 multiplex families with premature CAD (GeneQuest). The heritability of HDL-C in GeneQuest was 0.37 with gender and age as covariates (P = 5.1 x 10(-4)). Two major quantitative trait loci (QTL) for log-transformed HDL-C adjusted for age and gender were identified onto chromosomes 7p22 and 15q25 with maximum multipoint logarithm of odds (LOD) scores of 3.76 and 6.69, respectively. Fine mapping decreased the 7p22 LOD score to a nonsignificant level of 3.09 and split the 15q25 QTL into two loci, one minor QTL on 15q22 (LOD = 2.73) that spanned the LIPC gene, and the other at 15q25 (LOD = 5.63). A family-based quantitative transmission disequilibrium test (QTDT) revealed significant association between variant rs1800588 in LIPC and HDL-C in the GeneQuest population (P = 0.0067), which may account for the minor QTL on 15q22. The 15q25 QTL is the most significant locus identified for HDL-C to date, and these results provide a framework for the ultimate identification of the underlying HDL-C variant and gene on chromosomes 15q25, which will provide insights into novel regulatory mechanisms of HDL-C metabolism.
A higher incidence of coronary artery disease is associated with a lower level of HDL-cholesterol. We searched for genetic loci influencing HDL-cholesterol in F2 mice from a cross between MRL/MpJ and SM/J mice. Quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping revealed one significant HDL QTL (Apoa2 locus), four suggestive QTL on chromosomes 10, 11, 13, and 18 and four additional QTL on chromosomes 1 proximal, 3, 4, and 7 after adjusting HDL for the strong Apoa2 locus. A novel nonsynonymous polymorphism supports Lipg as the QTL gene for the chromosome 18 QTL, and a difference in Abca1 expression in liver tissue supports it as the QTL gene for the chromosome 4 QTL. Using weighted gene co-expression network analysis, we identified a module that after adjustment for Apoa2, correlated with HDL, was genetically determined by a QTL on chromosome 11, and overlapped with the HDL QTL. A combination of bioinformatics tools and systems genetics helped identify several candidate genes for both the chromosome 11 HDL and module QTL based on differential expression between the parental strains, cis regulation of expression, and causality modeling. We conclude that integrating systems genetics to a more-traditional genetics approach improves the power of complex trait gene identification.
A combined quantitative trait loci (QTL) and microarray-based approach is commonly used to find differentially expressed genes which are then identified based on the known function of a gene in the biological process governing the trait of interest. However, a low cutoff value in individual gene analyses may result in many genes with moderate but meaningful changes in expression being missed.
We modified a gene set analysis to identify intersection sets with significantly affected expression for which the changes in the individual gene sets are less significant. The gene expression profiles in liver tissues of four strains of mice from publicly available microarray sources were analyzed to detect trait-associated pathways using information on the QTL regions of blood concentrations of high density lipoproteins (HDL) cholesterol and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1). Several metabolic pathways related to HDL levels, including lipid metabolism, ABC transporters and cytochrome P450 pathways were detected for HDL QTL regions. Most of the pathways identified for the IGF-1 phenotype were signal transduction pathways associated with biological processes for IGF-1's regulation.
We have developed a method of identifying pathways associated with a quantitative trait using information on QTL. Our approach provides insights into genotype-phenotype relations at the level of biological pathways which may help to elucidate the genetic architecture underlying variation in phenotypic traits.
Shiitake (Lentinula edodes) extract, eritadenine, has been shown to reduce cholesterol levels, and its hypocholesterolemic actions are involved in the metabolism of methionine. However, the mechanisms by which eritadenine affects cholesterol metabolism in animals fed a high-fat diet containing different sources of lipids have not yet been elucidated in detail. This study was conducted to investigate the effects of shiitake supplementation on serum lipid concentrations in rats fed a diet including a high amount of a plant oil (HO [high oil] and HOS [high oil with shiitake] groups), animal fat (HF [high fat] and HFS [high fat with shiitake] groups), or MCT- (medium-chain triglyceride-) rich plant oil (HM [high MCT] and HMS [high MCT with shiitake] groups). Rats in the HOS, HFS, and HMS groups were fed shiitake. When rats were fed a diet containing shiitake, serum triglyceride, cholesterol levels, and LCAT (lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase) activities were lower in rats given MCT-rich plant oil than in those that consumed lard. The lipid type in the diet with shiitake also affected serum cholesterol levels and LCAT activities. The diet containing MCT-rich plant oil showed the greatest rates of decrease in all serum lipid profiles and LCAT activities. These results suggest that shiitake and MCT-rich plant oil work together to reduce lipid profiles and LCAT activity in serum.
The mammalian adipose tissue plays a central role in energy-balance control, whereas the avian visceral fat hardly expresses leptin, the key adipokine in mammals. Therefore, to assess the endocrine role of adipose tissue in birds, we compared the transcriptome and proteome between two metabolically different types of chickens, broilers and layers, bred towards efficient meat and egg production, respectively.
Broilers and layer hens, grown up to sexual maturation under free-feeding conditions, differed 4.0-fold in weight and 1.6-fold in ovarian-follicle counts, yet the relative accumulation of visceral fat was comparable. RNA-seq and mass-spectrometry (MS) analyses of visceral fat revealed differentially expressed genes between broilers and layers, 1106 at the mRNA level (FDR ≤ 0.05), and 203 at the protein level (P ≤ 0.05). In broilers, Ingenuity Pathway Analysis revealed activation of the PTEN-pathway, and in layers increased response to external signals. The expression pattern of genes encoding fat-secreted proteins in broilers and layers was characterized in the RNA-seq and MS data, as well as by qPCR on visceral fat under free feeding and 24 h-feed deprivation. This characterization was expanded using available RNA-seq data of tissues from red junglefowl, and of visceral fat from broilers of different types. These comparisons revealed expression of new adipokines and secreted proteins (LCAT, LECT2, SERPINE2, SFTP1, ZP1, ZP3, APOV1, VTG1 and VTG2) at the mRNA and/or protein levels, with dynamic gene expression patterns in the selected chicken lines (except for ZP1; FDR/P ≤ 0.05) and feed deprivation (NAMPT, SFTPA1 and ZP3) (P ≤ 0.05). In contrast, some of the most prominent adipokines in mammals, leptin, TNF, IFNG, and IL6 were expressed at a low level (FPKM/RPKM&lt; 1) and did not show differential mRNA expression neither between broiler and layer lines nor between fed vs. feed-deprived chickens.
Our study revealed that RNA and protein expression in visceral fat changes with selective breeding, suggesting endocrine roles of visceral fat in the selected phenotypes. In comparison to gene expression in visceral fat of mammals, our findings points to a more direct cross talk of the chicken visceral fat with the reproductive system and lower involvement in the regulation of appetite, inflammation and insulin resistance.
Global rating of change (GROC) scores provide a means of measuring patients' self-perceived change in health status over time.
The purposes of the study were to examine agreement of GROC ratings between the patient (GROCp) and the treating therapist (GROCt), the impact on the minimal clinically important difference (MCID) estimates by reporting resources, and the relationships between the subjective GROC scores and objective outcome measures.
Data from 52,767 patients with orthopedic lumbar spine impairments treated in 623 outpatient rehabilitation clinics in 34 states (United States) were analyzed. Patient's functional status (FS) before and after the treatment was measured using the Lumbar Computerized Adaptive Testing (LCAT) survey (0-100 scale). The GROC ratings were obtained from both the patients and their caring therapists at discharge.
On average, GROCp (mean [(SD] = 3.1 [4.1]) was 1.9 points lower than GROCt (mean [SD] = 5.0 [1.9]). There were negligible differences between MCID estimates derived from the patients' GROC ratings (MCID cutoff = 9.2) and from the therapists' GROC ratings (MCID cutoff = 9.5). While only analyzing patient data whose GROCp ≥ 0, the intraclass correlation coefficient between GROCp and GROCt was 0.61, the GROCp correlated with FS at intake at r = 0.12, with FS at discharge at r = 0.56, and with FS change scores at r = 0.47.
Therapists tended to report higher GROC ratings than their patients did but there were negligible differences between MCID estimates derived from GROCp and that derived from GROCt.
Plant-based natural extracts cure several diseases in human. However, the extract of Psidium guajava leaf is not yet evaluated on changes of lipid profile in hepatic disease affected rats.
The present study was aimed to evaluate the mitigation effect of the ethanolic extract of P. guajava leaf and its isolated quercetin fraction on hepatotoxic rats.
Carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) was injected to rats for hepatic disease induction and silymarin drug was used as positive control to compare plant ethanolic extract. The lipid profiles were assessed in both plasma and liver tissue of diseased and control rats.
Levels of total cholesterol, triglycerides, free fatty acids, phospholipids, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol were increased and the level of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) was decreased in CCl4-induced hepatotoxic rats. The treatment of P. guajava (100, 200, and 300 mg/kg, bw) and isolated quercetin fraction (20 mg/kg, bw) doses decreased the elevated levels of all these parameters in diseased rats and restored the normal concentration of HDL-C.
The results of the present study concluded that the P. guajava leaf and its isolated quercetin fraction can significantly regulate lipid metabolism in CCl4-induced hepatotoxic rats and decrease the disease rate.

The primary objective of this study was to assess the causality of ADRs using World Health Organization-Uppsala Monitoring Centre (WHO-UMC), Naranjo and Liverpool ADR Causality Assessment Tool (LCAT). Other primary objective was to assess the agreement between the WHO-UMC criterion, Naranjo algorithm and LCAT. The secondary objective was to assess the reported adverse drug reactions in a tertiary care hospital in South India.
This was a cross-sectional retrospective study. All the ADRs which were reported by the Pharmacovigilance Unit between July 2016 and March 2017 were assessed. Causality assessment was performed by two well-trained independent pharmacologists by applying the three methods-WHO, Naranjo and LCAT. Concurrence between the two algorithms was compared using the Cohen's weighted kappa statistic.
Causality assessment of adverse reactions according to Naranjo criteria shows that 81% cases were of probable type, 9.5% cases were possible and 9.5% cases were unlikely. Causality assessment of adverse reactions according to WHO-UMC criteria shows that 85.7% cases were of probable type, 4.8% cases were possible, 4.8% cases were unlikely and 4.8% cases were definite. Causality assessment of adverse reactions according to Liverpool criteria shows that 61.9% cases were of probable type, 4.8% cases were possible and 33.3% cases were definite. Cohen's kappa test shows that negative and poor concurrence was seen between WHO and Naranjo causality comparison (κ = -0.161). Positive but poor concurrence based on kappa values was seen between Liverpool and Naranjo's causality comparison (κ = 0.133). Negative and poor concurrence based on kappa values was seen between WHO and Liverpool causality comparison (κ = -0.161).
The most frequent causality category observed by the WHO-UMC criteria, Naranjo as well as the Liverpool algorithm was "Probable." Full concurrence was not found between any of two scales of causality assessment.
Gene-gene and gene-environment interactions may be partially responsible for dyslipidemia, but studies investigating interactions in the reverse cholesterol transport system (RCT) are limited. We explored these interactions in a Xinjiang rural population by genotyping five SNPs using SNPShot technique in APOA1, ABCA1, and LCAT, which are involved in the RCT (690 patients, 743 controls). We conducted unconditional logistical regression analysis to evaluate associations and generalized multifactor dimensionality reduction to evaluate interactions. Results revealed significant differences in rs670 and rs2292318 allele frequencies between cases and controls (P&lt;0.025). rs670 G allele carriers were more likely to develop dyslipidemia than A allele carriers (OR = 1.315, OR 95% CI: 1.067-2.620; P = 0.010). rs2292318 T allele carriers were more likely to develop dyslipidemia than A allele carriers (OR = 1.264, OR 95% CI: 1.037-1.541; P = 0.020). Gene-gene interaction model APOA1rs670-ABCA1rs1800976-ABCA1rs4149313-LCATrs1109166 (P = 0.0107) and gene-environment interaction model ABCA1rs1800976-ABCA1rs4149313-LCATrs1109166-obesity-smoking were optimal dyslipidemia predictors (P = 0.0107) and can interact (4). Differences in A-C-A-C-A and G-G-G-T-G haplotype frequencies were observed (P&lt;0.05). Serum lipid profiles could be partly attributed to RCT gene polymorphisms. Thus, dyslipidemia is influenced by APOA1, ABCA1, LCAT, environmental factors, and their interactions.
The effects of sardine by-products (SBy-P) and fillet proteins (SF-P) were compared to casein (Cas) ; these effects were assessed on blood pressure, glycemic control, reverse cholesterol transport, lipid peroxidation and total antioxidant capacity in obese rats.
Eighteen male Wistar rats were subjected for three months, to a high-fat diet. The obese rats were divided into three groups and consumed the same high-fat diet for 28 days after addition of either, 20% SBy-P, SF-P or Cas.
The sardine proteins (SBy-P and SF-P) compared respectively to Cas, reduced diastolic (-14%, -11% P&lt;0.05) and systolic pressures (-12%, -8% P&lt;0.05), blood glucose (-24%, -21% P&lt;0.05), glycated hemoglobin (-28%, -21% P&lt;0.05), insulinemia (-29%, -18% P&lt;0.05) and HOMA-IR index (-29%, -18% P&lt;0.05). They improve the reverse cholesterol transport by increasing the lecithin: cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) activity (+43%, +30% P&lt;0.05) and high-density lipoproteins in cholesterol esters (+108%, +88% P&lt;0.05), and decreasing the atherogenicity ratios and membrane fluidity (P&lt;0.05). Furthermore, SBy-P and SF-P induced a reduction of reactive thiobarbituric acid substances concentrations in heart (-45%, -25% P&lt;0.05), aorta (-62%, -41% P&lt;0.05), liver (-40%, -21% P&lt;0.05) and adipose tissue (-50%, -37% P&lt;0.05) with an improvement in antioxidant capacity.
Sardine proteins, in particular those extracted from by-products, because of their hypotensive, hypoglycemic, anti-atherogenic and antioxidant properties, may have protective effects against the cardiovascular risk associated with obesity.

                        Background
                     -Lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) is the sole enzyme that esterifies cholesterol in plasma. Its role in the supposed protection from atherogenesis remains unclear since mutations in LCAT causing Fish-Eye Disease (FED) or Familial LCAT Deficiency (FLD) have been reported to be associated with more or instead less carotid atherosclerosis, respectively. This discrepancy may be associated with the loss of cholesterol esterification on only apolipoprotein (apo) A-I (FED) or on both apoA-I and apoB-containing lipoproteins (FLD), an aspect that has thus far not been investigated. 
                        Methods
                     -Seventy-four heterozygotes for LCAT mutations recruited from Italy and the Netherlands were assigned to FLD (n=33) or FED (n=41) groups and compared to 280 controls. Subclinical atherosclerosis was assessed using carotid intima-media thickness (IMT). 
                        Results
                     -Compared to controls, total cholesterol was lower by 16% (-32.9 mg/dL) and 7% (-14.9 mg/dL), and HDL cholesterol was lower by 29% (-16.7 mg/dL) and 36% (-20.7 mg/dL) in the FLD and FED groups, respectively. FLD subjects displayed a significant 18% lower LDL cholesterol compared with FED (101.9±35.0 vs 123.6±47.4 mg/dL, P=0.047) and controls (122.6±35.0 mg/dL, P=0.003). Remarkably, all three IMT parameters were lower in FLD compared to FED and controls (accounting for age, sex, BMI, smoking, hypertension, family history of cardiovascular disease and plasma lipids). After additional correction for nationality and ultrasonographic methods, average and maximum IMT remained significantly lower when comparing FLD to FED (0.59mm vs 0.73mm, P=0.003, and 0.87mm vs 1.24mm, P&lt;0.001, respectively). By contrast, the common carotid IMT (corrected for age, sex, BMI, smoking, hypertension, family history of cardiovascular disease, and plasma lipids) was higher in FED compared to controls (0.69mm versus 0.65mm, P=0.05), but this significance was lost after adjustment for nationality and ultrasonographic machine. 
                        Conclusions
                     -In this head-to-head comparison, FLD and FED mutations were shown to be associated with decreased and increased atherosclerosis, respectively. We propose that this discrepancy is related to the capacity of LCAT to generate cholesterol esters on apoB-containing lipoproteins. While this capacity is lost in FLD, it is unaffected in FED. These results are important when considering LCAT as a target to decrease atherosclerosis.
To highlight the benefits of green alga Ulva lactuca polysaccharides supplementation on blood pressure and atherogenic risk factors in rats fed a high fat diet.
Wistar male rats were fed a high fat diet (30% sheep fat) for 3 months. At an average body weight (BW) of 360g, the rats (n=18) were divided into 3 groups and consumed, for 28 days, either a high fat diet (HFD) or a high fat diet enriched with 1% of whole green algae (WGA) powder or with 1% of its polysaccharides (PLS).
In HFD, WGA and PLS supplementation reduced BW and food intake. WGA and PLS compared to HFD reduced systolic (PAS) (-17% and -19%) and diastolic (PAD) blood pressure (-38% and -39%), serum glucose (-37% and -30%, respectively), insulinemia (-55% and -74%, respectively), serum and hepatic total lipids, triglycerides, total cholesterol levels, as well as the total cholesterol concentration of low and very low density lipoproteins. The same, atherogenicity ratios and membrane fluidity decreased in the WGA and PLS vs HFD while lecithin: cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) activity increased (51 and 41% respectively).
Ulva lactuca and its polysaccharides, one of the bioactive compounds of this macroalga, seem to have hypotensive, hypoglycemic, hypolipaemic and antiatherogenic properties that can correct or prevent certain cardiovascular complications linked to a high fat diet.
APOA1 is the most abundant protein in HDL. It modulates interactions that affect HDLs cardioprotective functions, in part via its activation of the enzyme LCAT. On nascent, discoidal HDL, APOA1 comprises 10 alpha-helical repeats arranged in an anti-parallel, stacked-ring structure that encapsulates a lipid bilayer. Previous chemical cross-linking studies suggested that these APOA1 rings can adopt at least two different orientations, or registries, with respect to each other; however, the functional impact of these structural changes is unknown. Here, we placed Cys-residues at locations predicted to form disulfide bonds in each orientation and then measured APOA1s ability to adopt the two registries during HDL particle formation. We found that most APOA1 oriented with the fifth helix of one molecule across from fifth helix of the other (5/5 helical registry), but a fraction adopted a 5/2 registry. Engineered HDL that were locked in 5/5 or 5/2 registries by disulfide bonds equally promoted cholesterol efflux from macrophages - indicating functional particles. However, unlike the 5/5 registry or the wild-type, the 5/2 registry impaired LCAT cholesteryl esterification activity (p&lt;0.001), despite LCAT binding equally to all particles. Chemical cross-linking studies suggest that full LCAT activity requires a hybrid epitope composed of helices 5-7 on one APOA1 molecule and 3-4 on the other. Thus, APOA1 may use a reciprocating, thumbwheel-like mechanism to activate HDL-remodeling proteins.
Human plasma high-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations are a negative risk factor for atherosclerosis-linked cardiovascular disease. Pharmacological attempts to reduce atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease by increasing plasma high-density lipoprotein cholesterol have been disappointing so that recent research has shifted from HDL quantity to HDL quality, that is, functional vs dysfunctional HDL. HDL has varying degrees of dysfunction reflected in impaired reverse cholesterol transport (RCT). In the context of atheroprotection, RCT occurs by 2 mechanisms: one is the well-known trans-hepatic pathway comprising macrophage free cholesterol (FC) efflux, which produces early forms of FC-rich nascent HDL (nHDL). Lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase converts HDL-FC to HDL-cholesteryl ester while converting nHDL from a disc to a mature spherical HDL, which transfers its cholesteryl ester to the hepatic HDL receptor, scavenger receptor B1 for uptake, conversion to bile salts, or transfer to the intestine for excretion. Although widely cited, current evidence suggests that this is a minor pathway and that most HDL-FC and nHDL-FC rapidly transfer directly to the liver independent of lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase activity. A small fraction of plasma HDL-FC enters the trans-intestinal efflux pathway comprising direct FC transfer to the intestine. SR-B1-/- mice, which have impaired trans-hepatic FC transport, are characterized by high plasma levels of a dysfunctional FC-rich HDL that increases plasma FC bioavailability in a way that produces whole-body hypercholesterolemia and multiple pathologies. The design of future therapeutic strategies to improve RCT will have to be formulated in the context of these dual RCT mechanisms and the role of FC bioavailability.
We report the case of a 39-year-old West African man in whom high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) was identified as undetectable at &lt;0.08 mmol/L. Total cholesterol in the same sample was 2.85 mmol/L; triglycerides were only mildly elevated at 2.32 mmol/L. He was admitted with a 2-week history of polydipsia, polyuria, weight loss and hyperpyrexia. Dual malarial infection with Plasmodium ovale and falciparum was identified and attributed to a recent trip to Nigeria without chemoprophylaxis. Also, he was diagnosed with diabetes mellitus with random hyperglycemia of 39 mmol/L but no ketonemia. Subsequent investigation revealed a low apolipoprotein A1 of 0.38 g/L (1.04-2.02), confirming a true HDL-C deficit. On clinical examination, he had neither orange tonsils consistent with Tangier disease nor corneal opacification consistent with lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase deficiency. The patient was an avid gym goer but denied anabolic steroid abuse, a fact supported by a transient primary testosterone deficiency at presentation (testosterone 6.56 nmol/L, RR 8.6-29; follicle-stimulating hormone high at 9.2 mU/L, luteinising hormone high at 11.9 mU/L). He was treated for malaria and started on metformin for diabetes. At 8-week follow-up, his HDL-C was entirely normal at 1.38 mmol/L. We believe this severe drop in HDL-C level to be due to acute inflammation caused by malaria. As extreme drops in HDL-C have been found to be associated with the poorest prognosis, prospective identification of HDL-C and prompt clinical liaison may be of benefit.
We describe a case of fish-eye disease (FED) where the clinical features and visual function were investigated using anterior segment optical coherence tomography (OCT) and quantitative measurements.
A 36-year-old Japanese woman with FED presented with bilateral corneal opacities and visual complaints. Both contrast sensitivity and straylight were measured and OCT imaging was performed. Contrast sensitivity and straylight measurements revealed remarkably decreased visual function, despite good visual acuity. OCT demonstrated homogenously hyper-reflective corneal opacification, and a normal total corneal thickness.
The findings from this case suggest that OCT is useful for analyzing the clinical features of FED, and that the quantitative measurement of visual function furthers the understanding of vision-related symptoms in FED, despite good visual acuity.
Atherosclerosis is a systemic disease characterized by the deposition of cholesterol and inflammatory cells within the arterial wall. Removal of cholesterol from the vessel wall may have an impact on the size and composition of atherosclerotic lesions. Anionic phospholipids or liposome vesicles composed of a lipid bilayer such as nanoliposomes have been suggested as treatments for dyslipidemia. In this study, we investigated the effect of anionic nanoliposomes on atherosclerosis in a mouse model. Low-density lipoprotein receptor knockout mice (Ldlr-/- ) were fed with an atherosclerosis promoting high fat and cholesterol (HFC) diet for 12 weeks. Anionic nanoliposomes including hydrogenated soy phosphatidylcholine (HSPC) and distearoyl phosphatidylglycerol (DSPG) (molar ratio: 1:3) were injected intravenously into HFC-fed Ldlr-/- mice once a week for 4 weeks. Mice receiving nanoliposomes had significantly reduced atherosclerosis within the aortic arch as assessed by Sudan IV staining area (p = 0.007), and reduced intima/media ratio (p = 0.030) and greater collagen deposition within atherosclerosis plaques within the brachiocephalic artery (p = 0.007), compared to control mice. Administration of nanoliposomes enhanced markers of reverse cholesterol transport (RCT) and increased markers of plaque stability in HFC-fed Ldlr-/- mice. Reduced cholesterol accumulation was observed in the liver along with the up-regulation of the major genes involved in the efflux of cholesterol such as hepatic ATP-binding cassette transporters (ABC) including Abc-a1, Abc-g1, Abc-g5, and Abc-g8, Scavenger receptor class B, member 1 (Scarb1), and Liver X receptor alpha (Lxr)-α. Lecithin Cholesterol Acyltransferase activity within the plasma was also increased in mice receiving nanoliposomes. Anionic nanoliposome administration reduced atherosclerosis in HFC-fed Ldlr-/- mice by promoting RCT and upregulating the ABC-A1/ABC-G1 pathway.
Sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1c (SREBP-1c) is a central regulator of lipogenesis whose activity is controlled by proteolytic cleavage. The metabolic factors that affect its processing are incompletely understood. Here, we show that dynamic changes in the acyl chain composition of ER phospholipids affect SREBP-1c maturation in physiology and disease. The abundance of polyunsaturated phosphatidylcholine in liver ER is selectively increased in response to feeding and in the setting of obesity-linked insulin resistance. Exogenous delivery of polyunsaturated phosphatidylcholine to ER accelerated SREBP-1c processing through a mechanism that required an intact SREBP cleavage-activating protein (SCAP) pathway. Furthermore, induction of the phospholipid-remodeling enzyme LPCAT3 in response to liver X receptor (LXR) activation promoted SREBP-1c processing by driving the incorporation of polyunsaturated fatty acids into ER. Conversely, LPCAT3 deficiency increased membrane saturation, reduced nuclear SREBP-1c abundance, and blunted the lipogenic response to feeding, LXR agonist treatment, or obesity-linked insulin resistance. Desaturation of the ER membrane may serve as an auxiliary signal of the fed state that promotes lipid synthesis in response to nutrient availability.
There is an urgent need for biomarkers for the early detection of ovarian cancer (OC). The purpose of this study was to assess whether changes in serum levels of lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT), sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), glucose-regulated protein, 78 kDa (GRP78), calprotectin and insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 2 (IGFBP2) are observed before clinical presentation and to assess the performance of these markers alone and in combination with CA125 for early detection.
This nested case-control study used samples from the United Kingdom Collaborative Trial of Ovarian Cancer Screening trial. The sample set consisted of 482 serum samples from 49 OC subjects and 31 controls, with serial samples spanning up to 7 years pre-diagnosis. The set was divided into the following: (I) a discovery set, which included all women with only two samples from each woman, the first at&lt;14 months and the second at &gt;32 months to diagnosis; and (ii) a corroboration set, which included all the serial samples from the same women spanning the 7-year period. Lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase, SHBG, GRP78, calprotectin and IGFBP2 were measured using ELISA. The performance of the markers to detect cancers pre-diagnosis was assessed.
A combined threshold model IGFBP2 &gt;78.5 ng ml-1 : LCAT &lt;8.831 μg ml-1 : CA125 &gt;35 U ml-1 outperformed CA125 alone for the earlier detection of OC. The threshold model was able to identify the most aggressive Type II cancers. In addition, it increased the lead time by 5-6 months and identified 26% of Type I subjects and 13% of Type II subjects that were not identified by CA125 alone.
Combined biomarker panels (IGFBP2, LCAT and CA125) outperformed CA125 up to 3 years pre-diagnosis, identifying cancers missed by CA125, providing increased diagnostic lead times for Type I and Type II OC. The model identified more aggressive Type II cancers, with women crossing the threshold dying earlier, indicating that these markers can improve on the sensitivity of CA125 alone for the early detection of OC.
Persons with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) have an elevated risk of atherosclerosis. High-density lipoproteins (HDL) normally protect against cardiovascular disease (CVD), but this may be attenuated by serum amyloid A (SAA). In a case-control study of young females, blood samples were compared between subjects with T2DM (n = 42) and individuals without T2DM (n = 42). SAA and apolipoprotein AI (apoAI) concentrations, paraoxonase-1 (PON-1), cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP), and lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) activities were measured in the serum and/or HDL2 and HDL3 subfractions. SAA concentrations were higher in T2DM compared to controls: serum (30 mg/L (17, 68) versus 15 mg/L (7, 36); p = 0.002), HDL2 (1.0 mg/L (0.6, 2.2) versus 0.4 mg/L (0.2, 0.7); p &lt; 0.001), and HDL3, (13 mg/L (8, 29) versus 6 mg/L (3, 13); p &lt; 0.001). Serum-PON-1 activity was lower in T2DM compared to that in controls (38,245 U/L (7025) versus 41,109 U/L (5690); p = 0.043). CETP activity was higher in T2DM versus controls in HDL2 (232.6 μmol/L (14.1) versus 217.1 μmol/L (25.1); p = 0.001) and HDL3 (279.5 μmol/L (17.7) versus 245.2 μmol/L (41.2); p &lt; 0.001). These results suggest that individuals with T2DM have increased SAA-related inflammation and dysfunctional HDL features. SAA may prove to be a useful biomarker in T2DM given its association with elevated CVD risk.
Fusion genes involved in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) occur mostly due to genetic and environmental factors, and only a limited number of studies have reported any ethnic influence. This study assesses whether an ethnic influence has an effect on the frequency of any of the four fusion genes: BCR-ABL1, ETV6-RUNX1, TCF3-PBX1, and MLL-AFF1 found in ALL. To study this ethnic influence, mononuclear cells were obtained from bone marrow samples from 143 patients with ALL. We performed RNA extraction and reverse transcription, then assessed the quality of the cDNA by amplifying the ABL1 control gene, and finally evaluated the presence of the four transcripts by multiplex polymerase chain reaction. We found 10 patients who had the BCR-ABL1 fusion gene (7%); 3 patients (2%) were TCF3-PBX1 positive; and 6 patients (4.5%) were ETV6-RUNX1 positive. The incidence of this last fusion gene is quite low when compared to the values reported in most countries. The low incidence of the ETV6-RUNX1 fusion gene found in Guatemala matches the incidence rates that have been reported in Spain and Indian Romani. Since it is known that an ethnic resemblance exists among these three populations, as shown by ancestral marker studies, the ALL data suggests an ethnic influence on the occurrence and frequency of this particular fusion gene. 
Cutaneous myoepithelial tumors demonstrate heterogenous morphologic and immunophenotypic features. We previously described, in brief, 7 cases of cutaneous myoepithelioma showing solid syncytial growth of ovoid, spindled, or histiocytoid cells. We now present the clinicopathologic features in a series of 38 cases of this distinctive syncytial variant, which were diagnosed between 1997 and 2012 (mostly seen in consultation). There were 27 men and 11 women, with a median age of 39 years (range, 2 mo to 74 y). Primary anatomic sites were the upper extremity (11, including 2 on the hand), upper limb girdle (3), lower extremity (14; 3 on the foot), back (6), face (2), chest (1), and buttock (1); the typical presentation was as either a polypoid or papular lesion. Tumors were well circumscribed and centered in the dermis and ranged in size from 0.3 to 2.7 cm (median 0.8 cm). Microscopically all tumors showed a solid sheet-like growth of uniformly sized ovoid to spindled or histiocytoid cells with palely eosinophilic syncytial cytoplasm. Nuclei were vesicular with fine chromatin and small or inconspicuous nucleoli and exhibited minimal to no atypia. Mitoses ranged from 0 to 4 per 10 HPF; 28 tumors showed no mitoses. Necrosis and lymphovascular invasion were consistently absent. Adipocytic metaplasia, appearing as superficial fat entrapped within the tumor, was seen in 12 cases. Chondro-osseous differentiation was seen in 1 tumor. All tumors examined were diffusely positive for EMA, and the majority showed diffuse staining for S-100 protein (5 showing focal staining). Keratin staining was focal in 1 of 33 tumors and seen in rare cells in 3 other cases. There was also positivity for GFAP (14/33), SMA (9/13), and p63 (6/11). Most lesions were treated by local excision. The majority of tumors tested (14/17; 82%) were positive by fluorescence in situ hybridization for EWSR1 gene rearrangement; testing for potential fusion partners (PBX1, ZNF444, POU5F1, DUX4, ATF1, CREB1, NR4A3, DDIT3, and NFATc2) was negative in all EWSR1-rearranged tumors. No FUS gene rearrangement was detected in 2 tumors lacking EWSR1 rearrangement. Follow-up information is available for 21 patients (mean follow-up 15 mo). One patient with a positive deep margin developed a local recurrence 51 months after initial biopsy. All other patients with available follow-up information, including 11 who had positive deep margins, are alive with no evidence of disease and no reported metastases. In summary, cutaneous syncytial myoepithelioma is a morphologically distinct variant that more frequently affects men, occurs over a wide age range, and usually presents on the extremities. Tumors are positive for S-100 protein and EMA, and, unlike most myoepithelial neoplasms, keratin staining is infrequent. EWSR1 gene rearrangement is present in nearly all tumors tested and likely involves a novel fusion partner. Prior reports describe some risk of recurrence and metastasis for cutaneous myoepithelial tumors; however, the syncytial variant appears to behave in a benign manner and only rarely recurs locally.
Insulin-like growth factor 2 mRNA-binding proteins IGF2BP1, IGF2BP2, and IGF2BP3 have been shown to have diagnostic and prognostic utility in a number of epithelial and soft tissue tumors. Still, little is known about the expression of these molecules in different types of leukemia and our study aims to fill this gap. By using an RT-qPCR approach, we have systemically analyzed the expression of three IGF2BP coding genes in normal hematopoietic tissues and distinct acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) entities. We show that low/negative IGF2BP1 and IGF2BP3 and high IGF2BP2 levels are characteristic to healthy donor bone marrow and peripheral blood whereas different B-ALL entities displayed characteristic perturbations of IGF2BP expression patterns. Namely, we have identified significant associations of overexpressed IGF2BP1 with ETV6/RUNX1-positive (r(2)=0.7891, y=0.8105x-0.4471, p&lt;0.0001), underexpressed IGF2BP2 with E2A/PBX1-positive (p&lt;0.01), and overexpressed IGF2BP2 and IGF2BP3 with MLL/AF4-positive (r(2)=0.6571, y=0.1507x-0.2722, p&lt;0.0001, and r(2)=0.7022, y=0.6482x-0.7660, p&lt;0.0001, respectively) leukemia. Secondly, based on transcript expression dynamics during follow-up, we conclude that overexpression of only IGF2BP1 is inherent characteristic of ETV6/RUNX1-positive leukemic blasts in contrast to IGF2BP3 which remained stably expressed throughout the monitoring period and upon the achievement of molecular remission. Finally, our data suggest that IGF2BP3 might be a marker of disease aggressiveness in BCR/ABL1-positive ALL as consistently increasing levels of this transcript during follow-up predicted eventual leukemia relapse by three months. Altogether, our results highlight the potential utility of IGF2BP profiling in precursor B lymphoid neoplasms as the functions of IGF2BPs in normal and malignant hematopoiesis are further delineated.
The proto-oncogenic protein c-Myb is an essential regulator of hematopoiesis and is frequently deregulated in hematological diseases such as lymphoma and leukemia. To gain insight into the mechanisms underlying the aberrant expression of c-Myb in myeloid leukemia, we analyzed and compared c-myb gene transcriptional regulation using two cell lines modeling normal hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs) and transformed myelomonocytic blasts. We report that the transcription factors HoxA9, Meis1, Pbx1 and Pbx2 bind in vivo to the c-myb locus and maintain its expression through different mechanisms in HPCs and leukemic cells. Our analysis also points to a critical role for Pbx2 in deregulating c-myb expression in murine myeloid cells cotransformed by the cooperative activity of HoxA9 and Meis1. This effect is associated with an intronic positioning of epigenetic marks and RNA polymerase II binding in the orthologous region of a previously described alternative promoter for c-myb. Taken together, our results could provide a first hint to explain the abnormal expression of c-myb in leukemic cells.
To evaluate the efficiency of one-step multiplex RT-PCR for identifying four common fusion transcripts (TEL/AML1, E2A/PBX1, MLL/AF4 and BCR/ABL) in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).
Total RNA was extracted from bone marrow samples of 76 children who were newly diagnosed with ALL between January 2003 and December 2010. These RNAs were analyzed for TEL/AML1, E2A/PBX1, MLL/AF4 and BCR/ABL by one-step multiplex RT-PCR or common nested-multiplex PCR. The PCR products were confirmed by DNA sequencing.
TEL/AML1 was found in 12 cases (the length of products was 298 bp in 9 cases and 259 bp in 3 cases), E2A/PBX1 was found in 3 cases (the length of products was 373 bp), BCR/ABL was found in 1 case (the length of products was 2 124 bp), and MLL/AF4 was found in 7 cases (the length of products was 427 bp in 1 case and 673 bp in 6 cases) using one-step multiplex RT-PCR combined with DNA sequencing. The results were consistent with those using common nested-multiplex PCR.
One-step multiplex RT-PCR may be another alternative for detection of common fusion transcripts in children with ALL.
Study to date suggests that BCL6 protein expression in B-cell neoplasia predominates in germinal center-derived tumors, but less is known regarding its expression in B-lymphoblastic leukemia. Therefore, we designed a comprehensive study of BCL6 expression in B-lymphoblastic leukemia.
BCL6, LMO, and HGAL protein expression in B-lymphoblastic leukemia was investigated using immunohistochemical staining of paraffin-embedded bone marrow specimens. Cryptic TCF3(E2A)-PBX1 rearrangements were investigated using interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization.
Six (12%) of 52 B-lymphoblastic leukemias demonstrated BCL6 protein expression, with B-cell lymphoblastic leukemias containing a t(1;19) translocation demonstrating the strongest staining (three of three). Additional t(1;19) cases beyond the screening study showed similar results. Public microarray expression database mining showed that BCL6 messenger RNA expression levels in B-lymphoblastic leukemia correlated with the protein expression findings. Finally, other markers of B-cell development correlated with BCL6 expression in t(1;19) B-lymphoblastic leukemia cases, with LMO2 and HGAL proteins expressed in six (67%) of nine and eight (89%) of nine cases, respectively.
BCL6 expression is present in a subset of B-lymphoblastic leukemias, especially in cases containing the 1;19 translocation. Investigation for TCF3(E2A)-PBX1 rearrangements may be useful in BCL6-positive B-lymphoblastic leukemia.
Myoepithelial tumours of soft tissue are rare lesions with a broad morphological and clinical spectrum. Previous studies have found EWSR1 rearrangements in approximately half of all cases and PBX1, ZNF44 and POU5F1 have been identified as recurrent fusion partners. In bone, only a small number of myoepithelial tumours have been described. We investigated an intraosseous myoepithelioma of the sacrum in a 54-year-old man without EWSR1 rearrangement for the presence of other fusion genes.
G-banding analysis, SNP-array and fluorescence in situ hybridisation suggested rearrangement of the FUS and POU5F1 genes. RT-PCR confirmed a chimeric in-frame transcript fusing FUS exon 5 to POU5F1 exon 2. The clinical course after en bloc resection was without recurrence or metastasis over a period of 87 months.
We report a novel FUS-POU5F1 fusion gene in an intraosseous myoepithelioma of the sacrum. This case highlights that FUS can replace EWSR1 as the N-terminal transactivator in oncogenic fusion genes in myoepithelial tumours, similar to that which has previously been demonstrated in other tumour entities. Thus, in addition to EWSR1, also FUS needs to be considered as a potential fusion partner in the molecular work up of myoepithelial tumours.
Thoracic myoepithelial tumors (MTs) are a rare group of tumors showing predominant or exclusive myoepithelial differentiation. They are poorly characterized from both a morphologic and genetic standpoint, in particular features that separate benign from malignant behavior. We examined the histologic and immunohistochemical features of 8 primary thoracic MTs and performed fluorescence in situ hybridization for EWSR1, FUS, PLAG1, and HMGA2, as well as several partner genes. Half (4/8) of the MTs occurred in large airways, and 3 had infiltrative borders. All cases showed immunoreactivity for epithelial markers, in conjunction with S100 protein or myogenic markers. MTs showed morphologic characteristics analogous to MTs at other sites, with no tumors having ductal differentiation. Necrosis and/or lymphovascular invasion was present in 5 cases, with mitotic activity ranging from 0 to 6 mitoses/2 mm² (mean 1). Metastases occurred in 2 cases, and no patients died of disease. Gene rearrangements were identified in half of the cases, with EWSR1-PBX1, EWSR1-ZNF444, and FUS-KLF17 fusions identified in 1 case each and 1 case having EWSR1 rearrangement with no partner identified. No cases were found to have HMGA2 or PLAG1 abnormalities. Compared with fusion-negative tumors, fusion-positive tumors tended to occur in patients who were younger (50 vs. 58 y), female (1:3 vs. 3:1 male:female ratio), and demonstrated predominantly spindle and clear cell morphology. Using a combined data set of our case series with 16 cases from the literature, poor prognosis was significantly correlated with metastases (P=0.003), necrosis (P=0.027), and ≥5 mitoses/2 mm²/10 high-power field (P=0.005). In summary, we identify a subset of thoracic MTs harboring rearrangements in EWSR1 or FUS, and our data suggest that necrosis and increased mitotic activity correlate with aggressive clinical behavior.
Proteoglycan (PG) synthesis begins with the sequential addition of a "linker chain", made up of four sugar residues, to a specific region of a core protein. Defects in the enzymes catalyzing steps two to four of the linker chain synthesis have been shown to cause autosomal recessive human phenotypes while no mutation has yet been reported in humans for the xylosyltransferases 1 and 2 (XT1 and XT2), the initiating enzymes in the linker chain formation. Here, we present a consanguineous Turkish family with two affected individuals presenting with short stature, distinct facial features, alterations of fat distribution, and moderate intellectual disability. X-rays showed only mild skeletal changes in the form of a short femoral neck, stocky and plump long bones and thickened ribs. Using a combination of whole-exome sequencing (WES), determination of homozygous stretches by WES variants, and classical linkage analysis, we identified the homozygous missense mutation c.C1441T in XYLT1, encoding XT1, within a large homozygous stretch on chromosome 16p13.12-p12.1. The mutation co-segregated with the phenotype in the family, is not found in over 13,000 alleles in the exome variant server and is predicted to change a highly conserved arginine at position 481 (p.R481W) located in the putative catalytical domain. Immunostaining of primary patient fibroblasts showed a loss of predominance of Golgi localization in mutant cells. Moreover, western blot analysis of decorin in cell culture supernatant demonstrated glycosylation differences between patient and control cells. Our data provide evidence that functional alterations of XT1 cause an autosomal recessive short stature syndrome associated with intellectual disability. 
The Notch signaling pathway controls a large number of processes during animal development and adult homeostasis. One of the conserved post-translational modifications of the Notch receptors is the addition of an O-linked glucose to epidermal growth factor-like (EGF) repeats with a C-X-S-X-(P/A)-C motif by Protein O-glucosyltransferase 1 (POGLUT1; Rumi in Drosophila). Genetic experiments in flies and mice, and in vivo structure-function analysis in flies indicate that O-glucose residues promote Notch signaling. The O-glucose residues on mammalian Notch1 and Notch2 proteins are efficiently extended by the addition of one or two xylose residues through the function of specific mammalian xylosyltransferases. However, the contribution of xylosylation to Notch signaling is not known. Here, we identify the Drosophila enzyme Shams responsible for the addition of xylose to O-glucose on EGF repeats. Surprisingly, loss- and gain-of-function experiments strongly suggest that xylose negatively regulates Notch signaling, opposite to the role played by glucose residues. Mass spectrometric analysis of Drosophila Notch indicates that addition of xylose to O-glucosylated Notch EGF repeats is limited to EGF14-20. A Notch transgene with mutations in the O-glucosylation sites of Notch EGF16-20 recapitulates the shams loss-of-function phenotypes, and suppresses the phenotypes caused by the overexpression of human xylosyltransferases. Antibody staining in animals with decreased Notch xylosylation indicates that xylose residues on EGF16-20 negatively regulate the surface expression of the Notch receptor. Our studies uncover a specific role for xylose in the regulation of the Drosophila Notch signaling, and suggest a previously unrecognized regulatory role for EGF16-20 of Notch.
LARGE-dependent modification enables α-dystroglycan (α-DG) to bind to its extracellular matrix ligands. Mutations in the LARGE gene and several others involved in O-mannosyl glycan synthesis have been identified in congenital and limb-girdle muscular dystrophies that are characterized by perturbed glycosylation and reduced ligand-binding affinity of α-DG. LARGE is a bifunctional glycosyltransferase that alternately transfers xylose and glucuronic acid, thereby generating the heteropolysaccharides on α-DG that confer its ligand binding. Although the LARGE paralog LARGE2 (also referred to as GYLTL1B) has likewise been shown to enhance the functional modification of α-DG in cultured cells, its enzymatic activities have not been identified. Here, we report that LARGE2 is also a bifunctional glycosyltransferase and compare its properties with those of LARGE. By means of a high-performance liquid chromatography-based enzymatic assay, we demonstrate that like LARGE, LARGE2 has xylosyltransferase (Xyl-T) and glucuronyltransferase (GlcA-T) activities, as well as polymerizing activity. Notably, however, the pH optima of the Xyl-T and GlcA-T of LARGE2 are distinct from one another and also from those of LARGE. Our results suggest that LARGE and LARGE2 catalyze the same glycosylation reactions for the functional modification of α-DG, but that they have different biochemical properties.
The Arabidopsis genome includes seven family 34 glycosyltransferase (GT34) encoding genes. XXT1 and XXT2 have previously been shown to encode XyG α-1,6-xylosyltransferases, while knockout mutants of a third, XXT5, exhibit decreased XyG content, suggesting a similar activity. Here, we extend the study to the rest of the Arabidopsis GT34 genes in terms of biochemical activity and their roles in XyG biosynthesis. The enzyme activity of XXTs was investigated using recombinant protein expressed in E. coli. XyG analysis of single and double T-DNA insertion knockouts, together with overexpression of GT34s in selected mutant lines, provided detailed function of each gene. We reveal the activity of the third member of the GT34 gene family (XXT4) that exhibits xylosyltransferase activity. Double mutants for either xxt2 or xxt5 had a large impact on XyG content, structure and size distribution. Overexpression of the remaining member, XXT3, was able to restore XyG epitopes in xxt2, xxt5 and xxt2 xxt5 double knockouts, suggesting that it also encodes a protein with XXT activity. Our work demonstrates that five of the seven Arabidopsis GT34 genes encode XXT enzymes.
The haemostatic relevance of antithrombin together with the low genetic variability of SERPINC1, and the high heritability of plasma levels encourage the search for modulating genes. We used a hypothesis-free approach to identify these genes, evaluating associations between plasma antithrombin and 307,984 polymorphisms in the GAIT study (352 individuals from 21 Spanish families). Despite no SNP reaching the genome wide significance threshold, we verified milder positive associations in 307 blood donors from a different cohort. This validation study suggested LARGE, a gene encoding a protein with xylosyltransferase and glucuronyltransferase activities that forms heparin-like linear polysaccharides, as a potential modulator of antithrombin based on the significant association of one SNPs, rs762057, with anti-FXa activity, particularly after adjustment for age, sex and SERPINC1 rs2227589 genotype, all factors influencing antithrombin levels (p = 0.02). Additional results sustained this association. LARGE silencing inHepG2 and HEK-EBNA cells did not affect SERPINC1 mRNA levels but significantly reduced the secretion of antithrombin with moderate intracellular retention. Milder effects were observed on α1-antitrypsin, prothrombin and transferrin. Our study suggests LARGE as the first known modifier of plasma antithrombin, and proposes a new role for LARGE in modulating extracellular secretion of certain glycoproteins.
Recent studies demonstrated that mutations in B3GNT1, an enzyme proposed to be involved in poly-N-acetyllactosamine synthesis, were causal for congenital muscular dystrophy with hypoglycosylation of α-dystroglycan (secondary dystroglycanopathies). Since defects in the O-mannosylation protein glycosylation pathway are primarily responsible for dystroglycanopathies and with no established O-mannose initiated structures containing a β3 linked GlcNAc known, we biochemically interrogated this human enzyme. Here we report this enzyme is not a β-1,3-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase with catalytic activity towards β-galactose but rather a β-1,4-glucuronyltransferase, designated B4GAT1, towards both α- and β-anomers of xylose. The dual-activity LARGE enzyme is capable of extending products of B4GAT1 and we provide experimental evidence that B4GAT1 is the priming enzyme for LARGE. Our results further define the functional O-mannosylated glycan structure and indicate that B4GAT1 is involved in the initiation of the LARGE-dependent repeating disaccharide that is necessary for extracellular matrix protein binding to O-mannosylated α-dystroglycan that is lacking in secondary dystroglycanopathies. 
The enzymatic mechanism that governs the synthesis of the xylan backbone polymer, a linear chain of xylose residues connected by β-1,4 glycosidic linkages, has remained elusive. Xylan is a major constituent of many kinds of plant cell walls, and genetic studies have identified multiple genes that affect xylan formation. In this study, we investigate several homologs of one of these previously identified xylan-related genes, IRX10 from Arabidopsis thaliana, by heterologous expression and in vitro xylan xylosyltransferase assay. We find that an IRX10 homolog from the moss Physcomitrella patens displays robust activity, and we show that the xylosidic linkage formed is a β-1,4 linkage, establishing this protein as a xylan β-1,4-xylosyltransferase. We also find lower but reproducible xylan xylosyltransferase activity with A. thaliana IRX10 and with a homolog from the dicot plant Plantago ovata, showing that xylan xylosyltransferase activity is conserved over large evolutionary distance for these proteins. 
Mutations in the LARGE gene have been identified in congenital muscular dystrophy (CMD) patients with brain abnormalities. Both LARGE and its paralog, LARGE2 (also referred to as GYLTL1B) are bifunctional glycosyltransferases with xylosyltransferase (Xyl-T) and glucuronyltransferase (GlcA-T) activities, and are capable of forming polymers consisting of [-3Xyl-α1,3GlcAβ1-] repeats. LARGE-dependent modification of α-dystroglycan (α-DG) with these polysaccharides is essential for the ability of α-DG to act as a receptor for ligands in the extracellular matrix. Here we report on the endogenous enzymatic activities of LARGE and LARGE2 in mice and humans, using a newly developed assay for GlcA-T activity. We show that normal mouse and human cultured cells have endogenous LARGE GlcA-T, and that this activity is absent in cells from the Large(myd) (Large-deficient) mouse model of muscular dystrophy, as well as in cells from CMD patients with mutations in the LARGE gene. We also demonstrate that GlcA-T activity is significant in the brain, heart, and skeletal muscle of wild-type and Large2(-/-) mice, but negligible in the corresponding tissues of the Large(myd) mice. Notably, GlcA-T activity is substantial, though reduced, in the kidneys of both the Large(myd) and Large2(-/-) mice, consistent with the observation of α-DG/laminin binding in these contexts. This study is the first to test LARGE activity in samples as small as cryosections and, moreover, provides the first direct evidence that not only LARGE, but also LARGE2, is vital to effective functional modification of α-DG in vivo. 
Desbuquois dysplasia type 2 (DBQD2) is a rare recessively inherited skeletal genetic disorder characterized by severe prenatal and postnatal growth retardation, generalized joint laxity with dislocation of large joints and facial dysmorphism. The condition was recently described to result from autosomal recessive mutations in XYLT1, encoding the enzyme xylosyltransferase-1. In this paper, we report on a Polish patient with DBQD2 who presented with severe short stature of prenatal onset, joint laxity, psychomotor retardation and multiple radiological abnormalities including short metacarpals, advanced bone age and exaggerated trochanters. Endocrinological examinations revealed that sleep-induced growth hormone (GH) release and GH peak in clonidine- and glucagon-induced provocative tests as well as insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) and IGF-binding protein-3 levels were all markedly decreased, confirming deficiency of GH secretion. Bone age, unlikely to GH deficiency, was significantly advanced. To establish the diagnosis at a molecular level, we performed whole-exome sequencing and bioinformatic analysis in the index patient, which revealed compound heterozygous XYLT1 mutations: c.595C&gt;T(p.Gln199*) and c.1651C&gt;T(p.Arg551Cys), both of which are novel. Sanger sequencing showed that the former mutation was inherited from the healthy mother, whereas the latter one most probably occurred de novo. Our study describes the first case of DBQD2 resulting from compound heterozygous XYLT1 mutation, expands the mutational spectrum of the disease and provides evidence that the severe growth retardation and microsomia observed in DBQD2 patients may result not only from the skeletal dysplasia itself but also from GH and IGF-1 deficiency. 
A major question remaining in glycobiology is how a glycosyltransferase (GT) that retains the anomeric linkage of a sugar catalyzes the reaction. Xyloside α-1,3-xylosyltransferase (XXYLT1) is a retaining GT that regulates Notch receptor activation by adding xylose to the Notch extracellular domain. Here, using natural acceptor and donor substrates and active Mus musculus XXYLT1, we report a series of crystallographic snapshots along the reaction, including an unprecedented natural and competent Michaelis reaction complex for retaining enzymes. These structures strongly support the SNi-like reaction as the retaining mechanism for XXYLT1. Unexpectedly, the epidermal growth factor-like repeat acceptor substrate undergoes a large conformational change upon binding to the active site, providing a structural basis for substrate specificity. Our improved understanding of this retaining enzyme will accelerate the design of retaining GT inhibitors that can modulate Notch activity in pathological situations in which Notch dysregulation is known to cause cancer or developmental disorders. 
Congenital muscular dystrophy (CMD) is a clinically and genetically heterogeneous group of inherited muscle disorders. Muscle weakness typically presents from birth to early infancy. Affected infants typically appear "floppy" with low muscle tone and poor spontaneous movements. Affected children may present with delay or arrest of gross motor development together with joint and/or spinal rigidity. Muscle weakness may improve, worsen, or stabilize in the short term; however, with time progressive weakness and joint contractures, spinal deformities, and respiratory compromise may affect quality of life and life span. The main CMD subtypes, grouped by involved protein function and gene in which causative allelic variants occur, are laminin alpha-2 (merosin) deficiency (MDC1A), collagen VI-deficient CMD, the dystroglycanopathies (caused by mutation of POMT1, POMT2, FKTN, FKRP, LARGE1, POMGNT1, and ISPD), SELENON (SEPN1)-related CMD (previously known as rigid spine syndrome, RSMD1) and LMNA-related CMD (L-CMD). Several less known CMD subtypes have been reported in a limited number of individuals. Cognitive impairment ranging from intellectual disability to mild cognitive delay, structural brain and/or eye abnormalities, and seizures are found almost exclusively in the dystroglycanopathies while white matter abnormalities without major cognitive involvement tend to be seen in the laminin alpha-2-deficient subtype.
The diagnosis of congenital muscular dystrophy relies on clinical findings, brain and muscle imaging, muscle biopsy histology (dystrophic features without the hallmarks of the structural changes seen in the congenital myopathies), muscle and/or skin immunohistochemical staining, and molecular genetic testing.
The congenital muscular dystrophies are inherited in an autosomal recessive manner with the following exceptions: collagen VI-deficient CMD, which may be inherited in an autosomal recessive or an autosomal dominant manner; LMNA-related CMD (L-CMD), which is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner with all cases to date caused by a de novo pathogenic variant. In autosomal recessive subtypes, each sib of an affected individual has a 25% chance of being affected, a 50% chance of being an asymptomatic carrier, and a 25% chance of being unaffected and not a carrier. Carriers are asymptomatic. Carrier testing for at-risk relatives and prenatal testing for pregnancies at increased risk are possible if the pathogenic variants in the family are known. In autosomal dominant subtypes, the offspring of affected individuals have a 50% chance of being affected. The risk to sibs of an individual with an apparent de novo pathogenic variant is low, but not zero because of the possibility of germline mosaicism in one of the parents. Prenatal testing for pregnancies at increased risk is possible for families in which the pathogenic variant has been identified.
Treatment of manifestations: Treatment tailored to an individual’s needs is best managed by a multidisciplinary team. Speech therapy and swallowing studies are used to evaluate those with feeding difficulties and/or possible aspiration. Interventions may be needed for inadequate weight gain and poor feeding. Aspiration pneumonia and/or respiratory insufficiency may require assisted cough devices, supplemental oxygen, noninvasive ventilation, and/or mechanical ventilation via tracheostomy. Physical therapy focuses on stretching exercises of the spine and limbs and to prevent contractures, and positive pressure devices or ventilation to promote mobility of the thoracic cage. Splints, braces and surgical intervention are used to prevent and treat spinal and limb contractures and deformities; these and other assistive devices may help posture, ambulation, and mobility. Epilepsy, behavior problems, and/or intellectual disability require specific treatment and interventions. Vaccinations, early treatment of pulmonary infections, and attention to oral hygiene and care are important aspects of routine care. With support for their physical disabilities the vast majority of children with CMD who have normal cognitive development benefit socially and educationally from mainstreaming into regular educational facilities. The multidisciplinary team can provide social and emotional support for patients and caregivers. Surveillance: Routine monitoring of feeding and weight gain, respiratory function, strength, and mobility; annual or biannual monitoring for orthopedic and pulmonary complications; cardiac monitoring for those with CMD subtypes involving a risk for cardiomyopathy. Those with CMD subtypes with central nervous system involvement require surveillance for possible seizures and/or behavioral problems.
Both LARGE1 (formerly LARGE) and its paralog LARGE2 are bifunctional glycosyltransferases with xylosy- and glucuronyltransferase activities, and are capable of synthesizing polymers composed of a repeating disaccharide [-3Xylα1,3GlcAβ1-]. Post-translational modification of the O-mannosyl glycan of α-dystroglycan (α-DG) with the polysaccharide is essential for it to act as a receptor for ligands in the extracellular matrix (ECM), and both LARGE paralogs contribute to the modification in vivo. LARGE1 and LARGE2 have different tissue distribution profiles and enzymatic properties; however, the functional difference of the homologs remains to be determined, and α-DG is the only known substrate for the modification by LARGE1 or LARGE2. Here we show that LARGE2 can modify proteoglycans (PGs) with the laminin-binding glycan. We found that overexpression of LARGE2, but not LARGE1, mediates the functional modification on the surface of DG-/-, Pomt1-/- and Fktn-/- embryonic stem cells. We identified a heparan sulfate-PG glypican-4 as a substrate for the LARGE2-dependent modification by affinity purification and subsequent mass spectrometric analysis. Furthermore, we showed that LARGE2 could modify several additional PGs with the laminin-binding glycan, most likely within the glycosaminoglycan (GAG)-protein linkage region. Our results indicate that LARGE2 can modify PGs with the GAG-like polysaccharide composed of xylose and glucuronic acid to confer laminin binding. Thus, LARGE2 may play a differential role in stabilizing the basement membrane and modifying its functions by augmenting the interactions between laminin globular domain-containing ECM proteins and PGs.
The Large(myd) mouse has a loss-of-function mutation in the putative glycosyltransferase gene Large. Mutations in the human homolog (LARGE) have been described in a form of congenital muscular dystrophy (MDC1D). Other genes (POMT1, POMGnT1, fukutin, and FKRP) that encode known or putative glycosylation enzymes are also causally associated with human congenital muscular dystrophies. All these diseases are associated with hypoglycosylation of the membrane protein alpha-dystroglycan (alpha-DG) and consequent loss of extracellular ligand binding. Hence, they are termed dystroglycanopathies. A paralogous gene for LARGE (LARGE2 or GYLTL1B) may also have a role in DG glycosylation. Using database interrogation and reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), we identified vertebrate orthologs of each of these LARGE genes in many vertebrates, including human, mouse, dog, chicken, zebrafish, and pufferfish. However, within invertebrate genomes, we were able to identify only single homologs. We suggest that vertebrate LARGE orthologs be referred to as LARGE1. RT-PCR, dot-blot, and northern analysis indicated that LARGE2 has a more restricted tissue-expression profile than LARGE1. Using epitope-tagged proteins, we show that both LARGE1 and LARGE2 localize to the Golgi apparatus. The high similarity between the LARGE paralogs suggests that LARGE2 may also act on DG. Overexpression of LARGE2 in mouse C2C12 myoblasts results in increased glycosylation of alpha-DG accompanied by an increase in laminin binding. Thus, there may be functional redundancy between LARGE1 and LARGE2. Consistent with this idea, we show that alpha-DG is still fully glycosylated in kidney (a tissue that expresses a high level of LARGE2 mRNA) of Large(myd) mutant mice.
The Golgi complex (GC) is the central organelle of the classical secretory pathway, and it receives, modifies and packages proteins and lipids en route to their intracellular or extracellular destinations. Recent studies of congenital muscular dystrophies in skeletal muscle suggest an exciting new role for an old and well-established function of the GC: glycosylation. Glycosylation is the exquisitely regulated enzymatic addition of nucleotide sugars to proteins and lipids mediated by glycosyltransferases (GTs). Mutations in putative Golgi-resident GTs, fukutin, fukutin-related protein and large1 cause these progressive muscle-wasting diseases. The appropriate localization of GTs to specific subcompartments of the Golgi is critical for the correct assembly line-like addition of glycan groups to proteins and lipids as they pass through the GC. Consequently, these studies of congenital muscular dystrophies have focused attention on the organization and function of the GC in skeletal muscle. In contrast to other cells and tissues, the GC in skeletal muscle has received relatively little attention; however, in recent years, several studies have shown that GC distribution in muscle is highly dynamic or plastic and adopts different distributions in muscle cells undergoing myogenesis, denervation, regeneration and maturation. Here, we review the current understanding of the dynamic regulation of GC organization in skeletal muscle and focus on the targeting of fukutin, fukutin-related protein and large1 to the GC in muscle cells.
Common fragile sites (CFS) are chromosome regions that are prone to form gaps or breaks in response to DNA replication stress. They are often found as hotspots for sister chromatid exchanges, deletions, and amplifications in different cancers. Many of the CFS regions are found to span genes whose genomic sequence is greater than 1 Mb, some of which have been demonstrated to function as important tumor suppressors. CFS regions are also hotspots for human papillomavirus (HPV) integrations in cervical cancer. We used mate-pair sequencing to examine HPV integration events and chromosomal structural variations in 34 oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC). We used endpoint PCR and Sanger sequencing to validate each HPV integration event and found HPV integrations preferentially occurred within CFS regions similar to what is observed in cervical cancer. We also found that many of the chromosomal alterations detected also occurred at or near the cytogenetic location of CFSs. Several large genes were also found to be recurrent targets of rearrangements, independent of HPV integrations, including CSMD1 (2.1Mb), LRP1B (1.9Mb), and LARGE1 (0.7Mb). Sanger sequencing revealed that the nucleotide sequences near to identified junction sites contained repetitive and AT-rich sequences that were shown to have the potential to form stem-loop DNA secondary structures that might stall DNA replication fork progression during replication stress. This could then cause increased instability in these regions which could lead to cancer development in human cells. Our findings suggest that CFSs and some specific large genes appear to play important roles in OPSCC. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
The DLG-MAGUK subfamily of proteins plays a role on the recycling and clustering of glutamate receptors (GLUR) at the postsynaptic density. discs-large1 (dlg) is the only DLG-MAGUK gene in Drosophila and originates two main products, DLGA and DLGS97 which differ by the presence of an L27 domain. Combining electrophysiology, immunostaining and genetic manipulation at the pre and postsynaptic compartments we study the DLG contribution to the basal synaptic-function at the Drosophila larval neuromuscular junction. Our results reveal a specific function of DLGS97 in the regulation of the size of GLUR fields and their subunit composition. Strikingly the absence of any of DLG proteins at the presynaptic terminal disrupts the clustering and localization of the calcium channel DmCa1A subunit (Cacophony), decreases the action potential-evoked release probability and alters short-term plasticity. Our results show for the first time a crucial role of DLG proteins in the presynaptic function in vivo.
The "moth-eye" structure, which is observed on the surface of corneal lens in several insects, supports anti-reflective and self-cleaning functions due to nanoscale protrusions known as corneal nipples. Although the morphology and function of the "moth-eye" structure, are relatively well studied, the mechanism of protrusion formation from cell-secreted substances is unknown. In Drosophila melanogaster, a compound eye consists of approximately 800 facets, the surface of which is formed by the corneal lens with nanoscale protrusions. In the present study, we sought to identify genes involved in "moth-eye" structure, formation in order to elucidate the developmental mechanism of the protrusions in Drosophila. We re-examined the aberrant patterns in classical glossy-eye mutants by scanning electron microscope and classified the aberrant patterns into groups. Next, we screened genes encoding putative structural cuticular proteins and genes involved in cuticular formation using eye specific RNAi silencing methods combined with the Gal4/UAS expression system. We identified 12 of 100 candidate genes, such as cuticular proteins family genes (Cuticular protein 23B and Cuticular protein 49Ah), cuticle secretion-related genes (Syntaxin 1A and Sec61 ββ subunit), ecdysone signaling and biosynthesis-related genes (Ecdysone receptor, Blimp-1, and shroud), and genes involved in cell polarity/cell architecture (Actin 5C, shotgun, armadillo, discs large1, and coracle). Although some of the genes we identified may affect corneal protrusion formation indirectly through general patterning defects in eye formation, these initial findings have encouraged us to more systematically explore the precise mechanisms underlying the formation of nanoscale protrusions in Drosophila.
mRNA is modified co-transcriptionally at the 5' end by the addition of an inverted guanosine cap structure which can be methylated at several positions. The mRNA cap recruits proteins involved in gene expression and identifies the transcript as being cellular or 'self' in the innate immune response. Methylation of the first transcribed nucleotide on the ribose 2'-O position is a prevalent cap modification which has roles in splicing, translation and provides protection against the innate immune response. In this review, we discuss the regulation and function of CMTR1, the first transcribed nucleotide ribose 2'-O methyltransferase, and the molecular interactions which mediate methylated 2'-O ribose function.

Antibodies are critical tools in many avenues of biological research. Though antibodies can be produced in the research laboratory setting, most research labs working with vertebrates avail themselves of the wide array of commercially available reagents. By contrast, few such reagents are available for work with model organisms.
We report the production of monoclonal antibodies directed against a wide range of proteins that label specific subcellular and cellular components, and macromolecular complexes. Antibodies were made to synaptobrevin (SNB-1), a component of synaptic vesicles; to Rim (UNC-10), a protein localized to synaptic active zones; to transforming acidic coiled-coil protein (TAC-1), a component of centrosomes; to CENP-C (HCP-4), which in worms labels the entire length of their holocentric chromosomes; to ORC2 (ORC-2), a subunit of the DNA origin replication complex; to the nucleolar phosphoprotein NOPP140 (DAO-5); to the nuclear envelope protein lamin (LMN-1); to EHD1 (RME-1) a marker for recycling endosomes; to caveolin (CAV-1), a marker for caveolae; to the cytochrome P450 (CYP-33E1), a resident of the endoplasmic reticulum; to beta-1,3-glucuronyltransferase (SQV-8) that labels the Golgi; to a chaperonin (HSP-60) targeted to mitochondria; to LAMP (LMP-1), a resident protein of lysosomes; to the alpha subunit of the 20S subcomplex (PAS-7) of the 26S proteasome; to dynamin (DYN-1) and to the alpha-subunit of the adaptor complex 2 (APA-2) as markers for sites of clathrin-mediated endocytosis; to the MAGUK, protein disks large (DLG-1) and cadherin (HMR-1), both of which label adherens junctions; to a cytoskeletal linker of the ezrin-radixin-moesin family (ERM-1), which localized to apical membranes; to an ERBIN family protein (LET-413) which localizes to the basolateral membrane of epithelial cells and to an adhesion molecule (SAX-7) which localizes to the plasma membrane at cell-cell contacts. In addition to working in whole mount immunocytochemistry, most of these antibodies work on western blots and thus should be of use for biochemical fractionation studies.
We have produced a set of monoclonal antibodies to subcellular components of the nematode C. elegans for the research community. These reagents are being made available through the Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank (DSHB).
The X-ray crystal structures of two glycosyltransferases (GTs)--beta 1,3-glucuronyltransferase 1 (GlcAT1) and alpha 1,4-N-acetylhexosaminyltransferase (EXTL2)--have now been determined in the presence of both donor and acceptor substrates. These enzymes are involved in glucosaminylglycan (GAG) synthesis where they catalyze inverting and retaining transfer reactions, respectively. As members of a large family of enzymes that transfer sugar groups from donor nucleotide-sugars to acceptor substrates, GlcAT1 and EXTL2 retain conserved GT folds. Comparative analysis of these structures reveals signature features for selecting specific donor sugars. Adaptive binding of the disaccharide moiety of the acceptor sugars enables the enzymes to catalyze either an inverting S(N)2-type displacement reaction or a retaining S(N)i-like transfer reaction.
We describe a large family with disproportionate short stature and bone dysplasia from Nias in which we observed differences in severity when comparing the phenotypes of affected individuals from two remote branches. We conducted a linkage scan in the more severely affected family branch and determined a critical interval of 4.7 cM on chromosome 11. Sequencing of the primary candidate gene TBX10 did not reveal a disease-causing variant. When performing whole exome sequencing we noticed a homozygous missense variant in B3GAT3, c.419C&gt;T [p.(Pro140Leu)]. B3GAT3 encodes β-1,3-glucuronyltransferase-I (GlcAT-I). GlcAT-I catalyzes an initial step of proteoglycan synthesis and the mutation p. (Pro140Leu) lies within the donor substrate-binding subdomain of the catalytic domain. In contrast to the previously published mutation in B3GAT3, c.830G&gt;A [p.(Arg277Gln)], no heart phenotype could be detected in our family. Functional studies revealed a markedly reduced GlcAT-I activity in lymphoblastoid cells from patients when compared to matched controls. Moreover, relative numbers of glycosaminoglycan (GAG) side chains were decreased in patient cells. We found that Pro140Leu-mutant GlcAT-I cannot efficiently transfer GlcA to the linker region trisaccharide. This failure results in a partial deficiency of both chondroitin sulfate and heparan sulfate chains. Since the phenotype of the Nias patients differs from the Larsen-like syndrome described for patients with mutation p.(Arg277Gln), we suggest mutation B3GAT3:p.(Pro140Leu) to cause a different type of GAG linkeropathy showing no involvement of the heart. 
Seedling de-etiolation (photomorphogenesis) is an important light-regulated developmental process in plants. Here, we showed that disruption of the gene encoding a glycosyltransferase-like protein, ABA INSENSITIVE 8 (ABI8)/ELONGATION EFFECTIVE 1 (ELD1)/KOBITO1 (KOB1), caused short-hypocotyl elongation under all light conditions examined and even in darkness. We found that the ABI8 transcript level was down-regulated by light in a phytochrome A-dependent manner. Furthermore, light destabilized ABI8 protein via the 26S proteasome degradation pathway. We showed that ABI8 promoted the expression of genes involved in cell elongation and cellulose synthesis. Consistently, the cellulose content was reduced in the abi8 mutants and application of 2, 6-dichlorobenzonitrile (an inhibitor of cellulose biosynthesis) mimicked the abi8 mutant phenotype. Moreover, we found that phytochrome and cryptochrome photoreceptors negatively, whereas CONSTITUTIVE PHOTOMORPHOGENIC 1 positively, regulated cellulose synthesis. We also showed that ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL 5 directly bound to the promoters of ABI8 and several cellulose synthesis genes and repressed their expression in light conditions. Taken together, our study reveals that ABI8 functions as a negative factor in light inhibition of hypocotyl elongation through modulating cellulose biosynthesis. 
Glycosyltransferases and glycoside hydrolases are two diversified groups of carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes) in existence, they serve to build and break down the glycosidic bonds, respectively, and both categories have formed many sequence-based families. In this study, a novel gene (glyt110) conferring β-galactosidase activity was obtained from a metagenomic library of Turpan Basin soil. Sequence analysis revealed that glyt110 encoded a protein of 369 amino acids that, rather than belonging to a family typically known for β-galactosidase activity, belonged to glycosyltransferase family 4. Because of this unusual sequence information, the novel gene glyt110 was subsequently expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3), and the recombinant enzyme (Glyt110) was purified and characterized. Biochemical characterization revealed that the β-galactosidase activity of Glyt110 toward o-nitrophenyl-β-D-galactopyranoside (ONPG) and lactose were identified to be 314±18.3 and 32±2.7 U/mg, correspondingly. In addition, Glyt110 can synthesize galacto-oligosaccharides (GOS) using lactose as substrate. A GOS yield of 47.2% (w/w) was achieved from 30% lactose solution at 50 °С, pH 8.0 after 10 h reaction. However, Glyt110 was unable to glycosylate either N-acetylated saccharides or lactose and galactose using UDP-gal as sugar donor, and its glycosyltransferase activity needs further investigation. These results indicated that Glyt110 is an unusual enzyme with β-galactosidase activity but phylogenetically related to glycosyltransferase. Our findings may provide opportunities to improve the insight into the relationship between glycosyltransferases and glycoside hydrolases and the sequence-based classification.
Individuals with Mowat-Wilson syndrome (MWS; OMIM#235730) have characteristic facial features, a variety of congenital anomalies such as Hirschsprung disease, and intellectual disabilities caused by mutation or deletion of ZEB2 gene. This deletion or cytogenetic abnormality has been reported primarily from Europe, Australia and the United States, but not in Korea. Here we report a patient with characteristic facial features of MWS, developmental delay and spasticity. High resolution microarray analysis revealed 0.9 Mb deletion of 2q22.3 involving two genes: ZEB2 and GTDC1. This case shows the important role of high resolution microarray in patients with unexplained psychomotor retardation and/or facial dysmorphism. Knowledge about the most striking clinical signs and implementation of effective molecular tests like microarray could significantly increase the detection rate of new cases of MWS in Korea. This is the first reported case of MWS in Korea.
Peters plus syndrome is a rare recessive autosomal disorder comprising ocular anterior segment dysgenesis, short stature, hand abnormalities and distinctive facial features. It was related only to mutations in the B3GALTL gene in the 13q12.3 region. In this study, we undertook the first functional analysis of a novel c.597-2 A&gt;G splicing mutation within the B3GALTL gene using an ex-vivo approach. The results showed a complete skipping of exon 8 in the B3GALTL cDNA, which altered the open reading frame of the mutant transcript and generated a PTC within exon 9. This finding potentially elicits the nonsense mRNA to degradation by NMD (nonsense-mediated mRNA decay). The theoretical consequences of splice site mutations, predicted with the bioinformatics tool Human Splice Finder, were investigated and evaluated in relation to ex-vivo results. The findings confirmed the key role played by the B3GALTL gene in typical Peters-plus syndromes and the utility of mRNA analysis to understand the primary impacts of this mutation and the phenotype of the disease. 
For normal fertilization in mammals, it is important that functionally mature sperm are motile and have a fully formed acrosome. The glycosyltransferase-like gene, human polypeptide N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase-like protein 5 (GALNTL5), belongs to the polypeptide N-acetylgalactosamine-transferase (pp-GalNAc-T) gene family because of its conserved glycosyltransferase domains, but it uniquely truncates the C-terminal domain and is expressed exclusively in human testis. However, glycosyltransferase activity of the human GALNTL5 protein has not been identified by in vitro assay thus far. Using mouse Galntl5 ortholog, we have examined whether GALNTL5 is a functional molecule in spermatogenesis. It was observed that mouse GALNTL5 localizes in the cytoplasm of round spermatids in the region around the acrosome of elongating spermatids, and finally in the neck region of spermatozoa. We attempted to establish Galntl5-deficient mutant mice to investigate the role of Galntl5 in spermiogenesis and found that the heterozygous mutation affected male fertility due to immotile sperm, which is diagnosed as asthenozoospermia, an infertility syndrome in humans. Furthermore, the heterozygous mutation of Galntl5 attenuated glycolytic enzymes required for motility, disrupted protein loading into acrosomes, and caused aberrant localization of the ubiquitin-proteasome system. By comparing the protein compositions of sperm from infertile males, we found a deletion mutation of the exon of human GALNTL5 gene in a patient with asthenozoospermia. This strongly suggests that the genetic mutation of human GALNTL5 results in male infertility with the reduction of sperm motility and that GALNTL5 is a functional molecule essential for mammalian sperm formation. 
The highly conserved H3 poxvirus protein is a major target of the human antibody response against poxviruses and is likely a key contributor to protection against infection. Here, we present the crystal structure of H3 from vaccinia virus at a 1.9-Å resolution. H3 looks like a glycosyltransferase, a family of enzymes that transfer carbohydrate molecules to a variety of acceptor substrates. Like glycosyltransferases, H3 binds UDP-glucose, as shown by saturation transfer difference (STD) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, and this binding requires Mg(2+) Mutation of the glycosyltransferase-like metal ion binding motif in H3 greatly diminished its binding to UDP-glucose. We found by flow cytometry that H3 binds to the surface of human cells but does not bind well to cells that are deficient in surface glycosaminoglycans. STD NMR experiments using a heparin sulfate decasaccharide confirmed that H3 binds heparin sulfate. We propose that a surface of H3 with an excess positive charge may be the binding site for heparin. Heparin binding and glycosyltransferase activity may be involved in the function of H3 in the poxvirus life cycle.
Poxviruses are under intense research because of bioterrorism concerns, zoonotic infections, and the side effects of existing smallpox vaccines. The smallpox vaccine using vaccinia virus has been highly successful, but it is still unclear why the vaccine is so effective. Studying the antigens that the immune system recognizes may allow a better understanding of how the vaccine elicits immunity and how improved vaccines can be developed. Poxvirus protein H3 is a major target of the immune system. The H3 crystal structure shows that it has a glycosyltransferase protein fold. We demonstrate that H3 binds the sugar nucleotide UDP-glucose, as do glycosyltransferases. Our experiments also reveal that H3 binds cell surface molecules that are involved in the attachment of poxviruses to cells. These structural and functional studies of H3 will help in designing better vaccines and therapeutics.
Anthocyanins generate the red color in the pericarp of Litchi chinensis. UDP-glucose: flavonoid 3-O-glycosyltransferase (UFGT, EC. 2.4.1.91) stabilizes anthocyanidin by attaching sugar moieties to the anthocyanin aglycone. In this study, the function of an UFGT gene involved in the biosynthesis of anthocyanin was verified through heterologous expression and virus-induced gene silencing assays. A strong positive correlation between UFGT activity and anthocyanin accumulation capacity was observed in the pericarp of 15 cultivars. Four putative flavonoid 3-O-glycosyltransferase-like genes, designated as LcUFGT1 to LcUFGT4, were identified in the pericarp of litchi. Among the four UFGT gene members, only LcUFGT1 can use cyanidin as its substrate. The expression of LcUFGT1 was parallel with developmental anthocyanin accumulation, and the heterologously expressed protein of LcUFGT1 displayed catalytic activities in the formation of anthocyanin. The LcUFGT1 over-expression tobacco had darker petals and pigmented filaments and calyxes resulting from higher anthocyanin accumulations compared with non-transformed tobacco. In the pericarp with LcUFGT1 suppressed by virus-induced gene silencing, pigmentation was retarded, which was well correlated with the reduced-LcUFGT1 transcriptional activity. These results suggested that the glycosylation-related gene LcUFGT1 plays a critical role in red color formation in the pericarp of litchi.
The pseudoglycosyltransferase (PsGT) VldE is a glycosyltransferase-like protein that is similar to trehalose 6-phosphate synthase (OtsA). However, in contrast to OtsA, which catalyzes condensation between UDP-glucose and glucose 6-phosphate, VldE couples two pseudosugars to give a product with an α,α-N-pseudoglycosidic linkage. Despite their unique catalytic activity and important role in the biosynthesis of natural products, little is known about the molecular basis governing their substrate specificity and catalysis. Here, we report comparative biochemical and kinetic studies using recombinant OtsA, VldE, and their chimeric proteins with a variety of sugar and pseudosugar substrates. We found that the chimeric enzymes can produce hybrid pseudo-(amino)disaccharides, and an amino group in the acceptor is necessary to facilitate a coupling reaction with a pseudosugar donor. Furthermore, we found that the N-terminal domains of the enzymes not only play a major role in selecting the acceptors, but also control the type of nucleotidyl diphosphate moiety of the donors. 
Dystroglycan (DG), composed of α and β subunits, belongs to the dystrophin-associated glycoprotein complex. α-DG is an extracellular matrix protein that undergoes a complex post-translational glycosylation process. The bifunctional glycosyltransferase like-acetylglucosaminyltransferase (LARGE) plays a crucial role in the maturation of α-DG, enabling its binding to laminin. We have already structurally analyzed the N-terminal region of murine α-DG (α-DG-Nt) and of a pathological single point mutant that may affect recognition of LARGE, although the structural features of the potential interaction between LARGE and DG remain elusive. We now report on the crystal structure of the wild-type human α-DG-Nt that has allowed us to assess the reliability of our murine crystallographic structure as a α-DG-Nt general model. Moreover, we address for the first time both structures in solution. Interestingly, small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) reveals the existence of two main protein conformations ensembles. The predominant species is reminiscent of the crystal structure, while the less populated one assumes a more extended fold. A comparative analysis of the human and murine α-DG-Nt solution structures reveals that the two proteins share a common interdomain flexibility and population distribution of the two conformers. This is confirmed by the very similar stability displayed by the two orthologs as assessed by biochemical and biophysical experiments. These results highlight the need to take into account the molecular plasticity of α-DG-Nt in solution, as it can play an important role in the functional interactions with other binding partners.
Pectins are a group of structurally complex plant cell wall polysaccharides whose biosynthesis and function remain poorly understood. The pectic polysaccharide rhamnogalacturonan-I (RG-I) has two types of arabinogalactan side chains, type-I and type-II arabinogalactans. To date few enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of pectin have been described. Here we report the identification of a highly conserved putative glycosyltransferase encoding gene, Pectic ArabinoGalactan synthesis-Related (PAGR), affecting the biosynthesis of RG-I arabinogalactans and critical for pollen tube growth.
T-DNA insertions in PAGR were identified in Arabidopsis thaliana and were found to segregate at a 1:1 ratio of heterozygotes to wild type. We were unable to isolate homozygous pagr mutants as pagr mutant alleles were not transmitted via pollen. In vitro pollen germination assays revealed reduced rates of pollen tube formation in pollen from pagr heterozygotes. To characterize a loss-of-function phenotype for PAGR, the Nicotiana benthamiana orthologs, NbPAGR-A and B, were transiently silenced using Virus Induced Gene Silencing. NbPAGR-silenced plants exhibited reduced internode and petiole expansion. Cell wall materials from NbPAGR-silenced plants had reduced galactose content compared to the control. Immunological and linkage analyses support that RG-I has reduced type-I arabinogalactan content and reduced branching of the RG-I backbone in NbPAGR-silenced plants. Arabidopsis lines overexpressing PAGR exhibit pleiotropic developmental phenotypes and the loss of apical dominance as well as an increase in RG-I type-II arabinogalactan content.
Together, results support a function for PAGR in the biosynthesis of RG-I arabinogalactans and illustrate the essential roles of these polysaccharides in vegetative and reproductive plant growth.
The nuclear receptors LXRalpha (NR1H3) and LXRbeta (NR1H2) are attractive drug targets for the treatment of diabetes and cardiovascular disease due to their established role as regulators of cholesterol and lipid metabolism. A large body of literature has recently indicated their important roles in glucose metabolism and particularly LXRbeta is important for proper insulin production in pancreas. In this study, we report that glucose induces transcription via the LXRB gene promoter. The transcription start site of the human LXRB gene was determined and we identified two highly conserved, and functional, ETS and Elk1 binding sites, respectively, in the LXRB gene promoter. The Elk1 binding site also bound the serum responsive factor (SRF). Mutation of these sites abolished binding. Furthermore, mutation of the binding sites or siRNA knockdown of SRF and Elk1 significantly reduced the promoter activity and impaired the glucose response. Our results indicate that the human LXRB gene is controlled by glucose, thereby providing a novel mechanism by which glucose regulates cellular functions via LXRbeta.
Research efforts focusing on metabolic diseases have established a close conjunction between glucolipid abnormalities and nuclear receptors, a large superfamily of receptors including classic peroxisome proliferation-activated receptors (PPARs), liver X receptors (LXRs), farnesoid X receptors (FXRs) and glucocorticoid receptors (GRs) together with burgeoning retinoic acid receptor-related orphan receptors (RORs) and REV-ERBs. Nuclear receptors are identified to control a series of physiological and pathological processes of glucose and lipid metabolism and also implicated to mediate the long-term effects of early environmental and nutritional experiences on the formation of adult chronic metabolic disorders in human and animals. Thus, nuclear receptors play profound roles in fetal programming and adult regulation of glucolipid metabolism. In this review, we provide an overview on the recent advances in the field of nuclear receptors focusing on their roles in lipid and glucose metabolism during early and late life courses. We hope that this knowledge may shed new lights on identifying the novel target molecules or pathways for the prevention and treatment of metabolic disorders involving disrupted glucose and lipid homeostasis in human and animals.
The intracellular concentration of the mitogen phosphatidic acid (PA) must be maintained at low levels until the need arises for cell proliferation. How temporal and spatial trafficking of PA affects its target proteins in the different cellular compartments is not fully understood. We report that in cancer cells, PA cycles back and forth from the cellular membrane to the nucleus, affecting the function of epidermal growth factor (EGF), in a process that involves PPARα/LXRα signaling. Upon binding to its ligand, EGF receptor (EGFR)-initiated activation of phospholipase D (PLD) causes a spike in intracellular PA production that forms vesicles transporting EGFR from early endosomes (EEA1 marker) and prolonged internalization in late endosomes and Golgi (RCAS marker). Cells incubated with fluorescent-labeled PA (NBD-PA) show PA in "diffuse" locations throughout the cytoplasm, punctae (small, &lt;0.1 μm) vesicles) and large (&gt;0.5 μm) vesicles that co-localize with EGFR. We also report that PPARα/LXRα form heterodimers that bind to new Responsive Elements (RE) in the EGFR promoter. Nuclear PA enhances EGFR expression, a role compatible with the mitogenic ability of the phospholipid. Newly made EGFR is packaged into PA recycling vesicles (Rab11 marker) and transported back to the cytoplasm and plasma membrane. However, a PLD+PA combination impedes binding of PPARα/LXRα to the EGFR promoter. Thus, if PA levels inside the nucleus reach a certain threshold (&gt;100 nM) PA outcompetes the nuclear receptors and transcription is inhibited. This new signaling function of PLD-PA targeting EGFR trafficking and biphasically modulating its transcription, could explain cell proliferation initiation and its maintenance in cancer cells.
Liver X receptor (LXR), a nuclear hormone receptor, is an essential regulator of immune responses. Activation of LXR-mediated transcription by synthetic agonists, such as T0901317 and GW3965, attenuates progression of inflammatory disease in animal models. However, the adverse effects of these conventional LXR agonists in elevating liver lipids have impeded exploitation of this intriguing mechanism for chronic therapy. Here, we explore the ability of a series of sterol-based LXR agonists to alleviate inflammatory conditions in mice without hepatotoxicity. We show that oral treatment with sterol-based LXR agonists in mice significantly reduces dextran sulfate sodium colitis-induced body weight loss, which is accompanied by reduced expression of inflammatory markers in the large intestine. The anti-inflammatory property of these agonists is recapitulated in vitro in mouse lamina propria mononuclear cells, human colonic epithelial cells, and human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. In addition, treatment with LXR agonists dramatically suppresses inflammatory cytokine expression in a model of traumatic brain injury. Importantly, in both disease models, the sterol-based agonists do not affect the liver, and the conventional agonist T0901317 results in significant liver lipid accumulation and injury. Overall, these results provide evidence for the development of sterol-based LXR agonists as novel therapeutics for chronic inflammatory diseases.-Yu, S., Li, S., Henke, A., Muse, E. D., Cheng, B., Welzel, G., Chatterjee, A. K., Wang, D., Roland, J., Glass, C. K., Tremblay, M. Dissociated sterol-based liver X receptor agonists as therapeutics for chronic inflammatory diseases.
Liver X Receptors (LXRs) α and β are nuclear receptors able to bind oxidative forms of cholesterol. They play important roles in the central nervous system (CNS), through their implication in a large variety of physiological and pathological processes among which modulation of cholesterol homeostasis and inflammation. Besides, we recently revealed their crucial role in myelination and remyelination in the cerebellum. Given the pleiotropic effects of such receptors on CNS functioning, we studied here the influence of LXRs on myelin gene mRNA accumulation in the major myelinated regions of the CNS in vivo. We show that both LXR isoforms differentially affect mRNA amount of myelin genes (PLP and MBP) in highly myelinated structures such as spinal cord, corpus callosum, optic nerve and cerebellum. In the adult, LXR activation by the synthetic agonist TO901317 significantly increases myelin gene mRNA amount in the cerebellum but not in the other regions studied. Invalidation of the sole LXRβ isoform leads to decreased PLP and MBP mRNA levels in all the structures except the spinal cord, while the knock out of both isoforms (LXR dKO) decreases myelin gene mRNA amounts in all the regions tested except the corpus callosum. Interestingly, during myelination process (post-natal day 21), both cerebellum and optic nerve display a decrease in myelin gene mRNA levels in LXR dKO mice. Concomitantly, PLP and MBP mRNA accumulation in the spinal cord is increased. Relative expression level of LXR isoforms could account for the differential modulation of myelin gene expression in the CNS. Altogether our results suggest that, within the CNS, each LXR isoform differentially influences myelin gene mRNA levels in a region- and age-dependant manner, participating in the fine regulation of myelin gene expression.
Liver X receptors (LXRs) are master regulators of cholesterol homeostasis and inflammation in the central nervous system (CNS). The brain, which contains a disproportionately large amount of the body's total cholesterol (∼25%), requires a complex and delicately balanced cholesterol metabolism to maintain neuronal function. Dysregulation of cholesterol metabolism has been implicated in numerous neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and Huntington's disease (HD). Due to their cholesterol-sensing and anti-inflammatory activities, LXRs are positioned centrally in the everyday maintenance of CNS function. This review focuses on recent research into the role of LXRs in the CNS during normal development and homeostasis and in disease states.
The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) has a pivotal role in the maintenance of extracellular volume homeostasis and blood pressure through complex mechanisms. Apart from the well known systemic RAS, occurrence of a local RAS has been documented in multiple tissues, including the kidney. A large body of recent evidence from pharmacologic and genetic studies, particularly those using various transgenic approaches to manipulate intrarenal levels of RAS components, has established the important role of intrarenal RAS in hypertension. Recent studies have also begun to unravel the molecular mechanisms that govern intrarenal RAS activity. This local system is under the control of complex regulatory networks consisting of positive regulators of (pro)renin receptor, Wnt/β-catenin signaling, and PGE2/PGE2 receptor EP4 subtype, and negative regulators of Klotho, vitamin D receptor, and liver X receptors. This review highlights recent advances in defining the regulation and function of intrarenal RAS as a unique entity separate from systemic angiotensin II generation.
Specific spontaneous heritable neurodegenerative diseases have been associated with lower serum and cerebrospinal fluid α-tocopherol (α-TOH) concentrations. Equine neuroaxonal dystrophy (eNAD) has similar histologic lesions to human ataxia with vitamin E deficiency caused by mutations in the α-TOH transfer protein gene (TTPA). Mutations in TTPA are not present with eNAD and the molecular basis remains unknown. Given the neuropathologic phenotypic similarity of the conditions, we assessed the molecular basis of eNAD by global transcriptome sequencing of the cervical spinal cord. Differential gene expression analysis identified 157 significantly (FDR&lt;0.05) dysregulated transcripts within the spinal cord of eNAD-affected horses. Statistical enrichment analysis identified significant downregulation of the ionotropic and metabotropic group III glutamate receptor, synaptic vesicle trafficking and cholesterol biosynthesis pathways. Gene co-expression analysis identified one module of upregulated genes significantly associated with the eNAD phenotype that included the liver X receptor (LXR) targets CYP7A1, APOE, PLTP and ABCA1. Validation of CYP7A1 and APOE dysregulation was performed in an independent biologic group and CYP7A1 was found to be additionally upregulated in the medulla oblongata of eNAD horses. Evidence of LXR activation supports a role for modulation of oxysterol-dependent LXR transcription factor activity by tocopherols. We hypothesize that the protective role of α-TOH in eNAD may reside in its ability to prevent oxysterol accumulation and subsequent activation of the LXR in order to decrease lipid peroxidation associated neurodegeneration.
A very large number of fatty acids play wide range of physiological roles in cellular growth and function in placental as well as fetal growth. However, docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), in addition to its critical role in cellular membranes, is known to act as a ligand for several nuclear receptors and regulates the activity of transcription factor families like peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor, liver X receptor (LXR), retinoid X receptor (RXR), and sterol regulatory element binding protein (SREBP). These transcription factors and DHA are known to regulate the placental and fetal growth and development.
The objective of the present study was to examine the fatty acids and transcription factors in the placenta of women delivering low birth weight (LBW) babies.
The present study examines the fatty acid and mRNA levels of various transcription factors in the placentae of women delivering normal birth weight (NBW) (n = 38) and women delivering LBW (n = 36). Placental fatty acids were analyzed using gas chromatography. Placental mRNA levels of PPARα, PPARγ, SREBP-1c, LXRα, RXRα, and RXRγ were examined using quantitative real time PCR.
Placental DHA levels and mRNA levels of placental PPARγ and LXRα were lower (P &lt; .05 for all) in women delivering LBW babies. There was a positive association of placental PPARγ mRNA levels and placental DHA levels with baby weight (P &lt; .05 for both).
Our data suggest that lower placental DHA and transcription factors may have a vital role in the etiology of LBW babies.
Atherosclerosis is the underlying etiology of cardiovascular disease, the leading cause of death worldwide. Atherosclerosis is a heterogeneous disease in which only a small fraction of lesions lead to heart attack, stroke, or sudden cardiac death. A distinct type of plaque containing large necrotic cores with thin fibrous caps often precipitates these acute events. Here, we show that Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase γ (CaMKIIγ) in macrophages plays a major role in the development of necrotic, thin-capped plaques. Macrophages in necrotic and symptomatic atherosclerotic plaques in humans as well as advanced atherosclerotic lesions in mice demonstrated activation of CaMKII. Western diet-fed LDL receptor-deficient (Ldlr-/-) mice with myeloid-specific deletion of CaMKII had smaller necrotic cores with concomitantly thicker collagen caps. These lesions demonstrated evidence of enhanced efferocytosis, which was associated with increased expression of the macrophage efferocytosis receptor MerTK. Mechanistic studies revealed that CaMKIIγ-deficient macrophages and atherosclerotic lesions lacking myeloid CaMKIIγ had increased expression of the transcription factor ATF6. We determined that ATF6 induces liver X receptor-α (LXRα), an Mertk-inducing transcription factor, and that increased MerTK expression and efferocytosis in CaMKIIγ-deficient macrophages is dependent on LXRα. These findings identify a macrophage CaMKIIγ/ATF6/LXRα/MerTK pathway as a key factor in the development of necrotic atherosclerotic plaques.
Pregnane X receptor (PXR) mainly regulates xenobiotic metabolism and detoxification. Additionally, it exerts pleiotropic effects on liver physiology, which in large parts depend on transrepression of other liver-enriched transcription factors. Based on the hypothesis that lower expression levels of PXR may reduce the extent of this inhibition, an exploratory genome-wide transcriptomic profiling was performed using HepG2 cell clones with different expression levels of PXR. This screen and confirmatory real-time RT-PCR identified sphingomyelin phosphodiesterase acid-like (SMPDL) 3A, a novel nucleotide phosphodiesterase and phosphoramidase, as being up-regulated by PXR-deficiency. Transient siRNA-mediated knock-down of PXR in HepG2 cells and primary human hepatocytes similarly induced mRNA up-regulation, which translated into increased intracellular and secreted extracellular protein levels. Interestingly, ligand-dependent PXR activation also induced SMPDL3A in HepG2 cells and primary human hepatocytes. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays and chromatin immunoprecipitation demonstrated binding of PXR to the previously identified liver X receptor (LXR)-binding DR4 motif as well as to an adjacent ER8 motif in intron 1 of SMPDL3A. Constitutive binding of the unliganded receptor to the intron 1 chromatin indicated ligand-independent repression of SMPDL3A by PXR. Transient transfection and reporter gene analysis confirmed the specific role of these motifs in PXR- and LXR-dependent activation of the SMPDL3A intronic enhancer. PXR inhibited LXR mainly by competition for binding sites. In conclusion, this study describes that a decrease in PXR expression levels and ligand-dependent activation of PXR and LXR increase hepatic SMPDL3A levels, which possibly connects these receptors to hepatic purinergic signaling and phospholipid metabolism and may result in drug-drug interactions with phosphoramidate pro-drugs.
Expression of mRNA encoding sterol regulatory element binding protein (SREBP) isoforms (SREBP-1a, -1c, -2) and seven SREBP target genes decreased dramatically as a result of isolation and subsequent culture of primary rat hepatocytes. In standard maintenance medium (MM) expression remained low but when cultured in HepatoZYME (HZM), there was a selective increase in mRNA encoding SREBP-2 and a subset of SREBP target genes, a group characterised by promoters containing adjacent sterol regulatory element and nuclear factor Y (NF-Y) binding sequences. Quantification of all three NF-Y transcripts showed that expression of nuclear factor Y alpha subunit and nuclear factor Y beta subunit mRNA increased during culture in HZM (in contrast to the situation with MM) whilst specificity protein 1, liver-x-receptor and hepatocyte nuclear factor-4 alpha mRNA exhibited equivalent decreased expression in both HZM and MM. Our data indicate that HZM exerts a selective preservation of hepatocyte phenotype through actions on NF-Y expression directly or via an effect secondary to actions on SREBP-2 expression. These data add to the molecular dissection of the causes of hepatocyte dedifferentiation during culture and address means to develop approaches to prevent/limit phenotype change.
AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is an intracellular fuel sensor that plays a key role in regulating fatty acid synthesis in liver. Sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP)-1c is a master regulator of hepatic lipogenic gene expression. It has long been documented that AMPK activation suppresses hepatic SREBP-1 mRNA and nuclear SREBP-1 protein. But the mechanism remains undefined. In this study we investigated the molecular mechanisms by which AMPK downregulates hepatic SREBP-1c mRNA using a novel model cell line McA-RH7777. We found that AMPK is robustly activated in rat hepatoma McA-RH7777 cells treated with two widely used AMPK activators, AICAR and metformin, and AMPK activation sharply suppresses SREBP-1c mRNA and nuclear SREBP-1c protein, but not SREBP-1a mRNA derived from the same gene. These inhibitory effects are reversed by the AMPK inhibitor Compound C or 8-BrAMP, demonstrating the requirement of AMPK in the suppression of SREBP-1c mRNA and nuclear SREBP-1c protein by AICAR and metformin. AMPK does not enhance SREBP-1c mRNA degradation in the presence of the general transcription inhibitor actinomycin D; instead it inhibits SREBP-1c promoter activity in a luciferase reporter assay. AMPK-mediated inhibition of SREBP-1c promoter activity can also be abrogated by the AMPK inhibitor Compound C. Furthermore AMPK activation significantly attenuates the synthetic liver X receptor (LXR) ligand T0901317-induced SREBP-1c promoter activity. AMPK also inhibits cleavage of LXR ligand-induced SREBP-1c precursor. We conclude that AMPK suppresses hepatic SREBP-1c mRNA expression by inhibiting LXR-dependent SREBP-1c transcription via inhibition of endogenous LXR ligand production and by inhibiting SREBP-1c processing in McA-RH7777 cells.
Macrophages play a central role in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis by accumulating cholesterol through increased uptake of oxidized low-density lipoproteins by scavenger receptor CD36, leading to foam cell formation. Here we demonstrate the ability of hexarelin, a GH-releasing peptide, to enhance the expression of ATP-binding cassette A1 and G1 transporters and cholesterol efflux in macrophages. These effects were associated with a transcriptional activation of nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)gamma in response to binding of hexarelin to CD36 and GH secretagogue-receptor 1a, the receptor for ghrelin. The hormone binding domain was not required to mediate PPARgamma activation by hexarelin, and phosphorylation of PPARgamma was increased in THP-1 macrophages treated with hexarelin, suggesting that the response to hexarelin may involve PPARgamma activation function-1 activity. However, the activation of PPARgamma by hexarelin did not lead to an increase in CD36 expression, as opposed to liver X receptor (LXR)alpha, suggesting a differential regulation of PPARgamma-targeted genes in response to hexarelin. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays showed that, in contrast to a PPARgamma agonist, the occupancy of the CD36 promoter by PPARgamma was not increased in THP-1 macrophages treated with hexarelin, whereas the LXRalpha promoter was strongly occupied by PPARgamma in the same conditions. Treatment of apolipoprotein E-null mice maintained on a lipid-rich diet with hexarelin resulted in a significant reduction in atherosclerotic lesions, concomitant with an enhanced expression of PPARgamma and LXRalpha target genes in peritoneal macrophages. The response was strongly impaired in PPARgamma(+/-) macrophages, indicating that PPARgamma was required to mediate the effect of hexarelin. These findings provide a novel mechanism by which the beneficial regulation of PPARgamma and cholesterol metabolism in macrophages could be regulated by CD36 and ghrelin receptor downstream effects.
In the present study, we aimed to decipher the mechanisms involved in the transcriptional effect of insulin on the SREBP-1c specific promoter of the human srebf-1 gene. Using luciferase reporter gene constructs in HEK-293 cells (human embryonic kidney cells), we demonstrated that the full effect of insulin requires the presence of SREs (sterol response elements) in the proximal region of the promoter. Furthermore, insulin increases the binding of SREBP-1 (sterol-regulatory-element-binding protein-1) to this promoter region in chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. We also found that the nuclear receptors LXRs (liver X receptors) strongly activate SREBP-1c gene expression and identified the LXRE (LXR-response element) involved in this effect. However, our results suggested that these LXREs do not play a major role in the response to insulin. Finally, using expression vectors and adenoviruses allowing ectopic overexpressions of the human mature forms of SREBP-1a or SREBP-1c, we demonstrated the direct role of SREBP-1 in the control of SREBP-1c gene expression in human skeletal-muscle cells. Altogether, these results strongly suggest that the SREBP-1 transcription factors are the main mediators of insulin action on SREBP-1c expression in human tissues.
Low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) mutations cause familial hypercholesterolemia and early atherosclerosis. ABCA1 facilitates free cholesterol efflux from peripheral tissues. We investigated the effects of LDLR deletion (LDLR(-/-)) on ABCA1 expression. LDLR(-/-) macrophages had reduced basal levels of ABCA1, ABCG1, and cholesterol efflux. A high fat diet increased cholesterol in LDLR(-/-) macrophages but not wild type cells. A liver X receptor (LXR) agonist induced expression of ABCA1, ABCG1, and cholesterol efflux in both LDLR(-/-) and wild type macrophages, whereas expression of LXRalpha or LXRbeta was similar. Interestingly, oxidized LDL induced more ABCA1 in wild type macrophages than LDLR(-/-) cells. LDL induced ABCA1 expression in wild type cells but inhibited it in LDLR(-/-) macrophages in a concentration-dependent manner. However, lipoproteins regulated ABCG1 expression similarly in LDLR(-/-) and wild type macrophages. Cholesterol or oxysterols induced ABCA1 expression in wild type macrophages but had little or inhibitory effects on ABCA1 expression in LDLR(-/-) macrophages. Active sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1a (SREBP1a) inhibited ABCA1 promoter activity in an LXRE-dependent manner and decreased both macrophage ABCA1 expression and cholesterol efflux. Expression of ABCA1 in animal tissues was inversely correlated to active SREBP1. Oxysterols inactivated SREBP1 in wild type macrophages but not in LDLR(-/-) cells. Oxysterol synergized with nonsteroid LXR ligand induced ABCA1 expression in wild type macrophages but blocked induction in LDLR(-/-) cells. Taken together, our studies suggest that LDLR is critical in the regulation of cholesterol efflux and ABCA1 expression in macrophage. Lack of the LDLR impairs sterol-induced macrophage ABCA1 expression by a sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1-dependent mechanism that can result in reduced cholesterol efflux and lipid accumulation in macrophages under hypercholesterolemic conditions.
The aim of this study was to analyze the expression patterns of key genes involved in lipid metabolism in response to feeding in chicks. A total of 18 thirteen day-old male chicks were fasted for 12h. The mRNA levels of the genes in the liver and white adipose tissue were analyzed after 0, 2, and 4h of refeeding. The mRNA levels of sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP) 1, liver X receptor α, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) γ, acetyl-CoA carboxylase α and fatty acid synthase were significantly increased after 2h of refeeding. In contrast, the mRNA levels of PPARα and carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1a were significantly decreased after 2h of refeeding. The mRNA level of acyl-CoA oxidase was significantly decreased after 4h of refeeding. The mRNA levels of cholesterol metabolism-related genes such as SREBP2 and 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase were significantly increased after 2h of refeeding. In the white adipose tissue, the mRNA level of PPARγ was significantly increased after 2h of refeeding, whereas the mRNA level of adipose triglyceride lipase was significantly decreased after 4h of refeeding. These results demonstrated that expression of lipid metabolism-related genes is regulated by short-term refeeding in chicks. 
The polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a complex endocrine-metabolic disorder consisting of reproductive disturbances associated with all aspects of the metabolic syndrome and genetic components in the pathology of this complex disease is very likely. Accordingly, variations in single genes might affect specific features of PCOS and thereby help to define different subgroups. SREBP-1 or LXRα have been shown to be genetically linked to lipid metabolism or insulin sensitivity. As these are two major aspects of the PCOS phenotype, we evaluated both genes in a cohort of 153 PCOS patients. Analyses of both genes revealed in SREBF-1, i.e. SREBP-1a and SREBP-1c, not any variation and in the LXRα gene no novel sequence variations. Common variants of LXRα (rs2279238:G; all:0.8658; PCOS:0.8627; controls: 0.8686 or A: all:0.13412; PCOS:0.1373; controls:0.1314; (OR (95% CI) 0.9508 (0.4226-2.1385); rs11039155: G: all:0.8767; PCOS:0.8663; controls:0.8857 and A all:0.1233; PCOS:0.1337; controls:0.1143; (OR (95% CI) 0.8383 (0.3618-1.9371)) were also not directly associated to PCOS. Combined analyses of both polymorphism revealed that there was no difference of distribution between the groups. In contrast, analyses of the impact of these polymorphisms on metabolic parameters of the syndrome indicated significant differences related to genotypes. The data indicated that rs11039155 increases metabolic risk, whereas rs2279238 has a protective effect on the overall metabolic risk. The investigation of the PCOS group presented indicates that the combined analyses of variations in putative candidate genes allowed a genotype-phenotype correlation for metabolic features.
Sterol regulatory element binding proteins (SREBP) are a family of transcription factors that regulate cholesterogenesis and lipogenesis. Sterol regulatory element binding proteins-1a and -1c are transcribed from the same gene by the use of alternate promoters, and only differ at their first exon. Sterol regulatory element binding protein-1c is hypothesized to be an important regulator of genes involved in milk fat synthesis in the lactating dairy cow. However, the bovine SREBP-1c promoter has not been previously characterized, and studies to date that have investigated the role of SREBP-1 in the bovine mammary gland have not distinguished between isoforms 1a and 1c. The purpose of this study was to characterize the bovine SREBP-1c promoter and to investigate the DNA elements involved in the regulation of SREBP-1c expression by the liver X receptor agonist T0901317 in 2 different bovine mammary epithelial cell lines. Luciferase reporter constructs containing the wild-type SREBP-1c promoter or constructs with mutated liver X receptor response elements or sterol response element were transfected into MacT cells and bovine mammary epithelial (BME-UV) cells. We have demonstrated that the liver X receptor response elements sites in the SREBP-1c promoter are necessary for mediating the T0901317 response, and that stimulation through the sterol response element site plays only a minor role in this pathway. This report describes the bovine SREBP-1c promoter and its regulation by liver X receptor in bovine mammary epithelial cells.
The oxysterol 27-Hydroxycholesterol (27-OHC) is a major cholesterol metabolite that can cross the blood brain barrier (BBB) from peripheral circulation to the brain. Currently, the role of 27-OHC on cholesterol homeostasis in astrocytes and the underlying mechanisms are not defined. Since all brain cholesterol is essentially synthesized in brain itself and astrocytes as net producers of cholesterol are essential for normal brain function, here we investigated the effects of 27-OHC on cholesterol synthesis and transport in C6 glioma cells. C6 cells were treated with 5, 10 and 20μM 27-OHC for 24h and the cell viability and apoptosis, the cholesterol levels and metabolism-related mediators, genes and proteins were subsequently assessed using cell-counting kit (CCK)-8, Amplex red, ELISA, real-time PCR and Western blot, respectively. We found that 27-OHC decreased cholesterol levels by down-regulating the expression of sterol-regulated element binding protein-1 (SREBP-1a), 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase (HMG-CR) and low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) and promoted cholesterol transport by up-regulating the expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors-γ (PPAR-γ), liver X receptor-α (LXR-α), ATP-binding cassette transporter protein family member A1 (ABCA1) and apolipoprotein E (ApoE)genes. Our results suggested that 27-OHC may represent a sensitive modulator of cholesterol metabolism disorder by suppressing cholesterol synthesis and stimulating cholesterol transport in astrocytes.
Sterol regulatory element binding protein-1 (SREBP-1) is a key transcription factor that regulates lipogenesis in rodent liver. Two isoforms (SREBP-1a and SREBP-1c) of SREBP-1 are transcribed by an alternative promoter on the same gene (SREBF1), and the isoforms differ only in their first exon. Although the regulatory effects of SREBP-1 on lipid and milk fat synthesis have received much attention in ruminants, SREBP-1c promoter and its regulatory mechanisms have not been characterized in the goat. In the present study, we cloned and sequenced a 2,012-bp fragment of the SREBP-1c 5'-flanking region from goat genomic DNA. A luciferase reporter assay revealed that SREBP-1c is transcriptionally activated by the liver X receptor α (LXRα) agonist T0901317, and is decreased by SREBP-1 small interfering (si)RNA. A 5' deletion analysis revealed a core promoter region located -395 to +1 bp upstream of the transcriptional start site (TSS). Site-directed mutagenesis of LXRα binding elements (LXRE1 and LXRE2) and sterol regulatory elements (SRE1 and SRE2) revealed that the full effects of T 4506585 require the presence of both LXRE and SRE. We also characterized a new SRE (SRE1) and demonstrated a direct role of SREBP-1 (auto-loop regulation) in maintaining its basal transcription activity. Results suggest that goat SREBP-1c gene is transcriptionally regulated by mature SREBP-1 (auto-loop circuit regulation) and LXRα in goat mammary epithelial cells. 
CYP2B6 plays an increasingly important role in xenobiotic metabolism and detoxification. The constitutive androstane receptor (CAR) and the pregnane X receptor (PXR) have been established as predominant regulators for the inductive expression of CYP2B6 gene in human liver. However, there are dramatic interindividual variabilities in CYP2B6 expression that cannot be fully explained by the CAR/PXR-based modulation alone. Here, we show that expression level of CYP2B6 was correlated with that of hepatocyte nuclear factor 3β (HNF3β) in human primary hepatocytes prepared from 35 liver donors. Utilizing recombinant virus-mediated overexpression or knockdown of HNF3β in HepG2 cells, as well as constructs containing serial deletion and site-directed mutation of HNF3β binding motifs in CYP2B6 luciferase reporter assays, we demonstrated that the presence or lack of HNF3β expression markedly correlated with CYP2B6 gene expression and its promoter activity. Novel enhancer modules of HNF3β located upstream of the CYP2B6 gene transcription start site were identified and functionally validated as key elements governing HNF3β-mediated CYP2B6 expression. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays in human primary hepatocytes and surface plasmon resonance binding affinity experiments confirmed the essential role of these enhancers in the recruitment of HNF3β to the promoter of CYP2B6 gene. Overall, these findings indicate that HNF3β represents a new liver enriched transcription factor that is involved in the transcription of CYP2B6 gene and contributes to the large interindividual variations of CYP2B6 expression in human population. 
It is known that 1) elevated serum bile acids (BAs) are associated with decreased body weight, 2) elevated glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) levels can decrease body weight, and 3) germ-free (GF) mice are resistant to diet-induced obesity. The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that a lack of intestinal microbiota results in more BAs in the body, resulting in increased BA-mediated transmembrane G protein-coupled receptor 5 (TGR5) signaling and increased serum GLP-1 as a mechanism of resistance of GF mice to diet-induced obesity. GF mice had 2- to 4-fold increased total BAs in the serum, liver, bile, and ileum. Fecal excretion of BAs was 63% less in GF mice. GF mice had decreased secondary BAs and increased taurine-conjugated BAs, as anticipated. Surprisingly, there was an increase in non-12α-OH BAs, namely, β-muricholic acid, ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA), and their taurine conjugates, in GF mice. Further, in vitro experiments confirmed that UDCA is a primary BA in mice. There were minimal changes in the mRNA of farnesoid X receptor target genes in the ileum (Fibroblast growth factor 15, small heterodimer protein, and ileal bile acid-binding protein), in the liver (small heterodimer protein, liver receptor homolog-1, and cytochrome P450 7a1), and BA transporters (apical sodium dependent bile acid transporter, organic solute transporter α, and organic solute transporter β) in the ileum of GF mice. Surprisingly, there were marked increases in BA transporters in the large intestine. Increased GLP-1 levels and gallbladder size were observed in GF mice, suggesting activation of TGR5 signaling. In summary, the GF condition results in increased expression of BA transporters in the colon, resulting in 1) an increase in total BA concentrations in tissues, 2) a change in BA composition to favor an increase in non-12α-OH BAs, and 3) activation of TGR5 signaling with increased gallbladder size and GLP-1.
All-trans retinoic acid (RA) is a potent inducer of regeneration. Because the liver is the principal site for storage and bioactivation of vitamin A, the current study examines the effect of RA in mouse hepatocyte proliferation and liver regeneration. Mice that received a single dose of RA (25μg/g) by oral gavage developed hepatomegaly with increased number of Ki67-positive cells and induced expression of cell cycle genes in the liver. DNA binding data revealed that RA receptors retinoic acid receptor β (RARβ) and retinoid x receptor α (RXRα) bound to cell cycle genes Cdk1, Cdk2, Cyclin B, Cyclin E, and Cdc25a in mice with and without RA treatment. In addition, RA treatment induced novel binding of RARβ/RXRα to Cdk1, Cdk2, Cyclin D, and Cdk6 genes. All RARβ/RXRα binding sites contained AGGTCA-like motifs. RA treatment also promoted liver regeneration after partial hepatectomy (PH). RA signaling was implicated in normal liver regeneration as the mRNA levels of RARβ, Aldh1a2, Crabp1, and Crbp1 were all induced 1.5 days after PH during the active phase of hepatocyte proliferation. RA treatment prior to PH resulted in early up-regulation of RARβ, Aldh1a2, Crabp1, and Crbp1, which was accompanied by an early induction of cell cycle genes. Western blotting for RARβ, c-myc, Cyclin D, E, and A further supported the early induction of retinoid signal and cell proliferation by RA treatment. Taken together, our data suggest that RA may regulate cell cycle progression and accelerates liver regeneration. Such effect is associated with an early induction of RA signaling, which includes increased expression of the receptor, binding proteins, and processing enzyme for retinoids. 
In diabetic mellitus, apoptotic or necrotic deaths of pancreatic β-cells lead to insulin deficiency because plasma insulin is synthesized and released from pancreatic β-cells and involved with blood glucose homeostasis. Since estrogen receptors have been related with glucose metabolis, estrogen-like chemicals (xenoestrogens) including bisphenol A (BPA) and octylphenol (OP) alter the endocrine system, and cause adverse health consequences such as obesity and diabetes. In the current study, levels of plasma glucose were evaluated after administration of BPA and OP using biochemical analysis, and were investigated in insulin and insulin synthesis-related genes in the pancreas and liver of streptozotocin (STZ)-induced insulin-deficient mice. Although the STZ-induced insulin-deficient groups showed an increase in blood glucose compared with control groups, the induced blood glucose level dropped to that of baseline after administration of xenoestrogens. When insulin level and mRNA expression of insulin transcriptional regulators (Pdx1, Mafa, and Neurod1) in pancreatic β-cells were decreased in STZ-induced insulin-deficient groups, they were significantly restored by administration of xenoestrogens. The latter observation is also related to NF-κB activation for anti-apoptosis effects in pancreatic β-cells. In addition, we observed a complementary convergence in regulation of gluconeogenesis for determination of blood glucose levels. Therefore, the current study may be particularly important for assessment of xenoestrogens under condition of diabetic mellitus or metabolic disorder. 
Previous data demonstrate that bexarotene (Bex), retinoid X receptor (RXR) agonist, reduces soluble and insoluble amyloid-β (Aβ) in Alzheimer disease (AD)-transgenic mice either by increasing the levels of mouse apolipoprotein E (apoE) or increasing ABCA1/ABCG1-induced apoE lipoprotein association/lipidation. However, although the mechanism of action of RXR agonists remains unclear, a major concern for their use is human (h)-APOE4, the greatest AD genetic risk factor. If APOE4 imparts a toxic gain-of-function, then increasing apoE4 may increase soluble Aβ, likely the proximal AD neurotoxin. If the APOE4 loss-of-function is lipidation of apoE4, then induction of ABCA1/ABCG1 may be beneficial. In novel EFAD-Tg mice (overexpressing h-Aβ42 with h-APOE), levels of soluble Aβ (Aβ42 and oligomeric Aβ) are highest in E4FAD hippocampus (HP) &gt; E3FAD-HP &gt; E4FAD cortex (CX) &gt; E3FAD-CX, whereas levels of lipoprotein-associated/lipidated apoE have the opposite pattern (6 months). In E4FAD-HP, short-term RXR agonist treatment (Bex or LG100268; 5.75-6 months) increased ABCA1, apoE4 lipoprotein-association/lipidation, and apoE4/Aβ complex, decreased soluble Aβ, and increased PSD95. In addition, hydrogel delivery, which mimics low sustained release, was equally effective as gavage for Bex and LG100268. RXR agonists induced no beneficial effects in the E4FAD-HP in a prevention protocol (5-6 months) and actually increased soluble Aβ levels in E3FAD-CX and E4FAD-CX with the short-term protocol, possibly the result of systemic hepatomegaly. Thus, RXR agonists address the loss-of-function associated with APOE4 and exacerbated by Aβ pathology, i.e. low levels of apoE4 lipoprotein association/lipidation. Further studies are vital to address whether RXR agonists are an APOE4-specific AD therapeutic and the systemic side effects that limit translational application. 
Liver X receptors (LXR) are deemed as potential drug targets for atherosclerosis, whereas a role in adipose tissue expansion and its relation to insulin sensitivity remains unclear. To assess the metabolic effects of LXR activation by the dual LXRα/β agonist T0901317, C57BL/6 mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD) were treated with T0901317 (30 mg/kg once daily by intraperitoneal injection) for 3 weeks. Differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes were used for analysing the effect of T0901317 on glucose uptake. The following results were obtained from this study. T0901317 reduced fat mass, accompanied by a massive fatty liver and lower serum adipokine levels in HFD mice. Increased adipocyte apoptosis was found in epididymal fat of T0901317-treated HFD mice. In addition, T0901317 treatment promoted basal lipolysis, but blunted the anti-lipolytic action of insulin. Furthermore, LXR activation antagonised PPARγ target genes in epididymal fat and PPARγ-PPRE-binding activity in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Although the glucose tolerance was comparable to that in HFD mice, the insulin response during IPGTT was significantly higher and the insulin tolerance was significantly impaired in T0901317-treated HFD mice, indicating decreased insulin sensitivity by T0901317 administration, and which was further supported by impaired insulin signalling found in epididymal fat and decreased insulin-induced glucose uptake in 3T3-L1 adipocytes by T0901317 administration. In conclusion, these findings reveal that LXR activation impairs adipose expansion by increasing adipocyte apoptosis, lipolysis and antagonising PPARγ-mediated transcriptional activity, which contributes to decreased insulin sensitivity in whole body. The potential of LXR activation being a therapeutic target for atherosclerosis might be limited by the possibility of exacerbating insulin resistance.
Huntington's disease (HD) is a fatal, inherited neurodegenerative disorder characterized by uncontrollable dance-like movements, as well as cognitive deficits and mood changes. A feature of HD is a metabolic disturbance that precedes neurological symptoms. In addition, brain cholesterol synthesis is significantly reduced, which could hamper synaptic transmission.
Alterations in lipid metabolism as a potential target for therapeutic intervention in the R6/2 mouse model of HD were examined.
Electrophysiological recordings in vitro examined the acute effects of cholesterol-modifying drugs. In addition, behavioral testing, effects on synaptic activity, and measurements of circulating and brain tissue concentrations of cholesterol and the ketone β-hydroxybutyrate (BHB), were examined in symptomatic R6/2 mice and littermate controls raised on normal chow or a ketogenic diet (KD).
Whole-cell voltage clamp recordings of striatal medium-sized spiny neurons (MSNs) from symptomatic R6/2 mice showed increased frequency of spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents (sIPSCs) compared with littermate controls. Incubation of slices in cholesterol reduced the frequency of large-amplitude sIPSCs. Addition of BHB or the Liver X Receptor (LXR) agonist T0901317 reduced the frequency and amplitude of sIPSCs. Surprisingly, incubation in simvastatin to reduce cholesterol levels also decreased the frequency of sIPSCs. HD mice fed the KD lost weight more gradually, performed better in an open field, had fewer stereotypies and lower brain levels of cholesterol than mice fed a regular diet.
Lipid metabolism represents a potential target for therapeutic intervention in HD. Modifying cholesterol or ketone levels acutely in the brain can partially rescue synaptic alterations, and the KD can prevent weight loss and improve some behavioral abnormalities.
Hepatic ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) represents a major risk factor of early graft dysfunction and acute/chronic rejection as well as a key obstacle to expanding the donor pool in orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT). Although glucocorticoid receptor (GR) signaling may enhance cytoprotective programs, clinical use of glucocorticoid is limited because of adverse effects, whereas clinical relevance of GR-facilitated cytoprotection in OLT remains unknown. We aimed to evaluate the significance of hepatic GR in clinical OLT and verify the impact of recombinant human relaxin (rhRLX), which may function as a GR agonist in a tissue/disease-specific manner. Fifty-one OLT patients were recruited under an institutional research board (IRB) protocol. Liver biopsies were collected after cold storage (presurgery) and 2 hours postreperfusion (before abdominal closure), followed by western blotting-assisted hepatic analyses. Forty-three percent of OLTs failed to increase GR perioperatively under surgical stress. Post-/pre-GR ratios at postoperative day 1 correlated negatively with serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST)/cleaved caspase-3 and positively with B-cell lymphoma-extra large (Bcl-xL)/B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) levels. In a murine OLT model with extended (18-hour) cold storage, treatment with rhRLX ameliorated ischemia-reperfusion (IR) damage and improved survival while up-regulating hepatocyte GR and Bcl-xL/Bcl-2 expression in OLT. rhRLX-induced GR suppressed hepatocyte high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) translocation/release, accompanied by decreased Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)/receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE), suppressed interleukin 1 beta (IL1β), chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2 (CCL2), C-X-C motif chemokine (CXCL)10, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα), CXCL1, and CXCL2 levels, and attenuated neutrophil/macrophage accumulation in OLT. Inhibition of GR in hepatocyte culture and in OLT diminished rhRLX-mediated cytoprotection.
This translational study underscores the role of rhRLX-GR signaling as a regulator of hepatocellular protection against IR stress in OLT. In the context of a recent phase III clinical trial demonstrating positive outcomes of rhRLX in patients with acute heart failure, studies on rhRLX for the management of IRI in OLT recipients are warranted. (Hepatology 2018).
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by an extensive accumulation of amyloid-β (Aβ) peptide, which triggers a set of deleterious processes, including synaptic dysfunction, inflammation, and neuronal injury, leading to neuronal loss and cognitive impairment. A large body of evidence supports that nuclear receptor (NR) activation could be a promising therapeutic approach for AD. NRs are ligand-activated transcription factors that regulate gene expression and have cell type-specific effects. In this review, we discuss the mechanisms that underlie the beneficial effects of NRs in AD. Moreover, we summarize studies reported in the last 10-15 years and their major outcomes arising from the pharmacological targeting of NRs in AD animal models. The dissection of the pathways regulated by NRs in the context of AD is of importance in identifying novel and effective therapeutic strategies.
Previously, we showed that changes in nuclear estrogen receptor (NER) concentrations within large dissections of the preoptic area and hypothalamus of pregnant rats might underlie changes in both maternal and sexual behaviors. To more precisely localize these biochemical changes, NER concentrations were measured in microdissected nuclei within the preoptic area and hypothalamus of pregnant rats on days 8, 16 and 22. Results indicated that NER levels changed significantly throughout pregnancy and that the magnitude and direction of change was site specific. Although a different pattern of change was found in each nucleus, NER levels in most preoptic area nuclei were significantly higher by the 16th day of pregnancy compared to those on day 8, while receptor levels in most hypothalamic nuclei did not increase until day 22 of pregnancy. The higher NER levels found in preoptic area nuclei of female rats as pregnancy advances can be correlated with growing maternal responsiveness during pregnancy, while elevated concentrations of NER in hypothalamic nuclei at the end of pregnancy may indicate preparation for postpartum estrus.
A sex difference in the LH rise after gonadectomy is clearly observable in the rat. While male rats respond with an early (10-12 h) increase in LH after orchidectomy, a delayed response (2-3 days) is recorded after ovariectomy. In this study we tested the hypothesis that the delayed response to gonadectomy in the E2-treated males is due to a more prolonged retention of E2 (when compared with the corresponding male feedback signal, testosterone) within specific central nuclear receptor sites. Orchidectomized (ORDX) animals implanted with either empty or E2-filled Silastic capsules were sacrificed at 0, 24, 48 and 72 h after ORDX or E2-capsule removal. LH levels in ORDX rats rose several-fold by 24 h, whereas E2-treated, ORDX rats, showed no changes in peripheral LH levels until 72 h after E2-capsule removal. At the time of E2-capsule removal (0 h) large increases in nuclear estradiol receptor (NER) levels were seen in anterior pituitary, preoptic area, and hypothalamus (HYP). Twenty-four hours after E2-capsule removal, NER levels were still high in the 3 areas, and by 48 h NER values had returned to control (ORDX) levels, with the exception of HYP where they were slightly but significantly elevated. The increase in NER, as well as the subsequent decline after E2-capsule removal was paralleled by similar changes in cytosolic progestin receptor (CPR) levels in all three regions. Cytosolic testosterone levels were not changed by the E2-treatment. The results indicate that the feminized response to orchidectomy observed in E2-implanted males is related to a prolonged retention of the E2-receptor in nuclear sites. Further, they indicate that E2-treatment in males, as is the case in females, can induce a marked increase in progestin receptor levels within specific brain regions as well as in the pituitary. The reduction in NER and CPR levels to castrate values precedes the first detectable increase in peripheral LH levels. In conclusion, the pattern of LH rise after gonadectomy in the rat is dependent upon the steroidal milieu at the time of removal of the gonads.
