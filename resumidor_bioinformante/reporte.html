In this study the effect of administration of &beta;-naphthoflavone (BNF), potent AhR ligand, on the expression of AhR, AhRR, CYP1A1, CYP1A2, CYP1B1, NQO1, GSTA1, ALDH3A1 and UGT1A genes encoding the enzymes controlled by AhR were examined in thirteen laryngeal tumor cell lines and in HepaRG cell line. The analyzed cell lines were derived from patients with squamous laryngeal cancer, with history of cigarette smoking and without signs of human papillomavirus types 16 and 18 infection in investigated cells. Quantitative real-time RT-PCR analysis revealed huge interindividual differences in expression of genes from AhR regulatory network. Our results strongly suggest predominant effect of DNA methylation on induction of CYP1A1 expression by AhR ligands as well. Our results indicate that differentiated HepaRG cell line appeared to be very good substitute for human liver in studies on xenobiotic metabolism by AhR regulated enzymes.Hypoxia promotes genetic instability and is therefore an important factor in carcinogenesis. We have previously shown that activation of the hypoxia responsive transcription factor HIF&alpha; can enhance the mutagenic phenotype induced by the environmental mutagen benzo[a]pyrene (BaP). To further elucidate the mechanism behind the ability of hypoxia to increase mutagenicity of carcinogens, we examined the activation and detoxification of BaP under hypoxic conditions. To this end, the human lung carcinoma cell line A549 was treated with BaP under 20%, 5% or 0.2% oxygen for 18h and alterations in BaP metabolism were assayed. First, BaP-induced expression of key metabolic enzymes was analysed; expression levels of the activating CYP1A1 and CYP1B1 were increased, while the detoxifying enzymes UGT1A6 and UGT2B7 were significantly reduced by hypoxia. To evaluate whether these changes had an effect on metabolism, levels of BaP and several of its metabolites were determined. Cells under hypoxia have a reduced capacity to metabolise BaP leaving more of the parent molecule intact. Additionally, BaP-7,8-dihydrodiol, the pre-cursor metabolite of the reactive metabolite BaP-7,8-dihydroxy-9,10-epoxide (BPDE), was formed in higher concentrations. Finally, under hypoxia, DNA adducts accumulated over a period of 168h, whereas adducts were efficiently removed in 20% oxygen conditions. The delayed detoxification kinetics resulted in a 1.5-fold increase in DNA adducts. These data indicate that the metabolism under hypoxic conditions has shifted towards increased activation of BaP instead of detoxification and support the idea that modulation of carcinogen metabolism is an important additional mechanism for the observed HIF1 mediated genetic instability.Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune chronic inflammatory disease that presents several clinical manifestations, affecting multiple organs and systems. Immunological, environmental, hormonal and genetic factors may contribute to disease. Genes and proteins involved in metabolism and detoxification of xenobiotics are often used as susceptibility markers to diseases with environmental risk factors. Cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes activate the xenobiotic making it more reactive, while the Glutathione S-transferases (GST) enzymes conjugate the reduced glutathione with electrophilic compounds, facilitating the toxic products excretion. CYP and GST polymorphisms can alter the expression and catalytic activity of enzymes. This study aimed to investigate the role of genetic variants of CYP and GST in susceptibility and clinical expression of SLE, through the analysis of GSTM1 null, GSTT1 null, GSTP1*Ile105Val, CYP1A1*2C and CYP2E1*5B polymorphisms. 371 SLE patients from Hospital de Cl&iacute;nicas de Porto Alegre and 522 healthy blood donors from southern Brazil were evaluated. GSTP1 and CYP variants were genotyped using PCR-RFLP and GSTT1 and GSTM1 variants were analyzed by multiplex PCR. Among European-derived individuals, a lower frequency of GSTP1*Val heterozygous genotypes was found in SLE patients when compared to controls (p = 0.005). In African-derived SLE patients, the CYP2E1*5B allelic frequency was higher in relation to controls (p = 0.054). We did not observe any clinical implication of the CYP and GST polymorphisms in patients with SLE. Our data suggest a protective role of the GSTP1*Ile/Val heterozygous genotype against the SLE in European-derived and a possible influence of the CYP2E1*5B allele in SLE susceptibility among African-derived individuals.The aim of this study was to characterize concentration- and time-dependent responses in juvenile Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) following exposure for one and three weeks to the water-soluble fraction (WAF) of three weathered oils: Arabian Light crude oil (ALC), North Sea crude oil (NSC) and ship-diesel. The sum of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) in water was highest after one week of exposure and within environmentally relevant concentrations. PAH metabolites in bile confirmed exposure to and uptake of PAHs. Hepatic cytochrome P450 1A (CYP1A) gene expression (mRNA quantification) increased dramatically following exposure to all three oil types (fold-change up to 165) and there was a time lag between gene and protein expression. Hepatic CYP1A protein concentration and ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD) activity were more variable among individuals and treatments than gene expression. EROD activity in liver and gills increased in fish exposed to WAF from the two crude oils, but not in fish exposed to WAF from diesel. Exposure to diesel appeared to induce oxidative stress to a greater extent than exposure to crude oils. Other biomarkers (glutathione S-transferases, acetylcholine esterase, vitellogenin) did not appear to respond to the exposure and hence did not discriminate among oils. Biomarker responses in cod after exposure to weathered crude oils and diesel suggested that the CYP1A system and oxidative stress markers have the highest potential for discriminating among different oil types and to monitor the environmental consequences of spills.The placenta regulates the passage of both endogenous and xenobiotic compounds to the fetus during pregnancy. A small number of xenobiotic metabolizing CYP enzymes are constantly expressed in placenta, those include CYP19A1 which mainly converts androgens to estrogens, and CYP1A1 whose substrates include steroid hormones and xenobiotics. We performed an analysis of co-expression of xenobiotic metabolizing enzyme-coding genes and transcription factors in placenta and in 86 other tissues to discern the unique characteristics of the placental transcriptome. Transcription factors (TFs) driving the expression of proteins involved in phase I and II xenobiotic metabolism in the liver were not expressed in the placenta, nor were the bulk of xenobiotic metabolizing hepatic CYP enzymes. In contrast, TFs whose co-expression correlated with CYP1A1, i.e. AHR, PPARG, and CEBPB were highly expressed in placenta. The placenta is a hormonal tissue, and one needs to maintain the tissue-specific focus by removing the hepatic spectacles.The 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) toxic equivalent quantity (TCDD-TEQ) approach was used successfully to predict lethal embryotoxicity in salmonids, but its applicability to sublethal effects of mixtures of organohalogenated compounds in other fish species is poorly known. The sublethal toxicity of two dioxin-like compounds (DLCs), 3,3&#39;,4,4&#39;-tetrachlorobiphenyl (PCB77) and 2,3,4,7,8-pentachlorodibenzofuran (2,3,4,7,8-PnCDF), two non-dioxin-like (NDL) polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), 2,2&#39;,5,5&#39;-tetrachlorobiphenyl (PCB52) and 2,3,3&#39;,4&#39;,6-pentachlorobiphenyl (PCB110), and of Aroclor 1254, a complex commercial mixture of PCBs, was assessed in Fundulus heteroclitus embryos exposed by intravitelline injection. At 16 days post-fertilization, the two DLCs and Aroclor 1254 altered prey capture ability in addition to inducing classical aryl hydrocarbon receptor-mediated responses: ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD) induction, craniofacial deformities and reduction in body length. None of these responses was induced by the two NDL PCBs, at doses up to 5400 ng g(-1)wet weight. Dose-response curves for prey capture ability for the 2 DLCs tested were not parallel to that of TCDD, violating a fundamental assumption for relative potency (ReP) estimation. Dose-response curves for EROD induction were parallel for 2,3,4,7,8-PnCDF and TCDD, but the ReP of 2,3,4,7,8-PnCDF for F. heteroclitus was 5-fold higher than the World Health Organization (WHO) fish toxic equivalent factor (TEF) based on embryolethality in salmonids. The chemically derived TCDD-TEQs of Aroclor 1254, calculated using 3,3&#39;,4,4&#39;,5-pentachlorobiphenyl (PCB126) concentrations and it ReP for F. heteroclitus, overestimated its potency to induce EROD activity possibly due to antagonistic interactions among PCBs. This study highlights the limitations of using TEFs based on salmonid toxicity data alone for risk assessment to other fish species. There is a need to assess the variability of RePs of DLCs in different species for a variety of endpoints and to better understand interactions between DLCs and other toxic chemicals.Benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) is an environmental pollutant produced by combustive processes, such as cigarette smoke and coke ovens, and is implicated in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. Cytochrome P450 1A1 (CYP1A1) plays a role in both metabolic activation and detoxication of BaP in a context-dependent manner. The role of CYP1A1 in BaP-induced toxicity in aorta remains unknown. First, we fed Apoe&#8315;/&#8315; mice an atherogenic diet plus BaP and found that oral BaP-enhanced atherosclerosis is associated with increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) and inflammatory markers, such as plasma tumor necrosis factor levels and aortic mRNA expression of vascular endothelial growth factor A (Vegfa). We next examined the effect of an atherogenic diet plus BaP on ROS and inflammatory markers in Cyp1a1&#8315;/&#8315; mice. Although this treatment was not sufficient to induce atherosclerotic lesions in Cyp1a1&#8315;/&#8315; mice, plasma antioxidant levels were decreased in Cyp1a1&#8315;/&#8315; mice even in the absence of BaP treatment. The atherogenic diet plus BaP effectively elevated plasma ROS levels and expression of atherosclerosis-related genes, specifically Vegfa, in Cyp1a1&#8315;/&#8315; mice compared with wild-type mice. BaP treatment increased Vegfa mRNA levels in mouse embryonic fibroblasts from Cyp1a1&#8315;/&#8315; mice but not from wild-type mice. BaP-induced DNA adduct formation was increased in the aorta of Cyp1a1&#8315;/&#8315; mice, but not wild-type or Apoe&#8315;/&#8315; mice, and the atherogenic diet decreased BaP-induced DNA adducts in Cyp1a1&#8315;/&#8315; mice compared with mice on a control diet. These data suggest that ROS production contributes to BaP-exacerbated atherosclerosis and that CYP1A1 plays a protective role against oral BaP toxicity in aorta.Risk assessment for mixtures of dioxin-like compounds uses the toxic equivalency factor (TEF) approach. Although current WHO-TEFs are mostly based on oral administration, they are commonly used to determine toxicity equivalencies (TEQs) in human blood or tissues. However, the use of &quot;intake&quot; TEFs to calculate systemic TEQs in for example human blood, has never been validated. In this study, intake and systemic relative effect potencies (REPs) for 1,2,3,7,8-pentachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (PeCDD), 2,3,4,7,8-pentachlorodibenzofuran (4-PeCDF), 3,3&#39;,4,4&#39;,5-pentachlorobiphenyl (PCB-126), 2,3&#39;,4,4&#39;,5-pentachlorobiphenyl (PCB-118) and 2,3,3&#39;,4,4&#39;,5-hexachlorobiphenyl (PCB-156) were compared in rats. The effect potencies were calculated based on administered dose and liver, adipose or plasma concentrations in female Sprague-Dawley rats 3 days after a single oral dose, relative to 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD). Hepatic ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase activity and gene expression of Cyp1a1, 1a2, 1b1 and aryl hydrocarbon receptor repressor in liver and peripheral blood lymphocytes were used as endpoints. Results show that plasma-based systemic REPs were generally within a half log range around the intake REPs for all congeners tested, except for 4-PeCDF. Together with our previously reported systemic REPs from a mouse study, these data do not warrant the use of systemic REPs as systemic TEFs for human risk assessment. However, further investigation for plasma-based systemic REPs for 4-PeCDF is desirable.Sunitinib (SUN) is a new tyrosine kinase inhibitor that possesses both anti-angiogenic and anti-tumor activities. Although SUN has improved survival rate in cancer patients, cardiotoxicity has been reported as a significant side effect. Several studies suggested a role for the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) and its regulated genes such as cytochrome P4501A1 (CYP1A1) in the pathogenesis of heart failure and cardiac hypertrophy. To test the hypothesis that SUN induces cardiac hypertrophy through the modulation of AhR, Wistar albino rats were treated for 15 and 30 days with increasing doses of SUN (25, 50, and 100 mg/kg), whereas at the in vitro level, rat cardiomyocyte H9c2 cells were incubated with SUN (1, 2.5, and 5 &mu;M). Thereafter, cardiac hypertrophy parameters were determined at the biochemical, histopathology, and gene expression levels. SUN treatment causes increase in cardiac enzymes, changes in histopathology, and induction in several hypertrophic markers. This was associated with proportional increase in the CYP1A1 gene in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. The direct involvement of AhR in the SUN-induced cardiac hypertrophy in H9c2 cells was supported by the ability of resveratrol, an AhR antagonist, to block the SUN-induced hypertrophy and the ability of SB203580, a novel AhR agonist, to potentiate SUN-induced hypertrophic genes. This is the first demonstration that SUN induces hypertrophic genes in vivo and in vitro rat cardiomyocyte through AhR/CYP1A1-mediated mechanism.Adaptations to a new environment, such as a polluted one, often involve large modifications of the existing phenotypes. Changes in gene expression and regulation during critical developmental stages may explain these phenotypic changes. Embryos from a population of the teleost fish, Fundulus heteroclitus, inhabiting a clean estuary do not survive when exposed to sediment extract from a site highly contaminated with polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) while embryos derived from a population inhabiting a PAH polluted estuary are remarkably resistant to the polluted sediment extract. We exposed embryos from these two populations to surrogate model PAHs and analyzed changes in gene expression, morphology, and cardiac physiology in order to better understand sensitivity and adaptive resistance mechanisms mediating PAH exposure during development.The synergistic effects of two model PAHs, an aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) agonist (&beta;-naphthoflavone) and a cytochrome P4501A (CYP1A) inhibitor (&alpha;-naphthoflavone), caused significant developmental delays, impaired cardiac function, severe morphological alterations and failure to hatch, leading to the deaths of reference embryos; resistant embryos were mostly unaffected. Unexpectedly, patterns of gene expression among normal and moderately deformed embryos were similar, and only severely deformed embryos showed a contrasting pattern of gene expression. Given the drastic morphological differences between reference and resistant embryos, a surprisingly low percentage of genes, 2.24% of 6,754 analyzed, show statistically significant differences in transcript levels during late organogenesis between the two embryo populations.Our study demonstrates important contrasts in responses between reference and resistant natural embryo populations to synergistic effects of surrogate model PAHs that may be important in adaptive mechanisms mediating PAH effects during fish embryo development. These results suggest that statistically significant changes in gene expression of relatively few genes contribute to the phenotypic changes and large morphological differences exhibited by reference and resistant populations upon exposure to PAH pollutants. By correlating cardiac physiology and morphology with changes in gene expression patterns of reference and resistant embryos, we provide additional evidence for acquired resistance among embryos whose parents live at heavily contaminated sites.Fat deposits in chickens contribute significantly to meat quality attributes such as juiciness, flavor, taste and other organoleptic properties. The quantity of fat deposited increases faster and earlier in the fast-growing chickens than in slow-growing chickens. In this study, Affymetrix Genechip&reg; Chicken Genome Arrays 32773 transcripts were used to compare gene expression profiles in liver and hypothalamus tissues of fast-growing and slow-growing chicken at 8 wk of age. Real-time RT-PCR was used to validate the differential expression of genes selected from the microarray analysis. The mRNA expression of the genes was further examined in fat tissues. The association of single nucleotide polymorphisms of four lipid-related genes with fat traits was examined in a F2 resource population.Four hundred genes in the liver tissues and 220 genes hypothalamus tissues, respectively, were identified to be differentially expressed in fast-growing chickens and slow-growing chickens. Expression levels of genes for lipid metabolism (SULT1B1, ACSBG2, PNPLA3, LPL, AOAH) carbohydrate metabolism (MGAT4B, XYLB, GBE1, PGM1, HKDC1)cholesttrol biosynthesis (FDPS, LSS, HMGCR, NSDHL, DHCR24, IDI1, ME1) HSD17B7 and other reaction or processes (CYP1A4, CYP1A1, AKR1B1, CYP4V2, DDO) were higher in the fast-growing White Recessive Rock chickens than in the slow-growing Xinghua chickens. On the other hand, expression levels of genes associated with multicellular organism development, immune response, DNA integration, melanin biosynthetic process, muscle organ development and oxidation-reduction (FRZB, DMD, FUT8, CYP2C45, DHRSX, and CYP2C18) and with glycol-metabolism (GCNT2, ELOVL 6, and FASN), were higher in the XH chickens than in the fast-growing chickens. RT-PCR validated high expression levels of nine out of 12 genes in fat tissues. The G1257069A and T1247123C of the ACSBG2 gene were significantly associated with abdominal fat weight. The G4928024A of the FASN gene were significantly associated with fat bandwidth, and abdominal fat percentage. The C4930169T of the FASN gene was associated with abdominal fat weight while the A59539099G of the ELOVL 6 was significantly associated with subcutaneous fat. The A8378815G of the DDT was associated with fat band width.The differences in fat deposition were reflected with differential gene expressions in fast and slow growing chickens.Consumption of a high-fat diet (HFD) is correlated with increased oxidative stress and chronic inflammation in many organs. Regulatory T cells (Tregs) are essential negative regulators of inflammation. We hypothesized that resveratrol (trans-3,5,4&#39;-trihydroxystilbene) could protect against HFD-induced oxidative stress and inflammation. Therefore, we examined the effect of resveratrol on oxidative stress and the relevant peripheral immune-regulating mechanisms in HFD-induced obese (DIO) and diet-resistant mice. C57BL/6 mice were fed a normal diet and an HFD for 13 weeks. Then the experimental group was subdivided into DIO and diet-resistant groups according to their body weights, which were further supplemented with 0.03% resveratrol and 0.06% resveratrol, respectively, for an additional 13 weeks. Resveratrol prevented the accumulation of chronic oxidative stress and suppression of Tregs production in HFD mice, modulated changes of cytokines in the plasma and spleen, and decreased expressions of inflammatory mediators compared with those of the DIO group. Our results indicate that resveratrol, as a feasible effective supplement for HFD, can relieve oxidative stress, inhibit inflammatory genes expression, and increase Tregs number via aryl hydrocarbon receptor activation inhibited by HFD, especially in DIO mice.Despite advances in our understanding concerning the pathology of hypertension, the mechanisms that underpin the origin of hypertension remain to be fully elucidated. This enigma is, at least in part, due to inherent limitations of various animal models of hypertension. Here, we show the genetically modified Cyp1a1-Ren2 rat model, in which the onset and severity of angiotensin II-dependent hypertension can be tightly controlled, as an effective model for investigating increased sympathetic drive for the onset of hypertension. Cyp1a1-Ren2 rats were surgically prepared with radiotelemetric transmitters for the continuous measurement of arterial blood pressure (ABP). ABP was recorded in freely moving rats that were fed with either normal rat chow or a diet containing indole-3-carbinol (0.225% w/w) for 7 days to induce hypertension. Structural morphology of and endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) protein expression in heart and/or vascular tissue were analyzed. Sympathetic tone was estimated using spectral analysis of heart rate variability. The progressive induction of hypertension over 7 days was matched with a parallel increase in sympathetic tone. By day 7 of hypertension, eNOS expression in the mesenteric artery was elevated. However, the elevated ABP, sympathetic tone, and eNOS had not elicited gross morphological remodeling of the heart or vasculature. Importantly, both the increase in sympathetic tone and overexpression of eNOS within the vasculature were reversed when ABP was returned to normal. We conclude that the Cyp1a1-Ren2 rat provides an effective model for investigating specific adverse and transient changes in central sympathetic modulation of arterial blood pressure during the early onset of angiotensin-dependent hypertension.Pollution is one of today&#39;s greatest problems, and the release of contaminants into the environment can cause adverse changes in vitally important biological pathways. In this study, we exposed three-spined stickleback Gasterosteus aculeatus to produced water (PW), i.e. wastewater from offshore petroleum production. PW contains substances such as alkylphenols (APs) and aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) known to induce toxicant stress and endocrine disruption in a variety of organisms. Following exposure to PW, a standardized confinement treatment was applied as a second stressor (PW-stress), testing how fish already under stress from the pollutant would respond to an additional stressor. The endpoint for analysis was a combination of blood levels of cortisol and glucose, in addition to transcribed levels of a set of genes related to toxicant stress, endocrine disruption and general stress. The findings of this study indicate that low doses of PW do not induce vitellogenin in immature female stickleback, but do cause an upregulation of cytochrome (CYP1A) and UDP-glucuronsyltransferase (UDP-GT), two biomarkers related to toxicant stress. However, when the second stressor was applied, both genes were downregulated, indicating that the confinement exposure had a suppressive effect on the expression of toxicant biomarkers (CYP1A and UDP-GT). Further, two of the stress related genes, heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) and stress-induced phosphoprotein (STIP), were upregulated in both PW- and PW-stress-treatment, but not in the water control confinement treatment, indicating that PW posed as a larger stress-factor than confinement for these genes. The confinement stressor caused an increased level of glucose in both control and PW-treated fish, indicating hyperglycemia, a commonly reported stress response in fish.Glioma is still one of the most aggressive forms of brain tumors. Understanding of the biological and pathophysiological mechanisms of survival can help the researchers to develop new management modalities. Industrial toxins could be one of the most important causes for brain tumors, such as dioxin and other aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) ligands. Toxicity of these compounds includes a series of cellular events starting from binding with AhR and ending with the increased expression of a group of xenobiotic metabolizing enzymes (XME) such as the cytochrome P450 (CYPs), CYP1A1, CYP1A2, and CYP1B1. Therefore, identification of the localizations and expressions of the AhR and its regulated CYPs in the central nervous system (CNS) and neuronal cells is of major importance in understanding their physiological and pathological roles. Generally, low but significant level of CYPs expression is demonstrated in the brain in a tissue- and species-specific manner. Moreover, most, but not all, AhR-regulated CYPs are expressed differently in most of the neuronal and glial cells. Although the exact mechanisms of AhR-mediated glioma and neurotoxicity are not fully understood, the present review proposes several mechanisms which include generating reactive oxygen species, activating glutamate receptors, peroxisome proliferator- activated receptors, histone acetylation, and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3.The present study was designed to evaluate the influence of long-term environmental human exposure to three heavy metals, lead (Pb), cadmium (Cd), and mercury (Hg), on the expression of detoxifying, xenobiotic metabolizing, and DNA repair genes in Mahd Ad-Dahab city. The study groups consisted of 40 healthy male residents (heavy metal-exposed) and 20 healthy male from Riyadh city, 700 km away, and served as control group. The heavy metal-exposed group with high exposure to Pb, Cd, or Hg was divided into three subgroups Pb-, Cd-, and Hg-exposed groups, respectively. The mRNA expression levels of detoxifying, NQO1, HO-1, GSTA1, MT-1, and HSP70, were significantly decreased in all heavy metal-exposed group as compared to control group. This was accompanied with a proportional decrease in the expression of xenobiotic metabolizing gene, cytochrome P4501A1. On the other hand, the DNA repair gene OGG1 and the 8-OHdG level were dramatically inhibited in Cd-exposed group only.Developing neurons, derived from the human umbilical cord blood stem cells (hUCBSCs), were investigated for their stage-specific responses against 3-methylcholanthrene (MC), a well-known polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon. Three-dimensional (3D) molecular docking demonstrates the strong hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions of MC with amino acids of aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) and aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator (ARNT) within 4 &Aring; and subsequent inhibition of cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB), &alpha;-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors. Protein-protein docking also confirms that induced levels of AHR inhibit the neurogenesis-related transcription factor (CREB) with maximum docking scores. In concurrence with in silico data, MC exposure significantly up regulates the expression and activity of AHR, CYP1A1 and glutathione S-transferase P1-1 (GSTP1-1) and down regulates the expression of CREB, AMPA and NMDA receptors in hUCBSC-derived neuronal cells at various maturity (0, 2, 4, 8 days of differentiation). MC-mediated significant down regulation in the expression of stage-specific neuronal markers (Nestin, neural cell adhesion molecule-NCAM, synaptophysin-SYP, CREB, AMPA and N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor subunit 2A-NR2A) was also noticed in cells all through the differentiation. Data identify the possible interference of MC in neuronal transmission and neurogenesis.Stem cell technology could offer a unique tool to develop human-based in vitro liver models that are applicable for testing of potential liver toxicity early during drug development. In this context, recent research has indicated that human Wharton&#39;s Jelly-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hWJs) represent an interesting stem cell population to develop human hepatocyte-like cells. Here, an in-depth analysis of the expression of liver-specific transcription factors and other key hepatic markers in hWJs is evaluated at both the mRNA and protein level. Our results reveal that transcription factors that are mandatory to acquire and maintain an adult hepatic phenotype (HNF4A and HNF1A), as well as adult hepatic markers (ALB, CX32, CYP1A1, CYP1A2, CYP2B6 and CYP3A4) are not expressed in hWJs with the exception of K18. On the contrary, transcription factors involved in liver development (GATA4, GATA6, SOX9 and SOX17) and liver progenitor markers (DKK1, DPP4, DSG2, CX43 and K19) were found to be highly expressed in hWJs. These findings provide additional indication that hWJs could be a promising stem cell source to generate hepatocyte-like cells necessary for the development of a functional human-based in vitro liver model.Benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) is a prototypical polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH); this ubiquitous environmental carcinogenic agent is found in tobacco smoke, charcoal-grilled foods, and PAH-contaminated surfaces of roofs, playgrounds, and highways. Cytochrome P450 1 wild-type, Cyp1a2(-/-), Cyp1b1(-/-), or Cyp1a2/1b1(-/-) knockouts, and mice with Cyp1a1 expression deleted in hepatocytes can ingest large oral BaP doses (125 mg/kg/d) without apparent toxicity. Cyp1a1(-/-) and Cyp1a1/1a2(-/-) knockouts and mice with Cyp1a1 expression deleted in gastrointestinal (GI) tract epithelial cells develop immunotoxicity and die within 32 days, indicating that GI tract inducible CYP1A1 is absolutely required for detoxication of oral BaP. Cyp1a1/1b1(-/-) and Cyp1a1/1a2/1b1(-/-) mice are rescued from immunosuppression and early death due to absent metabolic activation of BaP by CYP1B1 in immune cells. Ten-fold lower oral BaP doses result in adenocarcinoma of the proximal small intestine (PSI) in Cyp1a1(-/-) mice; Cyp1a1/1b1(-/-) double-knockout mice show no PSI cancer but develop squamous cell carcinoma of the preputial gland duct (PGD). BaP-metabolizing CYP1B1 in the PSI and CYP3A59 in the PGD are the most likely candidates to participate in tumor initiation in the epithelial cells of these two tissues; oncogenes and tumor-suppressor genes upregulated and downregulated during tumorigenesis are completely different between these tissues. This &quot;oral BaP Cyp1&quot; mouse paradigm represents a powerful teaching tool, showing that gene-environment interactions depend on route-of-administration: the same oral, but not intraperitoneal, BaP exposure leads to dramatic differences in target-organ toxicity and tumor type as a function of dose and Cyp1 genotype.Cytochrome P450 isozymes (CYPs) from the CYP1 and CYP2 families located primarily in extra-hepatic tissues represent ideal candidates for chemotherapeutic drug development because: 1.) They are usually involved in the metabolism of endogenous substrates that are important for cell homeostasis and growth 2.) The over-expression of certain CYPs has been reported in various malignancies 3.) There has been much clinical success with inhibitors of CYPs involved in hormone synthesis. The most ideal candidates for chemotherapeutic drug development will be discussed in terms of their biological importance and relevant substrates. This review will focus on: 1.) CYP1A1 and CYP1B1 from the CYP1 family because of the dual role these enzymes play in the bioactivation of known carcinogens and endogenous compounds. 2.) The targeting of CYPs in hypoxic environments as a therapeutic strategy. 3.) CYP2J2 and its role in the metabolism of arachidonic acid to epoxyeicosatrienoic acids and angiogenesis will also be examined. While much progress has been made towards understanding the role of CYPs in extrahepatic tissue, future studies focused on the development of selective inhibitors coupled with appropriate delivery systems that would target the tumor micro-environments could lead to significant advancement in chemotherapeutic strategies.</span></p></body></html>
