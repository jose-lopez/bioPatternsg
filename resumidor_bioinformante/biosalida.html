First,<b> BaP-</b> induced<b> expression of key metabolic enzymes was analysed; expression levels of the activating CYP1A1 and CYP1B1 were increased </b>, while the detoxifying enzymes UGT1A6 and UGT2B7 were significantly reduced by hypoxia.   <b> Cells under hypoxia</b> have a<b> reduced capacity to metabolise BaP leaving more of the parent molecule intact</b>.   <b> 5-fold</b> increase<b> in DNA adducts</b>.   <b><b> These data</b> indicate that the metabolism under hypoxic conditions</b> has shifted towards increased activation of BaP instead of detoxification and support the idea that modulation of carcinogen metabolism is an important additional mechanism for the observed HIF1 mediated genetic instability.   <b> Genes and proteins</b> involved<b> in metabolism and detoxification of xenobiotics are often used as susceptibility markers to diseases with environmental risk factors</b>.   <b> Cytochrome P450 ( CYP) enzymes</b> activate<b> the xenobiotic making it more reactive </b>, while the Glutathione S-transferases ( GST) enzymes conjugate the reduced glutathione with electrophilic compounds, facilitating the toxic products excretion.   <b> Among European-derived individuals </b>, a lower frequency of GSTP1 * Val heterozygous genotypes was found<b> in SLE patients when compared to controls ( p = 0</b>.   <b> Our data</b> suggest a<b> protective role of the GSTP1 * Ile / Val heterozygous genotype against the SLE in European-derived and a possible influence of the CYP2E1 * 5B allele in SLE susceptibility among African-derived individuals</b>.   <b> Hepatic cytochrome P450 1A ( CYP1A) gene expression ( mRNA quantification)</b> increased<b> dramatically following exposure to all three oil types ( fold-change up to 165) and there was a time lag between gene and protein expression</b>.   <b> EROD activity in liver and gills</b> increased<b> in fish exposed to WAF from the two crude oils </b>, but not in fish exposed to WAF from diesel.   <b> Exposure to diesel appeared to</b> induce<b> oxidative stress to a greater extent than exposure to crude oils</b>.   <b> Other biomarkers ( glutathione S-transferases </b>, acetylcholine esterase, vitellogenin) did not appear to respond<b> to the exposure and hence did not discriminate among oils</b>.   <b> Biomarker responses in cod after exposure to weathered crude oils and diesel</b> suggested<b> that the CYP1A system and oxidative stress markers have the highest potential for discriminating among different oil types and to monitor the environmental consequences of spills</b>.   <b> The placenta</b> regulates<b> the passage of both endogenous and xenobiotic compounds to the fetus during pregnancy</b>.   <b> A small number of xenobiotic metabolizing CYP enzymes are constantly</b> expressed<b> in placenta </b>, those include CYP19A1 which mainly converts androgens to estrogens, and CYP1A1 whose substrates include steroid hormones and xenobiotics.   <b> Transcription factors ( TFs) driving the expression of proteins</b> involved<b> in phase I and II xenobiotic metabolism in the liver were not expressed in the placenta </b>, nor were the bulk of xenobiotic metabolizing hepatic CYP enzymes.   <b> The placenta is a hormonal tissue </b>, and one needs to maintain<b> the tissue-specific focus by removing the hepatic spectacles</b>.   <b> At 16 days post-fertilization </b>, the two DLCs and Aroclor 1254 altered prey capture ability in addition to inducing<b> classical aryl hydrocarbon receptor-mediated responses: ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase ( EROD) induction </b>, craniofacial deformities and reduction in body length.   <b> None of these responses was</b> induced<b> by the two NDL PCBs </b>, at doses up to 5400 ng g (-1) wet weight.    heteroclitus, overestimated its potency to induce<b> EROD activity possibly due to antagonistic interactions among PCBs</b>.   <b> The role of CYP1A1 in BaP-</b> induced<b> toxicity in aorta remains unknown</b>.    First, we fed Apoe⁻ / ⁻ mice an atherogenic diet plus BaP and found<b> that oral BaP-enhanced atherosclerosis is associated with increased reactive oxygen species ( ROS) and inflammatory markers </b>, such as plasma tumor necrosis factor levels and aortic mRNA expression of vascular endothelial growth factor A ( Vegfa).   <b> Although this treatment was not sufficient to</b> induce<b> atherosclerotic lesions in Cyp1a1⁻ / ⁻ mice </b>, plasma antioxidant levels were decreased in Cyp1a1⁻ / ⁻ mice even in the absence of<b> BaP treatment</b>.    BaP treatment increased<b> Vegfa mRNA levels in mouse embryonic fibroblasts from Cyp1a1⁻ / ⁻ mice but not from wild-type mice</b>.    BaP-induced<b> DNA adduct formation was increased in the aorta of Cyp1a1⁻ / ⁻ mice </b>, but not wild-type or Apoe⁻ / ⁻ mice, and the atherogenic diet decreased BaP-induced DNA adducts in Cyp1a1⁻ / ⁻ mice compared with mice on a control diet.    These data suggest<b> that ROS production contributes to BaP-exacerbated atherosclerosis and that CYP1A1 plays a protective role against oral BaP toxicity in aorta</b>.   <b> Together with our previously</b> reported<b> systemic REPs from a mouse study </b>, these data do not warrant the use of systemic REPs as systemic TEFs for human risk assessment.   <b> Although SUN</b> has improved survival rate in cancer patients, cardiotoxicity has been reported as a significant side effect.   <b> Several studies</b> suggested a<b> role for the aryl hydrocarbon receptor ( AhR) and its regulated genes such as cytochrome P4501A1 ( CYP1A1) in the pathogenesis of heart failure and cardiac hypertrophy</b>.   <b> To test the hypothesis that SUN</b> induces<b> cardiac hypertrophy through the modulation of AhR </b>, Wistar albino rats were treated for 15 and 30 days with increasing doses of SUN ( 25, 50, and 100 mg / kg), whereas at the in vitro level, rat cardiomyocyte H9c2 cells were incubated with SUN ( 1, 2.   <b> SUN treatment</b> causes<b> increase in cardiac enzymes </b>, changes in histopathology, and induction in several hypertrophic markers.   <b> This was associated with proportional</b> increase<b> in the CYP1A1 gene in a concentration-and time-dependent manner</b>.   <b> The direct involvement of AhR in the SUN-</b> induced<b> cardiac hypertrophy in H9c2 cells was supported by the ability of resveratrol </b>, an AhR antagonist, to block the SUN-induced hypertrophy and the ability of SB203580, a novel AhR agonist, to potentiate SUN-induced hypertrophic genes.   <b> This is the first demonstration that SUN</b> induces<b> hypertrophic genes in vivo and in vitro rat cardiomyocyte through AhR / CYP1A1-mediated mechanism</b>.   <b> Adaptations to a new environment </b>, such as a polluted one, often involve<b> large modifications of the existing phenotypes</b>.   <b> We exposed embryos from these two populations to surrogate model PAHs and analyzed changes in gene expression </b>, morphology, and cardiac physiology in order to better understand sensitivity and adaptive resistance mechanisms mediating<b> PAH exposure during development</b>.   <b> The synergistic effects of two model PAHs </b>, an aryl hydrocarbon receptor ( AHR) agonist (-naphthoflavone) and a cytochrome P4501A ( CYP1A) inhibitor (-naphthoflavone), caused<b> significant developmental delays </b>, impaired cardiac function, severe morphological alterations and failure to hatch, leading to the deaths of reference embryos; resistant embryos were mostly unaffected.   <b> Our study demonstrates important contrasts in responses between reference and resistant natural embryo populations to synergistic effects of surrogate model PAHs that may be important in adaptive mechanisms</b> mediating<b> PAH effects during fish embryo development</b>.   <b> These results</b> suggest<b> that statistically significant changes in gene expression of relatively few genes contribute to the phenotypic changes and large morphological differences exhibited by reference and resistant populations upon exposure to PAH pollutants</b>.   <b> By correlating cardiac physiology and morphology with changes in gene expression patterns of reference and resistant embryos </b>, we provide<b> additional evidence for acquired resistance among embryos whose parents live at heavily contaminated sites</b>.   <b> The quantity of fat deposited</b> increases<b> faster and earlier in the fast-growing chickens than in slow-growing chickens</b>.   <b> Four hundred genes in the liver tissues and 220 genes hypothalamus tissues </b>, respectively, were identified to be differentially expressed<b> in fast-growing chickens and slow-growing chickens</b>.   <b> On the other hand </b>, expression levels of genes associated with multicellular organism development, immune response, DNA integration, melanin biosynthetic process, muscle organ development and oxidation-reduction ( FRZB, DMD, FUT8, CYP2C45, DHRSX, and CYP2C18) and with glycol-metabolism ( GCNT2, ELOVL 6, and FASN), were higher in the XH chickens than in the fast-growing chickens.   <b> Consumption of a high-fat diet ( HFD) is correlated with</b> increased<b> oxidative stress and chronic inflammation in many organs</b>.   <b> We hypothesized that resveratrol ( trans-3 </b>, 5, 4-trihydroxystilbene) could protect against HFD-induced<b> oxidative stress and inflammation</b>.    Therefore, we examined the effect of resveratrol on oxidative stress and the relevant peripheral immune-regulating<b> mechanisms in HFD-induced obese ( DIO) and diet-resistant mice</b>.    Resveratrol prevented<b> the accumulation of chronic oxidative stress and suppression of Tregs production in HFD mice </b>, modulated changes of cytokines in the plasma and spleen, and decreased expressions of inflammatory mediators compared with those of the DIO group.   <b> Our results indicate that resveratrol </b>, as a feasible effective supplement for HFD, can relieve oxidative stress, inhibit<b> inflammatory genes expression </b>, and increase Tregs number via aryl hydrocarbon receptor activation inhibited by HFD, especially in DIO mice.    Here, we show the genetically modified Cyp1a1-Ren2 rat model, in which the onset and severity of angiotensin II-dependent hypertension can be tightly controlled, as an effective model for investigating increased<b> sympathetic drive for the onset of hypertension</b>.   <b> 225 % w / w) for 7 days to</b> induce hypertension.   <b> The progressive induction of hypertension over 7 days was matched with a parallel</b> increase<b> in sympathetic tone</b>.    Importantly, both the increase<b> in sympathetic tone and overexpression of eNOS within the vasculature were reversed when ABP was returned to normal</b>.   <b> We conclude that the Cyp1a1-Ren2 rat</b> provides<b> an effective model for investigating specific adverse and transient changes in central sympathetic modulation of arterial blood pressure during the early onset of angiotensin-dependent hypertension</b>.   <b> Pollution is one of today s greatest problems </b>, and the release<b> of contaminants into the environment can cause adverse changes in vitally important biological pathways</b>.   <b> PW contains substances such as alkylphenols ( APs) and aromatic hydrocarbons ( PAHs) known to</b> induce<b> toxicant stress and endocrine disruption in a variety of organisms</b>.   <b> Following exposure to PW </b>, a standardized confinement treatment was applied as a second stressor ( PW-stress), testing how fish already under stress from the pollutant would respond<b> to an additional stressor</b>.   <b> The endpoint for analysis was a combination of blood levels of cortisol and glucose </b>, in addition to transcribed<b> levels of a set of genes related to toxicant stress </b>, endocrine disruption and general stress.   <b> The findings of this study indicate that low doses of PW do not</b> induce<b> vitellogenin in immature female stickleback </b>, but do cause an upregulation of cytochrome ( CYP1A) and UDP-glucuronsyltransferase ( UDP-GT), two biomarkers related to toxicant stress.    Further, two of the stress related genes, heat shock protein 90 ( HSP90) and stress-induced<b> phosphoprotein ( STIP) </b>, were upregulated in both PW-and PW-stress-treatment , but not in the water control confinement treatment, indicating that PW posed as a larger stress-factor than confinement for these genes.   <b> The confinement stressor</b> caused<b> an increased level of glucose in both control and PW-treated fish </b>, indicating hyperglycemia, a commonly reported stress response in fish.   <b> Industrial toxins could be one of the most important</b> causes<b> for brain tumors </b>, such as dioxin and other aryl hydrocarbon receptor ( AhR) ligands.   <b> Toxicity of these compounds includes a series of cellular events starting from</b> binding<b> with AhR and ending with the increased expression of a group of xenobiotic metabolizing enzymes ( XME) such as the cytochrome P450 ( CYPs) </b>, CYP1A1, CYP1A2, and CYP1B1.    Therefore, identification of the localizations and expressions of the AhR and its regulated<b> CYPs in the central nervous system ( CNS) and neuronal cells is of major importance in understanding their physiological and pathological roles</b>.    Moreover, most, but not all, AhR-regulated<b> CYPs are expressed differently in most of the neuronal and glial cells</b>.   <b> Although the exact mechanisms of AhR-</b> mediated<b> glioma and neurotoxicity are not fully understood </b>, the present review proposes several mechanisms which include generating reactive oxygen species, activating glutamate receptors, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors, histone acetylation, and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3.   <b> The present study was designed to evaluate the influence of long-term environmental human exposure to three heavy metals </b>, lead<b> ( Pb) </b>, cadmium ( Cd), and mercury ( Hg), on the expression of detoxifying, xenobiotic metabolizing, and DNA repair genes in Mahd Ad-Dahab city.   <b> The mRNA expression levels of detoxifying </b>, NQO1, HO-1 , GSTA1, MT-1 , and HSP70, were significantly decreased<b> in all heavy metal-exposed group as compared to control group</b>.   <b> This was accompanied with a proportional</b> decrease<b> in the expression of xenobiotic metabolizing gene </b>, cytochrome P4501A1.    On the other hand, the DNA repair gene OGG1 and the 8-OHdG level were dramatically inhibited<b> in Cd-exposed group only</b>.   <b> Three-dimensional ( 3D) molecular docking demonstrates the strong hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions of MC with amino acids of aryl hydrocarbon receptor ( AHR) and aryl hydrocarbon receptor</b> nuclear<b> translocator ( ARNT) within 4 and subsequent inhibition of cAMP response element-binding protein ( CREB) </b>,-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid ( AMPA) and N-methyl-D-aspartate ( NMDA) receptors.   <b> Protein-protein docking also confirms that</b> induced<b> levels of AHR inhibit the neurogenesis-related transcription factor ( CREB) with maximum docking scores</b>.   <b> In concurrence with in silico data </b>, MC exposure significantly up regulates<b> the expression and activity of AHR </b>, CYP1A1 and glutathione S-transferase P1-1 ( GSTP1-1) and down regulates the expression of CREB, AMPA and NMDA receptors in hUCBSC-derived neuronal cells at various maturity ( 0, 2, 4, 8 days of differentiation).   <b> MC-</b> mediated<b> significant down regulation in the expression of stage-specific neuronal markers ( Nestin </b>, neural cell adhesion molecule-NCAM , synaptophysin-SYP , CREB, AMPA and N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor subunit 2A-NR2A) was also noticed in cells all through the differentiation.   <b> In this context </b>, recent research has indicated that human Wharton s Jelly-derived mesenchymal stem cells ( hWJs) represent an interesting stem cell population to develop human hepatocyte-like cells.    Our results reveal<b> that transcription factors that are mandatory to acquire and maintain an adult hepatic phenotype ( HNF4A and HNF1A) </b>, as well as adult hepatic markers ( ALB, CX32, CYP1A1, CYP1A2, CYP2B6 and CYP3A4) are not expressed in hWJs with the exception of K18.   <b> On the contrary </b>, transcription factors involved<b> in liver development ( GATA4 </b>, GATA6, SOX9 and SOX17) and liver progenitor markers ( DKK1, DPP4, DSG2, CX43 and K19) were found to be highly expressed in hWJs.   <b> These findings</b> provide<b> additional indication that hWJs could be a promising stem cell source to generate hepatocyte-like cells necessary for the development of a functional human-based in vitro liver model</b>.   <b> Benzo[a]  pyrene ( BaP) is a prototypical polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ( PAH) ; this ubiquitous environmental carcinogenic agent is</b> found<b> in tobacco smoke </b>, charcoal-grilled foods, and PAH-contaminated surfaces of roofs, playgrounds, and highways.   <b> Cyp1a1 (-/-) and Cyp1a1 / 1a2 (-/-) knockouts and mice with Cyp1a1 expression deleted in gastrointestinal ( GI) tract epithelial cells develop immunotoxicity and die within 32 days </b>, indicating that GI tract inducible CYP1A1 is absolutely required<b> for detoxication of oral BaP</b>.   <b> BaP-metabolizing CYP1B1 in the PSI and CYP3A59 in the PGD are the most likely candidates to</b> participate<b> in tumor initiation in the epithelial cells of these two tissues; oncogenes and tumor-suppressor genes upregulated and downregulated during tumorigenesis are completely different between these tissues</b>.   <b> This oral BaP Cyp1 mouse paradigm represents a powerful teaching tool </b>, showing that gene-environment interactions depend on route-of-administration : the same oral, but not intraperitoneal, BaP exposure leads<b> to dramatic differences in target-organ toxicity and tumor type as a function of dose and Cyp1 genotype</b>.   <b>) They are usually</b> involved<b> in the metabolism of endogenous substrates that are important for cell homeostasis and growth 2</b>.   <b><b>) The</b> over-expression of certain CYPs</b> has been reported in various malignancies 3.   <b>) There</b> has been much clinical success with inhibitors of CYPs involved in hormone synthesis.   ) The targeting<b> of CYPs in hypoxic environments as a therapeutic strategy</b>.   <b> While much progress</b> has been made towards understanding the role of CYPs in extrahepatic tissue, future studies focused on the development of selective inhibitors coupled with appropriate delivery systems that would target the tumor micro-environments could lead to significant advancement in chemotherapeutic strategies.
