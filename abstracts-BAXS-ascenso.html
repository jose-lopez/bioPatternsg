<PRE CLASS="western">Phenobarbital (PB) increases hepatic drug/steroid-metabolic capability by coordinately activating transcription of the genes encoding various metabolizing enzymes. The nuclear receptor CAR was first implicated as a transcription factor that activates the cytochrome P450 Cyp2b10 gene. In response to PB, CAR forms a heterodimer with the retinoid X receptor (RXR), binds to a PB response element (typified by DR-4 motif), and activates transcription of the gene. In the CAR-null mouse, PB does not only induce the Cyp2b10 gene, but also induces genes encoding various metabolizing enzymes. Thus, CAR is a general nuclear receptor that is essential for PB induction of drug/steroid metabolizing enzymes. PB also induces amino levulinate synthase 1 (ALAS-1), the rate-limiting enzyme in heme biosynthesis, to increase heme supply. However, PB induction of the synthase occurs in CAR-null mice, suggesting that CAR does not coordinate the heme synthesis for the induction of drug/steroid metabolism.
The apical sodium-dependent bile salt transporter (ASBT/SLC10A2), also called the ileal bile acid transporter, mediates the intestinal absorption of bile salts. The efficiency of this transport process is a determinant of hepatic bile salt synthesis from cholesterol and of serum triglyceride levels. Our aim was to characterize the human ASBT gene promoter with respect to regulatory mechanisms that coordinately affect ASBT expression and hepatic lipid and bile salt metabolism. The minimal construct that confers full promoter activity contains three functional hepatocyte nuclear factor 1alpha (HNF1alpha) recognition sites, explaining the dependence of ASBT gene expression upon HNF1alpha. A nuclear receptor binding site arranged as a direct hexanucleotide repeat (DR1 motif) is localized approximately 1.6 kb upstream of the transcription initiation site. Constructs containing this element were transactivated by WY14643 and ciprofibrate, ligands of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARalpha), in Caco2 cells. The DR1 element was shown to bind the PPARalpha/9-cis-retinoic acid receptor heterodimer, and targeted mutagenesis of the DR1 motif abolished PPARalpha responsiveness. Ciprofibrate treatment of SK-ChA cholangiocytes increased ASBT mRNA levels, suggesting a physiologic role for PPARalpha-mediated ASBT gene regulation. This study identifies PPARalpha as a novel link between ileal bile salt absorption and hepatic lipid metabolism.
Sister of P-glycoprotein (SPGP) is the major hepatic bile salt export pump (BSEP). BSEP/SPGP expression varies dramatically among human livers. The potency and hierarchy of bile acids as ligands for the farnesyl/bile acid receptor (FXR/BAR) paralleled their ability to induce BSEP in human hepatocyte cultures. FXR:RXR heterodimers bound to IR1 elements and enhanced bile acid transcriptional activation of the mouse and human BSEP/SPGP promoters. In FXR/BAR nullizygous mice, which have dramatically reduced BSEP/SPGP levels, hepatic CYP3A11 and CYP2B10 were strongly but unexpectedly induced. Notably, the rank order of bile acids as CYP3A4 inducers and activators of pregnane X receptor/steroid and xenobiotic receptor (PXR/SXR) closely paralleled each other but was markedly different from their hierarchy and potency as inducers of BSEP in human hepatocytes. Moreover, the hepatoprotective bile acid ursodeoxycholic acid, which reverses hydrophobic bile acid hepatotoxicity, activates PXR and efficaciously induces CYP3A4 (a bile-metabolizing enzyme) in primary human hepatocytes thus providing one mechanism for its hepatoprotection. Because serum and urinary bile acids increased in FXR/BAR -/- mice, we evaluated hepatic transporters for compensatory changes that might circumvent the profound decrease in BSEP/SPGP. We found weak MRP3 up-regulation. In contrast, MRP4 was substantially increased in the FXR/BAR nullizygous mice and was further elevated by cholic acid. Thus, enhanced hepatocellular concentrations of bile acids, due to the down-regulation of BSEP/SPGP-mediated efflux in FXR nullizygous mice, result in an alternate but apparent compensatory up-regulation of CYP3A, CYP2B, and some ABC transporters that is consistent with activation of PXR/SXR by bile acids.
The vectorial transport of bile salts from blood into bile is essential for the generation of bile flow, solubilization of cholesterol in bile, and emulsification of lipids in the intestine. Major transport proteins involved in the enterohepatic circulation of bile salts include the hepatocellular bile salt export pump (BSEP, ABCB11), the apical sodium-dependent bile salt transporter (ASBT, SLC10A2) in cholangiocytes and enterocytes, the sodium-dependent hepatocyte bile salt uptake system NTCP (SLC10A1), the organic anion transporting polypeptides OATP-C (SLC21A6), OATP8 (SLC21A8) and OATP-A (SLC21A3), and the multidrug resistance protein MRP3 (ABCC3). Synthesis and transport of bile salts are intricately linked processes that undergo extensive feedback and feed-forward regulation by transcriptional and posttranscriptional mechanisms. A key regulator of hepatocellular bile salt homeostasis is the bile acid receptor/farnesoid X receptor FXR, which activates transcription of the BSEP and OATP8 genes and of the small heterodimer partner 1 (SHP). SHP is a transcriptional repressor that mediates bile acid-induced repression of the bile salt uptake systems rat Ntcp and human OATP-C. A nuclear receptor that activates rodent Oatp2 (Slc21a5) and human MRP2 (ABCC2) is the pregnane X receptor/steroid X receptor PXR/SXR. Intracellular trafficking and membrane insertion of bile salt transporters is regulated by lipid, protein, and extracellular signal-related kinases in response to physiologic stimuli such as cyclic adenosine monophosphate or taurocholate. Finally, dysfunction of individual bile salt transporters such as BSEP, on account of genetic mutations, steric inhibition, suppression of gene expression, or disturbed signaling, is an important cause of cholestatic liver disease.
The induction of CYP2B gene expression by phenobarbital (PB) is mediated by the translocation of the constitutive androstane receptor (CAR) from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. The CAR/RXR heterodimer binds to two DR-4 sites in a complex phenobarbital responsive unit (PBRU) in the CYP2B gene. The short heterodimer partner (SHP), an orphan nuclear receptor that lacks a conventional DNA binding domain, was initially identified by its interaction with CAR. We have examined the role of SHP in CAR-mediated transactivation of the CYP2B gene. Coexpression of SHP inhibited the transactivation of the CYP2B gene by CAR in cultured hepatoma cells and the p160 coactivator GRIP1 reversed the inhibition. The interaction of CAR with SHP was confirmed by GST pulldown experiments. SHP did not block the binding of either CAR/RXR to the PBRU or binding of GRIP1 to the CAR/RXR complex in gel mobility shift assays, but slightly increased CAR/RXR binding and slightly altered the mobility of the CAR/RXR/GRIP1 complex, suggesting an interaction of SHP with these complexes. The presence of SHP in the complexes, however, could not be detected in an antibody supershift assay. Recombinant corepressors mSin3A, SMRT, and HDAC1, but not NCoR1, interacted with GST-SHP but each of these corepressors in liver nuclear extracts bound to GST-SHP. SMRT and NCoR1 inhibited CAR-mediated activation independent of SHP, but mSin3A and HDAC1 had little effect alone, and were additive with SHP. These studies demonstrate that SHP does not inhibit CAR-mediated trans-activation by interfering with DNA binding or by competition with GRIP1. Instead, SHP may either inhibit recruitment of other coactivators by GRIP1 or actively recruit corepressors directly to the CAR/RXR/PBRU complex.
The functional mapping of the human cytochrome P4502D6 (CYP2D6) promoter in HepG2 cells revealed the presence of both positive and negative regulatory elements. One of these regulatory elements overlapped a sequence that is highly conserved in most members of the CYP2 family. This element, which consists of a degenerate AGGTCA direct repeat spaced by 1 base pair (DR1) and is known to be a target for members of the steroid receptor superfamily, was found to bind in vitro translated hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 (HNF4) in gel retardation analysis. Using HepG2 nuclear extracts, three protein-DNA complexes were formed on the DR1 element, one of which was confirmed to be dependent on the binding of HNF4. The other DR1 complexes were shown to be due to the interaction of the orphan receptor chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter transcription factor I (COUP-TFI). Experiments in COS-7 cells showed that HNF4 could activate the CYP2D6 promoter 30-fold. Surprisingly, mutation of the DR1 element produced a relatively minor 23% decrease in activity in HepG2 cells. Additionally, COUP-TFI was shown to inhibit HNF4 stimulation of the CYP2D6 promoter in COS-7 cells, suggesting that COUP-TFI could attenuate the effect of HNF4 in HepG2 cells. However, when HNF4 levels were increased in HepG2 cells by co-transfection, it resulted in the enhancement of CYP2D6 promoter activity, indicating that HNF4 could overcome the repressive effect of COUP-TFI. Therefore, the contribution of the DR1 element in controlling the transcription of the CYP2D6 gene depends on the balance between positively and negatively acting transcription factors.
1,25 Dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25(OH)(2)D) regulates the differentiation of keratinocytes. 1,25(OH)(2)D raises intracellular free calcium (Cai) as a necessary early step toward stimulating differentiation. 1,25(OH)(2)D induces the calcium sensing receptor (CaR) in keratinocytes and enhances the calcium response of these cells. Activation of the CaR by calcium increases intracellular free calcium by a mechanism involving phospholipase C (PLC) cleavage of phosphatidylinositolbisphosphate into inositoltrisphosphate (IP(3)) and diacylglycerol (DG). 1,25(OH)(2)D induces the family of PLCs. PLC-gamma1 has a DR6 VDRE in its promoter which binds and is activated by VDR/RAR rather than VDR/RXR. The involucrin gene, which encodes a critical component of the cornified envelope, contains a DR3 VDRE in its promoter that acts in conjunction with a nearby AP-1 site. The sequential regulation of these genes is critical for the differentiation process. In undifferentiated keratinocytes, the VDR binds preferentially to the DRIP complex of coactivators. However, with differentiation DRIP 205 is no longer produced, and the VDR switches partners to the SRC family (SRC2 and 3). These studies suggest that at least part of the sequential activation of genes required during keratinocyte differentiation is regulated by the change (availability) of these different coactivator complexes.
The gene for cholesterol 7alpha-hydroxylase (CYP7A1) contains a sequence at nt -149 to -118 that was found to play a large role in determining the overall transcriptional activity and regulation of the promoter. Hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 (HNF4) and chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter transcription factor II (COUP-TFII) synergistically activate transcription of the CYP7A1 promoter. Transactivation of CYP7A1 by HNF4 in the human hepatoma cell line, HepG2, was enhanced by cotransfection with COUP-TFII or the basal transcription element binding protein (BTEB). HNF4 prepared from rat liver nuclear extracts bound to oligomers homologous to the nt -146 to -134 sequences in electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA), which corresponded to a conserved region containing a direct repeat of hormone response elements spaced by one nucleotide (DR1). The sequences surrounding this DR1 were found to be essential for the HNF4 transactivation. In vitro-translated COUP-TFII was found to bind the adjacent sequences from nt -139 to -128 (DR0), but COUP-TFII interacted with this region at a much lower affinity than to the COUP-TFII-site at nt -72 to -57 (DR4). Mutations at nt -139 to -128 or nt -72 to -57 reduced the COUP-TFII and HNF4 synergy; however, these COUP-TFII-binding sequences were not absolutely required for the cooperative effect of HNF4 and COUP-TFII on transactivation. These results indicated that the observed transactivation was the result of protein/protein interactions facilitated by the juxtaposition of the binding elements.
RAR-RXR heterodimeric complexes (RARalphaDeltaAB-RXRalphaDeltaAB) bound to cognate DR5 DNA response elements were purified to apparent structural and functional homogeneity using a novel versatile immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC) copurification procedure. Dynamic light scattering studies indicated that the complexes were more than 85% monodisperse. By electron microscopy the negatively stained RAR-RXR-DNA complexes appeared homogeneous and corresponded to a dimeric arrangement of the molecules. Using heterodimers purified according to this procedure we demonstrate ligand binding of RXR in the context of the RAR-RXR heterodimer-DNA complex. The present copurification procedure is rapid and has yielded high quality heterodimer-DNA complexes suitable for both structural and biochemical studies.
Hepatocyte nuclear factor 1alpha (HNF1alpha) and HNF4alpha are liver-selective transcription factors and are essential for hepatocyte differentiation. This study demonstrates that HNF1alpha as well as HNF4alpha genes contain a direct repeat with a space of one nucleotide (DR1)-retinoic acid (RA) response element that can be bound and regulated by RA and retinoid x receptor alpha (RXRalpha) complex. Transient transfection experiments showed that RA increased the promoter activity of the HNF1alpha and HNF4alpha genes in Hep3B cells. Overexpression of RXRalpha further enhanced the activities of both genes. Two putative RXRalpha binding sites on the HNF1alpha (-295 to -276) and HNF4alpha (-418 to -399) genes have been characterized. By transient transfection, both sites positively responded to RA, and overexpression of RXRalpha in Hep3B cells increased the regulatory effect. Gel mobility shift assay demonstrated that these two DR-1 sites could be bound by RXRalpha specifically. These data suggest that the differentiation effect of RA on hepatocyte may be due to direct interaction of RXRalpha with the RA-responsive elements on the HNF1alpha and HNF4alpha genes.
Peroxisome proliferator-activator receptors (PPAR) are involved in cholesterol homeostasis through the regulation of bile acids synthesis, composition, and reclamation. As ileal bile acid-binding protein (I-BABP) is thought to play a crucial role in the enterohepatic circulation of bile acids, we investigated whether I-BABP gene expression could also be affected by PPAR. Indeed, treatment with the PPARalpha-PPARbeta/delta agonist bezafibrate led to the up-regulation of I-BABP mRNA levels in the human intestine-derived Caco-2 cells. Cotransfections of the reporter-linked human I-BABP promoter (hI-BABP-2769/+44) together with PPAR and RXR expression vectors demonstrated that the fibrate-mediated induction of the I-BABP gene is dependent on PPARalpha or PPARbeta/delta. Using progressive 5' deletions of the hI-BABP promoter and sequence analysis, we identified a putative PPAR-binding site located at the position -198 and -186 upstream of the transcription initiation site. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays showed that the PPAR/RXR heterodimer can specifically bind to this PPRE-like motif. The deletion of the PPRE within the hI-BABP promoter abolished the PPAR-mediated transactivation in transient transfection assays. The regulation of the I-BABP promoter by PPAR appears species-specific, as the mouse I-BABP promoter, which lacks a conserved PPRE, was not responsive to exogenous PPAR expression in the presence of bezafibrate. Our findings show that the I-BABP gene may be a novel target for PPAR in humans and further emphasize the role for PPAR in the control of bile acid homeostasis.
The human multidrug resistance gene MDR3 encodes a P-glycoprotein that belongs to the ATP-binding cassette transporter family (ABCB4). MDR3 is a critical trans-locator for phospholipids across canalicular membranes of hepatocytes, evidenced by the fact that human MDR3 deficiencies result in progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis type III. It has been reported previously that MDR3 expression is modulated by hormones, cellular stress, and xenobiotics. Here we show that the MDR3 gene is trans-activated by the farnesoid X receptor (FXR) via a direct binding of FXR/retinoid X receptor alpha heterodimers to a highly conserved inverted repeat element (a FXR response element) at the distal promoter (-1970 to -1958). In FXR trans-activation assays, both the endogenous FXR agonist chenodeoxycholate and the synthetic agonist GW4064 activated the MDR3 promoter. Deletion or mutation of this inverted repeat element abolished FXR-mediated MDR3 promoter activation. Consistent with these data, MDR3 mRNA was significantly induced by both chenodeoxycholate and GW4064 in primary human hepatocytes in time- and dose-dependent fashions. In conclusion, we demonstrate that MDR3 expression is directly up-regulated by FXR. These results, together with the previous report that the bile salt export pump is a direct FXR target, suggest that FXR coordinately controls secretion of bile salts and phospholipids. Results of this study further support the notion that FXR is a master regulator of lipid metabolism.
BACKGROUND:
It has been hypothesised, mainly from studies with animal models of liver disease, that the transport of substrates for metabolic enzymes and their subsequent metabolism and elimination in hepatic bile or blood is co-ordinated, but there is little information on this process in diseased human liver.
METHODS:
In this study we have measured by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) major genes involved in drug metabolism from UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGT1A1, UGT1A6, UGT1A9, and UGT2B4) and cytochrome P450 (CYP) families (CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, and CYP3A4), transport (OATP-C, MRP2, MRP3, and MDR1) and major transcription factors (PXR, CAR, HNF1alpha, HNF4alpha, RXR, and AHR) involved in their regulation. Liver biopsy tissue from patients with viral hepatitis was scored for inflammation and fibrosis by the METAVIR system, and separated into groups with mild (A0-1; F0-1, n = 20) or severe (A2-3; F3-4, n = 19) liver disease. Correlation analysis (Spearman rank-test, P &lt; 0.05) was used to identify metabolic enzymes and transporters which shared significant correlation with transcription factors.
RESULTS:
Our results show an extensive correlation between transcription factors, transporters, and metabolic enzymes. An unexpected finding was that this was substantially greater in the severely diseased liver. Cross-talk between transcription factors was markedly increased in tissue from patients with severe liver disease, particularly between CAR, HNF4alpha, and PXR.
CONCLUSION:
Our results support the hypothesis of co-ordinate regulation of metabolic enzymes and transporters in diseased human liver, as part of a widespread co-ordinated process under the control of nuclear receptor transcription factors.
Multidrug resistance-associated proteins 2-4 (MRP2-4) are membrane efflux transporters critical for the hepatic clearance of pharmaceuticals and endogenous chemicals. Little is known about the constitutive regulation of MRP2-4 mRNA in normal human liver. The purpose of this study was to identify transcription factors whose expression significantly correlates with MRP2-4 mRNA in human liver specimens. Ninety adult human livers were profiled for mRNA expression of MRP2-4 as well as aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), constitutive androstane receptor (CAR), pregnane X receptor (PXR), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPAR alpha) and gamma (gamma), liver X receptor alpha (LXR alpha), farnesoid X receptor (FXR), glucocorticoid receptor (GR), retinoid X receptor alpha (RXR alpha), hepatocyte nuclear factor 1 alpha (HNF1 alpha) and 4 alpha (4 alpha), and nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) transcription factors. Using linear regression and stepwise selection of partial R(2)-values, CAR, HNF1 alpha, and PPAR alpha mRNA exhibited the greatest correlation with MRP2, 3, and 4, respectively. Interindividual variation in the expression of the identified transcription factors may account for the variability in constitutive mRNA levels of MRP2-4. The multivariate approach presented in this study should aid in predicting signalling pathways that participate either directly or indirectly in regulating hepatic drug disposition.
Hepatobiliary transporters are down-regulated in toxic and cholestatic liver injury. Cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin 1 beta (IL-1 beta) are attributed to mediate this regulation, but their particular contribution in vivo is still unknown. Thus, we studied the molecular mechanisms by which Ntcp, Oatp1, Oatp2, and Mrp2 are regulated by proinflammatory cytokines during liver injury. Rats were injected intraperitoneally with either carbon tetrachloride or endotoxin. Inactivation of TNF-alpha and IL-1 beta was achieved by repetitive intraperitoneal injection of etanercept and anakinra, respectively. Messenger RNA (mRNA) levels of transporters and binding activities as well as nuclear protein levels of Ntcp, Oatp2, and Mrp2 transactivators were determined 20 to 24 hours later. In contrast to IL-1 beta, TNF-alpha inactivation alone fully prevented down-regulation of Ntcp, Oatp1, and Oatp2 mRNA as well as reduced binding activity of hepatocyte nuclear factor 1 (HNF-1) in CCl(4)-induced toxic injury. In endotoxemia, down-regulation of Mrp2, and partially in case of Ntcp, could be prevented by IL-1 beta but not TNF-alpha blockade. However, inactivation of either cytokine led to preservation of HNF1 and partially of retinoid X receptor/retinoic acid receptor (RXR/RAR) binding activity. No effect of anticytokines was seen on pregnane X receptor (PXR) and constitutive androstane receptor (CAR) binding activity as well as nuclear protein mass. In conclusion, TNF-alpha represents the master cytokine responsible for HNF1-dependent down-regulation of Ntcp, Oatp1, and Oatp2 in CCl(4)-induced toxic liver injury. IL-1 beta predominates in a complex signaling network of Ntcp and Mrp2 regulation in cholestatic liver injury. In contrast to in vitro studies, HNF1 and RXR/RAR-independent mechanisms appear to be more important in regulation of Mrp2 and Ntcp gene expression in endotoxemia.
The multidrug resistance-associated protein 3 (MRP3) is a multispecific anion transporter that is capable of transporting a number of conjugated and unconjugated bile acids. Expression of the MRP3 gene is increased during pathological states associated with elevated bile acid concentrations indicating a role for this transporter in adaptive and homeostatic bile acid metabolism. Analysis of Mrp3 mRNA levels in various mouse tissues with known relevance and/or exposure to bile acids revealed the highest levels of basal expression in the colon followed in order by the liver, duodenum, jejunum, ileum, and kidney. Functional analysis of a murine Mrp3 promoter reporter construct revealed vitamin D receptor (VDR)-dependent activation by 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) (VD3), 9-cis-retinoic acid (RA), and the cholestatic secondary bile acid, lithocholic acid (LCA). Using a series of deletion constructs combined with sequence analysis, a candidate VDR response element (VDRE) was identified between -1028 and -1014 bp of the Mrp3 promoter. Activation of the Mrp3 promoter in response to VD3, RA, or LCA, as well as binding of VDR/RXR heterodimers, was attenuated substantially by mutation of this VDRE. Treatment of mice with VD3 or LCA demonstrated in vivo modulation of the Mrp3 gene in colon but not in the liver. Reduction of endogenous VDR expression in colon adenocarcinoma MCA-38 cells by siRNA transfection was associated with reduced constitutive and inducible expression of the Mrp3 gene. These data support a regulatory role for the VDR in the protection of colon cells from bile acid toxicity through regulation of the Mrp3 expression.
The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) and NF-E2 p45-related factor (NRF2) are two distinct transcription factors involved in the regulation of drug-metabolizing enzymes. Increasing evidence from several studies implies that AHR and NRF2 have direct links, but the molecular mechanism remains unknown. In this work we demonstrate for the first time that Nrf2 gene transcription is directly modulated by AHR activation. DNA sequence analyses of the mouse Nrf2 promoter revealed one xenobiotic response element (XRE)-like element (XREL1) located at -712 and two additional XRE-like elements located at +755 (XREL2) and +850 (XREL3). Functional analysis using luciferase assay showed that XREL1, XREL2, and XREL3 are all inducible by 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin treatment, with XREL2 being the most potent. The functionality of these XRE-like elements was further confirmed by mutagenesis and gel shift experiments. Finally, we used chromatin immunoprecipitation assay to show a direct binding of AHR to the Nrf2 promoter. Cells with silenced AHR expression using siRNA also lost NRF2 mRNA induction by 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin. These new data position NRF2-antioxidant response element downstream in the AHR-XRE pathway. Moreover, direct regulation of NRF2 by AHR contributes to couple phase I and II enzymes into an integrated system facilitating more effective xenobiotic and carcinogen detoxification.
In this minireview, the role of various nuclear receptors and transcription factors in the expression of drug disposition genes is summarized. Specifically, the molecular aspects and functional impact of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), nuclear factor-E2 p45-related factor 2 (N(r)f2), hepatocyte nuclear factor 1alpha (HNF1alpha), constitutive androstane receptor (LAR), pregnane X receptor (PXR), farnesoid X receptor (FXR), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPAR(alpha)), hepatocyte nuclear factor 4alpha (HNF4alpha), vitamin D receptor (VDR), liver receptor homolog 1 (LRH1), liver X receptor (LXR(alpha)), small heterodimer partner-1 (SHP-1), and glucocorticoid receptor (GR) on gene expression are detailed. Finally, we discuss some current topics and themes in nuclear receptor-mediated regulation of drug metabolizing enzymes and drug transporters.
BACKGROUND &amp; AIMS:
OATP8 (gene symbol: SLC21A8) is a multispecific uptake system for organic anions, xenobiotics, and peptides expressed at the basolateral (sinusoidal) membrane of human hepatocytes. We investigated whether OATP8 gene expression is regulated by the nuclear receptors farnesoid X receptor/bile acid receptor (FXR/BAR; NR1H4), pregnane X receptor (PXR), or liver X receptor (LXR).
METHODS:
OATP8 promoter function was studied in reporter assays. OATP8 expression in cells was quantitated by real-time polymerase chain reaction.
RESULTS:
The bile acid chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA), a ligand of FXR/BAR, but not clotrimazole or 25-hydroxycholesterol, ligands of PXR or LXR, respectively, induced OATP8 promoter activity. An inverted hexanucleotide repeat motif (IR-1 element) in the promoter sequence was shown by electrophoretic mobility shift assays to bind the FXR (9-cis-retinoic acid receptor [RXRalpha]) heterodimer. Targeted mutagenesis of the IR-1 element abolished inducibility of the OATP8 promoter by CDCA, confirming its role as a bile acid response element. CDCA treatment increased OATP8 messenger RNA levels in human hepatoma cells, suggesting a physiologic role for FXR-mediated OATP8 gene regulation.
CONCLUSIONS:
OATP8 gene expression is regulated by bile acids via FXR/BAR. Induction of OATP8 could serve to maintain hepatic extraction of xenobiotics and peptides in conditions of increased intracellular bile acids.
The vectorial transport of bile salts from blood into bile is essential for the generation of bile flow, solubilization of cholesterol in bile, and emulsification of lipids in the intestine. Major transport proteins involved in the enterohepatic circulation of bile salts include the hepatocellular bile salt export pump (BSEP, ABCB11), the apical sodium-dependent bile salt transporter (ASBT, SLC10A2) in cholangiocytes and enterocytes, the sodium-dependent hepatocyte bile salt uptake system NTCP (SLC10A1), the organic anion transporting polypeptides OATP-C (SLC21A6), OATP8 (SLC21A8) and OATP-A (SLC21A3), and the multidrug resistance protein MRP3 (ABCC3). Synthesis and transport of bile salts are intricately linked processes that undergo extensive feedback and feed-forward regulation by transcriptional and posttranscriptional mechanisms. A key regulator of hepatocellular bile salt homeostasis is the bile acid receptor/farnesoid X receptor FXR, which activates transcription of the BSEP and OATP8 genes and of the small heterodimer partner 1 (SHP). SHP is a transcriptional repressor that mediates bile acid-induced repression of the bile salt uptake systems rat Ntcp and human OATP-C. A nuclear receptor that activates rodent Oatp2 (Slc21a5) and human MRP2 (ABCC2) is the pregnane X receptor/steroid X receptor PXR/SXR. Intracellular trafficking and membrane insertion of bile salt transporters is regulated by lipid, protein, and extracellular signal-related kinases in response to physiologic stimuli such as cyclic adenosine monophosphate or taurocholate. Finally, dysfunction of individual bile salt transporters such as BSEP, on account of genetic mutations, steric inhibition, suppression of gene expression, or disturbed signaling, is an important cause of cholestatic liver disease.</PRE>
