Investigating intestinal physiology in vitro remains challenging due to the lack of an effective primary enterocyte culture system. Recently developed protocols for growing organoids containing crypts and villus from adult mouse intestinal epithelium in Matrigel present an attractive alternative to the classical techniques. However, these approaches require the use of sophisticated and expensive serum-free medium supplemented with epithelial growth factor (EGF), Wnt agonist (R-spondin 1), and bone morphogenetic protein inhibitor (Noggin) in high concentrations. Here we demonstrate that is possible to use an isolated chicken embryonic intestinal epithelium to create such an organoid culture. Structures formed in Matrigel matrix in the first two days following isolation survive and enlarge during ensuing weeks. They have the appearance of empty spheres and comprise cells expressing cytokeratin (an epithelial cell marker), villin (a marker of enterocytes), and Sox-9 (a transcription factor characteristic of progenitors and stem cells of intestinal crypts). With chicken embryonic tissue as a source of organoids, prostaglandin E2 is as effective as R-spondin 1 and Noggin in promoting sustained growth and survival of epithelial spheroids. The α2-adrenoceptor antagonist, yohimbine, is commonly used as a pharmacological stressor. Its behavioural effects are typically attributed to elevated noradrenaline release via blockade of central, inhibitory autoreceptors. We have previously reported that yohimbine increases motor impulsivity in rats on the five-choice serial reaction time task (5CSRTT), a cognitive behavioural assessment which measures motor impulsivity and visuospatial attention. Furthermore, this effect depended on cyclic adenomonophosphate (cAMP) signalling via cAMP response element binding (CREB) protein in the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC). However, the role of specific adrenoceptors in this effect is not well-characterized. We therefore investigated whether the pro-impulsive effects of systemic yohimbine could be reproduced by direct administration into the OFC, or attenuated by intra-OFC or systemic administration of prazosin and propranolol-antagonists at the α1- and β-adrenoceptor, respectively. Male Long-Evans rats were trained on the 5CSRTT and implanted with guide cannulae aimed at the OFC. Systemically administered α1- or β-adrenoceptor antagonists attenuated yohimbine-induced increases in premature responding. In contrast, local infusion of yohimbine into the OFC reduced such impulsive responding, while blockade of α1- or β-adrenoceptors within the OFC had no effect on either basal or yohimbine-stimulated motor impulsivity. Direct administration of selective antagonists at the α1-, α2- or β-adrenoceptor into the OFC therefore produce clearly dissociable effects from systemic administration. Collectively, these data suggest that the pro-impulsivity effect of yohimbine can be modulated by adrenergic signalling in brain areas outside of the OFC, in addition to non-adrenergic signalling pathways within the OFC. Remote limb ischemic post conditioning (RIPOC) has been reported to attenuate cerebral ischemic reperfusion (I/R) injury, while the molecular mechanisms remain elusive. Various studies have highlighted the involvement of glycogen synthase kinase (GSK-3β) in cerebral I/R injury and cognitive disorders. Hence, the present study was designed to explore the role of GSK-3β and its downstream regulators in RIPOC mediated neuroprotection against cerebral I/R injury and associated cognitive impairment. Male Wistar rats are randomly assigned into four groups: Sham, bilateral common carotid arteries occlusion (BCCAO), RIPOC and BCCAO+RIPOC. BCCAO was achieved by transient occlusion of bilateral common carotid arteries for 20min, followed by reperfusion. Non-invasive RIPOC was induced by 3 cycles each of 10min occlusion and reperfusion of both femoral arteries by using tourniquets, during early reperfusion phase. A battery of behavioral and cognitive tests were performed. Biochemical estimation of oxidative markers, anti-oxidants and pro-inflammatory markers were estimated. Levels of GSK-3β, CREB and BDNF were estimated to confirm the molecular mechanism. Hippocampal structural abnormalities were confirmed by H and E staining. The neurobehavioral analysis revealed that neurological and cognitive deficits caused by BCCAO, were reduced by RIPOC intervention. Meanwhile, the results of biochemical tests suggested that RIPOC attenuates the BCCAO induced oxidative damage, neuroinflammation and hippocampal structural abnormalities. Further, RIPOC prevented the elevation of BCCAO induced GSK-3β. RIPOC exerts neuroprotective effect against I/R injury, putatively by attenuating GSK-3β expression and upregulating the levels of CREB and BDNF. Z-guggulsterone, an active compound extracted from the gum resin of the tree commiphora mukul, has been shown to improve animal memory deficits via activating the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) signaling pathway. Here, we investigated the antidepressant-like effect of Z-guggulsterone in a chronic unpredictable stress (CUS) mouse model of depression. The effects of Z-guggulsterone were assessed in mice tail suspension test (TST), forced swimming test (FST). Z-guggulsterone was also investigated in the CUS model of depression with fluoxetine as the positive control. Changes in hippocampal neurogenesis as well as the BDNF signaling pathway after CUS/Z-guggulsterone treatment were investigated. The tryptophan hydroxylase inhibitor and the tyrosine kinase B inhibitor were also used to explore the antidepressant-like mechanisms of Z-guggulsterone. Z-guggulsterone (10, 30 mg/kg) administration protected the mice against the CUS-induced increases in the immobile time in the TST and FST, and also reversed the reduction in sucrose intake in sucrose preference experiment. Z-guggulsterone (10, 30 mg/kg) administration prevented the reductions in BDNF protein expression levels, as well as the phosphorylation levels of cAMP response element binding protein (CREB), extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) and protein kinase B (Akt) in the hippocampus and cortex induced by CUS. Z-guggulsterone (10, 30 mg/kg) treatment also improved hippocampal neurogenesis in CUS-treated mice. Blockade of the BDNF signal, but not the monoaminergic system, attenuated the antidepressant-like effects of Z-guggulsterone. Z-guggulsterone exhibits antidepressant activity via activation of the BDNF signaling pathway and up-regulation of hippocampal neurogenesis. Membrane microdomains or "lipid rafts" have emerged as essential functional modules of the cell, critical for the regulation of growth factor receptor-mediated responses. Herein we describe the dichotomy between caveolin-1 and caveolin-2, structural and regulatory components of microdomains, in modulating proliferation and differentiation. Caveolin-2 potentiates while caveolin-1 inhibits nerve growth factor (NGF) signaling and subsequent cell differentiation. Caveolin-2 does not appear to impair NGF receptor trafficking but elicits prolonged and stronger activation of MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase), Rsk2 (ribosomal protein S6 kinase 2), and CREB (cAMP response element binding protein). In contrast, caveolin-1 does not alter initiation of the NGF signaling pathway activation; rather, it acts, at least in part, by sequestering the cognate receptors, TrkA and p75(NTR), at the plasma membrane, together with the phosphorylated form of the downstream effector Rsk2, which ultimately prevents CREB phosphorylation. The non-phosphorylatable caveolin-1 serine 80 mutant (S80V), no longer inhibits TrkA trafficking or subsequent CREB phosphorylation. MC192, a monoclonal antibody towards p75(NTR) that does not block NGF binding, prevents exit of both NGF receptors (TrkA and p75(NTR)) from lipid rafts. The results presented herein underline the role of caveolin and receptor signaling complex interplay in the context of neuronal development and tumorigenesis. Clozapine is an atypical antipsychotic, that is established as the treatment of choice for treatment-resistant schizophrenia (SCZ). To date, no study investigating comprehensive DNA methylation changes in SCZ patients treated with chronic clozapine has been reported. The purpose of the present study is to reveal the effects of clozapine on DNA methylation in treatment-resistant SCZ. We conducted a genome-wide DNA methylation profiling in peripheral leukocytes (485,764 CpG dinucleotides) from treatment-resistant SCZ patients treated with clozapine (n = 21) in a longitudinal study. Significant changes in DNA methylation were observed at 29,134 sites after one year of treatment with clozapine, and these genes were enriched for "cell substrate adhesion" and "cell matrix adhesion" gene ontology (GO) terms. Furthermore, DNA methylation changes in the CREBBP (CREB binding protein) gene were significantly correlated with the clinical improvements. Our findings provide insights into the action of clozapine in treatment-resistant SCZ. p65 is a member of the NF-κB family of transcriptional regulatory proteins that functions as the activating component of the p65-p50 heterodimer. Through its acidic transactivation domain (TAD), p65 has the capacity to form interactions with several different transcriptional regulatory proteins, including TFIIB, TFIIH, CREB-binding protein (CBP)/p300 and TAFII31. Like other acidic TADs, the p65 TAD contains two subdomains (p65TA1 and p65TA2) that interact with different regulatory factors depending on the target gene. Despite its role in controlling numerous NF-κB target genes, there are no high-resolution structures of p65TA1 bound to a target transcriptional regulatory factor. In this work, we characterize the interaction of p65TA1 with two factors, the Tfb1/p62 subunit of TFIIH and the KIX domain of CBP. In these complexes, p65TA1 transitions into a helical conformation that includes its characteristic ΦXXΦΦ motif (Φ = hydrophobic amino acid). Structural and functional studies demonstrate that the two binding interfaces are primarily stabilized by three hydrophobic amino acids within the ΦXXΦΦ motif and these residues are also crucial to its ability to activate transcription. Taken together, the results provide an atomic level description of how p65TA1 is able to bind different transcriptional regulatory factors needed to activate NF-κB target genes. The mechanisms that trigger retinal degeneration are not well understood, despite the availability of several animal models with different mutations. In the present report, the rd10 mouse, a model for retinitis pigmentosa (RP) that contains a mutation in the gene for PDE6β (Pde6b), is used to evaluate gliosis, as a marker for retinal stress, and cyclic AMP response element binding protein (CREB) phosphorylation, which may be important early in retinal degeneration. Wild-type C57Bl6J and rd10 mice raised under cyclic light were examined for changes in gliosis and CREB phosphorylation for approximately 3 weeks beginning at P14 to P17 using immunocytochemistry. Mice raised under normal cyclic light and in complete darkness were also compared for changes in CREB phosphorylation. Gliosis in rd10 mice raised under cyclic light was apparent at P17, before extensive degeneration of the photoreceptor layer is visible, and increased over time. Phosphorylation of CREB at Ser133 (pCREB) was detected in Müller glia (MG) in the wild-type and rd10 mice. However, at all phases of photoreceptor degeneration, the pCREB levels were lower in the rd10 mice. We also observed extensive migration of MG cell bodies to the outer nuclear layer (ONL) during degeneration. In contrast to the mice raised under cyclic light, the rd10 mice raised in the dark exhibited slower rates of degeneration. When the dark-reared mice were exposed to cyclic light, the photoreceptor layer degenerated within 4 days to approximately one to two rows of nuclei. Interestingly, the pCREB levels in the MG also decreased during this 4-day cyclic light exposure compared to the levels in the rd10 mice raised continuously in the dark. The results of these studies suggest that photoreceptors communicate directly or indirectly with MG at early stages, inducing gliosis before extensive retinal degeneration is apparent in rd10 mice. Surprisingly, phosphorylation of CREB is downregulated in the MG. These results raise the interesting possibility that Müller glia undergo CREB-mediated transcriptional changes that influence photoreceptor degeneration either positively or negatively. Unlike canine models of RP, no increase in pCREB was observed in photoreceptor cells during this period suggesting possible mechanistic differences in the role of CREB in photoreceptors between these species. In this study, we investigated whether alterations in plasticity markers such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75(NTR)) and tyrosine receptor kinase B (TrkB) are underlying iron deficiency (ID)-induced cognitive impairments in iron depleted piglets. Newborn piglets were either fed an iron-depleted diet (21mg Fe/kg) or an iron-sufficient diet (88mg Fe/kg) for four weeks. Subsequently, eight weeks after iron repletion (190-240mg Fe/kg) we found a significant decrease in mature BDNF (14kDa) and proBDNF (18kDa and 24kDa) protein levels in the ventral hippocampus, whereas we found increases in the dorsal hippocampus. The phosphorylation of cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) follows the mature BDNF protein level pattern. No effects were found on BDNF and CREB protein levels in the prefrontal cortex. The protein levels of the high affinity BDNF receptor, TrkB, was significantly decreased in both dorsal and ventral hippocampus of ID piglets, whereas it was increased in the prefrontal cortex. Together, our data suggest a disrupted hippocampal plasticity upon postnatal ID. The pesticide mancozeb (mz) is recognized as a potent inducer of oxidative stress due to its ability to catalyze the production of reactive oxygen species plus inhibiting mitochondrial respiration thus becoming an environmental risk for neurodegenerative diseases. Despite numerous toxicological studies on mz have been directed to mammals, attention on marine fish is still lacking. Thus, it was our intention to evaluate neurobehavioral activities of ornate wrasses (Thalassoma pavo) exposed to 0.2mg/l of mz after a preliminary screening test (0.07-0.3mg/l). Treated fish exhibited an evident (p<0.001) latency to reach T-maze arms (>1000%) while exploratory attitudes (total arm entries) diminished (-50%; p<0.05) versus controls during spontaneous exploration tests. Moreover, they showed evident enhancements (+111%) of immobility in the cylinder test. Contextually, strong (-88%; p<0.01) reductions of permanence in light zone of the Light/Dark apparatus along with diminished crossings (-65%) were also detected. Conversely, wrasses displayed evident enhancements (160%) of risk assessment consisting of fast entries in the dark side of this apparatus. From a molecular point of view, a notable activation (p<0.005) of the brain transcription factor pCREB occurred during mz-exposure. Similarly, in situ hybridization supplied increased HSP90 mRNAs in most brain areas such as the lateral part of the dorsal telencephalon (Dl; +68%) and valvula of the cerebellum (VCe; +35%) that also revealed evident argyrophilic signals. Overall, these first indications suggest a possible protective role of the early biomarkers pCREB and HSP90 against fish toxicity. Bulleyaconitine (BAA) has been shown to possess antinociceptive activities by stimulation of dynorphin A release from spinal microglia. This study investigated its underlying signal transduction mechanisms. The data showed that (1) BAA treatment induced phosphorylation of CREB (rather than NF-κB) and prodynorphin expression in cultured primary microglia, and antiallodynia in neuropathy, which were totally inhibited by the CREB inhibitor KG-501; (2) BAA upregulated phosphorylation of p38 (but not ERK or JNK), and the p38 inhibitor SB203580 (but not ERK or JNK inhibitor) and p38β gene silencer siRNA/p38β (but not siRNA/p38α) completely blocked BAA-induced p38 phosphorylation and/or prodynorphin expression, and antiallodynia; (3) BAA stimulated cAMP production and PKA phosphorylation, and the adenylate cyclase inhibitor DDA and PKA inhibitor H-89 entirely antagonized BAA-induced prodynorphin expression and antiallodynia; (4) The Gs-protein inhibitor NF449 completely inhibited BAA-increased cAMP level, prodynorphin expression and antiallodynia, whereas the antagonists of noradrenergic, corticotrophin-releasing factor, A1 adenosine, formyl peptide, D1/D2 dopamine, and glucagon like-peptide-1 receptors failed to block BAA-induced antiallodynia. The data indicate that BAA-induced microglial expression of prodynorphin is mediated by activation of the cAMP-PKA-p38β-CREB signaling pathway, suggesting that its possible target is a Gs-protein-coupled receptor - "aconitine receptor", although the chemical identity is not illustrated. The type 2 inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (IP3R2) is the principal intracellular Ca(2+) release channel in hepatocytes, and so is important for bile secretion and other functions. IP3R2 activity is regulated in part by post-translational modifications but little is known about transcriptional regulation of its expression. We found that both IP3R2 mRNA and protein levels in liver were increased during fasting. Treatment of hepatocytes with forskolin or 8-CPT-cAMP also increased IP3R2, and this was reduced by actinomycin D. Analysis of the IP3R2 promoter revealed five CREs, and CREB potently increased promoter activity. Mutation of CRE4 or CRE5 decreased induction by CREB, and ChIP assay showed recruitment of CREB to these sites. Adenylyl cyclase (AC) 6 and 9 were the principal AC isoforms detected in rat hepatocytes, and silencing either one decreased organic anion secretion, which depends on IP3R2. Secretion furthermore was increased by overnight but not acute treatment with forskolin or 8-CPT-cAMP. These findings provide evidence that IP3R2 expression is transcriptionally regulated by cAMP via CREB binding to CRE elements in its promoter. The findings furthermore suggest that this mechanism is relevant for hormonal regulation of bile secretion. Cancer-induced bone pain (CIBP) remains a major challenge in advanced cancer patients due to our lack of understanding of its mechanisms. Previous studies have demonstrated the vital role of GABAB receptors (GABABRs) in regulating nociception and various neuropathic pain models have shown diminished activity of GABABRs. However, the role of spinal GABABRs in CIBP remains largely unknown. In this study, we investigated the specific cellular mechanisms of GABABRs in the development and maintenance of CIBP in rats. Our behavioral results show that both acute and chronic intrathecal treatment with baclofen, a GABABR agonist, significantly attenuated CIBP-induced mechanical allodynia and ambulatory pain. The expression levels of GABABRs were significantly decreased in a time-dependent manner and colocalized mostly with neuron and a minority with astrocyte and microglia. Chronic treatment with baclofen restored the expression of GABABRs and markedly inhibited the activation of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) and the cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB) signaling pathway. Our findings provide the first evidence that downregulation of GABABRs contribute to the development and maintenance of CIBP and restore diminished GABABRs attenuates CIBP-induced pain behaviors at least partially by inhibiting the PKA/CREB signaling pathway. Therefore, spinal GABABR may become a potential therapeutic target for the management of CIBP. The cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) - protein kinase A (PKA) signaling pathway plays important role in regulating energy homeostasis. Many of the effects of the cAMP-PKA signaling is mediated through the cAMP responsive element binding protein (CREB) and its coactivator CREB-regulated transcription coactivators (CRTCs). CRTC3 is a member of CRTCs family proteins and plays important roles in glucose and energy metabolism. Previous studies shown that global knockout of CRTC3 enhances oxygen consumption and energy expenditure and subsequently protects the knockout animal against obesity. In skeletal muscle, CRTC3 affects lipid and glycogen metabolism and mitochondrial biogenesis. In white adipocytes, CRTC3 regulates GLUT4 expression and glucose uptake. More recently, the localization and function of CRTC3 in brown fat have been reported. In this review, we mainly discuss the regulatory role of CRTC3 in skeletal muscle and adipose tissues.

Therefore, identification of novel fast-onset antidepressants is desirable. GLO1 is a ubiquitous cellular enzyme responsible for the detoxification of the glycolytic byproduct methylglyoxal (MG). We have previously shown that MG is a competitive partial agonist at GABA-A receptors. We examined the effects of genetic and pharmacological inhibition of GLO1 in two antidepressant assay models: the tail suspension test (TST) and the forced swim test (FST). We also examined the effects of GLO1 inhibition in three models of antidepressant onset: the chronic FST (cFST), chronic mild stress (CMS) paradigm and olfactory bulbectomy (OBX). Genetic knockdown of Glo1 or pharmacological inhibition using two structurally distinct GLO1 inhibitors (S-bromobenzylglutathione cyclopentyl diester (pBBG) or methyl-gerfelin (MeGFN)) reduced immobility in the TST and acute FST. Both GLO1 inhibitors also reduced immobility in the cFST after 5 days of treatment. In contrast, the serotonin reuptake inhibitor fluoxetine (FLX) reduced immobility after 14, but not 5 days of treatment. Furthermore, 5 days of treatment with either GLO1 inhibitor blocked the depression-like effects induced by CMS on the FST and coat state, and attenuated OBX-induced locomotor hyperactivity. Finally, 5 days of treatment with a GLO1 inhibitor (pBBG), but not FLX, induced molecular markers of the antidepressant response including brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) induction and increased phosphorylated cyclic-AMP response-binding protein (pCREB) to CREB ratio in the hippocampus and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). Our findings indicate that GLO1 inhibitors may provide a novel and fast-acting pharmacotherapy for depression.Molecular Psychiatry advance online publication, 21 March 2017; doi:10.1038/mp.2017.14. Insufficient production of nerve growth factor (NGF) is implicated in Parkinson's disease (PD). We recently discovered that caffeic acid derivative N-propargyl caffeamide (PACA) not only potentiated NGF-induced neurite outgrowth but also attenuated 6-hydroxydopamine neurotoxicity in neuronal culture. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether PACA could increase NGF levels against 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1, 2, 3, 6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) neurotoxicity in a mouse PD model. We induced parkinsonism in mice by intraperitoneal injection of MPTP for seven consecutive days. Animal motor functions were assessed by rotarod test and pole test. Our results showed that PACA ameliorated motor impairments in MPTP-challenged mice. Based on Western blot analysis and/or immunofluorescence staining of NGF and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), PACA preserved TH levels in the midbrain substantia nigra pars compacta. PACA also increased NGF expression while it decreased proNGF accumulation. Interestingly, NGF was widely induced in the midbrains including astrocytes. To elucidate the mechanisms by which PACA induces NGF, we focused on the effects of PACA on two neurotrophic signaling pathways, the PI3K and MEK pathways. We found that PACA induced the phosphorylation of Akt, ERK, and CREB against MPTP-mediated alterations. Importantly, PACA increased NGF levels and subsequently induced TrkA activation in MPTP-treated mice. Consistently, PACA also increased NGF levels in dopaminergic PC12 cells and primary rat midbrain neurons against N-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium iodide (MPP(+)) toxicity. ERK and PI3K inhibitors attenuated the effects of PACA on NGF levels. Collectively, our results suggest that PACA may rescue NGF insufficiency via sequential activation of PI3K/Akt, ERK1/2, and CREB signaling pathways. Graphical Abstract ᅟ. Combinations of neuronal determinants and/or small-molecules such as Forskolin (Fk) can be used to convert different cell types into neurons. As Fk is known to activate cAMP-dependent pathways including CREB-activity, we aimed here to determine the role of CREB in reprogramming - including its temporal profile. We show that transient expression of the dominant-positive CREB-VP16 followed by its inactivation mediated by the dominant-negative ICER improves neuronal conversion of astrocytes mediated by the neurogenic determinant Ascl1. Contrarily, persistent over-activation by CREB-VP16 or persistent inhibition by ICER interferes with neuronal reprogramming, with the latter enhancing cell death. Taken together our work shows transient CREB activation as a key effector in neuronal reprogramming. Shati/Nat8L significantly increased in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) of mice after repeated methamphetamine (METH) treatment. We reported that Shati/Nat8L overexpression in mouse NAc attenuated METH-induced hyperlocomotion, locomotor sensitization, and conditioned place preference. We recently found that Shati/Nat8L overexpression in NAc regulates the dopaminergic neuronal system via the activation of group II mGluRs by elevated N-acetylaspartylglutamate following N-acetylaspartate increase due to the overexpression. These findings suggest that Shati/Nat8L suppresses METH-induced responses. However, the mechanism by which METH increases the Shati/Nat8L mRNA expression in NAc is unclear. To investigate the regulatory mechanism of Shati/Nat8L mRNA expression, we performed a mouse Shati/Nat8L luciferase assay using PC12 cells. Next, we investigated the response of METH to Shati/Nat8L expression and CREB activity using mouse brain slices of NAc, METH administration to mice, and western blotting for CREB activity of specific dopamine receptor signals in vivo and ex vivo. We found that METH activates CREB binding to the Shati/Nat8L promoter to induce the Shati/Nat8L mRNA expression. Furthermore, the dopamine D1 receptor antagonist SCH23390, but not the dopamine D2 receptor antagonist sulpiride, inhibited the upregulation of Shati/Nat8L and CREB activities in the mouse NAc slices. Thus, the administration of the dopamine D1 receptor agonist SKF38393 increased the Shati/Nat8L mRNA expression in mouse NAc. These results showed that the Shati/Nat8L mRNA was increased by METH-induced CREB pathway via dopamine D1 receptor signaling in mouse NAc. These findings may contribute to development of a clinical tool for METH addiction. Metabolic dysfunction accompanying traumatic brain injury (TBI) severely impairs the ability of injured neurons to comply with functional demands. This limits the success of rehabilitative strategies by compromising brain plasticity and function, and highlights the need for early interventions to promote energy homeostasis. We sought to examine whether the TrkB agonist, 7,8-dihydroxyflavone (7,8-DHF) normalizes brain energy deficits and restablishes more normal patterns of functional connectivity, while enhancing the effects of exercise during post-TBI period. Moderate fluid percussion injury (FPI) was performed and 7,8-DHF (5mg/kg, i.p.) was administered in animals subjected to FPI that either had access to voluntary wheel running for 7days after injury or were sedentary. Compared to sham-injured controls, TBI resulted in reduced hippocampal activation of the BDNF receptor TrkB and associated CREB, reduced levels of plasticity markers GAP-43 and Syn I, as well as impaired memory as indicated by the Barnes maze task. While 7,8-DHF treatment and exercise individually mitigated TBI-induced effects, administration of 7,8-DHF concurrently with exercise facilitated memory performance and augmented levels of markers of cell energy metabolism viz., PGC-1α, COII and AMPK. In parallel to these findings, resting-state functional MRI (fMRI) acquired at 2weeks after injury showed that 7,8-DHF with exercise enhanced hippocampal functional connectivity, and suggests 7,8-DHF and exercise to promote increases in functional connectivity. Together, these findings indicate that post-injury 7,8-DHF treatment promotes enhanced levels of cell metabolism, synaptic plasticity in combination with exercise increases in brain circuit function that facilitates greater physical rehabilitation after TBI. NRF2 (nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2) is a key transcriptional activator that mediates the inducible expression of antioxidant genes. NRF2 is normally ubiquitinated by KEAP1 (Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1) and subsequently degraded by proteasomes. Inactivation of KEAP1 by oxidative stress or electrophilic chemicals allows NRF2 to activate transcription through binding to antioxidant response elements (AREs) and recruiting histone acetyltransferase CBP (CREB-binding protein). While KEAP1-dependent regulation is a major determinant of NRF2 activity, NRF2-mediated transcriptional activation varies from context to context, suggesting other intracellular signaling cascades may impact NRF2 function. To identify a signaling pathway that modifies NRF2 activity, we immunoprecipitated endogenous NRF2 and its interacting proteins from mouse liver and identified glucocorticoid receptor (GR) as a novel NRF2-binding partner. We found that glucocorticoids (GC), dexamethasone (Dex) and betamethasone (Bet), antagonize diethyl maleate (DEM)-induced activation of NRF2 target genes in a GR-dependent manner. Dex treatment enhanced GR recruitment to AREs without affecting chromatin binding of NRF2, resulting in the inhibition of CBP recruitment and histone acetylation at AREs. This repressive effect was canceled by the addition of HDAC inhibitors. Thus, GR signaling decreases NRF2 transcriptional activation through reducing the NRF2-dependent histone acetylation. Consistent with these observations, GR signaling blocked NRF2-mediated cytoprotection from oxidative stress. This study suggests that an impaired antioxidant response by NRF2 and a resulting decrease in cellular antioxidant capacity account for the side effects of GCs, providing a novel viewpoint for the pathogenesis of hypercorticosteroidism. Epigenetic inheritance mechanisms play fundamental roles in maintaining cellular memory of gene expression states. In fission yeast, histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9me) is methylated at heterochromatic domains. These domains can be epigenetically inherited when epi1+, encoding an enzyme that promotes H3K9 demethylation, is deleted. How native epigenetic states are stably maintained in epe1(+) cells remains unknown. Here, we developed a system to examine the role of DNA sequence and genomic context in propagation of a cis-heritable H3K9me-dependent silenced state. We show that in epe1(+) cells, in addition to sequence-independent mechanisms that propagate H3K9me, epigenetic inheritance of silencing requires binding sites for sequence-dependent ATF/CREB family transcription factors within their native chromosomal context. Thus, specific DNA sequences contribute to cis inheritance of H3K9me and silent epigenetic states. Anxiety disorders are heightened in specific genetic syndromes in comparison to intellectual disability of heterogeneous aetiology. In this study, we described and contrasted anxiety symptomatology in fragile X (FXS), Cornelia de Lange (CdLS) and Rubinstein-Taybi syndromes (RTS), and compared the symptomatology to normative data for typically-developing children and children diagnosed with an anxiety disorder. Scores did not differ between children diagnosed with an anxiety disorder and (a) participants with FXS on social phobia, panic/agoraphobia, physical injury fears, and obsessive-compulsive subscales (b) participants with CdLS on separation anxiety, generalized anxiety, panic/agoraphobia, physical injury fears and obsessive-compulsive subscales, and (c) participants with RTS on panic/agoraphobia and obsessive-compulsive subscales. The results highlight divergent profiles of anxiety symptomatology between these groups. Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome (RSTS; OMIM #180849, #613684) is a rare autosomal dominant genetic condition characterized by broad thumbs and halluces, facial dysmorphism, short stature and variable degree of intellectual disability. RSTS is associated with mutations in CREBBP and EP300 genes in 50-60% and 5-8% of cases, respectively. The majority of cases are de novo heterozygous mutations. Here we describe a familial RSTS case, associated with a novel EP300 mutation. The proband was a 9 years old female, with mild learning difficulties. Her mother, who also had learning difficulties, was found to have short and broad thumbs. MLPA and panel-based NGS of CREBBP and EP300 were performed. A novel heterozygous frameshift mutation in exon 31 of the EP300 gene (c.7222_7223del; p.(Gln2408Glufs*39)) was found in both. This case represents the first case of inherited EP300-RSTS. The location of the frameshift deletion not affecting HAT domain and PHD finger, could explain the mild phenotype and the well-preserved intelligence. These patients are mildly affected, and this case highlights the possible missed diagnosis. We would recommend molecular testing of apparently healthy parents, and in the case of inherited mutations, of all adult first degree relatives at risk. Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome is characterized by mental retardation, atypical facial features, broad thumbs and toes, and scoliosis. Polycystic ovaries are associated with chronic anovulation and abnormal uterine bleeding. A 15-year old female patient was diagnosed with Rubinstein-Taybi Syndrome, and had prolonged abnormal uterine bleeding for 2 years, accompanied by a polycystic ovary. As she showed no improvement during hormonal therapy or medical treatment, a hysterectomy was performed to control the bleeding. Some genetic disorders caused by mutations in genes encoding components of the transcriptional machinery as well as proteins involved in epigenetic modification of the genome share many overlapping features, such as facial dysmorphisms, growth problems and developmental delay/intellectual disability. As a basis for some shared phenotypic characteristics in these syndromes, a similar transcriptome disturbance, characterized by global transcriptional dysregulation, is believed to play a major role. In this review article, a general overview of gene transcription is provided, and the current knowledge of the mechanisms underlying some disorders of transcriptional regulation, such as Rubinstein- Taybi, Coffin-Siris, Cornelia de Lange, and CHOPS syndromes, are discussed. Few comparative studies have evaluated the heterogeneity of sociability across a range of neurodevelopmental disorders. The Sociability Questionnaire for People with Intellectual Disability (SQID) was completed by caregivers of individuals with Cornelia de Lange (n = 98), Angelman (n = 66), Fragile X (n = 142), Down (n = 117) and Rubinstein Taybi (n = 88) syndromes and autism spectrum disorder (ASD; n = 107). Between groups and age-band (<12yrs; 12-18yrs; >18yrs) comparisons of SQID scores were conducted. Rates of behaviors indicative of selective mutism were also examined. Fragile X syndrome achieved the lowest SQID scores. Cornelia de Lange, ASD, and Fragile X groups scored significantly lower than Angelman, Down and Rubinstein Taybi groups. Selective mutism characteristics were highest in Cornelia de Lange (40%) followed by Fragile X (17.8%) and ASD (18.2%). Age-band differences were identified in Cornelia de Lange and Down syndrome. The Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome and pancreas divisum are uncommon diseases in children. The Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome diagnosis is only clinical, and mental retardation and dysmorphic features mainly characterize it. The PD relates to idiopathic pancreatitis in 7.5% of patients suffering from this disorder. It has not been found any cases reported where these diseases are associated and the management of patients with pancreatitis associated with PD is still a challenge. A patient diagnosed with Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome has recurrent abdominal pain of six months and elevated pancreatic enzymes, he underwent a magnetic resonance imaging where pancreas divisum is suspected. Endoscopic drainage was foiled so he underwent intraoperative retrograde pancreatography where aberrant pancreas is confirmed and a distal pancreactectomy and yeyunopancreatic anastomosis is the chosen option. The pancreatectomy with pancreato-jejunal anastomosis is an excellent therapeutic option surgical is proposed for a patient with difficulty endoscopic approach and chronic pancreatitis. El síndrome de Rubinstein-Taybi (SRT) y Páncreas Divisum (PD) son patologías poco frecuentes en la población infantil. El diagnóstico del síndrome Rubinstein-Taybi es clínico, principalmente presenta discapacidad intelectual y rasgos dismórficos. El páncreas divisum se relaciona con pancreatitis idiopática en el 7,5% de pacientes con esta alteración. No se ha encontrado bibliografía que asocie ambas patologías y continúa siendo un reto el manejo de pancreatitis asociado a páncreas divisum. Paciente con diagnóstico de síndrome Rubinstein-Taybi presenta dolor abdominal recurrente de 6 meses de evolución y enzimas pancreáticas elevadas; se realizó una resonancia magnética donde se sospecha de páncreas divisum. El drenaje endoscópico fue frustro, por lo que se realizó una pancreatografía retrógrada intraoperatoria donde se confirma páncreas aberrante y se opta por pancreactectomía distal y anastomosis yeyunopancreática. La pancreatectomía con anastomosis pancreato-yeyunal es una excelente opción terapéutica en pacientes con abordaje endoscópico complicado y pancreatitis crónica. Coffin-Siris syndrome (CSS) (MIM 135900) is characterized by developmental delay, severe speech impairment, distinctive facial features, hypertrichosis, aplasia or hypoplasia of the distal phalanx or nail of the fifth digit and agenesis of the corpus callosum. Recently, it was shown that mutations in the ARID1B gene are the main cause of CSS, accounting for 76% of identified mutations. Here, we report a 15 year-old female patient who was admitted to our clinic with seizures, speech problems, dysmorphic features, bilaterally big, large thumb, café-au-lait (CAL) spots, obesity and hyperinsulinism. First, the patient was thought to have an association of neurofibromatosis and Rubinstein Taybi syndrome. Because of the large size of the NF1 gene for neurofibromatosis and CREBBP gene for Rubinstein Taybi syndrome, whole exome sequence analysis (WES) was conducted and a novel ARID1B mutation was identified. The proband WES test identified a novel heterozygous frameshift mutation c.3394_3395insTA in exon 13 of ARID1B (NM_017519.2) predicting a premature stop codon p.(Tyr1132Leufs*67). Sanger sequencing confirmed the heterozygous c.3394_3395insTA mutation in the proband and that it was not present in her parents indicating de novo mutation. Further investigation and new cases will help to understand this phenomenon better. Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome (RSTS) is a developmental disorder characterized by a typical face and distal limbs abnormalities, intellectual disability, and a vast number of other features. Two genes are known to cause RSTS, CREBBP in 60% and EP300 in 8-10% of clinically diagnosed cases. Both paralogs act in chromatin remodeling and encode for transcriptional co-activators interacting with >400 proteins. Up to now 26 individuals with an EP300 mutation have been published. Here, we describe the phenotype and genotype of 42 unpublished RSTS patients carrying EP300 mutations and intragenic deletions and offer an update on another 10 patients. We compare the data to 308 individuals with CREBBP mutations. We demonstrate that EP300 mutations cause a phenotype that typically resembles the classical RSTS phenotype due to CREBBP mutations to a great extent, although most facial signs are less marked with the exception of a low-hanging columella. The limb anomalies are more similar to those in CREBBP mutated individuals except for angulation of thumbs and halluces which is very uncommon in EP300 mutated individuals. The intellectual disability is variable but typically less marked whereas the microcephaly is more common. All types of mutations occur but truncating mutations and small rearrangements are most common (86%). Missense mutations in the HAT domain are associated with a classical RSTS phenotype but otherwise no genotype-phenotype correlation is detected. Pre-eclampsia occurs in 12/52 mothers of EP300 mutated individuals versus in 2/59 mothers of CREBBP mutated individuals, making pregnancy with an EP300 mutated fetus the strongest known predictor for pre-eclampsia. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome (RSTS) is a rare, congenital, plurimalformative, and neurodevelopmental disorder. Clinical diagnosis can be complicated by the heterogeneous clinical presentation and the lack of a consensus list of diagnostic criteria, and it is confirmed by molecular tests in approximately 55 to 78% of cases. The etiology is partially known with mutations in two functionally related genes: CREBBP and EP300. Notwithstanding the knowledge on clinical, genetic, and allelic heterogeneity, no clear genotype-phenotype correlation has yet been established. Standardized guidelines for the management of pediatric patients are available and therapy for RSTS patients is currently only symptomatic. In this article, several clinic and genetic aspects of RSTS are critically reviewed. This review focuses key advances in different pediatric fields that were published in Italian Journal of Pediatrics and in international journals in 2015. Weaning studies continue to show promise for preventing food allergy. New diagnostic tools are available for identifying the allergic origin of allergic-like symptoms. Advances have been reported in obesity, short stature and autoimmune endocrine disorders. New molecules are offered to reduce weight gain and insulin-resistance in obese children. Regional investigations may provide suggestions for preventing short stature. Epidemiological studies have evidenced the high incidence of Graves' disease and Hashimoto's thyroiditis in patients with Down syndrome. Documentation of novel risk factors for celiac disease are of use to develop strategies for prevention in the population at-risk. Diagnostic criteria for non-celiac gluten sensitivity have been reported. Negative effect on nervous system development of the supernumerary X chromosome in Klinefelter syndrome has emerged. Improvements have been made in understanding rare diseases such as Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome. Eltrombopag is an effective therapy for immune trombocytopenia. Children with sickle-cell anemia are at risk for nocturnal enuresis. Invasive diseases caused by Streptococcus pyogenes are still common despite of vaccination. No difference in frequency of antibiotic prescriptions for acute otitis media between before the publication of the national guideline and after has been found. The importance of timing of iron administration in low birth weight infants, the effect of probiotics for preventing necrotising enterocolitis and perspectives for managing jaundice and cholestasis in neonates have been highlighted. New strategies have been developed to reduce the risk for relapse in nephrotic syndrome including prednisolone during upper respiratory infection. Insights into the pathophysiology of cerebral palsy, arterial ischemic stroke and acute encephalitis may drive advances in treatment. Recommendations on breastfeeding and complementary feeding have been updated. Novel treatments for rhabdomyosarcoma should be considered for paediatric patients. Control of risk factors for bronchiolitis and administration of pavilizumab for preventing respiratory syncytial virus infection may reduce hospitalization. Identification of risk factors for hospitalization in children with wheezing can improve the management of this disease. Deletions or mutations in genes encoding proteins for surfactant function may cause diffuse lung disease. Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome (RTS) is an autosomal dominant neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by growth deficiency, broad thumbs and great toes, intellectual disability and characteristic craniofacial appearance. Mutations in CREBBP account for around 55% of cases, with a further 8% attributed to the paralogous gene EP300. Comparatively few reports exist describing the phenotype of Rubinstein-Taybi because of EP300 mutations. Clinical and genetic data were obtained from nine patients from the UK and Ireland with pathogenic EP300 mutations, identified either by targeted testing or by exome sequencing. All patients had mild or moderate intellectual impairment. Behavioural or social difficulties were noted in eight patients, including three with autistic spectrum disorders. Typical dysmorphic features of Rubinstein-Taybi were only variably present. Additional observations include maternal pre-eclampsia (2/9), syndactyly (3/9), feeding or swallowing issues (3/9), delayed bone age (2/9) and scoliosis (2/9). Six patients had truncating mutations in EP300, with pathogenic missense mutations identified in the remaining three. The findings support previous observations that microcephaly, maternal pre-eclampsia, mild growth restriction and a mild to moderate intellectual disability are key pointers to the diagnosis of EP300-related RTS. Variability in the presence of typical facial features of Rubinstein-Taybi further highlights clinical heterogeneity, particularly among patients identified by exome sequencing. Features that overlap with Floating-Harbor syndrome, including craniofacial dysmorphism and delayed osseous maturation, were observed in three patients. Previous reports have only described mutations predicted to cause haploinsufficiency of EP300, whereas this cohort includes the first described pathogenic missense mutations in EP300. Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome is associated with intellectual and physical features. CREBBP and EP300 are causative. Few cases of EP300 mutations are reported. We report a case with mild features of RSTS and EP300 mutation on exome sequencing. This illustrates the utility of exome sequencing to expand every genetic phenotype. Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome (RTS) is a rare, autosomal dominant syndrome presenting with mental retardation and physical abnormalities, including broad thumbs, big and broad toes, short stature and craniofacial anomalies. Special attention was paid to the possibilities of difficult airway, aspiration pneumonia and cardiovascular dysfunction during anaesthesia. Micrognathia, retrognathia, broad nasal bridge, abnormally large or 'beak-shaped' nose, hypoplastic maxilla and small mouth-typical dysmorphic facial features are one of the biggest causes of the difficult airway in this syndrome. Approximately one-third of the affected individuals have a variety of congenital heart diseases. Recurrent respiratory infections are likely to be the result of microaspiration or gastro-oesophageal reflux in this syndrome. In this case report, we discussed the anaesthesia management of a child with RTS who underwent right endoscopic dacryocystorhinostomy. A male preterm infant was born with dysmorphic features consistent with Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome (RTS). An undescended right testicle was noted on examination. At 5 months of age he developed a palpable right-sided abdominal mass and an elevated alpha-fetoprotein. Histology revealed a malignant germ cell neoplasm arising within the undescended testis. This is the first reported case of a germ cell tumor occurring in a pediatric patient with RTS. Urologic abnormalities occur in approximately 52% of RTS patients, of which cryptorchidism is the commonest. Given the frequency of undescended testes in this population, closer screening may be warranted. Mutations in CREBBP cause Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome. By using exome sequencing, and by using Sanger in one patient, CREBBP mutations were detected in 11 patients who did not, or only in a very limited manner, resemble Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome. The combined facial signs typical for Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome were absent, none had broad thumbs, and three had only somewhat broad halluces. All had apparent developmental delay (being the reason for molecular analysis); five had short stature and seven had microcephaly. The facial characteristics were variable; main characteristics were short palpebral fissures, telecanthi, depressed nasal ridge, short nose, anteverted nares, short columella, and long philtrum. Six patients had autistic behavior, and two had self-injurious behavior. Other symptoms were recurrent upper airway infections (n = 5), feeding problems (n = 7) and impaired hearing (n = 7). Major malformations occurred infrequently. All patients had a de novo missense mutation in the last part of exon 30 or beginning of exon 31 of CREBBP, between base pairs 5,128 and 5,614 (codons 1,710 and 1,872). No missense or truncating mutations in this region have been described to be associated with the classical Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome phenotype. No functional studies have (yet) been performed, but we hypothesize that the mutations disturb protein-protein interactions by altering zinc finger function. We conclude that patients with missense mutations in this specific CREBBP region show a phenotype that differs substantially from that in patients with Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome, and may prove to constitute one (or more) separate entities. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. X-box binding protein 1 (XBP1), a vital basic leucine zipper transcription factor for the related gene transcription in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, belongs to the CREB/ATF family. In mammals, XBP1S is the activated one of XBP1 isoform. In order to study the role of fish XBP1S, we cloned and identified the XBP1S (KU509247) from grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella) (named CiXBP1S) by homologous cloning and RACE technique. The full length of CiXBP1S is 1694 bp along with 124 bp of 5' UTR, 418 bp of 3' UTR and the longest open reading frame (1152 bp) encoding a polypeptide of 383 amino acids with a well conserved DNA binding domain (BRLZ domain). CiXBP1S shares significant homology to zebrafish XBP1S (∼90%) at amino acid level. RT-PCR showed that the expression of CiXBP1S was ubiquitous in all tested grass carp tissues and was significantly up-regulated under the stimulation with tunicamycin (Tm) in CIK (C. idellus kidney) cells. To study the molecular mechanism of transcriptional regulation for XBP1 signaling pathway in fish, we cloned grass carp XBP1 promoter sequence. Its promoter is 1036 bp in length and divided into two distinct regions in which an ER stress response element (ERSE) exists in the proximal region. Meanwhile, grass carp ATF6 (CiATF6N) and CiXBP1S were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 and purified by affinity chromatography with the Ni-NTA His-Bind resin. Gel mobility shift assay showed that CiATF6N and CiXBP1S had the high affinity with CiXBP1 promoter sequence in vitro. Co-transfection of pcDNA3.1-CiATF6 (or pcDNA3.1-CiXBP1S respectively) with pGL3-CiXBP1P2 (or pGL3-CiXBP1P1 respectively) into epithelioma papulosum cyprini (EPC) cells showed that CiATF6 and CiXBP1S played a positive role in CiXBP1S transcription. CiXBP1S also had high affinity with CiGRP78 and CiGRP94 promoter sequences. In addition, recombinant plasmids of pGL3-CiGRP78P and pGL3-CiGRP94P were constructed and transiently co-transfected with pcDNA3.1-CiXBP1S (pcDN3.1-CiXBP1S-nBRLZ, respectively) into EPC cells. The result showed that CiXBP1S can activate CiGRP78 and CiGRP94 promoters. Androgen-Induced bZIP (AIbZIP) is structurally a bZIP transmembrane transcription factor belonging to the CREB/ATF family. This molecule is highly expressed in androgen-sensitive prostate cancer cells and is transcriptionally upregulated by androgen treatment. Here, we investigated molecular mechanism of androgen-dependent expression of AIbZIP and its physiological function in prostate cancer cells. Our data showed that SAM pointed domain-containing ETS transcription factor (SPDEF), which is upregulated by androgen treatment, directly activates transcription of AIbZIP. Knockdown of AIbZIP caused a significant reduction in the proliferation of androgen-sensitive prostate cancer cells with robust expression of p21. Mechanistically, we demonstrated that AIbZIP interacts with old astrocyte specifically induced substance (OASIS), which is a CREB/ATF family transcription factor, and prevents OASIS from promoting transcription of its target gene p21. These findings showed that AIbZIP induced by the androgen receptor (AR) axis plays a crucial role in the proliferation of androgen-sensitive prostate cancer cells, and could be a novel target of therapy for prostate cancer. Immunological mediators that originate outside the nervous system can affect neuronal health. However, their roles in neurodegeneration remain largely unknown. Here, we show that the p38MAPK-mediated immune pathway activated in intestinal cells of Caenorhabditis elegans upon mitochondrial dysfunction protects neurons in a cell-non-autonomous fashion. Specifically, mitochondrial complex I dysfunction induced by rotenone activates the p38MAPK/CREB/ATF-7-dependent innate immune response pathway in intestinal cells of C. elegans. Activation of p38MAPK in the gut is neuroprotective. Enhancing the p38MAPK-mediated immune pathway in intestinal cells alone suppresses rotenone-induced dopaminergic neuron loss, while downregulating it in the intestine exacerbates neurodegeneration. The p38MAPK/ATF-7 immune pathway modulates autophagy and requires autophagy and the PTEN-induced putative kinase PINK-1 for conferring neuroprotection. Thus, mitochondrial damage induces the clearance of mitochondria by the immune pathway, protecting the organism from the toxic effects of mitochondrial dysfunction. We propose that mitochondria are subject to constant surveillance by innate immune mechanisms. Spinal cord injury and regeneration-related protein #69 (SCIRR69),also known as cAMP-responsive element-binding protein 3-like 2, belongs to the CREB/ATF family, some members of which play significant roles in ER stress. However, it is still not fully elucidated whether SCIRR69 involves in ER stress and its biochemical and functional roles during ER stress. In this study, we firstly treated fetal rat spinal cord neuron cells (SCN) and PC12 cells with ER stress activator thapsigargin (TG) or tunicamycin (TM) and then detected the expression pattern of SCIRR69 in response to ER stress at mRNA and protein levels using real-time PCR assay and immunoblotting. Results showed that the expression pattern of SCIRR69 was largely consistent with those of ER stress marker (ATF6, BIP and CHOP) at either mRNA level or protein level, implying that SCIRR69 may play important roles in ER stress. Subsequently, we used stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture (SILAC)-immunoprecipitation quantitative proteomics to identify interaction partners of SCIRR69 during TG-induced ER stress in PC12 cells and found that transitional endoplasmic reticulum ATPase (TERA) and sideroflexin-1 (SFXN1) were potential SCIRR69-interacting proteins. The interaction between SCIRR69 and TERA or SFXN1 was validated using co-immunoprecipitation. Those results provide some clues for novel signaling nexuses that made by interactions between SCIRR69 and TERA or SFXN1. Our findings may facilitate a better understanding of the fundamental functions of SCIRR69 during ER stress. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) regulate testicular function in health and disease. We previously described a prostaglandin D2 (PGD2) system in Sertoli cells. Now, we found that PGD2 increases ROS and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) generation in murine TM4 Sertoli cells, and also induces antioxidant enzymes expression suggesting that defense systems are triggered as an adaptive stress mechanism that guarantees cell survival. ROS and specially H2O2 may act as second messengers regulating signal transduction pathways and gene expression. We describe a stimulatory effect of PGD2 on lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) expression via DP1/DP2 receptors, which is prevented by the antioxidant N-acetyl-L-cysteine and the PI3K/Akt pathway inhibitor LY 294002. PGD2 also enhances Akt and CREB/ATF-1 phosphorylation. Our results provide evidence for a role of PGD2 in the regulation of the oxidant/antioxidant status in Sertoli cells and, more importantly, in the modulation of LDH expression which takes place through ROS generation and the Akt-CREB/ATF-1 pathway. Major depressive disorder (MDD) is associated with a significantly elevated risk of developing serious medical illnesses such as cardiovascular disease, immune impairments, infection, dementia and premature death. Previous work has demonstrated immune dysregulation in subjects with MDD. Using genome-wide transcriptional profiling and promoter-based bioinformatic strategies, we assessed leukocyte transcription factor (TF) activity in leukocytes from 20 unmedicated MDD subjects versus 20 age-, sex- and ethnicity-matched healthy controls, before initiation of antidepressant therapy, and in 17 of the MDD subjects after 8 weeks of sertraline treatment. In leukocytes from unmedicated MDD subjects, bioinformatic analysis of transcription control pathway activity indicated an increased transcriptional activity of cAMP response element-binding/activating TF (CREB/ATF) and increased activity of TFs associated with cellular responses to oxidative stress (nuclear factor erythroid-derived 2-like 2, NFE2l2 or NRF2). Eight weeks of antidepressant therapy was associated with significant reductions in Hamilton Depression Rating Scale scores and reduced activity of NRF2, but not in CREB/ATF activity. Several other transcriptional regulation pathways, including the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), nuclear factor kappa-B cells (NF-κB), early growth response proteins 1-4 (EGR1-4) and interferon-responsive TFs, showed either no significant differences as a function of disease or treatment, or activities that were opposite to those previously hypothesized to be involved in the etiology of MDD or effective treatment. Our results suggest that CREB/ATF and NRF2 signaling may contribute to MDD by activating immune cell transcriptome dynamics that ultimately influence central nervous system (CNS) motivational and affective processes via circulating mediators. Activating transcription factor 5 (ATF5) is a member of the CREB/ATF family of transcription factors, which is highly expressed in olfactory chemosensory tissues, the main olfactory epithelium and vomeronasal epithelium (VNE) in mice. The vomeronasal sensory neurons in the VNE detect pheromones in order to regulate social behaviors such as mating and aggression; however, the physiological role of ATF5 in the vomeronasal sensory system remains unknown. In this study, we found that the differentiation of mature vomeronasal sensory neurons, assessed by olfactory marker protein expression, was inhibited in ATF5-deficient VNE. In addition, many apoptotic vomeronasal sensory neurons were evident in ATF5-deficient VNE. The vomeronasal sensory neurons consist of two major types of neuron expressing either vomeronasal 1 receptor (V1r)/Gαi2 or vomeronasal 2 receptor (V2r)/Gαo. We demonstrated that the differentiation, survival and axonal projection of V2r/Gαo-type rather than V1r/Gαi2-type vomeronasal sensory neurons were severely inhibited in ATF5-deficient VNE. These results suggest that ATF5 is one of the transcription factors crucial for the vomeronasal sensory formation. cAMP is a second messenger well documented to be involved in the phosphorylation of PKA, MAP kinase, and histone H3 (H3). Early, we reported that cAMP also induced H3 dephosphorylation in a variety of proliferating cell lines. Herein, it is shown that cAMP elicits a biphasic H3 dephosphorylation independent of PKA activation in cycling cells. H89, a potent inhibitor of PKA catalytic sub-unite, could not abolish this effect. Additionally, H89 induces a rapid and biphasic H3 serine 10 dephosphorylation, while a decline in the basal phosphorylation of CREB/ATF-1 is observed. Rp-cAMPS, an analog of cAMP and specific inhibitor of PKA, is unable to suppress cAMP-mediated H3 dephosphorylation, whereas Rp-cAMPS effectively blocks CREB/ATF-1 hyper-phosphorylation by cAMP and its inducers. Interestingly, cAMP exerts a rapid and profound H3 dephosphorylation at much lower concentration (50-fold lower, 0.125 mM) than the concentration required for maximal CREB/ATF-1 phosphorylation (5 mM). Much higher cAMP concentration is required to fully induce CREB/ATF-1 gain in phosphate (5 mM), which correlates with the inhibition of H3 dephosphorylation. Also, the dephosphorylation of H3 does not overlap at onset of MAP kinase phosphorylation pathways, p38 and ERK. Surprisingly, rapamycin (an mTOR inhibitor), cAMP, and its natural inducer isoproterenol, elicit identical dephosphorylation kinetics on both S6K1 ribosomal kinase (a downstream mTOR target) and H3. Finally, cAMP-induced H3 dephosphorylation is PP1/2-dependent. The results suggest that a pathway, requiring much lower cAMP concentration to that required for CREB/ATF-1 hyper-phosphorylation, is responsible for histone H3 dephosphorylation and may be linked to mTOR down regulation. In the adrenal, the type I 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (HSD3B1) is expressed exclusively in the zona glomerulosa (ZG), where aldosterone is produced. Angiotensin II (AngII) and potassium (K(+)) are the major physiological regulators of aldosterone synthesis. However, their respective roles in regulation of aldosterone synthesis are not fully defined, particularly in terms of transcriptional regulation of steroidogenic enzyme genes. We previously showed that AngII can stimulate expression of HSD3B1. But, K(+) responsiveness of this gene has remained unexplored. Here, we report that K(+) stimulation lacks the ability to induce HSD3B1 expression in human adrenocortical H295R cells. Both AngII and K(+) were able to enhance transcription of the aldosterone synthase gene (CYP11B2). Promoter analysis revealed that although both AngII and K(+) activate transcription from the Ca(2+)/cAMP-responsive element (CRE) located in the CYP11B2 promoter, the orphan nuclear receptor NGFIB-responsive element (NBRE) located in the HSD3B1 promoter fails to respond to K(+), being only able to enhance transcription after AngII treatment. We found that induction of de novo protein synthesis of NGFIB occurs only after AngII treatment. This sharply contrasts with the phosphorylation that occurs in response to both AngII and K(+) on the CREB/ATF family transcription factor ATF2. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay confirmed that the NGFIB protein occupies the HSD3B1 promoter only after AngII, while ATF2 binds to the CYP11B2 promoter in response to both AngII and K(+). These data provide evidence that downstream signals from AngII and K(+) can be uncoupled in the regulation of HSD3B1 in the human adrenocortical H295R cells. Viral engagement with macrophages activates Toll-Like-Receptors (TLRs) and viruses must contend with the ensuing inflammatory responses to successfully complete their replication cycle. To date, known counter-strategies involve the use of viral-encoded proteins that often employ mimicry mechanisms to block or redirect the host response to benefit the virus. Whether viral regulatory DNA sequences provide an opportunistic strategy by which viral enhancer elements functionally mimic innate immune enhancers is unknown. Here we find that host innate immune genes and the prototypical viral enhancer of cytomegalovirus (CMV) have comparable expression kinetics, and positively respond to common TLR agonists. In macrophages but not fibroblasts we show that activation of NFκB at immediate-early times of infection is independent of virion-associated protein, M45. We find upon virus infection or transfection of viral genomic DNA the TLR-agonist treatment results in significant enhancement of the virus transcription-replication cycle. In macrophage time-course infection experiments we demonstrate that TLR-agonist stimulation of the viral enhancer and replication cycle is strictly delimited by a temporal gate with a determined half-maximal time for enhancer-activation of 6 h; after which TLR-activation blocks the viral transcription-replication cycle. By performing a systematic siRNA screen of 149 innate immune regulatory factors we identify not only anticipated anti-viral and pro-viral contributions but also new factors involved in the CMV transcription-replication cycle. We identify a
