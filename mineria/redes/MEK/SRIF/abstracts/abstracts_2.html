This study compared three technologies for their efficacy for long-term measurement of the relationship between BT and ST by means of (1) temperature sensitive radio transmitters (RT), (2) data loggers (DL) and (3) infrared imaging (IRI). After an initial pilot study on two bulls to establish a surgical protocol, RTs and DLs were implanted into the flank and mid-scrotum of six Wagyu bulls for between 29 and 49 days. RT frequencies were scanned every 15 min, whilst DLs logged every 30 min. Infrared imaging of the body (flank) and scrotum of each bull was recorded hourly for one 24-h period and compared to RT and DL data. After a series of subsequent heat stress studies, bulls were castrated and testicular tissue samples processed for evidence of histopathology. Radio transmitters were less reliable than DLs; RTs lost &gt;11 % of data, whilst 11 of the 12 DLs had 0 % data loss. IRI was only interpretable in 35.8 % of images recorded. Pearson correlations between DL and RT were strong for both BT (r &gt; 0.94, P &lt; 0.001) and ST (r &gt; 0.80, P &lt; 0.001). Surgery produced temporary minor inflammation and scrotal hematoma in two animals post-surgery. Whilst scar tissue was observed at all surgical sutured sites when bulls were castrated, there was no evidence of testicular adhesion and normal active spermatogenesis was observed in six of the eight implanted testicles. There was no significant correlation of IRI with either DL or RT. We conclude that DLs provided to be a reliable continuous source of data for synchronous measurement of BT and ST.
The reading and spelling deficits characteristic of developmental dyslexia (dyslexia) have been related to problems in phonological processing and in learning associations between letters and speech-sounds. Even when children with dyslexia have learned the letters and their corresponding speech sounds, letter-speech sound associations might still be less automatized compared to children with age-adequate literacy skills. In order to examine automaticity in letter-speech sound associations and to overcome some of the disadvantages associated with the frequently used visual-auditory oddball paradigm, we developed a novel electrophysiological letter-speech sound interference paradigm. This letter-speech sound interference paradigm was applied in a group of 9-year-old children with dyslexia (n = 36) and a group of typically developing (TD) children of similar age (n = 37). Participants had to indicate whether two letters look visually the same. In the incongruent condition (e.g., the letter pair A-a) there was a conflict between the visual information and the automatically activated phonological information; although the visual appearance of the two letters is different, they are both associated with the same speech sound. This conflict resulted in slower response times (RTs) in the incongruent than in the congruent (e.g., the letter pair A-e) condition. Furthermore, in the TD control group, the conflict resulted in fast and strong event-related potential (ERP) effects reflected in less negative N1 amplitudes and more positive conflict slow potentials (cSP) in the incongruent than in the congruent condition. However, the dyslexic group did not show any conflict-related ERP effects, implying that letter-speech sound associations are less automatized in this group. Furthermore, we examined general visual conflict processing in a control visual interference task, using false fonts. The conflict in this experiment was based purely on the visual similarity of the presented objects. Visual conflict resulted in slower RTs, less negative N2 amplitudes and more positive cSP in both groups. Thus, on a general, basic level, visual conflict processing does not seem to be affected in children with dyslexia.
The response set effect refers to the finding that an irrelevant incongruent colour-word produces greater interference when it is one of the response options (referred to as a response set trial), compared to when it is not (a non-response set trial). Despite being a key effect for models of selective attention, the magnitude of the effect varies considerably across studies. We report two within-subjects experiments that tested the hypothesis that presentation format modulates the magnitude of the response set effect. Trial types (e.g. response set, non-response set, neutral) were either presented in separate blocks (pure) or in blocks containing trials from all conditions presented randomly (mixed). In the first experiment we show that the response set effect is substantially reduced in the mixed block context as a result of a decrease in RTs to response set trials. By demonstrating the modulation of the response set effect under conditions of trial type mixing we present evidence that is difficult for models of the effect based on strategic, top-down biasing of attention to explain. In a second experiment we tested a stimulus-driven account of the response set effect by manipulating the number of colour-words that make up the non-response set of distractors. The results show that the greater the number of non-response set colour concepts, the smaller the response set effect. Alternative accounts of the data and its implications for research debating the automaticity of reading are discussed.
Clostridium difficile is a nosocomial pathogen prevalent in hospitals worldwide and increasingly common in the community. Sequence differences have been shown to be present in the Surface Layer Proteins (SLPs) from different C. difficile ribotypes (RT) however whether these differences influence severity of infection is still not clear.
We used a molecular evolutionary approach to analyse SLPs from twenty-six C. difficile RTs representing different slpA sequences. We demonstrate that SLPs from RT 027 and 078 exhibit evidence of positive selection (PS). We compared the effect of these SLPs to those purified from RT 001 and 014, which did not exhibit PS, and demonstrate that the presence of sites under positive selection correlates with ability to activate macrophages. SLPs from RTs 027 and 078 induced a more potent response in macrophages, with increased levels of IL-6, IL-12p40, IL-10, MIP-1α, MIP-2 production relative to RT 001 and 014. Furthermore, RTs 027 and 078 induced higher expression of CD40, CD80 and MHC II on macrophages with decreased ability to phagocytose relative to LPS.
These results tightly link sequence differences in C. difficile SLPs to disease susceptibility and severity, and suggest that positively selected sites in the SLPs may play a role in driving the emergence of hyper-virulent strains.
RNA aptamers that bind HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT) inhibit HIV-1 replication, but little is known about potential aptamer-specific viral resistance. During replication, RT interacts with diverse nucleic acids. Thus, the genetic threshold for eliciting resistance may be high for aptamers that make numerous contacts with RT. To evaluate the impact of RT-aptamer binding specificity on replication, we engineered proviral plasmids encoding diverse RTs within the backbone of HIV-1 strain NL4-3. Viruses inhibited by pseudoknot aptamers were rendered insensitive by a naturally occurring R277K variant, providing the first demonstration of aptamer-specific resistance in cell culture. Naturally occurring, pseudoknot-insensitive viruses were rendered sensitive by the inverse K277R mutation, establishing RT as the genetic locus for aptamer-mediated HIV-1 inhibition. Non-pseudoknot RNA aptamers exhibited broad-spectrum inhibition. Inhibition was observed only when virus was produced in aptamer-expressing cells, indicating that encapsidation is required. HIV-1 suppression magnitude correlated with the number of encapsidated aptamer transcripts per virion, with saturation occurring around 1:1 stoichiometry with packaged RT. Encapsidation specificity suggests that aptamers may encounter dimerized GagPol in the cytosol during viral assembly. This study provides new insights into HIV-1's capacity to escape aptamer-mediated inhibition, the potential utility of broad-spectrum aptamers to overcome resistance, and molecular interactions that occur during viral assembly.
Nucleoside reverse transcriptase (RT) inhibitors constitute the backbone of current therapies against human immunodeficiency virus type 1 and type 2 (HIV-1 and HIV-2, respectively). However, mutational pathways leading to the development of nucleoside analogue resistance are different in both types of HIV. In HIV-2, resistance to all approved nucleoside analogues is conferred by the combination of RT substitutions K65R, Q151M and M184V. Nucleotide incorporation kinetic analyses of mutant and wild-type (WT) HIV-2 RTs show that the triple-mutant has decreased catalytic efficiency due to the presence of M184V. Although similar effects were previously reported for equivalent mutations in HIV-1 RT, the HIV-2 enzymes were catalytically less efficient. Interestingly, in highly divergent HIV-1 RTs, K65R confers several-fold increased accuracy of DNA synthesis. We have determined the intrinsic fidelity of DNA synthesis of WT HIV-2 RT and mutants K65R and K65R/Q151M/M184V. Our results show that those changes in HIV-2 RT have a relatively small impact on nucleotide selectivity. Furthermore, we found that there were less than two-fold differences in error rates obtained with forward mutation assays using mutant and WT HIV-2 RTs. A different conformation of the β3-β4 hairpin loop in HIV-1 and HIV-2 RTs could probably explain the differential effects of K65R.
Pitchers who return to sport (RTS) sooner will have a higher risk of revision ulnar collateral ligament reconstruction (UCLR) than those who return later.
All professional (major and minor league) baseball pitchers who underwent UCLR between 1974 and 2016 were identified. Date of the index UCLR was recorded. The date of the first game back at any professional level after surgery and the date the pitcher returned to the same level of play (if applicable) were recorded. Length of time between these dates was compared for pitchers who required a revision UCLR and those who did not.
Overall, 569 pitchers (average age, 24.8 ± 4.1 years) underwent UCLR and had reliable game logs after surgery. No statistically significant difference existed in the length of time to RTS at any professional level or at the same professional level between those pitchers who did not require a revision UCLR and those who did (P = .442, P = .238). Pitchers who required revision UCLR returned to any level of play almost 2 months earlier (14.7 vs. 16.5 months) and returned to the same level of play &gt;2 months earlier (15.2 vs. 17.7 months) than matched controls who did not require revision UCLR, although this was not statistically significant (P = .179, P = .204).
No statistically significant difference existed in the length of time to RTS after UCLR in professional baseball players who required a revision UCLR and those who did not.
The purpose of this study was to investigate whether physical activity (PA) habits may positively impact performance of the orienting and executive control networks in community-dwelling aging individuals and diabetics, who are at risk of cognitive dysfunction. To this aim, we tested cross-sectionally whether age, ranging from late middle-age to old adulthood, and PA level independently or interactively predict different facets of the attentional performance. Hundred and thirty female and male individuals and 22 adults with type 2 diabetes aged 55-84 years were recruited and their daily PA (steps) was objectively measured by means of armband monitors. Participants performed a multifunctional attentional go/no-go reaction time (RT) task in which spatial attention was cued by means of informative direct cues of different sizes followed by compound stimuli with local and global target features. The performance efficiency of the orienting networks was estimated by computing RT differences between validly and invalidly cued trials, that of the executive control networks by computing local switch costs that are RT differences between switch and non-switch trials in mixed blocks of global and local target trials. In regression analyses performed on the data of non-diabetic elderlies, overall RTs and orienting effects resulted jointly predicted by age and steps. Age predicted overall RTs in low-active individuals, but orienting effects and response errors in high-active individuals. Switch costs were predicted by age only, with larger costs at older age. In the analysis conducted with the 22 diabetics and 22 matched non-diabetic elderlies, diabetic status and daily steps predicted longer and shorter RTs, respectively. Results suggest that high PA levels exert beneficial, but differentiated effects on processing speed and attentional networks performance in aging individuals that partially counteract the detrimental effects of advancing age and diabetic status. In conclusion, adequate levels of overall PA may positively impinge on brain efficiency and attentional control and should be therefore promoted by actions that support lifelong PA participation and impact the built environment to render it more conducive to PA.
Since 2007, the Budapest criteria are recommended for the diagnosis of Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS) 1. The usefulness of bone scintigraphy (BS, index test) for the diagnosis of CRPS 1 remains controversial. Imperfect reference tests (RT) result in underestimation of the diagnostic accuracy of BS. Further, biased results can occur when a dependency between the RT and BS exists. The objective was to assess the impact of different RTs, specifically the Budapest criteria, and the assumed imperfect nature of the RT on the diagnostic accuracy of BS. Further, we analyzed the association between baseline characteristics and positive BS in patients with CRPS 1.
Systematic literature review and Bayesian meta-analysis to assess the test accuracy of BS with and without accounting for the imperfect nature of the RT. We examined correlations (Spearman correlation coefficients / Wilcoxon tests) between baseline characteristics and the proportion of positive BS in patients with CRPS 1.
The pooled sensitivity was 0.804 (95% credible interval (CI) 0.225-1.0, 21 studies) and specificity 0.853 (95%CI 0.278-1.00). Sensitivity and specificity of BS increased when accounting for the imperfect nature of the RT. However, in studies using Budapest criteria as reference, the sensitivity decreased (0.551; 95% CI 0.046-1) and the specificity increased (0.935; 95% CI 0.306-1). Shorter disease duration and a higher proportion of males were associated with a higher proportion of positive BS (27 studies, disease duration &lt;52 weeks Wilcoxon test p = 0.047, female proportion Spearman correlation -0.63, p = 0.009).
Compared to the accepted Budapest diagnostic criteria BS cannot be used to rule-in the diagnosis of CRPS 1. In patients with negative BS CRPS 1 is less likely the underlying illness. Studies using older or no diagnostic criteria should not be used to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of BS in CRPS 1.
In event-related potential (ERP) studies, the left-parietal old/new effect is commonly considered as a neural correlate of recollection. In memory exclusion tasks, the effect is usually observed when the targeted information is identified, but it is not necessarily present when studied items are rejected as nontargets. Interestingly, both the presence and the absence of such old/new effects to nontargets have been regarded as indicator for strategic retrieval. We reviewed previous ERP studies using memory exclusion tasks to analyze the reaction time (RT) pattern in such studies, as well as the influence of task difficulty on the occurrence of nontarget retrieval. We identified 44 test conditions, reported in 24 studies, and subjected the behavioral data to a meta-analysis. The RTs to correctly rejected new items were shorter than the RTs to hits, in particular in studies that required differentiating conceptual or perceptual information at test. When the retrieval of target information was prioritized, RTs to nontargets were delayed relative to targets. Without such prioritization, no such RT differences were observed. For test conditions with nontarget retrieval, the retrieval accuracy was poorer compared with test conditions without such retrieval. The findings support previous studies that claimed that nontarget retrieval becomes more likely when target retrieval is difficult, but the strong overlap in task difficulty between conditions with and without nontarget retrieval indicates that other, partly yet to-be-identified factors contribute to the occurrence of nontarget retrieval as well.
Aloe vera based RTS formulation was prepared in this study which provides the health benefits of this wonder plant and was also appealing in terms of sensory qualities. In the present study four formulations of A. vera RTS drink with ginger, sweet lime and amla (V1, V2, V3 and V4 were developed). The developed products were subjected to physico-chemical, organoleptic and microbial analysis. The formulation V3 was found to be the most preferred variant with respect to the sensory quality. Further the blends were found to be a good source of vitamin C and other nutritional parameters. The storage stability studies carried out on the formulations showed that the physico-chemical and the sensory qualities of the RTS blends were acceptable after 60 days of storage. Microbial analysis of the RTS blends during the storage period revealed that it was free from any microbial spoilage.
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the performance variations in commercial deformable image registration (DIR) tools for adaptive radiation therapy and further to interpret the differences using clinically available terms. Three clinical examples (prostate, head and neck (HN), and cranial spinal irradiation (CSI) with L-spine boost) were evaluated in this study. Firstly, computerized deformed CT images were generated using simulation QA software with virtual deformations of bladder filling (prostate), neck flexion/bite-block repositioning/tumor shrinkage (HN), and vertebral body rotation (CSI). The corresponding transformation matrices served as a "reference" for the following comparisons. Three commercialized DIR algorithms: the free-form deformation from MIMVista 5.5 and the RegRefine from MIMMaestro 6.0, the multipass B-spline from VelocityAI v3.0.1, and the adaptive demons from OnQ rts 2.1.15, were applied between the initial images and the deformed CT sets. The generated adaptive contours and dose distributions were compared with the "reference" and among each other. The performance in transferring contours was comparable among all three tools with an average Dice similarity coefficient of 0.81 for all the organs. However, the dose warping accuracy appeared to rely on the evaluation end points and methodologies. Point-dose differences could show a difference of up to 23.3 Gy inside the PTVs and to overestimate up to 13.2 Gy for OARs, which was substantial for a 72 Gy prescription dose. Dosevolume histogram-based evaluation might not be sensitive enough to illustrate all the detailed variations, while isodose assessment on a slice-by-slice basis could be tedious. We further explored the possibility of using 3D gamma index analysis for warping dose variation assessment, and observed differences in dose warping using different DIR tools. Overall, our results demonstrated that evaluation based only on the performance of contour transformation could not guarantee the accuracy in dose warping, while dose-transferring validation strongly relied on the evaluation endpoint. As dose-transferring errors could cause misinterpretations when attempting to accumulate dose for adaptive radiation therapy and more DIR tools are available for clinical use, a standard and clinically meaningful quality assurance criterion should be established for DIR QA in the near future. PACS number(s): 87.57.
Converting the single-stranded retroviral RNA into integration-competent double-stranded DNA is achieved through a multi-step process mediated by the virus-coded reverse transcriptase (RT). With the exception that it is restricted to an intracellular life cycle, replication of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae long terminal repeat (LTR)-retrotransposon Ty3 genome is guided by equivalent events that, while generally similar, show many unique and subtle differences relative to the retroviral counterparts. Until only recently, our knowledge of RT structure and function was guided by a vast body of literature on the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) enzyme. Although the recently-solved structure of Ty3 RT in the presence of an RNA/DNA hybrid adds little in terms of novelty to the mechanistic basis underlying DNA polymerase and ribonuclease H activity, it highlights quite remarkable topological differences between retroviral and LTR-retrotransposon RTs. The theme of overall similarity but distinct differences extends to the priming mechanisms used by Ty3 RT to initiate (-) and (+) strand DNA synthesis. The unique structural organization of the retrotransposon enzyme and interaction with its nucleic acid substrates, with emphasis on polypurine tract (PPT)-primed initiation of (+) strand synthesis, is the subject of this review.
Our attentional focus is constantly shifting: In one moment, our attention may be intently concentrated on a specific spot, whereas in another moment we might spread our attention more broadly. Although much is known about the mechanisms by which we shift our visual attention from place to place, relatively little is known about how we shift the aperture of attention from more narrowly to more broadly focused. Here we introduce a novel attentional distribution task to examine the neural mechanisms underlying this process. In this task, participants are presented with an informative cue that indicates the location of an upcoming target. This cue can be perfectly predictive of the exact target location, or it can indicate-with varying degrees of certainty-approximately where the target might appear. This cue is followed by a preparatory period in which there is nothing on the screen except a central fixation cross. Using scalp EEG, we examined neural activity during this preparatory period. We find that, with decreasing certainty regarding the precise location of the impending target, participant RTs increased whereas target identification accuracy decreased. Additionally, the multivariate pattern of preparatory period visual cortical alpha (8-12 Hz) activity encoded attentional distribution. This alpha encoding was predictive of behavioral accuracy and RT nearly 1 sec later. These results offer insight into the neural mechanisms underlying how we use information to guide our attentional distribution and how that influences behavior.
We examined the neurobiological basis of temporal resetting, an aspect of temporal order memory, using a version of the delayed-match-to-multiple-sample task. While in an fMRI scanner, participants evaluated whether an item was novel or whether it had appeared before or after a reset event that signified the start of a new block of trials. Participants responded "old" to items that were repeated within the current block and "new" to both novel items and items that had last appeared before the reset event (pseudonew items). Medial-temporal, prefrontal, and occipital regions responded to absolute novelty of the stimulus-they differentiated between novel items and previously seen items, but not between old and pseudonew items. Activation for pseudonew items in the frontopolar and parietal regions, in contrast, was intermediate between old and new items. The posterior cingulate cortex extending to precuneus was the only region that showed complete temporal resetting, and its activation reflected whether an item was new or old according to the task instructions regardless of its familiarity. There was also a significant Condition (old/pseudonew) × Familiarity (second/third presentations) interaction effect on behavioral and neural measures. For pseudonew items, greater familiarity decreased response accuracy, increased RTs, increased ACC activation, and increased functional connectivity between ACC and the left frontal pole. The reverse was observed for old items. On the basis of these results, we propose a theoretical framework in which temporal resetting relies on an episodic retrieval network that is modulated by cognitive control and conflict resolution.
In usage-based linguistic theories, the assumption that high-frequency language strings are mentally represented as unitary chunks has been invoked to account for a wide range of phenomena. However, neurocognitive evidence in support of this assumption is still lacking. In line with Gestalt psychological assumptions, we propose that a language string qualifies as a chunk if the following two conditions are simultaneously satisfied: The perception of the whole string does not involve strong activation of its individual component parts, but the component parts in isolation strongly evoke the whole. Against this background, we explore the relationship between different frequency metrics and the chunk status of derived words (e.g., "government," "worthless") in a masked visual priming experiment with two conditions of interest. One condition investigates "whole-to-part" priming (worthless-WORTH), whereas the other one analyzes "part-to-whole" priming (tear-TEARLESS). Both conditions combine mixed-effects regression analyses of lexical decision RTs with a parametric fMRI design. Relative frequency (the frequency of the whole word relative to that of its onset-embedded part) emerges as the only frequency metric to correlate with chunk status in behavioral terms. The fMRI results show that relative frequency modulates activity in regions that have been related to morphological (de)composition or general task performance difficulty (notably left inferior frontal areas) and in regions associated with competition between whole, undecomposed words (right inferior frontal areas). We conclude that relative frequency affects early stages of processing, thereby supporting the usage-based concept of frequency-induced chunks.
Reports an error in "Multisensory brand search: How the meaning of sounds guides consumers' visual attention" by Klemens M. Knoeferle, Pia Knoeferle, Carlos Velasco and Charles Spence (Journal of Experimental Psychology: Applied, 2016[Jun], Vol 22[2], 196-210). In the article, under Experiment 2, Design and Stimuli, the set number of target products and visual distractors reported in the second paragraph should be 20 and 13, respectively: "On each trial, the 16 products shown in the display were randomly selected from a set of 20 products belonging to different categories. Out of the set of 20 products, seven were potential targets, whereas the other 13 were used as visual distractors only throughout the experiment (since they were not linked to specific usage or consumption sounds)." Consequently, Appendix A in the supplemental materials has been updated. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record 2016-28876-002.) Building on models of crossmodal attention, the present research proposes that brand search is inherently multisensory, in that the consumers' visual search for a specific brand can be facilitated by semantically related stimuli that are presented in another sensory modality. A series of 5 experiments demonstrates that the presentation of spatially nonpredictive auditory stimuli associated with products (e.g., usage sounds or product-related jingles) can crossmodally facilitate consumers' visual search for, and selection of, products. Eye-tracking data (Experiment 2) revealed that the crossmodal effect of auditory cues on visual search manifested itself not only in RTs, but also in the earliest stages of visual attentional processing, thus suggesting that the semantic information embedded within sounds can modulate the perceptual saliency of the target products' visual representations. Crossmodal facilitation was even observed for newly learnt associations between unfamiliar brands and sonic logos, implicating multisensory short-term learning in establishing audiovisual semantic associations. The facilitation effect was stronger when searching complex rather than simple visual displays, thus suggesting a modulatory role of perceptual load. (PsycINFO Database Record
The chromatin-remodelling complex SNF2-related CBP activator protein (SRCAP) regulates chromatin structure in yeast by modulating the exchange of histone H2A for the H2A.Z variant. Here, we have investigated the contribution of H2A.Z-mediated chromatin remodelling to mammalian cell differentiation reprogramming. We show that the SRCAP subunit named ZNHIT1 or p18(Hamlet), which is a substrate of p38 MAPK, is recruited to the myogenin promoter at the onset of muscle differentiation, in a p38 MAPK-dependent manner. We also show that p18(Hamlet) is required for H2A.Z accumulation into this genomic region and for subsequent muscle gene transcriptional activation. Accordingly, downregulation of several subunits or the SRCAP complex impairs muscle gene expression. These results identify SRCAP/H2A.Z-mediated chromatin remodelling as a key early event in muscle differentiation-specific gene expression. We also propose a mechanism by which p38 MAPK-mediated signals are converted into chromatin structural changes, thereby facilitating transcriptional activation during mammalian cell differentiation.
Thyroid hormone (T3) and retinoic acid (RA) play important roles in erythropoiesis. We found that the hematopoietic cell-specific bZip protein p45/NF-E2 interacts with T3 receptor (TR) and RA receptor (RAR) but not retinoid X receptor. The interaction is between the DNA-binding domain of the nuclear receptor and the leucine zipper region of p45/NF-E2 but is markedly enhanced by cognate ligand. Remarkably, ligand-dependent transactivation by TR and RAR is markedly potentiated by p45/NF-E2. This effect of p45/NF-E2 is prevented by maf-like protein p18, which functions positively as a heterodimer with p45/NF-E2 on DNA. Potentiation of hormone action by p45/NF-E2 requires its activation domain, which interacts strongly with the multifaceted coactivator cyclic AMP response element protein-binding protein (CBP). The region of CBP which interacts with p45/NF-E2 is the same interaction domain that mediates inhibition of hormone-stimulated transcription by AP1 transcription factors. Overexpression of the bZip interaction domain of CBP specifically abolishes the positive cross talk between TR and p45/NF-E2. Thus, positive cross talk between p45/NF-E2 and nuclear hormone receptors requires direct protein-protein interactions between these factors and with CBP, whose integration of positive signals from two transactivation domains provides a novel mechanism for potentiation of hormone action in hematopoietic cells.
Although the excitatory action of GABA has been shown to activate the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), its molecular mechanisms remain unclear. Using cultured rat cortical cells, we here demonstrated that GABA induced Bdnf mRNA expression mainly via L-type voltage-dependent Ca(2+) channels (L-VDCC) at the early stage and inhibited it at the late stage of the culture, which corresponded to the excitatory and inhibitory states of cortical cells. The excitatory GABA-induced Bdnf mRNA expression was controlled by multiple Ca(2+) signaling pathways including Ca(2+) /calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CaMK), mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and calcineurin (CN). The Bdnf-promoter IV (Bdnf-pIV) was activated by GABA, mainly via cAMP-response element (CRE)/CREB, and this was prevented by the over-expression of a dominant negative CREB. The nuclear translocation of CREB-regulated transcriptional coactivator 1 (CRTC1) was selectively induced by the GABA-induced CN pathway to activate Bdnf-pIV. On the other hand, GABA-induced Gal4-CREB-dependent transcription, which was controlled by multiple Ca(2+) signaling pathways, was prevented when the serine at position 133 of Gal4-CREB was mutated to alanine. Taken together, the excitatory action of GABA transcriptionally activated Bdnf expression through the combination of nuclear-localized CRTC1 and phosphorylated CREB in immature cortical cells, and may be the molecular mechanisms underlying Bdnf expression to control neuronal development. We demonstrated that GABA induced Bdnf expression at the early stage of the culture, in which GABA exerted its excitatory action. The excitatory GABA-induced Bdnf expression was controlled by multiple Ca(2+) signaling pathways evoked via L-VDCC. Both the CREB coactivator, CRTC1 and CREB phosphorylation participated in excitatory GABA-induced Bdnf transcription. Our present study indicates the mechanism underlying the excitatory GABA-induced Bdnf expression in immature neurons and provide new insights into molecular mechanisms underlying Bdnf expression to control neuronal development.
The CREB/CRE transcriptional pathway has been implicated in circadian clock timing and light-evoked clock resetting. To date, much of the work on CREB in circadian physiology has focused on how changes in the phosphorylation state of CREB regulate the timing processes. However, beyond changes in phosphorylation, CREB-dependent transcription can also be regulated by the CREB coactivator CRTC (CREB-regulated transcription coactivator), also known as TORC (transducer of regulated CREB). Here we profiled both the rhythmic and light-evoked regulation of CRTC1 and CRTC2 in the murine suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), the locus of the master mammalian clock. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed rhythmic expression of CRTC1 in the SCN. CRTC1 expression was detected throughout the dorsoventral extent of the SCN in the middle of the subjective day, with limited expression during early night, and late night expression levels intermediate between mid-day and early night levels. In contrast to CRTC1, robust expression of CRTC2 was detected during both the subjective day and night. During early and late subjective night, a brief light pulse induced strong nuclear accumulation of CRTC1 in the SCN. In contrast with CRTC1, photic stimulation did not affect the subcellular localization of CRTC2 in the SCN. Additionally, reporter gene profiling and chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis indicated that CRTC1 was associated with CREB in the 5' regulatory region of the period1 gene, and that overexpression of CRTC1 leads to a marked upregulation in period1 transcription. Together, these data raise the prospect that CRTC1 plays a role in fundamental aspects of SCN clock timing and entrainment.
Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) complex 1 (mTORC1) plays a central role in translating nutrient abundance into cell growth and proliferation. Although specific proteins have been described as mediators of this nutrient input, their mechanistic linkage remains incomplete. Two studies have added phospholipase D (PLD) as a mediator of nutrients to mTORC1. Furthermore, these studies link PLD and its product phosphatidic acid to previously identified activators of mTORC1 signaling, including the class III phosphoinositide-3 kinase, and provide evidence of the existence of two parallel nutrient-regulated pathways that converge on mTORC1 at late endosomes and/or lysosomes.
Although both extrinsic and intrinsic factors have been identified that orchestrate the differentiation and maturation of oligodendrocytes, less is known about the intracellular signaling pathways that control the overall commitment to differentiate. Here, we provide evidence that activation of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is essential for oligodendrocyte differentiation. Specifically, mTOR regulates oligodendrocyte differentiation at the late progenitor to immature oligodendrocyte transition as assessed by the expression of stage specific antigens and myelin proteins including MBP and PLP. Furthermore, phosphorylation of mTOR on Ser 2448 correlates with myelination in the subcortical white matter of the developing brain. We demonstrate that mTOR exerts its effects on oligodendrocyte differentiation through two distinct signaling complexes, mTORC1 and mTORC2, defined by the presence of the adaptor proteins raptor and rictor, respectively. Disrupting mTOR complex formation via siRNA mediated knockdown of raptor or rictor significantly reduced myelin protein expression in vitro. However, mTORC2 alone controlled myelin gene expression at the mRNA level, whereas mTORC1 influenced MBP expression via an alternative mechanism. In addition, investigation of mTORC1 and mTORC2 targets revealed differential phosphorylation during oligodendrocyte differentiation. In OPC-DRG cocultures, inhibiting mTOR potently abrogated oligodendrocyte differentiation and reduced numbers of myelin segments. These data support the hypothesis that mTOR regulates commitment to oligodendrocyte differentiation before myelination.
A key feature of memory processes is to link different input signals by association and to preserve this coupling at the level of synaptic connections. Late-phase long-term potentiation (L-LTP), a form of synaptic plasticity thought to encode long-term memory, requires gene transcription and protein synthesis. In this study, we report that a recently cloned coactivator of cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB), called transducer of regulated CREB activity 1 (TORC1), contributes to this process by sensing the coincidence of calcium and cAMP signals in neurons and by converting it into a transcriptional response that leads to the synthesis of factors required for enhanced synaptic transmission. We provide evidence that TORC1 is involved in L-LTP maintenance at the Schaffer collateral-CA1 synapses in the hippocampus.
Late-phase long-term potentiation (L-LTP) and long-term memory depend on the transcription of mRNA of CRE-driven genes and synthesis of proteins. However, how synaptic signals propagate to the nucleus is unclear. Here we report that the CREB coactivator TORC1 (transducer of regulated CREB activity 1) undergoes neuronal activity-induced translocation from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, a process required for CRE-dependent gene expression and L-LTP. Overexpressing a dominant-negative form of TORC1 or down-regulating TORC1 expression prevented activity-dependent transcription of CREB target genes in cultured hippocampal neurons, while overexpressing a wild-type form of TORC1 facilitated basal and activity-induced transcription of CREB target genes. Furthermore, overexpressing the dominant-negative form of TORC1 suppressed the maintenance of L-LTP without affecting early-phase LTP, while overexpressing the wild-type form of TORC1 facilitated the induction of L-LTP in hippocampal slices. Our results indicate that TORC1 is essential for CRE-driven gene expression and maintenance of long-term synaptic potentiation.
A new electrochemical method to detect and quantify the explosive compound 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT) in aqueous solutions is demonstrated. A disposable thin-film electrode modified with a droplet of a gel-polymer electrolyte (GPE) was immersed directly into samples of TNT at concentrations of 1-10 μg/mL. The GPE contained the hydrophobic room temperature ionic liquid (RTIL) trihexyltetradecylphosphonium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide ([P14,6,6,6][NTf2]) and the polymer poly(hexyl methacrylate) (PHMA). The RTIL acted to preconcentrate TNT into the GPE, and provided ionic conductivity. The polymer provided both (i) sufficient viscosity to ensure mechanical stability of the GPE, and (ii) strong hydrophobicity to minimise leaching of the RTIL. Square wave voltammetry (SWV) was performed on the first reduction peak of TNT-preconcentrated samples (15 minutes soaking with mechanical stirring), with linear plots of peak current vs. cumulative concentration of TNT, giving an averaged limit of detection of 0.37 μg/mL (aqueous phase concentration). Additionally, the voltammetry of the first reduction peak of TNT in [P14,6,6,6][NTf2] was unaffected by the presence of oxygen - in contrast to that observed in an imidazolium-based RTIL - providing excellent selectivity over oxygen in real environments. The sensor device was able to quickly and easily quantify TNT concentrations at typical groundwater contamination levels. The low-cost and portability of the sensor device, along with the minimal amounts of GPE materials required, make this a viable platform for the onsite monitoring of explosives, which is currently a significant operational challenge.
The postnatal synchronization of the circadian variation of the adrenal clock genes in mammals remains unknown. We evaluated the postnatal ontogeny of daily variation of clock genes (Clock/Bmal1/Per1/Per2/Per3/Cry1/Cry2/Rorα/Rev-Erbα) and steroidogenesis-related genes (Star and Mc2r) in rat adrenals and its relationship with the emergence of plasma corticosterone rhythm using Cosinor analysis. Plasma corticosterone circadian rhythm was detected from postnatal day (P) P1, with morning acrophase, between zeitgeber time (ZT) ZT0 and ZT2. From P14, there was a nocturnal acrophase of corticosterone at ZT20, which was associated with pups' eye opening. Since P3 there was a circadian variation of the mRNA expression of Bmal1, Per2, Per3, Cry1 genes with morning acrophase whereas Rev-Erbα had nocturnal acrophase. From P14, Bmal1, Per2, Per3, Cry1 acrophases advanced by approximately 10h, as compared to early neonatal days, becoming vespertine-nocturnal. In all postnatal ages, Per2 and Cry1 circadian profiles were synchronized in phase while Bmal1 was in antiphase with the circadian rhythm of plasma corticosterone. Adult-like Star circadian rhythm profile was observed only from P21. In conclusion, our original data demonstrated a progressive postnatal maturation of the circadian variation of the adrenal clock genes in synchrony with the development of the corticosterone circadian rhythm in rats.
Post-natal lung maturation generates a large number of small alveoli, with concomitant thinning of alveolar septal walls, generating a large gas exchange surface area but minimizing the distance traversed by the gases. This demand for a large and thin gas exchange surface area is not met in disorders of lung development, such as bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), histopathologically characterized by fewer, larger alveoli; and thickened alveolar septal walls. Diseases such as BPD are often modeled in the laboratory mouse to better understand disease pathogenesis, or develop new interventional approaches. To date, there are no reports of stereology-based longitudinal studies on post-natal mouse lung development that report dynamic changes in alveoli number or alveolar septal wall thickness during lung maturation. To this end, changes in lung structure were quantified over the first 22 months of post natal life of C57BL/6J mice. Alveolar density peaked at post-natal day (P)39, and remained unchanged at nine months (P274), but was reduced by 22 months (P669). Alveoli continued to be generated, initially at an accelerated rate between P5 and P14, and at a slower rate thereafter. Between P274 and P669, loss of alveoli was noted, without any reduction in lung volume. A progressive thinning of the alveolar septal wall was noted between P5 and P28. Pronounced sex differences were observed in alveoli number in adult, but not juvenile mice, comparing male and female mouse lungs, which were attributed exclusively to the larger volume of male mouse lungs.
Goodpasture antigen, the non-collagenous domain of α3 chain of type IV collagen [α3(IV)NC1], is the target antigen of anti-glomerular basement membrane (GBM) antibodies. The pathogenicity of T cell epitopes is not elucidated clearly. In this study, we aim to define the nephritogenic T cell epitopes and its critical amino acid residues. Twenty-four overlapping linear peptides were synthesized covering the whole sequence of human α3(IV)NC1. Wistar-Kyoto rats were immunized with linear peptides, and experimental autoimmune glomerulonephritis was evaluated. Critical amino acid was identified by the loss of nephritogenic function after each amino acid substitution by alanine. Of the 24 peptides, P14 (α3127-148 ) could induce 90.5% (19/21) of WKY rats developing anti-GBM glomerulonephritis with proteinuria, elevated serum urea and creatinine, IgG linear deposit on GBM and substantial (in average 82.4 ± 5.6%) crescent formation in glomeruli. Lymphocytes of immunized rats proliferated in response to α3127-148 and α3(IV)NC1 in vitro. Sera of these rats recognized α3127-148 and later on together with intact human α3(IV)NC1. Antibodies towards α3127-148 and intact α3(IV)NC1 could also be detected from the kidney elutes. These antibodies showed no cross-reaction with each other, which implies intramolecular epitope spreading during disease progress. After sequential amino acid substitution, the α3127-148 with substitution of tryptophan136 , isoleucine137 , leucine139 or tryptophan140 lost its nephritogenicity. Human α3127-148 is a nephritogenic T cell epitope in WKY rats, with the critical amino acids as W136 I137 xL139 W140 . These findings might facilitate future investigation on microbial aetiology and potential specific immunotherapy of anti-GBM disease.
Glial development is critical for the function of the central nervous system. CD38 is a multifunctional molecule with ADP-ribosyl cyclase activity. While critical roles of CD38 in the adult brain such as oxytocin release and social behavior have been reported, those in the developing brain remain largely unknown. Here we demonstrate that deletion of Cd38 leads to impaired development of astrocytes and oligodendrocytes in mice. CD38 is highly expressed in the developing brains between postnatal day 14 (P14) and day 28 (P28). In situ hybridization and FACS analysis revealed that CD38 is expressed predominantly in astrocytes in these periods. Analyses of the cortex of Cd38 knockout (Cd38(-/-) ) mice revealed delayed development of astrocytes and subsequently delayed differentiation of oligodendrocytes (OLs) at postnatal stages. In vitro experiments using primary OL cultures, mixed glial cultures, and astrocytic conditioned medium showed that astrocytic CD38 regulates the development of astrocytes in a cell-autonomous manner and the differentiation of OLs in a non-cell-autonomous manner. Further experiments revealed that connexin43 (Cx43) in astrocytes plays a promotive role for CD38-mediated OL differentiation. Finally, increased levels of NAD(+) , caused by CD38 deficiency, are likely to be responsible for the suppression of astrocytic Cx43 expression and OL differentiation. Our data indicate that CD38 is a positive regulator of astrocyte and OL development.
Hyperthermia after hypoxia-ischaemia (HI) in newborn infants is associated with worse neurological outcomes. Loss of thermoregulation may also be associated with greater injury.
In the postnatal-day 7 (P7) rat, the effect of 5h of graded hyperthermia (38°C or 39°C) immediately after unilateral HI was compared to normothermia (NT, 37°C), and therapeutic hypothermia (TH, 32°C). Early (negative geotaxis) and late (staircase test) behavioural testing was performed, as well as neuropathology scoring in adulthood. Separately, P7 rats were exposed to HI, and individual nesting temperatures monitored before analysis of neuropathology at P14.
Mortality increased as temperature was increased from 38°C (0%) to 39°C (50%) after HI. Hyperthermia also resulted in early behavioural deficits compared to NT animals. In adulthood, pathology scores in the thalamus, basal ganglia, cortex, and hippocampus increased as post-hypoxic temperature increased above NT. Significant global neuroprotection was seen in the TH group. However, no significant difference was seen between HI groups in the staircase test. One hour after HI, the core temperature of pups was inversely correlated with global pathology scores at P14.
Early temperature is a significant determinant of injury after experimental HI. Spontaneous decreases in core temperature after HI may confound neuroprotection studies.Pediatric Research (2017); doi:10.1038/pr.2017.51.
This study aimed to evaluate the influence of a diet based on flaxseed upon the development of the nervous system, more specifically, the optic nerve and retina.
Rats were divided into three groups: Control (CG), Flaxseed (FG), and Modified Control (MCG). The analyses were performed in the offspring (n = 6/group) at the immediate postnatal period (P0), 14 d of life (P14) and 30 d of life (P30). Descriptive analysis and histomorphometry of optic nerve and retina were performed.
There was a great evolution in the development of the nervous fascicles, connective trabeculae, and blood vessels, when comparing the three ages studied, and these characteristics were more evident in FG at all three ages. The P0, P14, and P30 retina showed similar morphology to that described in the literature. In histomorphometry, at P14, the FG presented the retina and its layers with significant increase in thickness, except for internal granular and ganglionar, whereas MCG had greater retina and photoreceptor layers thickness, inner plexiform and external granular when compared with CG (p &lt; .05).
The use of flaxseed in the pre-and postnatal period displays favourable influence on the development of rat optic nerve and retina, probably leading to myelination.
Human amnion epithelial cells (hAECs) are clonogenic and have been proposed to reduce inflammatory-induced tissue injury. Perturbation of the immune response is implicated in the pathogenesis of perinatal brain injury; modulating this response could thus be a novel therapy for treating or preventing such injury. The immunomodulatory properties of hAECs have been shown in other animal models, but a detailed investigation of the effects on brain immune cells following injury has not been undertaken. Here, we investigate the effects of hAECs on microglia, the first immune responders to injury within the brain.
We generated a mouse model combining neonatal inflammation and perinatal hyperoxia, both of which are risk factors associated with perinatal brain injury. On embryonic day 16 we administered lipopolysaccharide (LPS), or saline (control), intra-amniotically to C57Bl/6 J mouse pups. On postnatal day (P)0, LPS pups were placed in hyperoxia (65% oxygen) and control pups in normoxia for 14 days. Pups were given either hAECs or saline intravenously on P4.
At P14, relative to controls, LPS and hyperoxia pups had reduced body weight, increased density of apoptotic cells (TUNEL) in the cortex, striatum and white matter, astrocytes (GFAP) in the white matter and activated microglia (CD68) in the cortex and striatum, but no change in total microglia density (Iba1). hAEC administration rescued the decreased body weight and reduced apoptosis and astrocyte areal coverage in the white matter, but increased the density of total and activated microglia. We then stimulated primary microglia (CD45(low)CD11b(+)) with LPS for 24 h, followed by co-culture with hAEC conditioned medium for 48 h. hAEC conditioned medium increased microglial phagocytic activity, decreased microglia apoptosis and decreased M1 activation markers (CD86). Stimulating hAECs for 24 h with LPS did not alter release of cytokines known to modulate microglia activity.
These data demonstrate that hAECs can directly immunomodulate brain microglia, probably via release of trophic factors. This observation offers promise that hAECs may afford therapeutic utility in the management of perinatal brain injury.
The increase in the prevalence of obesity presents a significant health and economic problem. Obesity has been reported to be a major contributor to variety of chronic diseases. Childhood obesity has been rising over the past decades leading to various complications in health. Millions of infants and children undergo surgery every year on various health grounds. The present investigation was undertaken to evaluate the effect of spinal anesthesia of equipotent doses of ropivacaine and bupivacaine on over-weight neonatal rats.
The Sprague-Dawley rat pups were overfed on high fat diet to induce obesity. Behavioral assessments for sensory and motor blockade was made by evaluating thermal and mechanical withdrawal latencies at various time intervals following intrathecal injections of bupivacaine (5.0mg·kg(-1)) and ropivacaine (7.5mg·kg(-1)) in P14 rats. Spinal tissue was analyzed for apoptosis by determination of activated caspase-3 using monoclonal anti-activated caspase-3 and Fluoro-Jade C staining. Long-term spinal function in P30 rat pups was evaluated.
Exposure to intrathecal anesthesia in P14 increased thermal and mechanical latencies and was observed to increase apoptosis as presented by increase in activated caspase-3 and Fluro-Jade C positive cells. Significant alterations in spinal function were observed in high fat diet-fed pups as against non-obese control pups that were on standard diet. Bupivacaine produced more pronounced apoptotic effects on P14 pups; ropivacaine however produced long lasting effects as evidenced in motor function tests at P30.
Ropivacaine and bupivacaine induced spinal toxicity that was more pronounced in over-fed rat pups as against normal controls.
Perinatal hypoxia severely disrupts metabolic and somatotrophic development, as well as cerebral maturational programs. Hypoxia-inducible transcription factors (HIF) represent the most important endogenous adaptive mechanisms to hypoxia, activating a broad spectrum of growth factors that contribute to cell survival and energy homeostasis. To analyse effects of systemic hypoxia and growth hormone (GH) therapy (rhGH) on HIF-dependent growth factors during early postnatal development, we compared protein (ELISA) and mRNA levels (quantitative RT PCR) of growth factors in plasma and brain between normoxic and hypoxic mice (8% O2, 6 h; postnatal day 7, P7) at P14. Exposure to hypoxia led to reduced body weight (p&lt;0.001) and length (p&lt;0.04) compared to controls, and was associated with significantly reduced plasma levels of mouse GH (p&lt;0.01) and IGF-1 (p&lt;0.01). RhGH abrogated these hypoxia-induced changes of the GH/IGF-1 axis associated with normalization of weight and length gain until P14 compared to controls. In addition, rhGH treatment increased cerebral IGF-1, IGF-2, IGFBP-2, and EPO mRNA levels, resulting in significantly reduced apoptotic cell death in the hypoxic, developing mouse brain. These data indicate that rhGH may (i) functionally restore hypoxia-induced systemic dysregulation of the GH/IGF-1 axis, and (ii) induce up-regulation of neuroprotective, HIF-dependent growth factors in the hypoxic developing brain.
Superoxide dismutase 3, extracellular (SOD3) polymorphisms have been implicated in reduced pulmonary function development and altered risk for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. We previously reported that gene-targeted Sod3-/- mice have impaired lung function and human SOD3 variants are associated with reduced pulmonary function in children. Reduced lung SOD3 levels were reported in mice with lower lung function with the greatest difference occurring during alveogenesis phase [postnatal (P) days 14-28]. Interactions between homeobox (HOX), wingless-type MMTV integration site member (WNT), and fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling govern complex developmental processes in several organs. A subset of HOX family members, HOXA5 and HOXB5, is expressed in the developing lung. Therefore, in this study we assessed the transcript expression of these family members and their downstream targets in Sod3-/- mice during alveogenesis (P14). In the lung of Sod3-/- mice, Hoxa5 and Hoxb5 increased. These transcription factors regulate WNT gene expression and were accompanied by increases in their downstream targets Wnt2 and Wnt5A, canonical and noncanonical WNT members, respectively. The WNT signaling target, lymphoid enhancer binding factor 1 (Lef1), also increased along with its downstream targets Fgf2, Fgf7, and Fgf10 in the lungs of Sod3-/- mice. Due to limited knowledge on the role of FGF2 in lung development, we further examined FGF2 protein and found increased levels in the bronchial and alveolar type II epithelial cells of Sod3-/- mice compared to age-matched controls. Thus, our findings suggest that deficient management of extracellular superoxide can lead to altered lung developmental signaling during alveogenesis in mice.
Prenatal maternal infection and maternal iron deficiency during pregnancy are 2 early environmental insults associated with increased risk for schizophrenia in offspring. Substantial evidence suggests that abnormalities in inhibitory γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) interneuron function, especially in the parvalbumin subtype of GABA interneuron, both developmentally and in adulthood, may contribute mechanistically to cognitive deficits and psychotic symptoms in schizophrenia. This study used a rat model to test whether prenatal immune activation with lipopolysaccharide (LPS; at gestation days, GD, 15 and 16) or maternal iron deficiency (from GD2 to postnatal day P7) or the combination of both insults alters major subtypes of GABAergic interneurons (parvalbumin, somatostatin, cholecystokinin) in brain regions relevant to schizophrenia (medial and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex [PFC], hippocampal CA1 and dentate gyrus, ventral subiculum) in offspring at P14 or P28. Prenatal LPS treatment significantly increased the density of parvalbumin-immunoreactive neurons at P14 in the medial PFC, dorsolateral PFC, and ventral subiculum of offspring born from iron-sufficient but not iron-deficient dams. Prenatal LPS also increased cholecystokinin neuron density in the medial PFC at P28, under both iron-sufficient and iron-deficient conditions. We observed a large increase in parvalbumin neuron density from P14 to P28 in the medial PFC and subiculum across all birth groups, that was not observed in other brain regions, and significant decreases in somatostatin neuron density from P14 to P28 in all brain regions examined across all birth groups, indicating differential developmental trajectories for parvalbumin and somatostatin neurons in various brain regions during this early postnatal period. Thus, it appears that the medial PFC and ventral subiculum, brain regions involved in circuitry modulating ventral tegmental dopamine and nucleus accumbens activities, may be regions vulnerable to effects of prenatal LPS on specific subpopulations of interneurons. It is known that the timing of maturation and expansion of parvalbumin neurons in early development provides threshold levels of inhibition that trigger critical periods for cortical plasticity, leading to long-term circuit consolidation. Thus, our finding of increased parvalbumin neuron density at early developmental times might suggest a mechanism by which an acute prenatal insult like LPS exposure could produce long-term changes in prefrontal cortical or subicular function.
Differentiating malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) from reactive mesothelial hyperplasia (RMH) is still challenging. Detection of homozygous deletion (HD) of 9p21 region including p16(INK4A) (p16) by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and immunohistochemical detection of loss of BRCA1 associated protein 1 (BAP1), are reliable markers for MPM diagnosis. However, not all laboratories are equipped to perform 9p21 FISH; immunohistochemistry (IHC) is a more common and feasible technique. Thus, we sought to develop a IHC-based method that could predict the deletion of p16 in MPM in concordance with 9p21 FISH.
We examined the expression of the 9p21.3-related proteins (p14, p15, p16, and methylthioadenosine phosphorylase (MTAP)) and BAP1 using IHC in 51 MPM and 25 RMH cases, and assessed their correlation with HD of p16 detected by FISH. The diagnostic usefulness of IHC of the 9p21.3-related proteins and BAP1 and their combinations was assessed using the cut-off values set by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis.
Among the 9p21.3-related proteins, MTAP IHC findings showed best concordance with 9p21 FISH results (kappa coefficient of 0.69) and a specificity of 100%. We also examined the combinations of MTAP IHC with the other products. The loss of p16 and MTAP had better concordance (kappa coefficient of 0.71), although lower specificity (85%). For differentiating MPM from RMH, only MTAP showed 100% specificity among the 9p21.3-related proteins, as did BAP1 IHC and 9p21 FISH. Among BAP1 combinations, only that of BAP1 with MTAP showed 100% specificity. Its sensitivity was 76.5%, which was lower than BAP1 IHC and 9p21 FISH combination (84.3%), but higher than BAP1 IHC alone (60.8%) or 9p21 FISH alone (60.8%).
A combination of MTAP or BAP1 loss detected by IHC can likely detect MPM with good sensitivity and 100% specificity, and serve as useful ancillary IHC for discriminating MPM from RMH.
The purpose of this preliminary study was to assess whether the dual somatosensory evoked potential (SEP) technique is sensitive enough to measure changes in cortical intrinsic inhibitory interactions in patients with chronic neck or upper extremity pain and, if so, whether changes are associated with changes in pain scores.
The dual peripheral nerve stimulation SEP ratio technique was used for 6 subjects with a history of chronic neck or upper limb pain. SEPs were recorded after left or right median and ulnar nerve stimulation at the wrist. SEP ratios were calculated for the N9, N13, P14-18, N20-P25, and P22-N30 peak complexes from SEP amplitudes obtained from simultaneous median and ulnar stimulation divided by the arithmetic sum of SEPs obtained from individual stimulation of the median and ulnar nerves. Outcome measures of SEP ratios and subjects' visual analog scale rating of pains were recorded at baseline, after a 2-week usual care control period, and after 12 weeks of multimodal chiropractic care (chiropractic spinal manipulation and 1 or more of the following: exercises, peripheral joint adjustments/manipulation, soft tissue therapy, and pain education).
A significant decrease in the median and ulnar to median plus ulnar ratio and the median and ulnar amplitude for the cortical P22-N30 SEP component was observed after 12 weeks of chiropractic care, with no changes after the control period. There was a significant decrease in visual analog scale scores (both for current pain and for pain last week).
The dual SEP ratio technique appears to be sensitive enough to measure changes in cortical intrinsic inhibitory interactions in patients with chronic neck pain. The observations in 6 subjects revealed that 12 weeks of chiropractic care improved suppression of SEPs evoked by dual upper limb nerve stimulation at the level of the motor cortex, premotor areas, and/or subcortical areas such as basal ganglia and/or thalamus. It is possible that these findings explain one of the mechanisms by which chiropractic care improves function and reduces pain for chronic pain patients.
The retinal degeneration 11 (rd11) mouse is a new animal model with rapid photoreceptor degeneration. The long-term efficacy of gene therapy has a direct relationship with the onset of photoreceptor degeneration or apoptosis, whereas the degeneration or apoptosis patterns of photoreceptors are still unclear in rd11 mice. The distribution patterns of cone function-related L- and S-opsin were examined by immunofluorescence staining, and the apoptosis was performed by TUNEL assay in rd11 mice. The expression pattern of L-opsin or S-opsin in rd11 retina at postnatal day (P) 14 was similar to the pattern observed in wildtype retina. With increasing age, the expression of L-opsin and S-opsin, especially S-opsin, decreased significantly in rd11 mice. The degeneration of L-opsin began around the optic nerve and expanded to the periphery of the retina, from the ventral/nasal to dorsal/temporal retina, whereas the expression of S-opsin gradually decreased from the dorsal/temporal to ventral/nasal retina. Apoptotic signal appeared at P14 and was strongest at P28 of rd11 mice. The key genes associated with apoptosis confirmed those changes. These indicated that the degeneration and apoptosis of cone photoreceptors began at P14 of rd11 mice, which was a key point for gene therapy.
Cell-mediated autoimmunity, especially autoreactive T cells, is crucial in the initiation of anti-glomerular membrane (GBM) disease. Epitopes for T cells on Goodpasture autoantigen are not fully defined. This study investigated T cell epitopes in anti-GBM patients, aiming to identify the epitopes and their clinical significance.
Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were collected from 13 patients with anti-GBM disease. Twenty-four overlapping linear peptides were synthesized covering the whole sequence of human α3(IV)NC1. PBMC response to each peptide was detected by proliferation assay. Their associations with clinical features were further analyzed.
PBMC proliferative responses to linear peptides on α3(IV)NC1 could be detected in all patients. Five major epitopes were identified as stimulatory in over half of the patients: α3(IV)NC1127-148 (P14) (69.2%), α3(IV)NC1159-178 (77.8%), α3(IV)NC1179-198 (55.6%), α3(IV)NC1189-208 (P19) (75.0%) and α3(IV)NC1141-154 (57.1%). P14 and P19 were highly recognized in patients comparing with healthy controls (69.2% vs. 0.0%, p = 0.011; 75.0% vs. 0.0%, p = 0.021, respectively).
T cell proliferation to linear epitopes was detected in human anti-GBM disease. α3127-148 was a mutual T and B cell epitope, implying its initial role in epitope spreading process.
Spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) is widely used in clinical ophthalmology and recently gained popularity in laboratory research involving small rodents. Its noninvasive nature allows repeated measurements, thereby decreasing the number of animals required. However, when used at a conventional dosage, xylazine (an α2-adrenoceptor) can cause irreversible corneal calcification, especially among young rodents. In the present study, we test whether corneal calcification associated with xylazine is mediated by the α2-adrenoceptor.
Our study tested Sprague-Dawley rats, Long-Evans rats, and CD-1 mice (postnatal day [P]14). Retinal images were captured by SD-OCT. Quantitative PCR (qPCR) was used to study gene expression, whereas receptor localization was examined by immunofluorescent staining followed by confocal microscopy. Calcium deposits were detected via von Kossa staining.
When used at dosages appropriate for adult animals, ketamine-xylazine anesthetics led to a high rate of respiratory failure, increased apoptotic activity in the corneal epithelium, and irreversible corneal calcification in P14 rat pups. Meanwhile, OCT image quality decreased drastically as a result of corneal calcification among animals recovering from anesthesia. α2-Adrenoceptor subtypes were highly expressed on P14, in line with rodents' age-specific sensitivity to xylazine. Clonidine, a potent α2-adrenoceptor agonist, dose-dependently induced corneal calcification, which could be prevented by an α2-adrenoceptor antagonist.
These data suggest that α2-adrenoceptors contribute to corneal calcification in young rodents. Therefore, we developed a suitable OCT imaging protocol for this cohort, including a carefully tailored ketamine-xylazine dosage (60 mg/kg and 2.5 kg/mg, respectively).
Bacteriophages are viruses that infect bacteria, and consequently they have a major impact on the development of a microbial population. In this study, the genome of a novel broad host range bacteriophage, Aquamicrobium phage P14, isolated from a wastewater treatment plant, was analyzed. The Aquamicrobium phage P14 was found to infect members of different Proteobacteria classes (Alphaproteobacteria and Betaproteobacteria). This phage contains a 40,551 bp long genome and 60% of its genes had blastx hits. Furthermore, the bacteriophage was found to share more than 50% of its genes with several podoviruses and has the same gene order as other polyvalent bacteriophages. The results obtained in this study led to the conclusion that indeed general features of the genome of the Aquamicrobium phage P14 are shared with other broad host range bacteriophages, however further analysis of the genome is needed in order to identify the specific mechanisms which enable the bacteriophage to infect both Alphaproteobacteria and Betaproteobacteria.
We previously reported a novel association between CDKN2A nonpromoter methylation and transcription (ARF/INK4a) in human papillomavirus associated oropharyngeal tumors. In this study we assessed whether nonpromoter CDKN2A methylation in laryngeal squamous cell carcinomas (LXSCC) conferred a similar association with transcription that predicted patient outcome. We compared DNA methylation and ARF/INK4a RNA expression levels for the CDKN2A locus using the Illumina HumanMethylation27 beadchip and RT-PCR in 43 LXSCC tumor samples collected from a prospective study of head and neck cancer patients treated at Montefiore Medical Center (MMC). Validation was performed using RNAseq data on 111 LXSCC tumor samples from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). The clinical relevance of combined nonpromoter CDKN2A methylation and transcription was assessed by multivariate Cox regression for locoregional recurrence on a subset of 69 LXSCC patients with complete clinicopathologic data from the MMC and TCGA cohorts. We found evidence of CDKN2A nonpromoter hypermethylation in a third of LXSCC from our MMC cohort, which was significantly associated with increased ARF and INK4a RNA expression (Wilcoxon rank-sum, P = 0.007 and 0.003, respectively). A similar association was confirmed in TCGA samples (Wilcoxon rank-sum test P &lt; 0.0001 for ARF and INK4a). Patients with CDKN2A hypermethylation or high ARF/INK4a expression were significantly less likely to develop a locoregional recurrence compared to those with neither of the features, independent of other clinicopatholgic risk factors (adjusted hazard ratio=0.21, 95% confidence interval:0.05-0.81). These results support the conclusion that CDKN2A nonpromoter methylation is associated with increased ARF and INK4a RNA expression, and improved locoregional control in LXSCC.
Mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1)-dependent protein synthesis is required for many forms of synaptic plasticity and memory, but the downstream pathways important for synaptic plasticity are poorly understood. Long-term facilitation (LTF) in Aplysia is a form of synaptic plasticity that is closely linked to behavioural memory and an attractive model system for examining the important downstream targets for mTORC1 in regulating synaptic plasticity. While mTORC1 regulated protein synthesis has been strongly linked to translation initiation, translation elongation is also regulated by mTORC1 and LTF leads to an mTORC1 dependent decrease in eukaryotic elongation factor 2 (eEF2) phosphorylation. The purpose of this study is to test the hypothesis that the decrease in eEF2 phosphorylation is required for mTORC1-dependent translation and plasticity. We show that the LTF-induced decrease in eEF2 phosphorylation is blocked by expression of an eEF2 kinase (eEF2K) modified to be resistant to mTORC1 regulation. We found that expression of this modified kinase blocked LTF. LTF requires local protein synthesis of the neuropeptide sensorin and importantly, local sensorin synthesis can be measured using a dendra fluorescent protein containing the 5' and 3' untranslated regions (UTRs) of sensorin. Using this construct, we show that blocking eEF2 dephosphorylation also blocks the increase in local sensorin synthesis. These results identify decreases in eEF2 phosphorylation as a critical downstream effector of mTOR required for long-term plasticity and identify an important translational target regulated by decreases in eEF2 phosphorylation.

Dysregulation of the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1)-p70 ribosomal protein kinase 1 (S6K1) signaling pathway occurs frequently in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients. This pathway also plays a critical role in maintaining normal cellular processes. Given the importance of leukemia stem cells (LSC) in the development of minimal residual disease (MRD), it is critical to use therapeutic interventions that target LSC population to prevent disease relapse. mTORC1-S6K1 pathway has been identified as an important regulator of hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) and LSC functions. Both HSC and LSC functions require regulation of key cellular processes including proliferation, metabolism and autophagy, which are regulated by mTORC1 pathway. Despite mTORC1-S6K1 pathway being a critical regulator of AML initiation and progression, inhibitors of this pathway alone have yielded mixed results in clinical studies. Recent studies have identified strategies to develop new mTORC1-S6K1 inhibitors like RapaLink-1, which could circumvent the drug resistance observed in AML cells as well as in LSC. In this article, we review recent advances made in identifying the role of different components of this pathway in the regulation of HSC and LSC along with possible therapeutic approaches.
RNA polymerase III (pol III) synthesizes short non-coding RNAs, many of which are essential for translation. Accordingly, pol III activity is tightly regulated with cell growth and proliferation by factors such as MYC, RB1, TRP53, and MAF1. MAF1 is a repressor of pol III transcription whose activity is controlled by phosphorylation; in particular, it is inactivated through phosphorylation by the TORC1 kinase complex, a sensor of nutrient availability. Pol III regulation is thus sensitive to environmental cues, yet a diurnal profile of pol III transcription activity is so far lacking. Here we first use gene expression arrays to measure mRNA accumulation during the diurnal cycle in the livers of (i) wild-type mice, (ii) arrhythmic Arntl knockout mice, (iii) mice fed at regular intervals during both night and day, and (iv) mice lacking the Maf1 gene, and so provide a comprehensive view of the changes in cyclic mRNA accumulation occurring in these different systems. We then show that pol III occupancy of its target genes rises before the onset of the night, stays high during the night, when mice normally ingest food and when translation is known to be increased, and decreases in daytime. Whereas higher pol III occupancy during the night reflects a MAF1-dependent response to feeding, the rise of pol III occupancy before the onset of the night reflects a circadian clock-dependent response. Thus, pol III transcription during the diurnal cycle is regulated both in response to nutrients and by the circadian clock, which allows anticipatory pol III transcription.
The mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) protein kinase is a master growth regulator that becomes activated at the lysosome in response to nutrient cues. Here, we identify cholesterol, an essential building block for cellular growth, as a nutrient input that drives mTORC1 recruitment and activation at the lysosomal surface. The lysosomal transmembrane protein, SLC38A9, is required for mTORC1 activation by cholesterol through conserved cholesterol-responsive motifs. Moreover, SLC38A9 enables mTORC1 activation by cholesterol independently from its arginine-sensing function. Conversely, the Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1) protein, which regulates cholesterol export from the lysosome, binds to SLC38A9 and inhibits mTORC1 signaling through its sterol transport function. Thus, lysosomal cholesterol drives mTORC1 activation and growth signaling through the SLC38A9-NPC1 complex.
Whereas autism spectrum disorder (ASD) exhibits striking heterogeneity in genetics and clinical presentation, dysfunction of mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling pathway has been identified as a molecular feature common to several well-characterized syndromes with high prevalence of ASD. Additionally, recent findings have also implicated mTORC1 signaling abnormalities in a subset of nonsyndromic ASD, suggesting that defective mTORC1 pathway may be a potential converging mechanism in ASD pathology across different etiologies. However, the mechanistic evidence for a causal link between aberrant mTORC1 pathway activity and ASD neurobehavioral features varies depending on the ASD form involved. In this review, we first discuss six monogenic ASD-related syndromes, including both classical and potentially novel mTORopathies, highlighting their contribution to our understanding of the neurobiological mechanisms underlying ASD, and then we discuss existing evidence suggesting that aberrant mTORC1 signaling may also play a role in nonsyndromic ASD.
The Target of Rapamycin (TOR) kinase is a conserved regulator of cell growth and functions within 2 different protein complexes, TORC1 and TORC2, where TORC2 positively controls macroautophagy/autophagy during amino acid starvation. Under these conditions, TORC2 signaling inhibits the activity of the calcium-regulated phosphatase calcineurin and promotes the general amino acid control (GAAC) response and autophagy. Here we demonstrate that TORC2 regulates calcineurin by controlling the respiratory activity of mitochondria. In particular, we find that mitochondrial oxidative stress affects the calcium channel regulatory protein Mid1, which we show is an essential upstream activator of calcineurin. Thus, these findings describe a novel regulation for autophagy that involves TORC2 signaling, mitochondrial respiration, and calcium homeostasis.
The anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family protein myeloid cell leukemia-1 (Mcl-1) plays an important role in breast cancer cell survival and chemoresistance. We have previously shown that knockdown of the 40S ribosomal protein S6 kinase-2 (S6K2), which acts downstream of the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1), enhanced breast cancer cell death by apoptotic stimuli. The increase in cell death by S6K2 depletion was partly due to inactivation of Akt. In the present study, we investigated if S6K2 regulates Mcl-1, which acts downstream of Akt. Silencing of S6K2 but not S6K1 in T47D cells decreased Mcl-1 level, and potentiated apoptosis induced by TRAIL and doxorubicin. Knockdown of S6K2 also decreased the level of anti-apoptotic Bcl-xl. Depletion of the tumor suppressor protein PDCD4 (programmed cell death 4), which regulates translation of several anti-apoptotic proteins, reversed downregulation of Bcl-xl but not Mcl-1 and failed to reverse the effect of S6K2 knockdown on potentiation of doxorubicin-induced apoptosis. Downregulation of Mcl-1 by S6K2 knockdown was partly restored by the proteasome inhibitor MG132. Overexpression of catalytically-active Akt or knockdown of glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK3)-β, a substrate for Akt, had little effect on Mcl-1 downregulation caused by S6K2 deficiency. Silencing of S6K2 increased the level of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and knockdown of JNK1 increased basal Mcl-1 level and partly reversed the effect of S6K2 knockdown on Mcl-1 downregulation. JNK1 knockdown also had a modest effect in attenuating the increase in doxorubicin-induced apoptosis caused by S6K2 deficiency. These results suggest that S6K2 regulates apoptosis via multiple mechanisms, and involves both Akt and JNK.
Robust dengue virus (DENV) replication requires lipophagy, a selective autophagy that targets lipid droplets. The autophagic mobilization of lipids leads to increased β-oxidation in DENV-infected cells. The mechanism by which DENV induces lipophagy is unknown. Here, we show that infection with DENV activates the metabolic regulator 5' adenosine-monophosphate activated kinase (AMPK), and that the silencing or pharmacological inhibition of AMPK activity decreases DENV replication and the induction of lipophagy. The activity of mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1), decreases in DENV-infected cells and is inversely correlated to lipophagy induction. Constitutive activation of mTORC1 by depletion of tuberous sclerosis complex 2 (TSC2) inhibits lipophagy induction in DENV-infected cells, and decreases viral replication. While AMPK normally stimulates TSC2-dependent inactivation of mTORC1 signaling, mTORC1 inactivation is independent of AMPK activation during DENV infection. Thus, DENV stimulates and requires AMPK signaling, as well as AMPK-independent suppression of mTORC1 activity for proviral lipophagy.IMPORTANCE Dengue virus alters host cell lipid metabolism to promote its infection. One mechanism for altered metabolism is the induction of a selective autophagy that targets lipid droplets, termed lipophagy. Lipophagy mobilizes lipid stores resulting in enhanced β-oxidation and viral replication. We show here that DENV infection activates and requires the central metabolic regulator AMPK for its replication and the induction of lipophagy. This is required for the induction of lipophagy, but not basal autophagy, in DENV-infected cells.
The enhanced rate of protein synthesis in skeletal muscle cells results in a net increase in total protein content that leads to skeletal muscle growth/hypertrophy. The mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)-dependent regulation of the activity of mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) and subsequent protein synthesis has been suggested as a regulatory mechanism; however, the exact molecular processes underlying such a regulation are poorly defined. The purpose of this study was to investigate regulatory mechanisms involved in the MEK/ERK-dependent pathway leading to mTORC1 activation in skeletal muscle cells. Treatment with phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA), a potent agonist of protein kinase C (PKC) and its downstream effector in the MEK/ERK-dependent pathway, resulted in the activation of mTORC1 signaling and phosphorylation of the upstream regulator tuberous sclerosis 2 (TSC2) in C2C12 myoblasts. PMA-induced activation of mTORC1 signaling was partially prevented by treatment with U0126 (a selective inhibitor of MEK1/2) or BIX-02189 (a selective inhibitor of MEK5) and completely blocked with BIM-I (a selective inhibitor of upstream PKC). TSC2 phosphorylation at Ser664 (an ERK-dependent phosphorylation site) was prevented with U0126, and BIM-I treatment blocked PMA-induced phosphorylation of TSC2 at multiple residues (Ser664, Ser939, and Thr1462). Overexpression of Ras homolog enriched in brain (Rheb), a downstream target of TSC2, and an mTORC1 activator, was sufficient to activate mTORC1 signaling. We also identified that PMA-induced activation of mTORC1 signaling was significantly inhibited in the absence of Rheb with siRNA knockdown. These observations demonstrate that the PKC/MEK/ERK-dependent activation of mTORC1 is mediated through TSC2 phosphorylation and its downstream target Rheb in C2C12 myoblasts.
Ribosome biogenesis is a major energy-consuming process in the cell that has to be rapidly down-regulated in response to stress or nutrient depletion. The target of rapamycin 1 (Tor1) pathway regulates synthesis of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) at the level of transcription initiation. It remains unclear whether ribosome biogenesis is also controlled directly at the posttranscriptional level. We show that Tor1 and casein kinase 2 (CK2) kinases regulate a rapid switch between a productive and a non-productive pre-rRNA processing pathways in yeast. Under stress, the pre-rRNA continues to be synthesized; however, it is processed differently, and no new ribosomes are produced. Strikingly, the control of the switch does not require the Sch9 kinase, indicating that an unrecognized Tor Complex 1 (TORC1) signaling branch involving CK2 kinase directly regulates ribosome biogenesis at the posttranscriptional level.
The Target of Rapamycin (TOR) signalling network plays important roles in aging and disease. The AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and the Gsk3 kinase inhibit TOR during stress. We performed genetic interaction screens using synthetic genetic arrays (SGA) with gsk3 and amk2 as query mutants, the latter encoding the regulatory subunit of AMPK. We identified 69 negative and 82 positive common genetic interactors, with functions related to cellular growth and stress. The 120 gsk3-specific negative interactors included genes functioning in translation and ribosomes. The 215 amk2-specific negative interactors included genes functioning in chromatin silencing and DNA damage repair. Both amk2- and gsk3-specific interactors were enriched in phenotype categories related to abnormal cell size and shape. We also performed SGA screen with the amk2 gsk3 double mutant as a query. Mutants sensitive to 5-fluorouracil, an anticancer drug are under-represented within the 305 positive interactors specific for the amk2 gsk3 query. The triple-mutant SGA screen showed higher number of negative interactions than the double mutant SGA screens and uncovered additional genetic network information. These results reveal common and specialized roles of AMPK and Gsk3 in mediating TOR-dependent processes, indicating that AMPK and Gsk3 act in parallel to inhibit TOR function in fission yeast.
Targeting mTORC1 has been thoroughly explored in cancer therapy. Following encouraging preclinical studies, mTORC1 inhibitors however failed to provide substantial benefits in cancer patients. Several resistance mechanisms have been identified including mutations of mTOR and activation of alternate proliferation pathways. Moreover, emerging evidence discloses intratumoral heterogeneity of mTORC1 activity that further contributes to a reduced anticancer efficacy of mTORC1 inhibitors. Genetic heterogeneity as well as heterogeneous conditions of the tumor environment such as hypoxia profoundly modifies mTORC1 activity in tumors and hence influences the response of tumors to mTORC1 inhibitors. Intriguingly, the heterogeneity of mTORC1 activity also occurs towards its substrates at the single cell level, as mutually exclusive pattern of activation of mTORC1 downstream effectors has been reported in tumors. After briefly describing mTORC1 biology and the use of mTORC1 inhibitors in patients, this review will give an overview on concepts of resistance to mTORC1 inhibition in cancer with a particular focus on intratumoral heterogeneity of mTORC1 activity.
Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) denotes cancer originated from the renal epithelium and accounts for &gt;90% of cancers in the kidney. The disease encompasses &gt;10 histological and molecular subtypes, of which clear cell RCC (ccRCC) is most common and accounts for most cancer-related deaths. Although somatic VHL mutations have been described for some time, more-recent cancer genomic studies have identified mutations in epigenetic regulatory genes and demonstrated marked intra-tumour heterogeneity, which could have prognostic, predictive and therapeutic relevance. Localized RCC can be successfully managed with surgery, whereas metastatic RCC is refractory to conventional chemotherapy. However, over the past decade, marked advances in the treatment of metastatic RCC have been made, with targeted agents including sorafenib, sunitinib, bevacizumab, pazopanib and axitinib, which inhibit vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and its receptor (VEGFR), and everolimus and temsirolimus, which inhibit mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1), being approved. Since 2015, agents with additional targets aside from VEGFR have been approved, such as cabozantinib and lenvatinib; immunotherapies, such as nivolumab, have also been added to the armamentarium for metastatic RCC. Here, we provide an overview of the biology of RCC, with a focus on ccRCC, as well as updates to complement the current clinical guidelines and an outline of potential future directions for RCC research and therapy.
Tight coupling of cell growth and cell cycle progression enable cells to adjust their rate of division, and therefore size, to the demands of proliferation in varying nutritional environments. Nutrient stress promotes inhibition of Target Of Rapamycin Complex 1 (TORC1) activity. In fission yeast, reduced TORC1 activity advances mitotic onset and switches growth to a sustained proliferation at reduced cell size. A screen for mutants, that failed to advance mitosis upon nitrogen stress, identified a mutant in the PIKFYVE 1-phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate 5-kinase fission yeast homolog Ste12. Ste12PIKFYVE deficient mutants were unable to advance the cell cycle to reduce cell size after a nitrogen downshift to poor nitrogen (proline) growth conditions. While it is well established that PI(3,5)P2 signalling is required for autophagy and that Ste12PIKFYVE mutants have enlarged vacuoles (yeast lysosomes), neither a block to autophagy or mutants that independently have enlarged vacuoles had any impact upon nitrogen control of mitotic commitment. The addition of rapamycin to Ste12PIKFYVE deficient mutants reduced cell size at division to suggest that Ste12PIKFYVE possibly functions upstream of TORC1. ste12 mutants display increased Torin1 (TOR inhibitor) sensitivity. However, no major impact on TORC1 or TORC2 activity was observed in the ste12 deficient mutants. In summary, Ste12PIKFYVE is required for nitrogen-stress mediated advancement of mitosis to reduce cell size at division.
Glucagon-like peptide-2 (GLP-2) is co-secreted with GLP-1 from gut endocrine cells, and both peptides act as growth factors to expand the surface area of the mucosal epithelium. Notably, GLP-2 also enhances glucose and lipid transport in enterocytes; however, its actions on control of amino acid (AA) transport remain unclear. Here we examined the mechanisms linking gain and loss of GLP-2 receptor (GLP-2R) signaling to control of intestinal amino acid absorption in mice.
Absorption, transport, and clearance of essential AAs, specifically lysine, were measured in vivo by Liquid Chromatography triple quadrupole Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) and ex vivo with Ussing chambers using intestinal preparations from Glp2r(+/+) and Glp2r(-/-) mice. Immunoblotting determined jejunal levels of protein components of signaling pathways (PI3K-AKT, and mTORC1-pS6-p4E-BP1) following administration of GLP-2, protein gavage, and rapamycin to fasted Glp2r(+/+) and Glp2r(-/-) mice. Expression of AA transporters from full thickness jejunum and 4F2hc from brush border membrane vesicles (BBMVs) was measured by real-time PCR and immunoblotting, respectively.
Acute administration of GLP-2 increased basal AA absorption in vivo and augmented basal lysine transport ex vivo. GLP-2-stimulated lysine transport was attenuated by co-incubation with wortmannin, rapamycin, or tetrodotoxin ex vivo. Phosphorylation of mTORC1 effector proteins S6 and 4E-BP1 was significantly increased in wild-type mice in response to GLP-2 alone, or when co-administered with protein gavage, and abolished following oral gavage of rapamycin. In contrast, activation of GLP-1R signaling did not enhance S6 phosphorylation. Disruption of GLP-2 action in Glp2r(-/-) mice reduced lysine transport ex vivo and attenuated the phosphorylation of S6 and 4E-BP1 in response to oral protein. Moreover, the expression of cationic AA transporter slc7a9 in response to refeeding, and the abundance of 4F2hc in BBMVs following protein gavage, was significantly attenuated in Glp2r(-/-) mice.
These findings reveal an important role for GLP-2R signaling in the physiological and pharmacological control of enteral amino acid sensing and assimilation, defining an enteroendocrine cell-enterocyte axis for optimal energy absorption.
Oleaginous organisms are a promising, renewable source of single cell oil. Lipid accumulation is mainly induced by limitation of nutrients such as nitrogen, phosphorus or sulfur. The oleaginous yeast Trichosporon oleaginosus accumulates up to 70% w/w lipid under nitrogen stress, while cultivation in non-limiting media only yields 9% w/w lipid. Uncoupling growth from lipid accumulation is key for the industrial process applicability of oleaginous yeasts. This study evaluates the effects of rapamycin on TOR specific signaling pathways associated with lipogenesis in Trichosporon oleaginosus for the first time.
Supplementation of rapamycin to nutrient rich cultivation medium led to an increase in lipid yield of up to 38% g/L. This effect plateaued at 40 μM rapamycin. Interestingly, the fatty acid spectrum resembled that observed with cultivation under nitrogen limitation. Significant changes in growth characteristics included a 19% increase in maximum cell density and a 12% higher maximum growth rate. T. oleaginosus only has one Tor gene much like the oleaginous yeast Rhodosporidium toruloides. Consequently, we analyzed the effect of rapamycin on T. oleaginosus specific TORC signaling using bioinformatic methodologies.
We confirm, that target of rapamycin complex 1 (TORC1) is involved in control of lipid production and cell proliferation in T. oleaginosus and present a homology based signaling network. Signaling of lipid induction by TORC1 and response to carbon depletion to this complex appear to be conserved, whereas response to nitrogen limitation and autophagy are not. This work serves as a basis for further investigation regarding the control and induction of lipid accumulation in oil yeasts.
Zinc is an essential nutrient for all forms of life. Within cells, most zinc is bound to protein. Because zinc serves as a catalytic or structural cofactor for many proteins, cells must maintain zinc homeostasis under severely zinc-deficient conditions. In yeast, the transcription factor Zap1 controls the expression of genes required for uptake and mobilization of zinc, but to date the fate of existing zinc-binding proteins under zinc starvation remains poorly understood. Autophagy is an evolutionarily conserved cellular degradation/recycling process in which cytoplasmic proteins and organelles are sequestered for degradation in the vacuole/lysosome. In this study, we investigated how autophagy functions under zinc starvation. Zinc depletion induced non-selective autophagy, which is important for zinc-limited growth. Induction of autophagy by zinc starvation was not directly related to transcriptional activation of Zap1. Instead, TORC1 inactivation directed zinc starvation-induced autophagy. Abundant zinc proteins, such as Adh1, Fba1, and ribosomal protein Rpl37, were degraded in an autophagy-dependent manner. But the targets of autophagy were not restricted to zinc-binding proteins. When cellular zinc is severely depleted, this non-selective autophagy plays a role in releasing zinc from the degraded proteins and recycling zinc for other essential purposes.
The target of rapamycin (TOR) protein kinase forms multi-subunit TOR complex 1 (TORC1) and TOR complex 2 (TORC2), which exhibit distinct substrate specificities. Sin1 is one of the TORC2-specific subunit essential for phosphorylation and activation of certain AGC-family kinases. Here, we show that Sin1 is dispensable for the catalytic activity of TORC2, but its conserved region in the middle (Sin1CRIM) forms a discrete domain that specifically binds the TORC2 substrate kinases. Sin1CRIM fused to a different TORC2 subunit can recruit the TORC2 substrate Gad8 for phosphorylation even in the sin1 null mutant of fission yeast. The solution structure of Sin1CRIM shows a ubiquitin-like fold with a characteristic acidic loop, which is essential for interaction with the TORC2 substrates. The specific substrate-recognition function is conserved in human Sin1CRIM, which may represent a potential target for novel anticancer drugs that prevent activation of the mTORC2 substrates such as AKT.
T-cell-mediated immune responses aim to protect mammals against cancers and infections, and are also involved in the pathogenesis of various inflammatory or autoimmune diseases. Cellular uptake and the utilization of nutrients is closely related to the T-cell fate decision and function. Research in this area has yielded surprising findings in the importance of amino-acid transporters for T-cell development, homeostasis, activation, differentiation and memory. In this review, we present current information on amino-acid transporters, such as LAT1 (l-leucine transporter), ASCT2 (l-glutamine transporter) and GAT-1 (γ-aminobutyric acid transporter-1), which are critically important for mediating peripheral naive T-cell homeostasis, activation and differentiation, especially for Th1 and Th17 cells, and even memory T cells. Mechanically, the influence of amino-acid transporters on T-cell fate decision may largely depend on the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling. These discoveries remarkably demonstrate the role of amino-acid transporters in T-cell fate determination, and strongly indicate that manipulation of the amino-acid transporter-mTORC1 axis could ameliorate many inflammatory or autoimmune diseases associated with T-cell-based immune responses.
Although growth factors and chemokines elicit different overall effects on cells-growth and chemotaxis, respectively-and activate distinct classes of cell-surface receptors, nonetheless, they trigger similar cellular activities and signaling pathways. The growth factor M-CSF and the chemokine CXCL12 both stimulate the endocytic process of macropinocytosis, and both activate the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1), a protein complex that regulates cell metabolism. Recent studies of signaling by M-CSF in macrophages identified a role for macropinocytosis in the activation of mTORC1, in which delivery of extracellular amino acids into lysosomes via macropinocytosis was required for activation of mTORC1. Here, we analyzed the regulation of macropinosome (MP) formation in response to CXCL12 and identified 2 roles for macropinocytosis in the activation of mTORC1. Within 5 min of adding CXCL12, murine macrophages increased ruffling, macropinocytosis and amino acid-dependent activation of mTORC1. Inhibitors of macropinocytosis blocked activation of mTORC1, and various isoform-specific inhibitors of type 1 PI3K and protein kinase C (PKC) showed similar patterns of inhibition of macropinocytosis and mTORC1 activity. However, unlike the response to M-CSF, Akt phosphorylation (pAkt) in response to CXCL12 required the actin cytoskeleton and the formation of macropinocytic cups. Quantitative fluorescence microscopy showed that phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate (PIP3), a product of PI3K and an upstream activator of Akt, localized to macropinocytic cups and that pAkt occurred primarily in cups. These results indicate that CXCL12 activates mTORC1 via 2 mechanisms: 1) that the macropinocytic cup localizes Akt signaling and 2) that MPs convey extracellular nutrients to lysosomes.
There are presently no miracle drugs for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). This study investigates the synergistic effect of Silibinin combined with Pu-erh tea extract (PTE) against NAFLD and explores the suggested mechanism of action. Ob/ob mice were fed a high fat diet along with the oral administration of Silibinin (86 mg per kg per day), PTE (250 mg per kg per day) or their combination for 6 weeks. Their lean littermates who were fed with standard chow diet were used as the control group. The blood biochemical index and histopathological evaluation were analyzed. The expression of genes involved in the lipogenesis pathway and cholesterol metabolism were evaluated. When compared with that of the NAFLD group, the body weight and blood lipid of the mice from the PTE group or combination group were significantly reduced. To some degree, fat metabolism and the inflammatory response were ameliorated by Silibinin and PTE used alone or in combination. It was notable that the combination group had a stronger efficacy in adjusting fat metabolism and inhibiting oxidative stress than that of Silibinin or PTE used alone. Silibinin and PTE inhibited fat synthesis by regulating the mRNA expression of CRTC2, SREBP-1c, and SCD-1. Moreover, the cholesterol homeostasis was improved in the treatment groups via regulating the mRNA expression of ABCA1 and ApoB100. The improvement of the combination group was superior to each drug used alone. In conclusion, Silibinin in combination with PTE can prevent NAFLD with greater potential than Silibinin or PTE used alone and may be a new therapeutic strategy.
Parathyroid hormone (PTH) activates receptors on osteocytes to orchestrate bone formation and resorption. Here we show that PTH inhibition of SOST (sclerostin), a WNT antagonist, requires HDAC4 and HDAC5, whereas PTH stimulation of RANKL, a stimulator of bone resorption, requires CRTC2. Salt inducible kinases (SIKs) control subcellular localization of HDAC4/5 and CRTC2. PTH regulates both HDAC4/5 and CRTC2 localization via phosphorylation and inhibition of SIK2. Like PTH, new small molecule SIK inhibitors cause decreased phosphorylation and increased nuclear translocation of HDAC4/5 and CRTC2. SIK inhibition mimics many of the effects of PTH in osteocytes as assessed by RNA-seq in cultured osteocytes and following in vivo administration. Once daily treatment with the small molecule SIK inhibitor YKL-05-099 increases bone formation and bone mass. Therefore, a major arm of PTH signalling in osteocytes involves SIK inhibition, and small molecule SIK inhibitors may be applied therapeutically to mimic skeletal effects of PTH.
Insulin resistance is one of the defining features of type 2 diabetes and the metabolic syndrome and accompanies many other clinical conditions, ranging from obesity to lipodystrophy to glucocorticoid excess. Extraordinary efforts have gone into defining the mechanisms that underlie insulin resistance, with most attention focused on altered signalling as well as mitochondrial and endoplasmic reticulum stress. Here, nuclear mechanisms of insulin resistance, including transcriptional and epigenomic effects, will be discussed. Three levels of control involving transcription factors, transcriptional cofactors, and chromatin-modifying enzymes will be considered. Well-studied examples of the first include PPAR-γ in adipose tissue and the glucocorticoid receptor and FoxO1 in a variety of insulin-sensitive tissues. These proteins work in concert with cofactors such as PGC-1α and CRTC2, and chromatin-modifying enzymes including DNA methyltransferases and histone acetyltransferases, to regulate key genes that promote insulin-stimulated glucose uptake, gluconeogenesis or other pathways that affect systemic insulin action. Furthermore, genetic variation associated with increased risk of type 2 diabetes is often related to altered transcription factor binding, either by affecting the transcription factor itself, or more commonly by changing the binding affinity of a noncoding regulatory region. Finally, several avenues for therapeutic exploitation in the battle against metabolic disease will be discussed, including small-molecule inhibitors and activators of these factors and their related pathways.
Prolyl isomerases are divided into three groups, the FKBP family, Cyclophilin and the Parvulin family (Pin1 and Par14). Among these isomerases, Pin1 is a unique prolyl isomerase binding to the motif including pSer/pThr-Pro that is phosphorylated by kinases. Once bound, Pin1 modulates the enzymatic activity, protein stability or subcellular localization of target proteins by changing the cis- and trans-formations of proline. Several studies have examined the roles of Pin1 in the pathogenesis of cancers and Alzheimer's disease. On the other hand, recent studies have newly demonstrated Pin1 to be involved in regulating glucose and lipid metabolism. Interestingly, while Pin1 expression is markedly increased by high-fat diet feeding, Pin1 KO mice are resistant to diet-induced obesity, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis and diabetic vascular dysfunction. These phenomena result from the binding of Pin1 to several key factors regulating metabolic functions, which include insulin receptor substrate-1, AMPK, Crtc2 and NF-κB p65. In this review, we focus on recent advances in elucidating the physiological roles of Pin1 as well as the pathogenesis of disorders involving this isomerase, from the viewpoint of the relationships between signal transductions and metabolic functions.
The cholesterol transfer function of steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR) is uniquely integrated into adrenal cells, with mRNA translation and protein kinase A (PKA) phosphorylation occurring at the mitochondrial outer membrane (OMM). The StAR C-terminal cholesterol-binding domain (CBD) initiates mitochondrial intermembrane contacts to rapidly direct cholesterol to Cyp11a1 in the inner membrane (IMM). The conserved StAR N-terminal regulatory domain (NTD) includes a leader sequence targeting the CBD to OMM complexes that initiate cholesterol transfer. Here, we show how the NTD functions to enhance CBD activity delivers more efficiently from StAR mRNA in adrenal cells, and then how two factors hormonally restrain this process. NTD processing at two conserved sequence sites is selectively affected by StAR PKA phosphorylation. The CBD functions as a receptor to stimulate the OMM/IMM contacts that mediate transfer. The NTD controls the transit time that integrates extramitochondrial StAR effects on cholesterol homeostasis with other mitochondrial functions, including ATP generation, inter-organelle fusion, and the major permeability transition pore in partnership with other OMM proteins. PKA also rapidly induces two additional StAR modulators: salt-inducible kinase 1 (SIK1) and Znf36l1/Tis11b. Induced SIK1 attenuates the activity of CRTC2, a key mediator of StAR transcription and splicing, but only as cAMP levels decline. TIS11b inhibits translation and directs the endonuclease-mediated removal of the 3.5-kb StAR mRNA. Removal of either of these functions individually enhances cAMP-mediated induction of StAR. High-resolution fluorescence in situ hybridization (HR-FISH) of StAR RNA reveals asymmetric transcription at the gene locus and slow RNA splicing that delays mRNA formation, potentially to synchronize with cholesterol import. Adrenal cells may retain slow transcription to integrate with intermembrane NTD activation. HR-FISH resolves individual 3.5-kb StAR mRNA molecules via dual hybridization at the 3'- and 5'-ends and reveals an unexpectedly high frequency of 1:1 pairing with mitochondria marked by the matrix StAR protein. This pairing may be central to translation-coupled cholesterol transfer. Altogether, our results show that adrenal cells exhibit high-efficiency StAR activity that needs to integrate rapid cholesterol transfer with homeostasis and pulsatile hormonal stimulation. StAR NBD, the extended 3.5-kb mRNA, SIK1, and Tis11b play important roles.
The mTOR pathways involved in the regulation of SREBP-1.
Although oestrogens are essential for spermatogenesis and their biosynthesis is dependent on aromatase expression, the molecular mechanism of aromatase regulation is poorly understood. Our laboratory has demonstrated that liver kinase B1 (LKB1) is a negative regulator of aromatase in the breast by phosphorylating AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and inhibiting the nuclear translocation of the cAMP response element-binding protein-regulated transcription co-activator (CRTC) 2. The aim of this study was to determine the location of testis-associated proteins in the LKB1-CRTC pathway. Aromatase, LKB1, phosphorylated AMPK (pAMPK) and CRTC1-3 were examined by selected immunofluorescent antibodies in testis samples from a prepubertal boy and three fertile men. Aromatase, pAMPK and LKB1 proteins were present in the seminiferous epithelium and interstitium of the testis and were expressed in a differential and developmental manner in particular cell types. The expression pattern of LKB1 was similar to that of pAMPK and inversely related to aromatase expression. CRTC1 and CRTC3 were localised in the seminiferous epithelium, whereas CRTC2 was barely detectable in testis. These results lead to the conclusion that LKB1 is involved in the molecular pathway that underpins aromatase regulation in the testis via CRTC1 and CRTC3 and may be important for the oestrogen-mediated development of germ cells.
The disease-modifying effects of target of rapamycin complex 1 (TORC1) inhibitors during different stages of polycystic kidney disease (PKD) are not well defined. In this study, male Lewis Polycystic Kidney Disease (LPK) rats (a genetic ortholog of human NPHP9, phenotypically characterised by diffuse distal nephron cystic growth) and Lewis controls received either vehicle (V) or sirolimus (S, 0.2 mg/kg by intraperitoneal injection 5 days per week) during the early (postnatal weeks 3 to 10) or late stages of disease (weeks 10 to 20). In early-stage disease, sirolimus reduced kidney enlargement (by 63%), slowed the rate of increase in total kidney volume (TKV) in serial MRI by 78.2% (LPK+V: 132.3±59.7 vs. LPK+S: 28.8±12.0% per week) but only partly reduced the percentage renal cyst area (by 19%) and did not affect the decline in endogenous creatinine clearance (CrCl) in LPK rats. In late-stage disease, sirolimus reduced kidney enlargement (by 22%) and the rate of increase in TKV by 71.8% (LPK+V: 13.1±6.6 vs. LPK+S: 3.7±3.7% per week) but the percentage renal cyst area was unaltered, and the CrCl only marginally better. Sirolimus reduced renal TORC1 activation but not TORC2, NF-κB DNA binding activity, CCL2 or TNFα expression, and abnormalities in cilia ultrastructure, hypertension and cardiac disease were also not improved. Thus, the relative treatment efficacy of TORC1 inhibition on kidney enlargement was consistent at all disease stages, but the absolute effect was determined by the timing of drug initiation. Furthermore, cystic microarchitecture, renal function and cardiac disease remain abnormal with TORC1 inhibition, indicating that additional approaches to normalise cellular dedifferentiation, inflammation and hypertension are required to completely arrest the progression of PKDs.
Preosteoblasts are precursor cells that are committed to the osteoblast lineage. Differentiation of these cells to mature osteoblasts is regulated by the extracellular factors and environmental cues. Recent studies have implicated mTOR signaling in the regulation of osteoblast differentiation. However, mTOR exists in two distinct protein complexes (mTORC1 and mTORC2), and the specific role of mTORC1 in regulating the progression of preosteoblasts to mature osteoblastis still unclear. In this study, we first deleted Raptor, a unique and essential component of mTORC1, in primary calvarial cells. Deletion of Raptor resulted in loss of mTORC1 but an increase in mTORC2 signaling without overtly affecting autophagy. Under the osteogenic culture condition, Raptor-deficient cells exhibited a decrease in matrix synthesis and mineralization. qPCR analyses revealed that deletion of Raptor reduced the expression of late-stage markers for osteoblast differentiation (Bglap, Ibsp, and Col1a), while slightly increasing early osteoblast markers (Runx2, Sp7, and Alpl). Consistent with the findings in vitro, genetic ablation of Raptor in osterix-expressing cells led to osteopenia in mice. Together, our findings have identified a specific role for mTORC1 in the transition from preosteoblasts to mature osteoblasts.
Neoplastic processes, tumor growth, and tumor cell proliferation and survival are often due to the altered activation of different signaling pathways. The increased activity of PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling has been shown to be an important regulator of tumor growth in several solid tumors and in mantle cell lymphomas. The active form of mTOR kinase (mammalian target of rapamycin) is a key signaling molecule, and it exists in two different complexes, mTORC1 and mTORC2. In the present work, mTOR activity was investigated in different lymphoma types, in parallel with clinical data. We also examined in Hodgkin lymphomas (HL) the role of mTOR activity in survival mechanisms such as antiapoptotic protein expression and alterations in the microenvironment. We determined which lymphoma types display characteristic high mTOR activity in our TMA (tissue microarray) study. We observed that mTOR activity is increased in mitotic lymphoid cells compared to interphasic cells. The number of diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and HL cases was extended in a further set of TMA. We observed significantly higher mTOR activity in the non-centrum germinativum derived subtype of DLBCL than in the centrum germinativum derived subtype, which was a prognostic marker; 63% of mTOR active cases showed Rictor overexpression, indicating mTORC2 activity. High mTOR activity was also established in 92% of HL cases, which was linked to mTORC1. This finding was not a prognostic marker, however, it can be useful in targeted therapy. We observed the overexpression of the antiapoptotic protein BCL-xL and NFκB-p50 in the majority of mTOR active HLs. HLs showed high numbers of regulatory T cells in the microenvironment and high expression of galectin-1 in tumor cells and in the extracellular matrix, when compared to reactive lymph nodes. We confirmed that mTOR inhibition had significant antiproliferative and antiapoptotic effects in lymphoma cell lines and in lymphoma xenografts (HL, DLBCL, Burkitt lymphoma). We also showed that rapamycin was able to augment the effect of chemotherapeutic agents and TGF-β. Taken together, mTOR activity may be a potential therapeutic target in different lymphoma types. However, patient and inhibitor selection criteria must be carefully considered. The combination of mTOR inhibitors with other agents will probably offer the highest efficiency for achieving the best clinical response, and may also allow dose reduction in order to decrease late treatment toxicity in these cases.
A neopláziás folyamatok kialakulása, a daganat növekedése, a daganatsejtek proliferációja és túlélése hátterében gyakran különbözõ jelutak magváltozott aktivitása áll. A PI3K/AKT/mTOR jelút fokozott aktivitása szolid daganatokban és köpenysejtes lymphomákban a daganatkialakulás és -növekedés fontos szabályozója. Az aktív mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) kináz két komplex (mTORC1, mTORC2) meghatározó eleme. Az mTOR-aktivitás szerepét vizsgáltuk különbözõ humán lymphomákban, összefüggéseket keresve a betegek klinikai adataival. Hodgkin-lymphomákban (HL) tanulmányoztuk, hogy a magas mTOR-aktivitás milyen, a daganat túlélésében fontos folyamatokban vesz részt (antiapoptotikus mechanizmusok és mikrokörnyezeti változások). Meghatároztuk azokat a humán lymphomatípusokat, amelyekre magas mTOR-aktivitás jellemzõ. Kimutattuk, hogy a mitotikus lymphoid sejtek mTOR-aktivitása magasabb, mint a nem osztódó sejteké. Nagyobb esetszámot tartalmazó TMA-blokkokon (tissue microarray) tovább vizsgáltuk a diffúz nagy B-sejtes lymphoma (DLBCL) és a HL eseteket. Szignifikáns összefüggést mutattunk ki DLBCL-s betegek altípusmegoszlása (csíraközpont-eredetû és nem csíraközpont-eredetû DLBCL-ek) és az mTOR-aktivitás között. DLBCL-ban a fokozott mTOR-aktivitás negatív prognosztikus markernek bizonyult. A HL-ek 92%-a magas mTOR-aktivitást mutatott (mTORC1-hez köthetõ), ami prognosztikus faktorként nem, viszont terápiás célpontként felhasználható. A HL-ek mikrokörnyezetének vizsgálata szerint a regulátor T-sejtek mennyisége a mikrokörnyezetben, valamint a galektin-1-expresszió a tumorsejtekben és az extracelluláris mátrixban emelkedett. A magas mTOR-aktivitás és a galektin-1-expresszió között kapcsolatot találtunk in vitro kísérleteinkben, ahol az mTOR gátlása transzlációs szinten csökkentette a galektin-1-expressziót. Az mTOR-gátlás jelentõségét – proliferációgátló és apoptotikus hatását – humán lymphoma xenograftokban (HL, DLBCL, Burkitt-lymphoma) bizonyítottuk. In vitro kombinációs kezelésekben a rapamycin apoptotikus hatást fokozó szerepét igazoltuk. Munkánkban meghatároztuk azokat a lymphomatípusokat, amelyekben az mTOR-gátlás célzott terápiaként alkalmazható lehet. Eredményeink alapján annak meghatározása, hogy melyik komplexhez köthetõ az mTOR-aktivitás, nagyon fontos a megfelelõ mTOR-gátló (klasszikus vagy kettõs gátlók) kiválasztásában. A jövõben a magas mTOR-aktivitást mutató lymphomákban várhatóan kombinációs kezelésben az mTOR-gátlók használata hozzájárulhatna a jobb túlélési eredmények eléréséhez és lehetõség szerint a jelenlegi kezelések dózisainak és toxikus mellékhatásainak csökkentéséhez.
In this study, we used a systems biology approach to investigate changes in the proteome and metabolome of shrimp hemocytes infected by the invertebrate virus WSSV (white spot syndrome virus) at the viral genome replication stage (12 hpi) and the late stage (24 hpi). At 12 hpi, but not at 24 hpi, there was significant up-regulation of the markers of several metabolic pathways associated with the vertebrate Warburg effect (or aerobic glycolysis), including glycolysis, the pentose phosphate pathway, nucleotide biosynthesis, glutaminolysis and amino acid biosynthesis. We show that the PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway was of central importance in triggering this WSSV-induced Warburg effect. Although dsRNA silencing of the mTORC1 activator Rheb had only a relatively minor impact on WSSV replication, in vivo chemical inhibition of Akt, mTORC1 and mTORC2 suppressed the WSSV-induced Warburg effect and reduced both WSSV gene expression and viral genome replication. When the Warburg effect was suppressed by pretreatment with the mTOR inhibitor Torin 1, even the subsequent up-regulation of the TCA cycle was insufficient to satisfy the virus's requirements for energy and macromolecular precursors. The WSSV-induced Warburg effect therefore appears to be essential for successful viral replication.
A major goal of biomedical research is the identification of molecular and cellular mechanisms that underlie memory storage. Here we report a previously unknown signaling pathway that is necessary for the conversion from short- to long-term memory. The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) complex 2 (mTORC2), which contains the regulatory protein Rictor (rapamycin-insensitive companion of mTOR), was discovered only recently and little is known about its function. We found that conditional deletion of Rictor in the postnatal murine forebrain greatly reduced mTORC2 activity and selectively impaired both long-term memory (LTM) and the late phase of hippocampal long-term potentiation (L-LTP). We also found a comparable impairment of LTM in dTORC2-deficient flies, highlighting the evolutionary conservation of this pathway. Actin polymerization was reduced in the hippocampus of mTORC2-deficient mice and its restoration rescued both L-LTP and LTM. Moreover, a compound that promoted mTORC2 activity converted early LTP into late LTP and enhanced LTM. Thus, mTORC2 could be a therapeutic target for the treatment of cognitive dysfunction.
In many renal diseases, transforming growth factor β (TGFβ)-stimulated canonical Smad 3 and noncanonical mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) promote increased protein synthesis and mesangial cell hypertrophy. The cellular underpinnings involving these signaling molecules to regulate mesangial cell hypertrophy are not fully understood. Deptor has recently been identified as an mTOR interacting protein and functions as an endogenous inhibitor of the kinase activity for both TORC1 and TORC2. Prolonged incubation of mesangial cells with TGFβ reduced the levels of deptor concomitant with an increase in TORC1 and TORC2 activity. Sustained TGFβ activation was required to inhibit association of deptor with mTOR, whereas rapid activation had no effect. Using the mTOR inhibitor PP242, we found that TGFβ-induced both early and sustained activation of TORC1 and TORC2 was necessary for deptor suppression. PP242-induced reversal of deptor suppression by TGFβ was associated with a significant inhibition of TGFβ-stimulated protein synthesis and hypertrophy. Interestingly, expression of siRNA against Smad 3 or Smad 7, which blocks TGFβ receptor-specific Smad 3 signaling, prevented TGFβ-induced suppression of deptor abundance and TORC1/2 activities. Furthermore, overexpression of Smad 3 decreased deptor expression similar to TGFβ stimulation concomitant with increased TORC1 and TORC2 activities. Finally, knockdown of deptor reversed Smad 7-mediated inhibition of protein synthesis and mesangial cell hypertrophy induced by TGFβ. These data reveal the requirement of both early and late activation of mTOR for TGFβ-induced protein synthesis. Our results support that TGFβ-stimulated Smad 3 acts as a key node to instill a feedback loop between deptor down-regulation and TORC1/2 activation in driving mesangial cell hypertrophy.
In mammalian testes, haploid spermatozoa are formed from diploid spermatogonia during spermatogenesis, which is a complicated cellular process. While these cellular events were reported in the 1960s and 1970s, the underlying molecular mechanism(s) that regulates these events remained unexplored until the past ∼10 years. For instance, adhesion proteins were shown to be integrated components at the Sertoli cell-cell interface and/or the Sertoli-spermatid interface in the late 1980s. But only until recently, studies have demonstrated that some of the adhesion proteins serve as the platform for signal transduction that regulates cell adhesion. In this chapter, a brief summary and critical discussion are provided on the latest findings regarding these cell-adhesion proteins in the testis and their relationship to spermatogenesis. Moreover, antagonistic effects of two mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) complexes, known as mTORC1 and mTORC2, on cell-adhesion function in the testis are discussed. Finally, a hypothetic model is presented to depict how these two mTOR-signaling complexes having the "yin" and "yang" antagonistic effects on the Sertoli cell tight junction (TJ)-permeability barrier can maintain the blood-testis barrier (BTB) integrity during the epithelial cycle while preleptotene spermatocytes are crossing the BTB.
We have recently demonstrated that Aurora-A kinase is a potential oncogene to develop mammary gland tumors in mice, when expressed under MMTV promoter. These tumors contain phosphorylated forms of Akt and mTOR, suggesting that Akt-mTOR pathway is involved in transformed phenotype induced by Aurora-A. In the present studies, we discovered that stable cell lines expressing Aurora-A contain phosphorylation of Akt Ser473 after prolonged passages of cell culture, not in cells of the early period of cell culture. Levels of PTEN tumor suppressor are significantly reduced in these late passage cells at least in part due to increased poly ubiquitination of the protein. Akt-activated Aurora-A cells formed larger colonies in soft agar and are resistant to UV-induced apoptosis. Aurora-A inhibitor, VX-680, can cause cell death of Aurora-A cells in which Akt is not activated. siRNA-mediated depletion of mTOR in those cells resulted in decreased phosphorylation of Akt Ser473, suggesting that TORC2 complex phosphorylates Akt in Aurora-A cells. Treatment of late-passage Aurora-A cells with mTOR inhibitor reduced colony formation in soft agar. These results strongly suggest that commitment of cell transformation by Aurora-A is determined by at least co-activation of Akt/mTOR pathway.
We evaluated the stages of VEGF-A(164) driven angiogenesis that are inhibited by therapeutic doses of rapamycin and the potential role of S6K1 in that response.
We assessed the effects of rapamycin on the several stages of angiogensis and lymphangiogenesis induced with an adenovirus expressing VEGF-A(164) (Ad-VEGF-A(164)) in the ears of adult nude mice. Rapamycin (0.5 mg/kg/d) effectively inhibited mTOR and downstream S6K1 signaling and partially inhibited Akt signaling, likely through effects on TORC2. The earliest stages of angiogenesis, including mother vessel formation and increased vascular permeability, were strikingly inhibited by rapamycin, as was subsequent formation of daughter glomeruloid microvasular proliferations. However, later stage formation of vascular malformations and lymphangiogenesis were unaffected. Retrovirally delivered isoforms and shRNAs demonstrated that S6K1 signaling plays an important role in early VEGF-A(164)-angiogenesis.
Rapamycin potently inhibited early and mid stages of VEGF-A(164)-driven angiogenesis, but not late-stage angiogenesis or lymphangiogenesis. Rapamycin decreased phosphorylation of both Akt and S6, suggesting that both the TORC1 and TORC2 pathways are impacted. Inhibition of S6K1 signaling downstream of mTOR is a major component of the antiangiogenesis action of rapamycin.
All vertebrate animals have developed a sophisticated regulatory system to cope with frequent and unpredictable episodes of fasting. A recent letter to Nature suggests that a switch from early gluconeogenic gene activation via CRTC2 (also known as TORC2) to late action of FOXO1 is critical to this process.
Irisin, an adipomiokine known as a mediator of physical activity, induces the browning of adipose tissue and it has potentially protective properties in the development of obesity-related states, such as insulin resistance, arteriosclerosis, and type 2 diabetes. Despite numerous studies conducted on this factor, still little is known about its impact on the functioning of immunocompetent cells, but its potential anti-inflammatory properties were previously suggested. In the current study we investigated the role of irisin (0-100 nM) in the downstream pathway activation of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) in RAW 264.7 macrophages stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS; 100 ng/mL). The results have shown that irisin in high concentrations (50, 100 nM) significantly decreased the TLR4 and MyD88 protein levels, as well as the phosphorylation of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), consequently leading to the reduction in the release of crucial pro-inflammatory cytokines. The above was confirmed for interleukin 1β (IL-1β), tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα), interleukin 6 (IL-6), keratinocyte chemoattractant (KC), monocyte chemotactic protein 1 (MCP-1), as well as for high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1). Moreover, our results indicate that this effect is connected with irisin's impact on the phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), where a significant reduction in p-JNK and p-ERK but not p-p38 was observed. In conclusion, these data suggest that irisin has potentially anti-inflammatory properties connected with the downregulation of downstream pathways of TLR4/MyD88.
The aim of this study was to summarize the interactions between hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection and iron overload, and to understand the mechanisms of iron overload in chronic hepatitis C (CHC) and the role iron plays in HCV life cycle.
This review was based on data in articles published in the PubMed databases up to January 28, 2017, with the keywords "hepatitis C virus", "iron overload", "iron metabolism", "hepcidin", "translation", and "replication".
Articles related to iron metabolism, iron overload in patients with CHC, or the effects of iron on HCV life cycle were selected for the review.
Iron overload is common in patients with CHC. The mechanisms involve decreased hepcidin levels caused by HCV through signal transducer and activator of transcription 3, mitogen-activated protein kinase, or bone morphogenetic protein/SMAD signaling pathways, and the altered expression of other iron-metabolism-related genes. Some studies found that iron increases HCV replication, while other studies found the opposite result. Most of the studies suggest the positive role of iron on HCV translation, the mechanisms of which involve increased expression levels of factors associated with HCV internal ribosome entry site-dependent translation, such as eukaryotic initiation factor 3 and La protein.
The growing literature demonstrates that CHC leads to iron overload, and iron affects the HCV life cycle in turn. Further research should be conducted to clarify the mechanism involved in the complicated interaction between iron and HCV.
Fibroblast growth factor 8b and androgen play important roles in cell proliferation of prostate cancer. We investigated the effects of fibroblast growth factor 8b and androgen on the proliferation of prostate cell lines and the corresponding intracellular mechanisms. It is found that dihydrotestosterone and fibroblast growth factor 8b stimulated Lncap cell mitosis in a concentration-responsive manner, with 30 ng/mL as the most suitable concentration, respectively. Dihydrotestosterone treatment alone did not enhance the expression and phosphorylation level of fibroblast growth factor receptor but significantly enhanced the level of fibroblast growth factor receptor phosphorylation elicited by fibroblast growth factor 8b. Phosphorylations of extracellular signal-regulated kinase, p38, and c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase were stimulated by dihydrotestosterone or fibroblast growth factor 8b. Among these major downstream pathways for mitogen-activated protein kinase, c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase signaling was most significantly enhanced. Protein kinase C phosphorylation was higher than AKT by the combined stimulation of dihydrotestosterone and fibroblast growth factor 8b. The phosphorylation of CDC2 was significantly induced by dihydrotestosterone and fibroblast growth factor 8b synergetically, and Smad underwent the same induction as CDC2. So the promoting effect of fibroblast growth factor 8b on cell cycle might contribute to the G2/M transition. This study indicated that the functional interaction between fibroblast growth factor 8b and androgen was essential for the prostate cancer cell proliferation.
The BRAF K601E mutation occurs in 5% of patients with melanoma, and is the third most common type of BRAF mutation. However, treatment with BRAF and mitogen-activated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (MEK) inhibitors is only approved in patients with BRAF V600-positive melanoma, and patients with K601E-mutated melanoma do not have access to such drugs.
A female patient was diagnosed with high tumor burden metastatic melanoma harboring the BRAF K601E mutation. After chemotherapy failure, she underwent compassionate treatment with trametinib. Trametinib showed good activity and efficacy, with 48% shrinkage of a metastatic lymphadenopathy after 4 months' treatment. However, the patient reported treatment-related skin toxicity that required dosage reduction and a personalized intermittent trametinib dosing schedule. After over 36 months from the first trametinib administration, and resection of a metastatic lymphadenopathy, the patient experienced complete response.
This case report shows that trametinib could be a valid therapeutic option in patients with metastatic melanoma harboring the rare BRAF K601E mutation.
Thrombocytes express Toll-like receptor 4 and apparently use both mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NFKB) pathways for nuclear signaling. However, it is not well known if the same enzyme systems found in mammalian cells are fully functional in chickens. Therefore, kinase inhibitors were used with thrombocytes to block kinases in lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulated cells to determine if interleukin (IL)-6 expression and production would be diminished. Results demonstrated that extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1/2 and p38 MAPK pathways influence gene expression of IL-6 through treatment with either ERK or p38 MAPK inhibitor. In addition, thrombocyte lysates from cells treated with ERK, p38, mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK)1/2 and inhibitor of nuclear factor kappa-B kinase (IKK) inhibitor showed different levels of the phosphorylated form of ERK1/2, p38 and NFκB. Furthermore, IL-6 gene expression and production were significantly upregulated in LPS stimulated thrombocytes relative to all inhibitor-treated cells.
Aquaporin-3 (AQP3), a transporter of water, glycerol and H2O2, is expressed in basolateral membranes of principal cells in kidney collecting duct. Here, we report that AQP3 deletion in mice affects renal function and modulates renal injury. We found collecting duct hyperplasia and cell swelling in kidneys of adult AQP3 null mice. After mild renal ischemia-reperfusion (IR), AQP3 null mice had significantly greater blood urea nitrogen (57mg/dl) and creatinine (136μM) than wild-type mice (35mg/dl and 48μM, respectively), and showed renal morphological changes, including tubular dilatation, erythrocyte diapedesis and collecting duct incompletion. MPO, MDA and SOD following IR in AQP3 null mice were much higher than that in wild-type mice (1.7U/g vs 0.8U/g, 3.9μM/g vs 2.4μM/g, 6.4U/mg vs 11U/mg, respectively). Following IR, AQP3 deletion inhibited activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling and produced an increase in the ratios of Bax/Bcl-2, cleaved caspase-3/caspase-3 and p-p53/p53. Studies in transfected MDCK cells showed that AQP3 expression attenuated reduced cell viability following hypoxia-reoxygenation, with reduce apoptosis and increased MAPK signaling. Our results support a novel role for AQP3 in modulating renal injury and suggest the mechanisms involved in protection against hypoxic injury.
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a multifactorial autoimmune disease, characterized by inflammation of synovial joints. Carnosic acid (CA) is a phenolic diterpene isolated from Rosmarinus officinails, playing a central role in cytoprotective responses to oxidative stress and inflammation response. Our study aimed to investigate the effects of CA on RA progression in diabetic animals. Carnosic acid (CA) was used to treat collagen-induced arthritis (CIA)-induced db/db mice. Blood glucose, oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) and insulin tolerance test (ITT) were investigated to explore insulin resistance. CA significantly down-regulated fasting blood glucose, glucose level in OGTT and ITT, ameliorated CIA-induced bone loss, and reduced pro-inflammatory cytokines and reactive oxygen species (ROS) in db/db mice with arthritis induced by CIA. In vitro, CA suppressed Receptor Activator for Nuclear Factor-κ B Ligand (RANKL)- and Macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF)-induced osteoclastogenesis. The osteoclastic specific markers were inhibited by CA. Signal transduction studies showed that CA significantly decreased the expression of molecules contributing to ROS and increased anti-oxidants. Additionally, CA inactivated the RANKL- and M-CSF-induced p38 mitogen activated protein kinases (MAPK), inhibited NF-κB phosphorylation, causing pro-inflammatory cytokines down-regulation. Together, CA ameliorated osteoclast formation and CIA-induced bone loss in db/db mice through inflammation suppression by regulating ROS-dependent p38 pathway.
A poor papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) prognosis is strongly associated with the BRAF V600E mutation. During tumor progression, levels of the high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) protein are often dysregulated. Results herein demonstrate that HMGB1 protein levels differ between tumor and adjacent non-tumor tissue and that HMGB1 mRNA levels were higher in wild-type BRAF PTC tissues than in BRAF V600E PTC tissues (2-△Ct 0.31 ± 0.25 vs. 0.16 ± 0.12; P &lt; 0.05). HMGB1 protein levels also differed in the same manner (wild-type BRAF PTC tissues 0.11 ± 0.04 vs. BRAF V600E PTC tissues 0.03 ± 0.03; P &lt; 0.001). Although not detected in peripheral blood, low levels of HMGB1 were significantly related to PTC cell lymph node metastasis and extra-glandular infiltration (P = 0.045 and P = 0.002). Experimental results at the cellular level were consistent with tissues and further verified the relationship of BRAF V600E and HMGB1. These findings demonstrate that the BRAF V600E mutation down-regulates levels of HMGB1, likely through activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways.
So far, few data are available on the reproductive toxicological assessment of β-diketone antibiotics (DKAs), a class of ubiquitous pseudo-persistent pollutant, in zebrafish (Danio rerio). Herein, we reported the reproductive effects of DKAs by means of transcriptome analysis (F1-zebrafish), changes in a series of reproductive indices (F0-zebrafish) and histopathological observations. A total of 1170, 983 and 1399 genes were found to be differentially expressed when compared control vs. 6.25mg/L, control vs. 12.5mg/L and 6.25 vs. 12.5mg/L DKA-exposure treatments, respectively. Among three comparison groups, 670, 569 and 821 genes were respectively assigned for GO analyses based on matches with sequences of known functions. In 149 KEGG-noted metabolic pathways, the preferential one was the MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) signaling pathway, followed by oxidative phosphorylation, neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction and so on. By qPCR verification, 6 genes (c6ast4, igfbp1b, mrpl42, tnnc2, emc4 and ddit4) showed consistent gene expression with those identified by transcriptome sequencing. Due to DKA-exposure, the concentrations of plasma estradiol and testosterone, and the gonado-somatic index were significantly dose-dependently declined. Also, DKA-exposure led to declining in zebrafish reproductive capacity, reflecting in fertilization, hatchability and egg production. Histopathological observations demonstrated that zebrafish ovary and testis suffered serious damage after DKA-exposure. The 4-oxo-TEMP signals increased obviously with increasing DKA-exposed concentrations, implying disruption of balance between generation and clearance of (1)O2. In summary, DKAs not only produce reproductive toxicological effects on F0-zebrafish, but also result in adverse consequences for growth and development of F1-zebrafish.
Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is characterized by the progressive development of kidney and liver cysts. The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) cascade is one of the important pathways regulating cyst growth in ADPKD. Branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs), including leucine, play a crucial role to activate mTOR pathway. Therefore, we administered BCAA dissolved in the drinking water to Pkd1(flox/flox):Mx1-Cre (cystic) mice from four to 22 weeks of age after polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid-induced conditional Pkd1 knockout at two weeks of age. The BCAA group showed significantly greater kidney/body weight ratio and higher cystic index in both the kidney and liver compared to the placebo-treated mice. We found that the L-type amino acid transporter 1 that facilitates BCAA entry into cells is strongly expressed in cells lining the cysts. We also found increased cyst-lining cell proliferation and upregulation of mTOR and mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (MAPK/ERK) pathways in the BCAA group. In vitro, we cultured renal epithelial cell lines from Pkd1 null mice with or without leucine. Leucine was found to stimulate cell proliferation, as well as activate mTOR and MAPK/ERK pathways in these cells. Thus, BCAA accelerated disease progression by mTOR and MAPK/ERK pathways. Hence, BCAA may be harmful to patients with ADPKD.
Glioma, one of the most common cancers in human, is classified to different grades according to the degrees of malignancy. Glioblastoma (GBM) is known to be the most malignant (Grade IV) whereas low-grade astrocytoma (LGA, Grade II) is relatively benign. The mechanism underlying the pathogenesis and progression of glioma malignancy remains unclear. Here we report a quantitative proteomic study to elucidate the differences between GBM and LGA using liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry followed by label-free quantification. A total of 136 proteins were differentially expressed in GBM for at least five folds in comparison with LGA. Ontological analysis revealed a close correlation between GBM-associated proteins and RNA processing. Interaction network analysis indicated that the GBM-associated proteins in the RNA processing were linked to crucial signaling transduction modulators including epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1), and mitogen-activated protein kinase 1 (MAPK1), which were further connected to the proteins important for neuronal structural integrity, development and functions. Upregulation of 40S ribosomal protein S5 (RPS5), Ferritin Heavy chain (FTH1) and STAT1, and downregulation of tenascin R (TNR) were validated as representatives by immune assays. In summary, we revealed a panel of GBM-associated proteins and the important modulators centered at the RNA-processing network in glioma malignancy that may become novel biomarkers and help elucidate the underlying mechanism.
The modulation of immature dendritic cells (iDCs), which involves processes such as phagocytosis, migration, and maturation, is considered a beneficial research theme. Once activated by an antigen, iDCs turn to mature DCs (mDCs) and migrate towards secondary lymphoid organs, and initiate the progress of cellular immunity. Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACis) are also thought to be a major modulator of cellular immunity. Herein, we demonstrate that HDACis (trichostatin-A (TSA), sodium butylate (SB), scriptaid (ST)) play a central regulatory role in the migratory activity of iDCs. In our results, TSA, SB and ST showed the potent inhibitory effect on the migration of iDCs stimulated by MIP-1α. The inhibitory activities of HDACis were found to be caused by reduction of CCR1 expression on the cell surface, and by the inhibition of phosphorylation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK 1/2), and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK).
Sperm motility is an important standard to measure the fertility of male. In our previous study, we found that the diploid spermatozoa from allotetraploid hybrid (4nAT) had longer durations of rapid and slow progressive motility than haploid spermatozoa from common carp (COC). In this study, to explore sperm motility-related molecular mechanisms, we compared the testis tissues transcriptomes from two years old male COC and 4nAT. The RNA-seq data revealed that 2985 genes were differentially expressed between COC and 4nAT, including 2216 up-regulated and 769 down-regulated genes in 4nAT. Some differentially expressed genes, such as tubulin genes, dynein, axonemal, heavy chain genes, mitogen-activated protein kinase genes, tektin 4, FOX transcription factors, proteasome genes and ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolase genes, are involved in the regulation of cell division, flagellar and ciliary motility, gene transcription, cytoskeleton, energy metabolism and the ubiquitin-proteasome system, suggesting that these genes were related to sperm motility of the 4nAT. We confirmed the differential expression of 12 such genes in 4nAT by quantitative PCR. By western blotting, we also confirmed increased expression of Uchl3 in 4nAT testis. In addition, we identified 1915 and 2551 predicted long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) transcripts from testis tissue transcriptomes of COC and 4nAT, respectively. Of these, 1575 lncRNAs were specifically expressed in 4nAT and 939 were specifically expressed in COC. The present study provides insights into the transcriptome profile of testis tissues from diploid and tetraploid, which are useful for research on regulatory mechanisms behind sperm motility in male polyploidy.
Activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway is important for growth of pediatric low-grade gliomas (LGGs). The aim of this study was to determine the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) and the dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) of the MEK inhibitor selumetinib in children with progressive LGG.
Selumetinib was administered orally starting at 33 mg/m2/dose b.i.d., using the modified continual reassessment method. Pharmacokinetic analysis was performed during the first course. BRAF aberrations in tumor tissue were determined by real-time polymerase chain reaction and fluorescence in situ hybridization.
Thirty-eight eligible subjects were enrolled. Dose levels 1 and 2 (33 and 43 mg/m2/dose b.i.d.) were excessively toxic. DLTs included grade 3 elevated amylase/lipase (n = 1), headache (n = 1), mucositis (n = 2), and grades 2-3 rash (n = 6). At dose level 0 (25 mg/m2/dose b.i.d, the RP2D), only 3 of 24 subjects experienced DLTs (elevated amylase/lipase, rash, and mucositis). At the R2PD, the median (range) area under the curve (AUC0-∞) and apparent oral clearance of selumetinib were 3855 ng*h/mL (1780 to 7250 ng × h/mL) and 6.5 L × h-1 × m-2 (3.4 to 14.0 L × h-1 × m-2), respectively. Thirteen of 19 tumors had BRAF abnormalities. Among the 5 (20%) of 25 subjects with sustained partial responses, all at the RP2D, 4 had BRAF aberrations, 1 had insufficient tissue. Subjects received a median of 13 cycles (range: 1-26). Fourteen (37%) completed all protocol treatment (26 cycles [n = 13], 13 cycles [n = 1]) with at least stable disease; 2-year progression-free survival at the RP2D was 69 ± SE 9.8%.
Selumetinib has promising antitumor activity in children with LGG. Rash and mucositis were the most common DLTs.
Vascular remodeling during chronic hypertension may impair the supply of tissues with oxygen, glucose and other compounds, potentially unleashing deleterious effects. In this study, we used Spontaneously Hypertensive Rats and normotensive Wistar-Kyoto rats with or without pharmacological inhibition of poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase-1 by an experimental compound L-2286, to evaluate carotid artery remodeling and consequent damage of neuronal tissue during hypertension. We observed elevated oxidative stress and profound thickening of the vascular wall with fibrotic tissue accumulation induced by elevated blood pressure. 32 weeks of L-2286 treatment attenuated these processes by modulating mitogen activated protein kinase phosphatase-1 cellular levels in carotid arteries. In hypertensive animals, vascular inflammation and endothelial dysfunction was observed by NF-κB nuclear accumulation and impaired vasodilation to acetylcholine, respectively. Pharmacological poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase-1 inhibition interfered in these processes and mitigated Apoptosis Inducing Factor dependent cell death events, thus improved structural and functional alterations of carotid arteries, without affecting blood pressure. Chronic poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase-1 inhibition protected neuronal tissue against oxidative damage, assessed by nitrotyrosine, 4-hydroxinonenal and 8-oxoguanosine immunohistochemistry in the area of Cornu ammonis 1 of the dorsal hippocampus in hypertensive rats. In this area, extensive pyramidal cell loss was also attenuated by treatment with lowered poly(ADP-ribose)polymer formation. It also preserved the structure of fissural arteries and attenuated perivascular white matter lesions and reactive astrogliosis in hypertensive rats. These data support the premise in which chronic poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase-1 inhibition has beneficial effects on hypertension related tissue damage both in vascular tissue and in the hippocampus by altering signaling events, reducing oxidative/nitrosative stress and inflammatory status, without lowering blood pressure.
The control and treatment of rheumatoid arthritis is a challenge in today's world. Therefore, the pursuit of natural disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMRDs) remains a top priority in rheumatology. The present study focused on curcumin and its derivatives in the search for new DMRDs. We focused on prominent p38 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase p38α which is a prime regulator of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), a key mediator of rheumatoid arthritis. In the present study, we used the X-ray crystallographic structure of p38α for molecular docking simulations and molecular dynamic simulations to study the binding modes of curcumin and its derivatives with the active site of p38α. The ATP-binding domain was used for evaluating curcumin and its derivatives. Molecular docking simulation results were used to select 4 out of 8 compounds. These 4 compounds were simulated using GROMACS molecular simulation platform; the results generated were subjected to molecular mechanics-Poisson Boltzmann surface area (MM-PBSA) calculations. The results showed cyclocurcumin as a potential natural compound for development of a potent DMRD. These data were further supported by inhibition of TNF-α release from lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated human macrophages following cyclocurcumin treatment.
Accumulating evidence indicates that Clara cell protein-16 (CC16) has anti-inflammatory functions, although the involved molecular pathways have not been completely elucidated. Here, we evaluated the effect of recombinant rat CC16 (rCC16) on the expression of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and IL-8 in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated mouse macrophages (RAW264.7 cells) and explored the underlying molecular mechanisms. It was found that rCC16 inhibited LPS-induced TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-8 expression at both the messenger ribonucleicacid (mRNA) level and protein level in a concentration-dependent manner, as demonstrated by real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Such suppressive effects were accompanied by the inhibition of transcriptional activity and the deoxyribonucleic acid binding activity of nuclear factor (NF)-κB but not activator protein (AP)-1. Western blot analysis further revealed that rCC16 inhibited the increase of nuclear NF-κB and the reduction of cytosolic NF-κB, the phosphorylation and reduction of NF-κB inhibitory protein IκBα, and the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)-dependent NF-κB activation by phosphorylation at Ser276 of its p65 subunit. Furthermore, rCC16 was found to have no effect on the phosphorylation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase, c-Jun, or the nuclear translocation of c-Jun. In addition, reduction of TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-8 were reversed when the level of endogenous uteroglobin-binding protein was reduced by RNA interference in rCC16- and LPS-treated RAW264.7 cells. Our data suggest that rCC16 suppresses LPS-mediated inflammatory mediator TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-8 production by inactivating NF-κB and p38 MAPK but not AP-1 in RAW264.7 cells.
Histone H2B monoubiquitination (H2Bub1) is recognized as a regulatory mechanism that controls a range of cellular processes. We previously showed that H2Bub1 was involved in responses to biotic stress in Arabidopsis. However, the molecular regulatory mechanisms of H2Bub1 in controlling responses to abiotic stress remain limited. Here, we report that HISTONE MONOUBIQUITINATION1 (HUB1) and HUB2 played important regulatory roles in response to salt stress. Phenotypic analysis revealed that H2Bub1 mutants confer decreased tolerance to salt stress. Further analysis showed that H2Bub1 regulated the depolymerization of microtubules (MTs), the expression of PROTEIN TYROSINE PHOSPHATASE1 (PTP1) and MAP KINASE PHOSPHATASE (MKP) genes - DsPTP1, MKP1, IBR5, PHS1, and was required for the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase3 (MAP kinase3, MPK3) and MPK6 in response to salt stress. Moreover, both tyrosine phosphorylation and the activation of MPK3 and MPK6 affected MT stability in salt stress response. Thus, the results indicate that H2Bub1 regulates salt stress-induced MT depolymerization, and the PTP-MPK3/6 signalling module is responsible for integrating signalling pathways that regulate MT stability, which is critical for plant salt stress tolerance.
Evodiamine (EVO), an important alkaloidal component extracted from the fruit of Evodiae fructus, has been known to possess anti-tumor, anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidative, and other therapeutic capabilities. In the present study, the effects of EVO on zymosan-induced inflammation and its underlying mechanism were investigated both in vitro and in vivo. Our results showed that EVO effectively suppressed both protein and mRNA expression of interleukin-1β, interleukin-6 (IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) in vitro. Zymosan-induced DNA-binding activity of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) was attenuated by EVO, which was achieved through inhibitory effects on the phosphorylation of inhibitory κB α and p65 nuclear translocation, but there was very little association with mitogen-activated protein kinase activation. In vivo, treatment with EVO markedly decreased TNF-α and IL-6 levels in plasma. EVO also repressed inflammatory cytokine expression and ameliorated the abnormal state in both lung and intestine tissues by inactivation of NF-κB. Furthermore, EVO significantly reduced the mortality caused by zymosan. In summary, these results suggested that EVO could effectively suppress inflammatory responses in vitro and in vivo, and may be a potential therapeutic agent against inflammatory disorders.
RECQL4 helicase is a molecular motor that unwinds DNA, a process essential during DNA replication and DNA repair. Germ-line mutations in RECQL4 cause type II Rothmund-Thomson syndrome (RTS), characterized by a premature ageing phenotype and cancer predisposition. RECQL4 is widely considered to be a tumour suppressor, although its role in human breast cancer is largely unknown. As the RECQL4 gene is localized to chromosome 8q24, a site frequently amplified in sporadic breast cancers, we hypothesized that it may play an oncogenic role in breast tumourigenesis. To address this, we analysed large cohorts for gene copy number changes (n = 1977), mRNA expression (n = 1977) and protein level (n = 1902). Breast cancer incidence was also explored in 58 patients with type II RTS. DNA replication dynamics and chemosensitivity was evaluated in RECQL4-depleted breast cancer cells in vitro. Amplification or gain in gene copy number (30.6%), high-level mRNA expression (51%) and high levels of protein (23%) significantly associated with aggressive tumour behaviour, including lymph node positivity, larger tumour size, HER2 overexpression, ER-negativity, triple-negative phenotypes and poor survival. RECQL4 depletion impaired the DNA replication rate and increased chemosensitivity in cultured breast cancer cells. Thus, although recognized as a 'safe guardian of the genome', our data provide compelling evidence that RECQL4 is tumour promoting in established breast cancers.

RECQL4 mutations are associated with Rothmund Thomson Syndrome (RTS), RAPADILINO Syndrome and Baller-Gerold Syndrome. These patients display a range of benign skeletal abnormalities such as low bone mass. In addition, RTS patients have a highly increased incidence of osteosarcoma (OS). The role of RECQL4 in normal adult bone development and homeostasis is largely uncharacterized and how mutation of RECQL4 contributes to OS susceptibility is not known. We hypothesised that Recql4 was required for normal skeletal development and both benign and malignant osteoblast function, which we have tested in the mouse. Recql4 deletion in vivo at the osteoblastic progenitor stage of differentiation resulted in mice with shorter bones and reduced bone volume, assessed at 9 weeks of age. This was associated with an osteoblast intrinsic decrease in mineral apposition rate and bone formation rate in the Recql4-deficient cohorts. Deletion of Recql4 in mature osteoblasts/osteocytes in vivo, however, did not cause a detectable phenotype. Acute deletion of Recql4 in primary osteoblasts or shRNA knockdown in an osteoblastic cell line caused failed proliferation, accompanied by cell cycle arrest, induction of apoptosis and impaired differentiation. When cohorts of animals were aged long term, the loss of Recql4 alone was not sufficient to initiate OS. We then crossed the Recql4fl/fl allele to a fully penetrant OS model (Osx-Cre p53fl/fl). Unexpectedly, the Osx-Cre p53fl/flRecql4fl/fl (dKO) animals had a significantly increased OS-free survival compared to Osx-Cre p53fl/fl or Osx-Cre p53fl/flRecql4fl/+ (het) animals. The extended survival was explained when the Recql4 status in the tumors that arose was assessed, and in no case was there complete deletion of Recql4 in the dKO OS. These data provide a mechanism for the benign skeletal phenotypes of RECQL4 mutation syndromes. We propose that tumor suppression and osteosarcoma susceptibility are most likely a function of mutant, not null, alleles of RECQL4.
RecQ helicases, also addressed as a gatekeeper of genome, are an inevitable family of genome scrutiny proteins conserved from prokaryotes to eukaryotes and play a vital role in DNA metabolism. The deficiencies of three RecQ proteins out of five are involved in genetic abnormalities like Bloom syndrome (BS), Werner syndrome (WS), and Rothmund-Thomson syndrome (RTS). It is noteworthy that Plasmodium falciparum contains only two members of the RecQ family as opposed to five members present in the host Homo sapiens. In the present study, we report the biochemical characterization of the homologue of Werner (Wrn) helicase from P. falciparum 3D7 strain. Although there are significant sequence conservations between Wrn helicases of both H. sapiens and P. falciparum as well as among all the other Plasmodium species, they contain some peculiar differences also. In silico studies reveal that PfWrn is evolutionarily close to the bacterial RecQ protein. The N-terminal fragment (PfWrnN) contains all the helicase motifs along with all the functional domains and the predicted structure resembles with the human RecQ1 protein, whereas the C-terminal fragment (PfWrnC) contains no significant domain. Biochemical characterization further revealed that purified recombinant PfWrnN shows ATPase and DNA helicase activity in 3' to 5' direction, but PfWrnC lacks the ATPase and helicase activities. Immunofluorescence study shows that PfWrn is expressed in all the stages of intraerythrocytic development of the P. falciparum 3D7 strain and localizes distinctly in the nucleus. This study can be used for further characterization of RecQ helicases that will aid in understanding the physiological significance of these helicases in the malaria parasite.
SMARCA4 (BRG1) and SMARCB1 (INI1) are tumor suppressor genes that are crucially involved in the formation of malignant rhabdoid tumors, such as atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumor (AT/RT). AT/RTs typically affect infants and occur at various sites of the CNS with a particular frequency in the cerebellum. Here, granule neurons and their progenitors represent the most abundant cell type and are known to give rise to a subset of medulloblastoma, a histologically similar embryonal brain tumor. To test how Smarc proteins influence the development of granule neurons and whether this population may serve as cellular origin for AT/RTs, we specifically deleted Smarca4 and Smarcb1 in cerebellar granule cell precursors. Respective mutant mice displayed severe ataxia and motor coordination deficits, but did not develop any tumors. In fact, they suffered from a severely hypoplastic cerebellum due to a significant inhibition of granule neuron precursor proliferation. Molecularly, this was accompanied by an enhanced activity of Wnt/β-catenin signaling that, by itself, is known to cause a nearly identical phenotype. We further used an hGFAP-cre allele, which deleted Smarcb1 much earlier and in a wider neural precursor population, but we still did not detect any tumor formation in the CNS. In summary, our results emphasize cell-type-dependent roles of Smarc proteins and argue against cerebellar granule cells and other progeny of hGFAP-positive neural precursors as the cellular origin for AT/RTs.
The RECQ family of DNA helicases is a conserved group of enzymes that are important for maintaining genomic integrity. In humans, there are five RECQ helicase genes, and mutations in three of them-BLM, WRN, and RECQL4-are associated with the genetic disorders Bloom syndrome, Werner syndrome, and Rothmund-Thomson syndrome (RTS), respectively. Importantly all three diseases are cancer predisposition syndromes. Patients with RTS are highly and uniquely susceptible to developing osteosarcoma; thus, RTS provides a good model to study the pathogenesis of osteosarcoma. The "tumor suppressor" role of RECQL4 and the other RECQ helicases is an area of active investigation. This chapter reviews what is currently known about the cellular functions of RECQL4 and how these may relate to tumorigenesis, as well as ongoing efforts to understand RECQL4's functions in vivo using animal models. Understanding the RECQ pathways may provide insight into avenues for novel cancer therapies in the future.
Cellular senescence refers to irreversible growth arrest of primary eukaryotic cells, a process thought to contribute to aging-related degeneration and disease. Deficiency of RecQ helicase RECQL4 leads to Rothmund-Thomson syndrome (RTS), and we have investigated whether senescence is involved using cellular approaches and a mouse model. We first systematically investigated whether depletion of RECQL4 and the other four human RecQ helicases, BLM, WRN, RECQL1 and RECQL5, impacts the proliferative potential of human primary fibroblasts. BLM-, WRN- and RECQL4-depleted cells display increased staining of senescence-associated β-galactosidase (SA-β-gal), higher expression of p16(INK4a) or/and p21(WAF1) and accumulated persistent DNA damage foci. These features were less frequent in RECQL1- and RECQL5-depleted cells. We have mapped the region in RECQL4 that prevents cellular senescence to its N-terminal region and helicase domain. We further investigated senescence features in an RTS mouse model, Recql4-deficient mice (Recql4(HD)). Tail fibroblasts from Recql4(HD) showed increased SA-β-gal staining and increased DNA damage foci. We also identified sparser tail hair and fewer blood cells in Recql4(HD) mice accompanied with increased senescence in tail hair follicles and in bone marrow cells. In conclusion, dysfunction of RECQL4 increases DNA damage and triggers premature senescence in both human and mouse cells, which may contribute to symptoms in RTS patients.
Three overlapping conditions, namely Rothmund-Thomson (RTS), Baller-Gerold (BGS) and RAPADILINO syndromes, have been attributed to RECQL4 mutations. Differential diagnoses depend on the clinical presentation, but the numbers of known genes remain low, leading to the widespread prescription of RECQL4 sequencing. The aim of our study was therefore to determine the best clinical indicators for the presence of RECQL4 mutations in a series of 39 patients referred for RECQL4 molecular analysis and belonging to the RTS (27 cases) and BGS (12 cases) spectrum. One or two deleterious RECQL4 mutations were found in 10/27 patients referred for RTS diagnosis. Clinical and molecular reevaluation led to a different diagnosis in 7/17 negative cases, including Clericuzio-type poikiloderma with neutropenia, hereditary sclerosing poikiloderma, and craniosynostosis/anal anomalies/porokeratosis. No RECQL4 mutations were found in the BGS group without poikiloderma, confirming that RECQL4 sequencing was not indicated in this phenotype. One chromosomal abnormality and one TWIST mutation was found in this cohort. This study highlights the search for differential diagnoses before the prescription of RECQL4 sequencing in this clinically heterogeneous group. The combination of clinically defined subgroups and next-generation sequencing will hopefully bring to light new molecular bases of syndromes with poikiloderma, as well as BGS without poikiloderma.
Germline mutations in RECQL4 and p53 lead to cancer predisposition syndromes, Rothmund-Thomson syndrome (RTS) and Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS), respectively. RECQL4 is essential for the transport of p53 to the mitochondria under unstressed conditions. Here, we show that both RECQL4 and p53 interact with mitochondrial polymerase (PolγA/B2) and regulate its binding to the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) control region (D-loop). Both RECQL4 and p53 bind to the exonuclease and polymerase domains of PolγA. Kinetic constants for interactions between PolγA-RECQL4, PolγA-p53 and PolγB-p53 indicate that RECQL4 and p53 are accessory factors for PolγA-PolγB and PolγA-DNA interactions. RECQL4 enhances the binding of PolγA to DNA, thereby potentiating the exonuclease and polymerization activities of PolγA/B2. To investigate whether lack of RECQL4 and p53 results in increased mitochondrial genome instability, resequencing of the entire mitochondrial genome was undertaken from multiple RTS and LFS patient fibroblasts. We found multiple somatic mutations and polymorphisms in both RTS and LFS patient cells. A significant number of mutations and polymorphisms were common between RTS and LFS patients. These changes are associated with either aging and/or cancer, thereby indicating that the phenotypes associated with these syndromes may be due to deregulation of mitochondrial genome stability caused by the lack of RECQL4 and p53.
The biochemical mechanisms by which RECQL4 and p53 affect mtDNA replication have been elucidated. Resequencing of RTS and LFS patients' mitochondrial genome reveals common mutations indicating similar mechanisms of regulation by RECQL4 and p53.
The follow-up of a man from birth to adulthood, presenting with features both of RAPADILINO and Rothmund-Thomson syndrome (RTS), is described. Molecular studies confirmed the presence of two different mutations, c.2767_2768delTT and c.3061C&gt;T, in the RECQL4 gene. This gene is known to be causative of a spectrum including Baller-Gerold syndrome, RAPADILINO syndrome and RTS. New and rare features such as oral leukoplakia and very prominent hyperkeratotic verrucous papules on both soles are shown. This patient has to date no cancer history despite bearing a truncating mutation at the age of 21 years, which is also unusual.
Breast cancer occur both in hereditary and sporadic forms, and the later one comprises an overwhelming majority of breast cancer cases among women. Numerical and structural alterations involving chromosome 8, with loss of short arm (8p) and gain of long arm (8q), are frequently observed in breast cancer cells and tissues. In this study, we show that most of the human breast tumor cell lines examined display an over representation of 8q24, a chromosomal locus RecQL4 is regionally mapped to, and consequently, a markedly elevated level of RecQL4 expression. An increased RecQL4 mRNA level was also observed in a majority of clinical breast tumor samples (38/43) examined. shRNA-mediated RecQL4 suppression in MDA-MB453 breast cancer cells not only significantly inhibit the in vitro clonogenic survival and in vivo tumorigenicity. Further studies demonstrate that RecQL4 physically interacts with a major survival factor-survivin and its protein level affects survivin expression. Although loss of RecQL4 function due to gene mutations causally linked to occurrence of human RTS with features of premature aging and cancer predisposition, our studies provide the evidence that overexpression of RecQL4 due to gene amplification play a critical role in human breast tumor progression.
RecQ5 is a member of the RecQ family of DNA helicases. There are 5 RecQ members in humans. Defects in 3 of them, i.e., BLM, WRN, and RTS, cause Bloom, Werner, and Rothmund-Thomson syndromes, respectively. RECQL1 and RECQL5 have not been associated with any human disease, and their precise roles are unknown. Our previous study suggests that the lack of RecQ5, which is the Drosophila homolog of RECQL5, leads to the accumulation of DNA double-stranded breaks (DSBs). It is possible that RecQ5 is involved in DSB repair. However, little is known about this possible function of RecQ5 in DSB repair. Here, we report that Rad51 protein, which plays a critical role in DSB repair, interacted with RecQ5 in vitro and in vivo in Drosophila. The Rad51 protein interacted with the C-terminal region of RecQ5, as shown by the yeast two-hybrid method. Moreover, the C-terminal region of the RecQ5 protein and the central region of Rad51 interacted directly and specifically when examined by the glutathione-S-transferase pull-down method. Consistent with these results, when RecQ5 and Rad51 were co-expressed in Drosophila cells in culture, they became co-localized in nuclei and could be co-immunoprecipitated. Furthermore, RecQ5-deficient flies (recq5) were more sensitive to the chemotherapeutic agent cisplatin compared with wild-type ones. Also, Rad51 mutants (rad51) were more sensitive to cisplatin, with sensitivity similar to that of recq5 rad51 double mutants. These data suggest that RecQ5 and Rad51 in Drosophila functioned for survival after the flies had been treated with cisplatin.
Mutations in RECQL4 helicase are associated with Rothmund-Thomson syndrome (RTS). A subset of RTS patients is predisposed to cancer and is sensitive to DNA damaging agents. The enhanced sensitivity of cells from RTS patients correlates with the accumulation of transcriptionally active nuclear p53. We found that in untreated normal human cells these two nuclear proteins, p53 and RECQL4, instead colocalize in the mitochondrial nucleoids. RECQL4 accumulates in mitochondria in all phases of the cell cycle except S phase and physically interacts with p53 only in the absence of DNA damage. p53-RECQL4 binding leads to the masking of the nuclear localization signal of p53. The N-terminal 84 amino acids of RECQL4 contain a mitochondrial localization signal, which causes the localization of RECQL4-p53 complex to the mitochondria. RECQL4-p53 interaction is disrupted after stress, allowing p53 translocation to the nucleus. In untreated normal cells RECQL4 optimizes de novo replication of mtDNA, which is consequently decreased in fibroblasts from RTS patients. Wild-type RECQL4-complemented RTS cells show relocalization of both RECQL4 and p53 to the mitochondria, loss of p53 activation, restoration of de novo mtDNA replication and resistance to different types of DNA damage. In cells expressing Δ84 RECQL4, which cannot translocate to mitochondria, all the above functions are compromised. The recruitment of p53 to the sites of de novo mtDNA replication is also regulated by RECQL4. Thus these findings elucidate the mechanism by which p53 is regulated by RECQL4 in unstressed normal cells and also delineates the mitochondrial functions of the helicase.
RECQL4 is associated with Rothmund-Thomson Syndrome (RTS), a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by premature aging, genomic instability, and cancer predisposition. RECQL4 is a member of the RecQ helicase family, and has many similarities to WRN protein, which is also implicated in premature aging. There is no information about whether any of the RecQ helicases play roles in mitochondrial biogenesis, which is strongly implicated in the aging process. Here, we used microscopy to visualize RECQL4 in mitochondria. Fractionation of human and mouse cells also showed that RECQL4 was present in mitochondria. Q-PCR amplification of mitochondrial DNA demonstrated that mtDNA damage accumulated in RECQL4-deficient cells. Microarray analysis suggested that mitochondrial bioenergetic pathways might be affected in RTS. Measurements of mitochondrial bioenergetics showed a reduction in the mitochondrial reserve capacity after lentiviral knockdown of RECQL4 in two different primary cell lines. Additionally, biochemical assays with RECQL4, mitochondrial transcription factor A, and mitochondrial DNA polymerase γ showed that the polymerase inhibited RECQL4's helicase activity. RECQL4 is the first 3'-5' RecQ helicase to be found in both human and mouse mitochondria, and the loss of RECQL4 alters mitochondrial integrity.
Telomeres are structures at the ends of chromosomes and are composed of long tracks of short tandem repeat DNA sequences bound by a unique set of proteins (shelterin). Telomeric DNA is believed to form G-quadruplex and D-loop structures, which presents a challenge to the DNA replication and repair machinery. Although the RecQ helicases WRN and BLM are implicated in the resolution of telomeric secondary structures, very little is known about RECQL4, the RecQ helicase mutated in Rothmund-Thomson syndrome (RTS). Here, we report that RTS patient cells have elevated levels of fragile telomeric ends and that RECQL4-depleted human cells accumulate fragile sites, sister chromosome exchanges, and double strand breaks at telomeric sites. Further, RECQL4 localizes to telomeres and associates with shelterin proteins TRF1 and TRF2. Using recombinant proteins we showed that RECQL4 resolves telomeric D-loop structures with the help of shelterin proteins TRF1, TRF2, and POT1. We also found a novel functional synergistic interaction of this protein with WRN during D-loop unwinding. These data implicate RECQL4 in telomere maintenance.
Poikiloderma occurs in a number of hereditary syndromes, the best known of which is Rothmund-Thomson syndrome (RTS). Differential diagnoses include Dyskeratosis Congenita (DC) with high genetic heterogeneity and Clericuzio-type Poikiloderma with Neutropenia (CPN) due to mutations in the C16orf57 gene. Mutations in the RECQL4 gene are only observed in two thirds of RTS patients. In this study, 10 patients referred for syndromic poikiloderma and negative for RECQL4 sequencing analysis were investigated for C16orf57 mutations. Two C16orf57 heterozygous nonsense mutations (p.W81X and p.Y89X) were identified in a 5-year-old female child presenting with generalized poikiloderma, dental dysplasia, gingivitis, nail dystrophy, palmoplantar keratoderma and pachyonychia of the great toenails. Previously undetected and silent neutropenia was evidenced after C16orf57 molecular analysis. Neutropenia was absent in the C16orf57-negative patients. This report confirms that neutrophil count should be performed in all patients with poikiloderma to target the C16orf57 gene sequencing analysis, prior to RECQL4 analysis.
Atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumors (AT/RTs) are highly aggressive brain tumors of early childhood poorly responding to therapy. The majority of cases show inactivation of SMARCB1 (INI1, hSNF5, BAF47), a core member of the adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-dependent SWI/SNF chromatin-remodeling complex. We here report the case of a supratentorial AT/RT in a 9-month-old boy, which showed retained SMARCB1 staining on immunohistochemistry and lacked genetic alterations of SMARCB1. Instead, the tumor showed loss of protein expression of another SWI/SNF chromatin-remodeling complex member, the ATPase subunit SMARCA4 (BRG1) due to a homozygous SMARCA4 mutation [c.2032C&gt;T (p.Q678X)]. Our findings highlight the role of SMARCA4 in the pathogenesis of SMARCB1-positive AT/RT and the usefulness of antibodies directed against SMARCA4 in this diagnostic setting.
The levels of expression of the α1 and α3 subunits of the Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase (the NaK sodium pump) in medulloblastomas are unclear.
This study investigated the expression of the NaK subunits using immunohistochemical methods in 29 medulloblastomas including 23 classic, three large-cell/anaplastic and three nodular/desmoplastic medulloblastomas, as well as in three atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumors (AT/RTs).
There was overexpression of the α1 or α3 NaK subunits in more than half of the medulloblastomas and atypical AT/RTs, with about one-third of these tumours displaying overexpression of both subunits.
These preliminary data suggest that targeting these subunits in AT/RTs and medulloblastomas that overexpress these proteins may lead to therapeutic benefit. These findings warrant confirmation in larger numbers of patients than those used in this study. Moreover, it should be determined whether inhibition of the α1/α3 NaK subunits can be integrated into the risk stratification schemes already in use for medulloblastoma patients.
Rothmund-Thomson syndrome (RTS) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder of which approximately 300 cases have been reported in the literature. Patients with RTS often present early in life with skeletal and dental abnormalities, short stature, juvenile cataracts, and a characteristic poikilodermal rash. They are at increased risk for the development of osteosarcoma that usually presents by the second decade of life. The genetic defects underlying RTS are truncating mutations in RECQL4, a gene involved with chromosomal stability. Several cases of primary hematological malignancies have been reported in RTS, but it is unclear whether patients with RTS are at higher risk to develop either primary or secondary hematological malignancies. We report a patient with RTS who presented to our clinic at the age of 7, subsequently developed multifocal and recurrent osteosarcoma that was followed by the development of a myelodysplastic syndrome with subsequent progression to acute myeloid leukemia.
Rothmund-Thomson syndrome (RTS) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by premature aging, developmental abnormalities, and a predisposition to cancer. RTS is caused by mutations in the RECQL4 gene, which encodes one of the five human RecQ helicases. To identify the cellular functions of RECQL4, we generated a chicken DT40 cell line in which RECQL4 expression could be turned off by doxycycline (Dox). Upon exposure to Dox, cells stopped growing and underwent apoptosis. The cells could be rescued by expression of the N-terminal region of RECQL4 (amino acids 1-496), which lacks the helicase domain and has sequence similarity to yeast Sld2, which plays an essential function in the initiation of DNA replication in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Smaller fragments of the N-terminal region of RECQL4 did not rescue the cells from lethality. RECQL4 gene knockout cells complemented with RECQL4 (1-496) showed relatively high sensitivity to DNA damaging agents that induce double strand breaks and cross-links, suggesting that the C-terminal region including the helicase domain of RECQL4 is involved in the repair of certain types of DNA lesions.
This study evaluated the effectiveness of Standing Strong Together (SST), a combined group based parent and child intervention for externalizing behavior in 9-16 year-old children with mild to borderline intellectual disabilities (MBID). Children with externalizing behavior and MBID (IQ from 55 to 85) (N = 169) were cluster randomly assigned to SST combined with care as usual or to care as usual only. SST led to a significant benefit on teacher reported but not on parent reported externalizing behavior. SST had significant effects on parent rated positive parenting and the parent-child relationship. The present study shows that a multicomponent group based intervention for children with MBID is feasible and has the potential to reduce children's externalizing behavior and improve both parenting behavior and the parent-child relationship.
The extracellular matrix (ECM) is a major component of the tumor microenvironment, contributing to the regulation of cell survival, proliferation, differentiation and metastasis. In multiple myeloma (MM), interactions between MM cells and the bone marrow (BM) microenvironment, including the BM ECM, are critical to the pathogenesis of the disease and the development of drug resistance. Nevertheless, composition of the ECM in MM and its role in supporting MM pathogenesis has not been reported. We have applied a novel proteomic-based strategy and defined the BM ECM composition in patients with monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS), newly diagnosed and relapsed MM compared to healthy donor-derived BM ECM. In this study, we show that the tumor ECM is remodeled at the mRNA and protein level in MGUS and MM to allow development of a permissive microenvironment. We further demonstrate that two ECM-affiliated proteins, ANXA2 and LGALS1, are more abundant in MM and high expression is associated with a decreased overall survival. This study points to the importance of ECM remodeling in MM and provides a novel proteomic pipeline for interrogating the role of the ECM in cancers with BM tropism.Leukemia accepted article preview online, 27 March 2017. doi:10.1038/leu.2017.102.
A 2 °C increase in global temperature above pre-industrial levels is considered a reasonable target for avoiding the most devastating impacts of anthropogenic climate change. In June 2015, sea surface temperature (SST) of the South China Sea (SCS) increased by 2 °C in response to the developing Pacific El Niño. On its own, this moderate, short-lived warming was unlikely to cause widespread damage to coral reefs in the region, and the coral reef "Bleaching Alert" alarm was not raised. However, on Dongsha Atoll, in the northern SCS, unusually weak winds created low-flow conditions that amplified the 2 °C basin-scale anomaly. Water temperatures on the reef flat, normally indistinguishable from open-ocean SST, exceeded 6 °C above normal summertime levels. Mass coral bleaching quickly ensued, killing 40% of the resident coral community in an event unprecedented in at least the past 40 years. Our findings highlight the risks of 2 °C ocean warming to coral reef ecosystems when global and local processes align to drive intense heating, with devastating consequences.
The development of codes and power calculations currently allows the simulation of increasingly complex flows, especially in the turbulent regime. Swimming research should benefit from these technological advances to try to better understand the dynamic mechanisms involved in swimming. An unsteady Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) study is conducted in crawl, in order to analyse the propulsive forces generated by the hand and forearm. The k-ω SST turbulence model and an overset grid method have been used. The main objectives are to analyse the evolution of the hand-forearm propulsive forces and to explain this relative to the arm kinematics parameters. In order to validate our simulation model, the calculated forces and pressures were compared with several other experimental and numerical studies. A good agreement is found between our results and those of other studies. The hand is the segment that generates the most propulsive forces during the aquatic stroke. As the pressure component is the main source of force, the orientation of the hand-forearm in the absolute coordinate system is an important kinematic parameter in the swimming performance. The propulsive forces are biggest when the angles of attack are high. CFD appears as a very valuable tool to better analyze the mechanisms of swimming performance and offers some promising developments, especially for optimizing the performance from a parametric study.
To determine if an overnight metyrapone test (OMT) within the first week post pituitary surgery can definitively assess the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, compared with subsequent dynamic tests and glucocorticoid requirement at 6 months.
Prospective study measuring morning cortisol levels on day 3 and 4 post-operatively, OMT day 5-7 and week 6, 250μg short Synacthen test (SST) week 6 and insulin tolerance test (ITT) week 7.
Forty participants who underwent pituitary surgery at a single centre (Cushing's disease excluded) and were followed for at least 6 months. 46% had pre-operative adrenal insufficiency.
Week 1 OMT compared to glucocorticoid requirement at 6 months.
the performance of ITT as a "definitive" test and all tests compared to glucocorticoid requirement at 6 months.
Week 1 OMT showed concordance with ITT at week 7 of 78% and glucocorticoid requirement at 6 months of 81% respectively which was not significantly different from post-operative morning cortisol levels. 37% of participants with an abnormal OMT on day 6 had a normal OMT at week 6. All HPA axis tests showed similar concordance with glucocorticoid requirement at 6 months of 80-85%.
OMT within the first week after pituitary surgery was no better than an early morning cortisol level at predicting glucocorticoid requirement at 6 months. OMT at week 6 demonstrated recovery of HPA axis in a substantial proportion of participants who failed earlier assessments; thus definitive testing should be delayed until 6 weeks post-operatively.

There are several posterior decompression techniques for lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS). There is a trend towards performing less invasive surgical procedures, but no multicentre randomized controlled trials have evaluated the relative efficacy of these techniques at short and long-term.
A multicentre randomized controlled trial [the Spinal Stenosis Trial (SST) (part of the NORDSTEN study)] including 465 patients aged 18-80 years with neurogenic claudication or radiating pain and MRI findings indicating lumbar spinal stenosis without spondylolisthesis is performed to compare three posterior decompression techniques: unilateral laminotomy with crossover, bilateral laminotomy and spinous process osteotomy. The primary outcome is change in Oswestry Disability Index (ODI 2 years postoperatively). Secondary outcomes are change in EQ-5D, Zurich Claudication Questionnaire, and Numeric Rating Scale for leg-pain and back-pain. Also recorded were Global Perceived Effect score, complications, length of hospital stay, reoperation rate 2 years postoperatively, difference in recurrence of symptoms or postoperative instability, and MRI change in the dural sac area. Further, a 5 and 10 years follow-up is planned with the same outcome measures.
Newer and less invasive techniques are increasingly favoured in surgery for LSS. This trial will compare the clinical and radiological results of three different techniques, and may contribute to better clinical decision making in the surgical treatment of LSS.

The El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the variability in the Pacific subtropical highs (PSHs) have major impacts on social and ecological systems. Here we present an Atlantic capacitor effect mechanism to suggest that the Atlantic is a key pacemaker of the biennial variability in the Pacific including that in ENSO and the PSHs during recent decades. The 'charging' (that is, ENSO imprinting the North Tropical Atlantic (NTA) sea surface temperature (SST) via an atmospheric bridge mechanism) and 'discharging' (that is, the NTA SST triggering the following ENSO via a subtropical teleconnection mechanism) processes alternate, generating the biennial rhythmic changes in the Pacific. Since the early 1990s, a warmer Atlantic due to the positive phase of Atlantic multidecadal oscillation and global warming trend has provided more favourable background state for the Atlantic capacitor effect, giving rise to enhanced biennial variability in the Pacific that may increase the occurrence frequency of severe natural hazard events.
Objective: Diagnostic efficacy of serum markers is low for heart failure patients with preserved left ventricular ejection fraction (HF-pEF) as compared to heart failure patients with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction.We sought to explore the diagnostic value of serum levels of soluble ST2 (sST2) combined with interleukin-33 (IL-33) for the diagnosis of HF-pEF in this study. Methods: A total of 376 patients with HF-pEF (HF group), 376 matched-control patients without heart failure who shared similar clinical characteristics (non-HF group) were included in the study.Another 500 healthy individuals were recruited for assessing the normal ranges of IL-33 and sST2.Serum levels of NT-proBNP were measured by chemi-luminescence assay, while IL-33 and sST2 were measured by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay. Results: Serum levels of IL-33 and sST2 were not normally distributed in healthy population.Serum concentrations of IL-33 and sST2 were significantly higher in HF-pEF patients than in patients in non-HF group (median, IL-33: 0.437 μg/L vs. 0.127 μg/L, P&lt;0.01; sST: 0.118 μg/L vs. 0.067 μg/L, P&lt;0.01). The area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of sST2 for detecting HF-pEF was 0.763 (95%CI 0.729-0.795, P&lt;0.01), with 71.01% sensitivity and 66.75% specificity, the AUC was 0.884 (95%CI 0.859-0.908, P&lt;0.01), with 80.05% sensitivity and 81.91% specificity in patients with serum IL-33 higher than 0.117 μg/L (median level of serum IL-33 in healthy individuals, n=306). The AUC of NT-proBNP for detecting HF-pEF was 0.83, with 74.73% sensitivity and 84.57% specificity.The AUC of sST2 for detecting HF-pEF was significantly higher than NT-proBNP in population with high serum IL-33 (AUC: 0.88 vs. 0.83, P&lt;0.01). Conclusion: Serum sST2 could serve as a satisfactory biomarker for HF-pEF diagnosis, especially for patients with high serum IL-33 concentrations.
目的： 探讨血清可溶性ST2(sST2)联合白细胞介素-33(IL-33)应用于辅助诊断射血分数保留的心力衰竭(HF-pEF)的效能。 方法： 纳入中山大学孙逸仙纪念医院2010年1月至2014年12月于心血管内科住院的HF-pEF患者共376例(HF组)，纳入同期临床基本资料匹配而无心力衰竭的患者376例作为对照(非HF组)；另纳入健康体检者500名以确立IL-33及sST2的正常值范围。应用免疫酶联吸附方法检测血清sST2及IL-33水平，化学发光法检测N末端B型利钠肽原(NT-proBNP)水平，采用受试者工作特征曲线(ROC)分析sST2用于辅助诊断HF-pEF的效能。 结果： 血清IL-33及sST2浓度在人群中呈偏态分布，HF组患者血清IL-33及sST2水平均显著高于非HF组(中位数，IL-33：0.437 μg/L比0.127 μg/L，P&lt;0.01；sST：0.118 μg/L比0.067 μg/L，P&lt;0.01)。sST2用于辅助诊断HF-pEF最佳切点值为0.159 μg/L，此时ROC下面积为0.763(95%CI 0.729～0.795，P&lt;0.01)，敏感度为71.01%，特异度为66.75%；健康体检人群中位血清IL-33水平为0.117 μg/L，当仅纳入血清IL-33高于此值的HF-pEF患者(n＝306)时，sST2用于辅助诊断HF-pEF的ROC下面积为0.884(95%CI 0.859～0.908，P&lt;0.01)，敏感度为80.05%，特异度为81.91%。在高IL-33水平人群中，sST2用辅助诊断HF-pEF的ROC下面积大于NT-proBNP(0.88比0.83，P&lt;0.01)。 结论： 血清sST2可用于辅助诊断HF-pEF，联合测定IL-33可进一步提高诊断效能。.
The Gulf of Guinea represents a wide tract of the African coast with complex and rich coastal ecosystems undergoing various pressures. The seasonal variations of chlorophyll-a concentration (Chla) along the Gulf of Guinea (GoG) and their relations with physical oceanographic variables were analyzed using satellite observations covering the period 2002-2012. The effects of sea surface temperature (SST), sea level anomalies (SLA), winds, geostrophic currents, eddy kinetic energy (EKE), mesoscale eddies and fronts were considered on a monthly time scale. The analysis for each unit area was carried out on a chlorophyll index (IChla) computed as the product of the mean distance from the coast to the eutrophic threshold (1 mg m(-3) isoline) and the average Chla in the eutrophic area. The study, based on satellite-derived Chla, was allowed by the unprecedented coverage given by the products distributed by the ESA Ocean Colour Climate Change Initiative (OC_CCI) resulting from the merging of data from several satellite missions. The physical variables served as potential predictors in a statistical Boosted Regression Tree (BRT) model. To account for the heterogeneous nature of the GoG, the analysis was conducted on eight systems that made up a partition of the whole region defined on the basis of the BRT model results and climatological properties. The western-most domain, from Guinea-Bissau to Sierra Leone, was associated with upwelling properties in boreal winter and appeared to share some characteristics with the overall Northwest African upwelling system. The region of Ivory Coast and Ghana also had upwelling properties but the main upwelling season was in boreal summer. In general upwelling conditions with cold SST, negative SLA, fairly strong frontal activity, and moderate winds, appeared as the environmental window most favorable to high IChla values. For these systems, the BRT model fitted the IChla data well with a percentage of explained total deviance [Formula: see text] between 70% and 91% when using only physical oceanographic variables. Finally, the systems associated with the coasts of Nigeria to Gabon showed some mixed properties, with [Formula: see text] values of 54-60%. Among these systems, a common feature seemed to be the importance of river discharge to explain IChla variations. Where possible (for the Niger River in the Nigeria system), the addition of river data as predictor in the BRT model resulted in a significant increase of [Formula: see text] to 75%. Further progress is needed to understand the observed relationships and to predict how they can evolve in the face of climate change.
Sleep disturbance is a major complaint of patients with rotator cuff disease that often leads them to seek treatment. The authors previously reported a prospective analysis of patients who underwent rotator cuff repair and found that sleep disturbance significantly improved at 3 months after surgery. That improvement in sleep was maintained at 6 months.
In the current study, the authors sought to gain medium-term data on this same population at greater than 2 years. The hypotheses were that improvement in sleep disturbance after arthroscopic rotator cuff repair is maintained at 2-year follow-up and that the continued use of narcotic pain medication has a negative effect on sleep quality at 2-year follow-up.
Case series; Level of evidence, 4.
The original cohort of patients was contacted at a minimum of 24 months after their surgery. Thirty-seven of the 56 patients (66%) involved in the original study were available. Patient outcomes were scored using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Simple Shoulder Test (SST), visual analog scale (VAS) for pain, and Single Assessment Numeric Evaluation (SANE). The newly obtained scores were compared with prior scores, which ranged from preoperatively to 6 months postoperatively.
The statistically significant improvement of the PSQI score demonstrated in our prior analysis at 6 months postoperatively was maintained, with a mean PSQI score of 5.5 for the 37 patients followed beyond 24 months. Of those patients, 41% still had a PSQI score &gt;5, indicative of sleep disturbance. However, even those patients in our study with a PSQI score &gt;5, indicative of sleep disturbance, had an improved mean score of 9.3 at greater than 24 months compared with those patients with a PSQI score &gt;5 at 6 months, who had a mean PSQI score of 11.5 ( P = .13). Both the SST and VAS scores displayed continued improvement at greater than 24 months, with both displaying moderate strength correlation to the PSQI score (VAS: Spearman rho = 0.479, P &lt; .001; SST: Spearman rho = -0.505, P &lt; .001). Regression models again demonstrated the continued use of narcotic pain medication correlating with poor sleep as the difference in the mean PSQI score between users and nonusers increased as postoperative time increased. At greater than 24 months after surgery, patients using narcotics had a mean PSQI score that was 7.4 points higher than narcotic nonusers (standard error [SE] = 1.93; P = .00017).
At greater than 24 months, 41% of patients still demonstrated sleep disturbance, with both SST and VAS scores showing improvement. The prolonged use of narcotic medication negatively affects sleep, with a greater effect seen over time.
The Hydroporus memnonius species group includes both widespread and range restricted diving beetle taxa in the western Palaearctic, some of which have been divided into a number of geographical subspecies. Of these, Hydroporus necopinatus is distributed in the far west of Europe, from central Spain to southern Britain, and has been split into three subspecies, occurring in Iberia (necopinatus sst.), France (robertorum) and England (roni) respectively-the last of these being a rare example of an insect taxon apparently endemic to northern Europe. Here we explore inter-relationships between populations and subspecies of H. necopinatus and related members of the Hydroporus melanarius subgroup, using mitochondrial COI sequence data. We reveal widespread discordance between mitochondrial DNA sequence variation and morphology in areas where H. necopinatus and H. melanarius come into contact, consistent with historical introgressive hybridization between these taxa. In light of this discordance, the lack of clear genetic divergence between H. necopinatus subspecies, and the fact that both robertorum and roni are morphologically intermediate between H. necopinatus sstr. and H. melanarius, we suggest that these taxa may be of hybridogenic origin, rather than representing discrete evolutionary lineages.
The socio-technical systems approach to design is well documented. Recognising the benefits of this approach, organisations are increasingly trying to work with systems, rather than their component parts. However, few tools attempt to analyse the complexity inherent in such systems, in ways that generate useful, practical outputs. In this paper, we outline the 'System Scenarios Tool' (SST), which is a novel, applied methodology that can be used by designers, end-users, consultants or researchers to help design or re-design work systems. The paper introduces the SST using examples of its application, and describes the potential benefits of its use, before reflecting on its limitations. Finally, we discuss potential opportunities for the tool, and describe sets of circumstances in which it might be used. Practitioner Summary: The paper presents a novel, applied methodological tool, named the 'Systems Scenarios Tool'. We believe this tool can be used as a point of reference by designers, end-users, consultants or researchers, to help design or re-design work systems. Included in the paper are two worked examples, demonstrating the tool's application.
Global ocean temperatures rapidly warmed by ~5°C during the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM; ~56 million years ago). Extratropical sea surface temperatures (SSTs) met or exceeded modern subtropical values. With these warm extratropical temperatures, climate models predict tropical SSTs &gt;35°C-near upper physiological temperature limits for many organisms. However, few data are available to test these projected extreme tropical temperatures or their potential lethality. We identify the PETM in a shallow marine sedimentary section deposited in Nigeria. On the basis of planktonic foraminiferal Mg/Ca and oxygen isotope ratios and the molecular proxy [Formula: see text], latest Paleocene equatorial SSTs were ~33°C, and [Formula: see text] indicates that SSTs rose to &gt;36°C during the PETM. This confirms model predictions on the magnitude of polar amplification and refutes the tropical thermostat theory. We attribute a massive drop in dinoflagellate abundance and diversity at peak warmth to thermal stress, showing that the base of tropical food webs is vulnerable to rapid warming.
Since its initial discovery in Drosophila, Hedgehog (HH) signaling has long been associated with foregut development. The mammalian genome expresses 3 HH ligands, with sonic hedgehog (SHH) levels highest in the mucosa of the embryonic foregut. More recently, interest in the pathway has shifted to improving our understanding of its role in gastrointestinal cancers. The use of reporter mice proved instrumental in our ability to probe the expression pattern of SHH ligand and the cell types responding to canonical HH signaling during homeostasis, inflammation, and neoplastic transformation. SHH is highly expressed in parietal cells and is required for these cells to produce gastric acid. Furthermore, myofibroblasts are the predominant cell type responding to HH ligand in the uninfected stomach. Chronic infection caused by Helicobacter pylori and associated inflammation induces parietal cell atrophy and the expansion of metaplastic cell types, a precursor to gastric cancer in human subjects. During Helicobacter infection in mice, canonical HH signaling is required for inflammatory cells to be recruited from the bone marrow to the stomach and for metaplastic development. Specifically, polarization of the invading myeloid cells to myeloid-derived suppressor cells requires the HH-regulated transcription factor GLI1, thereby creating a microenvironment favoring wound healing and neoplastic transformation. In mice, GLI1 mediates the phenotypic shift to gastric myeloid-derived suppressor cells by directly inducing Schlafen 4 (slfn4). However, the human homologs of SLFN4, designated SLFN5 and SLFN12L, also correlate with intestinal metaplasia and could be used as biomarkers to predict the subset of individuals who might progress to gastric cancer and benefit from treatment with HH antagonists.
Larval dispersal significantly contributes to the geographic distribution, population dynamics and evolutionary processes of animals endemic to deep-sea hydrothermal vents. Little is known as to the extent that their larvae migrate vertically to shallower waters and experience stronger currents and richer food supplies. Here, we first provide evidence from early life-history traits and population genetics for the surface dispersal of a vent species. Planktotrophic larvae of a red blood limpet, Shinkailepas myojinensis (Gastropoda: Neritimorpha: Phenacolepadidae), were cultured to observe their swimming behavior and to evaluate the effects of temperature on survival and growth. In addition, the population structure was analyzed based on 1.2-kbp mitochondrial DNA sequences from 77 specimens that cover the geographic and bathymetric distributions of the species (northwest Pacific, 442-1227 m in depth). Hatched larvae constantly swam upward at 16.6-44.2 mm/min depending on temperature. Vertical migration from hydrothermal vents to the surface, calculated to take ca. 4-45 days, is attainable given their lengthy survival time without feeding. Fed larvae best survived and grew at 25°C (followed by 20°C), which approximates the sea surface temperature (SST) in the geographic range of the species. Little or no growth was observed at the temperature of the vent habitat where adult limpets occur (≤ 15°C). Population genetic analyses showed no differentiation among localities that are &lt; 1350 km apart. The larvae of S. myojinensis most likely migrate to the surface water, where high phytoplankton biomass and strong currents enable their growth and long distance dispersal over many months. SST may represent a critical factor in determining the geographic distribution of many vent endemic species with a planktotrophic early development, and in turn the faunal composition of individual vent sites and regions.

Variations in genes encoding several GABAA receptors have been associated with human drug and alcohol abuse. Among these, a number of human studies have suggested an association between GABRB1, the gene encoding GABAA receptor β1 subunits, with Alcohol dependence (AD), both on its own and comorbid with other substance dependence and psychiatric illnesses. In the present study, we hypothesized that the GABRB1 genetically-associated increased risk for developing alcoholism may be associated with impaired behavioral control and altered sensitivity to reward, as a consequence of altered brain function. Exploiting the IMAGEN database (Schumann et al., 2010), we explored in a human adolescent population whether possession of the minor (T) variant of the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs2044081 is associated with performance of tasks measuring aspects of impulsivity, and reward sensitivity that are implicated in drug and alcohol abuse. Allelic variation did not associate with altered performance in either a stop-signal task (SST), measuring one aspect of impulsivity, or a monetary incentive delay (MID) task assessing reward anticipation. However, increased functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) blood-oxygen-level dependent (BOLD) response in the right hemisphere inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), left hemisphere caudate/insula and left hemisphere inferior temporal gyrus (ITG) during MID performance was higher in the minor (T) allelic group. In contrast, during SST performance, the BOLD response found in the right hemisphere supramarginal gyrus, right hemisphere lingual and left hemisphere inferior parietal gyrus indicated reduced responses in the minor genotype. We suggest that β1-containing GABAA receptors may play a role in excitability of brain regions important in controlling reward-related behavior, which may contribute to susceptibility to addictive behavior.
Somatostatin (SST) exhibits a wide range of physiological functions, including the regulation of tumor cell growth. Octreotide (OCT) is a synthetic analogue of SST that can be used to slow gastrointestinal bleeding, inhibit the release of growth hormone and impede gastrointestinal tumor growth. The aim of the present study was to investigate the molecular mechanism of OCT underlying the inhibition of gastric cancer cell proliferation. Proteins of interest were detected using western blotting, and the zinc finger protein (ZAC)-P300 complex was quantified using co-immunoprecipitation. P300-histone acetyltransferase (P300-HAT) activity was determined spectrophotometrically. The results showed that OCT decreased the phosphorylation of Akt which caused the level of ZAC to increase. In turn, the interaction between ZAC and P300 increased the activity of P300-HAT; ultimately, the phosphorylation of serine 10 in histone H3 (pS10-H3) was decreased and the acetylation of lysine 14 in histone H3 (acK14-H3) was increased. These results suggest that OCT attenuates SGC-7901 cell proliferation by enhancing P300-HAT activity through the interaction of ZAC and P300, causing a reduction in pS10-H3 and an increase in acK14-H3. These findings provide insight for future research on OCT and further demonstrate the potential of OCT to be used as a therapeutic agent for gastric cancer.
The existence of the Sun's hot atmosphere and the solar wind acceleration continues to be an outstanding problem in solar-astrophysics. Although magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) modes and dissipation of magnetic energy contribute to heating and the mass cycle of the solar atmosphere, yet direct evidence of such processes often generates debate. Ground-based 1-m Swedish Solar Telescope (SST)/CRISP, Hα 6562.8 Å observations reveal, for the first time, the ubiquitous presence of high frequency (~12-42 mHz) torsional motions in thin spicular-type structures in the chromosphere. We detect numerous oscillating flux tubes on 10 June 2014 between 07:17 UT to 08:08 UT in a quiet-Sun field-of-view of 60" × 60" (1" = 725 km). Stringent numerical model shows that these observations resemble torsional Alfvén waves associated with high frequency drivers which contain a huge amount of energy (~10(5) W m(-2)) in the chromosphere. Even after partial reflection from the transition region, a significant amount of energy (~10(3) W m(-2)) is transferred onto the overlying corona. We find that oscillating tubes serve as substantial sources of Alfvén wave generation that provide sufficient Poynting flux not only to heat the corona but also to originate the supersonic solar wind.
Antrodia cinnamomea, an endemic basidiomycete used as a health food in Taiwan, is known to synthesize antroquinonols, which were reported to have notable medicinal potential in oncology and immunology. However, the biosynthetic pathway of these compounds is currently unclear. Our previous study showed that a pks63787 knockout mutant of A. cinnamomea (∆pks63787) is deficient in the biosynthesis of several aromatic metabolites. In this study, we pointed by phylogenetic analysis that pks63787 likely encodes an orsellinic acid synthase. Moreover, amendment of the cultural medium with orsellinic acid not only restores the ability of ∆pks63787 to produce its major pigment and other deficient metabolites, e.g., antroquinonols, but also enhances the productivity of several antroquinonols, including two new compounds 2 and 3. These results provide direct evidence that the PKS63787 is involved in the biosynthesis of antroquinonols and confirmed our hypothesis that the 6-methylcyclohexenone moiety was synthesized via the PKS63787-mediated polyketide pathway. In conclusion, PKS63787 might function as orsellinic acid synthase and orsellinic acid is an important precursor indispensable for the biosynthesis of the major pigment and antroquinonols in A. cinnamomea. To facilitate further basic or applied study, a putative biosynthesis pathway map of antroquinonols is proposed.
γ-Aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic inputs are strategically positioned to gate synaptic integration along the dendritic arbor of pyramidal cells. However, their spatiotemporal dynamics during behavior are poorly understood. Using an optical-tagging electrophysiological approach to record and label somatostatin-expressing (Sst) interneurons (GABAergic neurons specialized for dendritic inhibition), we discovered a layer-specific modulation of their activity in behaving mice. Sst interneuron subtypes, residing in different cortical layers and innervating complementary laminar domains, exhibited opposite activity changes during transitions to active wakefulness. The relative weight of vasoactive intestinal peptide-expressing (Vip) interneuron-mediated inhibition of distinct Sst interneurons and cholinergic modulation determined their in vivo activity. These results reveal a state-dependent laminar influence of Sst interneuron-mediated inhibition, with implications for the compartmentalized regulation of dendritic signaling in the mammalian neocortex.
Small airways are the primary site of pathologic changes in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), the major smoking-induced lung disorder.
Based on the concept of proximal-distal patterning that determines regional specialization of the airway epithelium during lung development, we hypothesized that a similar program operates in the adult human lung being altered by smoking leading to decreased regional identity of the small airway epithelium (SAE).
The proximal and distal airway signatures were identified by comparing the transcriptomes of large- and small airway epithelial samples obtained by bronchoscopy from healthy nonsmokers. The expression of these signatures was evaluated in the SAE of healthy and COPD smokers compared to healthy nonsmokers. The capacity of airway basal stem cells (BC) to maintain region-associated phenotypes was evaluated using the air-liquid interface model.
The distal and proximal airway signatures, containing 134 and 233 genes, respectively, were identified. These signatures included known developmental regulators of airway patterning as well as novel regulators such as epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), which was associated with the proximal airway phenotype. In the SAE of smokers with COPD, there was a dramatic smoking-dependent loss of the regional transcriptome identity with concomitant proximalization. This repatterning phenotype was reproduced by stim-ulating SAE BC with EGF, which was up-regulated in the SAE of smokers, during their differ-entiation in vitro.
Smoking-induced global distal-to-proximal reprogramming of the SAE represents a novel pathologic feature of COPD and is mediated by exaggerated EGF/EGFR signaling in SAE BC stem cells.
Tooth development is initiated by epithelial-mesenchymal interactions via basement membrane (BM) and growth factors. In the present study, we found that nephronectin (Npnt), a component of the BM, is highly expressed in the developing tooth. Npnt localizes in the BM on the buccal side of the tooth germ and shows an expression pattern opposite that of the dental epithelial stem cell marker Sox2. To identify the roles of Npnt during tooth development, we performed knockdown and overexpression experiments using ex vivo organ and dental epithelial cell cultures. Our findings showed that loss of Npnt induced ectopic Sox2-positive cells and reduced tooth germ size. Over expression of Npnt showed increased proliferation, whereas the number of Sox2-positive cells was decreased in dental epithelial cells. Npnt contains 5 EGF-like repeat domains, as well as an RGD sequence and MAM domain. We found that the EGF-like repeats are critical for Sox2 expression and cell proliferation. Furthermore, Npnt activated the EGF receptor (EGFR) via the EGF-like repeat domains and induced the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway. Our results indicate that Npnt plays a critical scaffold role in dental epithelial stem cell differentiation and proliferation, and regulates Sox2 expression during tooth development.
Immunocheckpoint inhibitors targeting the programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) and PD-1 ligand 1 (PD-L1) axis have shown promising results in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Recent research has shown that epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling affects PD-L1 expression in NSCLC cells; however, the mechanism regulating PD-L1 expression in tumor cells remains unclear. Using immunohistochemistry, we evaluated the impact of expression of PD-L1 and EGF family receptors EGFR and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) in tumor cells from 91 patients with pathological Stage IA-IIIA NSCLC. Overexpression of PD-L1 was observed in 14% of the resected tumors, and associated with poor recurrence-free survival (p = 0.021) and overall survival (p = 0.033). PD-L1 expression is positively correlated with EGFR expression and inversely correlated with HER2. NSCLC cell lines were treated in vitro with the EGFR ligand EGF with or without inhibition of EGFR or HER2, after which PD-L1 expression was evaluated using flow cytometry. Consistent with previous reports, PD-L1 expression was clearly enhanced by EGF. EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors or EGFR small interfering RNA (siRNA) blocked EGF-induced PD-L1 overexpression in NSCLC cell lines, but HER2 siRNA did not. Moreover, our findings suggest that PD-L1 expression could be partially regulated via the PI3K/AKT and JAK/STAT pathways. We conclude that PD-L1 overexpression is associated with poor prognosis and is positively correlated with EGFR expression but inversely correlated with HER2 expression in NSCLC. We also showed that EGFR and HER2 have different effects on EGF-induced PD-L1 expression in NSCLC cell lines.
In colorectal cancer, gain-of-function mutations in KRas play a critical role in malignant transformation. Tumor growth in colorectal cancer is known to be promoted by the intestinal myofibroblasts (IMFs) that localize adjacent to the cancer cells, but the mechanisms of interaction between KRas-mutated cancer cells and the myofibroblasts remain unclear. Here, we investigated the effects of KRas-mutated cells on the behavior of myofibroblasts by using mouse primary IMFs and cells of an IMF cell line (LmcMF) and a mouse colon epithelial cell line (aMoC1). Conditioned medium (CM) was collected from aMoC1 cells overexpressing a control vector or KRasV12 vector (KRasV12-CM), and the effects of KRasV12-CM on IMFs were analyzed by performing proliferation assays, wound-healing assays, Boyden chamber assays, and western blotting. Whereas KRasV12-CM exerted little effect on the differentiation and proliferation of primary IMFs, the CM promoted migration of both primary IMFs and LmcMF cells. In KRasV12-overexpressing aMoC1 cells, mRNA expression of heparin-binding epidermal growth factor-like growth factor (HB-EGF) was higher than in mock-transfected aMoC1 cells, and HB-EGF promoted the migration of primary IMFs and LmcMF cells. Moreover, KRasV12-CM-induced IMF migration was suppressed by dacomitinib, an inhibitor of HB-EGF receptors. Notably, in LmcMF cells, both KRasV12-CM and HB-EGF activated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and c-jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), whereas KRasV12-CM-induced migration of IMFs was suppressed following treatment with either an ERK inhibitor (FR180204) or a JNK inhibitor (SP600125). These results suggest that HB-EGF secreted from KRas-mutated colorectal cancer cells promotes IMF migration through ERK and JNK activation, which, in turn, could support cancer progression.
We performed an exome-wide association study (EWAS) to identify genetic variants - in particular, low‑frequency or rare variants with a moderate to large effect size - that confer susceptibility to aortic aneurysm with 8,782 Japanese subjects (456 patients with aortic aneurysm, 8,326 control individuals) and with the use of Illumina HumanExome-12 DNA Analysis BeadChip or Infinium Exome-24 BeadChip arrays. The correlation of allele frequencies for 41,432 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that passed quality control to aortic aneurysm was examined with Fisher's exact test. Based on Bonferroni's correction, a P-value of &lt;1.21x10-6 was considered statistically significant. The EWAS revealed 59 SNPs that were significantly associated with aortic aneurysm. None of these SNPs was significantly (P&lt;2.12x10-4) associated with aortic aneurysm by multivariable logistic regression analysis with adjustment for age, gender and hypertension, although 8 SNPs were related (P&lt;0.05) to this condition. Examination of the correlation of these latter 8 SNPs to true or dissecting aortic aneurysm separately showed that rs1465567 [T/C (W229R)] of the EGF-like, fibronectin type III, and laminin G domains gene (EGFLAM) (dominant model; P=0.0014; odds ratio, 1.63) was significantly (P&lt;0.0016) associated with true aortic aneurysm. We next performed EWASs for true or dissecting aortic aneurysm separately and found that 45 and 19 SNPs were significantly associated with these conditions, respectively. Multivariable logistic regression analysis with adjustment for covariates revealed that rs113710653 [C/T (E231K)] of the spermatogenesis- and centriole associated 1-like gene (SPATC1L) (dominant model; P=0.0002; odds ratio, 5.32) and rs143881017 [C/T (R140H)] of the ribonuclease A family member 13 gene (RNASE13) (dominant model; P=0.0006; odds ratio, 5.77) were significantly (P&lt;2.78x10-4 or P&lt;6.58x10-4, respectively) associated with true or dissecting aortic aneurysm, respectively. EGFLAM and SPATC1L may thus be susceptibility loci for true aortic aneurysm and RNASE13 may be such a locus for dissecting aneurysm in Japanese individuals.
Myelin elaborated by oligodendrocytes (OLs) in the central nervous system (CNS) is required for saltatory conduction of action potentials along neuronal axons. We found that TMEFF2, a transmembrane protein with EGF-like and two follistatin-like domains, is selectively expressed in differentiating/myelinating OLs. Previous studies showed that TMEFF2 is capable of binding to PDGFA, which plays important roles in the proliferation, migration and differentiation of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs). However, molecular and genetic analysis revealed that Tmeff2 is a weak binder of PDGFA, and not required for OL differentiation and myelin gene expression in vivo. Together, our data suggested that Tmeff2 is specifically upregulated in OLs, but dispensable for OL differentiation and maturation.
The small molecular weight GTPase Rab7 is a key regulator for late endosomal/lysosomal membrane trafficking, it was known that Rab7 is phosphorylated, but the corresponding kinase and the functional regulation of Rab7 phosphorylation remain unclear. We provide evidence here that Rab7 is a substrate of Src kinase, and is tyrosine-phosphorylated by Src, withY183 residue of Rab7 being the optimal phosphorylation site for Src. Further investigations demonstrated that the tyrosine phosphorylation of Rab7 depends on the guanine nucleotide binding activity of Rab7 and the activity of Src kinase. The tyrosine phosphorylation of Rab7 is physiologically induced by EGF, and impairs the interaction of Rab7 with RILP, consequently inhibiting EGFR degradation and sustaining Akt signaling. These results suggest that the tyrosine phosphorylation of Rab7 may be involved in coordinating membrane trafficking and cell signaling.
Exploring traditional medicines may lead to the development of low-cost and non-toxic cancer preventive agents. Si-Wu-Tang (SWT), comprising the combination of four herbs, Rehmanniae, Angelica, Chuanxiong, and Paeoniae, is one of the most popular traditional Chinese medicines for women's diseases. In our previous studies, the antioxidant Nrf2 pathways were strongly induced by SWT in vitro and in vivo. Since Nrf2 activation has been associated with anticarcinogenic effects, the purpose of this study is to evaluate SWT's activity of cancer prevention. In the Ames test, SWT demonstrated an antimutagenic activity against mutagenicity induced by the chemical carcinogen 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene (DMBA). In JB6 P+ cells, a non-cancerous murine epidermal model for studying tumor promotion, SWT inhibited epidermal growth factor (EGF)-induced neoplastic transformation. The luciferase reporter gene assays demonstrated that SWT suppressed EGF-induced AP-1 and TNF-α-induced NF-κB activation, which are essential factors involved in skin carcinogenesis. In a DMBA-induced skin hyperplasia assay in 'Sensitivity to Carcinogenesis' (SENCAR) mice, both topical and oral SWT inhibited DMBA-induced epidermal hyperplasia, expression of the proliferation marker Proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), and H-ras mutations. These findings demonstrate, for the first time, that SWT prevents tumor promoter and chemical-induced carcinogenesis in vitro and in vivo, partly by inhibiting DNA damage and blocking the activation of AP-1 and NF-κB.
Solid tumors can often be hypoxic in regions, and cancer cells can respond to hypoxia with an increase in proliferation and a decrease in apoptosis, leading to a net increase in viable cell numbers. We have recently found that in an osteosarcoma cell line, hypoxia-induced proliferation depends on arginase II induction. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) has been shown to mediate the hypoxia-induced cellular proliferation in some cancer cell lines. We hypothesized that hypoxia-induced proliferation of HeLa cells would depend on arginase II induction and that this induction of arginase II would occur through EGFR activation. Exposure of HeLa cells to hypoxia resulted in an upregulation of arginase II mRNA and protein levels, with no effect on arginase I expression. Hypoxia also resulted in significantly greater viable cell numbers than did normoxia. The hypoxia-induced increase in viable cell numbers was prevented by either a small molecule inhibitor of arginase or siRNA targeting arginase II Overexpression of arginase II resulted in an increase in viable cell numbers both in normoxia and hypoxia. Hypoxia caused a substantial induction of both epidermal growth factor (EGF) and EGFR Preventing hypoxia-induced EGFR expression using siRNA abolished hypoxia-induced arginase II expression and the increase in viable cell numbers. Treatment with EGF in normoxia not only induced arginase II expression but also resulted in an increase in viable cell numbers. Blocking EGF interactions with EGFR using either an EGF neutralizing antibody or an EGFR antibody prevented the hypoxia-induced increase in viable cell numbers. These results demonstrate an EGF/EGFR/arginase II pathway that is necessary for hypoxic proliferation in HeLa cells.
Antisense oligonucleotide (AON) therapeutics offer new avenues to pursue clinically relevant targets inaccessible with other technologies. Advances in improving AON affinity and stability by incorporation of high affinity nucleotides, such as locked nucleic acids (LNA), have sometimes been stifled by safety liabilities related to their accumulation in the kidney tubule. In an attempt to predict and understand the mechanisms of LNA-AON-induced renal tubular toxicity, we established human cell models that recapitulate in vivo behavior of pre-clinically and clinically unfavorable LNA-AON drug candidates. We identified elevation of extracellular epidermal growth factor (EGF) as a robust and sensitive in vitro biomarker of LNA-AON-induced cytotoxicity in human kidney tubule epithelial cells. We report the time-dependent negative regulation of EGF uptake and EGF receptor (EGFR) signaling by toxic but not innocuous LNA-AONs and revealed the importance of EGFR signaling in LNA-AON-mediated decrease in cellular activity. The robust EGF-based in vitro safety profiling of LNA-AON drug candidates presented here, together with a better understanding of the underlying molecular mechanisms, constitutes a significant step toward developing safer antisense therapeutics.
In an effort to rationalize and optimize an antiapoptotic coating combining chondroitin sulfate (CS) and epidermal growth factor (EGF) for vascular applications, the authors here report the comparison of two grafting strategies aiming to display EGF in an oriented fashion on CS. For that purpose, the authors produced, purified, and characterized a chimeric protein corresponding to EGF that was N-terminally fused to a cysteine and a coil peptide. The chimera was covalently immobilized via its free thiol group or captured via coiled-coil interactions at the surface of a biosensor or on a chondroitin sulfate coating in multiwell plates, mimicking the coating that was previously developed by them for stent-graft surfaces. The interactions of grafted EGF with the soluble domain of its receptor or the impact of grafted EGF upon vascular smooth muscle survival in proapoptotic conditions indicated that the coiled-coil based tethering was the best approach to display EGF. These results, combined to direct enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay measurements, indicated that the coiled-coil tethering approach allowed increasing the amount of bioavailable EGF when compared to covalent coupling, rather than the total amount of grafted EGF, while using much lower concentrations of tagged EGF during incubation.
Purpose The present study evaluated the platelet distribution pattern and growth factor release (VEGF, TGF-β1 and EGF) within three PRF (platelet-rich-fibrin) matrices (PRF, A-PRF and A-PRF+) that were prepared using different relative centrifugation forces (RCF) and centrifugation times. Materials and methods immunohistochemistry was conducted to assess the platelet distribution pattern within three PRF matrices. The growth factor release was measured over 10 days using ELISA. Results The VEGF protein content showed the highest release on day 7; A-PRF+ showed a significantly higher rate than A-PRF and PRF. The accumulated release on day 10 was significantly higher in A-PRF+ compared with A-PRF and PRF. TGF-β1 release in A-PRF and A-PRF+ showed significantly higher values on days 7 and 10 compared with PRF. EGF release revealed a maximum at 24 h in all groups. Toward the end of the study, A-PRF+ demonstrated significantly higher EGF release than PRF. The accumulated growth factor releases of TGF-β1 and EGF on day 10 were significantly higher in A-PRF+ and A-PRF than in PRF. Moreover, platelets were located homogenously throughout the matrix in the A-PRF and A-PRF+ groups, whereas platelets in PRF were primarily observed within the lower portion. ​Discussion the present results show an increase growthfactor release by decreased RCF. However, further studies must be conducted to examine the extent to which enhancing the amount and the rate of released growth factors influence wound healing and biomaterial-based tissue regeneration. ​Conclusion These outcomes accentuate the fact that with a reduction of RCF according to the previously LSCC (described low speed centrifugation concept), growth factor release can be increased in leukocytes and platelets within the solid PRF matrices.
In animal models, the LH surge increases progesterone (P4)/its receptor (PGR), prostaglandins (PTGs), and epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like factors that play essential roles in ovulation. However, little is known about the expression, regulation, and function of these key ovulatory mediators in humans.
To determine when and how these key ovulatory mediators are induced after the luteinizing hormone surge in human ovaries.
Timed periovulatory follicles were obtained from cycling women. Granulosa/lutein cells were collected from in vitro fertilization patients.
The in vivo and in vitro expression of PGR, PTG synthases and transporters, and EGF-like factors was examined at the level of mRNA and protein. PGR binding to specific genes was assessed. P4 and PTGs in conditioned media were measured.
PGR, PTGS2, and AREG expressions dramatically increased in ovulatory follicles at 12-18h after hCG. In human granulosa/lutein cell cultures, hCG increased P4 and PTG production and the expression of PGR, specific PTG synthases and transporters, and EGF-like factors, mimicking in vivo expression patterns. Inhibitors for P4/PGR and EGF-signaling pathways reduced hCG-induced increases in PTG production and the expression of EGF-like factors. PGR bound to the PTGS2, PTGES, and SLCO2A1 gene.
This is the first report demonstrating the time-dependent induction of PGR, AREG, and PTGS2 in human periovulatory follicles. In vitro studies indicated that collaborative actions of P4/PGR and EGF-signaling are required for hCG-induced increases in PTG production and potentiation of EGF-signaling in human periovulatory granulosa cells.
Tissue engineering may become an alternative to current bladder augmentation techniques. Large scaffolds are needed for clinically significant augmentation, but can result in fibrosis and graft shrinkage. The purpose of this study was to investigate the use of multiple scaffolds instead of one large scaffold, to enhance bladder tissue regeneration and bladder capacity. Secondly, acellular collagen, collagen-heparin, and collagen-heparin scaffolds with growth factors were used and the biological activity of the different scaffolds was compared in a large animal model.
Scaffolds were made of bovine type I collagen with or without heparin (Ø = 3.2 cm). Collagen-heparin scaffolds were loaded with growth factors VEGF, FGF2 and HB-EGF. Three identical scaffolds prepared from collagen (COL-group), collagen with heparin (COLHEP-group), or collagen-heparin with growth factors (COLHEPGF-group) were implanted in one porcine bladder. The outcome was compared with sham operated animals (Sham-group), in which no scaffold was used. Urodynamic evaluation was performed prior to surgery and 3 months after bladder reconstruction, together with histological evaluation.
Survival rate was 92%, 12 animals completed the study, 3 of every group, 1 animal developed peritonitis due to urine leakage and was sacrificed. The regenerated area was largest in the COLHEP-group, and least in the COL-group (p=0.002). Histological evaluation revealed a normal urothelial layer and good angiogenesis in all groups, and comparable ingrowth of smooth muscle cells. Urodynamics showed no statistically significant differences in bladder capacity and compliance between groups. Bladder capacity and compliance was very high in this animal model, which made it impossible to study the increase due to augmentation.
Implantation of multiple collagen-heparin scaffolds in one bladder is feasible in a porcine model, resulting in tissue almost indistinguishable from native tissue involving all cell layers of the bladder. Collagen scaffolds with heparin incorporated resulted in a larger area of regenerated tissue. To reach clinically significant augmentation, multiple larger collagen-heparin scaffolds, with or without growth factors, need to be tested to study the largest possible diameter of scaffold and number of used scaffolds still resulting in well vascularized tissue.
We previously reported that single cells from a human colorectal cancer (CRC) cell line (HCA-7) formed either hollow single-layered polarized cysts or solid spiky masses when plated in 3D in type-I collagen. To begin in-depth analyses into whether clonal cysts and spiky masses possessed divergent properties, individual colonies of each morphology were isolated and expanded. The lines thus derived faithfully retained their parental cystic and spiky morphologies and were termed CC (cystic) and SC (spiky), respectively. Although both CC and SC expressed EGF receptor (EGFR), the EGFR-neutralizing monoclonal antibody, cetuximab, strongly inhibited growth of CC, whereas SC was resistant to growth inhibition, and this was coupled to increased tyrosine phosphorylation of MET and RON. Addition of the dual MET/RON tyrosine kinase inhibitor, crizotinib, restored cetuximab sensitivity in SC. To further characterize these two lines, we performed comprehensive genomic and transcriptomic analysis of CC and SC in 3D. One of the most up-regulated genes in CC was the tumor suppressor 15-PGDH/HPGD, and the most up-regulated gene in SC was versican (VCAN) in 3D and xenografts. Analysis of a CRC tissue microarray showed that epithelial, but not stromal, VCAN staining strongly correlated with reduced survival, and combined epithelial VCAN and absent HPGD staining portended a poorer prognosis. Thus, with this 3D system, we have identified a mode of cetuximab resistance and a potential prognostic marker in CRC. As such, this represents a potentially powerful system to identify additional therapeutic strategies and disease-relevant genes in CRC and possibly other solid tumors.
Heteromeric interactions between the catalytically impaired human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER3/ERBB3) and its catalytically active homologs EGFR and HER2 are essential for their signaling. Different ligands can activate these receptor pairs but lead to divergent signaling outcomes through mechanisms that remain largely unknown. We used stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (STORM) with pair-correlation analysis to show that EGF and neuregulin (NRG) can induce different extents of HER3 clustering that are dependent on the nature of the coexpressed HER receptor. We found that the presence of these clusters correlated with distinct patterns and mechanisms of receptor phosphorylation. NRG induction of HER3 phosphorylation depended on the formation of the asymmetric kinase dimer with EGFR in the absence of detectable higher-order oligomers. Upon EGF stimulation, HER3 paralleled previously observed EGFR behavior and formed large clusters within which HER3 was phosphorylated via a noncanonical mechanism. HER3 phosphorylation by HER2 in the presence of NRG proceeded through still another mechanism and involved the formation of clusters within which receptor phosphorylation depended on asymmetric kinase dimerization. Our results demonstrate that the higher-order organization of HER receptors is an essential feature of their ligand-induced behavior and plays an essential role in lateral cross-activation of the receptors. We also show that HER receptor ligands exert unique effects on signaling by modulating this behavior.
A set of high-affinity, high-specificity posttranslational modification (PTM) enrichment tools was developed to generate an unbiased snapshot of four key PTM profiles (tyrosine phosphorylation, acetylation, ubiquitination, and SUMOylation 2/3) for the clinically important protein programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1). The results showed that epidermal growth factor (EGF) treatment induced tyrosine phosphorylation, acetylation, and ubiquitination of PD-L1. Further characterization of EGF-induced PD-L1 ubiquitination revealed a significant increase in mono- and multiubiquitination of PD-L1 that occurred on glycosylated PD-L1. EGF induced mono- and multiubiquitination of PD-L1 preceded EGF-induced increases in PD-L1 protein levels. Chemical inhibitors of the EGFR pathway, gefitnib and SCH772984, suppressed PD-L1 mono- and multiubiquitination, and inhibition of the ubiquitin E1 activating enzyme, with the chemical inhibitor PYR41, was sufficient to block EGF-stimulated increases in PD-L1 protein levels. This study highlights the significance of identifying novel PTMs for PD-L1 and reveals potentially critical regulatory mechanisms that may be valuable therapeutic targets. In a broader context, this report validates an approach whereby one can gain insight into novel mechanisms of action by a simple and unbiased analysis of a PTM profile of potentially any endogenous protein of interest.
NO synthase 2 (NOS2) was recently identified as one the most overexpressed genes in intestinal samples of premature infants with necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC). NOS2 is widely implicated in the processes of epithelial cell injury/apoptosis and host immune defense but its specific role in inflammation of the immature human intestinal mucosa remains unclear. Interestingly, factors that prevent NEC such as epidermal growth factor (EGF) attenuate the inflammatory response in the mid-gestation human small intestine using serum-free organ culture while drugs that are associated with NEC occurrence such as the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, indomethacin (INDO), exert multiple detrimental effects on the immature human intestine. In this study we investigate the potential role of NOS2 in modulating the gut inflammatory response under protective and stressful conditions by determining the expression profile of NOS2 and its downstream pathways in the immature intestine.
Gene expression profiles of cultured mid-gestation human intestinal explants were investigated in the absence or presence of a physiological concentration of EGF (50 ng/ml) or 1 μM INDO for 48 h using Illumina whole genome microarrays, Ingenuity Pathway Analysis software and quantitative PCR to investigate the expression of NOS2 and NOS2-pathway related genes.
In the immature intestine, NOS2 expression was found to be increased by EGF and repressed by INDO. Bioinformatic analysis identified differentially regulated pathways where NOS2 is known to play an important role including citrulline/arginine metabolism, epithelial cell junctions and oxidative stress. At the individual gene level, we identified many differentially expressed genes of the citrulline/arginine metabolism pathway such as ARG1, ARG2, GLS, OAT and OTC in response to EGF and INDO. Gene expression of tight junction components such as CLDN1, CLDN2, CLDN7 and OCN and of antioxidant markers such as DUOX2, GPX2, SOD2 were also found to be differentially modulated by EGF and INDO.
These results suggest that the protective effect of EGF and the deleterious influence of INDO on the immature intestine could be mediated via regulation of NOS2. Pathways downstream of NOS2 involved with these effects include metabolism linked to NO production, epithelial barrier permeability and antioxidant expression. These results suggest that NOS2 is a likely regulator of the inflammatory response in the immature human gut and may provide a mechanistic basis for the protective effect of EGF and the deleterious effects of INDO.
Resveratrol has been shown to have antioxidant and anti-proliferative properties in multiple cancer types. Here we demonstrate that H460 lung cancer cells are more susceptible to resveratrol treatment in comparison to human bronchial epithelial Beas-2B cells. Resveratrol decreases cell viability and proliferation, and induces significant apoptosis in H460 cells. The apoptosis observed was accompanied by an increase in hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production, Bid, PARP and caspase 8 activation, and downregulation of pEGFR, pAkt, c-FLIP and NFkB protein expression. Furthermore, treatment with H2O2 scavenger catalase significantly inhibited resveratrol-induced c-FLIP downregulation, caspase-8 activation and apoptosis. Overexpression of c-FLIP in H460 cells (FLIP cells) resulted in the inhibition of resveratrol-induced H2O2 production, and a significant increase in resveratrol-induced apoptosis in comparison to H460 cells. In FLIP cells, catalase treatment did not rescue cells from a decrease in cell viability and apoptosis induction by resveratrol as compared to H460 cells. Resveratrol treatment also led to VEGF downregulation in FLIP cells. Furthermore, inhibition of pEGFR or pAkt using erlotinib and LY294002 respectively, enhanced the negative effect of resveratrol on FLIP cell viability and apoptosis. The reverse was observed when FLIP cells were supplemented with EGF, or transfected with WT-AKT plasmid; resulting in a 20% decrease in resveratrol-induced apoptosis. In addition, transfection with WT-AKT plasmid resulted in the inhibition of pro-apoptotic protein activation, and c-FLIP and pAkt downregulation. Overall, resveratrol induced apoptosis in H460 lung cancer cells by specifically targeting pAkt and c-FLIP dowregulation by proteasomal degradation in a EGFR-dependent manner.
In clinic, cetuximab, an anti-EGFR antibody, improves treatment outcomes in colorectal cancer (CRC). KRAS-mutant CRC is generally resistant to cetuximab, although difference of the sensitivity among KRAS-mutants has not been studied in detail. We previously developed the cancer tissue-originated spheroid (CTOS) method, a primary culture method for cancer cells. We applied CTOS method to investigate whether ex vivo cetuximab sensitivity assays reflect the difference in sensitivity in the xenografts. Firstly, in vivo cetuximab treatment was performed with xenografts derived from 10 CTOS lines (3 KRAS-wildtype and 7 KRAS mutants). All two CTOS lines which exhibited tumor regression were KRAS-wildtype, meanwhile all KRAS-mutant CTOS lines grew more than the initial size: were resistant to cetuximab according to the clinical evaluation criteria, although the sensitivity was quite diverse. We divided KRAS-mutants into two groups; partially responsive group in which cetuximab had a substantial growth inhibitory effect, and resistant group which exhibited no effect. The ex vivo signaling assay with EGF stimulation revealed that the partially responsive group, but not the resistant group, exhibited suppressed ERK phosphorylation ex vivo. Furthermore, two lines from the partially responsive group, but none of the lines in the resistant group, exhibited a combinatory effect of cetuximab and trametinib, a MEK inhibitor, ex vivo and in vivo. Taken together, the results indicate that ex vivo signaling assay reflects the difference in sensitivity in vivo and stratifies KRAS mutant CTOS lines by sensitivity. Therefore, coupling the in vivo and ex vivo assays with CTOS can be a useful platform for understanding the mechanism of diversity in drug sensitivity.
The authors' previous study demonstrated that the B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia/lymphoma (Bcl-2)-like 11 (BCL2L11) (Bim) deletion polymorphism was associated with poor clinical response to epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with EGFR mutations. The objective of the current study was to investigate the impact of the Bim deletion polymorphism among patients with anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-positive or ROS proto-oncogene 1, receptor tyrosine kinase (ROS1)-positive NSCLC who were treated with crizotinib.
A total of 55 patients with ALK-positive NSCLC and 14 patients with ROS1-positive NSCLC who were treated with crizotinib were enrolled into the current study. The Bim deletion polymorphism was analyzed by polymerase chain reaction. The clinical features of the Bim deletion polymorphism and its impact on the effect of crizotinib were investigated.
The Bim deletion polymorphism was present in 9 of 69 patients with ALK-positive or ROS1-positive NSCLC (13.0%). There were no differences noted with regard to clinicopathological features between patients with and without the Bim deletion polymorphism. Patients with the Bim deletion polymorphism had a significantly shorter progression-free survival (PFS) and lower objective response rate compared with those without (median PFS, 182 days vs 377 days [P = .008]) (objective response rate, 44.4% vs 81.7% [P =.041]) in all populations. The significant difference in PFS was observed in patients with ALK-positive NSCLC (83 days vs 305 days [P =.0304]) compared with those with ROS1-positive NSCLC (218 days vs not reached [P =.082]). Multivariate analysis indicated that the Bim deletion polymorphism was an independent predictive factor for patients with ALK-positive NSCLC who were treated with crizotinib (hazard ratio, 4.786 [P =.006]).
The Bim deletion polymorphism was found to be associated with poor clinical response to crizotinib in patients with ALK fusion-positive NSCLC. Cancer 2017. © 2017 American Cancer Society.
Both hypokalemia and hyperkalemia are associated with disease progression in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). It is unclear whether similar associations are present in the general population. Our aim was to examine the association of plasma potassium with risk of developing CKD and the role of diuretics in this association in a population-based cohort.
We studied 5,130 subjects free of CKD at baseline of the Prevention of Renal and Vascular End-Stage Disease (PREVEND) study, a prospective, population-based cohort of Dutch men and women aged 28-75 years. Hypokalemia was defined as plasma potassium &lt;3.5 mmol/L, and hyperkalemia as plasma potassium ≥5.0 mmol/L. Risk of CKD was defined as de novo development of eGFR &lt;60 ml/min/1.73m2 and/or albuminuria &gt;30 mg/24h.
Mean baseline plasma potassium was 4.4±0.3 mmol/L. The prevalences of hypokalemia and hyperkalemia were 0.5% and 3.8%, respectively; 3.0% of the subjects used diuretics. During a median follow-up of 10.3 years (interquartile range: 6.3-11.4 years), 753 subjects developed CKD. The potassium-CKD association was modified by diuretic use (Pinteraction = 0.02). Both hypokalemia without (HR, 7.74, 95% CI, 3.43-17.48) or with diuretic use (HR, 4.32, 95% CI, 1.77-10.51) were associated with an increased CKD risk as compared to plasma potassium 4.0-4.4 mmol/L without diuretic use. Plasma potassium concentrations ≥3.5 mmol/L were associated with an increased CKD risk among subjects using diuretics (Ptrend = 0.01) but not among subjects not using diuretics (Ptrend = 0.74).
In this population-based cohort, hypokalemia was associated with an increased CKD risk, regardless of diuretic use. In the absence of hypokalemia, plasma potassium was not associated with an increased CKD risk, except among subjects using diuretics.
Height-adjusted total kidney volume (htTKV) is the best marker of disease progression in early autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) when renal function still remains normal. The usefulness of cystatin-C as a biomarker to assess renal function according to renal volume has not been studied in ADPKD patients.
Observational and cross-sectional study of 62 ADPKD patients. htTKV, creatinine and cystatin-C estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) were determined. Correlations between htTKV and eGFR were studied. A control group was used to determine the association between renal function differences and htTKV.
htTKV significantly correlated with cystatin-C-eGFR (r = -0.384, p = 0.002) but not with creatinine-eGFR (r = -0.225, p = 0.078). With htTKV stratified into tertiles, a significant difference of cystatin-C-eGFR but not in creatinine-eGFR was detected in the third tertile when compared with the first tertile group (110.0±22.2 vs 121.3±7.2; p = 0.023 and 101.8±17.2 vs 106.9±15.1; p = 0.327 respectively). When cystatin-C-eGFR of the controls was used as the reference, htTKV above 605 ml/m identified with a 75% sensitivity and 84.9% specificity those patients with a significant worse kidney function. However, this cut-off value could not be identified using creatinine-eGFR.
Cystatin-C-eGFR but not creatinine-eGFR correlated with htTKV in ADPKD patients in early stages of the disease. Differences in cystatin-C-eGFR but not in creatinine-eGFR have been identified through htTKV tertiles. A htTKV above 605 ml/m is associated with a worse renal function only if cystatin-C-eGFR is used. Cystatin-C-eGFR should be studied in prospective studies of early stages of ADPKD to determine its usefulness as an early marker of disease progression.
Analysis of drug-target residence times during drug development can result in improved efficacy, increased therapeutic window, and reduced side effects. Residence time can be estimated as the reciprocal of the dissociation rate ( koff) of an inhibitor from its target. The traditional methods for measuring koff require synthesis of labeled ligands or low-throughput label-free methods. To provide an alternative that is better suited to an automated high-throughput screening (HTS) environment, we adapted a classic "jump dilution" catalytic assay method for determination of koff values for kinase inhibitor drugs. We used the Transcreener ADP(2) Kinase assay as a universal, homogenous method to monitor the recovery of kinase activity as the drugs dissociated from preformed inhibitor-kinase complexes. We measured residence times for several drugs that bind the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), ABL1, and Aurora kinases and found that the rank ordering of inhibitor koff values correlated with literature values determined using ligand binding assays. Moreover, very similar results were obtained using the Transcreener assay with fluorescence polarization (FP), fluorescence intensity (FI), and time-resolved Förster resonance energy transfer (TR-FRET) detection modes. This HTS-compatible, generic assay method should facilitate the use of residence time as a parameter for compound prioritization and optimization early in kinase drug discovery programs.
Imatinib mesylate, a BCR/ABL fusion protein inhibitor, is the first-line treatment against chronic myelogenous leukemia. In spite of its advantageous viewpoints, imatinib still has genuine impediments like undesirable side effects and tumor resistance during chemotherapy. Nanoparticles with sustainable release profile will help in targeted delivery of anticancer drugs while minimizing deleterious side effects and drug resistance. The use of biopolymers like galactoxyloglucan (PST001) for the fabrication of imatinib mesylate nanoparticles could impart its use in overcoming multidrug resistance in chronic myelogenous leukemia patients with minimal side effects. This study involved in the synthesis of PST-Imatinib nanoconjugates with appreciable drug payload and excellent cytotoxicity against drug-resistant chronic myelogenous leukemia cell line (K562) in comparison with free drug. The use of bioinformatics tool revealed better binding affinity for the drug-polysaccharide complex than the drug alone with three proteins: 3QX3 (Topoisomerase), 1M17 (EGFR tyrosine kinase domain), and 3QRJ (ABL1 kinase domain). Assessment of the biochemical, hematological, and histopathological parameters in mice upheld the security and adequacy of the nanoconjugate compared to free drug. Although perspective investigations are warranted, in a condition like drug resistance in leukemia, this nanoconjugate would display a productive approach in cancer therapeutics.
Human cytomegalovirus remains a significant issue for immunocompromised patients and existing viral polymerase targeting therapies are associated with significant toxicity. Accordingly, the viral terminase complex inhibitor, letermovir, is in development. We assessed letermovir pharmacokinetics in renal impairment.
This was a Phase 1, open-label, non-randomised trial. Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) based on the Modification of Diet Renal Disease equation was used to create 3 groups of 8 subjects: healthy function (eGFR ≥90 mL/min/1.73 m(2) ), moderate (30-59 mL/min/1.73 m(2) ) and severe (&lt;30 mL/min/1.73 m(2) ) impairment. Oral letermovir 120 mg was dosed once-daily for 8 days and blood collected for pharmacokinetic analyses.
All 24 subjects enrolled completed the trial. Moderate and severe renal impairment increased mean unbound letermovir fractions by 11% and 26%, respectively, versus healthy subjects. Exposure (AUCτ,ss and Css,max ) was increased with renal impairment (least square mean ratios [90% confidence intervals] total letermovir versus healthy subjects, AUCτ,ss 192% [143-258%] and 142% [83-243%] for moderate and severe impairment, respectively; Css,max 125% [87-182%] and 106% [75-151%], respectively). Clearance was decreased versus healthy subjects. Correlation analyses indicated a correlation between decreasing renal function and increased unbound letermovir concentration (R(2)  = 0.5076, P &lt; 0.0001). Correlations were identified between decreased clearance with both decreased renal function (R(2)  = 0.0662, P = 0.2249 and R(2)  = 0.1861, P = 0.0353 total and unbound clearance, respectively) and increased age (R(2)  = 0.3548, P = 0.0021 and R(2)  = 0.3166, P = 0.0042 total and unbound clearance, respectively). Multiple-dose letermovir 120 mg was well tolerated across groups.
Renal impairment increased exposure to letermovir, although age was a confounding factor.
Discovery of sensitizing mutations in epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and the subsequent development of EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have substantially changed the treatment of lung cancer. First-line treatment with EGFR TKIs (gefitinib, erlotinib and afatinib) has demonstrated a superior response rate and progression-free survival (PFS) compared with chemotherapy in EGFR-mutation positive patients. However, a number of open questions remain, such as choice between the three EGFR TKIs licensed, treatment of patients unsuitable for chemotherapy due to morbidity or advanced age, management of acquired resistance and optimal biological sample to determine EGFR status. Recently the first head-to-head trial comparing gefitinib and afatinib (LUX-Lung 7) has been reported. Moreover, third-generation EGFR TKIs such as osimertinib, rociletinib, olmutinib and ASP8273, with preferential activity against T790M mutant tumours, the commonest resistance mechanism to EGFR TKIs, have shown promising results in early clinical trials, with osimertinib now licensed. In this review, we summarize latest advances in the treatment of EGFR-mutation positive patients focusing on controversial areas and emerging challenges to optimally treat these patients in the future.
Patients with diabetic nephropathy and unprotected left main (LM) coronary artery disease suffer from high cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Although surgical revascularization is currently recommended in this special patient population, the optimal revascularization method for this distinct patient group has remained unclear.
We collected 99 consecutive patients with unprotected LM disease and diabetic nephropathy, including 46 patients who had undergone percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), and 53 who had coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), with a mean age of 72 ± 10; with 80.8% male. Diabetic nephropathy was defined as overt proteinuria (proteinuria &gt; 500 mg/day) and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) by the modified Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) equation of less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m(2). The baseline characteristics, angiographic results and long-term clinical outcomes were retrospectively analyzed.
The baseline characteristic of all patients were similar except for smokers, low density lipoprotein (LDL) level and extension of coronary artery disease involvement. The median follow-up period was 3.8 years. There were 73 patients (74%) considered as high risk with additive European System for Cardiac Operative Risk Evaluation (EuroSCORE) ≥ 6. During follow-up period, the long term rate of all-cause death (PCI vs. CABG: 45.7% vs. 58.5%, p = 0.20) and all-cause death/myocardial infarction (MI)/stroke (PCI vs. CABG: 52.2% vs. 60.4%, p = 0.41) were comparable between the PCI and CABG group, whereas the repeat revascularization rate was significantly higher in the PCI group (PCI vs. CABG: 32.6% vs. 9.4%, p &lt; 0.01). eGFR remained an independent predictor for all-cause death [hazard ratio: 0.97, 95% confidence interval: 0.96 to 0.99; p = 0.002] in multivariate logistic regression.
In the real-world practice of high-risk patients with unprotected LM disease and diabetic nephropathy, we found that PCI was a comparable alternative to CABG in terms of long-term risks of all-cause death/MI/stroke, with significantly higher repeat revascularization rate. Given the small patient number and retrospective nature, our findings should be validated by larger-scale randomized studies.
Worsening renal function during hospitalization for an acute coronary syndrome is strongly predictive of in-hospital and long-term outcome. However, the role of post-discharge worsening renal function has never been investigated in this setting.
We considered the placebo cohort of the AleCardio trial comparing aleglitazar to standard medical therapy among patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and a recent acute coronary syndrome. Patients who had died or had been admitted to hospital for heart failure before the 6-month follow-up, as well as patients without complete renal function data were excluded, leaving 2776 patients for the analysis. Worsening renal function was defined as a &gt;20% reduction in eGFR from discharge to 6-months, or progression to macroalbuminuria. The Cox regression analysis was used to determine the prognostic impact of 6-month renal deterioration on the composite of all-cause death and hospitalization for heart failure.
Worsening renal function occurred in 204 patients (7.34%). At a median follow-up of 2 years the estimated rates of death and hospitalization for heart failure per 100 person-years were 3.45 (95% CI 2.46-6.36) for those with worsening renal function, versus 1.43 (95% CI 1.14-1.79) for patients with stable renal function. At the adjusted analysis worsening renal function was associated with the composite endpoint [hazard ratio (HR) 2.65; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.57-4.49; p&lt;0.001].
Post-discharge worsening renal function is not infrequent among patients with type 2 diabetes and acute coronary syndromes with normal or mildly depressed renal function, and is a strong predictor of adverse cardiovascular events.
Epigallocatechin gallate(EGCG) is a monomer separated from tea catechins, as an well-known antioxidant, which helps fight wrinkles and rejuvenate skin cells. In this study, we investigated the anti-aging effect of EGCG, and to clarify underlying mechanism of skin aging in a D-galactose-induced aging mouse model. Forty-five male mice were divided into 5 groups and treated with different dose of EGCG, Vitamin C (VitC) to mice as a positive control. All groups except vehicle were established aging model induced by D-galactose (200mg/kg/day) that was subcutaneously injected to mice for 8 weeks. Two weeks after injection of D-galactose, EGCG and Vit C groups were simultaneously administered once a day by subcutaneously inject after 5hours for injecting D-galactose. The results show that EGCG can be absorbed by the skin. Overall, the conditions of the skin of EGCG-treatment groups were improved, the whole structure of skin were better than control groups, and the levels of oxidative stress and the expression of relate with EGFR proteins were significantly higher than control group after EGCG treatment. All these findings suggest that EGCG can resist skin senility effectively. And the EGFR with relate of downstream proteins are implicated in the skin aging.
Changes in plasma concentration of small organic metabolites could be due to their altered production or urinary excretion and changes in their urine concentration may be due to the changes in their filtered load, tubular reabsorption, and/or altered urine volume. Therefore, these factors should be considered in interpretation of the changes observed in plasma or urine of the target metabolite(s). Fasting plasma and urine samples from 180 CKD patients and 120 age-matched healthy controls were determined by UPLC-HDMS-metabolomics and quantitative real-time RT-PCR techniques. Compared with healthy controls, patients with CKD showed activation of NF-κB and up-regulation of pro-inflammatory and pro-oxidant mRNA and protein expression as well as down-regulation of Nrf2-associated anti-oxidant gene mRNA and protein expression, accompanied by activated canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling. 124 plasma and 128 urine metabolites were identified and 40 metabolites were significantly altered in both plasma and urine. Plasma concentration and urine excretion of 25 metabolites were distinctly different between CKD and controls. They were related to amino acid, methylamine, purine and lipid metabolisms. Logistic regression identified four plasma and five urine metabolites. Parts of them were good correlated with eGFR or serum creatinine. 5-Methoxytryptophan and homocystine and citrulline were good correlated with both eGFR and creatinine. Clinical factors were incorporated to establish predictive models. The enhanced metabolite model showed 5-methoxytryptophan, homocystine and citrulline have satisfactory accuracy, sensitivity and specificity for predictive CKD. The dysregulation of CKD was related to amino acid, methylamine, purine and lipid metabolisms. 5-methoxytryptophan, homocystine and citrulline could be considered as additional GFR-associated biomarker candidates and for indicating advanced renal injury. CKD caused dysregulation of the plasma and urine metabolome, activation of inflammatory/oxidative pathway and Wnt/β-catenin signaling and suppression of antioxidant pathway.
We report pathologic, functional, and oncologic outcomes in patients treated with radical nephroureterectomy following radical cystectomy.
We identified patients who underwent radical cystectomy then radical nephroureterectomy for metachronous urothelial recurrence at our institution between January 1995 and December 2014. Univariable Cox regression was used to assess the association between overall survival and age, grade, stage, lymph node metastasis, and radiographic findings.
Of the 3173 radical cystectomy patients, 64 underwent subsequent radical nephroureterectomy for metachronous urothelial recurrence. Median age at radical cystectomy was 66 years (IQR 61-74). Of the 64 who underwent radical nephroureterectomy, the median time from radical cystectomy to radical nephroureterectomy was 2.7 years (IQR: 1.4-4.6). Among 37 patients that underwent ureteroscopy prior to radical nephroureterectomy, 29 (78%) had positive biopsy. Radical nephroureterectomy pathology revealed 39% locally advanced disease (pT3/pT4) and 11% positive node status compared with 17% locally advanced disease, and 6% positive node status from radical cystectomy pathology. Post- radical nephroureterectomy eGFR was &lt;60 mL/min/1.73m(2) and &lt;30 mL/min/1.73m(2) for 96% and 40% of patients, respectively. Median overall survival from radical nephroureterectomy was 3.1 years (95% CI: 2.4-4.3). Only lymph node involvement on radical nephroureterectomy was significantly associated with worse overall mortality (HR=2.73, 95% CI 1.04, 7.15, p=0.041).
Prognosis is poor for patients with panurothelial carcinoma treated with nephroureterectomy following cystectomy, with locally advanced disease in a large proportion of patients. Renal function after these procedures diminished and almost all patients were ineligible for cisplatin-based chemotherapy.
We evaluated whether a low high-sensitivity cardiac troponin (hs-cTn) cutoff combined with glucose, red cell distribution width (RDW), and the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) can be used to rule-out a serious cardiac outcome or death in patients presenting with symptoms suggestive of acute coronary syndrome (ACS).
This was a prospective observational emergency department (ED) study enrolling consecutive patients presenting with symptoms suggestive of ACS (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT01994577). The primary outcome was a 7-day composite of myocardial infarction, unstable angina, decompensated congestive heart failure, serious ventricular cardiac arrhythmia, or death. A laboratory score combining glucose, RDW, eGFR with hs-cTnT (Roche) or hs-cTnI (Abbott) was compared to hs-cTn alone using the limit of detection (LoD; hs-cTnT&lt;5ng/l/hs-cTnI&lt;2ng/l) as the cutoff. A benchmark of &gt;99% sensitivity was used to assess the laboratory panel with hs-cTn versus the LoD alone to identify low-risk patients suitable for discharge.
A total of 1095 patients (n=267 composite-outcomes) had measurements of glucose, RDW, eGFR, hs-cTnT, and hs-cTnI at presentation. Applying the hs-cTn LoD alone as the cutoff missed 5 composite-outcomes (sensitivity=98.1%), however the addition of the laboratory panel to the hs-cTn LoD increased the sensitivity to &gt;99% with approximately 10% of the population identified as low-risk. The percentage of low-risk patients was increased to 15% (1 composite-outcome missed) when employing a low measurable hs-cTnI cutoff with the laboratory panel (laboratory score&lt;2 points).
A laboratory score with hs-cTn may identify low-risk patients suitable for ED discharge at presentation.
Detection of molecular aberrations driving the biology and the clinical behavior of advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) allows the adoption of specific therapeutic strategies dramatically impacting disease courses. Among these, ROS1 rearrangements are present in 1-2% of lung adenocarcinomas. Thanks to similarities between ALK and ROS1 oncogenes, lessons inferred from ALK can be applied to ROS1-positive NSCLC; nevertheless, disparities exist between diseases mastered by these two fusion genes. In the absence of more common genetic alterations detected in NSCLC (e.g. EGFR and KRAS mutations, ALK gene fusions), seeking for ROS1 rearrangements is crucial. Dedicated molecular diagnostics should be standardized, hopefully relying upon practical and efficient algorithms, comprehending immunohistochemistry and fluorescence in situ hybridisation. The major clinical impact exerted by crizotinib represents the main reason for which not even a sole ROS1-positive tumor should be undetected. The recent approval of the inhibitor by both American and European health agencies would hopefully boost the widespread testing for ROS1, eventually increasing the absolute number of positive cases, potential further source of information regarding molecular and clinical resistance. In vitro and clinical evidence have already been generated concerning crizotinib resistance and strategies to maintain patients under specific driver-inhibition are being successfully developed. Gathering data concerning diagnostics, preclinical evidence, clinical practice and ongoing studies, the present review depicts the current scenario of ROS1 inhibition in NSCLC.
Two studies indicate the importance of serial biopsies in monitoring patients with non-small cell lung cancer. In one, heterogeneous resistance mechanisms to EGFR-targeted therapy were observed, often varying between biopsies for individual patients. In another, circulating tumor cells detected recurrence 6 months earlier, on average, than conventional imaging.
The purpose of this study was to determine the complex associations among chronic kidney disease (CKD), subclinical brain infarction (SBI), and cognitive impairment.
We used structural equation modeling (SEM) to examine the complex relationships among CKD, SBI, and cognitive function with Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE; global function) and modified Stroop test (executive function) in a population-based cohort of 560 non-demented elderly subjects.
Path analysis based on SEM revealed that the direct paths from estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) to SBI and from SBI to executive function were significant (β = -.10, P = .027, and β = .16, P &lt; .001, respectively). Furthermore, the direct path from eGFR to executive function was also significant (β = -.12, P = .006), indicating that the effects of CKD on executive function are independent of SBI. The direct paths from age and education to global cognitive function were highly significant (β = -.17 and .22, respectively, P &lt; .001), whereas the direct path from eGFR to MMSE was not significant.
Our findings indicate that CKD confers a risk of vascular cognitive impairment or executive dysfunction through mechanisms dependent and independent of SBI. Treating CKD may be a potential strategy to protect against vascular cognitive impairment or executive dysfunction in healthy elderly subjects.
Do genome-wide association study (GWAS) data for endometriosis provide insight into novel biological pathways associated with its pathogenesis?
GWAS analysis uncovered multiple pathways that are statistically enriched for genetic association signals, analysis of Stage A disease highlighted a novel variant in MAP3K4, while top pathways significantly associated with all endometriosis and Stage A disease included several mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)-related pathways.
Endometriosis is a complex disease with an estimated heritability of 50%. To date, GWAS revealed 10 genomic regions associated with endometriosis, explaining &lt;4% of heritability, while half of the heritability is estimated to be due to common risk variants. Pathway analyses combine the evidence of single variants into gene-based measures, leveraging the aggregate effect of variants in genes and uncovering biological pathways involved in disease pathogenesis.
Pathway analysis was conducted utilizing the International Endogene Consortium GWAS data, comprising 3194 surgically confirmed endometriosis cases and 7060 controls of European ancestry with genotype data imputed up to 1000 Genomes Phase three reference panel. GWAS was performed for all endometriosis cases and for Stage A (revised American Fertility Society (rAFS) I/II, n = 1686) and B (rAFS III/IV, n = 1364) cases separately. The identified significant pathways were compared with pathways previously investigated in the literature through candidate association studies.
The most comprehensive biological pathway databases, MSigDB (including BioCarta, KEGG, PID, SA, SIG, ST and GO) and PANTHER were utilized to test for enrichment of genetic variants associated with endometriosis. Statistical enrichment analysis was performed using the MAGENTA (Meta-Analysis Gene-set Enrichment of variaNT Associations) software.
The first genome-wide association analysis for Stage A endometriosis revealed a novel locus, rs144240142 (P = 6.45 × 10-8, OR = 1.71, 95% CI = 1.23-2.37), an intronic single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) within MAP3K4. This SNP was not associated with Stage B disease (P = 0.086). MAP3K4 was also shown to be differentially expressed in eutopic endometrium between Stage A endometriosis cases and controls (P = 3.8 × 10-4), but not with Stage B disease (P = 0.26). A total of 14 pathways enriched with genetic endometriosis associations were identified (false discovery rate (FDR)-P &lt; 0.05). The pathways associated with any endometriosis were Grb2-Sos provides linkage to MAPK signaling for integrins pathway (P = 2.8 × 10-5, FDR-P = 3.0 × 10-3), Wnt signaling (P = 0.026, FDR-P = 0.026) and p130Cas linkage to MAPK signaling for integrins pathway (P = 6.0 × 10-4, FDR-P = 0.029); with Stage A endometriosis: extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1 ERK2 MAPK (P = 5.0 × 10-4, FDR-P = 5.0 × 10-4) and with Stage B endometriosis: two overlapping pathways that related to extracellular matrix biology-Core matrisome (P = 1.4 × 10-3, FDR-P = 0.013) and ECM glycoproteins (P = 1.8 × 10-3, FDR-P = 7.1 × 10-3). Genes arising from endometriosis candidate gene studies performed to date were enriched for Interleukin signaling pathway (P = 2.3 × 10-12), Apoptosis signaling pathway (P = 9.7 × 10-9) and Gonadotropin releasing hormone receptor pathway (P = 1.2 × 10-6); however, these pathways did not feature in the results based on GWAS data.
Not applicable.
The analysis is restricted to (i) variants in/near genes that can be assigned to pathways, excluding intergenic variants; (ii) the gene-based pathway definition as registered in the databases; (iii) women of European ancestry.
The top ranked pathways associated with overall and Stage A endometriosis in particular involve integrin-mediated MAPK activation and intracellular ERK/MAPK acting downstream in the MAPK cascade, both acting in the control of cell division, gene expression, cell movement and survival. Other top enriched pathways in Stage B disease include ECM glycoprotein pathways important for extracellular structure and biochemical support. The results highlight the need for increased efforts to understand the functional role of these pathways in endometriosis pathogenesis, including the investigation of the biological effects of the genetic variants on downstream molecular processes in tissue relevant to endometriosis. Additionally, our results offer further support for the hypothesis of at least partially distinct causal pathophysiology for minimal/mild (rAFS I/II) vs. moderate/severe (rAFS III/IV) endometriosis.

Overexpression and/or activation of P-glycoprotein (P-gp), which mediates efflux transport of various anti-cancer drugs in cancer cells, are associated with multi-drug resistance (MDR). On the other hand, malignant cancer cells frequently undergo epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), thereby acquiring high migratory mobility and invasive ability. Snail is a transcriptional factor that represses multiple other factors, and its overexpression is a trigger of EMT. Since both P-gp and Snail are involved in malignant evolution of cancer, in this work, we evaluated whether or not EMT induced by overexpression of Snail influences P-gp expression and/or activity. Snail-overexpressing cells showed downregulation of epithelial markers, E-cadherin, occludin and claudin-1, and upregulation of mesenchymal markers, vimenin and ZEB1. Although Western blot analysis showed that P-gp expression levels were similar in Mock and Snail-overexpressing cells, the results of P-gp functional assays with P-gp substrates rhodamine123 and paclitaxel indicated that P-gp is activated in Snail-overexpressing cells. Indeed, Snail-overexpressing cells showed greater viability than Mock cells in the presence of paclitaxel. We observed caveolin-1 dephosphorylation and decreased GRB2 expression in Snail-overexpressing cells. These findings suggest a novel pathway leading to cancer MDR, in which Snail induces EMT concomitantly with a decrease of GRB2-mediated caveolin-1 phosphorylation, resulting in activation of P-gp.
Almost all breast tumors express the antiviral protein BST-2 with 67%, 25% and 8.2% containing high, medium or low levels of BST-2, respectively. Breast tumor cells and tissues that contain elevated levels of BST-2 are highly aggressive. Suppression of BST-2 expression reprograms tumorigenic properties of cancer cells and diminishes cancer cell aggressiveness. Using structure/function studies, we report that dimerization of BST-2 through cysteine residues located in the BST-2 extracellular domain (ECD), leads to anoikis resistance and cell survival through proteasome-mediated degradation of BIM-a key proapoptotic factor. Importantly, BST-2 dimerization promotes tumor growth in preclinical breast cancer models in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, we demonstrate that restoration of the ECD cysteine residues is sufficient to rescue cell survival and tumor growth via a previously unreported pathway-BST-2/GRB2/ERK/BIM/Cas3. These findings suggest that disruption of BST-2 dimerization offers a potential therapeutic approach for breast cancer.
Protein tyrosine phosphorylation guides many molecular interactions for cellular functions. SCIMP is a transmembrane adaptor protein (TRAP) family member that mediates selective proinflammatory cytokine responses generated by pathogen-activated Toll-like receptor (TLR) pathways in macrophages. TLR activation triggers SCIMP phosphorylation and selective phosphorylation of distinct tyrosine residues on this adaptor offers the potential for regulating or biasing inflammatory responses. To analyze site-specific phosphorylation events, we developed three probes based on the SH2 domains of known SCIMP effectors, and used them for pull-downs from macrophage extracts. CRISPR-mediated SCIMP-deficient RAW264.7 macrophage-like cells were reconstituted with various phosphorylation-deficient (Y58F, Y96F, Y120F) SCIMPs, and used to demonstrate the specificity of LPS/TLR4-induced, site-specific phosphorylation of SCIMP for the temporal recruitment of the effectors Grb2, Csk and SLP65. Our findings reveal potential for differential SCIMP phosphorylation and specific effectors to influence TLR signaling and inflammatory programs. Furthermore, the use of Csk-SH2 pull-downs to identify additional known and new Csk targets in LPS-activated macrophages reveals the wider utility of our SH2 probes.Immunology and Cell Biology advance online publication, 14 March 2017; doi:10.1038/icb.2017.10.
The gradual emerging of resistance to imatinib urgently calls for the development of new therapy for chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). The fusion protein Bcr-Abl, which promotes the malignant transformation of CML cells, is mainly located in the cytoplasm, while the c-Abl protein which is expressed in the nucleus can induce apoptosis. Based on the hetero-dimerization of FKBP (the 12-kDa FK506- and rapamycin-binding protein) and FRB (the FKBP-rapamycin binding domain of the protein kinase, mTOR) mediated by AP21967, we constructed a nuclear transport system to induce cytoplasmic Bcr-Abl into nuclear. In this study, we reported the construction of the nuclear transport system, and we demonstrated that FN3R (three nuclear localization signals were fused to FRBT2098L with a FLAG tag), HF2S (two FKBP domains were in tandem and fused to the SH2 domain of Grb2 with an HA tag) and Bcr-Abl form a complexus upon AP21967. Bcr-Abl was imported into the nucleus successfully by the nuclear transport system. The nuclear transport system inhibited CML cell proliferation through mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (STAT5) pathways mainly by HF2S. It was proven that nuclear located Bcr-Abl induced CML cell (including imatinib-resistant K562G01 cells) apoptosis by activation of p73 and its downstream molecules. In summary, our study provides a new targeted therapy for the CML patients even with Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor (TKI)-resistance.
Proteins of the Shc family are typically involved in signal transduction events involving Ras/MAPK and PI3K/Akt pathways. In the nervous system, they function proximal to the neurotrophic factors that regulate cell survival, differentiation, and neuron-specific characteristics. The least-characterized homolog, ShcD, is robustly expressed in the developing and mature nervous system, but its contributions to neural cell circuitry are largely uncharted. We now report that ShcD binds to active Ret, TrkA, and TrkB neurotrophic factor receptors predominantly via its phosphotyrosine binding (PTB) domain. However, in contrast to the conventional Shc adaptors, ShcD suppresses distal phosphorylation of the Erk MAPK. Accordingly, genetic knockout of mouse ShcD enhances Erk phosphorylation in the brain. In cultured cells, this capacity is tightly aligned to phosphorylation of ShcD CH1 region tyrosine motifs, which serve as docking platforms for signal transducers such as Grb2. Erk suppression is relieved through independent mutagenesis of the PTB domain and the CH1 tyrosine residues, and successive substitution of these tyrosines breaks the interaction between ShcD and Grb2 thereby promoting TrkB-Grb2 association. Erk phosphorylation can also be restored in the presence of wildtype ShcD through Grb2 overexpression. Conversely, mutation of the ShcD SH2 domain results in enhanced repression of Erk. Although the SH2 domain is a less common binding interface in Shc proteins, we demonstrate that it associates with the Ptpn11 (Shp2) phosphatase, which in turn regulates ShcD tyrosine phosphorylation. We therefore propose a model whereby ShcD competes with neurotrophic receptors for Grb2 binding, and opposes activation of the MAPK cascade.
Chitosan oligosaccharide (COS) has been shown to regulate various cellular and biological functions. Epidermal growth factor (EGF) plays a significant role in tumorigenesis and invasiveness of some cancers. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of COS on EGF-induced cell growth and the further mechanisms. The results demonstrated that COS could inhibit EGF-induced epithelial GE11 cells proliferation in a dose dependent manner. In addition, EGF stimulated the epithelial cells to undergo morphological alteration, exhibiting mesenchymal cells higher metastatic and invasive potential, however, COS could partly suppress aforementioned morphological change. Signal transduction studies indicated COS repressed epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) phosphorylation and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activation, but not Grb2, Ras, and Raf. Taken together, chitosan oligosaccharide inhibited EGF-induced cell growth and migration through blockade of the EGFR/MAPK signal transduction pathway.
Cycle inhibiting factors (Cifs) are virulence proteins secreted by the type III secretion system of some Gram-negative pathogenic bacteria including Burkholderia pseudomallei. Cif is known to function to deamidate Nedd8, leading to inhibition of Cullin E3 ubiquitin ligases (CRL) and consequently induction of cell cycle arrest. Here we show that Cif can function as a potent activator of MAPK/ERK signaling without significant activation of other signaling pathways downstream of receptor tyrosine kinases. Importantly, we found that the ability of Cif to activate ERK is dependent on its deamidase activity, but independent of Cullin E3 ligase inhibition. This suggests that apart from Nedd8, other cellular targets of Cif-dependent deamidation exist. We provide evidence that the mechanism involved in Cif-mediated ERK activation is dependent on recruitment of the Grb2-SOS1 complex to the plasma membrane. Further investigation revealed that Cif appears to modify the phosphorylation status of SOS1 in a region containing the CDC25-H and proline-rich domains. It is known that prolonged Cullin E3 ligase inhibition leads to cellular apoptosis. Therefore, we hypothesize that ERK activation is an important mechanism to counter the pro-apoptotic effects of Cif. Indeed, we show that Cif dependent ERK activation promotes phosphorylation of the proapoptotic protein Bim, thereby potentially conferring a pro-survival signal. In summary, we identified a novel deamidation-dependent mechanism of action of the B. pseudomallei virulence factor Cif/CHBP to activate MAPK/ERK signaling. Our study demonstrates that bacterial proteins such as Cif can serve as useful molecular tools to uncover novel aspects of mammalian signaling pathways.
The scaffolding adapter protein Gab2 (Grb2-associated binder) promotes cell proliferation, survival, and motility by engaging several signaling pathways downstream of growth factor and cytokine receptors. In particular, Gab2 plays essential roles in mast cells, as it is required for phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) activation in response to Kit and the high-affinity IgE receptor. While the positive role of Gab2 in PI3K signaling is well documented, very little is known about the mechanisms that attenuate its function. Here we show that Gab2 becomes phosphorylated on multiple proline-directed sites upon stimulation of the Ras/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling pathway. We demonstrate that ERK1 and ERK2 interact with Gab2 via a novel docking motif, which is required for subsequent Gab2 phosphorylation in response to ERK1/2 activation. We identified four ERK1/2-dependent phosphorylation sites in Gab2 that prevent the recruitment of the p85 regulatory subunit of PI3K. Using bone marrow-derived mast cells to study Gab2-dependent signaling, we found that the inhibition of ERK1/2 activity promotes Akt signaling in response to Kit and the high-affinity IgE receptor. Together, our results indicate that ERK1/2 participates in a negative-feedback loop that attenuates PI3K/Akt signaling in response to various agonists.
Protein-protein interactions mediated by SH2 domains confer specificity in tyrosine kinase pathways. Traditional assays for assessing interactions between an SH2 domain and its interacting protein such as far-Western and pull-down are inherently low throughput. We developed SH2-PLA, an in-solution SH2 domain binding assay, that takes advantage of the speed and sensitivity of proximity ligation and real-time PCR. SH2-PLA allows for rapid assessment of SH2 domain binding to a target protein using only a few microliters of cell lysate, thereby making it an attractive new tool to study tyrosine kinase signaling.
The importance of macroautophagy (hereafter referred to as autophagy) in vascular endothelial cell (VEC) biology and dysfunction is increasingly recognized, but the molecular mechanisms of autophagy in VECs in the presence of serum are still poorly understood. Previously, we identified pterostilbene as a potent autophagy inducer of VECs in the presence of serum. In this study, we used pterostilbene as a tool to induce VEC autophagy and identified the differentially expressed genes using high-throughput DAN microarray. The small GTPase Ras-related protein in brain 13 (Rab13) was found to be the most significantly up-regulated gene in pterostilbene-treated human umbilical VECs (HUVECs). Knockdown of Rab13 blocked pterostilbene-induced mTOR inhibition and autophagy, whereas overexpression of the GTP-containing active form of Rab13 induced mTOR inhibition and autophagy in HUVECs. Using a combination of immunofluorescence and co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) assays, we demonstrated that pterostilbene or up-regulation of the active form of Rab13 promoted the interaction between Rab13 and growth factor receptor-bound protein 2 (Grb2). Knockdown of Grb2 suppressed pterostilbene or up-regulation of the active form of Rab13-induced autophagy. Further mechanistic studies revealed that Rab13 activated the downstream AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and blocked mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling by its functional interaction with Grb2 to regulate autophagy in HUVECs. Our study firmly establishes Rab13 as a novel regulator of autophagy in VECs under nutrient-enriched conditions.
Receptor-PI3K-mTORC1 signaling and fatty acid synthase (FASN)-regulated lipid biosynthesis harbor numerous drug targets and are molecularly connected. We hypothesize that unraveling the mechanisms of pathway cross-talk will be useful for designing novel co-targeting strategies for ovarian cancer (OC). The impact of receptor-PI3K-mTORC1 onto FASN is already well-characterized. However, reverse actions-from FASN towards receptor-PI3K-mTORC1-are still elusive. We show that FASN-blockade impairs receptor-PI3K-mTORC1 signaling at multiple levels. Thin-layer chromatography and MALDI-MS/MS reveals that FASN-inhibitors (C75, G28UCM) augment polyunsaturated fatty acids and diminish signaling lipids diacylglycerol (DAG) and phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3) in OC cells (SKOV3, OVCAR-3, A2780, HOC-7). Western blotting and micropatterning demonstrate that FASN-blockers impair phosphorylation/expression of EGF-receptor/ERBB/HER and decrease GRB2-EGF-receptor recruitment leading to PI3K-AKT suppression. FASN-inhibitors activate stress response-genes HIF-1α-REDD1 (RTP801/DIG2/DDIT4) and AMPKα causing mTORC1- and S6-repression. We conclude that FASN-inhibitor-mediated blockade of receptor-PI3K-mTORC1 occurs due to a number of distinct but cooperating processes. Moreover, decrease of PI3K-mTORC1 abolishes cross-repression of MEK-ERK causing ERK activation. Consequently, the MEK-inhibitor selumetinib/AZD6244, in contrast to the PI3K/mTOR-inhibitor dactolisib/NVP-BEZ235, increases growth inhibition when given together with a FASN-blocker. We are the first to provide deep insight on how FASN-inhibition blocks ERBB-PI3K-mTORC1 activity at multiple molecular levels. Moreover, our data encourage therapeutic approaches using FASN-antagonists together with MEK-ERK-inhibitors.
To investigate the effect of the jianpi-jiedu formula (JPJD) on the expression of angiogenesis-relevant genes in colon cancer.  Methods: Crude extract was obtained from JPJD by water extract method. The effect of JPJD crude extract on colon cancer cell proliferation capacity was determined by MTT assays. The IC50 value was calculated by GraphPad Prism5 software. Affymetrix gene expression profiling chip was used to detect significant differences in expressions of genes after JPJD intervention, and pathway enrichment analysis was performed to analyze the differentially expressed genes. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis software was applied to analyze differentially expressed genes relevant to tumor angiogenesis based on mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway and then the network diagram was built. Western blot was used to verify the protein levels of key genes related to tumor angiogenesis.  Results: JPJD crud extract inhibited the proliferation capacity in colon cancer cells. The IC50 values in 24, 48, and 72 hours after treatment were 13.060, 9.646 and 8.448 mg/mL, respectively. The results of chip showed that 218 genes significantly upgraded, and 252 genes significantly downgraded after JPJD treatment. Most of the genes were related to the function of biosynthesis, metabolism, cell apoptosis, antigen extraction, angiogenesis and so on. There were 12 differentially expressed angiogenesis genes. IPA software analysis showed that the JPJD downregulated expression of sphingomyelin phosphodiesterase 3 (SMPD3), VEGF, vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA), integrin subunit alpha 1 (ITGA1), cathepsin B (CTSB), and cathepsin S (CTSS) genes, while upregulated expressions of GAB2 and plasminogen activator, urokinase receptor (PLAUR) genes in the colorectal cancer cell. Western blot results demonstrated that JPJD obviously downregulated expressions of phospho-mTOR (P-mTOR), signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), hypoxia inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α), and VEGF proteins, while obviously upregulated the level of phospho-P53 (P-P53) protein.  Conclusion: JPJD may inhibit colorectal tumor angiogenesis through regulation of the mTOR-HIF-1α-VEGF signal pathway.

Demyelination of the peripheral nerves and dysfunction of Schwann cells (SCs) are the chronic complications involved in the development of peripheral neuropathy among diabetic patients. Insulin signaling plays an important role in restoring the myelin proteins in diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN). Since insulin levels are altered in diabetes, it becomes of great interest to appreciate the role and regulation of docking and adaptor protein, how these proteins respond to variations in the levels of insulin as experienced in juvenile diabetes. Tyrosine phosphorylation of receptor protein kinases provides a docking site for the activation of adaptor proteins which are the key regulators of insulin signaling pathway. In this report, we studied the long term effect of insulin as a neurotrophic factor and identified the isoform of receptor substrate involved in the propagation of insulin signal in SCs. We also studied the ability of insulin to regulate the expression of different receptor substrates like insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS1), insulin receptor substrate-2 (IRS2) and growth factor receptor-bound protein-2 (GRB2) that propagate the insulin signaling and also their variation in hyperglycemic SCs and sciatic nerve of the diabetic rats. Results confirmed that IRS2 is the key receptor substrate involved in insulin signal transduction. But, a radical increase in the phosphorylation of IRS2 at serine 731 prevents the recruitment of GRB2 adaptor protein which may fail further to connect the Ras and other pathways required to the cell for its survival and to maintain integrity. These findings prove that SCs and sciatic nerve express IRS proteins that are altered by diabetes and thereby insulin signaling downstream is impaired and that contribute to the pathogenesis of DPN.
A growing body of evidence supports the involvement of disturbances in the brain insulin pathway in the pathogenesis of depression. On the other hand, data concerning the impact of antidepressant drug therapy on brain insulin signaling remain scare and insufficient. We determinated the influence of chronic treatment with antidepressant drugs (imipramine, fluoxetine and tianeptine) on the insulin signaling pathway of the brain of adult prenatally stressed rats. 3-month-old prenatally stressed and control rats were treated for 21 days with imipramine, fluoxetine or tianeptine (10mg/kg/day i.p.).The impact of chronic antidepressant administration was examined in forced swim test. In the frontal cortex and hippocampus, the mRNA and protein expression of insulin, insulin receptor, insulin receptor substrates (IRS-1,IRS-2) and adaptor proteins (Shc1, Grb2) before and after drugs administration were measured.Rats exposed prenatally to stressful stimuli displayed depressive-like disturbances, which were attenuated by antidepressant drug administration. We did not reveal the impact of prenatal stress or antidepressant treatment on insulin and the insulin receptor expression in the examined structures. We revealed that diminished insulin receptor phosphorylation evoked by the prenatal stress procedure was attenuated by drugs treatment. We demonstrated that the favorable effect of antidepressans on insulin receptor phosphorylation in the frontal cortex was mainly related with the normalization of serine312 and tyrosine IRS-1 phosphorylation, while in the hippocampus, it was related with the adaptor proteins Shc1/Grb2. It can be suggested that the behavioral effectiveness of antidepressant drug therapy may be related with the beneficial impact of antidepressant on insulin receptor phosphorylation pathways.
Targeted covalent inhibitors of protein-protein interactions differ from reversible inhibitors in that the former bind and covalently bond the target protein at a specific site of the target. The site specificity is the result of the proximity of two reactive groups at the bound state, for example, one mild electrophile in the inhibitor and a natural cysteine in the target close to the ligand binding site. Only a few pharmaceutically relevant proteins have this structural feature. Grb2, a key adaptor protein in maintaining the ERK activity via binding Sos1 to activated RTKs, is one: the N-terminal SH3 domain of Grb2 (Grb2(N-SH3)) carries a unique solvent-accessible cysteine Cys(32) close to its Sos1-binding site. Here we report the design of a peptide-based antagonist (a reactive peptide) that specifically binds to Grb2(N-SH3) and subsequently undergoes a nucleophilic reaction with Cys(32) to form a covalent bond thioether, to block Grb2-Sos1 interaction. Through rounds of optimization, we eventually obtained a dimeric reaction reactive peptide that can form a covalent adduct with endogenous Grb2 protein inside the cytosol of SK-BR-3 human breast cancer cells with pronounced inhibitory effect on cell mobility and viability. This work showcases a rational design of Grb2-targeted site-specific covalent inhibitor and its pronounced anticancer effect by targeting Grb2-Sos1 interaction.
Human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) causes adult T-cell leukemia-lymphoma (ATL) and inflammatory diseases. To enhance cell-to-cell transmission of HTLV-1, the virus increases the number of infected cells in vivo. HTLV-1 bZIP factor (HBZ) is constitutively expressed in HTLV-1 infected cells and ATL cells and promotes T-cell proliferation. However, the detailed mechanism by which it does so remains unknown. Here, we show that HBZ enhances the proliferation of expressing T cells after stimulation via the T-cell receptor. HBZ promotes this proliferation by influencing the expression and function of multiple co-inhibitory receptors. HBZ suppresses the expression of BTLA and LAIR-1 in HBZ expressing T cells and ATL cells. Expression of T cell immunoglobulin and ITIM domain (TIGIT) and Programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) was enhanced, but their suppressive effect on T-cell proliferation was functionally impaired. HBZ inhibits the co-localization of SHP-2 and PD-1 in T cells, thereby leading to impaired inhibition of T-cell proliferation and suppressed dephosphorylation of ZAP-70 and CD3ζ. HBZ does this by interacting with THEMIS, which associates with Grb2 and SHP-2. Thus, HBZ interacts with the SHP containing complex, impedes the suppressive signal from PD-1 and TIGIT, and enhances the proliferation of T cells. Although HBZ was present in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm of T cells, HBZ was localized largely in the nucleus by suppressed expression of THEMIS by shRNA. This indicates that THEMIS is responsible for cytoplasmic localization of HBZ in T cells. Since THEMIS is expressed only in T-lineage cells, HBZ mediated inhibition of the suppressive effects of co-inhibitory receptors accounts for how HTLV-1 induces proliferation only of T cells in vivo. This study reveals that HBZ targets co-inhibitory receptors to cause the proliferation of infected cells.
Grb2 is an adaptor protein that mediates cellular signal transduction. Grb2 contains an SH2 domain that interacts with phosphotyrosine-containing sequences in EGFR and other signaling molecules, and it is a promising molecular target for anticancer agents. To identify novel inhibitors of the Grb2 SH2 domain from natural products and their mirror-image isomers, screening systems using both enantiomers of a synthetic Grb2 SH2 domain protein were established. A pair of synthetic procedures for the proteins were investigated: one employed a single native chemical ligation (NCL) of two segment peptides, and the other used the N-to-C-directed NCL of three segment peptides for easier preparation. Labeling at the N-terminus or the Ala(115) residue of the Grb2 SH2 domain provided functional probes to detect binding to a phosphotyrosine-containing peptide. The resulting synthetic-protein-based probes were applied to bioassays, including chemical array analysis and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays.
The positive and negative selection of lymphocytes by antigen is central to adaptive immunity and self-tolerance, yet how this is determined by different antigens is not completely understood. We found that thymocyte-selection-associated family member 2 (Themis2) increased the positive selection of B1 cells and germinal center B cells by self and foreign antigens. Themis2 lowered the threshold for B-cell activation by low-avidity, but not high-avidity, antigens. Themis2 constitutively bound the adaptor protein Grb2, src-kinase Lyn and signal transducer phospholipase γ2 (PLC-γ2), and increased activation of PLC-γ2 and its downstream pathways following B cell receptor stimulation. Our findings identify a unique function for Themis2 in differential signaling and provide insight into how B cells discriminate between antigens of different quantity and quality.
Kallistatin is a serine proteinase inhibitor and heparin-binding protein. It is considered an endogenous angiogenic inhibitor. In addition, multiple studies demonstrated that kallistatin directly inhibits cancer cell growth. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying these effects remain unclear.
Pull-down, immunoprecipitation, and immunoblotting were used for binding experiments. To elucidate the mechanisms, integrin β3 knockdown (siRNA) or blockage (antibody treatment) on the cell surface of small the cell lung cancer NCI-H446 cell line was used.
Interestingly, kallistatin was capable of binding integrin β3 on the cell surface of NCI-H446 cells. Meanwhile, integrin β3 knockdown or blockage resulted in loss of antitumor activities induced by kallistatin. Furthermore, kallistatin suppressed tyrosine phosphorylation of integrin β3 and its downstream signaling pathways, including FAK/-Src, AKT and Erk/MAPK. Viability, proliferation and migration of NCI-H446 cells were inhibited by kallistatin, with Bcl-2 and Grb2 downregulation, and Bax, cleaved caspase-9 and caspase 3 upregulation.
These findings reveal a novel role for kallistatin in preventing small cell lung cancer growth and mobility, by direct interaction with integrin β3, leading to blockade of the related signaling pathway.
Pelodera strongyloides infestation has rarely been reported in dogs. It is a saprophytic free-living nematode, found in moist decaying organic matter, whose L3 larval stages occasionally can invade the skin of dogs and humans. Larvae penetrate the follicular infundibula causing an erythematous and pruritic dermatitis. The disease is usually diagnosed by deep skin scraping or histopathology, with large numbers of parasites readily identified in hair follicles.
Pelodera strongyloides dermatitis was diagnosed in a six-year-old mixed breed dog presenting with alopecia, erythema and severe pruritus on the ventrum and limbs. The infestation was diagnosed by microscopic examination of plucked hair shafts and confirmed on microscopic examination of skin biopsies collected for histopathology. Only two of 10 deep skin scrapings gave positive findings. The nematode infestation was eradicated following two applications, 2 weeks apart, of a moxidectin/imidacloprid spot-on product.
Skin scrapings are considered the diagnostic test of choice for P. strongyloides infestations. In this case, parasites were identified by hair trichograms more readily than by skin scrapings.
The Escherichia coli holD mutant is poorly viable because the stability of holoenzyme polymerase III (Pol III HE) on DNA is compromised. Consequently, the SOS response is induced and the SOS polymerases DinB and Pol II further hinder replication. Mutations that restore the holD mutant viability belong to two classes, those that stabilize Pol III on DNA and those that prevent the deleterious effects of DinB over-production. We identified a dnaX mutation and the inactivation of rfaP and sspA genes as belonging to the first class of holD mutant suppressors. dnaX encodes a Pol III clamp loader subunit that interacts with HolD. rfaP encodes a lipopolysaccharide kinase that acts in outer membrane biogenesis. Its inactivation improves the holD mutant growth in part by affecting potassium import, previously proposed to stabilize Pol III HE on DNA by increasing electrostatic interactions. sspA encodes a global transcriptional regulator and growth of the holD mutant in its absence suggests that SspA controls genes that affect protein-DNA interactions. The inactivation of rarA belongs to the second class of suppressor mutations. rarA inactivation has a weak effect but is additive with other suppressor mutations. Our results suggest that RarA facilitates DinB binding to abandoned forks. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
Premature infants have an increased risk of osteopenia due to limited bone mass accretion in utero and a greater need for bone nutrients. Until recently, most of efforts to prevent osteopenia of prematurity focused on nutritional changes. Recent studies indicate that passive range of motion exercise of the extremities may lead to beneficial effects on body weight, increased bone mineralization, increased bone formation markers and leptin levels, and attenuation of the natural post-natal decline in bone SOS. These results suggest that exercise may play an important role in the prevention and treatment of osteopenia of prematurity. This review summarizes our current knowledge on the role of exercise in prevention and treatment of osteopenia of prematurity.
Personalized diets based on an individual's genome to optimize the success of dietary intervention and reduce genetic cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk, is one of the challenges most frequently discussed in the scientific community. Areas covered: The authors gathered literature-based evidence on nutritional genomics and CVD phenotypes, our own results and research experience to provide a critical overview of the current situation of using nutritional genomics to tailor diets for CVD prevention and to propose guidelines for future studies and implementations. Expert commentary: Hundreds of studies on gene-diet interactions determining CVD intermediate (plasma lipids, hypertension, etc.) and final phenotypes (stroke, etc.) have furnished top-level scientific evidence for claiming that the genetic effect in cardiovascular risk is not deterministic, but can be modified by diet. However, despite the many results obtained, there are still gaps in practically applying a personalized diet design to specific genotypes. Hence, a better systemization and methodological improvement of new studies is required to obtain top-level evidence that will allow their application in the future precision nutrition/medicine. The authors propose several recommendations for tackling new approaches and applications.
The rise of antimicrobial resistance limits therapeutic options for infections by methicillin-resistant staphylococci. The staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (SCCmec) is a mobile genetic element as the only carrier of the methicillin-resistance determinants, the mecA or mecC gene. The use of antibiotics increases the spread of antibiotic resistance, but the mechanism by which antibiotics promote horizontal dissemination of SCCmec is largely unknown. In this study, we demonstrate that many antibiotics, including β-lactams, can induce the expression of ccrC1 and SCCmec excision from the bacterial chromosome. In particular, three widely used antibiotics targeting DNA replication and repair (sulfamethoxazole, ciprofloxacin and trimethoprim) induced higher levels of ccrC1 expression and higher rates of SCCmec excision even at low concentrations (1/8 × minimum inhibitory concentration). LexA was identified as a repressor of ccrC1 and ccrAB by binding to the promoter regions of ccrC1 and ccrAB. The activation of RecA after antibiotic induction alleviated the repression by LexA and increased the expression of ccrC1 or ccrAB, consequently increasing the excision frequency of the SCCmec for SCCmec transfer. These findings lead us to propose a mechanism by which antimicrobial agents can promote horizontal gene transfer of the mecA gene and facilitate the spread of methicillin resistance.
The design of new biocatalysts is a goal in biotechnology to improve the rate, selectivity and environmental impact of industrial chemical processes. In this regard, the use of computational techniques has provided valuable assistance in the design of new enzymes with remarkable catalytic activity. In this paper, hybrid QM/MM Molecular Dynamics simulations have allowed getting an insight into the origin of the limited efficiency of a computationally designed enzyme for the Kemp elimination; the HG-3. Comparison of results derived from this enzyme with those of a more evolved protein containing additional point mutations, HG-3.17, rendered important information to take into account in order to design new enzymes. For this Kemp eliminase reaction, larger reactivity has been demonstrated to be related with a better electrostatic preorganization of the environment that creates a more favourable electrostatic potential for the reaction to proceed. The limitations of HG-3 can be related with a lack of flexibility, a not well fitted active site, and a lack of protein electrostatic preorganization that decrease the reorganization around the oxyanion hole.
Denosumab has been proven to reduce fracture risk in breast cancer (BC) women under aromatase inhibitors (AIs). Quantitative ultrasound (QUS) provides information on the structure and elastic properties of bone. Our aim was to assess bone health by phalangeal QUS and by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), and to evaluate bone turnover in AIs-treated BC women receiving denosumab.
35 Postmenopausal BC women on AIs were recruited (mean age 61.2 ± 4.5 years) and treated with denosumab 60 mg administered subcutaneously every 6 months. Phalangeal QUS parameters [Amplitude Dependent Speed of Sound (AD-SoS), Ultrasound Bone Profile Index (UBPI), Bone Transmission Time (BTT)] and DXA at lumbar spine and femoral neck were performed. Serum C-telopeptide of type 1 collagen (CTX) and bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BSAP) were also measured. The main outcomes were compared with a control group not receiving denosumab (n = 39).
In patients treated with denosumab, differently from controls, QUS and DXA measurements improved after 24 months, and a reduction of CTX and BSAP was detected at 12 and 24 months in comparison to baseline (P &lt; 0.05). The percent changes (Δ) of QUS measurements were significantly associated with ΔBMD at femoral neck, and ΔCTX and ΔBSAP were associated with ΔBMD at lumbar spine (r = -0.39, P = 0.02; r = -0.49, P = 0.01, respectively).
Denosumab preserves bone health as assessed by phalangeal QUS and DXA. Since inexpensive and radiation-free, phalangeal QUS may be considered in the follow-up of AIs-treated BC women receiving denosumab.
Soil salinity is gradually becoming a threat to the global economy by affecting agricultural productivity worldwide. Here, we analyze the salinity tolerance of Pongamia pinnata with an insight into the underlying physiological and molecular responses. Despite a reduction in net photosynthetic rate, P. pinnata efficiently maintained its leaf water potentials even at 500mM NaCl for 15days and displayed no visible stress symptoms. Na(+) localization analysis using CoroNa-Green AM revealed effective Na(+) sequestration in the roots when compared to leaves. Elemental analysis demonstrated that roots accumulated more of Na(+) while K(+) content was higher in leaves. At the molecular level, salt stress significantly induced the expression levels of salt overly sensitive1 (SOS1), SOS2, SOS3, high affinity K(+) transporter (HKT1), ABA biosynthetic and receptor genes (NCED and PYL4), guaiacol peroxidase (POD) exclusively in roots while tonoplast localized Na(+)/H(+) exchanger (NHX1) was significantly enhanced in leaves. Our results clearly demonstrate that leaves and roots of Pongamia exhibit differential responses under salt stress although roots are more efficient in sequestering the Na(+) ions. The present study provides crucial inputs for understanding salt tolerance in a tree species which can be further utilized for developing salt tolerance in higher plants.
The European Association for Cardiovascular Imaging (EACVI) has outlined the rationale for setting appropriate use criteria (AUC) in cardiovascular (CV) imaging. Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) is the most common imaging modality in CV disease and is a central tool in diagnosis, follow-up, management planning and intervention. The purpose of AUC is to inform referrers, both to avoid under-use, which may result in incomplete or incorrect diagnosis and treatment, and also over-use, which may delay correct diagnosis, lead to 'treatment cascade', and wastes resources. The first step in defining AUC for TTE in the adult has been for a panel of experts in echocardiography to review the evidence, guidelines, recommendations, and position papers from the European Society of Cardiology, EACVI and other specialist societies, and current state-of-the-art clinical practice. The attached document summarizes this work, which will be used to under-pin the development of AUC.
To determine whether early lactate reduction is associated with improved survival and good neurologic outcome in patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.
Ad hoc data analysis of a prospective, multicenter observational study.
Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest patients at 67 emergency hospitals in Kanto, Japan between January 2012 and March 2013.
Adult patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest admitted to the hospital after successful resuscitation were identified.
Blood lactate concentrations were measured at hospital admission and 6 h after hospital admission. Early lactate clearance was defined as the percent change in lactate level 6 h after a baseline measurement.
The 543 patients (mean age, 65 ± 16 yr; 72.6% male) had a mean lactate clearance of 42.4% ± 53.7%. Overall 30-day survival and good neurologic outcome were 47.1% and 27.4%, respectively. The survival proportion increased with increasing lactate clearance (quartile 1, 29.4%; quartile 2, 42.6%; quartile 3, 51.5%; quartile 4, 65.2%; p &lt; 0.001). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that lactate clearance quartile was an independent predictor of the 30-day survival and good neurologic outcome. In the Cox proportional hazards model, the frequency of mortality during 30 days was significantly higher for patients with lactate clearance in quartile 1 (hazard ratio, 3.12; 95% CI, 2.14-4.53), quartile 2 (hazard ratio, 2.13; 95% CI, 1.46-3.11), and quartile 3 (hazard ratio, 1.49; 95% CI, 1.01-2.19) than those with lactate clearance in quartile 4. Furthermore, multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that lactate clearance was a significant predictor of good neurologic outcome at 30 days after hospital admission.
Effective lactate reduction over the first 6 hours of postcardiac arrest care was associated with survival and good neurologic outcome independently of the initial lactate level.
Diagnosing rupture of the radial collateral ligament (RCL) of the finger metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joints is difficult. The aim of this cadaver study was to validate a rotational test for the MCP after RCL transection. With the MCP and proximal interphalangeal joints in flexion, rotation along the axis of the proximal phalanx was applied through an extended distal interphalangeal joint to 36 cadaver fingers. Each finger's pulp described an arc of pronation and supination that was noted on the palm. The test was repeated three times: before transection, after transection of the proper collateral ligament (CL) and after transection of both the proper and accessory CLs. Rotational arcs were measured in pronation and supination. Mean length of the pronation arc after transection of the main RCL was 17.53mm, while it was only 12.41mm before transection for the supination arc. Mean length of the pronation arc after transection of both CLs was 22.83mm compared to only 11.93mm before transection. Our results show a significant difference in pronation stability of the MCP joint after transection of the RCL proper. We can conclude that this rotational stability test is a valid test for diagnosing RCL rupture in MCP joints.
Reduced function persists for many patients after total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Inflammation is part of osteoarthritis' pathophysiology, and surgery induces a marked inflammatory response. We therefore wanted to explore the role of inflammation in long-term recovery after TKA, and thus conducted this secondary analysis of our randomized controlled trial of physical rehabilitation +/- progressive strength training (PST). We aimed to investigate whether A) inflammation is associated with functional performance, knee-extension strength, and knee pain before TKA; B) PST affects inflammation, and the inflammatory state over time; C) baseline or surgery-induced inflammation modifies the effect of rehabilitation +/- PST on change in 6-minute walk test (Δ6MWT); and D) baseline or surgery-induced inflammation is associated with Δ6MWT following TKA.
In the primary trial report's per-protocol analysis, 72/82 patients were included. Sixty had ≥1 blood sample before and after TKA, and were included in this secondary analysis. Inflammation was measured by interferon γ-inducible protein (IP)-10, soluble urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (suPAR), interleukin (IL)-6, IL-10, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α at baseline; day 1, week 4, 8, and 26 after TKA.
At baseline, suPAR (p=0.03) was negatively associated with 6MWT. Neither baseline nor surgery-induced inflammation modified the response to rehabilitation +/- PST. Only surgery-induced IL-10 was associated with Δ6MWT26 weeks-baseline (p=0.001), also adjusted for 6MWTbaseline, age, sex and BMI.
In this secondary analysis, only increased surgery-induced IL-10 response was associated with decreased long-term functional performance after TKA. The importance of controlling the surgery-induced immune response remains to be investigated further.

1,3-Distearoyl-2-oleoylglycerol (SOS) is widely used as a cocoa butter improver and an anti-blooming agent in the chocolate industry. In this study, an effective process was developed to prepare SOS by enzymatic acidolysis. Under optimal reaction conditions (substrate molar ratio of 12, NS40086 loading of 10%, a solvent-free system, 75°C for 4h), a SOS yield of 70.2% was obtained. Subsequently, two-step purification was applied to purify the crude SOS product. Free fatty acids were completely removed after molecular distillation. After acetone fractionation, the purity of SOS reached 92.2% with an 85.1% recovery. Comparison of various physicochemical properties of purified SOS and a commercial cocoa butter improver showed their properties to be similar. This study provides an effective and sustainable process for the synthesis of SOS product, which is expected to be used as a high-quality cocoa butter improver or an anti-blooming agent in the chocolate industry.
Life-threatening toxicity may result from administration of high-dose (HD) interleukin-2 (IL-2). Patients receiving HD IL-2 treatment often experience severe adverse side effects, which result in the interruption of treatment.  .
A standardized order set (SOS) was developed for patients with melanoma or renal cell carcinoma receiving HD IL-2. The aims of the study were to determine compliance of clinicians to the SOS, report the completed doses and major side effects of HD IL-2, and document the satisfaction level of clinicians. .
A retrospective chart review of 40 health records of patients with melanoma or renal cell carcinoma who were treated with HD IL-2 was conducted to determine compliance to the SOS. Staff satisfaction with the SOS was surveyed. .
The SOS was successfully implemented with a provider compliance rate of 90%. Cardiovascular side effects were the most common. Clinicians found the SOS very satisfactory or superior in guiding care and treatment of side effects.
Assessing the presence of pesticides in environmental waters is particularly challenging because of the huge number of substances used which may end up in the environment. Furthermore, the occurrence of pesticide transformation products (TPs) and/or metabolites makes this task even harder. Most studies dealing with the determination of pesticides in water include only a small number of analytes and in many cases no TPs. The present study applied a screening method for the determination of a large number of pesticides and TPs in wastewater (WW) and surface water (SW) from Spain and Italy. Liquid chromatography coupled to high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) was used to screen a database of 450 pesticides and TPs. Detection and identification were based on specific criteria, i.e. mass accuracy, fragmentation, and comparison of retention times when reference standards were available, or a retention time prediction model when standards were not available. Seventeen pesticides and TPs from different classes (fungicides, herbicides and insecticides) were found in WW in Italy and Spain, and twelve in SW. Generally, in both countries more compounds were detected in effluent WW than in influent WW, and in SW than WW. This might be due to the analytical sensitivity in the different matrices, but also to the presence of multiple sources of pollution. HRMS proved a good screening tool to determine a large number of substances in water and identify some priority compounds for further quantitative analysis.
The pathogenesis of sinusoidal obstruction syndrome (SOS) and thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is poorly understood, and limited information is available on global hemostatic function in HSCT. We assessed changes in coagulation and fibrinolysis using a simultaneous thrombin and plasmin generation assay (T/P-GA) during HSCT. Measurements of endogenous thrombin potential (T-EP) and plasmin peak height (P-Peak) using T/P-GA in six pediatric acute leukemia patients treated with HSCT were compared to normal plasma. In the SOS case, the ratios of T-EP and P-Peak to normal were simultaneously decreased at four weeks post-HSCT (Pre; ~1.1/1.1-1.4, Week+4; 0.14/0.0084, respectively). Similarly, in the TMA patient, both ratios were decreased at 3 weeks and recovered after 8 weeks (Pre; 1.2/~0.95, Week+3; 0.59/0.22, Week+8; 1.2/0.64-0.85). In the other patients, when SOS/TMA was not evident, the T/P-GA data remained within normal limits. These findings suggest that the simultaneous reduction of coagulation and fibrinolytic function in patients developing SOS/TMA can lead to a life-threatening coagulopathy. Further research is warranted to clarify global hemostatic function after HSCT to establish optimal supportive therapy for these critical clinical disorders of hemostasis.
Bacteriophage transfer (lysogenic conversion) promotes bacterial virulence evolution. There is limited understanding of the factors that determine lysogenic conversion dynamics within infected hosts. A murine Salmonella Typhimurium (STm) diarrhea model was used to study the transfer of SopEΦ, a prophage from STm SL1344, to STm ATCC14028S. Gut inflammation and enteric disease triggered &gt;55% lysogenic conversion of ATCC14028S within 3 days. Without inflammation, SopEΦ transfer was reduced by up to 10(5)-fold. This was because inflammation (e.g., reactive oxygen species, reactive nitrogen species, hypochlorite) triggers the bacterial SOS response, boosts expression of the phage antirepressor Tum, and thereby promotes free phage production and subsequent transfer. Mucosal vaccination prevented a dense intestinal STm population from inducing inflammation and consequently abolished SopEΦ transfer. Vaccination may be a general strategy for blocking pathogen evolution that requires disease-driven transfer of temperate bacteriophages.
Reduction of bone mineral density and the risk of osteopenia have been reported to occur in phenylketonuria (PKU) patients. This study aimed to evaluate the short-term effects of calcium supplementation in phenylketonuric children and adolescents. The study included 18 patients with PKU aged 5-18 yr (61% male) under clinical and nutritional treatment. Evaluation of food intake, anthropometry, and biochemical and phalangeal quantitative ultrasound were performed before (phase 1) and after (phase 2) calcium supplementation (1000 mg/d) for 34 d. Statistical analysis was performed using t test for paired samples, Wilcoxon's test, and McNemar's test (p &lt;0.05). There was an inadequate intake of phosphorus and vitamin D, the same occurring with serum concentrations of these nutrients. About 50% of the patients had an accumulation of adipose tissue measures, with a negative correlation between Z-score, body mass index, and phalangeal quantitative ultrasound (amplitude-dependent speed of sound [AD-SoS]). There was a significant difference in urinary phosphorus excretion with higher values before supplementation. Comparison of the two phases revealed significantly higher AD-SoS values after the supplementation (p = 0.017). The reduction in phosphorus excretion associated with increased AD-SoS between the two phases suggested increased bone formation, and showed no negative effects in relation to short-term calcium supplementation in children and in adolescents with PKU.
A new D3h-symmetry tris-N-heterocyclic carbene ligand has been prepared and coordinated to iridium and gold. The ligand contains an electron-poor hexaazatriphenylene core; thus, the resulting tris-NHC ligand is a poor electron donor. The tris-Au(i) complex was tested in the hydroamination of terminal alkynes and in the three-component Strecker reaction.
Novel, tumor-selective therapies are needed to increase the survival rate of pancreatic cancer patients. K-Ras-mutant-driven NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1) is over-expressed in pancreatic tumor versus associated normal tissue, while catalase expression is lowered compared to levels in associated normal pancreas tissue. ARQ761 undergoes a robust, futile redox cycle in NQO1+ cancer cells, producing massive hydrogen peroxide (H2 O2 ) levels; normal tissues are spared by low NQO1 and high catalase expression. DNA damage created by ARQ761 in pancreatic cancer cells "hyperactivates" PARP1, causing metabolic catastrophe and NAD ± keresis cell death. NQO1: catalase levels (high in tumor, low in normal tissue) are an attractive therapeutic window to treat pancreatic cancer. Based on a growing body of literature, we are leading a clinical trial to evaluate the combination of ARQ761 and chemotherapy in patients with pancreatic cancer.
Noonan syndrome (NS) is characterized by reduced growth, craniofacial abnormalities, congenital heart defects, and variable cognitive deficits. NS belongs to the RASopathies, genetic conditions linked to mutations in components and regulators of the Ras signaling pathway. Approximately 50% of NS cases are caused by mutations in PTPN11. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying cognitive impairments in NS patients are still poorly understood. Here, we report the generation and characterization of a new conditional mouse strain that expresses the overactive Ptpn11D61Y allele only in the forebrain. Unlike mice with a global expression of this mutation, this strain is viable and without severe systemic phenotype, but shows lower exploratory activity and reduced memory specificity, which is in line with a causal role of disturbed neuronal Ptpn11 signaling in the development of NS-linked cognitive deficits. To explore the underlying mechanisms we investigated the neuronal activity-regulated Ras signaling in brains and neuronal cultures derived from this model. We observed an altered surface expression and trafficking of synaptic glutamate receptors, which are crucial for hippocampal neuronal plasticity. Furthermore, we show that the neuronal activity-induced ERK signaling, as well as the consecutive regulation of gene expression are strongly perturbed. Microarray-based hippocampal gene expression profiling revealed profound differences in the basal state and upon stimulation of neuronal activity. The neuronal activity-dependent gene regulation was strongly attenuated in Ptpn11D61Y neurons. In silico analysis of functional networks revealed changes in the cellular signaling beyond the dysregulation of Ras/MAPK signaling that is nearly exclusively discussed in the context of NS at present. Importantly, changes in PI3K/AKT/mTOR and JAK/STAT signaling were experimentally confirmed. In summary, this study uncovers aberrant neuronal activity-induced signaling and regulation of gene expression in Ptpn11D61Y mice and suggests that these deficits contribute to the pathophysiology of cognitive impairments in NS.
MicroRNA is a class of noncoding RNAs able to base pair with complementary messenger RNA sequences, inhibiting their expression. These regulatory molecules play important roles in key cellular processes including cell proliferation, differentiation and response to DNA damage; changes in miRNA expression are a common feature of human cancers. To gain insights into the mechanisms involved in breast cancer progression we conducted a microRNA global expression analysis on a 21T series of cell lines obtained from the same patient during different stages of breast cancer progression. These stages are represented by cell lines derived from normal epithelial (H16N2), atypical ductal hyperplasia (21PT), primary in situ ductal carcinoma (21NT) and pleural effusion of a lung metastasis (21MT-1 and 21MT-2). In a global microRNA expression analysis, miR-205-5p was the only miRNA to display an important downregulation in the metastatic cell lines (21MT-1; 21MT-2) when compared to the non-invasive cells (21PT and 21NT). The lower amounts of miR-205-5p found also correlated with high histological grades biopsies and with higher invasion rates in a Boyden chamber assay. This work pinpoints miR-205-5p as a potential player in breast tumor invasiveness.
The diverse migratory modes displayed by different cell types are generally believed to be idiosyncratic. Here we show that the migratory behaviour of Dictyostelium was switched from amoeboid to keratocyte-like and oscillatory modes by synthetically decreasing phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate levels or increasing Ras/Rap-related activities. The perturbations at these key nodes of an excitable signal transduction network initiated a causal chain of events: the threshold for network activation was lowered, the speed and range of propagating waves of signal transduction activity increased, actin-driven cellular protrusions expanded and, consequently, the cell migratory mode transitions ensued. Conversely, innately keratocyte-like and oscillatory cells were promptly converted to amoeboid by inhibition of Ras effectors with restoration of directed migration. We use computational analysis to explain how thresholds control cell migration and discuss the architecture of the signal transduction network that gives rise to excitability.
The Mig10/RIAM/Lpd (MRL) adapter protein Lpd regulates actin dynamics through interactions with Scar/WAVE and Ena/VASP proteins to promote the formation of cellular protrusions and to stimulate invasive migration. However, the ability of MRL proteins to interact with multiple actin regulators and to promote serum response factor (SRF) signalling has raised the question of whether MRL proteins employ alternative downstream mechanisms to drive oncogenic processes in a context-dependent manner. Here, using a Drosophila model, we show that overexpression of either human Lpd or its Drosophila orthologue Pico can promote growth and invasion of Ras(V12)-induced cell tumours in the brain. Notably, effects were restricted to two populations of Repo-positive glial cells: an invasive population, characterized by JNK-dependent elevation of Mmp1 expression, and a hyperproliferative population lacking elevated JNK signalling. JNK activation was not triggered by reactive immune cell signalling, implicating the involvement of an intrinsic stress response. The ability to promote dissemination of Ras(V12)-induced tumours was shared by a subset of actin regulators, including, most prominently, Chicadee/Profilin, which directly interacts with Pico, and, Mal, a cofactor for serum response factor that responds to changes in G:F actin dynamics. Suppression of Mal activity partially abrogated the ability of pico to promote invasion of Ras(V12) tumours. Furthermore, we found that larval glia are enriched for serum response factor expression, explaining the apparent sensitivity of glial cells to Pico/Ras(V12) overexpression. Taken together, our findings indicate that MRL proteins cooperate with oncogenic Ras to promote formation of glial tumours, and that, in this context, Mal/serum response factor activation is rate-limiting for tumour dissemination.Oncogene advance online publication, 27 March 2017; doi:10.1038/onc.2017.68.
Inherited genetic variants contribute to risk factors for developing an alcohol use disorder, and polymorphisms may inform precision medicine strategies for treating alcohol addiction. Targeting genetic mutations linked to alcohol phenotypes has provided promising initial evidence for reducing relapse rates in alcoholics. Although successful in some studies, there are conflicting findings and the reports of adverse effects may ultimately limit their clinical utility, suggesting that novel pharmacogenetic targets are necessary to advance precision medicine approaches. Here, we describe promising novel genetic variants derived from preclinical models of alcohol consumption and dependence that may uncover disease mechanisms that drive uncontrolled drinking and identify novel pharmacogenetic targets that facilitate therapeutic intervention for the treatment of alcohol use disorder.
Two Co(I) hydrides containing the tripodal polyphosphine ligand EP3, (κ(4)-EP3)Co(H) [E(CH2CH2PPh2)3; E = N (1), P (2)], have been exploited as ammonia borane (NH3BH3, AB) dehydrogenation catalysts in THF solution at T = 55 °C. The reaction has been analyzed experimentally through multinuclear ((11)B, (31)P{(1)H}, (1)H) NMR and IR spectroscopy, kinetic rate measurements, and kinetic isotope effect (KIE) determination with deuterated AB isotopologues. Both complexes are active in AB dehydrogenation, albeit with different rates and efficiency. While 1 releases 2 equiv of H2 per equivalent of AB in ca. 48 h, with concomitant borazine formation as the final "spent fuel", 2 produces 1 equiv of H2 only per equivalent of AB in the same reaction time, along with long-chain poly(aminoboranes) as insoluble byproducts. A DFT modeling of the first AB dehydrogenation step has been performed, at the M06//6-311++G** level of theory. The combination of the kinetic and computational data reveals that a simultaneous B-H/N-H activation occurs in the presence of 1, after a preliminary AB coordination to the metal center. In 2, no substrate coordination takes place, and the process is better defined as a sequential BH3/NH3 insertion process on the initially formed [Co]-NH2BH3 amidoborane complex. Finally, the reaction of 1 and 2 with NH-acids [AB and Me2NHBH3 (DMAB)] has been followed via VT-FTIR spectroscopy (in the -80 to +50 °C temperature range), with the aim of gaining a deeper experimental understanding of the dihydrogen bonding interactions that are at the origin of the observed H2 evolution.
A new physico-chemical process for TAN (total ammonia nitrogen) removal and disinfection is introduced in saline recirculating aquaculture system (RAS), in which the biofilter is replaced with an integrated electrolysis cell and an activated carbon filter. The electrolysis cell which is based on micro current electrolysis combined with UV-light was self-designed. After the fundamental research, a small pilot scale RAS was operated for 30 days to verify the technical feasibility. The system was stocked by 42 GIFT tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) fish with the rearing density of 13 kg/m(3). During the experiments, the TAN concentration remained below 1.0 mg/L. The nitrite concentration was lower than 0.2 mg/L and the nitrate concentration had increased continuously to 12.79 mg/L at the end. Furthermore, the concentration of residual chlorine in culture ponds remained below 0.3 mg/L, ORP maintained slight fluctuations in the range of 190~240 mV, and pH of the water showed the downtrend. Tilapia weight increased constantly to 339.3 ± 10 g. For disinfection, the active chlorine generated by electrochemical treatment caused Escherichia coli inactivation. Enzyme activity assay indicated that the activity of glutamate dehydrogenase, carbonic anhydrase and glutamic pyruvic transaminase increased within the normal range. The preliminary feasibility was verified by using this physico-chemical technology in the RAS.
The giant dimensions of vestimentiferan Riftia pachyptila (Jones, ) are achieved thanks to the well-developed vascular system. In the vestimentum, there is a complicated net of lacunae, including the brain blood supply and the ventral lacuna underlying the ciliary field. The trunk region has an extensive network of blood vessels feeding the gonads («rete mirabile»). The thick muscular lining of the mesenterial vessels in the trunk and the dorsal vessel in the opisthosome serves as an additional pump, pushing blood into numerous vessels in the segments. It was hypothesized that the blood envelope of the ventral blood vessel in the trunk provides the blood supply to the trophosome. The 3D reconstruction has revealed that there are two vascular systems of the tentacular crown of R. pachyptila. Blood runs into the tentacles via axial afferent vessels, as described earlier only for Riftia, and also via basal ones, as described for other vestimentiferans except Riftia. The basal ones are poorly developed, and the number of lamellar blood vessels is small, indicating a lack of demand for these within huge R. pachyptila. It appears that the presence of these vessels is the preserved ancestral state of Vestimentifera. In different portions of the dorsal vessel, the morphology of the intravasal body varies, depending on function.
The aim of this systematic review was to assess a potential benefit of laser use in the treatment of recurrent aphthous stomatitis (RAS). The primary outcome variables were pain relief, duration of wound healing and reduction in episode frequency. A PICO approach was used as a search strategy in Medline, Embase and Cochrane databases. After scanning and excluding titles, abstracts and full texts, 11 studies (ten RCTs and one non-randomised controlled trial) were included. Study selection and data extraction was done by two observers. Study participants varied between 7-90 for the laser and 5-90 for the control groups. Laser treatment included Nd:YAG laser ablation, CO2 laser applied through a transparent gel (non-ablative) and diode laser in a low-level laser treatment (LLLT) mode. Control groups had placebo, no therapy or topical corticosteroid treatment. Significant pain relief immediately after treatment was found in five out of six studies. Pain relief in the days following treatment was recorded in seven studies. The duration of RAS wound healing was also reduced in five studies. However, criteria of evaluation differed between the studies. The episode frequency was not evaluated as only one study addressed this outcome parameter, but did not discriminate between the study (LLLT) and control (corticosteroid) groups. Jadad scores (ranging from 0 to 5) for quality assessment of the included studies range between 0 and 2 (mean = 1.0) for studies analysing pain relief and between 0 and 3 (mean = 1.1) for studies evaluating wound healing. The use of lasers (CO2 laser, Nd:YAG laser and diode laser) to relieve symptoms and promote healing of RAS is a therapeutic option. More studies for laser applications are necessary to demonstrate superiority over topical pharmaceutical treatment and to recommend a specific laser type, wavelength, power output and applied energy (ablative versus photobiomodulation).
Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is highly variable with 7 genotypes and 67 subtypes characterized to date. HCV genotype (GT) and subtype, and presence of resistance associated substitutions (RASs) represent the key viral determinants for the selection of direct-acting antiviral (DAA) treatment regimens. However, currently available HCV genotyping assays have limitations in differentiating between HCV subtypes and RAS prevalence in different subtypes is largely undefined.
In this study, we compared HCV GT and subtypes with INNO-LiPA 2.0 vs. amplicon sequencing among 8,945 patients from phase II/III clinical trials of DAAs. We also investigated global HCV molecular epidemiology in 12,615 patients. Subtype RAS prevalence was determined by population or deep sequencing, and phylogenetic analyses investigating subtype diversity were performed.
Though there was high concordance between INNO-LiPA and sequencing for GT determination, INNO-LiPA was insufficient for subtype determination for GT2, 3, 4, and 6. Sequencing provided subtype refinement for 42%, 10%, 81%, and 78% of GT2, 3, 4, and 6 patients, respectively. GT discordance (GT2-GT1) was observed in 28 of 950 (3%) GT2 patients, consistent with inter-genotype recombinants. Sequencing-based analyses demonstrated variations in regional subtype prevalence, notably within GT2, 4 and 6. RAS prevalence varied by subtype, with the clinically relevant NS3 RAS Q80K found in GT1a, 5a and 6a and the NS5A RAS Y93H in GT1b, 3a, 4b, 4r and 7.
Together, these analyses provide an understanding of subtyping accuracy and RAS distribution that are crucial for the implementation of global HCV treatment strategies.
The sequencing analyses performed on 12,615 patients with HCV infection investigated three main questions: (1) the concordance between NS5B amplicon sequencing and INNO-LiPA for HCV genotype (GT) determination; (2) the prevalence of HCV subtypes for each genotype around the world; and (3) the prevalence of resistance-associated substitutions (RASs) in different subtypes. Overall, there was high INNO-LiPA and sequencing concordance for GT determination, but subtype determination for GT2, 3, 4, and 6 needed sequencing refinements. Sequencing-based analyses demonstrated variations in regional subtype prevalence for some genotypes, notably within GT2, 4 and 6, and RAS prevalence varied by subtype, with the clinically relevant NS3 RAS Q80K found in GT1a, 5a and 6a and the NS5A RAS Y93H in GT1b, 3a, 4b, 4r and 7.
Moyamoya angiopathy (MMA) is characterised by a progressive stenosis of the terminal part of the internal carotid arteries and the development of abnormal collateral deep vessels. Its pathophysiology is unknown. MMA can be the sole manifestation of the disease (moyamoya disease) or be associated with various conditions (moyamoya syndrome) including some Mendelian diseases. We aimed to investigate the genetic basis of moyamoya using a whole exome sequencing (WES) approach conducted in sporadic cases without any overt symptom suggestive of a known Mendelian moyamoya syndrome.
A WES was performed in four unrelated early-onset moyamoya sporadic cases and their parents (trios). Exome data were analysed under dominant de novo, autosomal recessive and X-linked hypotheses. A panel of 17 additional sporadic cases with early-onset moyamoya was available for mutation recurrence analysis.
We identified two germline de novo mutations in CBL in two out of the four trio probands, two girls presenting with an infancy-onset severe MMA. Both mutations were predicted to alter the ubiquitin ligase activity of the CBL protein that acts as a negative regulator of the RAS pathway. These two germline CBL mutations have previously been described in association with a developmental Noonan-like syndrome and susceptibility to juvenile myelomonocytic leukaemia (JMML). Notably, the two mutated girls never developed JMML and presented only subtle signs of RASopathy that did not lead to evoke this diagnosis during follow-up.
These data suggest that CBL gene screening should be considered in early-onset moyamoya, even in the absence of obvious signs of RASopathy.
We describe four new species of Flabellula, Leptomyxa and Rhizamoeba and publish new SSU rRNA gene and actin gene sequences of leptomyxids. Using these data we provide the most comprehensive SSU phylogeny of leptomyxids to date. Based on the analyses of morphological data and results of the SSU rRNA gene phylogeny we suggest changes in the systematics of the order Leptomyxida (Amoebozoa: Lobosa: Tubulinea). We propose to merge the genera Flabellula and Paraflabellula (the genus Flabellula remains valid by priority rule). The genus Rhizamoeba is evidently polyphyletic in all phylogenetic trees; we suggest retaining the generic name Rhizamoeba for the group unifying R. saxonica, R.matisi n. sp. and R. polyura, the latter remains the type species of the genus Rhizamoeba. Based on molecular and morphological evidence we move all remaining Rhizamoeba species to the genus Leptomyxa. New family Rhizamoebidae is established here in order to avoid paraphyly of the family Leptomyxidae. With the suggested changes both molecular and morphological systems of the order Leptomyxida are now fully congruent to each other.
Norcantharidin (NCTD), a demethylated analog of cantharidin derived from Chinese traditional medicine blister beetle, has been currently used as an anticancer drug for various cancers including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In this study, for a more comprehensive understanding of the targets of NCTD in HCC, next-generation RNA-Seq was utilized. We revealed that the expression of FAM46C, which has been reported as a tumor suppressor for multiple myeloma, was enhanced after NCTD treatment. Re-analysis of TCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas) LIHC (liver hepatocellular carcinoma) dataset demonstrated that FAM46C expression was significantly lower in HCC tissues than in normal liver tissues. NCTD injection or FAM46C overexpression could mitigate diethylnitrosamine (DEN)-initiated HCC in mice. Ectopic expression of FAM46C in two HCC cell lines, SMCC-7721 and SK-Hep-1, significantly repressed cell proliferation, and increased cells population in G2/M phase and cell apoptotic rate. We also found that FAM46C overexpression caused a notable decrease in Ras expression, MEK1/2 phosphorylation and ERK1/2 phosphorylation. More importantly, FAM46C knockdown significantly weakened the biological effects of NCTD on HCC cells, which suggested NCTD exerted the anticancer functions partially through up-regulating FAM46C. In conclusion, FAM46C, a tumor suppressor for HCC, is important for the anti-proliferation and proapoptotic effects of NCTD.
Previous studies have indicated the important roles of ADAMTS5 in intervertebral disc degeneration. However, the mechanisms that regulate ADAMTS5 expression in nuclear pulposus (NP) cells remain largely unknown. Evidence suggests that intergenic transcription may be associated with genes that encode transcriptional regulators. Here, we identified a long intergenic noncoding RNA, linc-ADAMTS5, that was transcribed in the opposite direction of ADAMTS5. In this study, through mining computational algorithm programs, and public available data sets, we identified Ras responsive element binding protein 1 (RREB1) as a crucial transcription factor regulating the expression of ADAMTS5 in NP cells. RNA pull-down, RNA immunoprecipitation, in vitro binding assays, and gain- and loss-of-function studies indicated that a physical interaction between linc-ADAMTS5 and splicing factor proline/glutamine-rich (SFPQ) facilitated the recruitment of RREB1 to binding sites within the ADAMTS5 promoter to induce chromatin remodeling. This resulted in subdued ADAMTS5 levels in cultured NP cells involving histone deacetylases. In clinical NP tissues, linc-ADAMTS5 and RREB1 were correlated negatively with ADAMTS5 expression. Taken together, these results demonstrate that RREB1 cooperates with noncoding RNA linc-ADAMTS5 to inhibit ADAMTS5 expression, thereby affecting degeneration of the extracellular matrix of the intervertebral disc.
The synthesis of conductive gold and copper-gold microstructures with high developed surface based on the method of laser-induced metal deposition from solution was developed. The topology and crystallization phase of these structures were observed by means of scanning electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction, respectively. The electrochemical properties of the synthesized materials were investigated using cyclic voltamperometry and amperometry. According to the obtained results, it was found out that copper-gold microstructures demonstrate a linear dependence of Faraday current vs. concentration from 0.025 to 5µM for D-glucose and from 0.025 to 10µM for hydrogen peroxide. In turn, gold deposit exhibits a linear dependence of Faraday current vs. concentration from 0.025 to 50µM for D-glucose and from 0.025 to 1µM for hydrogen peroxide. Moreover, the synthesized materials reveal low detection limits (0.025µM) with respect to the aforementioned analytes, which is quite promising for their potential application in design and fabrication of new non-enzymatic biosensors.
The proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) is one of the main features of atherosclerosis accelerated by hyperglycemia. Our previous studies found that farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase (FPPS, EC 2.5.1.10), an essential enzyme in the mevalonate pathway, was upregulated in aorta media from diabetic mice along with the process of atherosclerosis. However, the exact role of FPPS in high glucose‑induced proliferation of VSMCs is largely unclear. In our study, we found that alendronate (an FPPS inhibitor) attenuated diabetic accelerated atherosclerosis in vivo and suppressed high glucose‑induced VSMCs proliferation in vitro. Moreover, in aorta from streptozotocin (STZ)‑induced diabetic mice, 16‑week treatment of alendronate decreased the activation of small GTPase (Ras, RhoA, and Rac1), but had no effect on the expression of cystathionine γ‑lyase (CSE), the pivotal H2S‑producing enzyme. Meanwhile, in VSMCs cultured in high glucose‑containing media, alendronate remarkably decreased total CoQ content, increased the H2S level, depressed small GTPases (Ras, RhoA, and Rac1) activation, but yet had no effect on expression of CSE. In conclusion, FPPS inhibition by alendronate attenuated the high glucose‑induced proliferation of VSMCs both in vivo and in vitro, probably though depressing H2S metabolism and suppressing small GTPases (Ras, RhoA, and Rac1) activation.
Previous evidence has suggested that physical microenvironments and mechanical stresses, independent of soluble factors, influence mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) fate. In the present study, simulated microgravity (SMG) was demonstrated to regulate the differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells. This may be a novel strategy for tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. Rat MSCs were cultured for 72 h or 10 days in either normal gravity or a clinostat to model microgravity, followed with culture in diverse differential media. A short period of stimulation (72 h) promoted MSCs to undergo endothelial, neuronal and adipogenic differentiation. In comparison, extended microgravity (10 days) promoted MSCs to differentiate into osteoblasts. A short period of exposure to SMG significantly decreased ras homolog family member A (RhoA) activity. However, RhoA activity significantly increased following prolonged exposure to SMG. When RhoA activity was inhibited, the effects of prolonged exposure to SMG were reversed. These results demonstrated that the duration of SMG regulates the differentiation fate of MSCs via the RhoA‑associated pathway.
We consider a spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ kagome-like chain with competing ferro- and antiferromagnetic anisotropic exchange interactions. The ground state phase diagram of this model consists of the ferromagnetic and ferrimagnetic phases. We study the ground state and the low-temperature properties on the phase boundary between these phases. The ground state on this phase boundary is macroscopically degenerate and consists of localized magnon states. We calculate the ground state degeneracy and corresponding residual entropy. The spontaneous magnetization has a jump on the phase boundary confirming the first-order type of the phase transition. In the limit of a strong anisotropy the spectrum of the low-energy excitations has multi-scale structure governing the peculiar features of the specific heat behavior.
Dedicator of cytokinesis (DOCK) family genes are known as DOCK1-DOCK11 in mammals. DOCK family proteins mainly regulate actin filament polymerization and/or depolymerization and are GEF proteins, which contribute to cellular signaling events by activating small G proteins. Sponge (Spg) is a Drosophila counterpart to mammalian DOCK3/DOCK4, and plays a role in embryonic central nervous system development, R7 photoreceptor cell differentiation, and adult thorax development. In order to conduct further functional analyses on Spg in vivo, we examined its localization in third instar larval wing imaginal discs. Immunostaining with purified anti-Spg IgG revealed that Spg mainly localized in the air sac primordium (ASP) in wing imaginal discs. Spg is therefore predicted to play an important role in the ASP. The specific knockdown of Spg by the breathless-GAL4 driver in tracheal cells induced lethality accompanied with a defect in ASP development and the induction of apoptosis. The monitoring of ERK signaling activity in wing imaginal discs by immunostaining with anti-diphospho-ERK IgG revealed reductions in the ERK signal cascade in Spg knockdown clones. Furthermore, the overexpression of D-raf suppressed defects in survival and the proliferation of cells in the ASP induced by the knockdown of Spg. Collectively, these results indicate that Spg plays a critical role in ASP development and tracheal cell viability that is mediated by the ERK signaling pathway.
The human neurotensin 1 receptor (hNTS1) is a G protein-coupled receptor involved in many physiological functions, including analgesia, hypothermia, and hypotension. To gain a better understanding of which signaling pathways or combination of pathways are linked to NTS1 activation and function, we investigated the ability of activated hNTS1, which was stably expressed by CHO-K1 cells, to directly engage G proteins, activate second messenger cascades and recruit β-arrestins. Using BRET-based biosensors, we found that neurotensin (NT), NT(8-13) and neuromedin N (NN) activated the Gαq-, Gαi1-, GαoA-, and Gα13-protein signaling pathways as well as the recruitment of β-arrestins 1 and 2. Using pharmacological inhibitors, we further demonstrated that all three ligands stimulated the production of inositol phosphate and modulation of cAMP accumulation along with ERK1/2 activation. Interestingly, despite the functional coupling to Gαi1 and GαoA, NT was found to produce higher levels of cAMP in the presence of pertussis toxin, supporting that hNTS1 activation leads to cAMP accumulation in a Gαs-dependent manner. Additionally, we demonstrated that the full activation of ERK1/2 required signaling through both a PTX-sensitive Gi/o-c-Src signaling pathway and PLCβ-DAG-PKC-Raf-1-dependent pathway downstream of Gq. Finally, the whole-cell integrated signatures monitored by the cell-based surface plasmon resonance and changes in the electrical impedance of a confluent cell monolayer led to identical phenotypic responses between the three ligands. The characterization of the hNTS1-mediated cellular signaling network will be helpful to accelerate the validation of potential NTS1 biased ligands with an improved therapeutic/adverse effect profile.
Targeting downstream effectors required for oncogenic Ras signaling is a potential alternative or complement to the development of more direct approaches targeting Ras in the treatment of Ras-dependent cancers. Areas covered: Here we review literature pertaining to the molecular scaffold Kinase Suppressor of Ras (KSR) and its role in promoting signals critical to tumor maintenance. We summarize the phenotypes in knockout models, describe the role of KSR in cancer, and outline the structure and function of the KSR1 and KSR2 proteins. We then focus on the most recent literature that describes the crystal structure of the kinase domain of KSR2 in complex with MEK1, KSR-RAF dimerization particularly in response to RAF inhibition, and novel attempts to target KSR proteins directly. Expert opinion: KSR is a downstream effector of Ras-mediated tumorigenesis that is dispensable for normal growth and development, making it a desirable target for the development of novel therapeutics with a high therapeutic index. Recent advances have revealed that KSR can be functionally inhibited using a small molecule that stabilizes KSR in an inactive conformation. The efficacy and potential for this novel approach to be used clinically in the treatment of Ras-driven cancers is still being investigated.
Following concerns regarding the spread of Zika virus, Joint Services Health Unit (Cyprus) were tasked to carry out a mosquito survey on the Ascension Island, South Atlantic. This was to determine if vectors of the virus such as Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus were introduced and established on the Island.
An extensive survey of residential areas and natural habitats was initiated in order to collect mosquito larvae and adults by methods such as larval sampling, adult trapping and human landing catches.
A. aegypti or A. albopictus were not collected by any of the three methods employed. Culex quinquefasciatus was the only species collected by all three methods. C. quinquefasciatus is a vector of lymphatic filariasis that can easily be transported by human means by air or sea. It is a container breeding species that lives in close proximity to human settlements and can cause significant amount of nuisance.
Ascension Island is connected by air and sea with areas of the world where container breeding species such as A. albopictus and A. aegypti are established, therefore, it is not unlikely that these species become introduced to Ascension in the future. Sound surveillance on Ascension is imperative in order to act as an early warning and rapid response system for invasive mosquito species as well as a guide for the implementation of control measures against C. quinquefasciatus.
The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and its associated pathway is a critical key regulator of CRC development and progression. The monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) cetuximab and panitumumab, directed against EGFR, represent a major step forward in the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC), in terms of progression-free survival and overall survival in several clinical trials. However, the activity of anti-EGFR MoAbs appears to be limited to a subset of patients with mCRC. Studies have highlighted that acquired-resistance to anti-EGFR MoAbs biochemically converge into Ras/Raf/Mek/Erk and PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathways. Recent data also suggest that acquired-resistance to anti-EGFR MoAbs is accompanied by inhibition of EGFR internalization, ubiqutinization, degradation and prolonged downregulation. It is well established that autophagy, a self-cannibalization process, is considered to be associated with resistance to the anti-EGFR MoAbs therapy. Additionally, autophagy induced by anti-EGFR MoAbs acts as a protective response in cancer cells. Thus, inhibition of autophagy after treatment with EGFR MoAbs can result in autophagic cell death. A combination therapy comprising of anti-EGFR MoAbs and autophagy inhibitors would represent a multi-pronged approach that could be evolved into an active therapeutic strategy in mCRC patients.
Transplant patients were excluded from the pivotal phase III trials of checkpoint inhibitors in metastatic melanoma. The efficacy and toxicity profiles of checkpoint inhibitors in this cohort of patients are not well described. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case report of a renal transplant patient with stage IV melanoma treated with a programmed cell death protein 1 checkpoint inhibitor that led to both treatment failure and renal graft rejection.
We present a case of a 58-year-old white man with a long-standing cadaveric renal transplant who was diagnosed with a B-Raf Proto-Oncogene, Serine/Threonine Kinase wild-type metastatic melanoma. He was treated with first-line pembrolizumab but experienced subsequent graft failure and rapid disease progression.
This case highlights the risks associated with the administration of checkpoint inhibitors in patients with a renal transplant and on immunosuppressive therapy. More specifically, it adds to the literature indicating that, compared with the cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 inhibitor ipilimumab, anti-programmed cell death protein 1 agents are more likely to lead to renal graft failure. Additionally, these novel immunotherapeutics may be ineffective in transplant patients; therefore, clinicians should be very aware of those risks and carefully consider selection of agents and full disclosure of the risks to their patients.
We hypothesized that human genes and disease-associated alleles might be systematically functionally annotated using morphological profiling of cDNA constructs, via a microscopy-based Cell Painting assay. Indeed, 50% of the 220 tested genes yielded detectable morphological profiles, which grouped into biologically meaningful gene clusters consistent with known functional annotation (e.g., the RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK cascade). We used novel subpopulation-based visualization methods to interpret the morphological changes for specific clusters. This unbiased morphologic map of gene function revealed TRAF2/c-REL negative regulation of YAP1/WWTR1-responsive pathways. We confirmed this discovery of functional connectivity between the NF-κB pathway and Hippo pathway effectors at the transcriptional level, thereby expanding knowledge of these two signaling pathways that critically regulate tumor initiation and progression. We make the images and raw data publicly available, providing an initial morphological map of major biological pathways for future study.
Increased expression of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and MET proto-oncogene (c-MET) is associated with poor prognosis in various cancer types. Recently, it was reported that the expression of HGF induces resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) targeting epidermal growth factor receptor, human epidermal receptor receptor 2, and b-raf proto-oncogene. Here, we investigated the effects of HGF overexpression in gastric cancer cells in the absence or presence of c-MET TKIs.
The effects of c-MET TKIs in gastric cancer cells with and without c-MET overexpression were determined in gastric cancer cell lines with various cell biology methods.
Compared to the control, cells with induced expression of HGF showed increase in anchorage-independent colony formation (p&lt;0.001). The c-MET TKIs inhibited HGF/c-MET downstream signaling, cell proliferation, migration and invasion, and triggered cell-cycle arrest in Hs746T cells. However, HGF-transfected cells were less affected.
c-MET TKIs had inhibitory effects only on cells overexpressing c-MET. Furthermore, overexpression of HGF resulted in resistance to c-MET TKIs through an autocrine manner in gastric cancer cells.
About 76% of lung adenocarcinoma patients harbor activating mutations in the receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK)/RAS/RAF pathways, leading to aberrant activation of the MAPK pathways particularly the MAPK/ERK pathway. However, many lung adenocarcinomas lacking these genomic mutations also display significant MAPK pathway activation, suggesting that additional MAPK pathway alterations remain undetected. This study has identified serine/threonine kinase mitogen-activated protein 4 kinase 4 (MAP4K4) as a novel positive regulator of MAPK/ERK signaling in lung adenocarcinoma. The results showed that MAP4K4 was drastically elevated in lung adenocarcinoma independently of KRAS or EGFR mutation status. Knockdown of MAP4K4 inhibited proliferation, anchorage-independent growth and migration of lung adenocarcinoma cells, and also abrogated human lung adenocarcinoma xenograft growth and metastasis. Mechanistically, we found that MAP4K4 activated ERK through inhibiting protein phosphatase 2 (PP2A) activity. Our results further showed that downregulation of MAP4K4 prevented ERK reactivation in EGFR inhibitor erlotinib-treated lung adenocarcinoma cells. Together, our findings identify MAP4K4 as a novel MAPK/ERK pathway regulator in lung adenocarcinoma that is required for lung adenocarcinoma maintenance. This article is protected by copyright.

Chemotherapeutic multidrug resistance (MDR) is a significant challenge to overcome in clinic practice. Several mechanisms contribute to MDR, one of which is the augmented drug efflux induced by the upregulation of ABCB1 in cancer cells. Regorafenib, a multikinase inhibitor targeting the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK pathway, was approved by the FDA to treat metastatic colorectal cancer and gastrointestinal stromal tumors. We investigated whether and how regorafenib overcame MDR mediated by ABCB1. The results showed that regorafenib reversed the ABCB1-mediated MDR and increased the accumulation of [(3)H]-paclitaxel in ABCB1-overexpressing cells by suppressing efflux activity of ABCB1, but not altering expression level and localization of ABCB1. Regorafenib inhibited ATPase activity of ABCB1. In mice bearing resistant colorectal tumors, regorafenib raised the intratumoral concentration of paclitaxel and suppressed the growth of resistant colorectal tumors. But regorafenib did not induce cardiotoxicity/myelosuppression of paclitaxel in mice. Strategy to reposition one FDA-approved anticancer drug regorafenib to overcome the resistance of another FDA-approved, widely used chemotherapeutic paclitaxel, may be a promising direction for the field of adjuvant chemotherapy. This study provides clinical rationale for combination of conventional chemotherapy and targeted anticancer agents.
Precision surgery involves improving patient selection to ensure that surgical intervention that is proven to benefit on a population level is the optimal treatment for each individual patient. For patients with colorectal liver metastases (CRLM), existing prognostic scoring systems rely on well-recognised histopathological features such as size and number of lesions. Advances in preoperative imaging algorithms mean that increasingly low volume disease can be detected, improving assessment of these factors. In addition, novel imaging modalities mean that underlying tumour biology and metabolic behaviour during therapy can be assessed. Molecular analysis of tumours can provide crucial prognostic information, with the critical role of RAS/RAF mutations in prognosis well recognised. The optimal source of tissue for this level of analysis is debated, with good concordance between primary and metastatic lesions for some recognised prognostic factors but marked discrepancies for a variety of other relevant mutations. As well as mutational heterogeneity between primary and metastatic lesions, heterogeneity within tumours and dynamic changes in tumour biology over time present a significant challenge in assessing tumour for prognostic biomarkers. Circulating tumour cells offer one potential method of longitudinal tumour analysis, but are limited by current technologies. This review article summarises some of the key advances in prognostication for patients with resectable colorectal liver metastases, as well as highlighting the potential limitations of such an approach.
To investigate whether there is a differential response at rest and following exercise to conditions of genuine high altitude (GHA), normobaric hypoxia (NH), hypobaric hypoxia (HH), and normobaric normoxia (NN).
Markers of sympathoadrenal and adrenocortical function [plasma normetanephrine (PNORMET), metanephrine (PMET), cortisol], myocardial injury [highly sensitive cardiac troponin T (hscTnT)], and function [N-terminal brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP)] were evaluated at rest and with exercise under NN, at 3375 m in the Alps (GHA) and at equivalent simulated altitude under NH and HH. Participants cycled for 2 h [15-min warm-up, 105 min at 55% Wmax (maximal workload)] with venous blood samples taken prior (T0), immediately following (T120) and 2-h post-exercise (T240).
Exercise in the three hypoxic environments produced a similar pattern of response with the only difference between environments being in relation to PNORMET. Exercise in NN only induced a rise in PNORMET and PMET.
Biochemical markers that reflect sympathoadrenal, adrenocortical, and myocardial responses to physiological stress demonstrate significant differences in the response to exercise under conditions of normoxia versus hypoxia, while NH and HH appear to induce broadly similar responses to GHA and may, therefore, be reasonable surrogates.
Hairy cell leukemia (HCL) is a chronic mature B-cell neoplasm with unique clinicopathologic features and an initial exquisite sensitivity to chemotherapy with purine analogs; however, the disease relapses, often repeatedly. The enigmatic pathogenesis of HCL was recently clarified by the discovery of its underlying genetic cause, the BRAF-V600E kinase-activating mutation, which is somatically and clonally present in almost all patients through the entire disease spectrum and clinical course. By aberrantly activating the RAF-MEK-ERK signaling pathway, BRAF-V600E shapes key biologic features of HCL, including its specific expression signature, hairy morphology, and antiapoptotic behavior. Accompanying mutations of the KLF2 transcription factor or the CDKN1B/p27 cell cycle inhibitor are recurrent in 16% of patients with HCL and likely cooperate with BRAF-V600E in HCL pathogenesis. Conversely, BRAF-V600E is absent in other B-cell neoplasms, including mimickers of HCL that require different treatments (eg, HCL-variant and splenic marginal zone lymphoma). Thus, testing for BRAF-V600E allows for a genetics-based differential diagnosis between HCL and HCL-like tumors, even noninvasively in routine blood samples. BRAF-V600E also represents a new therapeutic target. Patients' leukemic cells exposed ex vivo to BRAF inhibitors are spoiled of their HCL identity and then undergo apoptosis. In clinical trials of patients with HCL who have experienced multiple relapses after purine analogs or who are refractory to purine analogs, a short course of the oral BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib produced an almost 100% response rate, including complete remission rates of 35% to 42%, without myelotoxicity. To further improve on these results, it will be important to clarify the mechanisms of incomplete leukemic cell eradication by vemurafenib and to explore chemotherapy-free combinations of a BRAF inhibitor with other targeted agents (eg, a MEK inhibitor and/or an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody).
Protein kinases are central components of signal transduction pathways in the cell. They catalyze the phosphorylation of substrate proteins, resulting in changes of the activity, localization, stability, and protein interactions of the substrates, ultimately coordinating the activity of important cellular processes. CONSTITUTIVE TRIPLE RESPONSE 1 (CTR1) is a Raf-like protein kinase that functions as a negative regulator in the phytohormone ethylene signaling pathway. CTR1 physically interacts with ethylene receptors via its N-terminal domain at the endoplasmic reticulum, and is involved in suppressing ethylene signaling in the absence of ethylene. Recent studies demonstrated that CTR1 directly interacts with and differentially phosphorylates the positive regulator ETHYLENE INSENSITIVE 2 (EIN2), therefore regulating the movement of EIN2 into the nucleus. Here, we describe protocols for determining the kinase activity of CTR1 by calculating the incorporated radiolabeled phosphate [γ-(32)P] from ATP into its physiological substrate, EIN2 protein.
Ethylene receptors are predominantly localized to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane, and coordinate ethylene signal output through protein-protein interactions with each other and additional signaling components. Here, we describe a co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) assay based on the use of the Tandem Affinity Purification (TAP) tag to examine the interactions of ethylene receptors in plant extracts. Human IgG-agarose beads are used to pull down TAP-tagged versions of the protein of interest from detergent extracts of Arabidopsis membranes, and the precipitate then is analyzed immunologically for co-purification of the ethylene receptors. This method has been successfully used to examine interactions of the receptors with each other as well as with the Raf-like kinase CTR1.
Drug repositioning offers a shorter approval process than new drug development. We therefore searched large public datasets of drug-induced gene expression signatures to identify agents that might be effective against hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).
We searched public databases of mRNA expression patterns reported from HCC specimens from patients, HCC cell lines, and cells exposed to various drugs. We identified drugs that might specifically increase expression of genes that are downregulated in HCCs and reduce expression of genes upregulated in HCCs using a non-parametric, rank-based pattern-matching strategy based on the Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic. We evaluated the anti-tumor activity of niclosamide and its ethanolamine salt (NEN) in HCC cell lines (HepG2, Huh7, Hep3B, Hep40, and PLC/PRF/5), primary human hepatocytes, and 2 mouse models of HCC. In 1 model of HCC, liver tumor development was induced by hydrodynamic delivery of a sleeping beauty transposon expressing an activated form of Ras (v12) and truncated beta catenin (N90). In another mouse model, patient-derived xenografts were established by implanting HCC cells from patients into livers of immunocompromised mice. Tumor growth was monitored by bioluminescence imaging. Tumor-bearing mice were fed a regular chow diet or a chow diet containing niclosamide or NEN. In a separate experiment using patient-derived xenografts, tumor-bearing mice were given sorafenib (the standard of care for patients with advanced HCC), NEN, or niclosamide alone; a combination of sorafenib and NEN; or a combination sorafenib and niclosamide in their drinking water, or regular water (control), and tumor growth was monitored.
Based on gene expression signatures, we identified 3 anthelmintics that significantly altered the expression of genes that are up- or down-regulated in HCCs. Niclosamide and NEN specifically reduced the viability of HCC cells: the agents were at least 7-fold more toxic to HCCs than primary hepatocytes. Oral administration of NEN to mice significantly slowed growth of genetically induced liver tumors and patient-derived xenografts, whereas niclosamide did not, coinciding with the observed greater bioavailability of NEN compared with niclosamide. The combination of NEN and sorafenib was more effective at slowing growth of patient-derived xenografts than either agent alone. In HepG2 cells and in patient-derived xenografts, administration of niclosamide or NEN increased expression of 20 genes downregulated in HCC and reduced expression of 29 genes upregulated in the 274-gene HCC signature. Administration of NEN to mice with patient-derived xenografts reduced expression of proteins in the Wnt-beta catenin, STAT3, AKT-mTOR, EGFR-Ras-Raf signaling pathways. Using immunoprecipitation assays, we found NEN to bind cell division cycle 37 (CDC37) protein and disrupt its interaction with heat shock protein 90 (HSP90).
In a bioinformatics search for agents that alter the HCC-specific gene expression pattern, we identified the anthelmintic niclosamide as a potential anti-tumor agent. Its ethanolamine salt, with greater bioavailability, was more effective than niclosamide at slowing the growth of genetically induced liver tumors and patient-derived xenografts in mice. Both agents disrupted interaction between CDC37 and HSP90 in HCC cells, with concomitant inhibition of their downstream signaling pathways. NEN might be effective for treatment of patients with HCC.
The RAF-MAPK signaling pathway regulates several very diverse cellular processes such as proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, and transformation. While the canonical function of RAF kinases within the MAPK pathway is the activation of MEK, our group could demonstrate an important crosstalk between RAF signaling and the pro-apoptotic mammalian sterile 20-like kinase (MST2) tumor suppressor pathway in several cancer entities, including head and neck, colon, and breast. Here, the RAF kinases CRAF and ARAF sequester and inhibit the pro-apoptotic kinase MST2 independently of their own kinase activity. In our recent study, we showed that the ARAF-MST2 complex is regulated by subcellular compartmentalization during epithelial differentiation. Proliferating cells of the basal cell layer in squamous epithelia and tumor cells express ARAF at the mitochondria thus allowing for efficient sequestration of MST2. In contrast, non-malignant squamous epithelia have ARAF localized at the plasma membrane, where the control of MST2-mediated apoptosis is compromised. This re-distribution is regulated by the scaffold protein kinase suppressor of Ras 2 (KSR2). Here, we summarize how spatial and temporal regulation of RAF signaling complexes affect cellular signaling and functions.
A role for iron in carcinogenesis is supported by evidence that iron metabolism proteins are modulated in cancer progression. To date however, the expression of IRP2 (Iron Regulatory Protein-2), which is known to regulate several iron metabolism proteins, has not been assessed in colorectal cancer. Expression of IRP2 was assessed by qRT-PCR and immunohistochemistry in human colorectal cancer tissue. By interrogating The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database, expression of IRP2 and transferrin receptor-1 (TfR1) was assessed relative to common mutations that are known to occur in cancer. The impact of suppressing IRP2 on cellular iron metabolism was also determined by using siRNA and by using the MEK inhibitor trametinib. IRP2 was overexpressed in colorectal cancer compared to normal colonic mucosa and its expression was positively correlated with TfR1 expression. In addition, IRP2 expression was associated with mutations in BRAF. The MEK inhibitor trametinib suppressed IRP2 and this was associated with a suppression in TfR1 and the labile iron pool (LIP). Moreover, EGF stimulation resulted in decreased ferritin expression and an increase in the LIP which were independent of IRP2. Results presented here suggest that ablating IRP2 provides a therapeutic platform for intervening in colorectal tumorigenesis. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
Approximately 28% of patients with gastrointestinal (GI) cancers will receive targeted therapy (TT) because of the associated increases in survival. Only four studies have examined the symptom experience of these patients. To date, no studies have evaluated for differences in symptom occurrence, severity, and distress between patients who received chemotherapy (CTX) alone (n=304) or CTX with TT (n=93).
Patients completed self-report questionnaires, approximately one week after they received CTX. A modified version of the Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale (MSAS) was used to obtain data on symptom occurrence, severity, and distress. Binary logistic regression analyses were used to test for differences in symptom occurrence rates between the two treatment groups. Ordinal logistic regression analyses were used to test for differences in severity and distress ratings between the two treatment groups.
Patients who received CTX with TT were significantly younger (P=0.009); were diagnosed with cancer longer (P=0.004); had a higher number of prior treatments (P=0.024); had metastatic disease, specifically to the liver (P&lt;0.001); had a diagnosis of anal, colon, rectum, or colorectal cancer (CRC) (P&lt;0.001); and were positive for detection of B-Raf proto-oncogene, serine/threonine kinase (BRAF) and Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (KRAS) mutations (both P&lt;0.001). In addition, CTX treatment regimens were significantly different between the two groups (P&lt;0.001). After controlling for significant covariates, patients who received TT reported lower occurrence rates for lack of energy, cough, feeling drowsy, and difficulty sleeping (all, P&lt;0.05). Patients who received TT reported lower severity scores for dry mouth (P=0.034) and change in the way food tastes (P=0.035). However, they reported higher severity scores for "I don't look like myself" (P=0.026). No differences in symptom distress scores were found between the two treatment groups.
This study is the first to evaluate for differences in the symptom experience of GI cancer patients who received CTX alone or CTX with TT using a multidimensional symptom assessment scale. While between group differences in patients' symptom experiences were identified, both treatment groups warrant ongoing assessments to optimally manage their symptoms.
The cytokine-induced SH2-containing protein CIS belongs to the suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS) protein family. Here, we show the critical role of CIS in suppressing natural killer (NK) cell control of tumor initiation and metastasis. Cish-deficient mice were highly resistant to methylcholanthrene-induced sarcoma formation and protected from lung metastasis of B16F10 melanoma and RM-1 prostate carcinoma cells. In contrast, the growth of primary subcutaneous tumors, including those expressing the foreign antigen OVA, was unchanged in Cish-deficient mice. The combination of Cish deficiency and relevant targeted and immuno-therapies such as combined BRAF and MEK inhibitors, immune checkpoint blockade antibodies, IL-2 and type I interferon revealed further improved control of metastasis. The data clearly indicate that targeting CIS promotes NK cell antitumor functions and CIS holds great promise as a novel target in NK cell immunotherapy.
5-isothiocyanato-2-benzofuranyl-2-imidazoline (BU99006) was shown to selectively and irreversibly bind to I2-imidazoline receptors (IRs) in vitro and in vivo, but cell signalling consequences of I2-IR alkylation have not been reported previously. This study assessed by Western blot the effects of BU99006 on nischarin (candidate I1-IR), μ-OR (regulated by nischarin) and associated signalling mediators in the mouse brain. Acute treatment with BU99006 (20 mg/kg, i.p., 1-3 h) led to fast (peak at 1 h) and shortlasting (decline up to 3 h) upregulation of nischarin and μ-OR contents in the hippocampus (less or non-significant effects in cortex) and altered the expression of cytoskeletal β-actin (reduced contents at 3 h). In the same hippocampal samples of BU99006-treated mice, an inhibition of the MAPK species MEK, ERK and JNK was detected at 1 and/or 2 h after drug administration, which was paralleled by enhanced calpain activity (increased contents of p25 and spectrin breakdown products). Correlation analysis indicated the involvement of cdk5/p25 in MEK/ERK inhibition. These neurochemical effects of I2-alkylating BU99006 show a close relation between I1- and I2-IRs expressed in the mouse brain and between these receptors and the μ-OR, accompanied by cytoskeletal alterations and differential effects on multifunctional MAPK and cdk5 signalling pathways.
Spermatogenesis is a continuous and highly coordinated process of spermatozoa production. In mice, this process is believed to initiate shortly after birth with the emergence of nascent spermatogonia in the testes. However, because the nascent spermatogonia originated from the gonocytes are morphologically indistinguishable from their predecessors and there is no clear definition for the gonocytes-to-spermatogonia transition (GST), it remains unclear when and how spermatogenesis is initiated in the mouse testes. To address these questions, we characterized the emergence of nascent spermatogonia in ICR mice. We found that GST is initiated in a subset of gonocytes as early as E18.5. These nascent spermatogonia express markers typical of undifferentiated spermatogonia residing in testes of adult mice. In addition to markers expression, we identified FOXO1 nuclear-to-cytoplasmic translocation as a novel feature of GST distinguishing nascent spermatogonia from the gonocytes. Using those criteria, we demonstrated that GST requires FGF signaling. When FGF signaling was inhibited pharmacologically, gonocytes retained nuclear FOXO1 expression, did not express spermatogonial markers and failed to proliferate. We found that FGF signaling acts upstream of GDNF and RA signalings for the activation of the MEK/ERK and PI3K/Akt pathways in germ cells during GST. Taken together, we defined the precise timing of GST and revealed FGF signaling as a master regulator of GST in the perinatal mouse testes.
L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia (LID) represents one of the major problems of the long-term therapy of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). Although, the pathophysiologic mechanisms underlying LID are not completely understood, activation of the extracellular signal regulated kinase (ERK) is recognized to play a key role. ERK is phosphorylated by mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK), and thus MEK inhibitor can prevent ERK activation. Here the effect of the MEK inhibitor PD98059 on LID and the associated molecular changes were examined. Rats with unilateral 6-OHDA lesions of the nigrostriatal pathway received daily L-DOPA treatment for 3 weeks, and abnormal involuntary movements (AIMs) were assessed every other day. PD98059 was injected in the lateral ventricle daily for 12 days starting from day 10 of L-DOPA treatment. Striatal molecular markers of LID were analyzed together with gene regulation using microarray. The administration of PD98059 significantly reduced AIMs. In addition, ERK activation and other associated molecular changes including ΔFosB were reversed in rats treated with the MEK inhibitor. PD98059 induced significant up-regulation of 418 transcripts and down-regulation of 378 transcripts in the striatum. Tyrosine hydroxylase (Th) and aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator (Arnt) genes were down-regulated in lesioned animals and up-regulated in L-DOPA-treated animals. Analysis of protein levels showed that PD98059 reduced the striatal TH. These results support the association of p-ERK1/2, ΔFosB, p-H3 to the regulation of TH and ARNT in the mechanisms of LID, and pinpoint other gene regulatory changes, thus providing clues for identifying new targets for LID therapy.
Endometrial cancer is the most common, and second most lethal, gynecological malignancy, and its rates of incidence and death are growing. This is likely attributable to increased numbers of high-risk type II endometrial cancers which account for ~30% of cases but ~75% of deaths due to their aggressive and metastatic behaviour. Histopathological and in vitro functional studies suggest that aberrant TGFβ1 signaling may contribute to endometrial cancer development and the acquisition of invasive/metastatic characteristics. However, little is known about the cellular and molecular mechanisms of TGFβ1 in high-risk endometrial cancers. In the present study, we examined the roles and mechanisms of TGFβ1 on cell adhesion and motility in type II endometrial cancer cell lines, KLE and HEC-1B. We show that treatment with TGFβ1 increases cell adhesion to vitronectin and transwell cell migration. We also demonstrate that TGFβ1 treatment increases integrin β3 and αv mRNA and protein levels via SMAD-independent MEK-ERK1/2 signaling. Importantly, siRNA depletion or antibody-mediated blocking of integrin αvβ3 reversed the effects of TGFβ1 on cell adhesion and migration. Our results suggest that TGFβ1-MEK-ERK1/2-integrin αvβ3 signaling could contribute to the invasive behaviour of high-risk endometrial cancer by promoting cell adhesion and migration.
Mucosal melanoma of the head and neck is a very rare and aggressive malignancy with a very poor prognosis. The nasal cavity, paranasal sinuses, and oral cavity are the most common locations. One-, 3- and 5-year survival rates between 2000 and 2007 were 63%, 30% and 20%, respectively. Cigarette smoking seems to be a risk factor even though the evidence for this is very low. Clinical signs and symptoms are usually nonspecific. While surgery is considered the mainstay of treatment for most mucosal melanomas of the head and neck region, radiotherapy has a role in local control of the disease after surgery. Many new treatment options in the last years, in particular targeted therapies (i.e. inhibitors of c-KIT, NRAS/MEK or BRAF) and immunotherapies (anti CTLA-4 and anti PD-1/PD-L1 antibodies), have changed the history of cutaneous melanoma. Despite the different biology, mucosal melanoma is currently treated in the same way as cutaneous melanoma; however, patients with mucosal melanoma were excluded from the majority of recent clinical trials. Recent molecular findings offer new hope for the development of more effective systemic therapy.
Coronary artery remodelling and vasospasm is a complication of acute myocardial ischemia and reperfusion. The underlying mechanisms are complex, but the vasoconstrictor peptide endothelin-1 is suggested to have an important role. This study aimed to determine whether the expression of endothelin-1 and its receptors are regulated in the myocardium and in coronary arteries after experimental ischemia-reperfusion. Furthermore, we evaluated whether treatment with a specific MEK1/2 inhibitor, U0126, modified the expression and function of these proteins.
Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into three groups: sham-operated, ischemia-reperfusion with vehicle treatment and ischemia-reperfusion with U0126 treatment. Ischemia was induced by ligating the left anterior descending coronary artery for 30 minutes followed by reperfusion. U0126 was administered before ischemia and repeated 6 hours after start of reperfusion. The contractile properties of isolated coronary arteries to endothelin-1 and sarafotoxin 6c were evaluated using wire-myography. The gene expression of endothelin-1 and endothelin receptors were measured using qPCR. Distribution and localization of proteins (pERK1/2, prepro-endothelin-1, endothelin-1, and endothelin ETA and ETB receptors) were analysed by Western blot and immunohistochemistry. We found that pERK1/2 was significantly augmented in the ischemic area 3 hours after ischemia-reperfusion; this correlated with increased ETB receptor and ET-1 gene expressions in ischemic myocardium and in coronary arteries. ETB receptor-mediated vasoconstriction was observed to be increased in coronary arteries 24 hours after ischemia-reperfusion. Treatment with U0126 reduced pERK1/2, expression of ET-1 and ETB receptor, and ETB receptor-mediated vasoconstriction.
These findings suggest that the MEK-ERK1/2 signaling pathway is important for regulating endothelin-1 and ETB receptors in myocardium and coronary arteries after ischemia-reperfusion in the ischemic region. Inhibition of the MEK-ERK1/2 pathway may provide a novel target for reducing ischemia-reperfusion damage in the heart.
We investigated effects of 7-oxygenated cholesterol derivatives present in atherosclerotic lesions, 7α-hydroxycholesterol (7αOHChol), 7β-hydroxycholesterol (7βOHChol), and 7-ketocholesterol (7K), on IL-8 expression. Transcript levels of IL-8 and secretion of its corresponding gene product by monocytes/macrophages were enhanced by treatment with 7αOHChol and, to a lesser extent, 7K, but not by 7βOHChol. The 7-oxygenated cholesterol derivatives, however, did not change transcription of the IL-8 gene in vascular smooth muscle cells. 7αOHChol-induced IL-8 gene transcription was inhibited by cycloheximide and Akt1 downregulation, but not by OxPAPC. Expression of C5a receptor was upregulated after stimulation with 7αOHChol, but not with 7K and 7βOHChol, and a specific antagonist of C5a receptor inhibited 7αOHChol-induced IL-8 gene expression in a dose dependent manner. Pharmacological inhibitors of PI3K and MEK almost completely inhibited expression of both IL-8 and cell-surface C5a receptor induced by 7αOHChol. These results indicate that 7-oxygenated cholesterol derivatives have differential effects on monocyte/macrophage expression of IL-8 and C5a receptor and that C5a receptor is involved in 7αOHChol-induced IL-8 expression via PI3K and MEK.
Until recently, overall long term survival in patients with stage IV melanoma was lower than 10 %. However, the treatment of melanoma has evolved rapidly over the last few years, with the advent of inhibitors of BRAF and MEK and of immunotherapeutic agents including ipilimumab, nivolumab, and pembrolizumab. Areas covered: This is a comprehensive review of the literature on the role of pembrolizumab in melanoma. Pembrolizumab is a Programmed Death Receptor 1 (PD-1) directed monoclonal antibody which is approved by FDA and EMA for the treatment of patients with metastatic melanoma. Expert opinion: Phase II and III trials demonstrated that pembrolizumab is superior to ipilimumab in previously untreated patients and to chemotherapy in ipilimumab pre-treated patients. Unfortunately, prospectively validated predictive markers are lacking. Immune-related adverse events are particularly interesting and should be managed per the published guidelines. There are still many issues that remain unresolved including: when to stop treatment, biomarkers for choosing a single agent or combination therapy, the optimal schedule of ipilimumab in combination with anti-PD1 monoclonal antibodies, optimal management of adverse events, the role of immunotherapy in specific populations, the optimal sequence of immunotherapy and the BRAF/MEK inhibitor combination in patients.
The endocannabinoid system regulates neurite outgrowth and neurogenesis during development of the central nervous system. Cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1R) is expressed in neurons, including the somata and fibers, that innervate the endometrial ectopic cyst in rats. Here, we investigated the contribution of CB1R and its downstream signaling to the innervation of endometrial ectopic growth. We found that intrathecal injection of a CB1R agonist enhanced both the density of protein gene product (PGP) 9.5-immunoreactive sprouted nerve fibers and the protein level of PGP 9.5 of the ectopic cyst, and the CB1R antagonist induced opposite effects. The CB1R agonist increased the expression of phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (pERK) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (pJNK), but not pp38, in dorsal root ganglion (DRG), whereas the CB1R antagonist only decreased the expression of pERK. In cultured DRG neurons, CB1R agonists dose-dependently increased neurite elongation. The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/ERK kinase (MEK) and JNK inhibitors, but not the p38 inhibitor, attenuated CB1R agonist-induced neurite elongation. The inhibitions of CB1R and its downstream ERK and JNK signaling pathways may alleviate the sprouted innervation that has been involved in ENDO-associated pain. This finding may provide a new therapeutic target for patients with endometriosis.
Excessive Zn(2+) causes brain damage via promoting ROS generation. Here we investigated the role of ROS-sensitive TRPM2 channel in H2O2/Zn(2+)-induced Ca(2+) signalling and cell death in microglial cells. H2O2/Zn(2+) induced concentration-dependent increases in cytosolic Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)]c), which was inhibited by PJ34, a PARP inhibitor, and abolished by TRPM2 knockout (TRPM2-KO). Pathological concentrations of H2O2/Zn(2+) induced substantial cell death that was inhibited by PJ34 and DPQ, PARP inhibitors, 2-APB, a TRPM2 channel inhibitor, and prevented by TRPM2-KO. Further analysis indicate that Zn(2+) induced ROS production, PARP-1 stimulation, increase in the [Ca(2+)]c and cell death, all of which were suppressed by chelerythrine, a protein kinase C inhibitor, DPI, a NADPH-dependent oxidase (NOX) inhibitor, GKT137831, a NOX1/4 inhibitor, and Phox-I2, a NOX2 inhibitor. Furthermore, Zn(2+)-induced PARP-1 stimulation, increase in the [Ca(2+)]c and cell death were inhibited by PF431396, a Ca(2+)-sensitive PYK2 inhibitor, and U0126, a MEK/ERK inhibitor. Taken together, our study shows PKC/NOX-mediated ROS generation and PARP-1 activation as an important mechanism in Zn(2+)-induced TRPM2 channel activation and, TRPM2-mediated increase in the [Ca(2+)]c to trigger the PYK2/MEK/ERK signalling pathway as a positive feedback mechanism that amplifies the TRPM2 channel activation. Activation of these TRPM2-depenent signalling mechanisms ultimately drives Zn(2+)-induced Ca(2+) overloading and cell death.
The BRAF inhibitor dabrafenib was recently approved for the treatment of certain BRAF V600 mutation-positive tumors, either alone or in combination therapy with the MEK inhibitor trametinib. This article presents the dabrafenib transporter-mediated drug-drug interaction risk assessment, which is currently an important part of drug development, regulatory submission and drug registration. Dabrafenib and its major circulating metabolites (hydroxy-, carboxy- and desmethyl-dabrafenib) were investigated as inhibitors of the clinically relevant transporters Pgp, BCRP, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OCT2, OAT1 and OAT3. The DDI guidance risk assessment decision criteria for inhibition of BCRP, OATP1B1 and OAT3 were slightly exceeded and therefore a minor DDI effect resulting from inhibition of these transporters remained possible. Biliary secretion is the major excretion pathway of dabrafenib related material (71% of orally administered radiolabeled dose recovered in feces), while urinary excretion was observed as well (22.7% of the dose). In vitro uptake into human hepatocytes of the dabrafenib metabolites, but not of dabrafenib parent compound, was mediated, at least in part, by hepatic uptake transporters. The transporters responsible for uptake of the pharmacologically active hydroxy- and desmethyl dabrafenib could not be identified, whereas carboxy-dabrafenib was a substrate of several OATPs. Dabrafenib, hydroxy- and desmethyl dabrafenib were substrates of P-gp and BCRP, while carboxy-dabrafenib was not. While a small increase in exposure to carboxy-dabrafenib upon inhibition of OATPs and an increase in exposure to desmethyl-dabrafenib upon inhibition of P-gp or BCRP cannot be excluded, the clinical significance of such increases is likely low.
Higher expression of growth differentiation factor-9 (GDF-9) in keloids compared with hypertrophic scars and normal skin tissues has been reported recently. The present study was performed to investigate the role of GDF-9 in keloid pathogenesis, and to elucidate its implication for asiaticoside in the keloid management. The data showed that GDF-9 could enhance the proliferation, migration, and invasion of keloid fibroblasts (KFs), while it only slightly elevated collagen expression, indicating that the effect of GDF-9 was opposite to that of TGF-β1. The bioactivity difference between GDF-9 and TGF-β1 could be explained by the different phosphorylated sites on the downstream Smad2/3. Moreover, asiaticoside could inhibit GDF-9-induced activation of MAPKs and Smad pathway in KFs. In conclusion, GDF-9 enhanced the invasive growth of KFs, which was achieved by phosphorylation of Smad 2/3 at the linker region through activation of MAPKs pathway. Asiaticoside hindered the invasive growth of KFs by inhibiting the GDF-9/MAPK/Smad pathway.
Vitamin D-1,25(OH)2 D3 or 1,25D3-maintains healthy osseous tissue, stimulates the production of the antimicrobial peptide cathelicidin and has anti-inflammatory effects, but it can cause hypercalcemia. Evidence links diminished serum levels of 1,25D3 with increased gingival inflammation. Periodontitis progression is associated with increased local production of inflammatory mediators by immune cells and gingival fibroblasts. These include interleukin (IL)-6, a regulator of osteoclastic bone resorption, and the neutrophil chemoattractant IL-8, both regulated by signaling pathways, including NF-κB and MAPK/AP-1. The objectives were to determine the effects of 1,25D3 or a non-calcemic analog, 20-hydroxyvitamin D3 -20(OH)D3 or 20D3-on IL-1β-stimulated IL-6 and IL-8 production, and NF-κB and MAPK/AP-1 activation, by human gingival fibroblasts.
Human gingival fibroblasts were incubated ± IL-1β, with or without exposure to 1,25D3 or 20D3. IL-6 and IL-8 in culture supernatants were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. NF-κB (p65) and AP-1 (phospho-cJun) and were measured in nuclear extracts via binding to specific oligonucleotides. Data were analyzed using ANOVA and Scheffe's F procedure for post hoc comparisons.
IL-1β-stimulated IL-6 and IL-8 levels were both significantly inhibited (40%-60%) (P&lt;.045) by 1,25D3, but not 20D3 (0%-15% inhibition, not statistically significant). Both 1,25D3 and 20D3 significantly and similarly inhibited IL-1β-stimulated nuclear levels of p65 and phospho-cJun (P&lt;.02).
Reduction of the activation of NF-κB and AP-1 alone is not able to inhibit strongly the IL-1β stimulated IL-6 and IL-8 gene expression. 1,25D3 but not 20D3 may affect some of the many other factors/processes/pathways that in turn regulate the expression of these genes. However, the results suggest that topical application of ligands of the vitamin D receptor may be useful in the local treatment of periodontitis while reducing adverse systemic effects.
Cancer immunotherapy is revolutionizing the clinical management of several tumors, but has demonstrated limited activity in breast cancer. The development of more effective treatments is hindered by incomplete knowledge of the genetic determinant of immune responsiveness. To fill this gap, we mined copy number alteration, somatic mutation, and expression data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). By using RNA-sequencing data from 1,004 breast cancers, we defined distinct immune phenotypes characterized by progressive expression of transcripts previously associated with immune-mediated rejection. The T helper 1 (Th-1) phenotype (ICR4), which also displays upregulation of immune-regulatory transcripts such as PDL1, PD1, FOXP3, IDO1, and CTLA4, was associated with prolonged patients' survival. We validated these findings in an independent meta-cohort of 1,954 breast cancer gene expression data. Chromosome segment 4q21, which includes genes encoding for the Th-1 chemokines CXCL9-11, was significantly amplified only in the immune favorable phenotype (ICR4). The mutation and neoantigen load progressively decreased from ICR4 to ICR1 but could not fully explain immune phenotypic differences. Mutations of TP53 were enriched in the immune favorable phenotype (ICR4). Conversely, the presence of MAP3K1 and MAP2K4 mutations were tightly associated with an immune-unfavorable phenotype (ICR1). Using both the TCGA and the validation dataset, the degree of MAPK deregulation segregates breast tumors according to their immune disposition. These findings suggest that mutation-driven perturbations of MAPK pathways are linked to the negative regulation of intratumoral immune response in breast cancer. Modulations of MAPK pathways could be experimentally tested to enhance breast cancer immune sensitivity.
Diallyl trisulfide (DATS), a garlic organosulfide, has shown excellent chemopreventive potential. Cisplatin (DDP) is widely used to treat solid malignant tumors, but causing serious side effects. In the current study, we attempted to elucidate the chemopreventive mechanisms of DATS in human gastric cancer BGC-823 cells in vitro, and to investigate whether DATS could enhance the anti-tumor efficacy of DDP and improve quality of life in BGC-823 xenograft mice in vivo. Treatment with DATS (25-400 μmol/L) dose-dependently inhibited the viability of BGC-823 cells in vitro with an IC50 of 115.2±4.3 μmol/L after 24 h drug exposure. DATS (50-200 μmol/L) induced cell cycle arrest at G2/M phase in BGC-823 cells, which correlated with significant accumulation of cyclin A2 and B1. DATS also induced BGC-823 cell apoptosis, which was accompanied by the modulation of Bcl-2 family members and caspase cascade activation. In BGC-823 xenograft mice, administration of DATS (20-40 mg·kg(-1)·d(-1), ip) dose-dependently inhibited tumor growth and markedly reduced the number of Ki-67 positive cells in tumors. Interestingly, combined administration of DATS (30 mg·kg(-1)·d(-1), ip) with DDP (5 mg/kg, every 5 d, ip) exhibited enhanced anti-tumor activity with fewer side effects. We showed that treatment of BGC-823 cells with DATS in vitro and in vivo significantly activated kinases such as p38 and JNK/MAPK and attenuated the Nrf2/Akt pathway. This study provides evidence that DATS exerts anticancer effects and enhances the antitumor efficacy of DDP, making it a novel candidate for adjuvant therapy for gastric cancer.
Meningiomas represent thirty-six percent of primary brain tumors. The pathogenesis of these tumors is not completely established hindering development of effective chemotherapy. Recently, numerous studies have identified alterations in several growth factors/receptor kinases that regulate meningioma growth. These may be targets for new therapies. . Of these and, sometimes overlooked, is the TGF-β family, its receptors and signaling pathways plays a critical role in the development or progression of many forms of neoplasia.
Evidence suggesting a potential role for transforming growth factor -betas (TGF-βs), bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) and their mediators is reviewed.
TGF-β inhibition of growth in normal leptomeninges may be lost in neoplasia. Moreover, loss of TGF-β and BMP signaling components and as well as TGF-β receptor 3 likely contribute to the development and/or progression of higher grade meningiomas.
Accumulating evidence suggests that derangement of TGF-β family signaling contributes to the development and progression of meningiomas. These may represent new targets for chemotherapy and could include inhibitors of kinases activated by TGF-β.
A defined protocol for efficiently deriving endothelial cells from human pluripotent stem cells was established and vascular morphogenesis was used as a model system to understand how synthetic hydrogels influence global biological function compared with common 2D and 3D culture platforms. RNA sequencing demonstrated that gene expression profiles were similar for endothelial cells and pericytes cocultured in polyethylene glycol (PEG) hydrogels or Matrigel, while monoculture comparisons identified distinct vascular signatures for each cell type. Endothelial cells cultured on tissue-culture polystyrene adopted a proliferative phenotype compared with cells cultured on or encapsulated in PEG hydrogels. The proliferative phenotype correlated to increased FAK-ERK activity, and knockdown or inhibition of ERK signaling reduced proliferation and expression for cell-cycle genes while increasing expression for "3D-like" vasculature development genes. Our results provide insight into the influence of 2D and 3D culture formats on global biological processes that regulate cell function.
Melanoma is the deadliest skin cancer. RACK1 (Receptor for activated protein kinase C) protein was proposed as a biological marker of melanoma in human and domestic animal species harboring spontaneous melanomas. As a scaffold protein, RACK1 is able to coordinate the interaction of key signaling molecules implicated in both physiological cellular functions and tumorigenesis. A role for RACK1 in rewiring ERK and JNK signaling pathways in melanoma cell lines had been proposed. Here, we used a genetic approach to test this hypothesis in vivo in the mouse. We show that Rack1 knock-down in the mouse melanoma cell line B16 reduces invasiveness and induces cell differentiation. We have developed the first mouse model for RACK1 gain of function, Tyr::Rack1-HA transgenic mice, targeting RACK1 to melanocytes in vivo. RACK1 overexpression was not sufficient to initiate melanomas despite activated ERK and AKT. However, in a context of melanoma predisposition, RACK1 overexpression reduced latency and increased incidence and metastatic rate. In primary melanoma cells from Tyr::Rack1-HA, Tyr::NRas(Q61K) mice, activated JNK (c-Jun N-terminal kinase) and activated STAT3 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 3) acted as RACK1 oncogenic partners in tumoral progression. A sequential and coordinated activation of ERK, JNK and STAT3 with RACK1 is shown to accelerate aggressive melanoma development in vivo.
Testosterone action is mediated via the androgen receptor (AR). We have reported that male mice lacking AR selectively in β-cells (βARKO(-/y)) develop decreased glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS), producing glucose intolerance. We showed that testosterone action on AR in β-cells amplifies the insulinotropic action of GLP-1 on its receptor via a cAMP-dependent protein kinase-A pathway.
To investigate AR-dependent gene networks in β-cells, we performed a high throughput whole transcriptome sequencing (RNA-Seq) in islets from male βARKO(-/y) and control mice.
We identified 214 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) (158 up- and 56 down-regulated) with a false discovery rate (FDR) &lt; 0.05 and a fold change (FC) &gt; 2. Our analysis of individual transcripts revealed alterations in β-cell genes involved in cellular inflammation/stress and insulin secretion. Based on 312 DEGs with an FDR &lt; 0.05, the pathway analysis revealed 23 significantly enriched pathways, including cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, Jak-STAT signaling, insulin signaling, MAPK signaling, type 2 diabetes (T2D) and pancreatic secretion. The gene ontology analysis confirmed the results of the individual DEGs and the pathway analysis in showing enriched biological processes encompassing inflammation, ion transport, exocytosis and insulin secretion.
AR-deficient islets exhibit altered expression of genes involved in inflammation and insulin secretion demonstrating the importance of androgen action in β-cell health in the male with implications for T2D development in men.
Bleomycin (BLM) has been found safe and highly effective in the treatment of the mucoceles by intralesional injection in our previous study. The present research was designed to investigate whether epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) contributes to the therapeutic effects of BLM for mucoceles of the salivary glands.
The cell proliferation and apoptosis of human submandibular gland cells (HSG cells) were examined by Cell Counting Kit-8 assay and Annexin V binding assay respectively. Epithelial and mesenchymal markers of HSG cells were measured by real-time quantitative PCR and Western blot analysis. Acinar differentiation and cell migration assays were performed to evaluate HSG cells function.
High-dose BLM (≥0.5μg/mL) significantly inhibited the cell proliferation and induced the cell apoptosis, while the treatment with low-dose BLM (0.05 and 0.1μg/mL) for 48h induced EMT in HSG cells. Furthermore, Akt/mTOR pathway, rather than MAPK pathway, was activated through treated with 0.05 and 0.1μg/mL BLM, as well as activation of the transcription factor Slug and Zeb 1. The migration of HSG cells was also enhanced through 0.05 and 0.1μg/mL BLM, but the ability of acinar differentiation was diminished.
Our results indicated that an EMT process was involved in the BLM-induced therapeutic effects on the HSG cells through the Akt/mTOR pathway. Importantly, the results indicated the potential role of this process in the BLM sclerotherapy of mucoceles of the salivary glands.
Intervertebral disc degeneration (IDD) is the main cause of low back pain, and nucleus pulposus (NP) cell apoptosis is an important risk factor of IDD. However, the molecular mechanism of this disease remains unknown.
To assess the potential protective effect of CDDO-ethyl amide (EA) against high-glucose-induced oxidative stress injury in NP cells and to investigate the mechanism of antioxidative effects and apoptotic inhibition.
To find new molecule to inhibit intervertebral disc degeneration.
Viability, ROS levels and apoptosis were examined in NP cells. The protein expression levels of HO-1 and Nrf2 were measured through Western blot. All other authors have no conflicts of interest. This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Project Approval Number:21472104. It contains about 60 thousand dollars).
CDDO-EA elicited cytoprotective effects against NP cell apoptosis and ROS accumulation induced by high glucose. CDDO-EA treatment increased the HO-1 and Nrf2 expression abrogated by HO-1, Nrf2 and MAPK inhibitors.
The phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of Nrf2 are crucial for HO-1 overexpression induced by CDDO-EA, which is essential for the cytoprotection against high-glucose-induced oxidative stress in NP cells.
Prostate cancer (PCa) remains the second-leading cause of cancer-related deaths in American men with an estimated mortality of more than 26,000 in 2016 alone. Aggressive and metastatic tumors are treated with androgen deprivation therapies (ADT); however, the tumors acquire resistance and develop into lethal castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). With the advent of better therapeutics, the incidences of a more aggressive neuroendocrine prostate cancer (NEPC) variant continue to emerge. Although de novo occurrences of NEPC are rare, more than 25% of the therapy-resistant patients on highly potent new-generation anti-androgen therapies end up with NEPC. This, along with previous observations of an increase in the number of such NE cells in aggressive tumors, has been suggested as a mechanism of resistance development during prostate cancer progression. Dovitinib (TKI-258/CHIR-258) is a pan receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) inhibitor that targets VEGFR, FGFR, PDGFR, and KIT. It has shown efficacy in mouse-model of PCa bone metastasis, and is presently in clinical trials for several cancers. We observed that both androgen receptor (AR) positive and AR-negative PCa cells differentiate into a NE phenotype upon treatment with Dovitinib. The NE differentiation was also observed when mice harboring PC3-xenografted tumors were systemically treated with Dovitinib. The mechanistic underpinnings of this differentiation are unclear, but seem to be supported through MAPK-, PI3K-, and Wnt-signaling pathways. Further elucidation of the differentiation process will enable the identification of alternative salvage or combination therapies to overcome the potential resistance development.
The pathological changes of parasympathetic nerves are considered as an independent prognostic factor of the survival rate for patients with chronic liver disease. The non-selective muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAchR) agonists and antagonists can affect the proliferation of hepatocytes, but little is known about the role of mAChR in hepatocytes and hepatic fibrosis and the signaling pathway of this receptor in regulation of hepatocytes remains elusive. Here, 3ml/kg 40% carbon tetrachloride (CCL4) was given to induce hepatic fibrosis in rats and the hepatocytes were isolated to investigate the expression of mAchR and the cell signaling pathways which were involved in. Compared with the normal state, the expression levels of m1, 3, 5 in fibrotic hepatocytes (FHC) and the cells treated with 10μM pilocarpine (Pi) were obviously increased, while decreased in m2,4. Pi could increase the value of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), hydroxyproline (Hyp), decrease albumin (ALB) and cell viability, while atropine could ameliorate fibrotic hepatocytes fuction. The p-AKT, p-ERK, p- JNK and p-P38 increased in Pi group or FHC group, but the inhibitors of PI3K, MAPK and PKC could reverse the Pi action and improve the FHC fuction. In this study we found that mAchR played an important role in the regulation of hepatic fibrosis process and the PKC, ERK, P38 and PI3K/AKT signaling pathways involved in the parasympathetic excitation mediated by mAchR.
Cartilage endplate (CEP) cell calcification and apoptosis play a vital role in the intervertebral disc degeneration (IVDD). Oxidative stress is a key factor in inducing programmed cell death and cartilage calcification. However, the cell death and calcification of cartilage endplate cells under oxidative stress have never been described. The present study investigated the apoptosis and calcification in the cartilage endplate cell under oxidative stress induced by H2O2 to understand the underlying mechanism of IVDD. The cartilage endplate cells isolated from human lumbar discs were subjected to different concentrations of H2O2 for various time periods. The cell viability was determined by CCK-8 assay, whereas Western blot, immunofluorescence, and Alcian blue, Alizarin red, and Von Kossa staining evaluated the apoptosis and calcification. The level of mitochondria-specific reactive oxygen species (ROS) was quantified with an oxygen radical-sensitive probe-MitoSOX. The potential signaling pathways were investigated by Western blot after the addition of N-acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC). We found that the oxidative stress induced by H2O2 increased the apoptosis and subsequently the calcification in the cartilage endplate cells through the ROS/p38/ERK/p65 pathway. The apoptosis and the calcification of the cartilage endplate cells induced by H2O2 can be abolished by NAC. These results suggested that regulating the apoptosis and the calcification in the cartilage endplate cells under oxidative stress should be advantageous for the survival of cells and might delay the process of disc degeneration.
N-Acetylmannosamine kinase (MNK) plays a key role in the biosynthesis of sialic acids and glycosylation of proteins. Sialylated glycoconjugates affect a large number of biological processes, including immune modulation and cancer transformation. For the search of effective inhibitors of MNK we applied high-throughput screening of drug-like small molecules. Applying different orthogonal assays for their validation we identified four potential MNK-specific inhibitors with IC50 values in the low micromolar range. Molecular modeling of the inhibitors into the active site of MNK supports their binding to both, either the sugar or the ATP-binding pocket of the enzyme. These compounds are promising to downregulate sialic acid content of glycoconjugates and to study the functional contribution to disease development.
Ovarian cancer is the most lethal gynecologic malignancy worldwide with surgery as the only curative treatment. Long-term overall survival (OS) of ovarian cancer is far from satisfactory, even though significant improvement has been made in post-operative chemotherapy. One of the most important death cause is the chemoresistance due to consecutive chemotherapy. Therefore, understanding the molecular mechanisms involved in ovarian cancer development and identification of novel therapeutic targets are urgently required.
Immunohistochemical (IHC) staining was used to explore the expression pattern of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)-interacting kinase 1 (MNK1) in tumor tissues from 138 epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) patients. Clinicopathological data were subjected to Kaplan-Meier survival and Cox multivariate analyses to evaluate the prognostic value of MNK1 in EOC. Overexpression and silencing procedures were performed on OVCAR-5 cells to investigate the mechanisms of MNK1 in regulating EOC development. The anti-tumor effects of CGP57380, a specific MNK inhibitor, were examined by cell viability assay.
Higher MNK1 expression showed significant relationship with advanced FIGO stage and positive lymph node metastasis of EOC. Univariate and multivariate analyses revealed that MNK1 was an independent prognostic factor for OS of EOC patients. In vitro study demonstrated that MNK1 can promote cell proliferation through regulating the phosphorylation level of eukaryotic initiation factor 4E. In addition, inhibition of MNK1 by CGP57380 significantly down-regulated the OVCAR-5 cell viability.
High MNK1 expression in EOC tissues indicates poor clinical outcomes, and MNK1 can act as a potential target for novel chemotherapy development towards EOC.
Peptidylarginine deiminase (PAD) catalyzes the conversion of arginine residues to citrulline residues, termed citrullination. Recent studies have suggested that PAD isoform 2 (PADI2) plays an important role in tumors, although its tumorigenic effect and mechanism are largely unknown.
Immunohistochemistry and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) were used to investigate the expression level of PADI2 in various tumor tissues and patient blood samples, respectively. MNK-45 and Bel-7402 tumor cell lines originating from gastric and liver tumors, respectively, were treated with anti-PADI2 siRNA, and the subsequent cell proliferation, apoptosis and migration were observed. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) arrays, including Cancer PathwayFinder, Oncogenes and Tumor Suppressor Genes, p53 Signaling Pathway, Signal Transduction Pathway and Tumor Metastasis PCR arrays, were used to investigate the tumorigenic pathway of PADI2 in the siRNA-treated tumor cells. This analysis was verified by real-time PCR.
Immunohistochemistry detected significantly increased expression of PADI2 in invasive breast ductal carcinoma, cervical squamous cell carcinoma, colon adenocarcinoma, liver hepatocellular carcinoma, lung cancer, ovarian serous papillary adenocarcinoma and papillary thyroid carcinoma samples. ELISA detected a twofold increase in PADI2 expression in the blood of 48.3% of patients with liver cancer, 38% of patients with cervical carcinoma and 32% of patients with gastric carcinoma. Increased apoptosis and decreased cell proliferation and migration were observed in the anti-PADI2 siRNA-treated MNK-45 cells, and increased cell proliferation and migration and decreased apoptosis were observed in the treated Bel-7402 cells with suppressed PADI2 expression. PCR arrays and real-time PCR detected significantly decreased CXCR2 and EPO expression in the MNK-45 cells and Bel-7402 cells, respectively, with the anti-PADI2 siRNA treatments.
PADI2 expression is increased in many types of tumor tissues and patient blood samples. PADI2 may advance abnormal cell behavior in gastric cancers by mediating CXCR2, a well-known gene that stimulates cell proliferation and invasion. However, PADI2 might have deleterious effects on tumor growth and metastasis in liver tumor cells by regulating the expression of EPO, a gene with controversial functions in tumor growth. The results suggest that the effect of PADI2 on tumorigenesis is multifactorial, depending on the tumor type.
MiR-101-3p was identified as a tumor suppressor in several cancers, but its exact role in gastric adenocarcinoma is still largely unknown. In this study, we found that, compared with the RGM-1 human normal gastric epithelial cells, miR-101-3p was significantly downregulated in all the 6 human gastric adenocarcinoma cell lines, including BGC-823, MNK-45, MGC-803, SGC-7901, AGS and HGC-27. Overexpression miR-101-3p suppressed both the proliferation and invasion of AGS gastric adenocarcinoma cells and knockdown of miR-101-3p displayed an opposite effect. In addition, miR-101-3p could directly target and suppress the expression SRF gene, which is a transcription factor of HOTAIR, a well-characterized tumor promoter lncRNA. MiR-101-3p negatively regulated SRF-mediated transcription of HOTAIR. Moreover, either silence of SRF or silence of HOTAIR could counteract the promotion of gastric adenocarcinoma cell proliferation and invasion by miR-101-3p inhibition. Our findings indicate that miR-101-3p suppresses HOTAIR-induced proliferation and invasion through directly targeting SRF in gastric carcinoma cells.
The mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) integrates numerous stimuli and coordinates the adaptive response of many cellular processes. To accomplish this, mTOR associates with distinct co-factors that determine its signaling output. While many of these co-factors are known, in many cases their function and regulation remain opaque. The MAPK-interacting kinase (MNK) contributes to rapamycin resistance in cancer cells. Here, we demonstrate that MNK sustains mTORC1 activity following rapamycin treatment and contributes to mTORC1 signaling following T cell activation and growth stimuli in cancer cells. We determine that MNK engages with mTORC1, promotes mTORC1 association with the phosphatidyl inositol 3' kinase-related kinase (PIKK) stabilizer, TELO2, and facilitates mTORC1:substrate binding. Moreover, our data suggest that DEPTOR, the endogenous inhibitor of mTOR, opposes mTORC1:substrate association by preventing TELO2:mTORC1 binding. Thus, MNK orchestrates counterbalancing forces that regulate mTORC1 enzymatic activity.
MNK1 and MNK2 are MAP kinase-interacting serine/threonine kinases, which are activated by RAS and MAPK signaling pathways and are involved in regulation of protein translation. Both kinases phosphorylate translation initiation factor eIF4E on a conserved serine 209. Overactivated eIF4E can act as an oncogene and contribute to the transformation both in vitro and in vivo and is highly expressed in diverse types of cancer. Interestingly, knockout mice that lack both Mnk1 and Mnk2 do not have any apparent phenotype. Recently first dual MNK1/2 inhibitors have entered clinical trials as a combinational therapy with docetaxel in NSCLC and in other solid tumors. As a result there is a growing interest in development and characterization of novel selective MNK1/2 inhibitors.
A literature search of available bibliographic databases has been done in order to collect scientific resources, with an emphasis on the most recent and selective inhibitors of MNKs kinases. Additional valuable sources of information used in the article include available patents and conference reports, which provide an overview for ongoing development programs focused on the inhibition of MNKs. Collected results in many cases enabled analysis of structure-activity relationship and additional insight into selectivity, and cellular mode of action. Structure comparisons were performed using X-ray structures of MNKs downloaded from PDB database (www.rcsb.org) and visualized using an open source package Pymol (pymol.org). The key structural features for MNKs structures were selected using structural alignments generated by Moebitz et al. 2015, and internally developed Python scripts.
Presented review is a comprehensive overview of virtually all major chemical classes with a significant inhibitory activity on MNK1/2 kinases. One hundred and forty papers together with patent applications, filed in recent years, mostly by pharmaceutical companies, were included in this review. Fifty-one papers presented roles of MNKs in the development and progression of solid tumors and hematological malignancies, particularly in the context of cap-dependent translation, regulated by phosphorylation of eIF4E. Introduction of first clinical compounds is an important step in the process of validation MNKs as viable targets in oncology. Surprisingly very little is known about effects associated with treatment of cells using selective MNK1/2 inhibitors. Majority of compounds used as chemical probes proved to be either weak and/or non-selective inhibitors. Thirty-seven papers (of which twenty-seven of the last six years) document an enormous progress that has been made in the development of novel MNK inhibitors. Several different and novel chemical scaffolds have shown high affinity in low nanomolar range and promising signs of selectivity. These compounds in general display good correlation between biochemical activity on recombinant kinases and cellular target engagement measured by levels of eIF4E Ser209. Unexpectedly, there is a significant discrepancy between various MNK probes regarding exerted cellular efficacy. Further work is needed in order to characterize cells and process crucially dependent on the kinase activity of MNKs. Additional pharmacodynamics studies should better link observed effects on the level of eIF4E biomarker with expected efficacy, which may require sustain and near complete inhibition to attain desirable anti- cancer activity. Based on available data we have classified described inhibitors as Type I, Type II, Type III (allosteric) and Type VI (covalent). Additionally, examples of non-covalent macrocyclic compounds and retinamides, which act via degradation instead of inhibition have been described.
There is a growing number of reports on developments of novel, selective inhibitors of MNK1/2 kinases, what prompted us to summarize the most important achievements and current challenges in a form of this review. Presented results may help to select optimal probes for experiments aimed at the consequences of pharmacological inhibition of MNKs. Results of ongoing clinical trials of first-in-class MNK1/2 inhibitors will define further directions of chemical development. On the one hand, genetic knockdown studies indicated clear safety benefits of selective approach. On the other, critical revision of available inhibitors indicates that novel medicinal chemistry strategies would be necessary for increased affinity and rational engagement of additional targets, aimed at improved therapeutic efficacy.
Activation of nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain (NOD) 1 and NOD2 by muropeptides triggers a complex transcriptional program in innate immune cells. However, little is known about posttranscriptional regulation of NOD1- and NOD2-dependent responses. When stimulated with a prototypic NOD1 agonist, N-acetylglucosaminyl-N-acetylmuramyl-l-alanyl-d-isoglutamyl-meso-diaminopimelic acid (GM-triDAP), human monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM) produced an order of magnitude more TNF, IL-6, and pro-IL-1β than did monocyte-derived dendritic cells (MDDC), despite similar NOD1 expression, similar cytokine mRNA kinetics, and comparable responses to LPS. TNF production by GM-triDAP-activated MDM was independent of autocrine IL-1. However, GM-triDAP-activated MDM translated TNF mRNA more efficiently than did MDDC. As an underlying mechanism, NOD1 triggering in MDM caused a more potent and long-lasting activation of the signaling axis involving p38 MAPK, MAPK-interacting kinase (MNK), and eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E, which is a critical regulator of translation. Furthermore, MNK controlled TNF mRNA abundance in MDDC and MDM upon NOD1 triggering. NOD1-dependent responses were more sensitive to MNK inhibition than were TLR4-dependent responses. These results demonstrate the importance of the p38-MNK-eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E axis in TNF production downstream of NOD1.
Survival rate for pancreatic cancer (pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, PDAC) is poor, with about 80% of patients presenting with the metastatic disease. Gemcitabine, the standard chemotherapeutic agent for locally advanced and metastatic PDAC has limited efficacy, attributed to innate/acquired resistance and activation of pro-survival pathways. The Mnk1/2-eIF4E and NF-κB signaling pathways are implicated in PDAC disease progression/metastasis and also associated with gemcitabine-induced resistance in PDAC. Galeterone (gal), a multi-target, agent in phase III clinical development for prostate cancer has also shown effects on the aforementioned pathways. We show for the first time, that gal/analogs (VNPT55, VNPP414 and VNPP433-3β) profoundly inhibited cell viability of gemcitabine-naive/resistance PDAC cell lines and strongly synergized with gemcitabine in gemcitabine-resistant PDAC cells. In addition, to inducing G1 cell cycle arrest, gal/analogs induced caspase 3-mediated cell-death of PDAC cells. Gal/analogs caused profound downregulation of Mnk1/2, peIF4E and NF-κB (p-p65), metastatic inducing factors (N-cadherin, MMP-1/-2/-9, Slug, Snail and CXCR4) and putative stem cell factors, (β-Catenin, Nanog, BMI-1 and Oct-4). Gal/analog also depleted EZH2 and upregulated E-Cadherin. These effects resulted in significant inhibition of PDAC cell migration, invasion and proliferation. Importantly, we also observed strong MiaPaca-2 tumor xenograft growth inhibition (61% to 92%). Collectively, these promising findings strongly support further development of gal/analogs as novel therapeutics for PDAC.
Advanced breast cancer (eg. stage IV) is resistant to chemotherapy. In this work, we identified potentially druggable targets that are critically involved in chemoresistance. We showed that eIF4E is highly phosphorylated at serine 209 in breast cancer patients in response to chemotherapy, which significantly correlated with poorer clinical responses and outcomes. Depletion of eIF4E enhanced the anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic effects of chemotherapeutic drugs in breast cancer cells. Chemotherapy activated the Wnt/β-catenin signaling in an eIF4E-dependent manner. However, MNK inhibitors prevented chemotherapeutic drug-induced eIF4E phosphorylation and β-catenin activation, which enhanced the breast cancer cell response to chemotherapy in vitro and in vivo. These findings indicate MNK-eIF4E-β-catenin is an activator of the breast cancer cell response to chemotherapy and highlights the therapeutic value of inhibiting MNK to overcome chemoresistance in breast cancer.
Malignant astrocytomas are able to invade neighboring and distant areas of the normal brain. Signaling pathway alterations play important role in the development of astrocytomas. Deregulation of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) by MAP kinase-interacting kinases (Mnk) on Ser-209 directly or PI3K/mTOR/S6K pathway indirectly has a critical effect on promoting cellular proliferation, malignant transformation and metastasis. We examined and analyzed the correlation between expression of p-Mnk1, p-eIF4E and p-p70S6K proteins and clinicopathological features in 103 astrocytomas and 54 non-tumorous brain tissues. The results indicated that positive percentage of overexpression of p-Mnk1 and p-eIF4E proteins in astrocytomas were significantly higher than that of in the non-tumorous brain tissues (P &lt; 0.05). Elevated p-Mnk1 and p-eIF4E and co-overexpressed three proteins were associated with tumor recurrence (P = 0.003, P = 0.006, P = 0.007, respectively). Overexpressed p-eIF4E significantly correlated with the tumor size (P = 0.019). In addition, overexpression of p-eIF4E and three proteins common expression were related to the WHO grade of astrocytomas (P = 0.001, P = 0.044 respectively). Spearman's rank correlation test further showed that the expression of p-Mnk1 was strongly positive correlated with the expression of p-eIF4E in astrocytomas (r = 0.294, P = 0.003). Besides, overexpression of p-eIF4E and co-expression of p-Mnk1, p-eIF4E and p-p70S6K proteins were inversely correlated with overall survival rates of astrocytomas. Multivariate Cox regression analysis further identified that the elevated p-eIF4E expression, three proteins common expression were correlated with unfavorable prognosis of astrocytomas regardless of ages and WHO grades. Taken together, overexpression of p-eIF4E and co-expression of p-Mnk1, p-eIF4E and p-p70S6K proteins could be used as novel independent poor prognostic biomarkers for patients with astrocytomas.
Though borderline psychiatric disorders (BPD) are quite common diseases, their pathogenesis remains obscure. Data from several groups and our previous results suggest that the pathological changes are typical not only for brain cells, but also for cells of the immune system. One of the evident illustrations of immune and nervous systems relationship in pathogenesis of mental diseases is the death of PBMC occurring in patients with depression. We have shown previously that activities of the caspases increase in some types of BPD. In this study, we have investigated caspase activities in PBMC of patients with BPD of different severity. It has been found that in severe depressive disorder activities of caspases were reduced either as compared to healthy controls or to patients with depression lesser severity. In contrast, in patients with severe anxiety activities of caspases were higher than in both control and patients with less severe forms of anxiety disorders. Thus, the study of caspase activity in PBMC makes it possible to differentiate between severe and mild forms of BPD.

We investigated whether MAPK-interacting kinase (Mnk) inhibition sensitizes anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC) cellular response to chemotherapy.
In vitro and in vivo methods were used to examine the combinatory effects of cisplatin with Mnk inhibition and its underlying mechanism.
Mnk inhibition by pharmacological or genetic approaches inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis of ATC cells and enhances the effects of cisplatin in in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, cisplatin increases eIF4E phosphorylation in a dose- and time-dependent manner in ATC cells. Mnk inhibitors sensitize the efficacy of cisplatin by inhibiting cisplatin-induced eIF4E phosphorylation.
Targeting Mnk-eIF4E pathway provides a therapeutic strategy by sensitizing ATC response to chemotherapeutic drug.
Gastric cancer (GC) is the fifth most common cancer worldwide and the third leading cause of global cancer-related death. Benzo[a]pyrene (BaP), a Group Ⅰ carcinogen categorized by the IARC, is a cumulative foodborne carcinogen and ubiquitous environmental pollutant with potent carcinogenic properties. However, the function and mechanism of BaP exposure on GC progression remains unclear. We investigated the role of BaP in human GC progression to identify potential mechanism underlining its carcinogenic activity. After exposure to various concentrations of BaP, human GC cells SGC-7901 and MNK-45 showed an increased capability of proliferation, migration and invasion. Further study indicated that BaP promotes the expression of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP9) and c-myc at mRNA and protein level, and activates Aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) and ERK pathway. Moreover, BaP-induced overexpression of MMP9 and c-myc were attenuated by the ERK inhibitor U0126 and AhR inhibitor resveratrol, respectively. These data suggest that BaP promotes proliferation and metastasis of GC cells through upregulation of MMP9 and c-myc expression, and this was likely mediated via the AhR and ERK signaling pathway.
In this article, we attempt to understand and to contrast the impact of problem features on the performance of randomized search heuristics for black-box multiobjective combinatorial optimization problems. At first, we measure the performance of two conventional dominance-based approaches with unbounded archive on a benchmark of enumerable binary optimization problems with tunable ruggedness, objective space dimension, and objective correlation ([Formula: see text]MNK-landscapes). Precisely, we investigate the expected runtime required by a global evolutionary optimization algorithm with an ergodic variation operator (GSEMO) and by a neighborhood-based local search heuristic (PLS), to identify a ([Formula: see text]approximation of the Pareto set. Then, we define a number of problem features characterizing the fitness landscape, and we study their intercorrelation and their association with algorithm runtime on the benchmark instances. At last, with a mixed-effects multilinear regression we assess the individual and joint effect of problem features on the performance of both algorithms, within and across the instance classes defined by benchmark parameters. Our analysis reveals further insights into the importance of ruggedness and multimodality to characterize instance hardness for this family of multiobjective optimization problems and algorithms.
Mnk kinase is required for the phosphorylation and activation of the eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (eIF4E), which regulates translation of proteins involve in important aspects of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Here we investigated whether an antifungal agent, cercosporamide, which had been recently identified as a potent Mnk inhibitor, is active against HCC and angiogenesis. We showed that cercosporamide significantly inhibited growth and induced caspase-dependent apoptosis on numerous HCC cell lines, while sparing normal liver cells. In addition, cercosporamide impaired HCC angiogenesis via inhibiting HCC-endothelial cells (HCC-EC) capillary network formation, migration, proliferation and survival. Importantly, cercosporamide sensitized HCC cells to cisplatin in in vitro cell culture and in vivo HCC xenograft mouse model. Cercosporamide blocked the phosphorylation of eIF4E but not Erk or p38 in a dose- and time-dependent manner in HCC and HCC-EC cells, suggesting that suppression of eIF4E phosphorylation was the result of inhibition of Mnk but not Mnk upstream pathways. Overexpression of constitutively active eIF4E (S209D) but not the nonphosphorylatable eIF4E (S209A) abolished the inhibitory effects of cercosporamide in HepG2 cells. Altogether, our work demonstrates that cercosporamide acts as a Mnk inhibitor through blockage of eIF4E phosphorylation and selectively exhibits anti-HCC activities. Our work suggests that targeting MNK-eIF4E pathway represents a therapeutic strategy to overcome chemo-resistance for HCC treatment.
Metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) accounts for a high percentage of prostate cancer mortality. The proprietary compound galeterone (gal) was designed to inhibit proliferation of androgen/androgen receptor (AR)-dependent prostate cancer cell in vitro and in vivo and is currently in phase III clinical development. Additionally, clinical studies with gal revealed its superb efficacy in four different cohorts of patients with mCRPC, including those expressing splice variant AR-V7. Preclinical studies with gal show that it also exhibits strong antiproliferative activities against AR-negative prostate cancer cells and tumors through a mechanism involving phosphorylation of eIF2α, which forms an integral component of the eukaryotic mRNA translation complex. Thus, we hypothesized that gal and its new analog, VNPT55, could modulate oncogenic mRNA translation and prostate cancer cell migration and invasion. We report that gal and VNPT55 profoundly inhibit migration and invasion of prostate cancer cells, possibly by down-regulating protein expression of several EMT markers (Snail, Slug, N-cadherin, vimentin, and MMP-2/-9) via antagonizing the Mnk-eIF4E axis. In addition, gal/VNPT55 inhibited both NF-κB and Twist1 transcriptional activities, down-regulating Snail and BMI-1 mRNA expression, respectively. Furthermore, profound up-regulation of E-cadherin mRNA and protein expression may explain the observed significant inhibition of prostate cancer cell migration and invasion. Moreover, expression of self-renewal proteins, β-catenin, CD44, and Nanog, was markedly depleted. Analysis of gal/VNPT55-treated CWR22Rv1 xenograft tissue sections also revealed that observations in vitro were recapitulated in vivo. Our results suggest that gal/VNPT55 could become promising agents for the prevention and/or treatment of all stages of prostate cancer.
Therapies cotargeting insulin-like growth factor receptor 1 (IGF-1R) and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) have demonstrated remarkable, albeit short-lived, clinical responses in a subset of Ewing sarcoma (ES) patients. However, the mechanisms of resistance and applicable strategies for overcoming drug resistance to the IGF-1R/mTOR blockade are still undefined.
To elucidate predominant mechanism(s) of acquired drug resistance while identifying synergistic drug combinations that improve clinical efficacy, we generated more than 18 ES cell lines resistant to IGF-1R- or mTOR-targeted therapy. Two small-molecule inhibitors of IGF-1R were chosen, NVP-ADW-742 (IGF-1R-selective) and OSI-906 (a dual IGF-1R/insulin receptor alpha [IR-α] inhibitor). Reverse-phase protein lysate arrays (RPPAs) revealed proteomic changes linked to IGF-1R/mTOR resistance, and selected proteins were validated in cell-based assays, xenografts, and within human clinical samples. All statistical tests were two-sided.
Novel mechanisms of resistance (MOR) emerged after dalotuzumab-, NVP-ADW-742-, and OSI-906-based targeting of IGF-1R. MOR to dalotuzumab included upregulation of IRS1, PI3K, and STAT3, as well as p38 MAPK, which was also induced by OSI-906. pEIF4E(Ser209), a key regulator of Cap-dependent translation, was induced in ridaforolimus-resistant ES cell lines. Unique drug combinations targeting IGF-1R and PI3K-alpha or Mnk and mTOR were synergistic in vivo and vitro (P &lt; .001) as assessed respectively by Mantel-Cox and isobologram testing.
We discovered new druggable targets expressed by chemoresistant ES cells, xenografts, and relapsed human tumors. Joint suppression of these newfound targets, in concert with IGF-1R or mTOR blockade, should improve clinical outcomes.
PADI4 (peptidyl deiminase isoform 4) is overexpressed in many tumor tissues and converts arginine residues to citrulline residues. This study used an Illumina SNP microarray and a TaqMan assay to determine the possible association of the PADI4 gene with various tumor risks. Both genotyping methods demonstrated significant associations between the tag SNPs rs1635566 and rs882537 in the PADI4 locus with gastric carcinoma in two independent cohorts. Based on this genotyping result, we used the Cancer Pathway Finder, p53 Signaling, Signal Transduction and Tumor Metastasis PCR arrays to investigate the tumorigenic pathway of PADI4 in MNK-45 cells derived from gastric carcinoma. We detected significantly decreased expression levels of CXCR2, KRT14 and TNF-α in MNK-45 cells that were treated with anti-PADI4 siRNA. We also detected increased expression of these three genes in MNK-45 cells transfected with a pcDNA3.1 plasmid overexpressing PADI4. A highly similar result was also obtained for SGC 7901 cells, which also originate from gastric carcinoma. Our result indicates that the PADI4 gene has genetic susceptibility in gastric carcinoma. PADI4 contributes to gastric tumorigenesis by upregulating CXCR2, KRT14 and TNF-α expression, which are well known to activate angiogenesis, cell proliferation, cell migration and the immune microenvironment in tumors.
Natural killer (NK) cells have been well known to play a critical role in innate immunity, but they are also capable of regulating adaptive immunity through the induction of T cell-mediated memory response and B cell-mediated autoimmune response. NK cells are differentiated from hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) in the bone marrow (BM), and a series of surface molecules are expressed on NK cells in a differentiation stage-specific manner. Axl receptor tyrosine kinase is originally identified as homeostatic regulators for antigen-presenting cells, and its ligand, growth-arrest-specific gene 6 (Gas6), has been reported to promote cell survival, proliferation, and migration, but their regulatory role in the development and effector function of NK cells is not yet fully understood. In this study, to investigate whether Axl is required for the regulation of NK cell development, the expression of mature NK (mNK) cell-specific receptors and NK cell-associated genes was analyzed in the differentiated HSCs-derived NK cells in vitro and the NK cells harvested from Axl(-/-) mice. We found that agonistic anti-Axl antibody or recombinant Gas6 specifically upregulated the expression of mNK cell-specific receptors, such as LY49A, Ly49G2, Ly49C/F/I, NKG2A/C/E (1.5- to 3.5-fold increase), and NK cell-associated genes, such as IL-2Rβ (2.3- or 2.4-fold increase), Perforin (4.1- or 2.1-fold increase), IL-15Rα (2.14- or 2.04-fold increase), and IFN-γ (3.3- or 2.8-fold increase) compared to each isotype control, whereas it was abrogated by treatment of Axl-Ig. Anti-Axl antibody or rGas6 also induced a 2.5- or 1.9-fold increase in the proliferation of developing NK cells compared to each control, respectively. mNK cell populations expressing mNK cell-specific receptors were reduced about twofold in NK cells differentiated from HSCs of Axl(-/-) mice compared with those of wild-type mice. Furthermore, the triggering of Axl signaling by agonistic anti-Axl antibody promoted the cytolytic activity (1.5- to 1.9-fold increase) against target tumor cells. In B16F10 melanoma-bearing mice, the number of metastatic colonies was decreased by 83 % by the administration of mNK cells treated with anti-Axl antibody compared to control Ig. These data suggest that Axl plays an essential role in the regulation of NK cell development as well as NK effector function.
The eukaryotic translation initiation factor (eIF) 4E, which binds to the 5'-cap of mRNA, undergoes phosphorylation on a single conserved serine, executed by the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)-interacting kinases (MNKs). However, the functional consequences and physiological roles of MNK signalling have remained obscure. Now, new pharmacological and genetic tools have provided unprecedented insights into the function of MNKs and eIF4E phosphorylation. The studies suggest that MNKs control the translation of specific mRNAs in cancer metastasis and neuronal synaptic plasticity by a novel mechanism involving the regulation of the translational repressor, cytoplasmic fragile-X protein-interacting protein 1 (CYFIP1). These recent breakthroughs go a long way to resolving the longstanding enigma and controversy surrounding the function of the MNK-eIF4E axis in cancer cell biology and neurobiology.
Multiple hypotheses are available to explain recruitment rate. Model selection methods can be used to identify the best model that supports a particular hypothesis. However, using a single model for estimating recruitment success is often inadequate for overexploited population because of high model uncertainty. In this study, stock-recruitment data of small yellow croaker in the East China Sea collected from fishery dependent and independent surveys between 1992 and 2012 were used to examine density-dependent effects on recruitment success. Model selection methods based on frequentist (AIC, maximum adjusted R2 and P-values) and Bayesian (Bayesian model averaging, BMA) methods were applied to identify the relationship between recruitment and environment conditions. Interannual variability of the East China Sea environment was indicated by sea surface temperature ( SST) , meridional wind stress (MWS), zonal wind stress (ZWS), sea surface pressure (SPP) and runoff of Changjiang River ( RCR). Mean absolute error, mean squared predictive error and continuous ranked probability score were calculated to evaluate the predictive performance of recruitment success. The results showed that models structures were not consistent based on three kinds of model selection methods, predictive variables of models were spawning abundance and MWS by AIC, spawning abundance by P-values, spawning abundance, MWS and RCR by maximum adjusted R2. The recruitment success decreased linearly with stock abundance (P &lt; 0.01), suggesting overcompensation effect in the recruitment success might be due to cannibalism or food competition. Meridional wind intensity showed marginally significant and positive effects on the recruitment success (P = 0.06), while runoff of Changjiang River showed a marginally negative effect (P = 0.07). Based on mean absolute error and continuous ranked probability score, predictive error associated with models obtained from BMA was the smallest amongst different approaches, while that from models selected based on the P-value of the independent variables was the highest. However, mean squared predictive error from models selected based on the maximum adjusted R2 was highest. We found that BMA method could improve the prediction of recruitment success, derive more accurate prediction interval and quantitatively evaluate model uncertainty.
Archaeal membrane lipids known as glycerol dibiphytanyl glycerol tetraethers (GDGTs) are the basis of the TEX86 paleotemperature proxy. Because GDGTs preserved in marine sediments are thought to originate mainly from planktonic, ammonia-oxidizing Thaumarchaeota, the basis of the correlation between TEX86 and sea surface temperature (SST) remains unresolved: How does TEX86 predict surface temperatures, when maximum thaumarchaeal activity occurs below the surface mixed layer and TEX86 does not covary with in situ growth temperatures? Here we used isothermal studies of the model thaumarchaeon Nitrosopumilus maritimus SCM1 to investigate how GDGT composition changes in response to ammonia oxidation rate. We used continuous culture methods to avoid potential confounding variables that can be associated with experiments in batch cultures. The results show that the ring index scales inversely (R(2) = 0.82) with ammonia oxidation rate (ϕ), indicating that GDGT cyclization depends on available reducing power. Correspondingly, the TEX86 ratio decreases by an equivalent of 5.4 °C of calculated temperature over a 5.5 fmol·cell(-1)·d(-1) increase in ϕ. This finding reconciles other recent experiments that have identified growth stage and oxygen availability as variables affecting TEX86 Depth profiles from the marine water column show minimum TEX86 values at the depth of maximum nitrification rates, consistent with our chemostat results. Our findings suggest that the TEX86 signal exported from the water column is influenced by the dynamics of ammonia oxidation. Thus, the global TEX86-SST calibration potentially represents a composite of regional correlations based on nutrient dynamics and global correlations based on archaeal community composition and temperature.
Many of the molecular proxies commonly used for paleoenvironmental reconstruction are focused on a limited set of glycerol ether lipids, mainly due to the lack of more comprehensive analytical methods and instrumentation able to deal with a more diverse range of species. In this study, we describe an FTICR-MS-based method for rapid, nontargeted screening of ether lipid biomarkers in recent marine sediments. This method involves simplified sample preparation and enables rapid identification of known and novel ether lipid species. Using this method, we were able to identify complete series of core glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers (GDGTs with 0 to 8 alicyclic rings), including the complete resolution of GDGT-4 and the unexpected detection of GDGTs with more than 5 rings, in sediments from mesophilic marine environments (sea surface temperature, SST, of 24-25 °C). Additionally, mono- and dihydroxy-GDGT analogs (including novel species with &gt;2 rings), as well as glycerol dialkanol diethers, GDDs (including novel species with &gt;5 rings) were detected. Finally, we putatively identified other, previously unreported groups of glycerol ether lipid species. Adequacy of the APPI-P FTICR-MS data for the determination of commonly used GDGT-based proxy indices was demonstrated. The results of this study show great potential for the use of FTICR-MS as both a rapid method for determining existing proxy indices and, perhaps more importantly, as a tool for the early detection of possible new biomarkers and proxies that may establish novel geochemical relationships between archaeal ether lipids and key environmental-, energy-, and climate-related system variables.
Reproductive success of seabirds is tightly associated with availability of their prey for which the spatiotemporal distribution may be influenced by sea surface temperature (SST) fluctuations. The objective of this study was to investigate whether Northern gannets (Morus bassanus) from the largest colony in North America (Bonaventure Island, Quebec, Canada) were in negative nutritional state during the unprecedented low reproductive success year of 2012, and whether this was associated with changes in SST anomalies and diet. The incubation period of gannets in 2012 was characterized by a significant decline, from early to late incubation, in plasma triglyceride levels that was associated with an increase in plasma corticosterone levels. However, no changes in plasma glycerol and β-hydroxybutyrate levels were noted. SST anomalies recorded in this area (south of the Gulf of St. Lawrence) during the breeding period were consistently higher in 2012 compared to the previous year (a better reproductive success year). Based on signatures of stable carbon (δ(13)C) and nitrogen (δ(15)N) isotopes in gannet red blood cells and in whole fish homogenates of three major preys (mackerel, herring, and capelin), a minor dietary shift was noted between those years and incubation periods. In light of these findings, it is suggested that the extreme warm-water perturbation event that prevailed in the Gulf of St. Lawrence during summer 2012 was associated with a rapid deterioration of nutritional condition of Bonaventure Island gannets during the incubation. These suboptimal physiological changes likely contributed to the dramatic decline in reproductive success reported in this colony.
Assessment of function is the cornerstone of clinical shoulder research. This purpose of this study was to answer 3 relevant questions: How does subjective patient assessment of shoulder function correlate with objectively measured active shoulder range of motion? What is the difference in active motion between shoulders that can and those that cannot be used to perform each of the functions of the Simple Shoulder Test (SST)? Does the relationship between subjective and objective assessment of shoulder function differ between male and female patients?
We analyzed the relationship between objective range-of-motion measurements recorded by the observer-independent Kinect motion capture system and SST patient self-assessments of shoulder function of 74 male and 30 female patients with osteoarthritis.
There was poor correlation between objective measurements of active abduction and total SST scores of osteoarthritic shoulders of patients seen before shoulder surgery: the coefficients of determination (R) were 0.29 for the osteoarthritic shoulders of women and 0.25 for those of men. The relationships between active abduction and total SST score were closer for the contralateral shoulders (R = 0.54 for women and R = 0.46 for men). The difference in active abduction between the osteoarthritic shoulders that allowed and those that did not allow the patient to perform the individual SST functions was significant (p &lt; 0.05) for only 4 of the 12 functions in the female group and 5 of 12 in the male group because of the highly variable relationship between self-assessed function and active abduction. In contrast, when the contralateral shoulders were assessed, this difference was found to be significant for 10 of the 12 functions in the female group and all 12 of the functions in the male group. The relationship between objective motion and subjective function did not differ significantly between male and female subjects.
The self-assessed function of osteoarthritic shoulders of women and men is only partially determined by the active range of abduction. Both subjective and objective measurements are important in characterizing the clinical status of shoulders. Studies of treatment outcomes should include separate assessments of these 2 complementary aspects of shoulder function.
Therapeutic Level IV. See Instructions for Authors for a complete description of levels of evidence.
The purpose of this work is to evaluate the results of arthroscopic capsulolabroplasty in patients affected by atraumatic shoulder instability (ASI).
A retrospective review was performed of 10 patients (7 women and 3 men) who underwent arthroscopic treatment of symptomatic ASI. Mean age at evaluation was 27.9 (19-35) years and the mean follow-up was 23.3 (12-37) months. We evaluated recurrence rate, range of movement, apprehension and relocation tests, hyperlaxity, and sport activity. The ASES score, the Rowe score, the Simple Shoulder Test (SST) and Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) were also used as outcomes measure.
None of the patients experienced episodes of dislocation or subluxation after surgery. The apprehension and relocation tests produced positive results in 2 patients. Six out of 10 patients reported apprehension with the arm in specific positions. The ASES mean score was 93.4 (55-100); the Rowe mean score was 85.5 (70-100); the SST mean score was 9.1 (5.8-10). On average, external rotation is reduced by 10° in adduction, and by 8° in abduction in 6 out of 10 patients; internal rotation is reduced on average by 6.6° in abduction with the arm abducted, and was overall limited in 6 out of 10 patients.
Arthroscopic capsulolabroplasty ensures excellent results in patients showing atraumatic shoulder instability in terms of recurrence. Still, an underlying insecurity persists and the risk of residual stiffness is tangible.

Saliva plays a pivotal role as an antioxidant system, and saliva antioxidant levels are reduced in patients with periodontal disease. Recently, a biochemical test able to determine saliva antioxidant levels was proposed as predictive for oral cavity diseases, but it was not clinically tested. In this preliminary study, we evaluated the relationships between Periodontal Screening and Recordings characteristics of patients and saliva antioxidant levels measures.
Thirty-nine patients (12 men, 27 women; mean age, 46 years, SD 17) attending the dental hygiene unit of a Private Clinic underwent a Periodontal Screening and Recordings examination and a saliva antioxidant levels measurement using a biochemical commercial test. The results of the clinical periodontal examination were compared to those obtained by the saliva test.
Approximately 70% of patients showed a low saliva antioxidant levels value, while the other patients had Optimal/Normal values. Thirteen patients (33%) resulted positive to Periodontal Screening and Recordings test. Using Periodontal Screening and Recordings values as gold standard, the saliva antioxidant levels test correctly classified 52.6% of patients; sensitivity was 84.6%, specificity was 36%.
The saliva antioxidant levels test had a good sensitivity when compared to the gold standard; this finding corroborates the hypothesis that alterations of the oral antioxidant levels are related to periodontal disease. The reduced specificity shows that saliva antioxidant levels test could detect alterations predisposing to periodontal disease before clinically evident aspects.
To report the clinical and radiological outcomes of arthroscopic suture bridge repair for the GT fractures of the shoulder joint.
From March 2008 to July 2013, we performed arthroscopic suture bridge repair of the GT fractures displaced more than 5 mm superiorly or posteriorly, but less than 2 cm in 40 cases [20 men, 20 women; mean age, 56 (27-80) years] with the average 32 (24-48) months follow-up. At the final follow-up, clinical (ASES, UCLA, SST, KSS score and range of motions) and radiological outcomes using post-operative MRI or CT scan were evaluated. Associated injuries occurred in 21 cases (52.5%): 8 rotator cuff tears; 7 SLAP lesions; 3 glenoid rim fractures; 3 Bankart lesions; 5 biceps tendon tears; 1 partial subscapularis tear; 1 combined subscapularis and biceps tendon tear, and 1 brachial plexus injury.
At the final follow-up, the mean VAS score improved from 7 to 1; ASES, to 92; UCLA, to 32; KSS, to 90; and SST, to 10. Mean forward flexion, abduction, external rotation at the side, and internal rotation at the back were improved to 157°, 157°, 37° and T11, respectively. Mean residual superior and posterior displacement of the fracture was 0 (range -5 to 3.3) mm and 0.1 (-5.5 to 3.2) mm, respectively, compared to pre-operative displacement of 4.9 (0-14) mm and 4.5 (0-20) mm, respectively (p &lt; 0.001). Complications included anchor protrusion in five cases.
Arthroscopic suture bridge repair was useful for the treatment of displaced GT fractures with or without comminution and the management of the combined lesions. At the final follow-up, meaningful remodeling of the GT fracture and satisfactory clinical outcomes could be achieved.
The functional benefits of double-row (DR) versus single-row (SR) rotator cuff repair are not clearly established.
To examine the effect of DR versus SR rotator cuff repair on functional outcomes and strength recovery in patients with full-thickness tears.
Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 2.
Forty-nine patients were randomized to DR or SR repairs; 36 patients (13 women, 23 men; mean age, 62 ± 7 years; 20 SR, 16 DR) were assessed at a mean 2.2 ± 1.6 years after surgery (range, 1-7 years; tear size: 17 medium, 13 large, 9 massive). The following data were recorded prior to surgery and at follow-up: Penn shoulder score, American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES), and Simple Shoulder Test (SST) results; range of motion (ROM) for shoulder flexion, external rotation (ER) at 0° and 90° of abduction, and internal rotation (IR) at 90° of abduction; and shoulder strength (Lafayette manual muscle tester) in empty- and full-can tests, abduction, and ER at 0° of abduction. Treatment (SR vs DR) × time (pre- vs postoperative) mixed-model analysis of variance was used to assess the effect of rotator cuff repair.
Rotator cuff repair markedly improved Penn, ASES, and SST scores (P &lt; .001), with similar improvement between SR and DR repairs (treatment × time, P = .38-.10) and excellent scores at follow-up (DR vs SR: Penn, 91 ± 11 vs 92 ± 11 [P = .73]; ASES, 87 ± 12 vs 92 ± 12 [P = .21]; SST, 11.4 ± 1.0 vs 11.3 ± 1.0 [P = .76]). Patients with DR repairs lost ER ROM at 0° of abduction (preoperative to final follow-up, 7° ± 10° loss [P = .013]). ER ROM did not significantly change with SR repair (5° ± 14° gain, P = .16; treatment by time, P = .008). This effect was not apparent for ER ROM at 90° of abduction (treatment × time, P = .26). IR ROM improved from preoperative to final follow-up (P &lt; .01; SR, 17° ± 27°; DR, 7° ± 21°; treatment × time, P = .23). Rotator cuff repair markedly improved strength in empty-can (54%), full-can (66%), abduction (47%), and ER (54%) strength (all P &lt; .001), with no difference between SR and DR repairs (P = .23-.75). All clinical tests with the exception of the lift-off test were normalized at follow-up (P &lt; .05).
Outcomes were not different between SR or DR repair, with generally excellent outcomes for both groups. Rotator cuff repair and subsequent rehabilitation markedly improved shoulder strength.
Loperamide is the most commonly used antidiarrhoeal medication in the UK. We report a serious and hitherto undocumented adverse effect of chronic use in a 45-year-old man with inflammatory bowel disease. He presented to the endocrine clinic with fatigue and low libido; biochemical assessment revealed hypogonadism and adrenal insufficiency without any elevated adrenocorticotropic hormone. When symptoms allowed, loperamide was reduced and a short synacthen test (SST) showed a 'clear pass' with a normal peak cortisol of 833 nmol/L. Later, worsening diarrhoea necessitated an escalation in loperamide use again. While taking a daily dose of 15-20 mg (recommended daily maximum 16 mg) reassessment revealed a fall in peak cortisol on SST to 483 nmol/L, a subnormal response. Clinicians should exercise caution when relying on loperamide to manage their patients' chronic diarrhoea and remain mindful of the possibility of drug-induced life-threatening adrenal insufficiency.
Women are twice as likely to be diagnosed with major depressive disorder (MDD) compared to men, but the molecular mechanisms underlying this sex difference are unclear. Previous studies in the human postmortem brain suggest dysfunction in basolateral amygdala (BLA) inhibitory gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) signaling and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) function, specifically in females with MDD.
We investigated the effects of sex chromosome complement, developmental gonadal sex, and circulating testosterone on expression of 3 GABA-related and 2 BDNF-related genes in the BLA using three cohorts of four core genotypes (FCG) mice. Cohort 1 included gonadally intact pre-pubertal FCG mice; results were analyzed using two-way ANOVA (sex chromosome complement-by-gonadal sex). We examined the same genes under adult non-stressed (cohort 2) and chronically stressed conditions (cohort 3). The results for cohorts 2 and 3 were analyzed by three-way ANOVA (sex chromosome complement-by-gonadal sex-by-hormone). The use of heatmaps and Spearman correlation of BLA gene expression and anxiety-like behavior provides a global interpretation of gene expression patterns.
In weanlings, we found an effect of sex chromosome complement, with lower expression of GABA/BDNF-related genes in XY mice. Most of these effects did not persist into adulthood, although a number of interesting interactions between organizational and activational effects of hormones emerged. In our adult cohorts, we found that testosterone had different effects depending on stress conditions and/or gonadal sex. Notably, in our chronically stressed adults, we found that the BLA pattern of gene expression for the GABA-related gene, somatostatin (Sst), matched the anxiety-like behavior pattern (i.e., lower Sst and higher anxiety-like behavior in XY mice, while testosterone increased Sst and decreased anxiety-like behavior). Additionally, increased Sst gene expression was correlated with decreased anxiety-like behavior.
Sex chromosome complement is an important factor modulating expression of mood-related genes during pre-pubertal development. The observed sex differences under chronically stressed conditions suggest that different molecular profiles may characterize male and female MDD. Our findings here for Sst are especially interesting, and suggest an underlying XY vulnerability that is typically compensated for by circulating testosterone in "normal" males. Without testosterone, women may have lower SST expression in the amygdala, resulting in increased MDD vulnerability.
HIV self-testing (HIVST) offers an opportunity to increase HIV testing among people not reached by facility-based services. However, the promotion of HIVST is limited as a consequence of insufficient community engagement. We built a social entrepreneurship testing (SET) model to promote HIVST linkage to care among Chinese men who have sex with men (MSM) in Guangzhou.
The SET model includes a few key steps. Each participant first completed an online survey, and paid a US$23 (refundable) deposit to receive an HIVST kit and a syphilis self-testing (SST) kit. After the testing, the results were sent to the platform by the participants and interpreted by Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) staff. Meanwhile, the deposit was returned to each participant. Finally, the Community based organizations (CBO) contacted the participants to provide counselling services, confirmation testing and linkage to care.
During April-June 2015, a total of 198 MSM completed a preliminary survey and purchased self-testing kits. The majority were aged &lt; 34 years (84.4%) and met partners online (93.1%). In addition, 68.9% of participants had ever been tested for HIV, and 19.5% had ever performed HIVST. Overall, feedback was received from 192 participants (97.0%). Of these participants, 14 people did not use the kits; among those who did use the kits, the HIV and syphilis prevalences were 4.5% (eight of 178) and 3.7% (six of 178), respectively. All of the screened HIV-positive individuals sought further confirmation testing and were linked to care.
Using an online SET model to promote HIV and syphilis self-testing among Chinese MSM is acceptable and feasible, and this model adds a new testing platform to the current testing service system.
Surgery for primary lung cancer invading the spine remains challenging. Here, we present a case of superior sulcus tumor (SST) with vertebral invasion, successfully resected with total vertebrectomy (Th2) and dissection of involved apical chest wall and the subclavian artery (SCA).
A 62-year-old man was referred with the diagnosis of lung squamous cell carcinoma originating from left upper lobe (clinical stage IIIA/T4N0M0) involving the thoracic vertebrae (Th2) as well as the apical chest wall including three ribs (1st, 2nd and 3rd) and SCA. After induction concurrent chemo-radiotherapy, we achieved complete resection by three-step surgical procedures as follows: first, the anterior portion of involved chest wall including SCA was dissected through the trans-manubrial approach (TMA); next, the posterior portion of involved chest wall including ribs was dissected and left upper lobectomy with nodal dissection was performed through posterolateral thoracotomy; finally, total vertebrectomy (Th2) was performed through posterior mid-line approach.
This tumor was existence of anterior and posterior position in pulmonary apex region. So that, it is very important for complete resecting this complicated tumor to work out operation's strategy.
Surgery may be indicated for SST invading the spine, when complete resection is expected.
Background. Climate change concurrent with anthropogenic disturbances can initiate serial changes that reverberate up the food chain with repercussions for fisheries. To date, there is no information available concerning the combined effects of global warming and human impacts on tropical marine food webs. While temperate copepods respond differently to warming and environmental stressors, the extent to which tropical copepods can adapt to rising temperature of already warm waters remains unknown. We hypothesize that sea warming and other anthropogenic disturbances over the long term will have the greatest impact on the copepod community in nearshore waters where their effects are accentuated, and therefore vulnerable and resilient species could be identified. Methods. Zooplankton samples were collected during two time periods (1985-86 and 2014-15) interposed by marked anthropogenic disturbances, and at the same five stations located progressively from inshore to offshore in Klang Strait, Malaysia, following the asymmetrical before-after-control-impact (BACI) design. Copepods were identified to species, and results were interpreted by univariate (ANOVA) and multivariate (PERMANOVA, PCO) analyses of the computed species abundance and diversity measures. Results. Copepod total abundance was not significantly different among stations but higher after disturbance than before disturbance. However, changes in the abundance of particular species and the community structure between time periods were dramatic. Coastal large-bodied calanoid species (e.g., Acartia spinicauda, Calanopia thompsoni, Pseudodiaptomus bowmani and Tortanus forcipatus) were the most vulnerable group to disturbance. This however favored the opportunistic species (e.g., Oithona simplex, O. attenuata, Hemicyclops sp., Pseudomacrochiron sp. and Microsetella norvegica). Small-bodied copepods (e.g., Paracalanus sp., Parvocalanus crassirostris and Euterpina acutifrons) were unaffected. Centropages tenuiremis was likely an introduced species. There was no significant loss in species richness of copepods despite the dramatic changes in community structure. Discussion. Sea warming and other human-induced effects such as eutrophication, acidification and coastal habitat degradation are likely the main factors that have altered copepod community structure. The large-bodied estuarine and coastal calanoid copepods are surmised to be vulnerable to eutrophication and hypoxia, while both resilient and opportunistic species are largely unaffected by, or adaptable to, degraded coastal environments and observed sea surface temperature (SST) rise. It is forecasted that SST rise with unmitigated anthropogenic impacts will further reduce large-bodied copepod species the favoured food for fish larvae with dire consequences for coastal fish production.
In radiotherapy, a commercial bolus often does not provide a suitable fit over irregular surfaces. To address this issue, we fabricated a customized bolus using 3D printing technology. The aim of our study was to evaluate the application of this 3D-printed bolus in a clinical setting. The patient was a 45-year-old man with recurrent Kimura's disease involving the auricle, receiving radiotherapy in our oncology department. A customized bolus, 5mm in thickness, was fabricated based on reconstruction of computed tomography (CT) images. The bolus was printed on a Dimension 1200 series SST 3D printer. Repeat CT-based simulation indicated an acceptable fit of the 3D-printed bolus to the target region, with a maximum air gap of less than 5mm at the tragus. Most of the surface area of the target region was covered by the 95% isodose line. The plan with the 3D-printed bolus improved target coverage compared to that without a bolus. And the plan with the 3D-printed bolus yielded comparable results to those with the paraffin wax bolus. In conclusion, a customized bolus using a 3D printer was successfully applied to an irregular surface.
Despite the numerous common pathways connecting blood pressure regulation to somatostatin (SST) metabolism, the SST gene has never been seen as a significant blood pressure modulator. The aim of this study was to evaluate the association between a poly-T repeat sequence (rs34872250) in the promoter of the SST gene and blood pressure, according to the obesity status. We genotyped 1918 French-Canadian subjects from a founder population. Analyses were performed according to the length of the poly-T repeat sequence on both alleles and divided into two groups, the 13/13-13/14 group and the 13/15-13/16 group. The effect of age, gender, body mass index, antihypertensive drugs and diabetic status were considered. Systolic, diastolic and mean blood pressures are significantly higher among the 13/15-13/16 group in the whole sample (P&lt;0.05). Whereas the differences remain significant in women, they turn to be non-significant when men are considered alone. The risk of hypertension is increased in the 13/15-13/16 group, particularly among overweight/obese subjects. Systolic blood pressure is significantly higher among overweight/obese carriers of the 13/15-13/16 alleles in the whole sample (P&lt;0.001), in men (P=0.006) and in women (P=0.002), even after correction for age and antihypertensive drugs. These results suggest that the poly-T repeat sequence polymorphism in the promoter of the SST gene is associated with significant variations of blood pressure and could modulate the risk of hypertension, particularly among women.
We analyzed complications and failures of final full-arch implant-supported rehabilitations, comparing resin and zirconia prosthesis materials. Prostheses were retrospectively followed up for 5 years.
One hundred twenty-five patients who received one or two four to six implant-supported immediately loaded full-arch rehabilitations in resin (166 prostheses) or zirconia (48 prostheses) were analyzed.
One hundred thirteen patients (53 men, 60 women), with 214 full-arch prostheses (105 maxillary, 109 mandibular), were analyzed. During the follow-up interval, the prosthesis annual complication rate was 6.6%, free complications survival was 75.5% (60 months). Age, number of implants, and prosthesis material did not influence complication risk. Men had a higher risk of complications than women. Prosthesis annual failure rate was 4.6%, free survival was 85.5% (60 months). Age, number of implants, and prosthesis material did not influence failure risk. Men and maxillary arch prostheses had a higher risk of failures than women and mandibular arch prostheses.
Implant-supported, immediately loaded full-arch rehabilitations supporting resin or zirconia based prostheses were clinically successful in a 5-year follow-up. Prosthesis material did not influence complication risk.
The purpose of the present study was to describe the use of a novel hybrid surgical technique-arthroscopic-assisted plate fixation-and evaluate its clinical and anatomical outcomes in the management of large, displaced greater tuberosity (GT) fractures with comminution.
From 2009 to 2011, this novel technique was performed in 11 patients [2 men and 9 women; median age, 64 years (range 41-83 years)] with large, comminuted GT fractures, with fragment displacements of &gt;5 mm. The preoperative mean posterior and superior migration of the fractured fragment, as measured on computed tomography (CT), was 19.5 and 5.5 mm, respectively. Two patients had shoulder fracture-dislocation, and three had associated undisplaced surgical neck fracture. The mean duration between injury and surgery was 4 days. The mean follow-up duration was 26 months.
At the final follow-up, the mean postoperative ASES, UCLA and SST scores were 84, 29, and 8, respectively. The mean range of motion was as follows: forward flexion, 138°; abduction, 135°; external rotation at the side, 19°; and internal rotation, up to the L2 level. The mean posterior and superior displacements of fracture fragments on postoperative CT scan [0.7 ± 0.8 mm (range 0-2.1 mm) and 2.8 ± 0.5 mm (range 3.4-5.3 mm), respectively] were significantly improved (p &lt; 0.05). On arthroscopy, a partial articular-side supraspinatus tendon avulsion lesion was identified in 10 of 11 patients (91 %), and 1 of these patients had a partial tear of the biceps and 1 had a partial subscapularis tear, respectively (9 %). Intraoperatively, 1 anchor pullout and 1 anchor protrusion through the humeral head were noted and corrected. Postoperatively, the loss of reduction in the fracture fragment was noted in 1 patient at 4 weeks, after corrective reduction and fixation surgery.
The novel arthroscopic-assisted anatomical plate fixation technique was found to be effective in reducing large-sized, displaced, comminuted GT fractures and in allowing concurrent management of intra-articular pathologies and early functional rehabilitation. Compared with the conventional plate fixation or arthroscopic suture anchor fixation technique, arthroscopic-assisted plate fixation enabled accurate restoration of the medial footprint of the GT fracture and provided an effective buttress to the large-sized GT fracture fragments.
Retrospective clinical study, Level IV.
Participant adoption and maintenance is a major challenge in strength training (ST) programs in the community-setting. In adults who were overweight or with type 2 diabetes (T2DM), the aim of this study was to compare the effectiveness of a standard ST program (SST) to an enhanced program (EST) on the adoption and maintenance of ST and cardio-metabolic risk factors and muscle strength.
A 12-month cluster-randomized controlled trial consisting of a 6-month adoption phase followed by a 6-month maintenance phase. In 2008-2009, men and women aged 40-75 years (n = 318) with T2DM (n = 117) or a BMI &gt;25 (n = 201) who had not participated in ST previously were randomized into either a SST or an EST program (which included additional motivationally-tailored behavioral counselling). Adoption and maintenance were defined as undertaking ≥ 3 weekly gym-based exercise sessions during the first 6-months and from 6-12 months respectively and were assessed using a modified version of the CHAMPS (Community Healthy Activity Models Program for Seniors) instrument.
Relative to the SST group, the adjusted odds ratio (OR) of adopting ST for all participants in the EST group was 3.3 (95 % CI 1.2 to 9.4). In stratified analyses including only those with T2DM, relative to the SST group, the adjusted OR of adopting ST in the EST group was 8.2 (95 % CI 1.5-45.5). No significant between-group differences were observed for maintenance of ST in either pooled or stratified analyses. In those with T2DM, there was a significant reduction in HbA1c in the EST compared to SST group during the adoption phase (net difference, -0.13 % [-0.26 to -0.01]), which persisted after 12-months (-0.17 % [-0.3 to -0.05]).
A behaviorally-focused community-based EST intervention was more effective than a SST program for the adoption of ST in adults with excess weight or T2DM and led to greater improvements in glycemic control in those with T2DM.

The double-row rotator cuff repair is discussed controversially. Despite improved biomechanical properties, reduced re-tear rates and higher costs, no significant difference compared to single-row fixation in the clinical results is found. Mid-term results of an open double-row fixation with titanium anchor screws are presented.
237 patients (m = 142, f = 95, median age: 56.3 years) were operated in 2007 with this technique by the senior author (M. G.). Preoperatively, 2 years and 4,5 years postoperatively a subjective shoulder score (SSG) with follow-up rates of 86, 87 and 83 %, was evaluated. 5.1 years postoperatively an objective evaluation of 131 patients using the Constant-Murley scores (CS), the simple shoulder tests (SST), Gerber's shoulder value and the evaluation with school grades followed. The integrity of the cuff was checked with ultrasound. The absolute (re-tears and partial re-tears) and the relative (re-tears, partial re-tears, thinning and thickening of the cuff) re-tear rates were evaluated.
In SSG a highly significant improvement from 51 to 83 points was found (p &lt; 0.001). In CS 80 points (min.: 18; max.: 100), and in SST 11 points (min.: 2; max.: 12) were achieved. The shoulder value of Gerber increased significantly from preoperative 28.1 to 84.5 % 5.1 years postoperative (p &lt; 0.001).The absolute re-tear rate, evaluated in ultrasound was 7.6 %, the relative re-tear rate 17.6 %. For primary rotator cuff reconstructions a higher CS with 82 points and a lower relative re-tear rate with 10.5 % were found. The patient's age had no significant influence on the clinical outcome. The rupture size showed a significant impact on the re-tear rate and the scores (p &lt; 0.05). Between the operated and healthy shoulder neither strength nor mobility were found to be significantly different. Men reached a highly significant better strength than women (p &lt; 0.001) which also resulted in a significantly better outcome in the CS (p &lt; 0.01). The costs for open titanium transfixation technique with 330 € per case are markedly less than for arthroscopic suture bridge technique with 600 to 1000 € per case.
Open double-row cuff repair with titanium screws is a safe and cost effective technique with a low re-tear rate with comparable clinical results regarding open and arthroscopic procedures.
Sniffin' Sticks Test (SST) is a comprehensive tool for medical or scientific diagnosis of olfactory sensitivity. Although it is widely used around the world, it is recommended to develop a cultural adaptation of any odor identification test prior to using it in a particular cultural space. The aim of the present work is to adapt SST to Arabic population, running experiments in Egypt. Prospective controlled study. We included 382 people (174 women and 208 men) aged 8-74 years; 323 healthy subjects and 59 patients. The use of original list of odors revealed that four of the descriptors were poorly recognized (&lt;75 %) in Egypt. Accompanied by several control measurements descriptors and targets were replaced with more familiar names. The result of the present study is a modified version of the original SST, adapted to the Arabian space with a high test-re-test reliability. In addition, first tentative normative data are presented for the Arabic population. The 10th percentile for the whole group of healthy subjects equaled 13, whereas in 16-35 age category it equaled 14. The revised SST test can be used in studies on olfactory sensitivity in Arabic populations.

This study examines the associations between objective and subjective measurements and impressions of body shape and cold pressor pain reporting in healthy adults. On the basis of sexual selection theory (SST), we hypothesized that body characteristics that are universally preferred by the opposite sex-specifically, lower waist-to-hip ratios (WHR) in women and higher shoulder-to-hip ratios (SHR) in men-and characteristics (e.g., proportion of body fat in women) that infer attractiveness differently across cultures will correspond to higher experimental pain reporting in women and lower pain reporting in males. A convenience sample of young adults (n = 96, 58 females, 18-24 years; mean age = 19.4) was measured for body mass index (BMI), WHR, SHR, and subjective body impressions (SBI), along with cold pressor pain reporting. The findings showed that BMI was positively associated with WHR and less-positive SBI in both sexes. Consistent with SST, however, only BMI and WHR predicted variability in pain expression in women, whereas only SHR predicted variability in men. Subjective body impressions were positively associated with SHR among males and unrelated to WHR among females, yet only females showed a positive association between SBI and higher pain reporting. The findings suggest that sexually selected physical characteristics (WHR and SHR) and culturally influenced somatic (BMI) and psychological (SBI) indicators of attractiveness correspond with variability in pain reporting, potentially reflecting the general tendency for people to express clusters of sexually selected and culturally influenced traits that may include differential pain perception.
Cephalic hemodynamic assessment is important in initial orthostatic hypotension. We sought to investigate cephalic blood flow (CBF) in the earlobe using a mini laser Doppler flowmeter (LDF) during orthostatic challenge. In addition, we clarified hemodynamic differences during a new active standing protocol using a footstool standing test (FST) with bending of the legs on the footstool in the sitting position to reduce the load of the squatting posture in the conventional squat standing test (SST).
Ten healthy men (21 ± 0.5 years) performed the SST after a 1 min squat and the FST after a 1 min load consisting of bending the legs on a footstool in the sitting position. Earlobe CBF, beat-to-beat arterial blood pressure (ABP), mean arterial blood pressure (MAP), and heart rate (HR) were recorded during each test.
Earlobe CBF showed a transient fall synchronized with the ABP during each test. No significant differences in the recovery times (RTs) of CBF and MAP were observed during the SST (CBF 12.9 ± 0.6 s vs. MAP 12.1 ± 0.5 s, P = 0.313) and FST (CBF 10.6 ± 0.4 s vs. MAP 10.1 ± 0.8 s, P = 0.552). Although the CBF and ABP decreases were not different in each test, the HR increase was significantly lower with the FST (24 ± 2 bpm) than with the SST (31 ± 3 bpm, P &lt; 0.005).
Earlobe CBF reflects the compensatory ABP regulatory response during standing and is potentially useful for estimating the orthostatic ABP response indirectly. Furthermore, the FST is a low-load protocol that can be an effective protocol for a standing test of cardiac function.
Anthropometric measurement is a noninvasive and cost-efficient method for nutritional assessment. The study aims to present age- and gender-specific anthropometric reference data for Swedish elderly in relation to common medical conditions, and also formulate prediction equations for such anthropometric measurements.
A cross-sectional study among random heterogeneous sample of 3360 subjects, aged 60-99 years, from a population study 'Good Aging in Scania. Means (±s.d.) and percentiles for height, weight, waist-, hip-, arm-, calf circumferences, triceps- (TST) and subscapular skinfold thickness (SST), body mass index (BMI), waist-hip ratio (WHR) and arm muscle circumference (AMC) were presented. The values were estimated based on the prevalence of myocardial infarction (MI), cardiac failure (CHF), stroke, cognitive impairment, dementia and dependence in daily living activities (ADL). Linear regression analysis was used to formulate the prediction equations.
Mean BMI was 27.5±5.8 kg/m(2) (men) and 27.2±8.1 kg/m(2) (women). WHR was higher among men (Men: 0.98±0.3, women: 0.87±0.2), except at age 85+ (women: 0.91±0.6). TST was 6.7±0.4 mm higher among women. Men with MI had BMI: 28.6±4.8 kg/m(2) and SST: 21±9.2 mm, whereas subjects with dementia had lower weight (by 9.5±2.9 kg) compared with the non-demented. ADL-dependent women had BMI= 29.0±3.9 kg/m(2), TST=19.2±1.3 mm.
New normative data on gender- and age-specific anthropometrics on the general elderly population are presented. Cardiovascular diseases are associated with subcutaneous and central adiposity opposed to fat loss with dementia. ADL dependence indicates inadequate physical activity. The prediction models could be used as possible indicators monitoring physical activity and adiposity among the general elderly population hence potential health indicators in health promotion.
Osteoarthritis of the shoulder often results in significant posterior glenoid wear. The options for treating this have been eccentric glenoid reaming and occasionally bone grafting. More recently reverse total shoulder arthroplasty (rTSA) with or without bone grafting and posterior augmented glenoids (PAGs) has been introduced. The PAG restores the native joint line while reaming a minimal amount of glenoid bone. The purpose of this study is to compare osteoarthritic shoulders with significant posterior glenoid wear treated with anatomic total shoulder arthroplasty (aTSA) using a PAG to shoulders without glenoid wear treated with aTSA using a standard all poly pegged glenoid.
The patients' data in this study were retrospectively queried from prospectively acquired data in a multi-institutional IRB approved database. The study population consisted of 24 patients with osteoarthritis and posterior glenoid wear who were treated with aTSA using a PAG with a minimum of two-year follow-up. This population was age, sex, and follow-up matched to patients treated with an all poly non-augmented pegged glenoid (NAG) for osteoarthritis. Seven females and 17 males with an average age of 65.8 ± 11.5 years received a posterior augmented glenoid. The control group consisted of 7 females and 17 males with an average age of 66.4 ± 9.1 years who underwent aTSA for osteoarthritis using an all poly standard glenoid. These age, gender, and follow-up matched patients were evaluated and scored preoperatively and at latest follow-up using the SST, UCLA, ASES, Constant, and SPADI scoring metrics; active abduction, elevation, and external rotation were also measured. A Grashey and axillary lateral radiograph was evaluated at two-year follow-up. The Shoulder Arthroplasty Subluxation Index was used to determine the degree of humeral component subluxation on the glenoid component. A Student's two-tailed, unpaired t-test was used to identify differences in preoperative and postoperative results, where p &lt; 0.05 denoted a significant difference.
All patients demonstrated significant improvements in pain and function with the primary aTSA. Sixty per-cent of PAG shoulders had a radiolucent line with an average radiographic line score of 1.10, and 33.3% of NAG had a radiolucent line with an average radiographic line score of 0.438. One glenoid in the PAG group is radiographically but not clinically loose. In the PAG group, the Grashey view showed that 18/20 humeral heads were centered with the two remaining joints demonstrating superior subluxation. On the axillary lateral in the PAG group, 17/20 humeral heads were centered, and three were anteriorly subluxated; none were posteriorly subluxated. There were no differences in any of the measured postoperative clinical outcomes or any difference in improvement between the two groups.
At a minimum of two-year follow-up, there were no statistical clinical differences between the PAG and NAG groups despite the PAG group being disadvantaged with posterior worn glenoids. There were no revisions in either group. No humeral heads resubluxated posteriorly. The PAG group had a higher incidence of lucent lines. Based on this short-term follow-up, a posterior augmented glenoid is a viable option for the posterior worn osteoarthritic glenoid.
The in situ hybridization Allen Mouse Brain Atlas was mined for proteases expressed in the somatosensory cerebral cortex. Among the 480 genes coding for protease/peptidases, only four were found enriched in cortical interneurons: Reln coding for reelin; Adamts8 and Adamts15 belonging to the class of metzincin proteases involved in reshaping the perineuronal net (PNN) and Mme encoding for Neprilysin, the enzyme degrading amyloid β-peptides. The pattern of expression of metalloproteases (MPs) was analyzed by single-cell reverse transcriptase multiplex PCR after patch clamp and was compared with the expression of 10 canonical interneurons markers and 12 additional genes from the Allen Atlas. Clustering of these genes by K-means algorithm displays five distinct clusters. Among these five clusters, two fast-spiking interneuron clusters expressing the calcium-binding protein Pvalb were identified, one co-expressing Pvalb with Sst (PV-Sst) and another co-expressing Pvalb with three metallopeptidases Adamts8, Adamts15 and Mme (PV-MP). By using Wisteria floribunda agglutinin, a specific marker for PNN, PV-MP interneurons were found surrounded by PNN, whereas the ones expressing Sst, PV-Sst, were not.
In this work, the influence of the different S═O, S-O, N⋯H, O⋯H, Na⋯O bonds present in the structures of the powerful laxative drug, sodium picosulphate in gas and aqueous solution phases were studied combining the density functional theory (DFT) calculations with the experimental available infrared, (1)H NMR and UV-visible spectra. The structural, topological, electronic and vibrational properties were investigated in both media by using the hybrid B3LYP/6-31G* method and the integral equation formalism variant polarised continuum model (IEFPCM). Here, the characteristics of the S═O, S-O, N⋯H, O⋯H, Na⋯O bonds were completely revealed by using atomic charges, natural bond orbital (NBO) and atoms in molecules (AIM) studies. The infrared, (1)H NMR, (13)C NMR and UV-visible spectra are in reasonable concordance with those experimental available in the literature. The vibrational analysis of sodium picosulphate was performed considering C3V symmetries for both SO4(2-) groups and the complete assignments of the 126 vibration modes were reported in gas phase and aqueous solution together with their corresponding force fields. In addition, the reactivities of sodium picosulfate increase in solution due to their ionic characteristic which probably justifies their behaviour as a stimulant cathartic and their easy metabolic conversion, as reported in the literature.
Capillary electrophoresis sodium dodecyl sulfate (CE-SDS) is widely used for purity analysis of monoclonal antibody therapeutics for release and stability to demonstrate product consistency and shelf life during the manufacturing and life cycle of the product. CE-SDS method development is focused on exploring the method capability to provide the information about the product purity and product related degradants (fragmentation, aggregation etc.). In order to establish the functionality of the instrumentation, software, and sample preparation; system suitability criteria need to be defined for analytical methods using a well characterized reference standard run under the same protocol and analysis as the test articles. Typically the reference standard is produced using a manufacturing process representative of the clinical material. The qualification, control, and maintenance of in-house reference standards are established through rigorous quality and regulatory guidelines. The U.S. Pharmacopeia (USP) has developed a monoclonal IgG System Suitability Reference Standard to be utilized for assessment of system suitability in CE-SDS methods. In this communication, we evaluate the system suitability acceptance criteria performance of the USP IgG standard using two methods, the recommended USP protocol provided in monograph &lt;129&gt; and a molecule specific Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMS) CE-SDS method. The results from USP IgG standard were compared with two in-house monoclonal antibody reference standards. The data suggest that the USP CE-SDS method may not be suitable for CE-SDS analysis for release and stability of monoclonal antibody therapeutics due to the high level of method induced partial reduction observed for all molecules tested. This high level of fragmentation observed utilizing the USP method will result in reporting lower purity levels, which will impact the overall quality assessment of the molecule. The system suitability criteria recommended by the USP method can be achieved by using the USP reference standard during the development and pre-validation stages. Furthermore, the USP reference standard does not offer significant advantages to existing SST criteria in the BMS method during release and stability testing, and therefore we propose use of the USP standard only during the optimization and pre-validation stages of method development.
The current study was designed to explore the mechanism of the prokinetic activity of Gentiopicroside (Ge), from Gentiana macrophylla Pall which is widely used to strengthen gastric motility in clinic.
Gastrointestinal motility disorder rats were induced by stress stimulation and the rats were treated with Ge. The functions of gastric emptying and intestinal propelling were measured after blood was obtained to assay the levels of plasmatic motilin (MTL), vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), somatostatin (SST), gastrin (GAS), neurotensin (NT) and substance of P (SP). The expressions of MTL receptor (MTLR), VIP receptor 2 (VIPR2) and SST receptor 2 (SSTR2) were measured also. In addition, an isolated guinea pig ileum was applied to evaluate the influences of Ge on M-R, H1-R, 5-HT4-R and D-R in vitro.
Ge increased gastric emptying and intestinal propelling obviously. It also decreased the level of SST and increased GAS in plasma significantly. Moreover, it promoted the expressions of MTLR in gastric antrum, duodenum, jejunum and ileum, and restrained the expression of VIPR2 in duodenum. Piboserod and loratadine had no obvious restrain to Ge' exciting ileum effect and Ge also didn't affect dopamine paralyzing ileum. However, Ge failed to improve the hypofunction of guinea pigs ileums pre-treated with atropine sulfate.
The mechanisms of Ge' prokinetic effect were associated with modulating the levels of SST and GAS in plasma, raising the expressions of MTLR in gastric antrum, duodenum, ileum and jejunum, reducing the expression of VIPR2 in duodenum and activating M-R.
High-resolution measurements of gas and aerosols' chemical composition along with meteorological and turbulence parameters were performed over the Aegean Sea (AS) during an Etesian outbreak in the framework of the Aegean-GAME airborne campaign. This study focuses on two distinct Etesian patterns, with similarities inside the Marine Atmospheric Boundary Layer (MABL) and differences at higher levels. Under long-range transport and subsidence the pollution load is enhanced (by 17% for CO, 11% for O3, 28% for sulfate, 62% for organic mass, 47% for elemental carbon), compared to the pattern with a weaker synoptic system. Sea surface temperature (SST) was a critical parameter for the MABL structure, turbulent fluxes and pollutants' distribution at lower levels. The MABL height was below 500 m asl over the eastern AS (favoring higher accumulation), and deeper over the western AS. The most abundant components of total PM1 were sulfate (40-50%) and organics (30-45%). Higher average concentrations measured over the eastern AS (131 ± 76 ppbv for CO, 62.5 ± 4.1 ppbv for O3, 5.0 ± 1.1 μg m(-3) for sulfate, 4.7 ± 0.9 μg m(-3) for organic mass and 0.5 ± 0.2 μg m(-3) for elemental carbon). Under the weaker synoptic system, cleaner but more acidic air masses prevailed over the eastern part, while distinct aerosol layers of different signature were observed over the western part. The Aitken and accumulation modes contributed equally during the long-range transport, while the Aitken modes dominated during local or medium range transport.
Soft-shell techniques exist for lower viscosity dispersive with higher viscosity cohesive ophthalmic viscosurgical devices (OVDs) (soft-shell technique [SST]), viscoadaptive OVDs with balanced salt solution (ultimate soft-shell technique), intraoperative floppy-iris syndrome (soft-shell bridge), and many specific modifications for disinserted zonular fibers, frayed iris strands, Fuchs endothelial dystrophy, small holes in the posterior capsule with protruding vitreous, capsular dye use, and others. Soft-shell techniques exist because it is rheologically impossible to control the surgical environment with a single OVD as well as with an ordered combination of rheologically different OVDs. Surgeons frequently confuse these techniques because of their multitude. This paper unifies all SSTs into a single improved tri-soft shell technique (TSST), from which basic specific applications to unusual circumstances are simple and intuitive. As shown with previous SSTs, the TSST allows surgeons to perform complex tasks with greater surgical facility and to protect endothelial cells better than with single OVDs.
The activity of heparanase is responsible for heparan sulfate cleavage, thus resulting in the release of heparan sulfate-bound growth factors. Since heparanase activity is upregulated in several tumor types and is implicated in the malignant behavior, the enzyme is regarded as a promising target for antitumor therapy. Based on previous evidence that the heparanase inhibitor SST0001, a non-anticoagulant N-acetylated glycol split heparin, is effective against an Ewing's sarcoma model, the present study was performed to extend the preclinical evaluation of SST0001 to a panel of pediatric sarcoma models, representative of various tumor histotypes (soft tissue and bone sarcomas) and to further elucidate its mode of action. SST0001 treatment downregulated several angiogenic factors in the conditioned media of sarcoma cells, inhibited the pro-invasive effect of heparin-binding factors (VEGF, bFGF, HGF, PDGF), and abrogated PDGF receptor tyrosine phosphorylation. Subcutaneous administration of SST0001 was very effective, resulting in a significant growth inhibition (range, 64-95%) of all tested tumor xenografts. The efficacy of SST0001 was enhanced in combination with antiangiogenic agents (bevacizumab, sunitinib) as documented by the high rate of complete response. The synergistic effect of SST0001 in combination with antiangiogenic agents is consistent with the heparanase mode of action and with the relevant role of heparin-binding proangiogenic/growth factors in the malignant behavior of sarcoma cells.
Heparanase promotes myeloma growth, dissemination, and angiogenesis through modulation of the tumor microenvironment, thus highlighting the potential of therapeutically targeting this enzyme. SST0001, a nonanticoagulant heparin with antiheparanase activity, was examined for its inhibition of myeloma tumor growth in vivo and for its mechanism of action.
The ability of SST0001 to inhibit growth of myeloma tumors was assessed using multiple animal models and a diverse panel of human and murine myeloma cell lines. To investigate the mechanism of action of SST0001, pharmacodynamic markers of angiogenesis, heparanase activity, and pathways downstream of heparanase were monitored. The potential use of SST0001 as part of a combination therapy was also evaluated in vivo.
SST0001 effectively inhibited myeloma growth in vivo, even when confronted with an aggressively growing tumor within human bone. In addition, SST0001 treatment causes changes within tumors consistent with the compound's ability to inhibit heparanase, including downregulation of HGF, VEGF, and MMP-9 expression and suppressed angiogenesis. SST0001 also diminishes heparanase-induced shedding of syndecan-1, a heparan sulfate proteoglycan known to be a potent promoter of myeloma growth. SST0001 inhibited the heparanase-mediated degradation of syndecan-1 heparan sulfate chains, thus confirming the antiheparanase activity of this compound. In combination with dexamethasone, SST0001 blocked tumor growth in vivo presumably through dual targeting of the tumor and its microenvironment.
These results provide mechanistic insight into the antitumor action of SST0001 and validate its use as a novel therapeutic tool for treating multiple myeloma.
A novel micellar selectivity triangle (MST) is developed and used to characterize and classify the chemical selectivities of pseudo-phases in electrokinetic chromatography (EKC). The MST scheme is, in concept, similar to the widely known solvent selectivity triangle (SST) originally developed by Snyder. However, the MST is based on linear solvation energy relationships. Thus it incorporates the solvation characteristics of both the pseudo-phase and the bulk solvent; while the SST is basically for classification of pure solvents. The similarities and differences of these pseudo-phases are determined by the relative scales of hydrogen bond donating ability (X(b)), hydrogen bond accepting ability (X(a)) and dipolarity (X(s)). The MST scheme is used for characterization and classification of a wide range of pseudo-phases such as micelles, polymers, vesicles, liposomes, as well as mixed systems such as mixed micelles, mixed polymer-surfactants, organically modified pseudo-phases, etc. Over seventy pseudo-phases were examined and four clusters of pseudo-phases with different selectivity patterns are recognized that include pseudo-phases with strong hydrogen bond acidities (e.g. fluorinated micelles or micelles modified with fluorinated alcohols), strong hydrogen bond acceptor pseudo-phases (such as bile salts, liposomes, microemulsions, as well as biphasic octanol-water system), strong dipolar phase of a class of polymeric pseudo-phase, and pseudo-phases with intermediate hydrogen bonding and dipolarity [like sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and its analogs as well as organically modified SDS]. The MST scheme is also useful in identifying pseudo-phases that closely resemble the selectivities of octanol-water for determination of octanol-water partition coefficients by EKC.
Ethylenediamine-N,N,N',N'-tetrakismethylene phosphonate (EDTMP) and ascorbic acid (AA) were determined in two batches of lyophilized experimental radiopharmaceutical kits by using ion chromatography with UV detection. The separation of EDTM and AA was carried out on PRP-X 800 weak cation exchange column and as an eluant 0.0025 mol L(-1) sodium sulfate was used. Validation parameters of both analytical procedures: limit of detection (LOD), limit of quantitation (LOQ), linearity, precision, accuracy and system suitability test (SST) parameters are presented.
Two tropical leguminous-rhizospheric strains, SST and JT 001, phylogenetically closest to Paracoccus thiocyanatus and Paracoccus pantotrophus, respectively, were isolated on reduced sulfur compounds as sole energy and electron sources. While SST had versatile chemolithotrophic abilities to oxidize thiosulfate, tetrathionate, thiocyanate, sulfide and elemental sulfur, JT 001 could oxidize thiosulfate, soluble sulfide, elemental sulfur and a relatively lesser amount of tetrathionate. Positive hybridization signals were detected for JT 001 but not SST, when their genomic DNAs were probed with DIG-labeled sulfur oxidation genes amplified from the chemolithotrophic alphaproteobacterium Pseudaminobacter salicylatoxidans KCT001. Though the new isolate SST exhibited high 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity with the monotypic species P. thiocyanatus, it was found to be considerably distinct from the latter in terms of phenotypic and chemotaxonomic characteristics. Polyphasic systematic analysis, however, confirmed that JT 001 was a strain of P. pantotrophus.
I describe a technique using ophthalmic viscosurgical devices to perform cataract surgery in patients taking tamsulosin (Flomax). The 6-step method uses a combination variant of the soft-shell and ultimate soft-shell techniques and involves adjustments to flow parameters. It achieves satisfactory iris stability and permits uneventful surgery.
A gradient LC method for the determination of indinavir sulfate (IDV) and its impurities has been recently published in a consultation document of the International Pharmacopoeia, WHO Drug Information. The method uses a base-deactivated reversed-phase C18 column (25 cm x 4.6 mm i.d.), 5 microm kept at a temperature of 40 degrees C. The mobile phases consist of acetonitrile, phosphate buffer pH 7.5 and water. The flow rate is 1.0 ml/min. UV detection is performed at 220 nm. A system suitability test (SST) is described to govern the quality of the separation. The separation towards IDV components was investigated on 16 C18 columns and correlation was made with the column classification system developed in our laboratory. The method was evaluated using a Hypersil BDS C18 column (25 cm x 4.6 mm i.d.), 5 microm. A central composite design was applied to examine the robustness of the method. The method shows good precision, linearity, sensitivity and robustness. Six commercial samples were examined using this method.
To determine whether patients with idiopathic retinal vasculitis have altered production of cortisol and dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate (DHEA-S), and whether differences in these variables occur between those who are sensitive (SS) and resistant (SR) to steroids.
20 patients with retinal vasculitis (off treatment) and 10 control subjects were prospectively recruited. Morning cortisol and DHEA-S levels were measured, and cortisol secretion rates and short synacthen tests (SST) carried out in patients before treatment, when on prednisolone 20 mg/day, and in controls.
There were no differences in any variables between patients and controls. For retinal vasculitis patients pretreatment, the SST was lower in SR patients (p=0.02). More of the SR patients had ischaemic retinal vasculitis ( p&lt;0.001).
Cortisol and DHEA-S are not involved in the pathogenesis of retinal vasculitis. SR in retinal vasculitis may be associated with a defective hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis.
The signal transduction pathways regulated by somatostatin receptor subtype 1 (sst1) have been difficult to define because of the variability observed when this receptor is expressed in different cell types by transfection and because pharmacological approaches are inadequate to distinguish sst1 receptor subtypes. To study the sst1 receptor in its endogenous environment, we developed a polyclonal antibody to a 15-amino acid peptide corresponding to a unique sequence in the receptor carboxyl terminus. The peptide antibody routinely precipitated 70% of the soluble [125I-Tyr11]somatostatin/receptor complex prepared from Chinese hamster ovary-K1 cells expressing the sst1 receptor but precipitated &lt; 1% of the complex from cells expressing other sst receptor subtypes. Photoaffinity-labeled sst1 receptor was also specially immunoprecipitated and migrated as a broad 60-kDa band on sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gels. The observation that sst receptors from GH4C1 pituitary cells were immunoprecipitated by the antibody and that receptors from AR4-2J pancreatic acinar cells were not indicated that only the former expressed sst1 receptor protein. Because reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction showed that GH4C1 cells contained both sst1 and sst2 receptor mRNA, immunoprecipitation permitted the sst1 receptor to be separated from the other receptors present. Two observations showed that G proteins were coprecipitated with sst1 receptors from GH4C1 cells. First, pertussis toxin pretreatment markedly decreased hormone binding in the immunoprecipitate. Second, the addition of 20 microM guanosine-5'-(gamma-thio)triphosphate to the immunoprecipitated [125I-Tyr11]somatostatin/receptor complex stimulated the rate of dissociation of bound ligand by 10-fold. Interestingly, however, the dissociation rate of approximately 30% of the ligand/receptor complex was unaffected by guanosine-5'-(gamma-thio)triphosphate. In summary, we have developed an sst1 receptor-specific antibody and used it to show that sst1 receptors endogenously expressed in GH4C1 pituitary cells couple primarily to pertussis toxin-sensitive G proteins. Furthermore, these receptors exist in two distinct high affinity states distinguished by their GTP sensitivity.
The distribution of somatostatin (SST) throughout the nervous system suggests that this tetradecapeptide may play a physiological role in CNS in the mediation of analgesia. The present study was undertaken to evaluate the antinociceptive properties of intrathecal (IT) injection of SST in the comparison of morphine sulfate (MS) in a primate model. The study was conducted after institutional approval and adhered to the regulations of the animal research committee. Seven adult monkeys (Maccaca cyclopis Swinhoe) weighing 4-6 kg were used. In each animal a L5 laminectomy window was created to facilitate IT injection. No neurological damage from surgery was noted. With the monkey standing in a specially constructed cage, all animals randomly received the following agents at one-week interval: (1) MS 1 mg, IT; (2) SST 50 micrograms, IT; (3) SST 250 micrograms, IT; and (4) SST 250 micrograms, IT + intramuscular (IM) naloxone 400 micrograms. The measured withdrawal latency (HPWL) was converted to the maximal percentage effect (MPE %) for comparison. The HPWL was measured at predrug and 5, 15, 30, 45, 60, 90 and 120 min after injection. Venous blood sample was obtained every 15 min to determine the plasma SST level by radioimmunoassay (RIA) technique in group 3 only. The results showed that MS (1 mg, IT) produced potent antinociception (MPE 100%) for more than 2 h. Intrathecal SST 50 micrograms, however, induced mild antinociception (MPE 43%) for only a short period and a 5-fold larger dose (250 micrograms) did not significantly change the nociceptive threshold with MPE only up to 47%.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
Whole gut transit was measured in a group of 21 healthy volunteers and 21 patients with tropical sprue by radio-opaque marker technique, using mean transit time single (MTTS) and single stool transit (SST) method. Mean SST in controls was 25.8 (1.4) (SE) hours, which is considerably shorter than in controls in temperate zones. Mean SST (23.7 (0.6) h) correlated significantly with average MTTS (24.9 (1.6) h) (r = 0.88; p less than 0.001) confirming that SST is a valid method to measure intestinal transit in the tropics. Patients with tropical sprue had a mean SST similar to controls (24.4 (1.1) h), in spite of significantly higher faecal weights (580 (41.2) g v 252 (17.2) g; p less than 0.001).
The effects of glucocorticoids on fuel metabolism are complex. Acute glucocorticoid excess promotes lipolysis but chronic glucocorticoid excess causes visceral fat accumulation. We hypothesized that interactions between cortisol with insulin and adrenaline accounts for these conflicting results. We tested the effect of cortisol on lipolysis and glucose production with and without insulin and adrenaline in humans both in vivo and in vitro.
Twenty healthy men were randomised to low and high insulin groups (both n = 10). Subjects attended on 3 occasions and received low (~150nM), medium (~400nM) or high (~1400nM) cortisol infusion in a randomised crossover design. Deuterated glucose and glycerol were infused intravenously along with a pancreatic clamp (somatostatin with replacement of glucagon, insulin and growth hormone) and adrenaline. Subcutaneous adipose tissue was obtained for analysis. In parallel, the effect of cortisol on lipolysis was tested in paired primary cultures of human subcutaneous and visceral adipocytes.
In vivo, high cortisol increased lipolysis only in the presence of high insulin and/or adrenaline but did not alter glucose kinetics. High cortisol increased adipose mRNA levels of ATGL, HSL and CGI-58 and suppressed G0S2. In vitro, high cortisol increased lipolysis in the presence of insulin in subcutaneous but not visceral adipocytes.
The acute lipolytic effects of cortisol require supraphysiological concentrations, are dependent on insulin and adrenaline and observed only in subcutaneous adipose tissue. The resistance of visceral adipose tissue to cortisol's lipolytic effects may contribute to the central fat accumulation observed with chronic glucocorticoid excess.
Glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) in combination with hyperinsulinemia increases blood flow and triglyceride (TAG) clearance in subcutaneous (sc) abdominal adipose tissue in lean humans. The present experiments were performed to further investigate the role of insulin for the vasoactive effect of GIP in adipose tissue metabolism and whether the vasodilatory effect of GIP is dependent on C-peptide.
Six lean healthy subjects were studied. The sc abdominal adipose tissue metabolism was assessed by Fick's principle during GIP infusion (1.5 pmol/kg/min) in combination with 1) euglycemic-high insulinemic clamp (Eugluc-Hiinsu), raising plasma insulin concentrations to postprandial levels, 2) hyperglycemic-euinsulinemic clamp (Hygluc-Euinsu), and 3) hyperglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp, raising plasma insulin concentrations to supraphysiological levels. During the hyperglycemic clamps, endogenous insulin and C-peptide secretion were inhibited by infusion of the somatostatin analogue octreotide.
During GIP infusion, Eugluc-Hiinsu, and hyperglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamps, sc abdominal adipose tissue blood flow (ATBF) was similar and increased from 2.1 ± 0.2 and 2.2 ± 0.4 ml min(-1) (100 g tissue)(-1) to 7.1 ± 0.6 and 7.6 ± 0.1 ml min(-1) (100 g tissue)(-1), respectively (P &lt; .01). ATBF remained virtually constant (2.7 ± 0.4 ml min(-1) [100 g tissue](-1)) during Hygluc-Euinsu and GIP infusion. In addition, adipose tissue TAG clearance increased significantly (P = .03), whereas free fatty acid output (P = .01), glycerol output (P = .02) and free fatty acid/glycerol release ratio (P = .04) decreased during the Eugluc-Hiinsu clamp compared to Hygluc-Euinsu clamp with GIP.
In healthy lean humans, insulin is permissive for GIP to induce an increase in blood flow and TAG clearance in sc abdominal adipose tissue. This effect is independent of C-peptide.
Obesity has been associated with elevated plasma anandamide levels. In addition, anandamide has been shown to stimulate insulin secretion in vitro, suggesting that anandamide might be linked to hyperinsulinemia.
To determine whether high-fat diet-induced insulin resistance increases anandamide levels and potentiates the insulinotropic effect of anandamide in isolated pancreatic islets.
Dogs were fed a high-fat diet (n = 9) for 22 weeks. Abdominal fat depot was quantified by MRI. Insulin sensitivity was assessed by the euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp. Fasting plasma endocannabinoid levels were analyzed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. All metabolic assessments were performed before and after fat diet regimen. At the end of the study, pancreatic islets were isolated prior to euthanasia to test the in vitro effect of anandamide on islet hormones. mRNA expression of cannabinoid receptors was determined in intact islets. The findings in vitro were compared with those from animals fed a control diet (n = 7).
Prolonged fat feeding increased abdominal fat content by 81.3±21.6% (mean±S.E.M, P&lt;0.01). In vivo insulin sensitivity decreased by 31.3±12.1% (P&lt;0.05), concomitant with a decrease in plasma 2-arachidonoyl glycerol (from 39.1±5.2 to 15.7±2.0 nmol/L) but not anandamide, oleoyl ethanolamide, linoleoyl ethanolamide, or palmitoyl ethanolamide. In control-diet animals (body weight: 28.8±1.0 kg), islets incubated with anandamide had a higher basal and glucose-stimulated insulin secretion as compared with no treatment. Islets from fat-fed animals (34.5±1.3 kg; P&lt;0.05 versus control) did not exhibit further potentiation of anandamide-induced insulin secretion as compared with control-diet animals. Glucagon but not somatostatin secretion in vitro was also increased in response to anandamide, but there was no difference between groups (P = 0.705). No differences in gene expression of CB1R or CB2R between groups were found.
In canines, high-fat diet-induced insulin resistance does not alter plasma anandamide levels or further potentiate the insulinotropic effect of anandamide in vitro.
The objective of this study was to assess the insulin-independent effects of incretin hormones on glucose and glycerol metabolism and hemodynamics under euglycemic and hyperglycemic conditions. Young, healthy men (n=10) underwent three trials in a randomized, controlled, crossover study. Each trial consisted of a two-stage (euglycemia and hyperglycemia) pancreatic clamp (using somatostatin to prevent endogenous insulin secretion). Glucose and lipid metabolism was measured via infusion of stable glucose and glycerol isotopic tracers. Hemodynamic variables (femoral, brachial, and common carotid artery blood flow and flow-mediated dilation of the brachial artery) were also measured. The three trials differed as follows: 1) saline [control (CON)], 2) glucagon-like peptide (GLP-1, 0.5 pmol·kg(-1)·min(-1)), and 3) glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP, 1.5 pmol·kg(-1)·min(-1)). No between-trial differences in glucose infusion rates (GIR) or glucose or glycerol kinetics were seen during euglycemia, whereas hyperglycemia resulted in increased GIR and glucose rate of disappearance during GLP-1 compared with CON and GIP (P&lt;0.01 for all). However, when normalized to insulin levels, no differences between trials were seen for GIR or glucose rate of disappearance. Besides a higher femoral blood flow during hyperglycemia with GIP (vs. CON and GLP-1, P&lt;0.001), no between-trial differences were seen for the hemodynamic variables. In conclusion, GLP-1 and GIP have no direct effect on whole body glucose metabolism or hemodynamics during euglycemia. On the contrary, during hyperglycemia, GIP increases femoral artery blood flow with no effect on glucose metabolism, whereas GLP-1 increases glucose disposal, potentially due to increased insulin levels.
This Guideline is an official statement of the European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ESGE). It addresses the prophylaxis of post-endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (post-ERCP) pancreatitis. Main recommendations 1 ESGE recommends routine rectal administration of 100 mg of diclofenac or indomethacin immediately before or after ERCP in all patients without contraindication. In addition to this, in the case of high risk for post-ERCP pancreatitis (PEP), the placement of a 5-Fr prophylactic pancreatic stent should be strongly considered. Sublingually administered glyceryl trinitrate or 250 µg somatostatin given in bolus injection might be considered as an option in high risk cases if nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are contraindicated and if prophylactic pancreatic stenting is not possible or successful. 2 ESGE recommends keeping the number of cannulation attempts as low as possible. 3 ESGE suggests restricting the use of a pancreatic guidewire as a backup technique for biliary cannulation to cases with repeated inadvertent cannulation of the pancreatic duct; if this method is used, deep biliary cannulation should be attempted using a guidewire rather than the contrast-assisted method and a prophylactic pancreatic stent should be placed. 4 ESGE suggests that needle-knife fistulotomy should be the preferred precut technique in patients with a bile duct dilated down to the papilla. Conventional precut and transpancreatic sphincterotomy present similar success and complication rates; if conventional precut is selected and pancreatic cannulation is easily obtained, ESGE suggests attempting to place a small-diameter (3-Fr or 5-Fr) pancreatic stent to guide the cut and leaving the pancreatic stent in place at the end of ERCP for a minimum of 12 - 24 hours. 4 ESGE does not recommend endoscopic papillary balloon dilation as an alternative to sphincterotomy in routine ERCP, but it may be advantageous in selected patients; if this technique is used, the duration of dilation should be longer than 1 minute.
In dogs consuming a high-fat and -fructose diet (52 and 17% of total energy, respectively) for 4 wk, hepatic glucose uptake (HGU) in response to hyperinsulinemia, hyperglycemia, and portal glucose delivery is markedly blunted with reduction in glucokinase (GK) protein and glycogen synthase (GS) activity. The present study compared the impact of selective increases in dietary fat and fructose on liver glucose metabolism. Dogs consumed weight-maintaining chow (CTR) or hypercaloric high-fat (HFA) or high-fructose (HFR) diets diet for 4 wk before undergoing clamp studies with infusion of somatostatin and intraportal insulin (3-4 times basal) and glucagon (basal). The hepatic glucose load (HGL) was doubled during the clamp using peripheral vein (Pe) glucose infusion in the first 90 min (P1) and portal vein (4 mg·kg(-1)·min(-1)) plus Pe glucose infusion during the final 90 min (P2). During P2, HGU was 2.8 ± 0.2, 1.0 ± 0.2, and 0.8 ± 0.2 mg·kg(-1)·min(-1) in CTR, HFA, and HFR, respectively (P &lt; 0.05 for HFA and HFR vs. CTR). Compared with CTR, hepatic GK protein and catalytic activity were reduced (P &lt; 0.05) 35 and 56%, respectively, in HFA, and 53 and 74%, respectively, in HFR. Liver glycogen concentrations were 20 and 38% lower in HFA and HFR than CTR (P &lt; 0.05). Hepatic Akt phosphorylation was decreased (P &lt; 0.05) in HFA (21%) but not HFR. Thus, HFR impaired hepatic GK and glycogen more than HFA, whereas HFA reduced insulin signaling more than HFR. HFA and HFR effects were not additive, suggesting that they act via the same mechanism or their effects converge at a saturable step.
Somatostatin is the most effective inhibitor of GH release, and GHRH was recently identified as one of the primary GH-releasing factors in teleosts. In this study, we analyzed the possible intracellular transduction pathways that are involved in the mechanisms induced by SRIF and GHRH to regulate GH release. Using a pharmacological approach, the blockade of the PLC/IP/PKC pathway reversed the SRIF-induced inhibition of GH release but did not affect the GHRH-induced stimulation of GH release. Furthermore, SRIF reduced the GH release induced by two PKC activators. Inhibitors of the AC/cAMP/PKA pathway reversed both the SRIF- and GHRH-induced effects on GH release. Moreover, the GH release evoked by forskolin and 8-Br-cAMP were completely abolished by SRIF. The blockade of the NOS/NO pathway attenuated the GHRH-induced GH release but had minimal effects on the inhibitory actions of SRIF. In addition, inhibitors of the sGC/cGMP pathway did not modify the SRIF- or GHRH-induced regulation of GH release. Taken together, these findings indicate that the SRIF-induced inhibition of GH release is mediated by both the PLC/IP/PKC and the AC/cAMP/PKA pathways and not by the NOS/NO/sGC/cGMP pathway. In contrast, the GHRH-induced stimulation of GH secretion is mediated by both the AC/cAMP/PKA and the NOS/NO pathways and is independent of the sGC/cGMP pathway and the PLC/IP/PKC system.
Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) lowers glucose levels by potentiating glucose-induced insulin secretion and inhibiting glucagon release. The question of whether GLP-1 exerts direct effects on the liver, independently of the hormonal changes, is controversial. We tested whether an exogenous GLP-1 infusion, designed to achieve physiological postprandial levels, directly affects endogenous glucose production (EGP) under conditions mimicking the fasting state in diabetes.
In 14 healthy volunteers, we applied the pancreatic clamp technique, whereby plasma insulin and glucagon levels are clamped using somatostatin and hormone replacement. The clamp was applied in paired, 4 h experiments, during which saline (control) or GLP-1(7-37)amide (0.4 pmol min⁻¹ kg⁻¹) was infused.
During the control study, plasma insulin and glucagon were maintained at basal levels and plasma C-peptide was suppressed, such that plasma glucose rose to a plateau of ~10.5 mmol/l and tracer-determined EGP increased by ~60%. During GLP-1 infusion at matched plasma glucose levels, the rise of EGP from baseline was fully prevented. Lipolysis (as indexed by NEFA concentrations and tracer-determined glycerol rate of appearance) and substrate utilisation (by indirect calorimetry) were similar between control and GLP-1 infusion.
GLP-1 inhibits EGP under conditions where plasma insulin and glucagon are not allowed to change and glucose concentrations are matched, indicating either a direct effect on hepatocytes or neurally mediated inhibition.
The aim of this study was to evaluate the relative contributions of various hormones involved in the regulation of lipid mobilization in subcutaneous adipose tissue (SCAT) during exercise and to assess the impact of obesity on this regulation. Eight lean and eight obese men performed a 60-min cycle exercise bout at 50% of their peak oxygen uptake on two occasions: during intravenous infusion of octreotide (a somatostatin analog) or physiological saline (control condition). Lipolysis in SCAT was evaluated using in situ microdialysis. One microdialysis probe was perfused with the adrenergic blockers phentolamine and propranolol while another probe was perfused with the phosphodiesterase and adenosine receptor inhibitor aminophylline. Compared with the control condition, infusion of octreotide reduced plasma insulin levels in lean (from approximately 3.5 to 0.5 microU/ml) and in obese (from approximately 9 to 2 microU/ml), blunted the exercise-induced rise in plasma GH and epinephrine levels in both groups, and enhanced the exercise-induced natriuretic peptide (NP) levels in lean but not in obese subjects. In both groups, octreotide infusion resulted in higher exercise-induced increases in dialysate glycerol concentrations in the phentolamine-containing probe while no difference in lipolytic response was found in the aminophylline-containing probe. The results suggest that insulin antilipolytic action plays a role in the regulation of lipolysis during exercise in lean as well as in obese subjects. The octreotide-induced enhancement of exercise lipolysis in lean subjects was associated with an increased exercise-induced plasma NP response. Adenosine may contribute to the inhibition of basal lipolysis in both subject groups.
Goldfish brain somatostatin-28 (gbSS-28) is present in brain and pituitary tissues of goldfish. We assessed whether gbSS-28 targets Ca(2+) and/or protein kinase C (PKC)-dependent signaling cascades in inhibiting growth hormone (GH) release. gbSS-28 decreased basal GH release from primary cultures of dispersed goldfish pituitary cells and intracellular free calcium levels ([Ca(2+)](i)) in goldfish somatotropes. gbSS-28 partially reduced [Ca(2+)](i) and GH responses induced by two endogeneous gonadotropin-releasing hormones (GnRHs), salmon (s)GnRH and chicken (c)GnRH-II. Furthermore, gbSS-28 reduced GH increases and abolished [Ca(2+)](i) elevations elicited by two PKC activators, tetradecanoyl 4beta-phorbol-13-acetate and dioctanyl glycerol. The PKC inhibitors Gö6976 and Bis II abolished [Ca(2+)](i) responses to PKC activators, but only attenuated GnRH-induced increases in [Ca(2+)](i) and did not alter basal [Ca(2+)](i). In cells pretreated with Bis II, gbSS-28 further reduced basal [Ca(2+)](i). Our results suggest that gbSS-28 inhibits GnRH-induced GH release in part by attenuating PKC-mediated GnRH [Ca(2+)](i) signals. gbSS-28 reduces basal GH release also via reduction in [Ca(2+)](i) but PKC is not involved in this regard.
Although the low central venous pressure (LCVP) technique is used to decrease blood loss during liver resection, its efficacy and safety during transplant procedures are still debatable. Our study aimed to assess the effects of this technique and its clinical safety for recipients undergoing liver transplantation.
Eighty-six adult patients were randomly divided into a LCVP group and a control group. In the LCVP group, CVP was maintained below 5 mmHg or 40% lower than baseline during the preanhepatic phase by limiting infusion volume, manipulating the patient's posture, and administration of somatostatin and nitroglycerine. Recipients in the control group received standard care. Hemodynamics, blood loss, liver function, and renal function of the two groups were compared perioperatively.
A lower CVP was maintained in the LCVP group during the preanhepatic phase, resulting in a significant decrease in blood loss (1922 +/- 1429 vs. 3111 +/- 1833 ml, P &lt; 0.05) and transfusion volume (1200 +/- 800 vs. 2400 +/- 1200 ml, P &lt; 0.05) intraoperatively. Compared with the control group, the LCVP group had a significantly lower mean arterial pressure at 2 h after the start of the operation (74 +/- 11 vs. 84 +/- 14 mmHg, P &lt; 0.05), a lower lactate value at the end of the operation (5.9 +/- 3.0 vs. 7.2 +/- 3.0 mmol/l, P &lt; 0.05), and a better preservation of liver function after the declamping of the portal vein. There were no significant differences in perioperative renal function and postoperative complications between the groups.
The LCVP technique during the preanhepatic phase reduced intraoperative blood loss, protected liver function, and had no detrimental effects on renal function in LT.
Insulin represses the expression of gluconeogenic genes at the mRNA level, but the hormone appears to have only weak inhibitory effects in vivo. The aims of this study were 1) to determine the maximal physiologic effect of insulin, 2) to determine the relative importance of its effects on gluconeogenic regulatory sites, and 3) to correlate those changes with alterations at the cellular level.
Conscious 60-h fasted canines were studied at three insulin levels (near basal, 4x, or 16x) during a 5-h euglycemic clamp. Pancreatic hormones were controlled using somatostatin with portal insulin and glucagon infusions. Glucose metabolism was assessed using the arteriovenous difference technique, and molecular signals were assessed.
Insulin reduced gluconeogenic flux to glucose-6-phosphate (G6P) but only at the near-maximal physiological level (16x basal). The effect was modest compared with its inhibitory effect on net hepatic glycogenolysis, occurred within 30 min, and was associated with a marked decrease in hepatic fat oxidation, increased liver fructose 2,6-bisphosphate level, and reductions in lactate, glycerol, and amino acid extraction. No further diminution in gluconeogenic flux to G6P occurred over the remaining 4.5 h of the study, despite a marked decrease in PEPCK content, suggesting poor control strength for this enzyme in gluconeogenic regulation in canines.
Gluconeogenic flux can be rapidly inhibited by high insulin levels in canines. Initially decreased hepatic lactate extraction is important, and later reduced gluconeogenic precursor availability plays a role. Changes in PEPCK appear to have little or no acute effect on gluconeogenic flux.
The role of nitric oxide (NO) in migraine has been studied in the experimental glyceryl trinitrate (GTN)-infusion headache model. We hypothesized that GTN-induced headache may activate the trigeminovascular system and be associated with increased levels of sensory neuropeptides, including calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP). CGRP, vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), neuropeptide Y (NPY) and somatostatin plasma levels were measured before and after placebo/sumatriptan injection and during GTN-induced headache. Following a double-blind randomized cross-over design, 10 healthy volunteers received subcutaneous sumatriptan 6 mg or placebo. This was succeeded by 20 min of GTN (0.12 µg kg(-1) min(-1)) infusion. At baseline no subject reported headache (using verbal rating scale from 0 to 10) and the jugular CGRP-like immunoreactivity (-LI) level was 18.6 ± 2.5 pmol/l. After a 20-min intravenous infusion of GTN 0.12 µg kg(-1) min(-1), median peak headache intensity was 4 (range 2-6) (P &lt; 0.05), while jugular CGRP-LI levels were unchanged (19.0 ± 2.8 pmol/l; P &gt; 0.05). There were no changes in VIP-, NPY- or somatostatin-LI. In conclusion, the NO donor GTN appears not to induce headache via immediate CGRP release.
The relative contribution of noradrenaline (norepinephrine) and adrenaline (epinephrine) in the control of lipid mobilization in subcutaneous adipose tissue (SCAT) during exercise was evaluated in men treated with a somatostatin analogue, octreotide. Eight lean and eight obese young men matched for age and physical fitness performed 60 min exercise bouts at 50% of their maximal oxygen consumption on two occasions: (1) during i.v. infusion of octreotide, and (2) during placebo infusion. Lipolysis and local blood flow changes in SCAT were evaluated using in situ microdialysis. Infusion of octreotide suppressed plasma insulin and growth hormone levels at rest and during exercise. It blocked the exercise-induced increase in plasma adrenaline while that of noradrenaline was unchanged. Plasma natriuretic peptides (NPs) level was higher at rest and during exercise under octreotide infusion in lean men. Under placebo, no difference was found in the exercise-induced increase in glycerol between the probe perfused with Ringer solution alone and that with phentolamine (an alpha-adrenergic receptor antagonist) in lean subjects while a greater increase in glycerol was observed in the obese subjects. Under placebo, propranolol infusion in the probe containing phentolamine reduced by about 45% exercise-induced glycerol release; this effect was fully suppressed under octreotide infusion while noradrenaline was still elevated and exercise-induced lipid mobilization maintained in both lean and obese individuals. In conclusion, blockade of beta-adrenergic receptors during exercise performed during infusion of octreotide (blocking the exercise-induced rise in adrenaline but not that of noradrenaline) does not alter the exercise-induced lipolysis. This suggests that adrenaline is the main adrenergic agent contributing to exercise-induced lipolysis in SCAT. Moreover, it is the combined action of insulin suppression and NPs release which explains the lipolytic response which remains under octreotide after full local blockade of fat cell adrenergic receptors. For the moment, it is unknown if results apply specifically to SCAT and exercise only or if conclusions could be extended to all forms of lipolysis in humans.
We sought to determine whether pioglitazone and metformin alter NEFA-induced insulin resistance in type 2 diabetes and, if so, the mechanism whereby this is effected.
Euglycaemic-hyperinsulinaemic clamps (glucose approximately 5.3 mmol/l, insulin approximately 200 pmol/l) were performed in the presence of Intralipid-heparin (IL/H) or glycerol before and after 4 months of treatment with pioglitazone (n = 11) or metformin (n = 9) in diabetic participants. Hormone secretion was inhibited with somatostatin in all participants.
Pioglitazone increased insulin-stimulated glucose disappearance (p &lt; 0.01) and increased insulin-induced suppression of glucose production (p &lt; 0.01), gluconeogenesis (p &lt; 0.05) and glycogenolysis (p &lt; 0.05) during IL/H. However, glucose disappearance remained lower (p &lt; 0.05) whereas glucose production (p &lt; 0.01), gluconeogenesis (p &lt; 0.05) and glycogenolysis (p &lt; 0.05) were higher on the IL/H study day than on the glycerol study day, indicating persistence of NEFA-induced insulin resistance. Metformin increased (p &lt; 0.001) glucose disappearance during IL/H to rates present during glycerol treatment, indicating protection against NEFA-induced insulin resistance in extrahepatic tissues. However, glucose production and gluconeogenesis (but not glycogenolysis) were higher (p &lt; 0.01) during IL/H than during glycerol treatment with metformin, indicating persistence of NEFA-induced hepatic insulin resistance.
We conclude that pioglitazone improves both the hepatic and the extrahepatic action of insulin but does not prevent NEFA-induced insulin resistance. In contrast, whereas metformin prevents NEFA-induced extrahepatic insulin resistance, it does not protect against NEFA-induced hepatic insulin resistance.
The aim of the present review is to summarize the current knowledge regarding pharmacological prevention and treatment of acute pancreatitis (AP) based on experimental animal models and clinical trials. Somatostatin (SS) and octreotide inhibit the exocrine production of pancreatic enzymes and may be useful as prophylaxis against post endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography pancreatitis (PEP). The protease inhibitor gabexate mesilate (GM) is used routinely as treatment to AP in some countries, but randomized clinical trials and a meta-analysis do not support this practice. Nitroglycerin (NGL) is a nitrogen oxide (NO) donor, which relaxes the sphincter of Oddi. Studies show conflicting results when applied prior to ERCP and a large multicenter randomized study is warranted. Steroids administered as prophylaxis against PEP has been validated without effect in several randomized trials. The non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) indomethacin and diclofenac have in randomized studies showed potential as prophylaxis against PEP. Interleukin 10 (IL-10) is a cytokine with anti-inflammatory properties but two trials testing IL-10 as prophylaxis to PEP have returned conflicting results. Antibodies against tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) have a potential as rescue therapy but no clinical trials are currently being conducted. The antibiotics beta-lactams and quinolones reduce mortality when necrosis is present in pancreas and may also reduce incidence of infected necrosis. Evidence based pharmacological treatment of AP is limited and studies on the effect of potent anti-inflammatory drugs are warranted.
We examined whether intraportal delivery of neuropeptide Y (NPY) affects glucose metabolism in 42-h-fasted conscious dogs using arteriovenous difference methodology. The experimental period was divided into three subperiods (P1, P2, and P3). During all subperiods, the dogs received infusions of somatostatin, intraportal insulin (threefold basal), intraportal glucagon (basal), and peripheral intravenous glucose to increase the hepatic glucose load twofold basal. Following P1, in the NPY group (n = 7), NPY was infused intraportally at 0.2 and 5.1 pmol.kg(-1).min(-1) during P2 and P3, respectively. The control group (n = 7) received intraportal saline infusion without NPY. There were no significant changes in hepatic blood flow in NPY vs. control. The lower infusion rate of NPY (P2) did not enhance net hepatic glucose uptake. During P3, the increment in net hepatic glucose uptake (compared with P1) was 4 +/- 1 and 10 +/- 2 micromol.kg(-1).min(-1) in control and NPY, respectively (P &lt; 0.05). The increment in net hepatic fractional glucose extraction during P3 was 0.015 +/- 0.005 and 0.039 +/- 0.008 in control and NPY, respectively (P &lt; 0.05). Net hepatic carbon retention was enhanced in NPY vs. control (22 +/- 2 vs. 14 +/- 2 micromol.kg(-1).min(-1), P &lt; 0.05). There were no significant differences between groups in the total glucose infusion rate. Thus, intraportal NPY stimulates net hepatic glucose uptake without significantly altering whole body glucose disposal in dogs.
We examined the presence of functional cannabinoid receptors 1 and 2 (CB1, CB2) in isolated human islets, phenotyped the cells producing cannabinoid receptors and analysed the actions of selective cannabinoid receptor agonists on insulin, glucagon and somatostatin secretion in vitro. We also described the localisation on islet cells of: (1) the endocannabinoid-producing enzymes N-acyl-phosphatidyl ethanolamine-hydrolysing phospholipase D and diacylglycerol lipase; and (2) the endocannabinoid-degrading enzymes fatty acid amidohydrolase and monoacyl glycerol lipase.
Real-time PCR, western blotting and immunocytochemistry were used to analyse the presence of endocannabinoid-related proteins and genes. Static secretion experiments were used to examine the effects of activating CB1 or CB2 on insulin, glucagon and somatostatin secretion and to measure changes in 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) levels within islets. Analyses were performed in isolated human islets and in paraffin-embedded sections of human pancreas.
Human islets of Langerhans expressed CB1 and CB2 (also known as CNR1 and CNR2) mRNA and CB1 and CB2 proteins, and also the machinery involved in synthesis and degradation of 2-AG (the most abundant endocannabinoid, levels of which were modulated by glucose). Immunofluorescence revealed that CB1 was densely located in glucagon-secreting alpha cells and less so in insulin-secreting beta cells. CB2 was densely present in somatostatin-secreting delta cells, but absent in alpha and beta cells. In vitro experiments revealed that CB1 stimulation enhanced insulin and glucagon secretion, while CB2 agonism lowered glucose-dependent insulin secretion, showing these cannabinoid receptors to be functional.
Together, these results suggest a role for endogenous endocannabinoid signalling in regulation of endocrine secretion in the human pancreas.
To determine the role of nitric oxide in regulating net hepatic glucose uptake (NHGU) in vivo, studies were performed on three groups of 42-h-fasted conscious dogs using a nitric oxide donor [3-morpholinosydnonimine (SIN-1)]. The experimental period was divided into period 1 (0-90 min) and period 2 (P2; 90-240 min). At 0 min, somatostatin was infused peripherally, and insulin (4-fold basal) and glucagon (basal) were given intraportally. Glucose was delivered intraportally (22.2 mumol.kg(-1).min(-1)) and peripherally (as needed) to increase the hepatic glucose load twofold basal. At 90 min, an infusion of SIN-1 (4 mug.kg(-1).min(-1)) was started in a peripheral vein (PeSin-1, n = 10) or the portal vein (PoSin-1, n = 12) while the control group received saline (SAL, n = 8). Both peripheral and portal infusion of SIN-1, unlike saline, significantly reduced systolic and diastolic blood pressure. Heart rate rose in PeSin-1 and PoSin-1 (96 +/- 5 to 120 +/- 10 and 88 +/- 6 to 107 +/- 5 beats/min, respectively, P &lt; 0.05) but did not change in response to saline. NHGU during P2 was 31.0 +/- 2.4 and 29.9 +/- 2.0 mumol.kg(-1).min(-1) in SAL and PeSin-1, respectively but was 23.7 +/- 1.7 in PoSin-1 (P &lt; 0.05). Net hepatic carbon retention during P2 was significantly lower in PoSin-1 than SAL or PeSin-1 (21.4 +/- 1.2 vs. 27.1 +/- 1.5 and 26.1 +/- 1.0 mumol.kg(-1).min(-1)). Nonhepatic glucose uptake did not change in response to saline or SIN-1 infusion. In conclusion, portal but not peripheral infusion of the nitric oxide donor SIN-1 inhibited NHGU.
To determine mechanisms by which pioglitazone and metformin effect hepatic and extra-hepatic insulin action.
Thirty-one subjects with type 2 diabetes were randomly assigned to pioglitazone (45 mg) or metformin (2,000 mg) for 4 months.
Glucose was clamped before and after therapy at approximately 5 mmol/l, insulin raised to approximately 180 pmol/l, C-peptide suppressed with somatostatin, glucagon replaced at approximately 75 pg/ml, and glycerol maintained at approximately 200 mmol/l to ensure comparable and equal portal concentrations on all occasions. Insulin-induced stimulation of glucose disappearance did not differ before and after treatment with either pioglitazone (23 +/- 3 vs. 24 +/- 2 micromol x kg(-1) x min(-1)) or metformin (22 +/- 2 vs. 24 +/- 3 micromol x kg(-1) x min(-1)). In contrast, pioglitazone enhanced (P &lt; 0.01) insulin-induced suppression of both glucose production (6.0 +/- 1.0 vs. 0.2 +/- 1.6 micromol x kg(-1) x min(-1)) and gluconeogenesis (n = 11; 4.5 +/- 0.9 vs. 0.8 +/- 1.2 micromol x kg(-1) x min(-1)). Metformin did not alter either suppression of glucose production (5.8 +/- 1.0 vs. 5.0 +/- 0.8 micromol x kg(-1) x min(-1)) or gluconeogenesis (n = 9; 3.7 +/- 0.8 vs. 2.6 +/- 0.7 micromol x kg(-1) x min(-1)). Insulin-induced suppression of free fatty acids was greater (P &lt; 0.05) after treatment with pioglitazone (0.14 +/- 0.03 vs. 0.06 +/- 0.01 mmol/l) but unchanged with metformin (0.12 +/- 0.03 vs. 0.15 +/- 0.07 mmol/l).
Thus, relative to metformin, pioglitazone improves hepatic insulin action in people with type 2 diabetes, partly by enhancing insulin-induced suppression of gluconeogenesis. On the other hand, both drugs have comparable effects on insulin-induced stimulation of glucose uptake.
Atypical carcinoid arising from the mediastinal tissue is a rare neuroendocrine tumor and an association with parathyroid adenoma is very unusual. We report an unusual case of atypical carcinoid of mediastinum with metastasis in a patient presenting with parathyroid adenoma, which is the first case to be reported from Pakistan.
A 51-year-old Pakistani man was seen in postoperative intensive care after right parathyroidectomy and mediastinal mass resection for the management of postoperative hypocalcaemia. He had a background history of dyspnea. Examination was unremarkable. Preoperative laboratory evaluation revealed a calcium level of 12.7 mg/dl, phosphate of 1.9 mg/dl, serum albumin of 4.8 g/dl, alkaline phosphate of 94 U/L, and serum intact parathyroid hormone level 413.8 pg/ml. A technetium-99m sestamibi parathyroid scan showed right parathyroid increased tracer uptake. Further workup revealed a large mediastinal mass which was diagnosed as atypical carcinoid after Tru-Cut biopsy. He underwent right-sided parathyroidectomy and resection of the mediastinal mass. The histopathology confirmed it to be a parathyroid adenoma and atypical carcinoid tumor of his mediastinum with metastasis in his lymph node and parathyroid gland. Somatostatin receptor scintigraphy revealed a well-defined focus in his left hypochondriac region consistent with a somatostatin receptor scintigraphy-avid tumor. He was started on everolimus and planned for octreotide therapy.
We describe an incidental finding of atypical carcinoid of the mediastinum in a patient diagnosed as having parathyroid adenoma. Clinical manifestations of neuroendocrine syndromes are challenging. Some tumors cluster in a non-classic description with other common neoplasms. They rarely present in isolation, remain clinically silent, and need aggressive workup with the aid of imaging and histopathology.
Peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) with radiolabeled somatostatin analogues is a promising treatment for patients with inoperable, well to moderately differentiated metastatic neuroendocrine tumors (NETs). In continuation of our novel study with the radionuclide lutetium Lu, we now present further results of Lu DOTATATE therapy in managing NETs and other somatostatin receptor-expressing tumors in a larger and more diverse patient group.
One hundred forty-four consecutive patients (85 men and 59 women; age range, 11-87 years; mean age, 58.5 years) with histologically confirmed NET were enrolled. One hundred forty-three patients received at least 1 cycle of treatment. Among them, 132 were deemed evaluable by having at least 1 cycle of treatment and a posttreatment MRI or CT scan for assessment based on modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors. Response to therapy was evaluated in terms of progression-free survival, overall survival, as well as radiologic, biochemical, and clinical responses. Further, analysis of symptoms was reviewed during therapy and also in subsequent follow-ups for safety evaluation. Renal, gastrointestinal (GI), hepatic, and hematological adverse events were evaluated using National Cancer Institute common toxicities criteria V4.03, through full blood panels, as well as consultation with patients for any symptoms and/or adverse events.
As of July 2016, median progression-free survival was about to be reached. Of 28 patients who have completed Lu DOTATATE therapy (completion of 4 or more cycles of treatment and all designated follow-ups), no patient showed complete response (CR), 8 patients (28.57%) showed partial response (PR), 16 patients (57.14%) showed stable disease (SD), and progressive disease (PD) was observed in 4 patients (14.28%). The objective response rate (CR + PR) of this group was 28.57% (n = 8) with a cumulative disease control (CR + PR + SD) of 85.71% (n = 24).Among 132 evaluable patients, assessment of treatment response using modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors criteria revealed CR in none of the patients, PR in 12 patients (9.09%), SD in 66 patients (50%), whereas PD, which included patients who passed away, was observed in 54 patients (40.90%), yielding an objective response rate of 9.09% (n = 12) and a cumulative disease control rate of 59.09% (n = 78).Symptoms including abdominal pain, diarrhea, flushing, and fatigue improved in over 50% of the patients, whereas weight loss improved in 28.26% of the patients. No grade 3 or grade 4 renal toxicities were found, though eleven grade 3 and five grade 4 hematological as well as three grade 3 hepatotoxicities were reported. Grade 3 hematotoxicity lasted an average of 2.7 months, and grade 4 lasted for only 0.9 months, whereas grade 3 hepatotoxicity lasted an average of 3.1 months.
Lu-octreotate peptide receptor radionuclide therapy has shown promising potential as a safe and effective targeted therapy in inoperable, well to moderately differentiated metastatic neuroendocrine cancers. The results of the multicenter randomized clinical trial conducted in United States and Europe are concordant with current study.
A 53-year-old man presented with diarrhoea and hypokalaemia and was diagnosed with a neuroendocrine tumour of unknown origin with multiple liver metastases. Somatostatin analogues led to a reduction in the size of the tumours and improvement of his symptoms. However, after several years, the tumours grew in size, and the patient's clinical symptoms recurred. The patient underwent transcatheter arterial embolization (TAE) of the hepatic artery to treat the liver metastases. Immediately after embolization, the symptoms disappeared. Although the patient had an unresectable vasoactive intestinal polypeptide-producing neuroendocrine tumour, the endocrine symptoms were able to be controlled with chemotherapy and TAE, resulting in a long-term survival.
We report on a 62-year-old man with metastatic prostate cancer (cT3b N1) diagnosed in 2011, treated with total androgen blockage with flutamide and goserelin acetate (Zoladex). He presented with left suprascapular swelling and low-back pain after being asymptomatic for 5 years. His prostate-specific antigen was 0.049 ng/mL. F-NaF PET-CT and Ga-PSMA scan were negative, whereas Ga-DOTA NOC scan done after 10 days showed multiple somatostatin-avid hepatic and lymph node metastasis.
This study aimed to evaluate the clinical and radiological features and clinical outcomes of paraduodenal pancreatitis (PP).
A final diagnosis of PP was based on surgical specimens in resected patients and on imaging in nonoperated patients. Clinical, radiological, and pathological data were collected and reevaluated.
We studied 120 patients, 97.5% of whom were drinkers and 97.5% were smokers. Symptoms at clinical onset were acute pancreatitis in 78 patients (65%) and continuous pain in 68 patients (55.8%). Other symptoms were vomiting (36.7%), weight loss (25.8%), and jaundice (11.7%). Cystic variant was diagnosed in 82 patients (68.0%), and solid variant was diagnosed in 38 patients (32.0%). Pure and diffuse forms were observed in 22 (18.3%) and 98 (81.7%) patients, respectively. Pancreatic calcifications were present at clinical onset in 5.0% of the patients and in 61.0% at the end of follow-up. Somatostatin analogs were used in 13 patients (10.8%), and 81 patients (67.0%) underwent surgery.
The clinical profile of PP was found to be middle-aged men who were heavy drinkers and smokers with painful pancreatitis and was associated with vomiting and weight loss. In nonresponders, alcohol withdrawal and medical therapy can be proposed as a first-line treatment, and surgery as a second-line treatment.
Pituitary adenomas may hypersecrete hormones or cause mass effects. Therefore, early diagnosis and treatment are important.
Prevalence of pituitary adenomas ranges from 1 in 865 adults to 1 in 2688 adults. Approximately 50% are microadenomas (&lt;10 mm); the remainder are macroadenomas (≥10 mm). Mass effects cause headache, hypopituitarism, and visual field defects. Treatments include transsphenoidal surgery, medical therapies, and radiotherapy. Prolactinomas account for 32% to 66% of adenomas and present with amenorrhea, loss of libido, galactorrhea, and infertility in women and loss of libido, erectile dysfunction, and infertility in men; they are generally treated with the dopamine agonists cabergoline and bromocriptine. Growth hormone-secreting tumors account for 8% to 16% of tumors and usually present with enlargement of the lips, tongue, nose, hands, and feet and are diagnosed by elevated insulin-like growth factor 1 levels and growth hormone levels; initial treatment is surgical. Medical therapy with somatostatin analogues, cabergoline, and pegvisomant is often also needed. Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)-secreting tumors account for 2% to 6% of adenomas and are associated with obesity, hypertension, diabetes, and other morbidity. Measurement of a late-night salivary cortisol level is the best screening test but petrosal sinus sampling for ACTH may be necessary to distinguish a pituitary from an ectopic source. The primary treatment of Cushing disease (hypercortisolism due to ACTH-producing adenomas, which is the cause in approximately 65% of the cases of hypercortisolism) is adenoma resection and medical therapies including ketoconazole, mifepristone, and pasireotide. Hyperthyroidism due to thyroid-stimulating hormone-secreting tumors accounts for 1% of tumors and is treated with surgery and somatostatin analogues if not surgically cured. Clinically nonfunctioning adenomas account for 15% to 54% of adenomas and present with mass effects; surgery is generally required, although incidentally found tumors can be followed if they are asymptomatic.
Patients with pituitary adenomas should be identified at an early stage so that effective treatment can be implemented. For prolactinomas, initial therapy is generally dopamine agonists. For all other pituitary adenomas, initial therapy is generally transsphenoidal surgery with medical therapy being reserved for those not cured by surgery.
Chordoma is a rare slow-growing neoplasm of neuroectodermal origin, which frequently recurs after removal and has the potential to metastasize. We present the case of a 53-year-old man with metastasizing chordoma who underwent F-FDG and Ga-DOTA-TATE PET/CT for restaging of disease and for evaluation of targeted radionuclide therapy potential. On both F-FDG and Ga-DOTA-TATE PET scans, increased tracer accumulation was observed in chordoma metastases. Besides the increased glucose metabolism in chordoma, this case highlights the potential of Ga-DOTA-TATE PET/CT for restaging of chordoma as well the option of targeted radionuclide therapy in this entity.
Our aim was to comparatively assess dual-tracer PET/CT ((68)Ga-DOTATATE and (18)F-FDG) and multimodality anatomic imaging in studying metastatic neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) of unknown primary (CUP-NETs) scheduled for peptide receptor radionuclide therapy for divergence of tracer uptake on dual-tracer PET/CT, detection of primary, and overall lesion detection vis-a-vis tumor proliferation index (MIB-1/Ki-67). Methods: Fifty-one patients with CUP-NETs (25 men, 26 women; age, 22-74 y), histopathologically proven and thoroughly investigated with conventional imaging modalities (ultrasonography, CT/contrast-enhanced CT, MRI, and endoscopic ultrasound, wherever applicable), were retrospectively analyzed. Patients were primarily referred for deciding on feasibility of peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (except 2 patients), and all had undergone (68)Ga-DOTATATE and (18)F-FDG PET/CT as part of pretreatment workup. The sites of metastases included liver, lung/mediastinum, skeleton, abdominal nodes, and other soft-tissue sites. Patients were divided into 5 groups on the basis of MIB-1/Ki-67 index on a 5-point scale: group I (1%-5%) (n = 35), group II (6%-10%) (n = 8), group III (11%-15%) (n = 4), group IV (16%-20%) (n = 2), and group V (&gt;20%) (n = 2). Semiquantitative analysis of tracer uptake was undertaken by SUVmax of metastatic lesions and the primary (when detected). The SUVmax values were studied over increasing MIB-1/Ki-67 index. The detection sensitivity of (68)Ga-DOTATATE for primary and metastatic lesions was assessed and compared with other imaging modalities including (18)F-FDG PET/CT. Results: Unknown primary was detected on (68)Ga-DOTATATE in 31 of 51 patients, resulting in sensitivity of 60.78% whereas overall lesion detection sensitivity was 96.87%. The overall lesion detection sensitivities (individual groupwise from group I to group V) were 97.75%, 87.5%, 100%, 100%, and 66.67%, respectively. As MIB-1/Ki-67 index increased, (68)Ga-DOTATATE uptake decreased in metastatic and primary lesions (mean SUVmax, 43.5 and 22.68 g/dL in group I to 22.54 and 16.83 g/dL in group V, respectively), whereas (18)F-FDG uptake showed a gradual rise (mean SUVmax, 3.66 and 2.86 g/dL in group I to 7.53 and 9.58 g/dL in group V, respectively). There was a corresponding decrease in the (68)Ga-DOTATATE-to-(18)F-FDG uptake ratio with increasing MIB-1/Ki-67 index (from 11.89 in group I to 2.99 in group V). Conclusion: In CUP-NETs, the pattern of uptake on dual-tracer PET ((68)Ga-DOTATATE and (18)F-FDG) correlates well with tumor proliferation index with a few outliers; combined dual-tracer PET/CT with MIB-1/Ki-67 index would aid in better whole-body assessment of tumor biology in CUP-NETs.
In this article we reported a female patient with type 2 gastric neuroendocrine tumor (NET). The patient developed upper abdominal pain, acid reflux, heartburn, nausea, and vomiting without obvious cause 16 years ago. Later, a tumor was found in her stomach. Two years ago, a solid mass was found at the pancreatic head. Somatostatin receptor scintigraphy showed positive result. Puncture biopsy showed the presence of a NET. The serum gastrin level was significantly increased (3,527 pg/mL) at presentation. A second gastroscopy showed polypoid uplifts in gastric body. Puncture biopsy confirmed the presence of a G2 NET in gastric body. The patient previously had received a pituitary tumor surgery and thyroid gland resection. The diagnosis was multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN-1). The treatments included sutent, lanreotide, and traditional Chinese herbs. In this article we described the diagnosis and treatment of a patient with MEN-1 accompanied with type 2 gastric NET, which may be clinically informative.
Application of imaging mass spectrometry in drug pharmacokinetics remains challenging due to its weak quantitative capability. Herein, an imaging mass microscope (iMScope), equipped with an optical microscope, an atmospheric pressure ion-source chamber for matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (AP-MALDI) and a hybrid quadrupole ion trap time-of-flight (QIT-TOF) analyzer, was first validated and applied to visualize drug disposition in vivo. The distribution and elimination rate of the therapeutic peptide octreotide, a long-acting analogue of the natural hormone somatostatin, was first calculated based on the data determined by iMScope system combining a novel relative exposure strategy. Microspotted pixel-to-pixel quantitative iMScope provided a relative amount of octreotide presented in a thin stomach/intestinal section while preserving its original spatial distribution. The images of dosed mouse stomach clearly demonstrated the transport process of octreotide from the mucosal layer to the muscle side. More importantly, octreotide was found to eliminate from the intestines rapidly, the absorption peak time (Tmax) appeared at 40 min and the half-life time (t1/2) was calculated as 37.7 min according to the elimination curves. Comparisons to the LC-MS/MS data adequately indicated that the quantification approach and methodology based on the iMScope was reliable and practicable for drug pharmacokinetic study.
Acromegaly is a complex endocrine disease with multiple comorbidities. Treatment to obtain biochemical remission includes surgery, medical therapy and radiation. We aimed to describe comorbidities, treatment patterns and cost-of-illness in patients with acromegaly in Sweden.
A nationwide population-based study.
Patients with acromegaly were identified and followed in national registers in Sweden. Longitudinal treatment patterns were assessed in patients diagnosed between July 2005 and December 2013. The cost-of-illness during 2013 was estimated from a societal perspective among patients diagnosed between 1987 and 2013.
Among 358 patients with acromegaly (48% men, mean age at diagnosis 50.0 (s.d. 15.3) years) at least one comorbidity was reported in 81% (n = 290). The most common comorbidities were hypertension (40%, n = 142), neoplasms outside the pituitary (30%, n = 109), hypopituitarism (22%, n = 80) and diabetes mellitus (17%, n = 61). Acromegaly treatment was initiated on average 3.7 (s.d. 6.9) months after diagnosis. Among the 301 treated patients, the most common first-line treatments were surgery (60%, n = 180), somatostatin analogues (21%, n = 64) and dopamine agonists (14%, n = 41). After primary surgery, 24% (n = 44) received somatostatin analogues. The annual per-patient cost was €12 000; this was €8700 and €16 000 if diagnosed before or after July 2005, respectively. The cost-of-illness for acromegaly and its comorbidities was 77% from direct costs and 23% from production loss.
The prevalence of comorbidity is high in patients with acromegaly. The most common first-line treatment in acromegalic patients was surgery followed by somatostatin analogues. The annual per-patient cost of acromegaly and its comorbidities was €12 000.
To study subtype classification of gastric neuroendocrine neoplasm (NEN) and their clinicopathological characteristics in order to provide reference for clinical practice.
Clinicopathological data of 241 gastric NEN patients (174 cases from China-Japan Friendship Hospital and 67 cases from The First Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-Sen University) between January 2011 and June 2016 were retrospectively summarized. According to serum gastrin, 24-hour intragastric pH monitoring and pathological grade, patients with gastric NEN were divided into 4 types: type I( (hypergastrinemia and achlorhydria, related to autoimmune chronic atrophic gastritis), type II( [hypergastrinemia and Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, related to gastrinoma or multiple endocrine neoplasia type I( (MEN-I()], type III( (sporadic disease with normal serum gastrin level), and type IIII( [poorly differentiated gastric neuroendocrine carcinoma (NEC) and mixed adenoneuroendocrine carcinoma (MANEC)]. Clinicopathological features, treatment and prognosis of 4 types were analyzed.
Of 241 gastric NEN cases, there were 86 cases (35.7%) in type I(, 7 cases (2.9%) in type II(, 61 cases (25.3%) in type III( and 87 cases(36.1%) in type IIII(. Among 86 cases of type I( gastric NEN, 73 cases (84.9%) were multiple lesions,tumor size of 66 cases (76.7%) was less than 1 cm, all the 86 cases were polypoid or granular lesions. 2 cases(2.3%)presented distant metastasis, 69 cases (80.2%) had pathological grading as NET G1; most of them received endoscopic surgery treatment and follow-up; somatostatin analogs(SSA) was used in patients with multiple lesions and repeated recurrence after endoscopic treatment. Among 7 cases of type II(, 4 cases were gastrinoma, 3 cases MEN-I(; 5 cases presented distant metastasis; treatment included surgery, SSA and proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy. Among 61 cases of type III( gastric NEN, 49 cases(80.3%) were single lesion,tumor size of 25 cases(41.0%) was more than 2 cm, 29 cases(47.5%) had lymph node metastasis or distant metastasis; treatment included endoscopic resection, surgery or SSA therapy according to the tumor staging. Among 87 patients of type IIII( gastric NEN, 74 cases(85.0%) had single lesion,tumor size of 51 cases (58.6%) was more than 2 cm; lesions were found in gastric cardia in 35 cases (40.2%); 65 cases (74.7%) had lymph node metastasis or distant metastasis; treatment included chemotherapy, or surgery plus chemotherapy. At the end of follow-up(June 30, 2016), 58 patients were dead, including 1 case of type I(, 12 cases of type III( and 45 cases of type IIII(. The overall survival rate of all the patients was 74.2%, and was 98.8%, 100%, 79.3%, 39.2% of types I(, II(, III(, IIII( respectively. The overall survival rate between type III( and type IIII( gastric NEN was significantly different(P = 0.000).
Subtype classification of gastric NEN is very significant for making therapeutic decisions and prognostic evaluation. Patients of type I( or type II( gastric NEN have good prognosis,while those of type III( and type IIII( have poor prognosis, and those of type IIII( have the worst prognosis.
Silent somatotroph tumours are growth hormone (GH) immunoreactive (IR) pituitary tumours without clinical and biological signs of acromegaly. Their better characterisation is required to improve the diagnosis.
Twenty-one silent somatotroph tumours were compared to 59 somatotroph tumours with acromegaly. Tumours in each group were classified into GH and plurihormonal (GH/prolactin (PRL)/±thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH)) and into densely granulated (DG) and sparsely granulated (SG) types. The two groups were then compared with regards to proliferation (Ki-67, p53 indexes and mitotic count), differentiation (expression of somatostatin receptors SSTR2A-SSTR5 and transcription factor Pit-1) and secretory activity (% of GH- and PRL-IR cells).
The silent somatotroph tumours represented 2% of all tested pituitary tumours combined. They were more frequent in women than in men (P = 0.002), more frequently plurihormonal and SG (P &lt; 0.01), with a lower percentage of GH-IR cells (P &lt; 0.0001) compared to those with acromegaly. They all expressed SSTR2A, SSTR5 and Pit-1. The plurihormonal (GH/PRL/±TSH) tumours were mostly observed in women (sex ratio: 3/1) and in patients who were generally younger than those with acromegaly (P &lt; 0.001). They were larger (P &lt; 0.001) with a higher Ki-67 index (P = 0.007).
The silent somatotroph tumours are not uncommon. Their pathological diagnosis requires the immunodetection of GH and Pit-1. They are more frequently plurihormonal and more proliferative than those with acromegaly. A low secretory activity of these tumours might explain the normal plasma values for GH and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) and the absence of clinical signs of acromegaly.
The aim of this review was to summarize the recent developments on the role of positron emission tomography (PET) imaging using different radiopharmaceuticals in patients with multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) syndromes. Although most guidelines do not mention the use of PET imaging in patients with MEN syndromes, recent data seem to suggest a relevant diagnostic role of PET imaging in this setting. In particular, latest evidence has shown that somatostatin receptor PET provides a diagnostic accuracy in detecting MEN syndromes-related neuroendocrine tumours (NETs) higher than that of somatostatin receptor scintigraphy, thus influencing patient management in a significant percentage of cases. (18) F-DOPA PET seems to have a potential role in detecting MEN-2-related NETs, whereas (18) F-FDG PET is potentially useful in identifying aggressive NETs with poorer outcomes. More studies are needed to better define the role of different radiotracer-based PET imaging in patients with MEN syndromes.
Prediabetes is a heterogeneous disorder classified on the basis of fasting glucose concentrations and 2-hour glucose tolerance.
We sought to determine the relative contributions of insulin secretion and action to the pathogenesis of isolated impaired glucose tolerance (IGT).
The study consisted of an oral glucose tolerance test and a euglycemic clamp performed in two cohorts matched for anthropometric characteristics and fasting glucose but discordant for glucose tolerance.
An inpatient clinical research unit at an academic medical center.
Twenty-five subjects who had normal fasting glucose (NFG) and normal glucose tolerance (NGT) and 19 NFG/IGT subjects participated in this study.
Subjects underwent a seven-sample oral glucose tolerance test and a 4-hour euglycemic, hyperinsulinemic clamp on separate occasions. Glucose turnover during the clamp was measured using tracers, and endogenous hormone secretion was inhibited by somatostatin.
We sought to determine whether hepatic glucose metabolism, specifically the contribution of gluconeogenesis to endogenous glucose production, differed between subjects with NFG/NGT and those with NFG/IGT.
Endogenous glucose production did not differ between groups before or during the clamp. Insulin-stimulated glucose disappearance was lower in NFG/IGT (24.6 ± 2.2 vs 35.0 ± 3.6 μmol/kg/min; P = .03). The disposition index was decreased in NFG/IGT (681 ± 102 vs 2231 ± 413 × 10(-14) dL/kg/min(2) per pmol/L; P &lt; .001).
We conclude that innate defects in the regulation of glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis do not contribute to NFG/IGT. However, insulin-stimulated glucose disposal is impaired, exacerbating defects in β-cell function.
The aim of this study was the assessment of utility of somatostatin receptor scintigraphy (SRS) by SPECT imaging using 99mTc-EDDA/HYNIC-Tyr3-octreotide (99mTc-EDDA/HYNIC-TOC) in patients with neuroendocrine neoplasm (NEN) or suspected NEN, referred to Nuclear Medicine Dept. of Voivodship Specialty Center in Rzeszow. The selected group of patients was referred also to 68Ga PET/CT. The posed question was the ratio of patients for whom PET/CT with 68Ga would change their management.
The distribution of somatostatin receptors was imaged using 99mTc-EDDA/HYNIC-TOC in 61 planar and SPECT studies between 13/05/2010 and 04/02/2013 in Nuclear Medicine Dept. of Voivodship Specialty Center in Rzeszow. The patient age was within a range of 17-80, with the average age of 57.6. The average age of women (65% of patients over-all) was 55.6 and the average age of men (35% of patients overall) was 61.4. In 46 participants (75% of the study group), that underwent SRS, NEN was documented using pathology tests. Selected patients were referred to PET/CT with 68Ga labeled somatostatin analogs, DOTATATE or DOTANOC. This study group consisted of 14 female and 10 male participants with age range of 35-77 and average age of 55.5 years. Patients were classified into 3 groups, as follows: detection - referral due to clinical symptoms and/or biochemical markers (CgA-Chromogranin A, IAA-indoleacetic acid) with the aim of primary diagnosis, staging - referral with the aim of assessment of tumor spread, and follow-up - assessment of the therapy.
Out of 61 patients, 24 underwent both 99mTc-EDDA/HYNIC-Tyr3-octreotide SPECT and 68Ga PET/CT. The result of PET/CT was used as a basis for further evaluation. Therefore, the patients were divided into groups; true positive TP (confirmed presence of tissue somatostatin receptors with 68Ga PET/CT) and TN (68Ga PET/CT did not detect any changes and the results were comparable and had the same influence on treatment protocol). In case of SPECT, the results were assigned as follows: TP, TN (in cases where the results were confirmed by 68Ga PET/CT), FP (patient's scintigraphy demonstrated focal change by SPECT but not PET/CT) and FN (99mTc-EDDA/HYNIC-Tyr3-octreotide SPECT failed to demonstrate any abnormalities; however, the treatment protocol was changed after PET/CT).
The accuracy of SPECT diagnosis was found to be as high as 91.6%. Only in 8.4% of patients the additional PET/CT with 68Ga-labeled somatostatin analog changed the treatment protocol.
To quantify the additional value of (68)Ga-DOTA-TATE PET/CT in comparison with contrast-enhanced CT alone for primary tumour detection in neuroendocrine cancer of unknown primary (CUP-NET).
In total, 38 consecutive patients (27 men, 11 women; mean age 62 years) with histologically proven CUP-NET who underwent a contrast-enhanced (68)Ga-DOTA-TATE PET/CT scan for primary tumour detection and staging between 2010 and 2014 were included in this IRB-approved retrospective study. Two blinded readers independently analysed the contrast-enhanced CT and (68)Ga-DOTA-TATE PET datasets separately and noted from which modality they suspected a primary tumour. Consensus was reached if the results were divergent. Postoperative histopathology (24 patients) and follow-up (68)Ga-DOTA-TATE PET/CT imaging (14 patients) served as the reference standards and statistical measures of diagnostic accuracy were calculated accordingly.
The majority of confirmed primary tumours were located in the abdomen (ileum in 19 patients, pancreas in 12, lung in 2, small pelvis in 1). High interobserver agreement was noted regarding the suspected primary tumour site (Cohen's k 0.90, p &lt; 0.001). (68)Ga-DOTA-TATE PET demonstrated a significantly higher sensitivity (94 % vs. 63 %, p = 0.005) and a significantly higher accuracy (87 % vs. 68 %, p = 0.003) than contrast-enhanced CT.
Ga-DOTA-TATE PET/CT compared with contrast-enhanced CT alone provides an improvement in sensitivity of 50 % and an improvement in accuracy of 30 % in primary tumour detection in CUP-NET.
• (68)Ga-DOTA-TATE PET augments the sensitivity of contrast-enhanced CT by 50 % • (68)Ga-DOTA-TATE PET augments the accuracy of contrast-enhanced CT by 30 % • Somatostatin receptor-targeted hybrid imaging optimizes primary tumour detection in CUP-NET.
Follicular dendritic cell sarcoma (FDCS) is a rare low-grade neoplasm with the phenotype of FDC cells. This rare sarcoma has been well known for being mistaken for a variety of neoplasms (mainly meningioma), particularly at extranodal sites. Diagnosis of FDCS mainly relies on characteristic histologic appearance supplemented by immunohistochemistry and electron microscopy. In this study, we reviewed 15 FDCSs retrieved from our consultation files and stained them for newly reported or novel markers (PD-L1, Rb1, MDM2, and somatostatin receptor 2A [SSTR2A]) in addition to conventional FDC markers. Patients were 7 men and 7 women (1 unspecified) with a mean age of 47 years (20-75 years). The tumor site was lymph nodes (6) or spleen (2), both (1) and extranodal sites of head and neck (4) or abdominal cavity (2). Treatment was variable combinations of surgery and aggressive chemotherapy/radiotherapy. Four of 8 patients with follow-up died of disease within 1 to 10 years. All tumors expressed at least 1 FDC marker: CD21 (8/13), CD23 (2/13), CD35 (8/12), CNA.42 (13/14), Clusterin (8/13), Fascin (15/15) and D2-40/podoplanin (7/14). Epstein-Barr virus (EBER-1/2 in situ hybridization) was performed successfully in 10 conventional variants; all were negative. Five of 14 cases (36%) stained strongly for SSTR2A with a distinctive membranous pattern. Residual lymphoid follicles surrounding some of the tumors stained similarly for SSTR2A. Seven (54%) of 13 assessable cases showed moderate to strong membranous staining for PD-L1 in greater than 5% of the neoplastic cells. The Rb1 antigen was lost in 4 (28%) of 14 cases. MDM2 stained less than 5% to 20% of the tumor cells in 5 (36%) of 14 cases; 2 of them showed amplification by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). CDK4 was negative except for weak staining in 1 of 14 cases. This study adds to the existing few clinicopathologic series on FDCS and represents the first study to show MDM2 amplification in this entity. Our results regarding frequent SSTR2A expression in FDCS are novel and might be of potential diagnostic and therapeutic relevance. SSTR2A expression in FDCS represents a further confusing factor when thinking of meningioma which uniformly expresses this receptor. FDCS occurring within the retroperitoneum and/or the abdominal cavity may closely mimic dedifferentiated liposarcoma, particularly if MDM2 positive and/or amplified and should thus be carefully assessed for expression of FDC markers.
Gastric antral vascular ectasia (GAVE) and its nodular antral gastropathy (NAG) variant is a unique lesion associated with hypergastrinemic hormonal alterations that may be compounded by concurrent proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy. The use of octreotide as a somatostatin analogue and its role in the down regulation of variousenteric hormones has been well documented however its use in the management of NAG has not been widely reported. We herein present a case where octreotide induced gastrin down-regulation as well as PPI cessation facilitated NAG resolution.
To gain insight into the histopathological responses and molecular targets in the inhibition of growth of human gastric cancer treated with celecoxib (a cyclooxygenase [COX]-2 inhibitor) combined with octreotide.
Seventy five patients with gastric cancer undergoing curative gastrectomy or extended resection were randomly divided into 3 groups. The apoptosis of tumor cells was measured by terminal deoxynucleotide transferase-mediated dUTP nick endlabeling (TUNEL) assay. Gastric cancer microvessel density (MVD) and the expression of COX-2 were evaluated by immunohistochemical staining. The expression of somatostatin receptor (SSTR)-2 was detected with the biomolecular interaction analysis system. The transcription of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug-activated gene (NAG)-1 was measured by RT-PCR.
Compared with the control and celecoxib groups, more necrosis in the combination group was observed. The apoptotic rate in the combination group (7.06%+/-0.67%) was significantly higher than that in the control group (6.23%+/-1.29%, P&lt;0.05). The MVD decreased considerably in the combination group. The upregulation of NAG-1 was displayed both in the celecoxib and combination groups. The positive rate of SSTR-2 in gastric cancers treated with celecoxib (48%) was significantly higher than that of control group (12%) after surgery (P&lt;0.05).
Celecoxib combined with octreotide significantly promoted necrosis in gastric adenocarcinoma through the induction of apoptosis and the reduction of MVD. NAG-1 and SSTR-2 might be the molecular targets for celecoxib or octreotide.
We used tracer and arteriovenous difference techniques in conscious dogs to determine the effect of nonesterified fatty acids (NEFAs) on net hepatic glucose uptake (NHGU). The protocol included equilibration ([3-(3)H]glucose), basal, and two experimental periods (-120 to -30, -30 to 0, 0-120 [period 1], and 120-240 min [period 2], respectively). During periods 1 and 2, somatostatin, basal intraportal insulin and glucagon, portal glucose (21.3 micromol.kg(-1).min(-1)), peripheral glucose (to double the hepatic glucose load), and peripheral nicotinic acid (1.5 mg.kg(-1).min(-1)) were infused. During period 2, saline (nicotinic acid [NA], n = 7), lipid emulsion (NA plus lipid emulsion [NAL], n = 8), or glycerol (NA plus glycerol [NAG], n = 3) was infused peripherally. During period 2, the NA and NAL groups differed (P &lt; 0.05) in rates of NHGU (10.5 +/- 2.08 and 4.7 +/- 1.9 micromol.g(-1).min(-1)), respectively, endogenous glucose R(a) (2.3 +/- 1.4 and 10.6 +/- 1.0 micromol.kg(-1).min(-1)), net hepatic NEFA uptakes (0.1 +/- 0.1 and 1.8 +/- 0.2 micromol.kg(-1).min(-1)), net hepatic beta-hydroxybutyrate output (0.1 +/- 0.0 and 0.4 +/- 0.1 micromol.kg(-1).min(-1)), and net hepatic lactate output (6.5 +/- 1.7 vs. -2.3 +/- 1.2 micromol.kg(-1).min(-1)). Hepatic glucose uptake and release were 2.6 micro mol. kg(-1). min(-1) less and 3.5 micro mol. kg(-1). min(-1) greater, respectively, in the NAL than NA group (NS). The NAG group did not differ significantly from the NA group in any of the parameters listed above. In the presence of hyperglycemia and relative insulin deficiency, elevated NEFAs reduce NHGU by stimulating hepatic glucose release and suppressing hepatic glucose uptake.
Human presenilin-1 (PS1) mutations are associated with the incidence of familial Alzheimer's disease. The present study evaluated the behavioral and neurochemical effects of the L235P mutation (substitution of leucine by proline at codon 235) of the human PS1 gene, which has been linked to a form of early-onset Alzheimer's disease. Except for a significant increase in the production of beta-amyloid-42, the mutant mice did not show any overt signs of Alzheimer-like neuropathology in the form of plaque formation, changes in choline acetyltransferase activity, or somatostatin content in the brain. Cognitive assays indicated that the mutation did not affect the acquisition or reversal of a spatial reference memory task in the water maze or performance on a spatial working memory task. In contrast, L235P PS1 transgenic mice exhibited a significant impairment in a test of spontaneous object recognition. This dissociation is suggestive of a preferential impairment of the extrahippocampal memory system and is consistent with what has been reported in another pathological mutation (substitution of leucine by valine at codon 286) of the PS1 gene.
Intraventricular infusion of rats with beta-amyloid for 14 days resulted in memory deficit in the water maze as well as decreases in choline acetyltransferase activities and somatostatin levels in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus. These changes were not altered by daily intraperitoneal injection of 20 mg/Kg melatonin. Orally administered Ginkgo biloba extract, however, partially reversed the memory deficit and the decrease in choline actyltransferase activities in the hippocampus. The latter treatment failed to reverse the decrease in somatostatin levels. The results indicate that orally administered Ginkgo biloba extract can protect the brain against beta-amyloid from changes leading to memory deficit through its effect on the cholinergic system.
Young (3 months old) and aging (18-21 months old) rats were infused intracerebroventricularly with beta-amyloid (1-40; 4.2 nmol) for 14 days. In both age groups, beta-amyloid led to deficits in water-maze and decreased choline acetyltransferase activity and somatostatin levels. Cortical substance P levels also decreased whereas neuropeptide Y levels remained unaltered. There were no significant age dependent differences among these neurochemicals except a decrease in hippocampal neuropeptide Y levels in the aging group. It is concluded that young and aging rat brains respond similarly to beta-amyloid infusion.
The present study investigated the neurochemical and behavioural sequelae following chronic intracerebroventricular infusion of beta-amyloid (1-40) in rats. beta-amyloid was either infused intermittently via implanted cannulae on the day of operation and subsequently on postsurgical days 4, 7, 10, and 13 (Experiment 1), or continuously using osmotic pumps for 14 days (Experiment 2). The same amount of beta-amyloid was delivered under both infusion regimes. In both experiments, beta-amyloid infusion led to severe deficits in the acquisition of a spatial reference memory task conducted on postoperative days 10 to 14. The animals were sacrificed on the postoperative day 15 for neurochemical analyses. These included radioenzymatic and radioimmunoassays, designed to determine choline acetyltransferase activity and the contents of neuropeptides (somatostatin, substance P, and neuropeptide Y), respectively. Experiment 2 also included solution-hybridisation-RNAase protection assay for preprosomatostatin mRNA quantification. There was a significant reduction in choline acetyltransferase activity and in the levels of substance P as well as somatostatin and preprosomatostatin mRNA in the cortical mantle of beta-amyloid-treated rats, compared to controls in both experiments. Appreciable reductions in choline acetyltransferase activity and somatostatin level were also apparent in the hippocampus. In contrast, beta-amyloid infusion did not significantly affect the brain level of neuropeptide Y. The present study demonstrated that chronic infusion of beta-amyloid can lead to a reduction in the levels of selected neuropeptides resembling the pattern seen in Alzheimer's disease patients.
Impairment of the basal forebrain cholinergic system is an important change in the brains of Alzheimer's disease patients. Various neurotoxins have been used to achieve this in animal models. In this study the effects of chemical lesions by ibotenic acid (IBO), a glutamate analogue and by 192 IgG-saporin, a highly specific immunotoxin against cholinergic neurons, were investigated. The toxins were delivered stereotaxically into the brains of young Sprague-Dawley rats which were later sacrificed by decapitation. Choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) activity was measured by radioenzymatic assay and substance P (SP), neuropeptide Y (NPY) and somatostatin (SOM) levels by radioimmunoassay. Decreased ChAT and SOM levels were observed in the cortex and the hippocampus in both experiments. Cortical SP levels were increased after IBO lesions but were unaffected after 192 IgG-saporin lesions. NPY levels remained unchanged in both experiments. The results indicate that there were specific changes in neuropeptide contents in the cortex and hippocampus in response to cholinergic damage in the rat brain.
Perineuronal nets (PNNs) are closely associated with parvalbumin-positive (PV+) neurons, and play a major role in controlling developmental neural plasticity. Considering the recent advances in classification of PV+ neurons, here we aimed to clarify whether PNNs might be associated with specific subclasses of PV+ neurons in the hippocampus. In this study, we labeled PNNs by Wisteria floribunda agglutinin (WFA), and classified PV+ neurons based on the combination of cellular location, molecular expression (neuropeptide Y [NPY], somatostatin [SOM], special AT-rich sequence-binding protein-1 [SATB1]), and retrograde tracing through stereotaxic injection of Fluoro-Gold (FG) into the medial septum. The criteria of each subclass can be summarized as follows: axo-axonic cells, PV+/SATB1-/NPY- cells in the stratum pyramidale; basket cells, PV+/SATB1+/NPY- cells in the stratum pyramidale; bistratified cells, PV+/SATB1+/NPY+ cells in the stratum pyramidale; oriens-lacunosum-moleculare (O-LM) cells, PV+/SOM+/FG- cells in the stratum oriens; hippocampo-septal projection (H-S) cells, and PV+/SOM+/FG+ cells in the stratum oriens. The ratios of formation of WFA+ PNNs around each subclass of PV+ neurons were estimated according to the optical disector principle. The vast majority (over 90%) of putative PV+ basket cells were surrounded by PNNs, while only a minor population (less than 10%) of putative PV+ axo-axonic, O-LM, and H-S cells were enwrapped with PNNs. The ratios of formation of PNNs around putative PV+ bistratified cells were intermediate (25-50%). These findings indicate that PNNs may be specifically associated with PV+ basket cells, and also provide a key to understand the functional significance of PNNs and PV+ neurons in the hippocampus.
Although the kinetic characteristics of hepatic glucokinase (GK) suggest its potential role as the hepatic "glucose sensor," its impact on the regulation of in vivo hepatic glucose production (HGP) is still controversial. Since decreased GK activity has been linked to experimental and human diabetes, we examined whether a moderate and transient inhibition of GK activity diminishes the ability of hyperglycemia to suppress HGP. We first determined the concentration of the competitive inhibitor, glucosamine (GlcN), which decreases hepatic GK activity by approximately 60% in vitro. GlcN was then infused into conscious rats to achieve a similar inhibition of the in vivo GK activity (plasma GlcN levels = approximately 2 mmol/l; rats infused with saline served as control, n = 20). To maintain equal plasma insulin and glucagon concentrations throughout the studies, somatostatin and insulin (basal replacement) were infused for 4 h. [3-(3H)]-glucose and [U-(14C)]-lactate were infused to measure HGP, gluconeogenesis, and glucose cycling (GC) during 2 h of euglycemia (glucose approximately 8 mmol/l) followed by 2 h of hyperglycemia (glucose approximately 18 mmol/l). Our results support the notion that hepatic GK activity is indeed decreased by GlcN in vivo. In fact, in response to hyperglycemia the "direct" pathway of hepatic glucose-6-phosphate (G-6-P) formation was approximately 40% lower with GlcN compared with saline infusion (37 +/- 3 vs. 63 +/- 3%; P &lt; 0.001). Furthermore, while hyperglycemia stimulated GC by approximately 2.5-fold during saline infusion (from 3.0 +/- 0.6 to 7.7 +/- 1.4 mg.kg-1.min-1, P &lt; 0.001, euglycemia vs. hyperglycemia), this increase was blunted in the presence of GlcN (4.6 +/- 0.6 mg.kg-1.min-1, P = NS). Finally, in the presence of GlcN, the hepatic concentration of G-6-P was decreased by approximately 40% compared with saline (234 +/- 38 and 390 +/- 24 nmol/g, P &lt; 0.01). During the euglycemic studies, HGP was similar (12.6 +/- 0.6 and 11.3 +/- 0.2 mg .kg-1.min-1 with GlcN or saline infusion, respectively). However, while hyperglycemia per se suppressed HGP by approximately 65%, HGP was inhibited by approximately 38% and it was approximately twofold higher than in the saline-infused rats (7.8 +/- 0.8 and 4.0 +/- 0.3 mg.kg-1.min-1, P &lt; 0.01) in the presence of GlcN-induced inhibition of hepatic GK. This increase in HGP was largely accounted for by the decreased inhibition of hepatic net glycogenolysis by hyperglycemia (3.3 +/- 0.8 and 1.1 +/- 0.3 mg.kg-1.min-1 with GlcN or saline infusion, respectively, P &lt; 0.01). We conclude that intact GK activity is required for the normal suppression of HGP by hyperglycemia and its impairment may contribute to increased HGP in experimental and human diabetes.
Mucous cells and enteroendocrine cells of the pyloric region of the ruin lizard (Podarcis sicula campestris De Betta) have been examined by lectin histochemical and immunohistochemical methods. Binding to five plant lectins (Canavalia ensiformis, Con A; Triticum vulgare, wheat germ, WGL; Lotus tetragonolobus, winged pea, WPL; Glycine max, soybean, SBL; Arachis hypogaea, peanut, PNL) was performed to characterize glycoconjugates in the secretory products of superficial and glandular mucous cells. Lectin histochemistry revealed the presence of N-acetyl-D-galactosamine, D-galactose and N-acetyl-D-glucosamine in the pyloric superficial cells. Mucous glandular cells mainly contained neutral glycoproteins with terminal residues of galactose, N-acetyl-D-glucosamine and N-acetyl-D-galactosamine. These cells did not react with Con A after periodate oxidation-sodium borohydride reduction (Paradoxical Con A staining). In the pyloric glands three different types of endocrine cells were identified immunohistochemically: gastrin-, serotonin- and somatostatin-immunoreactive cells; VIP-, bombesin- or cholecystokinin-immunoreactive cells have not been found in the pyloric mucosa.
We characterized structurally the receptors for somatostatin in rat cerebral cortex by affinity labeling with [125I-Tyr1] somatostatin. [125I-Tyr1] somatostatin was cross-linked to cerebrocortical membranes using photoreactive cross-linker: N-5-azido-2-nitrobenzoyloxy-succinimide. Analysis by autoradiography revealed a broad band centered at Mr = 72,000 in the presence or absence of dithiothreitol. Affinity labeling of and specific [125I-Tyr1] somatostatin binding to cerebrocortical membranes were decreased similarly by adding unlabeled somatostatin or nonhydrolyzable guanine nucleotide analogue, guanyl-5'-yl imidodiphosphate, in a dose dependent manner. The pretreatment of cerebrocortical membranes with islet activating protein resulted in a decrease in subsequent affinity labeling of the protein. The cross-linked protein could be solubilized with Zwittergent 3-12 and poorly with digitonin, triton X-100 and NP-40. When exposed to agarose-coupled lectins, the solubilized labeled protein was absorbed to wheat germ agglutinin, partially to ricin communis-II, and not to concanavalin A or lentil lectin. The Mr = 72,000 protein bound to wheat germ agglutinin-agarose was eluted with not only N,N',N"-triacetylchitotriose but also N-acetylglucosamine. These results suggest that somatostatin receptors on cerebrocortical membranes are a monomeric glycoprotein with a Mr = 70,000 containing no disulfide-linked binding subunit, which is coupled to islet activating protein-sensitive guanine nucleotide regulatory protein.
Somatostatin receptors of plasma membranes from beta cells of hamster insulinoma were covalently labelled with 125I-[Leu8,D-Trp22,Tyr25]somatostatin-28 (125I-somatostatin-28) and solubilized with the non-denaturing detergent Triton X-100. Analysis by SDS/PAGE and autoradiography revealed three specific 125I-somatostatin-28 receptor complexes with similar molecular masses (228 kDa, 128 kDa and 45 kDa) to those previously identified [Cotroneo, P., Marie, J.-C. &amp; Rosselin, G. (1988) Eur. J. Biochem. 174, 219-224]. The major labelled complex (128 kDa) was adsorbed to a wheat-germ-agglutinin agarose column and eluted by N-acetylglucosamine. Also, the binding of 125I-somatostatin-28 to plasma membranes was specifically inhibited by the GTP analog, guanosine-5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) (GTP[S]) in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, when somatostatin-28 receptors were solubilized by Triton X-100 as a reversible complex with 125I-somatostatin-28, GTP[S] specifically dissociated the bound ligand to a larger extent from the soluble receptors than from the plasma-membrane-embedded receptors, the radioactivity remaining bound after 15 min at 37 degrees C being 30% and 83% respectively. After pertussis-toxin-induced [32P]ADP-ribosylation of pancreatic membranes, a 41-kDa [32P]ADP-ribose-labelled inhibitory guanine nucleotide binding protein coeluted with the 128-kDa and 45-kDa receptor complexes. The labelling of both receptor proteins was sensitive to GTP[S]. The labelling of the 228-kDa band was inconsistent. These results support the conclusion that beta cell somatostatin receptors can be solubilized as proteins of 128 kDa and 45 kDa. The major labeled species corresponds to the 128-kDa band and is a glycoprotein. The pancreatic membrane contains a 41-kDa GTP-binding protein that can complex with somatostatin receptors.
Somatostatin binding and cross-linking to its receptors on rat cerebrocortical membranes were characterized with [125I-Tyr1]somatostatin-14 and [125I-Leu8, D-Trp22, Tyr25]somatostatin-28. When [125I-Tyr1]somatostatin-14 was cross-linked to its receptors with the photoreactive cross-linker, N-(5-azido-2-nitrobenzoyloxy)succinimide, the hormone was specifically associated with a Mr = 72,000 protein band in the presence or absence of reducing agents. Affinity labeling of the Mr = 72,000 protein band was decreased with increasing concentrations of unlabeled somatostatin-14 and nonhydrolyzable guanine nucleotide analog, guanyl-5'-yl imidodiphosphate (Gpp(NH)p). Pretreatment of cerebrocortical membranes with islet-activating protein resulted in a decrease in subsequent labeled somatostatin-14 binding and affinity-labeling of the protein and abolished an inhibitory effect of somatostatin-14 on vasoactive intestinal peptide-stimulated increase in adenylate cyclase activity. When the affinity-labeled protein was solubilized with Zwittergent 3-12 and adsorbed to wheat germ agglutinin-agarose, it was eluted by N-acetylglucosamine. [125I-Leu8, D-Trp22, Tyr25]somatostatin-28 cross-linking to cerebrocortical and pancreatic membranes with the same photoreactive agent revealed specifically labeled protein bands of a Mr = 74,000 in cerebrocortical membranes and a Mr = 94,000 in pancreatic membranes, respectively. These results suggest that: 1) somatostatin receptor on cerebrocortical membranes is a monomeric glycoprotein with a Mr = 70,000 binding subunit, coupled to guanine nucleotide regulatory protein, and 2) the Mr = 70,000 protein may be a common receptor for somatostatin-28 and somatostatin-14 and is distinct from a common pancreatic type receptor.
To structurally characterize the somatostatin receptor in the anterior pituitary, the chemical cross-linking reagent N-5-azido-nitrobenzoyloxysuccinimide was used to attach covalently [125I-Tyr11]somatostatin-14 to its receptor in pituitary membranes. Rat anterior pituitary membranes were incubated with [125I-Tyr11]somatostatin-14, washed, and then treated with 100 microM cross-linker, which was activated by exposure to UV light. Gel electrophoresis followed by autoradiography revealed a broad band centered at 88,000 mol wt. The appearance of this band was unaffected by dithiothreitol. Competitive inhibition of binding by unlabeled somatostatin resulted in a parallel inhibition of labeling of the 88,000 mol wt protein. The addition of guanine nucleotides in concentrations that inhibit binding similarly inhibited cross-linking. The cross-linked membranes were solubilized in Zwittergent 3-12, a nondenaturing detergent, and the glycosylation pattern of the labeled protein was investigated by incubation with various lectins coupled to agarose. The cross-linked protein was selectively adsorbed by wheat germ agglutinin, and this interaction was blocked by the addition of N,N',N"-triacetylchitotriose, indicating that the rat anterior pituitary somatostatin receptor is a glycoprotein containing polymeric beta-1-4 linked N-acetylglucosamine groups. The results of this study show that the rat anterior pituitary somatostatin receptor is a glycoprotein of 88,000 mol wt containing no disulfide-linked subunits.
The receptor for somatostatin present in rat pancreatic plasma membranes was characterized by affinity labeling with [125I-Tyr11]somatostatin utilizing three different heterobifunctional cross-linking agents: N-5-azido-2-nitrobenzoyloxy-succinimide, N-succinimidyl 6-(4-azido 2'-nitrophenylamine)hexanoate, and N-hydroxysuccinimidyl 4-azido-benzoate. Analysis by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography revealed a broad band of Mr = 92,000 when any of the three cross-linkers was used; N-succinimidyl 6-(4-azido 2'-nitrophenylamine), however, was most efficient. Labeling of the Mr = 92,000 protein band was not affected by reducing agents but was sensitive to somatostatin and guanine nucleotides, particularly GTP gamma S, at concentrations which reduced binding to the receptor. The affinity-labeled protein could be solubilized completely with Zwittergent 3-12, partially with Triton X-100 and 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid, and poorly with Zwittergent 3-08 and digitonin. When exposed to agarose-coupled lectins, the detergent solubilized, labeled Mr = 92,000 protein was completely adsorbed to wheat germ agglutinin, partially to ricin communis II, and not at all to concanavalin A or lotus or lentil lectin. The Mr = 92,000 protein bound to wheat germ agglutinin-agarose was not eluted by N-acetylglucosamine but was by triacetylchitotriose, providing a considerable purification of the somatostatin receptor. These data allow us to conclude that the somatostatin receptor is a monomeric glycoprotein with an Mr = 90,000 binding subunit which probably contains a polymeric arrangement of N-acetylglucosamine residues.
Results from recent studies have indicated that pancreatic islet prohormone converting enzymes are membrane-associated in islet microsomes and secretory granules. This observation, along with the demonstration that proglucagon is topologically segregated to the periphery within alpha cell secretory granules in several species, led us to investigate the possibility that newly synthesized islet prohormones might be associated with intracellular membranes. Anglerfish islets were incubated with [3H]tryptophan and [14C]isoleucine for 3 h, then fractionated by differential and density gradient centrifugation. Microsome (M) and secretory granule (SG) fractions were halved, sedimented, and resuspended in the presence or absence of dissociative reagents. After membrane lysis by repeated freezing and thawing, the membranous and soluble components were separated by centrifugation. Extracts of supernatants and pellets were chromatographed by gel filtration; fractions were collected and counted. A high proportion (77-79%) of the newly synthesized proinsulin and insulin was associated with both M and SG membranes. Most of the newly synthesized proglucagons and prosomatostatins (12,000-mol-wt precursors) were also membrane-associated (86-88%) in M and SG. In contrast, glucagon- and somatostatin-related peptides exhibited much less membrane-association in SG (24-31%). Bacitracin, bovine serum albumin EDTA, RNAse, alpha-methylmannoside, N-acetylglucosamine, and dithiodipyridine had no effect on prohormone association with membranes. However, high salt (1 M KCl) significantly reduced membrane-association of prohormones. Binding of labeled prohormones to SG membranes from unlabeled tissue increased with incubation time and was inhibited by unlabeled prohormones. The pH optimum for prohormone binding to both M and SG membranes was 5.2. It is suggested that association of newly synthesized prohormones with intracellular membranes could be related to the facilitation of proteolytic processing of prohormones and/or transport from their site of synthesis to the secretory granules.
The interaction between the gut hormones and the immune system has been suggested to serve an important role in the pathophysiology of inflammatory bowel disease. The aims of the present study were to elucidate the possible abnormalities in the colonic endocrine cells in rats with dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)‑induced colitis, and to determine whether they are correlated with alterations in the immune cells. A total of 24 male Wistar rats were divided into two groups: Control and DSS‑induced colitis. Colonic tissues were harvested via postmortem laparotomy from all of the animals at the end of the experimental period, and fixed and sectioned for histology. The colonic endocrine and immune cells in those tissue samples were immunostained and their densities quantified by computerized image analysis. The densities of chromogranin A, serotonin, peptide YY and oxyntomodulin cells were significantly higher, and those of pancreatic peptide and somatostatin cells were lower in rats with DSS‑induced colitis than in the controls. The densities of mucosal leukocytes, T and B lymphocytes, macrophages/monocytes, and mast cells were significantly higher than in the controls, and these changes were closely associated with the aforementioned changes in all endocrine cell types. These observations indicate an interaction between intestinal hormones and the immune system as represented by immune cells.
At birth, a male child presented a 6 cm tumour in the right leg. The tumour was partially removed after just 12 days. Histology showed a congenital fibrosarcoma associated with reactive lymphadenitis. A first cycle of adjuvant chemotherapy did not prevent the rapid progression of the disease. Subsequent evaluation for surgical removal raised serious concerns due to the need for a major operation involving total amputation of the right leg and hemipelvectomy. Since surgery could not exclude the possibility of disease recurrence and since the traditional cycles of chemotherapy did not offer any possibility of a cure, the parents opted for the Di Bella Method. The combined use of Somatostatin, Melatonin, Retinoids solubilized in Vit. E, Vit. C, Vit. D3, Calcium, and Chondroitin sulfate associated with low doses of Cyclophosphamide resulted in a complete objective response, still present 14 years later, with no toxicity and without the need for hospitalization, allowing a normal quality of life and perfectly normal adolescent psycho-physical development.
We evaluate a set of protocols for preparation of the secretome from murine islets of Langerhans for bottom-up proteomic analysis. Of the protocols evaluated, a filter-aided sample preparation based approach using sodium dodecyl sulfate as a detergent to solubilize proteins generated the most protein identifications. A total of 362 protein groups (average of 3.7 peptides/protein) were identified from the secretome using the SDS-FASP protocol; a combination of data from three protocols generated 413 protein group identifications. As expected, the identified proteins included insulin 1 and 2, somatostatin, and glucagon, the four main secreted components from islets. STRING network analysis classified the other proteins as being associated with extracellular exosomes, membrane-bounded vesicles, vesicles, and the extracellular region.
The aim of this study was to determine the effects of two anti-inflammatory agents on the abnormalities in colonic endocrine cells in dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced colitis. Colitis was induced in male Wistar rats (n=45) using DSS; a further 15 rats without colitis were included in a healthy control group. The animals with DSS-induced colitis were randomly divided into 3 treatment groups as follows: i) DSS group, rats were treated with 0.5 ml of 0.5% carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC); ii) DSS‑G group, rats were treated with 3-[(dodecylthiocarbonyl)‑methyl]‑glutarimide (DTCM‑G), a novel activator protein 1 (AP-1) inhibitor, 20 mg/kg in CMC; and iii) DSS‑Q group, rats were treated with dehydroxymethylepoxyquinomicin, a nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) inhibitor, 15 mg/kg in CMC. The treatments were administered intraperitoneally, twice daily for 5 days, after which the animals were sacrificed and tissue samples from the colon were immunostained for chromogranin A (CgA), serotonin, peptide YY (PYY), enteroglucagon, pancreatic polypeptide (PP), somatostatin, leukocytes, B/T lymphocytes, B lymphocytes, T lymphocytes, macrophages/monocytes and mast cells. The densities of these endocrine and immune cells were quantified by computer‑aided image analysis. The densities of CgA-, serotonin-, PYY- and enteroglucagon-producing cells were significantly higher, and those of PP- and somatostatin-producing cells were significantly lower in the DSS‑G, DSS‑Q and control groups than in the DSS group. The densities of all the immune cells were lower in the DSS‑G, DSS‑Q and control groups than in the DSS group. The densities of all endocrine cell types and immune cells in both the DSS groups treated with anti‑inflammatory agents were restored to control levels. In conclusion, our data demonstrate that there is an interaction between endocrine and immune cells during inflammation. This interaction with subsequent changes in endocrine cells is responsible for the clinical manifestation of colitis symptoms.
Tight junction plays a critical role in intestinal defence. The alteration and perturbation of tight junction proteins could induce intestine barrier damage, and lead to the malabsorption of electrolytes and water. Previous studies had showed that colonic infection and inflammation could lead to the alteration of tight junction function, and somatostatin could protect intestinal epithelia. Thus, this study could explore that whether somatostatin could regulate tight junction in colitis mice. Colitis mice with diarrhea were induced by Citrobacter rodentium (CR) and Dextran sulfate sodium (DSS). In CR infected model, cladudin-1 and claudin-3 expression significantly decreased compared with the control mice (P&lt;0.05); after octreotide treatment, claudin-1 and claudin-3 expression significantly increased compared with untreated CR infected mice (P&lt;0.05). In DSS colitis model, occludin and claudin-3 expression significantly decreased compared with the control mice (P&lt;0.05); and octreotide treatment could only significantly upregulate claudin-3 expression compared with untreated DSS colitis mice (P&lt;0.05). To testify our results in vivo, we repeated the models in caco-2 cells by exposed with enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (E. Coli) and Tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α). The results in vitro were consistent with in vivo study. The results suggested that somatostatin play a role in intestinal barrier protection by modulating tight junction proteins expression.
As the population is ageing globally, both ageing and obesity are recognized as major public health challenges. The aim of this narrative review is to present and discuss the current evidence on the changes in body composition, energy balance and endocrine environment that occur in the ageing man. Obesity in the ageing man is related to changes in both body weight and composition due to alterations in energy intake and total energy expenditure. In addition, somatopenia (decreased GH secretion), late-onset hypogonadism (LOH), changes in thyroid and adrenal function, as well as changes in appetite-related peptides (leptin, ghrelin) and, most importantly, insulin action are related to obesity, abnormal energy balance, redistribution of the adipose tissue and sarcopenia (decreased muscle mass). A better understanding of the complex relationship of ageing-related endocrine changes and obesity could lead to more effective interventions for elderly men.
Fibrosis represents a major complication of several chronic diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Treatment of IBD remains a clinical challenge despite several recent therapeutic advances. Melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) is a hypothalamic neuropeptide shown to regulate appetite and energy balance. However, accumulating evidence suggests that MCH has additional biological effects, including modulation of inflammation. In the present study, we examined the efficacy of an MCH-blocking antibody in treating established, dextran sodium sulfate-induced experimental colitis. Histological and molecular analysis of mouse tissues revealed that mice receiving anti-MCH had accelerated mucosal restitution and lower colonic expression of several proinflammatory cytokines, as well as fibrogenic genes, including COL1A1. In parallel, they spared collagen deposits seen in the untreated mice, suggesting attenuated fibrosis. These findings raised the possibility of perhaps direct effects of MCH on myofibroblasts. Indeed, in biopsies from patients with IBD, we demonstrate expression of the MCH receptor MCHR1 in α-smooth muscle actin(+) subepithelial cells. CCD-18Co cells, a primary human colonic myofibroblast cell line, were also positive for MCHR1. In these cells, MCH acted as a profibrotic modulator by potentiating the effects of IGF-1 and TGF-β on proliferation and collagen production. Thus, by virtue of combined anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic effects, blocking MCH might represent a compelling approach for treating IBD.
To clarify the role of mast cells and neuropeptides substance P (SP), somatostatin (SS), and vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) in dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis in rats.
Experimental colitis was induced in Sprague-Dawley rats (180-200 g, n=20) by oral ingestion of 4% (w/v) DSS in drinking water for 7 days. Control rats (n=5) drank water and were sacrificed on day 0. Mast cell number, histamine levels in whole blood and tissue, tissue levels of SP, SS and, VIP in the distal colon of the rats were measured on day 8, day 13, and day 18 of experimentation.
Oral administration of 4% DSS solution for 7 days resulted in surface epithelial loss and crypt loss in the distal colon. Mast cell count increased on day 8 (1.75±1.09/mm vs. 0.38±0.24/mm, P&lt;0.05) and day 13 (1.55±1.01/mm vs. 0.38±0.24/mm, P&lt;0.05) after DSS treatment. Whole blood histamine levels were increased on day 8 (266.93±35.62 ng/mL vs. 76.87±32.28 ng/mL, P&lt;0.01) and gradually decreased by day 13 and day 18 after DSS treatment. Histamine levels in the distal colon were decreased on day 8 (1.77±0.65 ng/mg vs. 3.06±0.87 ng/mg, P&lt;0.05) and recovered to control levels by day 13 after DSS treatment. SP level in the distal colon gradually increased and were raised significantly by day 13 (8777.14±3056.14 pg/mL vs. 4739.66±3299.81 pg/mL, P&lt;0.05) after DSS treatment. SS and VIP levels in the distal colon were not changed.
Mast cell degranulation followed by histamine release may play an important role in the pathogenesis of colitis induced by DSS. SP may be a significant substance in the progression of inflammation and the recovery process of DSS-induced colitis.
Melatonin (N-acetyl-5-methoxytryptamine, MLT), the main hormone produced by the pineal gland, not only regulates circadian rhythm, but also has antioxidant, anti-ageing and immunomodulatory properties. MLT plays an important role in blood composition, medullary dynamics, platelet genesis, vessel endothelia, and in platelet aggregation, leukocyte formula regulation and hemoglobin synthesis. Its significant atoxic, apoptotic, oncostatic, angiogenetic, differentiating and antiproliferative properties against all solid and liquid tumors have also been documented. Thanks, in fact, to its considerable functional versatility, MLT can exert both direct and indirect anticancer effects in factorial synergy with other differentiating, antiproliferative, immunomodulating and trophic molecules that form part of the anticancer treatment formulated by Luigi Di Bella (Di Bella Method, DBM: somatostatin, retinoids, ascorbic acid, vitamin D3, prolactin inhibitors, chondroitin-sulfate). The interaction between MLT and the DBM molecules counters the multiple processes that characterize the neoplastic phenotype (induction, promotion, progression and/or dissemination, tumoral mutation). All these particular characteristics suggest the use of MLT in oncological diseases.
Melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) is an evolutionary conserved hypothalamic neuropeptide that in mammals primarily regulates appetite and energy balance. We have recently identified a novel role for MCH in intestinal inflammation by demonstrating attenuated experimental colitis in MCH deficient mice or wild type mice treated with an anti-MCH antibody. Therefore, targeting MCH has been proposed for the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease. Given the link between chronic intestinal inflammation and colorectal cancer, in the present study we sought to investigate whether blocking MCH might have effects on intestinal tumorigenesis that are independent of inflammation.
Tumor development was evaluated in MCH-deficient mice crossed to the APCmin mice which develop spontaneously intestinal adenomas. A different cohort of MCH-/- and MCH+/+ mice in the APCmin background was treated with dextran sodium sulphate (DSS) to induce inflammation-dependent colorectal tumors. In Caco2 human colorectal adenocarcinoma cells, the role of MCH on cell survival, proliferation and apoptosis was investigated.
APCmin mice lacking MCH developed fewer, smaller and less dysplastic tumors in the intestine and colon which at the molecular level are characterized by attenuated activation of the wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway and increased apoptotic indices. Form a mechanistic point of view, MCH increased the survival of colonic adenocarcinoma Caco2 cells via inhibiting apoptosis, consistent with the mouse studies.
In addition to modulating inflammation, MCH was found to promote intestinal tumorigenesis at least in part by inhibiting epithelial cell apoptosis. Thereby, blocking MCH as a therapeutic approach is expected to decrease the risk for colorectal cancer.
Somatostatinoma is a rare neuroendocrine tumor which especially develops in the pancreas. There are few communicated cases about extra-pancreatic localization, having as a particularity the absence of somatostatin hypersecretion syndrome and frequent association with von Recklinghausen neurofibromatosis. We present the case of a 42-year old patient with Von Recklinghausen neurofibromatosis admitted in our clinic with a chronic upper digestive obstruction syndrome. The presence of a first jejunal loop somatostatinoma was an intraoperative surprising diagnosis that imposed jejunal resection and association of complementary specific treatment. Despite the therapeutic correct management, the status of the patient deteriorated very fast, confirming the aggressiveness of this neoplasia.
In 23 cases of carcinoma of the head and neck, the combined use of Somatostatin and/or its analogue Octreotide, prolactin inhibitors, Melatonin, Retinoids, Vitamin E, Vitamin D3, Vitamin C, Calcium, chondroitin-sulphate, and minimal oral doses of cyclophosphamide (50-100 mg/day) led to a decided increase in survival with respect to the median values reported in the literature for the same tumours and stages, together with an evident improvement in the quality of life, partial or complete objective responses and, in some cases, complete and stable cure with functional recovery. The rationale and the mechanisms of molecular biology of the treatment are discussed, showing that the treatment has a differentiating, apoptotic, antiproliferative, antiangiogenic and antimetastatic effect, and, unlike chemo- and/or radiotherapy, preserves and enhances the trophism and functionality of organs, tissues and immunitary and antitumoral homeostasis. This result, achieved without toxicity, demonstrates the efficacy of this biological multitherapy (Prof. Luigi Di Bella's method or DBM) and is in agreement with the positive results already published on the use of the DBM in various neoplastic diseases. We believe it is of use to report these cases to invite greater interest in the possibilities opened up by this biological multitherapy.
The targeting of tumor cells by peptides for drug delivery is a promising strategy for cancer therapy. Interleukin-2 (IL-2), which mediates anti-tumor cellular immune responses, has been approved as a therapy for cancer. However, the serious side effects and short half-life of recombinant IL-2 (rIL-2) has limited its use clinically. Somatostatin receptors (SSTRs), which are expressed in a large number of human tumors, are the targets for in vivo tumor targeting. In this study, we have constructed and expressed a novel chimeric recombinant protein containing octreotide analogs and IL-2 in order to target the SSTR binding with tumor cells. The fusion protein somatostatin receptor targeted interleukin-2 (SIL), which was purified from bacterial inclusion bodies and refolded with high purity, was analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. Tryptophan emission fluorescence was used to measure the structural changes in SIL after renaturation. Cell proliferation experiments showed that this chimeric protein retained the biological activities of hIL-2. Furthermore, the tumor binding capacity of SIL acting through SSTRs was shown through co-immunoprecipitation. Competition binding with octreotide of tumor cells also confirmed that SIL binds to tumor cells through the target peptide octreotide. Moreover, the performance of SIL in stimulating the proliferation of lymphocyte cell lines after binding to tumor cells showed that the immunocytokine, SIL, retained its bioactivity at the tumor site. These results suggest that SIL is a recombinant fusion protein that may be used for tumor-targeted drug delivery.
Herpesvirus saimiri (HVS) is a gamma herpesvirus with several properties that make it an amenable gene therapy vector; namely its large packaging capacity, its ability to persist as a nonintegrated episome, and its ability to infect numerous human cell types. We used RecA-mediated recombination to develop an HVS vector with a mutated virion protein. The heparan sulphate-binding region of HVS ORF51 was substituted for a peptide sequence which interacts with somatostatin receptors (SSTRs), overexpressed on hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells. HVS mORF51 showed reduced infectivity in non-HCC human cell lines compared to wild-type virus. Strikingly, HVS mORF51 retained its ability to infect HCC cell lines efficiently. However, neutralisation assays suggest that HVS mORF51 has no enhanced binding to SSTRs. Therefore, mutation of the ORF51 glycoprotein has specifically targeted HVS to HCC cell lines by reducing the infectivity of other cell types; however, the mechanism for this targeting is unknown.
This experiment was conducted to examine the effect of dietary copper supplementation on somatostatin (SS) and growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH) mRNA expression levels in the hypothalami of growing pigs. A total of 45 crossbred pigs were randomly assigned to three groups of 15 pigs each; five replicates of three animals comprised each group. Pigs were allocated to diets that contained 5 mg/kg copper (control), 125 mg/kg copper sulfate, or 125 mg/kg copper methionine. At the end of the experiment, five pigs were selected at random from each group and slaughtered, and hypothalami were collected for determination of SS and GHRH mRNA expression levels. The results showed that the SS expression levels were lower and the GHRH levels were higher in pigs fed the diets with 125 mg/kg copper methionine (P&lt;0.05) and 125 mg/kg copper sulfate (P&lt;0.05), respectively, than in pigs fed the diet with 5 mg/kg copper. Furthermore, the relationship between SS mRNA and GHRH mRNA abundance had a significantly negative correlation (P&lt;0.05). The data indicated that high dietary copper could enhance GHRH mRNA expression levels and suppress SS mRNA expression levels in the hypothalami of pigs. High lever dietary copper (125 mg/kg copper sulfate or 125 mg/kg copper methionine) increased pigs' growth performance and feed efficiency but had no significant effect on daily feed intake; 125 mg/kg copper sulfate or 125 mg/kg copper methionine at the same lever had no difference on growth promoting in pigs.
Gastrin is secreted from a subset of neuroendocrine cells residing in the gastric antrum known as G cells, but low levels are also expressed in fetal pancreas and intestine and in many solid malignancies. Although past studies have suggested that antral gastrin is transcriptionally regulated by inflammation, gastric pH, somatostatin, and neoplastic transformation, the transcriptional regulation of gastrin has not previously been demonstrated in vivo. Here, we describe the creation of an enhanced green fluorescent protein reporter (mGAS-EGFP) mouse using a bacterial artificial chromosome that contains the entire mouse gastrin gene. Three founder lines expressed GFP signals in the gastric antrum and the transitional zone to the corpus. In addition, GFP(+) cells could be detected in the fetal pancreatic islets and small intestinal villi, but not in these organs of the adult mice. The administration of acid-suppressive reagents such as proton pump inhibitor omeprazole and gastrin/CCK-2 receptor antagonist YF476 significantly increased GFP signal intensity and GFP(+) cell numbers in the antrum, whereas these parameters were decreased by overnight fasting, octreotide (long-lasting somatostatin ortholog) infusion, and Helicobacter felis infection. GFP(+) cells were also detected in the anterior lobe of the pituitary gland and importantly in the colonic tumor cells induced by administration with azoxymethane and dextran sulfate sodium salt. This transgenic mouse provides a useful tool to study the regulation of mouse gastrin gene in vivo, thus contributing to our understanding of the mechanisms involved in transcriptional control of the gastrin gene.
Octreotide is believed to be the ligand of somatostatin receptors (SSTRs) which are widely used in tumor diagnosis and clinical therapy. In the present work, a new targeting conjugate, octreotide-polyethylene glycol-phosphatidylethanolamine (Oct-PEG-PE), was developed for the assembling of liposome, and the effect of octreotide-modification on the enhancement of the delivery and targeting of doxorubicin-loaded liposomes was investigated in vitro and in vivo. Oct-PEG-PE was synthesized by a three-step reaction involving two derivative intermediate formations of bis (p-nitrophenyl carbonate)-PEG ((pNP)(2)-PEG) and pNP-PEG-PE. The Oct-modified and unmodified liposomes (DOX-OL and DOX-CL) were prepared by the ammonium sulfate gradient method. Both drug uptake assay and cell apoptosis assay suggested that DOX-OL noticeably increased the uptake of DOX in SMMC-7721 cells and showed a more significant cytotoxicity, compared with DOX-CL. The effect of DOX-OL was remarkably inhibited by free octreotide. In contrast, no significant difference in drug cytotoxicity was found between DOX-OL and DOX-CL in CHO cells without obvious expression of SSTRs. The study of ex vivo fluorescence tissues imaging of BALB/c mice and in vivo tissue distribution of B16 tumor-bearing mice indicated that DOX-OL caused remarkable accumulation of DOX in melanoma tumors and the pancreas, in which the SSTRs are highly expressed.
A limited set of novel octreotide dicarba-analogues with non-native aromatic side chains in positions 7 and/or 10 were synthesized. Their affinity toward the ssts1-5 was determined. Derivative 4 exhibited a pan-somatostatin activity, except sst4, and derivative 8 exhibited high affinity and selectivity toward sst5. Actually, compound 8 has similar sst5 affinity (IC50 4.9 nM) to SRIF-28 and octreotide. Structure-activity relationships suggest that the Z geometry of the double-bond bridge is that preferred by the receptors. The NMR study on the conformations of these compounds in SDS(-d25) micelles solution shows that all these analogues have the pharmacophore beta-turn spanning Xaa7-D-Trp8-Lys9-Yaa10 residues. Notably, the correlation between conformation families and affinity data strongly indicates that the sst5 selectivity is favored by a helical conformation involving the C-terminus triad, while a pan-SRIF mimic activity is based mainly on a conformational equilibrium between extended and folded conformational states.
Is there any difference at the serum metabolic level between women with recurrent implantation failure (RIF) and women with recurrent implantation success (RIS) when undergoing in vitro fertilization (IVF)?
Eight metabolites, including valine, adipic acid, l-lysine, creatine, ornithine, glycerol, d-glucose and urea, were found to be significantly up-regulated in women with RIF when compared with women with RIS.
Despite transfer of three high-grade embryos per cycle, RIF following three or more consecutive IVF attempts occurs in a group of infertile women. Conversely, there is a group of women who undergo successful implantation each cycle, yet have a poor obstetric history.
This study was conducted over a period of 10 years (January 2004-October 2014). Groups of 28 women with RIF (age ≤40 years and BMI ≤28) and 24 women with RIS (age and BMI matched) were selected from couples with primary infertility reporting at the Institute of Reproductive Medicine, Kolkata, India. Women recruited in the RIF group had history of implantation failure in at least three consecutive IVF attempts, in which three embryos of high-grade quality were transferred in each cycle.
Blood samples were collected from both the groups during the implantation window following overnight fasting for at least 10 h (7-10 days post ovulation). Samples were analyzed using a 700 MHz NMR spectrometer and acquired spectra were subjected to chemometric and statistical analysis. Serum levels of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) were measured using an enzyme immunoassay technique.
Valine, adipic acid, l-lysine, creatine, ornithine, glycerol, d-glucose and urea were found to be significantly down-regulated in women with RIS when compared with those with RIF, with fold change values of 0.81, 0.82, 0.79, 0.80, 0.78, 0.68, 0.76 and 0.74, respectively. Further, serum eNOS was found to be significantly lower in women with RIF when compared with RIS (P &lt; 0.05), indicating possible impairment in nitric oxide production. Metabolites, mostly related to energy metabolism, lipid metabolism and the arginine metabolic pathway were found to be considerably altered and are likely to be associated with the RIF phenomenon. However, the interplay between these molecules in RIF is complex and holds merit for further exploration.
In-depth studies of the arginine metabolic pathway in endometrial tissues seem necessary to validate our findings. A limitation of the present study is that the metabolic level changes, eNOS and nitric oxide levels have not been investigated in the endometrial tissues of the two groups of women. It would be interesting to investigate whether there exists a direct link between metabolic dysregulation and genetic factors that affects implantation in RIF women.
We speculate that tissue metabolomics can provide an improved understanding of the metabolic dysfunction associated with RIF. The identification of serum metabolic marker(s) in women with RIS may help with strategies of early therapeutic intervention, which may improve the chances of implantation significantly in women otherwise susceptible to IVF failure.

In common with many addictive substances and behaviors nicotine activates the mesolimbic dopaminergic system. Brain microdialysis studies in rodents have consistently shown increases in extrasynaptic DA levels in the striatum after administration of nicotine but PET experiments in primates have given contradicting results. A recent PET study assessing the effect of smoking in humans showed no change in [(11)C]raclopride binding in the brain, but did find that "hedonia" correlated with a reduction in [(11)C]raclopride binding suggesting that DA may mediate the positive reinforcing effects of nicotine. In this experiment we measured the effect of nicotine, administered via a nasal spray, on DA release using [(11)C]raclopride PET, in 10 regular smokers. There was no overall change in [(11)C]raclopride binding after nicotine administration in any of the striatal regions examined. However, the individual change in [(11)C]raclopride binding correlated with change in subjective measures of "amused" and "happiness" in the associative striatum (AST) and sensorimotor striatum (SMST). Nicotine concentration correlated negatively with change in BP in the limbic striatum. Nicotine had significant effects on cardiovascular measures including pulse rate, systolic blood pressure (BPr), and diastolic BPr. Baseline [(11)C]raclopride binding potential (BP) in the AST correlated negatively with the Fagerström score, an index of nicotine dependence. These results support a role for the DA system in nicotine addiction, but reveal a more complex relationship than suggested by studies in animals.
Mouse-Chinese hamster hybrids segregating mouse chromosomes were analyzed by Southern hybridization techniques to map the genes for somatostatin (Smst), glucagon (Gcg), calcitonin (Calc), and parathyroid hormone (Pth). The mouse gene for somatostatin, detected on a 20-kb EcoRI fragment, is located on mouse chromosome 16. Glucagon cDNA hybridized to a 14-kb EcoRI fragment residing on chromosome 2. Calcitonin and parathyroid hormone genes, detected on 7.8-kb HindIII and 6.0-kb BamHI fragments, respectively, were on mouse chromosome 7. The calcitonin and parathyroid hormone genes appear to be part of a larger linkage group which has been conserved in mouse and man.
Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) is a widely used medical imaging modality for diagnosis and monitoring of cerebral stroke. The identification of exact location of stroke lesion helps in perceiving its characteristics, an essential part of diagnosis and treatment planning. This task is challenging due to the typical shape of the stroke lesion. This paper proposes an efficient method for computer-aided delineation of stroke lesions from DWI images.
Proposed methodology comprises of three steps. At the initial step, image contrast has been improved by applying fuzzy intensifier leading to the better visual quality of the stroke lesion. In the following step, a two-class (stroke lesion area vs. non-stroke lesion area) segmentation technique based on Gaussian mixture model has been designed for the localization of stroke lesion. To eliminate the artifacts which would appear during segmentation process, a binary morphological post-processing through area operator has been defined for exact delineation of the lesion area.
The performance of the proposed methodology has been compared with the manually delineated images (ground truth) obtained from different experts, individually. Quantitative evaluation with respect to various performance measures (such as dice coefficient, Jaccard score, and correlation coefficient) shows the efficient performance of the proposed technique.
Somatostatin (SST) mediates cytostatic and pro-apoptotic effects through five somatostatin receptors (SSTR1-5). The modest clinical benefits of SST analogs in cancers of different origin such as breast cancer are attributed to diminished SSTRs expression at tumor sites. In the present study, SSTR3 was overexpressed in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231, and analyzed for downstream signaling molecules associated with cytostatic and cytotoxic effect. Cells overexpressing SSTR3 displayed inhibition of EGF induced proliferation and enhanced antiproliferative effect of SSTR3-specific agonist in comparison to non-transfected cells. SSTR3 overexpression in MCF-7 cells (R3-MCF-7) constitutively enhanced TUNEL staining, PARP-1 and p27(Kip1) expression suggesting apoptosis and cell-cycle arrest. Conversely, R3-MB-231 cells with SSTR3 overexpression exerted cytostatic and were devoid of any cytotoxic effects. The expression of PTP-1C and the status of ERK1/2, p38 and PI3K phosphorylation was modulated in a cell-specific manner. These findings provide new insights in understanding the antiproliferative role of SSTR3 in breast tumor biology.
Somatostatin (SST) analogs are mainstay for controlling tumor proliferation and hormone secretion in carcinoid patients. Recent data suggest that extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) phosphorylation may potentiate the anti-tumor effects of SST analogs in carcinoids. Additionally, ERK1/2 phosphorylating agents have been shown to suppress biomarker expression in carcinoids. Thus, Raf-1/MEK/ERK1/2 pathway activating drugs may be synergistic with SST analogs such as pasireotide (SOM230), which may be more effective than others in its class given its elevated receptor affinity and broader binding spectrum. Here, we investigate the effects of SOM230 in combination with teriflunomide (TFN), a Raf-1 activator, in a human carcinoid cell line.
Human pancreatic carcinoid cells (BON) were incubated in TFN, SOM230 or a combination. Cell proliferation was measured using a rapid colorimetric assay. Western analysis was performed to analyze expression levels of achaete-scute complex-like 1 (ASCL1), chromogranin A (CgA), phosphorylated and total ERK1/2, and markers for apoptosis.
Combination treatment with SOM230 and TFN reduced cell growth beyond the additive effect of either drug alone. Combination indices (CI) fell below 1, thus quantifiably verifying synergy between both drugs as per the Chou-Talalay CI scale. Combined treatment also reduced ASCL1 and CgA expression beyond the additive effect of either drug alone. Furthermore, it increased levels of phosphorylated ERK1/2, cleaved poly(ADP)-ribose polymerase and caspase-3, and reduced levels of anti-apoptotic biomarkers. Elevated phosphorylated ERK1/2 expression following combination therapy may underlie the synergistic interaction between the two drugs.
Since efficacy is achieved at lower doses, combination therapy may palliate symptoms at low toxicity levels. Because each drug has already been evaluated in clinical trials, combinatorial drug trials are warranted.
Using the functionally differentiated colonic cell line, HT29-19A, we have examined sites at which inhibitory G-proteins mediate the antisecretory actions of somatostatin (SST) and the alpha 2-adrenergic agonist, clonidine (CLON) at the epithelial level. Both agents caused a dose-dependent inhibition (EC50:SST 35 nM; CLON 225 nM) of Cl- secretion (assessed by changes in short circuit current) activated by cAMP-mediated agonists, PGE2 and cholera toxin. Inhibition was accompanied by a reduction in intracellular cAMP accumulation and could be blocked by pretreatment with pertussis toxin at a concentration (200 ng/ml) which activated ADP-ribosylation of a 41-kD inhibitory G protein in HT29-19A membranes. Secretion stimulated by the permeant cAMP analogue, dibutyryl cAMP, was also inhibited by SST and CLON (30-50%; P &lt; 0.005), indicating additional inhibitory sites located distal to cAMP production. Both agents were effective inhibitors of secretion mediated through the Ca2+ signaling pathway. SST (1 microM) and CLON (10 microM) reduced the Isc response to the muscarinic agonist, carbachol, by 60-70%; inhibition was reversed in pertussis toxin-treated cells. These effects did not, however, involve inhibition of the carbachol-induced increase in cellular inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate levels or the rise in cytosolic calcium, [Ca]i. Inhibition by SST of secretion induced by phorbol 12,13 dibutyrate but not by the calcium agonist, thapsigargin, suggests that SST may act at a distal inhibitory site in the Ca(2+)-dependent secretory process activated by protein kinase C. We conclude that SST and alpha 2-adrenergic agonists can act directly on intestinal epithelial cells to exert a comprehensive inhibition of Cl- secretion mediated through both cAMP and Ca2+/protein kinase C signaling pathways. Inhibition is mediated via pertussis toxin-sensitive G-proteins at sites located both proximal and distal to the production of second messengers.
The possible effect of cholera toxin (CTX) on hormonal inhibition of adenylyl cyclase in somatostatin (SST)-sensitive GH3 cells was quantitatively evaluated. The toxin treatment employed led to an essentially complete ADP ribosylation of all alpha s subunits of the stimulatory regulatory component (Gs) of the system and to ca. 5- to 7-fold increases in the activity measured, yet it failed to affect the inhibitory action of SST regardless of whether analyzed in terms of degree of inhibition (ca. 60%) that is attainable or in terms of the apparent Kact with which the inhibitory hormone elicits its action. In absolute terms the activity inhibited after CTX was ca. 6 times larger than that inhibited under control conditions, indicating that SST is equally effective in regulating control and CTX-stimulated adenylyl cyclase system and that interpretations are independent of possible intramembraneous compartmentalizations of adenylyl cyclase and its various regulatory components. Since CTX-mediated ADP ribosylation of the alpha-subunits of Gs has been demonstrated to result in an at least 10-fold decrease in the potency (i.e. EC50) with which the beta gamma-complexes of G proteins act to stabilize preactivated purified alpha-subunits of Gs and in an approximately 300-fold decrease in the potency with which exogenously added beta gamma-complexes act to prevent activation of Gs in intact membranes, the present data indicate that beta gamma-complexes cannot be mediating the inhibitory effects of hormones by interfering with activation of the Gs of adenylyl cyclase.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
Observing serum IgG concentration on the distribution of serum, blood cells, and separation gel after centrifugation in different separation gel vacuum tubes.
3 mL venous blood was collected in each of two separation gel procoagulant vacuum tubes: BD Vacutainer SST II(3.5ml, 75×13 mm) and BD Vacutainer SST(5ml, 100×13 mm). After complete solidifaction, both tubes were centrifuged at 2000g for 10 minutes. The distribution of serum, blood cells, and separation gel in the vacuum tube was observed. The immunoglobulin concentration was detected using the special protein analyzer Siemens BNII.
1. In the group of BD Vacutainer SST II where the IgG concentration exceeded 50g/L but less than 122g/L: The serum was located below the separation gel and was distributed in three layers: separation gel, serum, and blood cells. 2. In the group of BD Vacutainer SST where the IgG concentration exceeded 50g/L but less than 122g/L: The serum was located above the separating gel, and was distributed in three layers: serum, separation gel, and blood cells. 3. Increases in IgA and IgM serum concentration did not cause the separation gel inversion.
Increases in serum IgG were positively correlated with the concentration of total protein. The rising of serum IgG caused the floating of separation gel after centrifugation. The BD Vacutainer SST was more suitable for clinical blood sample collection.
Study intestine microflora in children with obesity and evaluate its association with allergic diseases. MATERIALS AND METHODS. 66 children with various body weight aged 3 to 17 years were included into the study. Intestine microflora study in children was carried out according to the order of the Ministry of Health of Russian Federation No. 231 of 09.06.2003 "Regarding approval of sectoral standard "Patient management protocol. Intestine dysbacteriosis" (SST 91500.11.0004-2003).
In healthy children depending on body weight an increase of the number of Firmicutes type microorganisms and a decrease of the number of microbes, belonging to Bacteroidetes type, was detected. The presence of allergic pathology was accompanied by a decrease of the number of Bacteroidetes and the presence of Bacillus and Staphylococcus aureus regardless of the body weight. At the same time, in all the children an increase of the content of Clostridium with the increase of body mass was noted. CONCLUSION. The data obtained have revealed an association of changes in intestine microbiota with the development of obesity and allergopathology.
Varicella, an acute viral systemic infection that may cause lifelong latent infection with the potential for causing clinical reactivation, may be prevented by immunization. The present study was an open label, randomized, controlled, phase III, multicentre trial, conducted to evaluate and compare the safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of a freeze dried live attenuated Oka strain Varicella Vaccine (VR 795 Oka strain) with Varilrix (Oka-RIT strain) in children. A total of 268 healthy Indian children aged 12 months to 12 y with baseline VZV IgG antibody (&lt;100 mIU/ mL) were enrolled, and 256 children completed the study. The extent of rise of VZV IgG antibody titer assessed as 3-fold and 4-fold rise from baseline was found to be significantly higher (89.1% and 85.2%) in the test group as compared to control group (73.4% and 61.7%). The post-vaccination GMT of the test group was significantly higher (112.5 mIU/mL) as compared with the control group (67.8 mIU/mL) (P &lt; 0.001). The seroconversion rate considering the 5 gp ELISA units/ml equivalent to 10mIU/ml were similar in the control (96.5%) and the test (98.3%) groups. The adverse events were not different in the control and test groups (P &gt; 0.05). The test live attenuated vaccine was found to be highly immunogenic, safe and comparable to Varilrix used in control arm.
Malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) is an aggressive neoplasm arising from mesothelial lining of pleura. CD26 molecules preferentially expressed on epithelioid type of MPM. This study investigates the molecular mechanisms of CD26 regulating MPM cells in vitro and in vivo.
Biochemical and cell biological approaches were used for identifying a novel molecular target of MPM. Its contribution to tumour expansion has been also assessed using animal models. The clinical samples of MPM were also assessed for its expression.
We identify that cytostatic effects in MPM are mediated by somatostatin (SST) receptor 4 (SSTR4), being inhibited by the interaction of CD26 molecules. We also indicates that SSTR4-mediated cytostatic effects are regulated by SHP-2 PTP, and that this inhibitory effect by SST agonist is enhanced via lipid raft clustering of associated molecules following crosslinking of anti-CD26 antibody. Finally, using an in vivo xenograft model, we demonstrate that the anti-tumour effect of anti-CD26 mAb is enhanced when combined with SSTR4 agonist treatment, and that SSTR4 is highly coexpressed with CD26 on epithelioid or biphasic types of MPM tissues obtained from patients' surgical specimens.
Combination therapy with humanised anti-CD26 mAb and SSTR4 agonist may therefore potentiate anti-tumour effect on MPM.
Serum blood collection tubes with separator gel are widely used by many laboratories for chemistry analyses. We describe a case of a primary blood collection tube filled with blood sample and a floating separator gel.
The blood sample was collected from a 51 years old female in intensive care unit with the diagnosis of pneumonia into a BD Vacutainer SST tube (Becton Dickinson, NJ, USA) containing serum separator gel and conveyed to the core laboratory of Marmara University Hospital within 30 minutes from collection. Sample was immediately centrifuged at room temperature at 1500 × g for 10 minutes.
The analyses revealed a highly increased total protein concentration of 145 g/L (reference interval 64-83 g/L). The nephelometric analyses showed an elevated serum IgG concentration of 108 g/L (reference interval 6.5-16 g/L) and IgG lambda monoclonal band was determined by serum immunofixation electrophoresis.
Limitation of the separator gel tubes in patients with a high plasma density and its possible effects on test results and laboratory costs should be remembered. The clinical diagnosis stated in the information system should also reveal known comorbid conditions besides the apparent admission reason. This information would avoid resampling, additional testing, and communication efforts with the clinicians.
Current diagnostic tests for Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) involve phlebotomy and serologic testing for HCV antibodies (anti-HCV) and RNA, which are not always feasible. Dried blood spots (DBS) present a minimally invasive sampling method and are suitable for sample collection, storage and testing.
To assess the utility of DBS in HCV detection, we evaluated the sensitivity and specificity of DBS for anti-HCV and HCV RNA detection compared to plasma specimens.
This cross-sectional validation study was conducted in the context of an existing prospective study of HCV in young injection drug users. Blood samples were collected by venipuncture into serum separator tubes (SST) and via finger stick onto Whatman 903(®) protein-saver cards. Plasma samples and eluates from the DBS were tested for anti-HCV using either a third generation enzyme-linked or chemiluminescent immunoassay (IA), and HCV RNA using discriminatory HCV transcription-mediated amplification assay (dHCV TMA). DBS results were compared to their corresponding plasma sample results.
148 participants were tested for anti-HCV and 132 participants were tested for HCV RNA. For anti-HCV, the sensitivity of DBS was 70%, specificity was 100%, positive predictive value (PPV) was 100%, negative predictive value (NPV) was 76% and Kappa was 0.69. For HCV RNA, the sensitivity of DBS was 90%, specificity was 100%, PPV was 100%, NPV was 94% and Kappa was 0.92.
DBS are sensitive and very specific in detecting anti-HCV and HCV RNA, demonstrate good correlation with plasma results, and have potential to facilitate diagnosis of HCV infection.
The somatostatin receptor 1 (sst1) is widely distributed throughout the body and is also present in neoplastic tissues. However, little is known about its precise tissue distribution, regulation and function, which may in part be due to the lack of specific monoclonal anti-sst1 antibodies.
We have characterized the novel rabbit monoclonal anti-human sst1 antibody UMB-7 using sst1-expressing cells and human pituitary samples. The antibody was then used for immunohistochemical staining of a large panel of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded human tissues.
Western blot analyses of BON-1 cells and human pituitary revealed a broad band migrating at a molecular weight of 45,000-60,000. After enzymatic deglycosylation the size of this band decreased to a molecular weight of 45,000. UMB-7 yielded an efficient immunostaining of distinct cell populations in the human tissue samples with a predominance of plasma membrane staining, which was completely abolished by preadsorption of UMB-7 with its immunizing peptide. The sst1 receptor was detected in anterior pituitary, pancreatic islets, distal tubules, enteric ganglion cells and nerve fibers, chief cells of the gastric mucosa, macrophages and mast cells. In addition, sst1 was observed in pituitary adenomas, gastrointestinal neuroendocrine tumors and pheochromocytoma as well as in pancreatic adenocarcinomas, gastric carcinomas, urinary bladder carcinomas and sarcomas.
UMB-7 may prove of great value in the identification of sst1-expressing tumors during routine histopathological examinations. This may open up new routes for diagnostic and therapeutic intervention.
To investigate cortisol responses to adrenocorticotropic hormone during thyrotoxic (G1) and euthyroid (G2) phases in patients with Graves disease (GD) who were without adrenal autoimmunity.
Fifteen patients with GD, who were thyrotropin receptor antibody positive and 21-hydroxylase antibody negative, were recruited to this prospective pilot study. A modified short Synacthen test (SST) was performed, in which cortisol was measured every 30 minutes for 2 hours during G1 and G2.
The median times to SST were 3 weeks (G1) and 27 weeks (G2) after diagnosis of GD. Integrated stimulated cortisol levels were significantly lower at G1 in comparison with G2: mean ± standard error of the mean for area under the curve was 78,091.6 ± 4,462.1 nmol/L (G1) versus 89,055 ± 4,434 nmol/L at 120 minutes (G2), P = .017; and for delta area under the curve was 36,309.9 ± 3,526 nmol/L (G1) versus 44,041.7 ± 2,147 nmol/L at 120 minutes (G2), P = .039. Mean cortisol levels were significantly lower for G1 versus G2 at 60, 90, and 120 minutes of the SST (P = .001 to .013). The cortisol level was abnormal in 2 patients (13%) at 30 minutes during G1 but in none during G2. There was no correlation of integrated cortisol with free thyroxine or thyrotropin receptor antibody. There was no significant difference in median adrenocorticotropic hormone level (17 versus 20.4 ng/mL at G1 and G2, respectively; P = .14).
Significant attenuation of stimulated cortisol occurs in the early thyrotoxic phase in comparison with the euthyroid phase in patients with GD without adrenal autoimmunity. Clinicians treating patients with GD should have a low threshold for investigating symptoms suggestive of hypoadrenalism at times of "stress."
Among the five somatostatin receptors (sst(1)-sst(5)), the sst(3) receptor displays a distinct pharmacological profile. Like sst(2), the sst(3) receptor efficiently internalizes radiolabeled somatostatin analogs. Unlike sst(2), however, internalized sst(3) receptors are rapidly transferred to lysosomes for degradation. Apart from this, very little is known about the clinical relevance of the sst(3) receptor, which may in part be due to the lack of specific monoclonal sst(3) antibodies.
Here, we have extensively characterized the novel rabbit monoclonal anti-human sst(3) antibody UMB-5 using transfected cells and receptor-expressing tissues. UMB-5 was then subjected to immunohistochemical staining of a series of 190 formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded normal and neoplastic human tissues.
Specificity of UMB-5 was demonstrated by detection of a broad band migrating at a molecular weight of 70,000-85,000 in immunoblots from human pituitary. After enzymatic deglycosylation, the size of this band decreased to a molecular weight of 45,000. Tissue immunostaining was completely abolished by pre-adsorption of UMB-5 with its immunizing peptide. In addition, UMB-5 detected distinct cell populations in human tissues like pancreatic islands, anterior pituitary, adrenal cortex, adrenal medulla, and enteric ganglia, similar to that seen with a rabbit polyclonal antibody generated against a different carboxyl-terminal epitope of the sst(3) receptor. In a comparative immunohistochemical study, UMB-5 yielded predominant plasma membrane staining in the majority of pituitary adenomas, pheochromocytomas, and a subset of neuroendocrine tumors. The sst(3) receptor was also present in many glioblastomas, pancreatic, breast, cervix, and ovarian carcinomas.
The rabbit monoclonal antibody UMB-5 may prove of great value in the identification of sst(3)-expressing tumors during routine histopathological examinations. Given its unique trafficking properties, these tumors may be potential candidates for sst(3)-directed receptor radiotherapy.
The frequent overexpression of somatostatin receptors (sst) in neuroendocrine tumors provides the molecular basis for the diagnostic and therapeutic application of stable somatostatin analogs. Whereas octreotide acts mainly via the sst(2) receptor, the novel pan-somatostatin analog pasireotide exhibits particular high affinity for the sst(5) receptor. To determine whether a patient is a candidate for octreotide or pasireotide therapy, it is important to evaluate the somatostatin receptor status. However, so far highly specific rabbit monoclonal antibodies have been developed for the sst(2) receptor only (clone UMB-1).
Here, we have extensively characterized a novel rabbit monoclonal antibody for the human sst(5) receptor (clone UMB-4). In a comparative immunohistochemical study, the expression of sst(5) and sst(2) receptors was assessed using UMB-4 and UMB-1, respectively.
Western blot experiments unequivocally demonstrated that UMB-4 selectively detected its cognate sst(5) receptor and did not cross-react with other proteins present in crude tissue homogenates. UMB-4 yielded a highly effective immunostaining of distinct cell populations in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded human tissues with a predominance of plasma membrane staining. In the pituitary, sst(5) was present on all growth hormone (GH)- and adrenocorticotropin hormone (ACTH)-producing cells whereas sst(2) was only observed on a subpopulation of GH-positive cells. Consequently, sst(5) was detectable on the majority of GH and ACTH adenomas. In contrast, sst(2) was only seen on GH but not on ACTH adenomas.
The rabbit monoclonal antibodies UMB-4 and UMB-1 will facilitate the assessment of the somatostatin receptor status of human tumors during routine histopathological examinations.
The extracellular loop 2 (ECL2) ectodomain of the G protein-coupled receptor class A is thought to function like an inactivation "lid." We created polyclonal somatostatin receptor ECL2 (anti-SSTR ECL2) antibodies to target this lid and to examine if these antibodies can selectively activate the SSTR.
Western blots and live-cell immunofluorescence microscopy determined anti-SSTR ECL2 antibody receptor binding selectivity. 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium assay (MTS assay) and cell cycle assay (fluorescence-activated cell sorting) checked for antibody effect on antiproliferation. Nexin assay examined the antibody's ability to induce apoptosis. LANCE cAMP kit (Perkin Elmer) detected antibody-dependent cAMP decrease. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay measured antibody effect on suppressing serotonin secretion. Ligand-receptor binding interference assay with the fluorescent somatostatin (FAM-SST) was used to examine antibody interference to SST-SSTR binding.
Anti-SSTR ECL2 antibodies are SSTR subtype selective and agonist-like, and they suppress cell proliferation via cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. In addition, these antibodies decrease cAMP production and inhibit serotonin secretion. Interestingly, these antibodies do not interfere with SST-SSTR binding.
The ECL2 is an important ectodomain for G protein-coupled receptor activation and required for ligand binding selectivity. The anti-SSTR2, anti-SSTR3, and anti-SSTR5 ECL2 antibodies independently inhibited BON proliferation and decreased hormone secretion. Unlike octreotide, our antibodies do not interfere with SST-SSTR binding.
Staphylococcus aureus is an important pathogen that is responsible for a wide range of infections, including bovine mastitis. Previously, 54 genes from S. aureus that were up-regulated in an iron-restricted medium and in mice were identified. Seven of those genes were selected from five iron-acquisition systems (isd, feo, sir, sst, and fhu), and the proteins were evaluated as potential vaccine targets to prevent bovine mastitis. The antigenicity of the recombinant proteins obtained with each studied gene was evaluated in rabbits and/or cattle. Immune sera were used to test the bacterial accessibility of the native proteins. All the proteins were immunogenic in rabbits or cattle. IsdH, IsdB, FeoB and SstD were expressed on the bacterial surface, with IsdB and IsdH more expressed in an iron-restricted environment. The capacity of antibodies to prevent infection was measured in a mouse mastitis model. Preincubation of S. aureus with serum against IsdH or with the pool of sera against IsdB, SstD and FeoB led to decreased colonization of the mouse mammary glands. Lastly, cattle immunization with IsdH induced a strong and long-lasting immune response with IgG2 production. The protein IsdH appears to be a good vaccine candidate to prevent S. aureus bovine mastitis.
Pasireotide (SOM230) is currently under clinical evaluation as a successor compound to octreotide for the treatment of acromegaly, Cushing's disease, and carcinoid tumors. Whereas octreotide acts primarily via the sst(2A) somatostatin receptor, pasireotide was designed to exhibit octreotide-like sst(2A) activity combined with enhanced binding to other somatostatin receptor subtypes. In the present study, we used phophosite-specific antibodies to examine agonist-induced phosphorylation of the rat sst(2A) receptor. We show that somatostatin and octreotide stimulate the complete phosphorylation of a cluster of four threonine residues within the cytoplasmic (353)TTETQRT(359) motif in a variety of cultured cell lines in vitro as well as in intact animals in vivo. This phosphorylation was mediated by G protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRK) 2 and 3 and followed by rapid cointernalization of the receptor and ss-arrestin into the same endocytic vesicles. In contrast, pasireotide failed to promote substantial phosphorylation and internalization of the rat sst(2A) receptor. In the presence of octreotide or SS-14, SOM230 showed partial agonist behavior, inhibiting phosphorylation, and internalization of sst(2A). Upon overexpression of GRK2 or GRK3, pasireotide stimulated selective phosphorylation of Thr356 and Thr359 but not of Thr353 or Thr354 within the (353)TTETQRT(359) motif. Pasireotide-mediated phosphorylation led to the formation of relatively unstable beta-arrestin-sst(2A) complexes that dissociated at or near the plasma membrane. Thus, octreotide and pasireotide are equally active in inducing classical G protein-dependent signaling via the sst(2A) somatostatin receptor. Yet, we find that they promote strikingly different patterns of sst(2A) receptor phosphorylation and, hence, stimulate functionally distinct pools of beta-arrestin.
Effects of a Kampo (Japanese herbal) medicine "shoseiryuto (SST, xiao-qing-long-tang in Chinese)", which has been used for the treatment of allergic bronchial asthma clinically, were examined on ovalbumin (OVA)-sensitized allergic airway inflammation model (i.e., bronchial asthma) in a mouse. When SST was orally administered at 0.5 g kg(-1) day(-1) from day 1 to 6 after OVA inhalation, SST reduced the inflammation in lung tissue, the number of eosinophils and the OVA-specific immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibody titer in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluids at 7 days after the OVA inhalation. SST also reduced the airway hyperreactivity at 6 days after the OVA inhalation. Proteomic analysis with the agarose two-dimensional electrophoresis showed that the expression of spectrin α2 was reduced in the lung tissue of OVA-sensitized mice and SST recovered the expression. Western blot and immunohistochemical analyses of lung tissue also confirmed this result. When prednisolone was orally administered at 3 mg kg(-1) day(-1) from day 1 to 6 after OVA inhalation, the inflammation in lung tissue, the number of eosinophils in BAL fluids and airway hyperreactivity were reduced in the OVA-sensitized mice. However, prednisolone did not reduce the OVA-specific IgE antibody titer in BAL fluids and did not recover the expression of spectrin α2 in lung tissue. These results suggest that at least a part of action mechanism of SST against OVA-sensitized allergic airway inflammation in a mouse model is different from that of prednisolone.
Somatostatin (SST) is a multifunctional peptide and involves in several neurodegenerative diseases. N-Methyl-D-asparate (NMDA) receptor agonist quinolinic acid (QUIN)-induced neurotoxicity mimics an experimental model of Huntington's disease that is characterized by the selective preservation of medium-sized aspiny interneurons and degeneration of medium-sized spiny projection neurons in striatum. In QUIN- and NMDA-induced neurotoxicity, increased expression of SST and messenger RNA levels along with SST release in culture medium is generally observed. However, the molecular mechanisms and the functional consequences of increased SST are still obscure. In the present study, the role of SST was determined using immunoneutralization and immunoblockade of SST in cultured striatal neurons upon QUIN- and NMDA-induced neurotoxicity. The immunoblockade of SST with antisense oligonucleotides and immunoabsorption of released SST with specific antibodies potentiate QUIN- and NMDA-induced neuronal cell death. NADPH-diaphorase positive neurons that are selectively spared in several processes of neurodegeneration result in severe damage upon immunoblockade or immunoabsorption of SST. In addition, exogenous SST along with QUIN and NMDA provides selective preservation of projection neurons, which are selectively susceptible in excitotoxicity. Neuroprotective effect of SST is completely blocked by pertussis toxins, suggesting the role of somatostatin receptors. Taken together, these results provide first evidence that the presence of SST is a unique feature for the selective sparing of medium sized aspiny interneurons in excitotoxicity.
Liver development is regulated by various extracellular molecules such as cytokines and cell surface proteins. Although several such regulators have been identified, additional molecules are likely to be involved in liver development. To identify such molecules, we employed the signal sequence trap (SST) method to screen cDNAs encoding a secreted or membrane protein from fetal liver and obtained a number of clones. Among them, we found that T cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain 2 (Tim2) was expressed specifically on immature hepatocytes in the fetal liver. Tim2 has been shown to regulate immune responses, but its role in liver development had not been studied. We have examined the possible role of Tim2 in hepatocyte differentiation. At first, we prepared a soluble Tim2 fusion protein consisting of its extracellular domain and the Fc domain of human IgG (Tim2-hFc) and found that it bound to fetal and adult hepatocytes, suggesting that there are Tim2-binding molecules on hepatocytes. Second, Tim2-hFc inhibited the differentiation of hepatocytes in fetal liver primary culture, i.e., the expression of mature hepatic enzymes and accumulation of glycogen were severely reduced. Third, Tim2-hFc also inhibited proliferation of fetal hepatocytes. Fourth, down-regulation of Tim2 expression by small interfering RNA (siRNA) enhanced the expression of liver differentiation marker genes.
It is strongly suggested that Tim2 is involved in the differentiation of fetal hepatocytes.
Somatostatin (SST) is a regulatory peptide that activates G protein-coupled receptors comprised of five members (somatostatin receptors (SSTRs) 1-5). Despite the broad use of SST and its analogs in clinical practice, the spectrum of SST activities has been incompletely defined. Recently, it has been demonstrated that SST can be a chemoattractant for hematopoietic precursor cells. Since hepatic oval cells (HOCs) share common characteristics with hematopoietic stem cells, we hypothesized that SST could act as a chemoattractant for HOCs by stimulating SSTRs. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Western blot assay revealed an increased expression of SST in the 2-acetyl-aminofluorene (2AAF)/partial hepatectomy (PHx) HOC induction model. Immunohistochemical staining showed the expression of SST in 2AAF/PHx-treated rat liver, as compared to normal liver. Proliferation and migration assays demonstrated that the increase of SST was related to migration of HOCs, but not their proliferation. RT-PCR and quantitative real-time PCR showed that SSTR4 was preferentially expressed by HOCs. Western blot assay and immunohistochemical staining confirmed the expression of SSTR4 by HOCs. In addition, pretreatment with anti-SSTR4 antibody cultures resulted in a dramatic reduction of cell migration as compared to that of control. Lastly, SST stimulated the rearrangement of actin filaments in HOCs, while HOCs treated with anti-SSTR4 antibody failed to do so. These results suggest a positive role for SST in the migration of HOCs, and that this effect is mediated through SSTR4.
Specific glycolipids (GLs) from Leishmania (Viannia) braziliensis promastigotes were isolated and purified. A monoclonal antibody directed to carbohydrate epitopes of these GLs was produced. mAb SST-1 recognizes a low molecular weight GL as established by solid-phase radioimmunoassay and HPTLC immunostaining, and does not cross-react with lipophosphoglycan isolated from L. (V.) braziliensis promastigotes. An indirect immunofluorescence study indicated that the antigenic GLs are present at the L. (V.) braziliensis promastigote surface. SST-1 reacted with promastigotes of L. (V.) naiffi and L. (V.) guyanensis, but not with species in the L. Leishmania subgenus i.e. L. (L.) amazonensis, L. (L.) chagasi, or L. (L.) major. All L. (V.) braziliensis serodemes tested were reactive with SST-1. These results indicate that SST-1 recognizes specific GLs expressed by species of the Viannia subgenus, and will be particularly useful for identification of L. (V.) braziliensis.
A small number of immunoassays on several different types of analyzers were recently adversely affected by tube additives in Becton Dickinson (BD) Vacutainer SST, SST II, and Microtainer blood collection tubes. We examined the effect of a commonly used tube surfactant, Silwet L-720, on immunoassays and the mechanism for the interference.
Immunoassays were performed on serum supplemented with Silwet L-720 on the IMMULITE 2500 and AxSYM analyzers. Direct effects of the surfactant on the chemiluminescent detection step of immunoassays and on antibody immobilization on the solid phase were examined.
Increasing the final surfactant concentration from 0 to 400 mg/L in serum significantly increased (approximately 51%) the apparent total triiodothyronine (TT3) concentrations measured on the IMMULITE 2500 but not the AxSYM analyzer. Several other competitive, but not noncompetitive, assays were also significantly affected by the surfactant on the IMMULITE 2500 analyzer. The effect was independent of serum components, and the surfactant had no direct effect on chemiluminescence reactions. The capture antibody, however, was displaced from the solid phase by incubation with solutions containing surfactant under conditions similar to the IMMULITE TT3 assay.
The Silwet L-720 surfactant, which is used to coat the inner surfaces of tubes, appears to account for previously reported immunoassay interference by BD Vacutainer SST blood collection tubes. One of the mechanisms for the interference is the desorption of antibodies from the solid phase by the surfactant. The results identify an important factor in the selection of suitable blood collection tube surfactants and provide an approach for solving similar tube-assay interference problems in the future.
Interleukin-33 (IL-33) plays a protective role in myocardial ischemia and reperfusion (I/R) injury, but the underlying mechanism was not fully elucidated. The present study was designed to investigate whether IL-33 protects against myocardial I/R injury by regulating both P38 mitogen-activated-protein kinase (P38 MAPK), which is involved in one of the downstream signaling pathways of IL-33, and high mobility group box protein 1 (HMGB1), a late pro-inflammatory cytokine. Myocardial I/R injury increased the level of IL-33 and its induced receptor (sST) in myocardial tissue. Compared with the I/R group, the IL-33 group had significantly lower cardiac injury (lower serum creatine kinase (CK), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and cTnI levels and myocardial infarct size), a suppressed inflammatory response in myocardial tissue (lower expression of HMGB1, IL-6, TNF-α and INF-γ) and less myocardial apoptosis (much higher Bcl-2/Bax ratio and lower cleaved caspase-3 expression). Moreover, IL-33 activated the P38 MAPK signaling pathway (up-regulating P-P38 expression) in myocardial tissue, and SB230580 partially attenuated the anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptosis effects of IL-33. These findings indicated that IL-33 protects against myocardial I/R injury by inhibiting inflammatory responses and myocardial apoptosis, which may be associated with the HMGB1 and P38 MAPK signaling pathways.
Dysfunction of the epithelial barrier is an important pathogenic factor of inflammatory bowel disease and other inflammatory conditions of the gut. Somatostatin (SST) has been demonstrated to reduce local and systemic inflammation reactions and maintain the integrity of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). To determine the beneficial effect of SST on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced damage of the tight junction (TJ) and its mechanisms, Caco2 cells pretreated with SST (1nM) or MEK inhibitor U0126 (10μM) were exposed to LPS. LPS significantly reduced the expression of TJ proteins in a dose-dependent way. LPS (100μg/ml) greatly induced Caco2 monolayer barrier dysfunction by decreasing transepithelial resistance and increasing epithelial permeability. Pretreatment with SST effectively improved the barrier dysfunction of Caco2 cells. SST significantly increased the expression of TJ proteins occludin and ZO-1 and inhibited the redistribution of TJ proteins due to LPS stimulation. Furthermore, SST decreased the LPS-induced phosphorylation of ERK1/2, and a selective MEK inhibitor markedly protected the barrier function against LPS disturbance by blocking the activation of the ERK-MAPK pathway in Caco2 cells. Besides, LPS significantly increased the mRNA level of SSTR5, which was partly inhibited by pretreatment with SST. In conclusion, the present study indicates that SST protects the Caco2 monolayer barrier against LPS-induced tight junction breakdown by down-regulating the activation of the ERK-MAPK pathway and suppression the activation of SSTR5.
In the present study, we employed primary bovine culture of granulosa cells (GCs) as a cellular model to study the potential involvement of somatostatin receptor 2 (SSTR2) in ovarian function. The results showed that bovine GCs expressed SST2 receptor and further found that SSTR2 was possibly regulated by follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), as a significant increase in protein level of SSTR2 was observed in FSH-treated GCs. For further analysis, endogenous SSTR2 expression was disrupted using small inhibitory RNA (siRNA) and the efficacy of differential silencing of endogenous SSTR2 expression was measured both at transcriptional and translational levels. Transient blockage of SSTR2 evidenced its constitutive action on GCs, as it significantly increased level of cAMP (2.4-folds) and basal progesterone production (∼2-fold, P&lt;0.05) with significant increase (P&lt;0.05) in mRNA levels of StAR and P450ssc without altering estradiol concentration and aromatase mRNA expression. Furthermore, silencing of SSTR2 reduced GCs apoptosis (52.5%, P&lt;0.05) and increased cell proliferation, which was further corroborated by up-regulation in protein expressions of B-cell leukemia/lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2), inhibition of caspase3 and mRNA level of bcl2-associated-X protein (Bax). These results provide evidence that SSTR2 subtype controls GCs apoptosis, proliferation and hormonal secretions through selective constitutive action, independently of somatostatin (SST). Given the local inhibitory actions of SSTR2 on the gonads, we further found that apoptosis in ssRNAi-2 transfected cells decreased (6.8% vs 1.9%, P&lt;0.05) more strongly on FSH treatment. Apoptotic protein expressions and steroid hormone mRNA levels were correlated with a relative decrease in apoptosis and increase in progesterone production. Our results suggest that SSTR2 may play a crucial role as a local inhibitor of FSH action on GCs apoptosis and steroidogenesis.
Pain relief is the principal action of opioids. Somatostatin (SST), a growth hormone inhibitory peptide is also known to alleviate pain even in cases when opioids fail. Recent studies have shown that mice are prone to sustained pain and devoid of analgesic effect in the absence of somatostatin receptor 4 (SSTR4). In the present study, using brain slices, cultured neurons and HEK-293 cells, we showed that SSTR4 and δ-Opioid receptor (δOR) exist in a heteromeric complex and function in synergistic manner. SSTR4 and δOR co-expressed in cortical/striatal brain regions and spinal cord. Using cultured neuronal cells, we describe the heterogeneous complex formation of SSTR4 and δOR at neuronal cell body and processes. Cotransfected cells display inhibition of cAMP/PKA and co-activation of SSTR4 and δOR oppose receptor trafficking induced by individual receptor activation. Furthermore, downstream signaling pathways either associated with withdrawal or pain relief are modulated synergistically with a predominant role of SSTR4. Inhibition of cAMP/PKA and activation of ERK1/2 are the possible cellular adaptations to prevent withdrawal induced by chronic morphine use. Our results reveal direct intra-membrane interaction between SSTR4 and δOR and provide insights for the molecular mechanism for the anti-nociceptive property of SST in combination with opioids as a potential therapeutic approach to avoid undesirable withdrawal symptoms.
Somatostatin (SST) and SST receptors (SS1R, SS2R, SS3R, SS4R and SS5R) appear to play a significant role in the progression of human prostate cancer (PCa), which is associated with heterogeneity of SSRs expression and specific cell localization as we already demonstrated in the LNCaP cell line, an in vitro model of human androgen-dependent PCa. In this study, PC-3 and DU-145 human castration-resistant PCa cells were found to express all SSRs, while LNCaP expressed all but SS4R. A 48-h treatment with BIM-23244 (SS2R/SS5R) or BIM-23926 (SS1R) SST analogs was more effective in inhibiting cell proliferation, compared to BIM-23120 (SS2R), BIM-23206 (SS5R) and BIM-23704 (SS1R/SS2R). BIM-23926 (SS1R) treatment increased the amount of p21 and decreased phosphorylated (p) ERK1/2. BIM-23244 (SS2R/SS5R) led to p21 increment only in PC-3 cells, and to pERK1/2 reduction in both cell lines. SS1R/SS2R and SS2R/SS5R receptor dimers were natively present on cell membrane and their amount was increased by BIM-23704 (SS1R/SS2R) or BIM-23244 (SS2R/SS5R) treatment, respectively. SS1R, SS2R and SS5R were differently distributed among nuclear, lysosomal and microsomal compartment, according to their different recycling dynamics. These results show that, in PC-3, DU-145 and LNCaP cells, activation of SS1R and SS2R/SS5R leads to relevant antiproliferative effects.
Hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) cation channels are encoded by HCN1-4 gene family and have four subtypes. These channels are activated upon hyperpolarization of membrane potential and conduct an inward, excitatory current Ih in the nervous system. Ih acts as pacemaker current to initiate rhythmic firing, dampen dendritic excitability and regulate presynaptic neurotransmitter release. This review summarizes recent insights into the cellular functions of Ih and associated behavior such as learning and memory, sleep and arousal. HCN channels are excellent targets of various cellular signals to finely regulate neuronal responses to external stimuli. Numerous mechanisms, including transcriptional control, trafficking, as well as channel assembly and modiﬁcation, underlie HCN channel regulation. In the next section, we discuss how the intracellular signals, especially recent findings concerning protein kinases and interacting proteins such as cGKII, Ca(2+)/CaMKII and TRIP8b, regulate function and expression of HCN channels, and subsequently provide an overview of the effects of neurotransmitters on HCN channels and their corresponding intracellular mechanisms. We also discuss the dysregulation of HCN channels in pathological conditions. Finally, insight into future directions in this exciting area of ion channel research is provided.
There is considerable controversy over whether μ-opioid receptor (MOPr) desensitization is homologous or heterologous and over the mechanisms underlying such desensitization. In different cell types MOPr desensitization has been reported to involve receptor phosphorylation by various kinases, including G-protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRKs), second messenger and other kinases as well as perturbation of the MOPr effector pathway by GRK sequestration of G protein βγ subunits or ion channel modulation. Here we report that in brainstem locus coeruleus (LC) neurons prepared from relatively mature rats (5-8 weeks old) rapid MOPr desensitization induced by the high-efficacy opioid peptides methionine enkephalin and DAMGO was homologous and not heterologous to α(2)-adrenoceptors and somatostatin SST(2) receptors. Given that these receptors all couple through G proteins to the same set of G-protein inwardly rectifying (GIRK) channels it is unlikely therefore that in mature neurons MOPr desensitization involves G protein βγ subunit sequestration or ion channel modulation. In contrast, in slices from immature animals (less than postnatal day 20), MOPr desensitization was observed to be heterologous and could be downstream of the receptor. Heterologous MOPr desensitization was not dependent on protein kinase C or c-Jun N-terminal kinase activity, but the change from heterologous to homologous desensitization with age was correlated with a decrease in the expression levels of GRK2 in the LC and other brain regions. The observation that the mechanisms underlying MOPr desensitization change with neuronal development is important when extrapolating to the mature brain results obtained from experiments on expression systems, cell lines and immature neuronal preparations.
Small cohort sizes and modest levels of gene expression changes in brain tissue have plagued the statistical approaches employed in microarray studies investigating the mechanism of schizophrenia. To combat these problems a combined analysis of six prior microarray studies was performed to facilitate the robust statistical analysis of gene expression data from the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex of 107 patients with schizophrenia and 118 healthy subjects. Multivariate permutation tests identified 144 genes that were differentially expressed between schizophrenia and control groups. Seventy of these genes were identified as differentially expressed in at least one component microarray study but none of these individual studies had the power to identify the remaining 74 genes, demonstrating the utility of a combined approach. Gene ontology terms and biological pathways that were significantly enriched for differentially expressed genes were related to neuronal cell-cell signaling, mesenchymal induction, and mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling, which have all previously been associated with the etiopathogenesis of schizophrenia. The differential expression of BAG3, C4B, EGR1, MT1X, NEUROD6, SST and S100A8 was confirmed by real-time quantitative PCR in an independent cohort using postmortem human prefrontal cortex samples. Comparison of gene expression between schizophrenic subjects with and without detectable levels of antipsychotics in their blood suggests that the modulation of MT1X and S100A8 may be the result of drug exposure. In conclusion, this combined analysis has resulted in a statistically robust identification of genes whose dysregulation may contribute to the mechanism of schizophrenia.
Phospholipase C-β (PLC-β) is a key molecule in G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR)-mediated signaling. Many studies have shown that the four PLC-β subtypes have different physiological functions despite their similar structures. Because the PLC-β subtypes possess different PDZ-binding motifs, they have the potential to interact with different PDZ proteins. In this study, we identified PDZ domain-containing 1 (PDZK1) as a PDZ protein that specifically interacts with PLC-β3. To elucidate the functional roles of PDZK1, we next screened for potential interacting proteins of PDZK1 and identified the somatostatin receptors (SSTRs) as another protein that interacts with PDZK1. Through these interactions, PDZK1 assembles as a ternary complex with PLC-β3 and SSTRs. Interestingly, the expression of PDZK1 and PLC-β3, but not PLC-β1, markedly potentiated SST-induced PLC activation. However, disruption of the ternary complex inhibited SST-induced PLC activation, which suggests that PDZK1-mediated complex formation is required for the specific activation of PLC-β3 by SST. Consistent with this observation, the knockdown of PDZK1 or PLC-β3, but not that of PLC-β1, significantly inhibited SST-induced intracellular Ca(2+) mobilization, which further attenuated subsequent ERK1/2 phosphorylation. Taken together, our results strongly suggest that the formation of a complex between SSTRs, PDZK1, and PLC-β3 is essential for the specific activation of PLC-β3 and the subsequent physiologic responses by SST.
Somatostatin and cortistatin have been shown to act directly on pituitary somatotrophs to inhibit growth hormone (GH) release. However, previous results from nonprimate species indicate that these peptides can also directly stimulate GH secretion, at low concentrations. The relevance of this phenomenon in a nonhuman primate model was investigated in the present study by testing the impact of somatostatin/cortistatin on GH release in primary pituitary cell cultures from baboons. High doses (&gt; 10(-10) m) of somatostatin/cortistatin did not alter basal GH secretion but blocked GH-releasing hormone (GHRH)- and ghrelin-induced GH release. However, at low concentrations (10(-17)-10(-13) m), somatostatin/cortistatin dramatically stimulated GH release to levels comparable to those evoked by GHRH or ghrelin. Use of somatostatin receptor (sst) specific agonists/antagonists, and signal transduction blockers indicated that sst2 and sst1 activation via intact adenylate cylcase and mitogen-activated protein kinase systems mediated the inhibitory actions of high-concentration somatostatin. By contrast, the stimulatory actions of low-dose somatostatin on GH release were mediated by sst5 signalling through adenylate cylcase/cAMP/protein kinase A and intracellular Ca(2+) pathways, and were additive with ghrelin (not GHRH). Notably, low-concentrations of somatostatin, similar to sst5-agonists, inhibited prolactin release. These results clearly demonstrate that the ultimate impact of somatostatin/cortistatin on hormone release is dose-dependent, cell type-selective and receptor-specific, where the stimulatory effects of low-concentration somatostatin/cortistatin on GH release extend to primates, thereby supporting the notion that this action is relevant in regulating GH secretion in humans.
Epidermal growth factor (EGF) regulates normal and tumor cell proliferation via epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) phosphorylation, homo- or heterodimerization and activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and PI3K/AKT cell survival pathways. In contrast, SST via activation of five different receptor subtypes inhibits cell proliferation and has been potential target in tumor treatment. To gain further insight for the effect of SSTRs on EGFR activated signaling, we determine the role of SSTR1 and SSTR1/5 in human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells. We here demonstrate that cells transfected with SSTR1 or SSTR1/5 negatively regulates EGF mediated effects attributed to the inhibition of EGFR phosphorylation, MAPKs as well as the cell survival signaling. Furthermore, SSTR effects were significantly enhanced in cells when EGFR was knock down using siRNA or treated with selective antagonist (AG1478). Most importantly, the presence of SSTR in addition to modulating signaling pathways leads to the dissociation of the constitutive and EGF induced heteromeric complex of EGFR/ErbB2. Furthermore, cells cotransfected with SSTR1/5 display pronounced effect of SST on the signaling and dissociation of the EGFR/ErbB2 heteromeric complex than the cells expressing SSTR1 alone. Taken together this study provides the first evidence that the presence of SSTR controls EGF mediated cell survival pathway via dissociation of ErbB heteromeric complex. We propose that the activation of SSTR and blockade of EGFR might serve novel therapeutic approach in inhibition of tumor proliferation.
Somatostatin (SST), an important neuropeptide of the gastrointestinal tract has been shown to stimulate sodium chloride absorption and inhibit chloride secretion in the intestine. However, the effects of SST on luminal butyrate absorption in the human intestine have not been investigated. Earlier studies from our group and others have shown that monocarboxylate transporter (MCT1) plays an important role in the transport of butyrate in the human intestine. The present studies were undertaken to examine the effects of SST on butyrate uptake utilizing postconfluent human intestinal epithelial Caco2 cells. Apical SST treatment of Caco-2 cells for 30-60 min significantly increased butyrate uptake in a dose-dependent manner with maximal increase at 50 nM ( approximately 60%, P &lt; 0.05). SST receptor 2 agonist, seglitide, mimicked the effects of SST on butyrate uptake. SST-mediated stimulation of butyrate uptake involved the p38 MAP kinase-dependent pathway. Kinetic studies demonstrated that SST increased the maximal velocity (V(max)) of the transporter by approximately twofold without any change in apparent Michaelis-Menten constant (K(m)). The higher butyrate uptake in response to SST was associated with an increase in the apical membrane levels of MCT1 protein parallel to a decrease in the intracellular MCT1 pool. MCT1 has been shown to interact specifically with CD147 glycoprotein/chaperone to facilitate proper expression and function of MCT1 at the cell surface. SST significantly enhanced the membrane levels of CD147 as well as its association with MCT1. This association was completely abolished by the specific p38 MAP kinase inhibitor, SB203580. Our findings demonstrate that increased MCT1 association with CD147 at the apical membrane in response to SST is p38 MAP kinase dependent and underlies the stimulatory effects of SST on butyrate uptake.
The role of somatostatin (SST) and epidermal growth factor (EGF) in breast cancer is undisputed; however, the molecular mechanisms underlying their antiproliferative or proliferative effects are not well understood. We initially confirmed that breast tumour tissues express all five somatostatin receptors (SSTR1-5) and four epidermal growth factor receptors (ErbB1-4). Subsequently, to gain insight into the function of SSTRs and ErbBs in oestrogen receptor (ER)-positive (MCF-7) or ERalpha-negative (MDA-MB-231) breast cancer cells, we defined SSTR1, SSTR5 and ErbB1 mRNA and protein expression in these two tumour cell lines. Consistent with previous studies showing SSTR1/SSTR5 heterodimerization and having seen cell-specific and ligand-selective alterations in receptor expression, we next elucidated whether SSTR1 and SSTR5 functionally interact with ErbB1 using pbFRET analysis. We subsequently determined the effects of SST and EGF either alone, or in combination, on selected downstream signalling molecules such as erk1/2, p38 and JNK. Here, we showed that both SST and EGF influenced erk1/2 phosphorylation and that SST modulated the effects of EGF in a cell-specific manner. We also demonstrated agonist-, time and cell-dependent regulation of p38 phosphorylation. We further investigated modulation of Grb2, SOS, Shc, SH-PTP1 and SH-PTP2. ErbB1 adaptor proteins known to play a role in MAPK activation, Shc, Grb2 and SOS, changed in an agonist- and cell-specific manner whereas, SH-PTP1 and SH-PTP2, adaptor proteins reported to interact with SSTRs, translocated from the cytosol to membrane in a cell-specific manner following SST and/or EGF treatment. Although several previous studies have shown crosstalk between RTKs and GPCRs, there are no reports describing SSTR (GPCR) modulation of ErbBs (RTK) in breast cancer. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report describing crosstalk/interactions between SSTRs and ErbBs.
Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) is expressed in colonic neoplasms, where it supports cell proliferation via prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)) production. This study investigated the effects of somatostatin-14 on COX-2 expression, PGE(2) production and proliferation in colon cancer cells.
Human colon adenocarcinoma cell lines Caco-2, HT-29 and HCT116 were used. The following techniques were employed: colourimetric assay for cell growth; 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine assay for DNA synthesis; enzyme immunoassay for PGE(2); COX-2 mRNA silencing; RT-PCR or Western blot for somatostatin receptor subtypes, cyclooxygenase isoforms, phosphorylated-ERK-1/ERK-2 and phosphorylated-Akt.
HT-29 and Caco-2 cells expressed COX-2 and somatostatin receptors (sst(3/4/5) and sst(3/5), respectively). HCT116 cells did express somatostatin receptors (sst(2/3/5)), but not COX-2. Somatostatin-14 inhibited basal COX-2 expression, PGE(2) production, DNA synthesis and growth in Caco-2 cells and these effects were prevented by BN81658 (sst(3) receptor antagonist). Basal proliferation of HT-29, HCT116 and COX-2-silenced Caco-2 cells was not affected by somatostatin-14. Stimulation of HT-29 cells with gastrin-17 elicited increments of ERK-1/ERK-2 and Akt phosphorylation, COX-2 expression, PGE(2) production, DNA synthesis and cell growth, which were all counteracted by somatostatin-14. Somatostatin-14-induced inhibition of COX-2 expression, PGE(2) production and DNA synthesis were blocked by BIM23056 (sst(5) receptor antagonist).
Somatostatin decreases COX-2 expression and function in colon cancer cells via activation of sst(3) or sst(5) receptors, and these effects contribute to the inhibitory action of somatostatin on cell proliferation. These findings can be relevant to the development of therapeutic strategies based on the modulation of the COX-2 pathway.
Anterior pituitary hormone secretion is under tonic suppression by hypothalamic somatostatin signaling through somatostatin receptor subtypes (SSTs). Because some hormonal axes are known to be abnormally regulated by ligand-independent constitutively active G protein-coupled receptors, we tested pituitary SSTs for selective constitutive signaling. We therefore differentially silenced endogenous SST2, SST3, and SST5 in somatostatin-sensitive ACTH-secreting mouse AtT-20 pituitary corticotroph cells using small inhibitory RNA (siRNA) and analyzed downstream SSTs-regulated pathways. Transfection with siRNA reduced specific receptor subtype mRNA expression up to 82%. Specificity of receptor silencing was validated against negative controls with different gene-selective siRNAs, concordance of mRNA and cAMP changes, reduced potency of receptor-selective agonists, and phenotype rescue by overexpression of the silenced receptor. Mouse SST3 &gt; SST5 &gt; SST2 knockdown increased basal cAMP accumulation (up to 200%) and ACTH secretion (up to 60%). SST2- and SST5-selective agonist potencies were reduced by SST3- and SST5-silencing, respectively. SST5 &gt; SST2 = SST3 silencing also increased basal levels of ERK1/2 phosphorylation. SST3- and SST5-knockdown increased cAMP was only partially blocked by pertussis toxin. The results show that SST2, SST3, and SST5 exhibit constitutive activity in mouse pituitary corticotroph cells, restraining adenylate cyclase and MAPK activation and ACTH secretion. SST3 mainly inhibits cAMP accumulation and ACTH secretion, whereas SST5 predominantly suppresses MAPK pathway activation. Therefore, SST receptor subtypes control pituitary cell function not only through somatostatin binding to variably expressed cell membrane receptor subtypes, but also by differential ligand-independent receptor-selective constitutive action.
Famine and viral infection, as well as interferon therapy have been reported to increase the risk of developing bipolar disorder. In addition, almost 100 polymorphic genes have been associated with this disease. Several form most of the components of a phosphatidyl-inositol signalling/AKT1 survival pathway (PIK3C3, PIP5K2A, PLCG1, SYNJ1, IMPA2, AKT1, GSK3B, TCF4) which is activated by growth factors (BDNF, NRG1) and also by NMDA receptors (GRIN1, GRIN2A, GRIN2B). Various other protein products of genes associated with bipolar disorder either bind to or are affected by phosphatidyl-inositol phosphate products of this pathway (ADBRK2, HIP1R, KCNQ2, RGS4, WFS1), are associated with its constituent elements (BCR, DUSP6, FAT, GNAZ) or are downstream targets of this signalling cascade (DPYSL2, DRD3, GAD1, G6PD, GCH1, KCNQ2, NOS3, SLC6A3, SLC6A4, SST, TH, TIMELESS). A further pathway relates to endoplasmic reticulum-stress (HSPA5, XBP1), caused by problems in protein glycosylation (ALG9), growth factor receptor sorting (PIK3C3, HIP1R, SYBL1), or aberrant calcium homoeostasis (WFS1). Key processes relating to these pathways appear to be under circadian control (ARNTL, CLOCK, PER3, TIMELESS). DISC1 can also be linked to many of these pathways. The growth factor pathway promotes protein synthesis, while the endoplasmic reticulum stress pathway, and other stress pathways activated by viruses and cytokines (IL1B, TNF, Interferons), oxidative stress or starvation, all factors associated with bipolar disorder risk, shuts down protein synthesis via control of the EIF2 alpha and beta translation initiation complex. For unknown reasons, oligodendrocytes appear to be particularly prone to defects in the translation initiation complex (EIF2B) and the convergence of these environmental and genomic signalling pathways on this area might well explain their vulnerability in bipolar disorder.
Sugar conjugation of biooactive peptides has been shown to be a powerful tool to modulate peptide pharmacokinetics. In the case of radiolabeled somatostatin analogues developed for in vivo scintigraphy of somatostatin receptor (sst) expressing tumors, it generally led to tracers with predominant renal excretion and low uptake in nontarget organs, and in some cases also with enhanced tumor accumulation. Especially with respect to endoradiotherapeutic applicability of these tracers, however, understanding the structural requirements for minimal kidney accumulation and maximal tumor uptake is important. The aim of this study was therefore the evaluation of the potential of specific glycoside structures in combination with reduced peptide net charge to reduce kidney accumulation without affecting tumor accumulation. Three glyco analogues of radioiodinated Tyr(3)-octreotate (TOCA) with z = 0 were evaluated in a comparative study using [(125)I]Mtr-TOCA (z = +1), the maltotriose-Amadori analogue of [(125)I]TOCA, as a reference, [(125)I]Glucuron-TOCA, the Amadori conjugate with glucuronic acid, and [(125)I]Gluc-S- and [(125)I]Gal-S-TOCA, the coupling products with glucosyl- and mannosyl-mercaptopropionate. In cells transfected with sst(1)-sst(5), all three new analogues show sst-subtype binding profiles similar to I-Mtr-TOCA with high, but somewhat reduced, affinity for sst(2). In contrast, internalization into sst(2)-expressing cells (in % of [(125)I]Tyr(3)-octreotide ([(125)I]TOC)) as well as the EC(50,R) of unlabeled TOC for internalization determined in dual-tracer experiments are substantially enhanced for [(123)I]Gal-S-TOCA and [(123)I]Gluc-S-TOCA (internalization, 190% +/- 12% and 265% +/- 20%, respectively, vs 168% +/- 6% of [(125)I]TOC for [(123)I]Mtr-TOCA; EC(50,R), 2.62 +/- 0.07 and 2.96 +/- 0.14, respectively, vs 1.81 +/- 0.07 for [(123)I]Mtr-TOCA). The tumor accumulation of [(125)I]Gal-S-TOCA and [(125)I]Gluc-S-TOCA in AR42J tumor-bearing nude mice 1 h p.i. is consequently very high (22.6 +/- 2.2 and 26.2 +/- 5.6%ID/g) and comparable to that of [(125)I]Mtr-TOCA (25.1 +/- 4.4%ID/g). [(125)I]Glucuron-TOCA showed lower uptake in sst-expressing tissues than did [(125)I]Mtr-TOCA, but considerably enhanced accumulation in nontarget organs such as liver, intestine, and kidney. Due to increased lipophilicity, hepatic and intestinal uptake 1 and 4 h p.i. of [(125)I]Gal-S-TOCA and [(125)I]Gluc-S-TOCA was also slightly higher than that of [(125)I]Mtr-TOCA. Kidney accumulation, however, was reduced by approximately 50% for both compounds (2.6 +/- 0.3 and 2.2 +/- 0.4, respectively, vs 4.0 +/- 0.7%ID/g at 1 h p.i.). Because no sugar-specific effect was detected in the latter case, it is concluded that general ligand pharmacokinetics and especially kidney accumulation of the tracers investigated are mainly determined by physicochemical characteristics such as lipophilicity, net charge, and also charge distribution ([(125)I]Glucuron-TOCA vs [(125)I]Gal-S- and [(125)I]Gluc-S-TOCA). With respect to receptor targeting, however, the structure of the carbohydrate moiety plays an important role, leading to dramatically enhanced ligand internalization, especially in the case of [(123)I]Gluc-S-TOCA. Taking into account the combined effects of the Gluc-S-moiety both on kidney and on tumor accumulation, this group seems to be a promising synthon for the synthesis of other radiolabeled peptide analogues with improved pharmacokinetics.
Several front-line chemotherapeutics cause mitochondria-derived, oxidative stress-mediated cardiotoxicity. Iron chelators and other antioxidants have not completely succeeded in mitigating this effect. One hindrance to the development of cardioprotectants is the lack of physiologically-relevant animal models to simultaneously study antitumor activity and cardioprotection. Therefore, we optimized a syngeneic rat model and examined the mechanisms by which oxidative stress affects outcome. Immune-competent spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) were implanted with passaged, SHR-derived, breast tumor cell line, SST-2. Tumor growth and cytokine responses (IL-1A, MCP-1, TNF-α) were observed for two weeks post-implantation. To demonstrate the utility of the SHR/SST-2 model for monitoring both anticancer efficacy and cardiotoxicity, we tested cardiotoxic doxorubicin alone and in combination with an established cardioprotectant, dexrazoxane, or a nitroxide conjugated to a triphenylphosphonium cation, Mito-Tempol (4) [Mito-T (4)]. As predicted, tumor reduction and cardiomyopathy were demonstrated by doxorubicin. We confirmed mitochondrial accumulation of Mito-T (4) in tumor and cardiac tissue. Dexrazoxane and Mito-T (4) ameliorated doxorubicin-induced cardiomyopathy without altering the antitumor activity. Both agents increased the pro-survival autophagy marker LC3-II and decreased the apoptosis marker caspase-3 in the heart, independently and in combination with doxorubicin. Histopathology and transmission electron microscopy demonstrated apoptosis, autophagy, and necrosis corresponding to cytotoxicity in the tumor and cardioprotection in the heart. Changes in serum levels of 8-oxo-dG-modified DNA and total protein carbonylation corresponded to cardioprotective activity. Finally, 2D-electrophoresis/mass spectrometry identified specific serum proteins oxidized under cardiotoxic conditions. Our results demonstrate the utility of the SHR/SST-2 model and the potential of mitochondrially-directed agents to mitigate oxidative stress-induced cardiotoxicity. Our findings also emphasize the novel role of specific protein oxidation markers and autophagic mechanisms for cardioprotection.
An Escherichia coli-yeast shuttle vector pOL 221 is described, which consists of pBR 322 and a yeast mitochondrial fragment. The mitochondrial insert in pOL 221 possessed a mitochondrial autonomously replicating sequence (ARS) and a single Sst II site. The ARS function of pOL 221 was demonstrated by insertion of LEU2 gene into pOL 221 (giving pOL 2211) followed by the transformation of leu- yeast cells. By use of this vector, chimeric plasmids pOL 37 and pOL 379 (a derivative of pOL 37 inserted with LEU2 gene), carrying the yeast mitochondrial oli-I gene were constructed. Marked instability was observed on the maintenance of pOL 37 in E. coli under non-selective conditions. pOL 37 can, however, be maintained in E. coli in the presence of tetracycline. pOL 2211, pOL 379 and other pOL plasmids showed mitotic instability in yeast. Transformants of oligomycin sensitive yeast cells with pOL 37 and pOL 379 did not show oligomycin resistance. The absence of recombination between the cloned mitochondrial gene and the host mitochondrial gene is discussed.
Inhibitory circuitry plays an integral role in cortical network activity. The development of transgenic mouse lines targeting unique interneuron classes has significantly advanced our understanding of the functional roles of specific inhibitory circuits in neocortical sensory processing. In contrast, considerably less is known about the circuitry and function of interneuron classes in piriform cortex, a paleocortex responsible for olfactory processing. In this study, we sought to utilize transgenic technology to investigate inhibition mediated by somatostatin (SST) interneurons onto pyramidal cells (PCs), parvalbumin (PV) interneurons, and other interneuron classes. As a first step, we characterized the anatomical distributions and intrinsic properties of SST and PV interneurons in four transgenic lines (SST-cre, GIN, PV-cre, and G42) that are commonly interbred to investigate inhibitory connectivity. Surprisingly, the distributions SST and PV cell subtypes targeted in the GIN and G42 lines were sparse in piriform cortex compared to neocortex. Moreover, two-thirds of interneurons recorded in the SST-cre line had electrophysiological properties similar to fast spiking (FS) interneurons rather than regular (RS) or low threshold spiking (LTS) phenotypes. Nonetheless, like neocortex, we find that SST-cells broadly inhibit a number of unidentified interneuron classes including putatively identified PV cells and surprisingly, other SST cells. We also confirm that SST-cells inhibit pyramidal cell dendrites and thus, influence dendritic integration of afferent and recurrent inputs to the piriform cortex. Altogether, our findings suggest that SST interneurons play an important role in regulating both excitation and the global inhibitory network during olfactory processing.
Mosquito control is essential to protect humans from mosquito-borne diseases. The host recognition between mosquitoes and humans is achieved by the mosquito olfactory system. Antennal sensilla, which house olfactory receptor neurons, are responsible for detecting chemical cues from hosts. To deepen our understanding of the mechanisms involved in the host seeking behavior of mosquitoes, we conducted an electrophysiological study to investigate the response profile of each type of antennal sensilla to human odorants using single sensillum recording. In this study, more than 100 human odorants have been applied as stimuli to 5 morphological types of sensilla, long sharp trichoid (LST), short sharp trichoid (SST), short blunt trichoid I (SBTI), short blunt trichoid II (SBTII), and grooved peg (GP). Different types of sensilla present distinctive response profiles to the human odorants tested. In particular, SST, SBTI, and SBTII sensilla responded to more than 1 category of human odorants, while GP and LST were narrowly tuned to amines and methyl nonanoate, respectively. The dose-dependent patterns and odorant-specific/chemical structure-specific temporal dynamics of SBTI and SBTII antennal sensilla to human odorants had been further detected. Taken together, our study provides the new information on the olfactory physiology of Culex quinquefasciatus (Diptera: Culicidae) to human odorants, leading to a better understanding of mosquito-host recognition and being important for future development of new reagents in the mosquito control.
The relationship between Parkinson's disease (PD) and olfactory dysfunction has been investigated via psychophysical and electrophysiological assessments. Despite the increasing number of electrophysiological studies focusing on olfactory function, there are still some limitations to observe the chemosensory event-related potentials (CSERP), which are electrophysiological responses of the brain to olfactory and trigeminal stimulations, because of the low sensitivity (low signal-to-noise ratio). Recent studies attempted to establish new techniques to increase the sensitivity for evaluating the CSERP and brain responsiveness. We aimed to inspect CSERP via entropy analysis in assessing chemosensory related brain responses that has been used for the first time. Twelve newly diagnosed and non-medicated PD patients and 12 healthy subjects participated in the study. Psychophysical and electrophysiological evaluation of olfaction were assessed via Sniffin' Sticks Test (SST) and entropy analysis on CSERP in three time windows. The scores of odor threshold, odor identification and total scores of SST were lower (hyposmic) in PD patients compared to healthy subjects. Electrophysiological assessments revealed a significant change in entropy among time windows for olfactory stimulation with phenyl ethyl alcohol and trigeminal stimulation with carbon dioxide (both p &lt; 0.05) in healthy subjects but not in PD patients. Entropy findings indicate that the brain operates in ordered state among healthy subjects in response to olfactory/trigeminal stimuli, whereas the PD patients displayed a chaotic pattern. This pattern in the PD patients suggests the lack of proper smell function. It should be studied if this pattern can be used as a biomarker for PD.
General practitioners (GPs) are in best position to suspect dementia. Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Clock Drawing Test (CDT) are widely used. Additional neurological tests may increase the accuracy of diagnosis. We aimed to evaluate diagnostic ability to detect dementia with a Short Smell Test (SST) and Palmo-Mental Reflex (PMR) in patients whose MMSE and CDT are normal, but who show signs of cognitive dysfunction.
This was a 3.5-year cross-sectional observational study in the Memory Clinic of the University Department of Geriatrics in Bern, Switzerland. Participating patients with normal MMSE (&gt;26 points) and CDT (&gt;5 points) were referred by GPs because they suspected dementia. All were examined according to a standardized protocol. Diagnosis of dementia was based on DSM-IV TR criteria. We used SST and PMR to determine if they accurately detected dementia.
In our cohort, 154 patients suspected of dementia had normal MMSE and CDT test results. Of these, 17 (11%) were demented. If SST or PMR were abnormal, sensitivity was 71% (95% CI 44-90%), and specificity 64% (95% CI 55-72%) for detecting dementia. If both tests were abnormal, sensitivity was 24% (95% CI 7-50%), but specificity increased to 93% (95% CI 88-97%).
Patients suspected of dementia, but with normal MMSE and CDT results, may benefit if SST and PMR are added as diagnostic tools. If both SST and PMR are abnormal, this is a red flag to investigate these patients further, even though their negative neuropsychological screening results.
The telencephalic subpallium is the source of various GABAergic interneuron cohorts that invade the pallium via tangential migration. Based on genoarchitectonic studies, the subpallium has been subdivided into four major domains: striatum, pallidum, diagonal area and preoptic area (Puelles et al. 2013; Allen Developing Mouse Brain Atlas), and a larger set of molecularly distinct progenitor areas (Flames et al. 2007). Fate mapping, genetic lineage-tracing studies, and other approaches have suggested that each subpallial subdivision produces specific sorts of inhibitory interneurons, distinguished by differential peptidic content, which are distributed tangentially to pallial and subpallial target territories (e.g., olfactory bulb, isocortex, hippocampus, pallial and subpallial amygdala, striatum, pallidum, septum). In this report, we map descriptively the early differentiation and apparent migratory dispersion of mouse subpallial somatostatin-expressing (Sst) cells from E10.5 onward, comparing their topography with the expression patterns of the genes Dlx5, Gbx2, Lhx7-8, Nkx2.1, Nkx5.1 (Hmx3), and Shh, which variously label parts of the subpallium. Whereas some experimental results suggest that Sst cells are pallidal, our data reveal that many, if not most, telencephalic Sst cells derive from de diagonal area (Dg). Sst-positive cells initially only present at the embryonic Dg selectively populate radially the medial part of the bed nucleus striae terminalis (from paraseptal to amygdaloid regions) and part of the central amygdala; they also invade tangentially the striatum, while eschewing the globus pallidum and the preoptic area, and integrate within most cortical and nuclear pallial areas between E10.5 and E16.5.
Sniffin' Sticks Test (SST) is a complex smell test, enabling the diagnosis of various aspects of olfactory sensitivity. It is one of the most popular tools for olfactory testing all over the world; however, so far it has not been commonly used in Poland.
The presented study had the following aims: assessment of the applicability of the SST in Poland, adaptation of the identification subtest, normalization of the whole battery and comparison of the Polish results to the norms in the original tool.
We tested olfactory sensitivity of 281 healthy volunteers aged 18-87 years. We used the full version of the SST (threshold, discrimination and identification subtests).
The results of the presented study are the modified version of the identification test response questionnaire and clearly defined normative values for the Polish people of different ages. Normative values and results in Poland were not significantly different from the previously reported findings for the original, German tool. Additionally, consistent with previous reports, olfactory sensitivity of the eldest group of the Polish people was lower than performance in younger age groups.
The presented findings suggest that the adapted version of the Sniffin' Sticks Test might be used for both medical and research purposes in Poland.
Olfactory sensitivity can be evaluated by various tests, with "Sniffin' Sticks" test (SST) being one of the most popular. SST consists of tests for odor threshold, discrimination, and identification. It seems relatively straightforward to administer threshold tests in different groups and societies and it has been shown that odor identification tests requires special adaptation before they can be administered to various populations. However, few studies have investigated the application of an odor discrimination task in various regions/cultures. In the present study, we compared the discrimination scores of 169 Polish people with the scores of 99 Tsimane', Bolivian Amerindians. The Tsimane' participants scored very low in the discrimination task, despite their general high olfactory sensitivity. This result suggests that when a discrimination task is chosen as the form of olfactory testing, some additional variables need to be controlled. We suggest three sources of low scores of our participants-their cognitive profile, the cultural background, i.e., little knowledge of the odors used in the discrimination test and problems associated with testing environment.
Multiple chemical sensitivity (MCS) is a relatively common clinical diagnosis in western populations and its symptoms (i.e. dysosmia) are mainly triggered by chemical compounds, such as common odorants. The aim of this study was to test the effect of intranasal administration of hyaluronic acid (HA) on odour threshold and related quality of life in MCS syndrome. Two randomized groups of MCS patients received 30 days administration of either a nasal spray (Ialumar®) containing HA [HA group (HAG); n=29] or only physiological solution[PS group (PG); n=30]. Both groups were investigated using the Sniffin Sticks test (SST) battery, Questionnaire of Olfactory Disorder (QOD) and Zung Anxiety Scale (SAS) before randomization and after treatment. Paired t-test analysis found a statistically significant reduction in odour threshold (OT) and an improvement in QOD and SAS between pre- and post-treatment results only in the HAG. Furthermore, positive correlations were found between the OT reduction, SAS and QOD improvement. Thus, intranasal administration of HA could be suggested as a further well-tolerated resource in alleviating MCS olfactory discomfort.
While olfactory deficit is already known to be associated with early-stage Parkinson’s disease (PD), taste perception has not fully clarified so far. In this study, we investigated the taste performance in 61 patients with PD and 66 healthy controls (HC) using the Whole Mouth (WMT) and Taste Strip Tests (TST). In addition, we evaluated their olfactory function by means of the Sniffin’ Sticks Test (SST). TST score was significantly lower in PD patients than in HC (TST score 11.0 ± 2.8 vs. 12.2 ± 2.1; p&lt;0.018) while WMT showed no difference. The olfactory evaluation confirmed the results reported in the literature with a significant reduction of the SST score in PD patients than in HC (SST score 7.0 ± 2.8 vs. 11.3 ± 2.8; p&lt;0.0001). The conflicting results revealed by TST and WMT could rely on a taste impairment not detectable at supra-threshold concentration of tastes, typical of the daily life. Possible biological correlates of taste impairment in PD are discussed.
Insect repellents are widely used to protect against insect bites and thus prevent allergic reaction and the spread of disease. To gain insight into the mosquito's response to chemicals repellents, we investigated the interaction between the olfactory system of the mosquito Culex quinquefasciatus Say and chemical repellents using single sensillum recording. The interactions of 50 repellent chemicals with olfactory receptor neurons were measured in six different types of mosquito sensilla: long sharp trichoid (LST), short sharp trichoid (SST), short blunt trichoid I (SBT-I), short blunt trichoid II (SBT-II), short blunt trichoid-curved (SBT-C), and grooved peg (GP). A single olfactory neuron reacted to the chemical repellents in each of the sensilla except for SBT-I and SBT-II, where two neurons were involved. Other than LST and GP, which showed no or very weak responses to the repellents tested, all the sensilla showed significant excitatory responses to certain types of repellents. Terpene-derived chemicals such as eucalyptol, α-pinene, and camphor, stimulated olfactory receptor neurons in a dose-dependent manner and mosquitoes responded more strongly to terpene-derived chemical repellents than to non-terpene-derived chemicals such as dimethyl phthalate. Mosquitoes also exhibited a similar response to stereoisomers of chemicals such as (-)-β-pinene versus (+)-β-pinene, and (-)-menthone versus (+)-menthone. This study not only demonstrates the effects of chemical repellents on the mosquito olfactory system but also provides important information that will assist those screening new mosquito repellents and designing new mosquito control agents.
Olfactory dysfunction has been described in obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Brain regions involved in smell processing partially overlap with structures included in the neurobiological models of OCD, although no previous studies have analyzed the neuroanatomical correlates of olfactory dysfunction in this disorder. The aim of our study was to examine the association between regional gray matter volume, as assessed by a voxel-based morphometry analysis of magnetic resonance images (MRI), and olfactory function, as assessed by the Sniffin' Sticks test (SST). Olfactory function was assessed in 19 OCD patients and 19 healthy volunteers. All participants were also scanned in a 1.5-T magnet to obtain T1-weighted anatomical MRIs, which were pre-processed and analyzed with SPM8. Three different correlation models were used to study the association between regional gray matter volumes and olfactory function in the domains assessed by the SST: detection threshold, discrimination, and identification. OCD patients showed a significant impairment in all the domains assessed by the SST. Voxel-based mapping revealed a positive association in healthy controls between detection threshold and the gray matter content of a left anterior cingulate cortex cluster. In OCD patients, a positive correlation was observed between identification errors and the gray matter volume of the left medial orbital gyrus. In a post hoc analysis, these two gray matter regions were shown to be enlarged in OCD patients. Our findings support the idea that olfactory dysfunction in OCD is associated with volumetric changes in brain areas typically implicated in the neurobiology of the disorder.
Impaired olfaction is considered to be a risk factor for malnutrition in older adults; however, there is little research on this association. The aim of this study was to investigate whether olfactory deficits are associated with an impaired nutritional status in older patients.
Study participants were recruited from a geriatric day hospital. Nutritional status was assessed with body mass index and Mini-Nutritional Assessment. Olfactory function was evaluated with the Sniffin' Sticks test (SST) and subjectively rated by the patient. Self-caring capacity was rated with the Barthel Index and cognitive status with the Mini-Mental State Examination.
One hundred ninety-one patients, 71.7% female, were included with a mean age of 79.6 ± 6.3 years. Prevalence of hyposmia was 39.3%, and 31.9% of patients were functionally anosmic. Malnourished patients did not have a significantly lower Sniffin' Sticks test score than patients at nutritional risk or malnourished patients. In linear regression analysis, nutritional status was only influenced by Barthel Index, age, and number of drugs but not by olfactory function.
In this sample, olfactory function was not associated with nutritional status.
Impaired olfaction is an early symptom of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Neuroanatomical changes underlying this deficit in the olfactory system are largely unknown. Cell neurodegeneration is known to involve, among others, somatostatin (SST)- and calcium-binding protein-positive cells. We report here quantitative analysis of temporal changes in the distribution of interneuron cell populations in the olfactory cortex of an AβPP/PS1 double-transgenic mouse model of AD and its correlation with amyloid-β pathology. To investigate early stages of pathology, the piriform and lateral entorhinal cortices were analyzed in groups of homozygous AβPP/PS1 and control animals at 2, 4, 6, and 8 months of age. There was a significant increase in brain levels of aggregated amyloid-β peptide with age, accompanied by an early and marked fall in numbers of SST- and calretinin-positive interneurons; a later and less pronounced decrease in levels of calbindin- and parvalbumin-positive cells was also observed. In addition, double-labeling experiments indicated high levels of co-localization of SST-positive cells with amyloid-β expression in olfactory areas. These observations argue that SST-positive cells are vulnerable to amyloid-β neuropathy in the olfactory cortex during the early stages of AD. These data may cast light on the neural basis of hyposmia associated with this disorder and on the mechanisms of cell vulnerability to neurodegeneration.
The idiopathic Parkinson disease (IPD) is traditionally diagnosed by motor signs, but non-motor symptoms and signs are frequent and may help in the clinical diagnosis.
To evaluate the olfactory function in Brazilian healthy subjects, patients with early-onset PD (EOPD) and late-onset PD (LOPD) using the Sniffin' Sticks odor-identification test (SST).
We studied 70 patients with IPD (19 EOPD and 51 LOPD) and 70 controls matched for gender, age and years of schooling. Subjects with dementia and loss of smell for other reasons were excluded.
The SST showed a significant difference (p&lt;0.001) between groups: control groups (12.0 + or - 0.3), EOPD (8.3 + or - 0.7), and LOPD (6.7 + or - 0.4) when the groups were adjusted for gender, age, disease duration, and years of schooling.
Both groups of IPD patients presented olfactory impairments, but those whose symptoms started before 45 years-old (EOPD) had better sense of smell than the LOPD patients.
The homeodomain transcription factor Nkx2.1 is expressed in the pallidal (subcortical) telencephalon, including the medial ganglionic eminence (MGE) and preoptic area. Studies have shown that Nkx2.1 is required for normal patterning of the MGE and for the specification of the parvalbumin (PV)- and somatostatin (SST)-expressing cortical interneurons. To define the contribution of Nkx2.1 lineages to neurons in the mature telencephalon, we have generated transgenic mice carrying the genomic integration of a modified bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) in which the second exon of Nkx2.1 is replaced by the Cre recombinase. Analysis of these mice has found that they express the Cre recombinase and Cre reporters within Nkx2.1-expressing domains of the brain, thyroid, pituitary, and lung. Telencephalic expression of reporters begins at about embryonic day 10.5. Expression both of Cre and of recombination-based Cre reporters is weaker within the dorsalmost region of the MGE than in other Nkx2.1-expressing regions. In this paper, we present fate-mapping data on Nkx2.1-lineage neurons throughout the telencephalon, including the cerebral cortex, amygdala, olfactory bulb, striatum, globus pallidus, septum, and nucleus basalis.
The role of brain somatostatin (SST) on memory function after olfactory bulbectomy (OBX) was investigated by using the passive-avoidance task and immunohistochemical analyses in mice. The present study indicated that the learning and memory-related behaviour was impaired on the 7th and 14th day, but not on the 1st day after OBX. The impairment of learning and memory-related behaviour on the 14th day after OBX was dose-dependently reversed by intracerebroventricularly administered SST (1 microg per mouse). To ascertain the correlation between SST in mouse brain and the impairment of learning and memory-related behaviour induced by OBX, the immunohistochemical distribution of brain SST was determined by fluorescence intensity using two-dimensional microphotometry. The intensity of SST fluorescence was low in the hippocampus on the 14th day after OBX in comparison with Sham controls. These results suggest that SST in the hippocampus is related to the impairment of learning and memory-related behaviour induced by OBX.
Five somatostatin receptors (sst) have been cloned and mRNAs for the first four (sst1-4) are expressed in many brain regions. In the present work, we compared the distribution of the non-selective ligand [125I]-Tyr0-DTrp8-SRIF14 by autoradiography in 24 brain regions and pituitary in wild type, sst1- to sst4- or SRIF-gene invalidated (KO) mice. [125I]-Tyr0-DTrp8-SRIF14 binding was not significantly modified in sst1 KO mouse brain with the noticeable exception of the substantia nigra and only moderately decreased in pituitary. For sst2 KO mice, a general decrease (&gt;75%) was observed in most regions, with the noticeable exception of the olfactory bulb and CA1 field of the hippocampus. SST3 KO brain displayed a decrease in binding in the external plexiform layer of the olfactory bulb only (-54%). For sst4 KO mice, [125I]-Tyr0-DTrp8-SRIF14 binding levels in the external plexiform (-35%) and glomerular (-39%) layers of the olfactory bulb as well as the hippocampus CA1 field (-68%) were significantly decreased. In SRIF KO mice, a significant increase in binding levels was observed in olfactory bulb, anterior olfactory nucleus, frontal cortex upper layers, lateral septum, CA1 field, zona incerta and lateral hypothalamus, substantia nigra, periaqueductal grey and parabrachial nucleus. Competition with selective ligands (CH275, octreotide or L-779,976, L-796,778, L-803,087, and octreotide or L-817,778, for sst1-5 receptors, respectively) was in accordance with these findings. Moreover, octreotide was still able to compete on residual [125I]-Tyr0-DTrp8-SRIF14 binding sites in sst2 KO pituitary. It is concluded that most [125I]-Tyr0-DTrp8-SRIF14 binding sites in mouse brain and pituitary belong to the sst2 subtype but for the olfactory bulb (sst3 and sst4 receptors), the CA1 of the hippocampus (sst4 receptors) and the pituitary (sst5 and sst1 receptors) in which other subtypes are also expressed. The overall increase in [125I]-Tyr0-DTrp8-SRIF14 binding in SRIF KO mice indicates that SRIF receptors, mostly from the sst2 subtype, are regulated by the endogenous ligand(s).
During development in the chick embryo, luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) neurons migrate along the olfactory nerve from the olfactory epithelium to the forebrain. At embryonic day 5.5 (E5.5) to E6.0, the majority of LHRH neurons begin to enter the medial forebrain and then course dorsocaudally along the forebrain substance just beneath the pia matter in association with the somatostatin (SST)-positive fibers, which branch medially from the SST-positive olfactory nerve. By E6.5, the neurons and SST-positive medial branch of the olfactory nerve have proceeded toward the septal area. Intense immunoreactivity for the polysialylated form of neural cell adhesion molecule (PSA-NCAM) on both the LHRH neurons and the SST-positive fibers during this period suggests that this less adhesive form of NCAM is involved in the migratory process. This possibility was examined by using a polysialic acid (PSA)-specific endoneuraminidase. PSA removal did not alter the behavior or appearance of the SST-positive olfactory fibers within the migration pathway. However, it induced a significant deviation of migrating LHRH neurons from the regular path in the forebrain. The effect of PSA removal is more likely to involve changes in the interaction of the migrating neurons with a subset of the SST-positive olfactory fibers and/or other elements in the forebrain rather than an alteration in the pattern of their axonal substrate. On the basis of these results, it is suggested that PSA contributes to the specific pattern of LHRH neuronal migration in the forebrain by limiting interaction of these LHRH neurons with their surrounding environment.
The current study investigated responsivity to individualized food cues consisting of binge/favourite foods in 17 women with bulimic nervosa (BN) and 17 women with no history or current symptoms of eating disorders (C). The hypothesis that increasing cue salience would be associated with an increase in responsivity was tested by comparison of self reported urges, affective responses and salivation to the sight and smell (SS) and the sight, smell and taste (SST) of a binge/favourite food compared to a neutral stimulus (lettuce leaf). As predicted, the BN group reported a greater urge to binge and higher levels of stress/arousal to selected binge/favourite food cues compared to the C group. The BN group also reported lower confidence to resist the urge to binge and control over food intake compared to the C group. Further, a series of planned comparisons in the BN group found that the urge to binge, stress, and loss of control were greater when participants were exposed to the SST cue than to the SS cue. There was no difference between the groups in salivary responsivity to food cues. These results are discussed in terms of a conditioning model of cue reactivity.
We successfully apply a solute tempering approach, which substantially reduces the large number of temperature rungs required in conventional tempering methods by solvent charge scaling, to hybrid molecular dynamics simulations combining quantum mechanics with molecular mechanics (QM/MM). Specifically, we integrate a combination of density functional theory (DFT) and polarizable MM (PMM) force fields into the simulated solute tempering (SST) concept. We show that the required DFT/PMM-SST weight parameters can be obtained from inexpensive calculations and that for alanine dipeptide (DFT) in PMM water three rungs suffice to cover the temperature range from 300 to 550 K.
For the enhanced conformational sampling in molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, we present "simulated solute tempering" (SST) which is an easy to implement variant of simulated tempering. SST extends conventional simulated tempering (CST) by key concepts of "replica exchange with solute tempering" (REST, Liu et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005, 102, 13749). We have applied SST, CST, and REST to molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of an alanine octapeptide in explicit water. The weight parameters required for CST and SST are determined by two different formulas whose performance is compared. For SST only one of them yields a uniform sampling of the temperature space. Compared to CST and REST, SST provides the highest exchange probabilities between neighboring rungs in the temperature ladder. Concomitantly, SST leads to the fastest diffusion of the simulation system through the temperature space, in particular, if the "even-odd" exchange scheme is employed in SST. As a result, SST exhibits the highest sampling speed of the investigated tempering methods.
Immune privilege (IP) is believed to exist in the anagen hair follicle (HF). Studies have shown that downregulation of major histocompatibility complex Class I occurs and immunosuppressive factors are expressed in the HF bulb and bulge. However, demonstration and quantification of functional IP in HF cells are required. We examined the middle (sheath) and lower (bulb) portions of the human HF using quantitative real-time RT-PCR (qPCR), immunohistology, ELISA, in vitro coculture with peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), and flow cytometry. We found that HF cells, relative to non-follicular epidermal cells, failed to promote allogeneic PBMC proliferation and CD4(+) and CD8(+) IFNγ production. By qPCR, we found significant downregulation of Class I and Class II HLA alleles in both the bulb and sheath, and upregulation of multiple immunoregulatory genes. It is noteworthy that somatostatin (SST) was significantly upregulated relative to epidermis. By immunohistochemistry, SST was most strongly expressed in the HF outer root sheath, and, by ELISA, cultured sheath cells secreted SST. PBMCs, cultured with stimulatory allogeneic epidermal cells and SST, secreted significantly less IFNγ than controls. Addition of SST antagonists to PBMCs cocultured with allogeneic HF cells increased IFNγ secretion. The data identify SST as a secretory factor potentially contributing to the HF IP repertoire.
Ingested immunoactive proteins type I IFN, SIRS peptide 1-21, α-MSH, ACTH, SST inhibit clinical attacks and inflammation in acute EAE by decreasing Th1-like cytokines, increasing Th2-like cytokines or increasing T(reg) cell frequencies.
We examined whether another protein, thyrotropin releasing factor (TRH), would have similar anti-inflammatory effects in EAE after oral administration.
B6 mice were immunized with MOG peptide 35-55 and gavaged with control saline or TRH during ongoing disease. Splenocytes from mock fed or TRH fed mice were adoptively transferred into active MOG peptide 35-55 immunized recipient mice during ongoing disease.
Ingested (oral) TRH inhibited ongoing disease and decreased inflammation. Adoptively transferred cells from TRH fed donors protected against actively induced disease and decreased inflammation. In actively fed mice, oral TRH decreased IL-17 and TNF-α cytokines in both the spleen and the CNS. In recipients of donor cells from TRH fed mice there was a reduction of Th1 and Th17 and induction of Th2-like IL-13 cytokines in both the spleen and CNS. Oral TRH decreased clinical score and decreased inflammatory foci in both actively fed and recipients of actively fed mice. There was no significant increase in T(reg) cell frequencies in actively fed or recipients of TRH fed donor cells.
Ingested (orally administered) TRH can inhibit clinical disease, inhibit CNS inflammation by decreasing Th1-like, Th17 and TNF-α cytokines and increasing Th2-like cytokines (IL-13) in the CNS.
Ingested immunoactive proteins type I interferon, soluble immune response suppressor peptide 1-21 and melanocyte-stimulating hormone inhibit clinical attacks and inflammation in acute experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE).
We examined whether another immunoactive protein, somatostatin (SST), would have similar anti-inflammatory effects on EAE after oral administration.
B6 mice were immunized with MOG peptide 35-55 and gavaged with control saline or SST during ongoing disease. Splenocytes from mock-fed or SST-fed mice were adoptively transferred into active MOG peptide 35-55-immunized recipient mice during ongoing disease.
In actively fed mice, increased Th2-like cytokines in both the spleen and the central nervous system (CNS) inhibited active disease. In recipients of donor cells from SST-fed donors, reduction of Th1 and Th17 and induction of Th2-like IL-4 cytokines in both the spleen and CNS inhibited disease. T(reg) cells were increased threefold in actively fed spleen cells that are responsible for protection against disease after adoptive transfer.
Ingested (orally administered) SST can inhibit clinical disease, inhibit CNS inflammation by decreasing Th17 and Th1-like cytokines and increasing Th2-like cytokines in the CNS via induction of T(reg) cells.
Monitoring and repeated staging is of substantial importance in many patients with primary cutaneous T-cell lymphomas (CTCL). For primary cutaneous B-cell lymphomas (CBCL), extensive initial staging is the mainstay for correct diagnosis.
To evaluate the value of somatostatin receptor scintigraphy using the radiolabeled somatostatin analog (111)In-pentetreotide in comparison to conventional imaging methods for the staging of patients with primary CTCL and primary CBCL.
Twenty-two patients (15 patients with histologically verified CTCL and 7 patients with histologically verified CBCL) were included. Stage of disease was established by physical examination, laboratory screening, skin inspection, palpation of superficial lymph nodes, sonography and computed tomography (CT) in patients with advanced clinical stage. Focally elevated tracer uptake of (111)In-pentetreotide was compared to common imaging modalities, physical aspect and digital photographs of the respective skin lesions.
Of the 15 patients with CTCL, only 4 (27%) showed positive scintigraphic results, but not in all sites of lymphomatous involvement. None of the five patients with mycosis fungoides in stage I, nor any of the four patients with Sézary syndrome, had a positive (111)In- pentetreotide scan. Of the seven patients with CBCL three positive scintigraphic results (43%) could be obtained: in two patients with a follicular center lymphoma and one patient with a diffuse large B-cell lymphoma - leg type, but again not in all apparent sites of lymphoma.
Based on our results, we do not recommend the use of somatostatin receptor scintigraphy for routine staging of patients with CTCL and CBCL. As our series includes only 22 patients, and the number of patients with rarer variants of CTCL was rather small, it might be too premature to abandon SST-R in the staging of patients with cutaneous lymphomas.
Apart from evaluating orbital inflammation in Graves' ophthalmopathy (GO), somatostatin (SST) analogs have been proposed as a therapy, but recent trials were disappointing. We aimed to measure somatostatin receptor (SSTR) expression in orbital tissues ex vivo and determine whether the new broad-affinity analog SOM230 might be of therapeutic use. Orbital adipose/connective tissues from 29 GO patients and 10 normal individuals were analyzed. Transcripts were quantified using SYBR Green and a light cycler. In vitro models were used to investigate whether thyrotropin receptor activation (as occurs via thyroid stimulating antibodies) or adipogenesis affected SSTR expression in primary preadipocytes and to compare the biological activity of octreotide and SOM230 in their modulation. The expression of SSTR1 was significantly higher in GO patients than normal controls (P = 0.024). Although differences in the expression of SSTR2 were not significant, 39% of GO samples had levels above the 97th percentile of the controls. SSTR3, -4, and -5 were at or below the limit of detection (LOD). The lymphocyte contribution was minimal, since CD3alpha transcripts were at the LOD. TSH receptor activation did not modulate SSTR expression. An in vitro model of adipogenesis indicated upregulation of SSTR1 and SSTR2 during differentiation. SOM230 produced significantly greater inhibition of orbital preadipocyte proliferation than octreotide. Ex vivo analysis of orbital tissues reveals upregulation of SSTR1 and -2 in a group of GO patients. Adipogenesis, a process occurring in GO orbits, provides one possible explanation for some of the observed increase.
Sho-saiko-to (SST), a Chinese/Japanese traditional herbal medicine, has been widely used to treat chronic hepatitis in Japan, and the immunomodulatory properties of SST are likely to mediate its beneficial effect. In the present study, we examined the effects of SST and its various ingredients on the count and proliferation of T-cell subsets in cultured splenocytes and hepatic mononuclear cells. SST, wogonin-7-O-glucuronoside (a major SST ingredient), and wogonin (an intestinal metabolite of wogonin-7-O-glucuronoside) increased CD4/CD8 ratio via a decrease of CD8+ T-cell counts with no effect on CD4+ T-cell counts. Flow cytometric analyses of viability, proliferation, and cell cycle revealed that wogonin suppressed CD8+ T-cell proliferation without inducing cell death. SST and wogonin administered to mice increased the CD4/CD8 ratio in hepatic mononuclear cells but not in splenocytes. These findings suggest that SST may modulate the CD4/CD8 ratio via the selective inhibition of CD8+ T-cell proliferation by the SST ingredient wogonin-7-O-glucuronoside or its metabolite wogonin.
Somatostatin (SST) peptide is produced by various SST-secreting cells throughout the body and acts as a neurotransmitter or paracrine/autocrine regulator in response to ions, nutrients, peptides hormones and neurotransmitters. SST is also widely distributed in the periphery to regulate the inflammatory and immune cells in response to hormones, growth factors, cytokines and other secretive molecules. SST peptides are considered the most important physiologic regulator of the islet cell, gastrointestinal cell and immune cell functions, and the importance of SST production levels has been implicated in several diseases including diabetes. The expression of SST receptors has also been found in T lymphocytes and primary immunologic organs. Interaction of SST and its receptors is also involved in T-cell proliferation and thymocyte selection. SSTR gene-ablated mice developed diabetes with morphologic, physiologic and immunologic alterations in the endocrine pancreas. Increased levels of mononuclear cell infiltration of the islets are associated with the increased levels of antigen-presenting cells located in the islets and peripancreatic lymph nodes. Increased levels of SST were also found in antigen-presenting cells and are associated with a significant increase of CD8 expression levels on CD4(+)/CD8(+) immature thymocytes. These findings highlight the crucial role of this neuroendocrine peptide and its receptors in regulating autoimmune functions.
Somatostatin (SS)-binding sites have been demonstrated in human lymphoid tissues and peripheral blood cells. However, not much is known with respect to the SS receptor subtype (sst) expression pattern and the expression of SS itself in the immune system.
The aim of this study was to evaluate the mRNA expression of the five known sst (sst(1-5)) in peripheral blood mononuclear cell (sub)populations. Moreover, the expression of the mRNAs encoding SS and the SS-like peptide cortistatin (CST) in immune cell subsets was studied.
RT-PCR and quantitative PCR were performed to evaluate sst, SS and CST mRNA expression in cells in the basal or activated state. Fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS) analysis using fluorescent SS was performed to visualize sst protein on cell membranes.
B- and T-lymphocytes selectively expressed sst(3) mRNA. sst(3) expression in B-lymphocytes was significantly lower compared with T-lymphocytes. Unstimulated, freshly isolated monocytes did not express any sst mRNA. Upon activation, monocytes selectively expressed sst(2) mRNA, whereas T-lymphocyte activation upregulated sst(3) expression. sst(2) mRNA expression on monocytes was confirmed by FACS analysis. B- and T-lymphocytes did not express SS mRNA, while both cell types expressed CST mRNA. CST mRNA expression was downregulated following T-lymphocyte activation.
We demonstrate for the first time unequivocally that human peripheral blood B- and T-lymphocytes selectively express sst(3), whereas monocytes do not express sst. However, upon activation, monocytes are induced to express sst(2A). No expression of SS mRNA was detected in any cell type, whereas all cell types expressed CST mRNA. The differential expression of sst and CST mRNA in lymphocytes and monocytes suggests a functional significance for the CST-sst interaction in immune cells, but further studies should be performed to evaluate the significance of sst and CST in these cells.
The purpose of the present study was to investigate the relation between the dose of tumor cell inoculation (especially the doses less than minimum required to evoke tumor growth) and the anti-tumor immune system, particularly lymphoblast formation and cytotoxic activity of lymphcytes.
We inoculated rats with various doses of SST-2 tumor cells and examined natural killer (NK) cell activity and lymphoblast formationin vitro.
The results showed that the cytotoxicities against SST-2 cells and lymphoblast formation of lymphocytes were enhanced by small dose inoculation of tumor cells that could not induce tumor growth.
It was suggested that was lymphocutes play an important role as an anti-tumor immune system at small doses of tumor inoculation, which appears to reflect an early stage of tumor growthin vivo. It was also suggested that SST-2 tumor inoculation might be a useful model for studying the anti-tumor immune response in SHR rats.
Cells of the human immune system have been shown to express somatostatin receptors (sst). The expression of sst suggests a functional role of the peptide somatostatin (SS). However, SS expression has not been demonstrated yet in different human immune tissues. Therefore, we investigated by RT-PCR the expression of both SS and cortistatin (CST), a SS-like peptide, in various human lymphoid tissues and immune cells. We detected SS mRNA expression in the human thymus only, while not in thymocytes. CST mRNA was clearly expressed in the immune cells, lymphoid tissues, and bone marrow. Using quantitative RT-PCR, significant differences in expression levels between tissues were demonstrated. Expression of CST mRNA was up-regulated during differentiation of monocytes into macrophages and dendritic cells and could be up-regulated by lipopolysaccharide stimulation. Two differently sized cDNA fragments of CST were detected in the majority of cells and tissues. However, although both fragments were detected in nearly all T-cell lines (7 of 8), most of the B-cell lines expressed the short fragment only (8 of 10). Using autoradiography, we showed that CST displaced [125I-Tyr3]octreotide binding with relatively high affinity on human thymic tissue and sst2-expressing cells. This is the first extensive study demonstrating that human lymphoid tissues and immune cells express different levels of CST mRNA and that its expression can be regulated. On the basis of these observations, we hypothesize a role for CST as an endogenous ligand of at least the sst2 receptor in the human immune system, rather than SS itself.
The clinical effectiveness of the Kampo medicine Sho-seiryu-to (SST) has recently been demonstrated in a double-blind randomized study of allergic asthma and rhinitis. We investigated the effect of SST on a type 1 allergic model in mice. Ovalbumin (OVA)-induced sneezing and the total and OVA-specific IgE levels were significantly suppressed with SST at 1.0 g/kg, but that of OVA-specific IgG(2a) was not. In the splenocytes isolated from SST-administered mice, OVA-induced interleukin (IL)-4 production decreased while interferon (IFN)-gamma production was not. The co-culture experiments using purified CD4(+)T cells and antigen-presenting cells (APCs) suggested that SST influenced both cell types. Flow-cytometric analysis showed that SST suppressed the number of IL-4 producing CD4(+)T cells but not the number of IFN-gamma producing CD4(+)T cells. The CD86(+) major histocompatibility complex class II(+) (MHC II)(+) cells and CD28(+)CD4(+)T cells were decreased by SST treatment, while CD80(+)MHC II(+) cells, CD40(+)MHC II(+) cells and CD154(+)CD4(+)T cells showed no change. These data suggested that SST may suppress IL-4 production in CD4(+)T cells via influencing CD28-CD86 interaction. In addition to the previously reported inhibitory activity on histamine release, suppression of Th2 differentiation at the stage of APC-CD4(+)T cell interaction may be involved in the anti-allergic effects of SST.
Programmed cell death, also termed apoptosis, is the main focus of interest in a variety of scientific and clinical areas. For a better understanding of the mechanisms of apoptosis, from the onset of the cellular death program to the late stages of apoptosis or apoptotic necrosis, very early functional events have to be quantified because they might be involved in temporal and causal relationships between apoptosis-related key processes.
We have established a flow cytometric technique to quantify time-dependent signals simultaneously with high temporal resolution (Deltat = 1 s) in living cells. With this technique, the response of cells to apoptosis-stimulating agents can be analyzed over 15 min. For this purpose, a thermostatted sample tube holder for repeatable interruption-free injection of substances into the cell suspension was developed. Early detectable fluorescence and scatter parameters were related to intracellular free Ca2+ concentration, [Ca2+]i (Indo-1 fluorometry), membrane permeability (propidium iodide [PI] influx), and cell volume (forward scatter).
A T-cell line (Jurkat) served as a model system. Apoptosis was induced by the biozid Tri-n-butyltin (TBT). Dependent on the TBT concentration (0.3-10 microM), the mean free [Ca2+]i increased by a factor of 1.2-6 during a short time interval of just 2 min. Especially after low TBT concentrations (&lt; 0.5 microM), this [Ca2+]i increase was nearly transient during the observation time of 15 min. Higher TBT concentrations (0.5-10 microM), however, induced a transient increase of [Ca2+]i (Ca-TR) only in a fraction of the cells; in another subpopulation, a steady-state Ca2+ signal (Ca-SST) was observed. The analysis of the simultaneously registered PI signals of the Ca-SST cells showed a shift to increasing PI fluorescence (by a factor of about 4) with increasing Ca2+ concentrations. In Ca-TR cells, the PI fluorescence remained nearly unchanged. These apoptosis-related changes (increase in [Ca(2+)]i and membrane permeability) could be confirmed by the additional observation of a TBT concentration-dependent decrease in cell volume measured during the same early time period.
The simultaneously analyzed parameters (i.e., [Ca2+]i, membrane permeability, and cell volume) suggested that, in our model system of Jurkat T-cells treated with TBT, an apoptotic cell fate was indicated very early (within 15 min) by the steady-state [Ca2+]i level.
When BALB/c mice were treated with a Kampo (Japanese herbal) medicine "Sho-seiryu-to (SST)" (1 g/kg, 10 times) orally from 7 days before to 5 days after the infection and infected with mouse-adapted influenza virus A/PR/8/34 by nasal-site restricted infection, SST caused increment of the influenza virus hemagglutinin-specific IgA antibody secreting cells in nasal lymphocyte but not in Peyer's patch lymphocyte at 6 days after infection in comparison with water-treated mice. Oral administration of SST also augmented IL-2 receptor beta chain+ (activated) T-cell in Peyer's patch lymphocyte, but not in the nasal lymphocyte. We previously reported that SST showed potent anti-influenza virus activity through augmentation of the antiviral IgA antibody titer in the nasal and broncho-alveolar cavities of the mice (T. Nagai and H. Yamada, 1994, Int. J. Immunopharmacol. 16, 605-613). These results suggest that oral administration of SST shows anti-influenza virus activity in the nasal cavity by activation of T-cell in Peyer's patch lymphocyte and stimulation of production of anti-influenza virus IgA antibody in nasal lymphocyte. When ovalbumin-sensitized allergic pulmonary inflammation model mice were administered orally with SST (1 g/kg) from 8 days before (11 times) or from 2 h after (4 times) to 4 days after the infection and infected with mouse-adapted influenza virus A/PR/8/34, replications of the virus in the both nasal and broncho-alveolar cavities or only nasal cavity were significantly inhibited at 5 days after infection in comparison with water-treated control by augmenting antiviral IgA antibody, respectively. These results suggest that SST is useful for both prophylaxis and treatment of influenza virus infection on patients with allergic pulmonary inflammation, such as bronchial asthma.
Synergistic effects of active hexose correlated compound (AHCC) extracted from mushroom on the treatment with UFT against mammary adenocarcinoma, SST-2 cells, in congenitally T cell-depressed spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) were observed. AHCC plus UFT had slight but significant effects on the growth of primary tumors. Pulmonary metastases were not inhibited by the treatment with AHCC plus UFT, whereas metastases to axillary lymph nodes (LN) were obviously inhibited. Combination of AHCC plus UFT showed similar synergistic anti-metastatic effects in SHR rats with accelerated pulmonary metastases following the surgical removal of the primary tumors. In vitro studies demonstrated that AHCC plus UFT enhanced the NK cell activity in tumor-bearing rats, whereas UFT alone depressed the NK cell activity. AHCC plus UFT also enhanced the NO production and cytotoxicity of peritoneal macrophages. In addition, AHCC restored the suppressed mRNA expression of interleukin-1alpha and tumor necrosis factor-alpha induced by the chemotherapy. Taken together, the combination of AHCC plus UFT brought about good therapeutic effects not only on primary tumor growth but also on reducing metastasis and these effects were mediated by host immunity which was restored or activated by AHCC. AHCC may be a good candidate for a biological response modifier.
Sho-saiko-to (SST), a traditional Kampo medicine, has been examined for its inhibitory effect on human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) replication in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). SST alone moderately inhibited HIV-1 replication at a concentration of 25 microg/ml. When SST was combined with zidovudine (AZT), lamivudine (3TC) or AZT plus 3TC, SST enhanced the anti-HIV-1 activity of 3TC. In contrast, SST slightly enhanced the anti-HIV-1 activity of AZT plus 3TC but did not enhance the activity of AZT alone. These results suggest that the combination of SST and 3TC has potential as a chemotherapeutic modality of HIV-1 infection.
Specific somatostatin receptors (ssts) have been described in normal and tumor tissues and identified on more than 95% of normal mitogen-activated human peripheral lymphocytes. Somatostatin may modulate the immune response by a variety of mechanisms, most of which are inhibitory, sst scintigraphy in patients with immune-mediated diseases revealed sst expression in 97% of patients with sarcoidosis, 100% of patients with tuberculosis or Wegener's granulomatosis, 75% of patients with Sjõgren's syndrome, and 50% of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus or uveitis. sst expression appeared to be related to progression or remission of disease. Patients who responded poorly to therapy remained positive at scintigraphy. Investigation of 10 human B-cell lines and eight human T-cell lines, using a polymerase chain reaction, revealed the presence of sst2-mRNA in two of the B-cell and two of the T-cell lines. Visualization of ssts on activated mononuclear leukocytes by sst scintigraphy may prove useful in evaluating the spread of immune-mediated diseases and their responses to therapy. The efficacy of octreotide should be studied in patients with these diseases.
Since T-cells and the T-cell receptor (TCR) play a pivotal role in the response of the immune system, they are a target for pathogenesis studies in immune mediated diseases and have been used to generate markers for T-cell dependent diseases in humans and dogs. TCR rearrangement is generated at the genomic DNA level and can be analyzed by Southern blotting techniques. In the present study this method to detect rearrangement of the TCR beta chain in the dog was critically examined. To search for restriction fragment length differences due to either inherited polymorphism or in diseases with suspected superantigen influence (X-linked severe combined immune deficiency and canine juvenile polyarteritis syndrome) 13 dog families of three different breeds were examined. In addition primary spleen cell cultures, stimulated with either phytohemagglutinin A (PHA) or staphylococcus enterotoxin A (SEA) and B (SEB) were studied. The germline digest pattern of the enzymes Pst I, Sst I, Bgl II, Eco RI and Eco RV were identical in all dogs examined with the exception of one dog with canine juvenile polyarteritis syndrome. In this dog an additional band was found in the Bgl II and Eco RV digestion suggestive of specific TCR rearrangement. Bam HI digestion revealed restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs) showing Mendelian inheritance. After digestion of the genomic DNA extracted from PHA, SEA or SEB stimulated spleen cells and Southern blot analysis, no differences in fragment patterns between the unstimulated cells and the stimulated cells could be detected. An important point to consider before a specific pattern variation between dogs is classified to be a marker for a specific disease or is used in pathogenesis studies, is the possibility of an inherited RFLP, especially after Bam HI digestion. In such studies the combined examination of the parents and the offspring must be recommended.
