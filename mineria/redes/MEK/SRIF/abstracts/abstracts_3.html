Although 20 micrograms/ml of baicalin was not cytotoxic to CEM cells, a cultured T cell line, it proved to be cytotoxic to HIV-infected CEM cells (CEM-HIV) with a higher HIV-releasing capacity and DNA fragmentation was detected within 24 hr of incubation. However, after incubation of CEM-HIV with a lower dose of baicalin (0.1, 0.3 and 2 micrograms/ml) for 24 and 48 hr, the viable cell number increased by about 25% and the p24 release into the medium was 25% lower than that of the control. After further incubation in the presence of the agent for 6 and 9 days, only cells with a lower HIV-releasing capacity survived. Baicalin might selectively induce apoptosis of CEM-HIV cells which have a high virus-releasing capacity, and stimulate proliferation of CEM-HIV which have a relatively lower capacity of HIV-production.
Metastases expressing tumor-specific receptors can be targeted and treated by binding of radiolabeled peptides (peptide receptor radionuclide therapy or PRRT). For example, patients with metastasized somatostatin receptor-positive neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) can be treated with radiolabeled somatostatin analogues, resulting in strongly increased progression-free survival and quality of life. There is nevertheless still room for improvement, as very few patients can be cured at this stage of disease. We aimed to specifically sensitize replicating tumor cells without further damage to healthy tissues. Thereto we investigated the DNA damaging effects of PRRT with the purpose to enhance these effects through modulation of the DNA damage response. Although PRRT induces DNA double strand breaks (DSBs), a larger fraction of the induced lesions are single strand breaks (expected to be similar to those induced by external beam radiotherapy) that require poly-[ADP-ribose]-polymerase 1 (PARP-1) activity for repair. If these breaks cannot be repaired, they will cause replication fork arrest and DSB formation during replication. Therefore, we used the PARP-1 inhibitor Olaparib to increase the number of cytotoxic DSBs. Here we show that this new combination strategy synergistically sensitized somatostatin receptor expressing cells to PRRT. We observed increased cell death and reduced cellular proliferation compared to the PRRT alone. The enhanced cell death was caused by increased numbers of DSBs that are repaired with remarkably slow kinetics, leading to genome instability. Furthermore, we validated the increased DSB induction after PARP inhibitor addition in the clinically relevant model of living human NET slices. We expect that this combined regimen can thus augment current PRRT outcomes.
Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS) and autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) are two genetically distinct ciliopathies but share common phenotypes such as renal cysts. Seven BBS proteins form a complex called the BBSome which is localized at the basal body or ciliary axoneme and regulates the ciliary entry or flagellar exit of several signaling molecules. Here, we demonstrate that, unlike the seven-span somatostatin receptor 3 or the leptin receptor that interacts with all subunits of the BBSome, the ADPKD protein polycystin-1 (PC1) interacts with BBS1, BBS4, BBS5 and BBS8, four of the seven components of the BBSome. Only depletion or mutation of BBS1, but not depletion of BBS5 and BBS8, or knockout of BBS4, impairs ciliary trafficking of PC1 in kidney epithelial cells. Depletion of these BBS proteins affects neither the ciliary length nor the plasma membrane targeting of PC1. Expression of a pathogenic BBS3/Arl6 mutant (T31R) that locks Arl6 in the GDP form leads to stunted cilia and inhibition of PC1 on primary cilia. We propose that the 11-span membrane protein PC1 is a BBSome cargo and that the components of the BBSome may possess subunit-specific functions. Moreover, physical interactions between the BBS and ADPKD proteins may underline the overlapping renal phenotypes in these two diseases.
Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) is a multifactorial syndrome and we believe that an inefficient respiratory response to certain homeostatic stressors, such as hypoxia and hypercapnia, is a key factor in the etiology of SIDS. Hence, we genotyped two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes of importance for respiratory control: P2RY1 (adenosine diphosphate/adenosine triphosphate receptor) and SSTR2 (somatostatin receptor).
Two SNPs, Rs1466113 (C &gt; G dimorphism in SSTR2) and rs701265 (A &gt; G dimorphism in P2RY1), were typed in 175 SIDS cases and 195 controls and 275 SIDS cases and 338 controls, respectively. Genotyping was performed using TaqMan technology.
The determined genotype frequencies were SSTR2: CC (14.4 %), CG (49.7 %), GG (35.9 %) in controls and CC (17.1 %), CG (49.1 %), and GG (33.8 %) in SIDS; P2RY1: AA (70.6 %), AG (28.7 %), GG (0.7 %) in SIDS and AA (68.3 %), AG (27.9 %), and GG (3.8 %) in the control group. For rs701265 in P2RY1, homozygous G carriers were significantly more frequent in the control group (p = 0.02).
We think that allele G provides a protective effect in events of ventilatory stress. Moreover, the significant lack of P2Y1 G allele homozygotes in the SIDS group shows that respiratory response plays an important role in the etiology of SIDS. Thus, we believe it is worthwhile to further investigate functional polymorphisms within genes that are involved in respiratory control in the future.
Primary cilia are ubiquitous cellular antennae whose dysfunction collectively causes various disorders, including vision and hearing impairment, as well as renal, skeletal, and central nervous system anomalies. One ciliopathy, Alström syndrome, is closely related to Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS), sharing amongst other phenotypic features morbid obesity. As the cellular and molecular links between weight regulation and cilia are poorly understood, we used the obese mouse strain foz/foz, bearing a truncating mutation in the Alström syndrome protein (Alms1), to help elucidate why it develops hyperphagia, leading to early onset obesity and metabolic anomalies. Our in vivo studies reveal that Alms1 localizes at the base of cilia in hypothalamic neurons, which are implicated in the control of satiety. Alms1 is lost from this location in foz/foz mice, coinciding with a strong postnatal reduction (∼70%) in neurons displaying cilia marked with adenylyl cyclase 3 (AC3), a signaling protein implicated in obesity. Notably, the reduction in AC3-bearing cilia parallels the decrease in cilia containing two appetite-regulating proteins, Mchr1 and Sstr3, as well as another established Arl13b ciliary marker, consistent with progressive loss of cilia during development. Together, our results suggest that Alms1 maintains the function of neuronal cilia implicated in weight regulation by influencing the maintenance and/or stability of the organelle. Given that Mchr1 and Sstr3 localization to remaining cilia is maintained in foz/foz animals but known to be lost from BBS knockout mice, our findings suggest different molecular etiologies for the satiety defects associated with the Alström syndrome and BBS ciliopathies.
Potassium (K(+)) input occurs after meals or during ischemic exercise and is accompanied by a high concentration of L-lactate in plasma (P(L-lactate)).
We examined whether infusing 100 μmol L-lactic acid/min for 15 min would lead to a fall in the arterial plasma K(+) concentration (P(K)). We also aimed to evaluate the mechanisms involved in normal rats compared with rats with acute hyperkalemia caused by a shift of K(+) from cells or a positive K(+) balance.
There was a significant fall in P(K) in normal rats (0.25 mM) and a larger fall in P(K) in both models of acute hyperkalemia (0.6 mM) when the P(L-lactate) rose. The arterial P(K) increased by 0.8 mM (p &lt; 0.05) 7 min after stopping this infusion despite a 2-fold rise in the concentration of insulin in arterial plasma (P(Insulin)). There was a significant uptake of K(+) by the liver, but not by skeletal muscle. In rats pretreated with somatostatin, P(Insulin) was low and infusing L-lactic acid failed to lower the P(K).
A rise in the P(L-lactate) in portal venous blood led to a fall in the P(K) and insulin was permissive. Absorption of glucose by the Na(+)-linked glucose transporter permits enterocytes to produce enough ADP to augment aerobic glycolysis, raising the P(L-lactate) in the portal vein to prevent postprandial hyperkalemia.
In the present study, we describe the role of cytoplasmic terminal (C-tail) domain in regulating coupling to adenylyl cyclase, signaling, and apoptosis in human embryonic kidney (HEK-293) cells transfected with wild type (wt)-hSSTR3 and C-tail deleted mutants. Cells transfected with wt-hSSTR3 and C-tail mutants show comparable membrane expression; however, display decreased expression in presence of agonist. wt-hSSTR3 exists as preformed homodimer at cell surface in basal conditions and decreases in response to agonist. Cells expressing C-tail mutants also show evidence of homodimerization with the same intensity as wt-hSSTR3. The agonist-dependent inhibition of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) was lost in cells expressing C-tail mutants. Agonist treatment in cells expressing wt-hSSTR3 resulted in inhibition of cell proliferation, increased expression of PARP-1, and TUNEL positivity in proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA)-positive cells. The agonist mediated increase in membrane expression of protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) seen with wt-hSSTR3 was diminished in C-tail mutants, which was accompanied with the loss of receptor's ability to induce apoptosis. Taken together, our data provide new insights into C-tail-dependent regulation of cell signaling and apoptosis by hSSTR3.
The BBSome is a complex of Bardet-Biedl Syndrome (BBS) proteins that shares common structural elements with COPI, COPII, and clathrin coats. Here, we show that the BBSome constitutes a coat complex that sorts membrane proteins to primary cilia. The BBSome is the major effector of the Arf-like GTPase Arl6/BBS3, and the BBSome and GTP-bound Arl6 colocalize at ciliary punctae in an interdependent manner. Strikingly, Arl6(GTP)-mediated recruitment of the BBSome to synthetic liposomes produces distinct patches of polymerized coat apposed onto the lipid bilayer. Finally, the ciliary targeting signal of somatostatin receptor 3 needs to be directly recognized by the BBSome in order to mediate targeting of membrane proteins to cilia. Thus, we propose that trafficking of BBSome cargoes to cilia entails the coupling of BBSome coat polymerization to the recognition of sorting signals by the BBSome.
Pharmacological studies have suggested the existence of ATP-sensitive K(+) (K(ATP)) channel as a therapeutic target in urinary bladders; however, electrical properties have not yet been shown. Patch-clamp techniques were applied to investigate the properties of K(ATP) channels in pig detrusor cells. In whole-cell configuration, levcromakalim, a K(ATP) channel opener, induced a long-lasting outward current in a concentration-dependent manner. The current-voltage curve of the levcromakalim-induced membrane current intersected at approximately -80 mV. This current was abolished by glibenclamide. Intracellular application of 0.1 mM GDP significantly enhanced the levcromakalim-induced membrane current, whereas cAMP did not. Furthermore, neurotransmitters related to cAMP signaling, such as calcitonin gene-related peptide, vasointestinal peptide, adenosine, and somatostatin, had little effect on the membrane current. In cell-attached configuration, levcromakalim activated K(+) channels with a unitary conductance of approximately 12 pS. When the patch configuration was changed to inside-out mode, the K(+) channel activity ran down. Subsequent application of 1 mM GDP reactivated the channels. The openings of the approximately 12 pS K(+) channels in the presence of 1 mM GDP was suppressed by ATP and glibenclamide. In reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, K(+) channel pore 6.1 and sulfonylurea receptor (SUR)2A were predominant in pig detrusor cells. The 12 pS K(+) channel activated by levcromakalim in pig detrusor smooth muscle cells is a K(ATP) channel. The predominant expression of SUR2A can account for the lack of effect of neurotransmitters related to cAMP.
Surgery is the primary therapy for pheochromocytoma (PHEO), a catecholamine-producing tumor. Benign and malignant PHEO could develop recurrences, and the intraoperative risk of recurrent PHEO is an important unresolved issue. Non-surgical treatments of PHEO recurrence would therefore better prepare patients for reintervention as well as provide them with palliative management. We investigated the effects of the new somatostatin analog (pasireotide) SOM230 versus octreotide (OCT) in primary PHEO cell cultures (Pheo-c). Pheo-c from six benign surgical samples were set up and characterized by immunocytochemistry. Real-time PCR, using both PHEO tissues and Pheo-c, showed different levels of somatostatin receptor(1-5) mRNA expression. Cells treated with various doses of OCT or SOM230 for 48 and 72 h were analyzed to assess their effects on cell proliferation and apoptosis and catecholamine levels. Even if reduction of cell viability was observed in Pheo-c treated for 48 h with either OCT or SOM230 and this effect increased after 72 h, a more significant inhibition of cell growth as well as a significantly higher induction of apoptosis was seen in Pheo-c treated with SOM230 versus OCT. In particular, apoptosis in Pheo-c was detected after 48 h and was associated with increased expression and activation of caspase-3 and cleaved poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase. OCT 10(-6) M and SOM230 10(-7) M significantly reduced catecholamine levels. Our results indicate that while both OCT and SOM230 modulate cell growth and apoptosis and catecholamine levels in Pheo-c through specific receptors, SOM230 is more effective. This improves our knowledge on the mechanism of SOM230 action in PHEO and supports a possible therapeutic use in benign PHEO recurrence.
It was early proposed that somatostatin-producing delta-cells in pancreatic islets have local inhibitory effects on the release of insulin and glucagon. Recent observations that pulses of insulin and glucagon are antisynchronous make it important to examine the temporal characteristics of glucose-induced somatostatin release. Analysis of 30 s fractions from the perfused rat pancreas indicated that increase of glucose from 3 to 20 mmol/l results in initial suppression of somatostatin release followed by regular 4-5 min pulses. During continued exposure to 20 mmol/l glucose, the pulses of somatostatin overlapped those of insulin with a delay of 30 s. Somatostatin and glucagon pulses were coupled in antisynchronous fashion (phase shift 2.4+/-0.2 min), supporting the idea that the delta-cells have a local inhibitory effect on glucagon release. It was possible to remove the pulses of somatostatin and glucagon with maintenance of the insulin rhythmicity by addition of 1 micromol/l of the P2Y(1) receptor antagonist MRS 2179.
Somatostatin (SS) is a peptide hormone that inhibits insulin secretion in beta-cells by activating its G(i/o)-coupled receptors. Our previous work indicated that a betagamma-dimer of G(i/o) coupled to SS receptors can activate phospholipase D1 (PLD1) (Cheng, H., Grodnitzky, J. A., Yibchok-anun, S., Ding, J., and Hsu, W. H. (2005) Mol. Pharmacol. 67, 2162-2172). The aim of the present study was to elucidate the mechanisms underlying SS-induced PLD activation. We demonstrated the presence of ADP-ribosylation factor Arf1 and Arf6 in clonal beta-cells, HIT-T15. We also determined that the activation of PLD1 was mediated through Arf6. Overexpression of dominant-negative (dn) Arf6 mutant, Arf6(T27N), and suppression of mRNA levels using siRNA, both abolished SS-induced PLD activation, while overexpression of wild type Arf6 further enhanced this PLD activation. In contrast, overexpression of dn-Arf1 mutant Arf1(T31N) or dn-Arf5 mutant Arf5(T31N) failed to reduce SS-induced PLD activation. These findings suggested that Arf6, but not Arf1 or Arf5, mediates the effect of SS. We further determined the involvement of the Arf6 guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) EFA6A, a GEF previously thought to be found predominantly in the brain, in the activation of PLD1 in HIT-T15 cells. Using Northern and Western blot analyses, both mRNA and protein of EFA6A were found in these cells. Overexpression of dn-EFA6A mutant, EFA6A(E242K), and suppression of mRNA levels using siRNA, both abolished SS-induced PLD activation, whereas overexpression of dn-EFA6B mutant, EFA6B(E651K), failed to reduce SS-induced PLD activation. In addition, overexpression of dn-ARNO mutant, ARNO(E156K), another GEF of Arf6, had no effect on SS-induced activation of PLD. Taken together, these results suggest that SS signals through EFA6A to activate Arf6-PLD cascade.
There has been an exponential growth in the development of radiolabeled peptides for diagnostic and therapeutic applications in the last decade. The automated means of synthesizing these compounds in large quantities and the simplified methods of purifying, characterizing, and optimizing them have kindled attention to peptides as carrier molecules. These new techniques have accelerated the commercial development of radiolabelled peptides, which has provided additional radiopharmaceuticals for the nuclear medicine community. Peptides have many key properties including fast clearance, rapid tissue penetration, and low antigenicity, and can be produced easily and inexpensively. However, there may be problems with in vivo catabolism, unwanted physiologic effects, and chelate attachment. Radiolabeled peptides have made their greatest impact in the management of relatively rare neuroendocrine malignancies. Indeed, Indium-111 ((111)In)-pentetreotide ((111)In-DTPA-octreotide, Octreoscan), which binds to somatostatin receptors (SSTRs), has become the diagnostic 'gold standard' in these diseases. However, (111)In-pentetreotide has been less successful in the diagnosis of other more prevalent diseases in which SSTRs are upregulated. Technetium-99m (99mTc)-depreotide (NeoTect), a 99mTc-labeled SSTR-analog, could have wider impact since it has high sensitivity and specificity for lung cancer lesion detection. However, this impact may be minimized by the increased availability of positron emission tomography imaging with Fluorine-18 (18F)-flourodeoxyglucose, which has similar sensitivity and specificity for lesion identification in this disease, and is currently more widely used. The receptors for bombesin, alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone, neurotensin, and the integrin alpha(v)beta3, are under active investigation as targets for radiolabelled peptides, but are still in the pre-clinical stage. Compounds directed at the cholecystokinin-B/gastrin receptor have shown promising results in clinical trials in humans. Radiolabelled peptide therapy is usually indicated for patients with widespread disease that is not amenable to focused radiation therapy or is refractory to chemotherapy. Phase I/II studies using various radiolabelled peptides (including (111)In-pentetreotide, Yttrium-90 [90Y]-DOTA-Phe1-Tyr3-octreotide, 90Y-DOTA-lanreotide, and Lutetium-177 [177Lu]-DOTA-octreotate) for the treatment of patients with neuroendocrine malignancy are in progress. Over 400 patients have been treated, and the response rate has ranged from 60% to 75%, although few patients have had a complete response. Patients have been given individual doses ranging from 2 to 11 GBq with a slow infusion every 4-8 weeks (up to 12 times). The kidney is the dose-limiting organ and most patients experience a transient decline in blood cell counts. A concomitant infusion of an amino acid mixture can reduce kidney toxicity and increase the effective tumor dose. Other peptides currently under investigation, some of which have shown promising results, include Rhenium-188 (188Re)-P2045 and 90Y-alpha(v)beta3 antagonist.
The role of external ATP for intercellular communication was studied in glucose-stimulated pancreatic beta-cells isolated from ob/ob mice. Digital image analyses with fura-2 revealed spontaneous transients of cytoplasmic Ca2+ appearing in synchrony in the absence of cell contacts. After removal of slow oscillations with methoxyverapamil, addition of ATP (0.1-100 microM) resulted in prompt firing of a transient, followed by suppression of the generation and synchronization of spontaneously occurring transients. It was possible to trigger transients during the suppressive phase by raising the concentration of ATP. The dual action of ATP was mimicked by ADP or 2-methylthio-ATP but not by AMP or UTP. The number of spontaneous transients and their synchronization were reduced in the presence of the dephosphorylating agent apyrase. Additional evidence that intermittent release of ATP participates in the generation of spontaneous Ca2+ transients was obtained from the suppression observed from use of antagonists of the purinoceptors [suramin (0.3-30 microM), pyridoxalphosphate-6-azophenyl-2,4-disulfonic acid (PPADS; 10-30 microM) and 2-deoxy-N-methyladenosine (MRS 2179; 0.3-30 microM)] or from counteracting beta-cell release of ATP by inhibiting exocytosis with 100 nM epinephrine, 100 nM somatostatin, or lowering the temperature below 30 degrees C. The data indicate that ATP has time-dependent actions (prompt stimulation followed by inhibition) on the generation of Ca2+ transients mediated by P2Y receptors. It is proposed that beta-cells both receive a neural ATP signal with coordinating effects on their Ca2+ oscillations and propagate this message to adjacent cells via intermittent release of ATP combined with gap junction coupling.
Mechanical activation of the mucosal lining of the colon by brush stroking elicits an intestinal neural reflex and an increase in short circuit current (Isc) indicative of electrogenic chloride ion transport. We tested whether endogenous nucleotides are physiologic regulators of mucosal reflexes that control ion transport. The brush stroking-evoked Isc response in mucosa and submucosa preparations (M-SMP) of rat colon was reduced by the P2Y1 receptor (R) antagonist 2'deoxy-N6-methyl adenosine 3',5'-diphosphate diammonium salt (MRS 2179) and further blocked by tetrodotoxin (TTX). M-SMP Isc responses to serosal application of the P2Y1 R agonist 2-methylthioadenosine-diphosphate (2MeSADP) or the P2Y2/P2Y4 R agonist 5'uridine-triphosphate (UTP) were reduced but not abolished by TTX. The potency profile of nucleotides for increasing Isc was 5'adenosine-triphosphate (ATP; effective concentration at half maximal response [EC50] 0.65 x 10(4) M) congruent with UTP (EC50 1.0 x 10(-4) M) congruent with 2MeSADP (EC50 = 1.60 x 10(-4) M). Mucosal touch and distention-induced Ca2+ transients in submucous neurons were reduced by apyrase and prevented by blocking the P2Y1 R with MRS 2179 and TTX; denervation of the mucosa. It did not occur by touching a ganglion directly. 2MeSADP Ca2+ responses occurred in subsets of neurons with or without substance P (SP) responses. The potency profile of nucleotides on the neural Ca2+ response was 2MeSADP (5 x 10(-7) M) &gt; UTP (6 x 10(-6) M) &gt; ATP (9 x 10(-5) M). The expression of P2Y R immunoreactivity (ir) in nerve cell bodies was in the order of P2Y1 R &gt; P2Y4 R &gt; P2Y2 R. P2Y1R ir occurred in the cell somas of more than 90% of neuronal nitric oxide synthase, vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), calretinin, or neuropeptide Y (NPY)-ir neurons, 78% of somatostatin neurons, but not in calbindin or SP neurons. P2Y2 R ir was expressed in a minority of SP, VIP, NPY, vesicular acetylcholine transporter, and calcitonin gene-related peptide-ir varicose fibers (5-20%) and those surrounding calbindin (5-20%) neurons. P2Y4 ir occurred mainly in the cell somas of 93% of NPY neurons. Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction of the submucosa demonstrated mRNA for P2Y1R, P2Y2, P2Y4, P2Y6, and P2Y12 Rs. Expression of P2Y1, P2Y2, and P2Y4 protein was confirmed by western blots. In conclusion, endogenous nucleotides acting at P2YRs transduce mechanically evoked reflex chloride ion transport in rat distal colon. Nucleotides evoke reflexes by acting primarily at postsynaptic P2Y1 Rs and P2Y4 R on VIP+/NPY+ secretomotor neurons, at P2Y2 Rs on no more than 2% of VIP+ secretomotor neurons, and 2Y2 Rs mainly of extrinsic varicose fibers surrounding putative intrinsic primary afferent and secretomotor neurons. During mucosal mechanical reflexes, it is postulated that P2Y1 R, P2Y2 R, and P2Y4 R are activated by endogenous ATP, UTP, and 5'uridine-diphosphate.
K cells are a subpopulation of enteroendocrine cells that secrete glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP), a hormone that promotes glucose homeostasis and obesity. Therefore, it is important to understand how GIP secretion is regulated. GIP-producing (GIP/Ins) cell lines secreted hormones in response to many GIP secretagogues except glucose. In contrast, glyceraldehyde and methyl pyruvate stimulated hormone release. Measurements of intracellular glucose 6-phosphate, fructose 1,6-bisphosphate, and pyruvate levels, as well as glycolytic flux, in glucose-stimulated GIP/Ins cells indicated that glycolysis was not impaired. Analogous results were obtained using glucose-responsive MIN6 insulinoma cells. Citrate levels increased similarly in glucose-treated MIN6 and GIP/Ins cells. Thus pyruvate entered the tricarboxylic acid cycle. Glucose and methyl pyruvate stimulated 1.4- and 1.6-fold increases, respectively, in the ATP-to-ADP ratio in GIP/Ins cells. Glyceraldehyde profoundly reduced, rather than increased, ATP/ADP. Thus nutrient-regulated secretion is independent of the ATP-dependent potassium (K(ATP)) channel. Antibody staining of mouse intestine demonstrated that enteroendocrine cells producing GIP, glucagon-like peptide-1, CCK, or somatostatin do not express detectable levels of inwardly rectifying potassium (Kir) 6.1 or Kir 6.2, indicating that release of these hormones in vivo may also be K(ATP) channel independent. Conversely, nearly all cells expressing chromogranin A or substance P and approximately 50% of the cells expressing secretin or serotonin exhibited Kir 6.2 staining. Compounds that activate calcium mobilization were potent secretagogues for GIP/Ins cells. Secretion was only partially inhibited by verapamil, suggesting that calcium mobilization from intracellular and extracellular sources, independent from K(ATP) channels, regulates secretion from some, but not all, subpopulations of enteroendocrine cells.
The antiproliferative effect of a synthetic octapeptide, somatostatin analogue SMS 201-995 (SMS), and its capacity to bind were evaluated on human peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) activated by phytohemoagglutinin (PHA). We then addressed our work to investigate if SMS inhibits PHA activation of PBL by a cytostatic rather than a cytotoxic mechanism. Consequently, we studied the cell cycle distribution and the activation of caspase-3, measuring the presence of the cleavage product of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerases (PARP), and we evaluated the presence of apoptotic DNA by using a monoclonal antibody specific for the single-stranded regions of DNA. All our results indicate that SMS induces apoptosis in activated lymphocytes.
There has been an exponential growth in the development of radiolabeled peptides for diagnostic and therapeutic applications in oncology. Peptides have fast clearance, rapid tissue penetration, low antigenicity and can be produced easily and inexpensively. However, peptides have problems with in vivo catabolism, unwanted physiological effects, and chelate attachment. The approved 111In-DTPA-OctreoScan, a somatostatin receptor binder, is well established for diagnosis of neuroendocrine tumors. NeoTect, an approved, 99mTc-labeled, somatostatin-receptor-binding analogue has good specificity for lung cancer detection. The receptors for Vasoactive Intestinal Peptide, Cholecystokinin-B/gastrin, Bombesin, Epidermal Growth Factor, and Alpha Melanocyte Stimulating Hormone and the Integrin, alpha(v)beta(3), are under active investigation as targets. Octreotide and its analogues labeled with 111In, 90Y, 64Cu or 177Lu are under study for the treatment of patients with promising results.
Our previous studies conducted in pancreatic cancer models established in nude mice and hamsters revealed that cloned somatostatin receptor subtype 2 (sst2) gene expression induced both antioncogenic and local antitumor bystander effects in vivo. In the present study, in vivo gene transfer of sst2 was investigated in two transplantable models of primary and metastatic pancreatic carcinoma developed in hamsters. LacZ reporter or mouse sst2 genes were expressed by means of two different delivery agents: an adenoviral vector and a synthetic polycationic carrier [linear polyethylenimine (PEI)]. sst2 was injected into either exponentially growing pancreatic primary tumors or hepatic metastases, and then transgene expression and tumor progression were investigated 5-6 days after gene transfer. Molecular mechanisms involved in the inhibition of tumor growth were also analyzed. Both adenovirus- and PEI-mediated in vivo gene transfer in primary pancreatic tumors induced an increase of beta-galactosidase activity and expression of sst2 transgene nRNA (100% and 86% of tumors for adenovirus and PEI vector, respectively). Adenoviral vector-based sst2 gene transfer resulted in significant reduction of pancreatic tumor growth (P &lt; 0.05). Using PEI vector, both pancreatic primary tumor growth and metastatic tumor growth were also significantly slackened as compared with both LacZ-treated and untreated control groups (P &lt; 0.02). Moreover, the proliferative index decreased significantly (P &lt; 0.005), whereas apoptosis increased (P &lt; 0.005) in tumors transferred with sst2 gene. The increase of apoptosis correlated with an activation of the caspase-3 and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase pathways. We concluded that in both primary and metastatic pancreatic cancer models, the synthetic gene delivery system can achieve in vivo sst2 gene transfer and results in a significant antitumor effect characterized by an increase of apoptosis and an inhibition of cell proliferation. This new strategy of gene therapy allows the restoration of expression of an antioncogenic molecule and could be promising for the treatment of advanced pancreatic cancer.
Neuroendocrine neoplasms (NEN) are rare neoplasms that originate from neuroendocrine cells and are characterized by the potential of hormonal activity. Approximately 70% of these tumours are located in the gastrointestinal system (GI), followed by the bronchi, endocrine glands-like C cells of the thyroid (medullary carcinoma), the parasympathetic and sympathetic system (paragangliomas, pheochromocytoma) and other very rare locations. The prevalence of cerebral metastases in neuroendocrine tumours is estimated by various authors to be approximately 1.5-5%. When the primary tumour is located in the pancreas, it is associated with a risk of cerebral metastases lower than 2%.
We describe a patient with a disseminated pancreatic NEN that presented with an isolated lesion in the brain. We gathered the important data via medical history,, observation, analysis of medical records, imaging and others diagnostic tests. Despite the fairly rare prevalence of cerebral metastases in NENs, a neurological work-up should be performed. This should include neuroimaging of the brain, preferably with MR, together with the somatostatin receptor scintigraphy (SRS), in each clinically suspicious case. A histopathological examination of the CNS tumour can confirm a dedifferentiation of NEN in the direction of a neuroendocrine carcinoma (NEC - neuroednocrine carcinoma) with a poor prognosis.
Cerebral metastases are diagnosed in 1.5-5% of patients with a neuroendocrine neoplasm. In each case suggestive of a dissemination into the central nervous system, MRI of the brain should be performed.
The non-invasive diagnosis of endometriosis remains challenging. Recent data suggested that somatostatin might be involved in its pathogenesis. High sensitive visualization of somatostatin receptors expression is possible using PET-CT imaging after the administration of a (68)Ga-labeled somatostatin analog (DOTATATE) that will bind to the somatostatin receptor sub-types 2 and 5. The aim of the present study was to assess the usefulness of (68)Ga-DOTATATE PET-CT in the diagnosis of endometriosis.
This is a prospective, single center pilot study. A pre operative (68)Ga-DOTATATE PET-CT was performed in all of the patients who presented with suspected endometriosis and who were scheduled for a laparoscopy. Surgical endometriosis staging and histopathological analysis, including somatostatin receptors SST1, 2 and 5 immunohistochemistry (IHC) of removed specimens, were confronted to the results of the (68)Ga-DOTATATE PET-CT.
12 patients were included in this study. (68)Ga-DOTATATE PET-CT performed pre operatively showed increased pathologic uptake in four patients with a deep infiltrating endometriosis (DIE) recto-vaginal lesion and in another patient with an adenomyoma. Expression of SST1, 2 and 5 receptors in surgical specimens was confirmed by IHC in these five lesions. Neither superficial peritoneal endometriosis, nor ovarian endometrioma were found to show an increased pathologic uptake on (68)Ga-DOTATATE PET-CT. IHC analysis confirmed that SST1, 2, and 5 receptors were not present in these lesions.
The results observed in this small size series of patients seem to confirm expression of somatostatin receptors only in recto-vaginal DIE and focal adenomyosis lesions. The usefulness of (68)Ga-DOTATATE PET-CT in the diagnosis of this entity is uncertain. Future research should concentrate on studying the role of somatostatin in the pathogenesis of DIE.
The pathogenesis of pituitary adenomas (PA) is complex. Ki-67, pituitary tumour transforming gene (PTTG), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), cyclin D1, c-MYC and pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating peptide (PACAP) protein expression were analysed and correlated with tumour and patient characteristics.
74 pituitary tumour samples (48 non-functional PA, 26 functional PAs); Immunohistochemical analysis of protein expression, retrospective analysis of MR images and in vitro analysis of octreotide treatment was carried out on GH3 cells.
PTTG expression was negatively associated with age and positively with PA size, regrowth and Ki-67 index. Cyclin D1 correlated with Ki-67 and tumour size. c-MYC negatively correlated with size of tumour and age; and correlated with PTTG expression. Somatostatin analogue treatment was associated with lower Ki-67, PTTG and Cyclin D1 expression while T2 hypointense PAs were associated with lower PTTG, cyclin D1, c-MYC and Ki-67. In vitro analyses confirmed the effect of somatostatin analogue treatment on Pttg and Cyclin D1 expression.
Interesting and novel observations on the differences in expression of tumour markers studied are reported. Correlation between Ki-67 expression, PTTG nuclear expression and recurrence/regrowth of PAs, emphasizes the role that Ki-67 and PTTG expression have as markers of increased proliferation. c-MYC and PTTG nuclear expression levels were correlated providing evidence that PTTG induces c-MYC expression in PAs and we propose that c-MYC might principally have a role in early pituitary tumorigenesis. Evidence is shown that the anti-proliferative effect of somatostatin analogue treatment in vivo occurs through regulation of the cell cycle.
The majority of tumor-induced osteomalacia cases have been reported in the Northern Hemisphere and Asia. In this first series of South American patients, we show that the clinical presentation and sensitivity of plasmatic fibroblast growth factor 23 and somatostatin analog-based imaging are similar to those described in other populations.
Describe the experience of clinical presentation, diagnostic study, and treatment of patients with tumor-induced osteomalacia (TIO) in a South American academic center in comparison to literature.
Analysis of the records of patients diagnosed with TIO. The clinical presentation, diagnostic studies, and treatment were analyzed. Fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) was measured by ELISA.
Six patients were diagnosed with TIO during the studied period. The patients' median age was 53 years (range 22-64). All patients presented with weakness and pain in the extremities. Four experienced fractures during their evolution. The median time to diagnosis was 4.5 years (1-20). Biochemical studies showed hypophosphatemia, median of 1.4 mg/dL (1.2-1.6), with low maximum rates of tubular reabsorption of phosphate adjusted for glomerular filtration rate. FGF23 was elevated in 4/6 patients and inappropriately normal in the other two. In three patients, the location of the tumor was clinically evident and confirmed with anatomical imaging. In the remaining patients, two tumors were located with (68)Ga DOTATATE-PET/CT and one with OctreoScan. The causal tumors were located in the lower extremities in five patients and invading the frontal sinus in one patient. In all patients, tumors were successfully removed. Within 14 days, there was normalization of phosphate and FGF23 levels and resolution of clinical symptoms in all patients. In all cases, the histopathology was compatible with a phosphaturic mesenchymal tumor.
The clinical presentation, delay time to diagnosis, FGF23 diagnostic sensitivity and histopathology in this first series of South American patients is similar to those described in other populations. The success of localization by somatostatin analog-based imaging, suggests this may the optimal imaging modality.
The differential diagnosis between meningioma and others tumors can be challenging. This study aimed to evaluate different immunohistochemical markers for the differential diagnosis between meningioma and their morphological mimics. Immunohistochemistry was performed on tissue microarray with antiepithelial membrane antigen (EMA), progesterone receptor, somatostatin receptor 2A (SSTR2A), CD34, STAT6, S100, SOX10, HMB45, MelanA, GFAP, inhibin, and BCL2 antibodies. One hundred and twenty-seven meningiomas, 26 solitary fibrous tumor/hemangiopericytomas (SFT/HPC), 39 schwannomas, 17 hemangioblastomas, 21 melanomas, 9 gliosarcomas, 5 neurofibromas, 9 peripheral primitive neuroectodermal tumors, 7 synovial sarcomas, and 5 malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors were included in the microarray. SSTR2A was the most sensitive (95.2%) and specific (92%) marker of meningiomas. In combination, SSTR2A and/or EMA positivity reached maximal sensitivity (100%). Coexpression of SSTR2A and EMA was the most specific (94.8%) for the diagnosis of meningioma, regardless of the grade or subtype, with the exception of the differential diagnosis with synovial sarcoma. All synovial sarcomas were EMA-positive and 6/7 SSTR2A-positive. STAT6 showed optimum sensitivity and specificity (100%) for SFT/HPC. SOX10 was the most sensitive (94.3%) and specific (100%) marker to discriminate meningiomas from schwannomas. In conclusion, SSTR2A, STAT6, and SOX10 were the most sensitive and specific markers to distinguish meningiomas from their morphological mimics.
To prepare and validate the efficacy of a novel targeted drug delivery system - octreotide (Oct)-modified oleanolic acid (OA) liposomes.
OA liposomes (OA-L) were prepared by an ethanol injection method. The Oct-modified OA liposomes (O-OA-L) were synthesized and their properties were evaluated. Cellular uptake and competition inhibition studies were performed.
The OA vesicles presented satisfactory particles size (100-200 nm), stability and drug release characteristics; their ζ potential was -1.42 ± 0.08 mV. The O-OA-L had a higher cell proliferation inhibitory activity and cellular uptake than that of OA-L for somatostatin receptor-positive A549 cells.
The O-OA-L, as a promising agent, can target actively the lesion site with safe and high-efficiency pattern.
Higher-order thalamic nuclei, such as the posterior medial nucleus (POm) in the somatosensory system or the pulvinar in the visual system, densely innervate the cortex and can influence perception and plasticity. To systematically evaluate how higher-order thalamic nuclei can drive cortical circuits, we investigated cell-type selective responses to POm stimulation in mouse primary somatosensory (barrel) cortex, using genetically targeted whole-cell recordings in acute brain slices. We find that ChR2-evoked thalamic input selectively targets specific cell types in the neocortex, revealing layer-specific modules for the summation and processing of POm input. Evoked activity in pyramidal neurons from deep layers is fast and synchronized by rapid feedforward inhibition from GABAergic parvalbumin-expressing neurons, and activity in superficial layers is weaker and prolonged, facilitated by slow inhibition from GABAergic neurons expressing the 5HT3a receptor. Somatostatin-expressing GABAergic neurons do not receive direct input in either layer and their spontaneous activity is suppressed during POm stimulation. This novel pattern of weak, delayed, thalamus-evoked inhibition in layer 2 suggests a longer integration window for incoming sensory information and may facilitate stimulus detection and plasticity in superficial pyramidal neurons.
Although Somastostatin (SS) scintigraphy (SRS) has been introduced many years ago, it remains the most diffuse radionuclide diagnostic tool in patients with neuroendocrine tumours (NETs). Being SS receptors (SSTR) expressed in the majority of NETs, radiolabeled SS analogues (SS-A) provide high diagnostic accuracy, mainly in patients with gastro-entero-pancreatic (GEP) tumors. SSTR are the best target for radiotracers used either for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes in NETs due to their presence on the surface of neoplastic cells of clinical interest. 111In-DTPA-octreotide (111In-Pentetreotide, Octreoscan®), may detect either primitive or secondary lesions in presence of a satisfactory lesion/background ratio. The unsatisfactory diagnostic performance of 18F-Fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG), in NETs stimulated the synthesis of more specific positron-emitting tracers and SS-A labeled with 68Gallium (DOTA-peptides) represent actually the best radionuclide procedure for NET imaging. Alternative radiotracers, labelled either with gamma or positron emitters and showing different uptake mechanisms, as 18F-DOPA (Fluorine-18-L-dihydroxyphenylalanine), have also been proposed and clinically utilized. Octreoscan®, despite its limitations, continue to represent the most frequently used method in evaluating the response to treatment and in follow-up of patients with NET, although the better diagnostic accuracy of DOTA-peptides.
A 54-year-old woman presented to our centre with acute abdominal pain and vomiting. Routine blood tests showed severe hypercalcaemia (&gt;4 mmol/L). Serum parathyroid hormone (PTH) was suppressed. CT scan detected a pancreatic mass and some liver lesions, initially suspicious for metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Liver biopsy however revealed the presence of a well-differentiated, grade 1, metastatic neuroendocrine tumour (NET) where prognosis is considerably better. Serum PTHrP was raised, indicating paraneoplastic hypercalcaemia, most likely secondary to the pancreatic NET. Following injection of a short-acting somatostatin analogue octreotide, serum PTHrP levels normalised within 24 hours, causing a rapid drop of serum calcium below the lower limit of normal and an immediate compensatory rise of serum PTH. Ongoing treatment with long-acting somatostatin analogues together with replacement with calcium carbonate, vitamin D3 and once weekly alendronic acid resulted in stable normal adjusted calcium levels over a 3-month follow-up period.
Several studies have demonstrated the antitumor activity of first-generation somatostatin analogs (SSAs), primarily targeting somatostatin receptor (sstr) subtypes 2 and 5, in neuroendocrine tumors (NET). Pasireotide, a second-generation SSA, targets multiple sstr subtypes. We compared the efficacy and safety of pasireotide plus everolimus to everolimus alone in patients with advanced, well-differentiated, progressive pancreatic NET (pNET).
Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive a combination of everolimus (10 mg/d, orally) and pasireotide long-acting release (LAR; 60 mg/28 d, intramuscularly) or everolimus alone (10 mg/d, orally); stratified by prior SSA use, and baseline serum chromogranin A and neuron-specific enolase. The primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS). Secondary end points included overall survival (OS), objective response rate, disease control rate (DCR), and safety. Biomarker response was evaluated in an exploratory analysis.
Of 160 patients enrolled, 79 were randomized to the combination arm and 81 to the everolimus arm. Baseline demographics and disease characteristics were similar between the treatment arms. No significant difference was observed in PFS: 16.8 months in combination arm vs 16.6 months in everolimus arm (hazard ratio, 0.99; 95% confidence interval, 0.64-1.54). Partial responses were observed in 20.3% vs 6.2% of patients in combination arm vs everolimus arm; however, overall DCR was similar (77.2% vs 82.7%, respectively). No significant improvement was observed in median OS. Adverse events were consistent with the known safety profile of both the drugs; Grade 3 or 4 fasting hyperglycemia was seen in 37% vs 11% of patients, respectively.
The addition of pasireotide to everolimus was not associated with the improvement in PFS compared to everolimus alone in this study. Further studies to delineate mechanisms by which SSAs slow tumor growth in NET are warranted.
Neuroendocrine neoplasms are detected very rarely in pregnant women. The following is a case report of carcinoid tumor of the appendix diagnosed in 28 year-old woman at 25th week of gestation. The woman delivered spontaneously a healthy baby at the 38th week of gestation. She did not require adjuvant therapy with somatostatin analogues. The patient remained in remission. There are not established standards of care due to the very rare incidence of carcinoid tumors in pregnancy. A review of the literature related to management and prognosis in such cases was done.
Functional imaging tests (FITs) detecting somatostatin receptors expression (i.e., Somatostatin Receptor Scintigraphy, 68Ga-DOTA-peptide positron emission tomography/computed tomography) have a pivotal role in the diagnosis of neuroendocrine tumors (NETs), while their indication during follow-up still needs to be clarified.
Investigate the role of FITs after diagnosis of metastatic enteropancreatic NETs, identifying patients who might benefit from these exams.
Multicenter retrospective analysis of metastatic enteropancreatic NETs.
Analysis of imaging tests performed between January 1995 and December 2015 in Rome, Berlin, Milan, Marburg or Graz.
One hundred and forty-three patients with metastatic pancreatic (pNETs) and small intestine NETs (siNETs), at least 2-year follow-up and positive FITs.
Patients had received CT every 6 months (unless clinical conditions and tumor behavior required shorter intervals) and FIT every 12 months.
FITs' clinical usefulness, defined as changes in patient management (indication to biopsy, medical therapy, surgery or further imaging tests) due only to FITs.
FITs affected management in 73.4% of patients, mostly if G2 vs. G1 (OR: 2.40, 95% CI: 1.09 -5.27, P = 0.03). Changes were observed in a 12-month time frame especially with pNETs vs. siNETs (OR: 2.89, 95% CI: 1.09 - 7.67, P = 0.03) or metastases since diagnosis vs. developed during follow-up (OR: 4.00, 95% CI: 1.43 - 11.17, P &lt; 0.01).
FITs used in addition to CT in the follow-up of stage IV enteropancreatic NETs improve patient management (especially for G2 tumors). Follow-up program should be tailored according to tumor features.
First-generation somatostatin analogs (SSAs), such as octreotide (OCT), are the first line medical therapy for acromegaly. Pasireotide (PAS), a newly developed SSA, has shown promising results in the treatment of acromegaly.
To compare the anti-secretory effect of OCT and PAS in primary cultures of GH-secreting pituitary adenomas (GH-omas). To correlate responses with the adenoma somatostatin receptor (SSTR) profile.
The effect of OCT and PAS on GH (and PRL) secretion was tested in 33 GH-oma primary cultures. SSTR expression was evaluated in adenoma samples.
Acromegaly patients referred to the Erasmus Medical Center (Rotterdam, The Netherlands).
Treatment with OCT and PAS for 72h (10nM).
GH (and PRL) concentrations in cell culture media. SSTR expression in adenoma samples.
The overall effect of OCT and PAS on GH secretion was superimposable (-36.8 % ± 16.2 and -37.1 % ± 15.7, respectively). We identified three adenoma groups: PAS+ (PAS more effective than OCT), n=6; PAS=OCT, n=22 and OCT+ (OCT more effective), n=5. PAS+ adenomas showed lower sst2 mRNA and sst2/sst5 mRNA ratio, compared to the other groups (p=0.02 and p=0.008, respectively). PAS was more potent than OCT in inhibiting PRL hyper-secretion, when present (p=0.003).
Overall, OCT and PAS equally reduced GH secretion in vitro. Adenomas with lower sst2 mRNA expression and a lower sst2/sst5 mRNA ratio showed a better response to PAS compared to OCT (6/33, 18%). SSTR evaluation in GH-omas may become a tool for tailored SSA treatment in acromegaly patients.
Zollinger-Ellison syndrome (ZES) is a rare clinical disorder, characterized by hypersecretion of gastric acid and multiple ulcers distal to the duodenal bulb. This occurs via the release of gastrin by neuroendocrine tumors known as gastrinomas. Patients with ZES present with nonspecific GI symptoms, which often leads to a delay in diagnosis. Our patient is a 55-year-old female with chronic abdominal pain, nausea, and diarrhea. She underwent EGD, EUS, MRCP, CT scans, and cholecystectomy, which did not reveal the cause of her symptoms. Repeat EGD showed a cratered ulcer in the second portion of the duodenum, suspicious for ZES. Serum gastrin was initially only moderately elevated while on PPI therapy, but chromogranin A was also elevated. Repeat gastrin level after stopping PPI therapy was 1639 pg/mL. Somatostatin receptor scintigraphy was obtained, which showed two small lesions in the gastrinoma triangle. She subsequently underwent a Whipple pancreaticoduodenectomy and pathology was positive for four microscopic foci of a neuroendocrine tumor. She reported improvement in her symptoms after surgery. This case highlights the need for increased awareness of ZES in patients with unexplained GI complaints and emphasizes the use of multiple modalities in the diagnosis of ZES.
In transplantation, there is a critical need for noninvasive biomarker platforms for monitoring immunologic rejection. We hypothesized that transplanted tissues release donor-specific exosomes into recipient circulation and that the quantitation and profiling of donor intra-exosomal cargoes may constitute a biomarker platform for monitoring rejection. Here, we have tested this hypothesis in a human-into-mouse xenogeneic islet transplant model and validated the concept in clinical settings of islet and renal transplantation. In the xenogeneic model, we quantified islet transplant exosomes in recipient blood over long-term follow-up using anti-HLA antibody, which was detectable only in xenoislet recipients of human islets. Transplant islet exosomes were purified using anti-HLA antibody-conjugated beads, and their cargoes contained the islet endocrine hormone markers insulin, glucagon, and somatostatin. Rejection led to a marked decrease in transplant islet exosome signal along with distinct changes in exosomal microRNA and proteomic profiles prior to appearance of hyperglycemia. In the clinical settings of islet and renal transplantation, donor exosomes with respective tissue specificity for islet β cells and renal epithelial cells were reliably characterized in recipient plasma over follow-up periods of up to 5 years. Collectively, these findings demonstrate the biomarker potential of transplant exosome characterization for providing a noninvasive window into the conditional state of transplant tissue.
Polycystic liver disease (PLD) is characterized by the presence of multiple cholangiocyte-derived hepatic cysts that progressively replace liver tissue. They are classified as an inherited ciliopathy /cholangiopathy as pathology exists at the level of the primary cilia of cholangiocytes. Aberrant expression of the proteins in primary cilia can impair their structures and functions, thereby promoting cystogenesis. Areas covered: This review begins by looking at the epidemiology of PLD and its natural history. It then describes the pathophysiology and corresponding potential treatment strategies for PLD. Expert commentary: Traditionally, therapies for symptomatic PLD have been limited to symptomatic management and surgical interventions. Such techniques are not completely effective, do not alter the natural history of the disease, and are linked with high rate of re-accumulation of cysts. As a result, there has been a push for drugs targeted at abnormal cellular signaling cascades to address deregulated proliferation, cell dedifferentiation, apoptosis and fluid secretion. Currently, the only available drug treatments that halt disease progression and improve quality of life in PLD patients are somatostatin analogues. Numerous pre-clinical studies suggest that targeting components of the signaling pathways that influence cyst development can ameliorate growth of hepatic cysts.
Quality of life (QoL) in patients with acromegaly is reduced irrespective of disease state. The contributions of multifactorial determinants of QoL in several disease stages are presently not well known.
To systematically review predictors of QoL in acromegalic patients.
Main databases were systematically searched using predefined search terms for potentially relevant articles up to January 2017. Inclusion criteria included separate acromegaly cohort, non-hereditary acromegaly, QoL as study parameter with clearly described method of measurement and quantitative results, N ≥ 10 patients, article in English and adult patients only. Data extraction was performed by two independent reviewers; studies were included using the PRISMA flow diagram.
We identified 1,162 studies; 51 studies met the inclusion criteria: 31 cross-sectional observational studies [mean AcroQoL score 62.7 (range 46.6-87.0, n = 1,597)], 9 had a longitudinal component [mean baseline AcroQoL score 61.4 (range 54.3-69.0, n = 386)], and 15 were intervention studies [mean baseline AcroQoL score 58.6 (range 52.2-75.3, n = 521)]. Disease-activity reflected by biochemical control measures yielded mixed, and therefore inconclusive results with respect to their effect on QoL. Addition of pegvisomant to somatostatin analogs and start of lanreotide autogel resulted in improvement in QoL. Data from intervention studies on other treatment modalities were too limited to draw conclusions on the effects of these modalities on QoL. Interestingly, higher BMI and greater degree of depression showed consistently negative associations with QoL. Hypopituitarism was not significantly correlated with QoL in acromegaly.
At present, there is insufficient published data to support that biochemical control, or treatment of acromegaly in general, is associated with improved QoL. Studies with somatostatin receptor ligand treatment, i.e., particularly lanreotide autogel and pegvisomant have shown improved QoL, but consensus on the correlation with biochemical control is missing. Longitudinal studies investigating predictors in treatment-naive patients and their follow-up after therapeutic interventions are lacking but are urgently needed. Other factors, i.e., depression and obesity were identified from cross-sectional cohort studies as consistent factors associated with poor QoL. Perhaps treatment strategies of acromegaly patients should not only focus on normalizing biochemical markers but emphasize improvement of QoL by alternative interventions such as psychosocial or weight lowering interventions.
Objective: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of octreotide long acting release (LAR) vs lanreotide slow release (SR) for the treatment of postoperative acromegalic patients with elevated levels of growth hormone (GH) and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) in China. Methods: A decision tree model was constructed and the treatment impact was projected for one year in Chinese setting. The clinical efficacy measure used was the percentage of patients achieving normalization (control) of either IGF-1 or GH levels. Efficacy of octreotide LAR and lanreotide SR, incidence of comorbidities, impact of acromegaly on health-related quality of life, and drug-related side effects data were obtained from literature. The cost of medication was collected through a chart review from five hospitals in five cities of China. Clinical experts from these hospitals were requested to complete a questionnaire to document the utilization of medical resources, costs of comorbidities, side effects as well as cost of administration. One-way sensitivity analysis was performed to evaluate the robustness of the results. Results: Compared to lanreotied SR group, the percentage of patients achieving normalization of IGF-1 and GH levels of octreotide LAR group were 10% and 9% higher, respectively. When either IGF-1 or GH control were used as the efficacy measure, patients in the octreotide LAR group exhibit less comorbidities and need less continued treatment with a second operation and radiotherapy than those in lanreotide SR group. When IGF-1 was used as efficacy measure, octreotide LAR not only achieved better efficacy but resulted in overall cost-saving, with a total cost savings of ￥ 3 792 per patient for one year, which demonstrated that octreotide LAR was a dominant cost-saving strategy. When GH control was used as the efficacy measure, octreotide LAR achieved a better overall clinical efficacy with a slightly higher total costs (￥ 4 121 higher per patient per year). Sensitivity analysis didn't change the conclusion that octreotide LAR remains dominant over lanreotide SR, indicating the robustness of this model. Conclusion: Octreotide LAR achieved better overall biochemical control compared with lanreotide SR which result in less comorbidity rate, second operation and radiotherapy as well as related costs.

The peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) with (90)Y and (177)Lu is a form of molecular targeted therapy for inoperable or disseminated neuroendocrine tumors (NET).
The aim of the study was to evaluate clinical results and long-term side effects of tandem (90)Y /(177)Lu-DOTATATE therapy in patients with NET. Additionally, we evaluated clinical results with reference to the primary site.
59 patients with disseminated NET were included in the study prospectively. 3-5 cycles of combined 1:1 (90)Y/(177)Lu-DOTATATE (total injected activity 11.1-16.65 GBq) with mixed amino acids for kidney protection were performed.
During a median follow-up of 75.8 months, the PFS was 32.2 months, and the OS was 82 months; 25 patients died. Depending on primary tumor's site, the PFS and the OS for pancreatic NET vs. small bowel, NET vs. large bowel, NET were 30.4 vs. 29.5 vs. 40.3 and 78.9 vs. 58.1 vs. 82.5, respectively. The observed 5-year overall survival was 63%, and a 2-year risk of progression was 39.4%. The following imaging response was observed: CR in 2%, PR in 22%, SD in 65%, and PD in 6% patients. The disease control rate was 89%. The objective response rate was 24%. The PRRT was well tolerated by all patients. One patient (2%) revealed MDS, and one patient (2%) grade 3 nephrotoxicity. No other grade 3 and 4 hematological or renal toxicity was observed.
These results indicated the tandem (90)Y/(177)Lu-DOTATATE therapy for patients with disseminated/inoperable NET as highly effective and safe, considering long-term side effects. In the majority of patients, clinical improvement was observed.
Bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) is the world's most widely distributed vaccine, used against tuberculosis (TB), in cancer immunotherapy, and in autoimmune diseases due to its immunomodulatory properties. To date, the effect of BCG vaccination on antibody responses to host proteins has not been reported. High-content peptide microarrays (HCPM) offer a unique opportunity to gauge specific humoral immune responses.
The sera of BCG-vaccinated healthy adults were tested on a human HCPM platform (4953 randomly selected epitopes of human proteins) to detect specific immunoglobulin gamma (IgG) responses. Samples were obtained at 56, 112, and 252 days after vaccination. Immunohistology was performed on lymph node tissue from patients with TB lymphadenitis. Results were analysed with a combination of existing and novel statistical methods.
IgG recognition of host peptides exhibited a peak at day 56 post BCG vaccination in all study subjects tested, which diminished over time. Primarily, IgG responses exhibited increased reactivity to ion transporters (sodium, calcium channels), cytokine receptors (interleukin 2 receptor β (IL2Rβ), fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1)), other cell surface receptors (inositol, somatostatin, angiopoeitin), ribonucleoprotein, and enzymes (tyrosine kinases, phospholipase) on day 56. There was decreased IgG reactivity to transforming growth factor-beta type 1 receptor (TGFβR1) and, in agreement with the peptide microarray findings, immunohistochemical analysis of TB-infected lymph node samples revealed an overexpression of TGFβR in granulomatous lesions. Moreover, the vesicular monoamine transporter (VMAT2) showed increased reactivity on days 112 and 252, but not on day 56 post-vaccination. IgG to interleukin 4 receptor (IL4R) showed increased reactivity at 112 days post-vaccination, while IgG to IL2Rβ and FGFR1 showed decreased reactivity on days 112 and 252 as compared to day 56 post BCG vaccination.
BCG vaccination modifies the host's immune landscape after 56 days, but this imprint changes over time. This may influence the establishment of immunological memory in BCG-vaccinated individuals.
We propose an innovative strategy of nanoparticle-mediated-peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) employing PLGA-nanoparticles together with anti-β-hCG antibodies that can protect kidneys from radiation damage while simultaneously enhancing its tumor targeting and cytotoxic ability for somatostatin receptor (SSR) positive tumors.
PEG-coated-(177)Lu-DOTATATE-PLGA-nanoparticles (PEG-LuD-NP) were formulated and characterized. In vitro toxicity of these particles was tested on human glioblastoma cell line U87MG over a radiation dose range of 19-78 Gy, using MTT assay and flow cytometry. To further enhance cytotoxicity and test the feasibility of active tumor targeting, apoptosis-inducing anti-β-hCG monoclonal antibodies were employed in vitro, after confirming expression of β-hCG on U87MG. In vivo tumor targeting ability of these particles, in comparison to uncoated particles and un-encapsulated (177)Lu-DOTATATE, was assessed by intravenous administration in tumor-induced wistar rats. Rats were first imaged in a gamma camera followed by euthanasia for organ extraction and counting in gamma counter.
The particles were spherical in shape with mean diameter of 300 nm. Highest cytotoxicity that could be achieved with PEG-LuD-NP, on radio-resistant U87MG cells, was 35.8 % due to complex cellular response triggered by ionizing radiation. Interestingly, synergistic action of antibodies and PEG-LuD-NP doubled the cytotoxicity (80 %). PEG-LuD-NP showed the highest tumor uptake (4.3 ± 0.46 % ID/g) as compared to (177)Lu-DOTATATE (3.5 ± 0.31 %) and uncoated-(177)Lu-DOTATATE-nanoparticles (3.4 ± 0.35 %) in tumor-inoculated wistar rats (p &lt; 0.001). Renal uptake/retention was decreased 3-4 folds with these particles, resulting in the highest tumor-to-kidney ratio (8.58; p &lt; 0.01) while tumor-to-liver and tumor-to-bone ratios were comparable to un-encapsulated-drug.
Nanocarrier-mediated-PRRT is an effective way of targeting SSR positive tumors for enhanced cytoxicity and reduced renal radiation dose associated with conventional PRRT. To our knowledge of literature, this is the first study to establish in vitro and in vivo efficacy profile of nanoparticles in PRRT providing a stepping-stone for undergoing and future research endeavors in the direction of abating associated radiation concerns of radionuclide therapy and may offer a paradigm shift in PRRT strategy.
Cell membrane proteins are involved in a variety of biochemical pathways and therefore constitute important targets for therapy and development of new drugs. Bioanalytical platforms and binding assays using these membrane protein receptors for drug screening or diagnostic require the construction of well-characterized liposome and lipid bilayer arrays that act as support to prevent protein denaturation during biochip processing. Quantification of the protein receptors in the lipid membrane arrays is a key issue in order to produce reproducible and well-characterized chips. Herein, we report a novel immunochemical analytical approach for the quantification of membrane proteins (i.e., G-protein-coupled receptor, GPCR) in nanovesicles (NVs). The procedure allows direct determination of tagged receptors (i.e., c-myc tag) without any previous protein purification or extraction steps. The immunochemical method is based on a microplate ELISA format and quantifies this tag on proteins embedded in NVs with detectability in the picomolar range, using protein bioconjugates as reference standards. The applicability of the method is demonstrated through the quantification of the c-myc-olfactory receptor (OR, c-myc-OR1740) in the cell membrane NVs. The reported method opens the possibility to develop well-characterized drug-screening platforms based on G-coupled proteins embedded on membranes.
The efficacy of systemic antineoplastic therapy on recurrent World Health Organization (WHO) grades II and III meningiomas is unclear.
We performed a retrospective multicenter analysis of serial cranial MRI in patients with recurrent WHO II and III meningiomas treated with antineoplastic systemic therapies. Growth rates for tumor volume and diameter, as well as change rates for edema size, were calculated for all lesions.
We identified a total of 34 patients (23 atypical, 11 anaplastic meningiomas) with a total of 57 meningioma lesions who had been treated at 6 European institutions. Systemic therapies included bevacizumab, cytotoxic chemotherapy, somatostatin analogues, and tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Overall, tumor growth rates decreased during systemic therapy by 51% for tumor diameter and 14% for tumor volume growth rates compared with the period before initiation of systemic therapy. The most pronounced decrease in meningioma growth rates during systemic therapy was evident in patients treated with bevacizumab, with a reduction of 80% in diameter and 59% in volume growth. Furthermore, a decrease in size of peritumoral edema after initiation of systemic therapy was exclusively observed in patients treated with bevacizumab (-107%).
Our data indicate that systemic therapy may inhibit growth of recurrent WHO grades II and III meningiomas to some extent. In our small cohort, bevacizumab had the most pronounced inhibitory effect on tumor growth, as well as some anti-edematous activity. Prospective studies are needed to better define the role of medical therapies in this tumor type.
Gastrointestinal neuroendocrine tumors (NET) frequently present with unresectable hepatic metastases, which poses a barrier for curative treatment. Resection of the primary tumor and subsequent orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) has been proposed as a treatment approach but available data in this regard is limited. We present a clinical case of an otherwise asymptomatic 44-yo man complaining of abdominal pain and dyspepsia that was diagnosed of a 10 cm duodenal tumor with multiple hepatic metastases. A CT-guided biopsy confirmed a NET. He underwent first a Whipple's procedure, and then was listed for liver transplantation. During the waiting time a multimodal therapeutic approach was used including the use of radioactive 177lutetium-labeled somatostatin analogues, long-acting somastostatin analogues and antiangiogenic antibodies (bevacizumab) in order to keep neoplastic disease under control. Two years after Whipple's procedure and given disease stability he underwent OLT with an uneventful postoperative evolution. Patient condition and graft function are optimal after a 4-year follow-up period with no evidence of recurrence. This case report underscores how a multimodal approach involving careful patient selection, resective surgery as well as use of somatostatin analogues and antiangiogenic biological therapy followed by liver transplantation can achieve excellent long-term results in this difficult patient population.
Pancreatic malignancies, the fourth leading cause of cancer deaths, have an aggressive behavior with poor prognosis, resulting in a 5-year survival rate of only 4%. It is typically a silent malignancy until patients develop metastatic disease. Targeted radionuclide therapies of cancer such as radiolabeled peptides, which bind to the receptors overexpressed by cancer cells and radiolabeled antibodies to tumor-specific antigens provide a viable alternative to chemotherapy and external beam radiation of metastatic cancers. Multiple clinical trials of targeted radionuclide therapy of pancreatic cancer have been performed in the last decade and demonstrated safety and potential efficacy of radionuclide therapy for treatment of this formidable disease. Although a lot of progress has been made in treatment of pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors with radiolabeled (90)Y and (177)Lu somatostatin peptide analogs, pancreatic adenocarcinomas remain a major challenge. Novel approaches such as peptides and antibodies radiolabeled with alpha emitters, pre-targeting, bispecific antibodies and biological therapy based on the radioactive tumorlytic bacteria might offer a potential breakthrough in treatment of pancreatic adenocarcinomas.
Intestinal ischemia-reperfusion has been taken as an important pathophysiological process for multiple organ dysfunctions in critical patients. Recent studies reported that dual expression programs of the B cells receptors and Toll-like receptors on B-lymphocytes permit these ubiquitous cells to integrate both adaptive and innate immune functions. Our previous studies found that somatostatin inhibited the intestinal inflammatory injury after ischemia-reperfusion in macaques. However, the changes of B cells and the effects of somatostatin on B cells after intestinal ischemia-reperfusion were unclear.
15 macaques were divided into control, intestinal ischemia-reperfusion and somatostatin pretreatment groups. Immunohistochemistry was performed to identify the distributions of adaptive and innate immunity markers in the iliac mucosa. Hmy2.cir B lymphoblastoid cell line was cultured in vitro study. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to measure IgM, IL-6 and SIgA, and the expressions of B cells transcription factors, PAX-5 and BLIMP-1, were detected by Western blotting.
B2 lymphocytes in normal Peyer's patches were presented the phenotype of PAX-5+CD20+CD5-. Ischemia-reperfusion increased the numbers and sizes of Peyer's patches but with PAX-5+CD20-CD5- B cells, an unmatured set of B cells. Somatostatin partly kept the phenotype of mature B cells during ischemia-reperfusion. The innate immunity of B cells was inhibited whereas the adaptive immunity was increased in the intestinal mucosa in the somatostatin group, compared to the ischemia-reperfusion group. In vitro, somatostatin significantly inhibited IL-6 and promoted IgM by increasing the expression of both PAX-5 and BLIMP-1 in the proinflammatory condition.
Intestinal ischemia-reperfusion resulted in the proliferation of unmatured B cells which were involved in the augmentation of innate immunity. Somatostatin, with a bi-directional regulation function on innate as well as adaptive immunity of B cells, greatly improved B cells mature in macaques during ischemia-reperfusion. Preventive supplements of somatostatin may greatly limit intestinal injury and bacterial translocation during ischemia-reperfusion.
Neuroendocrine neoplasms (NENs) are a group of heterogeneous tumors. The present review discusses current therapeutic strategies for the treatment of gastro-entero-pancreatic NEN. Several systemic options are currently available, including medical systemic chemotherapy, biological drugs, somatostatin analogs and peptide receptor radionuclide therapy. The carcinoid syndrome can be adequately controlled with somatostatin analogs; chemotherapy has shown positive outcomes in poor prognosis patients, and peptide receptor radionuclide therapy is a promising treatment based on the use of radioisotopes for advanced disease expressing somatostatin receptors. Targeted therapies, such as multikinase inhibitors and monoclonal antibodies are also recommended or under evaluation for the treatment of advanced NENs, but some critical issues in clinical practice remain unresolved. Depending upon the development of the disease, a multimodal approach is recommended. The treatment strategy for metastatic patients should be planned by a multidisciplinary team in order to define the optimal sequence of treatments.
This review focuses on nuclear receptors expressed in pancreatic cancer.
An extensive search of articles published up to March 2013 was conducted using the MEDLINE database. The key words used were "pancreatic cancer", "molecular receptors" and "growth factors". A total of 112 articles referred to pancreatic cancer, molecular receptors and/or growth factors were included.
Receptors of growth factors, such as the epithelial growth factor receptor, insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor, vascular endothelial growth factor receptor and others, such as integrin α5β1, somatostatin receptors, the death receptor 5, claudin, notch receptors, mesothelin receptors, follicle-stimulating hormone receptors, the MUC1 receptor, the adrenomedullin receptor, the farnesoid X receptor, the transferrin receptor, sigma-2 receptors, the chemokine receptor CXCR4, the urokinase plasminogen activator receptor, the ephrine A2 receptor, the GRIA3 receptor, the RON receptor and the angiotensin II receptor AT-1 are expressed in pancreatic tumor cells. These molecules are implicated in tumor growth, apoptosis, angiogenesis, metastasis etc.
After identifying the molecular receptors associated with the pancreatic cancer, many more target molecules playing important roles in tumor pathophysiology and senescence-associated signal transduction in cancer cells will be identified. This may have a significant influence on diagnosis, therapy and prognosis of pancreatic cancer.
We have generated a novel monoclonal antibody targeting human FGFR1c (R1c mAb) that caused profound body weight and body fat loss in diet-induced obese mice due to decreased food intake (with energy expenditure unaltered), in turn improving glucose control. R1c mAb also caused weight loss in leptin-deficient ob/ob mice, leptin receptor-mutant db/db mice, and in mice lacking either the melanocortin 4 receptor or the melanin-concentrating hormone receptor 1. In addition, R1c mAb did not change hypothalamic mRNA expression levels of Agrp, Cart, Pomc, Npy, Crh, Mch, or Orexin, suggesting that R1c mAb could cause food intake inhibition and body weight loss via other mechanisms in the brain. Interestingly, peripherally administered R1c mAb accumulated in the median eminence, adjacent arcuate nucleus and in the circumventricular organs where it activated the early response gene c-Fos. As a plausible mechanism and coinciding with the initiation of food intake suppression, R1c mAb induced hypothalamic expression levels of the cytokines Monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 and 3 and ERK1/2 and p70 S6 kinase 1 activation.
Neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) are a group of tumors originating in various locations, including the gastrointestinal tract, lung, and pancreas. Clinical trial design and disease management of these tumors pose a significant challenge because of the heterogeneous clinical presentations and varying degrees of aggressiveness. The recent completion of several phase II and III trials demonstrates that rigorous investigation of novel agents can lead to practice-changing outcomes. Furthermore, the molecular and genetic understanding of NETs has dramatically improved during the last few years; as a result, investigators have shifted clinical trial design to focus on targeted therapies. Most of these trials have targeted the somatostatin, vascular endothelial growth factor, and mammalian target of rapamycin pathways. This review will discuss the NET treatment landscape and trials of targeted agents currently offered.
Diabetes mellitus is one of the most common endocrine disorders in dogs and is commonly proposed to be of autoimmune origin. Although the clinical presentation of human type 1 diabetes (T1D) and canine diabetes are similar, the aetiologies may differ. The aim of this study was to investigate if autoimmune aetiology resembling human T1D is as prevalent in dogs as previously reported.
Sera from 121 diabetic dogs representing 40 different breeds were tested for islet cell antibodies (ICA) and GAD65 autoantibodies (GADA) and compared with sera from 133 healthy dogs. ICA was detected by indirect immunofluorescence using both canine and human frozen sections. GADA was detected by in vitro transcription and translation (ITT) of human and canine GAD65, followed by immune precipitation. Sections of pancreata from five diabetic dogs and two control dogs were examined histopathologically including immunostaining for insulin, glucagon, somatostatin and pancreas polypeptide.
None of the canine sera analysed tested positive for ICA on sections of frozen canine or human ICA pancreas. However, serum from one diabetic dog was weakly positive in the canine GADA assay and serum from one healthy dog was weakly positive in the human GADA assay. Histopathology showed marked degenerative changes in endocrine islets, including vacuolisation and variable loss of immune-staining for insulin. No sign of inflammation was noted.
Contrary to previous observations, based on results from tests for humoral autoreactivity towards islet proteins using four different assays, and histopathological examinations, we do not find any support for an islet autoimmune aetiology in canine diabetes mellitus.
Merkel cell carcinoma is an aggressive neuroendocrine tumor with a high incidence of local recurrence, regional nodal and distant metastasis, and a high mortality rate. It has been linked to a polyomavirus in addition to immune suppression. Traditionally, treatment options have been limited to surgery and radiation therapy. Better understanding of the molecular pathways of infection and carcinogenesis has provided potential molecular targets and potential immunotherapies which are discussed in this review.
This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of an oral DNA vaccine against somatostatin (SS) (pGS/2SS-asd, encoding two copies of somatostatin genes) mediated by attenuated Salmonella choleraesuis C500 without antibiotic resistance gene on piglets growth. A total of 50 piglets were uniformly divided into five groups. The animals in the first three groups were orally given vaccine in dose of either 5 9 1010, 5 9 109 or 5 9 108 colony-forming units (CFU).The remaining two groups were orally administered with either bacteria C500(containing pVAX-asd plasmid without somatostatin gene) or phosphate buffered saline (PBS) as controls. The results indicated that the vaccine induced SS-specific antibodies in a dose-dependent pattern. Compared with the PBS control, animals in the high-dose group showed lower SS levels and higher growth hormone (GH) levels in sera. Average daily gain of animals in the high dose group was increased by 32.88% and 26.46% during 4 and 8 weeks,respectively. Anti-SS antibodies were positively correlated with either GH levels or average daily gain at week 8 after primary immunization (P &lt; 0.05). Faecal,soil and water samples originating from immunized piglets and surrounding environment were collected. The target gene (the fusion gene GS/2SS) of C500(pGS/2SS-asd) was not detected by PCR amplification in these samples,indicating that the surrounding environment was not contaminated by residual recombinant bacteria. In conclusion, the vaccine without antibiotic resistance gene is attributable to improve growth performance of piglets through an influence on GH secretion. Moreover, the immunization did not contaminate the surrounding environment of animals.
We describe here a balanced-lethal system using an Asd(+) expression plasmid pVGS/2SS-asd encoding two copies of somatostatin (SS) genes carried by Δasd/Δcrp double mutant Salmonella enterica serovar Choleraesuis (named C501). The advantage of this novel system is the use of asd (aspartate-semialdehyde dehydrogenase) gene as selection marker to replace the antibiotic resistance markers, thus eliminating the industrial cultivation and environmental problems. We then evaluated the efficacy, biodistribution and safety of antibiotic-free plasmid delivered by strains C501. Mice orally immunized with C501 (pVGS/2SS-asd) had significantly higher levels of anti-SS total IgG and IgA antibodies than control mice and demonstrated a bias toward Th2-associated responses (IgG1/IgG2a ratio&gt;1). Safety evaluation indicated that vaccinated mice displayed no abnormal clinical signs and histological changes. Biodistribution result revealed that the GS/2SS message was detected in several examined tissues with the exception of ovary and brain, but was rapidly cleared from the body (approximately 10 days). Furthermore, the risk of integration of plasmid pVGS/2SS-asd into the host cellular genome was considered to be negligible. These results may have important implications for the use of vaccine strain C501 (pVGS/2SS-asd) in domestic animals and prompt new perspectives on the safety of DNA vaccines delivered by attenuated bacteria.
Tumor-induced hypoglycemia (TIH) is a rare clinical entity that may occur in patients with diverse kinds of tumor lineages and that may be caused by different mechanisms. These pathogenic mechanisms include the eutopic insulin secretion by a pancreatic islet β-cell tumor, and also the ectopic tumor insulin secretion by non-islet-cell tumor, such as bronchial carcinoids and gastrointestinal stromal tumors. Insulinoma is, by far, the most common tumor associated with clinical and biochemical hypoglycemia. Insulinomas are usually single, small, sporadic, and intrapancreatic benign tumors. Only 5-10% of insulinomas are malignant. Insulinoma may be associated with the multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 in 4-6% of patients. Medical therapy with diazoxide or somatostatin analogs has been used to control hypoglycemic symptoms in patients with insulinoma, but only surgical excision by enucleation or partial pancreatectomy is curative. Other mechanisms that may, more uncommonly, account for tumor-associated hypoglycemia without excess insulin secretion are the tumor secretion of peptides capable of causing glucose consumption by different mechanisms. These are the cases of tumors producing IGF2 precursors, IGF1, somatostatin, and glucagon-like peptide 1. Tumor autoimmune hypoglycemia occurs due to the production of insulin by tumor cells or insulin receptor autoantibodies. Lastly, massive tumor burden with glucose consumption, massive tumor liver infiltration, and pituitary or adrenal glands destruction by tumor are other mechanisms for TIH in cases of large and aggressive neoplasias.
The biological actions of somatostatin are mediated by a family of five GPCRs, named sst1 to sst5 . Somatostatin receptors exhibit equally high-binding affinities to their natural ligand somatostatin-14 and largely overlapping distributions. The overexpression of somatostatin receptors in human tumours is the molecular basis for diagnostic and therapeutic application of the stable somatostatin analogues octreotide, lanreotide and pasireotide. The efficiency of somatostatin receptor signalling is tightly regulated and ultimately limited by the coordinated phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of intracellular carboxyl-terminal serine and threonine residues. Here, we review and discuss recent progress in the generation and application of phosphosite-specific antibodies for human sst2 and sst5 receptors. These phosphosite-specific antibodies are unique tools to monitor the spatial and temporal dynamics of receptors phosphorylation and dephosphorylation. Using a combined approach of phosphosite-specific antibodies and siRNA knock-down screening, relevant kinases and phosphatases were identified. Emerging evidence suggests distinct mechanisms of agonist-selective fine-tuning for individual somatostatin receptors. The recently uncovered differences in phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of these receptors may hence be of physiological significance in mediating responses to acute, persistent or repeated stimuli in a variety of target tissues.
Estrogen inhibition is effective in preventing breast cancer in only up to 50% of women with precancerous lesions and many experience side effects that are poorly tolerated. As insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) underlies both estrogen and progesterone actions and has other direct effects on mammary development and carcinogenesis, we hypothesized that IGF-I inhibition might provide a novel approach for breast cancer chemoprevention.
In total, 13 women with core breast biopsies diagnostic of atypical hyperplasia (AH) were treated for 10 days with pasireotide, a somatostatin analog which uniquely inhibits IGF-I action in the mammary gland. They then had excision biopsies. 12 patients also had proliferative lesions and one a ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). Primary outcomes were changes in cell proliferation and apoptosis after treatment. Expression of estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and phosphorylated Insulin-like growth factor I receptor (IGF-1R), protein kinase B (AKT) and extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2 (ERK1/2) were also assessed. Core and excision biopsies from 14 untreated patients served as non-blinded controls. Hyperglycemia and other side effects were carefully monitored.
Pasireotide decreased proliferation and increased apoptosis in all AH (from 3.6 ± 2.6% to 1.3 ± 1.2% and from 0.3 ± 0.2% to 1.5 ± 1.6%, respectively) and proliferative lesions (from 3.8 ± 2.5% to 1.8 ± 1.8% and from 0.3 ± 0.2% to 1.3 ± 0.6%, respectively). The DCIS responded similarly. ER and PR were not affected by pasireotide, while IGF-1R, ERK1/2 and AKT phosphorylation decreased significantly. In contrast, tissue from untreated controls showed no change in cell proliferation or phosphorylation of IGF-1R, AKT or ERK 1/2. Mild to moderate hyperglycemia associated with reduced insulin levels was found. Glucose fell into the normal range after discontinuing treatment. Pasireotide was well tolerated and did not cause symptoms of estrogen deprivation.
IGF-I inhibition by pasireotide, acting through the IGF-1R, was associated with decreased proliferation and increased apoptosis in pre-malignant breast lesions and one DCIS. Assuming hyperglycemia can be controlled, these data suggest that inhibiting the IGF-I pathway may prove an effective alternative for breast cancer chemoprevention.
NCT01372644 Trial date: July 1, 2007.
Although the somatostatin analog octreotide (OCT) has been used for uncontrollable insulinoma, the mechanism involved is still unknown. The aim of this study was to elucidate the therapeutic effect of OCT for insulinoma.
Mouse insulinoma cell line MIN6 cells were cultured with OCT to clarify its antiproliferative effects, the expression of somatostatin receptor subtypes, cell cycle, p27 expression, and cdc2 kinase activity. The changes of the messenger RNA expression profiles were examined by microarray analysis. Intraperitoneal OCT treatment was given to insulinoma model IT6 mice for 4 weeks.
MIN6 cells expressed somatostatin receptor 2A, 3, and 5 under the OCT treatment. Octreotide showed a dose-dependent antiproliferative effect on MIN6 cells but not on the other cell lines. p27 expression and cdc2 kinase activity in MIN6 cells became prominent with OCT treatment. At the messenger RNA level, several molecules in the mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathway were downregulated. The sizes of the individual tumors tended to be smaller in the OCT-treated group. p27 expression was seen in the tumor tissue, but no apoptotic marker was detected.
Octreotide acted through a cytostatic mechanism and could be an effective therapy for insulinoma.
Somatostatin is a peptide with a potent and broad antisecretory action, which makes it an invaluable drug target for the pharmacological management of pituitary adenomas and neuroendocrine tumors. Somatostatin receptors (SSTR1, 2A and B, 3, 4 and 5) belong to the G protein coupled receptor family and have a wide expression pattern in both normal tissues and solid tumors. Investigating the function of each SSTR in several tumor types has provided a wealth of information about the common but also distinct signaling cascades that suppress tumor cell proliferation, survival and angiogenesis. This provided the rationale for developing multireceptor-targeted somatostatin analogs and combination therapies with signaling-targeted agents such as inhibitors of the mammalian (or mechanistic) target of rapamycin (mTOR). The ability of SSTR to internalize and the development of rabiolabeled somatostatin analogs have improved the diagnosis and treatment of neuroendocrine tumors.
The majority of neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) of the gastroenteropancreatic system coexpress somatostatin receptors (SSTRs) and dopamine type 2 receptors (D2R), thus providing a rationale for the use of novel SSTR2/D2R chimeric compounds in NET disease. Here we investigate the antitumor potential of the SSTR2/D2R chimeric compounds BIM-23A760 and BIM-23A758 in comparison to the selective SSTR2 agonist BIM-23023 and the selective D2R agonist BIM-53097 on human NET cell lines of heterogeneous origin. While having only minor effects on human pancreatic and bronchus carcinoid cells (BON1 and NCI-H727), BIM-23A758 induced significant antitumor effects in human midgut carcinoid cells (GOT1). These effects involved apoptosis induction as well as inhibition of mitogen-activated protein kinase and Akt signaling. Consistent with their antitumor response to BIM-23A758, GOT1 cells showed relatively high expression levels of SSTR2 and D2R mRNA. In particular, GOT1 cells highly express the short transcript variant of D2R. In contrast to BIM-23A758, the SSTR2/D2R chimeric compound BIM-23A760 as well as the individual SSTR2 and D2R agonistic compounds BIM-23023 and BIM-53097 induced no or only minor antitumor responses in the examined NET cell lines. Taken together, our findings suggest that the novel SSTR2/D2R chimeric compound BIM-23A758 might be a promising substance for the treatment of NETs highly expressing SSTR2 and D2R. In particular, a sufficient expression of the short transcript variant of DR2 might play a pivotal role for effective treatment.
Proliferation and migration of smooth muscle cells (SMCs) are key steps for the progression of atherosclerosis and restenosis. Cortistatin is a multifunctional neuropeptide belonging to the somatostatin family that exerts unique functions in the nervous and immune systems. Cortistatin is elevated in plasma of patients experiencing coronary heart disease and attenuates vascular calcification.
To investigate the occurrence of vascular cortistatin and its effects on the proliferation and migration of SMCs in vitro and in vivo and to delimitate the receptors and signal transduction pathways governing its actions.
SMCs from mouse carotid and human aortic arteries and from human atherosclerotic plaques highly expressed cortistatin. Cortistatin expression positively correlated with the progression of arterial intima hyperplasia. Cortistatin inhibited platelet-derived growth factor-stimulated proliferation of human aortic SMCs via binding to somatostatin receptors (sst2 and sst5) and ghrelin receptor, induction of cAMP and p38-mitogen-activated protein kinase, and inhibition of Akt activity. Moreover, cortistatin impaired lamellipodia formation and migration of human aortic SMCs toward platelet-derived growth factor by inhibiting, in a ghrelin-receptor-dependent manner, Rac1 activation and cytosolic calcium increases. These effects on SMC proliferation and migration correlated with an inhibitory action of cortistatin on the neointimal formation in 2 models of carotid arterial ligation. Endogenous cortistatin seems to play a critical role in regulating SMC function because cortistatin-deficient mice developed higher neointimal hyperplasic lesions than wild-type mice.
Cortistatin emerges as a natural endogenous regulator of SMCs under pathological conditions and an attractive candidate for the pharmacological management of vascular diseases that course with neointimal lesion formation.
Recently, somatostatin receptors (SSR) have been identified on medulloblastomas and proposed as a new target for chemotherapy including inhibitory somatostatin analogs. Activation of SSRs inhibit growth, in part, by activating phosphatases that dephosphorylate/deactivate growth stimulatory signaling of the MEK1-p44/42 MAPK and PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathways. These SSR-inhibited signaling pathways have not been characterized or correlated with SSR expression in medulloblastomas or primitive neuroectodermal tumors (PNETs), yet may represent additional targets for combined chemotherapy. We evaluated the distribution and extent of SSR1 and SSR2 expression and correlated it with activation of downstream MEK1-p44/42 MAPK and PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathways in medulloblastomas and PNETs. Sections from 22 medulloblastomas and 9 PNETs were compared using immunohistochemistry with monoclonal antibodies to SSR1, SSR2, p44/42 MAPK, phosphorylated p44/42 MAPK, and phosphorylated mTOR. SSR1 was detected in 50% of medulloblastomas, extensive in 46%, and similar in classic, desmoplastic, and large cell/anaplastic subtypes. SSR1 was detected in 78% of PNETs and extensive in the majority. SSR2 was found in 18% of medulloblastomas and 33% of PNETs. Activated/phosphorylated pMAPK 44/42 was detected in 82% of medulloblastomas, all subtypes, and in 62.5% of PNETs with coexpression of SSR1 in one third. Activated/phosphorylated mTOR was found in only 18% of medulloblastomas but in 88% of PNETs. SSR1 coexpression with activated/phosphorylated mTOR was identified in 75% of PNETs. These findings suggest that addition of an mTOR inhibitor may potentiate growth inhibitory effects of SSR agonists in the treatment of PNETs. Immunohistochemical identification of mTOR activation/phosphorylation in biopsies of initial and treatment-resistant PNETs may facilitate development of clinical trials and therapeutic decisions.
The ability to predict recurrence of pituitary adenoma (PA) after surgery may be helpful to determine follow-up frequency and the need for adjuvant treatment. The purpose of this study was to assess the prognostic capacity of pituitary tumor transforming gene (PTTG), insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF1R), and Ki-67.
In this retrospective study, the normalized copy number (NCN) of PTIG and IGF1R mRNA was measured using RT-PCR, and the Ki-67 index was measured by immunohistochemistry in 46 PA samples. Clinical data, histological subtype, and radiographic characteristics were collected to assess associations between variables and tumor behavior. Progression of tumor remnants and its association to markers was also studied in 14 patients with no adjuvant treatment after surgery followed up for 46±36 months.
Extrasellar tumors had a lower PTTG expression as compared to sellar tumors (0.065 [1st-3rd quartile: 0.000-0.089] NCN vs. 0.135 [0.105-0.159] NCN, p=0.04). IGF1R expression changed depending on histological subtype (p=0.014), and was greater in tumor with remnant growth greater than 20% during follow-up (10.69±3.84 NCN vs. 5.44±3.55 NCN, p=0.014).
Our results suggest that the IGF1R is a more helpful molecular marker than PTTG in PA management. Ki-67 showed no association to tumor behavior. However, the potential of these markers should be established in future studies with standardized methods and on larger samples.
Vitamin E plays an essential role in maintaining the structure and function of the nervous system, and its deficiency, commonly associated with fat malabsorption diseases, may reduce neuronal survival. We previously demonstrated that the somatostatinergic system, implicated in neuronal survival control, can be modulated by α-tocopherol in the rat dentate gyrus, increasing cyclic adenosine monophosphate response element binding protein phosphorylation. To gain a better understanding of the molecular actions of tocopherols and examine the link among vitamin E, somatostatin and neuronal survival, we have investigated the effects of a deficiency and subsequent administration of tocopherol on the somatostatin signaling pathway and neuronal survival in the rat hippocampus. No changes in somatostatin expression were detected in vitamin-E-deficient rats. These rats, however, showed a significant increase in the somatostatin receptor density and dissociation constant, which correlated with a significant increase in the protein levels of somatostatin receptors. Nevertheless, vitamin E deficiency impaired the ability of the somatostatin receptors to couple to the effectors adenylyl cyclase and phosphotyrosine phosphatase by diminishing Gi protein functionality. Furthermore, vitamin E deficiency significantly increased phosphotyrosine phosphatase activity and PTPη expression, as well as PKCδ activation, and decreased extracellular-signal-regulated kinase phosphorylation. All these changes were accompanied by an increase in neuronal cell death. Subsequent α-tocopherol administration partially or completely reversed all these values to control levels. Altogether, our results prove the importance of vitamin E homeostasis in the somatostatin receptor-effector system and suggest a possible mechanism by which this vitamin may regulate the neuronal cell survival in the adult hippocampus.
The insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) are bound by specific, high affinity binding proteins. Distinct classes of IGF-binding proteins have been described in human serum, amniotic fluid, cerebrospinal fluid, and conditioned medium from cultured cells. Sheep thyroid cells produce IGF-binding proteins under hormonal regulation. Cells grown without or with standard medium supplements (transferrin, glycyl-histidyl-lysine, hydrocortisone, somatostatin, insulin, and TSH) released binding proteins with apparent mol wt of 23, 29, and 32 kDa on Western ligand blot (nonreduced). Binding proteins from these cells appeared as 21, 26, 34, 36, and 41 kDa bands when cross-linked to [125I]IGF-I under reducing conditions. The addition of epidermal growth factor (EGF) or phorbol esters, thyroid cell mitogens stimulated the production of larger binding proteins with mol wt of 40-44 and 48-52 by ligand blot and cross-linking methods, respectively. Deglycosylation of conditioned medium cross-linked to [125I]IGF-I with endoglycosidase-F did not alter the size of the smaller binding proteins, but reduced EGF-stimulated binding proteins to 36-40 kDa. Similarly, tunicamycin treatment, which inhibits glycosylation, reduced only the size of this larger binding protein species. Polyclonal antisera directed against the human amniotic fluid binding protein (BP-28) immunoprecipitated the 32 kDa sheep thyroid binding protein seen on ligand blot and the cross-linked binding protein at 36-38 kDa. Antibody against the major human serum binding protein (BP-53) recognized only the larger EGF-stimulated binding proteins. In contrast to sheep thyroid cells, rat FRTL5 thyroid cells produced no detectable IGF-binding proteins. We conclude that the predominant binding proteins produced by sheep thyroid cells under standard culture conditions are non-glycosylated and immunoreact with antiserum directed against BP-28. EGF and phorbol esters stimulate production of larger glycosylated binding proteins antigenically related to BP-53.
Of the many serotonin receptors, the type 3 receptors (5-HT3R) are the only ionotropic ones, playing a key role in fast synaptic transmission and cognitive and emotional brain function through controlled neuronal excitation. To better understand the various functions of 5-HT3Rs, it is very important to know their expression pattern in the central nervous system (CNS). To date, many distributional studies have shown localized 5-HT3R expression in the brain and spinal cord. However, an accurate pattern of 5-HT3R expression in the CNS remains to be elucidated. To investigate the distribution of 5-HT3R in the mouse brain in detail, we performed immunofluorescent staining using 5-HT3AR-GFP transgenic mice. We found strong 5-HT3AR expression in the olfactory bulb, cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and amygdala; and partial expression in the pons, medulla, and spinal cord. Meanwhile, the thalamus, hypothalamus, and midbrain exhibited a few 5-HT3AR-expressing cells, and no expression was detected in the cerebellum. Further, double-immunostaining using neural markers confirmed that 5-HT3AR is expressed in GABAergic interneurons containing somatostatin or calretinin. In the present study, we built a 5-HT3AR expression map in the mouse brain. Our findings make significant contributions in elucidating the novel functions of 5-HT3R in the CNS.
McCune-Albright syndrome (MAS) is a sporadic, postzygotic disease presenting with fibrous dysplasia, cafe-au-lait spots and multiple endocrinopathies. Growth hormone (GH) excess is an uncommon but potentially severe complication of MAS. This study aims to describe the clinical manifestations of GH excess in the context of MAS and analyze the responses of these patients to treatments.
Retrospective clinical study.
Clinical data from 52 MAS patients were analyzed. Serum GH and IGF1 levels, as well as nadir GH levels after an oral glucose tolerance test and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) levels were determined before and after the treatment.
In total, 13 MAS patients (25%) had the complication of GH excess, including 10 males (76.9%). Among them, all had FD, and 6 patients had sphenoidal bone involvement. Visual deficits were present in 8 patients, and hearing deficits were present in 5. Olfactory dysfunction was observed in 3 patients. Evident pituitary adenomas were confirmed in 9 patients by MRI. These patients underwent surgery with or without pretreatment of long-acting somatostatin analogue octreotide, and 6 achieved complete remission. The serum ALP levels decreased significantly after treatment for GH excess.
MAS with GH excess is more common in male patients. GH excess can lead to more severe skeletal lesions in MAS patients involving more of the craniofacial bones. Complete trans-sphenoidal complete tumor excision with neuronavigational guidance is effective and could lower ALP levels. LAR is recommended as a preoperative treatment and when patients fail to achieve complete remission after surgery.
Esthesioneuroblastoma (ENB), also known as olfactory neuroblastoma, is a rare malignant tumor that accounts for 3% of all tumors of the nasal cavity. The incidence of ENB is 0.4 cases per million in the general population, and the most common symptoms are nasal obstruction and epistaxis. Previous studies have indicated the presence of somatostatin receptors in this tumor type. Common treatment strategies for ENB include resection and adjuvant radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy (combined treatment); however, the rate of recurrence is high. Treatment of neuroendocrine tumors using radionuclides bound to somatostatin analogues is well established in clinical practice. However, a standard and effective therapeutic approach has not been reported for ENB. The current study described the case of a 74-year-old female with numerous recurrences of ENB following multiple treatments and without possibility of resection. The patient was treated with the radiolabeled-somatostatin analogue, (177)Lutetium-DOTA-octreotate ((177)Lu-DOTA-TATE), which successfully controlled the disease. This suggests that (177)Lu-DOTA-TATE is a potential treatment for ENB and may represent an effective alternative and novel therapeutic strategy for this disease.
In this study, the regional distribution and histological localization of somatostatin (SS) immunoreactive (IR) perikarya and fibers was investigated for the first time in the brain of adult Chinese alligator by immunohistochemical method. The results showed SS-IR perikarya and fibers were widely distributed in various parts of the brain except for olfactory bulbs. In the telencephalon, SS-IR perikarya were predominantly located in the cellular layer and deep plexiform layer of dorsomedial and medial cortex, less in the dorsal and lateral cortex, while SS-IR fibers were found in all layers of the cerebral cortex. SS-IR perikarya and fibers were also detected in the dorsal ventricular ridge, hippocampus cortex, accessory olfactory bulb nuclearus, lenticular nucleus, and caudate nucleus. In the diencephalon, SS-IR perikarya and fibers were mainly present in supraoptic nucleus, paraventricular nucleus of hypothalamus, recessus infundibular nucleus, median eminence, the pineal gland and pituitary gland, in which the IR-fibers were abundant, appearing dot-shaped and varicosity-like. In the mesencephalon, they were present in tectum cortex, ependyma of cerebral aqueduct and the periaqueductal grey matter. Additionally, they were also detected in Purkinje's cellular layer of cerebellum, in the reticularis nucleus and raphe nucleus of medulla oblongata. The distribution pattern of SS-IR perikarya and fibers in the brain of Chinese alligator is generally similar to that reported in other reptiles, but also has some specific features. The wide distribution indicated that SS might be a neurotransmitter or neuromodulator which acts on many kinds of target cells with a wide range of physiological functions.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent neurodegenerative disease, mostly idiopathic and with palliative treatment. Neuropathologically, it is characterized by intracellular neurofibrillary tangles of tau protein and extracellular plaques of amyloid β peptides. The relationship between AD and neurogenesis is unknown, but two facts are particularly relevant. First, early aggregation sites of both proteinopathies include the hippocampal formation and the olfactory bulb (OB), which have been correlated to memory and olfactory deficits, respectively. These areas are well-recognized integration zones of newly-born neurons in the adult brain. Second, molecules, such as amyloid precursor protein (APP) and presenilin-1 are common to both AD etiology and neurogenic development. Adult neurogenesis in AD models has been studied in the hippocampus, but only occasionally addressed in the OB and results are contradictory. To gain insight on the relationship between adult neurogenesis and AD, this work analyzes neurogenesis, neurodegeneration, interneuron vulnerability, and amyloid-β involvement in the OB of an AD model. Control and double-transgenic mice carrying the APP and the presenilin-1 genes, which give rise amyloid β plaques have been used. BrdU-treated animals have been studied at 16, 30, 43, and 56 weeks of age. New-born cell survival (BrdU), neuronal loss (using neuronal markers NeuN and PGP9.5), differential interneuron (calbindin-, parvalbumin-, calretinin- and somatostatin-expressing populations) vulnerability, and involvement by amyloid β have been analyzed. Neurogenesis increases with aging in the granule cell layer of control animals from 16 to 43 weeks. No neuronal loss has been observed after quantifying NeuN or PGP9.5. Regarding interneuron population vulnerability: calbindin-expressing neurons remains unchanged; parvalbumin-expressing neurons trend to increase with aging in transgenic animals; calretinin-expressing neurons increase with aging in transgenic mice and decrease in control animals and neurogenesis is higher in control as compared to transgenic animals at given ages, finally; somatostatin-expressing neurons of transgenic mice decrease with aging and as compared to controls. Amyloid β aggregates with aging in the granule cell layer, which may be related to the particular involvement of somatostatin-expressing cells.
Olfactory neuroblastoma (ONB, Esthesioneuroblastoma) is an infrequent neoplasm of the head and neck area derived from olfactory neuroepithelium. Despite relatively good prognosis a subset of patients shows recurrence, progression and/or metastatic disease, which requires additional treatment. However, neither prognostic nor predictive factors are well specified. Thus, we performed a literature search for the currently available data on disturbances in molecular pathways, cytogenetic changes and results gained by next generation sequencing (NGS) approaches in ONB in order to gain an overview of genetic alterations which might be useful for treating patients with ONB. We present briefly ONB molecular pathogenesis and propose potential therapeutic targets and prognostic factors. Possible therapeutic targets in ONB include: receptor tyrosine kinases (c-kit, PDGFR-b, TrkB; EGFR); somatostatin receptor; FGF-FGFR1 signaling; Sonic hedgehog pathway; apoptosis-related pathways (Bcl-2, TRAIL) and neoangiogenesis (VEGF; KDR). Furthermore, we compare high- and low-grade ONB, and describe its frequent mimicker: sinonasal neuroendocrine carcinoma. ONB is often a therapeutic challenge, so our goal should be the implementation of acquired knowledge into clinical practice, especially at pretreated, recurrent and metastatic stages. Moreover, the multicenter molecular studies are needed to increase the amount of available data.
Despite the fact that pigs are reputed to have excellent olfactory abilities, few studies have examined regions of the pig brain involved in the sense of smell. The present study provides an overview of the olfactory bulb, anterior olfactory nucleus, and piriform cortex of adult pigs using several approaches. Nissl, myelin, and Golgi stains were used to produce a general overview of the organization of the regions and confocal microscopy was employed to examine 1) projection neurons, 2) GABAergic local circuit neurons that express somatostatin, parvalbumin, vasoactive intestinal polypeptide, or calretinin, 3) neuromodulatory fibers (cholinergic and serotonergic), and 4) glia (astrocytes and microglia). The findings revealed that pig olfactory structures are quite large, highly organized and follow the general patterns observed in mammals.
Sequencing of the honeybee genome revealed many neuropeptides and putative neuropeptide receptors, yet functional characterization of these peptidic systems is scarce. In this study, we focus on allatostatins, which were first identified as inhibitors of juvenile hormone synthesis, but whose role in the adult honey bee (Apis mellifera) brain remains to be determined. We characterize the bee allatostatin system, represented by two families: allatostatin A (Apime-ASTA) and its receptor (Apime-ASTA-R); and C-type allatostatins (Apime-ASTC and Apime-ASTCC) and their common receptor (Apime-ASTC-R). Apime-ASTA-R and Apime-ASTC-R are the receptors in bees most closely related to vertebrate galanin and somatostatin receptors, respectively. We examine the functional properties of the two honeybee receptors and show that they are transcriptionally expressed in the adult brain, including in brain centers known to be important for learning and memory processes. Thus we investigated the effects of exogenously applied allatostatins on appetitive olfactory learning in the bee. Our results show that allatostatins modulate learning in this insect, and provide important insights into the evolution of somatostatin/allatostatin signaling.
Innate fear has a critical role in survival of animals. Unlike conditioned fear, the neuronal circuitry underlying innate fear is largely unknown. We found that the laterodorsal tegmentum (LDT) and lateral habenula (LHb) are specifically activated by the mouse predator odorant trimethylthiazoline (TMT). Using optogenetics to selectively stimulate GABAergic neurons in the LDT immediately produced fear-like responses (freezing, accelerated heart rate and increased serum corticosterone), whereas prolonged stimulation caused anxiety-like behaviors. Notably, although selective stimulation of parvalbumin (PV)-positive interneurons similarly induced fear-like responses, stimulation of somatostatin-positive interneurons or inhibition of PV neurons in the LDT suppressed TMT-induced fear-like responses without affecting conditioned fear. Finally, activation of LHb glutamatergic inputs to LDT interneurons was sufficient to generate fear-like responses. Thus, the LHb-LDT pathway is important for regulating olfactory cue-induced innate fear. Our results provide a potential target for therapeutic intervention for anxiety disorder.
The principal olfactory structures display Alzheimer's disease (AD) related pathology at early stages of the disease. Consequently, olfactory deficits are among the earliest symptoms. Reliable olfactory tests for accurate clinical diagnosis are rarely made. In addition, neuropathological analysis postmortem of olfactory structures is often not made. Therefore, the relationship between the clinical features and the underlying pathology is poorly defined. Traditionally, research into Alzheimer's disease has focused on the degeneration of cortical temporal projection neurons and cholinergic neurons. Recent evidence has demonstrated the neurodegeneration of interneuron populations in AD. This review provides an updated overview of the pathological involvement of interneuron populations in the human olfactory system in Alzheimer's disease.
Cortical projection neurons are classified by hodology in corticocortical, commissural and corticofugal subtypes. Although cortical projection neurons had been regarded as only glutamatergic neurons, recently corticocortical GABAergic projection neurons has been also reported in several species. Here, we demonstrate corticofugal GABAergic projection neurons in the mouse frontal cortex. We employed viral-vector-mediated anterograde tracing, classical retrograde tracing, and immunohistochemistry to characterize neocortical GABAergic projection neurons. Injections of the Cre-dependent adeno-associated virus into glutamate decarboxylase 67 (GAD67)-Cre knock-in mice revealed neocortical GABAergic projections widely to the forebrain, including the cerebral cortices, caudate putamen (CPu), ventral pallidum (VP), lateral globus pallidus (LGP), nucleus accumbens, and olfactory tubercle (Tu). Minor GABAergic projections were also found in the mediodorsal thalamic nucleus, diagonal band of Broca, medial globus pallidus, substantial nigra, and dorsal raphe nucleus. Retrograde tracing studies also demonstrated corticofugal GABAergic projection neurons in the mouse frontal cortex. Further immunohistochemical screening with neurochemical markers revealed the majority of corticostriatal GABAergic projection neurons were positive for somatostatin (SS)-immunoreactivity. In contrast, corticothalamic GABAergic projection neurons were not identified by representative neurochemical markers for GABAergic neurons. These findings suggest that corticofugal GABAergic projection neurons are heterogeneous in terms of their neurochemical properties and target nuclei, and provide axonal innervations mainly to the nuclei in the basal ganglia.
The 5-HT6 receptor (5-HT6R) is almost exclusively expressed in the brain and has emerged as a promising target for cognitive disorders, including Alzheimer's disease. In the present study, we have determined the cell types on which the 5-HT6R is expressed by colocalizing 5-HT6R mRNA with that of a range of neuronal and interneuronal markers in the rat brain. Here, we show that 5-HT6R mRNA was expressed at high levels in medium spiny neurons in caudate putamen and in nucleus accumbens, as well as in the olfactory tubercle. Striatal 5-HT6R mRNA was colocalized with both dopamine D1 and D2 receptor mRNA. 5-HT6R mRNA was moderately expressed in the hippocampus and throughout cortical regions in glutamatergic neurons coexpressing vGluT1. A subset of GAD67-positive GABAergic interneurons (approximately 15%) expressed 5-HT6R mRNA in the cortex and hippocampus, the majority of which belonged to the 5-HT3a receptor (5-HT3aR)-expressing subpopulation. In contrast, 5-HT6R mRNA was only expressed to a minor extent in the parvalbumin and somatostatin subpopulations. A subset of calbindin- and calretinin-positive GABAergic interneurons expressed 5-HT6R mRNA while only a very minor fraction of VIP or NPY interneurons in forebrain structures expressed 5-HT6R mRNA. Serotonergic, dopaminergic or cholinergic neurons did not express 5-HT6R mRNA. These data indicate that the 5-HT6R is located on GABAergic and glutamatergic principal neurons, and on a subset of interneurons mainly belonging to the 5-HT3aR subgroup suggesting that the 5-HT6R is positioned to regulate the balance between excitatory and inhibitory signaling in the brain. These data provide new insights into the mechanisms of 5-HT6R signaling.
Melanin-concentrating hormone receptor 1 (MCH1 receptor) is known to be involved in the control of mood and stress, in addition to the regulation of feeding. Here, we report further evidence that the blockade of the MCH1 receptor exhibits antidepressant and anxiolytic-like effects in a variety of animal models using TASP0382650 and TASP0489838, newly synthesized MCH1 receptor antagonists, with different scaffolds. Both TASP0382650 and TASP0489838 exhibited high affinities for human MCH1 receptor with IC50 values of 7.13 and 3.80nM, respectively. Both compounds showed potent antagonist activities at the MCH1 receptor, as assessed using MCH-increased [(35)S]GTPγS binding to human MCH1 receptor and an MCH-induced [Ca(2+)]i assay in rat MCH1 receptor expressing cells. In contrast, neither TASP0382650 nor TASP0489838 showed an affinity for the MCH2 receptor, another MCH receptor subtype. The oral administration of TASP0382650 or TASP0489838 significantly reduced the immobility time during the forced swimming test in rats, and reduced hyperemotionality induced by an olfactory bulbectomy, both of which are indicative of an antidepressant-like potential. In the olfactory bulbectomy model, the antidepressant effect of TASP0382650 appeared following a single administration, suggesting a faster onset of action, compared with current medications. Moreover, both TASP0382650 and TASP0489838 exhibited anxiolytic effects in several animal models of anxiety. In contrast, both TASP0382650 and TASP0489838 did not affect spontaneous locomotor activity, motor function, spatial memory during the Morris water maze task, or the convulsion threshold to pentylenetetrazole. These findings provide additional evidence that the blockade of the MCH1 receptor exhibits antidepressant- and anxiolytic activities with no adverse effects in experimental animal models.
The treatment of rodents with non-competitive antagonist of the N-Methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor, MK-801 (dizocilpine), induces symptoms of psychosis, deficits in spatial memory and impairment of synaptic plasticity. Recent studies have suggested that insulin administration might attenuate the cognitive dysfunctions through the modulatory effect on the expression of NMDA receptors and on the brain insulin signaling. Intrahepatic pancreatic islet transplantation is known as an efficient tool for correcting impaired insulin signaling. We examined the capacity of syngeneic islets grafted into the cranial subarachnoid cavity to attenuate behavioral dysfunctions in rats exposed to MK-801. Animals were examined in the open field (OF) and the Morris Water Maze (MWM) tests following acute or subchronic administration of MK-801. We found well-vascularized grafted islets expressing insulin, glucagon and somatostatin onto the olfactory bulb and prefrontal cortex. Significantly higher levels of insulin were detected in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex of transplanted animals compared to the non-transplanted rats. All animals expressed normal peripheral glucose homeostasis for two months after transplantation. OF tests revealed that rats exposed to MK-801 treatment, showed hyper-responsiveness in motility parameters and augmented center field exploration compared to intact controls and these effects were attenuated by the grafted islets. Moreover, in the MWM, the rats treated with MK-801 showed impairment of spatial memory that were partially corrected by the grafted islets. In conclusion, intracranial islet transplantation leads to the expression of islet hormones in the brain and attenuates behavioral and cognitive dysfunctions in rats exposed to MK-801 administration without altering the peripheral glucose homeostasis.
Neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) comprise a heterogenous group of neoplasms with variable clinical expression and progression. The primary tumors most frequently occur in the lungs, intestine and the pancreas. The NET incidence is approximately 6.1/100,000 per year with a prevalence higher than 35/100,000 per year. A NET may be functioning with symptoms related to hormone overproduction or non-functioning, not presenting any hormone-related symptoms. From the early 1980s and onwards, Uppsala University Hospital has contributed significantly to diagnosis, just to mention immunohistochemistry, radio-immunoassays for hormones and peptides and molecular imaging. On the therapeutic side, treatments with cytotoxics as well as biologicals such as, somatostatin analogs and interferons have been evaluated. We have furthermore been involved in important phase III trials for registration of so called, new targeted agents such as, RADIANT-3 and RADIANT-2. Our group were also the first to localize the gene for MEN I on chromosome 11 locus q13. Most recent developments have been the establishments of new biomarkers such as, olfactory receptor E51E1 as well as micro-RNAs in carcinoid tumors of the intestine and lung. A new oncolytic virus, Ad-Vince, for treatment of most NETs has been developed and is ready for the clinic. Furthermore, we have been involved in establishing Nordic and international collaborations. Today, NETs is an area with rapid development and recognized by international organizations at conferences, with large attendance. The Nordic countries continue to be significant contributors to the field.
The amygdalar basolateral nuclear complex (BLC) is a cortex-like structure that receives inputs from many cortical areas. It has long been assumed that cortico-amygdalar projections, as well as inter-areal intracortical connections, arise from cortical pyramidal cells. However, recent studies have shown that GABAergic long-range nonpyramidal neurons (LRNP neurons) in the cortex also contribute to inter-areal connections. The present study combined Fluorogold (FG) retrograde tract tracing with immunohistochemistry for cortical nonpyramidal neuronal markers to determine if cortical LRNP neurons project to the BLC in the rat. Injections of FG into the BLC produced widespread retrograde labeling in the cerebral hemispheres and diencephalon. Triple-labeling for FG, somatostatin (SOM), and neuropeptide Y (NPY) revealed a small number of FG+/SOM+/NPY+ neurons and FG+/SOM+/NPY- neurons in the lateral entorhinal area, amygdalopiriform transition area, and piriform cortex, but not in the prefrontal and insular cortices, or in the diencephalon. In addition, FG+/SOM+/NPY+ neurons were observed in the amygdalostriatal transition area and in a zone surrounding the intercalated nuclei. About half of the SOM+ neurons in the lateral entorhinal area labeled by FG were GABA+. FG+ neurons containing parvalbumin were only seen in the basal forebrain, and no FG+ neurons containing vasoactive intestinal peptide were observed in any brain region. Since LRNP neurons involved in corticocortical connections are critical for synchronous oscillations that allow temporal coordination between distant cortical regions, the LRNP neurons identified in this study may play a role in the synchronous oscillations of the BLC and hippocampal region that are involved in the retrieval of fear memories.
The somatostatin analog octreotide can lead to hyperbilirubinemia without evidence of liver injury. Here we investigate whether octreotide inhibits the main sinusoidal/canalicular bilirubin carriers and whether it is a transport substrate. Octreotide showed the most potent inhibitory effect toward OATP1B1-mediated transport and weaker inhibition for OATP1B3- and MRP2-mediated transport. Octreotide had no effect on OATP2B1-mediated transport. Octreotide inhibited [(3)H]estradiol-17-β-glucuronide (E17βG) influx mediated by OATP1B1, 1B3, and multidrug resistance-associated protein 2 (MRP2) in a concentration-dependent manner, and the IC50 values were computed to be 23 μM (95% confidence interval [CI] 18-29), 68 μM (95% CI 50-91), and 116.6 μM (95% CI 74.5-182.4), respectively. The interaction between octreotide and OATP1B1 was further studied. Inhibition of [(3)H]E17βG OATP1B1-mediated transport was purely competitive with no changes in maximum transport capacity (Vmax) and a twofold Km increase when the influx kinetics of [(3)H]E17βG were measured in the presence of octreotide (8.8 ± 3.1 versus 4.4 ± 1.2 μM, P = 0.03). The inhibition constant (Ki) of octreotide for the transport of [(3)H]E17βG was calculated at 33.5 ± 5.5 μM. Uptake of radiolabeled octreotide by OATP1B1-CHO cells was higher than in wild-type CHO cells and nonlabeled octreotide at the extracellular compartment was able to trans-stimulate the OATP1B1-mediated efflux of intracellular [(3)H]E17βG, suggesting that octreotide is a substrate of OATP1B1. In summary, this study shows interaction of octreotide on the human hepatocellular bilirubin transporters OATP1B1, OATP1B3, and MRP2, notably OATP1B1. These findings are in line with the clinical observation that a fraction of patients under treatment with octreotide exhibit hyperbilirubinemia.
The composition and expression of vertebrate gene families is shaped by species specific gene loss in combination with a number of gene and genome duplication events (R1, R2 in all vertebrates, R3 in teleosts) and depends on the ecological and evolutionary context. In this study we analyzed the evolutionary history of the solute carrier 1 (SLC1) gene family. These genes are supposed to be under strong selective pressure (purifying selection) due to their important role in the timely removal of glutamate at the synapse.
In a genomic survey where we manually annotated and analyzing sequences from more than 300 SLC1 genes (from more than 40 vertebrate species), we found evidence for an interesting evolutionary history of this gene family. While human and mouse genomes contain 7 SLC1 genes, in prototheria, sauropsida, and amphibia genomes up to 9 and in actinopterygii up to 13 SLC1 genes are present. While some of the additional slc1 genes in ray-finned fishes originated from R3, the increased number of SLC1 genes in prototheria, sauropsida, and amphibia genomes originates from specific genes retained in these lineages.Phylogenetic comparison and microsynteny analyses of the SLC1 genes indicate, that theria genomes evidently lost several SLC1 genes still present in the other lineage. The genes lost in theria group into two new subfamilies of the slc1 gene family which we named slc1a8/eaat6 and slc1a9/eaat7.
The phylogeny of the SLC1/EAAT gene family demonstrates how multiple genome reorganization and duplication events can influence the number of active genes. Inactivation and preservation of specific SLC1 genes led to the complete loss of two subfamilies in extant theria, while other vertebrates have retained at least one member of two newly identified SLC1 subfamilies.
Iron-related genes and iron status may independently contribute to variable HIV outcomes. The nature of the biologically plausible gene-nutrient interaction remains unknown.
The objectives were to investigate whether iron-related genotypes and clinically abnormal iron status independently predict mortality in HIV and whether a gene-nutrient interaction exists.
Baseline plasma, DNA, and clinical data were obtained from 1362 HIV-seropositive Gambian adults followed for 11.5 y to ascertain all-cause mortality. Iron status was estimated on the basis of plasma iron, soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR), ferritin, transferrin, transferrin index, and log(sTfR/ferritin). One haptoglobin (HP) and 5 SLC11A1 (NRAMP1) polymorphisms were genotyped.
SLC11A1-SLC3 and CAAA polymorphisms were the best independent genetic predictors of mortality [adjusted mortality rate ratio (95% CI)]: SLC3:G/C = 0.59 (95% CI: 0.45, 0.85), CAAA:del/ins = 1.51 (95% CI: 1.10, 2.07). In an adjusted model that included all polymorphisms, SLC1:199/199, SLC1:other/other, SLC6a:A/A, and CAAA:del/ins were associated with significantly greater mortality, whereas Hp 2-1 and SLC3:G/C were protective. In unadjusted analyses, all biomarker concentrations were significantly associated with mortality. In an extension of previous findings, both low and elevated iron states were associated with mortality, but the nature of the risk was variable, with linear, inversely linear, and U-shaped associations depending on the biomarker. Mortality was significantly lower in HIV-2 than in HIV-1 infection in the presence of abnormal (low or elevated) iron status. A gene-iron interaction was detected (likelihood-ratio test P = 0.018); however, subject numbers restricted category-specific interpretation.
Iron-related genes, iron status, and their interaction predict mortality in HIV. These findings illustrate the complexity and uncertainty surrounding best practice for managing abnormal iron status and anemia during HIV infection and in regions with a high risk of infection.
The role of neural elements in regulating blood flow through the hepatic sinusoids, solute exchange, and parenchymal function is incompletely understood. This is due in part to limited investigation in only a few species whose hepatic innervation may differ significantly from humans. For example, most experimental studies have used rats and mice having livers with little or no intralobular innervation. In contrast, most other mammals, including humans, have aminergic and peptidergic nerves extending from perivascular plexus in the portal space into the lobule, where they course in Disse's space in close relationship to stellate cells (fat storing cells of Ito) and hepatic parenchymal cells. While these fibers extend throughout the lobule, they predominate in the periportal region. Cholinergic innervation, however, appears to be restricted to structures in the portal space and immediately adjacent hepatic parenchymal cells. Neuropeptides have been colocalized with neurotransmitters in both adrenergic and cholinergic nerves. Neuropeptide Y (NPY) has been colocalized in aminergic nerves supplying all segments of the hepatic-portal venous and the hepatic arterial and biliary systems. Nerve fibers immunoreactive for substance P and somatostatin follow a similar distribution. Intralobular distribution of all of these nerve fibers is species-dependent and similar to that reported for aminergic fibers. Vasoactive intestinal peptide and calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) are reported to coexist in cholinergic and sensory afferent nerves innervating portal veins and hepatic arteries and their branches, but not the other vascular segments or the bile ducts. Nitrergic nerves immunoreactive for neuronal nitric oxide (nNOS) are located in the portal tract where nNOS colocalizes with both NPY- and CGRP-containing fibers. In summary, the liver is innervated by aminergic, cholinergic, peptidergic, and nitrergic nerves. While innervation of structures in the portal tract is relatively similar between species, the extent and distribution of intralobular innervation are highly variable as well as species-dependent and may be inversely related to the density of gap junctions between contiguous hepatic parenchymal cells.
Systemic infusion of somatostatin in humans and rodents alters renal glomerular filtration rate, solute transport, and water clearance. Among the five different G-protein-coupled somatostatin receptors (SSTRs), SSTR1 is expressed in human kidney collecting ducts and SSTR2 is expressed in rat and human collecting ducts and glomeruli. Our laboratory recently localized SSTRs 3, 4, and 5 to mouse kidney proximal tubules. Our aim was to characterize the expression of somatostatin receptors 1 and 2 in mouse kidneys. We detected mRNA for somatostatin receptors 1 and 2 in the mouse kidney by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), with confirmation by Southern blotting. In contrast to the data in human kidneys, we localized SSTR1 proteins to mouse proximal tubules and glomerular podocytes. Similar to the reports in human and rat kidneys, we detected SSTR2 proteins in the murine glomerulus and collecting duct; we were further able to identify the specific SSTR2-positive cells as podocytes and principal cells, respectively. Thus, taken with our previously published results, the kidney expresses all five somatostatin receptors. Furthermore, the expression of the SSTRs in the mouse kidney correlates well with the known actions of somatostatin in the kidney.
Systemic infusion of somatostatin (SRIF) induces many physiological changes in human and rodent kidneys, including alterations in glomerular filtration, solute transport, and water clearance. Although somatostatin can bind to five different G-protein coupled receptors (SSTRs), only SSTR1 and SSTR2A proteins have been described convincingly in rat and/or human kidneys. Both are expressed primarily in collecting ducts, despite clear evidence that somatostatin also can bind to proximal tubules. Our aim was to characterize the expression of somatostatin receptors three to five in adult mouse kidneys.
Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was performed followed by Southern blotting on mouse kidney RNA for SSTR3, SSTR4, and SSTR5. Immunohistochemistry and dual-labeling immunofluorescence also were performed to localize the receptors in the kidney.
Messenger RNA was detected for somatostatin receptors 3 to 5 in the mouse kidney by RT-PCR, with confirmation by Southern blotting. By immunohistochemistry and dual-labeling immunofluorescence, the proteins for all three receptors were abundantly expressed, but exclusively localized to the proximal tubules. SSTR3 was present in intracellular granules, while SSTR4 and SSTR5 were expressed on the lumenal membranes of the tubules.
Expression of SSTR3, SSTR4, and SSTR5 in mouse proximal tubules complements the expression of SSTR1 and SSTR2 in collecting ducts as seen in other species. Taken together, the kidney is one of few organs expressing all five somatostatin receptors outside of the nervous system and pancreas.
The effect of the somatostatin analog agonist octreotide (Oct) on gastric emptying of 12.5% glucose during and after intragastric fill was examined in nondeprived rats equipped with stainless steel gastric fistulas. The rate of intragastric infusion (1.0 ml/min) and the volumes delivered (6 or 12 ml) were within the ranges typically observed in rats normally ingesting the same stimulus. In experiment 1, a dose-related suppression of glucose emptying during 12-min infusions was obtained in response to Oct (0, 0.0014, 0.014, 0.14, and 1.4 nmol/kg sc) injected 60 min before the test. The highest dose tested yielded a 37% suppression of glucose solute emptying during fill. In experiment 2, the suppression of emptying during fill induced by Oct (1.4 nmol/kg) was reversed by 10 or 40 microgram/kg of the somatostatin antagonist cyclo(7-aminoheptanoyl-Phe-D-Trp-Lys-Thr[Bzl]). The antagonist did not by itself affect emptying. Experiment 3 showed that the suppression of emptying obtained with 0.14 and 1.4 nmol/kg Oct had disappeared when the gastric sample was withdrawn 36 min after the termination of 12-min glucose infusions. Experiment 4 showed that the Oct-induced reductions in emptying during 6- and 12-min infusions, in fact, were reversed within 6 min after infusion offset. The point of transition between suppressed and increased emptying did not depend on time from injection or from infusion onset but was linked to the offset of the intragastric infusion regardless of its duration. The present findings support the notion that separable mechanisms govern gastric emptying during vs. after gastric fill.
Corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) acts centrally to suppress gastric emptying and increase plasma levels of somatostatin in rats. The experiments were conducted to examine whether cyclo(7-aminoheptanoyl-phe-D-TRP-LYS-THR[BZL]), which acts as a somatostatin antagonist in vivo, blocks the effect of CRF on gastric emptying of glucose. Sprague-Dawley rats were implanted with chronic intragastric fistulas and guide cannulas for fourth intracerebroventricular (4th i.c.v.) delivery. The stomach was evacuated after the offset of a 12-min intragastric glucose infusion (12.5%, 1.0 ml/min). CRF, (1000 pmol) injected 4th i.c.v. suppressed solute emptying by 44% as compared to vehicle (P &lt; 0.001). Pretreatment with cyclo(7-aminoheptanoyl-phe-D-TRP-LYS-THR[BZL]), 40 microg/kg, s.c., having no effect when delivered alone, blocked the effect of CRF on emptying. The results suggest that endogenously released somatostatin participates in CRF-induced suppression of gastric emptying during gastric fill.
Cholangiocytes possess specific membrane transport systems for a large number of substrates. As a result of the secretion or absorption of solutes, water moves passively across plasma membranes, very likely through water channels; as a result, the volume and composition of primary bile are modified. Cholangiocytes express receptors for secretin and somatostatin, hormones that alter intracellular levels of cAMP in opposite directions; these alterations very likely alter the activation (i.e., phosphorylation state) or number (i.e., by coupled exocytic-endocytic membrane modification) of transporters in the apical or basolateral cholangiocyte membranes. Although our understanding of these mechanisms is sill embryonic, it is anticipated that accelerated research efforts by laboratories utilizing recently available experimental models will provide important advances in the knowledge of the molecular mechanisms involved in the transport of water and solutes by cholangiocytes. The challenge will be to integrate the emerging, often isolated, findings in a physiologically relevant manner to understand how cholangiocytes function normally and in pathological conditions.
1. Experiments in vivo and in vitro were performed in the rat to define the role of somatostatin in modulating the hydro-osmotic action of arginine vasopressin. 2. Somatostatin had a biphasic effect on basal collecting duct diffusional water permeability with 10(-9) mol/l somatostatin producing a 14% reduction in permeability, whereas concentrations of 10(-6) and 10(-5) mol/l significantly increased basal water permeability by 13% and 22%, respectively. Somatostatin (10(-9) mol/l) also inhibited the increase in water permeability produced by arginine vasopressin, although this inhibitory effect was reduced by a 10-fold increase in arginine vasopressin concentration (5 ng/ml). 3. In the anaesthetized water-diuretic rat, low dose somatostatin (60 micrograms/h) increased free water clearance by 23% (P &lt; 0.01), whereas increasing the somatostatin concentration (600 micrograms/h) produced a transitory 40% fall in free water clearance (P &lt; 0.01). As in the experiment in vitro, somatostatin inhibited the action of arginine vasopressin, although a very high concentration of arginine vasopressin (250 ng/h) partly overcame this effect. 4. Glomerular filtration rate and renal electrolyte excretion (sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium) were not altered by somatostatin, although renal inorganic phosphate excretion was increased. The papillary solute gradient was unaltered by somatostatin. 5. These results suggest that circulating somatostatin may have a physiological role in modulating distal nephron water transport with a low concentration directly inhibiting and a high concentration facilitating water transport. There is also evidence of competitive binding between somatostatin and arginine vasopressin which antagonizes the hydro-osmotic action of arginine vasopressin.
Long-term administration of the somatostatin analogue, octreotide, is complicated by gallstone formation. Somatostatin is known to inhibit hepatic bile secretion and gallbladder emptying. However, the effect of octreotide on gallbladder bile composition remains unknown. Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that octretide would alter hepatic bile composition and cause gallbladder stasis, thereby increasing gallbladder bile solute concentrations. Fourteen control prairie dogs received daily saline injections, whereas 10 animals received 1 micrograms of octreotide subcutaneously three times per day for 5 days. Cholecystectomy and common bile duct cannulation were then performed. Octreotide increased hepatic bile concentrations of bilirubin monoglucuronide (p less than 0.05), total bilirubin (p less than 0.05), and total protein (p less than 0.01). Rsa, an index of gallbladder stasis, was decreased (p less than 0.01) in the octreotide group. Gallbladder bile total calcium (p less than 0.05), bilirubin monoglucuronide (p less than 0.05), total bilirubin (p less than 0.01), total protein (p less than 0.05), and total lipids (p less than 0.05) were increased in the octreotide group. Animals receiving octreotide also had decreased hepatic (p less than 0.05) and gallbladder (p less than 0.001) bile pH. No differences in cholesterol saturation index were observed. These data suggest that in the prairie dog, octreotide (1) alters hepatic bile composition, (2) causes gallbladder stasis, and (3) increases gallbladder bile calcium, bilirubin, protein, lipid, and hydrogen ion concentrations. We conclude that octreotide causes alterations in gallbladder bile composition that increase the likelihood of cholesterol and calcium bilirubinate precipitation.
We have measured the effects of intravenous infusion of calcitonin gene-related peptide at doses of 2.5, 10, and 50 pmol/kg.min on net jejunal water and solute fluxes and on plasma somatostatin concentrations in dogs. The hemodynamic effects and the pharmacokinetics of the peptide were also assessed. Using the triple-lumen perfusion technique in unsedated restrained animals it was shown that the highest dose of the peptide stimulated a transient net jejunal water and electrolyte secretion, and induced diarrhea in 4 of 6 animals receiving it. The peptide also induced dose-dependent tachycardia, hypotension, and increases in plasma immunoreactive somatostatin. All three doses of calcitonin gene-related peptide produced plasma immunoreactive peptide levels within the elevated range previously measured in human patients with medullary thyroid carcinoma. Calcitonin gene-related peptide may have a major role in the pathogenesis of secretory diarrhea in medullary thyroid carcinoma.
Clinical monitoring of adoptive T cell transfer (ACT) utilizes serial blood analyses to discern T cell activity. While useful, these data are 1-dimensional and lack spatiotemporal information related to treatment efficacy or toxicity. We utilized a human genetic reporter, somatostatin receptor 2 (SSTR2), and PET, to quantitatively and longitudinally visualize whole-body T cell distribution and antitumor dynamics using a clinically approved radiotracer. Initial evaluations determined that SSTR2-expressing T cells were detectable at low densities with high sensitivity and specificity. SSTR2-based PET was applied to ACT of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells targeting intercellular adhesion molecule-1, which is overexpressed in anaplastic thyroid tumors. Timely CAR T cell infusions resulted in survival of tumor-bearing mice, while later infusions led to uniform death. Real-time PET imaging revealed biphasic T cell expansion and contraction at tumor sites among survivors, with peak tumor burden preceding peak T cell burden by several days. In contrast, nonsurvivors displayed unrelenting increases in tumor and T cell burden, indicating that tumor growth was outpacing T cell killing. Thus, longitudinal PET imaging of SSTR2-positive ACT dynamics enables prognostic, spatiotemporal monitoring with unprecedented clarity and detail to facilitate comprehensive therapy evaluation with potential for clinical translation.
Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM) is an autoimmune disorder resulting out of T cell mediated destruction of pancreatic beta cells. Immunomodulatory properties of mesenchymal stem cells may help to regenerate beta cells and/or prevent further destruction of remnant, unaffected beta cells in diabetes. We have assessed the ability of umbilical cord derived MSCs (UCMSCs) to differentiate into functional islet cells in vitro.
We have isolated UCMSCs and allowed sequential exposure of various inducing agents and growth factors. We characterized these cells for confirmation of the presence of islet cell markers and their functionality. The spindle shaped undifferentiated UCMSCs, change their morphology to become triangular in shape. These cells then come together to form the islet like structures which then grow in size and mature over time. These cells express pancreatic and duodenal homeobox -1 (PDX-1), neurogenin 3 (Ngn-3), glucose transporter 2 (Glut 2) and other pancreatic cell markers like glucagon, somatostatin and pancreatic polypeptide and lose expression of MSC markers like CD73 and CD105. They were functionally active as demonstrated by release of physiological insulin and C-peptide in response to elevated glucose concentrations.
Pancreatic islet like cells with desired functionality can thus be obtained in reasonable numbers from undifferentiated UCMSCs in vitro. This could help in establishing a "very definitive source" of islet like cells for cell therapy. UCMSCs could thus be a game changer in treatment of diabetes.
Human T lymphocytes infiltrating tissues in autoimmune diseases are known to express somatostatin receptors amongst other activation markers. In this study, we evaluated whether somatostatin receptor scintigraphy (SRS) using a radiolabelled somatostatin analogue ((99m)Tc-EDDA/tricine-HYNIC-tyr(3)-octreotide ((99m)Tc-EDDA/HYNIC-TOC)) is able to detect the presence of immune-mediated processes in patients with rheumatoid arthritis and secondary Sjögren's syndrome. We also aimed to evaluate whether positivity to SRS was predictive of therapeutic response and if SRS could be used for monitoring the efficacy of immunomodulatory treatment.
Eighteen patients with rheumatoid arthritis and secondary Sjögren's syndrome not responding to conventional treatment were recruited for treatment with infliximab, a monoclonal antibody against TNF-α. All patients had complete blood cell count, renal and liver function tests, measurements of ESR, CRP, ANA, ENA, and anti-dsDNA antibodies, functional salivary gland scintigraphy, labial biopsy, and ophthalmologic assessment with Schirmer's test and tear film break-up time (BUT). Diagnosis was made according to the revised criteria of the American-European Consensus Group. All patients underwent SRS at baseline and after 3-6 months of therapy with infliximab. Eleven out of 18 had repeat SRS images. Images of the salivary glands and major joints were acquired 3 h after injection of 370 MBq of (99m)Tc-EDDA/HYNIC-TOC. Image analysis was performed semi-quantitatively.
All patients showed uptake of (99m)Tc-EDDA/HYNIC-TOC in the joints. Salivary glands also showed variable radiopharmaceutical uptake in 12 out of 18 patients, but all patients showed presence of lymphocytic infiltration at labial salivary gland biopsy. All patients, who repeated the study after treatment, showed significant reduction of somatostatin uptake in the joints but not in the salivary glands.
SRS using (99m)Tc-EDDA/HYNIC-TOC may be a useful imaging tool to assess disease activity and extent in patients with rheumatoid arthritis and may help to detect secondary Sjögren's syndrome. It may also aid therapy decision-making with anti-TNFα antibodies in the joints but not in salivary glands.
to investigate the specific features of somatostatin receptor expression in the ileal mucosa of patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).
Ileal biopsy specimens from 42 patients aged 22 to 55 years, including 16 patients with Crohn's disease (CD), 14 with indeterminate colitis of IBD unclassified (IBDU), and 12 with the unchanged ileal mucosa (a comparison group). Immunohistochemical examination was performed using anti-somatostatin receptor type 2 (SSTR-2) antibodies (Epitomics, USA). SSTR2-positively stained cells were counted per 100 epitheliocytes.
There were three receptor expression types: predominantly membranous, cytoplasmic, and mixed (membranous-cytoplasmic). Calculation of cells with membranous expression indicated that the median was 1 in the patients with Crohn's disease (interquartile range (IQR) 0.5), 3 in those with IBDU (IQR 2.5), and 2 (IQR 2) in the comparison group. These indicators were 1 (IQR 2), 3 (IQR 2), and 2 (IQR 1) for cytoplasmic expression and 5 (IQR 4), 2 (IQR 3), and 3 (IQR 2) for membranous-cytoplasmic one.
The number of SSTR-2-expressing cells was significantly smaller in the patients with Crohn's disease than that in those with the unchanged mucosa and in those with indeterminate (unclassified) colitis. There were three SSTR2 staining types: predominantly membranous, cytoplasmic, and mixed (membranous-cytoplasmic). The cells with membranous staining appeared to be neuroendocrine, those with cytoplasmic expression were intraepithelial T lymphocytes, and those with membranous-cytoplasmic expression were both neuroendocrine and epithelial.
Цель исследования — изучить особенности экспрессии рецепторов соматостатина в слизистой оболочке подвздошной кишки при воспалительных заболеваниях кишечника. Материал и методы. Исследованы илеобиоптаты от 42 больных в возрасте от 22 до 55 лет: 16 — с болезнью Крона, 14 — с неопределенным (неклассифицируемым) колитом и 12 — с неизмененной слизистой оболочкой подвздошной кишки (группа сравнения). Иммуногистохимическое исследование проведено с антителами SSTR-2 к рецепторам соматостатина 2-го типа («Epitomics», США). Подсчет позитивно окрашенных клеток проводили на 100 эпителиоцитов. Результаты. Выявлено три варианта экспрессии рецепторов: преимущественно мембранный, цитоплазматический и смешанный (мембранно-цитоплазматический). Подсчет клеток с мембранной экспрессией показал, что медиана при болезни Крона составила 1 [интерквартильный размах (ИК) =0,5], при неклассифицируемом колите — 3 (ИК=2,5), в группе сравнения — 2 (ИК=2). Для цитоплазматического варианта экспрессии эти показатели были равны соответственно 1 (ИК=2), 3 (ИК=2) и 2 (ИК=1), а мембранно-цитоплазматического варианта — 5 (ИК=4), 2 (ИК=3) и 3 (ИК=2). Заключение. Число клеток, экспрессирующих рецепторы соматостатина 2-го типа, уменьшено в большей степени у больных с болезнью Крона по сравнению с больными с неизмененной слизистой оболочкой и пациентами с неопределенным (неклассифицируемым) колитом. Выявлено три варианта экспрессии рецепторов соматостатина 2-го типа — преимущественно мембранный, цитоплазматический и смешанный (мембранно-цитоплазматический). Клетки с мембранным вариантом экспрессии этих рецепторов являются, по-видимому, нейроэндокринными, с цитоплазматическим — интраэпителиальными Т-лимфоцитами, а с мембранно-цитоплазматическим — как нейроэндокринными, так и эпителиальными.
Current vaccination technology can advance from the use of novel ceramic nanoporous microneedle arrays (npMNA), where the material serves as a storage reservoir for vaccines. Moreover, npMNA will enhance vaccine efficacy by more precisely reaching skin dendritic cells, the kickstarters of T and B cell immunity. In the present study we assessed the efficacy of vaccination using npMNAs by in vivo application of OVA257-264 peptides mixed with agonistic anti-CD40 antibodies as adjuvant. The induction of OVA-specific CD8(+) T cells via npMNA was comparable with the frequency induced via intradermal injection using needle-syringe. However, only when expanding the vaccination area by using two npMNAs the frequencies of induced IFN-γ-specific effector CD8(+) T cells were comparable with those induced via needle-syringe injection. Analysis of vaccine release from npMNA in a human ex vivo skin explant model revealed that OVA257-264 peptides were indeed delivered intradermal, and release also increased by prolonging the npMNA application time on the human skin. Together, our studies demonstrate the potential of npMNA for vaccine delivery in human skin and in vivo induction of CD8(+) effector T cell responses.
Cerebral stroke induces massive Th1-shifted inflammation both in the brain and the periphery, contributing to the outcome of stroke. A Th1-type response is neurotoxic whereas a Th2-type response is accompanied by secretion of anti-inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-4 (IL-4). Interleukin-33 (IL-33) is a cytokine known to induce a shift towards the Th2-type immune response, polarize macrophages/microglia towards the M2-type, and induce production of anti-inflammatory cytokines. We found that the plasma levels of the inhibitory IL-33 receptor, sST2, are increased in human stroke and correlate with a worsened stroke outcome, suggesting an insufficient IL-33-driven Th2-type response. In mouse, peripheral administration of IL-33 reduced stroke-induced cell death and improved the sensitivity of the contralateral front paw at 5days post injury. The IL-33-treated mice had increased levels of IL-4 in the spleen and in the peri-ischemic area of the cortex. Neutralization of IL-4 by administration of an IL-4 antibody partially prevented the IL-33-mediated protection. IL-33 treatment also reduced astrocytic activation in the peri-ischemic area and increased the number of Arginase-1 immunopositive microglia/macrophages at the lesion site. In human T-cells, IL-33 treatment induced IL-4 secretion, and the conditioned media from IL-33-exposed T-cells reduced astrocytic activation. This study demonstrates that IL-33 is protective against ischemic insult by induction of IL-4 secretion and may represent a novel therapeutic approach for the treatment of stroke.
Cortistatin is a neuropeptide isolated from cortical brain regions, showing high structural homology and sharing many functions with somatostatin. However, cortistatin exerts unique functions in the central nervous and immune systems, including decreasing locomotor activity, inducing sleep-promoting effects, and deactivating inflammatory and T helper (TH )1/TH 17-driven responses in preclinical models of sepsis, arthritis, multiple sclerosis, and colitis. Besides its release by cortical and hippocampal interneurons, cortistatin is produced by macrophages, lymphocytes, and peripheral nociceptive neurons in response to inflammatory stimuli, supporting a physiological role of cortistatin in the immune and nociceptive systems. Cortistatin-deficient mice have been shown to have exacerbated nociceptive responses to neuropathic and inflammatory pain sensitization. However, a paradoxical effect has been observed in studies of immune disorders, in which, despite showing competent inflammatory/autoreactive responses, cortistatin-deficient mice were partially resistant to systemic autoimmunity and inflammation. This unexpected phenotype was associated with elevated circulating glucocorticoids and anxiety-like behavior. These findings support cortistatin as a novel multimodal therapeutic approach to treat autoimmunity and clinical pain and identify it as a key endogenous component of the neuroimmune system related to stress responses.
In previous studies we found that several Neurotransmitters and Neuropeptides among them: Glutamate, Dopamine, Gonadotropin-releasing-hormone (GnRH) I and II, Somatostatin, CGRP and Neuropeptide Y, can each by itself, at low physiological concentration (~10 nM) bind its receptors in human T cells and trigger several key T cell functions. These findings showed that the nervous system, via Neurotransmitters and Neuropeptides, can 'talk' directly to the immune system, and stimulate what we coined 'Nerve-Driven Immunity': immune responses dictated by the nervous system. In various human cancers, the immune system of the patients, and their T cells in particular, are not functioning well enough against the cancer due to several reasons, among them the suppressive effects on the immune system induced by: (1) the cancer itself, (2) the chemotherapy and radiotherapy, (3) the ongoing/chronic stress, anxiety, depression and pain felt by the cancer patients. In Head and Neck Cancer (HNC), 5-year survival rate remains below 50%, primarily because of local recurrences or second primary tumors. Two-thirds of HNC patients are diagnosed at advanced clinical stage and have significantly poorer prognosis. Most HNC patients have multiple severe immunological defects especially in their T cells. A major defect in T cells of patients with HNC or other types of cancer is low CD3zeta expression that correlates with poor prognosis, decreased proliferation, apoptotic profile, abnormal cytokine secretion and poor abilities of destructing cancer cells. T cells of cancer patients are often also unable to migrate properly towards the tumor. In this study we asked if Glutamate, Dopamine or GnRH-II can augment the spontaneous migration, chemotactic migration and towards autologous HNC migration, and also increase CD3zeta and CD3epsilon expression, of peripheral T cells purified from the blood of five HNC patients. These HNC patients had either primary tumor or recurrence, and have been already treated by surgery and/or radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy without satisfactory outcomes. We found that Glutamate, Dopamine and GnRH-II, each by itself, at 10 nM, and during 30 min incubation only with the peripheral T cells of the HNC patients increased substantially their: (1) spontaneous migration (up to 4.4 fold increase), (2) chemotactic migration towards the key chemokine SDF-1 (up to 2.3 fold increase), (3) migration towards the autologous HNC tumor removed surgically ~48 h earlier in a pre-planned operation (up to 3.5 fold increase). Each of the Neurotransmitters even 'allowed' the T cells of one HNC patient to overcome completely the suppressive anti-migration effect of his autologous tumor, (4) cell surface CD3zeta expression (up to 4.3 fold increase), (5) cell surface CD3epsilon expression (up to 1.9 fold increase). If the absolutely essential larger scale subsequent studies would validate our present findings, Glutamate, Dopamine and GnRH-II could be used for a completely novel indication: adoptive T cell immunotherapy for some patients with HNC and maybe also other types of cancer. We coin here a novel term-'Neuroimmunotherapy' for this new form of T cell immunotherapy, based on the direct activation of the patient's own T cells by Neurotransmitters. Such 'Neuroimmunotherapy' could be reduced to practice by rather simple, painless and repeated/periodical removal of peripheral T cells from the cancer patients, activating them ex vivo for 30 min by either Glutamate, Dopamine or GnRH-II, and infusing them back to the patients by intravenous and/or intratumoral injection. The 'rejuvenated' Neurotransmitter-treated T cells are expected to have significantly improved abilities to reach and eradicate the cancer, and also combat infectious organisms that cancer patients often suffer from. Since the T cells are autologous, since the Neurotransmitters are physiological molecules, and since the ex vivo 'parking period' is very short, such Neuroimmunotherapy is expected to be very safe.
Peptide hormone somatostatin and its receptors (SSTRs) have a wide range of physiological functions and play a role in the treatment of numerous human diseases, including colorectal cancer. Octreotide, a somatostatin-analog peptide, inhibits growth of colonic cancer SW480 cells through Wnt/β-catenin pathway modulation. However, the specific octreotide-stimulating SSTR subtypes and the signal-transduction mechanism responsible for the negative regulation of Wnt/β-catenin pathway by octreotide have not been fully elucidated.
Octreotide-induced apoptosis in SW480 colon cancer cells mediated by SSTR2,SSTR5-dependent regulation of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway components GSK-3β and β-catenin was investigated. Cell apoptosis of SW480 cells was measured by apoptosis-DNA ladder assay. SSTR1, SSTR2, SSTR3, SSTR4, and SSTR5 mRNA expression levels were confirmed by RT-PCR; β-catenin, TCF-4, cyclin D1, c-Myc, and GSK-3β protein levels were examined by Western blot. The distribution of β-catenin in the cell was analyzed with immunocytochemistry.
Octreotide treatment increased SSTR2,SSTR5-induced apoptosis of SW480 colon cancer cells, promoted the plasma membrane accumulation of β-catenin, inactivated T-cell factor-dependent transcription, and downregulated Wnt target genes cyclin D1 and c-Myc. Further, octreotide treatment mediated the activation of GSK-3.
These preliminary findings showed the negative regulation of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway by peptide hormone G protein-coupled receptors SSTRs.
Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infects and destroys cells of the immune system leading to an overt immune deficiency known as HIV acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS). The gut associated lymphoid tissue is one of the major lymphoid tissues targeted by HIV-1, and is considered a reservoir for HIV-1 replication and of major importance in CD4+ T-cell depletion. In addition to immunodeficiency, HIV-1 infection also directly causes gastrointestinal (GI) dysfunction, also known as HIV enteropathy. This enteropathy can manifest itself as many pathological changes in the GI tract. The objective of this study was to determine the association of gut HIV-1 infection markers with long-term survival in a cohort of men who have sex with men (MSM) enrolled pre-HAART (Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy). We examined survival over 15-years in a cohort of 42 HIV-infected cases: In addition to CD4+ T cell counts and HIV-1 plasma viral load, multiple gut compartment (duodenum and colon) biopsies were taken by endoscopy every 6 months during the initial 3-year period. HIV-1 was cultured from tissues and phenotyped and viral loads in the gut tissues were determined. Moreover, the tissues were subjected to an extensive assessment of enteroendocrine cell distribution and pathology. The collected data was used for survival analyses, which showed that patients with higher gut tissue viral load levels had a significantly worse survival prognosis. Moreover, lower numbers of serotonin (duodenum) and somatostatin (duodenum and colon) immunoreactive cell counts in the gut tissues of patients was associated with significant lower survival prognosis. Our study, suggested that HIV-1 pathogenesis and survival prognosis is associated with altered enteroendocrine cell numbers, which could point to a potential role for enteroendocrine function in HIV infection and pathogenesis.
Type 1 diabetes (T1D) results from a T cell dependent, autoimmune destruction of insulin producing beta cells in pancreatic islets of Langerhans, which results in insulin deficiency despite attempts at beta cell replacement by the emergence of newly-differentiated beta cells throughout T1D development. The origin of these cells has been difficult to assess as these are rapidly destroyed by the underlying autoimmunity. The identification of islets of Langerhans is typically assessed by either immunochemistry or immunofluorescence using antibodies directed against the different signature hormones and surface markers of various endocrine cells. However, the limited number of markers that can be used simultaneously and the uneven spatial distribution of endocrine cells within islets, limit the use of these histological analyses. To circumvent these caveats, we developed a novel approach using multi-parametric flow cytometry to assess the phenotype and function of pancreatic islet cell populations throughout T1D development. Using such strategy, we show that while beta cells undergo autoimmune destruction, insulin-producing cells arise from trans-differentiated alpha or delta cells, an outcome that was not solely the result of beta cell self-renewal. Moreover, we show that CD4(+)T cell-mediated inflammation correlates with the emergence of this insulin-producing beta cell-like cell.
Oral tolerance is defined as the specific suppression of humoral and/or cellular immune responses to an antigen by administration of the same antigen through the oral route. Due to its absence of toxicity, easy administration, and antigen specificity, oral tolerance is a very attractive approach to prevent unwanted immune responses that cause a variety of diseases or that complicate treatment of a disease. Many researchers have induced oral tolerance to efficiently treat autoimmune and inflammatory diseases in different animal models. However, clinical trials yielded limited success. Thus, understanding the mechanisms of oral tolerance induction to therapeutic proteins is critical for paving the way for clinical development of oral tolerance protocols. This review will summarize progress on understanding the major underlying tolerance mechanisms and contributors, including antigen presenting cells, regulatory T cells, cytokines, and signaling pathways. Potential applications, examples for therapeutic proteins and disease targets, and recent developments in delivery methods are discussed.
The autoimmune regulator (Aire), mediates central tolerance of peripheral self. Its activity in thymic epithelial cells (TECs) directs the ectopic expression of thousands of tissue-restricted antigens (TRAs), causing the deletion of autoreactive thymocytes. The molecular mechanisms orchestrating the breadth of transcriptional regulation by Aire remain unknown. One prominent model capable of explaining both the uniquely high number of Aire-dependent targets and their specificity posits that tissue-specific transcription factors induced by Aire directly activate their canonical targets, exponentially adding to the total number of Aire-dependent TRAs. To test this "Hierarchical Transcription" model, we analysed mice deficient in the pancreatic master transcription factor pancreatic and duodenal homeobox 1 (Pdx1), specifically in TECs (Pdx1(ΔFoxn1) ), for the expression and tolerance of pancreatic TRAs. Surprisingly, we found that lack of Pdx1 in TECs did not reduce the transcription of insulin or somatostatin, or alter glucagon expression. Moreover, in a model of thymic deletion driven by a neo-TRA under the control of the insulin promoter, Pdx1 in TECs was not required to affect thymocyte deletion or the generation of regulatory T (Treg) cells. These findings suggest that the capacity of Aire to regulate expression of a huge array of TRAs relies solely on an unconventional transcriptional mechanism, without intermediary transcription factors.
The function of lymphoid organs and immune cells is often modulated by hormones, steroids and neuropeptides produced by the neuroendocrine and immune systems. The thymus intrinsically produces these factors and a comparative analysis of the expression of neuropeptides in the thymus of different species would highlight the evolutionary importance of neuroendocrine interaction in T cell development. In this review, we highlight the evidence which describes the intrathymic expression and function of various neuropeptides and their receptors, in particular somatostatin, substance P, vasointestinal polypeptide, calcitonin gene-related peptide and neuropeptide Y, in mammals (human, rodent) and non-mammals (avian, amphibian and teleost), and conclude that neuropeptides play a conserved role in vertebrate thymocyte development.
to investigate the effect of somatostatin on inflammatory immune disorders and prognosis in patients with severe sepsis caused by abdominal diseases.
fifty-three patients with severe abdominal sepsis (age &gt; 18 years, APACHE-II score &gt; 15) from June 2005 to June 2009 were randomly divided into Somatostatin group (n = 23) and SSC Group (n = 30). Fifteen healthy volunteers of the same age range were chosen as Control group. The SSC group was treated with classical SSC therapy, and the Somatostatin Group was treated with the same regime plus 14-peptide somatostatin continuous infusion at the dose of 6 mg/24 h for 7 days. The serum levels of interleukin-10 (IL-10), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) were determined by using ELISA. CD(4)(+), CD(8)(+) T cell subsets were determined by fluorescence activated cell sorter(FACS) and CD(4)(+)/CD(8)(+) was calculated. APACHE-II score was observed on admission (d1) and day 3, 7 and 14 after treatment. Morality rates in 28 days in two groups were recorded.
compared with Control group, IL-10 and TNF-α levels were significantly elevated in patients with severe abdominal sepsis (P &lt; 0.05), while CD(4)(+), CD(8)(+) T cell and CD(4)(+)/CD(8)(+) decreased significantly (P &lt; 0.05). Compared with the Somatostatin group CD(4)(+), CD(8)(+) T cell and CD(4)(+)/CD(8)(+) on d7 and d14 in SSC Group were significantly increased (P &lt; 0.05), while IL-10 and TNF-α decreased significantly(P &lt; 0.05). APACHE-II scores on d3, d7, d14 of Somatostatin group were significantly lower than those of SSC group, and 28 d mortality rate also declined.
in patients with severe abdominal sepsis, systemic inflammatory response and immune suppression exist simultaneously. Somatostatin has a dual immunomodulatory activity in these patients.
Sertoli cells (SCs) provide an immunoprotective environment to pancreatic islet grafts for treatment of insulin-dependent diabetes. Aim of this work was to verify whether intraperitoneal graft of SCs, enveloped in barium alginate-based microcapsules, would reverse overt spontaneous diabetes in nonobese diabetic (NOD) mice by eliciting generation of newly formed functional islets β-cells.
Microcapsules were prepared, according to our method, by a mono air-jet device system and thereafter examined as far as (a) SC morphology by light microscopy; (b) SC viability by fluorescence microscopy; (c) SC in vitro function; and (d) SC in vivo function, as quoted by diabetes reversal in the NOD mice, were concerned.
SCs containing microcapsules exhibited excellent morphology, viability, and function, and when grafted into the NOD's, they induced stable reversion of the disease in 81% of the cases. The treated mice showed dramatic increase in regulatory T lymphocytes (Treg) when compared with control diabetic NOD's treated with empty capsules only. Histologic examination of pancreata retrieved from the SC-transplanted animals showed total disappearance of insulitis, with appearance of new islets, as shown by immunocytochemistry; restored ability of the islets to produce insulin, glucagon, and somatostatin; and finally, increased expression of key transcriptional factors such as neurogenin 3.
SCs, enveloped in barium alginate-based microcapsules, showed no long-term loss of their functional and morphological properties in vitro or in vivo. Xenograft of microencapsulated-SC-induced reversal of spontaneous diabetes in the majority of the treated NOD mice, based on SC-related powerful immunomodulatory and pro-β-cell regeneration properties.
The hypoxic environment of tumor region stimulated the up regulation of growth factors responsible for angiogenesis and tumor proliferation. Thus, targeting the tumor vasculature along with the proliferation by dual tyrosine kinase inhibitor may be the efficient way of treating advanced breast cancers, which can be further enhanced by combining with radiotherapy. However, the effectiveness of radiotherapy may be severely compromised by toxicities and tumor resistance due to radiation-induced adaptive response contributing to recurrence and metastases of breast cancer. The rational of using ZD6474 is to evaluate the feasibility and efficacy of combined VEGFR2 and EGFR targeting with concurrent targeted and localized UV-B phototherapy in vitro breast cancer cells with the anticipation to cure skin lesions infiltrated with breast cancer cells.
Breast cancer cells were exposed to UV-B and ZD6474 and the cell viability, apoptosis, invasion and motility studies were conducted for the combinatorial effect. Graphs and statistical analyses were performed using Graph Pad Prism 5.0.
ZD6474 and UV-B decreased cell viability in breast cancers in combinatorial manner without affecting the normal human mammary epithelial cells. ZD6474 inhibited cyclin E expression and induced p53 expression when combined with UV-B. It activated stress induced mitochondrial pathway by inducing translocation of bax and cytochrome-c. The combination of ZD6474 with UV-B vs. either agent alone also more potently down-regulated the anti-apoptotic bcl-2 protein, up-regulated pro-apoptotic signaling events involving expression of bax, activation of caspase-3 and caspase-7 proteins, and induced poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase resulting in apoptosis. ZD6474 combined with UV-B inhibited invasion of breast cancer cells in vitro as compared to either single agent, indicating a potential involvement of pro-angiogenic growth factors in regulating the altered expression and reorganization of cytoskeletal proteins in combinatorial treated breast cancer cells. Involvement of combination therapy in reducing the expression of matrix metalloprotease was also observed.
Collectively, our studies indicate that incorporating an anti-EGFR plus VEGFR strategy (ZD6474) with phototherapy (UV-B), an alternative approach to the ongoing conventional radiotherapy for the treatment of infiltrating metastatic breast cancer cells in the skin and for locally recurrence breast cancer than either approach alone.
Complexities in the full genome expression studies hinder the extraction of tracker genes to analyze the course of biological events. In this study, we demonstrate the applications of supervised machine learning methods to reduce the irrelevance in microarray data series and thereby extract robust molecular markers to track biological processes. The methodology has been illustrated by analyzing whole genome expression studies on bone-implant integration (ossointegration). Being a biological process, osseointegration is known to leave a trail of genetic footprint during the course. In spite of existence of enormous amount of raw data in public repositories, researchers still do not have access to a panel of genes that can definitively track osseointegrtion. The results from our study revealed panels comprising of matrix metalloproteinases and collagen genes were able to track osseointegration on implant surfaces (MMP9 and COL1A2 on micro-textured; MMP12 and COL6A3 on superimposed nano-textured surfaces) 100% classification accuracy, specificity and sensitivity. Further, our analysis showed the importance of the progression of the duration in establishment of the mechanical connection at bone-implant surface. The findings from this study are expected to be useful to researchers investigating osseointegration of novel implant materials especially at the early stage. The methodology demonstrated can be easily adapted by scientists in different fields to analyze large databases for other biological processes.
The analysis of pathophysiological change to erythrocytes is important for early diagnosis of anaemia. The manual assessment of pathology slides is time-consuming and complicated regarding various types of cell identification. This paper proposes an ensemble rule-based decision-making approach for morphological classification of erythrocytes. Firstly, the digital microscopic blood smear images are pre-processed for removal of spurious regions followed by colour normalisation and thresholding. The erythrocytes are segmented from background image using the watershed algorithm. The shape features are then extracted from the segmented image to detect shape abnormality present in microscopic blood smear images. The decision about the abnormality is taken using proposed multiple rule-based expert systems. The deciding factor is majority ensemble voting for abnormally shaped erythrocytes. Here, shape-based features are considered for nine different types of abnormal erythrocytes including normal erythrocytes. Further, the adaptive boosting algorithm is used to generate multiple decision tree models where each model tree generates an individual rule set. The supervised classification method is followed to generate rules using a C4.5 decision tree. The proposed ensemble approach is precise in detecting eight types of abnormal erythrocytes with an overall accuracy of 97.81% and weighted sensitivity of 97.33%, weighted specificity of 99.7%, and weighted precision of 98%. This approach shows the robustness of proposed strategy for erythrocytes classification into abnormal and normal class. The article also clarifies its latent quality to be incorporated in point of care technology solution targeting a rapid clinical assistance.
Ki-67 protein expression plays an important role in predicting the proliferative status of tumour cells and deciding the future course of therapy in breast cancer. Immunohistochemical (IHC) determination of Ki-67 score or labelling index, by estimating the fraction of Ki67 positively stained tumour cells, is the most widely practiced method to assess tumour proliferation (Dowsett et al. 2011). Accurate manual counting of these cells (specifically nuclei) due to complex and dense distribution of cells, therefore, becomes critical and presents a major challenge to pathologists. In this paper, we suggest a hybrid clustering algorithm to quantify the proliferative index of breast cancer cells based on automated counting of Ki-67 nuclei. The proposed methodology initially pre-processes the IHC images of Ki-67 stained slides of breast cancer. The RGB images are converted to grey, L*a*b*, HSI, YCbCr, YIQ and XYZ colour space. All the stained cells are then characterized by two stage segmentation process. Fuzzy C-means quantifies all the stained cells as one cluster. The blue channel of the first stage output is given as input to k-means algorithm, which provides separate cluster for Ki-67 positive and negative cells. The count of positive and negative nuclei is used to calculate the F-measure for each colour space. A comparative study of our work with the expert opinion is studied to evaluate the error rate. The positive and negative nuclei detection results for all colour spaces are compared with the ground truth for validation and F-measure is calculated. The F-measure for L*a*b* colour space (0.8847) provides the best statistical result as compared to grey, HSI, YCbCr, YIQ and XYZ colour space. Further, a study is carried out to count nuclei manually and automatically from the proposed algorithm with an average error rate of 6.84% which is significant. The study provides an automated count of positive and negative nuclei using L*a*b*colour space and hybrid segmentation technique. Computerized evaluation of proliferation index can aid pathologist in assessing breast cancer severity. The proposed methodology, further, has the potential advantage of saving time and assisting in decision making over the present manual procedure and could evolve as an assistive pathological decision support system.
In this paper, the comparative binding behavior of antimalarial drug azure A, azure B and azure C with bovine serum albumin (BSA) has been studied. The interaction has been confirmed by multispectroscopic (UV, fluorescence, Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR), and circular dichroism) and molecular docking techniques. The experimental results show that azure B has the highest BSA binding affinity followed by azure A and azure C. The experimental evidence of binding showed a static quenching mechanism in the interaction azures with BSA. The isothermal titration calorimetry result reveals that the binding was exothermic with positive entropy contribution in each case. The thermodynamic parameters ΔH, ΔG, and ΔS at 25°C were calculated, which indicates that the weak van der Waals forces and hydrogen bonding rather than the hydrophobic effect played an important role in the interaction. According to the theory of Förster nonradiative energy transfer, the distance (r) between the donor (BSA) and acceptor azures found to be &lt;7 nm in all the case. The circular dichroism and FT-IR studies show that the content of α-helix structure has increased for the azures-BSA system. Overall, experimental studies characterize the interaction dynamics and energetics of the binding of three toxic analogs towards the physiologically relevant serum albumins. We hope, the outcome of this work will be most helpful for synthesizing a new type of phenothiazinium derivatives of the better therapeutic application.
Diabetes mellitus is prevailing in the malnourished populations congruently in well-nourished ones with an escalating trend in the former group regardless of the absence of obesity as an etiologic determining factor as per the studies in underprivileged sectors of the population. Chronic undernutrition across a lifetime may be an imperative stimulator of diabetes in an individual either by progressively reducing beta cell function alongside islet cell volume and increasing the individual predisposition to other genetic or environmental diabetogenic influences with modifying influence on the course of clinical syndrome. Ketosis resistant insulinopenia is irreversible to the sustained vigorous nutritional convalescence in a substantial fraction of malnourished subjects. It also debunks a latent diabetic stage with insulin resistance reflected by greater insulin requirement in comparison to the patients with type I diabetes with the same beta cell failure fraction and obese type II diabetic patients with equivalent glycemic control gauged by HbA1c levels. Current tendency warrants the replacement of conventional therapy by community oriented theranostic approaches and health programs to curb the epidemic.
Selective targeting to the tumor niche remains a major challenge in successful cancer therapy. Somatostatin receptor 2 (SSTR2) is overexpressed in breast cancer cells thus making this receptor an attractive target for selective guidance of ligand-conjugated drug liposomes to the tumor site. In this study, a synthetic somatostatin analogue (SST) was used as SSTR2 targeting agent and Diacerein was employed as therapeutic molecule. Diacerein loaded liposomes (DNL) were prepared and they were further decorated with the synthetic and stable analogue of somatostatin (SST-DNL). Fabricated liposomes were nano-size in range and biocompatible. SST-DNL displayed significantly better anti-tumor efficacy as compared to free Diacerein (DN) and DNL in breast cancer models. Enhanced apoptosis in breast cancer cells was detected in SST-DNL treated groups as monitored by cell cycle analysis and changes in expression level of apoptotic/anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-2, Bax, cleaved Caspase 3 and PARP. SST-DNL more effectively inhibited the oncogenic IL-6/IL-6R/STAT3/MAPK/Akt signalling pathways as compared to DN or DNL in cancer cells. In addition, SST-DNL effectively suppressed angiogenesis and cancer cell invasion. In vivo tumor growth in a MDA-MB-231 mouse xenograft model was significantly suppressed following SST-DNL treatment. In xenograft model, immunohistochemistry of Ki-67 and CD-31 indicated that SST-DNL improved the anti-proliferative and anti-angiogenic impacts of Diacerein. In vivo pharmacokinetic studies in rats showed enhanced circulation time in the DNL or SST-DNL treated groups as compared to free DN. Considering all of these findings, we conclude that SST-DNL provides a novel strategy with better efficacy for breast cancer therapy.
Recent endeavors in exploiting vast array of natural phytochemicals to ameliorate colorectal cancer led us to investigate apigenin, a naturally occurring dietary flavone as a potential chemo-therapeutic agent. The present study focuses on establishing apigenin as a potential chemotherapeutic agent for alleviating colorectal cancer and reports the development of a stable liposomal nanocarrier with high encapsulation of the hydrophobic flavone apigenin for enhanced chemotherapeutic effects. The enhanced pharmacological activity of apigenin has been assigned to its ability to interact and subsequently influence membrane properties which also resulted in optimal yield of a stable, rigidified, non-leaky nano-carrier with ideal release kinetics. Extensive testing of drug and its liposomal counterpart for potential clinical chemotherapeutic applications yielded hemocompatibility and cytocompatibility with normal fibroblast cells while enhanced antineoplastic activity was observed in tumor xenograft model. The increased chemotherapeutic potential of liposomal apigenin highlights the clinical potential of apigenin-based vesicles.
Serum metabolic profiling can identify the metabolites responsible for discrimination between doxycycline treated and untreated chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and explain the possible effect of doxycycline in improving the disease conditions. (1)H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)-based metabolomics was used to obtain serum metabolic profiles of 60 add-on doxycycline treated COPD patients and 40 patients receiving standard therapy. The acquired data were analyzed using multivariate principal component analysis (PCA), partial least-squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA), and orthogonal projection to latent structure with discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA). A clear metabolic differentiation was apparent between the pre and post doxycycline treated group. The distinguishing metabolites lactate and fatty acids were significantly down-regulated and formate, citrate, imidazole and l-arginine upregulated. Lactate and folate are further validated biochemically. Metabolic changes, such as decreased lactate level, inhibited arginase activity and lowered fatty acid level observed in COPD patients in response to add-on doxycycline treatment, reflect the anti-inflammatory action of the drug. Doxycycline as a possible therapeutic option for COPD seems promising.
Gold nanorods, by virtue of surface plasmon resonance, convert incident light energy (NIR) into heat energy which induces hyperthermia. We designed unique, multifunctional, gold nanorod embedded block copolymer micelle loaded with GW627368X for targeted drug delivery and photothermal therapy.
Glutathione responsive diblock co-polymer was synthesized by RAFT process forming self-assembled micelle on gold nanorods prepared by seed mediated method and GW627368X was loaded on to the reduction responsive gold nanorod embedded micelle. Photothermal therapy was administered using cwNIR laser (808nm; 4W/cm(2)). Efficacy of nanoformulated GW627368X, photothermal therapy and combination of both were evaluated in vitro and in vivo.
In response to photothermal treatment, cells undergo regulated, patterned cell death by necroptosis. Combining GW627368X with photothermal treatment using single nanoparticle enhanced therapeutic outcome. In addition, these nanoparticles are effective X-ray CT contrast agents, thus, can help in monitoring treatment.
Reduction responsive nanorod embedded micelle containing folic acid and lipoic acid when treated on cervical cancer cells or tumour bearing mice, aggregate in and around cancer cells. Due to high glutathione concentration, micelles degrade releasing drug which binds surface receptors inducing apoptosis. When incident with 808nm cwNIR lasers, gold nanorods bring about photothermal effect leading to hyperthermic cell death by necroptosis. Combination of the two modalities enhances therapeutic efficacy by inducing both forms of cell death.
Our proposed treatment strategy achieves photothermal therapy and targeted drug delivery simultaneously. It can prove useful in overcoming general toxicities associated with chemotherapeutics and intrinsic/acquired resistance to chemo and radiotherapy.
Chronic lower extremity wound is a complicated disease condition of localized injury to skin and its tissues which have plagued many elders worldwide. The ulcer assessment and management is expensive and is burden on health establishment. Currently accurate wound evaluation remains a tedious task as it rely on visual inspection. This paper propose a new method for wound-area detection, using images digitally captured by a hand-held, optical camera. The strategy proposed involves spectral approach for clustering, based on the affinity matrix. The spectral clustering (SC) involves construction of similarity matrix of Laplacian based on Ng-Jorden-Weiss algorithm. Starting with a quadratic method, wound photographs were pre-processed for color homogenization. The first-order statistics filter was then applied to extract spurious regions. The filter was selected based on the performance, evaluated on four quality metrics. Then, the spectral method was used on the filtered images for effective segmentation. The segmented regions were post-processed using morphological operators. The performance of spectral segmentation was confirmed by ground-truth pictures labeled by dermatologists. The SC results were additionally compared with the results of k-means and Fuzzy C-Means (FCM) clustering algorithms. The SC approach on a set of 105 images, effectively delineated targeted wound beds yielding a segmentation accuracy of 86.73 %, positive predictive values of 91.80 %, and a sensitivity of 89.54 %. This approach shows the robustness of tool for ulcer perimeter measurement and healing progression. The article elucidates its potential to be incorporated in patient facing medical systems targeting a rapid clinical assistance.
The study aimed to investigate key intrafollicular prognostic factors among various cytokines and angiogenic molecules for prediction of mature oocytes and good-quality embryos in women with endometriosis undergoing in vitro fertilization (IVF).
Paired follicular fluid and serum samples were collected from 200 women with advanced stage endometriosis and 140 normal ovulating women during oocyte retrieval. The concentrations of cytokines (pro-inflammatory: IL-1β, TNF-α, IL-2, IL-8, IL-12, IFN-γ; anti-inflammatory: IL-4, IL-6, IL-10) and angiogenic molecules (vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), adrenomedullin, angiogenin) were determined in follicular fluid and serum using ELISA. Expression of these molecules was subjected to multivariate analysis for the identification of major predictive markers of oocyte and embryo quality. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was applied to determine the best cutoff point for the discrimination between mature and immature oocytes in these women.
Significant increases in levels of cytokines and angiogenic molecules were observed in women with endometriosis compared to controls (P &lt; 0.001). From the validated partial least squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) model, IL-8, IL-12, and adrenomedullin were identified as the most important factors contributing to endometriosis and were negatively associated with oocyte maturity and embryo quality.
The levels of IL-8, IL-12, and adrenomedullin may be good indicators of embryo and oocyte quality in endometriosis patients undergoing IVF. Further studies are necessary to ascertain the potential of these markers for oocyte and embryo developmental competence which may help improve the chances of a successful IVF in endometriosis patients.
The potentiality of collagen sponge as a skin substitute, derived from mrigal (Cirrhinus cirrhosus) scale has been explored in this study. Acid soluble collagen (ASC) and pepsin soluble collagen (PSC) from the scale of mrigal were isolated and characterized. The yields of ASC and PSC were ∼3% and ∼7% based on the dry weight of scale while the hydroxyproline content was ∼90mg/g. Scanning electron microscope revealed progressive demineralization with EDTA on time dependent scale. Further, the D-Spacing in fibril bundles were calculated to be ∼67nm. Fourier transform infrared and circular dichroism spectra confirmed extracted protein to be collagen I, where both ASC and PSC comprised of two different α-chains (α1 and α2). The denaturation temperature (Td) of the collagen solution was 35°C closer to Td of mammalian collagen. In vitro cell culture studies on the extracted collagen sponge showed efficient cell growth and proliferation. Additionally, co-culture with fibroblast and keratinocyte cells showed development of stratified epidermal layer in vitro. Faster wound healing potential of the extracted collagen in a rat model proved its applicability as a dermal substitute.
Children living with HIV are at increased risk of disease from Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib). Data are limited on the immunogenicity of a two-dose, catch-up schedule for Hib conjugate vaccine (HibCV) among HIV-infected children accessing antiretroviral therapy (ART) late.
The objectives of the study were to: (1) evaluate baseline immunity to Hib and the immunogenicity and safety of two doses of HibCV among HIV-infected Indian children; and (2) document the threshold antibody level required to prevent Hib colonization among HIV-infected children following immunization.
We conducted a prospective cohort study among HIV-infected children 2-15 years of age and HIV-uninfected children 2-5 years of age. HIV-infected children received two doses of HibCV and uninfected children received one. Serum anti-Hib PRP IgG antibodies were measured at baseline and two months after immunization in the HIV-infected children. Nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs were collected at baseline and follow-up.
125 HIV-infected and 44 uninfected children participated. 40% of HIV-infected children were receiving ART and 26% had a viral load &gt;100,000 copies/mL. The geometric mean concentration of serum anti-Hib PRP antibody increased from 0.25 μg/mL at baseline to 2.65 μg/mL after two doses of HibCV, representing a 10.6-fold increase (p&lt;0.0001). 76% percent of HIV-infected children mounted an immune response. Moderate or severe immune suppression, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole prophylaxis, and lower baseline antibody levels were associated with lower post-vaccine serum anti-Hib PRP IgG antibodies. A serum anti-Hib PRP IgG antibody level ≥ 3.3 μg/mL was protective against Hib NP colonization. There were no differences in adverse events between HIV-infected and uninfected children.
Including a catch-up immunization schedule for older HIV infected children in countries introducing Hib vaccines is important. Older HIV-infected children with delayed access to ART and without suppressed viral loads mounted an adequate immune response following two doses of HibCV.
Mucinous carcinoma (MC) of the breast is very rare (∼1-7% of all breast cancers), invasive ductal carcinoma. Presence of pools of extracellular mucin is one of the most important histological features for MC. This paper aims at developing a quantitative computer-aided methodology for automated identification of mucin areas and its percentage using tissue histological images. The proposed method includes pre-processing (i.e., colour space transformation and colour normalization), mucin regions segmentation, post-processing, and performance evaluation. The proposed algorithm achieved 97.74% segmentation accuracy in comparison to ground truths. In addition, the percentage of mucin present in the tissue regions is calculated by the mucin index (MI) for grading MC (pure, moderately, minimally mucinous).
Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is a cytokine present in tumor microenvironment. Elevated level of IL-6 is associated with cancer cell proliferation, angiogenesis and metastasis through fueling STAT3, MAPK and Akt signaling. It promotes epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) through altered expression of N-cadherin, vimentin, snail, twist and E-cadherin leading to cancer metastasis. IL-6 boosts mammosphere formation, self-renewal of stem cells, stemness properties of cancer cells and recruitment of mesenchymal stem cells. IL-6 is also a contributing factor for multidrug resistance in cancer due to gp130/MAPK/STAT3 mediated activation of transcription factors C/EBPβ/δ, overexpression of p-glycoprotein, EMT transition and expansion of stem cells. The in-depth investigation of IL-6 mediated cellular effects and its signaling pathway can provide the new window for future research and clinical development of IL-6 targeted therapy in cancer. Thus, an overview is delivered in this review deciphering the emerging aspect of the predominant influence of IL-6 in malignant transformation, EMT, cancer-associated stem cells and chemoresistance.
Natural origin bioceramics are widely used for bone grafts. In the present study, an eggshell-derived bioceramic scaffold is fabricated by 3D printing as a potential bone-graft analogue. The eggshell, a biological waste material, was mixed with a specific ratio of phosphoric acid and chitosan to form a precursor toward the fabrication of an osteoinductive multiphasic calcium phosphate scaffold via a coagulation-assisted extrusion and sintering for a multiscalar hierarchical porous structure with improved mechanical properties. Physicochemical characterization of the formed scaffolds was carried out for phase analysis, surface morphology, and mechanical properties. A similar scaffold was prepared using a chemically synthesized calcium phosphate powder that was compared with the natural origin one. The higher surface area associated with the interconnected porosity along with multiple phases of the natural origin scaffold facilitated higher cell adhesion and proliferation compared to the chemically synthesized one. Further, the natural origin scaffold displayed relatively higher cell differentiation activity, as is evident by protein and gene expression studies. On subcutaneous implantation for 30 days, promising vascular tissue in-growth was observed, circumventing a major foreign body response. Collagen-rich vascular extracellular matrix deposition and osteocalcin secretion indicated bonelike tissue formation. Finally, the eggshell-derived multiphasic calcium phosphate scaffold displayed improvement in the mechanical properties with higher porosity and osteoinductivity compared to the chemically derived apatite and unveiled a new paradigm for utilization of biological wastes in bone-graft application.
Does investigation of metabolic perturbations in endometrial tissue of women with dormant genital tuberculosis (GTB) during the window of implantation (WOI) assist in improving the understanding of endometrial receptivity?
In dormant GTB cases significant alterations in endometrial tissue metabolites occur, largely related to energy metabolism and amino acid biosynthesis in dormant GTB cases.
As an intracellular pathogen, Mycobacterium tuberculosis strongly influences the metabolism of host cells causing metabolic dysregulation. It is also accepted that dormant GTB impairs the receptive status of the endometrium. Global metabolic profiling is useful for an understanding of disease progression and distinguishing between diseased and non-diseased groups.
Endometrial tissue samples were collected from patients reporting at the tertiary infertility care center during the period September 2011-March 2013. Women having tested positive for GTB were considered as the study group (n = 24). Normal healthy women undergoing sterilization (n = 26) and unexplained infertile women with repeated IVF failure (n = 21) volunteered to participate as controls.
Endometrial tissue samples were collected 6-10 days after confirmation of ovulation. PCR and BACTEC-460 culture were used for diagnosing GTB. Proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR) spectra of tissue were recorded using a 700 MHz Bruker Avance AV III spectrometer. Following phase and baseline correction of all NMR spectra by Bruker Topspin 2.1 software, spectral peak alignment of the data was performed. Multivariate analysis was applied to all spectra and individual metabolites identified and multiple correlation analysis was performed.
Leucine, isoleucine, acetate, lactate, glutamate, glutamine, methionine, lysine, creatine, glycogen, glycine, proline and choline were found to be significantly increased (P &lt; 0.05) in endometrial tissue of women with dormant GTB compared with unexplained infertile women with repeated implantation failure. Valine, citrate, succinate and aspartate were also observed to be significantly up-regulated (P &lt; 0.01). Furthermore, a significant decrease in glucose (P &lt; 0.05), threonine (P &lt; 0.05), tyrosine (P &lt; 0.01) and phenylalanine (P &lt; 0.0001) was observed in women with dormant GTB. Pearson's correlation analysis between the expression of various endometrial receptivity markers and metabolites showed a significant negative correlation (-0.236 to -0.545, P &lt; 0.05). Also, the metabolites were positively correlated with endometrial receptivity markers (0.207 to 0.618, P &lt; 0.05).
It is often difficult to diagnose dormant GTB because it tends to exist without any clinical signs or symptoms. In addition, the diagnosis of GTB by culture remains a challenge due to low detection rates and its paucibacillary nature. Testing for prostate-specific antigen or the Y chromosome in order to account for the possible influences of recent exposure to semen on endometrial metabolism would be important.
The metabolic changes associated with the dormant tubercle infection are of potential relevance to clinicians for the treatment of dormant GTB-related infertility.

To investigate the influence of dormant Mycobacterium tuberculosis on the expression of various endometrial receptivity markers and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF)-signal transducers and activators of transcription 3 (STAT3) signaling pathway. Expression of endometrial receptivity markers and LIF-STAT3 signaling in in vitro decidualized human endometrial stromal cells (hESC) treated with 65 kDa mycobacterial heat shock protein (HSP65) is also explored.
A prospective study.
Tertiary care hospital and reproductive health research unit.
Endometrial tissue samples were collected from 38 women who tested positive for Mycobacterium tuberculosis and 30 normal women with proven fertility undergoing sterilization. In vitro decidualization of hESC was performed.
Endometrial biopsies collected from all women during implantation window and treatment of hESC with HSP65.
Measurement of various endometrial receptivity markers including αvβ3 integrin, E-cadherin, MECA-79, mucin-1, and pinopodes and LIF/LIFR-STAT3 signaling molecules expressed in the endometrium of women with dormant genital tuberculosis (GTB) during implantation window and measured also in HSP65-treated hESC.
Significantly reduced levels of endometrial receptivity markers LIF, LIFR, and pSTAT3 were observed in endometrium of women with dormant GTB as compared with controls. A similar trend was observed under in vitro conditions with decreased level of phosphorylated STAT3 in HSP65-treated hESC. However, no change in the expression of endometrial receptivity markers under in vitro conditions was observed.
Our findings suggest that endometrium of women with dormant GTB is associated with poor receptivity, as evidenced by reduced receptivity markers and aberrant LIF-STAT3 signaling. In vitro treatment of hESC with HSP65 also confirms compromised endometrial decidualization.
Molecular probes were used as markers in the backcross (Czech II X BALB/cPt) X Czech II to determine the positions of six genes on mouse chromosome 16 (MMU 16). The order of the genes mapped is (centromere), protamine-1 (Prm-1), immunoglobulin lambda 1 light chain (Igl-1), preprosomatostatin (Smst), an endogenous mouse mammary tumor virus locus (Mtv-6), and two more distal sequences, superoxide dismutase, cytoplasmic form (Sod-1), and the proto-oncogene sequence Ets-2. The largest recombination frequency between any two adjacent markers is 24 cM, and thus the position of any marker on MMU 16 that is polymorphic between these two strains can be readily determined in this backcross. A region of MMU 16 which corresponds to the Down syndrome region of human chromosome 21 is located near the distal end of the chromosome.
Tamoxifen resistance is a multifaceted phenomenon, characterized by the constitutive activation of multiple signaling cascades that provide an additional survival advantage to cells. Ground studies related to reverse the tamoxifen resistance by employing chemotherapeutic drugs that specifically inhibit proteins, those of aberrantly expressed, are required. Seminal studies showed that p38 signaling and VEGF play crucial role in acquiring resistance to tamoxifen. In this view, we had chosen paclitaxel, a mitotic inhibitor with anti-proliferative effects against a wide array of cancers in this study. Further to mitigate the undesirable complications of paclitaxel (PAC), we employed this drug in combination along with BI2536 (BI), a PLK inhibitor for this study to sensitize the tamoxifen resistant cells to apoptosis. MCF 7/TAM and T-47D/TAM cells were treated with PAC, BI and in combination (BI-PAC) evaluated for its anticancer activity through apoptotic and western blot analysis. Modulatory effects of BI-PAC on p38 inactivation were affirmed through immunofluorescence and drug potential studies. Results reveal that cells were subjected to apoptosis on drug(s) treatment which was confirmed through cytotoxicity, annexin studies. Further, the anti-proliferative effects of the drug(s) were affirmed through nuclear morphological and TUNEL assays. Immunoblot results revealed the upregulation of proapoptotic Bax, cleaved caspase 9 along with Bcl-2, MDM2, Cox-2, and P-Gly down regulation after 24h drug treatments. Moreover, phospho studies further construed the rationale behind the apoptosis and deduced the inactivation of p38 and NF-κB role in inducing apoptosis in drug treated cells. The efficacy of drug combinations in inactivating p38 was evaluated through drug potential studies. Further, BI-PAC treatments showed inhibition of p38 mediated senescence in tamoxifen resistant cells. Overall, our observations provide a new therapeutic combination that sensitizes tamoxifen resistant cells to apoptosis by specifically targeting p38 signaling and its downstream molecules and subsequently reduces extracellular VEGF levels.
Iron oxide nanoparticles have been used for many years as clinical applications. We have developed a rapid immunoaffinity isolation method of CD4+T cells from a mixed cell population of human blood using iron oxide nanoparticles. Anti CD4-antibody has been attached to iron oxide nanoparticles after its surface modification. The antibody tagged iron oxide nanoparticle beads are simply incubated with the mixed cell population of human blood and CD4+T cells are purified using an external magnetic field. The purification level was checked by fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry. The purified CD4+T cells were digested with trypsin with different time periods and the products were analyzed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry, without further fractionation or purification, to obtain its proteome pattern. A database search showed a number of peptide masses matched specific to T-cell peptide masses. These results indicate that iron oxide nanoparticles are useful for CD4+T cell purification, and mass spectrometry based proteolytic fingerprint is simple and swift for identifying putative surface biomarkers from the whole cell surfaces.
How several signaling pathways are coordinated to generate complex organs through regulation of tissue growth and patterning is a fundamental question in developmental biology. The larval trachea of Drosophila is composed of differentiated functional cells and groups of imaginal tracheoblasts that build the adult trachea during metamorphosis. Air sac primordium cells (ASP) are tracheal imaginal cells that form the dorsal air sacs that supply oxygen to the flight muscles of the Drosophila adult. The ASP emerges from the tracheal branch that connects to the wing disc by the activation of both Bnl-FGF/Btl and EGFR signaling pathways. Together, these pathways promote cell migration and proliferation. In this study we demonstrate that Vein (vn) is the EGF ligand responsible for the activation of the EGFR pathway in the ASP. We also find that the Bnl-FGF/Btl pathway regulates the expression of vn through the transcription factor PointedP2 (PntP2). Furthermore, we show that the FGF target gene escargot (esg) attenuates EGFR signaling at the tip cells of the developing ASP, reducing their mitotic rate to allow proper migration. Altogether, our results reveal a link between Bnl-FGF/Btl and EGFR signaling and provide novel insight into how the crosstalk of these pathways regulates migration and growth.

According to the "Toxicological test methods of pesticides for registration" (GB 15670-1995), the conjunctival sacs of 18 health New Zealand rabbits were exposed to 100 µl 20% PQ, which were randomly divided into EGF, CRYO and EGF plus CRYO groups. The routine treatments (normal saline washing and antibiotic eyedrops) were administrated to the injured eyes of 3 groups, at the same time the left eyes of 3 groups were treated with EGF, CRYO and EGF plus CRYO, respectively. The injury of conjunctival, iris and corneal, fluorescent stranded and pathology changes of corneal were observed. The injury score was calculated and the recovery time of corneal injury was recorded.
The recovery time of corneal injury in EGF and EGF plus CRYO groups were 19.50 ± 3.08 and 18.67 ± 2.73 days, respectively which were significantly lower than those (27.33 ± 2.58 and 26.83 ± 3.13 days) in corresponding routine treatment controls (P &lt; 0.05).
EGF and EGF plus CRYO could be used to treat the corneal injury induced by paraquat.
To identify pathways involved in adult lung regeneration, we employ a unilateral pneumonectomy (PNX) model that promotes regenerative alveolarization in the remaining intact lung. We show that PNX stimulates pulmonary capillary endothelial cells (PCECs) to produce angiocrine growth factors that induce proliferation of epithelial progenitor cells supporting alveologenesis. Endothelial cells trigger expansion of cocultured epithelial cells, forming three-dimensional angiospheres reminiscent of alveolar-capillary sacs. After PNX, endothelial-specific inducible genetic ablation of Vegfr2 and Fgfr1 in mice inhibits production of MMP14, impairing alveolarization. MMP14 promotes expansion of epithelial progenitor cells by unmasking cryptic EGF-like ectodomains that activate the EGF receptor (EGFR). Consistent with this, neutralization of MMP14 impairs EGFR-mediated alveolar regeneration, whereas administration of EGF or intravascular transplantation of MMP14(+) PCECs into pneumonectomized Vegfr2/Fgfr1-deficient mice restores alveologenesis and lung inspiratory volume and compliance function. VEGFR2 and FGFR1 activation in PCECs therefore increases MMP14-dependent bioavailability of EGFR ligands to initiate and sustain alveologenesis.
Branching morphogenesis is a widespread mechanism used to increase the surface area of epithelial organs. Many signaling systems steer development of branched organs, but it is still unclear which cellular processes are regulated by the different pathways. We have used the development of the air sacs of the dorsal thorax of Drosophila to study cellular events and their regulation via cell-cell signaling. We find that two receptor tyrosine kinases play important but distinct roles in air sac outgrowth. Fgf signaling directs cell migration at the tip of the structure, while Egf signaling is instrumental for cell division and cell survival in the growing epithelial structure. Interestingly, we find that Fgf signaling requires Ras, the Mapk pathway, and Pointed to direct migration, suggesting that both cytoskeletal and nuclear events are downstream of receptor activation. Ras and the Mapk pathway are also needed for Egf-regulated cell division/survival, but Pointed is dispensable.
The physiological role of any of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor tyrosine kinases has yet to be determined in zebrafish. We isolated a zebrafish homologue of EGFR (egfr) that shows a 63% amino acid overall identity to human EGFR but with 90% amino acid identity in the kinase domain. Whole mount in situ hybridization showed ubiquitous distribution of egfr transcripts during gastrulation, somitogenesis and later stages. When expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells, zebrafish Egfr was a functional receptor that responded to EGF by receptor tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of MAP kinase. The function of zebrafish Egfr in vivo was determined by inhibiting its activity using EGFR kinase inhibitors and antisense morpholinos (MO), which inhibited Egfr kinase activity and translation of egfr messenger RNA into protein, respectively. The zebrafish is a particularly excellent model for studying cardiovascular development because zebrafish are transparent allowing direct visualization of the heart and circulation in the blood vessels. Inhibition of zebrafish Egfr activity in vivo impeded blood flow via the outflow tract into the aorta and impeded circulation in the axial and intersegmental vessels by 80 h post-fertilization. Analysis of the heart showed that the heart chambers and pericardial sacs were dilated and the outflow tracts were narrowed. Together these results suggested that zebrafish Egfr has a cardiovascular function in the developing zebrafish that is required for normal circulation.
The effects of in ovo peptide YY (PYY) or epidermal growth factor (EGF) administration on chick growth, yolk absorption and yolk stalk function in posthatch (0-5 days) meat-type or broiler chicks were determined. At Day 18 of incubation, treated eggs were injected into the air cell with 100 microl of either PYY (Trial 1) or EGF (Trial 2) at a dosage of 600 microg/kg egg weight. Saline-treated control eggs were injected similarly with 0.9% saline. At hatch, 200 microl of (51)Cr-labeled microspheres were injected into chick yolk sacs. Epidermal growth factor increased ileal wet weight adjusted for body weight as well as ileal serosal dry matter. Body weight, feed consumption and excreta weight per bird, and relative weights of the yolk sac, intestine and liver were significantly affected by age of the chick in both trials. Relative radioactivity of the yolk sac, yolk stalk, blood, liver, and kidneys were affected by bird age in Trial 2; however, there were no significant effects due to PYY or EGF treatments on relative radioactivity of the tissues and organs examined. These data suggest that PYY and EGF had no effect on yolk absorption or yolk stalk function through 5 days in the posthatch chick.
Intraluminal epidermal growth factor (EGF) may regulate intestinal growth and function. The ontogeny, localization, and phosphorylation of the EGF receptor in rat small intestine were studied.
EGF-receptor phosphorylation was assayed by antiphosphotyrosine Western blot after EGF administration in vivo and EGF incubation to everted sacs in vitro. EGF-receptor abundance and localization were assayed by Western blot and immunofluorescence using anti-EGF-receptor antibodies.
In vivo, orogastric EGF enhanced EGF-receptor phosphorylation in newborn rat jejunum and liver. However, intraluminal EGF had no effect on EGF-receptor phosphorylation in adult intestine or liver. In vitro, mucosal EGF stimulated a fourfold increase in EGF-receptor phosphorylation in suckling jejunum but not in weanling or adult jejunum. In Western blot, EGF-receptor abundance was similar in 22-day-old fetal, 8-day-old suckling, and adult jejunum. In both crypt and villus, EGF-receptor was localized to the basolateral membrane but not to the apical membrane in fetal, suckling, and adult jejunum.
Mucosal EGF stimulates EGF-receptor phosphorylation in immature but not in mature intestine. These differences are not explained by EGF-receptor abundance or localization and suggest that the greater mucosal permeability of the immature gut may allow EGF to bind to the EGF-receptor in the basolateral membrane to mediate its effects in suckling rat intestine.
Epidermal growth factor (EGF) in rat milk stimulates intestinal growth. We examined the role of EGF-stimulated tyrosine kinase activity in vivo in this process using an affinity-purified anti-phosphotyrosine antibody in Western blot. Jejunal sacs from fasted 8-day-old rat pups were incubated with intraluminal EGF and were then assayed for phosphotyrosyl proteins (p-Tyr) by Western blot. A 170-kDa p-Tyr was present in EGF-treated sacs but not in control. A 190-kDa p-Tyr was constitutively present in control but increased in abundance in EGF-treated sacs. Dose-response experiments demonstrated that the increase in p-Tyr was present at 100 ng/ml EGF, which is within the physiological range. The 170- and 190-kDa p-Tyr was confirmed by immunoprecipitation to be the EGF receptor and c-neu, respectively. A similar response was also observed in the jejunum after orogastric gavage feeding of EGF. By use of indirect immunofluorescence, the EGF receptor was localized primarily to the basolateral membrane of both the crypt and villus epithelium. c-neu was localized primarily in the villus enterocyte basolateral membrane. These data demonstrate that intraluminal EGF stimulates rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of the EGF receptor in vivo and that c-neu is a major substrate of the EGF receptor in suckling jejunum. The basolateral membrane localization of the EGF receptor and c-neu suggests that EGF is rapidly transported across the intestinal epithelium in suckling rat jejunum.
In ovarian cancer, a high ratio of anti-inflammatory M2 to pro-inflammatory M1 macrophages correlates with poor patient prognosis. The mechanisms driving poor tumor outcome as a result of the presence of M2 macrophages in the tumor microenvironment remain unclear and are challenging to study with current techniques. Therefore, in this study we utilized a micro-culture device previously developed by our lab to model concentrated paracrine signaling in order to address our hypothesis that interactions between M2 macrophages and ovarian cancer cells induce tumor cell proliferation. Using the micro-culture device, we determined that co-culture with M2-differentiated primary macrophages or THP-1 increased OVCA433 proliferation by 10-12%. This effect was eliminated with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) or heparin-bound epidermal growth factor (HB-EGF) neutralizing antibodies and HBEGF expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from ovarian cancer patients was 9-fold higher than healthy individuals, suggesting a role for HB-EGF in tumor progression. However, addition of HB-EGF at levels secreted by macrophages or macrophage-conditioned media did not induce proliferation to the same extent, indicating a role for other factors in this process. Matrix metalloproteinase-9, MMP-9, which cleaves membrane-bound HB-EGF, was elevated in co-culture and its inhibition decreased proliferation. Utilizing inhibitors and siRNA against MMP9 in each population, we determined that macrophage-secreted MMP-9 released HB-EGF from macrophages, which increased MMP9 in OVCA433, resulting in a positive feedback loop to drive HB-EGF release and increase proliferation in co-culture. Identification of multi-cellular interactions such as this may provide insight into how to most effectively control ovarian cancer progression.
Development of the eyelid requires coordination of the cellular processes involved in proliferation, cell size alteration, migration, and cell death. C57BL/6J-corneal opacity (B6-Co) mice are mutant mice generated by the administration of N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (100 mg/kg). They exhibit the eyelids open at birth phenotype, abnormal round cell shape from tightened F-actin bundles in leading edge keratinocytes at E16.5, and gradual corneal opacity with neovessels. The tip of the leading edge in B6-Co mice did not move forward, and demonstrated a sharp peak shape without obvious directionality. Analysis of the biological characteristics of B6-Co mice demonstrated that abnormal migration of keratinocytes could affect eyelid development, but proliferation and apoptosis in B6-Co mice had no effect. Mutant gene mapping and sequence analysis demonstrated that in B6-Co mice, adenosine was inserted into the untranslated regions, between 3030 and 3031, in the mRNA 3'-terminal of Fgf10. In addition, guanine 7112 was substituted by adenine in the Mtap1B mRNA, and an A2333T mutation was identified in Mtap1B. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis showed that expression of the Hbegf gene was significantly down-regulated in the eyelids of B6- Co mice at E16.5, compared to B6 mice. However, the expression of Rock1, Map3k1, and Jnk1 genes did not show any significant changes. Abnormal keratinocyte migration and down-regulated expression of the Hbegf gene might be associated with impaired eyelid development in B6-Co mice.
Increased expression of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and its ligands is associated with poor prognosis and chemoresistance in many carcinoma types, but its role in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is unclear. Our aim was to clarify whether mRNA expression of EGFR-ligands was linked to prognosis and cisplatin resistance, and if so, which ligand was most important and how was the expression regulated.
To examine the prognostic effect of EGFR-ligand expression, we analyzed tumorous mRNA expression in 399 HNSCC patients. The intracellular signaling pathways controlling epidermal growth factor (EGF)-induced amphiregulin (AREG) expression were examined in three oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) cell lines. Effect of AREG on cisplatin resistance was examined by viability assays in four-, and by association in 11 OSCC cell lines.
The patients were divided into five groups according to the median mRNA expression levels of four EGFR ligands, i.e. AREG, EGF, heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor (HBEGF) and beta-cellulin (BTC). The number of increased-expressed EGFR-ligands were progressively correlated to five-year survival, even in advanced TNM-stage IV patients, where five-year mortality increased from 26 % if tumor expressed none to one EGFR-ligand, to 45 % in three to four ligand expressing tumors. Thus, staging the tumor according to these EGFR-ligand mRNA expression pattern completely out performed TNM staging in predicting prognosis. Multivariate analysis identified AREG as the dominating predictor, and AREG was overexpressed in OSCC compared to tumors from other sites. Both EGF and HBEGF stimulation induced strong AREG increase in OSCC cell lines, which was partially mediated by the extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 pathway, and negatively regulated by p38, c-Jun N-terminal kinase, and phosphoinositide-3 kinase. Although increased AREG mRNA expression predicted unfavorable prognosis in platinum treated HNSCC patients, AREG did not mediate cisplatin resistance in the OSCC cell lines.
Increased tumorous mRNA expression of four EGFR ligands was progressively associated with poor prognosis in HNSCC. Thus, EGFR-ligands mRNA expression pattern may be a new prognostic biomarker. The tightly regulated EGF-induced AREG mRNA expression was partly lost in the OSCC cell lines and restoring its regulation may be a new target in cancer treatment.
Not applicable as the clinical data of the 498 HNSCC patients and their mRNA expression profiles were collected from the open TCGA database: http://cancergenome.nih.gov/cancersselected/headandneck .
Seven ligands bind to and activate the mammalian epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor (EGFR/ERBB1/HER1): EGF, transforming growth factor-alpha (TGFA), heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor (HBEGF), betacellulin (BTC), amphiregulin (AREG), epiregulin (EREG), and epigen (EPGN). Of these, EGF, TGFA, HBEGF, and BTC are thought to be high-affinity ligands, whereas AREG, EREG, and EPGN constitute low-affinity ligands. This focused review is meant to highlight recent studies related to actions of the individual EGFR ligands, the interesting biology that has been uncovered, and relevant advances related to ligand interactions with the EGFR.
Circulating protein markers were assessed in patients with colorectal cancer (CRC) treated with cetuximab in CALGB 80203 to identify prognostic and predictive biomarkers. Patients with locally advanced or metastatic CRC received FOLFOX or FOLFIRI chemotherapy (chemo) or chemo in combination with cetuximab. Baseline plasma samples from 152 patients were analyzed for six candidate markers [epidermal growth factor (EGF), heparin-binding EGF (HBEGF), epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), HER2, HER3, and CD73]. Analyte levels were associated with survival endpoints using univariate Cox proportional hazards models. Predictive markers were identified using a treatment-by-marker interaction term in the Cox model. Plasma levels of EGF, HBEGF, HER3, and CD73 were prognostic for overall survival (OS) across all patients (KRAS mutant and wild-type). High levels of EGF predicted for lack of OS benefit from cetuximab in KRAS wild-type (WT) patients (chemo HR = 0.98, 95% CI = 0.74-1.29; chemo+cetuximab HR = 1.54, 95% CI = 1.05-2.25; interaction P = 0.045) and benefit from cetuximab in KRAS mutant patients (chemo HR = 1.72, 95% CI = 1.02-2.92; chemo+cetuximab HR = 0.90, 95% CI = 0.67-1.21; interaction P = 0.026). Across all patients, higher HER3 levels were associated with significant OS benefit from cetuximab treatment (chemo HR = 4.82, 95% CI = 1.68-13.84; chemo+cetuximab HR = 0.95, 95% CI = 0.31-2.95; interaction P = 0.046). CD73 was also identified as predictive of OS benefit in KRAS WT patients (chemo HR = 1.28, 95% CI = 0.88-1.84; chemo+cetuximab HR = 0.60, 95% CI = 0.32-1.13; interaction P = 0.049). Although these results are preliminary, and confirmatory studies are necessary before clinical application, the data suggest that HER3 and CD73 may play important roles in the biological response to cetuximab.
To investigate the reaction of versican and heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor (HB-EGF) molecule concentrations to acute radiation exposure in normal bladder and rectal tissue samples in order to gain more insight into the effects of cancer radiotherapy.
Four groups with 6 male adult Swiss Albino mice per group were investigated. The mice bladder and rectum tissue samples were subjected to a 10-Gy single-dose radiation exposure in the pelvic region with a Co-60 teletherapy device and investigated 1, 2, and 7 days after radiation exposure, with 1 reference group which was not exposed to radiation.
In the immunohistochemical examination of the tissue samples with anti-versican and anti-HB-EGF primary antibodies was observed a statistically significant increase 7 days after radiation exposure.
The observed increase of versican and HB-EGF concentrations in the normal tissue matrix after radiation exposure may play a role in the side effects of radiotherapy.
The Notch signaling pathway is crucial for primitive cardiac valve formation by epithelial-mesenchymal transition, and NOTCH1 mutations cause bicuspid aortic valve; however, the temporal requirement for the various Notch ligands and receptors during valve ontogeny is poorly understood.
The aim of this study is to determine the functional specificity of Notch in valve development.
Using cardiac-specific conditional targeted mutant mice, we find that endothelial/endocardial deletion of Mib1-Dll4-Notch1 signaling, possibly favored by Manic-Fringe, is specifically required for cardiac epithelial-mesenchymal transition. Mice lacking endocardial Jag1, Notch1, or RBPJ displayed enlarged valve cusps, bicuspid aortic valve, and septal defects, indicating that endocardial Jag1 to Notch1 signaling is required for post-epithelial-mesenchymal transition valvulogenesis. Valve dysmorphology was associated with increased mesenchyme proliferation, indicating that Jag1-Notch1 signaling restricts mesenchyme cell proliferation non-cell autonomously. Gene profiling revealed upregulated Bmp signaling in Jag1-mutant valves, providing a molecular basis for the hyperproliferative phenotype. Significantly, the negative regulator of mesenchyme proliferation, Hbegf, was markedly reduced in Jag1-mutant valves. Hbegf expression in embryonic endocardial cells could be readily activated through a RBPJ-binding site, identifying Hbegf as an endocardial Notch target. Accordingly, addition of soluble heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor to Jag1-mutant outflow tract explant cultures rescued the hyperproliferative phenotype.
During cardiac valve formation, Dll4-Notch1 signaling leads to epithelial-mesenchymal transition and cushion formation. Jag1-Notch1 signaling subsequently restrains Bmp-mediated valve mesenchyme proliferation by sustaining Hbegf-EGF receptor signaling. Our studies identify a mechanism of signaling cross talk during valve morphogenesis involved in the origin of congenital heart defects associated with reduced NOTCH function.
A critical function for skin is that when damaged it must simultaneously identify the nature of the injury, repair barrier function, and limit the intrusion of pathogenic organisms. These needs are carried out through the detection of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) and a response that includes secretion of cytokines, chemokines, growth factors, and antimicrobial peptides (AMPs). In this study, we analyzed how non-coding double-stranded RNA (dsRNAs) act as a DAMP in the skin and how the human cathelicidin AMP LL-37 might influence growth factor production in response to this DAMP. dsRNA alone significantly increased the expression of multiple growth factors in keratinocytes, endothelial cells, and fibroblasts. Furthermore, RNA sequencing transcriptome analysis found that multiple growth factors increase when cells are exposed to both LL-37 and dsRNA, a condition that mimics normal wounding. Quantitative PCR and/or ELISA validated that growth factors expressed by keratinocytes in these conditions included, but were not limited to, basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF2), heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor (HBEGF), vascular endothelial growth factor C (VEGFC), betacellulin (BTC), EGF, epiregulin (EREG), and other members of the transforming growth factor β superfamily. These results identify a novel role for DAMPs and AMPs in the stimulation of repair and highlight the complex interactions involved in the wound environment.
The present study investigated the expression profiles of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) family, which consists of four transmembrane tyrosine kinase receptors and their eight ligands, in 122 patients with colorectal cancer (CRC) using reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis. On comparison of the CRC primary tumor and matched adjacent normal mucosa (ANM) tissue samples, the mRNA expression levels of ErbB3, but not ErbB1, were significantly increased in CRC tissue samples, compared with those in the ANM tissues. The expression levels of the ligands exhibited opposing trends to their corresponding receptors, including EGF, BTC, AREG, EREG and HB‑EGF, which were increased in the CRC tissues, whereas NRG1 and NGR2 were decreased in thee CRC tissues, compared with those in the AMN tissues. Subsequently, the present study investigated the frequency of K-ras mutations in the patients with CRC. The K‑ras mutations were found to be present in 36.8% (45/122) of the cases, however, no correlation was observed between K‑ras mutations and clinicopathological characteristics. In the CRC tissues, the expression levels of the EGFR family receptors and their ligands were determined in wild-type and mutant K-ras CRC cases. The expression levels of ErbB1, ErbB2, ErbB3, BTC, AREG, EREG, NRG1 and NRG2 were significantly decreased in the mutant K‑ras cases, compared with those in the wild‑type K‑ras cases. These results suggested that the tumorigenesis of CRC with wild‑type K‑ras was mediated through, not only ErbB1, but also through the ErbB2 and ErbB3 pathways. Notably, although ErbB2 does not bind any ErbB ligands, ErbB2 may activate tumorigenesis via a heterodimer, rather than a homodimer. Therefore, the results of the present study suggest that the most effective strategy to target not only ErbB1, but also ErbB2 and ErbB3, is the use of monoclonal antibody treatment.
Heparin-binding epidermal growth factor like growth factor (HB-EGF) is an emerging therapeutic for the regeneration of the tympanic membrane (TM).
Our aim was to determine whether the doses of HB-EGF delivered in a sustained release hydrogel into a middle ear mouse model, would be measurable in the systemic circulation. We also aimed to observe, in the scenario that the intended dose was absorbed directly into the circulation, whether these levels could be measured above the background levels of HB-EGF in the circulation.
A total of 12 mice had transtympanic injections of 5 μg/ml of HB-EGF contained within a previously described novel hydrogel vehicle, while another 12 mice had intravenous delivery of 10 μg/kg of HB-EGF. Intravenous blood samples were collected at 0-, 3-, 24-, 168-, 288- and 720-h post-injection. A double-antibody sandwich one-step process enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to determine the level of HB-EGF in the serum.
No mice in the transtympanic administration group and no mice in the intravenous administration group were found to have blood level measured above that in the controls.
The inability of the positive control to measure levels above background, suggest the total dose used in our studies, even if 100% absorbed into the system circulation is insignificant.
HB-EGF at the doses and delivery method proposed for treatment of chronic TM perforation in a mouse model are likely to have no measurable systemic effect.
Reproduction traits, such as gestation length (GLE), play an important role in dam line breeding in pigs. The objective of our study was to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that are associated with GLE in two pig populations. Genotypes and deregressed breeding values were available for 2081 Dutch Landrace-based (DL) and 2301 Large White-based (LW) pigs. We identified two QTL regions for GLE, one in each population. For DL, three associated SNPs were detected in one QTL region spanning 0.52 Mbp on Sus scrofa chromosome (SSC) 2. For LW, four associated SNPs were detected in one region of 0.14 Mbp on SSC5. The region on SSC2 contains the heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor (HBEGF) gene, which promotes embryo implantation and has been described to be involved in embryo survival throughout gestation. The associated SNP can be used for marker-assisted selection in the studied populations, and further studies of the HBEGF gene are warranted to investigate its role in GLE.
Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are widespread circles of non-coding RNAs with largely unknown function. Because stimulation of mammary cells with the epidermal growth factor (EGF) leads to dynamic changes in the abundance of coding and non-coding RNA molecules, and culminates in the acquisition of a robust migratory phenotype, this cellular model might disclose functions of circRNAs. Here we show that circRNAs of EGF-stimulated mammary cells are stably expressed, while mRNAs and microRNAs change within minutes. In general, the circRNAs we detected are relatively long-lived and weakly expressed. Interestingly, they are almost ubiquitously co-expressed with the corresponding linear transcripts, and the respective, shared promoter regions are more active compared to genes producing linear isoforms with no detectable circRNAs. These findings imply that altered abundance of circRNAs, unlike changes in the levels of other RNAs, might not play critical roles in signaling cascades and downstream transcriptional networks that rapidly commit cells to specific outcomes.
Structural and functional changes of the hippocampus are correlated with psychiatric disorders and cognitive dysfunctions. Genetic deletion of heparin-binding epidermal growth factor-like growth factor (HB-EGF), which is predominantly expressed in cortex and hippocampus, also causes similar psychiatric and cognitive dysfunctions, accompanying down-regulated NMDA receptor signaling. However, little is known of such dysfunctions in hippocampus-specific Hbegf cKO mice.
We successfully developed hippocampus-specific cKO mice by crossbreeding floxed Hbegf and Gng7-Cre knock-in mice, as Gng7 promoter-driven Cre is highly expressed in hippocampal neurons as well as striatal medium spiny neurons. In mice lacking hippocampus Hbegf gene, there was a decreased neurogenesis in the subgranular zone (SGZ) of the dentate gyrus as well as down-regulation of PSD-95/NMDA-receptor-NR1/NR2B subunits and related NMDA receptor signaling. Psychiatric, social-behavioral and cognitive abnormalities were also observed in hippocampal cKO mice. Interestingly, D-cycloserine and nefiracetam, positive allosteric modulators (PAMs) of NMDA receptor reversed the apparent reduction in NMDA receptor signaling and most behavioral abnormalities. Furthermore, decreased SGZ neurogenesis in hippocampal cKO mice was reversed by nefiracetam.
The present study demonstrates that PAMs of NMDA receptor have pharmacotherapeutic potentials to reverse down-regulated NMDA receptor signaling, neuro-socio-cognitive abnormalities and decreased neurogenesis in hippocampal cKO mice.
Implanting cattle with steroids significantly enhances feed efficiency, rate of gain, and muscle growth. However, the mechanisms responsible for these improvements in muscle growth have not been fully elucidated. Trenbolone acetate (TBA), a testosterone analog, has been shown to increase proliferation rate in bovine satellite cell (BSC) cultures. The classical genomic actions of testosterone have been well characterized; however, our results indicate that TBA may also initiate a quicker, nongenomic response that involves activation of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR) resulting in activation of matrix metalloproteinases 2 and 9 (MMP2 and MMP9) that release membrane-bound heparin-binding epidermal growth factor-like growth factor (hbEGF), which then binds to and activates the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and/or erbB2. Furthermore, the EGFR has been shown to regulate expression of the IGF-1 receptor (IGF-1R), which is well known for its role in modulating muscle growth. To determine whether this nongenomic pathway is potentially involved in TBA-stimulated BSC proliferation, we analyzed the effects of treating BSC with guanosine 5'-O-2-thiodiphosphate (GDPβS), an inhibitor of all GPCR; a MMP2 and MMP9 inhibitor (MMPI); CRM19, a specific inhibitor of hbEGF; AG1478, a specific EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor; AG879, a specific erbB2 kinase inhibitor; and AG1024, an IGF-1R tyrosine kinase inhibitor on TBA-stimulated proliferation rate (H-thymidine incorporation). Assays were replicated at least 9 times for each inhibitor experiment using BSC cultures obtained from at least 3 different animals. Bovine satellite cell cultures were obtained from yearling steers that had no previous exposure to androgenic or estrogenic compounds. As expected, BSC cultures treated with 10 n TBA showed ( &lt; 0.05) increased proliferation rate when compared with control cultures. Additionally, treatment with 5 ng hbEGF/mL stimulated proliferation in BSC cultures ( &lt; 0.05). Treatment with GDPβS, MMPI, CRM197, AG1024, AG1478, and/or AG879 all suppressed ( &lt; 0.05) TBA-induced increases in proliferation. These data indicate that TBA likely initiates a nongenomic response involving GPCR, MMP2 and MMP9, hbEGF, EGFR, erbB2, and IGF-1R, which may play a role in TBA-mediated increases in BSC proliferation.
Fingolimod (FTY720) is the first sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) receptor modulator approved for the treatment of multiple sclerosis. The phosphorylated active metabolite FTY720-phosphate (FTY-P) interferes with lymphocyte trafficking. In addition, it accumulates in the CNS and reduces brain atrophy in multiple sclerosis (MS), and neuroprotective effects are hypothesized.
Human primary astrocytes as well as human astrocytoma cells were stimulated with FTY-P or S1P. We analyzed gene expression by a genome-wide microarray and validated induced candidate genes by quantitative PCR (qPCR) and ELISA. To identify the S1P-receptor subtypes involved, we applied a membrane-impermeable S1P analog (dihydro-S1P), receptor subtype specific agonists and antagonists, as well as RNAi silencing.
FTY-P induced leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), interleukin 11 (IL11), and heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor (HBEGF) mRNA, as well as secretion of LIF and IL11 protein. In order to mimic an inflammatory milieu as observed in active MS lesions, we combined FTY-P application with tumor necrosis factor (TNF). In the presence of this key inflammatory cytokine, FTY-P synergistically induced LIF, HBEGF, and IL11 mRNA, as well as secretion of LIF and IL11 protein. TNF itself induced inflammatory, B-cell promoting, and antiviral factors (CXCL10, BAFF, MX1, and OAS2). Their induction was blocked by FTY-P. After continuous exposure of cells to FTY-P or S1P for up to 7 days, the extent of induction of neurotrophic factors and the suppression of TNF-induced inflammatory genes declined but was still detectable. The induction of neurotrophic factors was mediated via surface S1P receptors 1 (S1PR1) and 3 (S1PR3).
We identified effects of FTY-P on astrocytes, namely induction of neurotrophic mediators (LIF, HBEGF, and IL11) and inhibition of TNF-induced inflammatory genes (CXCL10, BAFF, MX1, and OAS2). This supports the view that a part of the effects of fingolimod may be mediated via astrocytes.
The normal process of epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) is subverted by carcinoma cells to facilitate metastatic spread. Cancer cells rarely undergo a full conversion to the mesenchymal phenotype, and instead adopt positions along the epithelial-mesenchymal axis, a propensity we refer to as epithelial mesenchymal plasticity (EMP). EMP is associated with increased risk of metastasis in breast cancer and consequent poor prognosis. Drivers towards the mesenchymal state in malignant cells include growth factor stimulation or exposure to hypoxic conditions.
We have examined EMP in two cell line models of breast cancer: the PMC42 system (PMC42-ET and PMC42-LA sublines) and MDA-MB-468 cells. Transition to a mesenchymal phenotype was induced across all three cell lines using epidermal growth factor (EGF) stimulation, and in MDA-MB-468 cells by hypoxia. We used RNA sequencing to identify gene expression changes that occur as cells transition to a more-mesenchymal phenotype, and identified the cell signalling pathways regulated across these experimental systems. We then used inhibitors to modulate signalling through these pathways, verifying the conclusions of our transcriptomic analysis.
We found that EGF and hypoxia both drive MDA-MB-468 cells to phenotypically similar mesenchymal states. Comparing the transcriptional response to EGF and hypoxia, we have identified differences in the cellular signalling pathways that mediate, and are influenced by, EMT. Significant differences were observed for a number of important cellular signalling components previously implicated in EMT, such as HBEGF and VEGFA. We have shown that EGF- and hypoxia-induced transitions respond differently to treatment with chemical inhibitors (presented individually and in combinations) in these breast cancer cells. Unexpectedly, MDA-MB-468 cells grown under hypoxic growth conditions became even more mesenchymal following exposure to certain kinase inhibitors that prevent growth-factor induced EMT, including the mTOR inhibitor everolimus and the AKT1/2/3 inhibitor AZD5363.
While resulting in a common phenotype, EGF and hypoxia induced subtly different signalling systems in breast cancer cells. Our findings have important implications for the use of kinase inhibitor-based therapeutic interventions in breast cancers, where these heterogeneous signalling landscapes will influence the therapeutic response.
Fibulin-4 is an extracellular matrix protein that is essential for proper assembly of arterial elastic fibers. Mutations in fibulin-4 cause cutis laxa with thoracic aortic aneurysms (TAAs). Sixty percent of TAAs occur in the ascending aorta (AA). Newborn mice lacking fibulin-4 (Fbln4(-/-)) have aneurysms in the AA, but narrowing in the descending aorta (DA), and are a unique model to investigate locational differences in aneurysm susceptibility. We measured mechanical behavior and gene expression of AA and DA segments in newborn Fbln4(-/-) and Fbln4(+/+) mice. Fbln4(-/-) AA has increased diameters compared with Fbln4(+/+) AA and Fbln4(-/-) DA at most applied pressures, confirming genotypic and locational specificity of the aneurysm phenotype. When diameter compliance and tangent modulus were calculated from the mechanical data, we found few significant differences between genotypes, suggesting that the mechanical response to incremental diameter changes is similar, despite the fragmented elastic fibers in Fbln4(-/-) aortas. Fbln4(-/-) aortas showed a trend toward increased circumferential stretch, which may be transmitted to smooth muscle cells (SMCs) in the wall. Gene expression data suggest activation of pathways for SMC proliferation and inflammation in Fbln4(-/-) aortas compared with Fbln4(+/+). Additional genes in both pathways, as well as matrix metalloprotease-8 (Mmp8), are upregulated specifically in Fbln4(-/-) AA compared with Fbln4(+/+) AA and Fbln4(-/-) DA. Mmp8 is a neutrophil collagenase that targets type 1 collagen, and upregulation may be necessary to allow diameter expansion in Fbln4(-/-) AA. Our results provide molecular and mechanical targets for further investigation in aneurysm pathogenesis.
Due to their high abundance and pharmacological relevance there is a growing demand for the efficient production of functional membrane proteins. In this context, cell-free protein synthesis represents a valuable alternative that allows for the high-throughput synthesis of functional membrane proteins. Here, we demonstrate the potential of our cell-free protein synthesis system, based on lysates from cultured Spodoptera frugiperda 21 cells, to produce pro- and eukaryotic membrane proteins with individual topological characteristics in an automated fashion. Analytical techniques, including confocal laser scanning microscopy, fluorescence detection of eYFP fusion proteins in a microplate reader and in-gel fluorescence of statistically incorporated fluorescent amino acid derivatives were employed. The reproducibility of our automated synthesis approach is underlined by coefficients of variation below 7.2%. Moreover, the functionality of the cell-free synthesized potassium channel KcsA was analyzed electrophysiologically. Finally, we expanded our cell-free membrane protein synthesis system by an orthogonal tRNA/synthetase pair for the site-directed incorporation of p-Azido-l-phenylalanine based on stop codon suppression. Incorporation was optimized by performance of a two-dimensional screening with different Mg(2+) and lysate concentrations. Subsequently, the selective modification of membrane proteins with incorporated p-Azido-l-phenylalanine was exemplified by Staudinger ligation with a phosphine-based fluorescence dye.
Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is associated with loss of neurons and glial cells in the enteric nervous system (ENS). Our goal was to determine whether enteric neural stem cell (NSC) transplantation, in conjunction with heparin-binding epidermal growth factor-like growth factor (HB-EGF), could protect against experimental NEC.
In vitro, HB-EGF on NSC proliferation and migration, and the effects of receptors utilized by HB-EGF to exert these effects, were determined. In vivo, mouse pups were exposed to experimental NEC and treated with NSC alone, HB-EGF alone, NSC+HB-EGF, or HB-EGF overexpressing NSC. NSC engraftment and differentiation into neurons in the ENS, intestinal injury, intestinal permeability, and intestinal motility were determined.
HB-EGF promoted NSC proliferation via ErbB-1 receptors and enhanced NSC migration via ErbB-1, ErbB-4, and Nardilysin receptors. HB-EGF significantly enhanced the engraftment of transplanted NSC into the ENS during NEC. NSC transplantation significantly reduced NEC incidence and improved gut barrier function and intestinal motility, and these effects were augmented by simultaneous administration of HB-EGF or by transplantation of HB-EGF overexpressing NSC.
HB-EGF promotes NSC proliferation and migration. HB-EGF and NSC reduce intestinal injury and improve gut barrier function and intestinal motility in experimental NEC. Combined HB-EGF and NSC transplantation may represent a potential future therapy to prevent NEC.
Mechanisms underlying ovarian cancer initiation and progression are unclear. Herein, we report that the Yes-associated protein (YAP), a major effector of the Hippo tumor suppressor pathway, interacts with ERBB signaling pathways to regulate the initiation and progression of ovarian cancer. Immunohistochemistry studies indicate that YAP expression is associated with poor clinical outcomes in patients. Overexpression or constitutive activation of YAP leads to transformation and tumorigenesis in human ovarian surface epithelial cells, and promotes growth of cancer cells in vivo and in vitro. YAP induces the expression of epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptors (EGFR, ERBB3) and production of EGF-like ligands (HBEGF, NRG1 and NRG2). HBEGF or NRG1, in turn, activates YAP and stimulates cancer cell growth. Knockdown of ERBB3 or HBEGF eliminates YAP effects on cell growth and transformation, whereas knockdown of YAP abrogates NRG1- and HBEGF-stimulated cell proliferation. Collectively, our study demonstrates the existence of HBEGF &amp; NRGs/ERBBs/YAP/HBEGF &amp; NRGs autocrine loop that controls ovarian cell tumorigenesis and cancer progression.
Objective: To investigate the effect and mechanism of CRM197, the heparin binding-epidermal growth factor-like growth factor (HB-EGF) inhibitor, on the reverse of the resistance of ovarian cancer to paclitaxel. Methods: (1)The effect of CRM197 on the 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC(50)) of human ovarian carcinoma cell line A2780 and paclitaxel-resistant ovarian carcinoma cell line A2780/Taxol was tested by methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium (MTT) assay. Western blot was used to detect the effect of CRM197 on the expression of HB-EGF, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and plasma membrane glycoprotein (P-gp) protein in A2780 and A2780/Taxol cells. Real-time PCR was used to examine the MDR1 mRNA expression in these cells. (2) A2780/Taxol cells were divided into 4 groups, including the cells transfected with empty vector and saline treatment (empty vector group), MDR1 small interference RNA (siRNA) vector and saline treatment (MDR1 siRNA group), empty vector and CRM197 treatment (empty vector+CRM197 group) and MDR1 siRNA vector and CRM197 treatment (MDR1 siRNA+CRM197 group), respectively. Flow cytometry was used to detecte the effect of intracellular rhodomine 123 (Rh123) accumulation, and caspase-3 activity assay was used to test the effect of apoptosis in four groups of A2780/Taxol cells. (3) In experiments in vivo, A2780/Taxol cells were inoculated to nude mouse subcutaneously to determine the EGFR and P-gp protein expression following CRM197 treatment by immunohistochemistry. Results: (1) In vitro, MTT examination showed that the IC(50) of A2780/Taxol cells to paclitaxel in A2780/Taxol+CRM197 group [(6.4±0.3) μmol/L] was significantly lower than the IC(50) in A2780/Taxol group [ (34.1±0.5) μmol/L, P&lt;0.01], and the reveral fold of CRM197 was 5.3. The expression level of HB-EGF protein in A2780/Taxol+CRM197 group (1.44±0.29) was significantly lower than HB-EGF protein in A2780/Taxol group (2.72±0.32), respectively (P&lt;0.05). The expression level of EGFR protein (0.71±0.25) and P-gp protein (0.82±0.19) in A2780/Taxol+CRM197 group was significantly lower than EGFR protein (1.87±0.31) and P-gp protein (1.84±0.27) of A2780/Taxol group (P&lt;0.05). Compared with A2780/Taxol group (1.78±0.27) , MDR1 mRNA was significantly down-regulated in A2780/Taxol+CRM197 group (0.79±0.13, P&lt;0.05). (2) The fluorescence intensity of Rh123 of the A2780/Taxol cells in empty vector group, MDR1 siRNA group,empty vector+CRM197 group, MDR1 siRNA+CRM197 group was 33.4±1.6, 56.3±3.3, 43.5±3.1,100.4±7.4, and the pNA of the A2780/Taxol cells was (11.4±1.2) , (52.8±0.9) , (71.2±3.6) , (82.7±3.8) μmol/L. The expression levels in MDR1 siRNA+CRM197 group were both higher than the expression levels in empty vector+CRM197 group, and the expression levels in empty vector+CRM197 group, MDR1 siRNA group were both higher than the expression levels in empty vector group (P&lt;0.05). (3) In vivo, the expression scores of EGFR protein in A2780/Taxol+CRM197 tumors (4.4±1.4) were lower than that in A2780/Taxol tumors (10.2±3.1, P&lt;0.05). The expression scores of P-gp protein in A2780/Taxol+CRM197 tumors (3.8±1.1) were lower than that in A2780/Taxol tumors (8.8±2.7, P&lt;0.05). Conclusion: CRM197 reverses the resistance of ovarian cancer to paclitaxel by increasing caspase-3 activity to advance apoptosis via EGFR/MDR1/P-gp pathway.

Early embryonic losses before implantation account for the highest rates of reproductive failure in mammals, in particular when in vitro-produced embryos are transferred. In the present study, we used molecular biology techniques (real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction), classical immunohistochemical staining coupled with confocal microscopy and proteomic analysis (multiple reaction monitoring and western blot analysis) to investigate the role of four growth factors in embryo-uterine interactions during blastocyst development. Supported by a validated embryo transfer model, the study investigated: (1) the expression of stem cell factor (SCF), stanniocalcin-1 (STC1), connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) and heparin-binding epidermal growth factor-like growth factor (HB-EGF) in bovine uterine fluid; (2) the presence of SCF, STC1, CTGF and HB-EGF mRNA and protein in the bovine endometrium and embryos; and (3) the existence of reciprocal regulation between endometrial and embryonic expression of SCF, STC1, CTGF and HB-EGF. The results suggest that these growth factors most likely play an important role during preimplantation embryo development in cattle. The information obtained from the present study can contribute to improving the performance of in vitro culture technology in cattle and other species.
BK-UM (CRM197) is a mutant form of diphtheria toxin and a specific inhibitor of heparin-binding epidermal growth factor-like growth factor (HB-EGF). We assessed the safety, pharmacokinetics, recommended dose, and efficacy of BK-UM in patients with recurrent ovarian cancer (OC) or peritoneal cancer (PC), and measured HB-EGF levels in serum and abdominal fluid after BK-UM administration.
Eleven patients with advanced or recurrent OC or PC were enrolled and treated with BK-UM via the intraperitoneal route. The dose was escalated (1.0, 2.0, 3.3, and 5.0 mg/m(2)) using a 3 + 3 design.
Eight of 11 patients completed treatment. No dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) was experienced at dose levels 1 (1.0 mg/m(2)) and 2 (2.0 mg/m(2)). Grade 3 transient hypotension as an adverse event (defined as a DLT in the present study) was observed in two of four patients at dose level 3 (3.3 mg/m(2)). Treatment with BK-UM was associated with decreases in HB-EGF levels in serum and abdominal fluid in seven of 11 patients and five of eight patients, respectively. Clinical outcomes included a partial response in one patient, stable disease in five patients, and progressive disease in five patients.
BK-UM was well tolerated at doses of 1.0 and 2.0 mg/m(2), with evidence for clinical efficacy in patients with recurrent OC or PC. A dose of 2.0 mg/m(2) BK-UM is recommended for subsequent clinical trials.
This trial was prospectively performed as an investigator-initiated clinical trial. The trial numbers are UMIN000001002 and UMIN000001001, with registration dates of 1/30/2008 and 2/4/2008, respectively. UMIN000001001 was registered as a trial for the continuous administration of BK-UM after UMIN000001002 .
We aim to demonstrate that regeneration of chronic tympanic perforations with heparin binding epidermal growth factor like growth factor (HB-EGF) delivered by an injectable hydrogel restored hearing to levels similar to that of non-perforated tympanic membranes. Chronic tympanic membrane perforation is currently managed as an outpatient surgery with tympanoplasty. Due to the costs of this procedure in the developed world and a lack of accessibility and resources in the developing countries, there is a great need for a new treatment that does not require surgery. Here we show, in a mouse model through measurement of auditory brainstem response and distortion product otoacoustic emissions that tympanic perforations lead to hearing loss and this can be predominantly recovered with HB-EGF treatment (5ug/ml). Our animal model suggests a return to function between two and six months after treatment. Auditory brainstem response thresholds had returned to the control levels at two months but the distortion product otoacoustic emissions returned between two and six months. We also show how the vibration characteristics of the regenerated tympanic membrane, as measured by laser Doppler vibrometry, can be similar to that of an unperforated tympanic membrane. Using the best available methods for pre-clinical evaluation in animal models, it is likely that HB-EGF like growth factor treatment leads to regeneration of chronic tympanic membrane perforations and restoration of the tympanic membrane to normal function, suggesting a potential route for non-surgical treatment.
Cell culture microenvironment and hepatocyte-specific three-dimensional tissue-engineering scaffold play important roles for bioartificial liver devices. In the present study, highly porous sponge scaffolds composed of chitosan (CS) and galactosylated hyaluronic acid (GHA, galactose moieties were covalently coupled with hyaluronic acid through ethylenediamine), were prepared by freezing-drying technique. Because the growth factors specifically bind to heparin with a high affinity and biological stability of the growth factors are modulated by heparin. Heparin was added into CS/GHA scaffold under mild conditions. The effects of heparin on the morphology, structure, porosity, mechanical properties of the CS/GHA/heparin scaffold were studied. CS/GHA scaffold containing heparin maintains the porous structure and good mechanical properties. Furthermore, addition of heparin with the growth factors into the scaffold resulted in a significantly improved the microenvironment of cell growth and prolonged liver functions of the hepatocytes such as albumin secretion, urea synthesis and ammonia elimination. These results indicate that this CS/GHA/heparin scaffold is a potential candidate for liver tissue engineering.
Aberrant epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor (EGFR) signaling contributes to neoplastic initiation and progression in lung. Mutated EGFR has become as an important therapeutic target in lung cancer, whereas targeted treatment is not available for wild-type EGFR or its ligands. In this study, we found that heparin-binding (HB)-EGF, a member of the EGF family, was highly expressed in a subset of lung cancer, proliferation of which was dependent on HB-EGF signaling. Silencing of HB-EGF with RNA interference inhibited cell cycle progression in lung cancer cells. We observed that, upon HB-EGF induction, CITED4 was induced through a signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3)-dependent pathway, regulating cell proliferation. CITED4 interacted with MYC and potentiated MYC-mediated transactivation of the CCND1 promoter, leading to cell cycle progression. Correlation analysis revealed that HB-EGF and CITED4 were significantly positively associated in primary lung tumors, and expression of HB-EGF predicted a poor survival outcome in patients. In vitro and in vivo experiments revealed that pharmacological inhibition of HB-EGF with CRM197 significantly attenuated tumor cell growth. Thus, CITED4 functions as a molecular switch in HB-EGF-induced growth control, and HB-EGF provides a novel therapeutic target for lung cancer intervention.Oncogene advance online publication, 16 January 2017; doi:10.1038/onc.2016.465.
Alpha-momorcharin (α-MMC), a type I ribosome inactivating protein, has attracted a great deal attention because of its antitumor activity. However, the cytotoxicity of α-MMC is limited due to insufficient cellular internalization in cancer cells. To enhance the cytotoxicity of α-MMC, a heparin-binding domain derived from HB-EGF (named HBP) was used as a cell-penetrating peptide and fused to the C-terminus of α-MMC. This novel α-MMC-HBP fusion protein was expressed and purified with a Ni(2+) -resin. The N-glycosidase activity and DNase activity assay indicated that the introduction of HBP did not interfere with the intrinsic bioactivities of α-MMC. HBP was able to efficiently carry α-MMC into the tested cancer cells and significantly enhance the cytotoxic effects of α-MMC in a dose-dependent manner. This enhanced cytotoxic ability occurred due to the higher level of cell apoptosis induced by α-MMC-HBP, which was demonstrated in western blot analysis in which α-MMC-HBP triggered caspase 8, caspase 9, casapase 3 and PARP more intensely than α-MMC alone. α-MMC-HBP led to an upregulation of cleaved PARP and an increase in the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio. Our study provided a new practical way to greatly improve the antitumor activity of α-MMC, which could significantly expand the pharmaceutical applications of α-MMC.

Molecularly targeted therapies benefit approximately 15-20% of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients carrying specific drug-sensitive mutations. Thus, there is a clinically unmet need for the identification of novel targets for drug development. Here, we performed RNA-deep sequencing to identify altered gene expression between malignant and non-malignant lung tissue. Matrix Metalloproteinase 14 (MMP14), a membrane-bound proteinase, was significantly up-regulated in the tumor epithelial cells and intratumoral myeloid compartments in both mouse and human NSCLC. Overexpression of a soluble dominant negative MMP14 (DN-MMP14) or pharmacological inhibition of MMP14 blocked invasion of lung cancer cells through a collagen I matrix in vitro and reduced tumor incidence in an orthotopic K-Ras(G12D/+)p53(-/-) mouse model of lung cancer. Additionally, MMP14 activity mediated proteolytic processing and activation of Heparin-Binding EGF-like Growth Factor (HB-EGF), stimulating the EGFR signaling pathway to increase proliferation and tumor growth. This study highlights the potential for development of therapeutic strategies that target MMP14 in NSCLC with particular focus on MMP14-HB-EGF axis.
Antibodies and peptides are often used to home nanoparticles (NPs) to specific cells. Here in this work, we have used recombinant receptor-binding domain of diphtheria toxin (RDT) as a homing molecule for NPs. Diphtheria toxin binds to heparin binding EGF-like growth factor (HB-EGF) through its receptor-binding domain. HB-EGF is often overexpressed as cell surface molecule in various types of cancer. We have prepared monodispersed, spherical PLGA NPs and coated these NPs with RDT. These NPs are characterized by FESEM and FT-IR spectroscopy. Using flow cytometry and fluorescence spectroscopy, we show that coating with RDT increases cellular uptake of PLGA NPs. We further show that RDT-coated nanoparticles are internalized through clathrin-dependent receptor-mediated endocytosis that can be reduced by specific inhibitor. These RDT-coated nanoparticles (RDT-NP) were further used for preferential delivery of Irinotecan, a chemotherapeutic agent, to cells overexpressing HB-EGF. We show that receptor-mediated enhanced uptake of RDT-NPs increases the potency of irinotecan in these cells.
Gastric cancer remains a major health concern, and improvement of the therapeutic options is crucial. Treatment with targeted therapeutics such as the EGFR-targeting antibody cetuximab or the HER2-targeting antibody trastuzumab is either ineffective or moderately effective in this disease, respectively. In this study, we analysed the involvement of the HER receptor ligands amphiregulin (AREG), epidermal growth factor (EGF), heparin-binding epidermal growth factor (HB-EGF) and transforming growth factor alpha (TGFα) in the responsiveness of gastric cancer cell lines to cetuximab and trastuzumab.
A panel of 11 gastric cancer cell lines was characterized for cetuximab and trastuzumab sensitivity, ligand secretion and expression and activation of the HER receptors using WST-1 cell proliferation assays, ELISAs and Western blot analyses. We further investigated the effects of an exogenous ligand application on the cetuximab and trastuzumab sensitivity.
We found no correlation between TGFα secretion and the sensitivity to cetuximab or trastuzumab. For AREG, we confirmed previous results indicating that this ligand is a positive predictor of cetuximab sensitivity. Exogenous HB-EGF was effective in rescuing sensitive cell lines from inhibition of cell proliferation by both, cetuximab and trastuzumab.
Our data indicate that HB-EGF may be a useful marker for the prediction of trastuzumab sensitivity in gastric cancer.
Retraction of the type IV pilus (Tfp) mediates DNA uptake, motility, and social and infection behavior in a wide variety of prokaryotes. To date, investigations into Tfp retraction-dependent activities have used a mutant deleted of PilT, the ATPase motor protein that causes the pilus fiber to retract. ΔpilT cells are nontransformable, nonmotile, and cannot aggregate into microcolonies. We tested the hypothesis that these retraction-dependent activities are sensitive to the strength of PilT enzymatic activity by using the pathogen Neisseria gonorrhoeae as a model. We constructed an N. gonorrhoeae mutant with an amino acid substitution in the PilT Walker B box (a substitution of cysteine for leucine at position 201, encoded by pilTL201C). Purified PilTL201C forms a native hexamer, but mutant hexamers hydrolyze ATP at half the maximal rate. N. gonorrhoeae pilTL201C cells produce Tfp fibers, crawl at the same speed as the wild-type (wt) parent, and are equally transformable. However, the social behavior of pilTL201C cells is intermediate between the behaviors of wt and ΔpilT cells. The infection behavior of pilTL201C is also defective, due to its failure to activate the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor (HB-EGF) pathway. Our study indicates that pilus retraction, per se, is not sufficient for N. gonorrhoeae microcolony formation or infectivity; rather, these activities are sensitive to the strength of PilT enzymatic activity. We discuss the implications of these findings for Neisseria pathogenesis in the context of mechanobiology.
Type IV pili are fibers expressed on the surface of many bacteria. Neisseria gonorrhoeae cells crawl, take up DNA, and communicate with each other and with human cells by retracting these fibers. Here, we show that an N. gonorrhoeae mutant expressing an enzymatically weakened type IV pilus retraction motor still crawls and takes up DNA normally. However, mutant cells exhibit abnormal social behavior, and they are less infective because they fail to activate the epidermal growth factor receptor. Our study shows that N. gonorrhoeae social and infection behaviors are sensitive to the strength of the retraction motor enzyme.
The potential effect of icariside II on dexamethasone-induced osteoblast cell damages was evaluated here. In MC3T3-E1 osteoblastic cells and the primary murine osteoblasts, co-treatment with icariside II dramatically attenuated dexamethasone- induced cell death and apoptosis. Icariside II activated Akt signaling, which is required for its actions in osteoblasts. Akt inhibitors (LY294002, perifosine and MK-2206) almost abolished icariside II-induced osteoblast cytoprotection against dexamethasone. Further studies showed that icariside II activated Nrf2 signaling, downstream of Akt, to inhibit dexamethasone-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in MC3T3-E1 cells and primary osteoblasts. On the other hand, Nrf2 shRNA knockdown inhibited icariside II-induced anti-dexamethasone cytoprotection in MC3T3-E1 cells. Finally, we showed that icariside II induced heparin-binding EGF (HB-EGF) production and EGFR trans-activation in MC3T3-E1 cells. EGFR inhibition, via anti-HB-EGF antibody, EGFR inhibitor AG1478 or EGFR shRNA knockdown, almost blocked icariside II-induced Akt-Nrf2 activation in MC3T3-E1 cells. Collectively, we conclude that icariside II activates EGFR-Akt-Nrf2 signaling and protects osteoblasts from dexamethasone. Icariside II might have translational value for the treatment of dexamethasone-associated osteoporosis/osteonecrosis.
The tests for diagnosing latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) are limited by a poor predictive value for identifying people at the highest risk for progressing to active tuberculosis (TB) and have various sensitivities and specificities in different populations. Identifying a more robust signature for LTBI is important for TB prevention and elimination. A pilot study was conducted with samples from immigrants to the United States that were screened for LTBI by the three commercially approved tests, namely, the tuberculin skin test (TST), the Quantiferon-TB Gold in-tube (QFT-GIT), and the T-SPOT.TB (T-SPOT). QFT-GIT supernatants from 13 people with concordant positive results and 26 people with concordant negative results were analyzed via the highly multiplexed SOMAscan proteomic assay. The proteins in the stimulated supernatants that distinguished LTBI from controls included interleukin-2 (IL-2), monocyte chemotactic protein 2 (MCP-2), interferon gamma inducible protein-10 (IP-10), interferon gamma (IFN-γ), tumor necrosis factor superfamily member 14 (TNFSF14, also known as LIGHT), monokine induced by gamma interferon (MIG), and granzyme B (P &lt;0.00001). In addition, antigen stimulation increased the expression of heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor (HB-EGF) and activin AB in LTBI samples. In nil tubes, LIGHT was the most significant marker (P &lt;0.0001) and was elevated in LTBI subjects. Other prominent markers in nonstimulated QFT-GIT supernatants were the complement-3 components C3b, iC3b, and C3d, which were upregulated in LTBI and markedly decreased upon stimulation. We found known and novel proteins that warrant further studies for developing improved tests for LTBI, for predicting progression to active disease, and for discriminating LTBI from active TB.
In contrast to hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), the therapeutic potential and pathophysiologic roles of heparin-binding epidermal growth factor-like growth factor (HB-EGF) in liver diseases remain relatively unknown. To address the lack of effective pharmacologic treatments for cholestatic liver injuries, as well as to clarify the biologic features of these growth factors, we explored the effects of HB-EGF and HGF in mice with cholestatic liver injury induced by bile duct ligation (BDL). The mice were assessed 3, 5 and/or 14 days after BDL (acute, subacute and/or chronic phases, respectively) and intravenous injection of adenoviral vector expressing LacZ (control), HB-EGF, HGF, or HB-EGF and HGF. HB-EGF, HGF, or a combination of the growth factors exerted potent antioncotic (antinecrotic), antiapoptotic, anticholestatic, and regenerative effects on hepatocytes in vivo, whereas no robust antiapoptotic or regenerative effects were detected in interlobular bile ducts. Based on serum transaminase levels, the acute protective effects of HB-EGF on hepatocytes were greater than those of HGF. On the other hand, liver fibrosis and cholestasis during the chronic phase were more potently inhibited by HGF compared with HB-EGF. Compared with either growth factor alone, combining HB-EGF and HGF produced greater anticholestatic and regenerative effects during the chronic phase. Taken together, these findings suggest that HB-EGF and HGF inhibited BDL-induced cholestatic liver injury, predominantly by exerting acute cytoprotective and chronic antifibrotic effects, respectively; combining the growth factors enhanced the anticholestatic effects and liver regeneration during the chronic phase. Our results contribute to a better understanding of the pathophysiologic roles of HB-EGF and HGF, as well as to the development of novel effective therapies for cholestatic liver injuries.
Recent studies have implicated a role of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) pathway in kidney disease. Skin toxicity associated with therapeutics which completely block the EGFR pathway precludes their use in chronic dosing. Therefore, we developed antibodies which specifically neutralize the EGFR ligands TGFα (transforming growth factor-alpha) and epiregulin but not EGF (epidermal growth factor), amphiregulin, betacellulin, HB-EGF (heparin-binding epidermal growth factor), or epigen. The epitope of one such neutralizing antibody, LY3016859, was characterized in detail to elucidate the structural basis for ligand specificity. Here we report a crystal structure of the LY3016859 Fab fragment in complex with soluble human TGFα. Our data demonstrate a conformational epitope located primarily within the C-terminal subdomain of the ligand. In addition, point mutagenesis experiments were used to highlight specific amino acids which are critical for both antigen binding and neutralization, most notably Ala(41) , Glu(44) , and His(45) . These results illustrate the structural basis for the ligand specificity/selectivity of LY3016859 and could also provide insight into further engineering to alter specificity and/or affinity of LY3016859.
Cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs) have been shown to be potential drug carriers for cancer therapy. The inherently low immunogenicity and cytotoxicity of human-derived CPPs make them more suitable for intracellular drug delivery compared to other delivery vehicles. In this work, the protein transduction ability of a novel CPP (termed HBP) derived from the heparin-binding domain of HB-EGF was evaluated. Our data shows, for the first time, that HBP possesses similar properties to typical CPPs and is a potent drug delivery vector for improving the antitumor activity of impermeable MAP30. The intrinsic bioactivities of recombinant MAP30-HBP were well preserved compared to those of free MAP30. Furthermore, HBP conjugated to the C-terminus of MAP30 promoted the cellular uptake of recombinant MAP30-HBP. Moreover, the fusion of HBP to MAP30 gave rise to significantly enhanced cytotoxic effects in all of the tumor cell lines tested. In HeLa cells, this cytotoxicity was mainly caused by the induction of cell apoptosis. Further investigation revealed that HBP enhanced MAP30-induced apoptosis through the activation of the mitochondrial- and death receptor-mediated signaling pathways. In addition, the MAP30-HBP fusion protein caused more HeLa cells to become arrested in S phase compared to MAP30 alone. These results highlight the MAP30-HBP fusion protein as a promising drug candidate for cancer therapy and demonstrate HBP, a novel CPP derived from human HB-EGF, as a new potential vector for antitumor drug delivery.

To evaluate the anti-tumor effects of trichosanthin after fusion with a cell penetrating peptide, heparin-binding peptide (HBP), derived from human heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor (HB-EGF).
The fusion protein of trichosanthin-HBP was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 and purified by Ni-NTA affinity chromatography. The HBP domain had no influence on the topological inactivation activity and N-glycosidase activity of trichosanthin. Trichosanthin-HBP significantly inhibited the growth of tested cancer cells which are impervious to trichosanthin. Tumor cell apoptosis and both the mitochondrial- and death receptor-mediated apoptotic signaling pathways induced by trichosanthin-HBP were more significant than those induced by trichosanthin in HeLa cells.
HBP is an efficient intracellular delivery vehicle for trichosanthin and makes trichosanthin-HBP become a promising agent for cancer therapy.
Measurement of melanoma depth of invasion (DoI) in skin tissues is of great significance in grading the severity of skin disease and planning patient's treatment. However, accurate and automatic measurement of melanocytic tumor depth is a challenging problem mainly due to the difficulty of skin granular identification and melanoma detection. In this paper, we propose a technique for measuring melanoma DoI in microscopic images digitized from MART1 (i.e., meleanoma-associated antigen recognized by T cells) stained skin histopathological sections. The technique consists of four modules. First, skin melanoma areas are detected by combining color features with the Mahalanobis distance measure. Next, skin epidermis is segmented by a multi-thresholding method. The skin granular layer is then identified based on Bayesian classification of segmented skin epidermis pixels. Finally, the melanoma DoI is computed using a multi-resolution approach with Hausdorff distance measurement. Experimental results show that the proposed technique provides a superior performance in measuring the melanoma DoI than two closely related techniques.
The culture of human limbal epithelial stem/progenitor cells (LSCs) in the presence of animal components poses the risk of cross-species contamination in clinical applications. We quantitatively compared different xenobiotic-free culture media for the cultivation of human LSCs. LSCs were cultured from 2 × 2 mm limbal tissue explants on denuded human amniotic membrane with different xenobiotic-free culture media: CnT-Prime (CnT-PR) supplemented with 0%, 1%, 5%, and 10% human serum (HS), embryonic stem cell medium (ESCM) alone or in combination with the standard supplemented hormonal epithelium medium (SHEM, control) at a 1:1 dilution ratio, and modified SHEM (mSHEM), in which cholera toxin and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) were removed, isoproterenol was added, and the epidermal growth factor concentration was reduced. Several parameters were quantified to assess the LSC phenotype: cell morphology, cell growth, cell size, outgrowth size, and expression of the undifferentiated LSC markers cytokeratin (K) 14, and p63α high-expressing (p63α(bright)) cells, a mature keratinocyte marker K12, epithelial marker pancytokeratin (PanK), and stromal cell marker vimentin (Vim). Compared with the standard SHEM control, CnT-PR base medium was associated with a lower cell growth and reduction in the proportion of stem cells generated regardless of the amount of HS supplemented (p &lt; 0.05); ESCM resulted in an increased proportion of PanK(-)/Vim(+) stromal cells (p &lt; 0.05) and a decreased proportion of p63α(bright) cells (p &lt; 0.05); mSHEM supported a similar cell growth (p &gt; 0.05), increased the number of small cells (diameter ≤12 μm; p &lt; 0.05), and provided a similar proportion of p63α(bright) cells (p &gt; 0.05). Among all the conditions tested, mSHEM was the most efficient and consistent in supporting the LSC phenotype and growth.
Strong association was documented between human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-B*15:02 and carbamazepine-induced severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs) in Asians. Beyond Asia, the HLA testing is potentially valuable in many countries with increasingly diverse communities of Asian ancestry, to facilitate an early recognition of patient susceptibility to SCARs.
To determine the cost-effectiveness of universal HLA-B*15:02 screening in preventing carbamazepine-induced Stevens-Johnson syndrome/ toxic epidermal necrolysis in an ethnically-diverse Malaysian population.
A hybrid model of a decision tree and Markov model was developed to evaluate three strategies for treating newly-diagnosed epilepsy among adults - (i) carbamazepine initiation without HLA-B*15:02 screening (current practice); (ii) universal HLA-B*15:02 screening prior to carbamazepine initiation; and (iii) alternative treatment [sodium valproate (VPA)] prescribing without HLA-B*15:02 screening. From a societal perspective, base-case analysis and sensitivity analyses were performed over lifetime time horizon. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were calculated.
In the base-case analysis, both universal HLA-B*15:02 screening and VPA prescribing were dominated by current practice. Compared to current practice, universal HLA-B*15:02 screening resulted in 0.0255 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) loss at an additional cost of USD707, while VPA prescribing resulted in 0.2622 QALYs loss at an additional cost of USD4,127, due to estimated differences in antiepileptic treatment efficacy.
This study suggests that universal HLA-B*15:02 screening is unlikely to be a cost-effective intervention in Malaysia compared to current practice. However, with the emergence of an ethnically-diverse population in many other countries, this may render HLA-B*15:02 screening a potentially viable intervention when an increasing proportion of the population is at risk and an equally effective yet safer antiepileptic drug is available.

A 75-year-old man with human immunodeficiency virus infection and numerous biopsy-proven warts for 10 years, refractory to cryosurgery, cimetidine, and topical imiquimod, presented with numerous pink to hypopigmented verrucous papules and plaques involving the face, trunk, buttocks, and groin. Laboratory evaluation revealed a CD4 T-cell count of 62 cells per microliter and human immunodeficiency virus viral load of &lt;117 copies per milliliter. Biopsy of a plaque groin lesion was performed. Histopathology revealed vertically oriented anastomosing strands of basaloid epithelium arising from multiple points along the epidermis in a background fibrovascular stroma. Ductal differentiation was identified. Areas of epidermis showed compact orthokeratosis, coarse hypergranulosis, and keratinocytes with abundant steel-blue-gray cytoplasm, indicative of viral cytopathic changes. Cytologic atypia was not identified. Human papillomavirus (HPV) genotyping of this lesion was positive for types 5 and 14. Overall, the findings were consistent with epidermodysplasia verruciformis in association with eccrine syringofibroadenoma (ESFA). The patient was subsequently treated with acitretin and showed clinical improvement. ESFA is an uncommon benign adnexal tumor with unknown pathogenesis. Although its association with HPV has rarely been reported, ESFA in the setting of acquired epidermodysplasia verruciformis has not been described. The development of ESFA in this case may be the result of HPV-induced cellular transformation.
The epidermis of snakes efficiently protects against dehydration and mechanical stress. However, only few proteins of the epidermal barrier to the environment have so far been identified in snakes. Here, we determined the organization of the Epidermal Differentiation Complex (EDC), a cluster of genes encoding protein constituents of cornified epidermal structures, in snakes and compared it to the EDCs of other squamates and non-squamate reptiles. The EDC of snakes displays shared synteny with that of the green anole lizard, including the presence of a cluster of corneous beta-protein (CBP)/beta-keratin genes. We found that a unique CBP comprising 4 putative beta-sheets and multiple cysteine-rich EDC proteins are conserved in all snakes and other squamates investigated. Comparative genomics of squamates suggests that the evolution of snakes was associated with a gene duplication generating two isoforms of the S100 fused-type protein, scaffoldin, the origin of distinct snake-specific EDC genes, and the loss of other genes that were present in the EDC of the last common ancestor of snakes and lizards. Taken together, our results provide new insights into the evolution of the skin in squamates and a basis for the characterization of the molecular composition of the epidermis in snakes.
To investigate the significance and impact of molecular subtyping stratification on metastatic breast cancer patients, we identified 159,344 female breast cancer patients in the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) database with known hormone receptor (HoR) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) status. 4.8% of patients were identified as having stage IV disease, and were more likely to be HER2+/HoR-, HER2+/HoR+, or HER2-/HoR-. Stage IV breast cancer patients with a HER2+/HoR+ status exhibited the highest median overall survival (OS) (44.0 months) and those with a HER2-/HoR- status exhibited the lowest median OS (13.0 months). Patients with a HER2-/HoR+ status had more bone metastasis, whereas patients with a HER2+/HoR- status had an increased incidence of liver metastasis. Brain and lung metastasis were more likely to occur in women with a HER2-/HoR- status. The multivariable analysis revealed a significant interaction between single metastasis and molecular subtype. No matter which molecular subtype, women who did not undergo primary tumour surgery had worse survival than those who experienced primary tumour surgery. Collectively, our findings advanced the understanding that molecular subtype might lead to more tailored and effective therapies in metastatic breast cancer patients.
Skin stem cells can regenerate epidermal appendages; however, hair follicles (HF) lost as a result of injury are barely regenerated. Here we show that macrophages in wounds activate HF stem cells, leading to telogen-anagen transition (TAT) around the wound and de novo HF regeneration, mostly through TNF signalling. Both TNF knockout and overexpression attenuate HF neogenesis in wounds, suggesting dose-dependent induction of HF neogenesis by TNF, which is consistent with TNF-induced AKT signalling in epidermal stem cells in vitro. TNF-induced β-catenin accumulation is dependent on AKT but not Wnt signalling. Inhibition of PI3K/AKT blocks depilation-induced HF TAT. Notably, Pten loss in Lgr5(+) HF stem cells results in HF TAT independent of injury and promotes HF neogenesis after wounding. Thus, our results suggest that macrophage-TNF-induced AKT/β-catenin signalling in Lgr5(+) HF stem cells has a crucial role in promoting HF cycling and neogenesis after wounding.
Tissue immunosurveillance is an important mechanism to prevent cancer. Skin treatment with the carcinogen 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene (DMBA), followed by the tumor promoter 12-O-tetra-decanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate (TPA), is an established murine model for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). However, the innate immunological events occurring during the initiation of chemical carcinogenesis with DMBA remain elusive. Here, we discovered that natural killer (NK) cells and Langerhans cells (LC) cooperate to impair this oncogenic process in murine skin. The depletion of NK cells or LC caused an accumulation of DNA-damaged, natural killer group 2D-ligand (NKG2D-L) expressing keratinocytes and accelerated tumor growth. Notably, the secretion of TNFα mainly by LC promoted the recruitment of NK cells into the epidermis. Indeed, the TNFα-induced chemokines CCL2 and CXCL10 directed NK cells to DMBA-treated epidermis. Our findings reveal a novel mechanism how innate immune cells cooperate in the inhibition of cutaneous chemical carcinogenesis.
La-related protein 6 (LARP6) is an evolutionally conserved RNA-binding protein. Vertebrate LARP6 binds the 5' stem-loop found in mRNAs encoding type I collagen to regulate their translation, but other target mRNAs and additional functions for LARP6 are unknown. The aim of this study was to elucidate an additional function of LARP6 and to evaluate the importance of its function during development.
To uncover the role of LARP6 in development, we utilized Morpholino Oligos to deplete LARP6 protein in Xenopus embryos. Then, embryonic phenotypes and ciliary structures of LAPR6 morphants were examined. To identify the molecular mechanism underlying ciliogenesis regulated by LARP6, we tested the expression level of cilia-related genes, which play important roles in ciliogenesis, by RT-PCR or whole mount in situ hybridization (WISH).
We knocked down LARP6 in Xenopus embryos and found neural tube closure defects. LARP6 mutant, which compromises the collagen synthesis, could rescue these defects. Neural tube closure defects are coincident with lack of cilia, antenna-like cellular organelles with motility- or sensory-related functions, in the neural tube. The absence of cilia at the epidermis was also observed in LARP6 morphants, and this defect was due to the absence of basal bodies which are formed from centrioles and required for ciliary assembly. In the process of multi-ciliated cell (MCC) differentiation, mcidas, which activates the transcription of genes required for centriole formation during ciliogenesis, could partially restore MCCs in LARP6 morphants. In addition, LARP6 likely controls the expression of mcidas in a Notch-independent manner.
La-related protein 6 is involved in ciliated cell differentiation during development by controlling the expression of cilia-related genes including mcidas. This LARP6 function involves a mechanism that is distinct from its established role in binding to collagen mRNAs and regulating their translation.
Different models of reconstructed human epidermis (RHE) are currently validated to assess skin irritation in vitro and ultimately to the animal replacement of the Draize test. The development of a new RHE model is a challenge for many laboratories, representing a potential gain of autonomy and improvement of technological knowledge. The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) encourages the development of new models and, for this purpose, offers a thorough guideline on quality control parameters (OECD TG 439). This work aimed to develop an RHE model (i.e. USP-RHE) for in vitro skin irritation assays, following the OECD TG 439. The developed model presents a well-differentiated epidermis similar to the Validated Reference Methods (VRM) and to native human epidermis. Quality parameters, i.e. optical density of negative control, tissue integrity and barrier function, were similar to VRM and in accordance with OECD TG 439. Moreover, the USP-RHE model was shown to have 85,7% of specificity (6/7), 100% of sensitivity (6/6) and 92,3% of accuracy (12/13) when compared to in vivo UN GHS classification. The within-laboratory reproducibility was 92.3% (12/13). Thus, we demonstrated that USP-RHE model attends to all OECD TG 439 performance standards and is ready to be used by private and public laboratories and companies for future validation studies.
Psoriasis is an immune-mediated skin disorder, which is triggered by the aberrant activation of dendritic cells in skin. This activation is followed by the complex interaction between the immune cells in the skin and keratinocyte in the epidermis. To improve the conditions of poor aqueous solubility and chemical stability, overcome skin barriers, and enhance in-vivo anti-psoriatic activity, curcumin (Cur) loaded poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) nanoparticles (NPs) were fabricated and administered by topical route to treat Imiquimod (IMQ)-induced psoriasis-like mouse model. Spherical Cur-NPs with the mean particle sizes of 50nm and 150nm, respectively, were fabricated using a multi-inlet vortex mixer system, with both exhibiting significantly stronger anti-proliferation effect than Cur solution on HaCaT cells in vitro. Psoriatic skin was utilized in the in-vitro skin penetration studies, and the results demonstrated that more drugs penetrated through or accumulated in the skin when administered as the Cur-NPs-loaded hydrogel compared to the drug suspension loaded hydrogel. To compare the nanosizing effect of these Cur-NPs, the mice with IMQ-induced psoriasis-like skin disease were treated with blank gel, Cur gel, 50nm sized NPs gel, 150nm sized NPs gel or tracrolimus cream (positive control), respectively. The results indicated that Cur-NPs hydrogel has a superior performance to Cur hydrogel on the IMQ-induced psoriasis-like mouse model in terms of morphological evaluation, biomarkers at mRNA, and protein levels. In conclusion, encapsulation of Cur into PLGA NPs, particularly for NPs of 50nm, could facilitate lipophilic Cur's dispersion, sustained-release, accumulation, and penetration across the skin and into the blood circulation, which significantly improves anti-psoriasis activity in mice.
Lysine-Proline-Valine (KPV) is a C-terminal peptide fragment of α-MSH with potent anti-inflammatory properties. Current study investigates various transdermal enhancement strategies such as iontophoresis (ITP), microneedles (MN) and their combination (ITP+MN) on KPV delivery across dermatomed human skin. KPV attains a positive charge at pH below 7.0, thus anodal ITP was employed. The influence of current strength, KPV concentration, and duration of current application on the KPV delivery was investigated. At defined ITP parameters, the influence of MN on KPV delivery (ITP+MN) across skin was also determined. KPV permeation was below detectable levels (limit of detection, 0.01 μg/mL) by simple passive diffusion (PD). However, KPV permeation was increased to 4.4 μg/cm(2)/h by MN treatment. Further, ITP and ITP+MN, increased the permeation rate by 8 and 35 fold, respectively, as compared to MN alone. The skin retention levels of KPV by MN, ITP and ITP+MN were increased by 5, 10 and 10 fold, respectively, as compared to PD. Confocal studies indicate that FITC-labeled KPV migrated through the stratum corneum (SC), along the microchannels and into the lower epidermal tissue since the fluorescence was observed beyond the depth of 100 μm.
Sepsis remains one of the leading causes of infant death worldwide. It is characterized by uncontrolled inflammatory responses due to proven bacterial infection. Despite improvement in supportive care and the availability of effective antibiotics, no specific therapy targeting the dysregulated inflammatory response is available for neonatal sepsis. Milk fat globule epidermal growth factor-factor 8 (MFG-E8) is a secretory glycoprotein abundantly present in human milk. MFG-E8 suppresses the systemic inflammatory responses in adult murine injury models by improving the clearance of dying cells. We hypothesized that exogenous administration of recombinant mouse MFG-E8 could inhibit the exaggerated inflammatory response and lung injury in a murine model of neonatal sepsis.
Neonatal sepsis was induced in 5- to 7-day-old male and female C57BL6 mice using an intraperitoneal injection of cecal slurry. At 1 hour after sepsis induction, a single dose of 40 μg/kg recombinant mouse MFG-E8 or vehicle was administered via retro-orbital injection. All neonates were returned to their mothers as a group. At 10 hours after cecal slurry injection, pups were killed and blood and lung tissues were collected. Control mice underwent a similar procedure with the exception of cecal slurry intraperitoneal injection.
Serum lactate dehydrogenase, IL-1β, and IL-6 were significantly increased 10 hours after cecal slurry injection. Treatment with recombinant mouse MFG-E8 decreased these levels by 30%, 56%, and 37%, respectively. Lung morphology was significantly compromised in the vehicle group after cecal slurry injection, whereas the recombinant mouse MFG-E8-treated groups demonstrated a 48% improvement in the lung injury score. Lung IL-6 and MIP-2 protein levels were significantly reduced with recombinant mouse MFG-E8 treatment. Lung neutrophil infiltration as observed by Gr-1 staining and, TUNEL-positive cells were also significantly reduced with recombinant mouse MFG-E8 treatment.
Treatment with recombinant mouse MFG-E8 attenuated inflammation and lung injury in murine neonatal sepsis. Thus, MFG-E8 could be developed as a possible therapy for neonatal sepsis.
Previous works show the development of thicker leaves on tolerant plants growing under cadmium (Cd(2+)) contamination. The aim of this study was to evaluate the Cd(2+) effects on the leaf meristems of the tolerant species Schinus molle. Plants were grown in nutrient solution containing 0, 10, and 50 μM of Cd(2+). Anatomical analysis was performed on leaf primordia sampled at regular time intervals. Under the lowest Cd(2+) level (10 μM), increased ground meristem thickness, diameter of the cells, cell elongation rate, and leaf dry mass were found. However, 50 μM of Cd(2+) reduced all these variables. In addition, the ground meristem cells became larger when exposed to any Cd(2+) level. The epidermis, palisade parenchyma, and vascular tissues developed earlier in Cd(2+)-exposed leaves. The modifications found on the ground meristem may be related to the development of thicker leaves on S. molle plants exposed to low Cd(2+) levels. Furthermore, older leaves showed higher Cd(2+) content when compared to the younger ones, preventing the Cd(2+) toxicity to these leaves. Thus, low Cd(2+) concentrations change the ground meristem structure and function reflecting on the development of thicker and enhanced leaves.
Actinic keratosis (AK) is a cutaneous cancer in situ which develops as a result of excessive exposure to ultraviolet (UV). Toll-like receptor (TLR)7 agonist imiquimod is a topical immune response modifier and is effective for the treatment of non-melanoma skin cancers. Recently, the diagnostic role of the dermatoscope has been reported in the course of treatment of AK. In addition, mast cells are now considered to contribute to both the innate and adaptive immune systems in topical imiquimod therapy. We assessed the effect of imiquimod treatment by dermatoscopic and immunohistochemical findings in 14 patients with a total of 21 AK lesions. With the dermatoscope, though the mean erythema score was not significantly different between the cured lesions and the unresponsive lesions, the erythema/red pseudo-network ("strawberry") pattern was decreased significantly in the cured lesions. By immunohistochemistry, the number of Ki-67-positive proliferative cells in the epidermis was decreased and that of CD117-positive mast cells in the dermis was increased in the responding lesions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study demonstrating that the number of mast cells in the dermis was increased in AK lesions effectively treated with imiquimod. Our present result suggests that mast cells may contribute an antitumor effect in human skin treated with topical imiquimod.
Genome-wide mechanisms that coordinate expression of subsets of functionally related genes are largely unknown. Recent studies show that receptor tyrosine kinases and components of signal transduction cascades including the extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK), once thought to act predominantly in the vicinity of plasma membrane and in the cytoplasm, can be recruited to chromatin encompassing transcribed genes. Genome-wide distribution of these transducers and their relationship to transcribing RNA polymerase II (Pol2) could provide new insights about co-regulation of functionally related gene subsets. Chromatin immunoprecipitations (ChIP) followed by deep sequencing, ChIP-Seq, revealed that genome-wide binding of epidermal growth factor receptor, EGFR and ERK pathway components at EGF-responsive genes was highly correlated with characteristic mitogen-induced Pol2-profile. Endosomes play a role in intracellular trafficking of proteins including their nuclear import. Immunofluorescence revealed that EGF-activated EGFR, MEK1/2 and ERK1/2 co-localize on endosomes. Perturbation of endosome internalization process, through the depletion of AP2M1 protein, resulted in decreased number of the EGFR containing endosomes and inhibition of Pol2, EGFR/ERK recruitment to EGR1 gene. Thus, mitogen-induced co-recruitment of EGFR/ERK components to subsets of genes, a kinase module possibly pre-assembled on endosome to synchronize their nuclear import, could coordinate genome-wide transcriptional events to ensure effective cell proliferation.
Hepatitis C virus (HCV) enters its target cell via clathrin-mediated endocytosis. AP-2-associated protein kinase 1 (AAK1) and cyclin G-associated kinase (GAK) are host kinases that regulate clathrin adaptor protein (AP)-mediated trafficking in the endocytic and secretory pathways. We previously reported that AAK1 and GAK regulate HCV assembly by stimulating binding of the μ subunit of AP-2, AP2M1, to HCV core protein. We also discovered that AAK1 and GAK inhibitors, including the approved anticancer drugs sunitinib and erlotinib, could block HCV assembly. Here, we hypothesized that AAK1 and GAK regulate HCV entry independently of their effect on HCV assembly. Indeed, silencing AAK1 and GAK expression inhibited entry of pseudoparticles and cell culture grown-HCV and internalization of Dil-labeled HCV particles with no effect on HCV attachment or RNA replication. AAK1 or GAK depletion impaired epidermal growth factor (EGF)-mediated enhanced HCV entry and endocytosis of EGF receptor (EGFR), an HCV entry cofactor and erlotinib's cancer target. Moreover, either RNA interference-mediated depletion of AP2M1 or NUMB, each a substrate of AAK1 and/or GAK, or overexpression of either an AP2M1 or NUMB phosphorylation site mutant inhibited HCV entry. Last, in addition to affecting assembly, sunitinib and erlotinib inhibited HCV entry at a postbinding step, their combination was synergistic, and their antiviral effect was reversed by either AAK1 or GAK overexpression. Together, these results validate AAK1 and GAK as critical regulators of HCV entry that function in part by activating EGFR, AP2M1, and NUMB and as the molecular targets underlying the antiviral effect of sunitinib and erlotinib (in addition to EGFR), respectively.
Understanding the host pathways hijacked by HCV is critical for developing host-centered anti-HCV approaches. Entry represents a potential target for antiviral strategies; however, no FDA-approved HCV entry inhibitors are currently available. We reported that two host kinases, AAK1 and GAK, regulate HCV assembly. Here, we provide evidence that AAK1 and GAK regulate HCV entry independently of their role in HCV assembly and define the mechanisms underlying AAK1- and GAK-mediated HCV entry. By regulating temporally distinct steps in the HCV life cycle, AAK1 and GAK represent "master regulators" of HCV infection and potential targets for antiviral strategies. Indeed, approved anticancer drugs that potently inhibit AAK1 or GAK inhibit HCV entry in addition to assembly. These results contribute to an understanding of the mechanisms of HCV entry and reveal attractive host targets for antiviral strategies as well as approved candidate inhibitors of these targets, with potential implications for other viruses that hijack clathrin-mediated pathways.
Mutations in the Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) kinase domain, such as the L858R missense mutation and deletions spanning the conserved sequence 747LREA750, are sensitive to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). The gatekeeper site residue mutation, T790M accounts for around 60% of acquired resistance to EGFR TKIs. The first generation EGFR TKIs, erlotinib and gefitinib, and the second generation inhibitor, afatinib are FDA approved for initial treatment of EGFR mutated lung adenocarcinoma. The predominant biomarker of EGFR TKI responsiveness is the presence of EGFR TKI-sensitizing mutations. However, 30-40% of patients with EGFR mutations exhibit primary resistance to these TKIs, underscoring the unmet need of identifying additional biomarkers of treatment response. Here, we sought to characterize the dynamics of tyrosine phosphorylation upon EGFR TKI treatment of mutant EGFR-driven human lung adenocarcinoma cell lines with varying sensitivity to EGFR TKIs, erlotinib and afatinib. We employed stable isotope labeling with amino acids in cell culture (SILAC)-based quantitative mass spectrometry to identify and quantify tyrosine phosphorylated peptides. The proportion of tyrosine phosphorylated sites that had reduced phosphorylation upon erlotinib or afatinib treatment correlated with the degree of TKI-sensitivity. Afatinib, an irreversible EGFR TKI, more effectively inhibited tyrosine phosphorylation of a majority of the substrates. The phosphosites with phosphorylation SILAC ratios that correlated with the TKI-sensitivity of the cell lines include sites on kinases, such as EGFR-Y1197 and MAPK7-Y221, and adaptor proteins, such as SHC1-Y349/350, ERRFI1-Y394, GAB1-Y689, STAT5A-Y694, DLG3-Y705 and DAPP1-Y139, suggesting these are potential biomarkers of TKI sensitivity. DAPP1 is a novel target of mutant EGFR signaling and Y-139 is the major site of DAPP1 tyrosine phosphorylation. We also uncovered several off-target effects of these TKIs, such as MST1R-Y1238/Y1239 and MET-Y1252/1253. This study provides unique insight into the TKI-mediated modulation of mutant EGFR signaling, which can be applied to the development of biomarkers of EGFR TKI response.
Recent research indicates that the C-terminal Eps15 homology domain 1 is associated with epithelial growth factor receptor-mediated endocytosis recycling in non-small-cell lung cancer. The aim of this study was to determine the clinical significance of Eps15 homology domain 1 gene expression in relation to phosphorylation of epithelial growth factor receptor expression in patients with breast cancer. Primary breast cancer samples from 306 patients were analyzed for Eps15 homology domain 1, RAB11FIP3, and phosphorylation of epithelial growth factor receptor expression via immunohistochemistry. The clinical significance was assessed via a multivariate Cox regression analysis, Kaplan-Meier curves, and the log-rank test. Eps15 homology domain 1 and phosphorylation of epithelial growth factor receptor were upregulated in 60.46% (185/306) and 53.92% (165/306) of tumor tissues, respectively, as assessed by immunohistochemistry. The statistical correlation analysis indicated that Eps15 homology domain 1 overexpression was positively correlated with the increases in phosphorylation of epithelial growth factor receptor ( r = 0.242, p &lt; 0.001) and RAB11FIP3 ( r = 0.165, p = 0.005) expression. The multivariate Cox proportional hazard model analysis demonstrated that the expression of Eps15 homology domain 1 alone is a significant prognostic marker of breast cancer for the overall survival in the total, chemotherapy, and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (-) groups. However, the use of combined expression of Eps15 homology domain 1 and phosphorylation of epithelial growth factor receptor markers is more effective for the disease-free survival in the overall population, chemotherapy, and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (-) groups. Moreover, the combined markers are also significant prognostic markers of breast cancer in the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (+), estrogen receptor (+), and estrogen receptor (-) groups. Eps15 homology domain 1 has a tumor suppressor function, and the combined marker of Eps15 homology domain 1/phosphorylation of epithelial growth factor receptor expression was identified as a better prognostic marker in breast cancer diagnosis. Furthermore, RAB11FIP3 combines with Eps15 homology domain 1 to promote the endocytosis recycling of phosphorylation of epithelial growth factor receptor.
Septins are small GTPases that play a role in several important cellular processes. In this review, we focus on the roles of septins in protein stabilization. Septins may regulate protein stability by: (1) interacting with proteins involved in degradation pathways, (2) regulating the interaction between transmembrane proteins and cytoskeletal proteins, (3) affecting the mobility of transmembrane proteins in lipid bilayers, and (4) modulating the interaction of proteins with their adaptor or signaling proteins. In this context, we discuss the role of septins in protecting four different proteins from degradation. First we consider botulinum neurotoxin serotype A (BoNT/A) and the contribution of septins to its extraordinarily long intracellular persistence. Next, we discuss the role of septins in stabilizing the receptor tyrosine kinases EGFR and ErbB2. Finally, we consider the contribution of septins in protecting hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α) from degradation.
Disabled-2 (Dab2) is a clathrin and cargo binding endocytic adaptor protein, and cell biology studies revealed that Dab2 plays a role in cellular trafficking of a number of transmembrane receptors and signaling proteins. A PTB/PID domain located in the N-terminus of Dab2 binds the NPXY motif(s) present at the cytoplasmic tails of certain transmembrane proteins/receptors. The membrane receptors reported to bind directly to Dab2 include LDL receptor and its family members LRP1 and LRP2 (megalin), growth factor receptors EGFR and FGFR, and the cell adhesion receptor beta1 integrin. Dab2 also serves as an adaptor in signaling pathways. Particularly, Dab2 facilitates the endocytosis of the Ras activating Grb2/Sos1 signaling complex, controls its disassembly, and thereby regulates the Ras/MAPK signaling pathway. Cellular analyses have suggested several diverse functions for the widely expressed proteins, and Dab2 is also considered a tumor suppressor, as loss or reduced expression is found in several cancer types. Dab2 null mutant mice were generated and investigated to determine if the findings from cellular studies might be important and relevant in intact animals. Dab2 conditional knockout mice mediated through a Sox2-Cre transgene have no obvious developmental defects and have a normal life span despite that the Dab2 protein is essentially absent in the mutant mice. The conditional knockout mice were grossly normal, though more recent investigation of the Dab2-deficient mice revealed several phenotypes, which can be accounted for by several previously suggested mechanisms. The studies of mutant mice established that Dab2 plays multiple physiological roles through its endocytic functions and modulation of signal pathways.
The HIV accessory protein Nef is a major determinant of viral pathogenesis that facilitates viral particle release, prevents viral antigen presentation and increases infectivity of new virus particles. These functions of Nef involve its ability to remove specific host proteins from the surface of infected cells, including the CD4 receptor. Nef binds to the adaptor protein 2 (AP-2) and CD4 in clathrin-coated pits, forcing CD4 internalization and its subsequent targeting to lysosomes. Herein, we report that this lysosomal targeting requires a variant of AP-1 containing isoform 2 of γ-adaptin (AP1G2, hereafter γ2). Depletion of the γ2 or μ1A (AP1M1) subunits of AP-1, but not of γ1 (AP1G1), precludes Nef-mediated lysosomal degradation of CD4. In γ2-depleted cells, CD4 internalized by Nef accumulates in early endosomes and this alleviates CD4 removal from the cell surface. Depletion of γ2 also hinders EGFR-EGF-complex targeting to lysosomes, an effect that is not observed upon γ1 depletion. Taken together, our data provide evidence that the presence of γ1 or γ2 subunits delineates two distinct variants of AP-1 complexes, with different functions in protein sorting.
Tumor necrosis factor-α-inducible protein 8 (TNFAIP8) is the first discovered oncogenic and an anti-apoptotic member of a conserved TNFAIP8 or TIPE family of proteins. TNFAIP8 mRNA is induced by NF-kB, and overexpression of TNFAIP8 has been correlated with poor prognosis in many cancers. Downregulation of TNFAIP8 expression has been associated with decreased pulmonary colonization of human tumor cells, and enhanced sensitivities of tumor xenografts to radiation and docetaxel. Here we have investigated the effects of depletion of TNFAIP8 on the mRNA, microRNA and protein expression profiles in prostate and breast cancers and melanoma. Depending on the tumor cell type, knockdown of TNFAIP8 was found to be associated with increased mRNA expression of several antiproliferative and apoptotic genes (e.g., IL-24, FAT3, LPHN2, EPHA3) and fatty acid oxidation gene ACADL, and decreased mRNA levels of oncogenes (e.g., NFAT5, MALAT1, MET, FOXA1, KRAS, S100P, OSTF1) and glutamate transporter gene SLC1A1. TNFAIP8 knockdown cells also exhibited decreased expression of multiple onco-proteins (e.g., PIK3CA, SRC, EGFR, IL5, ABL1, GAP43), and increased expression of the orphan nuclear receptor NR4A1 and alpha 1 adaptin subunit of the adaptor-related protein complex 2 AP2 critical to clathrin-mediated endocytosis. TNFAIP8-centric molecules were found to be predominately implicated in the hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) signaling pathway, and cancer and development signaling networks. Thus TNFAIP8 seems to regulate the cell survival and cancer progression processes in a multifaceted manner. Future validation of the molecules identified in this study is likely to lead to new subset of molecules and functional determinants of cancer cell survival and progression.
EGFR is a therapeutic target in NSCLC for EGFR-mutant patients. Proximity ligation assay (PLA) is a method to detect functional signaling associated protein complexes. Growth factor receptor bound protein 2 (GRB2) is an adaptor protein that binds to the phosphorylated residues of active EGFR. Interaction of EGFR and GRB2 correlates with active EGFR signaling and leads to activation of the MAPK/ERK pathway.
A PLA developed to detect EGFR-GRB2 interaction was measured by quantitative immunofluorescence using Automated Quantitative Analysis technology. EGFR pathway activation was assessed in patients with NSCLC with different mutation status along with overall EGFR expression. Additionally, the PLA to detect EGFR-GRB2 interaction was evaluated as a prognostic marker in two cohorts of patients with lung adenocarcinoma.
The PLA to detect EGFR-GRB2 interaction was unrelated to overall EGFR expression or mutation in a series of patients with NSCLC with known mutation status. EGFR-mutant (p = 0.04) and EGFR/KRAS wild-type tumors (p = 0.0049) had significantly higher EGFR pathway activation compared with KRAS-mutant cases, with no significant difference shown between mutation sites. In two series of patients with lung adenocarcinoma, the PLA to detect EGFR-GRB2 interaction was independently associated with longer survival (hazard ratio = 0.46, 95% confidence interval: 0.2-0.78, p = 0.0085 and hazard ratio = 0.48, 95% confidence interval: 0.2-0.85, p = 0.017). Total EGFR protein expression alone was not correlated with outcome.
EGFR colocalization with GRB2 as assessed by PLA is not correlated with EGFR expression levels or mutation status, defining a patient group that may show EGFR pathway activation, as illustrated by its prognostic value. Future studies may determine whether this group is more likely to respond to EGFR-targeted therapies.
Cetuximab is a monoclonal antibody against epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and is approved for clinical use in combination with chemotherapy in patients affected by colorectal cancer (CRC), non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and head and neck cancer. Compared with these cancers, gastric cancer is relatively resistant to cetuximab and its regulatory mechanism is still unclear.
In this study, we assessed whether the ubiquitin- proteasome pathway is involved in regulating cetuximab-induced cells apoptosis in MGC803 and BGC823 gastric cancer cell lines.
The casitas B lineage lymphoma-b (Cbl-b), a kind of E3 ubiquitin ligase, was involved in this process. Specific silenced Cbl-b expression increased the expression of EGFR.
Our findings lead to a better understanding of the mechanism of cetuximab action, and suggests that Cbl-b increases the sensitivity of cetuximab in gastric cancer cells.
Receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) recycling is of critical importance for RTK signaling and cancer, yet the process is poorly understood. In this issue, Ye et al. identify GOLM1 as a cargo adaptor that drives hepatocellular carcinoma metastasis by promoting EGFR recycling and provide insights into how this process is regulated.
The molecular mechanisms for hypoxic environment causing the injury of intestinal mucosal barrier (IMB) are widely unknown. To address the issue, Han Chinese from 100 m altitude and Tibetans from high altitude (more than 3650 m) were recruited. Histological and transcriptome analyses were performed. The results showed intestinal villi were reduced and appeared irregular, and glandular epithelium was destroyed in the IMB of Tibetans when compared with Han Chinese. Transcriptome analysis revealed 2573 genes with altered expression. The levels of 1137 genes increased and 1436 genes decreased in Tibetans when compared with Han Chinese. Gene ontology (GO) analysis indicated most immunological responses were reduced in the IMB of Tibetans when compared with Han Chinese. Gene microarray showed that there were 25-, 22-, and 18-fold downregulation for growth factor receptor-bound protein 2 (GRB2), epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), and tyrosine-protein phosphatase nonreceptor type 11 (PTPN11) in the IMB of Tibetans when compared with Han Chinese. The downregulation of EGFR, GRB2, and PTPN11 will reduce the production of reactive oxygen species and protect against oxidative stress-induced injury for intestine. Thus, the transcriptome analysis showed the protecting functions of IMB patients against hypoxia-induced oxidative injury in the intestine of Tibetans via affecting GRB2/EGFR/PTPN11 pathways.
The mechanism of cancer metastasis remains poorly understood. Using gene profiling of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tissues, we have identified GOLM1 as a leading gene relating to HCC metastasis. GOLM1 expression is correlated with early recurrence, metastasis, and poor survival of HCC patients. Both gain- and loss-of-function studies determine that GOLM1 acts as a key oncogene by promoting HCC growth and metastasis. It selectively interacts with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and serves as a specific cargo adaptor to assist EGFR/RTK anchoring on the trans-Golgi network (TGN) and recycling back to the plasma membrane, leading to prolonged activation of the downstream kinases. These findings reveal the functional role of GOLM1, a Golgi-related protein, in EGFR/RTK recycling and metastatic progression of HCC.
We have previously identified an unique function of G protein α inhibitory subunit (Gαi protein) in transducing Akt-mTOR signaling. Here, we examined the expression and biological functions of Gαi protein 3 (Gαi3) in human glioma. As compared to the normal brain tissues, mRNA and protein expressions of Gαi3 were significantly upregulated in multiple human glioma tissues. Its expression level was associated with receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs, including EGFR, FGFR and PDGFRα) over-expression and Akt-mTOR hyperactivity. Gαi3 formed a complex with above RTKs and the adaptor protein Gab1 in glioma tissues and cells, which was required for downstream Akt-mTOR activation. Gαi3 shRNA knockdown or dominant negative mutation largely attenuated Akt-mTOR activation and glioma cell growth. Further, Gαi3-knockout (KO) mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) showed decreased Akt activation and cell growth. Reversely, introduction of a constitutively-active Gαi3 in glioma cells enhanced Akt-mTOR activation and cell growth. In vivo, Gαi3 shRNA-expressing U87MG tumors grew slower than the control shRNA-bearing U87MG tumors in nude mice. Akt-mTOR activation was also inhibited in U87MG tumors with Gαi3 shRNA. Collectively, these results indicate that over-expressed Gαi3 forms a complex with several RTKs in human glioma to transduce Akt-mTOR activation and tumor cell growth.
Receptor tyrosine kinases, such as the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor (EGFR) and Met lead to activation of intracellular signals including Akt, a critical regulator of cell survival, metabolism and proliferation. Upon binding their respective ligands, each of these receptors is recruited into clathrin coated pits (CCPs) eventually leading to endocytosis. We have recently shown that phosphorylation of Gab1 and Akt following EGFR activation requires clathrin, but does not require receptor endocytosis. We examined whether clathrin regulates Akt signaling downstream of Met, as it does for EGFR signaling. Stimulation with the Met ligand Hepatocyte Growth Factor (HGF) leads to enrichment of phosphorylated Gab1 (pGab1) within CCPs in ARPE-19 cells. Perturbation of clathrin using the inhibitor pitstop2 decreases HGF-stimulated Akt phosphorylation. These results indicate that clathrin may regulate Met signaling leading to Akt phosphorylation similarly as it does for EGFR signaling.
The dynamic assembly of multiprotein complexes is a central mechanism of many cell signaling pathways. This process is key to maintaining the spatiotemporal specificity required for an accurate, yet adaptive, response to rapidly changing cellular conditions. We describe a technique for the specific isolation and downstream proteomic characterization of any two interacting proteins, to the exclusion of their individual moieties and competing binding partners. We termed the approach bimolecular complementation affinity purification (BiCAP) because it combines the use of conformation-specific nanobodies with a protein-fragment complementation assay with affinity purification. Using BiCAP, we characterized the specific interactome of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) family member ERBB2 when in the form of a homodimer or when in the form of a heterodimer with either EGFR or ERBB3. We identified dimer-specific interaction patterns for key adaptor proteins and identified a number of previously unknown interacting partners. Functional analysis for one of these newly identified partners revealed a noncanonical mechanism of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) activation that is specific to the ERBB2:ERBB3 heterodimer and acts through the adaptor protein FAM59A in breast cancer cells.
This Podcast features an interview with Steven Wiley, senior author of a Research Article that appears in the 12 July 2016 issue of Science Signaling, about how the abundance of adaptor proteins and feedback regulators affect the flow of information downstream of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Information flows through a signaling pathway by sequential interactions between core components of the pathway, many of which have enzymatic activity. Adaptor proteins do not directly participate in relaying the signal and do not have enzymatic activity, but are important for signaling because they facilitate interactions between the core components. Using quantitative methods, Shi et al demonstrated that core components of the EGFR pathway were highly abundant in both normal cells and cancer cells. However, adaptor proteins were present in much lower abundance in both cell types, indicating that it is the abundance of these proteins that limit signaling downstream of EGFR. The authors also found that differences in EGFR signaling between different cell types likely resulted from the variable abundance of feedback regulators.Listen to Podcast.
Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) constitutes ~10-15% of breast cancer patients and represents an aggressive subtype with poor overall prognosis. TNBC is an important clinical challenge because it does not respond well to endocrine therapy and have a higher rate of early recurrence and distant metastasis following chemotherapy. Although it has been reported that the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) was overexpressed in ~80% of TNBC, anti-EGFR therapy showed limited clinical benefit according to phase II studies. In this study, we first observed that knockdown of the transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding domain (TAZ) gene can regulate the sensitivity of TNBC cell lines to EGFR inhibitors (EGFRI) in a cell context-depended manner. Furthermore, in certain breast cancer cell lines the YES-associated protein, paralog of TAZ (YAP) expression can be upregulated by TAZ inhibition which leads to EGFRI resistance. These results suggest a specific inhibitor to TAZ/YAP combined with anti-EGFR therapy may prove effective and provide a reason why targeting EGFR showed limited clinical benefit in TNBC treatment.
The adaptor protein Mig-6 is a negative regulator of EGF signaling. It is shown that Mig-6 inhibits cell migration via direct interaction with the ErbB receptors, thereby inhibiting cross-phosphorylation or targeting the receptors for degradation. Mig-6 has also been shown to bind to and inhibit the Rho GTPase Cdc42 to suppress cytoskeletal rearrangement. However, the molecular mechanism(s) by which Mig-6 inhibits cell migration via Cdc42 is still not entirely clear. Here, we show that Mig-6 binding to Cdc42 is necessary and sufficient to inhibit EGF-induced filopodia formation and migration. This binding, mediated by four specific residues (I11, R12, M26, R30) in the Mig-6 CRIB domain, is essential for Mig-6 function. In addition, ectopic expression of Cdc42 reverses Mig-6 inhibition of cell migration. Mig-6 CRIB domain, alone, is sufficient to inhibit cell migration. Conversely, Mig-6 binding to EGFR is dispensable for Mig-6-mediated inhibition of cell migration. Moreover, we found that decreased Mig-6 expression correlates with cancer progression in breast and prostate cancers. Together, our results demonstrate that Mig-6 inhibition of Cdc42 signaling is critical in Mig-6 function to suppress cell migration and that dysregulation of this pathway may play a critical role in cancer development.
Cell migration in 3D microenvironments is fundamental to development, homeostasis and the pathobiology of diseases such as cancer. Rab-coupling protein (RCP) dependent co-trafficking of α5β1 and EGFR1 promotes cancer cell invasion into fibronectin (FN) containing extracellular matrix (ECM), by potentiating EGFR1 signalling at the front of invasive cells. This promotes a switch in RhoGTPase signalling to inhibit Rac1 and activate a RhoA-ROCK-Formin homology domain-containing 3 (FHOD3) pathway and generate filopodial actin-spike protrusions which drive invasion. To further understand the signalling network that drives RCP-driven invasive migration, we generated a Boolean logical model based on existing network pathways/models, where each node can be interrogated by computational simulation. The model predicted an unanticipated feedback loop, whereby Raf/MEK/ERK signalling maintains suppression of Rac1 by inhibiting the Rac-activating Sos1-Eps8-Abi1 complex, allowing RhoA activity to predominate in invasive protrusions. MEK inhibition was sufficient to promote lamellipodia formation and oppose filopodial actin-spike formation, and led to activation of Rac and inactivation of RhoA at the leading edge of cells moving in 3D matrix. Furthermore, MEK inhibition abrogated RCP/α5β1/EGFR1-driven invasive migration. However, upon knockdown of Eps8 (to suppress the Sos1-Abi1-Eps8 complex), MEK inhibition had no effect on RhoGTPase activity and did not oppose invasive migration, suggesting that MEK-ERK signalling suppresses the Rac-activating Sos1-Abi1-Eps8 complex to maintain RhoA activity and promote filopodial actin-spike formation and invasive migration. Our study highlights the predictive potential of mathematical modelling approaches, and demonstrates that a simple intervention (MEK-inhibition) could be of therapeutic benefit in preventing invasive migration and metastasis.
Drug treatment of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) positive non-small cell lung cancer has improved substantially by targeting activating mutations within the receptor tyrosine kinase domain. However, the development of drug resistance still limits this approach. As root causes, large heterogeneity between tumour entities but also within tumour cells have been suggested. Therefore, approaches to identify these multitude and complex mechanisms are urgently required. Affinity purification coupled with high resolution mass spectrometry was applied to isolate and characterise the EGFR interactome from HCC4006 non-small cell lung cancer cells and their variant HCC4006(r)ERLO(0.5) adapted to grow in the presence of therapeutically relevant concentrations of erlotinib. Bioinformatics analyses were carried out to identify proteins and their related molecular functions that interact differentially with EGFR in the untreated state or when incubated with erlotinib prior to EGFR activation. Across all experimental conditions 375 proteins were detected to participate in the EGFR interactome, 90% of which constituted a complex protein interaction network that was bioinformatically reconstructed from literature data. Treatment of HCC4006(r)ERLO(0.5) cells carrying a resistance phenotype to erlotinib was associated with an increase of protein levels of members of the clathrin-associated adaptor protein family AP2 (AP2A1, AP2A2, AP2B1), structural proteins of cytoskeleton rearrangement as well as signalling molecules such as Shc. Validation experiments confirmed activation of the Ras-Raf-Mek-Erk (MAPK)-pathway, of which Shc is an initiating adaptor molecule, in HCC4006(r)ERLO(0.5) cells. Taken together, differential proteins in the EGFR interactome of HCC4006(r)ERLO(0.5) cells were identified that could be related to multiple resistance mechanisms including alterations in growth factor receptor expression, cellular remodelling processes suggesting epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition as well as alterations in downstream signalling. Knowledge of these mechanisms is a pivotal step to build an integrative model of drug resistance in a systems pharmacology manner and to be able to investigate the interplay of these mechanisms and ultimately recommend combinatorial treatment strategies to overcome drug resistance.
The AZD9291 (Osimertinib) Treatment on Positive PLasma T790M in EGFR-mutant NSCLC Patients (APPLE) trial is a randomized, open-label, multicenter, 3-arm, phase II study in advanced, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-mutant and EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI)-naive non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients, to evaluate the best strategy for sequencing gefitinib and osimertinib treatment. Advanced EGFR-mutant NSCLC patients, with World Health Organization performance status 0-2 who are EGFR TKI treatment-naive and eligible to receive first-line treatment with EGFR TKI will be randomized to: In all arms, a plasmatic ctDNA T790M test will be performed by a central laboratory at the Medical University of Gdansk (Poland) but will be applied as a predictive marker for making treatment decisions only in arm B. The primary objective is to evaluate the best strategy for sequencing of treatment with gefitinib and osimertinib in advanced NSCLC patients with common EGFR mutations, and to understand the value of liquid biopsy for the decision-making process. The progression-free survival rate at 18 months is the primary end point of the trial. The activity of osimertinib versus gefitinib to prevent brain metastases will be evaluated.
The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is implicated in various malignancies. The past decade has seen the development and widespread use of EGFR inhibitors for the successful treatment of such cancers. Available EGFR inhibitors include small molecule tyrosine-kinase inhibitors and monoclonal antibodies. Class-related renal adverse events result in dual toxicity including tubular/electrolyte disorders and glomerulopathies. Tubular injury is common and mainly due to monoclonal antibodies while glomerulopathy is rare and related to various anti-EGFR agents. The exact pathogenesis of anti-EGFR agents associated with kidney disorders remains to be elucidated.
Biomarkers can improve clinical trial efficiency, but designing and interpreting biomarker-driven trials require knowledge of relationships among biomarkers, clinical covariates, and endpoints. We investigated these relationships across genomic subgroups of glioblastoma (GBM) within our institution (DF/BWCC), validated results in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), and demonstrated potential impacts on clinical trial design and interpretation.
We identified genotyped patients at DF/BWCC, and clinical associations across 4 common GBM genomic biomarker groups were compared along with overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), and survival post-progression (SPP). Significant associations were validated in TCGA. Biomarker-based clinical trials were simulated using various assumptions.
Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)(+) and p53(-) subgroups were more likely isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) wild-type. Phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K)(+) patients were older, and patients with O6-DNA methylguanine-methyltransferase (MGMT)-promoter methylation were more often female. OS, PFS, and SPP were all longer for IDH mutant and MGMT methylated patients, but there was no independent prognostic value for other genomic subgroups. PI3K(+) patients had shorter PFS among IDH wild-type tumors, however, and no DF/BWCC long-term survivors were either EGFR(+) (0% vs 7%, P = .014) or p53(-) (0% vs 10%, P = .005). The degree of biomarker overlap impacted the efficiency of Bayesian-adaptive clinical trials, while PFS and OS distribution variation had less impact. Biomarker frequency was proportionally associated with sample size in all designs.
We identified several associations between GBM genomic subgroups and clinical or molecular prognostic covariates and validated known prognostic factors in all survival periods. These results are important for biomarker-based trial design and interpretation of biomarker-only and nonrandomized trials.
Abnormal expression of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling and microRNAs (miRNAs) has been widely seen in gastric cancer. The present study focused on the miRNAs that regulate human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER) activation through mucin 13 (MUC13). The protein level of MUC13 was demonstrated to be significantly increased in gastric cancer tissues compared with normal tissues by western blot analysis and immunohistochemistry. TargetScan bioinformatic predictions indicated that miRNA (miR)‑212‑3p and miR‑132‑3p may bind to the 3'‑untranslated region of MUC13. Further investigation revealed that miR‑132‑3p was significantly decreased in gastric cancer tissues compared with normal tissues, whereas miR‑212‑3p expression was unaffected. Luciferase assays and western blot confirmed MUC13 as a target gene of miR‑132‑3p. Inhibition of miR‑132‑3p enhanced gastric cancer cell migration through activation of HER2, extracellular signal‑regulated kinase (ERK) and Akt serine/threonine kinase (Akt) signaling, which was a similar effect to that of MUC13 overexpression. In summary, reduction of miR‑132‑3p may contribute to gastric cancer proliferation by targeting MUC13.
The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling pathways are altered in many cancers contributing to increased cell survival. These alterations are caused mainly through increased expression or mutation of EGFR family members EGFR, ErbB2, ErbB3, and ErbB4. These receptors have been successfully targeted for cancer therapy. Specifically, a monoclonal antibody against ErbB2, trastuzumab, and a tyrosine kinase inhibitor against EGFR, gefitinib, have improved the survival of breast and lung cancer patients. Unfortunately, cancer patients frequently become resistant to these inhibitors. This has led to investigating how EGFR can contribute to cell survival and how cancer cells can overcome inhibition of its signaling. Indeed, it is coming into focus that EGFR signaling goes beyond a single signal triggering cell proliferation and survival and is a sensor that regulates the cell's response to microenvironmental stresses such as hypoxia. It acts as a switch that modulates the ability of cancer cells to survive. Autophagy is a process of self-digestion that is inhibited by EGFR allowing cancer cells to survive under stresses that would normally cause death and become resistant to chemotherapy. Inhibiting EGFR signaling allows autophagy to contribute to cell death. This gives new opportunities to develop novel therapeutic strategies to treat cancers that rely on EGFR signaling networks and autophagy. In this review, we summarize the current understanding of EGFR family member regulation of autophagy in cancer cells and how new therapeutic strategies could be developed to overcome drug resistance.
This study is to investigate the effect of low concentration hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) on the proliferation of gastric cancer AGS cell line in vitro and the mechanism.
AGS cells were treated with different low concentrations of H2O2 (1, 0.1, 0.01, and 0.001 μm) for 48 hours. The effect of H2O2 concentration gradient on the activity of AGS cell activities was detected by methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium (MTT) method. The expression of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and its downstream signaling pathway extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) protein in H2O2 was detected by Western blot method; moreover, the effect of H2O2 on intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) in AGS cells was observed under the fluorescence microscope and quantitative analysis by flow cytometry. The effect of H2O2 on the level of c-myc mRNA in AGS cells was also detected by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).
MTT detection results showed that 1 μm and 0.1 μm H2O2 at 48h can effectively promote the proliferation of AGS cells (p&lt;0.05). The Western blot results showed that after 48 hours of low concentration of H2O2 treatment of AGS cells, the EGFR protein levels and ERK protein phosphorylation levels increased significantly (p&lt;0.05). Fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry showed that the low concentration of H2O2 increased the intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS). RT-PCR results showed the levels of c-myc mRNA in AGS cells treated with a low concentration of H2O2 were significantly increased (p&lt;0.05) and EGFR blocking agent AG1478 can resist the above effects.
Low concentration of H2O2 can significantly promote the proliferation of AGS cells by activating EGFR/ERK signaling pathway.
Malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) is a relative rare but highly aggressive neoplasm which is associated with asbestos exposure in most patients. The majority of patients are diagnosed in advanced stages so patients neither benefit from chemotherapy (e.g. pemetrexed-platinum combination) nor from surgery. It has been reported that cellular-mesenchymal to epithelial transition factor (MET) and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) were critical for MPM cell proliferation. Moreover, targeting MET and EGFR drugs have gained promising results on anti-tumor therapy. Here, a striking difference in overall survival was observed between the MET and EGFR co-expression group (median survival time = 13.5 months) and non-co-expression group (median survival time = 20.5 months). In addition, treatment with combination of crizotinib and afatinib showed stronger inhibition on cell proliferation of MPM than the treatment by either one in vitro and in vivo. In conclusion, our data illustrated that crizotinib combined with afatinib may be a potentially effective strategy for treating MPM patients with over-expression of MET and EGFR.
Lung cancer is the foremost cause of cancer-related deaths world-wide. Both, the major forms of lung cancer, Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and Small cell lung cancers (SCLC), have responded effectively to chemo-, radiation and adjuvant-therapies. Tumor removal through surgery also appeared as a good therapeutic strategy. However, these therapies demonstrated unfavourable side-effects, and hence novel drugs targeting lung cancer emerged essential. Activation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-tyrosine kinases is a key reason for lung cancer progression. Two important strategies that have attenuated lung cancers were through treatments with EGFR-tyrosine kinase-inhibitors, erlotinib and gefitinib, or EGFR-neutralizing antibodies, cetuximab and bevacizumab. A major advantage with erlotinib and gefitinib was their role in second and third-line treatments following chemotherapies. Phase II/III clinical trials showed that combinatorial treatment of tyrosine kinase (TK)-inhibitors with chemotherapeutics, such as docetaxel and pemetrexed, caused significant improvements in progression-free survival and overall survival.Phase I and II clinical studies also revealed that combination of tyrosine kinase-inhibitors with the EGFR-targeted antibodies was an effective approach for treating lung cancer. However, patients having T790M-mutations within EGFR gene were resistant to erlotinib and gefitinib. Alternatively, another second-generation EGFR-tyrosine kinase-inhibitor, afatinib, that could circumvent the problem of drug resistance has been developed as lung cancer therapy. The current review focuses on the role of EGFR in lung cancer progression and apprises about the EGFR-targeted therapies. The review also informs on the adverse side-effects of these therapies and enlightens the need for safer therapeutic regimens to eradicate this dreaded disease.
Cell sheet technology is a promising therapeutic strategy for the treatment of ischemic diseases such as myocardial infarction. We recently developed a novel protocol, termed "hypoxic preconditioning," capable of augmenting the therapeutic efficacy of cell sheets. Following this protocol, the pro-angiogenic and anti-fibrotic activity of cell sheets were enhanced by brief incubation of cell sheets under hypoxic culture conditions. However, the precise molecular mechanism underlying the hypoxic preconditioning of cell sheets is unclear. In the present study, we examined signal transducers in cell sheets to identify those responsive to hypoxic preconditioning, using cardiosphere-derived cell (CDC) sheets. We initially tested whether sheet-like structures were suitable for hypoxic preconditioning by comparing them with individual cells. Hypoxic preconditioning was more effective in sheeted cells than in individual cells. Expression of hypoxia inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) were induced upon hypoxic preconditioning of cell sheets, as was the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway. In addition, hypoxic preconditioning increased phosphorylation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and heat shock protein 60 (HSP60) in CDC sheets. Our findings provide novel insights into the utility of hypoxic preconditioning in cell sheet-based technologies for the treatment of ischemic diseases.
The exon 19 and 21 in Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) mutation are the most common subtype of lung adenocarcinoma, and the strongest predictive biomarker for progression-free survival and tumor response. Although some studies have shown differences in radiological features between cases with and without EFGR mutations, they lacked necessary stratification. This article is to evaluate the association of CT features between the wild type and the subtype (exon 19 and 21) of EGFR mutations in patients with lung adenocarcinoma. Of the 721 finally included patients, 132 were positive for EGFR mutation in exon 19, 140 were positive for EGFR mutation in exon 21, and 449 were EGFR wild type. EGFR mutation in exon 19 was associated with a small-maximum diameter (28.51 ± 14.07) (p &lt; 0.0001); sex (p &lt; 0.0001); pleural retraction (p = 0.0034); and the absence of fibrosis (p &lt; 0.0001), while spiculated margins (p = 0.0095), subsolid density (p &lt; 0.0001) and no smoking (p &lt; 0.0001) were associated with EGFR mutation in exon 21. Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves suggested that the maximum Area Under the Curve (AUC) was related to the female gender (AUC = 0.636) and the absence of smoking (AUC = 0.681). This study demonstrated the radiological and clinical features could be used to prognosticate EGFR mutation subtypes in exon 19 and 21.
Nanostructured silica particles are commonly used in biomedical and biotechnical fields, as well as, in cosmetics and food industry. Thus, their environmental and health impacts are of great interest and effects after oral uptake are only rarely investigated. In the present study, the toxicological effects of commercially available nano-scaled silica with a nominal primary diameter of 12 nm were investigated on the human gastric carcinoma cell line GXF251L. Besides the analysis of cytotoxic and proliferative effects and the comparison with effects of particles with a nominal primary diameter of 200 nm, emphasis was also given to their influence on the cellular epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) signaling pathways-both of them deeply involved in the regulation of cellular processes like cell cycle progression, differentiation or proliferation. The investigated silica nanoparticles (NPs) were found to stimulate cell proliferation as measured by microscopy and the sulforhodamine B assay. In accordance, the nuclear level of the proliferation marker Ki-67 was enhanced in a concentration-dependent manner. At high particle concentrations also necrosis was induced. Finally, silica NPs affected the EGFR and MAPK pathways at various levels dependent on concentration and time. However, classical activation of the EGFR, to be reflected by enhanced levels of phosphorylation, could be excluded as major trigger of the proliferative stimulus. After 45 min of incubation the level of phosphorylated EGFR did not increase, whereas enhanced levels of total EGFR protein were observed. These results indicate interference with the complex homeostasis of the EGFR protein, whereby up to 24 h no impact on the transcription level was detected. In addition, downstream on the level of the MAP kinases ERK1/2 short term incubation appeared to affect total protein levels without clear increase in phosphorylation. Depending on the concentration range, enhanced levels of ERK1/2 phosphorylation were only observed after 24 h of incubation. Taken together, the present study demonstrates the potential of the tested silica particles to enhance the growth of gastric carcinoma cells. Although interference with the EGFR/MAPK cascade is observed, additional mechanisms are likely to be involved in the onset of the proliferative stimulus.
We report a hybrid glass-poly (dimethylsiloxane) microfluidic immunosensor for epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) determination, based on the covalent immobilization of anti-EGFR antibody (anti-EGFR) on amino-functionalized mesoporous silica (AMS) retained in the central channel of a microfluidic device. The synthetized AMS was characterized by N2 adsorption-desorption isotherm, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive spectrometry (EDS) and infrared spectroscopy. The cancer biomarker was quantified in human serum samples by a direct sandwich immunoassay measuring through a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-EGFR. The enzymatic product was detected at -100 mV by amperometry on a sputtering gold electrode, modified with an ordered mesoporous carbon (CMK-3) in a matrix of poly-acrylamide-co-methacrylate of dihydrolipoic acid (poly(AC-co-MDHLA)) through in situ copolymerization. CMK-3/poly(AC-co-MDHLA)/gold was characterized by cyclic voltammetry, EDS and SEM. The measured current was directly proportional to the level of EGFR in human serum samples. The linear range was from 0.01 ng mL(-1) to 50 ng mL(-1). The detection limit was 3.03 pg mL(-1), and the within- and between-assay coefficients of variation were below 5.20%. The microfluidic immunosensor is a very promising device for the diagnosis of several kinds of epithelial origin carcinomas.
Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is caused by mutations in the low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) gene. To study the impact of mutations affecting the hydrophobic transmembrane domain of the LDLR, each of the 22 amino acids of the transmembrane domain was individually mutated to arginine. The more centrally in the transmembrane domain an arginine was located, the lower amounts of the 120 kDa precursor LDLR in the endoplasmic reticulum were observed. This led to lower amounts of the 160 kDa mature LDLR on the cell surface. For the mutants V797R-LDLR, L798R-LDLR and L799R-LDLR a proportion of full-length receptors including the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains, was secreted into the endoplasmic reticulum lumen to appear in the culture medium. When the transmembrane domain of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) was replaced by that of the mutant L799R-LDLR, similar effects were observed for the EGFR as for L799R-LDLR. Introducing arginines in the transmembrane domain of the LDLR also affected metalloproteinase cleavage of the ectodomain and γ-secretase cleavage within the transmembrane domain. The most likely explanation for the low amounts of the 120 kDa precursor is that a basic residue in the hydrophobic transmembrane domain prevents the mutant LDLR from being inserted in the endoplasmic reticulum membrane from the Sec61 translocon complex. As a consequence, quality control systems could be activated. However, our data indicate that proteasomal degradation, lysosomal degradation, autophagy or ectodomain cleavage were not the underlying mechanism for degradation of these mutant LDLRs.
EphA2 has been implicated in amplifying ErbB2 tumorigenic signaling. One protein that interacts with EphA2 is the Anks1a PTB adaptor. However, the precise role of Anks1a in EphA2-mediated tumorigenesis is unclear. We demonstrated that Anks1a localizes to the ER upon phosphorylation and that the Ankyrin repeats and PTB of Anks1a bind to EphA2 and Sec23, respectively. Thus, Anks1a facilitates the selective packaging of EphA2 into COPII vesicles. Additionally, Anks1a knockout mice, a phenocopy of EphA2 knockout mice, exhibited markedly reduced ErbB2-induced breast tumorigenesis. Strikingly, ErbB2 did not localize to the cell surface following Anks1a knockdown in primary mammary tumor cells over-expressing ErbB2. Importantly, EphA2 was critical for stabilizing ErbB2 through complex formation, but its interaction with Anks1a also facilitated ErbB2 loading into COPII carriers. These findings suggest a novel role for Anks1a in the molecular pathogenesis of breast tumors and possibly other human diseases. [BMB Reports 2016; 49(12): 651-652].
Erbin, Lano, Scribble, and Densin-180 belong to LAP (leucine-rich repeats and PDZ domain) adaptor proteins involved in cell signaling pathways. Previously, we identified Erbin, Lano, and Scribble, but not Densin-180, in muscle cells, where they are involved in regulating the aggregation of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in vitro. Here, we analyzed their cellular localization at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) in skeletal muscles of mice. Erbin, Lano, and Scribble were significantly accumulated at NMJs and localized in different synaptic cells. Moreover, we used mouse mutants to analyze the role of Erbin at the NMJ. We used two Erbin mutant mouse strains that either completely lack Erbin protein (Erbin(null/null) ) or express a truncated Erbin mutant where the carboxy-terminal PDZ domain is replaced by β-galactosidase (Erbin(ΔC/ΔC) ) thereby abolishing its interaction with ErbB receptor tyrosine kinases. Neither the lack of the PDZ domain of Erbin, nor its complete absence interfered with the general localization of LAP proteins at NMJs, but Lano and Scribble transcript levels were up-regulated in homozygous Erbin-null muscles. Furthermore, grip strength was reduced and neural transmission impaired in homozygous aged Erbin-null but not Erbin-ΔC mice. Erbin-null skeletal muscles did not reveal any conspicuous impairment of the muscle fiber. Localization of other NMJ marker proteins was not affected either. Quantitative 3D morphometry showed that NMJs of Erbin-null muscles were significantly smaller and fragmented in the soleus. We speculate that Erbin, Lano, and Scribble act at the post-synaptic membrane of NMJs in a concerted fashion to regulate nicotinic acetylcholine receptors cluster morphology and neural transmission.

In contrast to other members of the EGF receptor family, ErbB3 is constitutively internalized in a clathrin-dependent manner. Previous studies have shown that ErbB3 does not interact with the coated pit localized adaptor complex 2 (AP-2), and that ErbB3 lacks two AP-2 interacting internalization signals identified in the EGF receptor. Several other clathrin-associated sorting proteins which may recruit cargo into coated pits have, however, been identified, and the study was performed to identify adaptors needed for constitutive internalization of ErbB3.
A high-throughput siRNA screen was used to identify adaptor proteins needed for internalization of ErbB3. Upon knock-down of candidate proteins internalization of ErbB3 was identified using an antibody-based internalization assay combined with automatic fluorescence microscopy.
Among 29 candidates only knock-down of epsin 1 turned out to inhibit ErbB3. Epsin 1 has ubiquitin interacting motifs (UIMs) and we show that ErbB3 interacts with an epsin 1 deletion mutant containing these UIMs. In support of an ErbB3-epsin 1 UIM dependent interaction, we show that ErbB3 is constitutively ubiquitinated, but that both ubiquitination and the ErbB3-epsin 1 interaction increase upon ligand binding.
Altogether the results are consistent with a model whereby both constitutive and ligand-induced internalization of ErbB3 are regulated through interaction with epsin 1.
Internalization is an important regulator of growth factor receptor mediated signaling and the current study identify mechanisms regulating plasma membrane turnover of ErbB3.
ERBB2 overexpression in human breast cancer leads to invasive carcinoma but the mechanism is not clearly understood. Here we report that TOM1L1 is co-amplified with ERBB2 and defines a subgroup of HER2(+)/ER(+) tumours with early metastatic relapse. TOM1L1 encodes a GAT domain-containing trafficking protein and is a SRC substrate that negatively regulates tyrosine kinase signalling. We demonstrate that TOM1L1 upregulation enhances the invasiveness of ERBB2-transformed cells. This pro-tumoural function does not involve SRC, but implicates membrane-bound membrane-type 1 MMP (MT1-MMP)-dependent activation of invadopodia, membrane protrusions specialized in extracellular matrix degradation. Mechanistically, ERBB2 elicits the indirect phosphorylation of TOM1L1 on Ser321. The phosphorylation event promotes GAT-dependent association of TOM1L1 with the sorting protein TOLLIP and trafficking of the metalloprotease MT1-MMP from endocytic compartments to invadopodia for tumour cell invasion. Collectively, these results show that TOM1L1 is an important element of an ERBB2-driven proteolytic invasive programme and that TOM1L1 amplification potentially enhances the metastatic progression of ERBB2-positive breast cancers.
The Arp2/3 complex is required for cell migration and invasion. The Arp2/3 complex and its activators, such as the WAVE complex, are deregulated in diverse cancers. Here we investigate the expression of Arpin, the Arp2/3 inhibitory protein that antagonises the WAVE complex.
We used qRT-PCR and reverse phase protein arrays in a patient cohort with known clinical parameters and outcome, immunofluorescence in breast biopsy cryosections and breast cancer cell lines.
Arpin was downregulated at the mRNA and protein levels in mammary carcinoma cells. Arpin mRNA downregulation was associated with poor metastasis-free survival (MFS) on univariate analysis (P=0.022). High expression of the NCKAP1 gene that encodes a WAVE complex subunit was also associated with poor MFS on univariate analysis (P=0.0037) and was mutually exclusive with Arpin low. Arpin low or NCKAP1 high was an independent prognosis factor on multivariate analysis (P=0.0012) and was strongly associated with poor MFS (P=0.000064).
Loss of the Arp2/3 inhibitory protein Arpin produces a similar poor outcome in breast cancer as high expression of the NCKAP1 subunit of the Arp2/3 activatory WAVE complex.
Targeted delivery of semiconductor quantum dots (Q Ds) to tumors overexpressing HER2 cancer marker has been. demonstrated on immunocompromised mice bearing human breast cancer xenografts. To obtain targeted QDs complexes we applied the approach based on the use of protein adaptor system, RNAase barnase and its inhibitor barstar. Specific binding to target cancer marker was achieved through bivalent fusion protein containing two fragments of4D5scFv recombinant antibody and a fragment of barnase. QDs were conjugated to barstar, and final assembly of targeted complexes was obtained through non-covalent specific interaction of barstar, attached to QD, and barnase, that is part of the recombinant targeting protein. The efficient delivery of QDs to HER2-expressing tumor demonstrates the possibilities and prospects of the approach for targeted delivery of nanoparticles to cancer cells in vivo as the way to improve the efficiency of diagnosis and promote development of therapies based on the use of nanoparticles.
Overexpression of the ErbB2/HER2 receptor tyrosine kinase occurs in up to 20% of human breast cancers and correlates with aggressive disease. Several efficacious targeted therapies, including antibodies and kinase inhibitors, have been developed but the occurring of resistance to these agents is often observed. New therapeutic agents targeting the endocytic recycling and intracellular trafficking of membrane in tumor cells overexpressing ErbB2 are actually in clinical development. Nevertheless the mechanisms underlying ErbB2 downregulation are still obscure. We have previously demonstrated that the overexpression of the p130Cas adaptor protein in ErbB2 positive breast cancer, promotes tumor aggressiveness and progression. Here we demonstrate that lowering p130Cas expression in breast cancer cells is sufficient to induce ErbB2 degradation by autophagy. Conversely, p130Cas overexpression protects ErbB2 from degradation by autophagy. Furthermore, this autophagy-dependent preferential degradation of ErbB2 in absence of p130Cas is due to an increased ErbB2 ubiquitination. Indeed, the overexpression of p130Cas impairs ErbB2 ubiquitination by inhibiting the binding of Cbl and CHIP E3 ligases to ErbB2. Finally, our results indicate that p130Cas-dependent ErbB2 protection from degradation by autophagy may alter the sensitivity to the humanized monoclonal antibody trastuzumab. Consistently, in human ErbB2 positive breast cancers that develop resistance to trastuzumab, p130Cas expression is significantly increased suggesting that elevated levels of p130Cas can be involved in trastuzumab resistance.
In the current study, the authors present a comprehensive genomic profile (CGP)-based study of advanced urothelial carcinoma (UC) designed to detect clinically relevant genomic alterations (CRGAs).
DNA was extracted from 40 µm of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded sections from 295 consecutive cases of recurrent/metastatic UC. CGP was performed on hybridization-captured, adaptor ligation-based libraries to a mean coverage depth of 688X for all coding exons of 236 cancer-related genes plus 47 introns from 19 genes frequently rearranged in cancer, using process-matched normal control samples as a reference. CRGAs were defined as GAs linked to drugs on the market or currently under evaluation in mechanism-driven clinical trials.
All 295 patients assessed were classified with high-grade (International Society of Urological Pathology classification) and advanced stage (stage III/IV American Joint Committee on Cancer) disease, and 294 of 295 patients (99.7%) had at least 1 GA on CGP with a mean of 6.4 GAs per UC (61% substitutions/insertions/deletions, 37% copy number alterations, and 2% fusions). Furthermore, 275 patients (93%) had at least 1 CRGA involving 75 individual genes with a mean of 2.6 CRGAs per UC. The most common CRGAs involved cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A (CDKN2A) (34%), fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) (21%), phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase catalytic subunit alpha (PIK3CA) (20%), and ERBB2 (17%). FGFR3 GAs were diverse types and included 10% fusions. ERBB2 GAs were equally divided between amplifications and substitutions. ERBB2 substitutions were predominantly within the extracellular domain and were highly enriched in patients with micropapillary UC (38% of 32 cases vs 5% of 263 nonmicropapillary UC cases; P&lt;.0001).
Using a CGP assay capable of detecting all classes of GA simultaneously, an extraordinarily high frequency of CRGA was identified in a large series of patients with advanced UC. Cancer 2016;122:702-711. © 2015 American Cancer Society.
N-cadherin has been reported to be upregulated and associated with metastasis and poor prognosis in prostate cancer patients, however the underlying mechanism still remains puzzling. In the present study, we found that upregulation of N-cadherin enhanced, while downregulation of N-cadherin impaired the invasion, migration, and epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) of prostate cancer (PCa) cells. Overexpression of N-cadherin increased the efficiency of colony and tumor spheroid formation and the stemness factor expression (including c-Myc, Klf4, Sox2 and Oct4), and vice versa. Furthermore, microarray analysis and western blot analysis mechanistically proved that N-cadherin activated ErbB signaling pathway by upregulating the expression of Grb2, pShc and pERK1/2. Importantly, the regulation of N-cadherin on EMT and stemness was counteracted by lapatinib, a specific ErbB signaling pathway inhibitor. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that N-cadherin regulates EMT and stemness of PCa cells via activating ErbB signaling pathway, which indicates the pivotal role of N-cadherin/ErbB axis in the metastasis of prostate cancer.
The clinicopathological significance of amplification was investigated of the gene encoding cyclin E (CCNE1) and we assessed whether CCNE1 was a potential target in endometrioid endometrial carcinomas. CCNE1 amplification and CCNE1 or F-box and WD repeat domain-containing 7 (FBXW7) expression in endometrial endometrioid carcinoma was assessed by immunohistochemistry and fluorescence in situ hybridization. CCNE1 knockdown by small interfering RNA (siRNA) was used to assess the CCNE1 function. The results showed that CCNE1 amplification was present in 9 (8.3%) of 108 endometrial carcinomas. CCNE1 amplification was correlated with high histological grade (Grade 3; p=0.0087) and lymphovascular space invasion (p=0.0258). No significant association was observed between CCNE1 amplification and FIGO stage (p=0.851), lymph node metastasis (p=0.078), body mass index (p=0.265), deep myometrial invasion (p=0.256), menopausal status (p=0.289) or patient age (p=0.0817). CCNE1 amplification was significantly correlated with shorter progression-free and overall survival (p=0.0081 and 0.0073, respectively). CCNE1 protein expression or loss of FBXW7 expression in endometrial endometrioid carcinoma tended to be correlated with shorter progression-free and overall survival; however, this difference was not statistically significant. Multivariate analysis showed that CCNE1 amplification was an independent prognostic factor for overall survival but not for progression-free survival (P=0.0454 and 0.2175, respectively). Profound growth inhibition was observed in siRNA-transfected cancer cells with endogenous CCNE1 overexpression compared with that in cancer cells having low CCNE1 expression. CCNE1 amplification was independent of p53, HER2, MLH1 and ARID1A expression but dependent on PTEN expression in endometrial carcinomas. These findings indicated that CCNE1 amplification was critical for the survival of endometrial endometrioid carcinomas. Furthermore, the effects of CCNE1 knockdown were dependent on the CCNE1 expression status, suggesting that CCNE1-targeted therapy may be beneficial for patients with endometrial endometrioid carcinoma having CCNE1 amplification.
Cell-based assays have the potential and advantage to identify cell-permeable modulators of kinase function, and hence provide an alternative to the conventional enzymatic activity-driven discovery approaches that rely on purified recombinant kinase catalytic domains. Here, we describe a domain-based high-content biosensor approach to study endogenous EGFR activity whereby EGF-induced receptor activation, subsequent trafficking, and internalization are imaged and quantified using time-dependent granule formation in cells. This method can readily be used to search for EGFR modulators in both chemical and RNAi screening; with potential applicability to other receptor tyrosine kinases.
The ErbB signaling network instructs the execution of key cellular programs, such as cell survival, proliferation and motility, through the generation of robust signals of defined strength and duration. In contrast, unabated ErbB signaling disrupts tissue homeostasis and leads to cell transformation. Cells oppose the threat inherent in excessive ErbB activity through several mechanisms of negative feedback regulation. Inducible feedback inhibitors (IFIs) are expressed in the context of transcriptional responses triggered by ErbB signaling, thus being uniquely suited to regulate ErbB activity during the execution of complex cellular programs. This review focuses on MIG6, an IFI that restrains ErbB signaling by mediating ErbB kinase suppression and receptor down-regulation. We will review key issues in MIG6 function, regulation and tumor suppressor activity. Subsequently, the role for MIG6 loss in the pathogenesis of tumors driven by ErbB oncogenes as well as in the generation of cellular addiction to ErbB signaling will be discussed. We will conclude by analyzing feedback inhibition by MIG6 in the context of therapies directed against ErbB and non-ErbB oncogenes.
The Hippo signaling pathway controls organ size and tumorigenesis through a kinase cascade that inactivates Yes-associated protein (YAP). Here, we show that YAP plays a central role in controlling the progression of cervical cancer. Our results suggest that YAP expression is associated with a poor prognosis for cervical cancer. TGF-α and amphiregulin (AREG), via EGFR, inhibit the Hippo signaling pathway and activate YAP to induce cervical cancer cell proliferation and migration. Activated YAP allows for up-regulation of TGF-α, AREG, and EGFR, forming a positive signaling loop to drive cervical cancer cell proliferation. HPV E6 protein, a major etiological molecule of cervical cancer, maintains high YAP protein levels in cervical cancer cells by preventing proteasome-dependent YAP degradation to drive cervical cancer cell proliferation. Results from human cervical cancer genomic databases and an accepted transgenic mouse model strongly support the clinical relevance of the discovered feed-forward signaling loop. Our study indicates that combined targeting of the Hippo and the ERBB signaling pathways represents a novel therapeutic strategy for prevention and treatment of cervical cancer.
Colorectal cancer is the third most common cancer worldwide, with 1.2 million patients diagnosed annually. In late-stage colorectal cancer, the most commonly used targeted therapies are the monoclonal antibodies cetuximab and panitumumab, which prevent epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) activation. Recent studies have identified alterations in KRAS and other genes as likely mechanisms of primary and secondary resistance to anti-EGFR antibody therapy. Despite these efforts, additional mechanisms of resistance to EGFR blockade are thought to be present in colorectal cancer and little is known about determinants of sensitivity to this therapy. To examine the effect of somatic genetic changes in colorectal cancer on response to anti-EGFR antibody therapy, here we perform complete exome sequence and copy number analyses of 129 patient-derived tumour grafts and targeted genomic analyses of 55 patient tumours, all of which were KRAS wild-type. We analysed the response of tumours to anti-EGFR antibody blockade in tumour graft models and in clinical settings and functionally linked therapeutic responses to mutational data. In addition to previously identified genes, we detected mutations in ERBB2, EGFR, FGFR1, PDGFRA, and MAP2K1 as potential mechanisms of primary resistance to this therapy. Novel alterations in the ectodomain of EGFR were identified in patients with acquired resistance to EGFR blockade. Amplifications and sequence changes in the tyrosine kinase receptor adaptor gene IRS2 were identified in tumours with increased sensitivity to anti-EGFR therapy. Therapeutic resistance to EGFR blockade could be overcome in tumour graft models through combinatorial therapies targeting actionable genes. These analyses provide a systematic approach to evaluating response to targeted therapies in human cancer, highlight new mechanisms of responsiveness to anti-EGFR therapies, and delineate new avenues for intervention in managing colorectal cancer.
The HER2/Neu protein is overexpressed in a large fraction of human breast cancers. NF-κB is one of several transcription factors that are aberrantly activated in HER2-positive breast cancers; however, the molecular mechanism by which HER2 activates NF-κB remains unclear. The CARMA3-BCL10-MALT1 (CBM) complex is required for GPCR- and EGFR-induced NF-κB activation. In the current study, the role of the CBM complex in HER2-mediated NF-κB activation and HER2-positive breast cancer was investigated. Interestingly, HER2-mediated NF-κB activation requires protein kinase C (PKC) activity rather than AKT activity. Using biochemical and genetic approaches, it was shown that the CBM complex is required for HER2-induced NF-κB activation and functionally contributes to multiple properties of malignancy, such as proliferation, avoidance of apoptosis, migration, and invasion, both in vitro and in vivo. In addition, CARMA3-mediated NF-κB activity was required for the upregulation of two matrix metalloproteinases (MMP), MMP1 and MMP13, both of which contribute to tumor metastasis. To further access the physiologic role of CBM complex-mediated NF-κB activation in HER2-positive breast cancer progression, Malt1 knockout mice (Malt1(-/-)) were crossed with MMTV-Neu mice, in which mammary tumors spontaneously developed with HER2 overexpression. We observed delayed onset and prolonged progression time in mammary tumors in Malt1 knockout mice compared with control mice. In summary, these data demonstrate that the CBM complex is a crucial component mediating HER2-induced NF-κB signaling and tumor malignancy in HER2-positive breast cancer.
The CBM complex bridges key signaling pathways to confer malignant phenotypes and metastatic potential in HER2-associated breast cancer.
PTPN12 is a cytoplasmic protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) reported to be a tumor suppressor in breast cancer, through its capacity to dephosphorylate oncogenic receptor protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs), such as ErbB2. However, the precise molecular and cellular impact of PTPN12 deficiency in breast cancer progression remains to be fully clarified. Here, we addressed this issue by examining the effect of PTPN12 deficiency on breast cancer progression in vivo, in a mouse model of ErbB2-dependent breast cancer using a conditional PTPN12-deficient mouse. Our studies showed that lack of PTPN12 in breast epithelial cells accelerated breast cancer development and lung metastases in vivo. PTPN12-deficient breast cancer cells displayed enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation of the adaptor Cas, the adaptor paxillin, and the kinase Pyk2. They exhibited no detectable increase in ErbB2 tyrosine phosphorylation. PTPN12-deficient cells were more resistant to anoikis and had augmented migratory and invasive properties. Enhanced migration was corrected by inhibiting Pyk2. PTPN12-deficient breast cancer cells also acquired partial features of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a feature of more aggressive forms of breast cancer. Hence, loss of PTPN12 promoted tumor progression in a mouse model of breast cancer, supporting the notion that PTPN12 is a tumor suppressor in human breast cancer. This function was related to the ability of PTPN12 to suppress cell survival, migration, invasiveness, and EMT and to inhibit tyrosine phosphorylation of Cas, Pyk2, and paxillin. These findings enhance our understanding of the role and mechanism of action of PTPN12 in the control of breast cancer progression.
Effective use of adenovirus-5 (Ad5) in cancer therapy is heavily dependent on the degree to which the virus's natural tropism can be subverted to one that favours tumour cells. This is normally achieved through either engineering of the viral fiber knob or the use of bispecific adaptors that display both adenovirus and tumour antigen receptors. One of the main limitations of these strategies is the need to tailor each engineering event to any given tumour antigen. Here, we explore bispecific adaptors that can utilise established anti-cancer therapeutic antibodies. Conjugates containing bacterially derived antibody binding motifs are efficient at retargeting virus to antibody targets. Here, we develop a humanized strategy whereby we synthesise a re-targeting adaptor based on a chimeric Ad5 ligand/antibody receptor construct. This adaptor acts as a molecular bridge analogous to therapeutic antibody mediated cross-linking of cytotoxic effector and tumour cells during immunotherapy. As a proof or principle, we demonstrate how this adaptor allows efficient viral recognition and entry into carcinoma cells through the therapeutic monoclonal antibodies Herceptin/trastuzumab and bavituximab. We show that targeting can be augmented by use of contemporary antibody enhancement strategies such as the selective elimination of competing serum IgG using "receptor refocusing" enzymes and we envisage that further improvements are achievable by enhancing the affinities between the adaptor and its ligands. Humanized bispecific adaptors offer the promise of a versatile retargeting technology that can exploit both clinically approved adenovirus and therapeutic antibodies.
Mig6 is a feedback inhibitor that directly binds, inhibits and drives internalization of ErbB-family receptors. Mig6 selectively targets activated receptors. Here we found that the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) phosphorylates Mig6 on Y394 and that this phosphorylation is primed by prior phosphorylation of an adjacent residue, Y395, by Src. Crystal structures of human EGFR-Mig6 complexes reveal the structural basis for enhanced phosphorylation of primed Mig6 and show how Mig6 rearranges after phosphorylation by EGFR to effectively irreversibly inhibit the same receptor that catalyzed its phosphorylation. This dual phosphorylation site allows Mig6 to inactivate EGFR in a manner that requires activation of the target receptor and that can be modulated by Src. Loss of Mig6 is a driving event in human cancer; analysis of 1,057 gliomas reveals frequent focal deletions of ERRFI1, the gene that encodes Mig6, in EGFR-amplified glioblastomas.
Epidermal growth factor (EGF) binding to its receptor (EGFR) activates several signaling intermediates, including Akt, leading to control of cell survival and metabolism. Concomitantly, ligand-bound EGFR is incorporated into clathrin-coated pits--membrane structures containing clathrin and other proteins--eventually leading to receptor internalization. Whether clathrin might regulate EGFR signaling at the plasma membrane before vesicle scission is poorly understood. We compared the effect of clathrin perturbation (preventing formation of, or receptor recruitment to, clathrin structures) to that of dynamin2 (allowing formation of clathrin structures but preventing EGFR internalization) under conditions in which EGFR endocytosis is clathrin dependent. Clathrin perturbation by siRNA gene silencing, with the clathrin inhibitor pitstop2, or knocksideways silencing inhibited EGF-simulated Gab1 and Akt phosphorylation in ARPE-19 cells. In contrast, perturbation of dynamin2 with inhibitors or by siRNA gene silencing did not affect EGF-stimulated Gab1 or Akt phosphorylation. EGF stimulation enriched Gab1 and phospho-Gab1 within clathrin structures. ARPE-19 cells have low ErbB2 expression, and overexpression and knockdown experiments revealed that robust ErbB2 expression bypassed the requirement for clathrin for EGF-stimulated Akt phosphorylation. Thus clathrin scaffolds may represent unique plasma membrane signaling microdomains required for signaling by certain receptors, a function that can be separated from vesicle formation.
Cancer therapy targeting the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)/erythroblastic leukemia viral oncogene B (ErbB)/human EGFR receptor (HER) family of tyrosine kinases has been successfully used in treatment of several malignancies. The ErbB pathways play a role in the maintenance of cardiac homeostasis. This article summarizes current knowledge about EGFR/ErbB/HER receptor-targeted cancer therapeutics focusing on their cardiotoxicity profiles, molecular mechanisms, and implications in clinical cardio-oncology. The article discusses challenges in predicting, monitoring, and treating cardiac dysfunction and heart failure associated with ErbB-targeted cancer therapeutics and highlights opportunities for researchers and clinical investigators.
The pathogenesis and progression of lung cancer is a complicated process in which many genes take part. But molecular gene testing is typically only performed in advanced-stage non-squamous non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The value of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) administration is not widely recognized with respect to early-stage NSCLC.
Here, we present a case of a man, heavy smoker who initially presented with stage IA lung adenocarcinoma (LADC). Three years after a lung lobectomy, he was diagnosed with advanced lung squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), according to laboratory, imaging, and pathological examinations.
The case initially had an early-stage LADC with an L858R epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation. A subsequent advanced SCC bearing EGFR L858R/T790M mutations occurred 3 years after surgery.
The comprehensive therapy we utilized, including surgical resection for the early-stage lesion and GP chemotherapy and local radiotherapy as the first line therapy along with gefitinib maintenance treatment for the advanced metachronous second primary tumors (MST).
The synthetical therapy, have resulted in our patient with remaining alive and progression free for 4.5 years.
This case suggests that changes in molecular pathology should be monitored closely throughout cancer progression to guide personalized therapy and improve prognosis. We further review administration of TKI to early-stage NSCLC and to the metachronous second primary tumors (MST) in survivors.
Persistent HPV infection alone is not sufficient for cervical cancer development, which requires additional molecular alterations for tumor progression and metastasis ultimately leading to a lethal disease. In this study, we performed a comprehensive analysis of HER family receptor alterations in cervical adenocarcinoma. We detected overexpression of HER protein, mainly HER2, which was an independent prognostic marker for these patients. By using in vitro and in vivo approaches, we provided evidence that HER inhibitors, allitinib and lapatinib, were effective in reducing cervical cancer aggressiveness. Furthermore, combination of these drugs with glucose uptake blockers could overcome the putative HIF1-α-mediated resistance to HER-targeted therapies. Thus, we propose that the use of HER inhibitors in association with glycolysis blockers can be a potentially effective treatment option for HER-positive cervical cancer patients.
In contrast to the established role of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors for the first-line treatment of patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring activating EGFR mutations, the role of EGFR blockade and of EGFR molecular testing in the second-line treatment remains less clear. The irreversible pan-ErbB family inhibitor afatinib (Gi(l)otrif(®)) was recently FDA- and EMA-approved for the second-line treatment of NSCLC with squamous cell histology irrespective of the EGFR mutational status (LUX-Lung 8). Contrariwise, results from the TAILOR and DELTA trials among retrospective biomarker analyses show the predictive value of the EGFR mutational status for efficacy of reversible EGFR inhibitors also as a second-line therapy. This mini review critically summarizes the current role of EGFR-targeting strategies in the second-line treatment of NSCLC with special respect to afatinib in light of emerging T790M-specific EGFR and immune check point inhibitors. The review also emphasizes the urgent need for reliable biomarkers to guide therapeutic decision-making and outlines prospective changes to the second-line landscape with some of the current second-line treatment concepts likely to be moved to the first-line.
HB-EGF plays an indispensable role in suppression of cell proliferation during mouse valvulogenesis. However, ligands of the EGF receptor (EGFR/ErbB1), including HB-EGF, are generally considered as growth-promoting factors as shown in cancers. HB-EGF binds to and activates ErbB1 and ErbB4. We investigated the role of ErbB receptors in valvulogenesis in vivo using ErbB1- and ErbB4-deficient mice, and an ex vivo model of endocardial cushion explants. We show that HB-EGF suppresses valve mesenchymal cell proliferation through a heterodimer of ErbB1 and ErbB4, and an ErbB1 ligand(s) promotes cell proliferation through a homodimer of ErbB1. Moreover, a rescue experiment with cleavable or uncleavable isoforms of ErbB4 in ERBB4 null cells indicates that the cleavable JM-a-type, but not the uncleavable JM-b-type, of ErbB4 rescues the defect of the null cells. These data suggest that the cytoplasmic intracellular domain of ErbB4, rather than the membrane-anchored tyrosine kinase, achieves this suppression. Our study demonstrates that opposing signals generated by different ErbB dimer combinations function in the same cardiac cushion mesenchymal cells for proper cardiac valve formation.
The addition of anti-human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-targeted drugs, such as trastuzumab, lapatinib, and trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1), to chemotherapy significantly improved prognosis of HER2-positive breast cancer patients. However, it was confused that metastatic patients vary in the response of targeted drug. Therefore, methods of accurately predicting drug response were really needed. To overcome the spatial and temporal limitations of biopsies, we aimed to develop a more sensitive and less invasive method of detecting mutations associated with anti-HER2 therapeutic response through circulating-free DNA (cfDNA).
From March 6, 2014 to December 10, 2014, 24 plasma samples from 20 patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer who received systemic therapy were eligible. We used a panel for detection of hot-spot mutations from 50 oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes, and then used targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) to identify somatic mutation of these samples in those 50 genes. Samples taken before their first trastuzumab administration and subsequently proven with clinical benefit were grouped into sensitive group. The others were collected after disease progression of the trastuzumab-based therapy and were grouped into the resistant group.
A total of 486 single-nucleotide variants from 46 genes were detected. Of these 46 genes, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase catalytic subunit alpha (PIK3CA), proto-oncogene c-Kit (KIT), and tumor protein p53 (TP53) were the most common mutated genes. Seven genes, including epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), G protein subunit alpha S (GNAS), HRas proto-oncogene (HRAS), mutL homolog 1 (MLH1), cadherin 1 (CDH1), neuroblastoma RAS viral oncogene homolog (NRAS), and NOTCH1, that only occurred m utations in the resistant group were associated with the resistance of targeted therapy. In addition, we detected a HER2 S855I mutation in two patients who had persistent benefits from anti-HER2 therapy.
Targeted NGS of cfDNA has potential clinical utility to detect biomarkers from HER2-targeted therapies.
Malignant mesothelioma remains an incurable cancer. We demonstrated that mesotheliomas expressed EGFR (79.2%), ErbB4 (49.0%) and HER2 (6.3%), but lacked ErbB3. At least one ErbB family member was expressed in 88% of tumors. To exploit ErbB dysregulation in this disease, patient T-cells were engineered by retroviral transduction to express a panErbB-targeted chimeric antigen receptor (CAR), co-expressed with a chimeric cytokine receptor that allows interleukin (IL)-4 mediated CAR T-cell proliferation. This combination is referred to as T4 immunotherapy. T-cells from mesothelioma patients were uniformly amenable to T4 genetic modification and expansion/enrichment thereafter using IL-4. Patient-derived T4(+) T-cells were activated upon contact with a panel of four mesothelioma cell lines, leading to cytotoxicity and cytokine release in all cases. Adoptive transfer of T4 immunotherapy to SCID Beige mice with an established bioluminescent LO68 mesothelioma xenograft was followed by regression or eradication of disease in all animals. Despite the established ability of T4 immunotherapy to elicit cytokine release syndrome in SCID Beige mice, therapy was very well tolerated. These findings provide a strong rationale for the clinical evaluation of intracavitary T4 immunotherapy to treat mesothelioma.
Prophylactic vaccination is typically utilized for the prevention of communicable diseases such as measles and influenza but, with the exception of vaccines to prevent cervical cancer, is not widely used as a means of preventing or reducing the incidence of cancer. Here, we utilize a peptide-based immunotherapeutic approach targeting ERBB3, a pseudo-kinase member of the EGFR/ERBB family of receptor tyrosine kinases, as a means of preventing occurrence of colon polyps. Administration of the peptide resulted in a significant decrease in the development of intestinal polyps in C57BL/6J-Apc(Min) mice, a model of familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP). In addition, even though they were not vaccinated, Apc(Min) offspring born to vaccinated females developed significantly fewer polyps than offspring born to control females. Lastly, to validate ERBB as a valid target for vaccination, we found no overt toxicity, increases in apoptosis, or morphological changes in tissues where Erbb3 was ablated in adult mice. These results indicate that prophylactic vaccination targeting ERBB3 could prevent the development of colon polyps in an at-risk patient population.
Most breast cancers arise from luminal epithelial cells and 25-30% of these tumours overexpress the ErbB2/HER2 receptor which correlates with disease progression and poor prognosis. The mechanisms of ErbB2 signalling and the effects of its overexpression are not fully understood. Herein, SILAC expression profiling and phosphopeptide enrichment of a relevant, non-transformed, immortalized human mammary luminal epithelial cell model were used to profile ErbB2-dependent differences in protein expression and phosphorylation events triggered via EGFR (EGF treatment) and ErbB3 (HRG1β treatment) in the context of ErbB2 overexpression. Bioinformatics analysis was used to infer changes in cellular processes and signalling events. We demonstrate the complexity of the responses to oncogene expression and growth factor signalling and identify protein changes relevant to ErbB2-dependent altered cellular phenotype, in particular cell cycle progression and hyper-proliferation, reduced adhesion and enhanced motility. Moreover, we define a novel mechanism by which ErbB signalling suppresses basal interferon signalling that would promote the survival and proliferation of mammary luminal epithelial cells. Numerous novel sites of growth factor-regulated phosphorylation were identified that were enhanced by ErbB2 overexpression and we putatively link these to altered cell behaviour and also highlight the importance of performing parallel protein expression profiling alongside phosphoproteomic analysis.
Lung cancer is among the leading cause of cancer-related-deaths and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the most common form of lung cancer. More than 70% of NSCLC patients have locally advanced or metastatic disease at diagnosis, which are then being treated with platinum-based chemotherapy or epidermal-growth-factor-receptor (EGFR) inhibitors in patients harboring activating EGFR-mutations. Several molecules which target multiple ErbB receptors and EGFR, have been developed, including geﬁtinib and erlotinib, although most of the patients become resistance. Therefore, identification of novel agents with less toxicity is warranted. Several interesting data has been reported about the antitumor activity of curcumin in several tumors, including lung, breast and colorectal cancers. In particular, a recent phase I trial evaluated the activity of curcumin in combination with FOLFOX chemotherapy in patients with inoperable colorectal cancer patients. They showed that curcumin added benefit in subsets of patients when administered with FOLFOX, and was well-tolerated chemotherapy adjunct. Another trial is now investigating the beneﬁcial effects of curcumin plus gefitinib or erlotinib for EGFR-mutant NSCLC, although this trial is ongoing. Improved understanding of molecular mechanisms behind resistance to EGFR TKIs suggest the importance of a genotype-guided approach to therapy and inhibition of parallel and downstream pathways, using agents which target heat-shock-protein-90, poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase, PI3K/mTOR pathway. The aim of the current review is to give an overview of the possible molecular mechanisms of curcumin in the preclinical and clinical investigations in solid tumors, with particular emphasis on its combination with other chemotherapeutic agents in lung cancers.
Recently, an association between Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCPyV) and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations in nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) was reported. However, the underlying carcinogenic effects and the prognosis related to MCPyV are still unclear. The aim of this study was to clarify the incidence and prognosis related to MCPyV infections in NSCLC.Tissue samples from 167 NSCLC patients (92 with squamous cell carcinomas [SCCs] and 75 with adenocarcinomas) were analyzed for the presence of MCPyV and EGFR mutations. Clinicopathological characteristics, disease-free survival rate, and overall survival rate were assessed with respect to MCPyV.MCPyV DNA was detected in 30 patients (18.0%) out of 167 patients, and EGFR mutations were found in 31 out of 127 patients (24.4%). EGFR mutations were more frequently detected in MCPyV-positive patients than in MCPyV-negative patients; however, this did not reach statistical significance (P = 0.075). There was no difference in overall survival between patients with and without MCPyV infections. The disease-free survival rate of patients with pN0 stage, SCC, or EGFR mutations was lower for patients with MCPyV than without MCPyV (P = 0.036, 0.042, and 0.050, respectively).Although the prevalence of MCPyV infection was relatively low, the presence of MCPyV DNA was significantly correlated with cancer prognosis in subgroups of NSCLC patients. These results suggest that MCPyV may be partly associated with pathogenesis and prognosis in some cases of NSCLC.
The discovery of reliable biomarkers to predict efficacy and toxicity of anticancer drugs remains one of the key challenges in cancer research. Despite its relevance, no efficient study designs to identify promising candidate biomarkers have been established. This has led to the proliferation of a myriad of exploratory studies using dissimilar strategies, most of which fail to identify any promising targets and are seldom validated. The lack of a proper methodology also determines that many anti-cancer drugs are developed below their potential, due to failure to identify predictive biomarkers. While some drugs will be systematically administered to many patients who will not benefit from them, leading to unnecessary toxicities and costs, others will never reach registration due to our inability to identify the specific patient population in which they are active. Despite these drawbacks, a limited number of outstanding predictive biomarkers have been successfully identified and validated, and have changed the standard practice of oncology. In this manuscript, a multidisciplinary panel reviews how those key biomarkers were identified and, based on those experiences, proposes a methodological framework-the DESIGN guidelines-to standardize the clinical design of biomarker identification studies and to develop future research in this pivotal field.
Recent reports suggested that essential directions for new lung cancer, breast carcinoma therapies, as well as the roomier realm of targeted cancer therapies were provided through targeting the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Patients who carrying non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) with activating mutations in EGFR initially respond well to the EGFR inhibitors erlotinib and gefitinib, which were located the active site of the EGFR kinase and designed to act as competitive inhibitors of combining with the ATP. However, patients who treatment by the erlotinib and gefitinib will relapse because of the emergence of drug-resistant mutations,with T790M mutations accounting for approximately 60% of all resistance. In order to overcome drug resistance, Pharmaceutical chemistry experts recently devoted great endeavors to the development of second-generation irreversible selective inhibitors which covalently modify Cys797 or Cys773 at the ATP binding cleft. Nevertheless, these inhibitors have not reached ideal effect of experts in patients with T790M positive mutation and apparently because of the dose-limiting toxicities associated with inhibition of wild type EGFR. A novel class of "third generation" EGFR TKIs have been developed that is sensitising and T790M mutant-specific whilst sparing WT EGFR, representing a significant breakthrough in the treatment in NSCLC patients with acquired resistance harboring these genotypes. Herein, we provides an overview of the second and third generation inhibitors currently approved, in clinical trial and also encompasses novel structures of discovery .This review mainly focuses on drug resistance, their mechanisms of action, development of structure-activity relationships and binding modes.

Dengue virus is the causative agent of dengue fever, dengue hemorrhagic fever, and dengue shock syndrome. High rates of dengue virus replication and virion production are related to disease severity. To identify anti-DENV compounds, we performed cell-based ELISA testing to detect the level of DENV E protein expression. Among a total of 83 inhibitors, eight were identified as inhibitors with antiviral activity. Epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitor II (EGFR/ErbB-2/ErbB-4 inhibitor II) and protein tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor IV (PTP inhibitor IV) significantly inhibited dengue virus production and demonstrated low toxicity in hepatocyte cell lines. Our results suggest the efficacy of tyrosine kinase/phosphatase inhibitors in decreasing dengue virus production in HepG2 cells.
Although chemopreventative agents targeting the estrogen/estrogen receptor (ER) pathway have been effective for ER(+) breast cancers, prevention of hormone receptor-negative breast cancers, such as Her2/erbB-2(+) breast cancers, remains a significant issue. Previous studies have demonstrated that administration of EGFR/erbB-2-targeting lapatinib to MMTV-erbB-2 transgenic mice inhibited mammary tumor development. The prevention, however, was achieved by prolonged high dose exposure. The tolerance to high dose/long-term drug administration may hinder its potential in clinical settings. Therefore, we aimed to test a novel, short-term chemopreventative strategy using lapatinib during the premalignant risk window in MMTV-erbB-2 mice.
We initially treated cultured cells with lapatinib to explore the anti-proliferative effects of lapatinib in vitro. We used a syngeneic tumor graft model to begin exploring the in vivo anti-tumorigenic effects of lapatinib in MMTV-erbB-2 mice. Then, we tested the efficacy of brief exposure to lapatinib (100 mg/kg/day for 8 weeks), beginning at 16 weeks of age, in the prevention of mammary tumor development in MMTV-erbB-2 mice.
In the syngeneic tumor transplant model, we determined that lapatinib significantly inhibited tumor cell proliferation. Furthermore, we demonstrated that short-term lapatinib exposure resulted in life-long protective effects, as supported by increased tumor latency in lapatinib-treated mice compared to the control mice. We further established that delayed tumor development in the treated mice was preceded by decreased BrdU nuclear incorporation and inhibited mammary morphogenesis. Molecular analysis indicated that lapatinib inhibited phosphorylation and expression of EGFR, erbB-3, erbB-2, Akt1, and Erk1/2 in premalignant mammary tissues. Also, lapatinib drastically inhibited the phosphorylation and expression of ERα and the transcription of ER target genes in premalignant mammary tissues. We also determined that lapatinib suppressed the stemness of breast cancer cell lines, as evidenced by decreased tumorsphere formation and ALDH(+) cell populations.
Taken together, these data demonstrate that brief treatment with EGFR/erbB-2-targeting agents before the onset of tumors may provide lifelong protection from mammary tumors, through the concurrent inhibition of erbB-2 and ER signaling pathways and consequential reprogramming. Our findings support further clinical testing to explore the benefit of shorter lapatinib exposure in the prevention of erbB-2-mediated carcinogenesis.
Melanoma remains one of the most aggressive and therapy-resistant cancers. Finding new treatments to improve patient outcomes is an ongoing effort. We previously demonstrated that melanoma relies on the activation of ERBB signaling, specifically of the ERBB3/ERBB2 cascade. Here we show that melanoma tumor growth is inhibited by 60% over controls when treated with lapatinib, a clinically approved inhibitor of ERBB2/EGFR. Importantly, tumor growth is further inhibited to 85% when the natural compound fucoidan from New Zealand U. pinnatifida is integrated into the treatment regimen. Fucoidan not only enhances tumor growth inhibition, it counteracts the morbidity associated with prolonged lapatinib treatment. Fucoidan doubles the cell killing capacity of lapatinib. These effects are associated with a further decrease in AKT and NFκB signaling, two key pathways involved in melanoma cell survival. Importantly, the enhancing cell killing effects of fucoidan can be recapitulated by inhibiting ERBB3 by either a specific shRNA or a novel, selective ERBB3 neutralizing antibody, reiterating the key roles played by this receptor in melanoma. We therefore propose the use of lapatinib or specific ERBB inhibitors, in combination with fucoidan as a new treatment of melanoma that potentiates the effects of the inhibitors while protecting from their potential side effects.
The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) belongs to ErbB family of tyrosine kinases, which plays an important role in the regulation of cell proliferation, survival, differentiation, and metastasis. In addition, tumors develop resistance to EGFR inhibitors due to the presence or development of point mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain of the receptor. There is an urgent need to develop new anti-EGFR agents with strong therapeutic activities. As the majority of anticancer drugs are of natural origin, natural products are a valuable source for the identification and development of novel treatment options for cancer. To identify promising new anti-tumor agents that act on the EGFR, numerous studies have been carried out and some investigators found natural products that could effectively inhibit the EGFR. This review summarizes the latest developments related to anti-EGFR agents derived from natural compounds and traditional Chinese medicine (TCM).
The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) family comprises the ErbB1 (EGFR) and ErbB4 receptors as well as the 'co-receptors' ErbB2 (which does not bind EGF ligands) and ErbB3 (which lack tyrosine kinase activity). This family of receptors is essential for cardiac development, myocardial, renal and vascular function, and cardiac responses to physiological and pathological perturbations. The EGFR appears critical in protecting cardiac cells from injury, while considerable attention has focussed on neuregulin/ErbB4 signalling in potentially ameliorating cardiomyopathy/heart failure. Indeed, the EGFRs provide a signalling nexus, upon which multiple cardioprotective stimuli appear to converge, including ischaemic preconditioning and various G protein-coupled receptors (opioid, muscarinic, adenosine, adrenergic, bradykinin, sphingosine 1-phosphate). These stimuli engage the EGFR axis (in a process referred to as transactivation) in differing ways, involving both G protein-dependent and -independent mechanisms, to promote myocardial cell survival during and following ischaemia/infarction. Elucidating the molecular processes that underpin EGFR transactivation and mediate cardiac protection will advance our understanding of the intrinsic capacity of the heart to withstand pathological insult. It should also reveal new approaches to facilitate cardioprotective therapy to limit damage during and following myocardial ischaemia/infarction, which despite intense investigation remains an unrealised, yet highly desirable, clinical goal. This review focuses on the cardiovascular functions of the EGFR, its role in cardioprotection, and the potential influences of common disease states on this signalling.
This study aimed to unravel the molecular mechanism of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). With microarray dataset GSE30784, differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified between OSCC and control samples. The DEGs overlapped with genes obtained from online database MalaCards were determined as OSCCDEG, followed by Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analysis. A total of 5177 up-regulated and 6081 down-regulated DEGs were identified between OSCC and control. Out of the DEGs, 451 genes were overlapped with the 704 genes gained from MalaCards and regarded as "OSCCDEG". Up-regulated OSCCDEG were associated with cell cycle pathway, while down-regulated OSCCDEG were linked to ErbB pathway. ANGPT1, ANGPT2 and 3 hub proteins (EGFR, HSP90AA1, RB1) in the PPI network were associated with the survival rates of several tumors. The largest network module with the hub protein EGFR was associated with positive regulation of cell communication. The second largest module with the hub node FN1 was related to angiogenesis. For the third network module in connection with DNA metabolism, the hub protein was PCNA. ErbB and cell cycle pathways were crucial for OSCC. EGFR, FN1, PCNA, ANGPT1 and ANGPT2 might be potential biomarkers for OSCC. These findings help provide guidelines for treating OSCC.
The Trastuzumab for gastric cancer (GC) trial identified human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) as a predictor of successful treatment with trastuzumab (HER2 receptor targeting agent) among patients with advanced/metastatic GC. To date, the prevalence of HER2 overexpression in the Korean population is unknown. The present study aimed to assess the incidence of HER2 positivity among GC and gastroesophageal (GE) junction cancer samples and the relationship between HER2 overexpression and clinicopathological characteristics in Korean patients.
Tumor samples collected from 1,695 patients with histologically proven GC or GE junction enrolled at 14 different hospitals in Korea were examined. After gathering clinicopathological data of all patients, HER2 status was assessed by immunohistochemistry (IHC) at each hospital, and IHC 2+ cases were subjected to silver-enhanced in situ hybridization at 3 central laboratories.
A total of 182 specimens tested positive for HER2, whereas 1,505 tested negative. Therefore, the overall HER2-positive rate in this study was 10.8% (95% confidence interval=9.3%-12.3%). The HER2-positive rate was higher among intestinal-type cases (17.6%) than among other types, and was higher among patients older than 70 years and 50 years of age, compared to other age groups.
Our evaluation of the HER2 positivity rate (10.8%) among Korean patients with GC and GE junction indicated the necessity of epidemiological data when conducting studies related to HER2 expression in GC and GE junction.
Purpose. We aimed to investigate the expression of pentose phosphate pathway- (PPP-) related proteins in metastatic breast cancer and its relationship with clinicopathologic factors. Methods. Tissue samples from 126 metastatic breast cancers were included in a tissue microarray. Expression of PPP-related proteins [glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH), 6-phosphogluconolactonase (6PGL), 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (6PGDH), and nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor (NRF2)] was determined by immunohistochemistry. Results. G6PDH (p = 0.011) and cytoplasmic NRF2 (p = 0.001) showed the highest expression in brain metastases. Human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER-2) positivity was associated with G6PDH (p &lt; 0.001) and cytoplasmic NRF2 (p = 0.015) positivity. A high Ki-67 labeling index (LI) was correlated with nuclear NRF2 positivity (p = 0.037), and HER-2-positive luminal B type was associated with G6PDH positivity (p = 0.001). On multivariate Cox analysis, independent risk factors of short overall survival were 6PGL positivity in bone metastasis (HR 4.180, 95% CI 1.160-15.06, p = 0.029) and low Ki-67 LI in lung metastasis (HR 11.853, 95% CI 1.841-76.30, p = 0.009). Conclusion. Differential expression of PPP-related proteins correlated with different prognoses and metastatic sites, with the highest expression in brain metastases, and could be a potential therapeutic target.
Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive (HER2+) breast cancer comprises approximately 15%-20% of all breast cancers and is associated with a poor prognosis. The introduction of anti-HER2 therapy has significantly improved clinical outcomes for patients with HER2+ breast cancer, and multiple HER2-directed agents (ie, trastuzumab, pertuzumab, lapatinib, and ado-trastuzumab emtansine [T-DM1]) are approved for clinical use in various settings. The treatment landscape for patients with HER2+ breast cancer is continuing to evolve. While novel agents and therapeutic strategies are emerging, biologic therapies, particularly trastuzumab, are likely to remain a mainstay of treatment. However, access issues create barriers to the use of biologics, and there is evidence for underuse of trastuzumab worldwide. A biosimilar is a biologic product that is highly similar to a licensed biologic in terms of product safety and effectiveness. Biosimilars of trastuzumab are in development and may soon become available. The introduction of biosimilars may improve access to anti-HER2 therapies by providing additional treatment options and lower-cost alternatives. Because HER2-targeted drugs may be administered for extended periods of time and in combination with other systemic therapies, biosimilars have the potential to result in significant savings for healthcare systems. Herein we review current and emerging treatment options for, and discuss the possible role of biosimilars in, treating patients with HER2+ breast cancer.
In this paper, structure-activity relationship (SAR, classification) and quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models have been established to predict the bioactivity of human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2) inhibitors. For the SAR study, we established six SAR (or classification) models to distinguish highly and weakly active HER2 inhibitors. The dataset contained 868 HER2 inhibitors, which was split into a training set including 580 inhibitors and a test set including 288 inhibitors by a Kohonen's self-organizing map (SOM), or a random method. The SAR models were performed using support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF) and multilayer perceptron (MLP) methods. Among the six models, SVM models obtained superior results compared with other models. The prediction accuracy of the best model (model 1A) was 90.27% and the Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) was 0.80 on the test set. For the QSAR study, we chose 286 HER2 inhibitors to establish six quantitative prediction models using MLR, SVM and MLP methods. The correlation coefficient (r) of the best model (model 4B) was 0.92 on the test set. The descriptors analysis showed that HAccN, lone pair electronegativity and π electronegativity were closely related to the bioactivity of HER2 inhibitors.
Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (Her2, an orphan receptor of ErbB family) is considered as an important biomarker as it plays a key role in the development and progression of aggressive types of breast, ovarian, stomach and gastric cancer. In the present study, we developed novel DNA aptamers against the extra-cellular domain (ECD) of Her2 protein for detection of Her2-positive carcinomas.
We cloned and expressed Her2-ECD protein in E. coli system. After purification, the protein was used as a bait for screening of specific DNA aptamer candidate from a pool of 10(14-15) random oligonucleotides through in vitro Systematic Evaluation of Ligands by Exponential Enrichment (SELEX) process. The aptamer-protein binding kinetics was elucidated by isothermal calorimetry. The specificity of FAM-labelled ECD_Apt1 towards Her2-positive cell lines was estimated by FACS and immunofluorescence assay. The specificity of the candidate was also verified with the tissue samples of breast cancer patients by immunohistochemistry process.
Among four selected candidates, ECD_Apt1 (having minimum ∆G = -3.24) showed the highest binding affinity (K d = 6.33 ± 0.86 nM) to Her2-ECD protein. The aptamer-protein sandwich assay showed a linear rise in chemiluminescence (at 490 nm wavelength) in the dynamic range of 100-700 nM ECD_Apt1 with a detection limit of 12.5 ± 2.5 ng/mL. Biotinylated ECD_Apt1 showed stronger cytoplasmic staining in Her2-positive breast cancer cell lines (SKBR3) compared to Her2-negative cells (MDA MB 231, MCF7). In paraffin-embedded breast cancer tissue sections, it showed specific and selective localization in the cytoplasmic niche of malignant duct cancer cells without any cross-reactivity to fibroblasts, inflammatory cells and adipocytes.
Binding assays, cytochemical and histochemical studies support ECD_Apt1 as a potential theranostic agent for Her2-positive carcinomas. ECD_Apt1 could be an effective low-cost alternative to conventional anti-Her2 antibody in solid phase immunoassays for cancer diagnosis and related applications.
Small molecules found in natural products provide therapeutic benefits due to their pharmacological or biological activity, which may increase or decrease the expression of human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER), a promising target in the modification of signaling cascades involved in excessive cellular growth. In this study, in silico molecular protein-ligand docking protocols were performed with AutoDock Vina in order to evaluate the interaction of 800 natural compounds (NPs) from the NatProd Collection (http://www.msdiscovery.com/natprod.html), with four human HER family members: HER1 (PDB: 2ITW), HER2 (PDB: 3PP0), HER3 (PDB: 3LMG) and HER4 (PDB: 2R4B). The best binding affinity values (kcal/mol) for docking pairs were obtained for HER1-podototarin (-10.7), HER2-hecogenin acetate (-11.2), HER3-hesperidin (-11.5) and HER4-theaflavin (-10.7). The reliability of the theoretical calculations was evaluated employing published data on HER inhibition correlated with in silico binding calculations. IC50 values followed a significant linear relationship with the theoretical binding Affinity data for HER1 (R = 0.656, p &lt; 0.0001) and HER2 (R = 0.543, p &lt; 0.0001), but not for HER4 (R = 0.364, p &gt; 0.05). In short, this methodology allowed the identification of several NPs as HER inhibitors, being useful in the discovery and design of more potent and selective anticancer drugs.
Mixed liposomes, obtained by coaggregation of 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine and of the synthetic monomer containing a gadolinium complex ([C18]2DTPA[Gd]) have been prepared. Liposomes externally decorated with KCCYSL (P6.1 peptide) sequence in its monomeric, dimeric, and tetrameric forms are studied as target-selective delivery systems toward cancer cells overexpressing human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER-2) receptors. Derivatization of liposomal surface with targeting peptides is achieved using the postmodification method: the alkyne-peptide derivative Pra-KCCYSL reacts, through click chemistry procedures, with a synthetic surfactant modified with 1, 2, or 4 azido moieties previously inserted in liposome formulation. Preliminary in vitro data on MDA-MB-231 and BT-474 cells indicated that liposomes functionalized with P6.1 peptide in its tetrameric form had better binding to and uptake into BT-474 cells compared to liposomes decorated with monomeric or dimeric versions of the P6.1 peptide. BT-474 cells treated with liposomes functionalized with the tetrameric form of P6.1 showed high degree of liposome uptake, which was comparable with the uptake of anti-HER-2 antibodies such as Herceptin. Moreover, magnetic MRI experiments have demonstrated the potential of liposomes to act as MRI contrast agents.
Neuregulins (Nrg) are a gene family that binds to tyrosine kinase receptors of the ErbB family. The protein of Nrg1 is to be involved in heart formation, migration of neurons, axonal pathfinding and synaptic function. A relation between Nrg1 and schizophrenia is assumed. Chronic impairment in schizophrenia is characterized by different positive and negative symptoms. Detectable markers of this disease in human and in animal models are activity, social behavior and sensory processing. In this study we compared heterozygous Nrg1 mutant mice in behavior and quantification of dopaminergic and serotoninergic neurons with wild type-like littermates. In the Nrg1 mutant mice the epidermal growth factor-like domain is replaced by the neomycin resistance gene. We found significant differences in locomotor and pain perception behavior. No differences were found in specific schizophrenia social interaction and prepulse inhibition behavior. The number of dopaminergic and serotoninergic neurons did not differ in the investigated regions ventral tegmental area, substantia nigra, periaqueductal grey and raphe nuclei. In conclusion, this analyzed Nrg1 mutant mice model did not serve as a complete schizophrenia model. Particular aspects of schizophrenia disease in locomotor and sensory behavior deficits could represent in this Nrg1 mutant mice. Beside several different models could Nrg1 deficiency represent an endophenotype of schizophrenia disease.
The challenge of crystallizing single-pass plasma membrane receptors has remained an obstacle to understanding the structural mechanisms that connect extracellular ligand binding to cytosolic activation. For example, the complex interplay between receptor oligomerization and conformational dynamics has been, historically, only inferred from static structures of isolated receptor domains. A fundamental challenge in the field of membrane receptor biology, then, has been to integrate experimentally observable dynamics of full-length receptors (e.g. diffusion and conformational flexibility) into static structural models of the disparate domains. In certain receptor families, e.g. the ErbB receptors, structures have led somewhat linearly to a putative model of activation. In other families, e.g. the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptors, structures have produced divergent hypothetical mechanisms of activation and transduction. Here, we discuss in detail these and other related receptors, with the goal of illuminating the current challenges and opportunities in building comprehensive models of single-pass receptor activation. The deepening understanding of these receptors has recently been accelerated by new experimental and computational tools that offer orthogonal perspectives on both structure and dynamics. As such, this review aims to contextualize those technological developments as we highlight the elegant and complex conformational communication between receptor domains.

The prognostic relevance of topoisomerase II alpha (TOP2A) copy number change remains not well established. This study is aimed to investigate the frequency and pattern of TOP2A aberrations; to correlate TOP2A alterations with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) status and clinicopathological parameters, and further to explore prognostic value of TOP2A and HER2 status in breast cancer in Taiwan.
We analyzed tissue samples from 311 invasive carcinomas in tissue microarrays for TOP2A and HER2 status by fluorescent in situ hybridization.
TOP2A copy number change is an infrequent genetic event (9.8% amplification and 2.7% deletion) and is present in both HER2-amplified and nonamplified tumors. TOP2A amplification is statistically associated with age &gt;50 at diagnosis (P = 0.016) and HER2 amplification (P &lt; 0.001). HER2 amplification, but not TOP2A amplification, is a predictor of unfavorable prognosis (P = 0.002). Univariate and multivariate analysis showed that higher histologic grading, positive nodal involvement, and HER2 positivity were associated with poorer overall survival. Cytogenetically, double minutes-type amplification is the predominant pattern for both genes (HER2: 64% and TOP2A: 93.1%). Homogeneous staining region-type signals of both genes are resistant to RNase digestion, supporting that these were not nuclear accumulation of mRNA transcripts.
Our results demonstrate the prognostic value of tumor grading, nodal involvement, and HER2 status in Taiwanese breast cancer. TOP2A aberrations are an infrequent event independent of HER2 status, and TOP2A amplification carries no prognostic value. The predictive value of TOP2A aberrations in patients of breast cancer taking athracycline-containing treatment in Taiwan remains to be determined in prospectively well-designed clinical trials.
Lapatinib is a candidate drug for treatment of trastuzumab-resistant, HER2-positive gastric cancer (GC). Unfortunately, lapatinib resistance renders this drug ineffective. The present study investigated the implication of forkhead box protein O1 (FOXO1) signaling in the acquired lapatinib resistance in HER2-positive GC cells.
Lapatinib-resistant GC cell lines (SNU-216 LR2-8) were generated in vitro by chronic exposure of lapatinib-sensitive, HER2-positive SNU-216 cells to lapatinib. SNU-216 LR cells with FOXO1 overexpression were generated by stable transfection of a constitutively active FOXO1 mutant (FOXO1A3). HER2 and MET in SNU-216 LR cells were downregulated using RNA interference. The sensitivity of GC cells to lapatinib and/or cisplatin was determined by crystal violet assay. In addition, Western blot analysis, luciferase reporter assay and RT-PCR were performed.
SNU-216 LR cells showed upregulations of HER2 and MET, but downregulation of FOXO1 compared to parental SNU-216 cells. FOXO1 overexpression in SNU-216 LR cells significantly suppressed resistance to lapatinib and/or cisplatin. In addition, FOXO1 negatively controlled HER2 and MET at the transcriptional level and was negatively controlled by these molecules at the post-transcriptional level. A positive crosstalk was shown between HER2 and MET, each of which increased resistance to lapatinib and/or cisplatin.
FOXO1 serves as an important linker between HER2 and MET signaling pathways through negative crosstalks, and is a key regulator of the acquired lapatinib resistance in HER2-positive GC cells. These findings provide a rationale for establishing a novel treatment strategy to overcome lapatinib resistance in a subtype of GC patients.
The aim of the present study was to identify genomic alterations in Taiwanese endometrial cancer patients. This information is vitally important in Taiwan, where endometrial cancer is the second most common gynecological cancer. We performed whole-exome sequencing on DNA from 14 tumor tissue samples from Taiwanese endometrial cancer patients. We used the Genome Analysis Tool kit software package for data analysis, and the dbSNP, Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer (COSMIC) and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) databases for comparisons. Variants were validated via Sanger sequencing. We identified 143 non-synonymous mutations in 756 canonical cancer-related genes and 1,271 non-synonymous mutations in non-canonical cancer-related genes in 14 endometrial samples. PTEN, KRAS and PIK3R1 were the most frequently mutated canonical cancer-related genes. Our results revealed nine potential driver genes (MAPT, IL24, MCM6, TSC1, BIRC2, CIITA, DST, CASP8 and NOTCH2) and 21 potential passenger genes (ARMCX4, IGSF10, VPS13C, DCT, DNAH14, TLN1, ZNF605, ZSCAN29, MOCOS, CMYA5, PCDH17, UGT1A8, CYFIP2, MACF1, NUDT5, JAKMIP1, PCDHGB4, FAM178A, SNX6, IMP4 and PCMTD1). The detected molecular aberrations led to putative activation of the mTOR, Wnt, MAPK, VEGF and ErbB pathways, as well as aberrant DNA repair, cell cycle control and apoptosis pathways. We characterized the mutational landscape and genetic alterations in multiple cellular pathways of endometrial cancer in the Taiwanese population.
Epidemiologic data for carcinogenicity in those exposed to lead (Pb) suggests relations with cancers although the totality of the evidence is inconsistent. Alterations in the expression of ERBB receptors have been studied during the development and malignant transformation of different kinds of human tumors where they induce proliferation, angiogenesis and metastasis generation. Relevant clinical data demonstrate the role of ERBB2 receptors in the development and malignancy of human cancers. Therefore, the objective of the present investigation is to give more information on the link between plasma mRNA expression in ERBB2 gene and lead blood levels in a healthy population. Blood samples, socio‑demographic, exposure and health data were obtained from 48 healthy men. Real‑time polymerase chain reaction assays were performed to detect ERBB2 gene transcripts, ΔΔCt method was used to quantify gene expression. Pb blood level was assayed using high‑resolution sector field inductively coupled mass spectrometry and is expressed in µg/dl. Plasma mRNA expression in ERBB2 gene was 6.44±3.07 ΔΔCt; Pb blood levels was 16.07±6.74 µg/dl. Regression analysis revealed a significant association (r2=0.5345; p&lt;0.0001) between Pb levels and mRNA expression in ERBB2. So far, it has still not been established if the expression of ERBB2 receptors is influenced by Pb exposure. On the base of the above reported data, we believe an in vitro study might be useful, to understand the molecular mechanisms implicated.
Effective bidirectional signalling between axons and Schwann cells is essential for both the development and maintenance of peripheral nerve function. We have established conditions by which human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived sensory neurons can be cultured with rat Schwann cells, and have produced for the first time long-term and stable myelinating co-cultures with human neurons. These cultures contain the specialized domains formed by axonal interaction with myelinating Schwann cells, such as clustered voltage-gated sodium channels at the node of Ranvier and Shaker-type potassium channel (Kv1.2) at the juxtaparanode. Expression of type III neuregulin-1 (TIIINRG1) in induced pluripotent stem cell-derived sensory neurons strongly enhances myelination, while conversely pharmacological blockade of the NRG1-ErbB pathway prevents myelination, providing direct evidence for the ability of this pathway to promote the myelination of human sensory axons. The β-secretase, BACE1 is a protease needed to generate active NRG1 from the full-length form. Due to the fact that it also cleaves amyloid precursor protein, BACE1 is a therapeutic target in Alzheimer's disease, however, consistent with its role in NRG1 processing we find that BACE1 inhibition significantly impairs myelination in our co-culture system. In order to exploit co-cultures to address other clinically relevant problems, they were exposed to anti-disialosyl ganglioside antibodies, including those derived from a patient with a sensory predominant, inflammatory neuropathy with mixed axonal and demyelinating electrophysiology. The co-cultures reveal that both mouse and human disialosyl antibodies target the nodal axolemma, induce acute axonal degeneration in the presence of complement, and impair myelination. The human, neuropathy-associated IgM antibody is also shown to induce complement-independent demyelination. Myelinating co-cultures using human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived sensory neurons thus provide insights into the cellular and molecular specialization of axoglial signalling, how pharmacological agents may promote or impede such signalling and the pathogenic effects of ganglioside antibodies.
Evidence that noncoding mutation can result in cancer driver events is mounting. However, it is more difficult to assign molecular biological consequences to noncoding mutations than to coding mutations, and a typical cancer genome contains many more noncoding mutations than protein-coding mutations. Accordingly, parsing functional noncoding mutation signal from noise remains an important challenge. Here we use an empirical approach to identify putatively functional noncoding somatic single nucleotide variants (SNVs) from liver cancer genomes. Annotation of candidate variants by publicly available epigenome datasets finds that 40.5% of SNVs fall in regulatory elements. When assigned to specific regulatory elements, we find that the distribution of regulatory element mutation mirrors that of nonsynonymous coding mutation, where few regulatory elements are recurrently mutated in a patient population but many are singly mutated. We find potential gain-of-binding site events among candidate SNVs, suggesting a mechanism of action for these variants. When aggregating noncoding somatic mutation in promoters, we find that genes in the ERBB signaling and MAPK signaling pathways are significantly enriched for promoter mutations. Altogether, our results suggest that functional somatic SNVs in cancer are sporadic, but occasionally occur in regulatory elements and may affect phenotype by creating binding sites for transcriptional regulators. Accordingly, we propose that noncoding mutation should be formally accounted for when determining gene- and pathway-mutation burden in cancer.
Afatinib (systematic name: N-{4-(3-chloro-4-fluoro-anilino)-7-[(tetra-hydro-furan-3-yl)-oxy]quinazolin-6-yl}-4-(di-methyl-amino)-but-2-enamide), is a specific in-hibitor of the ErbB family of tyrosine kinases. The free base form crystallizes from aceto-nitrile as a mixed water-aceto-nitrile solvent, C24H25ClFN5O3·0.25C2H3N·2H2O. It crystallizes with two independent mol-ecules (A and B) in the asymmetric unit of the chiral space group P4212, but exhibits close to perfect pseudo-inversion symmetry, emulating P4/ncc that relates the two mol-ecules to each other. Exact inversion symmetry is however broken by swapping of oxygen and CH2 moieties of the outer tetra-hydro-furanyl substituents of the two independent mol-ecules. This can, in turn, be traced back to C-H⋯N and C-H⋯O inter-actions of the aceto-nitrile solvent mol-ecules with the tetra-hydro-furan oxygen and CH2 units. In the crystal, neighboring mol-ecules are connected via N-H⋯O hydrogen bonds between the secondary amine and the amide keto O atom. Additional hydrogen bonds are formed through the water solvent mol-ecules, which are engaged in O-H⋯O and O-H⋯N hydrogen bonds connecting to the di-methyl-amino N atom, the amide keto O atom, and one of the quinazoline N atoms of a neighboring mol-ecule, leading to an intricate three-dimensional hydrogen-bonded superstructure. There are two types of channels stretching along the direction of the c axis; one along the fourfold rotational axis, occupied by aceto-nitrile solvent mol-ecules situated on that axis, and parallel channels which are not occupied by any solvent.
Dacomitinib - an irreversible pan-ErbB tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) - causes diarrhoea in 75% of patients. Dacomitinib-induced diarrhoea has not previously been investigated and the mechanisms remain poorly understood. The present study aimed to develop an in-vitro and in-vivo model of dacomitinib-induced diarrhoea to investigate underlying mechanisms. T84 cells were treated with 1-4 μM dacomitinib and resistance and viability were measured using transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) and XTT assays. Rats were treated with 7.5 mg/kg dacomitinib daily via oral gavage for 7 or 21 days (n = 6/group). Weights, and diarrhoea incidence were recorded daily. Rats were administered FITC-dextran 2 hours before cull, and serum levels of FITC-dextran were measured and serum biochemistry analysis was conducted. Detailed histopathological analysis was conducted throughout the gastrointestinal tract. Gastrointestinal expression of ErbB1, ErbB2, and ErbB4 was analysed using RT-PCR. The ileum and the colon were analysed using multiplex for expression of various cytokines. T84 cells treated with dacomitinib showed no alteration in TEER or cell viability. Rats treated with dacomitinib developed severe diarrhoea, and had significantly lower weight gain. Further, dacomitinib treatment led to severe histopathological injury localised to the ileum. This damage coincided with increased levels of MCP1 in the ileum, and preferential expression of ErbB1 in this region compared to all other regions. This study showed dacomitinib induces severe ileal damage accompanied by increased MCP1 expression, and gastrointestinal permeability in rats. The histological changes were most pronounced in the ileum, which was also the region with the highest relative expression of ErbB1. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
ErbB2 is a member of the ErbB family of tyrosine kinase receptors that plays a major role in breast cancer progression. Located at the plasma membrane, ErbB2 forms large clusters in spite of the presence of growth factors. Beta1 integrin, membrane receptor of extracellular matrix proteins, regulates adhesion, migration and invasiveness of breast cancer cells. Physical interaction between beta1 integrin and ErbB2 has been suggested although published data are contradictory. The aim of the present work was to study the interaction between ErbB2 and beta1 integrin in different scenarios of expression and activation. We determined that beta1 integrin and ErbB2 colocalization is dependent on the expression level of both receptors exclusively in adherent cells. In suspension cells, lack of focal adhesions leave integrins free to diffuse on the plasma membrane and interact with ErbB2 even at low expression levels of both receptors. In adherent cells, high expression of beta1 integrin leaves unbound receptors outside focal complexes that diffuse within the plasma membrane and interact with ErbB2 membrane domains. Superresolution imaging showed the existence of two distinct populations of ErbB2: a major population located in large clusters and a minor population outside these structures. Upon ErbB2 overexpression, receptors outside large clusters can freely diffuse at the membrane and interact with integrins. These results reveal how expression levels of beta1 integrin and ErbB2 determine their frequency of colocalization and show that extracellular matrix proteins shape membrane clusters distribution, regulating ErbB2 and beta1 integrin activity in breast cancer cells.
Hormone therapy has become one of the main strategy for breast cancer, however, many estrogen receptor(ER) positive patients ends in tumor collapse due to initial or acquired resistance to hormone treatment, which includes Fulvestrant. Here we report that ErbB Receptors and downstream PI3K/AKT and ERK pathway have been reactivated after treatment of Fulvestrant in ER positive MCF-7 and T47D cells, which are related to Fulvestrant resistance. HSP90 is a universally expressed chaperone protein and plays a vital role in both normal and cancer cells, HSP90 inhibitor AUY922 can reverse this feedback reactivation effect of Fulvestrant by targeting multiple proteins related in ErbB Receptors, PI3K/AKT and ERK pathway, which is much better than single targeting inhibitors. We also consolidate these effects in human fresh breast tumors. Combination of AUY922 and Fulvestrant may become a promising therapy strategy in breast cancer treatment.

ErbB proteins overexpression, in both normal and mutated forms, is associated with invasive forms of cancer prone to metastasis and with stronger antiapoptotic mechanisms and therefore more challenging to treat. Downstream effectors of ErbB receptors mediating these phenotypic traits include MAPK, STAT, and PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathways. Various phytochemical compounds were studied for their large number of biological effects including anticancer activity. Among these compounds, epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), the main catechin from green tea leaves, and curcumin, component of the curry powder, constituted the object of numerous studies. Both compounds were shown to act directly either on ErbB expression, or on their downstream signaling molecules. In this paper we aim to review the involvement of ErbB proteins in cancer as well as the biologic activity of EGCG and curcumin in ErbB expressing and overexpressing malignancies. The problems arising in the administration of the two compounds due to their reduced bioavailability when orally administered, as well as the progress made in this field, from using novel formulations to improved dosing regimens or improved synthetic analogs, are also discussed.
Drugs that inhibit the erb-b2 receptor tyrosine kinase 2 (ERBB2 or HER2) are the standard treatment of patients with different types of cancer, including HER2-overexpressing gastroesophageal tumors. Unfortunately, cancer cells become resistant to these drugs, so overall these drugs provide little benefit to patients with these tumors. We investigated mechanisms that mediate resistance of esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) cells and patient-derived xenograft (PDX) tumors to ERBB inhibitors.
We cultured primary tumor cells, isolated from EAC patient samples, and OE19 and OE33 EAC cell lines with trastuzumab (an inhibitor of HER2), with or without pertuzumab (inhibits dimerization of HER2 with HER3) or a specific antibody against HER3 (anti-HER3). HER2 was knocked down by expression of small hairpin RNAs. In addition, cells were incubated with NRG1-beta, a mediator of HER2-HER3 signaling, or A83-01, an inhibitor of transforming growth factor beta (TGFB) signaling. Cells were analyzed for markers of the epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) using flow cytometry, immunofluorescence, and quantitative reverse transcription PCR. We performed limiting dilution, transwell, and cell viability assays to study the functional effects of HER2 and HER3 inhibition and reactivation. We analyzed publicly available EAC gene expression datasets to correlate expression of ERBB genes with genes encoding epithelial and mesenchymal proteins. NSG mice were given subcutaneous injections of AMC-EAC-007B cells and also given injections of single or combined inhibitors; growth of these PDX tumors was quantified.
EAC cells incubated with trastuzumab decreased expression of epithelial markers (CD24, CD29, and CDH1) and increased expression of mesenchymal markers (CXCR4, VIM, ZEB1, SNAI2, and CDH2), compared to cells not exposed to trastuzumab, indicating induction of EMT. Addition of NRG1-beta to these cells restored their epithelial phenotype. Incubation of EAC cells with trastuzumab and pertuzumab accelerated the expression of EMT markers, compared to cells incubated with trastuzumab alone. EAC cells cultured for 2 months with a combination of trastuzumab and pertuzumab became resistant to chemotherapeutic agents (5-fluoruracil, carboplatin, cisplatin, eribulin, and paclitaxel), based on their continued viability, which was accompanied with an enhanced migratory capacity in transwell assays, and clonogenicity in limiting dilution analyses. In comparisons of EAC gene expression patterns, we associated high expression of ERBB3 with an epithelial gene expression signature; expression of transforming growth factor beta (TGFB) correlated with expression of EMT-related genes, and we found an inverse correlation between expression of TGFB1 and ERBB3. EAC cells incubated with ERBB inhibitors began to secrete ligands for the TGFB receptor and underwent EMT. Incubation of EAC cells with trastuzumab, followed by 10 days incubation with the TGFB receptor inhibitor in the presence of trastuzumab, caused cells to regain an epithelial phenotype. EAC patient-derived xenograft tumors grew more slowly in mice given the combination of trastuzumab, pertuzumab, and the TGFB inhibitor than in mice given single agents or a combination of trastuzumab and pertuzumab. Tumors exposed to trastuzumab and pertuzumab expressed EMT markers o and were poorly differentiated, whereas tumors exposed to the combination of trastuzumab, pertuzumab, and the TGFB inhibitor expressed epithelial markers and were more differentiated.
EAC cells become resistant to trastuzumab and pertuzumab by activating TGFB signaling, which induces EMT. Agents that block TGFB signaling can increase the anti-tumor efficacies of trastuzumab and pertuzumab.
Adolescence is a critical period in brain development. During this critical period the seeking for hedonic activities is increased, and their activity signals are stronger than the regulatory signals of judgment and reasoning. We recently reported that alteration of ErbB signaling during this period led to elevated striatal dopamine levels and reduced preference for sweetness without affecting locomotor activity and exploratory behavior. In the current study, we extend our findings and explore whether inhibition of the ErbB pathway during adolescence or adulthood also affects alcohol preference (hedonic "liking"), avoidance learning, and motivational reward "wanting". We demonstrated that chronic administration of the pan-ErbB kinase inhibitor JNJ28871063 (JNJ) to adolescent mice, but not to adult mice, reduced alcohol preference compared with the saline-injected group, without affecting avoidance learning as measured by increasing concentrations of quinine in the bitter avoidance test. Adolescent JNJ-treated mice continue to demonstrate less alcohol preference in adulthood compared with their saline-injected controls. In addition, adolescent JNJ-treated mice and their saline-injected controls did not differ in the time they spent in the food-condition chamber, and in their preference for social odor. In contrast to adolescent JNJ- treated mice, blocking the pathway during adulthood alter the preference to natural reward. These data support our initial findings that interruption of the ErbB pathway during adolescence emerges in a reduced hedonic capacity that persists into adulthood, without disturbing avoidance and reward learning. In addition, this paper provides a further behavioral role of the ErbB signaling pathway in the reward system, and suggests a different time period for the involvement of the pathway in the "liking" and the "wanting" components of the system.
Carfilzomib is a Food and Drug Administration-approved selective proteasome inhibitor for patients with multiple myeloma (MM). However, recent studies indicate that MM cells still develop resistance to carfilzomib, and the molecular mechanisms associated with carfilzomib resistance have not been studied in detail. In this study, to better understand its potential resistant effect and its underlying mechanisms in MM, microarray gene expression profile associated with carfilzomib-resistant KMS-11 and its parental cell line was downloaded from Gene Expression Omnibus database. Raw fluorescent signals were normalized and differently expressed genes were identified using Significance Analysis of Microarrays method. Genetic interaction network was expanded using String, a biomolecular interaction network JAVA platform. Meanwhile, molecular function, biological process and signaling pathway enrichment analysis were performed based on Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes. Totally, 27 upregulated and 36 downregulated genes were identified and a genetic interaction network associated with the resistant effect was expanded basing on String, which consisted of 100 nodes and 249 edges. In addition, signaling pathway enrichment analysis indicated that cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, autophagy, ErbB signaling pathway, microRNAs in cancer and fatty acid metabolism pathways were aberrant in carfilzomib-resistant KMS-11 cells. Thus, in this study, we demonstrated that carfilzomib potentially conferred drug resistance to KMS-11 cells by cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, autophagy, ErbB signaling pathway, microRNAs in cancer and fatty acid metabolism pathways, which may provide some potential molecular therapeutic targets for drug combination therapy against carfilzomib resistance.
Altered neuregulin 1 (Nrg1)/ErbB signaling and glutamatergic hypofunction have been implicated in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. Here, we employed gene chimeric ventral hippocampus (vHipp)-nucleus accumbens (nAcc) coculture from mouse, electrophysiology, immunocytochemistry, FM1-43 vesicle fusion, and electron microscopy techniques to examine the pre- and postsynaptic mechanisms of genetic deficits in Nrg1/ErbB signaling-induced glutamatergic dysfunctions. Reduced presynaptic type III Nrg1 expression along vHipp axons decreases the number of glutamate synapses and impairs GluA2 trafficking in the postsynaptic nAcc neurons, resulting in decreased frequency and amplitude of miniature EPSCs (mEPSCs). Reduced expression of axonal type III Nrg1 along vHipp projections also decreases functional synaptic vesicle (SV) clustering and vesicular trafficking to presynaptic vHipp axonal terminals. These findings suggest that Nrg1/ErbB signaling modulate glutamatergic transmission via both pre- and postsynaptic mechanisms.
To explore novel therapeutic target of cisplatin resistance in human gastric cancer.
The sensitivity of SGC7901 cells and cisplatin-resistant SGC7901 cells (SGC7901/DDP) for cisplatin were detected by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. High-quality total RNA which isolated from SGC7901/DDP cells and SGC7901 cells were used for mRNA microarray analysis. Results were analyzed bioinformatically to predict their roles in the development of cisplatin resistance and the expression of 13 dysregulated mRNAs we selected were validated by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR).
SGC7901/DDP cells highly resistant to cisplatin demonstrated by MTT assay. A total of 1308 mRNAs (578 upregulated and 730 downregulated) were differentially expressed (fold change ≥ 2 and P-value &lt; 0.05) in the SGC7901/DDP cells compared with SGC7901 cells. The expression of mRNAs detected by qRT-PCR were consistent with the microarray results. Gene Ontology, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway and protein-protein interaction analysis demonstrated that the differentially expressed mRNAs were enriched in PI3K-Akt, Notch, MAPK, ErbB, Jak-STAT, NF-kappaB signaling pathways which may be involved in cisplatin resistance. Several genes such as PDE3B, VEGFC, IGFBP3, TLR4, HIPK2 and EGF may associated with drug resistance of gastric cancer cells to cisplatin.
Exploration of those altered mRNAs may provide more promising strategy in diagnosis and therapy for gastric cancer with cisplatin resistance.
Cardiac microvascular endothelial cells (CMECs) are important angiogenic components and are injured rapidly after cardiac ischaemia and anoxia. Cardioprotective effects of Qiliqiangxin (QL), a traditional Chinese medicine, have been displayed recently. This study aims to investigate whether QL could protect CMECs against anoxic injury and to explore related signalling mechanisms. CMECs were successfully cultured from Sprague-Dawley rats and exposed to anoxia for 12 hrs in the absence and presence of QL. Cell migration assay and capillary-like tube formation assay on Matrigel were performed, and cell apoptosis was determined by TUNEL assay and caspase-3 activity. Neuregulin-1 (NRG-1) siRNA and LY294002 were administrated to block NRG-1/ErbB and PI3K/Akt signalling, respectively. As a result, anoxia inhibited cell migration, capillary-like tube formation and angiogenesis, and increased cell apoptosis. QL significantly reversed these anoxia-induced injuries and up-regulated expressions of NRG-1, phospho-ErbB2, phospho-ErbB4, phospho-Akt, phospho-mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in CMECs, while NRG-1 knockdown abolished the protective effects of QL with suppressed NRG-1, phospho-ErbB2, phospho-ErbB4, phospho-Akt, phospho-mTOR, HIF-1α and VEGF expressions. Similarly, LY294002 interrupted the beneficial effects of QL with down-regulated phospho-Akt, phospho-mTOR, HIF-1α and VEGF expressions. However, it had no impact on NRG-1/ErbB signalling. Our data indicated that QL could attenuate anoxia-induced injuries in CMECs via NRG-1/ErbB signalling which was most probably dependent on PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway.
Although ErbB receptors have been implicated in prostate cancer progression, ErbB-directed drugs have not proven effective for prostate cancer treatment. The ErbB3-binding protein EBP1 affects both ErbB2 and androgen receptor signaling, two components of the response to ErbB-targeted therapies. We therefore examined the effects of EBP1 expression on the response to the ErbB1/2 tyrosine kinase inhibitor lapatinib. We found a negative correlation between endogenous EBP1 levels and lapatinib sensitivity in prostate cancer cell lines. We then overexpressed or inhibited expression of EBP1. Silencing EBP1 expression increased lapatinib sensitivity and overexpression of EBP1 increased resistance in androgen-containing media. Androgen depletion resulted in an increased sensitivity of androgen-dependent EBP1 expressing cells to lapatinib, but did not affect the lapatinib sensitivity of hormone resistant cells. However, EBP1 silenced cells were still more sensitive to lapatinib than EBP1-expressing cells in the absence of androgens. The increase in sensitivity to lapatinib following EBP1 silencing was associated with increased ErbB2 levels. In addition, lapatinib treatment increased ErbB2 levels in sensitive cells that express low levels of EBP1, but decreased ErbB2 levels in resistant EBP1-expressing cells. In contrast, ErbB3 and phospho ErbB3 levels were not affected by either changes in EBP1 levels or lapatinib treatment. The production of the ErbB3/4 ligand heregulin was increased in EBP1-silenced cells. EBP1-induced changes in AR levels were not associated with changes in lapatinib sensitivity. These studies suggest that the ability of EBP1 to activate ErbB2 signaling pathways results in increased lapatinib sensitivity.
Signal transduction pathways essential for the survival and viability of the cell and that frequently present aberrant expression or function in tumors are attractive targets for pharmacological intervention in human cancers. In this short review we will describe the regulation exerted by the calcium-receptor protein calmodulin (CaM) on signaling routes involving the family of ErbB receptors - highlighting the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR/ErbB1) and ErbB2 - and the adaptor protein Grb7, a downstream signaling component of these receptors. The signaling mechanism of the ErbB/Grb7 axis and the regulation exerted by CaM on this pathway will be described. We will present a brief overview of the current efforts to inhibit the hyperactivity of ErbB receptors and Grb7 in tumors. The currently available information on targeting the CaM-binding site of these signaling proteins will be analyzed, and the pros and cons of directly targeting CaM versus the CaM-binding domain of the ErbB receptors and Grb7 as potential anti-cancer therapy will be discussed.
The propagation of phosphorylation downstream of receptor tyrosine kinases is a key dynamic cellular event involved in signal transduction, which is often deregulated in disease states such as cancer. Probing phosphorylation dynamics is therefore crucial for understanding receptor tyrosine kinases' function and finding ways to inhibit their effects. MS methods combined with metabolic labeling such as stable isotope labeling with amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) have already proven successful in deciphering temporal phosphotyrosine perturbations. However, they are limited in terms of multiplexing, and they also are time consuming, because several experiments need to be performed separately. Here, we introduce an innovative approach based on 5-plex SILAC that allows monitoring of phosphotyrosine signaling perturbations induced by a drug treatment in one single experiment. Using this new labeling strategy specifically tailored for phosphotyrosines, it was possible to generate the time profiles for 318 unique phosphopeptides belonging to 215 proteins from an erlotinib-treated breast cancer cell line model. Hierarchical clustering of the time profiles followed by pathway enrichment analysis highlighted epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR or ErbB1) and ErbB2 signaling as the major pathways affected by erlotinib, thereby validating the method. Moreover, based on the similarity of its time profile to those of other proteins in the ErbB pathways, the phosphorylation at Tyr453 of protein FAM59A, a recently described adaptor of EGFR, was confirmed as tightly involved in the signaling cascade. The present investigation also demonstrates the remote effect of EGFR inhibition on ErbB3 phosphorylation sites such as Tyr1289 and Tyr1328, as well as a potential feedback effect on Tyr877 of ErbB2. Overall, the 5-plex SILAC is a straightforward approach that extends sample multiplexing and builds up the arsenal of methods for tyrosine phosphorylation dynamics.
Lapatinib is characterized as an ErbB1/ErbB2 dual inhibitor and has recently been approved for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer. In this study, we examined mechanisms associated with enhancing the activity of lapatinib via combination with other therapies.
In the present studies, estrogen receptor (ER) positive and ER negative breast cancer cells were genetically manipulated to up- or downregulate eIF2-alpha, its phospho-mutant, Nck1, or Nck2, then treated with OSU-03012, lapatinib or the combination and assayed for cytotoxicity/cytostaticity using clonogenic assays.
Treatment of breast cancer cell lines with lapatinib and OSU-03012 (a small molecule derivative of the Cox-2 inhibitor celecoxib) induced synergistic cytotoxic/cytostatic effects. This combination therapy corresponded to an increase in the phosphorylation of eIF2-α at serine⁵¹ and a decrease in Nck1 expression. Ectopic expression of phospho-mutant eIF2-α (Ser⁵¹Ala) or downregulation of eIF2-α in addition to downregulation of the eIF2-α kinase PERK inhibited the synergistic and cytotoxic effects. Furthermore, ectopic expression of Nck1, but not Nck2 abolished the decrease in cell viability observed in combination-treated cells. Downregulation of Nck1 failed to "rescue" the ablation of the cytotoxic/cytostatic effects by the phospho-mutant of eIF2-α (Ser⁵¹Ala) demonstrating that Nck1 downregulation is upstream of eIF2-α phosphorylation in the anti-survival pathway activated by lapatinib and OSU-03012 treatment. Finally, co-immunoprecipitation assays indicated that eIF2-α dissociates from the Nck1/PP1 complex after OSU-03012 and lapatinib co-treatment.
These data indicate that OSU-03012 and lapatinib co-treatment is an effective combination therapy, which functions to enhance cell killing through the Nck1/eIF2 complex. Hence, this complex is a novel target for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer.
Heteromerization can play an important role in regulating the activation and/or signal transduction of most forms of receptors, including receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs). The study of receptor heteromerization has evolved extensively with the emergence of resonance energy transfer based approaches such as bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET). Here, we report an adaptation of our Receptor-Heteromer Investigation Technology (Receptor-HIT) that has recently been published as the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) Heteromer Identification Technology (GPCR-HIT). We now demonstrate the utility of this approach for investigating RTK heteromerization by examining the functional interaction between the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor (EGFR; also known as erbB1/HER1) and heregulin (HRG) receptor 3 (HER3; also known as erbB3) in live HEK293FT cells using recruitment of growth factor receptor-bound protein 2 (Grb2) to the activated receptors. We found that EGFR and HER3 heteromerize specifically as demonstrated by HRG inducing a BRET signal between EGFR/Rluc8 and Grb2/Venus only when HER3 was co-expressed. Similarly, EGF stimulation promoted a specific BRET signal between HER3/Rluc8 and Grb2/Venus only when EGFR was co-expressed. Both EGF and HRG effects on Grb2 interaction are dose-dependent, and specifically blocked by EGFR inhibitor AG-1478. Furthermore, truncation of HER3 to remove the putative Grb2 binding sites appears to abolish EGF-induced Grb2 recruitment to the EGFR-HER3 heteromer. Our results support the concept that EGFR interacts with Grb2 in both constitutive and EGF-dependent manners and this interaction is independent of HER3 co-expression. In contrast, HER3-Grb2 interaction requires the heteromerization between EGFR and HER3. These findings clearly indicate the importance of EGFR-HER3 heteromerization in HER3-mediated Grb2-dependent signaling pathways and supports the central role of HER3 in the diversity and regulation of HER family functioning.
Toll-like receptors (TLRs) recognize specific microbial products and elicit innate immune signals to activate specific transcription factors that induce protective proteins, such as interferon. TLR3 is localized to endosomes and recognizes double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), which is generated by virally infected or apoptotic cells. TLR3 has been genetically linked to several human diseases, including some without viral etiology. Unlike other TLRs, TLR3 requires phosphorylation of two specific tyrosine residues in its cytoplasmic domain to recruit the adaptor protein TRIF (Toll-interleukin-1 receptor domain-containing adaptor protein inducing interferon-β) and initiate the antiviral response. We showed that two protein tyrosine kinases, the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) ErbB1 and Src, bound sequentially to dsRNA-activated TLR3 and phosphorylated the two tyrosine residues. In cells lacking EGFR or treated with an inhibitor of EGFR, viral replication was enhanced and induction of antiviral genes was impaired. Thus, these results reveal a connection between antiviral innate immunity and cell growth regulators.
Aberrations within the phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K) pathway occur in greater than 45% of ovarian carcinomas. The PI3K cascade transmits signals from ErbB receptors downstream to S6 and 4EBP1, which are involved in protein biosynthesis. Many ovarian carcinomas reveal hyperactivation of ErbB1 (epidermal growth factor receptor) or ErbB2 (HER2/neu). Unfortunately, the benefit of anti-ErbB drugs is yet rather limited in ovarian carcinomas. Thus, novel targeting strategies are needed for ovarian carcinomas. The lipogenic enzyme fatty acid synthase (FASN) is overexpressed in approximately 80% of ovarian carcinomas. It stimulates cell growth and signifies poor prognosis. FASN inhibition impedes (ErbB) membrane receptor signaling and sensitizes cells against anti-ErbB drugs. Here, we show that the FASN inhibitor C75 and FASN-targeting siRNAs abrogate growth, induce apoptosis, and downregulate phosphorylation/expression of the PI3K effectors AKT, mTOR, p70S6K, S6, and 4EBP1. In contrast, FASN inhibition impairs expression but only weakly affects phosphorylation of ERK1/2 mitogen-activated protein kinases in ovarian carcinoma cells. Cycloheximide-mediated blockade of protein translation reveals that C75- or FASN siRNA-induced shutdown of FASN accelerates decomposition of signaling proteins. This effect is caused by C75- or FASN siRNA-dependent stimulation of ubiquitination followed by lysosomal-autophagosomal proteolysis. In contrast, PI3K inhibitor LY294002 blocks phosphorylation but does not reduce expression/stability of PI3K effectors. Forced expression of hyperactive (HA) AKT1, unlike HA-MEK1, impairs the growth-inhibitory action of C75. We provide first evidence that the anticancer action of FASN inhibitors is at least partially mediated by drug-dependent proteolysis of PI3K effectors. FASN is a promising cancer target, whose inhibition not only abrogates lipogenesis, which is indispensable for cancer growth, but also downregulates oncogenic PI3K signaling.
Epidermal growth factor receptors (ErbB1-4) are oncogenic receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) that regulate diverse cellular processes. In this study, we combine measurement and mathematical modeling to quantify phospho-turnover at ErbB receptors in human cells and to determine the consequences for signaling and drug binding. We find that phosphotyrosine residues on ErbB1 have half-lives of a few seconds and therefore turn over 100-1000 times in the course of a typical immediate-early response to ligand. Rapid phospho-turnover is also observed for EGF-activated ErbB2 and ErbB3, unrelated RTKs, and multiple intracellular adaptor proteins and signaling kinases. Thus, the complexes formed on the cytoplasmic tail of active receptors and the downstream signaling kinases they control are highly dynamic and antagonized by potent phosphatases. We develop a kinetic scheme for binding of anti-ErbB1 drugs to receptors and show that rapid phospho-turnover significantly impacts their mechanisms of action.
We selected 5 oncogenes with well-established roles in carcinogenesis -- CCND1, ErbB1, ErbB2, c-myc and ZNF217 -- to investigate the coexistence of their copy imbalances in relation to the clinico-pathological characteristics of ovarian tumors.
Fluorescence in situ hybridization for the 5 genes was applied to a preexisting tissue microarray. 38 ovarian tumors were successfully analyzed for copy number changes of the 5 genes.
At least one of these oncogenes was gained/amplified in 27 out of 38 tumors (71.1%). We report the highest frequency of c-myc genetic gain/amplification since it affected 42.1% of the ovarian tumors. We observed sequential involvement of copy number alterations of the other genes in the presence of c-myc disruption. The incidence of copy number changes of the 5 oncogenes -- both single and combinatorial -- was higher in high-grade tumors. All double aberrations in the serous group comprised c-myc and ZNF217copy number increases.
Our results revealed a combination between copy number increases of c-myc and ZNF217, associated with serous histology. The data from this combined analysis of the 5 oncogenes could be used as a basis in considering the combined approach in molecular-based therapy of ovarian cancer.
This review article describes the pathways and mechanisms of endocytosis and post-endocytic sorting of the EGF receptor (EGFR/ErbB1) and other members of the ErbB family. Growth factor binding to EGFR accelerates its internalization through clathrin-coated pits which is followed by the efficient lysosomal targeting of internalized receptors and results in receptor down-regulation. The role of EGFR interaction with the Grb2 adaptor protein and Cbl ubiquitin ligase, and receptor ubiquitination in the clathrin-dependent internalization and sorting of EGFR in multivesicular endosomes is discussed. Activation and phosphorylation of ErbB2, ErbB3 and ErbB4 also results in their ubiquitination. However, these ErbBs are internalized and targeted to lysosomes less efficiently than EGFR. When overexpressed endocytosis-impaired ErbBs may inhibit the internalization and degradation of EGFR.

The association of receptor tyrosine kinases is a key step in the initiation of growth factor-mediated signaling. Although the ligand-induced dimerization of inactive, monomeric receptors was the central dogma of receptor tyrosine kinase activation for decades, the existence of larger oligomers is now accepted. Both homoassociations and heteroassociations are of extreme importance in the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor family, leading to diverse and robust signaling. We present a statistically reliable, flow-cytometric homo-fluorescence resonance energy transfer method for the quantitative characterization of large-scale receptor clusters. We assumed that a fraction of a certain protein species is monomeric, whereas the rest are present in homoclusters of N-mers. We measured fluorescence anisotropy as a function of the saturation of fluorescent antibody binding, and fitted the model to the anisotropy data yielding the fraction of monomers and the cluster size. We found that ErbB2 formed larger homoclusters than ErbB1. Stimulation with EGF and heregulin led to a decrease in ErbB2 homocluster size, whereas ErbB1 homoclusters became larger after EGF stimulation. The activation level of ErbB2 was inversely proportional to its homocluster size. We conclude that homoclusters of ErbB1 and ErbB2 behave in a fundamentally different way. Whereas huge ErbB2 clusters serve as a reservoir of inactive coreceptors and dissociate upon stimulation, small ErbB1 homoclusters form higher-order oligomers after ligand binding.
Members of the epidermal growth factor receptor family (EGFR/ERBB1, ERBB2/HER2, ERBB3/HER3 and ERBB4/HER4) are key targets for inhibition in cancer therapy. Critical for activation is the formation of an asymmetric dimer by the intracellular kinase domains, in which the carboxy-terminal lobe (C lobe) of one kinase domain induces an active conformation in the other. The cytoplasmic protein MIG6 (mitogen-induced gene 6; also known as ERRFI1) interacts with and inhibits the kinase domains of EGFR and ERBB2 (refs 3-5). Crystal structures of complexes between the EGFR kinase domain and a fragment of MIG6 show that a approximately 25-residue epitope (segment 1) from MIG6 binds to the distal surface of the C lobe of the kinase domain. Biochemical and cell-based analyses confirm that this interaction contributes to EGFR inhibition by blocking the formation of the activating dimer interface. A longer MIG6 peptide that is extended C terminal to segment 1 has increased potency as an inhibitor of the activated EGFR kinase domain, while retaining a critical dependence on segment 1. We show that signalling by EGFR molecules that contain constitutively active kinase domains still requires formation of the asymmetric dimer, underscoring the importance of dimer interface blockage in MIG6-mediated inhibition.
Early-trimester human fetal pancreas is a promising potential source of pancreatic progenitor cells. However, the ethical controversy associated with the source of these cells, and technical difficulties associated with their differentiation into insulin-producing cells have limited both their availability and utility. This study aimed to characterize a population of pancreatic progenitor cells (PPCs) isolated from human fetus and describe the effects of a novel factor, PDZ-domain containing-2 (PDZD2), and its secreted form (sPDZD2), on PPC proliferation and differentiation. In particular, we examined and characterized the expression of several stem cell (nestin, ABCG2, c-kit), growth and differentiation markers (GLP-1R, c-met, erbB1), and PDZD2 in PPCs by RT-PCR, Western blot, and immunocytochemistry. We also examined the effects of sPDZD2 on PPC proliferation and differentiation by examining BrdU incorporation, MTT, cell number, and real-time PCR as well as ELISA. PPCs were isolated, cultured and characterized from human fetal pancreas. PDZD2 and sPDZD2 were detected at high levels in both human fetal pancreas and in PPCs. sPDZD2 acted as a potent mitogen on PPCs, and inhibited the differentiation of PPC-derived islet-like cell-clusters (ICCs), evidenced by the downregulation of Isl-1, Pdx-1, and insulin mRNA levels. sPDZD2 treatment also reduced levels of C-peptide in ICCs. These results show that a novel pancreatic developmental factor, PDZD2, is sufficient to promote the proliferation of human fetal PPCs while limiting differentiation of ICCs into islet/endocrine cells. Findings from this study will contribute to the development of improved methods for islet transplantation therapy in the treatment of diabetes.
Expression of ErbB4 receptor is correlated with the incidence of non-metastatic types of human cancers, whereas the overexpression of other ErbB receptor families (ErbB1/EGFR, ErbB2 and ErbB3) is correlated to the formation of metastatic tumors. However, the molecular mechanism underlying this phenomenon has been unclear. Earlier, we demonstrated that okadaic acid (OA), an inhibitor of a serine/threonine phosphatase PP2A, stimulated the growth hormone-induced ERK phosphorylation in the wild type Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells and the cells expressing ErbB1 receptor, but suppressed ERK activation in CHO cells that express ErbB4 receptor. PP2A had been understood as a negative regulator of the growth hormone-stimulated signal transduction pathways, however, this observation suggested that expression of ErbB4 receptor reversed the regulation of PP2A in the ErbB4 signalling pathway. In this study, we found that OA suppressed phosphorylation of Shc at Tyr317, therefore it down-regulated ERK phosphorylation in the ErbB4 expressing CHO cells. Accordingly, basal PP2A contributed to the phosphorylation of Shc Tyr317 in ErbB4 expressing CHO cells, nevertheless it had been reported that PP2A negatively regulates Shc tyrosine phosphorylation in the EGF- or IGF-I-induced signalling pathways. By testing OA for human cancer cell lines that express different types of ErbB receptors, we found that ErbB4 receptor expression was accompanied with positive regulation of PP2A for phosphorylation of Shc Tyr317 and its downstream ERK phosphorylation in MCF-7 and SK-OV-3 cell lines, but not in LNCaP and PC-3 cells. Thus, PP2A regulates the ERK activity in a cell-specific manner, and it is speculated that distinct regulation of PP2A in the ErbB4 receptor signalling pathway may cause a difference in progression of cancer phenotypes.
Scaffolding proteins containing postsynaptic density-95/discs large/zone occludens-1 (PDZ) domains interact with synaptic receptors and cytoskeletal components and are therefore implicated in synaptic development and plasticity. Little is known, however, about what regulates the expression of PDZ proteins and how the levels of these proteins influence synaptic development. Here, we show that ligands for epidermal growth factor receptors (ErbB1) decrease a particular set of PDZ proteins and negatively influence synaptic formation or maturation. In short-term neocortical cultures, concentrations of epidermal growth factor and amphiregulin (2-9 pM) decreased the expression of glutamate receptor interacting protein 1 (GRIP1) and synapse-associated protein 97 kDa (SAP97) without affecting postsynaptic density-95 (PSD-95) levels and glial proliferation. In long-term cultures, epidermal growth factor treatment resulted in a decrease in the frequency of pan-PDZ-immunoreactive aggregates on dendritic processes. A similar activity on the same PDZ proteins was observed in the developing neocortex following epidermal growth factor administration to rat neonates. Immunoblotting revealed that administered epidermal growth factor from the periphery activated brain ErbB1 receptors and decreased GRIP1 and SAP97 protein levels in the neocortex. Laser-confocal imaging indicated that epidermal growth factor administration suppressed the formation of pan-PDZ-immunoreactive puncta and dispersed those structures in vivo as well. These findings revealed a novel negative activity of ErbB1 receptor ligands that attenuates the expression of the PDZ proteins and inhibits postsynaptic maturation in developing neocortex.
To determine the downstream signaling pathways regulated by betacellulin (BTC) in comparison with epidermal growth factor (EGF), we used Chinese hamster ovary cells overexpressing the human EGF receptor (ErbB1/EGFR). The overall time-dependent activation of EGFR autophosphorylation was identical in cells treated with 1 nm BTC or 1.5 nm EGF. Analysis of site-specific EGFR phosphorylation demonstrated that the BTC and EGF tyrosine phosphorylation of Y1086 was not significantly different. In contrast, the autophosphorylation of Y1173 was markedly reduced in BTC-stimulated cells, compared with EGF stimulation that directly correlated with a reduced BTC stimulation of Shc tyrosine phosphorylation, Ras, and Raf-1 activation. On the other hand, Y1068 phosphorylation was significantly increased after BTC stimulation, compared with EGF in parallel with a greater extent of Erk phosphorylation. Expression of a dominant interfering MEK kinase 1 (MEKK1) and Y1068F EGFR more efficiently blocked the enhanced Erk activation by BTC, compared with EGF. Interestingly BTC had a greater inhibitory effect on apoptosis, compared with EGF, and expression of Y1068F EGFR abolished this enhanced inhibitory effect. Together, these data indicated that although BTC and EGF share overlapping signaling properties, the ability of BTC to enhance Erk activation occurs independent of Ras. The increased BTC activation results from a greater extent of Y1068 EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation and subsequent increased recruitment of the Grb2-MEKK1 complex to the plasma membrane, compared with EGF stimulation. The increased Erk activation by BTC associated with antiapoptotic function.
Cellular transformation occurs only in cells that express both ErbB1 and ErbB4 receptors, but not in cells expressing only one or the other of these receptors. However, when both receptors are coexpressed and ligand-stimulated, they interact with virtually the same adaptor/effector proteins as when expressed singly. To reveal the underlying regulatory mechanism of the kinase/phosphatase network in ErbB homo- and heterodimer receptor signaling, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and Akt activities were evaluated in the presence of several enzyme inhibitors in ligand-induced cells expressing ErbB1 (E1), ErbB4 (E4), and ErbB1/ErbB4 (E1/4) receptor. The PP2A inhibitor okadaic acid showed receptor-specific inhibitory profiles for ERK and Akt activities. Moreover, B-Raf isolated only from E1/4 cells could induce in vitro phosphorylation for MEK; this B-Raf kinase activity was abolished by pretreatment of the cells with okadaic acid. Our study further showed that the E1/4 cell-specific B-Raf activity was stimulated by PLC gamma and subsequent Rap1 activation. The present study suggests that B-Raf kinase, which was specifically activated in the cells coexpressing ErbB1 and ErbB4 receptors, elevates total ERK activity within the cell and, therefore, can induce cellular transformation.
Due to heterodimerization and a variety of stimulating ligands, the ErbB receptor system is both diverse and flexible, which proves particularly advantageous to the aberrant signaling of cancer cells. However, specific mechanisms of how a particular receptor contributes to generating the flexibility that leads to aberrant growth regulation have not been well described. We compared the utilization of ErbB2 in response to epidermal growth factor (EGF) and heregulin stimulation in colon carcinoma cells. Anti-ErbB2 monoclonal antibody 2C4 blocked heregulin-stimulated phosphorylation of ErbB2 and ErbB3; activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase (PI3K), and Akt; proliferation; and anchorage-independent growth. 2C4 blocked EGF-mediated phosphorylation of ErbB2 and inhibited PI3K/Akt and anchorage-independent growth but did not affect ErbB1 or MAPK. Immunoprecipitations showed that ErbB3 and Grb2-associated binder (Gab) 1 were phosphorylated and associated with PI3K activity after heregulin treatment and that Gab1 and Gab2, but not ErbB3, were phosphorylated and associated with PI3K activity after EGF treatment. These data show that monoclonal antibody 2C4 inhibited all aspects of heregulin signaling as well as anchorage-independent and monolayer growth. Furthermore, we identify ErbB2 as a critical component of EGF signaling to the Gab1/Gab2-PI3K-Akt pathway and anchorage-independent growth, but EGF stimulation of MAPK and monolayer growth can occur efficiently without the contribution of ErbB2.
Activation of the EGF receptors EGFR (ErbB1) and HER2 (ErbB2) drives the progression of multiple cancer types through complex mechanisms that are still not fully understood. In this study, we report that HER2 expression is elevated in bone metastases of prostate cancer independently of gene amplification. An examination of HER2 and NF-κB receptor (RANK) coexpression revealed increased levels of both proteins in aggressive prostate tumors and metastatic deposits. Inhibiting HER2 expression in bone tumor xenografts reduced proliferation and RANK expression while maintaining EGFR expression. In examining the role of EGFR in tumor-initiating cells (TIC), we found that EGFR expression was required for primary and secondary sphere formation of prostate cancer cells. EGFR expression was also observed in circulating tumor cells (CTC) during prostate cancer metastasis. Dual inhibition of HER2 and EGFR resulted in significant inhibition of tumor xenograft growth, further supporting the significance of these receptors in prostate cancer progression. Overall, our results indicate that EGFR promotes survival of prostate TIC and CTC that metastasize to bone, whereas HER2 supports the growth of prostate cancer cells once they are established at metastatic sites.

Myocardial stretch increases force biphasically: the Frank-Starling mechanism followed by the slow force response (SFR). Based on pharmacological strategies, we proposed that epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor (EGFR or ErbB1) activation is crucial for SFR development. Pharmacological inhibitors could block ErbB4, a member of the ErbB family present in the adult heart. We aimed to specifically test the role of EGFR activation after stretch, with an interference RNA incorporated into a lentiviral vector (small hairpin RNA [shRNA]-EGFR).
Silencing capability of p-shEGFR was assessed in EGFR-GFP transiently transfected HEK293T cells. Four weeks after lentivirus injection into the left ventricular wall of Wistar rats, shRNA-EGFR-injected hearts showed ≈60% reduction of EGFR protein expression compared with shRNA-SCR-injected hearts. ErbB2 and ErbB4 expression did not change. The SFR to stretch evaluated in isolated papillary muscles was ≈130% of initial rapid phase in the shRNA-SCR group, while it was blunted in shRNA-EGFR-expressing muscles. Angiotensin II (Ang II)-dependent Na+/H+ exchanger 1 activation was indirectly evaluated by intracellular pH measurements in bicarbonate-free medium, demonstrating an increase in shRNA-SCR-injected myocardium, an effect not observed in the silenced group. Ang II- or EGF-triggered reactive oxygen species production was significantly reduced in shRNA-EGFR-injected hearts compared with that in the shRNA-SCR group. Chronic lentivirus treatment affected neither the myocardial basal redox state (thiobarbituric acid reactive substances) nor NADPH oxidase activity or expression. Finally, Ang II or EGF triggered a redox-sensitive pathway, leading to p90RSK activation in shRNA-SCR-injected myocardium, an effect that was absent in the shRNA-EGFR group.
Our results provide evidence that specific EGFR activation after myocardial stretch is a key factor in promoting the redox-sensitive kinase activation pathway, leading to SFR development.
To identify molecular prognostic factors and potentially actionable mutations in ampulla of Vater cancer (AVC).
The largely variable outcomes of AVCs make clinical decisions difficult regarding the need of postsurgical therapy, which is based on morphological and immunohistochemical classification that do not adequately consider the varying degrees of heterogeneity present in many AVCs. No approved targeted therapies for AVC exist, but some show promising results requiring better molecular characterization to identify potential responders.
We assessed 80 AVCs for the prognostic value of mutations of kirsten rat sarcoma (KRAS), neuroblastoma RAS (NRAS), B rapidly accelerated fibrosarcoma (BRAF), TP53, and 4 membrane erythroblastosis oncogene B (ERBB) receptor tyrosine kinases (EGFR-ERBB1, HER2-ERBB2, HER3-ERBB3, HER4-ERBB4) amenable to pharmacological inhibition. Moreover, we evaluated mutations in 16 key components of rat sarcoma (RAS), phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase (PI3K), protein 53 (P53), transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β), and wingless/integrated (WNT) pathways, recently associated to AVC by whole-exome sequencing.
TP53 and KRAS were mutated in 41% and 35% of cases, respectively, and emerged as independent prognostic factors together with tumor stage and regardless of the histotype (TP53: P = 0.0006; KRAS: P = 0.0018; stage IIB: P = 0.0117; stage III-IV: P = 0.0020). ERBB, WNT and PI3K pathway genes were mutated in 37.5% of cases.
KRAS and TP53 mutations are negative predictors of survival in AVCs, regardless of histotype. Potentially actionable mutations in ERBB, WNT, and PI3K signaling pathway genes are present in 37.5% of all cases. These might be amenable to target therapy using available drugs like Everolimus in PI3K-mutated cases or compounds under active screening against ERBB and WNT signaling.
Background. No predictive or prognostic biomarker is available for patients with locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC) undergoing perioperative chemoradiotherapy (CRT). Members of the human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER) family of receptor tyrosine kinases EGFR (HER1, ERBB1), HER2 (ERBB2), HER3 (ERBB3), and HER4 (ERBB4) are therapeutic targets in several cancers. The analysis was performed to assess expression levels and study the potential prognostic impact for disease-free and overall survival in patients with LARC. Patients and Methods. ERBB1-4 mRNA expression and tumor proliferation using Ki-67 (MKI67) mRNA were evaluated using RT-quantitative PCR in paraffin-embedded tumor samples from 86 patients (median age: 63) treated with capecitabine or 5-fluorouracil-based CRT within a phase 3 clinical trial. Results. A positive correlation of HER4 and HER2, HER3 and HER2, and HER4 and HER3 with each other was observed. Patients with high mRNA expression of ERBB1 (EGFR, HER1) had significantly increased risk for recurrence and death. Patients with high mRNA expression of MKI67 had reduced risk for relapse. Conclusion. This analysis suggests a prognostic impact of both ERBB1 and MKi67 mRNA expression in LARC patients treated with capecitabine or fluorouracil-based chemoradiotherapy.
ErbB family members, ErbB1/EGFR/HER-1, ErbB2/HER-2, ErbB3/HER-3 and ErbB4/HER-4, have been implicated in breast cancer (BC) tumorigenicity. Recently, crucial roles for RANK/RANKL signaling in addition to key downstream factor NF-κB have been demonstrated in mammary tumorigenesis. Here, we present the hypothesis of a novel association between ErbB and RANK pathways in promoting BC. The proposed model alludes to the cross-talk that might occur between RANK and ErbB receptors. This interplay might regulate RANK signaling and consequently, modulate carcinogenesis, mainly in ErbB2 over-expressing BC cells. Thus, we highlight the significance of the RANK/RANKL axis as a putative therapeutic target in this malignancy, and furthermore, suggest that the combination of ErbB and RANK/RANKL inhibitors may have therapeutic benefit for certain BC patients.
Prolactin receptor (PRLR) and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR/ERBB1) have important roles in the physiology of the human breast and in the etiology and progression of breast cancer. Our present studies in MCF-7 cells revealed that EGF induces up-regulation of PRLR via activation of EGFR signalling pathways leading to activation of estrogen receptor α (ERα). EGF treatment of MCF-7 cells cultured in absence of estradiol induced expression of PRLR that was consistent with the activation of PRLR generic promoter (hPIII). These were abolished by ERα antagonist and siRNA, indicating involvement of ERα in EGF-induced hPIII promoter activity. MEK/MAPK and PI3K/AKT pathways participate in the phosphorylation of ERα induced by EGF/EGFR. PI3K and MEK inhibitors abolished EGF-induced PRLR promoter activity. Increased recruitment of non-DNA bound unliganded ERα to Sp1 and C/EBPβ bound to their sites at hPIII induced by EGF was abrogated by ERα siRNA demonstrating the requisite role of phospho-ERα in PRLR upregulation. EGF/EGFR, independent of endogenous prolactin induced phosphorylation of STAT5b with participation of c-SRC and recruitment of STAT5b:STAT5b to a GAS site at hPIII. STAT5b interaction with ERα was essential for stable phospho-ERα recruitment to the SP1/CEBPβ complex. These studies indicate a role for paracrine EGF via EGFR independent of estrogen and prolactin in the transcriptional activation of PRLR gene expression and its contribution to high levels of PRLRs in breast cancer. These by maximizing the actions of endogenous prolactin could have a role in cancer progression and resistance to endocrine therapy.
Overexpression of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) family is common in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). Therefore, we analyzed the expression profiles of the four EGFR family members (ErbB1, ErbB2, ErbB3, and ErbB4) in OSCC of Japanese patients.
Sixty-eight primary tumors and 18 normal oral mucosal tissue specimens were evaluated in this study. We analyzed EGFR family members using quantitative polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry, as well as their relationships with clinical factors.
The expression level of ErbB1 messenger RNA (mRNA) was markedly increased in OSCC. By comparing the gene expression levels of EGFR family members in OSCC tissues that had lymph node metastasis with those in the absence of lymph node metastasis, we found that ErbB4 mRNA expression was increased significantly. There was also a significant correlation between the mRNA expression level of ErbB4 and those of ErbB2 and ErbB3 in cases with lymph node metastasis. Moreover, we confirmed protein expression of ErbB4 in the cytoplasm and membrane of tumor cells, which was stronger in cases with lymph node metastasis.
ErbB4 is an independent marker for lymph node metastasis in OSCC.
Afatinib, together with gefitinib and erlotinib, is approved for first-line treatment of advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with activating mutations of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). This is an irreversible inhibitor of the ErbB family, acting on EGFR (HER1, ErbB1), ErbB2 (HER2) and ErbB4 (HER4). Covalent attachment to cysteine residues in the catalytic domain of EGFR, HER2 and ErbB4 inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity (TKIs) of these receptors, decreasing auto- and transphosphorylation between ErbB dimers, and thus blocking the activity of downstream signalling pathways related to growth and apoptosis suppression. In preclinical models, this has resulted in a reduction in tumour size. Furthermore, due to its mechanism of action, afatinib may be more potent than the first-generation EGFR TKIs (gefitinib and erlotinib) and may even be able to overcome acquired resistance to such treatments. Finally, because of the demonstrated synergism with other chemotherapeutic and target agents, it could be interesting to enhance its clinical development in combination with other drugs.
Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) expression is upregulated in many tumors and its aberrant signaling drives progression of many cancer types. Consequently, EGFR has become a clinically validated target as extracellular tumor marker for antibodies as well as for tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Within the last years, new mechanistic insights were uncovered and, based on clinical experience as well as progress in protein engineering, novel bio-therapeutic approaches were developed and tested.
The potential therapeutic targeting arsenal in the fight against cancer now encompasses bispecific or biparatopic antibodies, DARPins, Adnectins, Affibodies, peptides and combinations of these binding molecules with viral- and nano-particles. We review past and recent binding proteins from the literature and include a brief description of the various targeting approaches. Special attention is given to the binding modes with the EGFR. Expert commentary: Clinical data from the three approved anti EGFR antibodies indicate that there is room for improved therapeutic efficacy. Having choices in size, affinity, avidity and the mode of EGFR binding as well as the possibility to combine various effector functions opens the possibility to rationally design more effective therapeutics.
Mechanisms determining intrinsic differentiation bias inherent to human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) toward cardiogenic fate remain elusive. We evaluated the interplay between ErbB4 and Epidemal growth factor receptor (EGFR or ErbB1) in determining cardiac differentiation in vitro as these receptor tyrosine kinases are key to heart and brain development in vivo. Our results demonstrate that during cardiac differentiation, cell fate biases exist in hPSCs due to cardiac/neuroectoderm divergence post cardiac mesoderm stage. Stage-specific up-regulation of EGFR in concert with persistent Wnt3a signaling post cardiac mesoderm favors commitment toward neural progenitor cells (NPCs). Inhibition of EGFR abrogates these effects with enhanced (&gt;twofold) cardiac differentiation efficiencies by increasing proliferation of Nkx2-5 expressing cardiac progenitors while reducing proliferation of Sox2 expressing NPCs. Forced overexpression of ErbB4 rescued cardiac commitment by augmenting Wnt11 signaling. Convergence between EGFR/ErbB4 and canonical/noncanonical Wnt signaling determines cardiogenic fate in hPSCs. Stem Cells 2016;34:2461-2470.
In utero maternal immune activation (MIA) and cannabinoid exposure during adolescence constitute environmental risk factors for schizophrenia. We investigated these risk factors alone and in combination ("two-hit") on epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and neuregulin-1 receptor (ErbB4) levels in the rat brain. EGFR but not ErbB4 receptor protein levels were significantly increased in the nucleus accumbens and striatum of "two-hit" rats only, with no changes seen at the mRNA level. These findings support region specific EGF-system dysregulation as a plausible mechanism in this animal model of schizophrenia pathogenesis.
Heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor (HB-EGF) is a member of the EGF family of growth factors that bind to and activate the EGF receptor (EGFR/ErbB1) and ErbB4. HB-EGF plays pivotal roles in pathophysiological processes, including cancer. Thus, monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) for HB-EGF detection could be an important tool in the therapeutic diagnosis of HB-EGF-related cancers and other diseases. However, few mAbs, especially those applicable for immunohistochemistry (IHC), have been established to date. In this study, we generated a clone of hybridoma-derived mAb 2-108 by immunizing mice with recombinant human HB-EGF protein expressed by human cells. The mAb 2-108 specifically bound to human HB-EGF but not to mouse HB-EGF and was successful in immunoblotting, even under reducing conditions, immunoprecipitation, and immunofluorescence for unfixed as well as paraformaldehyde-fixed cells. Notably, this mAb was effective in IHC of paraffin-embedded tumor specimens. Epitope mapping analysis showed that mAb 2-108 recognized the N-terminal prodomain in HB-EGF. These results indicate that this new anti-HB-EGF mAb 2-108 would be useful in the diagnosis of HB-EGF-related cancers and would be a strong tool in both basic and clinical research on HB-EGF.
Specific gene expressions of host cells by spontaneous STAT6 phosphorylation are major strategy for the survival of intracellular Toxoplasma gondii against parasiticidal events through STAT1 phosphorylation by infection provoked IFN-γ. We determined the effects of small molecules of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) on the growth of T. gondii and on the relationship with STAT1 and STAT6 phosphorylation in ARPE-19 cells. We counted the number of T. gondii RH tachyzoites per parasitophorous vacuolar membrane (PVM) after treatment with TKIs at 12-hr intervals for 72 hr. The change of STAT6 phosphorylation was assessed via western blot and immunofluorescence assay. Among the tested TKIs, Afatinib (pan ErbB/EGFR inhibitor, 5 µM) inhibited 98.0% of the growth of T. gondii, which was comparable to pyrimethamine (5 µM) at 96.9% and followed by Erlotinib (ErbB1/EGFR inhibitor, 20 µM) at 33.8% and Sunitinib (PDGFR or c-Kit inhibitor, 10 µM) at 21.3%. In the early stage of the infection (2, 4, and 8 hr after T. gondii challenge), Afatinib inhibited the phosphorylation of STAT6 in western blot and immunofluorescence assay. Both JAK1 and JAK3, the upper hierarchical kinases of cytokine signaling, were strongly phosphorylated at 2 hr and then disappeared entirely after 4 hr. Some TKIs, especially the EGFR inhibitors, might play an important role in the inhibition of intracellular replication of T. gondii through the inhibition of the direct phosphorylation of STAT6 by T. gondii.
The use of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) for cancer therapy is one of the most important strategies for current cancer treatment. The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) family of receptor tyrosine kinases, which regulates cancer cell proliferation, survival, and migration, is a major molecular target for antibody-based therapy. ErbB4/HER4, which contains a ligand-binding extracellular region, is activated by several ligands, including neuregulins (NRGs), heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor, betacellulin and epiregulin. Although there are clinically approved antibodies for ErbB1 and ErbB2, there are no available therapeutic mAbs for ErbB4, and it is not known whether ErbB4 is a useful target for antibody-based cancer therapy. In this study, we developed an anti-ErbB4 mAb (clone P6-1) that suppresses NRG-dependent activation of ErbB4 and examined its effect on breast cancer cell proliferation in the extracellular matrix.
Growth factors mediate their diverse biologic responses (regulation of cellular proliferation, differentiation, migration and survival) by binding to and activating cell-surface receptors with intrinsic protein kinase activity named receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs). About 60 RTKs have been identified and can be classified into more than 16 different receptor families. Their activity is normally tightly controlled and regulated. Overexpression of RTK proteins or functional alterations caused by mutations in the corresponding genes or abnormal stimulation by autocrine growth factor loops contribute to constitutive RTK signaling, resulting in alterations in the physiological activities of cells. The ErbB receptor family of RTKs comprises four distinct receptors: the EGFR (also known as ErbB1/HER1), ErbB2 (neu, HER2), ErbB3 (HER3) and ErbB4 (HER4). ErbB family members are often overexpressed, amplified, or mutated in many forms of cancer, making them important therapeutic targets. EGFR has been found to be amplified in gliomas and non-small-cell lung carcinoma while ErbB2 amplifications are seen in breast, ovarian, bladder, non-small-cell lung carcinoma, as well as several other tumor types. Several data have shown that ErbB receptor family and its downstream pathway regulate epithelial-mesenchymal transition, migration, and tumor invasion by modulating extracellular matrix (ECM) components. Recent findings indicate that ECM components such as matrikines bind specifically to EGF receptor and promote cell invasion. In this review, we will present an in-depth overview of the structure, mechanisms, cell signaling, and functions of ErbB family receptors in cell adhesion and migration. Furthermore, we will describe in a last part the new strategies developed in anti-cancer therapy to inhibit ErbB family receptor activation.
1. The aim of the present study is to describe, immunohistochemically, the expression and cell type localisation of growth factor receptors and some of their ligands in the oropharyngeal organs of the Chukar partridge. 2. The tissue samples from 10 healthy adult partridges were dissected under ether anaesthesia and then embedded in paraffin following routine histological procedures. The immunoreaction for receptors and ligands of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)/ligand system was localised in the cell membrane, nucleus and cytoplasm of the luminal and glandular epithelial cells, stromal and striated muscle cells, and vascular endothelial and smooth muscle cells. 3. Variations were observed in the avian oropharyngeal organs. The immunostaining for the erbB1/HER1 (human epidermal growth factor receptor 1) and the EGF (epidermal growth factor) and AREG (Amphiregulin) ligands in the luminal epithelial cells was higher than in the glandular epithelial, stromal and striated muscle cells. However, the immunostaining for erbB3/HER3 (human epidermal growth factor receptor 3) and erbB4/HER4 (human epidermal growth factor receptor 4) were similar in the luminal epithelium, stromal and striated muscle cells. 4. Growth factor receptors and some of their ligands were localised in different cell types in the oropharyngeal organs. We suggest that erbB/HERs (human epidermal growth factor receptors) and their ligands play an important role in proliferation, differentiation, growth, survival and migration of the cells.
In the mammary gland, genetic circuits controlled by estrogen, progesterone, and prolactin, act in concert with pathways regulated by members of the epidermal growth factor family to orchestrate growth and morphogenesis during puberty, pregnancy and lactation. However, the precise mechanisms underlying the crosstalk between the hormonal and growth factor pathways remain poorly understood. We have identified the CUB and zona pellucida-like domain-containing protein 1 (CUZD1), expressed in mammary ductal and alveolar epithelium, as a novel mediator of mammary gland proliferation and differentiation during pregnancy and lactation. Cuzd1-null mice exhibited a striking impairment in mammary ductal branching and alveolar development during pregnancy, resulting in a subsequent defect in lactation. Gene expression profiling of mammary epithelium revealed that CUZD1 regulates the expression of a subset of the EGF family growth factors, epiregulin, neuregulin-1, and epigen, which act in an autocrine fashion to activate ErbB1 and ErbB4 receptors. Proteomic studies further revealed that CUZD1 interacts with a complex containing JAK1/JAK2 and STAT5, downstream transducers of prolactin signaling in the mammary gland. In the absence of CUZD1, STAT5 phosphorylation in the mammary epithelium during alveologenesis was abolished. Conversely, elevated expression of Cuzd1 in mammary epithelial cells stimulated prolactin-induced phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of STAT5. Chromatin immunoprecipitation confirmed co-occupancy of phosphorylated STAT5 and CUZD1 in the regulatory regions of epiregulin, a potential regulator of epithelial proliferation, and whey acidic protein, a marker of epithelial differentiation. Collectively, these findings suggest that CUZD1 plays a critical role in prolactin-induced JAK/STAT5 signaling that controls the expression of key STAT5 target genes involved in mammary epithelial proliferation and differentiation during alveolar development.
Although activation of the ErbB family of receptor tyrosine kinases (ErbB1-4) is driven by oligomerization mediated by intermolecular interactions between the extracellular, the kinase and the transmembrane domains, the transmembrane domain has been largely neglected in this regard. The largest contributor to the intramembrane electric field, the dipole potential, alters the conformation of transmembrane peptides, but its effect on ErbB proteins is unknown. Here, we show by Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) and number and brightness (N&amp;B) experiments that the epidermal growth factor (EGF)-induced increase in the homoassociation of ErbB1 and ErbB2 and their heteroassociation are augmented by increasing the dipole potential. These effects were even more pronounced for ErbB2 harboring an activating Val → Glu mutation in the transmembrane domain (NeuT). The signaling capacity of ErbB1 and ErbB2 was also correlated with the dipole potential. Since the dipole potential decreased the affinity of EGF to ErbB1, the augmented growth factor-induced effects at an elevated dipole potential were actually induced at lower receptor occupancy. We conclude that the dipole potential plays a permissive role in the clustering of ErbB receptors and that the effects of lipid rafts on ligand binding and receptor signaling can be partially attributed to the dipole potential.
Structure-activity relationships for inhibition of erbB1, erbB2, and erbB4 were determined for a series of quinazoline- and pyrido[3,4-d]pyrimidine-based analogues of the irreversible pan-erbB inhibitor, canertinib. Cyclic amine bearing crotonamides were determined to provide rapid inhibition of cellular erbB1 autophosphorylation and good metabolic stability in liver microsome and hepatocyte assays. The influence of 4-anilino substitution on pan-erbB inhibitory potency was investigated. Several anilines were identified as providing potent, reversible pan-erbB inhibition. Optimum 4- and 6-substituents with known 7-substituents provided preferred irreversible inhibitors for pharmacodynamic testing in vivo. Quinazoline 54 and pyrido[3,4-d]pyrimidine 71 were identified as clearly superior to canertinib. Both compounds possess a piperidinyl crotonamide Michael acceptor and a 3-chloro-4-fluoroaniline, indicating these as optimized 6- and 4-substituents, respectively. Pharmacokinetic comparison of compounds 54 and 71 across three species selected compound 54 as the preferred candidate. Compound 54 (PF-00299804) has been assigned the nomenclature of dacomitinib and is currently under clinical evaluation.
The hedgehog family includes Sonic hedgehog (Shh), Desert hedgehog, and Indian hedgehog, which are well known as a morphogens that play many important roles during development of numerous organs such as the tongue, pancreas, kidney, cartilage, teeth and salivary glands (SMG). In Shh null mice, abnormal development of the salivary gland is seen after embryonic day 14 (E14). Shh also induced lobule formation and lumen formation in acini-like structures in cultured E14 SMG. In this study, we investigated the relationship between Shh and epidermal growth factor (EGF)/ErbB signaling in developing fetal mouse SMG. Administration of Shh to cultured E13 SMG stimulated branching morphogenesis (BrM) and induced synthesis of mRNAs for EGF ligands and receptors of the ErbB family. Shh also stimulated activation of ErbB signaling system such as ERK1/2. AG1478, a specific inhibitor of ErbB receptors, completely suppressed BrM and activation of EGF/ErbB/ERK1/2 cascade in E13 SMGs cultured with Shh. The expressions of mRNA for Egf in mesenchyme and mRNA for Erbb1, Erbb2 and Erbb3 in epithelium of E13 SMG were specifically induced by administration of Shh. These results show that Shh stimulates BrM of fetal mouse SMG, at least in part, through activation of the EGF/ErbB/ERK1/2 signaling system.
ErbB2 overexpression and/or gene amplification is present in 20% of all breast cancers and characterizes an aggressive form of this disease. Despite the availability of several active drugs that have yielded substantial survival improvements, most patients with ErbB2-positive metastatic disease will develop tumor progression, either because of primary or acquired resistance. Therefore, research has focused on drugs that can more efficiently interfere with ErbB2 and with other members of the epidermal growth factor receptor family.
This review focuses on those investigational drugs that inhibit ErbB2 tyrosine kinase activity (TKIs) for treating breast cancer.
ErbB-targeting TKIs show encouraging activity in patients with ErbB-positive tumors that are resistant to conventional ErbB-therapies (mostly trastuzumab), confirming pre-clinical observations. Efficient interference with the ErbB-network signaling implies also a potential use in ErbB2-normal tumors, where the phenotype is sustained by ErbB-aberrant signaling. Finally, early data suggests that ErbB-targeting TKIs could be active in treating patients with activating ErbB2 mutations. Ongoing and future research efforts should elucidate what is, according to the peculiarities of these compounds, their positioning in the treatment of women with breast cancer.
Evidence-based treatments for metastatic, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive breast cancer in the CNS are limited. Neratinib is an irreversible inhibitor of erbB1, HER2, and erbB4, with promising activity in HER2-positive breast cancer; however, its activity in the CNS is unknown. We evaluated the efficacy of treatment with neratinib in patients with HER2-positive breast cancer brain metastases in a multicenter, phase II open-label trial.
Eligible patients were those with HER2-positive brain metastases (≥ 1 cm in longest dimension) who experienced progression in the CNS after one or more line of CNS-directed therapy, such as whole-brain radiotherapy, stereotactic radiosurgery, and/or surgical resection. Patients received neratinib 240 mg orally once per day, and tumors were assessed every two cycles. The primary endpoint was composite CNS objective response rate (ORR), requiring all of the following: ≥ 50% reduction in volumetric sum of target CNS lesions and no progression of non-target lesions, new lesions, escalating corticosteroids, progressive neurologic signs/symptoms, or non-CNS progression--the threshold for success was five of 40 responders.
Forty patients were enrolled between February 2012 and June 2013; 78% of patients had previous whole-brain radiotherapy. Three women achieved a partial response (CNS objective response rate, 8%; 95% CI, 2% to 22%). The median number of cycles received was two (range, one to seven cycles), with a median progression-free survival of 1.9 months. Five women received six or more cycles. The most common grade ≥ 3 event was diarrhea (occurring in 21% of patients taking prespecified loperamide prophylaxis and 28% of those without prophylaxis). Patients in the study experienced a decreased quality of life over time.
Although neratinib had low activity and did not meet our threshold for success, 12.5% of patients received six or more cycles. Studies combining neratinib with chemotherapy in patients with CNS disease are ongoing.
Cancer progression depends on stepwise accumulation of oncogenic mutations and a select group of growth factors essential for tumor growth, metastasis and angiogenesis. Agents blocking the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR, also called HER1 and ERBB1) and the co-receptor called HER2/ERBB2 have been approved over the last decade as anti-cancer drugs. Because the catalytically defective member of the family, HER3/ERBB3, plays critical roles in emergence of resistance of carcinomas to various drugs, current efforts focus on antibodies and other anti-HER3/ERBB3 agents, which we review herein with an emphasis on drug combinations and some unique biochemical features of HER3/ERBB3.
Recent clinical trials investigating receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) inhibitors showed a limited clinical response in medulloblastoma. The present study investigated the role of micro-environmental growth factors expressed in the brain, such as HGF and EGF, in relation to the effects of hepatocyte growth factor receptor (MET) and epidermal growth factor receptor family (ErbB1-4) inhibition in medulloblastoma cell lines. Medulloblastoma cell lines were treated with tyrosine kinase inhibitors crizotinib or canertinib, targeting MET and ErbB1-4, respectively. Upon treatment, cells were stimulated with VEGF-A, PDGF-AB, HGF, FGF-2 or EGF. Subsequently, we measured cell viability and expression levels of growth factors and downstream signaling proteins. Addition of HGF or EGF phosphorylated MET or EGFR, respectively, and demonstrated phosphorylation of Akt and ERK1/2 as well as increased tumor cell viability. Crizotinib and canertinib both inhibited cell viability and phosphorylation of Akt and ERK1/2. Specifically targeting MET using shRNA's resulted in decreased cell viability. Interestingly, addition of HGF to canertinib significantly enhanced cell viability as well as phosphorylation of Akt and ERK1/2. The HGF-induced bypass of canertinib was reversed by addition of crizotinib. HGF protein was hardly released by medulloblastoma cells itself. Addition of canertinib did not affect RTK cell surface or growth factor expression levels. This manuscript points to the bypassing capacity of exogenous HGF in medulloblastoma cell lines. It might be of great interest to anticipate on these results in developing novel clinical trials with a combination of MET and EGFR inhibitors in medulloblastoma.
The purpose of this study was to determine if zinc homeostasis is affected during ischemia/reperfusion, if so, whether zinc pyrithione limits myocardial cell death and improves hemodynamics when administered as an adjunct to reperfusion and if ErbB receptor tyrosine kinases that are important for the long-term structural integrity of the heart are indispensable for reperfusion salvage.
Isolated perfused rat hearts were subjected to 35min of global ischemia and reperfused for 120min to determine the relative intracellular zinc levels by TSQ staining. The hearts were reperfused in the presence of incremental concentrations of zinc pyrithione for the first 10min during reperfusion. Silencing or blockade of ErbB2 using a monoclonal antibody, ErbB2 kinase inhibition and PI3kinase inhibition was used to study their critical role in zinc pyrithione-induced cardioprotection.
We found that there was a profound decrease in intracellular zinc after ischemia/reperfusion resulting in increased apoptosis, caspase-3 activation, and infarct size. A dose-dependent reduction of infarct size with zinc pyrithione in the range of 5-20μmol/l (optimal protection was seen at 10μmol/l with infarct size of 16±2% vs. I/R vehicle, 33±2%, p&lt;0.01). Increased TUNEL staining and caspase-3 activity observed after ischemia/reperfusion were attenuated by zinc pyrithione administration during the reperfusion. Moreover, this protection was sensitive to silencing and blockade of ErbB2, inhibition of ErbB2 kinase activity or PI3-kinase activity. Western blot analysis revealed that zinc pyrithione resulted in decreased caspase-3 activation, rapid stabilization of ErbB2/ErbB1 heterodimers, and increased activation of PI3K/Akt signaling cascade.
Zinc pyrithione attenuates lethal perfusion-induced injury in a manner that is reliant on ErbB2/PI3K/Akt activity.
Epigenetics of schizophrenia provides important information on how the environmental factors affect the genetic architecture of the disease. DNA methylation plays a pivotal role in etiology for schizophrenia. Previous studies have focused mostly on the discovery of schizophrenia-associated SNPs or genetic variants. As postmortem brain samples became available, more and more recent studies surveyed transcriptomics of the diseases. In this study, we constructed protein-protein interaction (PPI) network using the disease associated SNP (or genetic variants), differentially expressed disease genes and differentially methylated disease genes (or promoters). By combining the different datasets and topological analyses of the PPI network, we established a more comprehensive understanding of the development and genetics of this devastating mental illness.
We analyzed the previously published DNA methylation profiles of prefrontal cortex from 335 healthy controls and 191 schizophrenic patients. These datasets revealed 2014 CpGs identified as GWAS risk loci with the differential methylation profile in schizophrenia, and 1689 schizophrenic differential methylated genes (SDMGs) identified with predominant hypomethylation. These SDMGs, combined with the PPIs of these genes, were constructed into the schizophrenic differential methylation network (SDMN). On the SDMN, there are 10 hypermethylated SDMGs, including GNA13, CAPNS1, GABPB2, GIT2, LEFTY1, NDUFA10, MIOS, MPHOSPH6, PRDM14 and RFWD2. The hypermethylation to differential expression network (HyDEN) were constructed to determine how the hypermethylated promoters regulate gene expression. The enrichment analyses of biochemical pathways in HyDEN, including TNF alpha, PDGFR-beta signaling, TGF beta Receptor, VEGFR1 and VEGFR2 signaling, regulation of telomerase, hepatocyte growth factor receptor signaling, ErbB1 downstream signaling and mTOR signaling pathway, suggested that the malfunctioning of these pathways contribute to the symptoms of schizophrenia.
The epigenetic profiles of DNA differential methylation from schizophrenic brain samples were investigated to understand the regulatory roles of SDMGs. The SDMGs interplays with SCZCGs in a coordinated fashion in the disease mechanism of schizophrenia. The protein complexes and pathways involved in SDMN may be responsible for the etiology and potential treatment targets. The SDMG promoters are predominantly hypomethylated. Increasing methylation on these promoters is proposed as a novel therapeutic approach for schizophrenia.
We have recently demonstrated that multi-kinase inhibitors such as sorafenib and pazopanib can suppress the detection of chaperones by in situ immuno-fluorescence, which is further enhanced by phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitors. Sorafenib and pazopanib inhibited the HSP90 ATPase activity with IC50 values of ~1.0 μM and ~75 nM, respectively. Pazopanib docked in silico with two possible poses into the HSP90 ATP binding pocket. Pazopanib and sildenafil combined to reduce the total protein levels of HSP1H/p105 and c-MYC and to reduce their co-localization. Sorafenib/pazopanib combined with sildenafil in a [GRP78+HSP27] -dependent fashion to: (i) profoundly activate an eIF2α/Beclin1 pathway; (ii) profoundly inactivate mTOR and increase ATG13 phosphorylation, collectively resulting in the formation of toxic autophagosomes. In a fresh PDX isolate of NSCLC combined knock down of [ERBB1+ERBB3] or use of the ERBB1/2/4 inhibitor afatinib altered cell morphology, enhanced ATG13 phosphorylation, inactivated NFκB, and further enhanced [sorafenib/pazopanib + sildenafil] lethality. Identical data to that with afatinib were obtained knocking down PI3K p110α/β or using buparlisib, copanlisib or the specific p110α inhibitor BYL719. Afatinib adapted NSCLC clones were resistant to buparlisib or copanlisib but were more sensitive than control clones to [sorafenib + sildenafil] or [pazopanib + sildenafil]. Lapatinib significantly enhanced the anti-tumor effect of [regorafenib + sildenafil] in vivo; afatinib and BYL719 enhanced the anti-tumor effects of [sorafenib + sildenafil] and [pazopanib] in vivo, respectively.
Human cytomegalovirus encodes at least 25 membrane glycoproteins that are found in the viral envelope(1). While gB represents the fusion protein, two glycoprotein complexes control the tropism of the virus: the gHgLgO trimer is involved in the infection of fibroblasts, and the gHgLpUL128L pentamer is required for infection of endothelial, epithelial and myeloid cells(2-5). Two reports suggested that gB binds to ErbB1 and PDGFRα (refs 6,7); however, these results do not explain the tropism of the virus and were recently challenged(8,9). Here, we provide a 19 Å reconstruction for the gHgLgO trimer and show that it binds with high affinity through the gO subunit to PDGFRα, which is expressed on fibroblasts but not on epithelial cells. We also provide evidence that the trimer is essential for viral entry in both fibroblasts and epithelial cells. Furthermore, we identify the pentamer, which is essential for infection of epithelial cells, as a trigger for the ErbB pathway. These findings help explain the broad tropism of human cytomegalovirus and indicate that PDGFRα and the viral gO subunit could be targeted by novel anti-viral therapies.
Recently, some endocannabinoids were reported to show anti-inflammatory and anti-allergic activities. In this respect, various arachidonoyl endocannabinoids were screened for the inhibition of allergic response in IgE-activated RBL-2H3 cells. Among arachidonoyl endocannabinoids with a low cytotoxicity, only NA-5HT remarkably inhibited the release of β-hexosaminidase (IC(50), 13.58 μM), a marker of degranulation, and tumor necrosis factor-α (IC(50), 12.52 μM), a pro-inflammatory cytokine, in IgE-activated RBL-2H3 cells. Additionally, NA-5HT markedly suppressed the formation of prostaglandin D(2) (PGD(2)) with IC(50) value of 1.27 μM and leukotriene B(4) (LTB(4)) with IC(50) value of 1.20 μM, and slightly LTC4. When effect of NA-5HT on early stage of FcεRI cascade was investigated, it significantly inhibited phosphorylation of Syk, but not Lyn. Furthermore, NA-5HT suppressed phosphorylation of PLCγ1/2 and PKCδ, related to degranulation process, as well as phosphorylation of LAT, ERK1/2, p38, JNK, Gab2, PI3K and Akt, implicated in the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Relative to its effect on the late stage, NA-5HT slightly reduced phosphorylation of 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2). Additionally, NA-5HT significantly reduced the level of p40(phox), and partially inhibited the expression of p47(phox) and p67(phox). From these results, it is suggested that NA-5HT expresses anti-allergic action by suppressing the activation of Syk, LAT, p38, JNK, PI3K and Akt, as well as the expression of ERK1/2 and NADPH oxidase subunits. Further, a strong inhibition of PGD(2) or LTB(4) biosynthesis by NA-5HT may be an additional mechanism for its anti-allergic action. Such anti-allergic actions of NA-5HT may contribute to further information about its biological functions.
Hydrolysis of GTP by dynamin is essential for budding clathrin-coated vesicles from the plasma membrane. Two distinct domains of dynamin are implicated in the interactions with dynamin GTPase activators. Microtubules and Grb2 bind to the carboxyl-terminal proline/arginine-rich domain (PRD), whereas phosphoinositides bind to the pleckstrin homology (PH) domain. In this study we tested the effect of different phosphoinositides on dynamin GTPase activity and found that the best activator is phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate followed by 1-O-(1, 2-di-O-palmitoyl-sn-glycerol-3-benzyloxyphosphoryl)-D-myo-inositol 3,4,5-triphosphate. Phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate was a weak activator and phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate did not activate GTPase at all. We then addressed the question of whether both domains of dynamin, PRD and PH, can be engaged simultaneously, and determined the effects of dual occupancy on dynamin GTPase activity. We found that Grb2 and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate together increased the dynamin GTPase activity up to 4-fold higher than that obtained by these activators tested separately, and also reduced the dynamin concentration required for half-maximal activities by 3-fold. These results indicate that both stimulators can bind to dynamin simultaneously resulting in superactivation of dynamin GTPase activity. We propose that SH3-containing proteins such as Grb2 bind to the dynamin PRD to target it to clathrin-coated pits and prime it for superactivation by phosphoinositides.
We report here the purification and the crystallization of the modular protein Grb2. The protein was expressed as a fusion with glutathione-S-transferase and purified by affinity chromatography on glutathione agarose. It was apparent from reverse phase chromatography that the purified protein was conformationally unstable. Instability was overcome by the addition of 100 mM arginine to the buffers. Because Grb2 appeared to be extremely sensitive to oxidation, crystallization experiments were performed with a dialysis button technique involving daily addition of fresh DTT to the reservoirs. The presence of 8 to 14% glycerol was necessary to obtain monocrystals. These results are discussed in relation with the modular nature of Grb2.
Interferons (IFNs) exert antiproliferative effects on many types of cells. The underlying molecular mechanism, however, is unclear. One possibility is that IFNs block growth factor-induced mitogenic signaling, which involves activation of Ras/Raf-1/MEK/mitogen-activated protein kinase. We have tested this hypothesis by using HER14 cells (NIH 3T3 cell expressing both platelet-derived growth factor [PDGF] and epidermal growth factor [EGF] receptors) as a model system. Our studies showed that IFNs (alpha/beta and gamma) blocked PDGF-and phorbol ester- but not EGF-stimulated DNA synthesis and cell proliferation. While the ligand-stimulated receptor tyrosine phosphorylation and interaction with downstream signaling molecules, such as GRB2, were not affected, IFNs specifically blocked PDGF- and phorbol ester- but not EGF-stimulated activation of Raf-1, mitogen-activated protein kinases, and tyrosine phosphorylation of an unidentified 34-kDa protein. This inhibition could be detected as early as 5 min after IFN treatments and was insensitive to cycloheximide, indicating that de novo protein synthesis is not required. The IFN-induced inhibition acted upstream of Raf-1 kinase and downstream of diacyl glycerol/phorbol ester, suggesting that protein kinase C (PKC) is the potential primary target. Consistently, downregulation of PKC by chronic phorbol myristate acetate treatment or inhibition of PKC by H7 and staurosporine blocked PDGF- and phorbol myristate acetate- but not EGF-induced signaling and DNA synthesis. Moreover, incubating cells with antisense oligodeoxyribonucleotides of PKC delta eliminated production of PKC delta protein and specifically blocked PDGF- but not EGF-stimulated mitogenesis in these cells. Thus, these studies have elucidated a major difference in the early events of EGF-and PDGF-stimulated signal transduction and, more importantly, revealed a novel mechanism by which IFNs may execute their antiproliferative function.
The composition of an infant's gut microbiome can impact their immediate and long-term health. Bifdobacteria play a major role in structuring the gut microbiome of breastfed infants due to their ability to consume oligosaccharides found in human milk. However, recent studies have revealed that bifidobacteria are often absent in the gut microbiome of breastfed infants in some locations. This lack of colonization may be due either to differences in the environmental conditions in the gastrointestinal tract of uncolonized infants which prohibit the growth of bifidobacteria or a dearth of sources from which infants may acquire these specialized bacterial species. Potential mechanisms by which these broad factors may lead to lower colonization of infants by bifidobacteria are discussed herein. Environmental conditions which may select against bifidobacteria include low rates/duration of breastfeeding, milk glycan composition, and antimicrobial use. Routes of colonization by bifidobacteria which may be disrupted include maternal transfer via vaginal birth, fecal-oral routes, or via breast milk itself. A careful contemplation of the conditions experienced by bifidobacteria over human evolutionary history may lead to further hypotheses as to the causative factors of the differential colonization by this foundation genus in some contemporary locations.
Early-life interaction with indigenous intestinal microbes is a prerequisite for healthy immune and metabolic maturation. Human infants acquire their gut microbiota predominantly from the mother. A considerable inoculum of microbes is received by the neonate during vaginal delivery. Recent observations suggest that human gut colonization may be initiated prenatally by microbes in amniotic fluid, but the significance of this phenomenon remains unknown. After birth, neonatal gut colonization is guided by human milk factors, which selectively promote the growth of specific microbes, as well as by live microbes present in human milk. Aberrant gut colonization in early life has been associated with an increased risk of noncommunicable diseases in later life. Epidemiological and experimental studies suggest a causal relationship between early-life gut microbiota perturbations and disease risk. Perinatal antibiotic exposure, cesarean section delivery, postnatal antibiotic administration, and formula feeding, which may disrupt intestinal microecology, have been associated with disease development in later life. The modulation of gut microbiota in the perinatal period by pre- and probiotics, for example, may offer a means to reduce the risk of chronic diseases.
Children with optic pathway glioma (OPG) face sequelae related to tumour location and treatment modalities. We aimed to assess the prevalence of hypothalamic-pituitary dysfunctions in children with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) and OPG who did not receive radiotherapy or surgical resection. The causative role of tumour location on endocrinopathy development is investigated.
A retrospective follow-up study of 40 children with NF1 and OPG evaluated between August 1996 and May 2015 was undertaken. Patients who underwent radiotherapy or surgical resection were excluded and 36 patients were studied. Tumour location was classified according to the Dodge criteria: stage I, optic nerve alone; stage II, optic chiasm with or without optic nerve involvement; and stage III, involvement of the hypothalamus or other adjacent structures.
Endocrinopathies were diagnosed in 20/36 (55.6%) children during a mean follow-up of 9.1 (0.2-13.6) years: 0/4 OPGs were Dodge stage I, 12/21 (57.1%) stage II, and 8/11 (72.7%) stage III. The first endocrinopathy was found at a mean age of 7.4 (5.0-13.2) years, 2.4 (0-6.7) years after tumour diagnosis. We found growth hormone deficiency (GHD; 36.1%), central precocious puberty (33.3%), obesity with insulin resistance/impaired glucose tolerance (11.1%), early puberty (5.5%), GH excess (5.5%), ACTH deficiency (5.5%), hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (2.7%), and thyrotropin deficiency (2.7%). GHD was transient in all of those who were retested.
This population is at high risk of endocrinopathies due to tumour location. Lifelong endocrine follow-up is recommended. .
Creation of Technosols in combination with phytostabilization may be a sustainable strategy to minimize the environmental and human health hazards derived from mine tailings. Bioaugmentation can facilitate plant establishment and growth for efficient phytostabilization. In order to assess if bioaugmentation can increase soil quality and fertility, decrease metal(loid) mobility and accelerate plant colonization, a one-year field experiment was designed with creation of Technosols in two tailings ponds with different pH (acidic (AT) and neutral (NT)), with addition of marble waste (MaW) and two organic materials (pig manure (PM) and sewage sludge (SS), without or with inoculation of effective microorganisms (EM) at three rates. Results showed that MaW was the main factor responsible for maintaining pH ~7 in AT and ~8 in NT, decreasing salinity, and decreasing the soluble fraction of metals (70-99%). The soluble fraction of As decreased ~45% in AT, related to increases in pH up to neutrality, while increased ~90% in NT with PM due to pH&gt;8 and higher content of organic compounds. The addition of PM and SS significantly increased soil organic C (SOC), nutrient contents and microbial biomass and activity in both tailings, being PM more effective. However, a positive priming effect was observed in NT with SS addition likely due to higher C/N ratio and lack of nutrients. There was a significant effect of EM rate on inorganic C, SOC, N, K and microbial biomass and activity, with higher values as rate increased. Vegetation richness and density directly increased with increasing EM rate. Multivariate analyses showed that the most important properties contributing to increase richness and plant density were microbial biomass and N. Thus, bioaugmentation contributed to soil C sequestration (as organic and inorganic C) and soil fertility, related to high soil microbial biomass and activity, which facilitated an effective colonization of vegetation.
Measurement of carbon dynamics of soybean (Glycine max L.) ecosystems outside Corn Belt of the United States (U.S.) is lacking. This study examines the seasonal variability of net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE) and its components (gross primary production, GPP and ecosystem respiration, ER), and relevant controlling environmental factors between rainfed (El Reno, Oklahoma) and irrigated (Stoneville, Mississippi) soybean fields in the southern U.S. during the 2016 growing season. Grain yield was about 1.6tha(-1) for rainfed soybean and 4.9tha(-1) for irrigated soybean. The magnitudes of diurnal NEE (~2-weeks average) reached seasonal peak values of -23.18 and -34.78μmolm(-2)s(-1) in rainfed and irrigated soybean, respectively, approximately two months after planting (i.e., during peak growth). Similar thresholds of air temperature (Ta, slightly over 30°C) and vapor pressure deficit (VPD, ~2.5kPa) for NEE were observed at both sites. Daily (7-day average) NEE, GPP, and ER reached seasonal peak values of -4.55, 13.54, and 9.95gCm(-2)d(-1) in rainfed soybean and -7.48, 18.13, and 14.93gCm(-2)d(-1) in irrigated soybean, respectively. The growing season (DOY 132-243) NEE, GPP, and ER totals were -54, 783, and 729gCm(-2), respectively, in rainfed soybean. Similarly, cumulative NEE, GPP, and ER totals for DOY 163-256 (flux measurement was initiated on DOY 163, missing first 45days after planting) were -291, 1239, and 948gCm(-2), respectively, in irrigated soybean. Rainfed soybean was a net carbon sink for only two months, while irrigated soybean appeared to be a net carbon sink for about three months. However, grain yield and the magnitudes and seasonal sums of CO2 fluxes for irrigated soybean in this study were comparable to those for soybean in the U.S. Corn Belt, but they were lower for rainfed soybean.
The aim of this study was to determine the role of DNA methylation of the platelet-derived growth factor-D (PDGFD) gene promoter in the development of intracranial aneurysms (IAs) and brain arteriovenous malformations (BAVMs). A total of 70 patients with IAs or BAVMs and 26 control individuals were enrolled for this study. The PDGFD level in the plasma was determined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. DNA methylation levels of seven cytosine-phosphate-guanine (CpG) dinucleotides present in the PDGFD gene promoter were measured using bisulfite pyrosequencing technology. The plasma PDGFD levels in IA and BAVM were significantly lower than those in the control group (p = 0.0008 and 0.002, respectively). CpG1 methylation levels of the PDGFD gene promoter were significantly higher in IA patients (4.63 ± 0.35, p = 0.017) than in the control group (3.36 ± 0.35). CpG1 methylation of the PDGFD gene promoter in BAVM patients (6.00 ± 0.86, p = 0.003) was also significantly higher than that in the control group, although these differences were seen in both male and female patients (p = 2.81E-04 and p = 0.017, respectively). In addition, CpG1 methylation of the PDGFD promoter was associated with apolipoprotein E (APOE) levels in IA patients (p = 0.013). In conclusion, our study has demonstrated significant correlations between DNA methylation of the PDGFD gene promoter and the risk of developing either IA or BAVM. Furthermore, PDGFD gene promoter CpG1 methylation shows a significant correlation with APOE in IAs. Further functional studies on these relationships and correlations are warranted.
Low temperature is one of the most common environmental stresses that seriously affects the growth and development of plants. However, plants have the plasticity in their defense mechanisms enabling them to tolerate and, sometimes, even survive adverse environmental conditions. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs, approximately 19-21 nucleotides in length, and are being increasingly recognized as regulators of gene expression at the post-transcriptional level and have the ability to influence a broad range of biological processes. There is growing evidence in the literature that reprogramming of gene expression mediated through miRNAs, is a major defense mechanism in plants enabling them to respond to stresses. To date, numerous studies have established the importance of miRNA-based regulation of gene expression under low temperature stress. Individual miRNAs can modulate the expression of multiple mRNA targets and, therefore, the manipulation of a single miRNA has the potential to affect multiple biological processes. Numerous functional studies have attempted to identify the miRNA-target interactions and have elaborated the role of several miRNAs in cold-stress regulation. This review summarizes the current understanding of miRNA-mediated modulation of the expression of key genes as well as genetic and regulatory pathways, involved in low temperature stress responses in plants.
Honeybees face many parasites and pathogens and consequently rely on a diverse set of individual and group-level defenses to prevent disease. The crop microbiota of Apis mellifera, composed of 13 Lactic Acid Bacterial (LAB) species within the genera Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium, form a beneficial symbiotic relationship with each other and the honeybee to protect their niche and their host. Possibly playing a vital role in honeybee health, it is important that these honeybee specific Lactic Acid Bacterial (hbs-LAB) symbionts can be correctly identified, isolated and cultured, to further investigate their health promoting properties. We have previously reported successful identification to the strain level by culture-dependent methods and we recently sequenced and annotated the genomes of the 13 hbs-LAB. However, the hitherto applied techniques are unfortunately very time consuming, expensive and not ideal when analyzing a vast quantity of samples. In addition, other researchers have constantly failed to identify the 13 hbs-LAB from honeybee samples by using inadequate media and/or molecular techniques based on 16S rRNA gene sequencing with insufficient discriminatory power. The aim of this study was to develop better and more suitable methods for the identification and cultivation of hbs-LAB. We compared currently used bacterial cultivation media and could for the first time demonstrate a significant variation in the hbs-LAB basic requirements for optimal growth. We also present a new bacterial identification approach based on amplicon sequencing of a region of the 16S rRNA gene using the Illumina platform and an error correction software that can be used to successfully differentiate and rapidly identify the 13 hbs-LAB to the strain level.
It has been proposed that protein supplementation during resistance exercise training enhances muscle hypertrophy. The degree of hypertrophy during training is controlled in part through activation of satellite cells and myonuclear accretion.
To determine the efficacy of protein supplementation (and the type of protein) during traditional resistance training on myofiber cross-sectional-area, satellite cell content and myonuclear addition.
Healthy young men participated in supervised whole body progressive resistance training 3d/wk for 12 weeks. Participants were randomized to one of three groups ingesting a daily 22g macronutrient dose of soy-dairy protein blend (PB, N=22), whey protein isolate (WP, N=15) or an isocaloric maltodextrin placebo (MDP, N=17). Lean mass, vastus lateralis myofiber-type-specific cross-sectional-area, satellite cell content and myonuclear addition were assessed pre and post resistance training.
PB and the pooled protein treatments (PB+WP=PRO) exhibited a greater whole body lean mass %change compared to MDP (p=0.057 for PB) and (P=0.050 for PRO), respectively. All treatments demonstrated similar leg muscle hypertrophy and vastus lateralis myofiber-type-specific cross-sectional-area (P&lt;0.05). Increases in myosin heavy chain I and II myofiber satellite cell content and myonuclei content were also detected following exercise training (P&lt;0.05).
Protein supplementation during resistance training has a modest effect on whole body lean mass as compared to exercise training without protein supplementation and there was no effect on any outcome between protein supplement types (Blend vs Whey). However, protein supplementation did not enhance resistance exercise-induced increases in myofiber hypertrophy, satellite cell content or myonuclear addition in young healthy men. We propose that as long as protein intake is adequate during muscle overload the adaptations in muscle growth and function will not be influenced by protein supplementation.
Human lysine demethylase (KDM) enzymes (KDM1-7) constitute an emerging class of therapeutic targets, with activities that support growth and development of metastatic disease. By interacting with and co-activating the androgen receptor, the KDM4 subfamily (KDM4A-E) promotes aggressive phenotypes of prostate cancer (PCa). Knockdown of KDM4 expression or inhibition of KDM4 enzyme activity reduces the proliferation of PCa cell lines and highlights inhibition of lysine demethylation as a possible therapeutic method for PCa treatment. To address this possibility, we screened the ChemBioNet small molecule library for inhibitors of the human KDM4E isoform and identified several compounds with IC50 values in the low micromolar range. Two hits, validated as active by an orthogonal enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, displayed moderate selectivity toward the KDM4 subfamily and exhibited antiproliferative effects in cellular models of PCa. These compounds were further characterized by their ability to maintain the transcriptionally silent histone H3 tri-methyl K9 epigenetic mark at subcytotoxic concentrations. Taken together, these efforts identify and validate a hydroxyquinoline scaffold and a novel benzimidazole pyrazolone scaffold as tractable for entry into hit-to-lead chemical optimization campaigns.
Recently, emerging evidence has demonstrated that metastasis-associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1 (MALAT1), a long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), contributes to the initiation and development of tumors, including osteosarcoma (OS). Multiple studies have suggested an oncogenic role of MALAT1 and high-mobility group protein B1 (HMGB1) in OS tumorigenesis and metastasis, but the effects and mechanisms are not unanimous. Here, we showed that MALAT1 and HMGB1 were significantly increased in human OS cell lines and knockdown of MALAT1 reduced HMGB1 expression. By using online tools, we screen out 2 candidate miRNAs, miR-142-3p and miR-129-5p which may be associated with both MALAT1 and HMGB1. Luciferase reporter assay revealed a direct interaction between the 2 miRNAs and MALAT1, respectively, via a putative binding site within MALAT1. Meanwhile, both the 2 miRNAs could bind to HMGB1 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) and regulate HMGB1 expression. Moreover, knockdown of MALAT1 decreased HMGB1 expression, inhibited OS cell growth and promoted apoptosis, while miR-142-3p and miR-129-5p inhibitor partly restored the inhibitory effect of MALAT1 knockdown on HMGB1 expression, OS cell growth and the promotion of apoptosis. In OS tissues, the expression of MALAT1 and HMGB1 was upregulated while the expression of miR-142-3p and miR-129-5p was downregulated. Together, our results support a MALAT1/miR-142-3p/miR-129-5p/HMGB1 axis in OS cell proliferation and tumor progression. MALAT1 promoted OS cell growth through inhibition of miR-142-3p or miR-129-5p and by targeting HMGB1.
To investigate the effects of interferon-γ (IFN-γ) on the proliferation and viability of human embryonic lung Mrc-5 fibroblasts in vitro and the expression of the A Disintegrin and Metalloprotease 33 (ADAM33) gene and to explore the mechanism of airway remodeling.
Mrc-5 fibroblasts were sensitized with Dermatophagoides farinae 1 (Derf1) in vitro to mimic in vivo conditions observed in bronchial asthma. An inverted fluorescence microscope was used to observe changes in cell morphology before and after treatment. The viability of Mrc-5 cells was tested using the Cell Counting kit-8 (CCK8). Expression of the ADAM33 gene and protein in Mrc-5 cells was assessed using qPCR and Western blotting, respectively.
Different concentrations of Derf1 increased cell growth and the expression of the ADAM33 gene in Mrc-5 cells, and these changes were most obvious in the 10 μg/ml group. In contrast, IFN-γ decreased cell growth and the expression of the ADAM33 gene in both Mrc-5 cells and Derf1-induced Mrc-5 cells, and these changes were most obvious in the 10 ng/ml group. The negative effects of 10 ng/ml IFN-γ were the most significant at 32 h.
Derf1-induced Mrc-5 cells successfully imitated the in vivo conditions observed in patients with asthma. IFN-γ inhibited the proliferation and viability of Mrc-5 cells, and Derf1-induced Mrc-5 cells were more sensitive to IFN-γ treatment. IFN-γ treatment significantly downregulated the expression of the ADAM33 gene in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. IFN-γ may participate in airway remodeling in asthma by regulating the expression of the ADAM33 gene.
This study explores ibuprofen (IBP) uptake and transformation in the wetland plant species Phragmites australis and the underlying mechanisms. We grew P. australis in perlite under greenhouse conditions and treated plants with 60 µg/l of IBP. Roots and rhizomes (RR), stems and leaves (SL), and liquid samples were collected during 21 days of exposure. Results show that P. australis can take up, translocate, and degrade IBP. IBP was completely removed from the liquid medium after 21 days with a half-life of 2.1 days. IBP accumulated in RR and was partly translocated to SL. Meanwhile, four intermediates were detected in the plant tissues: hydroxy-IBP, 1,2-dihydroxy-IBP, carboxy-IBP and glucopyranosyloxy-hydroxy-IBP. Cytochrome P450 monooxygenase was involved in the production of the two hydroxy intermediates. We hypothesize that transformation of IBP was first catalyzed by P450, and then by glycosyltransferase, followed by further storage or metabolism in vacuoles or cell walls. No significant phytotoxicity was observed based on relative growth of plants and stress enzyme activities. In conclusion, we demonstrated for the first time that P. australis degrades IBP from water and is therefore a suitable species for application in constructed wetlands to clean wastewater effluents containing IBP and possibly also other micropollutants.
Neuroplasticity, the brain's capacity to be shaped in response to environmental experience, has been claimed to resemble a double-edged sword - potentiating growth and healing when individuals are exposed to normative, benign or therapeutic environments on the one hand, mediating mental disorder development in those exposed to adversity, on the other. However, questions about the scope and limits of neuroplasticity and, especially, its clinical significance, remain unanswered.
Sulforaphene (SFE), a naturally occurring isothiocyanate found in cruciferous vegetables, has attracted increasing attention for its anti-cancer effect in many cancers, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the precise role of SFE in the radiosensitivity of HCC is still unclear. Here, cell proliferation and apoptosis were detected by MTT and flow cytometry assay, respectively. The activity of NF-κB was further evaluated by ELISA. We also observed the effect of SFE and/or radiation on tumor growth. The results showed that SFE inhibited cell proliferation and induced apoptosis in HCC cells. Radiation increased NF-kB activity, while PDTC, a NF-kB inhibitor, enhanced radiation-induced cell death. SFE inhibited NF-kB activity and the downstream gene expressions of the NF-kB pathway in HCC cells. Moreover, SFE enhanced the inhibitory effect of radiation on tumor growth both in vitro and in vivo. This study indicated that SFE sensitized the radiosensitivity of HCC by blocking the NF-kB pathway.
Macroalgae contribute approximately 15% of the primary productivity in coastal marine ecosystems, fix up to 27.4 Tg of carbon per year, and provide important structural components for life in coastal waters. Despite this ecological and commercial importance, direct measurements and comparisons of the short-term responses to elevated pCO2 in seaweeds with different life-history strategies are scarce. Here, we cultured several seaweed species (bloom-forming/non-bloom-forming/perennial/annual) in the laboratory, in tanks in an in-door mesocosm facility, and in coastal mesocosms under pCO2 levels ranging from 400 μatm to 2000 μatm. We find that, across all scales of the experimental set-up, ephemeral species of the genus Ulva increase their photosynthesis and growth rates in response to elevated pCO2 the most, whereas longer-lived perennial species show a smaller increase or a decrease. These differences in short-term growth- and photosynthesis rates are likely to give bloom-forming green seaweeds a competitive advantage in mixed communities, and our results thus suggest that coastal seaweed assemblages in eutrophic waters may undergo an initial shift toward communities dominated by bloom-forming, short-lived seaweeds.

Sheng et al (Neurourology and Urodynamics 2017; DOI: 10.1002/nau.23210) presented a meta-analysis based on 17 publications to show that urinary nerve growth factor (NGF) may be a useful biomarker for overactive bladder syndrome (OAB). Unfortunately, 13 of the 17 studies used an unspecifc enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), the Promega NGF Emax Immunoassay, to quantify NGF in urine. This assay did not detect NGF in urine, but other urinary components, such as immunoglobulin G, and in 2014, it was withdrawn from the market. With other NGF-ELISAs, urinary NGF concentrations were found to be below detection level for both, OAB and healthy controls. Currently, ELISA techniques are not sensitive enough to detect NGF in urine, and urinary NGF cannot be used as a biomarker for OAB.
The β-nitrostyrene family possesses anticancer properties. In this study, β-nitrostyrene derivative CYT-Rx20 (3'-hydroxy-4'-methoxy-β-methyl-β-nitrostyrene) was synthesized and investigated its anticancer activity in oral cancer.
Anticancer activity of CYT-Rx20 and the underlying mechanisms were analyzed using cell viability assay, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation assay, fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis, annexin V staining, comet assay, glutathione (GSH)/glutathione disulfide (GSSG) ratio, immunoblotting, soft agar assay, nude mice xenograft study, and immunohistochemistry.
CYT-Rx20-induced cell apoptosis via ROS generation and mitochondrial membrane potential reduction, associated with release of mitochondrial cytochrome C to cytosol and activation of downstream caspases and poly ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP). Furthermore, CYT-Rx20 induced mitochondrial ROS accumulation and mitochondrial dysfunction, followed by GSH downregulation. CYT-Rx20-induced cell apoptosis, ROS generation, and DNA damage were reversed by thiol antioxidants. In nude mice, CYT-Rx20 inhibited oral tumor growth accompanied by increased expression of γH2AX, GSH reductase, and cleaved-caspase-3.
CYT-Rx20 has the potential to be further developed into an antioral cancer drug clinically. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Head Neck, 2017.
The aim of this study was to determine the similarities and differences of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) treatment patterns in daily practice in 5 European countries and whether these reflect differences in guidelines.
Prescriptions for drugs used in diabetes treatment during a 5-year study period were obtained from electronic databases. Patients initiating T2DM treatment during the study period were included. An SAS analysis tool was developed to create episodes of use of drug classes, which resulted in treatment patterns.
A total of 253,530 patients initiating T2DM treatment during the study period were included; 52% to 55% were male, and the mean age ranged from 62 to 67 years. Metformin was the most common initial treatment in all countries. After initial therapy, most patients in the Netherlands, Spain, and the United Kingdom switched to a combination of metformin + a sulfonylurea derivative (SU). In Italy, metformin in combination with an SU was outnumbered by "other treatment," mainly because of repaglinide use. In France, treatments including dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors were most frequent as second- and fourth-line treatment. Metformin monotherapy was again most commonly observed as the third line of treatment in all countries. Fourth treatment was a combination of metformin + an SU in the Netherlands and Spain; in the United Kingdom and France, dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors were the most frequently used fourth line of treatment.
This study provides a comprehensive overview of T2DM treatment patterns among patients initiating T2DM treatment in 5 European countries. There were differences, especially regarding the uptake of newer incretin-based treatments, which are usually prescribed as a second and/or third treatment in agreement with local guidelines. These variations reflect the differences between the national guidelines of these countries.
Urine culture at the point of care minimises delay between obtaining the sample and agar inoculation in a microbiology laboratory, and quantification and sensitivity results can be available more rapidly in primary care.
To identify the degree to which clinicians' interpretations of a point-of-care-test (POCT) urine culture (Flexicult™ SSI-Urinary Kit) agrees with laboratory culture in women presenting to primary care with symptoms of uncomplicated urinary tract infections (UTI).
Primary care clinicians used the Flexicult™-POCT, recorded their findings and took a photograph of the result, which was interpreted by microbiology laboratory technicians. Urine samples were additionally processed in routine care laboratories. Cross tabulations were used to identify important differences in organism identification, quantification and antibiotic susceptibility between these three sources of data. The influence of various laboratory definitions for UTI on culture were assessed.
Primary care clinicians identified 202/289 urine samples (69.9%) as positive for UTI using the Flexicult™-POCT, whereas laboratory culture identified 94-190 (32.5-65.7%) as positive, depending on definition thresholds. 82.9% of samples identified positive for E. coli on laboratory culture were also considered positive for E. coli using the Flexicult™ -POCT, and susceptibilities were reasonably concordant. There were major discrepancies between laboratory staff interpretation of Flexicult™ photographs, clinicians' interpretation of the Flexicult™ test, and laboratory culture results.
Flexicult™-POCT overestimated the positivity rate of urine samples for UTI when laboratory culture was used as the reference standard. However, it is unclear whether point-of-care or laboratory based urine culture provides the most valid diagnostic information.
Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common clinically significant cardiac arrhythmia. P-wave duration and interatrial blocks (IAB) have been reported to be associated with AF. Our aim was to determine the individual and combined association of P-wave duration and advanced IAB morphology with AF.
We designed an age-, sex-, and survey-matched case-control study nested in a population-based cohort (REGICOR: REgistre GIroní del COR). Two different surveys recruited a total of 9380 participants from 1999 to 2005; all participants were invited to a second examination between 2009 and 2013. For the present study, we selected participants aged 25 to 79 years with follow-up through the end of the study. All electrocardiograms were analyzed by 2 observers to determine P-wave duration and morphology (normal, partial, or advanced IAB).
The median follow-up was 7.12 years. Eighty participants presented with AF, had a legible baseline electrocardiogram, and were included in the study, along with 160 controls. P-wave duration and the presence of partial or advanced IAB were associated with AF. When P-wave duration and morphology were considered together, only P-wave duration (≥ 110 milliseconds) showed an independent and strong association with AF. The odds ratio for AF of P-wave duration between 110-119, 120-129 and ≥ 130 milliseconds vs &lt; 110 milliseconds were 5.33; 95%CI, 1.74-16.33, 5.08; 95%CI, 1.73-14.90 and 5.44; 95%CI, 1.95-15.15, respectively.
A P-wave longer than 110 milliseconds increases the risk of AF. Advanced IAB morphology did not seem to provide an additional AF risk beyond that of P-wave duration.
To evaluate the impact of computerized clinical practice guidelines on the management, diagnosis, treatment, control, and follow-up of the main cardiovascular risk factors: hypertension, hypercholesterolaemia, and type 2 diabetes mellitus.
Pre-post controlled study.
Catalonia, autonomous community located in north-eastern Spain.
Individuals aged 35-74 years assigned to general practitioners of the Catalan Health Institute.
The intervention group consisted of individuals whose general practitioners had accessed the computerized clinical practice guidelines at least twice a day, while the control group consisted of individuals whose general practitioner had never accessed the computerized clinical practice guidelines platform.
The Chi-squared test was used to detect significant differences in the follow-up, control, and treatment variables for all three disorders (hypertension, hypercholesterolaemia, and type 2 diabetes mellitus) between individuals assigned to users and non-users of the computerized clinical practice guidelines, respectively.
A total of 189,067 patients were included in this study, with a mean age of 56 years (standard deviation 12), and 55.5% of whom were women. Significant differences were observed in hypertension management, treatment and control; type 2 diabetes mellitus management, treatment and diagnoses, and the management and control of hypercholesterolaemia in both sexes.
Computerized clinical practice guidelines are an effective tool for the control and follow-up of patients diagnosed with hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and hypercholesterolaemia. The usefulness of computerized clinical practice guidelines to diagnose and adequately treat individuals with these disorders remains unclear.
It is common to find a high variability in the accuracy of heart failure (HF) diagnosis in electronic primary care medical records (EMR). Our aims were to ascertain (i) whether the prognosis of HF labelled patients whose ejection fraction (EF) was missing in their EMR differed from those that had it registered, and (ii) the causes contributing to the differences in the availability of EF in EMR.
Retrospective cohort analyses based on clinical records of HF and attended at 52 primary healthcare centres of Barcelona (Spain). Information of 8376 HF patients aged &gt; 40 years followed during five years was analyzed.
EF was available only in 8.5% of primary care medical records. Cumulate incidence for mortality and hospitalization from 1st January 2009 to 31th December 2012 was 37.6%. The highest rate was found in patients with missing EF (HR 1.84, 95% CI 1.68 -1.95) compared to those with preserved EF. Patients hospitalized the previous year and those requiring home healthcare (HR 1.81, 95% Confidence Interval 1.68-1.95 and HR 1.58, 95% CI 1.46-1.71, respectively) presented a higher risk of having an adverse outcome. Older patients, those more socio-economically disadvantaged, obese, requiring home healthcare, and taking loop diuretics were less likely to have an EF registered.
EF is poorly recorded in primary care. HF patients with EF missing at medical records had the worst prognosis. They tended to be older, socio-economically disadvantaged, and more fragile.
Concentrations of total suspended particulate matter, particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter &lt;2.5 μm (PM2.5), particulate matter &lt;10 μm (PM10), and fallout dust were measured at the Iranian Gol-E-Gohar Mining and Industrial Facility. Samples were characterized in terms of mineralogy, morphology, and oxidative potential. Results show that indoor samples exceeded the 24-h PM2.5 and PM10 mass concentration limits (35 and 150 µg m(-3), respectively) set by the US National Ambient Air Quality Standards. Calcite, magnetite, tremolite, pyrite, talc, and clay minerals such as kaolinite, vermiculite, and illite are the major phases of the iron ore PM. Accessory minerals are quartz, dolomite, hematite, actinolite, biotite, albite, nimite, laumontite, diopside, and muscovite. The scanning electron microscope structure of fibrous-elongated minerals revealed individual fibers in the range of 1.5 nm to 71.65 µm in length and 0.2 nm to 3.7 µm in diameter. The presence of minerals related to respiratory diseases, such as talc, crystalline silica, and needle-shaped minerals like amphibole asbestos (tremolite and actinolite), strongly suggests the need for detailed health-based studies in the region. The particulate samples show low to medium oxidative potential per unit of mass, in relation to an urban road side control, being more reactive with ascorbate than with glutathione or urate. However, the PM oxidative potential per volume of air is exceptionally high, confirming that the workers are exposed to a considerable oxidative environment. PM released by iron ore mining and processing activities should be considered a potential health risk to the mine workers and nearby employees, and strategies to combat the issue are suggested.
Diabetes mellitus is one of the most common metabolic diseases in humans, affecting 100 million people around the world.
Investigating the effects of Citrullus colocynthis pulp on oxidant and antioxidant factors of testes and epididymis in streptozotocin-induced diabetic male rats.
Thirty two male rats were divided into four groups (n=8) 1) N (normal) group, 2) N+C group, 3) D (diabetic) group and 4) D+C group. Groups N and D received normal saline 2 ml orally for two weeks and groups N+C and D+C received 10 mg/kg.bw Citrullus colocynthis pulp orally for two weeks. Diabetes was induced by single intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin (STZ) at 65 mg/kg.
D group had a significant increase in H2O2 (Hydrogen peroxide) and MDA (malondialdehyde) concentrations, and CAT (catalase) activity, and also a significant decrease in Peroxidase (POD) activity compared to N group. D+C group had a significant decrease in H2O2 and MDA concentrations and, CAT activity and significant increase in POD activity compared to D group.
Citrullus colocynthis pulp in two weeks had beneficial effects on oxidants and antioxidants changes in reproductive system in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats.
European cancer survival rates vary widely. System factors, including whether or not primary care physicians (PCPs) are gatekeepers, may account for some of these differences. This study explores where patients who may have cancer are likely to present for medical care in different European countries, and how probability of presentation to a primary care clinician correlates with cancer survival rates.
Seventy-eight PCPs in a range of European countries assessed four vignettes representing patients who might have cancer, and consensus groups agreed how likely those patients were to present to different clinicians in their own countries. These data were compared with national cancer survival rates.
A total of 14 countries.
Consensus groups of PCPs.
Probability of initial presentation to a PCP for four clinical vignettes.
There was no significant correlation between overall national 1-year relative cancer survival rates and the probability of initial presentation to a PCP (r  = -0.16, 95% CI -0.39 to 0.08). Within that there was large variation depending on the type of cancer, with a significantly poorer lung cancer survival in countries where patients were more likely to initially consult a PCP (lung r = -0.57, 95% CI -0.83 to -0.12; ovary: r = -0.13, 95% CI -0.57 to 0.38; breast r = 0.14, 95% CI -0.36 to 0.58; bowel: r = 0.20, 95% CI -0.31 to 0.62).
There were wide variations in the degree of gatekeeping between countries, with no simple binary model as to whether or not a country has a "PCP-as-gatekeeper" system. While there was case-by-case variation, there was no overall evidence of a link between a higher probability of initial consultation with a PCP and poorer cancer survival. KEY POINTS European cancer survival rates vary widely, and health system factors may account for some of these differences. The data from 14 European countries show a wide variation in the probability of initial presentation to a PCP. The degree to which PCPs act as gatekeepers varies considerably from country to country. There is no overall evidence of a link between a higher probability of initial presentation to a PCP and poorer cancer survival.
To analyze the reference range of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) in different BMI categories and its impact on the classification of hypothyroidism.
The study included 3,928 individuals free of thyroid disease (without previous thyroid disease, no interfering medications, TSH &lt;10 µUI/mL and thyroid peroxidase antibodies [TPO Abs] &lt;50 IU/mL) who participated in a national, cross-sectional, population-based study and were representative of the adult population of Spain. Data gathered included clinical and demographic characteristics, physical examination, and blood and urine sampling. TSH, free thyroxine, free triiodothyronine, and TPO Ab were analyzed by electrochemiluminescence (E170, Roche Diagnostics, Basel, Switzerland).
The reference range (p2.5-97.5) for TSH was estimated as 0.6 to 4.8 µUI/mL in the underweight category (BMI&lt;20 kg/m(2) ), 0.6 to 5.5 µUI/mL in the normal-weight category (BMI 20-24.9 kg/m(2) ), 0.6 to 5.5 µUI/mL in the overweight category (BMI 25-29.9 kg/m(2) ), 0.5 to 5.9 µUI/mL in the obesity category (BMI 30-39.9 kg/m(2) ), and 0.7 to 7.5 µUI/mL in the morbid obesity category (BMI ≥40). By using the reference criteria for the normal-weight population, the prevalence of high TSH levels increased threefold in the morbid obesity category (P &lt; 0.01).
Persons with morbid obesity might be inappropriately classified if the standard ranges of normality of TSH for the normal-weight population are applied to them.
To assess the effect of a nutrition education intervention included in the Home Care Program for caregivers to prevent the increasing risk of malnutrition of dependent patients at risk of malnutrition.
Randomized controlled multicenter trial of 6 months of duration and 12 months follow-up.
10 Primary Care Centers, Spain.
Patients enrolled in the Home Care Program between January 2010 and March 2012, who were dependent and at risk of malnutrition, older than 65, and had caregivers (n=190).
The nurses conducted initial educational intervention sessions for caregivers and then monitored at home every month for 6 months.
The nutritional status was assessed using the Mini Nutritional Assessment test (primary outcome), diet, anthropometry, and biochemical parameters (albumin, prealbumin, hemoglobin and cholesterol). Other descriptive and outcome measures were recorded: current medical history, Activities of daily living (Barthel test), cognitive state (Pfeiffer test), and mood status (Yesavage test). All the measures were recorded in a schedule of 0-6-12 months.
173 individuals participated after exclusions (intervention n=101; control n=72). Mean age was 87.8±8.9years, 68.2% were women. Difference were found between the groups for Mini Nutritional Assessment test score change (repeated measures ANOVA, F=10.1; P&lt;0.001), the intervention improved the Mini Nutritional Assessment test score of the participants in the intervention group. The egg consumption (F=4.1; P=0.018), protein intake (F=3.0; P=0.050), polyunsaturated fatty acid intake (F=5.3; P=0.006), folate (F=3.3; P=0.041) and vitamin E (F=6.4; P=0.002) showed significant group×time interactions.
A nutrition education intervention for caregivers halted the tendency of nutritional decline, and reduced the risk of malnutrition of older dependent patients.

Study of the causes of the reduced levels of physical activity in patients with COPD has been scarce and limited to biological factors.
To assess the relationship between novel socio-environmental factors, namely dog walking, grandparenting, neighbourhood deprivation, residential surrounding greenness and residential proximity to green or blue spaces, and amount and intensity of physical activity in COPD patients.
This cross-sectional study recruited 410 COPD patients from five Catalan municipalities. Dog walking and grandparenting were assessed by questionnaire. Neighbourhood deprivation was assessed using the census Urban Vulnerability Index, residential surrounding greenness by the satellite-derived Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, and residential proximity to green or blue spaces as living within 300 m of such a space. Physical activity was measured during 1 week by accelerometer to assess time spent on moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) and vector magnitude units (VMU) per minute.
Patients were 85% male, had a mean (SD) age of 69 (9) years, and post-bronchodilator FEV1 of 56 (17) %pred. After adjusting for age, sex, socio-economic status, dyspnoea, exercise capacity and anxiety in a linear regression model, both dog walking and grandparenting were significantly associated with an increase both in time in MVPA (18 min/day (p&lt;0.01) and 9 min/day (p&lt;0.05), respectively) and in physical activity intensity (76 VMU/min (p=0.05) and 59 VMUs/min (p&lt;0.05), respectively). Neighbourhood deprivation, surrounding greenness and proximity to green or blue spaces were not associated with physical activity.
Dog walking and grandparenting are associated with a higher amount and intensity of physical activity in COPD patients.

No studies have been conducted in Turkey to compare the quality of stroke prevention therapies provided in different healthcare settings in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF). Therefore, we aimed to evaluate possible differences between secondary (SH) and tertiary hospital (TH) settings in the effectiveness of implementing AF treatment strategies.
Baseline characteristics of 6273 patients with non-valvular AF enrolled in the RAMSES (ReAl-life Multicentre Survey Evaluating Stroke Prevention Strategies in Turkey) study were compared.
Of the study population, 3312 (52.8%) patients were treated in THs and 2961 (47.2%) patients were treated in SHs. Patients treated in the SH setting were older (70.8±9.8 vs. 68.7±11.4years, p&lt;0.001), had a lower socioeconomic status, had a higher CHA2DS2VASc and HASBLED scores (3.4±1.4 vs. 3.1±1.7, p&lt;0.001 and 1.7±1.0 vs. 1.6±1.1, p&lt;0.001 respectively), and had more comorbidities than patients treated in THs. Inappropriate oral anticoagulant use was more prevalent in SHs than THs (31.4% vs. 25.6%, p&lt;0.001). When over- and undertreatment rates were compared among hospital types, overtreatment was more prevalent in THs (7.6% vs. 0.9%, p&lt;0.001) while undertreatment was more common in SHs (30.5% vs. 17.9%, p&lt;0.001).
This study demonstrates the marked disparity between patient groups with AF presenting at SHs and THs. The use of guideline-recommended therapy is not adequate in either type of centre, overtreatment was more prevalent in THs and undertreatment was more prevalent in SHs.
The major objectives of the study were to test the hypothesis of the Zarrin-Gol River as a reference site for ecotoxicological studies and to assess the contamination degree of heavy metals and metalloids in the river using four contamination indices. For these purposes, eleven heavy metal and metalloid concentrations were analyzed. The average concentrations (mgkg(-1)) in the sediments were: 37.67 (chromium) 286.28 (manganese), 13,751.04 (iron), 8.79 (cobalt), 12.39 (nickel), 32.68 (zinc), 21.91 (arsenic), 40.59 (selenium), 2923.86 (aluminum), ND (silver) and 785.96 (magnesium). Contamination factor, enrichment factor, pollution load index, and geoaccumulation index were calculated to evaluate the contamination degree and influence of human activities on heavy metal levels. The contamination indices of the sediment samples showed that arsenic and selenium were the highest pollutants. The results indicated that the Zarrin-Gol River could not be used as a reference site at least for arsenic and selenium.
Heart failure (HF) is frequent and its prevalence is increasing. We aimed to evaluate the epidemiologic features of HF patients, the 1-year follow-up outcomes and the independent predictors of those outcomes at a population level.
Population-based longitudinal study including all prevalent HF cases in Catalonia (Spain) on December 31st, 2012. Patients were divided in 3 groups: patients without a previous HF hospitalization, patients with a remote (&gt;1 year) HF hospitalization and patients with a recent (&lt;1 year) HF admission. We analyzed 1year all-cause and HF hospitalizations, and all-cause mortality. Logistic regression was used to identify the independent predictors of each of those outcomes. A total of 88,195 patients were included. Mean age was 77 years, 55% were women. Comorbidities were frequent. Fourteen percent of patients had never been hospitalized, 71% had a remote HF hospitalization and 15% a recent hospitalization. At 1-year follow-up, all-cause and HF hospitalization were 53% and 8.8%, respectively. One-year all-cause mortality rate was 14%, and was higher in patients with a recent HF hospitalization (24%). The presence of diabetes mellitus, atrial fibrillation or chronic kidney disease was independently associated with all-cause and HF hospitalization and all-cause mortality. Hospital admissions and emergency department visits the previous year were also found to be independently associated with the three study outcomes.
Outcomes are different depending on the HF population studied. Some comorbidity, an all-cause hospitalization or emergency department visit the previous year were associated with a worse outcome.
To compare effects of rapid injection without aspiration and 10-second manual pressure before injection on pain severity and crying time in 4- to 6-month-old infants given the vaccine DTaP/IPV/Hib.
This is a randomized double-blind controlled study. The study population included all the infants presenting for DTaP/IPV/Hib to two family health centers between April and August in 2015. The study sample included 128 infants based on confidence interval of 95% and statistical power of 80%. The sample was divided into four groups: manual pressure, rapid injection without aspiration, manual pressure combined with rapid injection without aspiration, and control groups. There were 32 infants in each group. Gender was adjusted in all groups. Stratified and block randomizations were used.
Pain severity scores and crying time during and after the injections were significantly lower in the three intervention groups than in the control group (p = .001). The lowest increase in the mean heart rate during and after the injections occurred in the rapid injection without aspiration group (p &lt; .05). In addition, the mean oxygen saturation before, during and after the injections was significantly lower in this group than in the other groups (p &lt; .05). However, two infants in the rapid injection without aspiration group had low oxygen saturation levels starting before the injections. In fact, mean oxygen saturations did not change across time. This suggests that lower oxygen saturation in the rapid injection without aspiration group cannot be due to vaccines or the techniques used.
Manual pressure and rapid injection without aspiration are effective and useful in relief of pain and reduction of crying time due to vaccine injections in 4- to 6-month-old infants.
Total joint replacements for end-stage osteoarthritis of the hip and knee are cost-effective and demonstrate significant clinical improvement. However, robust population based lifetime-risk data for implant revision are not available to aid patient decision making, which is a particular problem in young patient groups deciding on best-timing for surgery.
We did implant survival analysis on all patients within the Clinical Practice Research Datalink who had undergone total hip replacement or total knee replacement. These data were adjusted for all-cause mortality with data from the Office for National Statistics and used to generate lifetime risks of revision surgery based on increasing age at the time of primary surgery.
We identified 63 158 patients who had undergone total hip replacement and 54 276 who had total knee replacement between Jan 1, 1991, and Aug 10, 2011, and followed up these patients to a maximum of 20 years. For total hip replacement, 10-year implant survival rate was 95·6% (95% CI 95·3-95·9) and 20-year rate was 85·0% (83·2-86·6). For total knee replacement, 10-year implant survival rate was 96·1% (95·8-96·4), and 20-year implant survival rate was 89·7% (87·5-91·5). The lifetime risk of requiring revision surgery in patients who had total hip replacement or total knee replacement over the age of 70 years was about 5% with no difference between sexes. For those who had surgery younger than 70 years, however, the lifetime risk of revision increased for younger patients, up to 35% (95% CI 30·9-39·1) for men in their early 50s, with large differences seen between male and female patients (15% lower for women in same age group). The median time to revision for patients who had surgery younger than age 60 was 4·4 years.
Our study used novel methodology to investigate and offer new insight into the importance of young age and risk of revision after total hip or knee replacement. Our evidence challenges the increasing trend for more total hip replacements and total knee replacements to be done in the younger patient group, and these data should be offered to patients as part of the shared decision making process.
The aim of the study is to carry out a cost-effectiveness analysis of three different interventions to promote the uptake of screening for cervical cancer in general practice in the county of Valles Occidental, Barcelona, Spain.
Women aged from 30 to 70 years (n = 15,965) were asked to attend a general practice to be screened. They were randomly allocated to one of four groups: no intervention group (NIG); one group where women received an invitation letter to participate in the screening (IG1); one group where women received an invitation letter and informative leaflet (IG2); and one group where women received an invitation letter, an informative leaflet and a phone call reminder (IG3). Clinical effectiveness was measured as the percentage increase in screening coverage. A cost-effectiveness analysis was performed from the perspective of the public health system with a time horizon of three to five years - the duration of the randomised controlled clinical trial. In addition, a deterministic sensitivity analysis was performed. Results are presented according to different age groups.
The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for the most cost-effective intervention, IG1, compared with opportunistic screening was € 2.78 per 1% increase in the screening coverage. The age interval with the worst results in terms of efficiency was women aged &lt; 40 years.
In a population like Catalonia, with around 2 million women aged 30 to 70 years and assuming that 40% of these women were not attending general practice to be screened for cervical cancer, the implementation of an intervention to increase screening coverage which consists of sending a letter would cost on average less than € 490 for every 1000 women.

Diabetes is a growing worldwide epidemic and a leading cause of blindness in working-age people around the world. Diabetic retinopathy (DR) and diabetic macular edema (DME) are common causes of visual impairment in people with diabetes and often indicate the presence of diabetes-associated preclinical micro- and macrovascular complications. As such, patients with DR and DME often display complex, highly comorbid profiles. Several treatments are currently available for the treatment of DME, including anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) agents, which are administered via intravitreal injection. While the safety profiles of approved ocular anti-VEGF therapies have been reassuring, the high-risk nature of the DME patient population means that treatment must be carefully considered and a holistic approach to disease management should be taken. This requires multidisciplinary, collaborative care involving all relevant specialties to ensure that patients not only receive prompt treatment for DME but also appropriate consideration is taken of any systemic comorbidities to evaluate and minimize potentially serious safety issues.
Poly(glycerol sebacate) (PGS) has been used successfully as a scaffolding material for soft tissue engineering. PGS scaffolds, however, are usually mechanically isotropic, which may restrict their use in tissue repairs as many soft tissues in the body have anisotropic mechanical behaviors. Although various methods have been used to fabricate anisotropic scaffolds, it remains challenging to make anisotropic scaffolds from thermoset PGS. Here a new, simple method to fabricate an anisotropic PGS membrane which can then be used to construct thicker three-dimensional anisotropic scaffolds was developed. First, an aligned sacrificial poly(vinyl alcohol) fibrous membrane was prepared by electrospinning. The fibrous membrane was then partially immersed in PGS prepolymer solution, resulting in a composite membrane upon drying. After curing, the sacrificial fibers within the membrane were removed by water, supposedly leaving aligned cylindrical pores in the membrane. Both SEM and AFM illustrated aligned grooves on the surface of the resultant PGS membrane, indicating the successful removal of sacrificial fibers. The PGS membrane was validated to be mechanically anisotropic using uniaxial tensile testing along and perpendicular to the predominant pore direction. The in vitro cytocompatibility of the PGS membrane was confirmed. As a demonstration of its potential application in vascular tissue engineering, a tubular scaffold was constructed by wrapping a stack of two axisymmetric pieces of the anisotropic PGS membranes on a mandrel. The compliance of the scaffold was found to depend on the pitch angle of its double helical structure, imitating the anisotropic mechanical behavior of the arterial media. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Undernutrition during pregnancy has been associated to increased vulnerability to develop metabolic and behavior alterations later in life. The endocannabinoid system might play an important role in these processes. Therefore, we investigated the effects of a moderate maternal calorie-restricted diet on the levels of the endocannabinoid 2-arachidonoyl glycerol (2-AG), arachidonic acid (AA) and the N-acylethanolamines (NAEs) anandamide (AEA), oleoylethanolamide (OEA) and palmitoylethanolamide (PEA) in the brain of newborn rat offspring. We focused on brain structures involved in metabolism, feeding behavior, as well as emotional and cognitive responses. Female Wistar rats were assigned during the entire pregnancy to either control diet (C) or restriction diet (R), consisting of a 20% calorie-restricted diet. Weight gain and caloric intake of rat dams were monitored and birth outcomes were assessed. 2-AG, AA and NAE levels were measured in hypothalamus, hippocampus and olfactory bulb of the offspring. R dams displayed lower gain weight from the middle pregnancy and consumed less calories during the entire pregnancy. Offspring from R dams were underweight at birth, but litter size was unaffected. In hypothalamus, R male offspring displayed decreased levels of AA and OEA, with no change in the levels of the endocannabinoids 2-AG and AEA. R female exhibited decreased 2-AG and PEA levels. The opposite was found in the hippocampus, where R male displayed increased 2-AG and AA levels, and R female exhibited elevated levels of AEA, AA and PEA. In the olfactory bulb, only R female presented decreased levels of AEA, AA and PEA. Therefore, a moderate diet restriction during the entire pregnancy alters differentially the endocannabinoids and/or endocannabinoid-related lipids in hypothalamus and hippocampus of the underweight offspring, similarly in both sexes, whereas sex-specific alterations occur in the olfactory bulb. Consequently, endocannabinoid and endocannabinoid-related lipid signaling alterations might be involved in the long-term and sexual dimorphism effects commonly observed after undernutrition and low birth weight.
The study aim was to investigate the effect of endogenous insulin release on lipolysis in subcutaneous adipose tissue after adrenergic stimulation in obese subjects diagnosed with type 2 diabetes (T2D). In 14 obese female T2D subjects, or 14 obese non-T2D controls, glycerol concentration was measured in response to the α1,2,ß-agonist norepinephrine, the α1-agonist norfenefrine and the ß2-agonist terbutaline (each 10-4 M), using the microdialysis technique. After 60 minutes of stimulation, an intravenous glucose load (0.5 g/kg lean body mass) was given. Local blood flow was monitored by means of the ethanol technique. Norepinephrine and norfenefrine induced a four and three fold rise in glycerol dialysate concentration (p&lt;0.001, each), with a similar pattern in adipose tissue. Following agonist stimulation and glucose infusion, endogenous insulin release inhibited lipolysis in the presence of norepinephrine, which was more rapid and pronounced in healthy obese controls than in T2D subjects (p = 0.024 obese vs T2D subjects). Insulin-induced inhibition of lipolysis in the presence of norfenefrine was similar in all study participants. In the presence of terbutaline the lipolysis rate increased two fold until the effect of endogenous insulin (p&lt;0.001). A similar insulin-induced decrease in lipolysis was observed for each of the norfenefrine groups and the terbutaline groups, respectively. Adipose tissue blood flow remained unchanged after the iv-glucose load. Both norepinephrine and norfenefrine diminished blood flow slightly, but insulin reversed this response (p&lt;0.001 over the entire time). Terbutaline alone and terbutaline plus increased endogenous insulin augmented local blood flow (p&lt;0.001 over the entire time). In conclusion, a difference in insulin-induced inhibition of lipolysis was observed in obese T2D subjects compared to obese healthy controls following modulation of sympathetic nervous system activity and is assumed to be due to ß1-adrenoceptor mediated stimulation by norepinephrine.
During exercise, blood levels of several hormones increase acutely. We hypothesized that consumption of a specific combination of amino acids (arginine, alanine, and phenylalanine; A-mix) may be involved in secretion of glucagon, and when combined with exercise may promote fat catabolism. Ten healthy male volunteers were randomized in a crossover study to ingest either A-mix (3 g/dose) or placebo (3 g of dextrin/dose). Thirty minutes after ingesting, each condition subsequently performed workload trials on a cycle ergometer at 50% of maximal oxygen consumption for 1 h. After oral intake of A-mix, the concentrations of plasma ketone bodies and adrenalin during and post-exercise were significantly increased. The area under the curve for glycerol and glucagon was significantly increased in the post-exercise by A-mix administration. These results suggest that pre-exercise ingestion of A-mix causes a shift of energy source from carbohydrate to fat combustion by increasing secretion of adrenalin and glucagon.
Lipids such as prostaglandins, leukotrienes and thromboxanes are released as a result of an inflammatory episode in pain (central and peripheral).
To measure these lipids as potential mechanistic biomarkers in neuropathic pain models, we developed a higher-throughput LC-MS/MS-based method with simultaneous detection of PGE2, PGD2, PGF2α, LTB4, TXB2 and 2-arachidonoyl glycerol in brain and spinal cord tissues. We also demonstrate that the LC-MS/MS method was more sensitive and specific in differentiating PGE2 levels in CNS tissues compared with ELISA.
The ability to modify the LC-MS/MS method to accommodate numerous other lipids in one analysis, demonstrates that the presented method offers a cost-effective and more sensitive alternative to ELISA method useful in drug discovery settings.
Nanoparticles can be used as markers to track the position of biomolecules, such as single proteins, inside living cells. The activity of a protein can sometimes be inferred from changes in the mobility of the attached particle. Mean Square Displacement analysis is the most common method to obtain mobility information from trajectories of tracked particles, such as the diffusion coefficient D. However, the precision of D sets a limit to discriminate changes in mobility caused by biological events from changes that reflect the stochasticity inherent to diffusion. This issue is of particular importance in an experiment aiming to quantify dynamic processes.
Here, we present simulations and 3D tracking experiments with Gold Nanorods freely diffusing in glycerol solution to establish the best analysis parameters to extract the diffusion coefficient. We applied this knowledge to the detection of a temporary change in diffusion, as it can occur due to the transient binding of a particle to an immobile structure within the cell, and tested its dependence on the magnitude of the change in diffusion and duration of this event.
The simulations show that the spatial accuracy of particle tracking generally does not limit the detection of short binding events. Careful analysis of the magnitude of the change in diffusion and the number of frames per binding event is required for accurate quantification of such events.
In this work Langmuir monolayer experiments were performed to analyze the effect of Cd(2+) ions and their mixtures with synthetic auxin (1-naphthaleneacetic acid - NAA) on lipid films. These investigations were motivated by the fact that auxins act effectively as the agents improving the removal of metal ions from contaminated water and soil by plants (phytoextraction), and although their mechanism of action in this area is still unclear, it was suggested that it can be membrane-related. The experiments were done for one component (1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine - DPPC; 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine - DOPC; 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-(1'-rac-glycerol) (sodium salt) - DPPG) monolayers and mixed (DPPG/DOPC and DPPG/DPPC) films treated as model of plant leaves membranes. The monolayer properties were analyzed based on the surface pressure-area isotherms obtained during film compression, stability measurements and Brewster angle microcopy studies. The collected results together with the data presented in literature evidenced that both metal ions and auxins modify lipid system properties and by using them in a combination it is possible to weaken the influence of sole metal ions on membrane organization. This seems to be in agreement with the hypothesis that the role of plant growth regulators in increasing phytoextraction effectiveness may be membrane-related. However, further experiments are required to find possible correlations between the type and concentration of metal ion, composition of membrane or structural elements in auxin molecule and observed alterations in membrane properties.
The inactivated foot and mouth disease virus (FMDV), which has a sedimentation coefficient of 146S, is crucial to the efficacy of vaccine preparations, but extremely unstable in vitro. It is prone to dissociate into smaller particles referred to as 12S with a concomitant decrease in immunogenicity; therefore, it is of great importance to find the best condition for stabilizing the FMDV. In the present work, the effects of solution pH and temperature on the dissociation of 146S was investigated and potential stabilizers were screened, with aid of high-performance size-exclusion chromatography (HPSEC) for rapid and quantitative determination of 146S, together with differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) technology for thermal stability analysis. The most stable pH was found between 7.5 and 8.0. Among excipients tested, sucrose and glycerol provided the best protection, such that the half-life of 146S in solution at 45°C could be prolonged from less than 30min to more than 3days by adding 20% sucrose. The stabilization mechanism was confirmed using DSC analysis, which showed that the transition temperature related to 146S dissociation was increased by 5.4°C in the presence of 20% sucrose. The physical stabilization effects afforded by these stabilizers would allow for the retaining of effective 146S antigens during transportation and storage under relative harsh condition.
We assessed the antimicrobial activity of reuterin produced in vitro in glycerol aqueous solutions in situ by Lactobacillus reuteri ATCC 53608 as part of a fermented milk product against starter (Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus), spoilage (Penicillium expansum), pathogenic (Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella enterica ssp. enterica, and Listeria monocytogenes), and pathogen surrogate (Escherichia coli DH5α) microorganisms. We also assayed the influence of cold storage (28 d at 4°C) and reuterin on the color and rheology of the fermented milk product. We obtained maximum reuterin concentrations of 107.5 and 33.97 mM in glycerol aqueous solution and fermented milk product, respectively. Reuterin was stable throughout its refrigerated shelf life. Gram-positive microorganisms were more resistant to reuterin than gram-negative microorganisms. Penicillium expansum and Lactobacillus reuteri ATCC 53608 survived at concentrations up to 10 and 8.5 mM, respectively. Escherichia coli DH5α was the most sensitive to reuterin (0.9 mM). The presence of reuterin did not cause relevant changes in the quality parameters of the fermented milk product, including pH, acidity, soluble solids, color, and rheological aspects (storage and loss moduli and viscosity). This study demonstrated the viability of using Lactobacillus reuteri ATCC 53608 as a biopreservative in a fermented milk product through reuterin synthesis, without drastically modifying its quality parameters.
The objective of this study was to determine the effects of anaplerosis of the tricarboxylic acid cycle on feeding behavior and energy intake of cows in the postpartum period. We infused propionic acid (PA) and glycerol (GL) continuously into the abomasum and hypothesized that PA will decrease meal size and energy intake compared with GL because PA enters the tricarboxylic acid cycle, likely stimulating oxidation of acetyl CoA and satiety compared with GL. Three experiments (Exp.) were conducted using 20 Holstein cows between 3 and 22 d postpartum (8 cows in Exp. 1 and 6 cows each for Exp. 2 and 3). Treatments were compared using isoenergetic (Exp. 1, 193 kcal/h) and isomolar (Exp. 2, ∼0.5 mol/h) continuous infusions of PA (99.5%) and GL (99.7%) to the abomasum using a double crossover design with four 2-d infusion periods each, and 2 mol of PA or GL pulse-dosed to the abomasum using a crossover design (Exp. 3). Treatment sequences were assigned alternately to cows based upon date of parturition. Feeding behavior was recorded by a computerized data acquisition system for Exp. 1 and 2. Propionic acid decreased dry matter intake (DMI) compared with GL 16.7 and 23.4% in Exp. 1 and 2, respectively. The decrease in DMI was because PA decreased meal size compared with GL by 12.6 and 15.3% in Exp. 1 and 2, respectively. Propionic acid decreased total metabolizable energy intake (diet plus treatment infusions) compared with GL for both experiments. Compared with PA, GL increased plasma glucose and insulin concentrations for Exp. 2 only. In Exp. 3, PA decreased hepatic acetyl CoA content 34%, whereas GL increased hepatic acetyl CoA content 32%, resulting in lower hepatic acetyl CoA content for PA compared with GL at 30 min (18.0 vs. 36.9 nmol/g), which persisted at 60 min after dosing (21.9 vs. 32.8 nmol/g). Consistent with our hypothesis, the obligatory anaplerotic metabolite PA decreased meal size, DMI, and total metabolizable energy intake compared with GL, likely because of differences in their hepatic metabolism.
In this study, a novel metabolomics technique based on ultra-performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole-time of flight mass spectrometry in the MS(E) mode was used to investigate the milk metabolomics of healthy, subclinical, and clinical mastitis cows, which were classified based on somatic cell count and presentation of clinical symptoms. Meanwhile, univariate and multivariate statistical analyses were performed to identify the significant differences across the 3 groups. Compared with healthy milk samples, less glucose, d-glycerol-1-phosphate, 4-hydroxyphenyllactate, l-carnitine, sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine, citrate, and hippurate were detected in the clinical mastitic milk samples, whereas less d-glycerol-1-phosphate, benzoic acid, l-carnitine, and cis-aconitate were found in the subclinical mastitic milk samples. Meanwhile, the milk concentration of arginine and Leu-Leu increased in both the clinical and subclinical mastitis groups. Besides, less 4-hydroxyphenyllactate, cis-aconitate, lactose, and oxoglutarate were detected in the clinical than the subclinical mastitic milk samples, whereas the abundance of some oligopeptides (Leu-Ala, Phe-Pro-Ile, Asn-Arg-Ala-Ile, and Val-Phe-Val-Tyr) increased by over 7.95-fold. Our results suggest that significant variations exist across healthy and mastitis cows. The current metabolomics approach will help in better understanding the pathobiology of mastitis, although clinical validation will be required before field application.
Silver nanowires without particles are synthesized by a solvothermal method at temperature 150 °C. Silver nanowires are prepared via a reducing agent of glycerol and a capping agent of polyvinylpyrrolidone (M w  ≈ 1,300,000). Both of them can improve the purity of the as-prepared silver nanowires. With controllable shapes and sizes, silver nanowires are grown continuously up to 10-20 μm in length with 40-50 nm in diameter. To improve the yield of silver nanowires, the different concentrations of AgNO3 synthesis silver nanowires are discussed. The characterizations of the synthesized silver nanowires are analyzed by UV-visible absorption spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and atomic force microscope (AFM), and silver nanowires are pumped on the cellulose membrane and heated stress on the PET. Then, the cellulose membrane is dissolved by the steam of acetone to prepare flexible transparent conducting thin film, which is detected 89.9 of transmittance and 58 Ω/□. Additionally, there is a close loop connected by the thin film, a blue LED, a pair of batteries, and a number of wires, to determinate directly the film if conductive or not.
Recently, we demonstrated that in human intravascular papillary endothelial hyperplasia (IPEH), vein wall vascularization occurs in association with myriad papillae, a large part of which formed in the vascularized vein wall. Previously, using an animal model, we observed that PGE2 and glycerol administration around the femoral vein originates intense vascularization of the vein wall from its intimal endothelial cells (ECs). This vascularization is similar to that in IPEH. The aim of this study is to assess the mechanism of papillary formation, using this model after demonstrating papillary development in neo-vascularized femoral vein walls. In semithin and ultrathin sections, the sequential vascular and papillary development was as follows: a) activation of vein intimal ECs, b) sprouting of intimal ECs towards the vein media layer and microvessel development, c) interconnection between neighboring microvessels originated elementary loops, which encircled vein wall components and formed papillae. The encircling ECs formed the papillary cover, and the encircled component formed the core. The papillae showed a similar structure to that of folds and pillars in intussusceptive angiogenesis, and d) origin of secondary and complex loop systems by interconnection of neighboring elementary loops and by splitting of papillae by new loops, with abundant papillary development. In conclusion, the results support a piecemeal angiogenic mechanism in papillary formation, with association of sprouting and intussusceptive types of angiogenesis. Further studies are needed to assess whether the intravascular papillae described in several pathologic processes, including vessel tumors, such as Dabska's tumor, retiform hemangioendothelioma, and angiosarcoma, follow a similar mechanism.

. Early and accurate assessment of renal function is required for the successful detection and treatment of acute kidney injury (AKI). However, only retention parameters such as plasma urea and creatinine, and the indirect estimation of glomerular filtration rate are commonly available.
Here, we measured the kinetics of plasma fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-sinistrin excretion to detect alterations of renal function over time in a murine model of rhabdomyolysis-induced AKI. The half-life of FITC-sinistrin was evaluated using a transcutaneous device at different time points in conscious mice, from 4 days before renal damage up to 30 days after. Retention markers were also evaluated, in parallel.
Evaluation of the FITC-sinistrin half-life revealed early reduction of renal filtration, observed as early as 6 h after renal damage, and maintained up to 12 h following AKI. Plasma creatinine and urea levels correlated with the transcutaneous measurements of sinistrin excretion. Evaluation of sinistrin excretion also demonstrated that glycerol-treated animals did not develop AKI. Finally, histological analysis showed the presence of renal parenchymal lesions, which developed following the reduced renal filtration and persisted over time, highlighting the causative role of vascular dysfunction and myoglobin toxicity on the subsequent induction of tissue damage.
Taken together, the results of this study provide important insights into the pathophysiology of kidney injury in rhabdomyolytic mice, and indicate that the transcutaneous measurement of FITC-sinistrin is an efficient and simple method to assess renal function precisely. This method also allows reduction of the required number of experimental animals by monitoring the same mouse over time.
The purpose of this study was to investigate whether adding a Chinese herbal hedicine (CHM, including astragalus membranaceus, codonopsis pilosula, poria cocos, bighead atractylodes rhizome, fructus crataegi, folium epimedii, radix saposhnikoviae, and pericarpium citri reticulatae) diet has effects on lipid metabolism in the liver of the broiler. Six-hundred-thirty Hetian broilers were divided into 3 groups including base diet (control), 0.3%, or 1% CHM diets, for 130 days. The results showed that CHM treatment significantly increased the slaughter performance. CHM treatment decreased plasma triglyceride (TG) and nonesterified fatty acid (NEFA) concentrations; up-regulated the expression of peroxisome proliferator activated receptor (PPAR), the transcription factor sterol regulatory element binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c) and its downstream proteins involved in NEFA oxidation including carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1, liver fatty acid binding protein, and PPARα; and it significantly decreased fatty acid synthetase, stearoyl-CoA desaturase, acyl-CoA synthetase long-chain family member 1 and acetyl-CoA carboxylase expression to inhibit NEFA synthesis. In addition, the CHM treatment increased plasma insulin (INS) levels and up-regulated insulin receptors (INSR) glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase and mitochondrial and 1-acylglycerol-3-phosphate O-acyltransferase 6 mRNA expression to enhance TG synthesis. The protein levels of phosphatidylinositol 3-hydroxy kinase (PI3K), serine/threonine protein kinase (Akt), S6 kinase (S6K), phospho-serine/threonine protein kinase (p-Akt), and phospho-S6 kinase (p-S6K) also were increased. PI3K, p-Akt, and p-S6K were significantly up-regulated in the liver. These data suggest that the CHM may be a beneficial compound to decrease plasma NEFA and TG levels by activating the INS/INSR-PI3K-Akt-SREBP1c pathway resulting in fat content reduction in the carcass.
A solid surface commonly forms two wetting modes by alternating the type of the liquids, i.e. wetting and nonwetting. Here we report that a textile can be programmed to exhibit three wetting modes by simply alternating the surface tension of the liquids, they are in turn, wetting, selective wetting and nonwetting. The hidden patterns are prepared via a combination of wet chemical etching and two-step UV-induced thiol-ene click chemistry to graft low-surface-tension thiols and high-surface-tension thiols, respectively, on the textile surface. The as-prepared flexible textiles possess the nonwetting and wetting properties of the high-surface-tension liquids, such as water and glycerol, and the low-surface-tension liquids, such as decane and ethanol, respectively. Furthermore, the selective wetting behavior can be revealed only if the surface tension of the liquids is within a narrow range of approximately 44.8 mN m(-1) to 28.1 mN m(-1), such as N,N-dimethylformamide and acetonitrile. In addition, the as-patterned textiles demonstrated high mechanical and chemical stability with long-term and repeated usage, which implies their high potential to act as novel encoded information carrier materials for flexible and textile-based devices.
Here, we demonstrate that self-assembly of poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) at the air-water interface can lead to free-standing films of densely packed P3HT nanowires. Interfacial self-assembly on various liquid subphases such as water, diethylene glycol, and glycerol indicates that the viscosity of the subphase is an important factor for the formation of well-ordered nanostructures. The thin film morphology was also sensitive to the concentration of P3HT, their molecular weight (MW), and the presence of oxidative defects. The densely-packed nanowire films can be easily transferred to solid substrates for device applications. The ultrathin films of P3HT prepared by the interfacial assembly showed significantly higher hole mobility (~3.6×10-2 cm2/V·s) in a field effect transistor (FET) than comparably-thin spin-cast films. This work demonstrates that air-liquid interfacial assembly is not limited to amphiphilic polymers and can, under optimized conditions, be applied to fabricate ultrathin films of widely-used conjugated polymers with controlled morphologies.
The intestinal microbiota contributes to the metabolism of its host. Adequate identification of the microbiota's impact on the host plasma metabolites is lacking. As antibiotics have a profound effect on the microbial composition and hence on the mammalian-microbiota co-metabolism, we studied the effects of antibiotics on the "functionality of the microbiome"-defined as the production of metabolites absorbed by the host. This metabolomics study presents insights into the mammalian-microbiome co-metabolism of endogenous metabolites. To identify plasma metabolites related to microbiome changes due to antibiotic treatment, we have applied broad-spectrum antibiotics belonging to the class of aminoglycosides (neomycin, gentamicin), fluoroquinolones (moxifloxacin, levofloxacin) and tetracyclines (doxycycline, tetracycline). These were administered orally for 28 days to male rats including blood sampling for metabolic profiling after 7, 14 and 28 days. Fluoroquinolones and tetracyclines can be absorbed from the gut; whereas, aminoglycosides are poorly absorbed. Hippuric acid, indole-3-acetic acid and glycerol were identified as key metabolites affected by antibiotic treatment, beside changes mainly concerning amino acids and carbohydrates. Inter alia, effects on indole-3-propionic acid were found to be unique for aminoglycosides, and on 3-indoxylsulfate for tetracyclines. For each class of antibiotics, specific metabolome patterns could be established in the MetaMap®Tox data base, which contains metabolome data for more than 550 reference compounds. The results suggest that plasma-based metabolic profiling (metabolomics) could be a suitable tool to investigate the effect of antibiotics on the functionality of the microbiome and to obtain insight into the mammalian-microbiome co-metabolism.
Electrospun micro- and nanofibrous poly(glycerol sebacate)-poly(ε-caprolactone) (PGS-PCL) substrates have been extensively used as scaffolds for engineered tissues due to their desirable mechanical properties and their tunable degradability. In this study, we fabricated micro/nanofibrous scaffolds from a PGS-PCL composite using a standard electrospinning approach and then coated them with silver (Ag) using a custom radio frequency (RF) sputtering method. The Ag coating formed an electrically conductive layer around the fibers and decreased the pore size. The thickness of the Ag coating could be controlled, thereby tailoring the conductivity of the substrate. The flexible, stretchable patches formed excellent conformal contact with surrounding tissues and possessed excellent pattern-substrate fidelity. In vitro studies confirmed the platform's biocompatibility and biodegradability. Finally, the potential controlled release of the Ag coating from the composite fibrous scaffolds could be beneficial for many clinical applications.
Full activation of T cells and differentiation into effector T cells are essential for many immune responses and require co-stimulatory signaling via the CD28 receptor. Extracellular ligand binding to CD28 recruits protein-tyrosine kinases to its cytoplasmic tail, which contains a YMNM motif. Following phosphorylation of the tyrosine, the proteins growth factor receptor-bound protein 2 (Grb2), Grb2-related adaptor downstream of Shc (Gads), and p85 subunit of phosphoinositide 3-kinase may bind to pYMNM (where pY is phosphotyrosine) via their Src homology 2 (SH2) domains, leading to downstream signaling to distinct immune pathways. These three adaptor proteins bind to the same site on CD28 with variable affinity, and all are important for CD28-mediated co-stimulatory function. However, the mechanism of how these proteins recognize and compete for CD28 is unclear. To visualize their interactions with CD28, we have determined the crystal structures of Gads SH2 and two p85 SH2 domains in complex with a CD28-derived phosphopeptide. The high resolution structures obtained revealed that, whereas the CD28 phosphopeptide bound to Gads SH2 is in a bent conformation similar to that when bound to Grb2 SH2, it adopts a more extended conformation when bound to the N- and C-terminal SH2 domains of p85. These differences observed in the peptide-protein interactions correlated well with the affinity and other thermodynamic parameters for each interaction determined by isothermal titration calorimetry. The detailed insight into these interactions reported here may inform the development of compounds that specifically inhibit the association of CD28 with these adaptor proteins to suppress excessive T cell responses, such as in allergies and autoimmune diseases.
Prostate cancer is the most prominent cancer in men, experiencing a relapse in disease often express high serum TNF-α levels. It has been correlated with increased cell survival and proliferation of prostate cancer cells. Previous studies reported that nimbolide, a terpenoid derived from the leaves and flowers of neem tree inhibits cancer growth through selective modulation of cell signaling pathways linked to inflammation, survival, proliferation, angiogenesis and metastasis.
The present study aimed to examine the effect of nimbolide at 1 and 2μM concentrations on TNF-α/TNFR1 mediated signaling molecules involved in cell survival and proliferation in PC-3 cell line via NF-κB and MAPK pathways by real time PCR and western blot. Protein and compound interaction were performed by Molecular docking analysis.
Our results indicate that nimbolide treatment suppressed expression of TNF-α, SODD, Grb2, SOS mRNA and modulated TNF-α/TNFR1 regulated NF-κB and MAPK signaling molecules in PC-3 cells. Additional molecular dynamics simulation studies confirmed the stability of nimbolide and signaling molecules binding interactions. Binding pose analysis revealed the significance of hydrogen bond interactions for effective stabilization of virtual ligand protein complexes.
Nimbolide inhibited prostate cancer cell survival and proliferation via NF-κB and MAPK pathways.
We report the design, construction, and validation of a highly diverse phage-displayed naïve ubiquitin variant (Ubv) library. We first conducted a mutation tolerance scan of 27 residues and confirmed that 24 of these could be substituted by chemically diverse amino acids without compromising the display of Ubvs on phage. Subsequently, we constructed a library containing 6.8×10(10) unique members, in which these 24 positions were diversified with a degenerate codon that encodes for 6 aa that are prevalent in protein interaction sites. To ensure the optimal structural stability of the Ubvs, we constructed the library in a two-step process, whereby 12 positions were randomized first, and following the selection for displayed Ubvs, the resulting pool was further diversified at the other 12 positions. The resulting library was validated by conducting binding selections against a panel of 40 diverse protein antigens and was found to be as functional as a highly validated synthetic antibody library, yielding binders against 30 of the antigens. Detailed characterization of an Ubv that bound to the cell-surface receptor human epidermal growth factor receptor 3 revealed tight binding in the single-digit nanomolar range. Moreover, Ubvs that bound to two distinct sites on the intracellular adapter Grb2 could be combined to generate a potent inhibitor that functioned in cells. These results validate ubiquitin as a robust scaffold for the construction of naïve libraries that can be used to generate Ubvs that target signaling networks both outside and inside the cells.
Grb2-associated binder (Gab) docking proteins regulate signals downstream of a variety of growth factors and receptor tyrosine kinases. Neuregulin-1 (NRG-1), a member of epidermal growth factor family, plays a critical role for cardiomyocyte proliferation and prevention of heart failure via ErbB receptors. We previously reported that Gab1 and Gab2 in the myocardium are essential for maintenance of myocardial function in the postnatal heart via transmission of NRG-1/ErbB-signaling through analysis of Gab1/Gab2 cardiomyocyte-specific double knockout mice. In that study, we also found that there is an unknown high-molecular weight (high-MW) Gab1 isoform (120 kDa) expressed exclusively in the heart, in addition to the ubiquitously expressed low-MW (100 kDa) Gab1. However, the high-MW Gab1 has been molecularly ill-defined to date. Here, we identified the high-MW Gab1 as a striated muscle-specific isoform. The high-MW Gab1 has an extra exon encoding 27 amino acid residues between the already-known 3rd and 4th exons of the ubiquitously expressed low-MW Gab1. Expression analysis by RT-PCR and immunostaining with the antibody specific for the high-MW Gab1 demonstrate that the high-MW Gab1 isoform is exclusively expressed in striated muscle including heart and skeletal muscle. The ratio of high-MW Gab1/ total Gab1 mRNAs increased along with heart development. The high-MW Gab1 isoform in heart underwent tyrosine-phosphorylation exclusively after intravenous administration of NRG-1, among several growth factors. Adenovirus-mediated overexpression of the high-MW Gab1 induces more sustained activation of AKT after stimulation with NRG-1 in cardiomyocytes compared with that of β-galactosidase. On the contrary, siRNA-mediated knockdown of the high-MW Gab1 significantly attenuated AKT activation after stimulation with NRG-1 in cardiomyocytes. Taken together, these findings suggest that the striated muscle-specific high-MW isoform of Gab1 has a crucial role for NRG-1/ErbB signaling in cardiomyocytes.
GRB2-associated-binding protein 1 (Gab1) belongs to Gab adaptor family, which integrates multiple signals in response to the epithelial growth factors. Recent genetic studies identified genetic variants of human Gab1 gene as potential risk factors of asthmatic inflammation. However, the functions of Gab1 in lungs remain largely unknown. Alveolar type-II cells (AT-IIs) are responsible for surfactant homeostasis and essentially regulate lung inflammation following various injuries (3). In this study, in vitro knockdown of Gab1 was shown to decrease the surfactant proteins (SPs) levels in AT-IIs. We further examined in vivo Gab1 functions through alveolar epithelium-specific Gab1 knockout mice (Gab1(Δ/Δ)). In vivo Gab1 deficiency leads to a decrease in SP synthesis and the appearance of disorganized lamellar bodies. Histological analysis of the lung sections in Gab1(Δ/Δ) mice shows no apparent pathological alterations or inflammation. However, Gab1(Δ/Δ) mice demonstrate inflammatory responses during the LPS-induced acute lung injury. Similarly, in mice challenged with bleomycin, fibrotic lesions were found to be aggravated in Gab1(Δ/Δ) These observations suggest that the abolishment of Gab1 in AT-IIs impairs SP homeostasis, predisposing mice to lung injuries. In addition, we observed that the production of surfactants in AT-IIs overexpressing Gab1 mutants, in which Shp2 phosphatase and PI3K kinase binding sites have been mutated (Gab1(ΔShp2), Gab1(ΔPI3K)), has been considerably attenuated. Together, these findings provide the direct evidence about the roles of docking protein Gab1 in lungs, adding to our understanding of acute and interstitial lung diseases caused by the disruption of alveolar SP homeostasis.
Lung cancer is the top cancer killer worldwide with high mortality rate. Majority belong to non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLCs). The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) has been broadly explored as a drug target for therapy. However, the drug responses are not durable due to the acquired resistance. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding and endogenous molecules that can inhibit mRNA translation initiation and degrade mRNAs. We wonder if some downstream molecules shared by EGFR and the other tyrosine kinase receptors (TKRs) further transduce the signals alternatively, and some miRNAs play the key roles in affecting the expression of these downstream molecules. In this study, we investigated the mRNA:miRNA associations for the direct EGFR downstream molecules in the EGFR signaling pathway shared with the other TKRs, including c-MET (hepatocyte growth factor receptor), Ron (a protein tyrosine kinase related to c-MET), PDGFR (platelet-derived growth factor receptor), and IGF-1R (insulin-like growth factor receptor-1). The multiple linear regression and support vector regression (SVR) models were used to discover the statistically significant and the best weighted miRNAs regulating the mRNAs of these downstream molecules. These two models revealed the similar mRNA:miRNA associations. It was found that the miRNAs significantly affecting the mRNA expressions in the multiple regression model were also those with the largest weights in the SVR model. To conclude, we effectively identified a list of meaningful mRNA:miRNA associations: phospholipase C, gamma 1 (PLCG1) with miR-34a, phosphoinositide-3-kinase, regulatory subunit 2 (PIK3R2) with miR-30a-5p, growth factor receptor-bound protein 2 (GRB2) with miR-27a, and Janus kinase 1 (JAK1) with miR-302b and miR-520e. These associations could make great contributions to explore new mechanism in NSCLCs. These candidate miRNAs may be regarded as the potential drug targets for treating NSCLCs with acquired drug resistance.
Multidrug resistance is one of the major reasons colorectal cancer (CRC) chemotherapy-based treatments fail, and novel biologically based therapies are urgently needed. Src homology 3 (SH3)-domain GRB2-like protein 1 (SH3GL1) is a membrane-bound protein which was found to be involved in tumor formation, progression, and metastasis. In this study, immunohistochemistry staining, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), and western blot analysis revealed a high expression of SH3GL1 in human CRC tumor specimens and several CRC cells resistant to chemotherapeutics. Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay showed that transfection of pCDNA3.1(+)-SH3GL1 increased while transfection of SH3GL1 siRNA decreased cell viability in response to 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) treatment (P &lt; 0.05). Further studies indicated that transfection of SH3GL1 siRNA significantly downregulated multidrug resistance protein 1 (MDR1)/P-glycoprotein expression (P &lt; 0.05), decreased MDR1 promoter activity and activator protein-1 (AP-1) binding activity (P &lt; 0.05), and inhibited the activation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2 (ERK1/2) signaling (P &lt; 0.05) in CRC cells resistant to chemotherapeutics. Transfection of pCDNA3.1(+)-SH3GL1 caused the opposite effect. Additionally, pre-treatment with either EGFR kinase inhibitor PD153035 or ERK1/2 kinase inhibitor PD98059 in HCT116/5-FU cells partly inhibits P-glycoprotein expression and AP-1 binding activity (P &lt; 0.05). In conclusion, we confirmed that inhibition of SH3GL1 reverses multidrug resistance through declining P-glycoprotein expression via the EGFR/ERK/AP-1 pathway.
Grb2-associated binding protein 2 (GAB2), a key member of the family of Gab scaffolding adaptors, is important in the phospoinositide3-kinase (PI3K) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling pathways, and is closely associated with cell proliferation, cell transformation, and tumor progression. But its role in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is still unknown. In this study, we investigated the expression of GAB2 and its potential clinical and biological significances in HCC. Western bolt and immunohistochemistrical analyses revealed that GAB2 was obviously upregulated in HCC tissues. Meanwhile, GAB2 was significantly associated with histological grade, tumor size, and the proliferation marker Ki-67 through our further analysis. The Kaplan-Meier survival curves also showed that increased GAB2 expression was directly correlated with poor prognosis in HCC patients and served as an independent prognostic marker of overall survival. Moreover, serum starvation-refeeding, RNA interference, CCK-8, EDU, colony formation, and flow-cytometry analyses were all performed with the purpose of investigating GAB2's regulation of HCC cell proliferation. Our results indicated that GAB2 progressively accumulated when cells entered into S phase. Consistently, cell proliferation was distinctly hindered by small interfering RNA. More interestingly, we discovered that GAB2 promoted cell proliferation by enhancing ERK signaling and GAB2-induced cell proliferation was inhibited by the inhibition of ERK activation. Finally, GAB2 was verified to be able to confer doxorubicin resistance in HCC cells. In summary, these data demonstrated that GAB2 might promote HCC cell proliferation by enhancing ERK signaling, and all above findings provided a potential therapeutic strategy for the treatment of HCC.
Plants have evolved effective mechanisms to avoid or reduce the potential damage caused by abiotic stresses. In addition to biocontrol abilities, Trichoderma genus fungi promote growth and alleviate the adverse effects caused by saline stress in plants. Morphological, physiological, and molecular changes were analyzed in salt-stressed tomato plants grown under greenhouse conditions in order to investigate the effects of chemical and biological fertilizations. The application of Trichoderma harzianum T34 to tomato seeds had very positive effects on plant growth, independently of chemical fertilization. The application of salt stress significantly changed the parameters related to growth and gas-exchange rates in tomato plants subject to chemical fertilization. However, the gas-exchange parameters were not affected in unfertilized plants under the same moderate saline stress. The combined application of T34 and salt significantly reduced the fresh and dry weights of NPK-fertilized plants, while the opposite effects were detected when no chemical fertilization was applied. Decaying symptoms were observed in salt-stressed and chemically fertilized plants previously treated with T34. This damaged phenotype was linked to significantly higher intercellular CO2 and slight increases in stomatal conductance and transpiration, and to the deregulation of phytohormone networking in terms of significantly lower expression levels of the salt overlay sensitivity 1 (SOS1) gene, and the genes involved in signaling abscisic acid-, ethylene-, and salicylic acid-dependent pathways and ROS production, in comparison with those observed in salt-challenged NPK-fertilized plants.
Ethylene biosynthesis and the ethylene signaling pathway regulate plant salt tolerance by activating the expression of downstream target genes such as those related to ROS and Na(+)/K(+) homeostasis. The Salt Overly Sensitive (SOS) pathway regulates Na(+)/K(+) homeostasis in Arabidopsis under salt stress. However, the connection between these two pathways is unclear. Through genetic screening, we identified two sos2 alleles as salt sensitive mutants in the ein3-1 background. Neither Ethylene-Insensitive 2 (EIN2) nor EIN3 changed the expression patterns of SOS genes including SOS1, SOS2, SOS3 and SOS3-like Calcium Binding Protein 8 (SCaBP8), but SOS2 activated the expression of one target gene of EIN3, Ethylene and Salt-inducible ERF 1 (ESE1). Moreover, Ser/Thr protein kinase SOS2 phosphorylated EIN3 in vitro mainly at the S325 site and weakly at the S35, T42 and S606 sites. EIN3 S325A mutation reduced its transcriptional activating activity on ESE1 promoter:GUS in a transient GUS assay, and impaired its ability to rescue ein3-1 salt hypersensitivity. Furthermore, SOS2 activated salt-responsive ESE1 target gene expression under salt stress. Therefore, EIN3-SOS2 might link the ethylene signaling pathway and the SOS pathway in Arabidopsis salt responses.
Reinstating wild-type tumor suppressor p53 activity could be a valuable option for the treatment of cancer. To contribute to development of new treatment options for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), we performed genome-wide siRNA screens for determinants of p53 activity in NSCLC cells. We identified many genes not previously known to be involved in regulating p53 activity. Silencing p53 pathway inhibitor genes was associated with loss of cell viability. The largest functional gene cluster influencing p53 activity was mRNA splicing. Prominent p53 activation was observed upon silencing of specific spliceosome components, rather than by general inhibition of the spliceosome. Ten genes were validated as inhibitors of p53 activity in multiple NSCLC cell lines: genes encoding the Ras-pathway activator SOS1, the zinc finger protein TSHZ3, the mitochondrial membrane protein COX16 and the spliceosome components SNRPD3, SF3A3, SF3B1, SF3B6, XAB2, CWC22 and HNRNPL. Silencing these genes generally increased p53 levels, with distinct effects on CDKN1A expression, induction of cell cycle arrest and cell death. Silencing spliceosome components was associated with alternative splicing of MDM4 mRNA, which could contribute to activation of p53. In addition, silencing splice factors was particularly effective in killing NSCLC cells, albeit in a p53-independent manner. Interestingly, silencing SNRPD3 and SF3A3 exerted much stronger cytotoxicity to NSCLC cells than to lung fibroblasts, suggesting that these genes could represent useful therapeutic targets.

The PBE-QIDH and SOS1-PBE-QIDH double-hybrid density functionals are merged with a pair of dispersion corrections, namely the pairwise additive D3(BJ) and the non-local correlation functional VV10, leading to the corresponding dispersion-corrected models. The parameters adjusting each of the dispersion corrections to the functionals are obtained by fitting to well-established energy datasets (e.g. S130) used as a benchmark, giving rise to functionals spanning covalent and non-covalent binding forces. The application of the models to challenging systems out of the training set, like those comprising the L7 database of large supramolecular complexes, or the S66x8 dataset of stretched and elongated intermolecular distances, reveals the high accuracy of the coupling.
A human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cell (MSCs) and cord blood-derived CD34+ stem cell co-culture system was set up in order to evaluate the proliferative and differentiative effects induced by MSCs on CD34+ stem cells, and the reciprocal influences on gene expression profiles. After 10 days of co-culture, non-adherent (SN-fraction) and adherent (AD-fraction) CD34+ stem cells were collected and analysed separately. In the presence of MSCs, a significant increase in CD34+ cell number was observed (fold increase = 14.68), mostly in the SN-fraction (fold increase = 13.20). This was combined with a significant increase in CD34+ cell differentiation towards the BFU-E colonies and with a decrease in the CFU-GM. These observations were confirmed by microarray analysis. Through gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA), we noted a significant enrichment in genes involved in heme metabolism (e.g. LAMP2, CLCN3, BMP2K), mitotic spindle formation and proliferation (e.g. PALLD, SOS1, CCNA1) and TGF-beta signalling (e.g. ID1) and a down-modulation of genes participating in myeloid and lymphoid differentiation (e.g. PCGF2) in the co-cultured CD34+ stem cells. On the other hand, a significant enrichment in genes involved in oxygen-level response (e.g. TNFAIP3, SLC2A3, KLF6) and angiogenesis (e.g. VEGFA, IGF1, ID1) was found in the co-cultured MSCs. Taken together, our results suggest that MSCs can exert a priming effect on CD34+ stem cells, regulating their proliferation and erythroid differentiation. In turn, CD34+ stem cells seem to be able to polarise the BM-niche towards the vascular compartment by modulating molecular pathways related to hypoxia and angiogenesis.
Twelve alfalfa genotypes that were selected for biomass under salinity, differences in Na and Cl concentrations in shoots and K/Na ratio were evaluated in this long-term salinity experiment. The selected plants were cloned to reduce genetic variability within each genotype. Salt tolerance (ST) index of the genotypes ranged from 0.39 to 1. The most salt-tolerant genotypes SISA14-1 (G03) and AZ-90ST (G10), the top performers for biomass, exhibited the least effect on shoot number and height. SISA14-1 (G03) accumulated low Na and Cl under salinity. Most genotypes exhibited a net reduction in shoot Ca, Mg, P, Fe, and Cu, while Mn and Zn increased under salinity. Salinity reduced foliar area and stomatal conductance; while net photosynthetic rate and transpiration were not affected. Interestingly, salinity increased chlorophyll and antioxidant capacity in most genotypes; however neither parameter correlated well to ST index. Salt-tolerant genotypes showed upregulation of the SOS1, SOS2, SOS3, HKT1, AKT1, NHX1, P5CS1, HSP90.7, HSP81.2, HSP71.1, HSPC025, OTS1, SGF29 and SAL1 genes. Gene expression analyses allowed us to classify genotypes based on their ability to regulate different components of the salt tolerance mechanism. Pyramiding different components of the salt tolerance mechanism may lead to superior salt-tolerant alfalfa genotypes.
Plant peroxisomes maintain a plethora of key life processes including fatty acid β-oxidation, photorespiration, synthesis of hormones, and homeostasis of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Abundance of peroxisomes in cells is dynamic; however mechanisms controlling peroxisome proliferation remain poorly understood because measuring peroxisome abundance is technically challenging. Counting peroxisomes in individual cells of complex organs by electron or fluorescence microscopy is expensive and time consuming. Here we present a simple technique for quantifying peroxisome abundance using the small probe Nitro-BODIPY, which in vivo fluoresces selectively inside peroxisomes. The physiological relevance of our technique was demonstrated using salinity as a known inducer of peroxisome proliferation. While significant peroxisome proliferation was observed in wild-type Arabidopsis leaves following 5-hour exposure to NaCl, no proliferation was detected in the salt-susceptible mutants fry1-6, sos1-14, and sos1-15. We also found that N-BODIPY detects aggregation of peroxisomes during final stages of programmed cell death and can be used as a marker of this stage. Furthermore, accumulation of peroxisomes in an autophagy-deficient Arabidopsis mutant atg5 correlated with N-BODIPY labeling. In conclusion, the technique reported here enables quantification of peroxisomes in plant material at various physiological settings. Its potential applications encompass identification of genes controlling peroxisome homeostasis and capturing stress-tolerant genotypes.
Small GTPases regulate many key cellular processes and their role in human disease validates many proteins in this class as desirable targets for therapeutic intervention. Reliable recombinant production of GTPases, often in the active GTP loaded state, is a prerequisite for the prosecution of drug discovery efforts. The preparation of these active forms can be complex and often constricts the supply to the reagent intensive techniques used in structure base drug discovery. We have established a fully automated, multidimensional protein purification strategy for the parallel production of the catalytic G-domains of KRas, Rac1 and RalB GTPases in the active form. This method incorporates a four step chromatography purification with TEV protease-mediated affinity tag cleavage and a conditioning step that achieves the activation of the GTPase by exchanging GDP for the non-hydrolyzable GTP analogue GMPPnP. We also demonstrate that an automated method is efficient at loading of KRas with mantGDP for application in a SOS1 catalysed fluorescent nucleotide exchange assay. In comparison to more conventional manual workflows the automated method offers marked advantages in method run time and operator workload. This reduces the bottleneck in protein production while generating products that are highly purified and effectively loaded with nucleotide analogues.
In the mouse cerebellum, Ca(2+)-dependent activator protein for secretion 2 (CADPS2, CAPS2) is involved in regulated secretion from dense-core vesicles (DCVs), which contain neuropeptides including brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and neurotrophin-3 (NT-3). Capds2 knockout (KO) mice show impaired cerebellar development in addition to autistic-like behavioral phenotypes. To understand the molecular impact caused by loss of Capds2, we analyzed gene expression profiles in the Capds2 KO cerebellum using a GeneChip microarray and the KEGG Pathway database. Significant differential expression was observed in 1211 of 22,690 (5.34%) genes represented on the chip. The expression levels of exocytosis-related genes (Stx5a, Syt6), genes encoding secretory (Fgf2, Fgf4, Edn2) and synaptic proteins (Grin2b, Gabbr1), neurotrophin signaling-associated genes (Sos1, Shc1, Traf6, Psen2), and a gene for Rett syndrome (Mecp2) were significantly changed. Taken together, these results suggest that deregulated gene expression caused by loss of Capds2 may cause developmental deficits and/or pathological symptoms, resulting in autistic-like phenotypes.
It is known that T lymphocytes are activated in human abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs). γδT cells, as a subset of T cells, play a role in many inflammation-related diseases. However, whether γδT cells participate in the formation of AAA remains unknown. In this study, we explored the role of γδT cells in AAA lesions.
Using the porcine pancreatic elastase-induced AAA model, we found that knock out of γδT cells significantly attenuated AAA formation. To elucidate how γδT cells contribute to AAA, microarray analysis was performed, which found that the phosphoinositide 3-kinase/AKT signaling pathway was activated in elastase-perfused γδT knockout (γδT KO) mice. By studying differentially expressed genes involved in phosphoinositide 3-kinase signaling, we found that proliferation-related genes (Sos1, Mtor, Myc) were upregulated whereas apoptosis-related genes (Pten, Bcl1, Bad) were downregulated in elastase-perfused γδT KO mice. Furthermore, histopathologic analysis showed increased PCNA(+) and decreased TUNEL(+) cells in elastase-perfused γδT KO mice compared with wild-type mice. In addition, inflammatory cytokines including interleukin-1β, Mcp-1, and tumor necrosis factor-α were downregulated in the aneurysm tissues of elastase-perfused γδT KO mice.
These data reveal a pathogenic role of γδT cells in the experimental AAA model, likely through mechanisms regulating cell proliferation and mediating inflammatory response. Thus, targeting of γδT cells may offer a potential therapeutic method for aortic aneurysms.
We have shown previously that the durum wheat TdSOS1 excludes Na(+) and Li(+) ions outside cells. Moreover, this protein is activated by Arabidopsis kinase SOS2 through phosphorylation. The elimination of both SOS2 phosphorylation sites and the auto-inhibitory domain produces a hyperactive TdSOS1∆972 form, which have a maximal activity independent from the regulatory SOS2/SOS3 complex. We demonstrated that the expression of TdSOS1 enhances salt tolerance of the transgenic Arabidopsis plants. In this study, we analyzed the response to H2O2-induced oxidative stress of the transgenic Arabidopsis expressing one of the two TdSOS1 forms. Firstly, we showed that the exogenous H2O2 treatment leads to an accumulation of SOS1 transcripts in leaves and roots of the durum wheat and also in the transgenic plants. These transgenic plants showed significant oxidative stress tolerance compared to control plants, especially the plants expressing the hyperactive form. This tolerance was manifested by high proline accumulation and low malonyldialdehyde (MDA), O2˙(-) and H2O2 contents. Furthermore, the activities of three essential ROS scavenging enzymes (SOD, CAT, and POD) were higher in the transgenic plants under oxidative stress, as compared to control plants. Taken together, these data suggested that TdSOS1 plays a crucial role in response to oxidative stress.
Hypoplastic right heart syndrome (HRHS) is a rare congenital defect characterized by underdevelopment of the right heart structures commonly accompanied by an atrial septal defect. Familial HRHS reports suggest genetic factor involvement. We examined the role of copy number variants (CNVs) in HRHS.
We genotyped 32 HRHS cases identified from all New York State live births (1998-2005) using Illumina HumanOmni2.5 microarrays. CNVs were called with PennCNV and prioritized if they were ≥20 Kb, contained ≥10 SNPs and had minimal overlap with CNVs from in-house controls, the Database of Genomic Variants, HapMap3, and Childrens Hospital of Philadelphia database.
We identified 28 CNVs in 17 cases; several encompassed genes important for right heart development. One case had a 2p16-2p23 duplication spanning LBH, a limb and heart development transcription factor. Lbh mis-expression results in right ventricular hypoplasia and pulmonary valve defects. This duplication also encompassed SOS1, a factor associated with pulmonary valve stenosis in Noonan syndrome. Sos1(-/-) mice display thin and poorly trabeculated ventricles. In another case, we identified a 1.5 Mb deletion associated with Williams-Beuren syndrome, a disorder that includes valvular malformations. A third case had a 24 Kb deletion upstream of the TGFβ ligand ITGB8. Embryos genetically null for Itgb8, and its intracellular interactant Band 4.1B, display lethal cardiac phenotypes.
To our knowledge, this is the first study of CNVs in HRHS. We identified several rare CNVs that overlap genes related to right ventricular wall and valve development, suggesting that genetics plays a role in HRHS and providing clues for further investigation.

Novel APOBEC1 target 1 (Nat1) (also known as "p97," "Dap5," and "Eif4g2") is a ubiquitously expressed cytoplasmic protein that is homologous to the C-terminal two thirds of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4G (Eif4g1). We previously showed that Nat1-null mouse embryonic stem cells (mES cells) are resistant to differentiation. In the current study, we found that NAT1 and eIF4G1 share many binding proteins, such as the eukaryotic translation initiation factors eIF3 and eIF4A and ribosomal proteins. However, NAT1 did not bind to eIF4E or poly(A)-binding proteins, which are critical for cap-dependent translation initiation. In contrast, compared with eIF4G1, NAT1 preferentially interacted with eIF2, fragile X mental retardation proteins (FMR), and related proteins and especially with members of the proline-rich and coiled-coil-containing protein 2 (PRRC2) family. We also found that Nat1-null mES cells possess a transcriptional profile similar, although not identical, to the ground state, which is established in wild-type mES cells when treated with inhibitors of the ERK and glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) signaling pathways. In Nat1-null mES cells, the ERK pathway is suppressed even without inhibitors. Ribosome profiling revealed that translation of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase 3 (Map3k3) and son of sevenless homolog 1 (Sos1) is suppressed in the absence of Nat1 Forced expression of Map3k3 induced differentiation of Nat1-null mES cells. These data collectively show that Nat1 is involved in the translation of proteins that are required for cell differentiation.
JAK-dependent activation of the rho module of integrin affinity triggering mediates chemokine-induced leukocyte adhesion. However, the signaling events linking JAKs to rho small GTPase activation by chemokines is still incompletely described. In this study, we show that son of sevenless 1 (SOS1), rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF)1 (ARHGEF1), and dedicator of cytokinesis (DOCK)2 GEFs mediate CXCL12-induced LFA-1 activation in human primary T lymphocytes. Downregulated expression of SOS1, ARHGEF1, and DOCK2 impairs LFA-1-mediated rapid T lymphocyte adhesion as well as underflow arrest on ICAM-1 induced by CXCL12. Moreover, LFA-1 affinity triggering by CXCL12 is impaired by SOS1, ARHGEF1, and DOCK2 downregulation. Notably, the three GEFs are all critically involved in chemokine-induced RhoA and Rac1 activation, thus suggesting the occurrence of a SOS1 specificity shift in the context of chemokine signaling. Accordingly, SOS1, ARHGEF1, and DOCK2 are tyrosine phosphorylated upon chemokine signaling with timing coherent with rapid LFA-1 affinity activation. Importantly, chemokine-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of these GEFs is fully mediated by JAK protein tyrosine kinases. Unexpectedly, and differently from VAV1, tyrosine phosphorylation of SOS1, ARHGEF1, and DOCK2 is completely inhibited by pertussis toxin pretreatment, thus suggesting different routes of rho-GEF triggering upon CXCR4 engagement. Taken together, these findings reveal a deeper level of complexity in the rho-signaling module, with at least four different rho-GEFs cooperating in the regulation of chemokine-induced integrin activation, possibly suggesting the emergence of stochastic concurrency in signaling mechanisms controlling leukocyte trafficking.
Wheat SOS1 (TaSOS1) activity could be relieved upon deletion of the C-terminal 168 residues (the auto-inhibitory domain). This truncated form of wheat SOS1 (TaSOS1-974) was shown to increase compensation (compared to wild-type TaSOS1) for the salt sensitivity of a yeast mutant strain, AXT3K, via increased Na(+) transportation out of cells during salinity stress. Expression of the plasma membrane proteins TaSOS1-974 or TaSOS1 improved the growth of transgenic tobacco plants compared with wild-type plants under normal conditions. However, plants expressing TaSOS1-974 grew better than TaSOS1-transformed plants. Upon salinity stress, Na(+) efflux and K(+) influx rates in the roots of transgenic plants expressing TaSOS1-974 or TaSOS1 were greater than those of wild-type plants. Furthermore, compared to TaSOS1-transgenic plants, TaSOS1-974-expressing roots showed faster Na(+) efflux and K(+) influx, resulting in less Na(+) and more K(+) accumulation in TaSOS1-974-transgenic plants compared to TaSOS1-transgenic and wild-type plants. TaSOS1-974-expressing plants had the lowest MDA content and electrolyte leakage among all tested plants, indicating that TaSOS1-974 might protect the plasma membrane against oxidative damage generated by salt stress. Overall, TaSOS1-974 conferred higher salt tolerance in transgenic plants compared to TaSOS1. Consistent with this result, transgenic plants expressing TaSOS1-974 showed a better growth performance than TaSOS1-expressing and wild-type plants under saline conditions.
A comparative study was performed to analyze the effect of cold acclimation on improving the resistance of Arabidopsis thaliana, Eutrema salsugineum and Eutrema botschantzevii plants to salt stress. Shoot FW, sodium and potassium accumulation, metabolite content, expression of proton pump genes VAB1, VAB2,VAB3, VP2, HA3 and genes encoding ion transporters SOS1, HKT1, NHX1, NHX2, NHX5 located in the plasma membrane or tonoplast were determined just after the cold treatment and the onset of the salt stress. In the same cold-acclimated E. botschantzevii plants, the Na(+) concentration after salt treatment was around 80% lower than in non-acclimated plants, whereas the K(+) concentration was higher. As a result of cold acclimation, the expression of, VAB3, NHX2, NHX5 genes and of SOS1, VP2, HA3 genes was strongly enhanced in E. botschantzevii and in E. salsugineum plants correspondently. None of the 10 genes analyzed showed any expression change in A. thaliana plants after cold acclimation. Altogether, the results indicate that cold-induced adaptation to subsequent salt stress exists in the extremophytes E. botschantzevii and to a lesser extend in E. salsugineum and is absent in Arabidopsis. This phenomenon may be attributed to the increased expression of ion transporter genes during cold acclimation in the Eutrema species.
Ras pathway signaling plays a critical role in cell growth control and is often upregulated in human cancer. The Raf kinases selectively interact with GTP-bound Ras and are important effectors of Ras signaling, functioning as the initiating kinases in the ERK cascade. Here, we identify a route for the phospho-inhibition of Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway signaling that is mediated by the stress-activated JNK cascade. We find that key Ras pathway components, the RasGEF Sos1 and the Rafs, are phosphorylated on multiple S/TP sites in response to JNK activation and that the hyperphosphorylation of these sites renders the Rafs and Sos1 unresponsive to upstream signals. This phospho-regulatory circuit is engaged by cancer therapeutics, such as rigosertib and paclitaxel/Taxol, that activate JNK through mitotic and oxidative stress as well as by physiological regulators of the JNK cascade and may function as a signaling checkpoint to suppress the Ras pathway during conditions of cellular stress.
Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) is an enzyme consisting of three subunits: a scaffolding A subunit, a regulatory B subunit and a catalytic C subunit. PP2As were shown to play diverse roles in eukaryotes. In this study, the function of the Arabidopsis PP2A-C5 gene that encodes the catalytic subunit 5 of PP2A was studied using both loss-of-function and gain-of-function analyses. Loss-of-function mutant pp2a-c5-1 displayed more impaired growth during root and shoot development, whereas overexpression of PP2A-C5 conferred better root and shoot growth under different salt treatments, indicating that PP2A-C5 plays an important role in plant growth under salt conditions. Double knockout mutants of pp2a-c5-1 and salt overly sensitive (sos) mutants sos1-1, sos2-2 or sos3-1 showed additive sensitivity to NaCl, indicating that PP2A-C5 functions in a pathway different from the SOS signalling pathway. Using yeast two-hybrid analysis, four vacuolar membrane chloride channel (CLC) proteins, AtCLCa, AtCLCb, AtCLCc and AtCLCg, were found to interact with PP2A-C5. Moreover, overexpression of AtCLCc leads to increased salt tolerance and Cl(-) accumulation in transgenic Arabidopsis plants. These data indicate that PP2A-C5-mediated better growth under salt conditions might involve up-regulation of CLC activities on vacuolar membranes and that PP2A-C5 could be used for improving salt tolerance in crops.
Plant growth promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) hold promising future for sustainable agriculture. Here, we demonstrate a carotenoid producing halotolerant PGPR Dietzia natronolimnaea STR1 protecting wheat plants from salt stress by modulating the transcriptional machinery responsible for salinity tolerance in plants. The expression studies confirmed the involvement of ABA-signalling cascade, as TaABARE and TaOPR1 were upregulated in PGPR inoculated plants leading to induction of TaMYB and TaWRKY expression followed by stimulation of expression of a plethora of stress related genes. Enhanced expression of TaST, a salt stress-induced gene, associated with promoting salinity tolerance was observed in PGPR inoculated plants in comparison to uninoculated control plants. Expression of SOS pathway related genes (SOS1 and SOS4) was modulated in PGPR-applied wheat shoots and root systems. Tissue-specific responses of ion transporters TaNHX1, TaHAK, and TaHKT1, were observed in PGPR-inoculated plants. The enhanced gene expression of various antioxidant enzymes such as APX, MnSOD, CAT, POD, GPX and GR and higher proline content in PGPR-inoculated wheat plants contributed to increased tolerance to salinity stress. Overall, these results indicate that halotolerant PGPR-mediated salinity tolerance is a complex phenomenon that involves modulation of ABA-signalling, SOS pathway, ion transporters and antioxidant machinery.
Using a 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4OHT)-inducible, conditional Sos1-null mutation, we analyzed wild-type (WT), single Sos1-KO, Sos2-KO and double Sos1/2 KO primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) with an aim at evaluating the functional specificity or redundancy of the Sos1 and Sos2 alleles at the cellular level. The 4OHT-induced Sos1-KO and Sos1/2-DKO MEFs exhibited distinct flat morphology, enlarged cell perimeter and altered cytoskeletal organization that were not observed in the WT and Sos2-KO counterparts. The Sos1-KO and Sos1/2-DKO MEFs also displayed significant accumulation, in comparison with WT and Sos2-KO MEFs, of cytoplasmic vesicular bodies identified as autophagosomes containing degraded mitochondria by means of electron microscopy and specific markers. Cellular proliferation and migration were impaired in Sos1-KO and Sos1/2-DKO MEFs in comparison with WT and Sos2-KO MEFs, whereas cell adhesion was only impaired upon depletion of both Sos isoforms. RasGTP formation was practically absent in Sos1/2-DKO MEFs as compared with the other genotypes and extracellular signal-regulated kinase phosphorylation showed only significant reduction after combined Sos1/2 depletion. Consistent with a mitophagic phenotype, in vivo labeling with specific fluorophores uncovered increased levels of oxidative stress (elevated intracellular reactive oxygen species and mitochondrial superoxide and loss of mitochondrial membrane potential) in the Sos1-KO and the Sos1/2-DKO cells as compared with Sos2-KO and WT MEFs. Interestingly, treatment of the MEF cultures with antioxidants corrected the altered phenotypes of Sos1-KO and Sos1/2-DKO MEFs by restoring their altered perimeter size and proliferative rate to levels similar to those of WT and Sos2-KO MEFs. Our data uncover a direct mechanistic link between Sos1 and control of intracellular oxidative stress, and demonstrate functional prevalence of Sos1 over Sos2 with regards to cellular proliferation and viability.
The accumulation of sodium in soil (saline conditions) negatively affects plant growth and development. The Salt Overly Sensitive (SOS) pathway in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) functions to remove sodium from the cytosol during vegetative development preventing its accumulation to toxic levels. In this pathway, the SOS3 and CALCINEURIN B-LIKE10 (CBL10) calcium sensors interact with the SOS2 protein kinase to activate sodium/proton exchange at the plasma membrane (SOS1) or vacuolar membrane. To determine if the same pathway functions during reproductive development in response to salt, fertility was analyzed in wild type and the SOS pathway mutants grown in saline conditions. In response to salt, CBL10 functions early in reproductive development before fertilization, while SOS1 functions mostly after fertilization when seed development begins. Neither SOS2 nor SOS3 function in reproductive development in response to salt. Loss of CBL10 function resulted in reduced anther dehiscence, shortened stamen filaments, and aborted pollen development. In addition, cbl10 mutant pistils could not sustain the growth of wild-type pollen tubes. These results suggest that CBL10 is critical for reproductive development in the presence of salt and that it functions in different pathways during vegetative and reproductive development.
Sos-1 and Sos-2 are ubiquitously expressed Ras-guanine exchange factors involved in Erk-MAP kinase pathway activation. Using mice lacking genes encoding Sos-1 and Sos-2, we evaluated the role of these proteins in peripheral T-cell signaling and function. Our results confirmed that TCR-mediated Erk activation in peripheral CD4(+) T cells does not depend on Sos-1 and Sos-2, although IL-2-mediated Erk activation does. Unexpectedly, however, we show an increase in AKT phosphorylation in Sos-1/2dKO CD4(+) T cells upon TCR and IL-2 stimulation. Activation of AKT was likely a consequence of increased recruitment of PI3K to Grb2 upon TCR and/or IL-2 stimulation in Sos-1/2dKO CD4(+) T cells. The increased activity of the PI3K/AKT pathway led to downregulation of the surface receptor CD62L in Sos-1/2dKO T cells and a subsequent impairment in T-cell migration.
Constitutively active mutant KRas displays a reduced rate of GTP hydrolysis via both intrinsic and GTPase-activating protein-catalyzed mechanisms, resulting in the perpetual activation of Ras pathways. We describe a fragment screening campaign using X-ray crystallography that led to the discovery of three fragment binding sites on the Ras:SOS complex. The identification of tool compounds binding at each of these sites allowed exploration of two new approaches to Ras pathway inhibition by stabilizing or covalently modifying the Ras:SOS complex to prevent the reloading of Ras with GTP. Initially, we identified ligands that bound reversibly to the Ras:SOS complex in two distinct sites, but these compounds were not sufficiently potent inhibitors to validate our stabilization hypothesis. We conclude by demonstrating that covalent modification of Cys118 on Ras leads to a novel mechanism of inhibition of the SOS-mediated interaction between Ras and Raf and is effective at inhibiting the exchange of labeled GDP in both mutant (G12C and G12V) and wild type Ras.
Salt Overly Sensitive (SOS) pathway comprising SOS1, SOS2 and SOS3 genes has been recognized as the key mechanism controlling ion homeostasis under salinity stress. SOS2 component of this pathway encodes a serine/threonine protein kinase that together with SOS3 activates downstream Na(+)/H(+) antiporter SOS1, reestablishing cellular ion homeostasis under salinity stress. In the present study, we have found that the transcript levels of BjSOS2 are induced in response to various abiotic stresses. We have isolated a 713 bp promoter region of SOS2 gene from Brassica juncea to study the regulation of BjSOS2 under various abiotic stress conditions and further, to examine utility of the cloned upstream region in genetic engineering experiments. For this purpose, 713 bp BjSOS2 promoter:β-glucuronidase (GUS) fusion construct, along with its two subsequent 5' deletion derivatives, D1 (443 bp) and D2 (209 bp), were stably transformed into B. juncea. Functional analysis of transgenic lines revealed significant increase in promoter activity under salinity, desiccation as well as abscisic acid (ABA) treatment which was consistent with increased transcript levels of GUS gene. BjSOS2 promoter possesses strong multi-stress inducible nature, suggesting its involvement in various aspects of stress signaling. Considering the fact that the simultaneous presence of multiple abiotic stress conditions under field conditions is a challenging threat to crop productivity, future studies may utilize the BjSOS2 promoter to drive stress-inducible expression of genes involved in imparting tolerance to multiple stresses.
Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) often rely on electrostatic interactions to bind their structured targets. To obtain insight into the mechanism of formation of the electrostatic encounter complex, we investigated the binding of the peptide Sos (PPPVPPRRRR), which serves as a minimal model for an IDP, to the c-Crk N-terminal SH3 domain. Initially, we measured ¹⁵N relaxation rates at two magnetic field strengths and determined the binding shifts for the complex of Sos with wild-type SH3. We have also recorded a 3 μs molecular dynamics (MD) trajectory of this complex using the Amber ff99SB*-ILDN force field. The comparison of the experimental and simulated data shows that MD simulation consistently overestimates the strength of salt bridge interactions at the binding interface. The series of simulations using other advanced force fields also failed to produce any satisfactory results. To address this issue, we have devised an empirical correction to the Amber ff99SB*-ILDN force field whereby the Lennard-Jones equilibrium distance for the nitrogen-oxygen pair across the Arg-to-Asp and Arg-to-Glu salt bridges has been increased by 3%. Implementing this correction resulted in a good agreement between the simulations and the experiment. Adjusting the strength of salt bridge interactions removed a certain amount of strain contained in the original MD model, thus improving the binding of the hydrophobic N-terminal portion of the peptide. The arginine-rich C-terminal portion of the peptide, freed from the effect of the overstabilized salt bridges, was found to interconvert more rapidly between its multiple conformational states. The modified MD protocol has also been successfully used to simulate the entire binding process. In doing so, the peptide was initially placed high above the protein surface. It then arrived at the correct bound pose within ∼2 Å of the crystallographic coordinates. This simulation allowed us to analyze the details of the dynamic binding intermediate, i.e., the electrostatic encounter complex. However, an experimental characterization of this transient, weakly populated state remains out of reach. To overcome this problem, we designed the double mutant of c-Crk N-SH3 in which mutations Y186L and W169F abrogate tight Sos binding and shift the equilibrium toward the intermediate state resembling the electrostatic encounter complex. The results of the combined NMR and MD study of this engineered system will be reported in the next part of this paper.
Aberrant activation of the small GTPase Ras by oncogenic mutation or constitutively active upstream receptor tyrosine kinases results in the deregulation of cellular signals governing growth and survival in ∼30% of all human cancers. However, the discovery of potent inhibitors of Ras has been difficult to achieve. Here, we report the identification of small molecules that bind to a unique pocket on the Ras:Son of Sevenless (SOS):Ras complex, increase the rate of SOS-catalyzed nucleotide exchange in vitro, and modulate Ras signaling pathways in cells. X-ray crystallography of Ras:SOS:Ras in complex with these molecules reveals that the compounds bind in a hydrophobic pocket in the CDC25 domain of SOS adjacent to the Switch II region of Ras. The structure-activity relationships exhibited by these compounds can be rationalized on the basis of multiple X-ray cocrystal structures. Mutational analyses confirmed the functional relevance of this binding site and showed it to be essential for compound activity. These molecules increase Ras-GTP levels and disrupt MAPK and PI3K signaling in cells at low micromolar concentrations. These small molecules represent tools to study the acute activation of Ras and highlight a pocket on SOS that may be exploited to modulate Ras signaling.
The salt stress-induced SALT-OVERLY-SENSITIVE (SOS) pathway in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) involves the perception of a calcium signal by the SOS3 and SOS3-like CALCIUM-BINDING PROTEIN8 (SCaBP8) calcium sensors, which then interact with and activate the SOS2 protein kinase, forming a complex at the plasma membrane that activates the SOS1 Na⁺/H⁺ exchanger. It has recently been reported that phosphorylation of SCaBP proteins by SOS2-like protein kinases (PKSs) stabilizes the interaction between the two proteins as part of a regulatory mechanism that was thought to be common to all SCaBP and PKS proteins. Here, we report the calcium-independent activation of PKS24 by SCaBP1 and show that activation is dependent on interaction of PKS24 with the C-terminal tail of SCaBP1. However, unlike what has been found for other PKS-SCaBP pairs, multiple amino acids in SCaBP1 are phosphorylated by PKS24, and this phosphorylation is dependent on the interaction of the proteins through the PKS24 FISL motif and on the efficient activation of PKS24 by the C-terminal tail of SCaBP1. In addition, we show that Thr-211 and Thr-212, which are not common phosphorylation sites in the conserved PFPF motif found in most SCaBP proteins, are important for this activation. Finally, we also found that SCaBP1-regulated PKS24 kinase activity is important for inactivating the Arabidopsis plasma membrane proton-translocating adenosine triphosphatase. Together, these results suggest the existence of a novel SCaBP-PKS regulatory mechanism in plants.
The duration and/or the magnitude of Ras-Erk activation are known to be crucial for cell-fate decisions. In T cells, sustained Erk activation correlates with differentiation/proliferation, whereas transient Erk activation parallels with unresponsiveness/apoptosis. The mechanism by which Son of sevenless (Sos) proteins and Ras guanyl-releasing protein 1 (RasGRP1) contribute to dynamics of Erk activation in mature T cells is not yet known. Here, we have assessed this issue using stimuli inducing either transient or sustained TCR signaling and RNA interference mediated suppression of Sos1, Sos2, and RasGRP1 expression in primary human T cells. We found that transient Erk activation depends on RasGRP1 but not on Sos. Conversely, sustained Erk signaling and T-cell activation depend on both Sos1 and RasGRP1. In summary, our data show for the first time that the two guanine nucleotide exchange factors expressed in T cells are differentially involved in the regulation of the duration of Erk phosphorylation and T-cell activation.
This is the first report on the function of a member of the CIPK family in Populus euphratica. The Ca(2+)-dependent salt overly sensitive (SOS) pathway has been shown to play an essential role in maintaining ion homeostasis and conferring salt tolerance. One component of the SOS pathway, SOS1, was identified in the salt-resistant tree P. euphratica. In this study, we identified and functionally characterized another component of the SOS pathway in this tree called PeSOS2 or PeCIPK26. On the basis of protein sequence similarity and complementation studies in Arabidopsis, PeCIPK26 was concluded to be the functional homolog of Arabidopsis AtSOS2. Yeast two-hybrid assays revealed that PeCIPK26 can interact with four calcineurin B-like (CBL) genes, i.e., PeCBL1, PeCBL4/PeSOS3, PeCBL9 and PeCBL10. Autophosphorylation assays showed that PeCIPK26 is an active protein kinase. Expression profile analysis demonstrated that PeCIPK26 is expressed in root, stem and leaf, and throughout the cell including cell membrane, cytoplasm and nucleus; in addition, it can be induced under salt-stress treatment. Functions of PeCIPK26 in salt tolerance were evaluated by gene overexpression in Arabidopsis cipk24 mutants. The better salt tolerance of transgenic plants relative to mutants was shown by their higher germination rate, lower Na(+) accumulation and higher capacity to discharge Na(+) when grown with NaCl. These results suggest the involvement of PeCIPK26 in the salt-stress response of P. euphratica.
Kindlin-2 is an adaptor protein that contributes to renal tubulointerstitial fibrosis (TIF). Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in tubular epithelial cells was regarded as one of the key events in TIF. To determine whether kindlin-2 is involved in the EMT process, we investigated its regulation of EMT in human kidney tubular epithelial cells (TECs) and explored the underlying mechanism. In this study, we found that overexpression of kindlin-2 suppressed epithelial marker E-cadherin and increased the expression of fibronectin and the myofibroblast marker α-smooth muscle actin (SMA). Kindlin-2 significantly activated ERK1/2 and Akt, and inhibition of ERK1/2 or Akt reversed kindlin-2-induced EMT in human kidney TECs. Mechanistically, kindlin-2 interacted with Ras and son of sevenless (Sos)-1. Furthermore, overexpression of kindlin-2 increased Ras activation through recruiting Sos-1. Treatment with a Ras inhibitor markedly repressed kindlin-2-induced ERK1/2 and Akt activation, leading to restraint of EMT. We further demonstrated that knockdown of kindlin-2 inhibited EGF-induced Ras-Sos-1 interaction, resulting in reduction of Ras activation and suppression of EMT stimulated by EGF. Importantly, we found that depletion of kindlin-2 significantly inhibited activation of ERK1/2 and Akt signaling in mice with unilateral ureteral obstruction. We conclude that kindlin-2, through activating Ras and the downstream ERK1/2 and Akt signaling pathways, plays an important role in regulating renal tubular EMT and could be a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of fibrotic kidney diseases.
The SOS signaling pathway has emerged as a key mechanism in preserving the homeostasis of Na⁺ and K⁺ under saline conditions. We have recently identified and functionally characterized, by complementation studies in yeast, the gene encoding the durum wheat plasma membrane Na⁺/H⁺ antiporter (TdSOS1). To extend these functional studies to the whole plant level, we complemented Arabidopsis sos1-1 mutant with wild-type TdSOS1 or with the hyperactive form TdSOS1∆972 and compared them to the Arabidopsis AtSOS1 protein. The Arabidopsis sos1-1 mutant is hypersensitive to both Na⁺ and Li⁺ ions. Compared with sos1-1 mutant transformed with the empty binary vector, seeds from TdSOS1 or TdSOS1∆972 transgenic plants had better germination under salt stress and more robust seedling growth in agar plates as well as in nutritive solution containing Na⁺ or Li⁺ salts. The root elongation of TdSOS1∆972 transgenic lines was higher than that of Arabidopsis sos1-1 mutant transformed with TdSOS1 or with the endogenous AtSOS1 gene. Under salt stress, TdSOS1∆972 transgenic lines showed greater water retention capacity and retained low Na⁺ and high K⁺ in their shoots and roots. Our data showed that the hyperactive form TdSOS1∆972 conferred a significant ionic stress tolerance to Arabidopsis plants and suggest that selection of hyperactive alleles of the SOS1 transport protein may pave the way for obtaining salt-tolerant crops.
Crop productivity is greatly affected by soil salinity; therefore, improvement in salinity tolerance of crops is a major goal in salt-tolerant breeding. The Salt Overly Sensitive (SOS) signal-transduction pathway plays a key role in ion homeostasis and salt tolerance in plants. Here, we report that overexpression of Arabidopsis thaliana SOS1+SOS2+SOS3 genes enhanced salt tolerance in tall fescue. The transgenic plants displayed superior growth and accumulated less Na+ and more K+ in roots after 350 mM NaCl treatment. Moreover, Na+ enflux, K+ influx, and Ca2+ influx were higher in the transgenic plants than in the wild-type plants. The activities of the enzyme superoxide dismutase, peroxidase, catalase, and proline content in the transgenic plants were significantly increased; however, the malondialdehyde content decreased in transgenic plants compared to the controls. These results suggested that co-expression of A. thaliana SOS1+SOS2+SOS3 genes enhanced the salt tolerance in transgenic tall fescue.
Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is a lethal brain tumor in adults. Despite advances in treatments, such as surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy, high‑grade glioma remains fatal. The molecular and cellular mechanisms for GBM are not entirely clear and further studies are required to elucidate these. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small, non‑coding, endogenous RNAs that are involved in cell differentiation and proliferation, and have been suggested to play a role in a variety of types of cancer. In this study, we investigated the role of miR-124 in the inhibition of proliferation of GBM cells. The downregulation of miR-124 in human GBM tumor cell lines was detected using quantitative RT-PCR. To assess the function of miR-124, we constructed stable cell lines, U87-124 and U373-124, which overexpressed miR-124 using lentiviral vectors. Overexpression of miR-124 inhibited the proliferation of GBM cancer cells in vitro. Using integrated bioinformatics analysis, SOS1 was found to be a direct target for miR-124, which is frequently upregulated in gliomas. Dual‑luciferase reporter assays confirmed that the SOS1 mRNA 3'‑untranslated regions (UTR) was directly targeted by miR-124 and that the mutated 3'UTR was not affected. This was revealed to be mechanistically associated with the induction of SOS/Ras/Raf/ERK and the suppression of ERK activity, which was achieved by silencing SOS1. This study therefore indicates an important role for miR-124 in the regulation of growth in the molecular etiology of GBM, and offers a potential strategy for the use of miR-124 in cancer treatment.
Environmental stressors, including high salt, drought, and low or high temperatures, are often associated with significant losses in agricultural productivity. Plants have evolved a diverse array of signaling pathways to modulate their development in response to various environmental challenges. Here, we report the characterization of a member of the R2R3-MYB transcription factor family, AtMyb73. The expression of AtMyb73 was up-regulated by salt stress but not by other stresses. The maximum level of AtMyb73 expression occurred at 6h of 300mM NaCl treatment. Under salt stress, atmyb73 ko mutant plants exhibited higher survival rates compare to wild type (Col-0) plants. Using quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) analysis, we determined that the accumulation of salt overly sensitive (SOS) transcripts, SOS1 and SOS3, was higher in atmyb73 ko and atmyb73 eko plants than in wild type plants in response to 300mM NaCl treatment. These results indicate that AtMyb73 is a negative regulator of SOS induction in response to salt stress in Arabidopsis thaliana.
Hereditary Gingival Fibromatosis (HGF) is a rare benign fibrous lesion of the gingival tissues presumably caused by single gene defects. The aim of this study was to identify the genetic defect leading to HGF in an extended pedigree.
We report the clinical features and genetic analysis of a family affected by HGF. A total of 17 subjects were assessed clinically and had blood samples taken for DNA extraction. Multipoint parametric linkage analysis was performed to identify the possible chromosomal location responsible for HGF in this family.
Presence of severe HGF associated with tooth impaction was confirmed for seven members of this three-generation family. Linkage analysis revealed that loci on chromosomes 7, 10, 13, 15, 16, 17, 19 and 20 were linked to this trait. Previously found mutations in the SOS1 and GINGF loci were therefore excluded by this analysis.
This study brings further evidence for genetic heterogeneity of HGF and points towards the existence of different, not-yet-identified genes linked to this condition.
Hereditary gingival fibromatosis (HGF) is a rare, benign disorder characterized by slowly progressive fibrous overgrowth of the gingiva. To date, two loci have been mapped in familial cases with autosomal dominant non-syndromic HGF: GINGF (MIM 135300) on chromosome 2p21-p22 and GINGF2 (MIM 605544) on chromosome 5q13-q22. Of the two loci, only SOS1 (son of sevenless one, MIM 182530) gene underlying GINGF locus has been identified. Ascertainment of a large Chinese family has allowed the mapping of a novel locus to 2p22.3-p23.3, GINGF3. Haplotype construction and analysis localized the new locus to an 11.4-cM interval between markers D2S2221 (telomeric) and D2S1788 (centromeric). The maximum two-point limit of detection (LOD) score of 3.45 (theta=0) and multipoint LOD score of 5.00 for marker D2S390 strongly supported linkage to this region. Thus, this genetic interval is distal to and does not overlap with the previously described locus, GINGF, on 2p21-p22.
Pemphigus vulgaris is an autoimmune blistering disorder that involves the skin and mucous membranes. Few reports have described nasal and oropharyngolaryngeal lesions in pemphigus vulgaris using an endoscopic ororhinolaryngologic examination. We retrospectively reviewed the clinical records of 11 patients with pemphigus vulgaris between 2001 and 2013 with respect to their symptoms, lesion sites, lesion features, and treatments received. All patients had undergone an endoscopic ororhinolaryngologic examination. Their mucosa-related symptoms were sore throat, oral pain, odynophagia, gingival bleeding, hoarseness, and epistaxis. The most frequent sites were the oral cavity (gingiva and buccal mucosa), larynx (epiglottis and vocal fold), oropharynx (soft palate), and nasal cavity (nasal septum). Lesions were typically characterized by erosion, erosion with a whitish exudate, and erythematous patches. Thus, our study findings reveal that pemphigus vulgaris involves both the nasal and oropharyngolaryngeal regions. Patients with pemphigus vulgaris should undergo an endoscopic ororhinolaryngologic examination to determine the range of their lesions.
Graphene oxide has attracted widespread attentions in the biomedical fields due to its excellent biocompatibility. Herein we investigated the layer-number dependent antibacterial and osteogenic behaviors of graphene oxide in biointerfaces. Graphene oxide with different layer numbers was deposited on the titanium surfaces by cathodal electrophoretic deposition with varied deposition voltages. The initial cell adhesion and spreading, cell proliferation and osteogenic differentiation were observed from all the samples using rat bone mesenchymal stem cells. Both Gram-negative Escherichia coli and Gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus were used to investigate the antibacterial effect of the modified titanium surfaces. Co-cultures of human gingival fibroblasts (HGF) cells with Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus were conducted to simulate the conditions of the clinical practice. The results show that the titanium surfaces with graphene oxide exhibited excellent antibacterial and osteogenic effects. Increasing the layer-number of graphene oxide resulted in the augment of reactive oxygen species levels and the wrinkling which led to the antibacterial and osteogenic effects respectively. Compared to pure titanium surface in the cells-bacteria co-culture process, the modified titanium surfaces with graphene oxide exhibited higher surface coverage percentage of cells.
Tissue engineering by using recombinant human (rh) growth factor technology may offer a promising therapeutic approach for treatment of gingival recession. Fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2) has shown the ability to promote periodontal regeneration. Gelatin/beta-tricalcium phosphate (gelatin/β-TCP) sponges have been developed to control the release of growth factors. The present study evaluated the periodontal regenerative efficacy of rhFGF-2 by comparing gelatin/β-TCP sponges incorporated with rhFGF-2 to the scaffolds alone in artificially created recession-type defects in dogs.
Critically sized buccal gingival recession defects were surgically created on maxillary canine teeth of five dogs. In each animal, defects were randomized to receive either a gelatin/β-TCP sponge soaked with rhFGF-2 (gelatin/β-TCP/rhFGF-2) or phosphate-buffered saline (gelatin/β-TCP). Eight weeks after surgery, biopsy specimens were obtained and subjected to microcomputed tomography and histological analyses.
Complete root coverage was achieved in both groups. Microcomputed tomography revealed significantly greater new bone volume in the gelatin/β-TCP/rhFGF-2 group. Histologically, both groups achieved periodontal regeneration; however, gelatin/β-TCP/rhFGF-2 sites exhibited more tissue regeneration, characterized by significantly larger amounts of new cementum and new bone. Gelatin/β-TCP sites featured increased long junctional epithelium and connective tissue attachment. In the gelatin/β-TCP/rhFGF-2 sites, new bone exhibited many haversian canals and circumferential lamellae as well as remarkably thick periosteum with blood vascularization and hypercellularity.
Within the limitations of this study, rhFGF-2 in gelatin/β-TCP sponges exhibits an increased potential to support periodontal wound healing/regeneration in canine recession-type defects.
Matrix metalloproteinase-8 (MMP-8) is involved in a wide range of pathologies including periodontitis and cardiovascular diseases (CVD). The association between periodontitis and CVD has been repeatedly recognized. The aim of the study was to analyze to what extent circulating active MMP-8 (aMMP-8) is associated with periodontal disease status and oral fluid aMMP-8 levels in otherwise healthy subjects.
In a cross-sectional study, aMMP-8 was measured in serum of 59 volunteers, comprising 19 periodontally healthy subjects, 20 patients with gingivitis as well as 20 with periodontitis. All study subjects were characterized regarding aMMP-8 concentrations in different oral fluids as well as clinically and microbiologically with respect to periodontal disease. aMMP-8 levels in gingival crevicular fluid were measured using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Saliva enzyme levels as well as circulating aMMP-8 were determined by a time-resolved immunofluorometric assay. Both methods utilized the same monoclonal antibodies. Correlation and regression analyses were performed to study the potential association between serum aMMP-8 and oral parameters.
Oral aMMP-8 levels were significantly higher in patients with periodontitis compared to periodontally healthy or gingivitis subjects. Highest serum aMMP-8 concentration was also found in the periodontitis group. The serum levels correlated significantly with oral aMMP-8 as well as with clinical parameters in a dose-dependent manner. These results were confirmed in a multivariate regression analysis. After adjusting for potential confounders, saliva aMMP-8 concentrations as well as periodontitis severity were significant predictors of serum aMMP-8.
The associations between circulating aMMP-8 and oral aMMP-8 as well as periodontal findings in a dose-dependent manner may contribute to linking periodontal disease with increased CVDsusceptibility.
Various researches have investigated factors associated with the prevalence and intensity of bacteraemia following oral procedures including orthodontic procedures.
The aim of this study was to determine the effect of age, gender, plaque and gingival indices on the occurrence of odontogenic bacteraemia following orthodontic treatment procedures.
Orthodontic Clinic, Lagos University Teaching Hospital (LUTH), Lagos, Nigeria.
Using the consecutive, convenience sampling method, a total of 100 subjects who met the inclusion criteria were recruited for the study and peripheral blood was collected before and again within 2 minutes of completion of orthodontic procedures for microbiologic analysis using the BACTEC automated blood culture system and the lysis filtration methods of blood culturing. The subjects were randomly placed in one of four orthodontic procedures investigated: alginate impression making (Group I), separator placement (Group II), band cementation (Group III) and arch wire change (Group IV). Plaque and gingival indices were assessed using the plaque component of the Simplified Oral Hygiene Index (OHI-S) (Greene &amp; Vermillion) and Modified gingival index (Lobene) respectively before blood collection. Spearman Point bi-serial correlations and logistic regression statistics were used for statistical evaluations at p &lt; 0.05 level.
An overall baseline prevalence of bacteraemia of 3% and 17% were observed using the BACCTEC and lysis filtration methods respectively. Similarly, overall prevalence of bacteraemia following orthodontic treatment procedures of 16% and 28% were observed respectively using the BACTEC and lysis filtration methods. A statistically significant increase in the prevalence of bateraemia was observed following separator placement (p=0.016). An increase in age, plaque index scores and modified gingival index scores of the subjects were found to be associated with an increase in the prevalence of bacteraemia following orthodontic treatment procedures, with plaque index score showing the strongest correlation.
Separator placement was found to induce significantly highest level of bacteraemia. Meticulous oral hygiene practice and the use of 0.2% chlorhexidine mouth rinse prior to separator placement may be considered an effective measure in reducing oral bacteria load and consequent reduction of the occurrence of bacteraemia following orthodontic treatment procedures.
Periodontal diseases have been reported to have a form of reciprocal relationship with the general systemic health, in which case those with some systemic diseases such as hypertension have poorer periodontal health and vice versa. The issue of causal or casual relationship is however yet to be finally resolved.
The aim of this study was to determine any possible relationship between chronic periodontitis and cardiovascular risk factors.
A cross-sectional assessment of cardiovascular risk factors such as blood pressure, body mass index, waist circumference and the carotid artery intima media thickness (CIMT) was done among 100 consecutive subjects in the echocardiogram unit of the University College Hospital, Ibadan, Nigeria over a period of six months. These cardiovascular risk factors were compared with periodontal parameters such as Simplified Oral Hygiene index (OHI-S), Gingival index (GI) and Community Periodontal Index (CPI).
The systolic blood pressure (SBP) of the respondents ranged from 98 - 210 mm Hg with a mean of 133.1 ± 15 mm Hg, diastolic blood pressure (DBP) 60 - 136 mm Hg with a mean of 84.6 ± 6.4 mm Hg. There was a statistically significant relationship between the systolic blood pressure and oral hygiene index (P&lt; 0.000), diastolic blood pressure and oral hygiene index (P &lt; 0.010) and mean carotid artery intima media thickness and oral hygiene index (P&lt; 0.012) among the respondents.
In view of the significant relationship between the blood pressure and the mean carotid artery intima media thickness, when compared with the oral hygiene status of respondents in this study, more emphasis should be laid on regular preventive dental visit as a way of decreasing cardiovascular health risk.
Wisdom teeth extraction is a common procedure, generally considered as safe by patients. However, complications are possible, especially periodontal ones. The aim of this study was to evaluate the frequency and the consequences of periodontal complications at the level the 2nd molars after extraction of the wisdom teeth.
A single-center retrospective observational multi-operator study was conducted at the university hospital of Besançon - France. The files of all the adult patients who underwent extraction of four impacted wisdom teeth by mean of a standardized surgical technique between November 2012 and November 2014 and who could be followed 1 year postoperatively at least and that precisely mentioned the periodontal status of the surgical sites were included. Postoperative complications, gingival and plaque indexes according to Loë and Silness, periodontal attachment level and periodontal second molar probing were recorded. The main judgment criterion was the occurrence of a periodontal complication in the second molar areas.
The files of 20 patients (15 women - 5 men), operated on by five different surgeons, met the inclusion criteria. Two patients suffered from dry socket at one of the avulsion sites. No patient had a gingival or plaque index greater than 2. No gingival recession or periodontal pocket over 4mm was found.
Extraction of impacted third molars in young healthy adults didn't have any impact on the second molars periodontal environment in our study. Literature suggests that surgical technique greatly influences the occurrence and the extent of periodontal sequelae.
Cytokines are suggested to play a role in periodontitis.
To determine and compare the levels of Interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β) and Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) in gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) samples amongst healthy individuals and those with chronic periodontitis. Further to compare the GCF cytokine levels in three genotype classes defined by the respective gene polymorphisms.
The study was conducted on 41 chronic periodontitis patients and 40 healthy volunteers. IL-1β and TNF-α were quantified in GCF by cytometric bead array. DNA was extracted from peripheral blood samples and genotyping of IL1B +3954C/T (rs1143634) IL1B -511G/A (rs16944), TNFA -1031T/C (rs1799964) and TNFA -863C/A (rs1800630) polymorphisms were performed using Sanger sequencing and Taqman SNP genotyping assays methods.
Both IL-1β and TNF-α levels were significantly higher in chronic periodontitis group compared to the controls. IL-1β and TNF-α levels did not significantly differ in genotype classes of the respective polymorphism (IL1B -511G/A, TNFA -1031T/C and TNFA -863C/A). However, individuals with CT genotype of IL1B +3954C/T showed higher levels of IL-1β in the gingival crevicular fluid (ANOVA p&lt;0.05).
The results of this study revealed the presence of higher levels of IL-1β and TNF-α in subjects with periodontitis and genetic control of IL-1β levels in our samples of Indians.
To investigate the relationship between RECK gene polymorphisms and the clinicopathologic features of ameloblastoma.
Normal gingival mucosa specimens were obtained from 10 healthy volunteers. Ameloblastomas were surgically removed from 30 patients and part of the tumor specimens were used to detect RECK gene polymorphisms by using PCR-single-strand conformation polymorphism (PCR-SSCP) and DNA sequencing analysis. Expression of RECK and MMP-9 protein was measured using western blot.
The overall SNP rate was 46.7% (14/30). Four polymorphisms were detected in exon 9, 11, 13, 15 of the RECK gene: two synonymous (P520P and R625R) and two missense SNPs (V275I and I395V). RECK protein expression in specimens with minor RECK SNPs was lower than that in specimens without RECK SNPs (P&lt;0.05), and, RECK protein expression in specimens with and without RECK SNPs was lower than that in the normal gingiva specimens (P&lt;0.05). MMP-9 protein expression in specimens with minor RECK SNPs was higher than that in specimens without RECK SNPs (P&lt;0.05), and MMP-9 protein expression in specimens with and without RECK SNPs was higher than that in normal gingiva specimens (P&lt;0.05). RECK gene polymorphisms were closely associated with active proliferation, capsular invasion, and clinical recurrence of ameloblastoma.
The rs16932912(G/A) SNP in the RECK gene was closely associated with active proliferation, capsular invasion, and clinical recurrence of ameloblastoma. RECK protein expression was closely associated with the presence of the rs16932912(G/A) SNP.
Background Many smokers have recently turned to electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) because they have been marketed as a cheaper and safer smokeless alternative to traditional cigarettes, and a possible smoking cessation tool. Even though the safety of these electronic devices is still not fully known, there is evidence of their cytotoxicity on cells which belong to the oral cavity. In a previous paper the increase of reactive oxygen production and Bax expression, followed by the occurrence of apoptosis, were demonstrated in human gingival fibroblasts. The aim of this paper is to further investigate the effects of the e-cigarette liquids (with and without nicotine) on the same experimental model. Methods Human gingival fibroblasts were treated with e-cigarette fluids containing nicotine (final concentration 1mg/mL) and the equivalent volume of a fluid without nicotine, for times up to 48 h. Lactate Dehydrogenase Assay (LDH), electronic microscopy analysis, collagen I production, flow cytometry lysosome compartment evaluation and western blotting LC3 (microtubule-associated protein 1A/1B-light chain 3) expression were performed. Results Fluids containing nicotine exerted cytotoxicity as demonstrated by the increased levels of LDH, in parallel to the presence of numerous vacuoles in the cytoplasm, as well as a decrease in collagen I production and an augmented LC3 II expression. Autophagic vesicles and an increased number of pro-collagen I molecules were present in the cytoplasm of fibroblasts exposed to nicotine-free fluids. In the same samples the time-dependent activation of the lysosomal compartment with no changes in LC3 expression were detected. Conclusion E-cigarette fluids (with and without nicotine) trigger molecular and morphological responses in oral fibroblasts, raising concerns about their role in the pathogenesis of oral diseases.
The role of keratinized tissue (KT) for maintenance of periodontal health has been debated for many years. This study assessed the long-term "biologic remodeling" of periodontal dimensions of teeth treated with free gingival grafts (FGG) compared to their adjacent/untreated teeth.
Seventy-four patients, with at least one site showing absence or a reduced amount of attached gingiva associated with gingival recession at baseline, were treated with FGG in a private practice. Patient/tooth/site-associated variables were recorded for each patient (treated and mesial/distal adjacent teeth) at baseline (T0), 6 months after surgery (T1), during the follow up period (T2) (mean 15.3 years), and at the end of the follow-up period (T3) over 25 years. Parametric, non-parametric and mixed effects logistic regression statistics were used throughout the study.
A total of 182 teeth submitted to FGG were compared to 247 untreated/adjacent teeth. The majority of treated teeth (n=152; 83.5%) showed recession depth (RD) reduction (p&lt;0.001). Conversely, untreated/adjacent teeth displayed RD increase at T3 (p&lt;0.001). Also, it was found statistically significant KT band contraction at treated sites, whereas adjacent sites presented small clinical improvements (p&lt;0.001). The total Root-coverage Esthetic Score of the areas including treated and adjacent untreated teeth improved from T2 to T3 (p&lt;0.001). Some independent variables, such as age, tooth type and RD at T1 seems to influence RD and KT changes over time.
Soft tissue augmentation procedures may modify the "biologic remodeling" of periodontal dimensions over time associated to aging. The use of FGG may promote more favorable KT dimensions and improve marginal tissue recession.
Data sourcesA broad computerised search with similar key terms was performed in different databases that included: Ovid Medline, Thomson's ISI Web of Science, PubMed, Science Direct, EMBASE and the Cochrane Library. Grey literature, dissertations, abstracts and theses were searched too. Reference lists of the selected articles were hand-searched.Study selectionThe inclusion criteria included in vivo randomised clinical trials and quasi-randomised clinical trials using gingival retraction techniques with and without cord. Studies were included if they examined the primary outcome from the review: efficiency of haemostasis control, the amount of gingival displacement and the influence of the techniques on gingival/periodontal health. Secondary outcomes accepted for the review included subjective factors reported by the patient such as pain, sensitivity, unpleasant taste and discomfort and operator's experience with both techniques. Non-English papers, clinical reports, animals studies or in vitro studies were excluded.Data extraction and synthesisTwo authors independently searched and screened the articles. Disagreements were resolved by discussion. A third reviewer participated in the eligibility of the studies. The risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Collaboration tool. Due to the heterogeneity of measurement variables across the studies and the differences among the studies, a meta-analysis was not performed. A narrative assessment was performed for the outcomes: moisture/bleeding control, gingival displacement, gingival/periodontal health and the subjective outcomes.ResultsFrom the initial search that retrieved 1,342 articles, 19 potential relevant full-text articles were considered for the review. Seven studies were selected for the systematic review. Four randomised clinical trials were included. Sample size ranged from eight to 252 participants per study. Five studies were conducted on patients requiring any indirect fixed restorations on prepared teeth. Two studies were done on unprepared teeth. In all studies, participants were in good health, had a healthy gingival condition and a sound periodontal status.ConclusionsBoth techniques are reliable in achieving gingival retraction. The review supports the observation that gingival retraction paste can more effectively help to achieve a dry field and at the same time be less injurious to soft tissues, however its ability to displace gingival tissues, compared to retraction cord, was compromising. Rather than considering the cost of material or the individual preference of the operator, choosing the right technique to maximise clinical efficiency should be based on scientific evidence. It seems that impregnated gingival cords are more effective on thick gingival tissue whereas paste is more effective when minimal retraction is required for haemostasis control, preservation of the gingiva and less tissue displacement.
The aim of this study was to evaluate substance P (SP) levels and the effect of a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), ketoprofen, on SP in the pericoronal gingival tissue after extraction of upper third molars. A sample of 20 young non-smoking systemically healthy adults of both sexes, with a healthy upper third molar to extract for orthodontic purposes, was selected. After extraction, a sample of the gingival tissue of the pericoronal region was collected with a sterile scalpel, placed into test tubes and kept frozen at -20°C until the SP determination. SP levels were determined by using a commercially available enzyme immunoassay (ELISA) kit. The subjects were randomly divided into two groups: group 1 received a single dose of ketoprofen 30 minutes prior to the experimental procedure. The subjects of group 2 did not receive any kind of drug administration before extraction. The patients were asked to complete a diary on the postoperative pain. A relevant amount of SP was measured in all the gingival samples. No statistically significant difference could be detected in SP expression between the two groups. In group 1 pain appearance was significantly delayed (6.2±0.13 hours) in comparison with group 2 (3.95±0.2 hours). In this small selected group of subjects and limited study design, preventive administration of ketoprofen did not significantly affect the gingival levels of SP, the clinical recommendation emerging is that of NSAID administration postoperatively but before pain appearance in order to optimize the management of pain of the patient.
With the increasing use of low level laser therapy (LLLT) in clinical dentistry, the aim of the present study was to assess the effectiveness of diode lasers in the management of orofacial pain. Indexed databases were searched without language and time restrictions up to and including July 2016 using different combinations of the following key words: oral, low level laser therapy, dental, pain, diode lasers, discomfort and analgesia. From the literature reviewed it is evident that LLLT is effective compared to traditional procedures in the management of oro-facial pain associated to soft tissue and hard tissue conditions such as premalignant lesions, gingival conditions and dental extractions. However, it remains to be determined which particular wavelength will produce the more favorable and predictable outcome in terms of pain reduction. It is highly recommended that further randomized control trials with well-defined control groups should be performed to determine the precise wavelengths of the diode lasers for the management of oro-facial pain. Within the limits of the present review, it is concluded that diode lasers therapy is more effective in the management of oro-facial pain compared to traditional procedures.
The aim of this study is to evaluate the clinical and microbiological effect of the systemic antibiotic therapy of proanthocyanidins and secnidazole on periodontitis. Seventy-five subjects with chronic periodontitis were randomly divided into two treatment groups (secnidazole or proanthocyanidins) and one placebo control group (25 cases each). Plaque index (PI), gingival index (GI), gingival bleeding index (BI), probing pocket depth (PPD), and clinical attachment level (CAL) were carried out at baseline, post-treatment and 3 months after treatment. Microbial analysis was performed at baseline and post-treatment. The results show that the two treatment groups had greater mean reduction in BI, GI, and PPD evaluated at both post-treatment and 3 months after treatment compared to the control group (p less than 0.05), but there were no significant differences in those of PI and CAL (except CAL evaluated at post-treatment, p 0.05). After treatment, culturable bacteria counts significantly decreased. In conclusion, the adjunctive use of proanthocyanidins or secnidazole in combination with scaling and root planing in adults with periodontitis is effective in reducing the pathogenic flora and achieves significantly better clinical results to a certain degree.
Cyclosporine-A induces gingival overgrowth with disturbance in the homeostasis of cells and connective tissue proteins. Human gingival fibroblasts were cultured with cyclosporine A, and the expression of two vital endoplasmic stress markers and two prime matrix proteins (connective tissue growth factor (CTGF and periostin) were assessed by RT-PCR. We found that expression of Glucose-Regulated Protein 78 (GRP78/BIP) and CCAAT/enhancer binding protein, C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) were significantly increased, along with CTGF and periostin, suggesting a role for these factors in gingival overgrowth.
Background. Maxillofacial trauma represents a field of common interest as regards both the maxillofacial surgery and prosthodontics, especially for the functional and aesthetic stomatognathic rehabilitation. This condition necessitates relationship between maxillofacial surgeon and prosthodontist, to achieve the ultimate treatment goal. Purpose. The purpose of this study is to make predictable patients outcomes classifying their clinical data, using certain parameters and introducing a new classification method. Materials and Methods. We have chosen 7 parameters to classify the entity of the damage of these patients and to make their treatment and their prognosis predictable: number of teeth lost (T1-T4), upper/lower maxilla (U/L), alveolar/basal bone (Alv/B), gingival tissues (G), soft tissues (S), adult/child (a/c), and reconstructed patient (R). Results and Conclusions. The multidisciplinary approach and the collaboration between multiple clinical figures are therefore critical for the success of the treatment of these patients. The presence and quantification of above parameters influence the treatment protocol; patients undergo different levels of treatment depending on the measured data. The recognition of certain clinical parameters is fundamental to frame diagnosis and successful treatment planning.
The aim of this study is to investigate the behaviour of iPSc derived from dental stem cells in terms of initial adhesion, differentiation potential on differently surface-treated titanium disc.
iPSc derived from human gingival fibroblasts (hGFs) were established using 4-reprogramming factors transduction with Sendai virus. The hGF-iPSc established in this study exhibited the morphology and growth properties similar to human embryonic stem (ES) cells and expressed pluripotency makers. Alkaline Phosphatase (AP) staining, Embryoid Body (EB) formation and in vitro differentiation and karyotyping further confirmed pluripotency of hGF-iPSc. Then, hGF-iPSc were cultured on machined- and Sandblasted and acid etched (SLA)-treated titanium discs with osteogenic induction medium and their morphological as well as quantitative changes according to different surface types were investigated using Alizrin Red S staining, Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Flow cytometry and RT-PCR.
Time-dependent and surface-dependent morphological changes as well as quantitative change in osteogenic differentiation of hGF-iPSc were identified and osteogenic gene expression of hGF-iPSc cultured on SLA-treated titanium disc found to be greater than machined titanium disc, suggesting the fate of hGF-iPSc may be determined by the characteristics of surface to which hGF-iPSc first adhere.
iPSc derived from dental stem cell can be one of the most promising and practical cell sources for personalized regenerative dentistry and their morphological change as well as quantitative change in osteogenic differentiation according to different surface types may be further utilized for future clinical application incorporated with dental implant.
The aim of the present study was to compare the effectiveness of combined Er:YAG and Nd:YAG laser therapy to that of scaling and root planing with hand instruments in non-surgical treatment of chronic periodontitis.
Twenty-five systemically healthy patients with chronic periodontitis were selected for this study. The quadrants were randomly allocated in a split-mouth design to either combined Er:YAG (160 mJ/pulse, 10 Hz) and Nd:YAG laser (100 mJ/pulse, 20 Hz) therapy (test group) or scaling and root planing alone (control group). At baseline, 1 month and 3 months after treatment, plaque index, gingival index, probing depth, clinical attachment level and bleeding on probing (%), were recorded and gingival crevicular fluid and subgingival plaque samples were taken. The gingival crevicular fluid levels of interleukin-1β and tumor necrosis factor-α were analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Quantitative analysis of red complex bacteria was performed using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction.
The clinical parameters had significantly improved for both groups after treatment. There were statistically significant differences in probing depth and clinical attachment level between the test and control groups only for deep pockets (≥7 mm) (P&lt;.05). No significant differences between the two groups were observed for the biochemical and microbiological parameters at any time points (P&gt;.05).
The present study suggests that a combined course of Er:YAG and Nd:YAG laser therapy may be beneficial particularly in inaccessible areas such as deep pockets on a short-term basis. Further, well-designed studies are required to assess the effectiveness of the combination of these lasers.
For patients with AML, the best alternative donor remains to be defined. We analyze outcomes of patients who underwent myeloablative umbilical cord blood or haploidentical hemopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) in Spain. Fifty-one patients underwent single umbilical cord blood transplantation supported by a third party donor (Haplo-Cord) between 1999 and 2012, and 36 patients received an haploidentical HSCT with post-transplant cyclophosphamide (PTCY-haplo) between 2012 and 2014 in GETH centers. The Haplo-Cord cohort included a higher proportion of patients with high disease risk index and use of TBI in the conditioning regimen, and hematopoietic cell transplantation-age Comorbidity Age Index was higher in PTCY-haplo patients. Cumulative incidence of neutrophil engraftment was 97% in the Haplo-Cord and 100% in the PTCY-haplo group, achieved in a median of 12 and 17 days, respectively (P=0.01). Grade II-IV acute GvHD rate was significantly higher in the PTCY-haplo group (9.8% vs 29%, P=0.02) as well as chronic GvHD rates (20% vs 38%, P=0.03). With a median follow-up of 61 months for the Haplo-Cord group and 26 months for the PTCY-haplo cohort, overall survival at 2 years was 55% and 59% (P=0.66), event-free survival was 45% vs 56% (P=0.46), relapse rate was 27% vs 21% (P=0.79), and non-relapse mortality was 17% vs 23% (P=0.54), respectively. In this multicenter experience, Haplo-Cord and PTCY-haplo HSCT offer valid alternatives for patients with AML. Neutrophil engraftment was faster in the Haplo-Cord cohort, with similar survival rates, with higher GvHD rates after haploidentical HSCT.Bone Marrow Transplantation advance online publication, 27 March 2017; doi:10.1038/bmt.2017.36.
The appearance of meningeal carcinomatosis in breast cancer is an event that is being reported increasingly more frequently in the literature. It seems to be related with the lengthening of the patients' lives, improved sensitivity to diagnostic imaging and impermeability of the blood-brain barrier to the chemotherapeutic agents. It is an evolutionary form that affirms the metastatic invasion of the subarachnoidal space and is correlated with limited survival. Its diagnosis is difficult, due to the lack of specificity of the clinical signs dominated by headaches, cognitive disorders and possible signs and symptoms of progressive focal lesions. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and the spinal cord interpreted by a specialist in neuro-oncology is the preferred examination in this indication, in the search for an increase in meningeal enhancement. Biological analysis of the cerebrospinal fluid is an essential element in the diagnosis. In addition to the biochemical study, the presence of neoplastic cells is in itself enough to confirm the diagnosis. False negatives are very common and represent an important diagnostic problem that entails the need to repeat the lumbar punctures. The therapeutic methods are standard, often invasive, dominated by intrathecal chemotherapy and are based on low-level scientific evidence. This study analyses the epidemiology, the prognostic factors, the diagnostic tools, currently available treatments and the possible future therapies of meningeal carcinomatosis in breast cancer.
Carcinomatosis meningea en el cancer de mama: del diagnostico al tratamiento.
La aparicion de carcinomatosis meningea en el cancer de mama es un suceso cada vez mas comunicado en la bibliografia. Parece relacionarse con el alargamiento de la vida de las pacientes, la mejor sensibilidad al diagnostico por imagen y la impermeabilidad de la barrera hematoencefalica a los agentes quimioterapicos. Es una forma evolutiva que afirma la invasion metastasica del espacio subaracnoideo y se correlaciona con una supervivencia limitada. El diagnostico es dificil, debido a la inespecificidad de los signos clinicos dominados por cefaleas, trastornos cognitivos, y posibles sintomas y signos de lesiones focales progresivas. La resonancia magnetica del cerebro y de la medula espinal interpretada por un especialista en neurooncologia es el examen de eleccion en esta indicacion, en busqueda de un incremento en la captacion meningea. El analisis biologico del liquido cefalorraquideo es un elemento esencial en el diagnostico. Ademas del estudio bioquimico, la presencia de celulas neoplasicas es por si sola suficiente para confirmar el diagnostico. El numero de falsos negativos es muy comun y representa un gran problema diagnostico que requiere una repeticion de las punciones lumbares. Los metodos terapeuticos son estandares, a menudo invasivos, dominados por la quimioterapia intratecal y se basan sobre una evidencia cientifica de bajo nivel. Se analiza la epidemiologia, los factores pronosticos, las herramientas diagnosticas, los tratamientos disponibles en la actualidad y las posibles terapias futuras de la carcinomatosis meningea en el cancer de mama.
The Kleine-Levin syndrome is a rare disease of unknown origin characterized by recurrent and self-limited episodes of hypersomnia that are also accompanied by a cognitive and behavioral dysfunction. Patients present normal sleeping and behavior patterns between episodes.
We present three patients who are 14 years old: two boys and one girl. They started having the episodes after a predisposing factor (vaccine, influenza B and menstruation). During the episode they presented hypersomnolence and while wakefulness they were bradipsychic, in motor restlessness and with emotional liability. They also presented a tendency towards crying and claimed the presence of relatives constantly. The episodes lasted between 10 and 15 days and they appeared monthly, being asymptomatic between episodes. All three patients were attended initially by pediatricians, diagnosed and treated as autoimmune encephalitis. Only one of our cases had the three typical symptoms of hypersomnia, hyperfagia and hypersexuality. However, none of the three had been asked initially and the family only referred to it after the directed anamnesis.
The Kleine-Levin syndrome presents neurologic symptoms initially more frequently than psychiatric ones. Hypersomnia and behavioural disturbances during wakefulness, bradypsychia, apatheia and emotional liability make us suspect that it could be an encephalitis process. We should be aware of this entity if we face a patient with recurrent encephalitis of unknown origin.
Sindrome de Kleine-Levin: diagnostico diferencial en los sindromes encefaliticos recurrentes del adolescente.
Introduccion. El sindrome de Kleine-Levin es una enfermedad rara de causa desconocida que se caracteriza por episodios recurrentes autolimitados de hipersomnia acompañados de alteracion cognitiva y conductual. Entre los episodios, los pacientes tienen un patron de sueño y cognitivo normal. Casos clinicos. Se presentan tres pacientes de 14 años, dos chicos y una chica. Comenzaron tras un desencadenante (vacuna, una infeccion respiratoria por influenza B; en el caso de la chica, coincidian con la menstruacion). En el episodio agudo mostraban tendencia al sueño y en vigilia destacaba bradipsiquia, inquietud motora y gran labilidad emocional, con tendencia al llanto y necesidad de la presencia de los familiares. Presentaron una duracion aproximada de 10-15 dias y periodicidad mensual, y se mostraron asintomaticos entre los episodios. Los tres pacientes fueron valorados por pediatras, diagnosticados y tratados de encefalitis autoinmune. Solo uno cumplia la triada tipica de hipersomnia, hiperfagia e hipersexualidad, pero ninguno de los tres datos se habia recogido en la historia clinica inicial y la familia solo lo referia tras una anamnesis dirigida. Conclusiones. En el sindrome de Kleine-Levin, los sintomas neurologicos durante el cuadro agudo son aun mas frecuentes que los psiquiatricos. La tendencia al sueño y el hecho de que durante la vigilia no esten asintomaticos y se muestren lentos, apaticos, labiles e irascibles, situa en primer lugar la sospecha de sindrome encefalitico. Debemos tener presente esta entidad en encefalitis recurrentes de etiologia no filiada.
Cavernous malformations are vascular malformations of the central nervous system formed by a group of capillaries not covered by pia mater and communicated to the vascular system at very low pressure with very slow flow. Surgery or radiosurgery are the treatment modalities.
To analyze our results after surgical treatment of supratentorial cavernous malformations, reviewing clinical presentation, surgical indications and postoperative complications.
Analytical retrospective study of medical records and images of patients who underwent resection of supratentorial cavernomas at FLENI from January 1996 until December 2013.
We evaluated 51 patients, mean age 34 years, followed for an average of 30 months. In 1.96% of patients diagnosis was incidental, the rest all presented symptoms. Bleeding at diagnosis was observed in 23.52%. Total excision of supratentorial cavernous malformations was possible in all cases. The only postoperative complication was one case of meningitis.
The bleeding rate of supratentorial cavernous malformations in our series was 1.38% per patient per year. Surgical treatment effectively eliminated, or at least reduced symptoms, prevented rebleeding, and decreased need for antiepileptic drug therapy. Surgery have a low complication rate and good outcome.
Malformaciones cavernosas supratentoriales en una institucion argentina: experiencia del tratamiento quirurgico.
Introduccion. Las malformaciones cavernosas son lesiones vasculares del sistema nervioso central constituidas por endotelio sinusoidal que forma capilares agrupados o cavernas que carecen de los elementos tipicos de una pared arterial madura y ausencia de tejido neural interpuesto. El endotelio esta rodeado por una densa capa de fibras colagenas que dejan pequeñas hendiduras por las que se extravasa hemosiderina. Se comunican con el sistema vascular a muy baja presion y su tratamiento puede ser por microcirugia o radiocirugia. Objetivos. Analizar las malformaciones cavernosas supratentoriales tratadas quirurgicamente en nuestra institucion (FLENI), determinar la epidemiologia y las caracteristicas intrinsecas, estudiar la clinica de presentacion, determinar las indicaciones quirurgicas y complicaciones, y establecer el pronostico. Pacientes y metodos. Estudio retrospectivo analitico de historias clinicas e imagenes de pacientes operados de malformaciones cavernosas supratentoriales en la FLENI desde enero de 1996 hasta diciembre de 2013. Resultados. Evaluamos a 51 pacientes, de 34 años de media, seguidos durante una media de 30 meses. El 1,96% de los pacientes presento diagnostico incidental y el resto mostro sintomas. El 23,52% presento hemorragia en el momento del diagnostico. En todas las cirugias se logro una exeresis total de las malformaciones cavernosas supratentoriales. Se observo un caso de meningitis postoperatoria. Conclusiones. La tasa de sangrado de las malformaciones cavernosas supratentoriales en nuestro medio es del 1,38% por paciente por año. El tratamiento quirurgico es eficaz para erradicar o disminuir los sintomas y para evitar un posible resangrado. Presenta una tasa muy baja de complicaciones y un pronostico neurologico favorable.
Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a common neurological disease. RLS has been linked to various psychiatric disorders, especially with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).
The main objective was to describe the frequency of RLS in pediatric patients diagnosed with ADHD. Secondary objectives of the study were describe other sleep disorders in ADHD patients.
A multicentre prospective study was conducted in nine Spanish centers. We included children aged 6-18 years diagnosed with ADHD between January and June 2015. Data were collected by 13 researchers doctors through an interview with the parent/caregiver and with the child. To assess the degree of functioning of patients with ADHD we used the Children's Global Assessment Scale. The Sleep Disturbance Scale for Children was applied to screening sleep disorders in childhood.
A sample of 73 patients was collected. Five patients (6.8%) met diagnostic criteria for RLS: four of them definitive and one probable.
RLS is a frequent condition in adulthood but also in adolescence and childhood. ADHD patients have an increased risk of an RLS.

Immunological characterization of HIV-infected subjects with low CD4-recovery (LR-subjects) has been extensively performed after a variable period of combined antiretroviral therapy (cART). We now explore immunological alterations present before the cART onset. In a case-control study, we selected pre-cART samples of HIV-subjects with and without low CD4-recovery after cART (n = 21 per group). CD4 T-cell activation, senescence and exhaustion related markers were not found specifically altered before cART initiation. On the other hand, we found that LR-subjects before cART already showed increased levels of IL6 (p = 0.009) and increased frequencies of Ki67 + CD4(+) T-cells (p = 0.026), CD45RA-CD27+CD4(+) T-cells (p = 0.008) and Treg (p = 0.001), as well as increased expression of CD95 and CD127 on CD4 T-cells (p = 0.016; p = 0.032, respectively). These parameters characterize the immunological damage in LR-subjects before the cART onset and could be associated to the mechanisms hindering the subsequent CD4 recovery.
Myocardial interstitial fibrosis, a hallmark of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), has been proposed as an arrhythmic substrate. Fibrosis is associated with increased extracellular volume (ECV), which can be quantified by computed tomography (CT). We aimed to analyze the association between CT-determined ECV and malignant ventricular arrhythmias.
A retrospective case-control observational study was conducted in HCM patients with implantable cardioverter-defibrillator, undergoing a CT-protocol with continuous iodine contrast infusion to determine equilibrium ECV. Left ventricular septal and lateral CT-determined ECV was compared between prespecified cases (malignant arrhythmia any time before CT scan) and controls (no prior malignant arrhythmias) and among ECV tertiles.
A total of 78 implantable cardioverter-defibrillator HCM patients were included; 24 were women, with a mean age of 52.1 ± 15.6 years. Mean ECV ± standard deviation in the septal left ventricular wall and was 29.8% ± 6.3% in cases (n = 24) vs 31.9% ± 8.5% in controls (n = 54); P = .282. Mean ECV in the lateral wall was 24.5% ± 6.8% in cases vs 28.2% ± 7.4% in controls; P = .043. On comparison of the entire population according to septal ECV tertiles, no significant differences were found in the number of patients receiving appropriate shocks. Conversely, we found a trend (P = .056) for a higher number of patients receiving appropriate shocks in the lateral ECV lowest tertile.
Extracellular volume was not increased in implantable cardioverter-defibrillator HCM patients with malignant ventricular arrhythmias vs those without arrhythmias. Our findings do not support the use of ECV (a surrogate of diffuse fibrosis) as a predictor of arrhythmias in high-risk HCM patients.
Ambient air pollution is becoming more severe worldwide, posing a serious threat to human health. Fine airborne particles of particulate matter (PM2.5) show higher cytotoxicity than other coarse fractions. Indeed, PM2.5 induces cardiovascular or respiratory damage; however, few studies have evaluated the detrimental effect of PM2.5 to normal human skin. We used a next-generation sequencing-based (RNA-Seq) method with transcriptome and Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis to determine the harmful influences of PM2.5 on human normal epidermal keratinocytes. DAVID analysis showed that the most significantly enriched GO terms were associated with epidermis-related biological processes such as "epidermis development (GO: 0008544)" and "keratinocyte differentiation (GO: 0030216)", suggesting that PM2.5 has some deleterious effects to the human epidermis. In addition, Ingenuity Pathway Analysis predicted inflammation-related signaling as one of the major PM2.5-induced signaling pathways, and pro-inflammatory cytokines as upstream regulators with symptoms similar to psoriasis as downstream effects. PM2.5 caused considerable changes in the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and psoriatic skin disease-related genes, might lead to epidermal dysfunctions. Our results might help to understand the mechanism of air pollution-induced skin barrier perturbation and contribute to the development of a new strategy for the prevention or recovery of the consequent damage.
Laparoscopic donor nephrectomy is widely used to retrieve a kidney for transplantation. Preoperative evaluation of the donor is of crucial importance to the recipient. In particular, vascular anatomy should be assessed with the help of modern imaging modalities. We present a hand-assisted laparoscopic nephrectomy of a kidney donor with a complete duplex vena cava.
A 40-year-old male patient was admitted to our clinic as a kidney donor for his 20-year-old son. After the preliminary tests, further imaging with the use of computerized tomographic angiography showed a complete duplex vena cava. He had no morbidities or previous surgeries. A hand-assisted transperitoneal laparoscopic left nephrectomy was performed as the kidney removal technique commonly used in our center. There was minimal blood loss, and the warm ischemia time was 66 minutes. Operation time was 265 minutes. After transplantation had been performed, graft functions were good with normal urine output. Blood sample tests were in normal ranges. The live donor was discharged on the 7th day after the procedure without any complications.
Although renal vascular anomalies are rarely seen, they have a significant impact on the outcomes of the renal transplantation. Knowing the vascular anatomy minimizes the complications risk and increases the success rate. Laparoscopic live-donor nephrectomy can be performed safely, even in patients with vascular anomalies.
Fertility traits, such as heifer pregnancy, are economically important in cattle production systems, and are therefore, used in genetic selection programs. The aim of this study was to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) using RNA-sequencing (RNA-Seq) data from ovary, uterus, endometrium, pituitary gland, hypothalamus, liver, longissimus dorsi muscle, and adipose tissue in 62 candidate genes associated with heifer puberty in cattle. RNA-Seq reads were assembled to the bovine reference genome (UMD 3.1.1) and analyzed in five cattle breeds; Brangus, Brahman, Nellore, Angus, and Holstein. Two approaches used the Brangus data for SNP discovery 1) pooling all samples, and 2) within each individual sample. These approaches revealed 1157 SNPs. These were compared with those identified in the pooled samples of the other breeds. Overall, 172 SNPs within 13 genes (CPNE5, FAM19A4, FOXN4, KLF1, LOC777593, MGC157266, NEBL, NRXN3, PEPT-1, PPP3CA, SCG5, TSG101, and TSHR) were concordant in the five breeds. Using Ensembl's Variant Effector Predictor, we determined that 12% of SNPs were in exons (71% synonymous, 29% nonsynonymous), 1% were in untranslated regions (UTRs), 86% were in introns, and 1% were in intergenic regions. Since these SNPs were discovered in RNA, the variants were predicted to be within exons or UTRs. Overall, 160 novel transcripts in 42 candidate genes and five novel genes overlapping five candidate genes were observed. In conclusion, 1157 SNPs were identified in 62 candidate genes associated with puberty in Brangus cattle, of which, 172 were concordant in the five cattle breeds. Novel transcripts and genes were also identified.
We conducted a meta-analysis to examine p16INK4a expression in uterine smooth muscle tumors (USMTs). Although the prognostic value of tumor suppressor p16INK4a has been elucidated in a variety of cancers and precancerous lesions, its role in USMTs is not well established. We searched PubMed, Web of Science, and Embase for publication son p16INK4a expression in USMTs. Strict inclusion and exclusion criteria were imposed. Risk ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (95%CIs) were calculated to assess the strength of association. Publication bias was estimated using funnel plots and the Egger's regression test. Twelve eligible studies comprising 661 patients were included. Compared with leiomyoma (LM), the figures for the strength of association were as follows: LM variants (RR = 1.53, 95%CI = 1.03-2.27, P = 0.036, random effect); leiomyosarcoma (LMS) (RR = 3.20, 95%CI = 1.68-6.12, P &lt; 0.001, random effect); and smooth muscle tumors of uncertain malignant potential (STUMP) (RR = 2.90, 95%CI = 1.17-7.21, P = 0.022, random effect). p16INK4a expression was significantly higher in LMS than in LM variants (RR = 3.74, 95%CI = 1.96-7.13, P &lt; 0.001, random effect) or STUMP (RR = 1.67, 95%CI = 1.26-2.23, P &lt; 0.001, fixed effect). There was a significant correlation between overexpressed p16INK4a and recurrence rates of USMTs (RR = 1.85, 95%CI = 1.11-3.10, P = 0.019, fixed effect). p16INK4a over expression is a potential biomarker for diagnosing problematic USMTs and it might indicate a worse prognosis. However, there is currently insufficient evidence to assess the prognostic value of p16INK4a in USMTs.
There is a dearth of information on the quality of health care for Asian American children and particularly Asian children with special health care needs (CSHCN). The goal of this article was to determine whether there were disparities in quality of health care for Asian CSHCN, whose experiences have not been studied. Data were derived from the 2009-2010 National Survey of Children with Special Health Care Needs (ns = 355 non-Hispanic Asian children and 4,343 non-Hispanic white CSHCN). Bivariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were conducted to examine the relationship between racial identity (that is, non-Hispanic white and non-Hispanic Asian) and quality of health care. Racial disparities in quality of health care were substantial between Asian and white CSHCN in 2009-2010. Asian parents were significantly less likely than white parents to report that their health care provider provided the specific information they needed, helped them feel like a partner in their child's care, and was sensitive to the family's values and customs. The development and testing of specific, targeted policy and practice interventions to reduce disparities in health care quality for these children are urgently needed.
A broiler study was performed to determine the pre-cecal phosphorus (P) digestibility of 5 P sources, 3 from animal (Delfos, Calfos, and porcine bone meal) and 2 of inorganic (monocalcium phosphate [MCP] and dicalcium phosphate [DCP]) origin. Delfos is processed from bones resulting in a dicalcium phosphate product, and Calfos is processed from bones in which part of the gelatin is removed but in which the hydroxy-apatite matrix is preserved. During the first 14 d, birds were housed in floor pens bedded with wood shavings and received a commercial starter diet. At d 14, broilers were randomly assigned to pens (0.9 m2, 10 birds/pen) with a slatted floor. From d 14 onwards, one of the 6 experimental diets (a basal diet, and 5 diets containing the P sources) was provided. Test diets were replicated 6 times, and the basal diet 8 times. Electron microscopy images of test products were made in order to verify whether the spatial structure of the test products could be related to the pre-cecal P digestibility of the same products. Diets met or exceeded CVB (2011) requirements for all nutrients except for P and were formulated to contain a calcium to total P ratio of between 1.4 and 1.6 and a minimal amount of phytate P. Diets contained 5 g/kg titanium oxide as a marker to determine digestibility of P. At d 24 all birds were euthanized, after which the content of the terminal part of the ileum was sampled. The P digestibility was calculated by linear regression according to World's Poultry Science Association (WPSA) protocol for determination of pre-cecal P digestibility. Pre-cecal P digestibility of MCP, DCP, Delfos, Calfos, and porcine bone meal was 88.5, 82.4, 94.5, 86.9, and 78.2%, respectively. Based on visual inspection of electron microscopy images of test products, the spatial structure of the test products might be related to P digestibility. It is concluded that processing of bone meal increases the pre-cecal P digestibility in broilers.
The aim of this study was to investigate the therapeutic effects of three different cellulose membranes (CMs) manufactured from Styela clava tunics (SCTs) on the healing of cutaneous wounds. We examined the physical properties and therapeutic effects of three CMs regenerated from SCTs (referred to as SCT‑ CMs), including normal CM (SCT‑CM), freeze-dried SCT‑CM (FSCT‑CM) and sodium alginate-supplemented SCT‑CM (ASCT‑CM) on skin regeneration and angiogenesis using Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats. FSCT‑CM exhibited an outstanding interlayered structure, a high tensile strength (1.64 MPa), low elongation (28.59%) and a low water vapor transmission rate (WVTR) compared with the other SCT-CMs, although the fluid uptake rate was maintained at a medium level. In the SD rats with surgically wounded skin, the wound area and score of wound edge were lower in the FSCT‑CM-treated group than in the gauze (GZ)-treated group on days 3-6 and 12-14. In addition, a significant attenuation in the histopathological changes was observed in the FSCT‑CM-treated group. Furthermore, the expression level of collagen-1 and the signaling pathway of transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1 were significantly stimulated by the topical application of FSCT‑CM. However, no signs of toxicity were detected in the livers or kidneys of the three SCT‑CM-treated groups. Overall, our data indicate that the FSCT‑CM may accelerate the process of wound healing in the surgically wounded skin of SD rats through the regulation of angiogenesis and connective tissue formation without inducing any specific toxicity.
A cooperative cognitive radio scheme exploiting primary signals for energy harvesting is proposed. The relay sensor node denoted as the secondary transmitter (ST) harvests energy from the primary signal transmitted from the primary transmitter, and then uses it to transmit power superposed codes of the secrecy signal of the secondary network (SN) and of the primary signal of the primary network (PN). The harvested energy is split into two parts according to a power splitting ratio, one for decoding the primary signal and the other for charging the battery. In power superposition coding, the amount of fractional power allocated to the primary signal is determined by another power allocation parameter (e.g., the power sharing coefficient). Our main concern is to investigate the impact of the two power parameters on the performances of the PN and the SN. Analytical or mathematical expressions of the outage probabilities of the PN and the SN are derived in terms of the power parameters, location of the ST, channel gain, and other system related parameters. A jointly optimal power splitting ratio and power sharing coefficient for achieving target outage probabilities of the PN and the SN, are found using these expressions and validated by simulations.
Bone remodeling, a physiological process characterized by bone formation by osteoblasts and bone resorption by osteoclasts, is important for the maintenance of healthy bone in adult humans. Osteoclasts play a critical role in bone erosion and osteoporosis and are bone-specific multinucleated cells generated through differentiation of monocyte/macrophage lineage precursors. Receptor activator of NF-κB ligand (RANKL) has been reported to induce osteoclast differentiation. In this study, we explored whether Gracilaria verrucosa extracts (GE) could affect RANKL-mediated osteoclast differentiation. GE significantly inhibited RANKL-activated osteoclast differentiation by inhibiting protein expression of c-fos and nuclear factor of activated T-cells, cytoplasmic 1 (NFATc1), vital factors in RANKL-mediated osteoclastogenesis. In addition, GE attenuated ovariectomy-induced bone loss in mice. In summary, GE can prevent osteoclastogenesis and hormone-related bone loss via blockage of c-fos-NFATc1 signaling. Our results suggest that GE may have therapeutic potential in the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis.
Regional volume atrophy and functional degeneration are key imaging hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD) in structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), respectively. We jointly explored regional volume atrophy and functional connectivity to better characterize neuroimaging data of AD and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). All data were obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. We compared regional volume atrophy and functional connectivity in 10 subcortical regions using structural MRI and resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI). Neuroimaging data of normal controls (NC) (n = 35), MCI (n = 40), and AD (n = 30) were compared. Significant differences of regional volumes and functional connectivity measures between groups were assessed using permutation tests in 10 regions. The regional volume atrophy and functional connectivity of identified regions were used as features for the random forest classifier to distinguish among three groups. The features of the identified regions were also regarded as connectional fingerprints that could distinctively separate a given group from the others. We identified a few regions with distinctive regional atrophy and functional connectivity patterns for NC, MCI, and AD groups. A three label classifier using the information of regional volume atrophy and functional connectivity of identified regions achieved classification accuracy of 53.33% to distinguish among NC, MCI, and AD. We identified distinctive regional atrophy and functional connectivity patterns that could be regarded as a connectional fingerprint.
Are boys who are born to mothers who use analgesics during pregnancy at increased risk of cryptorchidism compared to those born to mothers who do not take analgesia?
In this systematic review and meta-analysis of 10 published studies, we observed only weak evidence of an association between analgesia use during pregnancy and risk of cryptorchidism in the son.
Concentrations of analgesia relevant to human exposure have been implicated as causing endocrine disturbances in the developing foetal testis. However, when viewed collectively there appears to be conflicting evidence regarding an association between maternal use of analgesics and development of cryptorchidism.
A systematic review and meta-analysis of studies on analgesia use during pregnancy and risk of cryptorchidism was performed. The search terms used were (analges* OR paracetamol OR acetaminophen) AND (cryptorchidism OR cryptorchism OR undescended test* OR non-descended test* OR non descended test*) for the databases Ovid Medline, Embase, Scopus and Web of Science. The search included all published articles up until 23 May 2016 and no limits were set in terms of language.
Abstracts were screened by one reviewer to remove irrelevant studies, with a 10% random sample of these verified by a second reviewer. The full text of all remaining papers was assessed by two reviewers. Abstracts included in the final analysis were studies which reported associations between the exposure (analgesia) and the outcome (cryptorchidism). Studies were only included if data were provided from which summary associations (odds ratios (ORs) or relative risks) and their 95% CIs could be calculated, or if summary associations were provided by the authors themselves. For each included study, two reviewers independently extracted study meta-data in line with PRISMA recommendations. We assessed study quality and potential for bias using the criteria outlined in the Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale, but did not determine a quality score. Two reviewers independently assessed study quality against these criteria.
After screening 350 manuscripts, 10 were included in our review (5 case-control studies, 5 cohort studies). We observed weak evidence of an association between ever use of analgesia and risk of cryptorchidism (pooled crude OR: 1.11, 95% CI: 1.00-1.23), with case-control studies revealing a marginally stronger association (1.23, 95% CI: 0.85-1.78) than cohort studies (1.09, 95% CI: 0.97-1.22). We observed weak evidence of a dose-response relationship between increasing weeks of analgesia exposure and risk of cryptorchidism, as well as weak evidence of an effect of timing on analgesia exposure and risk of cryptorchidism. Assessment of study quality via the Newcastle-Ottawa criteria revealed little (if any) evidence of substantial bias that may have meaningfully affected a given study's results.
While confounding does not appear to be important, misclassification of the exposure is possibly an important source of measurement error in this context. The systematic review is open to reporting bias. Owing to scant data, no meta-analyses for two key questions (relating to dose-response and timing of exposure) could be performed. Medications were grouped based on their common effect and this offers little insight into the relation between specific types of analgesia and cryptorchidism. Finally, there are limitations in assuming that analgesia use reported by mothers is synonymous with actual intrauterine exposure.
The ubiquity of analgesia use during pregnancy makes this exposure particularly important from a population health perspective. About 9 of the 10 studies were conducted in Europe or USA, limiting generalizability of our observations. While the observations from our systematic review and meta-analysis suggest that analgesia use during pregnancy is not strongly associated with cryptorchidism development in the son, they also highlight the need for further detailed assessments of this relationship.

Chronic kidney disease is among the fastest growing causes of death worldwide. An increased risk of all-cause and cardiovascular death is thought to depend on the accumulation of uremic toxins when glomerular filtration rate falls. In addition, the circulating levels of several markers of inflammation predict mortality in patients with chronic kidney disease. Indeed, a number of cytokines are listed in databases of uremic toxins and uremic retention solutes. They include inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-18, IL-6, TNFα), chemokines (IL-8), and adipokines (adiponectin, leptin and resistin), as well as anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-10). We now critically review the cytokines that may be considered uremic toxins. We discuss the rationale to consider them uremic toxins (mechanisms underlying the increased serum levels and evidence supporting their contribution to CKD manifestations), identify gaps in knowledge, discuss potential therapeutic implications to be tested in clinical trials in order to make this knowledge useful for the practicing physician, and identify additional cytokines, cytokine receptors and chemokines that may fulfill the criteria to be considered uremic toxins, such as sIL-6R, sTNFR1, sTNFR2, IL-2, CXCL12, CX3CL1 and others. In addition, we suggest that IL-10, leptin, adiponectin and resistin should not be considered uremic toxins toxins based on insufficient or contradictory evidence of an association with adverse outcomes in humans or preclinical data not consistent with a causal association.
Hereditary hyperplastic gingivitis (HHG) is an autosomal recessive condition found predominantly in farmed silver foxes, first documented in Europe in the 1940s. Hereditary gingival fibromatosis (HGF) is an analogous condition occurring in humans. HGF has a heterogeneous aetiology with emphasis placed on the autosomal dominant forms of inheritance for which there are three known loci: HGF1, HGF2, and HGF3. Among these, only one causative mutation has been determined, in the Son of sevenless homolog 1 (SOS1) gene. The goal of this study was to explore potential molecular or cellular mechanisms underlying HHG by analysis of global gene expression patterns from Affymetrix Canine 2.0 microarrays cross-referenced against candidate genes within the human loci. We conclude that the SOS1 gene involved in HGF1 is not significantly up-regulated in HHG. However, the structurally and functionally similar SOS2 gene is up-regulated in affected foxes, and we propose this as a candidate gene for HHG. At HGF2 we identify RASA1 (rat sarcoma viral p21 protein activator 1) as a candidate gene for HHG, as it is up-regulated in affected foxes and is involved in MAPK signalling. From comparison to the genes within the HGF3 locus, we find evidence for a role of androgens in HHG phenotype severity by differential up-regulation of SRD5A2 in HHG-affected foxes. We hypothesize that the putative mutation occurs upstream of RAS in the extracellular signal-regulated kinase component of MAPK signalling.
Hereditary hyperplastic gingivitis (HHG) is an autosomal recessive disease that presents with progressive gingival proliferation in farmed silver foxes. Hereditary gingival fibromatosis (HGF) is an analogous condition in humans that is genetically heterogeneous with several known autosomal dominant loci. For one locus the causative mutation is in the Son of sevenless homologue 1 (SOS1) gene. For the remaining loci, the molecular mechanisms are unknown but Ras pathway involvement is suspected. Here we compare sequences for the SOS1 gene, and two adjacent genes in the Ras pathway, growth receptor bound protein 2 (GRB2) and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), between HHG-affected and unaffected foxes. We conclude that the known HGF causative mutation does not cause HHG in foxes, nor do the coding regions or intron-exon boundaries of these three genes contain any candidate mutations for fox gum disease. Patterns of molecular evolution among foxes and other mammals reflect high conservation and strong functional constraints for SOS1 and GRB2 but reveal a lineage-specific pattern of variability in EGFR consistent with mutational rate differences, relaxed functional constraints, and possibly positive selection.
Non-syndromic hereditary gingival fibromatosis (HGF) is a rare condition, characterized by a progressive gingival hyperplasia that occurs as an isolated disease. Hitherto, only one insertion (g.126,142-126,143insC) in son-of-sevenless-1 (SOS1) gene has been associated with non-syndromic HGF in a Brazilian family. The aim of the present study was to determine if SOS1 is the causative gene of non-syndromic HGF in the Chinese population. Peripheral blood samples were collected from six affected and seven unaffected individuals from three Chinese families with history of non-syndromic HGF. Genomic DNA was extracted and SOS1 gene exons were sequenced. Neither g.126,142-126,143insC nor any other novel mutation was detected in SOS1 gene. Our results suggest that the SOS1 may not be the gene responsible for HGF in these three Chinese families and, therefore, it is possible that other genes are involved in the manifestation of HGF in these Chinese HGF families.
Hereditary gingival fibromatosis (HGF) and amelogenesis imperfecta (AI) are two rare oral conditions with genetic etiologies. The case of a 17-year-old boy affected by HGF, AI, anterior open bite, and pyramidal impaction of the maxillary molars is reported. Internal bevel gingivectomies were carried out to reduce gingival overgrowth. Clinical examination of the family revealed the presence of HGF and AI in his 12-year-old sister (both in milder forms) and of HGF in his older half brother. Genetic sequencing analyses were performed to detect any of the known mutations leading to HGF and AI. Histologic analysis revealed the presence of fibroepithelial hyperplasia, consistent with a diagnosis of GF. Sequencing genetic analysis failed to identify any of the common mutations leading to HGF (SOS-1) or AI (enamelin and amelogenin genes). This phenotype, similar to what has been described in other families, may represent a new syndrome caused by an as-yet unknown genotype.
Hereditary gingival fibromatosis (HGF) is a rare benign disorder characterized by progressive overgrowth of gingiva. Although the clinical and histopathologic characteristics of HGF are explicit, the pathogenic mechanism remains unclear. The goal of this article is to describe a three-generation HGF case and discuss the diagnosis, treatment, and inheritance of the disease. The known cellular and molecular features of HGF are also emphasized.
Family and medical histories of the patients were recorded, and a series of preliminary examinations, including clinical, histologic, radiographic, and gene examination, were performed to make a diagnosis and learn about the genetic characteristics. An all-quadrant flap surgery was performed to remove excess gingiva, and orthodontic treatment was undertaken to help tooth eruption. Recent advances were reviewed for further knowledge of genetic, cellular, and molecular features of HGF.
The patient's manifestations and examinations showed a typical HGF characteristic. There was no recurrence after surgery, and the premolars and molars erupted to bite plane. Genetic studies have found several gene mutations involved in HGF. Only the son-of-sevenless-1 gene is identified. Multiple molecular factors, such as transforming growth factor-β and matrix metalloproteinases, participate in HGF, regulating the extracellular matrix.
Surgical intervention is the usual treatment of HGF, but patients still have to deal with the risk of recurrence. Once the correlations between gene mutations, molecular changes, histology, and clinical situation are clear, they can be applied to clinical application, providing novel methods for disease prognosis and diagnosis and targets for disease prevention and treatment.
Hereditary gingival fibromatosis (HGF) is a rare, clinically variable disorder characterized by slowly progressive fibrous overgrowth of the gingiva. Four gene loci have been mapped for autosomal dominant non-syndromic HGF (adHGF). The molecular basis of adHGF remains largely unknown, with only a single SOS1 gene mutation identified so far at the gingival fibromatosis 1 (GINGF1) locus in one family. We identified an adHGF family with ten affected individuals in whom onset of gingival fibromatosis concurred with the eruption of the primary teeth. In order to identify the molecular basis in this family, we tested for linkage of the disease to known adHGF loci. A maximal multipoint logarithm of the odds score of 3.91 was obtained with marker D2S390 (theta = 0) at the GINGF3 locus on chromosome 2p23.3-p22.3, and linkage to other known loci was excluded. Sequencing two candidate genes, ALK and C2orf18, and a single nucleotide polymorphisms array analysis did not reveal a mutation or copy number variation in a patient from the family. We refined the GINGF3 locus to a 6.56-cM, 8.27-Mb region containing 112 known and hypothetical genes, and our data and a search of the literature suggest that GINGF3 is a major adHGF locus.
Hereditary gingival fibromatosis (HGF) is a rare gingival lesion that presents as localized or generalized enlargement of the attached gingiva. The gingiva is characterized as pink, firm, and very fibrous, with little tendency to bleed. HGF can present as an isolated feature or as part of a syndrome. Recent findings report a defect in the Son of sevenless-1 gene on chromosome 2p21-p22 (HGF1) as a possible cause of this clinical presentation. HGF inheritance is transmitted through both autosomal dominant and recessive modes. While clinicians disagree on the modalities and timing of treatment for HGF, the clinical condition generally requires repeated resective periodontal surgical procedures over the patient's lifetime. This article reviews differential diagnosis, etiology, complications, and treatment of HGF.
Hereditary gingival fibromatosis (HGF) is a rare condition that can occur as an isolated disease or as part of a syndrome or chromosomal abnormality. In severe cases, the gingival enlargement may cover the crowns of teeth and cause severe functional and esthetic concerns. Histological and cell culture studies have uncovered some of the molecular and cellular changes associated with HGF. However, the pathogenesis of the disease is still largely unknown. Recent studies about the genetic characteristics of HGF have provided novel clues about the potential pathogenic mechanisms. In particular, mutation in the son-of-sevenless (SOS-1) gene has been associated with one form of the disease. However, HGF displays genetic heterogeneity, and mutations in other genes are also likely involved. This review outlines the current knowledge about the histological, cellular, and genetic characteristics of HGF. In addition, the potential role of the SOS-1 molecule and related novel intracellular signaling pathways in the pathogenesis of HGF will be discussed.
Although non-syndromic hereditary gingival fibromatosis (HGF) is genetically heterogeneous, etiologic mutations have been identified only in the Son of Sevenless-1 gene (SOS1). To test evidence of increased cell proliferation, we studied histological, morphological, and proliferation characteristics in monolayer and three-dimensional cultures of fibroblasts with the SOS1 g.126,142-126,143insC mutation. Histological assessment of HGF gingiva indicated increased numbers of fibroblasts (30%) and increased collagen (10%). Cell proliferation studies demonstrated increased growth rates and 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine incorporation for HGF fibroblasts. Flow cytometry showed greater proportions of HGF fibroblasts in the G2/M phase. Attachment of HGF fibroblasts to different extracellular matrix surfaces demonstrated increased formation of protrusions with lamellipodia. HGF fibroblasts in three-dimensional culture showed greater cell proliferation, higher cell density, and alteration of surrounding collagen matrix. These findings revealed that increased fibroblast numbers and collagen matrix changes are associated with mutation of the SOS1 gene in vitro and in vivo.
The placenta is a highly specialized organ whose primary function is to promote the exchange of nutrients and oxygen between maternal and fetal blood, essential for survival and growth of the baby. The surface area for nutrient transport is a highly convoluted villous structure that forms by branching morphogenesis. In mice, this process begins after embryonic day 8.5, following attachment of allantoic mesoderm to the chorion, and continues through the end of gestation. Gene targeting studies in mice have identified a large number of genes that are essential for chorioallantoic development to give rise to the layer of the placenta called the labyrinth. Collectively, these studies reveal that a number of signaling pathways regulate four distinct phases of labyrinth development: chorioallantoic attachment (involving VCAM1 and its receptor alpha4 integrin, Bmp5/7, and Wnt7b, as well as the cochaperone Mrj), initiation of branching (involving the Gcm1 transcription factor to select sites of branch initiation), extension of villous branching (involving FGF, EGF, and HGF/Met signaling, through the Grb2/Sos1/Mek1/p38alpha MAPK pathway), followed by vascularization of the villous tree. The restricted expression and/or action of the signaling components indicate that a series of intercellular interactions regulate chorioallantoic development.
Hereditary gingival fibromatosis (HGF) is a rare, autosomal dominant form of gingival overgrowth. Affected individuals have a benign, slowly progressive, nonhemorrhagic, fibrous enlargement of the oral masticatory mucosa. Genetic loci for autosomal dominant forms of HGF have been localized to chromosome 2p21-p22 (HGF1) and chromosome 5q13-q22 (HGF2). To identify the gene responsible for HGF1, we extended genetic linkage studies to refine the chromosome 2p21-p22 candidate interval to approximately 2.3 Mb. Development of an integrated physical and genetic map of the interval identified 16 genes. Sequencing of these genes, in affected and unaffected HGF1 family members, identified a mutation in the Son of sevenless-1 (SOS1) gene in affected individuals. In this report, we describe the genomic structure of the SOS1 gene and present evidence that insertion of a cytosine between nucleotides 126,142 and 126,143 in codon 1083 of the SOS1 gene is responsible for HGF1. This insertion mutation, which segregates in a dominant manner over four generations, introduces a frameshift and creates a premature stop codon, abolishing four functionally important proline-rich SH3 binding domains normally present in the carboxyl-terminal region of the SOS1 protein. The resultant protein chimera contains the wild-type SOS1 protein for the N-terminal amino acids 1-1083 fused to a novel 22-amino acid carboxyl terminus. Similar SOS1 deletion constructs are functional in animal models, and a transgenic mouse construct with a comparable SOS1 chimera produces a phenotype with skin hypertrophy. Clarification of the functional role of this SOS1 mutant has implications for understanding other forms of gingival fibromatosis and corrective gingival-tissue management.
Although it is widely known that the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway stimulates cell growth and protects cells from death, recent findings have proposed a proapoptotic action of ERK phosphorylation. Because the authors found that vitamin K3 (VK3) was a potent growth inhibitor and an inducer for ERK phosphorylation through a specific pathway in the stomach cancer cell line, the critical role of ERK phosphorylation in VK(3)-mediated growth inhibitory effect was examined.
The fluorochrome Hoechst 33258 assay (Hoechst AG [now Aventis] Frankfort, Germany) was used for counting cells (excitation at 360 nm; emission at 460 nm). For two-dimensional electrophoresis, cells were dissolved in urea standard buffer and applied first to isoelectronic focusing gels. Cell lysates were subjected to sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) using 10% polyacrylamide gels. To examine the phosphorylation of receptors, cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with receptor antibody.
VK3 induced phosphorylation of hepatocyte growth factor receptor (c-met), epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), or external signal-regulated kinase (ERK), which increased progressively to a maximum level at 30 minutes, in a dose-dependent manner and occurred at growth inhibitory concentrations. VK(3)-mediated growth inhibition and protein tyrosine phosphorylation were nullified completely by glutathione or L-cysteine but not by nonthiol antioxidants, thus suggesting that sulfhydryl arylation might have been involved in VK(3)-mediated action. The phosphorylation of EGFR and c-met by VK(3) appeared to be functional, because these were coimmunoprecipitated with growth factor receptor-bound protein 2 (Grb2) and SOS1 antibody. Epidermal growth factor (EGF) or hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) stimulated increase of cyclin D1 protein after 12 hours and increased DNA content after 3 days in culture. In addition, U0126, which is a potent inhibitor for ERK phosphorylation, antagonized increase of cyclin D1, thus suggesting that EGF- or HGF-mediated ERK phosphorylation might have played an essential role for cell growth. By contrast, ERK phosphorylation by VK3 was more prolonged and intense than the signal induced by the growth factors. U0126 reduced ERK phosphorylation and prevented growth inhibition by VK3. Two-dimensional gels showed VK(3)-induced additional phospho-ERK spots, compared with those obtained from growth factors. This extra spot was completely antagonized by U0126.
VK(3)-induced growth inhibition and protein tyrosine phosphorylation were mediated by the sulfhydryl arylation system. The tyrosine phosphorylation of EGFR or c-met by VK3 activated the Ras signaling pathway. The overexpressed ERK phosphorylation by VK3 seemed to originate from additional spots on two-dimensional gels, which played a critical role in VK(3)-induced growth inhibitory action despite the fact that ERK phosphorylation by growth factors had had an essential association with cell growth.
In the present study, we show that 2-(2-hydroxyethylsulfaryl)-3-methyl-1,4-naphthoquinone, or CPD 5, is a potent growth inhibitor for pancreas cancer cell lines (ID(50): 21.4 +/- 3.8, 31.8 +/- 2.7 and 55.2 +/- 4.5 microM for MiaPaCa, Panc-1 and BxPc3, respectively). It induced protein tyrosine phosphor-ylation of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) receptor (c-Met) or epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), which increased progressively to a maximum level at 30 min in Panc-1 cells. The receptor phosphorylation by CPD 5 was indicated to be functional, since these receptors were found to bind with Grb2 or SOS1 protein. CPD 5 was also suggested to induce phosphorylation of external signal-regulated kinase (ERK). EGF induced cell proliferation through ERK phosphorylation, since U0126, which is an inhibitor of ERK phosphorylation, abrogated the increase of cyclin D1 by EGF. HGF increased the amount of p27 protein, suggesting that it is associated with cell differentiation. By contrast, U0126 reduced CPD 5-induced cell death. On two-dimensional electrophoresis, we found an extra type of phospho-ERK, and this was completely and selectively abolished by U0126. These results suggest that ERK phosphorylation, especially the extra spot on two-dimensional gel, is critically associated with CPD 5-mediated cell death.
Hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor (HGF/SF) is a pleiotropic effector inducing invasion and metastasis of tumor cells that express the Met tyrosine kinase receptor. One of the effectors of HGF/SF is the urokinase-type plasminogen activator, a serine protease that facilitates tumor progression and metastasis by controlling the synthesis of the extracellular matrix degrading plasmin. Stimulation of NIH 3T3 cells that were stably transfected with the human Met receptor (NIH 3T3-Methum) with HGF/SF induced a trans-activation of the urokinase promoter and urokinase secretion. Induction of the urokinase promoter by HGF/SF via the Met receptor was blocked by co-expression of a dominant-negative Grb2 and Sos1 expression construct. Further, the expression of the catalytically inactive mutants of Ha-Ras, RhoA, c-Raf, and Erk2 or addition of the Mek1-specific inhibitor PD 098059 abrogated the stimulation of the urokinase promoter by HGF/SF. A sequence residing between -2109 and -1870 base pairs (bp) was critical for stimulation of the urokinase gene by HGF/SF. Mobility shift assays with oligonucleotides spanning an AP-1 site at -1880 bp or a combined PEA3/AP-1 site at -1967 bp showed binding of nuclear factors from NIH 3T3-Methum cells. Expression of an expression plasmid that inhibits DNA binding of AP-1 proteins (A-Fos) abrogated inducible and basal activation of the urokinase promoter. Nuclear extract from unstimulated NIH 3T3-Methum cells contained more JunD and showed a stronger JunD supershift with the AP-1 oligonucleotides, compared with HGF/SF-stimulated cells. Consistent with the levels of JunD expression being functionally important for basal expression of the urokinase promoter, we found that overexpression of wild type JunD inhibited the induction of the urokinase promoter by HGF/SF. These data suggest that the induction of urokinase by HGF/SF is regulated by a Grb2/Sos1/Ha-Ras/c-Raf/RhoA/Mek1/Erk2/c-++ +Jun-dependent mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway.
To characterize the signaling pathways used by hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and keratinocyte growth factor (KGF) in human corneal epithelial cells.
Cultures of SV40 large T antigen-transfected human corneal epithelial cells were treated with recombinant human HGF or KGF at 50 ng/ml to 100 ng/ml for 5 to 30 minutes and harvested for protein isolation. Immunoprecipitation was performed with antisera to signal transducers and activators of transcription 1 (STAT1), STAT3, Janus kinase 1 (Jak1), Shc, Grb2, Sos1, and HGF receptor (met). Immunoprecipitated proteins were analyzed by western blot analysis. Gel retardation experiments were carried out with first-passage human corneal epithelial cells to detect binding of STATs to the high affinity c-sis (platelet-derived growth factor) inducible DNA element (hSIE). Effects of HGF, KGF, and kinase inhibitors on mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activation were evaluated by western blot analysis and enzymatic assays.
In human corneal epithelial cells, the phosphorylation of adapter protein Shc (52- and 66-kDa isoforms) was enhanced by HGF, but not by KGF. Phosphorylated HGF receptor coimmunoprecipitated with Shc, Grb2, and Sos1. Hepatocyte growth factor or KGF rapidly activated MAPK in corneal epithelial cells. The activation of MAPK (p42 and p44) by HGF or KGF was transient and decreased gradually within 1 hour. MAPK kinase 1 (MEK1) inhibitor PD098059 or the protein tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein blocked MAPK activation. Activation of MAPK induced by HGF was partially inhibited by protein kinase C inhibitor calphostin C. Hepatocyte growth factor and KGF had no effect on the activation of Jak-STAT cascade components that are activated by epidermal growth factor.
Hepatocyte growth factor and KGF activate Ras-MAPK pathways in human corneal epithelial cells. There may be at least two routes used by HGF in transmitting signals from its receptor to the MAPK cascade. One is the receptor-Grb2/Sos complex to the Ras pathway, and the other is through protein kinase C. Hepatocyte growth factor and KGF did not activate the Jak-STAT cascade components STAT1, STAT3, or Jak1 in corneal epithelial cells.
