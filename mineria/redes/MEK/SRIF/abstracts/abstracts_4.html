Ulcer healing is an active process of filling the mucosal defect with proliferating and migrating epithelial and connective tissue cells. At the ulcer margin, epithelial cells proliferate and migrate onto the granulation tissue to cover (reepithelialize) the ulcer and also invade granulation tissue to reconstruct glandular structures within the ulcer scar. The reepithelialization and reconstruction of glandular structures is controlled by growth factors: trefoil peptides, EGF, HGF, bFGF and PDGF; and locally produced cytokines by regenerating cells in an orderly fashion and integrated manner to ensure the quality of mucosal restoration. These growth factors, most notably EGF, trigger cell proliferation via signal transduction pathways involving EGF-R, adapter proteins (Grb2, Shc and Sos), Ras, Raf1 and MAP (Erk1/Erk2) kinases, which, after translocation to nuclei, activate transcription factors and cell proliferation. Cell migration requires cytoskeletal rearrangements and is controlled by growth factors via Rho/Rac and signaling pathways involving PLC-gamma, PI-3 K and phosphorylation of focal adhesion proteins. Granulation tissue develops at the ulcer base. It consists of connective tissue cells: fibroblasts, macrophages and proliferating endothelial cells forming microvessels under the control of angiogenic growth factors: bFGF, VEGF and angiopoietins, which all promote angiogenesiscapillary vessel formation, essential for the restoration of microvascular network in the mucosa and thus crucial for oxygen and nutrient supply. The major mechanism of activation of angiogenic growth factors and their receptor expression appears to be hypoxia, which activates hypoxia-inducible factor, which binds to VEGF promoter.
MET is a receptor protein-tyrosine kinase (RPTK) for hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), which is a multifunctional cytokine controlling cell growth, morphogenesis, and motility. MET overexpression has been identified in a variety of human cancers. Oncogenic missense mutations of the tyrosine kinase domain of the MET gene have been identified in human papillary renal cell carcinomas. In this study, RanBPM, also known as RanBP9, is identified as a novel interacting protein of MET through yeast two-hybrid screen. RanBPM contains a conserved SPRY (repeats in splA and RyR) domain. We demonstrate that RanBPM can interact with MET in vitro and in vivo, and the interaction can be strengthened by HGF stimulation. RanBPM interacts with the tyrosine kinase domain of MET through its SPRY domain. We show that RanBPM can induce GTP-Ras association and Erk phosphorylation and elevate serum response element-luciferase (SRE-LUC) expression, indicating that RanBPM can activate the Ras-Erk-SRE pathway. We demonstrate that RanBPM, which itself is not a guanine exchange protein, stimulates Ras activation by recruiting Sos. On the cellular level, A704 cells, a human renal carcinoma cell line, transfected with RanBPM exhibit increased migration ability. Our data suggest that RanBPM, functioning as an adaptor protein for the MET tyrosine kinase domain, can augment the HGF-MET signaling pathway and that RanBPM overexpression may cause constitutive activation of the Ras signaling pathway.
The c-MET gene encodes the tyrosine kinase p190MET, the receptor for a molecule known as Scatter Factor (SF) or Hepatocyte Growth Factor (HGF). This molecule has biological activities on epithelial sheets, including mitogenesis, cell-cell dissociation, stimulation of migration into the extracellular matrix, induction of cell polarization and branched tubulogenesis. The p190MET receptor is a heterodimer of two (alphabeta) disulfide-linked protein subunits. The RON and SEA genes encode tyrosine kinases that are structurally homologous to the HGF receptor. The three members of MET family elicit the same array of unusual biological responses that include "scattering", growth, and induction of polarized tubular structures. Recently, we identified another family of genes (SEX genes) encoding putative receptors with structural similarities to the extracellular domain of the HGF receptor and large cytoplasmic domains with unknown functions. Receptor autophosphorylation triggers the signal transduction pathways inside the target cells. The phosphorylation of an intracellular site made of a specific two-tyrosine containing sequence, mediates interactions with multiple SH2-containing intracellular signaling molecules. The multifunctional docking site is conserved and functional in the receptors encoded by RON and SEA. Substitution of N1358, critical for recruiting the Grb2/SoS complex and activating the Ras pathway, results in the abrogation of the growth response, while mutation of H1351 into N, generating a docking site inefficient to activate the PI3-kinase pathway, stimulates growth but fails to support the induction of scattering and branched tubulogenesis. Activation of a third pathway, mediated by direct phosphorylation on tyrosine of STAT-3 plays a critical role in induction of cell polarization and formation of tubular structures.
Growth factor receptor-bound protein-2 (GRB-2) is a protein linking receptor tyrosine kinase and Sos (Son of Sevenless gene; Ras GDP/GTP exchange protein), leading to activation of the Ras-mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade. So far, it remains unclear how GRB-2 plays a role in signal transduction pathways evoked by hepatotrophic factors. This study was attempted to evaluate the involvement of GRB-2 in signalling in rat hepatocyte growth. Using rat cultured hepatocytes stimulated by hepatotrophic factors and regenerating livers after partial hepatectomy (PH) we examined GRB-2-mediated linkage of hepatotrophic factor receptors to signal transducing molecules such as Sos or dynamin-II by immunoprecipitation and western blot analysis. In primary cultured hepatocytes stimulated with hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) or epidermal growth factor (EGF), GRB-2 linked HGF receptor or EGF receptor, respectively, to Sos which activated the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade. In contrast, in primary cultured hepatocytes stimulated with insulin, GRB-2 linked insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) to dynamin-II as well as Sos. In the early phase after PH, GRB-2 activated the Ras-MAPK cascade by linking HGF receptor, IRS-1, or EGF receptor to Sos. In the late phase after PH, a complex of IRS-1-GRB-2 associated with dynamin-II, indicating that GRB-2 may transduce signals from IRS-1 to dynamin-II. We conclude that GRB-2 may play a role in transmitting signals from hepatotrophic factors to not only MAPK but also to other signalling pathways in hepatocyte growth.
The oncogene Tpr-Met is a constitutively active form of the hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor (HGF/SF) receptor Met. It comprises the intracellular moiety of Met linked to the dimerization domain of the nuclear envelope protein Tpr, thus functioning as a constitutively activated Met. HGF/SF is responsible for various biological processes including angiogenesis and wound healing, in which secreted serine protease urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) is implicated. The action of HGF/SF on cells is mediated by the autophosphorylation of Met on two carboxyterminal tyrosine residues, Y1349VHVNATVY1356VNV. The two tyrosine residues provide docking sites for various effector molecules, suggesting that multiple signaling pathways are activated to exert biological effects of HGF/SF [Ponzetto et al., Cell (1994) 77: 261]. We found that Tpr-Met efficiently activates the uPA gene via a SOS/Ras/extracellular signal regulated kinase (ERK)-dependent signaling pathway. Mutation of Y1356, which abrogates GRB2 binding, reduced the induction to half of the control level, while mutation of Y1349 showed little effect on uPA induction, suggesting an important but partly replaceable role for GRB2 in Met-dependent uPA gene induction. Mutation of both Y1349VHV and Y1356VNV into optimal PI 3-kinase sites resulted in a residual induction of about one quarter of the control level, suggesting a potential role for PI 3-kinase. Dose-response analysis of the Tpr-Met showed a biphasic curve. These results suggest that the interplay among different signaling molecules on the receptor is important for full induction of the pathway leading to the activation of the uPA gene.
Phosphotyrosine peptide binding to Grb2 induces tryptophan fluorescence changes in the Src homology 2 (SH2) domain. Affinities are in the nanomolar range, the Shc peptide having the highest affinity, followed by peptides mimicking Grb2 binding sites on EGF and HGF receptors, the putative sites on insulin and IGF-1 receptors having much lower affinities. Proline-rich peptide binding to the SH3 domains induces fluorescence changes mainly in the C-terminal SH3. Affinities are in the micromolar range, the highest affinity peptides mimicking the first proline-rich motif of the Sos C-terminus. Additional residues before this PVPPPVPP motif provide a minor contribution to the binding, but the two residues after this motif are important and may contribute to specificity. The affinity of each SH3 for each proline-rich motif is too low to account for the high stability of the Grb2-Sos complex, suggesting that Grb2 recognizes other structural features in the Sos C-terminus. Binding of a phosphotyrosine peptide to the SH2 has no effect on the SH3s. Thus the binding of Grb2 to a receptor or to an associated protein phosphorylated on tyrosines is unlikely to activate the exchange factor activity of Sos through a conformational change transmitted from the SH2 to the SH3 domains.
Signaling by tyrosine kinase receptors is mediated by selective interactions between individual Src homology 2 (SH2) domains of cytoplasmic effectors and specific phosphotyrosine residues in the activated receptor. Here, we report the existence in the hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor (HGF/SF) receptor of a multifunctional docking site made of the tandemly arranged degenerate sequence YVH/NV. Phosphorylation of this site mediates intermediate- to high-affinity interactions with multiple SH2-containing signal transducers, including phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, phospholipase C gamma, pp60c-src, and the GRB-2-Sos complex. Mutation of the two tyrosines results in loss of biological function, as shown by abrogation of the transforming activity in the oncogenic counterpart of the receptor. The same bidentate motif is conserved in the evolutionarily related receptors Sea and Ron, suggesting that in all members of the HGF/SF receptor family, signal transduction is channeled through a multifunctional binding site.
The Ras/mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway is essential in the regulation of cell cycle, differentiation, growth, cell senescence and apoptosis, all of which are critical to normal development. A class of neurodevelopmental disorders, RASopathies, is caused by germline mutations in genes of the Ras/MAPK pathway. Through the use of whole exome sequencing and targeted sequencing of selected genes in cohorts of panel-negative RASopathy patients, several new genes have been identified. These include: RIT1, SOS2, RASA2, RRAS and SYNGAP1, that likely represent new, albeit rare, causative RASopathy genes. In addition, A2ML1, LZTR1, MYST4, SPRY1 and MAP3K8 may represent new rare genes for RASopathies, but, additional functional studies regarding the mutations are warranted. In addition, recent reports have demonstrated that chromosomal copy number variation in regions encompassing Ras/MAPK pathway genes may be a novel pathogenetic mechanism expanding the RASopathies.
Various genetic mutations associated with cancer are known to alter cell signaling, but it is not clear whether they dysregulate signaling pathways by altering the abundance of pathway proteins. Using a combination of RNA sequencing and ultrasensitive targeted proteomics, we defined the primary components-16 core proteins and 10 feedback regulators-of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway in normal human mammary epithelial cells and then quantified their absolute abundance across a panel of normal and breast cancer cell lines as well as fibroblasts. We found that core pathway proteins were present at very similar concentrations across all cell types, with a variance similar to that of proteins previously shown to display conserved abundances across species. In contrast, EGFR and transcriptionally controlled feedback regulators were present at highly variable concentrations. The absolute abundance of most core proteins was between 50,000 and 70,000 copies per cell, but the adaptors SOS1, SOS2, and GAB1 were found at far lower amounts (2000 to 5000 copies per cell). MAPK signaling showed saturation in all cells between 3000 and 10,000 occupied EGFRs, consistent with the idea that adaptors limit signaling. Our results suggest that the relative stoichiometry of core MAPK pathway proteins is very similar across different cell types, with cell-specific differences mostly restricted to variable amounts of feedback regulators and receptors. The low abundance of adaptors relative to EGFR could be responsible for previous observations that only a fraction of total cell surface EGFR is capable of rapid endocytosis, high-affinity binding, and mitogenic signaling.
Desmoplastic melanoma is an uncommon variant of melanoma with sarcomatous histology, distinct clinical behavior and unknown pathogenesis. We performed low-coverage genome and high-coverage exome sequencing of 20 desmoplastic melanomas, followed by targeted sequencing of 293 genes in a validation cohort of 42 cases. A high mutation burden (median of 62 mutations/Mb) ranked desmoplastic melanoma among the most highly mutated cancers. Mutation patterns strongly implicate ultraviolet radiation as the dominant mutagen, indicating a superficially located cell of origin. Newly identified alterations included recurrent promoter mutations of NFKBIE, encoding NF-κB inhibitor ɛ (IκBɛ), in 14.5% of samples. Common oncogenic mutations in melanomas, in particular in BRAF (encoding p.Val600Glu) and NRAS (encoding p.Gln61Lys or p.Gln61Arg), were absent. Instead, other genetic alterations known to activate the MAPK and PI3K signaling cascades were identified in 73% of samples, affecting NF1, CBL, ERBB2, MAP2K1, MAP3K1, BRAF, EGFR, PTPN11, MET, RAC1, SOS2, NRAS and PIK3CA, some of which are candidates for targeted therapies.
The RASopathies constitute a family of autosomal-dominant disorders whose major features include facial dysmorphism, cardiac defects, reduced postnatal growth, variable cognitive deficits, ectodermal and skeletal anomalies, and susceptibility to certain malignancies. Noonan syndrome (NS), the commonest RASopathy, is genetically heterogeneous and caused by functional dysregulation of signal transducers and regulatory proteins with roles in the RAS/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signal transduction pathway. Mutations in known disease genes account for approximately 80% of affected individuals. Here, we report that missense mutations altering Son of Sevenless, Drosophila, homolog 2 (SOS2), which encodes a RAS guanine nucleotide exchange factor, occur in a small percentage of subjects with NS. Four missense mutations were identified in five unrelated sporadic cases and families transmitting NS. Disease-causing mutations affected three conserved residues located in the Dbl homology (DH) domain, of which two are directly involved in the intramolecular binding network maintaining SOS2 in its autoinhibited conformation. All mutations were found to promote enhanced signaling from RAS to ERK. Similar to NS-causing SOS1 mutations, the phenotype associated with SOS2 defects is characterized by normal development and growth, as well as marked ectodermal involvement. Unlike SOS1 mutations, however, those in SOS2 are restricted to the DH domain.
The Arabidopsis AINTEGUMENTA (ANT) gene, which encodes an APETALA2 (AP2)-like transcription factor, controls plant organ cell number and organ size throughout shoot development. ANT is thus a key factor in the development of plant shoots. Here, we have found that ANT plays an essential role in conferring salt tolerance in Arabidopsis. ant-knockout mutants presented a salt-tolerant phenotype, whereas transgenic plants expressing ANT under the 35S promoter (35S:ANT) exhibited more sensitive phenotypes under high salt stress. Further analysis indicated that ANT functions mainly in the shoot response to salt toxicity. Target gene analysis revealed that ANT bound to the promoter of SOS3-LIKE CALCIUM BINDING PROTEIN 8 (SCABP8), which encodes a putative Ca(2+) sensor, thereby inhibiting expression of SCABP8 (also known as CBL10). It has been reported that the salt sensitivity of scabp8 is more prominent in shoot tissues. Genetic experiments indicated that the mutation of SCABP8 suppresses the ant-knockout salt-tolerant phenotype, implying that ANT functions as a negative transcriptional regulator of SCABP8 upon salt stress. Taken together, the above results reveal that ANT is a novel regulator of salt stress and that ANT binds to the SCABP8 promoter, mediating salt tolerance.
The Chk1 protein kinase is activated in response to DNA damage through ATR-mediated phosphorylation at multiple serine-glutamine (SQ) residues within the C-terminal regulatory domain, however the molecular mechanism is not understood. Modelling indicates a high probability that this region of Chk1 contains a kinase-associated 1 (KA1) domain, a small, compact protein fold found in multiple protein kinases including SOS2, AMPK and MARK3. We introduced mutations into Chk1 designed to disrupt specific structural elements of the predicted KA1 domain. Remarkably, six of seven Chk1 KA1 mutants exhibit constitutive biological activity (Chk1-CA) in the absence of DNA damage, profoundly arresting cells in G2 phase of the cell cycle. Cell cycle arrest induced by selected Chk1-CA mutants depends on kinase catalytic activity, which is increased several-fold compared to wild-type, however phosphorylation of the key ATR regulatory site serine 345 (S345) is not required. Thus, mutations targeting the putative Chk1 KA1 domain confer constitutive biological activity by circumventing the need for ATR-mediated positive regulatory phosphorylation.
The initiation of flowering in Arabidopsis is retarded or abolished by environmental stresses. Focusing on salt stress, we provide a molecular explanation for this well-known fact. A protein complex consisting of GI, a clock component important for flowering and SOS2, a kinase activating the [Na(+)] antiporter SOS1, exists under no stress conditions. GI prevents SOS2 from activating SOS1. In the presence of NaCl, the SOS2/GI complex disintegrates and GI is degraded. SO2, together with the Ca (2+)-activated sensor of sodium ions, SOS3, activates SOS1. In gi mutants, SOS1 is constitutively activated and gi plants are more highly salt tolerant than wild type Arabidopsis. The model shows GI as a transitory regulator of SOS pathway activity whose presence or amount connects flowering to environmental conditions.
Mice expressing a germline mutation in the phospholipase C-γ1-binding site of linker for activation of T cells (LAT) show progressive lymphoproliferation and ultimately die at 4-6 mo age. The hyperactivated T cells in these mice show defective TCR-induced calcium flux but enhanced Ras/ERK activation, which is critical for disease progression. Despite the loss of LAT-dependent phospholipase C-γ1 binding and activation, genetic analysis revealed RasGRP1, and not Sos1 or Sos2, to be the major Ras guanine exchange factor responsible for ERK activation and the lymphoproliferative phenotype in these mice. Analysis of isolated CD4(+) T cells from LAT-Y136F mice showed altered proximal TCR-dependent kinase signaling, which activated a Zap70- and LAT-independent pathway. Moreover, LAT-Y136F T cells showed ERK activation that was dependent on Lck and/or Fyn, protein kinase C-θ, and RasGRP1. These data demonstrate a novel route to Ras activation in vivo in a pathological setting.
In this study we show that via stable, retroviral-expression of tagged EGFR del (L747-S752 deletion mutant) in the PC9 lung cancer cell line and stable doxycycline-inducible expression of tagged Grb2 using a Flp-mediated recombination HEK293 cell system, the SH-TAP can be downscaled to 5 to 12.5 mg total protein input (equivalent to 0.5 - 1 × 15 cm culture plate or 4 - 8 × 10(6) cells). The major constituents of the EGFR del complex (USB3B, GRB2, ERRFI, HSP7C, GRP78, HSP71) and the Grb2 complex (ARHG5, SOS1, ARG35, CBL, CBLB, PTPRA, SOS2, DYN2, WIPF2, IRS4) were identified. Adjustment of the quantity of digested protein injected into the mass spectrometer reveals that optimisation is required as high quantities of material led to a decrease in protein sequence coverage and the loss of some interacting proteins. This investigation should aid other researchers in performing tandem affinity purifications in general, and in particular, from low quantities of input material.
CBL-interacting protein kinases (CIPKs) are involved in many aspects of plant responses to abiotic stresses. However, their functions are poorly understood in fruit trees. In this study, a salt-induced MdCIPK6L gene was isolated from apple. Its expression was positively induced by abiotic stresses, stress-related hormones and exogenous Ca(2+). MdCIPK6L was not homologous to AtSOS2, however, its ectopic expression functionally complemented Arabidopsis sos2 mutant. Furthermore, yeast two-hybrid assay showed that MdCIPK6L protein interacted with AtSOS3, indicating that it functions in salt tolerance partially like AtSOS2 through SOS pathway. As a result, the overexpression of both MdCIPK6L and MdCIPK6LT175D remarkably enhanced the tolerance to salt, osmotic/drought and chilling stresses, but did not affect root growth, in transgenic Arabidopsis and apple. Also, T-to-D mutation to MdCIPK6L at Thr175 did not affect its function. These differences between MdCIPK6L and other CIPKs, especially CIPK6s, indicate that MdCIPK6L encodes a novel CIPK in apple. Finally, MdCIPK6L overexpression also conferred tolerance to salt, drought and chilling stresses in transgenic tomatoes. Therefore, MdCIPK6L functions in stress tolerance crossing the species barriers, and is supposed to be a potential candidate gene to improve stress tolerance by genetic manipulation in apple and other crops.
Despite its key role in driving cellular growth and proliferation through receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) signaling, the Grb2-Sos1 macromolecular interaction remains poorly understood in mechanistic terms. Herein, using an array of biophysical methods, we provide evidence that although the Grb2 adaptor can potentially bind to all four PXψPXR motifs (designated herein S1-S4) located within the Sos1 guanine nucleotide exchange factor, the formation of the Grb2-Sos1 signaling complex occurs with a 2:1 stoichiometry. Strikingly, such bivalent binding appears to be driven by the association of the Grb2 homodimer to only two of four potential PXψPXR motifs within Sos1 at any one time. Of particular interest is the observation that of a possible six pairwise combinations in which S1-S4 motifs may act in concert for the docking of the Grb2 homodimer through bivalent binding, only S1 and S3, S1 and S4, S2 and S4, and S3 and S4 do so, while pairwise combinations of sites S1 and S2 and sites S2 and S3 appear to afford only monovalent binding. This salient observation implicates the role of local physical constraints in fine-tuning the conformational heterogeneity of the Grb2-Sos1 signaling complex. Importantly, the presence of multiple binding sites within Sos1 appears to provide a physical route for Grb2 to hop in a flip-flop manner from one site to the next through facilitated diffusion, and such rapid exchange forms the basis of positive cooperativity driving the bivalent binding of Grb2 to Sos1 with high affinity. Collectively, our study sheds new light on the assembly of a key macromolecular signaling complex central to cellular machinery in health and disease.
Arabidopsis has been a favorite model system for plant biologist. It is anticipated that comparative analysis of this plant with other members of Brassicaceae may aid in identification of orthologs playing role as key genetic determinants for salinity response. In this endeavor, we have recently identified SOS family members from Brassica juncea in our laboratory and reported their salinity responsive transcriptional induction in seedlings of various diploid and amphidiploids species. In the present study, we have carried out detailed time kinetics for BjSOS3 expression in a salinity tolerant B. juncea var. CS52. Transcript analysis at the sensitive growth stages of plants viz. seedling and reproductive stage indicated clear differential transcriptional regulation of BjSOS3 under non-induced as well as salinity induced conditions in a time and organ specific manner, mirroring their respective tolerance physiology. Similar to its ortholog from Arabidopsis thaliana, the modeled BjSOS3 protein show typical features of a Ca(2+) binding protein with four conserved EF-hands. We have also attempted to study the binding of SOS3 protein with the modeled SOS2 protein. It has been established that SOS3 protein senses Ca(2+) though the binding is very weak; we show the down regulation of BjSOS3 mRNA in presence of calcium chelator - EGTA under the various stress conditions including ABA. In situ localization of BjSOS3-GFP fusion protein in onion peel has shown its presence strongly in plasma membrane as well as cytosol. The leads presented in the paper will assist in understanding and establishing the SOS signaling machinery in B. juncea.
Genes that enable crops to limit Na(+) accumulation in shoot tissues represent potential sources of salinity tolerance for breeding. In barley, the HvNax4 locus lowered shoot Na(+) content by between 12% and 59% (g(-1) DW), or not at all, depending on the growth conditions in hydroponics and a range of soil types, indicating a strong influence of environment on expression. HvNax4 was fine-mapped on the long arm of barley chromosome 1H. Corresponding intervals of ∼200 kb, containing a total of 34 predicted genes, were defined in the sequenced rice and Brachypodium genomes. HvCBL4, a close barley homologue of the SOS3 salinity tolerance gene of Arabidopsis, co-segregated with HvNax4. No difference in HvCBL4 mRNA expression was detected between the mapping parents. However, genomic and cDNA sequences of the HvCBL4 alleles were obtained, revealing a single Ala111Thr amino acid substitution difference in the encoded proteins. The known crystal structure of SOS3 was used as a template to obtain molecular models of the barley proteins, resulting in structures very similar to that of SOS3. The position in SOS3 corresponding to the barley substitution does not participate directly in Ca(2+) binding, post-translational modifications or interaction with the SOS2 signalling partner. However, Thr111 but not Ala111 forms a predicted hydrogen bond with a neighbouring α-helix, which has potential implications for the overall structure and function of the barley protein. HvCBL4 therefore represents a candidate for HvNax4 that warrants further investigation.
Based on sequence analysis, the salt overly sensitive (SOS1) gene has been suggested to function as a Na(+)/H(+) antiporter located at the plasma membrane of plant cells, being expressed mostly in the meristem zone of the root and in the parenchyma cells surrounding the vascular tissue of the stem. In this study, we compared net H(+) and Ca(2+) fluxes and intracellular pH and [Ca(2+)](cyt) in the root meristem zone of Arabidopsis wild-type (WT) and sos mutants before and after salt stress. In addition, we studied the effect of pretreatment with amiloride (an inhibitor of Na(+)/H(+) antiporters) on net ion fluxes, intracellular pH and intracellular Ca(2+) activity ([Ca(2+)](cyt)) in WT plants and sos1 mutants before and after salt stress. Net ion fluxes were measured using microelectrode ion flux estimation (MIFE) and intracellular pH and [Ca(2+)](cyt) using fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) techniques. During the first 15 min after NaCl application, sos1 mutants showed net H(+) efflux and intracellular alkalinization in the meristem zone, whereas sos2 and sos3 mutants and WT showed net H(+) influx and slight intracellular acidification in the meristem zone. Treatment with amiloride led to intracellular acidification and lower net H(+) flux in WT plants and to a decrease in intracellular Ca(2+) in WT and sos1 plants. WT plants pretreated with amiloride did not show positive net H(+) flux and intracellular acidification. After NaCl application, internal pH shifted to higher values in WT and sos1 plants. However, absolute values of H(+) fluxes were higher and internal pH values were lower in WT plants pretreated with amiloride compared with sos1 mutants. Therefore, the SOS1 transporter is involved in H(+) influx into the meristem zone of Arabidopsis roots, or it may function as a Na(+)/H(+) antiporter. Amiloride affects SOS1 and other Na(+)/H(+) antiporters in plant cells because of its ability to decrease the H(+) gradient across the plasma membrane.
The protein kinase SOS2 (Salt Overly Sensitive 2) is essential for salt-stress signaling and tolerance in Arabidopsis. SOS2 is known to be activated by calcium-SOS3 and by phosphorylation at its activation loop. SOS2 is autophosphorylated in vitro, but the autophosphorylation site and its role in salt tolerance are not known. In this study, we identified an autophosphorylation site in SOS2 and analyzed its role in the responses of Arabidopsis to salt stress. Mass spectrometry analysis showed that Ser 228 of SOS2 is autophosphorylated. When this site was mutated to Ala, the autophosphorylation rate of SOS2 decreased. The substrate phosphorylation by the mutated SOS2 was also less than that by the wild-type SOS2. In contrast, changing Ser228 to Asp to mimic the autophosphorylation enhanced substrate phosphorylation by SOS2. Complementation tests in a sos2 mutant showed that the S228A but not the S228D mutation partially disrupted the function of SOS2 in salt tolerance. We also show that activation loop phosphorylation at Thr168 and autophosphorylation at Ser228 cannot substitute for each other, suggesting that both are required for salt tolerance. Our results indicate that Ser 228 of SOS2 is autophosphorylated and that this autophosphorylation is important for SOS2 function under salt stress.
N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor-induced activation of extracellular signal-related protein kinase (Erk) plays important roles in various neuronal functions including long-term potentiation (LTP). Son of sevenless (Sos) proteins have been implicated in NMDA-induced Erk activation in neurons of young mice. However, contribution of each of the two Sos isoforms, Sos1 and Sos2, has not been clarified. In this study, Sos2 involvement in NMDA-induced Erk activation was examined. We observed no defect in Erk phosphorylation induced by NMDA treatment of cortical neuronal cultures from Sos2-/- newborn mice. Moreover, theta-burst-induced LTP induction in the hippocampus of Sos2-/- mice was also normal. Finally, Erk activation by either depolarization or BDNF treatment was also normal in cultured neurons from Sos2 knockout mice. These results imply that Sos1 is the major regulator of these well-known neuronal Sos functions and suggest that a novel function for Sos2 in neurons remains to be determined.
We investigated the physiological role of endogenous MAPK-activating death domain-containing protein (MADD), a splice variant of the IG20 gene, that can interact with TNFR1 in tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFalpha)-induced activation of NF-kappaB, MAPK, ERK1/2, JNK, and p38. Using exon-specific short hairpin RNAs expressing lentiviruses, we knocked down the expression of all IG20 splice variants or MADD, which is overexpressed in cancer cells. Abrogation of MADD expression rendered cells highly susceptible to TNFalpha-induced apoptosis in the absence of cycloheximide. It also resulted in a dramatic loss in TNFalpha-induced activation of MAPK without any apparent effect on NF-kappaB activation. This observation was substantiated by an accompanying loss in the activation of p90RSK, a key downstream target of MAPK, whereas the NF-kappaB-regulated interleukin 6 levels remained unaffected. Endogenous MADD knockdown, however, did not affect epidermal growth factor-induced MAPK activation thereby demonstrating the specific requirement of MADD for TNF receptor-mediated MAPK activation. Re-expression of short hairpin RNA-resistant MADD in the absence of endogenous IG20 expression rescued the cells from TNFalpha-induced apoptosis. The requirement for MADD was highly specific for TNFalpha-induced activation of MAPK but not the related JNK and p38 kinases. Loss of MADD expression resulted in reduced Grb2 and Sos1/2 recruitment to the TNFR1 complex and decreased Ras and MEKK1/2 activation. These results demonstrate the essential role of MADD in protecting cancer cells from TNFalpha-induced apoptosis by specifically activating MAPKs through Grb2 and Sos1/2 recruitment, and its potential as a novel cancer therapeutic target.
Calcium signals mediate a multitude of plant responses to external stimuli. Calcineurin B-like (CBL) proteins and their target kinases, CBL-interacting protein kinases (CIPKs), represent important relays in plant calcium signaling. CBL interacts with CIPK through a conserved motif (NAF/FISL motif) within the C-terminal regulatory domain. To better understand the functional role of the CBL-CIPK system, we determined the crystal structure of AtCBL2 in complex with the regulatory domain of AtCIPK14 at 1.2 A resolution. The NAF/FISL motif is inserted into a hydrophobic crevice within AtCBL2, accompanied by a large displacement of the helices and loop on the opposite side of the NAF/FISL motif from the C-terminal region, which shields the hydrophobic crevice in free form. Ca(2+) are coordinated within four EF hands in AtCBL2 in bound form. This calcium coordination pattern differs from that in the structure of the SOS3-SOS2 complex previously reported. Structural comparison of the two structures shows that the recognition of CBL by CIPK is performed in a similar manner, but inherent interactions confer binding affinity and specificity.
Calcium serves as a critical messenger in many adaptation and developmental processes. Cellular calcium signals are detected and transmitted by sensor molecules such as calcium-binding proteins. In plants, the calcineurin B-like protein (CBL) family represents a unique group of calcium sensors and plays a key role in decoding calcium transients by specifically interacting with and regulating a family of protein kinases (CIPKs). We report here that the CBL protein CBL10 functions as a crucial regulator of salt tolerance in Arabidopsis. Cbl10 mutant plants exhibited significant growth defects and showed hypersensitive cell death in leaf tissues under high-salt conditions. Interestingly, the Na(+) content of the cbl10 mutant, unlike other salt-sensitive mutants identified thus far, was significantly lower than in the wild type under either normal or high-salt conditions, suggesting that CBL10 mediates a novel Ca(2+)-signaling pathway for salt tolerance. Indeed, the CBL10 protein physically interacts with the salt-tolerance factor CIPK24 (SOS2), and the CBL10-CIPK24 (SOS2) complex is associated with the vacuolar compartments that are responsible for salt storage and detoxification in plant cells. These findings suggest that CBL10 and CIPK24 (SOS2) constitute a novel salt-tolerance pathway that regulates the sequestration/compartmentalization of Na(+) in plant cells. Because CIPK24 (SOS2) also interacts with CBL4 (SOS3) and regulates salt export across the plasma membrane, our study identifies CIPK24 (SOS2) as a multi-functional protein kinase that regulates different aspects of salt tolerance by interacting with distinct CBL calcium sensors.
Salt stress induces the degradation of 14-3-3 proteins, and affects the localization of 14-3-3 λ. Both the modulation of 14-3-3 protein stability and the subcellular localization of these proteins are involved in salt tolerance in plants. Salt tolerance in plants is regulated by multiple signaling pathways, including the salt overly sensitive (SOS) pathway, of which the SOS2 protein is a key component. SOS2 is activated under salt stress to enhance salt tolerance in plants. We previously identified 14-3-3 λ and κ as important regulators of salt tolerance. Both proteins interact with SOS2 to inhibit its kinase activity under normal growth conditions. In response to salt stress, 14-3-3 proteins dissociate from SOS2, releasing its activity and activating the SOS pathway to confer salt tolerance (Zhou et al. Plant Cell 26:1166-1182, 2014). Here we report that salt stress promotes the degradation of 14-3-3 λ and κ, at least in part via the actions of SOS3-like calcium binding protein 8/calcineurin-B-like10, and also decreases the plasma membrane (PM) localization of 14-3-3 λ. Salt stress also partially represses the interaction of SOS2 and 14-3-3 λ at the PM, but activates PM-localized SOS2. Together, these results suggest that, in plants, both the modulation of 14-3-3 stability and the subcellular localization of these proteins in response to salt stress are important for SOS2 activation and salt tolerance. These data provide new insights into the biological roles of 14-3-3 proteins in modulating salt tolerance.
Oilseed mustard, Brassica juncea, exhibits high levels of genetic variability for salinity tolerance. To obtain the global view of transcriptome and investigate the molecular basis of salinity tolerance in a salt-tolerant variety CS52 of B. juncea, we performed transcriptome sequencing of control and salt-stressed seedlings. De novo assembly of 184 million high-quality paired-end reads yielded 42,327 unique transcripts longer than 300 bp with RPKM ≥1. When compared with non-redundant proteins, we could annotate 67% unigenes obtained in our study. Based on the mapping to expressed sequence tags (ESTs), 52.6% unigenes are novel compared to EST data available for B. juncea and constituent genomes. Differential expression analysis revealed altered expression of 1469 unigenes in response to salinity stress. Of these, 587, mainly associated with ROS detoxification, sulfur assimilation and calcium signaling pathways, are up regulated. Notable of these is RSA1 (SHORT ROOT IN SALT MEDIUM 1) INTERACTING TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR 1 (RITF1) homolog up regulated by &gt;100 folds in response to stress. RITF1, encoding a bHLH transcription factor, is a positive regulator of SOS1 and several key genes involved in scavenging of salt stress-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS). Further, we performed comparative expression profiling of key genes implicated in ion homeostasis and sequestration (SOS1, SOS2, SOS3, ENH1, NHX1), calcium sensing pathway (RITF1) and ROS detoxification in contrasting cultivars for salinity tolerance, B. juncea and B. nigra. The results revealed higher transcript accumulation of most of these genes in B. juncea var. CS52 compared to salt-sensitive cultivar even under normal growth conditions. Together, these findings reveal key pathways and signaling components that contribute to salinity tolerance in B. juncea var. CS52.
Abscisic acid (ABA) plays an essential role in seed germination. In this study, we demonstrate that one SNF1-related protein kinase3-type protein kinase, SOS2-like protein kinase5 (PKS5), is involved in ABA signal transduction via the phosphorylation of an interacting protein, abscisic acid-insensitive5 (ABI5). We found that pks5-3 and pks5-4, two previously identified PKS5 superactive kinase mutants with point mutations in the PKS5 FISL/NAF (a conserved peptide that is necessary for interaction with SOS3 or SOS3-like calcium binding proteins) motif and the kinase domain, respectively, are hypersensitive to ABA during seed germination. PKS5 was found to interact with ABI5 in yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae), and this interaction was further confirmed in planta using bimolecular fluorescence complementation. Genetic studies revealed that ABI5 is epistatic to PKS5. PKS5 phosphorylates a serine (Ser) residue at position 42 in ABI5 and regulates ABA-responsive gene expression. This phosphorylation was induced by ABA in vivo and transactivated ABI5. Expression of ABI5, in which Ser-42 was mutated to alanine, could not fully rescue the ABA-insensitive phenotypes of the abi5-8 and pks5-4abi5-8 mutants. In contrast, mutating Ser-42 to aspartate rescued the ABA insensitivity of these mutants. These data demonstrate that PKS5-mediated phosphorylation of ABI5 at Ser-42 is critical for the ABA regulation of seed germination and gene expression in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana).
Plant cells have developed specific protective molecular machinery against environmental stresses. The family of CBL-interacting protein kinases (CIPK) and their interacting activators, the calcium sensors calcineurin B-like (CBLs), work together to decode calcium signals elicited by stress situations. The molecular basis of biological activation of CIPKs relies on the calcium-dependent interaction of a self-inhibitory NAF motif with a particular CBL, the phosphorylation of the activation loop by upstream kinases, and the subsequent phosphorylation of the CBL by the CIPK. We present the crystal structures of the NAF-truncated and pseudophosphorylated kinase domains of CIPK23 and CIPK24/SOS2. In addition, we provide biochemical data showing that although CIPK23 is intrinsically inactive and requires an external stimulation, CIPK24/SOS2 displays basal activity. This data correlates well with the observed conformation of the respective activation loops: Although the loop of CIPK23 is folded into a well-ordered structure that blocks the active site access to substrates, the loop of CIPK24/SOS2 protrudes out of the active site and allows catalysis. These structures together with biochemical and biophysical data show that CIPK kinase activity necessarily requires the coordinated releases of the activation loop from the active site and of the NAF motif from the nucleotide-binding site. Taken all together, we postulate the basis for a conserved calcium-dependent NAF-mediated regulation of CIPKs and a variable regulation by upstream kinases.
Eutrema salsugineum and Schrenkiella parvula are salt-tolerant relatives of the salt-sensitive species Arabidopsis thaliana. An important component of salt tolerance is the regulation of Na(+) ion homeostasis, which occurs in part through proteins encoded by the Cation/Proton Antiporter-1 (CPA1) gene family. We used a combination of evolutionary and functional analyses to examine the role of CPA1 genes in the salt tolerance of E. salsugineum and Sc. parvula, and found evidence that changes in CPA1-mediated Na(+) extrusion may contribute to the salt tolerance of both species. Specifically, we found that a member of the CPA1 family, the Na(+)/H(+) antiporter gene Salt Overly Sensitive 1 (SOS1), evolved under positive selection in E. salsugineum. In the absence of activation by the SOS2 kinase/SOS3 calcium-binding protein complex, SOS1 from E. salsugineum (EsSOS1) confers greater salt tolerance than SOS1 from Sc. parvula (SpSOS1) and Ar. thaliana (AtSOS1) when expressed in a salt-sensitive strain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. A single amino acid change in the putative autoinhibitory domain is required but not sufficient for the enhanced salt tolerance conferred by EsSOS1. When activated by SOS2 and SOS3, both EsSOS1 and SpSOS1 confer greater salt tolerance than AtSOS1. Enhanced SOS1-mediated Na(+) extrusion therefore appears to contribute to the salt tolerance of both E. salsugineum and Sc. parvula, although through apparently different mechanisms.
The calcineurin B-like protein (CBL) family represents a unique group of calcium sensors in plants. In Arabidopsis, CBL10 functions as a shoot-specific regulator in salt tolerance. We have identified two CBL10 homologs, PtCBL10A and PtCBL10B, from the poplar (Populus trichocarpa) genome. While PtCBL10A was ubiquitously expressed at low levels, PtCBL10B was preferentially expressed in the green-aerial tissues of poplar. Both PtCBL10A and PtCBL10B were targeted to the tonoplast and expression of either one in the Arabidopsis cbl10 mutant could rescue its shoot salt-sensitive phenotype. Like PtSOS3, both PtCBL10s physically interacted with the salt-tolerance component PtSOS2. But in contrast to the SOS3-SOS2 complex at the plasma membrane, the PtCBL10-SOS2 interaction was primarily associated with vacuolar compartments. Furthermore, overexpression of either PtCBL10A or PtCBL10B conferred salt tolerance on transgenic poplar plants by maintaining ion homeostasis in shoot tissues under salinity stress. These results not only suggest a crucial role of PtCBL10s in shoot responses to salt toxicity in poplar, but also provide a molecular basis for genetic engineering of salt-tolerant tree species.
The Arabidopsis SOS2 family of twenty-six protein kinases (CIPKs), their interacting activators, the SOS3 family of ten calcium-binding proteins (CBLs) and protein phosphatases type 2C (PP2C), function together in decoding calcium signals elicited by different environmental stimuli. Biochemical data suggest that stable CBL-CIPK or CIPK-PP2C complexes may be regulating the activity of various substrates controlling ion homeostasis. The available structural information provides a general regulatory mechanism in which calcium perception by CBLs and kinase activation is coupled. The structural basis of this molecular mechanism and the specificity of the network is reviewed and discussed in detail.
Genes involved in relevant functions for environmental adaptation can be considered primary candidates for their variation having been shaped by natural selection. Detecting recent selective events through their footprint on nucleotide variation constitutes a challenging task in species with a complex demographic history such as Arabidopsis thaliana. We have surveyed nucleotide variation in this species at nine genes involved in salt tolerance. The available genomewide information for this species has allowed us to contrast the levels and patterns of variation detected at the candidate genes with empirical distributions obtained from noncandidate regions.
We sequenced nine genes involved in salt tolerance (~32 kb) in 20 ecotypes of A. thaliana and analyzed polymorphism and divergence at the individual gene and multilocus levels.
Variation at the nine genes studied was characterized by a generalized skew toward polymorphisms with low-frequency variants. Except for genes RCD1 and NHX8, this pattern was similar to that generally detected in the A. thaliana genome and could thus be primarily explained by the species demographic history. The more extreme deviation at the NHX8 gene and its excess of polymorphism relative to divergence points to the recent action of selection on this gene.
The analysis of nucleotide polymorphism and divergence at nine genes involved in salt tolerance provided little evidence for the recent action of positive selection. Only the signals detected at NHX8 from both polymorphism and divergence were suggestive of the putative contribution of this gene to local adaptation.
The Arabidopsisthaliana Na(+)/H(+) antiporter salt-overly-sensitive 1 (SOS1) is essential to maintain low intracellular levels of toxic Na(+) under salt stress. Available data show that the plant SOS2 protein kinase and its interacting activator, the SOS3 calcium-binding protein, function together in decoding calcium signals elicited by salt stress and regulating the phosphorylation state and the activity of SOS1. Molecular genetic studies have shown that the activation implies a domain reorganization of the antiporter cytosolic moiety, indicating that there is a clear relationship between function and molecular structure of the antiporter. To provide information on this issue, we have carried out in vivo and in vitro studies on the oligomerization state of SOS1. In addition, we have performed electron microscopy and single-particle reconstruction of negatively stained full-length and active SOS1. Our studies show that the protein is a homodimer that contains a membrane domain similar to that found in other antiporters of the family and an elongated, large, and structured cytosolic domain. Both the transmembrane (TM) and cytosolic moieties contribute to the dimerization of the antiporter. The close contacts between the TM and the cytosolic domains provide a link between regulation and transport activity of the antiporter.
The objective of the present study was to examine the role of SOS pathway in salinity stress tolerance in Brassica spp. An experiment was conducted in pot culture with 4 Brassica genotypes, i.e., CS 52 and CS 54, Varuna and T 9 subjected to two levels of salinity treatments along with a control, viz., 1.65 (S(0)), 4.50 (S(1)) and 6.76 (S(2)) dS m(-1). Salinity treatment significantly decreased relative water content (RWC), membrane stability index (MSI) and chlorophyll (Chl) content in leaves and potassium (K) content in leaf, stem and root of all the genotypes. The decline in RWC, MSI, Chl and K content was significantly less in CS 52 and CS 54 as compared to Varuna and T 9. In contrast, the sodium (Na) content increased under salinity stress in all the plant parts in all the genotypes, however, the increase was less in CS 52 and CS 54, which also showed higher K/Na ratio, and thus more favourable cellular environment. Gene expression studies revealed the existence of a more efficient salt overly sensitive pathway composed of SOS1, SOS2, SOS3 and vacuolar Na(+)/H(+) antiporter in CS 52 and CS 54 compared to Varuna and T 9. Sequence analyses of partial cDNAs showed the conserved nature of these genes, and their intra and intergenic relatedness. It is thus concluded that existence of an efficient SOS pathway, resulting in higher K/Na ratio, could be one of the major factor determining salinity stress tolerance of Brassica juncea genotypes CS 52 and CS 54.
The Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) genome encodes nine Salt Overly Sensitive3 (SOS3)-like calcium-binding proteins (SCaBPs; also named calcineurin B-like protein [CBL]) and 24 SOS2-like protein kinases (PKSs; also named as CBL-interacting protein kinases [CIPKs]). A general regulatory mechanism between these two families is that SCaBP calcium sensors activate PKS kinases by interacting with their FISL motif. In this study, we demonstrated that phosphorylation of SCaBPs by their functional interacting PKSs is another common regulatory mechanism. The phosphorylation site serine-216 at the C terminus of SCaBP1 by PKS24 was identified by liquid chromatography-quadrupole mass spectrometry analysis. This serine residue is conserved within the PFPF motif at the C terminus of SCaBP proteins. Phosphorylation of this site of SCaBP8 by SOS2 has been determined previously. We further showed that CIPK23/PKS17 phosphorylated CBL1/SCaBP5 and CBL9/SCaBP7 and PKS5 phosphorylated SCaBP1 at the same site in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, the phosphorylation stabilized the interaction between SCaBP and PKS proteins. This tight interaction neutralized the inhibitory effect of PKS5 on plasma membrane H(+)-ATPase activity. These data indicate that SCaBP phosphorylation by their interacting PKS kinases is a critical component of the SCaBP-PKS regulatory pathway in Arabidopsis.
The plasma membrane sodium/proton exchanger Salt-Overly-Sensitive 1 (SOS1) is a critical salt tolerance determinant in plants. The SOS2-SOS3 calcium-dependent protein kinase complex up-regulates SOS1 activity, but the mechanistic details of this crucial event remain unresolved. Here we show that SOS1 is maintained in a resting state by a C-terminal auto-inhibitory domain that is the target of SOS2-SOS3. The auto-inhibitory domain interacts intramolecularly with an adjacent domain of SOS1 that is essential for activity. SOS1 is relieved from auto-inhibition upon phosphorylation of the auto-inhibitory domain by SOS2-SOS3. Mutation of the SOS2 phosphorylation and recognition site impeded the activation of SOS1 in vivo and in vitro. Additional amino acid residues critically important for SOS1 activity and regulation were identified in a genetic screen for hypermorphic alleles.
The tissue-preferential distributed calcium sensors, SOS3 and SCaBP8, play important roles in SOS pathway to cope with saline conditions. Both SOS3 and SCaBP8 interact with and activate SOS2. However the regulatory mechanism for SOS2 activation and membrane recruitment by SCaBP8 differs from SOS3. SCaBP8 is phosphorylated by SOS2 at plasma membrane (PM) under salt stress. This phosphorylation anchors the SCaBP8-SOS2 complex on plasma membrane and activates PM Na(+)/H(+) antiporter, such as SOS1. Here, we describe that SOS2 has high binding affinity and catalytic efficiency to SCaBP8, suggesting that phosphorylation of SCaBP8 by SOS2 perhaps occurs rapidly in salt condition. SCaBP8 is also phosphorylated by PKS5 (SOS2-like Protein Kinase5) which negatively regulates PM H(+)-ATPase activity and functions in plant alkaline tolerance, providing a clue to roles of SCaBP8 in both salt and alkaline tolerance. SOS2 interacts with SOS3 and SCaBP8 with its FISL motif at C-terminus. However, luciferase activity complement assay indicates that SOS2 N-terminal is also essential for interacting with these proteins in plant.
Young wheat plants (Triticum aestivum L. cv. Mv Béres) were exposed to 0 or 25 mM NaCl for 11 days (salt acclimation). Thereafter the plants were irrigated with 500 mM NaCl for 5 days (salt stress). Irrigating the plants with a low concentration of NaCl successfully led to a reduction in chlorotic symptoms and in the impairment of the photosynthetic processes when the plants were exposed to subsequent high-dose salt treatment. After exposure to a high concentration of NaCl there was no difference in leaf Na content between the salt-acclimated and non-acclimated plants, indicating that salt acclimation did not significantly modify Na transport to the shoots. While the polyamine level was lower in salt-treated plants than in the control, salt acclimation led to increased osmotic potential in the leaves. Similarly, the activities of certain antioxidant enzymes, namely glutathione reductase, catalase and ascorbate peroxidase, were significantly higher in salt-acclimated plants. The results also suggest that while SOS1, SOS2 or NHX2 do not play a decisive role in the salt acclimation processes in young wheat plants; another stress-related gene, WALI6, may contribute to the success of the salt acclimation processes. The present study suggested that the responses of wheat plants to acclimation with low level of salt and to treatment with high doses of salt may be fundamentally different.
Salt-induced phosphorylation of MdVHA-B1 protein was mediated by MdSOS2L1 protein kinase, and thereby increasing malate content in apple. Salinity is an important environmental factor that influences malate accumulation in apple. However, the molecular mechanism by which salinity regulates this process is poorly understood. In this work, we found that MdSOS2L1, a novel AtSOS2-LIKE protein kinase, interacts with V-ATPase subunit MdVHA-B1. Furthermore, MdSOS2L1 directly phosphorylates MdVHA-B1 at Ser(396) site to modulate malate accumulation in response to salt stress. Meanwhile, a series of transgenic analyses in apple calli showed that the MdSOS2L1-MdVHAB1 pathway was involved in the regulation of malate accumulation. Finally, a viral vector-based transformation approach demonstrated that the MdSOS2L1-MdVHAB1 pathway also modulated malate accumulation in apple fruits with or without salt stress. Collectively, our findings provide a new insight into the mechanism by which MdSOS2L1 phosphorylates MdVHA-B1 to modulate malate accumulation in response to salinity in apple.
RASopathies or RAS/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) syndromes are a group of phenotypically overlapping syndromes caused by germline mutations that encode components of the RAS/MAPK signaling pathway. These disorders include neurofibromatosis type I, Legius syndrome, Noonan syndrome, Noonan syndrome with multiple lentigines (formerly called LEOPARD syndrome), Costello syndrome, cardiofaciocutaneous (CFC) syndrome, Noonan-like syndrome, hereditary gingival fibromatosis and capillary malformation-arteriovenous malformation. Recently, novel gene variants, including RIT1, RRAS, RASA2, A2ML1, SOS2 and LZTR1, have been shown to be associated with RASopathies, further expanding the disease entity. Although further analysis will be needed, these findings will help to better elucidate an understanding of the pathogenesis of these disorders and will aid in the development of potential therapeutic approaches. In this review, we summarize the novel genes that have been reported to be associated with RASopathies and highlight the cardiovascular abnormalities that may arise in affected individuals.
Cyclin-dependent protein kinases are involved in many crucial cellular processes and aspects of plant growth and development, but their precise roles in abiotic stress responses are largely unknown. Here, Arabidopsis thaliana CYCLIN-DEPENDENT KINASE G2 (CDKG2) was shown to act as a negative regulator of the salinity stress response, as well as being involved in the control of flowering time. GUS expression experiments based on a pCDKG2::GUS transgene suggested that CDKG2 was expressed throughout plant development, with especially high expression levels recorded in the seed and in the flower. The loss-of-function of CDKG2 led to an increased tolerance of salinity stress and the up-regulation of the known stress-responsive genes SOS1, SOS2, SOS3, NHX3, RD29B, ABI2, ABI3, MYB15 and P5CS1. Flowering was accelerated in the cdkg2 mutants via the repression of FLC and the consequent up-regulation of FT, SOC1, AP1 and LFY. Transgenic lines constitutively expressing CDKG2 showed greater sensitivity to salinity stress and were delayed in flowering. Furthermore, the CDKG2 genotype affected the response of flowering time to salinity stress. Our data connect CDKG2 to undescribed functions related to salt stress tolerance and flowering time through the regulation of specific target genes.
Noonan syndrome is an autosomal dominant, multisystemic disorder caused by dysregulation of the RAS/mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. Heterozygous, pathogenic variants in 11 known genes account for approximately 80% of cases. The identification of novel genes associated with Noonan syndrome has become increasingly challenging, since they might be responsible for very small fractions of the cases.
A cohort of 50 Brazilian probands negative for pathogenic variants in the known genes associated with Noonan syndrome was tested through whole-exome sequencing along with the relatives in the familial cases. Families from the USA and Poland with mutations in the newly identified genes were included subsequently.
We identified rare, segregating or de novo missense variants in SOS2 and LZTR1 in 4% and 8%, respectively, of the 50 Brazilian probands. SOS2 and LZTR1 variants were also found to segregate in one American and one Polish family. Notably, SOS2 variants were identified in patients with marked ectodermal involvement, similar to patients with SOS1 mutations.
We identified two novel genes, SOS2 and LZTR1, associated with Noonan syndrome, thereby expanding the molecular spectrum of RASopathies. Mutations in these genes are responsible for approximately 3% of all patients with Noonan syndrome. While SOS2 is a natural candidate, because of its homology with SOS1, the functional role of LZTR1 in the RAS/MAPK pathway is not known, and it could not have been identified without the large pedigrees. Additional functional studies are needed to elucidate the role of LZTR1 in RAS/MAPK signalling and in the pathogenesis of Noonan syndrome.
Protein stability is a fundamental issue in biomedical and biotechnological applications of proteins. Among these applications, gene- and enzyme-replacement strategies are promising approaches to treat inherited diseases that may benefit from protein engineering techniques, even though these beneficial effects have been largely unexplored. In the present study we apply a sequence-alignment statistics procedure (consensus-based approach) to improve the activity and stability of the human AGT (alanine-glyoxylate aminotransferase) protein, an enzyme which causes PH1 (primary hyperoxaluria type I) upon mutation. By combining only five consensus mutations, we obtain a variant (AGT-RHEAM) with largely enhanced in vitro thermal and kinetic stability, increased activity, and with no side effects on foldability and peroxisomal targeting in mammalian cells. The structure of AGT-RHEAM reveals changes at the dimer interface and improved electrostatic interactions responsible for increased kinetic stability. Consensus-based variants maintained the overall protein fold, crystallized more easily and improved the expression as soluble proteins in two different systems [AGT and CIPK24 (CBL-interacting serine/threonine-protein kinase) SOS2 (salt-overly-sensitive 2)]. Thus the consensus-based approach also emerges as a simple and generic strategy to increase the crystallization success for hard-to-get protein targets as well as to enhance protein stability and function for biomedical applications.
The concentrations of mineral nutrients in seeds are critical to both the life cycle of plants as well as human nutrition. These concentrations are strongly influenced by soil conditions, as shown here by quantifying the concentration of 14 elements in seeds from Arabidopsis thaliana plants grown under four different soil conditions: standard, or modified with NaCl, heavy metals, or alkali. Each of the modified soils resulted in a unique change to the seed ionome (the mineral nutrient content of the seeds). To help identify the genetic networks regulating the seed ionome, changes in elemental concentrations were evaluated using mutants corresponding to 760 genes as well as 10 naturally occurring accessions. The frequency of ionomic phenotypes supports an estimate that as much as 11% of the A. thaliana genome encodes proteins of functional relevance to ion homeostasis in seeds. A subset of mutants were analyzed with two independent alleles, providing five examples of genes important for regulation of the seed ionome: SOS2, ABH1, CCC, At3g14280 and CNGC2. In a comparison of nine different accessions to a Col-0 reference, eight accessions were observed to have reproducible differences in elemental concentrations, seven of which were dependent on specific soil conditions. These results indicate that the A. thaliana seed ionome is distinct from the vegetative ionome, and that elemental analysis is a sensitive approach to identify genes controlling ion homeostasis, including those that regulate gene expression, phospho-regulation, and ion transport.
Gene expression pattern of two important regulatory proteins, salt overly sensitive 2 (SOS2) and plasma membrane protein 3-1 (PMP3-1), involved in ion homeostasis, was analyzed in two salinity-contrasting sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.) lines, Hysun-38 (salt tolerant) and S-278 (moderately salt tolerant). The pattern was studied at selected time intervals (24 h) under 150 mM NaCl treatment. Using reverse transcription PCR, SOS2 gene fragment was obtained from young leaf and root tissues of opposing lines while that for PMP3-1 was obtained only from young root tissues. Both tolerant and moderately tolerant lines showed a gradual increase in SOS2 expression in sunflower root tissues. Leaf tissues showed the gradually increasing pattern of SOS2 expression in tolerant plants as compared to that for moderately tolerant ones that showed a relatively lower level of expression for this gene. We found the highest level of PMP 3-1 expression in the roots of tolerant sunflower line at 6 and 12 h postsalinity treatment. The moderately tolerant line showed higher expression of PMP3-1 at 12 and 24 h after salt treatment. Overall, the expression of genes for both the regulator proteins varied significantly in the two sunflower lines differing in salinity tolerance.
Environmental challenges to plants typically entail retardation of vegetative growth and delay or cessation of flowering. Here we report a link between the flowering time regulator, GIGANTEA (GI), and adaptation to salt stress that is mechanistically based on GI degradation under saline conditions, thus retarding flowering. GI, a switch in photoperiodicity and circadian clock control, and the SNF1-related protein kinase SOS2 functionally interact. In the absence of stress, the GI:SOS2 complex prevents SOS2-based activation of SOS1, the major plant Na(+)/H(+)-antiporter mediating adaptation to salinity. GI overexpressing, rapidly flowering, plants show enhanced salt sensitivity, whereas gi mutants exhibit enhanced salt tolerance and delayed flowering. Salt-induced degradation of GI confers salt tolerance by the release of the SOS2 kinase. The GI-SOS2 interaction introduces a higher order regulatory circuit that can explain in molecular terms, the long observed connection between floral transition and adaptive environmental stress tolerance in Arabidopsis.
CIPK3 is a member of CBL (calcineurin B-like)-interacting serine-threonine protein kinases which play an important role in many developmental and adaptation processes in Arabidopsis. Studies conducted on members of this family such as SOS2, PKS8 and PKS11 have provided insight into how these kinases interact with their target substrates in the signal-response process. Since SOS2, PKS8 and PKS11 have low enzymatic activities in vitro and their amino acid sequences are homologous to that of CIPK3, it was assumed that CIPK3 would have a low enzymatic activity. To enhance CIPK3 enzyme activity, a constitutively active form, CIPK3T183D, was generated by a Thr(183) to Asp(183) substitution in the activation loop. To obtain proteins for analysis, glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein system was used. Although both CIPK3 and CIPK3T183D were successfully expressed, they were found in inclusion bodies with three truncated proteins. Since the truncated proteins had a similar affinity to the GST-Bind Resin as the target protein, the one-step affinity purification could no longer be used. As an alternative, His fusion protein expression system was employed for protein production. Although both His-CIPK3 and His-CIPK3T183D also accumulated in inclusion bodies, they were expressed as a single protein species. A method involving Sarkosyl was developed for isolating and purifying the His fusion proteins. His-CIPK3 and His-CIPK3T183D produced were highly purified and enzymatically active. In addition, a 9-fold increase in kinase activity in His-CIPK3T183D was observed, indicating that Thr(183) to Asp(183) substitution in the activation loop of CIPK3 had succeeded in enhancing the kinase activity.
Protein kinases play an important role in regulating the response to abiotic stress in plant. CIPKs are plant-specific signal transducers, and some members have been identified. However, the precise functions of novel CIPKs still remain unknown. Here we report that HbCIPK2 is a positive regulator of salt and osmotic stress tolerance. HbCIPK2 was screened out of the differentially expressed fragments from halophyte Hordeum brevisubulatum by cDNA-AFLP technique, and was a single-copy gene without intron. Expression of HbCIPK2 was increased by salt, drought and ABA treatment. HbCIPK2 is mainly localized to the plasma membrane and nucleus. Ectopic expression of 35S:HbCIPK2 not only rescued the salt hypersensitivity in Arabidopsis mutant sos2-1, but also enhanced salt tolerance in Arabidopsis wild type, and exhibited tolerance to osmotic stress during germination. The HbCIPK2 contributed to the ability to prevent K(+) loss in root and to accumulate less Na(+) in shoot resulting in K(+) /Na(+) homeostasis and protection of root cell from death, which is consistent with the gene expression profile of HbCIPK2-overexpressing lines. These findings imply possible novel HbCIPK2-mediated salt signalling pathways or networks in H. brevisubulatum.
Plants respond to various environmental stresses by activating "stress genes". CIPKs (CBL-interacting protein kinases) family genes play an important role in the process of stress response. In this study, a CIPK gene MdSOS2 was isolated from apple (Malus × Domestica). Sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis showed that it is highly similar with Arabidopsis AtSOS2 and contained the conserved domains and motifs. Expression analysis demonstrated that MdSOS2 expressed in all tested organs at different levels, and positively in response to salt stress. Furthermore, the ectopic expression of MdSOS2 complemented the function of Arabidopsis sos2 mutant, and conferred enhanced salt tolerance to the transgenic Arabidopsis. Yeast two-hybrid assay indicated that the N-terminal of MdSOS2 protein physically interacted with MdSOS3 and AtSOS3, respectively, suggesting that SOS pathway operates in apple tree. Finally, MdSOS2 overexpression enhanced, while its suppression reduced the tolerance to salt in transgenic apple calluses, indicating that MdSOS2 acts as a positive regulator in response to salt stress in apple.
We have identified a plasma membrane Na(+)/H(+) exchanger from durum wheat, designated TdSOS1. Heterologous expression of TdSOS1 in a yeast strain lacking endogenous Na(+) efflux proteins showed complementation of the Na(+)- and Li(+)-sensitive phenotype by a mechanism involving cation efflux. Salt tolerance conferred by TdSOS1 was maximal when co-expressed with the Arabidopsis protein kinase complex SOS2/SOS3. In vitro phosphorylation of TdSOS1 with a hyperactive form of the Arabidopsis SOS2 kinase (T/DSOS2∆308) showed the importance of two essential serine residues at the C-terminal hydrophilic tail (S1126, S1128). Mutation of these two serine residues to alanine decreased the phosphorylation of TdSOS1 by T/DSOS2∆308 and prevented the activation of TdSOS1. In addition, deletion of the C-terminal domain of TdSOS1 encompassing serine residues at position 1126 and 1128 generated a hyperactive form that had maximal sodium exclusion activity independent from the regulatory SOS2/SOS3 complex. These results are consistent with the presence of an auto-inhibitory domain at the C-terminus of TdSOS1 that mediates the activation of TdSOS1 by the protein kinase SOS2. Expression of TdSOS1 mRNA in young seedlings of the durum wheat variety Om Rabia3, using different abiotic stresses (ionic and oxidative stress) at different times of exposure, was monitored by RT-PCR.
An Arabidopsis thaliana mutant, nks1-1, exhibiting enhanced sensitivity to NaCl was identified in a screen of a T-DNA insertion population in the genetic background of Col-0 gl1sos3-1. Analysis of the genome sequence in the region flanking the T-DNA left border indicated two closely linked mutations in the gene encoded at locus At4g30996. A second allele, nks1-2, was obtained from the Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center. NKS1 mRNA was detected in all parts of wild-type plants but was not detected in plants of either mutant, indicating inactivation by the mutations. Both mutations in NKS1 were associated with increased sensitivity to NaCl and KCl, but not to LiCl or mannitol. NaCl sensitivity was associated with nks1 mutations in Arabidopsis lines expressing either wild type or null alleles of SOS1, SOS2 or SOS3. The NaCl-sensitive phenotype of the nks1-2 mutant was complemented by expression of a full-length NKS1 allele from the CaMV35S promoter. When grown in medium containing NaCl, nks1 mutants accumulated more Na(+) than wild type and K(+)/Na(+) homeostasis was perturbed. It is proposed NKS1, a plant-specific gene encoding a 19kDa endomembrane-localized protein of unknown function, is part of an ion homeostasis regulation pathway that is independent of the SOS pathway.
NPR1 (Nonexpressor of Pathogenesis-Related gene 1) is a major co-activator of plant defense. Phosphorylations of NPR1 play important roles in fine-tuning its activity, however a kinase corresponding to such modification remains uncharacterized. Here, we report that NPR1 interacts with PKS5 (SOS2-like Protein Kinase 5). The AKR (AnKyrin Repeats) motif of NPR1 is required for this interaction. PKS5 phosphorylates NPR1 at the C-terminal region. Expression of PKS5 is induced quickly by Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC3000. Expression level of two NPR1 target genes, WRKY38 and WRKY62, is reduced and/or delayed in pks5 mutants. Moreover, the expression of WRKY38 and WRKY62 displays a similar pattern in npr1-1pks5-1 double mutant comparing to that in npr1-1. Our results suggest that PKS5 functions at the upstream of NPR1 and might mediate expression of WRKY38 and WRKY62 possibly by interacting with and phosphorylating NPR1.
A full-length cDNA of a new serine/threonine (Ser/Thr) protein kinase gene, designated as BnSOS2 (GenBank Acc. No.AY310413), was cloned from Brassica napus by rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE). The full-length cDNA of BnSOS2 was 1779 bp and contained a 1539-bp open reading frame encoding a protein of 512 amino acids. Homology analysis shows that BnSOS2 strongly resembles other Ser/Thr protein kinase genes, and that its putative protein belongs to a typical Ser/Thr kinase family. Northern blot analysis reveals that BnSOS2 is salt-inducible. Our results indicate that BnSOS2 is a new member of the plant SOS2 gene family, which may play an important role in salt tolerance of plants.
SOS2 (salt overly sensitive 2) is a serine/threonine protein kinase required for salt tolerance in Arabidopsis thaliana. In this study, we identified the protein phosphatase 2C ABI2 (abscisic acid-insensitive 2) as a SOS2-interacting protein. Deletion analysis led to the discovery of a novel protein domain of 37 amino acid residues, designated as the protein phosphatase interaction (PPI) motif, of SOS2 that is necessary and sufficient for interaction with ABI2. The PPI motif is conserved in protein kinases of the SOS2 family (i.e., protein kinase S, PKS) and in the DNA damage repair and replication block checkpoint kinase, Chk1, from various organisms including humans. Mutations in the conserved amino acid residues in the PPI motif abolish the interaction of SOS2 with ABI2. We also identified a protein kinase interaction domain in ABI2 and examined the interaction specificity between PKS and the ABI phosphatases. We found that some PKSs interact strongly with ABI2 whereas others interact preferentially with ABI1. The interaction between SOS2 and ABI2 was disrupted by the abi2-1 mutation, which causes increased tolerance to salt shock and abscisic acid insensitivity in plants. Our results establish the PPI motif and the protein kinase interaction domain as novel protein interaction domains that mediate the binding between the SOS2 family of protein kinases and the ABI1/2 family of protein phosphatases.
When under salt stress, plants maintain a high concentration of K(+) and a low concentration of Na(+) in the cytosol. They do this by regulating the expression and activity of K(+) and Na(+) transporters and of H(+) pumps that generate the driving force for transport. Although salt-stress sensors remain elusive, some of the intermediary signaling components have been identified. Evidence suggests that a protein kinase complex consisting of the myristoylated calcium-binding protein SOS3 and the serine/threonine protein kinase SOS2 is activated by a salt-stress-elicited calcium signal. The protein kinase complex then phosphorylates and activates various ion transporters, such as the plasma membrane Na(+)/H(+) antiporter SOS1.
The Arabidopsis Salt Overly Sensitive 2 (SOS2) gene encodes a serine/threonine (Thr) protein kinase that has been shown to be a critical component of the salt stress signaling pathway. SOS2 contains a sucrose-non-fermenting protein kinase 1/AMP-activated protein kinase-like N-terminal catalytic domain with an activation loop and a unique C-terminal regulatory domain with an FISL motif that binds to the calcium sensor Salt Overly Sensitive 3. In this study, we examined some of the biochemical properties of the SOS2 in vitro. To determine its biochemical properties, we expressed and isolated a number of active and inactive SOS2 mutants as glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins in Escherichia coli. Three constitutively active mutants, SOS2T168D, SOS2T168D Delta F, and SOS2T168D Delta 308, were obtained previously, which contain either the Thr-168 to aspartic acid (Asp) mutation in the activation loop or combine the activation loop mutation with removal of the FISL motif or the entire regulatory domain. These active mutants exhibited a preference for Mn(2+) relative to Mg(2+) and could not use GTP as phosphate donor for either substrate phosphorylation or autophosphorylation. The three enzymes had similar peptide substrate specificity and catalytic efficiency. Salt overly sensitive 3 had little effect on the activity of the activation loop mutant SOS2T168D, either in the presence or absence of calcium. The active mutant SOS2T168D Delta 308 could not transphosphorylate an inactive protein (SOS2K40N), which indicates an intramolecular reaction mechanism of SOS2 autophosphorylation. Interestingly, SOS2 could be activated not only by the Thr-168 to Asp mutation but also by a serine-156 or tyrosine-175 to Asp mutation within the activation loop. Our results provide insights into the regulation and biochemical properties of SOS2 and the SOS2 subfamily of protein kinases.
In Arabidopsis thaliana, the Salt Overly Sensitive 2 (SOS2) gene is required for intracellular Na(+) and K(+) homeostasis. Mutations in SOS2 cause Na(+) and K(+) imbalance and render plants more sensitive toward growth inhibition by high Na(+) and low K(+) environments. We isolated the SOS2 gene through positional cloning. SOS2 is predicted to encode a serine/threonine type protein kinase with an N-terminal catalytic domain similar to that of the yeast SNF1 kinase. Sequence analyses of sos2 mutant alleles reveal that both the N-terminal catalytic domain and the C-terminal regulatory domain of SOS2 are functionally essential. The steady-state level of SOS2 transcript is up-regulated by salt stress in the root. Autophosphorylation assays show that SOS2 is an active protein kinase. In the recessive sos2-5 allele, a conserved glycine residue in the kinase catalytic domain is changed to glutamate. This mutation abolishes SOS2 autophosphorylation, indicating that SOS2 protein kinase activity is required for salt tolerance.
The Arabidopsis thaliana SOS2 and SOS3 genes are required for intracellular Na(+) and K(+) homeostasis and plant tolerance to high Na(+) and low K(+) environments. SOS3 is an EF hand type calcium-binding protein having sequence similarities with animal neuronal calcium sensors and the yeast calcineurin B. SOS2 is a serine/threonine protein kinase in the SNF1/AMPK family. We report here that SOS3 physically interacts with and activates SOS2 protein kinase. Genetically, sos2sos3 double mutant analysis indicates that SOS2 and SOS3 function in the same pathway. Biochemically, SOS2 interacts with SOS3 in the yeast two-hybrid system and in vitro binding assays. The interaction is mediated by the C-terminal regulatory domain of SOS2. SOS3 activates SOS2 protein kinase activity in a Ca(2+)-dependent manner. Therefore, SOS3 and SOS2 define a novel regulatory pathway important for the control of intracellular ion homeostasis and salt tolerance in plants.
Genome-wide association studies have identified &gt;50 common variants associated with kidney function, but these variants do not fully explain the variation in eGFR. We performed a two-stage meta-analysis of associations between genotypes from the Illumina exome array and eGFR on the basis of serum creatinine (eGFRcrea) among participants of European ancestry from the CKDGen Consortium (nStage1: 111,666; nStage2: 48,343). In single-variant analyses, we identified single nucleotide polymorphisms at seven new loci associated with eGFRcrea (PPM1J, EDEM3, ACP1, SPEG, EYA4, CYP1A1, and ATXN2L; PStage1&lt;3.7×10(-7)), of which most were common and annotated as nonsynonymous variants. Gene-based analysis identified associations of functional rare variants in three genes with eGFRcrea, including a novel association with the SOS Ras/Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor 2 gene, SOS2 (P=5.4×10(-8) by sequence kernel association test). Experimental follow-up in zebrafish embryos revealed changes in glomerular gene expression and renal tubule morphology in the embryonic kidney of acp1- and sos2-knockdowns. These developmental abnormalities associated with altered blood clearance rate and heightened prevalence of edema. This study expands the number of loci associated with kidney function and identifies novel genes with potential roles in kidney formation.
The association of natural genetic variations of salt-responsive candidate genes belonging to different gene families with salt-tolerance phenotype and their haplotype variation in different geographic regions. Soil salinity covers a large part of the arable land of the world and is a major factor for yield losses in salt-sensitive crops, such as rice. Different gene families that respond to salinity have been identified in rice, but limited success has been achieved in developing salt-tolerant cultivars. Therefore, 21 salt stress-responsive candidate genes belonging to different gene families were re-sequenced to analyse their genetic variation and association with salt tolerance. The average single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) density was 16 SNPs per kbp amongst these genes. The identified nucleotide and haplotype diversity showed comparatively higher genetic variation in the transporter family genes. Linkage disequilibrium (LD) analysis showed significant associations of SNPs in BADH2, HsfC1B, MIPS1, MIPS2, MYB2, NHX1, NHX2, NHX3, P5CS1, P5CS2, PIP1, SIK1, SOS1, and SOS2 genes with the salt-tolerant phenotype. A combined analysis of SNPs in the 21 candidate genes and eight other HKT transporter genes produced two separate clusters of tolerant genotypes, carrying unique SNPs in the ion transporter and osmoticum-related genes. Haplotype network analysis showed all the major and few minor alleles distributed over distant geographic regions. Minor haplotypes may be recently evolved alleles which migrated to distant geographic regions and may represent recent expansion of Indian wild rice. The analysis of genetic variation in different gene families identified the relationship between adaptive variations and functional significance of the genes. Introgression of the identified alleles from wild relatives may enhance the salt tolerance and consequently rice production in the salinity-affected areas.
Non-uniform root salinity increases the Na(+)efflux, water use, and growth of the root in non-saline side, which may be regulated by some form of signaling induced by the high-salinity side. However, the signaling and its specific function have remained unknown. Using a split-root system to simulate a non-uniform root zone salinity in Gossypium hirsutum L., we showed that the up-regulated expression of sodium efflux-related genes (SOS1, SOS2, PMA1, and PMA2) and water uptake-related genes (PIP1 and PIP2) was possibly involved in the elevated Na(+) efflux and water use in the the roots in the non-saline side. The increased level of indole acetic acid (IAA) in the non-saline side was the likely cause of the increased root growth. Also, the abscisic acid (ABA) and H2O2 contents in roots in the non-saline side increased, possibly due to the increased expression of their key biosynthesis genes, NCED and RBOHC, and the decreased expression of ABA catabolic CYP707A genes. Exogenous ABA added to the non-saline side induced H2O2 generation by up-regulating the RBOHC gene, but this was decreased by exogenous fluridone. Exogenous H2O2 added to the non-saline side reduced the ABA content by down-regulating NCED genes, which can be induced by diphenylene iodonium (DPI) treatment in the non-saline side, suggesting a feedback mechanism between ABA and H2O2.Both exogenous ABA and H2O2 enhanced the expression of SOS1, PIP1;7 ,PIP2;2, and PIP2;10 genes, but these were down-regulated by fluridone and DPI, suggesting that H2O2 and ABA are important signals for increasing root Na(+) efflux and water uptake in the roots in the non-saline side.
A rhamnogalacturonan-I (RG-I) containing pectic polysaccharide (PPc) was isolated from pumpkin following a low-temperature alkali treatment and a combination of gradual alcohol precipitation and ion-exchange. Monosaccharide compositional analysis of PPc revealed the presence of rhamnose, galacturonic acid, galactose, and arabinose in a molar ratio of 7.4: 25: 28: 2.6. Structural and linkage analysis by 1D NMR ((1)H NMR and (13)C NMR), and 2D NMR (COSY, TOCSY, HSQC, and elevated temperature HMBC) suggested that PPc was a RG-I-like pectic polysaccharide, branched at the C-4 of some of the (about 29% of) rhamnosyl units, with relatively long β-1,4-d-galactan side chains to which were attached, through the C-3 of β-d-Gal, terminal non reducing α-Araf units. The results of surface plasmon resonance (SPR) show that PPc binds to two types of lectin, Ricinus communis agglutinin 120 (RCA120) and Galectin-3 (Gal-3). These binding studies show quick association and slow dissociation with a moderate binding affinity between PPc and Gal-3 of 1.26μM. The interaction between PPc and Gal-3 suggest the potential use of pumpkin pectic polysaccharide as a Gal-3 inhibitor in functional food or drug development applications.
The aim of this study was to investigate the molecular mechanism underlying the immunomodulatory effect of the purified Artemisia sphaerocephala Krasch seed polysaccharide (ASKP-1) in RAW264.7 macrophages. Chemical characteristic analysis revealed that ASKP-1 consisted of 14.1% mannose, 56.9% glucose and 19.6% galactose with the average molecular weight of 9.08 × 10(5) Da and the mixed glycan backbone structure containing 1→4)-Glcp (39.8%), 1→6)-Galp (18.8%), 1→3,6)-Manp (19.6%), 1→)-Glcp (10.8%), 2→6)-Manp (4.0%) and 2→3,5)-Araf (7.0%). In vitro studies showed that ASKP-1 markedly induced the release of cytotoxic molecules (NO and ROS) and secretion of the cytokines (TNF-α, INF-β, and IL-6) and significantly enhanced the phagocytosis of RAW264.7 macrophages. Furthermore, TLR4 was found to be a recognized target of ASKP-1 and its related mitogen-activated protein (MAPK) and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt, including phosphorylated ERK, JNK, p38 and Akt, were rapidly activated by ASKP-1 in RAW264.7 macrophages. Moreover, ASKP-1 was found to cause the nuclear translocation of the nuclear factor NF-κB subunit p65 and the degradation of IκB-α in RAW264.7 macrophages. All these findings suggest that MAPK, PI3K/Akt and NF-κB pathways are involved in ASKP-1-induced macrophage activation, and ASKP-1 is a potential immunomodulating function food.
UDP-arabinopyranose mutase (UAM) is a plant enzyme which interconverts UDP-arabinopyranose (UDP-Arap; a six-membered sugar) to UDP-arabinofuranose (UDP-Araf; a five-membered sugar). Plant mutases belong to a small gene family called Reversibly Glycosylated Proteins (RGPs). So far, UAM has been identified in Oryza sativa (Rice), Arabidopsis thaliana and Hordeum vulgare (Barley). The enzyme requires divalent metal ions for catalytic activity. Here, the divalent metal ion dependency of UAMs from O. sativa (rice) and A. thaliana have been studied using HPLC-based kinetic assays. It was determined that UAM from these species had the highest relative activity in a range of 40-80μM Mn2+. Excess Mn2+ ion concentration decreased the enzyme activity. This trend was observed when other divalent metal ions were used to test activity. To gain a perspective of the role played by the metal ion in activity, an ab initio structural model was generated based on the UAM amino acid sequence and a potential metal binding region was identified. Based on our results, we propose that the probable role of the metal in UAM is stabilizing the diphosphate of the substrate, UDP-Arap.
To report intraocular manifestations of ECD with multimodal imaging.
A retrospective observational case series.
This was a multi-center case series of three patients with confirmed tissue diagnosis of ECD that showed intraocular manifestations and were imaged at baseline and follow-up visits.
Intraocular manifestations are rarely observed in association with Erdheim-Chester disease (ECD). Intraocular manifestations of ECD seen on multi-modal imaging include histiocytic choroidal infiltration causing choroidal lesions, complicated by recurrent serous retinal detachment (SRD). Short-term resolution of SRD was observed with ocular therapies including intravitreal injections of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor or verteporfin photodynamic therapy in combination with systemic chemotherapy therapies and oral corticosteroids; however, recurrences were common. Chorioretinal biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of ECD in one case, with the presence of histiocytic infiltration, fibrosis and characteristic immunohistological staining. In another case, with a novel ARAF positive mutation, treatment with sorafenib showed regression of the choroidal lesions and resolution of the SRD on multimodal imaging. These lesions were previously resistant to other forms of therapy.
Rare intraocular manifestations of ECD confirmed on histopathology can be imaged with multimodal imaging. We report three cases, including one case diagnosed through histology from chorioretinal biopsy and another case associated with a novel ARAF mutation responsive to targeted therapy with sorafenib. The identification of novel somatic mutation associated with ECD enabled treatment with a new-targeted systemic agent. Multimodal imaging in these cases can also be used to monitor response to therapy.
Angiogenesis mediated by vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is known to play an important role in regulating cartilage remodelling and endochondral ossification. However, the details of how VEGF signalling mechanisms affect condyle remodelling in response to alterations in functional loading remains unclear. To explore this, eighty 16-day-old male SD rats were divided into two equal groups which were fed either a soft/powdery diet or a hard diet for 4 weeks; the stiffness of the diet results in alteration of mastication force and hence temporomandibular joint (TMJ) development. We performed a proteomic analysis of rat condylar cartilage using isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification (iTRAQ) labelling, followed by 2D nano-high performance liquid chromatography and MALDI-TOF/time-of-flight technology. After protein identification, we used biological information analysis to identify the differentially expressed proteins associated with the VEGF signalling pathway. Among the identified differentially expressed proteins, we found VEGF signalling mainly via the p44/42 MAPK and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways in condylar cartilage, including VEGFD, VGFR2, KPCB, KPCT, KPCZ, ARAF, RASN, PLCG2, PLCG1, JUN and M3K12. Furthermore, four representative protein candidates, VEGF, p38 MAPK and p44/42 MAPK/phospho-p44/42 MAPK, were confirmed by immunohistochemical staining and western blot. Our data suggest that VEGF might play an important role in TMJ development and remodelling in response to alterations in functional loading through the p44/42 MAPK and p38 MAPK signalling pathway. This study provides new clues to the understanding of the signalling mechanism responsible for VEGF production in response to different masticatory functions at the protein level.
The suborder Corynebacterineae encompasses species like Corynebacterium glutamicum, which has been harnessed for industrial production of amino acids, as well as Corynebacterium diphtheriae and Mycobacterium tuberculosis, which cause devastating human diseases. A distinctive component of the Corynebacterineae cell envelope is the mycolyl-arabinogalactan (mAG) complex. The mAG is composed of lipid mycolic acids, and arabinofuranose (Araf) and galactofuranose (Galf) carbohydrate residues. Elucidating microbe-specific differences in mAG composition could advance biotechnological applications and lead to new antimicrobial targets. To this end, we compare and contrast galactan biosynthesis in C. diphtheriae and M. tuberculosis In each species, the galactan is constructed from uridine 5'-diphosphate-α-d-galactofuranose (UDP-Galf), which is generated by the enzyme UDP-galactopyranose mutase (UGM or Glf). UGM and the galactan are essential in M. tuberculosis, but their importance in Corynebacterium species was not known. We show that small molecule inhibitors of UGM impede C. glutamicum growth, suggesting that the galactan is critical in corynebacteria. Previous cell wall analysis data suggest the galactan polymer is longer in mycobacterial species than corynebacterial species. To explore the source of galactan length variation, a C. diphtheriae ortholog of the M. tuberculosis carbohydrate polymerase responsible for the bulk of galactan polymerization, GlfT2, was produced, and its catalytic activity was evaluated. The C. diphtheriae GlfT2 gave rise to shorter polysaccharides than those obtained with the M. tuberculosis GlfT2. These data suggest that GlfT2 alone can influence galactan length. Our results provide tools, both small molecule and genetic, for probing and perturbing the assembly of the Corynebacterineae cell envelope.
In this study, the structural characterization, physicochemical property, antioxidant and antitumor activity of an acidic polysaccharide (APS) from Polygonum multiflorum were investigated. Monosaccharide composition analysis showed APS was composed of arabinose, rhamnose, galactose and galacturonic acid in the molar ratio of 1.23:1.32:1.48:1.00. The presence of uronic acid was also confirmed by the bands at 1740, 1645 and 1425cm(-1) on Fourier transform-infrared spectroscopy. Methylation and nuclear magnetic resonance analyses showed APS was mainly composed by the residues of →5)-α-l-Araf-(1→, →3)-β-d-Galp-(1→, →3,6)-β-d-Galp-(1→, →4)-α-d-GalAp-(1→ and →2)-α-l-Rhap-(1→ in the backbone. The non-reducing terminal α-l-Araf-(1→ was probably attached to the O-6 position of →3,6)-β-d-Galp-(1→ residues. Besides, APS exhibited rod-like and flaky shapes with rough surface. The initial decomposition of APS occurred at 172°C, and the rapidest weight loss rate of APS appeared at 320°C. Antioxidant activity assay showed the DPPH radical scavenging activity of APS was 67.5% at 1mg/mL. At the concentration of 400μg/mL, the antiproliferation activities of APS against HepG-2 and BGC-823 cells were 65.28% and 51.57%, respectively. Our results suggested APS could be a potential antioxidant and antitumor agent.
Activating mutations in the KRAS and BRAF genes, leading to hyperactivation of the RAS/RAF/MAPK oncogenic signaling cascade, are common in patients with colorectal cancer (CRC). While selective BRAF inhibitors are efficacious in BRAFmut melanoma, they have limited efficacy in BRAFmut CRC patients. In a RASmut background, selective BRAF inhibitors are contraindicated due to paradoxical activation of the MAPK pathway through potentiation of CRAF kinase activity. A way to overcome such paradoxical activation is through concurrent inhibition of the kinase activity of both RAF isoforms. Here, we further examined the effects of LY3009120, a panRAF and RAF dimer inhibitor, in human models of CRC with various mutational backgrounds. We demonstrate that LY3009120 induced anti-proliferative effects in BRAFmut and KRASmut CRC cell lines through G1-cell cycle arrest. The anti-proliferative effects of LY3009120 in KRASmut CRC cell lines phenocopied molecular inhibition of RAF isoforms by simultaneous siRNA-mediated knockdown of ARAF, BRAF and CRAF. Additionally, LY3009120 displayed significant activity in in vivo BRAFmut and KRASmut CRC xenograft models. Examination of potential resistance to LY3009120 demonstrated RAF-independent ERK and AKT activation in the KRASmut CRC cell line HCT 116. These findings describe the preclinical activity of a panRAF inhibitor in a BRAFmut and KRASmut CRC setting.
Mutations of the isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) 1 and 2 genes occur in ~80% of lower-grade (WHO grade II and grade III) gliomas. Mutant IDH produces (R)-2-hydroxyglutarate, which induces DNA hypermethylation and presumably drives tumorigenesis. Interestingly, IDH mutations are associated with improved survival in glioma patients, but the underlying mechanism for the difference in survival remains unclear. Through comparative analyses of 286 cases of IDH-wildtype and IDH-mutant lower-grade glioma from a TCGA data set, we report that IDH-mutant gliomas have increased expression of tumor-suppressor genes (NF1, PTEN, and PIK3R1) and decreased expression of oncogenes(AKT2, ARAF, ERBB2, FGFR3, and PDGFRB) and glioma progression genes (FOXM1, IGFBP2, and WWTR1) compared with IDH-wildtype gliomas. Furthermore, each of these genes is prognostic in overall gliomas; however, within the IDH-mutant group, none remains prognostic except IGFBP2 (encodinginsulin-like growth factor binding protein 2). Through validation in an independent cohort, we show that patients with low IGFBP2 expressiondisplay a clear advantage in overall and disease-free survival, whereas those with high IGFBP2 expressionhave worse median survival than IDH-wildtype patients. These observations hold true across different histological and molecular subtypes of lower-grade glioma. We propose therefore that an unexpected biological consequence of IDH mutations in glioma is to ameliorate patient survival by promoting tumor-suppressor signaling while inhibiting that of oncogenes, particularly IGFBP2.
The L-arabinose-inducible araBAD promoter (PBAD) allows tightly controlled and tunable expression of genes of interest in a broad range of bacterial species. It has been successfully used to study bacterial sRNA regulation, where PBAD drives expression of target mRNA translational fusions. Here we report that in Escherichia coli, Spot 42 sRNA can regulate PBAD promoter activity by affecting arabinose uptake. We demonstrate that Spot 42 sRNA represses araF, a gene encoding the AraF subunit of the high-affinity low-capacity arabinose transporter AraFGH, through direct base pairing interactions. We further show that endogenous Spot 42 sRNA is sufficient to repress araF expression under various growth conditions. Finally, we demonstrate this posttranscriptional repression has a biological consequence, decreasing the induction of PBAD at low levels of arabinose. This problem can be circumvented using strategies reported previously for avoiding all-or-none induction behavior, that is through constitutive expression of the low-affinity high-capacity arabinose transporter AraE or induction with higher concentration of inducers. This work adds araF to the set of Spot 42-regulated genes, in agreement with previous studies suggesting that Spot 42, itself negatively regulated by cAMP-CRP complex, reinforces the catabolite repression network.
The bacterial arabinose inducible system is widely used for titratable control of gene expression. We demonstrate here that a post-transcriptional mechanism mediated by the Spot 42 sRNA contributes to the functionality of the PBAD system at subsaturating inducer concentrations by affecting inducer uptake. Our finding extends the inputs into the known transcriptional control for the PBAD system, and has implications for improving its usage for tunable gene expression.
Sugarcane bagasse and straw are generated in large volumes as by-products of agro-industrial production. They are an emerging valuable resource for the generation of hemicellulose-based materials and products, since they contain significant quantities of xylans (often twice as much as in hardwoods). Heteroxylans (yields of ca 20% based on xylose content in sugarcane bagasse and straw) were successfully isolated and purified using mild delignification followed by dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) extraction. Delignification with peracetic acid (PAA) was more efficient than traditional sodium chlorite (NaClO2) delignification for xylan extraction from both biomasses, resulting in higher extraction yields and purity. We have shown that the heteroxylans isolated from sugarcane bagasse and straw are acetylated glucuronoarabinoxylans (GAX), with distinct molecular structures. Bagasse GAX had a slightly lower glycosyl substitution molar ratio of Araf to Xylp to (0.5:10) and (4-O-Me)GlpA to Xylp (0.1:10) than GAX from straw (0.8:10 and 0.1:10 respectively), but a higher degree of acetylation (0.33 and 0.10, respectively). A higher frequency of acetyl groups substitution at position α-(1→3) (Xyl-3Ac) than at position α-(1→2) (Xyl-2Ac) was confirmed for both bagasse and straw GAX, with a minor ratio of diacetylation (Xyl-2,3Ac). The size and molecular weight distributions for the acetylated GAX extracted from the sugarcane bagasse and straw were analyzed using multiple-detection size-exclusion chromatography (SEC-DRI-MALLS). Light scattering data provided absolute molar mass values for acetylated GAX with higher average values than did standard calibration. Moreover, the data highlighted differences in the molar mass distributions between the two isolation methods for both types of sugarcane GAX, which can be correlated with the different Araf and acetyl substitution patterns. We have developed an empirical model for the molecular structure of acetylated GAX extracted from sugarcane bagasse and straw with PAA/DMSO through the integration of results obtained from glycosidic linkage analysis, (1)H NMR spectroscopy and acetyl quantification. This knowledge of the structure of xylans in sugarcane bagasse and straw will provide a better understanding of the isolation-structure-properties relationship of these biopolymers and, ultimately, create new possibilities for the use of sugarcane xylan in high-value applications, such as biochemicals and bio-based materials.
Background: Switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) is a C4 perennial prairie grass and a dedicated feedstock for lignocellulosic biofuels. Saccharification and biofuel yields are inhibited by the plant cell wall's natural recalcitrance against enzymatic degradation. Plant hemicellulose polysaccharides such as arabinoxylans structurally support and cross-link other cell wall polymers. Grasses predominately have Type II cell walls that are abundant in arabinoxylan, which comprise nearly 25% of aboveground biomass. A primary component of arabinoxylan synthesis is uridine diphosphate (UDP) linked to arabinofuranose (Araf). A family of UDP-arabinopyranose mutase (UAM)/reversible glycosylated polypeptides catalyze the interconversion between UDP-arabinopyranose (UDP-Arap) and UDP-Araf. Results: The expression of a switchgrass arabinoxylan biosynthesis pathway gene, PvUAM1, was decreased via RNAi to investigate its role in cell wall recalcitrance in the feedstock. PvUAM1 encodes a switchgrass homolog of UDP-arabinose mutase, which converts UDP-Arap to UDP-Araf. Southern blot analysis revealed each transgenic line contained between one to at least seven T-DNA insertions, resulting in some cases, a 95% reduction of native PvUAM1 transcript in stem internodes. Transgenic plants had increased pigmentation in vascular tissues at nodes, but were otherwise similar in morphology to the non-transgenic control. Cell wall-associated arabinose was decreased in leaves and stems by over 50%, but there was an increase in cellulose. In addition, there was a commensurate change in arabinose side chain extension. Cell wall lignin composition was altered with a concurrent increase in lignin content and transcript abundance of lignin biosynthetic genes in mature tillers. Enzymatic saccharification efficiency was unchanged in the transgenic plants relative to the control. Conclusion: Plants with attenuated PvUAM1 transcript had increased cellulose and lignin in cell walls. A decrease in cell wall-associated arabinose was expected, which was likely caused by fewer Araf residues in the arabinoxylan. The decrease in arabinoxylan may cause a compensation response to maintain cell wall integrity by increasing cellulose and lignin biosynthesis. In cases in which increased lignin is desired, e.g., feedstocks for carbon fiber production, downregulated UAM1 coupled with altered expression of other arabinoxylan biosynthesis genes might result in even higher production of lignin in biomass.
The aim of this study was to characterize a polysaccharide found in citrus peels with an anti-metastatic property. CPE-II was purified by the pectinase digestion of citrus peels. During in vivo lung metastasis of Colon26-M3.1, administration of 10μg of CPE-II per mouse showed 81.3% inhibition of metastasis. CPE-II consists of 15 different monosaccharides and 22 different glycosyl linkages, characteristic of rhamnogalacturonan II (RG-II). The primary structure was elucidated based on sugar composition, methylation analysis, oligosaccharide analysis, and sequencing using GC, GC-MS, LC-MS, and ESI-MS/MS analyses. Sequential degradation using partial acid hydrolysis indicated that CPE-II contained Rhap-(1→5)-Kdo, Araf-(1→5)-Dha, an AceA-containing nonasaccharide, and an uronic acid-rich oligosaccharide in addition to an α-(1→4)-galacturono-oligosaccharide main chain. The molecular weight of CPE-II was observed to decrease from 9 to 5kDa at a pH value of &lt;2.0, as observed by HPSEC. Thus, we propose that the anti-metastatic CPE-II is primarily present as an RG-II dimer.
The aim of this work was to investigate the core structure of a Dendrobium huoshanense polysaccharide DHPD1 required for the inhibition of lens epithelial cell apoptosis. In order to obtain the fragments containing the core domain, pectinase was employed to hydrolyze DHPD1. After 24h reaction, it is interesting that the hydrolyzation seemed to be stopped, leading to a final enzymatic fragment DHPD1-24 with molecular weight about 1552Da. Compared to DHPD1, although the bioactivity is decreased, DHPD1-24 remained the ability to inhibit the H2O2-induced apoptosis of human lens epithelial (HLE) cells via suppressing the MAPK signaling pathways. These results suggested that DHPD1-24 might be the core domain required for DHPD1 to inhibit HLE cell apoptosis. Methylation analysis showed DHPD1-24 was composed of (1→5)-linked-Araf, (1→3,6)-linked-Manp, 1-linked-Glcp, (1→4)-linked-Glcp, (1→6)-linked-Glcp, (1→4,6)-linked-Glcp, (1→6)-linked-Galp and 1-linked-Xylp in a molar ratio of 1.06:1.53:2.11:2.04:0.93:0.91:0.36:1.01. Moreover, the primary structural features of DHPD1-24 were characterized by NMR spectrum.
Occurrence of azole-resistant Aspergillus fumigatus (ARAF) in the environment is an emerging problem worldwide, likely impacting on patient treatment. Several resistance mutations are thought to have initially arisen through triazole-based fungicide use in agriculture and subsequently being propagated in a similar manner. Here we investigated the prevalence of ARAF in the environment of Thailand and characterized their susceptibility profiles toward clinically used azole compounds along with underlying resistance mutations. Three hundred and eight soil samples were collected and analyzed, out of which 3.25% (n = 10) were positive for ARAF. All isolates obtained were resistant to Itraconazol (MIC ≥ 8 μg/ml), two showed additional increased MIC values toward Posaconazol (MIC = 0.5 μg/ml), and one other toward Voriconazol (MIC = 2 μg/ml). Sequencing of the respective cyp51A genes revealed that eight of the isolates carried the TR34/L98H allele and those two with elevated MIC values to Posaconazol the G54R substitution. Although a clear correlation between the use of triazole-based fungicides and isolation of ARAF strains from agricultural lands could not be established for Thailand, but this study clearly demonstrates the spread of globally observed ARAF strains to the environment of South East Asia.
The axy43A gene encoding the intracellular trifunctional xylanolytic enzyme from Paenibacillus curdlanolyticus B-6 was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli Recombinant PcAxy43A consisting of a family 43 glycoside hydrolase and a family 6 carbohydrate-binding module exhibited endo-xylanase, β-xylosidase, and arabinoxylan arabinofuranohydrolase activities. PcAxy43A hydrolyzed xylohexaose and birch wood xylan to release a series of xylooligosaccharides, indicating that PcAxy43A contained endo-xylanase activity. PcAxy43A exhibited β-xylosidase activity toward a chromogenic substrate, p-nitrophenyl-β-d-xylopyranoside, and xylobiose while it preferred to hydrolyze long-chain xylooligosaccharides rather than xylobiose. In addition, surprisingly, PcAxy43A showed arabinoxylan arabinofuranohydrolase activity; that is, it released arabinose from both singly and doubly arabinosylated xylose, α-L-Araf-(1→2)-D-Xylp or α-L-Araf-(1→3)-D-Xylp and α-L-Araf-(1→2)-[α-L-Araf-(1→3)]-β-D-Xylp Moreover, the combination of PcAxy43A and P. curdlanolyticus B-6 endo-xylanase Xyn10C greatly improved the efficiency of xylose and arabinose production from the highly substituted rye arabinoxylan, suggesting that these two enzymes function synergistically to depolymerize arabinoxylan. Therefore, PcAxy43A has the potential for saccharification of arabinoxylan into simple sugars for many applications.
In this study, the GH43 intracellular multifunctional endo-xylanase, β-xylosidase and AXH from P. curdlanolyticus B-6 was characterized. Interestingly, PcAxy43A AXH showed a new property that acted on both the C(O)2 and C(O)3 positions of di-arabinosyl-substituted xylose residues, which usually obstruct the action of xylanolytic enzymes. Furthermore, the studies here show interesting properties for the processing of xylans from cereal grains, particularly rye arabinoxylan, and show a novel relationship between PcAxh43A and endo-xylanase Xyn10C from strain B-6 providing novel metabolic potential for processing arabinoxylans to xylose and arabinose.
The adoption of high-throughput technologies has led to a transformation in our ability to classify diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) into unique molecular subtypes. In parallel, the expansion of agents targeting key genetic and gene expression signatures has led to an unprecedented opportunity to personalize cancer therapies, paving the way for precision medicine. Areas covered: This review summarizes the key molecular subtypes of DLBCL and outlines the novel technology platforms in development to discriminate clinically relevant subtypes. Expert commentary: The application of emerging diagnostic tests into routine clinical practise is gaining momentum following the demonstration of subtype specific activity by novel agents. Co-ordinated efforts are required to ensure that these state of the art technologies provide reliable and clinically meaningful results accessible to the wider haematology community.
The spikes of Prunella vulgaris have long been used as a traditional Chinese medicine to treat various inflammation-related diseases. The aim of this study was to isolate and characterize homogenous polysaccharides from this herb and to evaluate their anticomplement activity.
Anticomplement activity-guided fractionation of the hot water extract of P. vulgaris was performed by DEAE-cellulose and size-exclusion chromatography, yielding two homogeneous polysaccharides PW-PS1 and PW-PS2. The homogeneity, molecular weight, monosaccharide composition and linkage of the two polysaccharides were determined in addition to other chemical characterizations. The anticomplement activity of the polysaccharides was evaluated and expressed as 50% hemolytic inhibition concentration through the classical pathway (CH50 value) and alternative pathway (AP50 value). The preliminary mechanism for the complement activation cascade was also assessed.
PW-PS1 and PW-PS2 were both branched acidic polysaccharides. PW-PS1 was composed of Ara, Xyl, and 4-methoxy-Glc A in a ratio of 1.0: 2.6: 0.8. The main linkages of the sugar residues of PW-PS1 included terminal β-d-Xylp, 1,4-linked β-d-Xylp, 1,3-linked α-d-Arap, 1,3,5-linked α-d-Arap, and terminal 4-methoxy-α-d-Glcp A. PW-PS2 was composed of Rha, Ara, Xyl, Gal, and Gal A in a ratio of 0.6: 1.0: 1.3: 1.8: 3.4. The main linkages between the sugar residues of PW-PS2 included terminal Araf, 1,4-linked β-d-Xylp, 1,3-linked α-d-Rhap, terminal α-d-Galp, and 1,4,6-linked α-d-Galp. PW-PS1 and PW-PS2 inhibited complement activation through both the classical and alternative pathways with CH50 values of 0.28 and 0.13mg/mL, respectively, and AP50 values of 0.40 and 0.35mg/mL, respectively. Preliminary mechanism studies using complement component-depleted sera showed that PW-PS1 acted on the C1q, C3, and C9 components and that PW-PS2 acted on the C1q, C2, C3, C5, and C9 components.
Our study suggested that PW-PS1 and PW-PS2 could be valuable for the treatment of diseases associated with the excessive activation of the complement system.
Extracellular phosphate plays a key role in growth plate maturation by inducing Erk1/2 (Mapk3/1) phosphorylation, leading to hypertrophic chondrocyte apoptosis. The Raf kinases induce Mek1/2 (Map2k1/2) and Erk1/2 phosphorylation; however, a role for Raf kinases in endochondral bone formation has not been identified. Ablation of both A-Raf (Araf) and B-Raf (Braf) in chondrocytes does not alter growth plate maturation. Because c-Raf (Raf1) phosphorylation is increased by extracellular phosphate and c-Raf is the predominant isoform expressed in hypertrophic chondrocytes, chondrocyte-specific c-Raf knockout mice (c-Raf(f/f);ColII-Cre(+)) were generated to define a role for c-Raf in growth plate maturation. In vivo studies demonstrated that loss of c-Raf in chondrocytes leads to expansion of the hypertrophic layer of the growth plate, with decreased phospho-Erk1/2 immunoreactivity and impaired hypertrophic chondrocyte apoptosis. However, cultured hypertrophic chondrocytes from these mice did not exhibit impairment of phosphate-induced Erk1/2 phosphorylation. Studies performed to reconcile the discrepancy between the in vitro and in vivo hypertrophic chondrocyte phenotypes revealed normal chondrocyte differentiation in c-Raf(f/f);ColII-Cre(+) mice and lack of compensatory increase in the expression of A-Raf and B-Raf. However, VEGF (Vegfa) immunoreactivity in the hypertrophic chondrocytes of c-Raf(f/f);ColII-Cre(+) mice was significantly reduced, associated with increased ubiquitylation of VEGF protein. Thus, c-Raf plays an important role in growth plate maturation by regulating vascular invasion, which is crucial for replacement of terminally differentiated hypertrophic chondrocytes by bone.
Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (iCCA) is a fatal bile duct cancer with dismal prognosis and limited therapeutic options. By performing RNA- and exome-sequencing analyses, we report a novel fusion event, FGFR2-PPHLN1 (16%), and damaging mutations in the ARAF oncogene (11%). Here we demonstrate that the chromosomal translocation t(10;12)(q26;q12) leading to FGFR2-PPHLN1 fusion possesses transforming and oncogenic activity, which is successfully inhibited by a selective FGFR2 inhibitor in vitro. Among the ARAF mutations, N217I and G322S lead to activation of the pathway and N217I shows oncogenic potential in vitro. Screening of a cohort of 107 iCCA patients reveals that FGFR2 fusions represent the most recurrent targetable alteration (45%, 17/107), while they are rarely present in other primary liver tumours (0/100 of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC); 1/21 of mixed iCCA-HCC). Taken together, around 70% of iCCA patients harbour at least one actionable molecular alteration (FGFR2 fusions, IDH1/2, ARAF, KRAS, BRAF and FGF19) that is amenable for therapeutic targeting.
The RAF family of kinases mediates RAS signaling, and RAF inhibitors can be effective for treating tumors with BRAF(V600E) mutant protein. However, RAF inhibitors paradoxically accelerate metastasis in RAS-mutant tumors and become ineffective in BRAF(V600E) tumors because of reactivation of downstream mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling. We found that the RAF isoform ARAF has an obligatory role in promoting MAPK activity and cell migration in a cell type-dependent manner. Knocking down ARAF prevented the activation of MAPK kinase 1 (MEK1) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) and decreased the number of protrusions from tumor cell spheroids in three-dimensional culture that were induced by BRAF(V600E)-specific or BRAF/CRAF inhibitors (GDC-0879 and sorafenib, respectively). RAF inhibitors induced the homodimerization of ARAF and the heterodimerization of BRAF with CRAF and the scaffolding protein KSR1. In a purified protein solution, recombinant proteins of the three RAF isoforms competed for binding to MEK1. In cells in culture, overexpressing mutants of ARAF that could not homodimerize impaired the interaction between ARAF and endogenous MEK1 and thus prevented the subsequent activation of MEK1 and ERK1/2. Our findings reveal a new role for ARAF in directly activating the MAPK cascade and promoting tumor cell invasion and suggest a new therapeutic target for RAS- and RAF-mediated cancers.
In this issue of Blood, Nelson et al describe a novel somatic ARAF mutation in a child with Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) and demonstrate that the encoded protein has strong gain-of-function properties. Importantly, this mutant A-Raf molecule is sensitive to inhibition by vemurafenib, a potent and selective Raf kinase inhibitor that is Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved for the treatment of advanced melanoma. This work thus identifies a new driver mutation in LCH that is potentially actionable in the clinic.
The extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling pathway is activated in Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) histiocytes, but only 60% of cases carry somatic activating mutations of BRAF. To identify other genetic causes of ERK pathway activation, we performed whole exome sequencing on purified LCH cells in 3 cases. One patient with wild-type BRAF alleles in his histiocytes had compound mutations in the kinase domain of ARAF. Unlike wild-type ARAF, this mutant was a highly active mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase in vitro and was capable of transforming mouse embryo fibroblasts. Mutant ARAF activity was inhibited by vemurafenib, a BRAF inhibitor, indicating the importance of fully evaluating ERK pathway abnormalities in selecting LCH patients for targeted inhibitor therapy.
Targeted cancer therapies often induce "outlier" responses in molecularly defined patient subsets. One patient with advanced-stage lung adenocarcinoma, who was treated with oral sorafenib, demonstrated a near-complete clinical and radiographic remission for 5 years. Whole-genome sequencing and RNA sequencing of primary tumor and normal samples from this patient identified a somatic mutation, ARAF S214C, present in the cancer genome and expressed at high levels. Additional mutations affecting this residue of ARAF and a nearby residue in the related kinase RAF1 were demonstrated across 1% of an independent cohort of lung adenocarcinoma cases. The ARAF mutations were shown to transform immortalized human airway epithelial cells in a sorafenib-sensitive manner. These results suggest that mutant ARAF is an oncogenic driver in lung adenocarcinoma and an indicator of sorafenib response.
The MAPK signaling pathway plays a crucial role in tumorgenesis and cell proliferation in human papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC). Ret/PTC rearrangements, RAS and BRAF mutations, the main non-overlapping genetic alterations all leading to MAPK cascade activation, are cumulatively identified in 60-80% of PTCs. In approximately one-fourth of the cases, oncogenic background potentially contributing to MAPK activation in PTC might be different. We therefore attempted to evaluate the mutational status of genes encoding other members of RAF family known to act upstream of MAPKs, ARAF and CRAF (RAF-1). In addition we also analyzed the MET gene that encodes hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor receptor overexpressed in most of PTCs and a MAPK cascade contributor. In 129 Japanese patients with PTC, BRAF(T1799A) was detected in 65 cases (50.4%), and the remaining 64 tumor specimens were subjected to mutation analysis of kinase domains of ARAF, CRAF and MET genes, and hotspots of K- and N-RAS genes. No ARAF, CRAF, MET, K- and N-RAS mutations were revealed. Based on these observations, we concluded that despite the fact that ARAF, CRAF and MET are actively expressed, alterations of these genes are rare in PTC and unlikely to play a perceptible role in the molecular pathogenesis of this type of human malignancy.
Deregulation of RAS signal transduction has been implicated in the malignant growth of human cancer cells. The BRAF gene, encoding a RAF family member in the downstream pathway of RAS, is somatically mutated in a number of human cancers, raising the possibility that other RAF family members might be mutated in human cancers. In this study we analyzed the genomic DNAs for the detection of somatic mutations of the ARAF gene in 60 human cancer cell lines and 323 primary human cancer tissues, including colorectal carcinomas, gastric carcinomas, ovarian tumors and acute leukemias. The MOLT-4 leukemia cell line was found to harbor an ARAF gene mutation resulting in an amino acid substitution (A451T) at the activation segment in the kinase domain of ARAF. In the cancer tissues we could not detect any ARAF gene mutation. Our data indicate that, in contrast to the BRAF gene, the ARAF gene is rarely mutated in human cancers, and suggest that alterations of the RAS pathway by ARAF gene mutation may not play an important role in the pathogenesis of human cancers.
Colorectal cancer is a multi-step process characterized by a sequence of genetic alterations in cell growth regulatory genes, such as the adenomatous polyposis coli, KRAS, p53 and DCC genes. In the present study mutation analysis was performed with SSCA/direct sequencing of the hot-spot regions in exons 11 and 15 for the BRAF gene and exons 1-2 for the KRAS gene in 130 primary colorectal cancer tumors and correlated with clinico-pathological and mutational data. We also performed mutation analysis of the corresponding conserved regions in the ARAF and RAF-1 genes. Mutations in the BRAF and KRAS genes were found in 11.5 and 40% of the tumors, respectively. One germline exonic and nine germline intronic genetic variants were found in the ARAF and RAF-1 genes. All of the BRAF mutations were located in the kinase domain of the conserved region 3 in exon 15 of the BRAF gene. One novel somatic mutation was also identified in the BRAF gene. The majority of the BRAF mutations were found in colon compared with rectal tumors (P = 0.014). In agreement with others, a statistically significant correlation between BRAF mutations and microsatellite instability could be found. A negative correlation was also evident between mutations in the BRAF and KRAS genes, which supports earlier studies where somatic mutations in these genes are mutually exclusive. Collectively, our results provide support for the idea that activation of the MAP kinase pathway, especially via BRAF and KRAS mutations, is of critical importance for the development of colorectal cancer.
Genes encoding the neuron-specific phosphoprotein synapsin I (SYN1), the glycoprotein tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases (TIMP), the proto-oncogene A-raf-1 (ARAF1), and properdin (PFC), a positive regulator of the alternative pathway of human complement, lie within a conserved synteny encompassing the proximal short arm of the human X chromosome (Xp21.1-p11) and the centromeric end of the mouse X chromosome (A1-A5). We have used a mouse interspecific cross to demonstrate genetic linkage of Syn-1, Timp, and Araf and also show physical linkage, with Timp lying only 10 kb from Araf, within an intron of the Syn-1 gene. Detailed restriction mapping shows that Timp is transcribed in the same direction as Araf but in the opposite direction to the Syn-1 gene. Analysis of the corresponding region of the human X chromosome indicates a similar arrangement and in addition shows that the properdin gene lies within 5 kb of the 5' end of the synapsin I gene.
Sorafenib is a RAF inhibitor approved for several cancers, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Inhibition of RAF kinases can induce a dose-dependent "paradoxical" upregulation of the downstream mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway in cancer cells. It is unknown whether "paradoxical" ERK activation occurs after sorafenib therapy in HCC, and if so, if it impacts the therapeutic efficacy. Here, we demonstrate that RAF inhibition by sorafenib rapidly leads to RAF dimerization and ERK activation in HCCs, which contributes to treatment evasion. The transactivation of RAF dimers and ERK signaling promotes HCC cell survival, prevents apoptosis via downregulation of BIM and achieves immunosuppression by MAPK/NF-kB-dependent activation of PD-L1 gene expression. To overcome treatment evasion and reduce systemic effects, we developed CXCR4-targeted nanoparticles to co-deliver sorafenib with the MEK inhibitor AZD6244 in HCC. Using this approach, we preferentially and efficiently inactivated RAF/ERK, upregulated BIM and down-regulated PD-L1 expression in HCC, and facilitated intra-tumoral infiltration of cytotoxic CD8+ T cells. These effects resulted in a profound delay in tumor growth. Thus, this nano-delivery strategy to selectively target tumors and prevent the paradoxical ERK activation could increase the feasibility of dual RAF/MEK inhibition to overcome sorafenib treatment escape in HCC.
Neuroblastoma, a rapidly growing yet treatment responsive cancer, is the third most common cancer of children and the most common solid tumor in infants. Unfortunately, neuroblastoma that has lost p53 function often has a highly treatment-resistant phenotype leading to tragic outcomes. In the context of neuroblastoma, the functions of p53 and MYCN (which is amplified in ~25% of neuroblastomas) are integrally linked because they are mutually transcriptionally regulated, and because they together regulate the catalytic activity of RNA polymerases. Didymin is a citrus-derived natural compound that kills p53 wild-type as well as drug-resistant p53-mutant neuroblastoma cells in culture. In addition, orally administered didymin causes regression of neuroblastoma xenografts in mouse models, without toxicity to non-malignant cells, neural tissues, or neural stem cells. RKIP is a Raf-inhibitory protein that regulates MYCN activation, is transcriptionally upregulated by didymin, and appears to play a key role in the anti-neuroblastoma actions of didymin. In this review, we discuss how didymin overcomes drug-resistance in p53-mutant neuroblastoma through RKIP-mediated inhibition of MYCN and its effects on GRK2, PKCs, Let-7 micro-RNA, and clathrin-dependent endocytosis by Raf-dependent and -independent mechanisms. In addition, we will discuss studies supporting potential clinical impact and translation of didymin as a low cost, safe, and effective oral agent that could change the current treatment paradigm for refractory neuroblastoma.
Graphene oxide (GO) can be potentially used in many medical and industrial fields. Using assay system of Caenorhabditis elegans, we identified the NLG-1/Neuroligin-mediated neuronal signaling dysregulated by GO exposure. In nematodes, GO exposure significantly decreased the expression of NLG-1, a postsynaptic cell adhesion protein. Loss-of-function mutation of nlg-1 gene resulted in a susceptible property of nematodes to GO toxicity. Rescue experiments suggested that NLG-1 could act in AIY interneurons to regulate the response to GO exposure. In the AIY interneurons, PKC-1, a serine/threonine protein kinase C (PKC) protein, was identified as the downstream target for NLG-1 in the regulation of response to GO exposure. LIN-45, a Raf protein in ERK signaling pathway, was further identified as the downstream target for PKC-1 in the regulation of response to GO exposure. Therefore, GO may dysregulate NLG-1-mediated molecular signaling in the interneurons, and a neuronal signaling cascade of NLG-1-PKC-1-LIN-45 was raised to be required for the control of response to GO exposure. More importantly, intestinal RNAi knockdown of daf-16 gene encoding a FOXO transcriptional factor in insulin signaling pathway suppressed the resistant property of nematodes overexpressing NLG-1 to GO toxicity, suggesting the possible link between neuronal NLG-1 signaling and intestinal insulin signaling in the regulation of response to GO exposure.
Oncogenic activation of protein kinase BRAF drives tumor growth by promoting mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway signaling. Because oncogenic mutations in BRAF occur in ∼2-7% of lung adenocarcinoma (LA), BRAF-mutant LA is the most frequent cause of BRAF-mutant cancer mortality worldwide. Whereas most tumor types harbor predominantly the BRAF(V600E)-mutant allele, the spectrum of BRAF mutations in LA includes BRAF(V600E) (∼60% of cases) and non-V600E mutant alleles (∼40% of cases) such as BRAF(G469A) and BRAF(G466V) The presence of BRAF(V600E) in LA has prompted clinical trials testing selective BRAF inhibitors such as vemurafenib in BRAF(V600E)-mutant patients. Despite promising clinical efficacy, both innate and acquired resistance often result from reactivation of MAPK pathway signaling, thus limiting durable responses to the current BRAF inhibitors. Further, the optimal therapeutic strategy to block non-V600E BRAF-mutant LA remains unclear. Here, we report the efficacy of the Raf proto-oncogene serine/threonine protein kinase (RAF) inhibitor, PLX8394, that evades MAPK pathway reactivation in BRAF-mutant LA models. We show that PLX8394 treatment is effective in both BRAF(V600E) and certain non-V600 LA models, in vitro and in vivo. PLX8394 was effective against treatment-naive BRAF-mutant LAs and those with acquired vemurafenib resistance caused by an alternatively spliced, truncated BRAF(V600E) that promotes vemurafenib-insensitive MAPK pathway signaling. We further show that acquired PLX8394 resistance occurs via EGFR-mediated RAS-mTOR signaling and is prevented by upfront combination therapy with PLX8394 and either an EGFR or mTOR inhibitor. Our study provides a biological rationale and potential polytherapy strategy to aid the deployment of PLX8394 in lung cancer patients.
Autophagy plays a critical role in maintaining cell homeostasis in response to various stressors through protein conjugation and activation of lysosome-dependent degradation. MAP1LC3B/LC3B (microtubule- associated protein 1 light chain 3 β) is conjugated with phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) in the membranes and regulates initiation of autophagy through interaction with many autophagy-related proteins possessing an LC3-interacting region (LIR) motif, which is composed of 2 hydrophobic amino acids (tryptophan and leucine) separated by 2 non-conserved amino acids (WXXL). In this study, we identified a new putative LIR motif in PEBP1/RKIP (phosphatidylethanolamine binding protein 1) that was originally isolated as a PE-binding protein and also a cellular inhibitor of MAPK/ERK signaling. PEBP1 was specifically bound to PE-unconjugated LC3 in cells, and mutation (WXXL mutated to AXXA) of this LIR motif disrupted its interaction with LC3 proteins. Interestingly, overexpression of PEBP1 significantly inhibited starvation-induced autophagy by activating the AKT and MTORC1 (mechanistic target of rapamycin [serine/threonine kinase] complex 1) signaling pathway and consequently suppressing the ULK1 (unc-51 like autophagy activating kinase 1) activity. In contrast, ablation of PEBP1 expression dramatically promoted the autophagic process under starvation conditions. Furthermore, PEBP1 lacking the LIR motif highly stimulated starvation-induced autophagy through the AKT-MTORC1-dependent pathway. PEBP1 phosphorylation at Ser153 caused dissociation of LC3 from the PEBP1-LC3 complex for autophagy induction. PEBP1-dependent suppression of autophagy was not associated with the MAPK pathway. These findings suggest that PEBP1 can act as a negative mediator in autophagy through stimulation of the AKT-MTORC1 pathway and direct interaction with LC3.
Mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinases (MAPKKKs) function at the top level of MAPK cascades and play important roles in plant development and stress responses. Although MAPKKKs comprise the largest family in the MAPK cascades, very few Raf-like MAPKKKs have been functionally identified, especially in the economically important crop cotton. In this study, a Raf-like MAPKKK gene, GhRaf19, was characterized for the first time in cotton. Our data show that the expression of GhRaf19 was inhibited by PEG and NaCl and induced by cold (4°C) and H2O2. Furthermore, when GhRaf19 was silenced in cotton using virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS), tolerance to drought and salt stress were enhanced, the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) was reduced, and ROS-related gene expression was increased. Consistent with these results, in N. benthamiana, overexpressing-GhRaf19 reduced tolerance to drought and salt. However, GhRaf19-silenced plants showed lowered resistance to cold in cotton, and this effect was correlated with the accumulation of ROS. In contrast, overexpressing GhRaf19 in N. benthamiana increased resistance to cold by inducing higher levels of expression and activity of ROS-related antioxidant genes/enzymes. These results indicate that GhRaf19 negatively regulates tolerance to drought and salt and positively regulates resistance to cold stress by modulating cellular ROS in cotton.
Aerobic organisms survive low oxygen (O2) through activation of diverse molecular, metabolic, and physiological responses. In most plants, root water permeability (in other words, hydraulic conductivity, Lpr) is downregulated under O2 deficiency. Here, we used a quantitative genetics approach in Arabidopsis to clone Hydraulic Conductivity of Root 1 (HCR1), a Raf-like MAPKKK that negatively controls Lpr. HCR1 accumulates and is functional under combined O2 limitation and potassium (K(+)) sufficiency. HCR1 regulates Lpr and hypoxia responsive genes, through the control of RAP2.12, a key transcriptional regulator of the core anaerobic response. A substantial variation of HCR1 in regulating Lpr is observed at the Arabidopsis species level. Thus, by combinatorially integrating two soil signals, K(+) and O2 availability, HCR1 modulates the resilience of plants to multiple flooding scenarios.
Many edible mushrooms have become attractive as "health foods" and as source materials for immunomodulators. To increase our insight in the immune-modulatory properties of a polysaccharide of the oyster mushroom Pleurotus citrinopileatus, PCPS, we analyzed its effects on the function of human dendritic cells (DCs). We showed that PCPS induces upregulation of the surface maturation markers CD80, CD86 and HLA-DR on DCs, indicating its potential to induce DC maturation. In addition, PCPS stimulates DCs to secrete the pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF, IL-1β, IL-6 and IL-12, as well as the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10, and induces enhanced mRNA levels of the chemokines CCL2, CCL3, CCL8, CXCL9, CXCL10, and LTA. The secretion of TNF and IL-12 by PCPS-activated DCs could significantly be decreased by an anti-Dectin-1 antibody, as well as by a Syk kinase and a Raf-1 inhibitor, indicating that PCPS induces Dectin-1 signaling at least partly through the Syk- and the Raf-1-dependent pathways in DCs. Structural analysis of PCPS suggests that this polysaccharide is a β-1,3-branched β-1,6-glucan, which is in line with its capacity to activate Dectin-1. We showed that PCPS can induce TLR2 and TLR4, but not TLR3, signaling using TLR-HEK293 reporter cell lines. In human DCs, the effect of PCPS was additively increased by TLR4 activation, and synergistically enhanced by stimulation of TLR2, suggesting that interaction of PCPS with these TLRs contributes to the observed DC modulation. In conclusion, PCPS has the capacity to activate human DCs via multiple pathways.
Approximately half of BRAF-mutated Non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLCs) harbor a non-V600 BRAF mutation, accounting for ~40,000 annual deaths worldwide. Recent studies have revealed the benefits of combined targeted therapy with a RAF-inhibitor (Dabrafenib) and a MEK-inhibitor (Trametinib) in treating V600 BRAF mutant cancers, including NSCLC. In contrast, sensitivity of non-V600 BRAF mutations to these inhibitors is not documented. Non-V600 mutations can either increase or impair BRAF kinase activity. However, impaired BRAF kinases can still activate the ERK pathway in a CRAF-dependent manner. Herein, beyond describing a cohort of BRAF mutant NSCLC patients and functionally analyzing 13 tumor-derived BRAF mutations, we demonstrate that both types of non-V600 BRAF mutations can be sensitive to clinically relevant doses of Dabrafenib and Trametinib in HEK293T cells, in lung epithelial cellular model (BEAS-2B) and in human cancer cell lines harboring non-V600 BRAF mutations. ERK activity induced by both types of these mutations is further reduced by combinatorial drug treatment. Moreover, the combination leads to more prolonged ERK inhibition and has anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic effects in cells harboring both types of non-V600 BRAF mutations. This study provides a basis for the clinical exploration of non-V600 BRAF mutant lung cancers upon treatment with Trametinib and Dabrafenib.
The effectiveness of RAF inhibitors is based on the combined effects of two allosteric mechanisms.
Newcastle disease (ND) is still one of the major plagues of birds worldwide. Combat actions are limited to vaccines, highlighting the urgent need for new and amply available antiviral drugs. Previous results have shown that Newcastle disease virus (NDV) downregulates the intracellular Raf kinase inhibitor protein (RKIP) expression for efficient replication, suggesting that this molecular may be a suitable target for antiviral intervention. In the present work, we investigated whether or not the Raf kinase inhibitor V (RKIV), which functions in the same way as RKIP by targeting the intracellular Raf kinase, is able to suppress the propagation of enzootic virulent NDV in vitro and in vivo. In vitro antiviral activity of RKIV was assessed by cell-based assay, and in vivo activity was determined in the chicken model. Our results clearly showed that RKIV treatment protected the cells from NDV-induced CPE with the effective concentrations on nM level, and inhibited virus replication in the lungs of infected chickens in a dose-dependent manner and protected chickens from the lethal infection by NDV. Thus, we conclude that the Raf kinase inhibitor compound RKIV, by inhibiting the host cellular target Raf kinase, might be very promising as a new class of antivirals against the enzootic virulent NDV infection.
RAF family kinases are central components of the Ras-RAF-MEK-ERK cascade. Dimerization is a key mechanism of RAF activation in response to physiological, pathological and pharmacological signals. It is mediated by a dimer interface region in the RAF kinase domain that is also conserved in KSR, a scaffolding protein that binds RAF, MEK and ERK. The regulation of RAF dimerization is incompletely understood. Especially little is known about the molecular mechanism involved in the selection of the dimerization partner. Previously, we reported that Ras-dependent binding of the tumour suppressor DiRas3 to C-RAF inhibits the C-RAF:B-RAF heterodimerization. Here we show that DiRas3 binds to KSR1 independently of its interaction with activated Ras and RAF. Our data also suggest that depending on the local stoichiometry between DiRas3 and oncogenic Ras, DiRas3 can either enhance homodimerization of KSR1 or recruit KSR1 to the Ras:C-RAF complex and thereby reduce the availability of C-RAF for binding to B-RAF. This mechanism, which is shared between A-RAF and C-RAF, may be involved in the regulation of Ras12V-induced cell transformation by DiRas3.
Regulation of osteoblast activity by mechanical stress is important for bone remodeling. However, the precise mechanotransduction mechanism that triggers the anabolic reaction of osteoblasts is largely unknown. In this study, we performed RNA interference (RNAi) screening to identify the signaling molecules upstream of ERK, which was responsible for osteogenesis. Of twenty-two mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) kinase kinases (MAP3Ks), we identified A-Raf and C-Raf as upstream MAP3Ks of the mechanical stretch-activated ERK pathway. Subsequently we screened the mechanosensitive cation channel, and identified P2X7 as an upstream molecule of the ERK pathway. Intriguingly, P2X7 functioned as an upstream activator of A-Raf but not of C-Raf. Furthermore, A-Raf contributed to mechanical stretch-induced osteoblast differentiation. In contrast, C-Raf but not A-Raf protected osteoblasts from mechanical stretch-induced apoptosis. These results suggested that A-Raf and C-Raf were involved in mechanobiological osteogenesis in a distinct way: A-Raf was responsible for osteogenesis while C-Raf for anti-apoptotic protection and promotion.
Plant perception of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and other environmental stresses trigger transient ion fluxes at the plasma membrane. Apart from the role of Ca(2+) uptake in signaling, the regulation and significance of PAMP-induced ion fluxes in immunity remain unknown. We characterized the functions of INTEGRIN-LINKED KINASE1 (ILK1) that encodes a Raf-like MAP2K kinase with functions insufficiently understood in plants. Analysis of ILK1 mutants impaired in the expression or kinase activity revealed that ILK1 contributes to plant defense to bacterial pathogens, osmotic stress sensitivity, and cellular responses and total ion accumulation in the plant upon treatment with a bacterial-derived PAMP, flg22. The calmodulin-like protein CML9, a negative modulator of flg22-triggered immunity, interacted with, and suppressed ILK1 kinase activity. ILK1 interacted with and promoted the accumulation of HAK5, a putative (H(+))/K(+) symporter that mediates a high-affinity uptake during K(+) deficiency. ILK1 or HAK5 expression was required for several flg22 responses including gene induction, growth arrest, and plasma membrane depolarization. Furthermore, flg22 treatment induced a rapid K(+) efflux at both the plant and cellular levels in wild type, while mutants with impaired ILK1 or HAK5 expression exhibited a comparatively increased K(+) loss. Taken together, our results position ILK1 as a link between plant defense pathways and K(+) homeostasis.
Since the discovery of B-Raf proto-oncogene (BRAF) V600E mutations in histiocytic neoplasms, diverse kinase alterations have been uncovered in BRAF V600E-wildtype histiocytoses. The purpose of this review is to outline recent molecular advances in histiocytic neoplasms and discuss their impact on the pathogenesis and treatment of these disorders.
Activating kinase alterations discovered in BRAF V600E-wildtype Langerhans (LCH) and non-Langerhans cell histiocytoses (non-LCH) result in constitutive activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase and/or phosphoinositide 3-kinases-Akt murine thymoma pathways. These kinase alterations include activating mutations in A-Raf proto-oncogene, mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 1, neuroblastoma rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog, Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog, and phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3 kinase, catalytic subunit α kinases in LCH and non-LCH; BRAF, anaplastic lymphoma receptor tyrosine kinase, and neurotrophic tyrosine kinase, receptor type 1 fusions, as well as the Ets variant 3-nuclear receptor coactivator 2 fusion in non-LCH; and mutations in the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase 1 and Harvey rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog kinases in LCH and histiocytic sarcoma, respectively. These discoveries have refined the understanding of the histiocytoses as clonal, myeloid neoplasms driven by constitutive mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling and identified molecular therapeutic targets with promising clinical responses to rapidly accelerated fibrosarcoma and mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase inhibition.
Genomic analyses over the last 6 years have identified targetable kinase alterations in BRAF V600E-wildtype histiocytic neoplasms. However, despite this progress, the molecular pathogenesis and therapeutic responsiveness of non-BRAF V600E kinase alterations are still poorly defined in these disorders.
B-Raf represents a critical physiological regulator of the Ras/RAF/MEK/ERK-pathway and a pharmacological target of growing clinical relevance, in particular in oncology. To understand how B-Raf itself is regulated, we combined mass spectrometry with genetic approaches to map its interactome in MCF-10A cells as well as in B-Raf deficient murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) and B-Raf/Raf-1 double deficient DT40 lymphoma cells complemented with wildtype or mutant B-Raf expression vectors. Using a multi-protease digestion approach, we identified a novel ubiquitination site and provide a detailed B-Raf phospho-map. Importantly, we identify two evolutionary conserved phosphorylation clusters around T401 and S419 in the B-Raf hinge region. SILAC labelling and genetic/biochemical follow-up revealed that these clusters are phosphorylated in the contexts of oncogenic Ras, sorafenib induced Raf dimerization and in the background of the V600E mutation. We further show that the vemurafenib sensitive phosphorylation of the T401 cluster occurs in trans within a Raf dimer. Substitution of the Ser/Thr-residues of this cluster by alanine residues enhances the transforming potential of B-Raf, indicating that these phosphorylation sites suppress its signaling output. Moreover, several B-Raf phosphorylation sites, including T401 and S419, are somatically mutated in tumors, further illustrating the importance of phosphorylation for the regulation of this kinase.
Mitochondrial alterations induced by oncogenes are known to be crucial for tumorigenesis. Ras oncogene leads to proliferative signals through a Raf-1/MEK/ERK kinase cascade, whose components have been found to be also associated with mitochondria. The mitochondrial pepdidyl-prolyl isomerase cyclophilin D (CypD) is an important regulator of the mitochondrial permeability transition and a key player in mitochondria physiology; however, its role in cancer is still unclear. Using cellular and in vivo mouse models, we demonstrated that CypD protein upregulation induced by oncogenic Ras through the Raf-1/MEK/ERK pathway has a deterministic role in tumor progression. In fact, targeting CypD gene expression clearly affected RasV12-induced transformation, as showed by in vitro data on murine NIH3T3 and human MCF10A mammary epithelial cells. In addition, studies in xenograft and K-Ras lung cancer mouse models demonstrated that genetic deletion or pharmacological suppression of CypD efficiently prevented Ras-dependent tumor formation. Furthermore, Erbb2-mediated breast tumorigenesis was similarly prevented by targeting CypD. From a mechanistic point of view, CypD expression was associated with a reduced induction of p21(WAF1/CIP1) and p53 functions, unraveling an antagonistic function of CypD on p21-p53-mediated growth suppression. CypD activity is p53 dependent. Interestingly, a physical association between p53 and CypD was detected in mitochondria of MCF10A cells; furthermore, both in vitro and in vivo studies proved that CypD inhibitor-based treatment was able to efficiently impair this interaction, leading to a tumor formation reduction. All together, these findings indicate that the countering effect of CypD on the p53-p21 pathway participates in oncogene-dependent transformation.
A-Raf belongs to the family of oncogenic Raf kinases that are involved in mitogenic signaling by activating the MEK-ERK pathway. Low kinase activity of A-Raf toward MEK suggested that A-Raf might have alternative functions. We recently identified A-Raf as a potent inhibitor of the proapoptotic mammalian sterile 20-like kinase (MST2) tumor suppressor pathway in several cancer entities including head and neck, colon, and breast. Independent of kinase activity, A-Raf binds to MST2 thereby efficiently inhibiting apoptosis. Here, we show that the interaction of A-Raf with the MST2 pathway is regulated by subcellular compartmentalization. Although in proliferating normal cells and tumor cells A-Raf localizes to the mitochondria, differentiated non-carcinogenic cells of head and neck epithelia, which express A-Raf at the plasma membrane. The constitutive or induced re-localization of A-Raf to the plasma membrane compromises its ability to efficiently sequester and inactivate MST2, thus rendering cells susceptible to apoptosis. Physiologically, A-Raf re-localizes to the plasma membrane upon epithelial differentiation in vivo. This re-distribution is regulated by the scaffold protein kinase suppressor of Ras 2 (KSR2). Downregulation of KSR2 during mammary epithelial cell differentiation or siRNA-mediated knockdown re-localizes A-Raf to the plasma membrane causing the release of MST2. By using the MCF7 cell differentiation system, we could demonstrate that overexpression of A-Raf in MCF7 cells, which induces differentiation. Our findings offer a new paradigm to understand how differential localization of Raf complexes affects diverse signaling functions in normal cells and carcinomas.
We have identified previously undiscovered BRAF in-frame deletions near the αC-helix region of the kinase domain in pancreatic, lung, ovarian, and thyroid cancers. These deletions are mutually exclusive with KRAS mutations and occur in 4.21% of KRAS wild-type pancreatic cancer. siRNA knockdown in cells harboring BRAF deletions showed that the MAPK activity and cell growth are BRAF dependent. Structurally, the BRAF deletions are predicted to shorten the β3/αC-helix loop and hinder its flexibility by locking the helix in the active αC-helix-in conformation that favors dimer formation. Expression of L485-P490-deleted BRAF is able to transform NIH/3T3 cells in a BRAF dimer-dependent manner. BRAF homodimer is confirmed to be the dominant RAF dimer by proximity ligation assays in BRAF deletion cells, which are resistant to the BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib and sensitive to LY3009120, a RAF dimer inhibitor. In tumor models with BRAF deletions, LY3009120 has shown tumor growth regression, whereas vemurafenib is inactive.
This study discovered oncogenic BRAF deletions with a distinct activation mechanism dependent on the BRAF dimer formation in tumor cells. LY3009120 is active against these cells and represents a potential treatment option for patients with cancer with these BRAF deletions, or other atypical BRAF mutations where BRAF functions as a dimer.
Extensin, the structural motif of plant extracellular matrix proteins, possesses a unique highly glycosylated, hydrophilic, and repeating Ser1Hyp4 pentapeptide unit, and has been proposed to include post-translational hydroxylation at proline residue and subsequent oligo-L-arabinosylations at all of the resultant hydroxyprolines as well as galactosylation at serine residue. Reported herein is the stereoselective synthesis of one of the highly glycosylated motifs, Ser(Galp1)-Hyp(Araf4)-Hyp(Araf4)-Hyp(Araf3)-Hyp(Araf1). The synthesis has been completed by the application of 2-(naphthyl)methylether-mediated intramolecular aglycon delivery to the stereoselective construction of the Ser(Galp1) and Hyp(Araf(n)) fragments as the key step, as well as Fmoc solid-phase peptide synthesis for the backbone pentapeptide.
The unique hydroxylproline (Hyp)-linked O-glycan modification is a common process in hydroxyproline-rich glycoproteins (HRGPs). The modification occurs through post-translational hydroxylation at 4-position of proline residues some of which are followed by O-glycosylation at the resulting Hyp which is also found in some secreted peptide hormones such as CLAVATA3 (CLV3) of Arabidopsis thaliana plants. An active mature CLV3 is a tridecapeptide linked to β-L-Araf-(1→2)-β-L-Araf-(1→2)-β-L-Araf at a Hyp residue in the center of the peptide sequence such as Arg-Thr-Val-Hyp-Ser-Gly-Hyp(L-Arafn)-Asp-Pro-Leu-His-His-His (n = 3). We report here the synthesis of the secreted and modified CLV3 glycopeptide with all glycoforms (Araf0-3CLV3) of A. thaliana plants. A highly stereoselective β-arabinofuranosylation of Hyp derivatives as the key step of the synthesis of CLV3 glycopeptide was achieved by NAP ether-mediated IAD, which was effectively applied to the synthesis of oligoarabinosylated hydroxylproline [Hyp(L-Araf1-3)] derivatives. Fmoc-solid phase peptide synthesis was carried out using COMU as the coupling reagent for the introduction of [Hyp(L-Araf0-3)] derivatives as well as further elongation to the CLV3 glycopeptides.
Although cell wall remodeling is an essential feature of plant growth and development, the underlying molecular mechanisms are poorly understood. This work describes the characterization of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) plants with altered expression of ARAF1, a bifunctional alpha-L-arabinofuranosidase/beta-D-xylosidase (At3g10740) belonging to family 51 glycosyl-hydrolases. ARAF1 was localized in several cell types in the vascular system of roots and stems, including xylem vessels and parenchyma cells surrounding the vessels, the cambium, and the phloem. araf1 T-DNA insertional mutants showed no visible phenotype, whereas transgenic plants that overexpressed ARAF1 exhibited a delay in inflorescence emergence and altered stem architecture. Although global monosaccharide analysis indicated only slight differences in cell wall composition in both mutant and overexpressing lines, immunolocalization experiments using anti-arabinan (LM6) and anti-xylan (LM10) antibodies indicated cell type-specific alterations in cell wall structure. In araf1 mutants, an increase in LM6 signal intensity was observed in the phloem, cambium, and xylem parenchyma in stems and roots, largely coinciding with ARAF1 expression sites. The ectopic overexpression of ARAF1 resulted in an increase in LM10 labeling in the secondary walls of interfascicular fibers and xylem vessels. The combined ARAF1 gene expression and immunolocalization studies suggest that arabinan-containing pectins are potential in vivo substrates of ARAF1 in Arabidopsis.
Pancreatic ductal carcinoma (PDC) remains one of the most intractable malignancies in humans. In order to clarify the molecular events underlying the carcinogenesis in PDC, we constructed a retroviral cDNA expression library from a PDC cell line, and used it to screen transforming genes in PDC by a focus formation assay with mouse 3T3 fibroblasts. We could obtain a total of 30 transformed cell foci in the screening, and one of the cDNA inserts harvested from such cell clones turned out to encode a wild-type human ARAF1. Unexpectedly, a long terminal repeat-driven overexpression of ARAF1 mRNA was confirmed to induce transformed foci in fibroblasts. The oncogenic potential of ARAF1 was examined by injecting the transformed fibroblasts into athymic nude mice. Importantly, ARAF1 mRNA was highly expressed in pancreatic ductal cell specimens purified from patients with PDC. These results have unveiled the transforming potential of ARAF1 protein, and also suggest that quantity of intracellular ARAF1 may be important in carcinogenesis of various human cancers.
The raf proto-oncogenes encode cytoplasmic protein serine/threonine kinases, which play a critical role in cell growth and development. One of these, A-raf-1 (human gene symbol, ARAF1), which is predominantly expressed in mouse urogenital tissues, has been mapped to an evolutionarily conserved linkage group composed of ARAF1, SYN1, TIMP, and properdin located at human chromosome Xp11.2. We have isolated human genomic DNA clones containing the expressed gene (ARAF1) on the X chromosome and a pseudogene (ARAF2) on chromosome 7p12-q11.21. Analysis of the nucleotide sequence from the ARAF1 genomic clones demonstrated that it consists of 16 exons encoded by minimally 10,776 nucleotides. The major transcriptional start site (+1) was determined by RNase protection and primer extension assays. Promoter activity was confirmed by functional assays using DNA fragments fused to a CAT reporter gene. The ARAF1 minimal promoter, located between nucleotides -59 and +93, has a low G + C content and lacks consensus TATA and Inr sequences but shows sequence similarity at position -1 to the E box that is known to interact with USF and TFII-I transcription factors.
Animal cloning through somatic cell nuclear transfer (NT) is very inefficient, probably due to insufficient reprogramming of the donor nuclei, which in turn would cause the dysregulation of gene expression. X-Chromosome inactivation (XCI) is a multi-step epigenetic process utilized by mammals to achieve dosage compensation in females. Our aim was to determine if any dysregulation of X-linked genes, which would be indicative of unfaithful reprogramming of donor nuclei, was present in cloned pigs. Real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was performed to quantify the transcript levels of five X-linked genes, X inactivation-specific transcript (XIST), TSIX (the reverse spelling of XIST), hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyltransferase 1 (HPRT1), glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD), V-raf murine sarcoma 3,611 viral oncogene homolog 1 (ARAF1), and one autosomal gene, alpha-1 type IV collagen (COL4A1) in major organs of neonatal deceased and surviving female cloned pigs as well as their age-matched control pigs from conventional breeding. Aberrant expression level of these genes was prevalent in the neonatal deceased clones, while it was only moderate in cloned pigs that survived after birth. These results suggest a correlation between the viability of the clones and the normality of their gene expression and provide a possible explanation for the death of a large portion of cloned animals around birth.
Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common sustained cardiac arrhythmia, and patients with AF have a significantly increased risk for ischemic stroke. Approximately 15% of all strokes are caused by AF. The molecular basis and underlying mechanisms and pathophysiology of AF remain largely unknown.
We have identified a large AF family with an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern. The AF in the family manifests with early onset at the fetal stage and is associated with neonatal sudden death and, in some cases, ventricular tachyarrhythmias and waxing and waning cardiomyopathy. Genome-wide linkage analysis was performed for 36 family members and generated a 2-point logarithm of the odds (LOD) score of 3.05 for marker D5S455. The maximum multipoint LOD score of 4.10 was obtained for 4 markers: D5S426, D5S493, D5S455, and D5S1998. Heterozygous carriers have significant prolongation of P-wave duration on ECGs compared with noncarriers (107 versus 85 ms on average; P=0.000012), but no differences between these 2 groups were detected for the PR interval, QRS complex, ST-segment duration, T-wave duration, QTc, and R-R interval (P&gt;0.05).
Our findings demonstrate that AF can be inherited as an autosomal recessive trait and define a novel genetic locus for AF on chromosome 5p13 (arAF1). A genetic link between AF and prolonged P-wave duration was identified. This study provides a framework for the ultimate cloning of the arAF1 gene, which will increase the understanding of the fundamental molecular mechanisms of atrial fibrillation.
Five-coordinate phenylsilicates are formed from the reaction of trimethoxy(phenyl)silane with monosaccharides in methanol in the presence of a stoichiometric amount of base. Five complexes have been isolated and characterized with two ketoses and three aldopentoses. The silicon central atom in [K([18]crown-6)][PhSi(beta-D-Fruf 2,3H-2)2].MeOH (1, Fru=fructose) is part of two chelate rings, with the ligands being beta-D-fructofuranose-O2,O3 dianions. The beta-furanose isomer is best suited for silicon ligation because it exhibits a torsion angle close to 0 degrees for the most acidic diol function, thus assuring a flat chelate ring. The same structural principles are also found in [K([18]crown-6)][PhSi(beta-D-Araf1,2H-2)2].2 MeOH (2, Ara=arabinose), [K([18]crown-6)][PhSi(alpha-D-Ribf1,2H-2)2] (3, Rib=ribose), [K([18]crown-6)][PhSi(alpha-D-Xylf1,2H-2)2]. acetone (4, Xyl=xylose), and [K([18]crown-6)][PhSi(alpha-D-Rulf2,3H-2)2] (5, Rul=ribulose).
We developed a method of clone proliferation promoting fusion genes whose proteins were activated by protein oligomerization through the helix-loop-helix region (PNT domain) of TEL. We inserted a cDNA library downstream of the PNT domain with a retrovirus vector. The resulting retrovirus infected cytokine-dependent 32D cells and cells with cytokine-independent growth were analyzed for the inserted cDNA. We cloned 25 independent fusion genes including seven kinds of partner genes. Six of the seven were a fusion of TEL with protein tyrosine kinase, LYN, HCK, FGR, SYK, FLT3, and TYK2. A serine/threonine kinase, ARAF1, was also found to fuse with TEL. These kinase fusion proteins included kinase domains with proper reading frames. These fusions may be a useful model for clarifying the downstream signal transduction of constitutive active kinase and this expression cloning method may provide a new tool with which to study cell proliferation signalling.
LKB1, a tumor-suppressor gene that codifies for a serine/threonine kinase, is mutated in the germ-line of patients affected with the Peutz-Jeghers syndrome (PJS), which have an increased incidence of several cancers including gastrointestinal, pancreatic and lung carcinomas. Regarding tumors arising in non-PJS patients, we recently observed that at least one-third of lung adenocarcinomas (LADs) harbor somatic LKB1 gene mutations, supporting a role for LKB1 in the origin of some sporadic tumors. To characterize the pattern of LKB1 mutations in LADs further, we first screened for LKB1 gene alterations (gene mutations, promoter hypermethylation and homozygous deletions) in 19 LADs and, in agreement with our previous data, five of them (26%) were shown to harbor mutations, all of which gave rise to a truncated protein. Recent reports demonstrate that LKB1 is able to suppress cell growth, but little is known about the specific mechanism by which it functions. To further our understanding of LKB1 function, we analysed global expression in lung primary tumors using cDNA microarrays to identify LKB1-specific variations in gene expression. In all, 34 transcripts, 24 of which corresponded to known genes, differed significantly between tumors with and without LKB1 gene alterations. Among the most remarkable findings was deregulation of transcripts involved in signal transduction (e.g. FRAP1/mTOR, ARAF1 and ROCK2), cytoskeleton (e.g. MPP1), transcription factors (e.g. MEIS2, ATF5), metabolism of AMP (AMPD3 and APRT) and ubiquitinization (e.g. USP16 and UBE2L3). Real-time quantitative RT-PCR on 15 tumors confirmed the upregulation of the homeobox MEIS2 and of the AMP-metabolism AMPD3 transcripts in LKB1-mutant tumors. In addition, immunohistochemistry in 10 of the lung tumors showed the absence of phosphorylated FRAP1/mTOR protein in LKB1-mutant tumors, indicating that LKB1 mutations do not lead to FRAP1/mTOR protein kinase activation. In conclusion, our results reveal that several important factors contribute to LKB1-mediated carcinogenesis in LADs, confirming previous observations and identifying new putative pathways that should help to elucidate the biological role of LKB1.
An overabundance of X chromosomes in testicular germ cell tumors and the identification of the candidate testicular germ cell tumor susceptibility gene TGCT1 on Xq27 highlight the potential involvement of X chromosomes in testicular germ cell tumor pathogenesis. The current study was designed to shed light on the question whether the multiple X chromosomes in testicular germ cell tumor are active or inactive through a complex mechanism of X chromosomal gain and XIST expression.
We analyzed 4 testicular germ cell tumor derived cell lines and 20 primary testicular germ cell tumor tissues. The number of X chromosomes was determined by fluorescence in situ hybridization using the X chromosome specific probe. The expression patterns of XIST and the 3 X-linked genes androgen receptor (AR), fragile X mental retardation (FMR1 ) and Glypican 3 (GPC3 ) were studied by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. Bisulfite genomic sequencing was used to analyze the methylation patterns of the AR, FMR1 and GPC3 genes. The relative expression levels of the 2 X-linked proto-oncogenes ARAF1 and ELK1 were assayed by quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction.
XIST expression was common in seminomatous testicular germ cell tumors (2 of 2 or 100% of seminoma derived cell lines and 10 of 12 or 83% of seminomatous testicular germ cell tumor tissues) but not in nonseminomatous testicular germ cell tumors (0 of 2 or 0% nonseminoma derived cell lines and 2 of 8 or 25% of nonseminomatous testicular germ cell tumor tissues). However, X chromosomal gain was consistently observed in the 2 types of tumors. XIST expression in testicular germ cell tumors and normal testicular parenchyma was not associated with methylation of the AR, FMR1 or GPC3 genes. After determining the expression patterns of AR, FMR1 and GPC3 in testicular germ cell tumor samples we concluded that multiple X chromosomes in testicular germ cell tumors were predominantly hypomethylated and active regardless of XIST expression. The biological significance of excess active X chromosomes in testicular germ cell tumors was suggested by enhanced expression of the 2 X-linked oncogenes ARAF1 and ELK1 in the testicular germ cell tumor derived cell lines.
The current data may suggest the potential oncogenic implications of X chromosomal gain in testicular germ cell tumors.
Human chromosome Xp11.3-Xp11.23 encompasses the map location for a growing number of diseases with a genetic basis or genetic component. These include several eye disorders, syndromic and nonsyndromic forms of X-linked mental retardation (XLMR), X-linked neuromuscular diseases and susceptibility loci for schizophrenia, type 1 diabetes, and Graves' disease. We have constructed an approximately 2.7-Mb high-resolution physical map extending from DXS8026 to ELK1, corresponding to a genetic distance of approximately 5.5 cM. A combination of chromosome walking and sequence-tagged site (STS)-content mapping resulted in an integrated framework and transcript map, precisely positioning 10 polymorphic microsatellites (one of which is novel), 16 ESTs, and 12 known genes (RP2, PCTK1, UHX1, UBE1, RBM10, ZNF157, SYN1, ARAF1, TIMP1, PFC, ELK1, UXT). The composite map is currently anchored with 89 STSs to give an average resolution of approximately 1 STS every 30 kb. By a combination of EST database searches and in silico detection of UniGene clusters within genomic sequence generated from this template map, we have mapped several novel genes within this interval: a Na+/H+ exchanger (SLC9A7), at least two zincfinger transcription factors (KIAA0215 and Hs.68318), carbohydrate sulfotransferase-7 (CHST7), regucalcin (RGN), inactivation-escape-1 (INE1), the human ortholog of mouse neuronal protein 15.6, and four putative novel genes. Further genomic analysis enabled annotation of the sequence interval with 20 predicted pseudogenes and 21 UniGene clusters of unknown function. The combined PAC/BAC transcript map and YAC scaffold presented here clarifies previously conflicting data for markers and genes within the Xp11.3-Xp11.23 interval and provides a powerful integrated resource for functional characterization of this clonally unstable, yet gene-rich and clinically significant region of proximal Xp.
X inactivation silences most but not all of the genes on one of the two X chromosomes in mammalian females. The human X chromosome preserves its activation status when isolated in rodent/human somatic-cell hybrids, and hybrids retaining either the active or inactive X chromosome have been used to assess the inactivation status of many X-linked genes. Surprisingly, the X-linked gene for human tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases (TIMP1) is expressed in some but not all inactive X-containing somatic-cell hybrids, suggesting that this gene is either prone to reactivation or variable in its inactivation. Since many genes that escape X inactivation are clustered, we examined the expression of four genes (ARAF1, ELK1, ZNF41, and ZNF157) within approximately 100 kb of TIMP1. All four genes were expressed only from the active X chromosome, demonstrating that the factors allowing TIMP1 expression from the inactive X chromosome are specific to the TIMP1 gene. To determine if this variable inactivation of TIMP1 is a function of the hybrid-cell environment or also is observed in human cells, we developed an allele-specific assay to assess TIMP1 expression in human females. Expression of two alleles was detected in some female cells with previously demonstrated extreme skewing of X inactivation, indicating TIMP1 expression from the inactive chromosome. However, in other cells, no expression of TIMP1 was observed from the inactive X chromosome, suggesting that TIMP1 inactivation is polymorphic in human females.
A sex chromosome locus for psychosis has been considered on the basis of some sex differences in genetic risk and expression of illness, and an association with X-chromosome anomalies. Previous molecular genetic studies produced weak evidence for linkage of schizophrenia to the proximal short arm of the X-chromosome, while some other regions were not ruled out. Here we report an attempt to expand the Xp findings in: (i) a multicenter collaboration focusing on 92 families with a maternal pattern of inheritance (Study I), and (ii) an independent sample of 34 families unselected for parental mode of transmission (Study II). In the multicenter study, a parametric analysis resulted in positive lod scores (highest of 1.97 for dominant and 1.19 for recessive inheritance at a theta of 0.20) for locus DXS7, with scores below 0.50 for other markers in this region (MAOB, DXS228, and ARAF1). Significant allele sharing among affected sibling pairs was present at DXS7. In the second study, positive lod scores were observed at MAOB (highest of 2.16 at a theta of 0.05 for dominant and 1.64 at a theta of 0.00 for recessive models) and ALAS2 (the highest of 1.36 at a theta of 0.05 for a recessive model), with significant allele sharing (P = 0.003 and 0.01, respectively) at these two loci. These five markers are mapped within a small region of Xp11. Thus, although substantial regions of the X-chromosome have been investigated without evidence for linkage being found, a locus predisposing to schizophrenia in the proximal short arm of the X-chromosome is not excluded.
Previous comparisons of gene location in the three major groups of mammals (eutherians, marsupials, and monotremes) have suggested that the long arm of the human X represents the ancestral mammalian X chromosome, whereas the short arm represents an autosomal region(s) recently added to the eutherian X chromosome. To identify the fusion point of this ancient X-autosome rearrangement, we have mapped four genes, three of which map near the centromere of the human Xp, in marsupials and in a monotreme. We found that ARAF1, ALAS2, and GATA1 are located on the X chromosome in marsupials, and ALAS2 and GATA1 are also located on the X in the platypus. This implies that the proximal short arm of the human X chromosome, including the centromere, was part of the ancestral mammalian X chromosome. The fusion point between the conserved region and the recently added regions therefore maps to human Xp11.23, although gene order on the human X indicates that there has been some rearrangement of this region.
The Xp11.2 region o the human X chromosome contains genes involved in a number of inherited diseased, with at least one locus that escapes X chromosome inactivation, as well as abnormal methylation polymorphism. We isolated a series of yeast artificial chromosome (YAC) clones by hybridization screening with DNA probes localized within this region and assembled them into a 4.3 Mb contig spanning from Xp11.21 to Xp11.23 by a combination of Alu-PCR fingerprinting, STS-PCR and DNA probe cross hybridization. On the basis of these overlapping YAC clones we have constructed the long-range restriction map of this interval and placed exactly some DNA markers. Four CpG-dense regions between ARAF1 and OATL2 were identified based on the long-range restriction mapping, which indicated the distribution of genes within this interval. It should assist in the future nucleic acid sequence analysis and novel gene identification in this region.
Several new genes and markers have recently been identified on the proximal short arm of the human X chromosome in the area of Xp11.23. We had previously generated a YAC contig in this region extending from UBE1 to the OATL1 locus. In this report two polymorphic dinucleotide repeats, DXS6949 and DXS6950, were isolated and characterized from the OATL1 locus. A panel of YAC deletion derivatives from the distal portion of the contig was used in conjunction with the rest of the YAC map to position the new microsatellites and order other markers localizing to this interval. The marker order was determined to be DXS1367-ZNF81-DXS6849-ZNF21-DXS6616-DXS 6950-DXS6949. In the proximal region below OATL1, we have isolated a pair of YACs from the GATA locus, B1026 and C01160. Mapping within these YACs indicates the orientation of DXS1126 and DXS1240, while a cosmid near the OATL1 region reveals the overlap between the YAC contigs from the two loci. This cosmid contains the gene responsible for Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (WAS) and localizes the disease gene between OATL1 and GATA. These data enable the expansion of the present physical map of the X chromosome from UBE1 to the GATA locus, covering a large portion of the Xp11.23 region. Genetic cross-overs in Xp11.23 support the marker orientation and the position of WAS, contrary to previous reports. With the integration of both physical and genetic maps we have predicted the following marker order: Xpter-UBE1-SYN1/ARAF1/ TIMP1-DXS1367-ZNF81-DXS.6849-ZNF21-DXSy6616++ +-(OATL1, DXS6950-DXS6949)- WAS-(GATA, DXS1126)-DXS1240-Xcen.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
X-linked progressive cone dystrophy (COD1) causes progressive deterioration of visual acuity, deepening of central scotomas, macular changes, and bull's-eye lesions. The cone electroretinography (ERG) is variably abnormal in affected males, and the rod ERG may also be abnormal. The clinical picture of heterozygous females ranges from asymptomatic to a widespread spectrum of cone-mediated dysfunction. A prior linkage study demonstrated linkage between the COD1 locus and the marker locus DXS84, assigned to Xp21.1, with no recombination. In the present study, we have clinically characterized a large four-generation family with COD1 and have performed a linkage analysis using seven polymorphic markers on the short arm of the X chromosome. No recombination was observed between the disease and the marker loci DXS7 and MAOA, suggesting that the location of COD1 is in the region Xp11.3, distal to DXS84 and proximal to ARAF1.
The genes ARAF1, SYN1, TIMP, and PFC are clustered within 70 kb of one another, and, as reported in the accompanying paper (J. Knight et al., 1994, Genomics 21: 180-187), at least four more genes map within 400 kb: a cluster of Krüppel-type zinc finger genes (including ZNF21, ZNF41, and ZNF81) and ELK-1, a member of the ets oncogene superfamily. This gene-rich region is of particular interest because of the large number of disease genes mapping to Xp11.23: at least three eye diseases (retinitis pigmentosa type 2, congenital stationary night blindness CSNB1, and Aland Island eye disease), Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, X-linked nephrolithiasis, and a translocation breakpoint associated with synovial sarcoma. We have constructed a 1.8-Mb YAC contig in this region, confirming the link between TIMP and OATL1 reported by Knight et al. (1994) and extending the map in the distal direction. To investigate the likelihood that more genes are located within this region, we have carried out detailed mapping of rare-cutter restriction sites in these YACs and identified seven CpG islands. At least six of these islands are located over 50 kb from any known gene locations, suggesting that the region contains at least this many as yet unidentified genes. We have also mapped the physical locations of six highly polymorphic CA repeats within the contig, thus integrating the physical, genetic, and transcriptional maps of the region and facilitating the mapping and identification of disease genes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
By using yeast artificial chromosome (YAC) clones, we have generated a physical map of the short arm of the human X chromosome at Xp11.23. The region analyzed spans the distal marker UBE1 and the ARAF1/TIMP/SYN1/PFC gene cluster and further extends proximally to include ELK1, ZNF21, ZNF81, and OATL1 in a single contig. We have uniquely placed UBE1 and the SYN1 gene cluster in a 330-kb YAC within the contig. In addition, the genes SYP and TFE3 are physically linked in a YAC of 400 kb from the more centromeric portion of Xp11.23. We have refined the map by using fragmentation vectors to generate YAC deletion derivatives. These derivatives show that ZNF81 and ZNF21 lie within an approximately 130-kb segment and that SYN1.2 and ELK1 are less than 50 kb apart. Together these data reveal the following order for the markers in this region: Xpter-UBE1-ARAF1-TIMP-SYN1.2-PFC-ELK1++ +-ZNF81-ZNF21-OATL1-(SYP,TFE3)-Xcen.
It is a widely held view that a progressive reduction of beta-cell mass occurs in the progression of diabetes. RAF-1 kinase and pancreas duodenal homeobox 1 (PDX-1) are major factors that promote survival of cells and maintain normal insulin functions. In this study we investigated the effect of a β-adrenergic receptor agonist and antagonist on RAF-1 and PDX-1, and their respective effects on apoptosis and insulin release in RIN-m5F cells.
RIN-m5F cells were cultured in normal (5 mM) and high (25 mM) glucose to mimic diabetic conditions, followed by treatment with 5 µM, 10 µM and 20 µM of isoproterenol and isoproterenol + propranolol for 6, 12 and 24 h. Western blotting and reverse transcription analysis were performed to examine the expression of RAF-1 and PDX-1. Annexin-V-FITC and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) assays were used to investigate apoptosis. ELISA was used to measure insulin levels. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction was conducted to investigate the expression of genes.
Stimulation of β-adrenergic receptors with isoproterenol significantly induced RAF-1 and PDX-1 genes in a concentration-dependent and time-independent manner. Changes were significant both at protein and mRNA levels. Up-regulation of RAF-1 and PDX-1 was accompanied by improved insulin levels and reduced apoptosis. Concentrations of 10 µM and 20 µM for 12 and 24 h were more effective in achieving significant differences in the experimental and control groups. Propranolol reversed the effect of isoproterenol mostly at maximum concentrations and time periods.
A positive effect of a β-adrenergic agonist on RAF-1 and PDX-1, reduction in β-cell apoptosis and improved insulin contents can help to understand the pathogenesis of diabetes and to develop novel approaches for the β-cell dysfunction in diabetes.
Immune checkpoint blockade therapy (ICBT) for the treatment of melanoma has led to an important improvement of overall survival in advanced stage patients. However, secondary cutaneous maculopapular eruptions (CMPEs) are frequent and remain poorly characterized.
We performed a retrospective analysis of melanoma patients from our institution who developed CMPEs during ICBT. Clinical information was retrieved, and histopathological and immunohistochemical characterization was performed by two pathologists. For comparison, a group of biopsies from CMPE caused by anti-v-raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B1 (BRAF) therapy was analyzed.
Eleven patients met the inclusion criteria. On clinical grounds, CMPE developed mainly on early onset of immunotherapy and were of low grade. Typical lesions included erythematous papules and macules affecting the trunk and/or extremities with associated pruritus. The histopathological patterns consisted of a superficial perivascular lymphocytic dermatitis (SPLD) with eosinophils followed by a granulomatous dermatitis. Other patterns included lichenoid, spongiotic, and a case of Grover's disease. The inflammatory infiltrate consisted of T lymphocytes (CD3(+) ) with a predominance of CD4(+) over CD8(+) cells; isolated Foxp3(+) cells were invariably present, and PD-1 was not expressed. Biopsies from CMPE caused by anti-BRAF therapy showed an SPLD and a similar lymphocytic immunophenotype.
Our study showed the clinical features of a group of melanoma patients with CMPE for ICBT and emphasized the wide spectrum of histological findings as well as their immunohistochemical profile. Differential diagnosis can be difficult with CMPE provoked by other therapies as was seen in our comparison group of anti-BRAF-induced eruptions.
Our aim was to perform a comparison study of the mutation rate of V-Ki-ras2 Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (KRAS), and v-Raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog-B (BRAF) genes between blood-based cell-free DNA (cfDNA), and tissue sample biopsies in individuals undergoing screening colonoscopy.
All specimens were collected from January 2015 to January 2016. A total of 92 blood samples and colonic biopsy specimens were collected from healthy individuals with no polyps undergoing screening colonoscopy (group A, n=35), patients with colorectal cancer (group B, n=27), and patients with neoplastic intestinal polyps (group C, n=30). Peripheral blood was collected from each patient and a focal tissue biopsy was conducted.
We only found a limited statistically significant difference (p=0.046) in the mutation analysis for codon 12 of the KRAS gene when we compared tissue biopsies from patients in group B to those from group C. In the blood samples, only the rate of mutation in codon 12 of the KRAS gene in samples of group B was significantly higher than that in group A (p=0.013).
Blood cfDNA may be a promising tool in CRC screening as it may discriminate patients with CRC compared to healthy individuals and those with colonic polyps, even though it does not appear useful in predicting the presence of colonic polyps.
Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) typically presents at an advanced stage and is associated with a poor oncological outcome. The median survival for metastatic ICC is less than 1 year with standard chemotherapy. ICC is associated with distinct oncogenic drivers including IDH (isocitrate dehydrogenase), HER-2 (human epidermal growth factor 2), and BRAF (v-Raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B), which may benefit from matching targeted therapies. Hereby we report 2 cases of BRAF V600E refractory ICC treated with dual BRAF and MEK inhibitors (dabrafenib and trametinib) with excellent clinical and radiological response to therapy and with protracted duration of disease control. Our first patient achieved CR (complete remission) at 6 months of treatment with ultimate disease progression at 9 months. The second patient achieved a PR (partial response) at 2 months from starting treatment and remains progression free at 5 months. Our results confirm the activity of dual BRAF and MEK targeting in BRAF mutated ICC, adding further support to 3 additional case-reports in the literature. Dual targeting appears superior to other case reports with BRAF inhibition alone and appear favorable to historic data with cytotoxic chemotherapy. Given the poor outlook and refractoriness of BRAF mutant ICC, future studies should focus on early integration of BRAF/MEK inhibition.
A recent clinical trial on the immune check-point inhibitor pembrolizumab demonstrated that microsatellite instability (MSI) is a good biomarker for response to this inhibitor. However, clinicopathological features of advanced colorectal cancer (CRC) with high-frequency MSI (MSI-H) are unclear.
A total of 2,439 surgically resected CRC tissues were analyzed for MSI status, and mutational status of V-Ki-Ras2 Kirsten rat sarcoma 2 viral oncogene homolog (KRAS), neuroblastoma RAS viral oncogene homolog (NRAS) and v-Raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B (BRAF). Stage IV cases were selected, and clinical and molecular features were evaluated.
There was no significant survival difference observed between MSI-H CRC and microsatellite-stable (MSS) CRC in patients with stage IV disease (3.92 vs. 2.50 years; p=0.766). However, hematogenous and lymphogenous metastasis-dominant CRC with MSI-H demonstrated poor prognosis, whereas peritoneal metastasis-dominant CRC with MSI-H demonstrated good prognosis, (1.33 vs. 5.2 years; p=0.006).
Prognosis of stage IV CRC with MSI-H depended on the metastatic pattern. These findings provide useful information for the adaptation of CRC immunotherapy.
To detect serum v-raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homologue B1 (BRAF) protein levels and to investigate their clinical significance in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients.
Serum samples were obtained from 78 RA patients, 32 osteoarthritis (OA) patients, 16 systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients, 16 gout patients, 16 ankylosing spondylitis (AS) patients, 16 Sjogren syndrome (SS) patients and 30 healthy controls. BRAF protein in the sera was examined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The associations between BRAF levels and the clinical features including age, sex, disease duration, swelling joints, tenderness joints, duration of moning stiffness, joint deformity, visual assessment scale (VAS) and extra articular manifestations and laboratory parameters including erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), rheumatoid factor (RF), disease activity score in 28 joints (DAS28), anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (CCP) antibody, antikeratin antibody, antnuclear antibody (ANA), immunoglobulin and cytokines, such as TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6 and IL-17A in RA patients were evaluated. Data analyses were performed by using SPSS 19.0 program.
The serum BRAF protein levels in the RA patients were significantly higher than those of other rheumatic diseases groups including OA, SLE, AS, SS, gout patients and healthy controls, the P value was 0.002, &lt;0.001, &lt;0.001, &lt;0.001, 0.001 and &lt;0.001 respectively. The level of serum BRAF protein in the RA patients showed a positive correlation with the rheumatoid factor (P=0.009) and IgA levels (P=0.006), but no correlation with clinical features, such as age and duration or other laboratory parameters, including CRP, ESR, anti-CCP antibody, IgM, IgG, TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6 and IL-17A. The RA patients were further divided into normal levels of BRAF protein group and elevated levels of BRAF protein group. Compared with the clinical features and laboratory indexes of normal and elevated levels of BRAF protein groups in the RA patients, there was no significant difference between the two groups in age, duration, DAS28, CRP, ESR, RF, anti-CCP, IgA, IgG, IgM, TNF-α or IL-6.
The elevated level of BRAF protein in the RA patients showed that BRAF might play a role in the pathogenesis of RA. Further researches on BRAF gene expression may help to clarify the role of BRAF in RA.
Desmoplastic infantile astrocytoma (DIA) and desmoplastic infantile gangliogliomas (DIGs) are rare, massive, cystic and solid tumors of infants usually found in superficial cerebral hemispheres. They manifest prominent desmoplastic stroma, admixed neoplastic astrocytes, primitive-appearing small cells, and additional neoplastic ganglion cells in the case of DIGs. While v-Raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B (BRAF) mutation is found in up to 50% of pediatric gangliogliomas, two recent studies found that it was rare in DIA/DIGs; we sought to assess BRAF status in DIA/DIGs from our institution.
Departmental files from 2000 to 2016 were reviewed to identify cases. Clinical, neuroimaging, histological, and immunohistochemistry (IHC) features were assessed; the latter included IHC for astrocytic and neuronal markers and BRAF VE1. BRAF mutational assessment by Sanger and next-generation sequencing was attempted in all cases.
All six identified cases (four males-two females; three DIA-three DIG) occurred in children &lt;1-year old, were large, cerebral-hemispheric, cystic and solid, and enhancing tumors. Only one case, a DIG with prominent aggregates of neoplastic ganglion cells, showed either BRAF VE1 IHC positivity or mutation by Sanger and next-generation sequencing (rare c. 1799_1800delinsAT; p. V600D). Four of six archival cases were BRAF VE1 IHC negative, but failed mutational sequencing.
Five of six classic DIA/DIGs were negative for BRAF mutation; previous series have identified BRAF mutation in two of 18 and one of 14 cases, although all were the more common BRAF V600E. We were unable to find other examples of glial tumors in public databases with this rare BRAF V600D mutation. Identification of BRAF mutational opens the possibility of BRAF-targeted therapies for the subset of DIA/DIG that clinically progress postresection.
To investigate the expression of the v-raf-1 murine leukemia viral oncogene homolog 1 (Raf-1) and its role in the innate immune response of human corneal epithelial cells (HCECs) infected by Aspergillus fumigatus.
HCECs were cultured in vitro. They were randomly divided into 4 groups, including control group, Aspergillus fumigatus group, GW5074 (an inhibitor of Raf-1) group and Laminarin [an inhibitor of Dendriti-cell-associated C-type lectin 1 (Dectin-1)] group. The protein expression level of total Raf-1 and p-Raf-1was measured by Western blot. The expression of IL-6 and IL-8 mRNA in each group was detected by real-time polymerase chain reaction.
In Aspergillus fumigatus group, total Raf-1 protein levels in HCECs remained unchanged at 5, 15, 30 and 45min after infection, while p-Raf-1 expression was significantly enhanced at 30min after infection compared with control group. However, the expression of p-Raf-1 was apparently declined after treated with GW5074 or Laminarin compared with Aspergillus fumigatus group. The expression levels of IL-6, IL-8 mRNA were significantly increased after stimulation with fumigatus compared with control group. Pre-treated with GW5074 significantly inhibited Aspergillus fumigatus-induced upregulation of IL-8 and IL-6.
Aspergillus fumigatus stimulation can elevate the expression of p-Raf-1 in HCECs in vitro. Dectin-1/Raf-1 signal pathway may play a role on regulating the expression of inflammatory cytokines, including IL-6 and IL-8.
The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway is a cascade of protein kinases that act in a sequential and predominantly linear fashion, albeit displaying some cross talk with other signaling cascades. Mutations in proteins integral to the MAPK signaling pathway are present in more than 50% of cutaneous melanomas. The most frequently mutated protein is v-raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B (BRAF), followed by neuroblastoma Ras viral oncogene homolog (NRAS). Recently, the development of targeted drugs for the treatment of BRAF-mutant melanoma has led to the widespread implementation of molecular assays for the detection of specific BRAF mutations. There have been some attempts to standardize testing of BRAF mutations, but this has not been achieved so far. Here we provide an updated review on the role of the MAPK signaling pathway in the pathogenesis of cutaneous melanoma, focusing on several different BRAF mutations and their diagnostic and therapeutic implications.
In the past 3 decades, a better understanding of gene mutations and their role in carcinogenesis has led to improvement in our ability to treat patients with metastatic disease. The objective of the current study was to determine whether the location of a driver mutation within an affected gene impacts the biology of metastatic colorectal cancer.
DNA was collected from 165 randomly selected specimens of patients who underwent margin-negative resection of colorectal liver metastases with curative intent. Sequenom analysis and Sanger sequencing were used to evaluate mutations in K/NRAS, PIK3CA, BRAF, and TP53.
BRAF mutation was associated with early recurrence and death, whereas no impact of TP53 or PIK3CA mutation was identified. Although K/NRAS mutation was associated with worse survival in this cohort, this difference was no longer evident when those who had received anti-EGFR therapy were excluded. When stratifying patients according to the exon on which K/NRAS was mutated, there were dramatic differences in both survival and pathologic features. Exon 4 mutations were associated with large, solitary metastases occurring at long disease-free intervals compared with exon 3 mutations, which presented with small, numerous lesions. Patients who had exon 4 mutations recurred infrequently and had significantly longer survival compared with those who had wild type or other mutations.
By using this model of curative-intent, margin-negative resection in patients at high risk of recurrence, the authors were able to establish a link between mutation location within the K/NRAS gene and the biology of metastatic colorectal cancer.

In recent years, targeted drugs occupy a pivotal position in the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), drugs targeting epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) has been widely used in clinical practice, it is of milestone significance. V-raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B1 (BRAF) inhibitors targeted at BRAF gene have obviously clinical efficacy to specific advantages populations with little side-effect, and be well tolerated. It is discovered recently that drug resistance also exists in BRAF inhibitors like other targeted drugs, the mechanism of drug resistance is being studied. In this paper, a review were performed in the mechanism, clinical application, adverse reactions and the drug resistance of BRAF inhibitors.
近年来，靶向药物在非小细胞肺癌（non-small cell lung cancer, NSCLC）的治疗中占据着举足轻重的地位，针对表皮生长因子受体（epidermal growth factor receptor, EGFR）的靶向药物已在临床上广泛应用，具有里程碑意义。BRAF抑制剂是针对鼠类肉瘤病毒癌基因同源物B1（V-raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B1, BRAF）基因突变为靶点的靶向药物，对特定优势人群有明显的临床疗效，且毒副作用小，患者易耐受。近期发现，与其他靶向药物一样，BRAF抑制剂也存在耐药现象，其耐药机制正在研究中。本文就BRAF抑制剂的作用机制、临床应用、不良反应及耐药问题进行综述。.
The increase in the incidence of papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) is a serious threat to public health. V-raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B(BRAF)(V600E) gene mutation is not only the common genetics factors, but also is the early event in process of thyroid carcinogenesis. We mainly illustrate the mechanism of BRAF(V600E) gene in genesis and development of PTC and the correlation of BRAF(V600E) gene mutation and the clinicopathological characteristics of PTC. Finally, we briefly summarize some scientific achievements about tyrosine kinase inhibitors targeted for BRAF(V600E) gene and their clinical prospect in terms of translation medicine concept. In summary, BRAF(V600E) gene is expected to be a new molecular marker of PTC, which will take a new hope for individualized precise treatment for patients with PTC.
Microdissection is a useful method in tissue sampling prior to molecular testing. Tumor heterogeneity imposes new challenges for tissue sampling. Different microdissecting methods have been employed in face of such challenge. We improved our microdissection method by separately microdissecting the morphologically different tumor components. This improvement helped the pyrosequencing data analysis of two specimens. One specimen consisted of both adenocarcinoma and neuroendocrine components. When both tumor components were sequenced together for KRAS (Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog) gene mutations, the resulting pyrogram indicated that it was not a wild type, suggesting that it contained KRAS mutation. However, the pyrogram did not match any KRAS mutations and a conclusion could not be reached. After microdissecting and testing the adenocarcinoma and neuroendocrine components separately, it was found that the adenocarcinoma was positive for KRAS G12C mutation and the neuroendocrine component was positive for KRAS G12D mutation. The second specimen consisted of two morphologically different tumor nodules. When microdissected and sequenced separately, one nodule was positive for BRAF (v-raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B1) V600E and the other nodule was wild type at the BRAF codon 600. These examples demonstrate that it is necessary to microdissect morphologically different tumor components for pyrosequencing.
Mutated v-Raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B (BRAF) is an important biomarker for the prediction of therapeutic efficacy of several anticancer drugs. The detection of BRAF mutation faces two challenges: Firstly, there are multiple types of mutations, and secondly, tumor samples usually contain various amounts of wild-type, normal tissues. Here, we describe a newly established method for sensitive detection of multiple types of BRAF V600 mutations in excess wild-type background. The method introduced a fluorophore-tagged peptide nucleic acid (PNA) to serve as both polymerase chain reaction (PCR) clamp and sensor probe, which inhibited the amplification of wild-type templates during PCR and revealed multiple types of mutant signals during melting analysis. We demonstrated the design and optimization process of the method, and applied it in the detection of BRAF mutations in 49 melanoma samples. This PNA probe assay method detected three types of mutations in 17 samples, and was much more sensitive than conventional PCR plus Sanger sequencing.
False negative result remains an ongoing problem in direct gene sequencing of cancers. It is important to use the appropriate mutation detection method most appropriate to each circumstance and the available tissue. Here, we report a patient with melanoma of unknown primary with metastases to spleen and bone marrow, who was tested negative for Cobas BRAF V600E mutation, whose cancer progressed on antiprogrammed death 1 (PD1) receptor monoclonal antibody therapy. Subsequent VE1 immunohistochemistry was positive for BRAF V600E mutation, and the tumor responded dramatically to v-Raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B (BRAF)/Mitogen-activated protein kinase inhibitor combination therapy. This demonstrates how alternative BRAF testing methodology could produce results that can influence treatment choice and the outcome.
Therapy of melanoma patients harboring activating mutations in the BRAF (V-raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B1) oncogene with a combination of BRAF and MEK inhibitors is plagued by the development of drug resistance. Mutational events, as well as adaptive mechanisms, contribute to the development of drug resistance. In this context we uncover here the role of a miRNA, miR-579-3p. We first show that low expression of miR-579-3p is a negative prognostic factor correlating with poor survival. Expression levels of miR-579-3p decrease from nevi to stage III/IV melanoma samples and even further in cell lines resistant to BRAF/MEK inhibitors. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that miR-579-3p acts as an oncosuppressor by targeting the 3'UTR of two oncoproteins: BRAF and an E3 ubiquitin protein ligase, MDM2. Moreover miR-579-3p ectopic expression impairs the establishment of drug resistance in human melanoma cells. Finally, miR-579-3p is strongly down-regulated in matched tumor samples from patients before and after the development of resistance to targeted therapies.
Mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK) inhibitors have aroused considerable interest in oncology. Activity has been demonstrated in various types of cancer, especially melanoma. MEK inhibitors induce a transient retinopathy, considered to be a class effect. At present, only sparse data are available on retinal effects with long-term MEK inhibition.
In this prospective, observational study, patients with advanced melanoma participating in different phase 1/2 or phase 3 clinical trials were treated with the MEK inhibitor binimetinib, with a v-Raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B (BRAF) inhibitor, or with combination therapy. They underwent regular ophthalmological examinations including determination of visual function, biomicroscopy, dilated fundoscopy and optical coherence tomography (OCT) for a period of up to 2 years. Retinopathy was diagnosed on defined OCT criteria.
Sixty-two patients were investigated between 1st October 2011 and 31st July 2015: 13 were treated with the MEK inhibitor binimetinib alone, 10 with a selective BRAF inhibitor, and 39 with combination therapy. In 92% of patients on monotherapy and 100% of those on combination treatment, binimetinib caused dose-related lesions with serous neuroretinal detachments and oedema, strongly dependent on the time after medication. With continued treatment, retinal volume and thickness decreased to levels below baseline, without any apparent functional deficits or changes in structural integrity.
Binimetinib induces a specific retinopathy with daily fluctuations depending on the time interval after medication. The retinopathy partially recovers, but can still be detected many months later. Retinal thinning, possible first signs of retinal atrophy have been observed after long-term treatment, but, so far, without functional relevance.
Compared to early-stage melanoma when surgical excision is possible, metastatic disease continues to offer a much grimmer prognosis as traditional chemotherapy treatment regimens offer relatively little survival benefit. This has led to changes in treatment approaches over the preceding two decades as contemporary methods for the treatment of advanced or metastatic melanoma now involve a number of biological modalities, which include immunotherapeutic approaches, targeted therapies and epigenetic modification therapies. Clinically available immunotherapeutic agents include interleukin 2 (IL-2), as well as drugs targeting the important immune checkpoint molecules, such as cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4) and programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1). The targeted therapeutic agents modulate specific pro-oncogenic mutations such as v-Raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B (BRAF), receptor tyrosine kinases, MEK inhibitors and potential future therapeutic targets, such as the CDK4/CDK6, PTEN and GNAQ/GNA11 genes. Additionally, an increasing understanding of the role of epigenetic alterations in the development and progression of melanoma now offers a new potential drug target. Several of these agents have shown promising results; however, in many investigations, combinations of different therapeutic approaches, each with different mechanisms of action, have yielded improved outcomes as treatment regimens continue to be further optimized by active research and patient disease sub-group analyses. This review summarizes the novel biological agents and new treatments, directly contributing to the significant improvement of biological therapies and markedly advancing knowledge of clinical application of newly approved and developed therapies in treatment of patients with metastatic melanoma.
Anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC), one of the most aggressive solid tumors, is characterized by rapid tumor growth and severe metastasis to other organs. Owing to the lack of effective treatment options, ATC has a mortality rate of ∼100% and median survival of less than 5 months. RNAi nanotechnology represents a promising strategy for cancer therapy through nanoparticle (NP) -mediated delivery of RNAi agents (e.g., siRNA) to solid tumors for specific silencing of target genes driving growth and/or metastasis. Nevertheless, the clinical success of RNAi cancer nanotherapies remains elusive in large part because of the suboptimal systemic siRNA NP delivery to tumors and the fact that tumor heterogeneity produces variable NP accumulation and thus, therapeutic response. To address these challenges, we here present an innovative theranostic NP platform composed of a near-infrared (NIR) fluorescent polymer for effective in vivo siRNA delivery to ATC tumors and simultaneous tracking of the tumor accumulation by noninvasive NIR imaging. The NIR polymeric NPs are small (∼50 nm), show long blood circulation and high tumor accumulation, and facilitate tumor imaging. Systemic siRNA delivery using these NPs efficiently silences the expression of V-Raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B (BRAF) in tumor tissues and significantly suppresses tumor growth and metastasis in an orthotopic mouse model of ATC. These results suggest that this theranostic NP system could become an effective tool for NIR imaging-guided siRNA delivery for personalized treatment of advanced malignancies.
Activating BRAF (V-raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B) mutations occur in approximately 5% to 10% of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer, mostly V600E mutation, and it is associated with distinct clinical and pathological features. To date, there are no approved treatments to target this mutation. BRAF inhibitor monotherapy has limited efficacy, in contrast to metastatic melanoma. Combination strategies that block not only BRAF mutated kinase but other alternative pathways are ongoing and have demonstrated improved activity. This review aims to provide data about new strategies to target to BRAF gene mutation in metastatic colorectal cancer.
The 2007 World Health Organization (WHO) classification of brain tumors did not use molecular abnormalities as diagnostic criteria. Studies have shown that genotyping allows a better prognostic classification of diffuse glioma with improved treatment selection. This has resulted in a major revision of the WHO classification, which is now for adult diffuse glioma centered around isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) and 1p/19q diagnostics. This revised classification is reviewed with a focus on adult brain tumors, and includes a recommendation of genes of which routine testing is clinically useful. Apart from assessment of IDH mutational status including sequencing of R132H-immunohistochemistry negative cases and testing for 1p/19q, several other markers can be considered for routine testing, including assessment of copy number alterations of chromosome 7 and 10 and of TERT promoter, BRAF, and H3F3A mutations. For "glioblastoma, IDH mutated" the term "astrocytoma grade IV" could be considered. It should be considered to treat IDH wild-type grades II and III diffuse glioma with polysomy of chromosome 7 and loss of 10q as glioblastoma. New developments must be more quickly translated into further revised diagnostic categories. Quality control and rapid integration of molecular findings into the final diagnosis and the communication of the final diagnosis to clinicians require systematic attention.
The diagnosis and treatment of gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) has emerged as a paradigm for modern cancer treatment ("precision medicine"), as it highlights the importance of matching molecular defects with specific therapies. Over the past two decades, the molecular classification and diagnostic work up of GIST has been radically transformed, accompanied by the development of molecular therapies for specific subgroups of GIST. This review summarizes the developments in the field of molecular diagnosis of GIST, particularly as they relate to optimizing medical therapy. Areas covered: Based on an extensive literature search of the molecular and clinical aspects of GIST, the authors review the most important developments in this field with an emphasis on the differential diagnosis of GIST including mutation testing, therapeutic implications of each molecular subtype, and emerging technologies relevant to the field. Expert commentary: The use of molecular diagnostics to classify GIST has been shown to be successful in optimizing patient treatment, but these methods remain under-utilized. In order to facilitate efficient and comprehensive molecular testing, the authors have developed a decision-tree to aid clinicians.
Total mesorectal excision combined with neo-adjuvant chemoradiotherary (CRT) and adjuvant chemotherapy, has been the standard treatment of locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC). Although TNM (Tumor, Node, Metastasis) classification for malignant Tumors is still the cornerstone in rectal cancer staging, there has been an effort to identify molecular biomarkers with additional prognostic or predictive value.
We retrospectively analyzed molecular biomarkers on prospectively collected histological specimens and clinical data from a cohort of 135 consecutive rectal cancer cases who underwent radical excision in a tertiary center between 2011-2014 (males=87, females=48, age range=22-89 years, mean=64,67 years, SD=13.40). Radiological, histopathological, molecular staging, treatment stratification by the multidisciplinary team (MDT), as well as prognostic outcome data were compared with various biomarkers including KRAS, BRAF, p16, b-catenin, MSI, MMR and MGMT.
The mean follow-up was 39.21 months (range=5-83 months, SD=21.34). Twenty-eight cases were Stage I (20.9%), n=30 Stage II (22.4%), n=45 Stage III (33.6%) and n=31 Stage IV (23.1%). Forty specimens were KRAS-mutant (mt) (37.4%) while n=67 (62.6%) wild type (wt). KRAS mt status was associated with female sex (n=20, p=0.021) and older age (69.62 vs. 62.27, p=0.005). Stage I Early Cancer Subgroup analysis showed that KRAS mt status is associated with distant recurrence of disease (n=4, p=0.045).
KRAS mt status may affect the prognosis of early rectal cancer, as this is linked with distant recurrence.
The impact of targeted therapies in glioma has been modest. All the therapies that have demonstrated a significant survival benefit for gliomas in Phase III trials, including radiation, chemotherapy (temozolomide and PCV [procarbazine, lomustine, vincristine]), and tumor-treating fields, are based on nonspecific targeting of proliferating cells. Recent advances in the molecular understanding of gliomas suggest some potential reasons for the failure of more targeted therapies in gliomas. Specifically, the histologic-based glioma classification is composed of multiple different molecular subtypes with distinct biology, natural history, and prognosis. As a result of these insights, the diagnosis and classification of gliomas have recently been updated by the World Health Organization. However, these changes and other novel observations regarding glioma biomarkers and subtypes highlight several clinical challenges. First, the field is faced with the difficulty of reinterpreting the results of prior studies and retrospective data using the new classifications to clarify prognostic assessments and treatment recommendations for patients. Second, the new classifications and insights require rethinking the design and stratification of future clinical trials. Last, these observations provide the essential framework for the development and testing of new specific targeted therapies for particular glioma subtypes. This review aims to summarize the current literature regarding glioma subclassifications and their clinical relevance in this evolving field.
Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a heterogeneous disease in terms of molecular carcinogenic pathways. Based on recent findings regarding the multiple serrated neoplasia pathway, we revised an eight-marker panel for a new CIMP classification system.
1370 patients who received surgical resection for CRCs were classified into three CIMP subtypes (CIMP-N: 0-4 methylated markers, CIMP-P1: 5-6 methylated markers and CIMP-P2: 7-8 methylated markers). Our findings were validated in a separate set of high-risk stage II or stage III CRCs receiving adjuvant fluoropyrimidine plus oxaliplatin (n=950).
A total of 1287/62/21 CRCs cases were classified as CIMP-N/CIMP-P1/CIMP-P2, respectively. CIMP-N showed male predominance, distal location, lower T, N category and devoid of BRAF mutation, microsatellite instability (MSI) and MLH1 methylation. CIMP-P1 showed female predominance, proximal location, advanced TNM stage, mild decrease of CK20 and CDX2 expression, mild increase of CK7 expression, BRAF mutation, MSI and MLH1 methylation. CIMP-P2 showed older age, female predominance, proximal location, advanced T category, markedly reduced CK20 and CDX2 expression, rare KRAS mutation, high frequency of CK7 expression, BRAF mutation, MSI and MLH1 methylation. CIMP-N showed better 5-year cancer-specific survival (CSS; HR=0.47; 95% CI: 0.28-0.78) in discovery set and better 5-year relapse-free survival (RFS; HR=0.50; 95% CI: 0.29-0.88) in validation set compared with CIMP-P1. CIMP-P2 showed marginally better 5-year CSS (HR=0.28, 95% CI: 0.07-1.22) in discovery set and marginally better 5-year RFS (HR=0.21, 95% CI: 0.05-0.92) in validation set compared with CIMP-P1.
CIMP subtypes classified using our revised system showed different clinical outcomes, demonstrating the heterogeneity of multiple serrated precursors of CIMP-positive CRCs.British Journal of Cancer advance online publication: 9 March 2017; doi:10.1038/bjc.2017.52 www.bjcancer.com.
This review will discuss the role of several key players in glioma classification and biology, namely isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 and 2 (IDH1/2), alpha thalassemia/mental retardation syndrome X-linked (ATRX), B-Raf (BRAF), telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT), and H3K27M.
IDH1/2 mutation delineates oligoden-droglioma, astrocytoma, and secondary glioblastoma (GBM) from primary GBM and lower-grade gliomas with biology similar to GBM. Additional mutations including TERT, 1p/19q, and ATRX further guide glioma classification and diagnosis, as well as pointing directions toward individualized treatments for these distinct molecular subtypes. ATRX and TERT mutations suggest the importance of telomere maintenance in gliomagenesis. BRAF alterations are key in certain low-grade gliomas and pediatric gliomas but rarely in high-grade gliomas in adults. Histone mutations (e.g., H3K27M) and their effect on chromatin modulation are novel mechanisms of cancer generation and uniquely seen in midline gliomas in children and young adults. Over the past decade, a remarkable accumulation of knowledge from the genomic study of gliomas has led to reclassification of tumors, new understanding of oncogenic mechanisms, and novel treatment strategies.
The updated edition of The World Health Organization Classification of Tumours of the Head and Neck includes discussions on mucosal melanoma of both the sinonasal and oral cavity. Since the prior edition, sinonasal origin is now recognized as the most common site of occurrence of mucosal melanoma in the head and neck (66%) with oral cavity representing 25% of cases. Histologic features of mucosal melanomas vary widely from spindled, epithelioid, and pleomorphic to rhabdoid, plasmacytoid and undifferentiated. Additionally, mucosal melanomas are commonly amelanotic (or minimal pigmentation) (~50%) leading to overlapping features and diagnostic challenges in differentiating mucosal melanomas from other small cell/undifferentiated sinonasal tumors. Since the last edition, formal staging of head and neck mucosal melanomas was added to the American Joint Committee on Cancer entities, though the traditional histologic features that have prognostic significance in cutaneous melanomas fail to stratify mucosal melanomas (i.e. tumor thickness, ulceration). Interestingly, while melanomas of all sites are a malignancy derived from melanocytes, mucosal melanomas are now recognized to have distinct molecular alterations compared to cutaneous or uveal melanomas. BRAF V600E mutations are rare (&lt;6%) in mucosally derived melanomas compared to a rate of 50% in cutaneous melanomas. CD117 (C-Kit) mutations are the most common alteration encountered (~25%) in mucosal sites with potential therapeutic targetability. The recognition of the distinct genetic changes in this subgroup of melanomas means that therapy advances in cutaneous melanomas may not translate to head and neck mucosal melanomas and clinical trials specific to this subgroup of patients are needed.
Pulmonary Adenocarcinoma with Enteric Differentiation (PAED) is a rare subtype of adenocarcinoma of emerging interest, recently introduced in the 2015 WHO classification. However, little is known about major molecular signatures of this class of adenocarcinomas and information about new biomarkers totally lack.
We examined the NRAS, PIK3CA, EGFR, KRAS and BRAF status through mass spectrometry sequencing and ALK rearrangement by FISH in a series of 8 PAEDs.
1/8 (12.5%) case had a simultaneous PIK3CA mutation (E545K) and an EML4-ALK translocation. KRAS gene showed a mutation in the codon 12 in 4/8 of PAED (50%), NRAS, BRAF and EGFR genes were wild type in all tumor samples.
We concluded that PIK3CA mutations and ALK rearrangement occur also in PAEDs, while NRAS mutations might be a very rare event similarly to pulmonary adenocarcinomas of conventional type. KRAS is the prevailing gene mutated in this class of adenocarcinoma.
The purpose of this study was to assess the relationship between vitamin D receptor (VDR) mRNA expression and prognosis in papillary thyroid cancer. RNA sequencing and somatic mutation data from TCGA (the Cancer Genome Atlas) were analyzed. VDR mRNA expression was compared to clinicopathologic variables by linear regression. Tree-based classification was applied to find VDR cutoff and patients were split into low and high VDR group. Logistic regression, Kaplan-Meier analysis, differentially expressed gene (DEG) test, and pathway analysis were performed to assess differences between groups. VDR mRNA expression was elevated in PTC than in normal thyroid tissue. VDR expressions were high in classic and tall cell variant PTC, extrathyroidal extension (ETE), and lateral neck node metastasis. High VDR group associated with PTC subtype, ETE and recurrence in logistic regression. In DEG test, 545 genes were upregulated in high VDR group. Cellular interaction/adhesion, cell membrane components, and immune/cancer-related receptor signaling activity/pathways were enriched in high VDR group in pathway analysis. In conclusion, overexpression of VDR mRNA correlates with subtypes of papillary thyroid carcinoma that have the worse prognosis, classic and tall cell variant, and factors associated with poor prognosis such as extrathyroidal extension, lateral neck node metastasis, BRAF V600E mutation and tumor recurrence.
The carcinogenesis of non-small cell lung carcinoma has been found to associate with activating and resistant mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain of specific oncogenes. Here, we assessed the type, frequency, and abundance of epithelial growth factor receptor, KRAS, BRAF, and ALK mutations in 154 non-small cell lung carcinoma specimens using single-molecule amplification and re-sequencing technology. We found that epithelial growth factor receptor mutations were the most prevalent (44.2%), followed by KRAS (18.8%), ALK (7.8%), and BRAF (5.8%) mutations. The type and abundance of the mutations in tumor specimens appeared to be heterogeneous. Thus, we conclude that identification of clinically significant oncogenic mutations may improve the classification of patients and provide valuable information for determination of the therapeutic strategies.
Thymic epithelial tumors (TETs) are rare neoplasms with different prognosis lacking consistent molecular alterations possibly leading to targeted therapy. We collected a consecutive series of TETs aimed at investigating the mutational status of druggable genes (EGFR, c-KIT, KRAS, BRAF, PDGFR-alpha and -beta, HER2 and c-MET) and the expression of ALK and PD-L1.
One hundred twelve consecutive cases of TETs and relative clinico-pathologic features were collected. Immunohistochemical expression of ALK (clone D5F3) and PD-L1 (clone E1L3N), molecular analysis of EGFR (exons 18-21), c-KIT (exons 9,11,13,14,17), KRAS (exon 2), BRAF (exon 15), PDGFR-alpha (exon 12) and -beta (exons 12, 14, 18), HER-2 (exons 19 and 20) and c-MET (exons 14, 17, 18, 19) mutations were performed. Immuno-molecular results were then statistically matched with clinico-pathologic characteristics.
Patients were male in 54% of cases, with a median age of 61 years (range 19-83) and affected mainly by thymoma (78%) in stage II (45%). At molecular analysis, there were 4 c-KIT mutations (occurring in exon 11 V559A, L576P, Y553N and exon 17 D820E) in thymic carcinomas (typeC), but not in other tumor types (p=0.003). No mutations were detected in other genes and none case was ALK positive. Twenty-nine (26%) cases were PD-L1 positive (65% of thymic carcinomas and 18% of thymomas). High PD-L1 expression was statistically associated with WHO classification stage type C (p&lt;0.001) and Masaoka stage III-IV disease (p=0.007). In univariate analysis, WHO classification type C, advanced Masaoka stage and absence of myasthenia, but not PD-L1 expressions were correlated with worse survival; at multivariate analysis, only WHO type C confirmed its negative prognostic role.
A subset of TETs as thymic carcinomas can harbor c-KIT mutations and elevated PD-L1 expression that could represent targets of potential therapeutic use.
Small molecules targeting aberrant RAF activity, like Vemurafenib (PLX4032), are highly effective against cancers harboring the V600E BRAF mutation, and are now approved for clinical use against metastatic melanoma. However, in tissues showing elevated RAS activity and in RAS-mutant tumors, these inhibitors stimulate RAF dimerization, resulting in inhibitor resistance and downstream paradoxical ERK activation. To understand the global signaling response of cancer cells to RAF inhibitors, we profiled the temporal changes of the phosphoproteome of two colon cancer cell lines (Colo205 and HCT116) that respond differently to Vemurafenib. Comprehensive data mining and filtering identified a total of 37910 phosphorylation sites, 660 of which were dynamically modulated upon treatment with Vemurafenib. We established that 83% of these dynamic phosphorylation sites were modulated in accordance with the phospho-ERK profile of the two cell lines. Accordingly, kinase-substrate prediction algorithms linked most of these dynamic sites to direct ERK1/2-mediated phosphorylation, supporting a low off-target rate for Vemurafenib. Functional classification of target proteins indicated the enrichment of known (nuclear pore, transcription factors, RAS-RTK signaling) and novel (Rho GTPases signaling, actin cytoskeleton) ERK-controlled functions. Our phosphoproteomic data combined with experimental validation established novel dynamic connections between ERK signaling and the transcriptional regulators TEAD3 (Hippo pathway), MKL1 and MKL2 (Rho-SRF pathway). We also confirm that an ERK docking site found in MKL1 is directly antagonized by overlapping actin binding, defining a novel mechanism of actin-modulated phosphorylation. Altogether, time-resolved phosphoproteomics further documented Vemurafenib selectivity and identified novel ERK downstream substrates.
The updated S3 guidelines on malignant melanoma were established in August 2016. The principles of diagnostics and classification are based on the histopathological results from the primary tumor and if necessary the sentinel lymph nodes. The most important factor for prognosis is the tumor thickness according to Breslow and the detection of sentinel node micrometastases. The surgical safety margin after excision is dependent on the tumor thickness. Furthermore, ulceration of the primary tumor and presence of mitosis in melanomas less than 1 mm in thickness are also considered in the T‑classification. The sentinel lymph nodes should be prepared according to established procedures using HE staining and immunohistochemical methods. The largest tumor diameter of a micrometastasis should be measured in tenths of a millimeter (Rotterdam classification). Molecular pathology testing for mutations in the BRAF and NRAS oncogenes should be carried out in patients with metastatic disease or surgically non-resectable tumors. In addition c-KIT mutations should be tested in acral lentiginous and mucosal melanomas. Treatment with signal transduction inhibitors is possible when mutations have been detected.
Rosette forming glioneuronal tumors are rare, World Health Organization (WHO) grade I novel tumors frequently affecting the fourth ventricle or posterior fossa with typical neuronal pseudorosettes. RGNTs have been described as possessing additional histologic features of DNETs or pilocytic astrocytomas. Activating PIK3CA mutations have been identified as recurring genetic event in RGNTs.
We report a 35year old man who presented with binocular diplopia, headache, and was found to have a third ventricle tumor. Tumor pathology and oncogene evaluation were conducted.
The tumor demonstrated histologic features consistent with mixed RGNT/DNET. Genetic studies revealed a PIK3CA mutation in exon 9 (E545K, C. 1633G&gt;A) without IDH1, p53, 1p19q chromosomal co-deletion, or BRAF mutations. A literature search revealed six cases of PIK3CA mutations in RGNTs and seven cases of mixed RGNT/DNET. No cases of mixed RGNT/DNET with a PIK3CA mutation have been described.
This is the first documented case of an RGNT/DNET with an activating PIK3CA mutation. The presence of a PIK3CA mutation aids histologic classification in the setting of mixed histology, and may have implications for targeting the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway in this tumor type.
Since the MOSAIC study, oxaliplatin-based adjuvant chemotherapy has been the standard treatment for stage III colon cancer. Combination therapy with fluoropyrimidines and oxaliplatin has improved overall survival (OS) and reduced the risk of recurrence in patients with resected stage III colon cancer. However, only 20% of patients really benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy, exposing 80% of patients to unnecessary toxicity. Recent analyses of large multicenter adjuvant studies have focused on the prognostication of OS and disease free survival (DFS) in stage III colon cancer in order to reduce over-treatment and to find more accurate prognostic tools than those used for adjuvant treatment decision-making in stage II disease. Indeed, clinical and pathological prognostic factors, although important, are not sufficient to decide which stage III patients will benefit from adjuvant therapy , AND BIOMARKERS WILL HELP SELECT PATIENT THAT NEED ADJUVANT TREATMENT: Molecular markers such as microsatellite status and BRAF and KRAS mutations have recently been explored, and molecular signatures have been identified as promising prognostic factor for OS. Furthermore, recent studies have highlighted the prognostic value of immune infiltration. This review focuses on pathologic, immunologic and molecular prognostic markers for stage III colon cancer that could help clinicians tailor adjuvant treatment in a comprehensive transversal approach.
A gender disparity exists with respect to the incidence of papillary thyroid cancer (PTC), suggesting that sex hormones such as estrogen play a role in PTC development and progression. In this study, we compared estrogen receptor gene expression patterns in PTCs to determine the clinical significance of estrogen gene expression in PTC.
We analyzed ESR1 and ESR2 messenger RNA expression counts using data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). To validate the results of TCGA analysis, we analyzed microarray data (GSE 54958) from the Gene Expression Omnibus.
ESR1 gene expression and ESR ratio (ESR1/ESR2) were significantly higher in PTC tissues than in paired normal thyroid tissues (mean 659.427 vs. 264.045 for ESR1, 92.017 vs. 19.064 for ESR ratio). Among female patients, ESR1 expression and ESR ratio were negatively correlated with increased age. ESR1 expression and ESR ratio were higher in patients with classic PTC, lymphovascular invasion, BRAF (V600E) mutation, and radioiodine therapy. Classification analysis demonstrated that higher ESR1 expression and a higher ESR ratio faced a worse overall survival (hazard ratio 6.348 for ESR1, 4.031 for ESR ratio). Validation microarray analysis demonstrated that ESR1 expression and ESR ratio were higher in tumor tissues, classic PTC, and BRAF (V600E).
Higher ESR1 expression and a higher ESR ratio were associated with aggressive prognostic factors and worse overall survival in female PTC patients. Our results suggest that ESR1 and ESR ratio can be used as prognostic markers to predict female patient survival and have potential as a therapeutic target.
The 8th edition of AJCC cancer staging system will be launched all over the world in January 1, 2018. The major advances in the 8th edition are the introduction of non-anatomic prognostic and predictive factors supported by I(-II( grade evidence based on histopathology and molecular biology, and the improvement of prognostic assessment system based on these factors, including CEA level, cancer retraction score, circumference margin, lymphatic invasion, peripheral nerve invasion, microsatellite instability, KRAS/NRAS gene mutation and BRAF gene mutation. In the background of evidence-based medicine and precise medicine, combination of anatomic staging and non-anatomic classification system is very important for establishing and improving the prognostic and predictive assessment system of colorectal cancer. This will help to assess colorectal cancer staging and grouping much better, evaluate the prognosis, predict individualized efficacy, and promote clinical practice of colorectal cancer from traditional population-based diagnosis and treatment to the precise individualized care.
Tumor tissue consists of a heterogeneous cell population. The allelic imbalance (AI) ratio, determined in isolated tumor glands, is a good index of tumor heterogeneity. However, associations of the patterns of AI and microsatellite instability (MSI) development, observed in most cases of colorectal cancer (CRC), with tumor progression have not been reported previously. In this study, we examined whether CRC genetic profiles stratified by a combination of the AI ratio and MSI facilitate categorization of CRC, and whether these genetic profiles are associated with specific molecular alterations in CRC. A crypt isolation method was used to isolate DNA from tumors and normal glands obtained from 147 sporadic CRCs. AI and MSI statuses were determined using PCR-based microsatellite analysis and stratified based on AI ratio and MSI status. DNA methylation status (high methylation, intermediate methylation and low methylation status and mutations in KRAS, BRAF, and TP53 were examined. In addition, mucin markers were immunostained. Based on this analysis, four subgroups were categorized. Subgroup 1 was characterized by a high MSI status and BRAF mutation; subgroup 2 was closely associated with a high AI ratio, which accumulated during the early phases of colorectal carcinogenesis, and TP53 mutation; subgroup 3 was associated with a low AI ratio, seen during the later phases of colorectal carcinogenesis, and KRAS mutation; and subgroup 4 was defined as a minor subgroup. These results confirmed that classification of distinct molecular profiles provides important insights into colorectal carcinogenesis. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
Next-generation sequencing enables faster, cheaper and more accurate whole-genome sequencing, allowing genome profiling and discovery of molecular features. As molecular targeted drugs are developed, treatment can be tailored according to molecular subtype. Gastric and colorectal cancers have each been divided into four subtypes according to molecular features. Profiling of the esophageal cancer genome is underway and its classification is anticipated. To date, identification of HER2 expression in gastric adenocarcinoma and KRAS, NRAS and BRAF mutations in colon cancer have proved essential for treatment decisions. However, to overcome therapy resistance and improve prognosis, further individualized therapy is required. Here, we summarize the treatment options for gastrointestinal cancer according to genomic profiling and discuss future directions.
Novel, "outside of the box" approaches are needed for evaluating candidate molecules, especially in oncology. Throughout the years of 2000-2010, the efficiency of drug development fell to barely acceptable levels, and in the second decade of this century, levels have improved only marginally. This dismal condition continues despite unprecedented progress in the development of a variety of high-throughput tools, computational methods, aggregated databases, drug repurposing programs and innovative chemistries. Here we tested a hypothesis that the economic impact of targeting a particular gene product is predictable a priori by employing a combination of transcriptome profiles and quantitative metrics reflecting existing literature.
To extract classification features, the gene expression patterns of a posteriori high-impact and low-impact anti-cancer target sets were compared. To minimize the possible bias of text-mining, the number of manuscripts published prior to the first clinical trial or relevant review paper, as well as its first derivative in this interval, were collected and used as quantitative metrics of public interest.
By combining the gene expression and literature mining features, a 4-fold enrichment in high-impact targets was produced, resulting in a favourable ROC curve analysis for the top impact targets. The dataset was enriched by the highest impact anti-cancer targets, while demonstrating drastic differences in economic value between high and low-impact targets. Known anti-cancer products of EGFR, ERBB2, CYP19A1/aromatase, MTOR, PTGS2, tubulin, VEGFA, BRAF, PGR, PDGFRA, SRC, REN, CSF1R, CTLA4 and HSP90AA1 genes received the highest scores for predicted impact, while microsomal steroid sulfatase, anticoagulant protein C, p53, CDKN2A, c-Jun, and TNSFS11 were highlighted as most promising research-stage targets.
A significant cost reduction may be achieved by a priori impact assessment of targets and ligands before their development or repurposing. Expanding a suite of combinational treatments could also decrease the costs, while achieving a higher impact per developed ligand. This article is open to POST-PUBLICATION REVIEW.

Gastrointestinal stromal tumours (GISTs) are a commonly encountered tumour in routine practice. In the main, the morphology of spindle, epithelioid or mixed are well recognised along with mutations of c-kit However, there are other genes that are mutated resulting in characteristic clinicopathological correlations. GISTs harbouring platelet-derived growth factor receptor α (PDGFRα) gene mutations lead to a typical morphological constellation of findings: gastric and omental location, gross tumour that is cystic and haemorrhagic, composed of epithelioid, plasmacytoid cells exhibiting pleomorphism, low mitotic count and containing characteristic giant cells with peripherally placed nuclei. These cells are set in a myxoid stroma containing several mast cells. In addition, perivascular/intratumoural hyalinisation is often seen. These tumours are CD117 and DOG-1 positive. GISTs with SDH mutations are multinodular/bilobed/dumb-bell shape tumour masses with mucosal ulceration and histologically characterised by fibrous bands around and within nodules of epithelioid or mixed epithelioid/spindle cells. Lymphovascular invasion with lymph node metastases are usual. Immunohistochemically, the GISTs are CD117, DOG-1 positive, SDHA negative (if SDHA mutated), SDHA positive (if SDHA intact) and SDHB negative. BRAF and NF-1 mutated GISTs do not have any characteristic morphological features.
Anti-EGFR monoclonal antibodies (anti-EGFRmAb) serve in the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC), but patients with a mutation in KRAS/BRAF and nearly one-half of those without the mutation fail to respond. We performed microRNA (miRNA) analysis to find miRNAs predicting anti-EGFRmAb efficacy. Of the 99 mCRC patients, we studied differential miRNA expression by microarrays from primary tumors of 33 patients who had wild-type KRAS/BRAF and third- to sixth-line anti-EGFRmAb treatment, with/without irinotecan. We tested the association of each miRNA with overall survival (OS) by the Cox proportional hazards regression model. Significant miR-31* up-regulation and miR-592 down-regulation appeared in progressive disease versus disease control. miR-31* expression and down-regulation of its target genes SLC26A3 and ATN1 were verified by quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. Clustering of patients based on miRNA expression revealed a significant difference in OS between patient clusters. Members of the let-7 family showed significant up-regulation in the patient cluster with poor OS. Additionally, miR-140-5p up-regulation and miR-1224-5p down-regulation were significantly associated with poor OS in both cluster analysis and the Cox proportional hazards regression model. In mCRC patients with wild-type KRAS/BRAF, miRNA profiling can efficiently predict the benefits of anti-EGFRmAb treatment. Larger series of patients are necessary for application of these miRNAs as predictive/prognostic markers.
Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) are the most common mesenchymal neoplasms of the gastrointestinal tract, disclosing somatic KIT, PDGFRA and BRAF mutations. Loss of function of succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) complex is an alternative molecular mechanism in GISTs, namely in carriers of germline mutations of the SDH complex that develop Carney-Stratakis dyad characterized by multifocal GISTs and multicentric paragangliomas (PGLs). We studied a series of 25 apparently sporadic primary wild-type (WT) KIT/PDGFRA/BRAF GISTs occurring in patients without personal or familial history of PGLs, re-evaluated clinicopathological features and analyzed molecular alterations and immunohistochemistry expression of SDH complex. As control, we used a series of well characterized 49 KIT/PDGFRA/BRAF-mutated GISTs. SDHB expression was absent in 20% and SDHB germline mutations were detected in 12% of WT GISTs. Germline SDHB mutations were significantly associated to younger age at diagnosis. A significant reduction in SDHB expression in WT GISTs was found when compared with KIT/PDGFRA/BRAF-mutated GISTs. No significant differences were found when comparing DOG-1 and c-KIT expression in WT, SDHB-mutated and KIT/PDGFRA/BRAF-mutated GISTs. Our results confirm the occurrence of germline SDH genes mutations in isolated, apparently sporadic WT GISTs. WT KIT/PDGFRA/BRAF GISTs without SDHB or SDHA/SDHB expression may correspond to Carney-Stratakis dyad or Carney triad. Most importantly, the possibility of PGLs (Carney-Stratakis dyad) and/or pulmonary chondroma (Carney triad) should be addressed in these patients and their kindred.
Hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha (HIF-1 alpha) is upregulated by hypoxia and oncogenic signalling in many solid tumours. Its regulation and function in thyroid carcinomas are unknown. We evaluated the regulation of HIF-1 alpha and target gene expression in primary thyroid carcinomas and thyroid carcinoma cell lines (BcPAP, WRO, FTC-133 and 8505c). HIF-1 alpha was not detectable in normal tissue but was expressed in thyroid carcinomas. Dedifferentiated anaplastic tumours (ATCs) exhibited high levels of nuclear HIF-1 alpha staining. The HIF-1 target glucose transporter 1 was expressed to a similar level in all tumour types, whereas carbonic anhydrase-9 was significantly elevated in ATCs. In vitro studies revealed a functionally active HIF-1 alpha pathway in thyroid cells with transcriptional activation observed after graded hypoxia (1% O(2), anoxia) or treatment with a hypoxia mimetic cobalt chloride. High basal and hypoxia-induced expression of HIF-1 alpha in FTC-133 cells that harbour a phosphatase and tensin homologue (PTEN) mutation was reduced by introduction of wild-type PTEN. Similarly, pharmacological inhibition of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway using LY294002 inhibited HIF-1 alpha and HIF-1 alpha targets in all cell lines, including those with B-RAF mutations (BcPAP and 8505c). In contrast, the effects of inhibition of the RAF/MEK/extracellular signal-regulated kinase pathway were restricted by environmental condition and B-RAF mutation status. HIF-1 is functionally expressed in thyroid carcinomas and is regulated not only by hypoxia but also via growth factor signalling pathways and, in particular, the PI3K pathway. Given the strong association of HIF-1 alpha with an aggressive disease phenotype and therapeutic resistance, this pathway may be an attractive target for improved therapy in thyroid carcinomas.
We established a novel melanoma cell line, SMYM-PRGP, which was non-tumorigenic in vivo, from an acral melanoma in radial growth phase under a low-oxygen environment. SMYM-PRGP was wild-type for known mutation sites in the BRAF and NRAS genes, and showed focal amplification of the human telomerase reverse transcriptase and cyclin D1 genes as well as the fibroblast growth factor-3 and fibroblast growth factor-4 genes. Neither mutation nor copy number loss of the CDKN2A gene was observed. The p16(INK4A) protein was expressed at a level equal to that in normal melanocytes. Among the various melanocyte growth factors added to the culture of SMYM-PRGP cells, endothelin-1 was the strongest growth stimulator, the effect of which was significantly augmented by the addition of calcium chloride. The growth stimulatory effect of endothelin-1 was shown to be mediated via the endothelin B receptor. The protein level of cyclin D1 in SMYM-PRGP cells was approximately 10 times higher than that in normal melanocytes. Although the stimulation with endothelin-1 plus calcium chloride increased cyclin D1 protein levels after 4-6 h, the level of phosphorylated retinoblastoma protein did not increase, suggesting that overexpression of cyclin D1 protein may have little effect on cell cycle progression but rather act as a pro-survival factor. SMYM-PRGP is an excellent tool for investigating the development and progression of acral melanoma.
Eighteen patients treated with oxybutynin chloride are presented. The effect of the drug on the hyperactive detrusor is shown and discussed. Side effects and limitations are described and related to treatment.
B-Raf kinase is the key point in a main branch of mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways and some of its mutations, such as the V600E mutation, lead to the persistent activation of ERK signaling and the trigger of severe diseases, including melanoma and other somatic cancers. Several potent drugs have been approved to treat B-Raf-related tumors, however, cases of resistance and relapse have been reported universally. Hence, differential scaffolds are in need to alleviate the scarcity of drugs and benefit the therapy of B-Raf-mutant cancers. Herein we report our recent work on the construction of novel B-Raf(V600E) inhibitors employing fragment-based drug design strategy. In this research, we decomposed known inhibitors to fragments and rebuilt new candidates using these blocks according to the evaluation of their potential. Lead compounds were synthesized after selection by means of virtual screening and molecular dynamics validation. Afterwards, we tested the pharmacological efficiency of these entities both in vitro and in vivo utilizing A375 xenograft model. The results favored our rational design intention and hinted this new kind of inhibitors might be helpful in the further explorations of potent agents.
Thyroid cancer is common type of malignant tumor in humans, and the autophagy status of such tumors may vary according to subtype. This study aimed to investigate the expression and implications of the major autophagy-related molecules light chain (LC) 3A, LC3B, p62, and BNIP-3 in human thyroid carcinoma. Tissue microarrays were constructed from 555 thyroid cancers (papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC): 342; follicular carcinoma (FC): 112; medullary carcinoma (MC): 70; poorly differentiated carcinoma (PDC): 23; and anaplastic carcinoma (AC): 8) and 152 follicular adenomas (FAs). Expression of autophagy-related molecules (LC3A, LC3B, p62, and BNIP-3) was detected immunohistochemically, and the results were analyzed via comparison with clinicopathologic parameters. Tumoral LC3A and LC3B expressions were the highest in MC (p &lt; 0.001), whereas stromal LC3A expression was higher in AC and PTC (p &lt; 0.001). BNIP-3 expression was absent in MC and AC (p = 0.013). Tumoral LC3A, LC3B, and p62 expressions were higher in conventional type PTC, compared with those in the follicular variant. PTC with the BRAF V600E mutation exhibited higher expression of all autophagy-related proteins relative to PTC without this mutation (p &lt; 0.05). BNIP-3 negativity was associated with capsular invasion in FC (p = 0.001), and p62 negativity was associated with lymph node metastasis in MC (p = 0.006). In a univariate analysis, LC3B negativity was associated with shorter disease-free survival in PTC with the BRAF V600E mutation (p = 0.024). We conclude that the expression of autophagy-related proteins differs according to thyroid cancer subtype.
Mutations in the BRAF gene have been implicated in several human cancers. The objective of this screening study was to identify patients with solid tumors (other than metastatic melanoma or papillary thyroid cancer) or multiple myeloma harboring activating BRAF(V600) mutations for enrollment in a vemurafenib clinical study.
Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumor samples were collected and sent to a central laboratory to identify activating BRAF(V600) mutations by bidirectional direct Sanger sequencing.
Overall incidence of BRAF(V600E) mutation in evaluable patients (n=548) was 3% (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.7-4.7): 11% in colorectal tumors (n=75), 6% in biliary tract tumors (n=16), 3% in non-small cell lung cancers (n=71), 2% in other types of solid tumors (n=180), and 3% in multiple myeloma (n=31). There were no BRAF(V600) mutations in this cohort of patients with ovarian tumors (n=68), breast cancer (n=86), or prostate cancer (n=21).
This multicenter, national screening study confirms previously reported incidences of BRAF(V600) mutations from single-center studies. Patients identified with BRAF(V600) mutations were potentially eligible for enrollment in the VE-BASKET study.
The aim of this meta-analysis is to evaluate the distribution pattern of KRAS and BRAF mutations in colorectal cancer.
The database was searched without language restrictions. Meta-analyses were conducted using the STATA software. We calculated the odds ratio (OR) and its 95% confidence interval (95% CI) to estimate the distribution of and correlation between KRAS and BRAF mutations, CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP), and microsatellite instability (MSI) in left- and right-sided colorectal cancer.
The studies were divided into five groups: (1) distribution of KRAS/BRAF mutations in distal and proximal colorectal cancer, the summary OR value was 1.24 versus 4.03, (2) distribution of KRAS/BRAF mutations in CIMP-low/Neg and CIMP-high (CIMP-H) tumors, the summary OR value was 0.77 versus 10.49, (3) distribution of KRAS/BRAF mutations in MSI-low (MSI-L)/microsatellite stable (MSS) and MSI-high (MSI-H) tumors, the summary OR value was 0.51 versus 9.60, (4) proportion of CIMP-H/MSI-H tumors among distal and proximal colorectal tumors, the summary OR value was 3.66 versus 6.54, and (5) proportion of CIMP-H tumors among MSI-L/MSS and MSI-H tumors, the summary OR value was 5.87.
The meta-analysis reveals that KRAS has a slightly higher mutation rate in MSI-L/MSS tumors. Moreover, BRAF mutations have higher detection rates in right-sided colorectal cancer, which suggests that BRAF mutations are likely in CIMP-H tumors. Therefore, based on these findings, the molecular diagnostic tests to be conducted in colorectal cancer patients can be determined according to the location/clinical features of the tumor.
Colorectal cancer incidences are on a rise in India. In this study, we have analyzed the mutation frequencies of six potential biomarkers, their coexistence, association with clinicopathological characteristics, and tumor location in Indian colorectal cancer patients. Next-generation sequencing was performed to identify mutations in the six potential biomarker genes using formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue blocks of 112 colorectal cancer patients. The mutation frequency observed in KRAS, BRAF, PIK3CA, NRAS, TP53, and APC was 35.7%, 7.1%, 16.1%, 6.3%, 39.3%, and 29.5%, respectively. The significant associations of mutations were KRAS with age less than 60 years (p = 0.041), PIK3CA with males (p = 0.032), tumor stage I-II (p = 0.013), lack of metastasis in lymph nodes (p = 0.040), NRAS with rectum (p = 0.002), and APC with T2 stage of tumor growth (p = 0.013). No single patient harbored mutations in these six genes or any five genes simultaneously. Significance was noted in coexistence of KRAS with APC (p = 0.024) and mutual exclusion of KRAS with BRAF (p = 0.029). PIK3CA exon 9 was observed to be more frequently associated with KRAS mutations than PIK3CA exon 20 (p = 0.072). NRAS mutations were mutually exclusive with BRAF and PIK3CA mutations. As per our knowledge, this is the first next-generation sequencing-based biomarker study in Indian colorectal cancer patients. Frequent coexistence of gene mutations in pairs and triplets suggests that synergistic effect of overlapping mutations might further trigger the disease. In addition, infrequent coexistence of multiple gene mutations hints toward different signaling pathways for colorectal cancer tumorigenesis.
Immune checkpoint inhibitors and targeted therapies, two new class of drugs for treatment of metastatic melanoma, have not been compared in randomized controlled trials (RCT). We quantitatively summarized the evidence and compared immune and targeted therapies in terms of both efficacy and toxicity.
A comprehensive search for RCTs of immune checkpoint inhibitors and targeted therapies was conducted to August 2016. Using a network meta-analysis approach, treatments were compared with each other and ranked based on their effectiveness (as measured by the impact on progression-free survival [PFS]) and acceptability (the inverse of high grade toxicity).
Twelve RCTs enrolling 6207 patients were included. Network meta-analysis generated 15 comparisons. Combined BRAF and MEK inhibitors were associated with longer PFS as compared to anti-CTLA4 (HR: 0.22; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.12-0.41) and anti-PD1 antibodies alone (HR: 0.38; CI: 0.20-0.72). However, anti-PD1 monoclonal antibodies were less toxic than anti-CTLA4 monoclonal antibodies (RR: 0.65; CI: 0.40-0.78) and their combination significantly increased toxicity compared to either single agent anti-CTLA4 (RR: 2.06; CI: 1.45-2.93) or anti-PD1 monoclonal antibodies (RR: 3.67; CI: 2.27-5.96). Consistently, ranking analysis suggested that the combination of targeted therapies is the most effective strategy, whereas single agent anti-PD1 antibodies have the best acceptability. The GRADE level of evidence quality for these findings was moderate to low.
The simultaneous inhibition of BRAF and MEK appears the most effective treatment for melanomas harboring BRAF V600 mutation, although anti-PD1 antibodies appear to be less toxic. Further research is needed to increase the quality of evidence.
Melanoma represents 2-3% of all cancers, 95% of them arise from skin, while only 5% are non-cutaneous melanoma. Despite an optimal surgery management, the risk of a local and systemic relapse remains high, particularly in high-risk patients (node-positive or node-negative T3b, T4 a/b). We conducted a systematic review of the main published and ongoing phase I/II/III trials between 2000 and June 2015 on the adjuvant treatment of cutaneous melanoma. The IFN remains the only option currently available for this aim. Ipilimumab represents a possible breakthrough in this setting, considering the positive results of the EORTC 18701 trials in terms of disease free survival (DFS), while data regarding OS are pending. Recent advances in the understanding of the biology of melanoma result in the identification of MAPK pathway role in the melanoma development Based on these features, B-RAF inhibitors and their combination with immunotherapy could represent the upcoming therapeutic strategy.
The screening of bioactive compound libraries can be an effective approach for repositioning FDA-approved drugs or discovering new treatments for human diseases (drug repositioning). Drug repositioning refers to the development of existing drugs for new indications. Dabrafenib (DAB) is a B-Raf inhibitor and initially used for the treatment of metastatic melanoma therapy. Here, we tested the possible use of DAB in the treatment of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-mediated vascular inflammatory responses. The anti-inflammatory activities of DAB were determined by measuring permeability, neutrophils adhesion and migration, and activation of pro-inflammatory proteins in LPS-activated human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and mice. We found that DAB inhibited LPS-induced barrier disruption, expression of cell adhesion molecules (CAMs), and adhesion/transendothelial migration of neutrophils to human endothelial cells. DAB also suppressed LPS-induced hyperpermeability and leukocytes migration in vivo. Furthermore, DAB suppressed the production of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) or Interleukin (IL)-6 and the activation of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) or extracellular regulated kinases (ERK) 1/2 by LPS. Moreover, treatment with DAB resulted in reduced LPS-induced lethal endotoxemia. These results suggest that DAB possesses anti-inflammatory functions by inhibiting hyperpermeability, expression of CAMs, and adhesion and migration of leukocytes, thereby endorsing its usefulness as a therapy for vascular inflammatory diseases.
Studies focused on the killing of activated B-RAF melanoma cells by the histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor AR42. Compared to other tumor cell lines, PDX melanoma isolates were significantly more sensitive to AR42-induced killing. AR42 and the multi-kinase inhibitor pazopanib interacted to activate: an eIF2α-Beclin1 pathway causing autophagosome formation; an eIF2α-DR4/DR5/CD95 pathway; and an eIF2α-dependent reduction in the expression of c-FLIP-s, MCL-1 and BCL-XL. AR42 did not alter basal chaperone activity but increased the ability of pazopanib to inhibit HSP90, HSP70 and GRP78. AR42 and pazopanib caused HSP90/HSP70 dissociation from RAF-1 and B-RAF that resulted in reduced 'RAF' expression. The drug combination activated a DNA-damage-ATM-AMPK pathway that was associated with: NFκB activation; reduced mTOR S2448 and ULK-1 S757 phosphorylation; and increased ULK-1 S317 and ATG13 S318 phosphorylation. Knock down of PERK, eIF2α, Beclin1, ATG5 or AMPKα, or expression of IκB S32A S36A, ca-mTOR or TRX, reduced cell killing. AR42, via lysosomal degradation, reduced the protein expression of HDACs 2/5/6/10/11. In vivo, a 3-day exposure of dabrafenib/trametinib resistant melanoma cells to the AR42 pazopanib combination reduced tumor growth and enhanced survival from ~25 to ~40 days. Tumor cells that had adapted through therapy exhibited elevated HGF expression and the c-MET inhibitor crizotinib enhanced AR42 pazopanib lethality in this evolved drug-resistant population.
Primary oral mucosal melanoma is an extremely rare and aggressive tumor arising from melanocytes located in the mucosal epithelium of the oral cavity. Although malignant melanoma of oral mucosa shares some clinical features with its cutaneous counterpart, it has been associated with a worst prognosis; its etiopathogenesis are still only partially unraveled as there is no influence of UV radiation. It is known that the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway mediates cellular responses to growth signals and its activation is an important phenomenon in melanoma. The aim of this study was to evaluate NRAS and BRAF genes, both components of mitogen-activated protein kinase molecular pathway, and compare with their protein expression. Point mutations of NRAS (codons 12, 13, and 61) and BRAF (codon 600) were screened by pyrosequencing method, and its results were associated to the protein expression of RAS and BRAF performed by immunohistochemistry. The authors observed mutation in BRAF 600 (3/14), NRAS codons 12 and 13 (2/14), and NRAS codon 61 (2/8). One case showed positive RAS protein expression, but no mutation was observed. Twelve in 14 cases showed positive BRAF protein expression: 3 cases showed BRAF mutation; 2 cases showed NRAS codon 61 mutation; 2 cases showed NRAS codons 12 and 13 mutation but not simultaneously. Although NRAS and BRAF mutation frequency and RAS protein expression are low, BRAF protein expression was intense; probably, NRAS and BRAF mutations are independent events and alternative molecular mechanisms in the primary oral mucosal melanoma tumorigenesis.
Historically, metastatic melanoma has had extremely poor survival outcomes. The outlook, however, is rapidly changing as new molecularly targeted therapies have vastly improved patient outcomes. One such therapy is the potent mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK) 1/2 inhibitor cobimetinib. Recently, cobimetinib was approved for the treatment of metastatic or unresectable melanoma with serine/threonine-protein kinase B-raf (BRAF) V600E or V600K mutations when used in combination with the BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib. Currently, multiple clinical trials are investigating this drug combination for the treatment of various cancer types (e.g., breast, melanoma, colorectal). In the phase III coBRIM trial, this combination therapy showed improved melanoma response rates and patient progression-free survival when compared to vemurafenib alone. Additionally, toxicities were generally found to be manageable with dose modification or interruption. However, tumor response to BRAF/MEK inhibition, though rapid, is often short-lived as tumors develop resistance to this combination therapy. Therefore, new trials are beginning to investigate the addition of a third targeted agent or immunotherapy in order to increase the durability of treatment response. These trials are already showing promising preliminary results.
Melanoma is traditionally considered to be a radioresistant tumor. However, radiotherapy and immunotherapy latest developments might upset this radiobiological dogma. Stereotactic radiotherapy allows high dose per fraction delivery, with high dose rate. More DNA lethal damages, less sublethal damages reparation, endothelial cell apoptosis, and finally clonogenic cell dysfunction are produced, resulting in improved local control. Radiotherapy can also enhance immune responses, inducing neoantigens formation, tumor antigen presentation, and cytokines release. A synergic effect of radiotherapy with immunotherapy is expected, and might lead to abscopal effects. If hadrontherapy biological properties seem able to suppress hypoxia-induced radioresistance and increase biological efficacy, ballistic advantages over photon radiations might also improve radiotherapy outcomes on usually poor prognosis locations. The present review addresses biological and clinical effects of high fraction dose, bystander effect, abscopal effect, and hadrontherapy features in melanoma. Clinical trials results are warranted to establish indications of innovative radiotherapy in melanoma.
Downstream of growth factor receptors and of the guanine triphosphatase (GTPase) RAS, heterodimers of the serine/threonine kinases BRAF and RAF1 are critical upstream kinases and activators of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) module containing the mitogen-activated and extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase (MEK) and their targets, the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) family. Either direct or scaffold protein-mediated interactions among the components of the ERK module (the MAPKKKs BRAF and RAF1, MEK, and ERK) facilitate signal transmission. RAF1 also has essential functions in the control of tumorigenesis and migration that are mediated through its interaction with the kinase ROKα, an effector of the GTPase RHO and regulator of cytoskeletal rearrangements. We combined mutational and kinetic analysis with mathematical modeling to show that the interaction of RAF1 with ROKα is coordinated with the role of RAF1 in the ERK pathway. We found that the phosphorylated form of RAF1 that interacted with and inhibited ROKα was generated during the interaction of RAF1 with the ERK module. This mechanism adds plasticity to the ERK pathway, enabling signal diversification at the level of both ERK and RAF. Furthermore, by connecting ERK activation with the regulation of ROKα and cytoskeletal rearrangements by RAF1, this mechanism has the potential to precisely coordinate the proper timing of proliferation with changes in cell shape, adhesion, or motility.
As a central element within the RAS/ERK pathway, the serine/threonine kinase BRAF plays a key role in development and homeostasis and represents the most frequently mutated kinase in tumors. Consequently, it has emerged as an important therapeutic target in various malignancies. Nevertheless, the BRAF activation cycle still raises many mechanistic questions as illustrated by the paradoxical action and side effects of RAF inhibitors. By applying SEC-PCP-SILAC, we analyzed protein-protein interactions of hyperactive BRAF(V)(600E) and wild-type BRAF (BRAF(WT)). We identified two macromolecular, cytosolic BRAF complexes of distinct molecular composition and phosphorylation status. Hyperactive BRAF(V)(600E) resides in large complexes of higher molecular mass and activity, while BRAF(WT) is confined to smaller, slightly less active complexes. However, expression of oncogenic K-Ras(G12V), either by itself or in combination with RAF dimer promoting inhibitors, induces the incorporation of BRAF(WT) into large, active complexes, whereas pharmacological inhibition of BRAF(V)(600E) has the opposite effect. Thus, the quaternary structure of BRAF complexes is shaped by its activation status, the conformation of its kinase domain, and clinically relevant inhibitors.
Chromosomal rearrangements involving the gene ROS1 define a distinct molecular subset of NSCLCs with sensitivity to ROS1 inhibitors. Recent reports have suggested a significant overlap between ROS1 fusions and other oncogenic driver alterations, including mutations in EGFR and KRAS.
We identified patients at our institution with ROS1-rearranged NSCLC who had undergone testing for genetic alterations in additional oncogenes, including EGFR, KRAS, and anaplastic lymphoma receptor tyrosine kinase gene (ALK). Clinicopathologic features and genetic testing results were reviewed. We also examined a separate database of ROS1-rearranged NSCLCs identified through the commercial FoundationOne assay (Foundation Medicine, Cambridge, MA).
Among 62 patients with ROS1-rearranged NSCLC evaluated at our institution, none harbored concurrent ALK fusions (0%) or EGFR activating mutations (0%). KRAS mutations were detected in two cases (3.2%), one of which harbored a concurrent noncanonical KRAS I24N mutation of unknown biological significance. In a separate ROS1 fluorescence in situ hybridization-positive case, targeted sequencing failed to confirm a ROS1 fusion but instead identified a KRAS G13D mutation. No concurrent mutations in B-Raf proto-oncogene, serine/threonine kinase gene (BRAF), erb-b2 receptor tyrosine kinase 2 gene (ERBB2), phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase catalytic subunit alpha gene (PIK3CA), AKT/serine threonine kinase 1 gene (AKT1), or mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 1 gene (MAP2K1) were detected. Analysis of an independent data set of 166 ROS1-rearranged NSCLCs identified by FoundationOne demonstrated rare cases with co-occurring driver mutations in EGFR (one of 166) and KRAS (three of 166) and no cases with co-occurring ROS1 and ALK rearrangements.
ROS1 rearrangements rarely overlap with alterations in EGFR, KRAS, ALK, or other targetable oncogenes in NSCLC.
Optimal treatments for vulvar and vaginal melanomas (VVMs) have not been identified. Herein, the authors compare molecular profiles between VVM and nongynecologic melanoma (NGM) subtypes with the objective of identifying novel, targetable biomarkers.
In total, 2304 samples of malignant melanoma that were submitted to Caris Life Sciences between 2009 and 2015 were reviewed. In situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry were used to assess copy numbers and protein expression of selected genes. Sequenced variants were analyzed using a proprietary cancer panel.
In total, 51 VVMs (14 vaginal and 37 vulvar melanomas) were compared with 2253 malignant NGMs, including 2127 cutaneous, 105 mucosal, and 21 acral melanomas. In VVMs, B-Raf proto-oncogene serine/threonine kinase (BRAF) was the most frequently mutated gene (26%) compared with 8.3% of mucosal NGMs (P = .008). In BRAF-mutated tumors, fewer VVMs (50%), compared with NGMs (82.1%), had a variant within the valine codon 600 (V600) domain. The KIT mutation rate was highest in VVMs (22%) compared with 3% in cutaneous (P &lt; .001) and 8.8% in mucosal (P = .05) melanoma subtypes. NRAS mutations were rare in VVMs compared with cutaneous (25.9%; P = .009) and acral (40.6%; P = .002) melanoma subtypes. PD-L1 (56%) and PD-1 (75%) were frequently expressed in VVM, whereas PI3KCA pathway mutations and estrogen receptor/progesterone receptor expression were rare. Compared with VVMs that had KIT mutations, wild-type KIT VVMs were more likely to express molecular markers suggestive of platinum resistance (ERCC1), alkylating sensitivity (MGMT), and anthracycline sensitivity (TOP2A).
The unique molecular features of VVM render this disease a distinct subtype of melanoma. Gene-based molecular therapy and immunotherapies may be promising and should be evaluated in clinical trials. Cancer 2016. © 2016 American Cancer Society.
The extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) is one of the principal hub proteins that transmit growth signals from upstream oncogene products including Ras and BRaf to downstream effector proteins. However, there are both reports supporting and refuting the increase in ERK activity in cancer tissues expressing the active Ras and BRaf proteins. We considered that the cell density might account for this discrepancy. To examine this possibility, we prepared Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells that expressed an active HRas, NRas, KRas, or BRaf and an ERK biosensor based on the principle of Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET). As we anticipated, expression of the active Ras or BRaf increased ERK activity at low cell densities. However, the ERK activity was markedly suppressed at high cell densities irrespective of the expression of the active Ras or BRaf. Western blotting analysis with Phos-tag gel revealed the decrease of tyrosine and threonine-diphosphorylated active ERK and the increase of tyrosine-monophosphorylated inactive ERK at high cell density. In addition, we found that calyculin A, an inhibitor for PPP-subfamily protein serine/threonine phosphatases, decreased the tyrosine-monophosphorylated ERK. Our study suggests that PPP-subfamily phosphatases may be responsible for cell density-dependent ERK dephosphorylation in cancer cells expressing active Ras or BRaf protein.
In the present study, the detection of tumor-specific KRAS proto-oncogene, GTPase (KRAS) and B-Raf proto-oncogene, serine/threonine kinase (BRAF) mutations in the peripheral blood of colorectal cancer (CRC) patients at all stages and adenomas was used for the estimation of disease stage prior to surgery and for residual disease following surgery. A total of 65 CRC patients were enrolled. The primary tumor tested positive for the specific mutations (KRAS mutations in codons 12, 13, 61, 117 or 146 and BRAF mutations in codon 600) in 35 patients. In all these patients, the specimen of normal bowel resected with the tumor was also tested for the presence of the same mutations in order to exclude the germ-line mutations. Only patients who tested positive for the specific mutation in the primary tumor were included in further analysis for the presence of tumor-specific mutation in the peripheral blood. No statistically significant differences were found between the detection rates of tumor mutations in the blood and different tumor stages (P=0.491). However, statistically significant differences in the proportions of patients with detected tumor-specific DNA mutations in the peripheral blood were found when comparing the groups of patients with R0 and R2 resections (P=0.038). Tumor-specific DNA mutations in the peripheral blood were more frequently detected in the patients with an incomplete surgical clearance of the tumor due to macroscopic residual disease (R2 resections). Therefore, the study concludes that the follow-up of somatic KRAS- and BRAF-mutated DNA in the peripheral blood of CRC patients may be useful in assessing the surgical clearance of the disease.
To report the diagnosis of acute VKH-like syndrome as a complication from dabrafenib (a serine/threonine inhibitor of BRAF V600) and trametinib (a MEK inhibitor). In combination, these targeted agents have been shown to prolong overall survival and progression free survival in BRAF mutant metastatic melanoma.
Retrospective medical chart review including radiologic and ophthalmologic investigations.
A patient with metastatic melanoma being treated with dabrafenib and trametinib for 2 months presented with 1 week of visual blurring. He had developed bilateral optic disc swelling and uveitis that responded to pulsed steroid therapy.
VKH-like syndrome is a rare but serious complication of targeted therapy that should be considered when evaluating a patient with visual disturbances on dabrafenib and trametinib therapy.
A retrospective observational study was conducted on patients diagnosed with serine/threonine-protein kinase B-Raf (BRAF)-mutated metastatic melanoma, who underwent first-line therapy with BRAF and mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK) inhibitors (vemurafenib, dabrafenib or a combination of dabrafenib and trametinib) at the Miguel Servet University Hospital (Zaragoza, Spain) between November, 2011 and August, 2015. The aim of this study was to analyse the toxicity produced by BRAF and MEK inhibitors. The most common toxicities were similar to those published in clinical trials, particularly arthralgia, alopecia and photosensitivity in the vemurafenib group; asthenia, hyperkeratosis and dry skin in the dabrafenib group; and diarrhoea and dry skin in the dabrafenib plus trametinib group. Toxicities that had not been described in clinical trials were also identified. Thus, the present study confirmed that the results obtained in clinical trials are similar to those obtained in clinical practice.
The acquisition of resistance to current mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) inhibitors in B-Raf proto-oncogene, serine/threonine kinase (BRAF) mutant melanoma is almost inevitable. Our recent findings identify therapy-induced mitochondrial biogenesis (MitoBiogenesis) and aberrant tumor bioenergetics as therapeutic escape mechanisms and offer a rational combinatorial strategy to further improve the efficacy of MAPK inhibitors.
Anal cancer is a rare type of digestive tract disease, which has had a crescent incidence in a number of regions. Carcinomas are most frequently found, with squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) comprising ~95% of all anal tumors. The major risk factor for development of this type of tumor is human papillomavirus (HPV) infection. However, previous studies have identified patients with anal cancer that are HPV‑/p16‑and observed that they have a poorer outcome compared with HPV+/p16+ patients. This suggests that molecular profile may drive anal cancer progression. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the mutational status of two important oncogenes, KRAS and BRAF, in a series of anal cancer lesions. Resected tumors of the anal canal (n=43) were evaluated, nine of these were high‑grade squamous intra‑epithelial lesion cases (HSIL), 11 were adenocarcinomas, and 23 SCCs. Direct sequencing of KRAS proto‑oncogene, GTPase (KRAS; codons 12 and 13) and B‑Raf proto‑oncogene, serine/threonine kinase (BRAF; codon 600) was performed and associated with patient clinicopathological and molecular features. There was a trend of poorer prognosis of adenocarcinoma compared with HSIL and SCC. Analysis indicated one SCC patient (2.3%) exhibited a KRAS p.G13D mutation, and one adenocarcinoma patient (2.3%) exhibited a BRAF p.V600E mutation. It was observed that, these mutations are rare in anal tumors, and certain patients may be at a disadvantage using targeted therapies based on KRAS and BRAF mutational status. As there is a low mutation percentage in SCCs, adenocarcinomas and HSIL, there may exist other underlying molecular alterations that result in anal cancer development, which require further elucidation.
The protein kinase B-Raf proto-oncogene, serine/threonine kinase (BRAF) is an oncogenic driver and therapeutic target in melanoma. Inhibitors of BRAF (BRAFi) have shown high response rates and extended survival in patients with melanoma who bear tumors that express mutations encoding BRAF proteins mutant at Val600, but a vast majority of these patients develop drug resistance. Here we show that loss of stromal antigen 2 (STAG2) or STAG3, which encode subunits of the cohesin complex, in melanoma cells results in resistance to BRAFi. We identified loss-of-function mutations in STAG2, as well as decreased expression of STAG2 or STAG3 proteins in several tumor samples from patients with acquired resistance to BRAFi and in BRAFi-resistant melanoma cell lines. Knockdown of STAG2 or STAG3 expression decreased sensitivity of BRAF(Val600Glu)-mutant melanoma cells and xenograft tumors to BRAFi. Loss of STAG2 inhibited CCCTC-binding-factor-mediated expression of dual specificity phosphatase 6 (DUSP6), leading to reactivation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling (via the MAPKs ERK1 and ERK2; hereafter referred to as ERK). Our studies unveil a previously unknown genetic mechanism of BRAFi resistance and provide new insights into the tumor suppressor function of STAG2 and STAG3.
The majority of patients with papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) have an excellent prognosis, but some show poorer outcomes and would benefit from adjunctive prognostic tools. The B-Raf proto-oncogene, serine/threonine kinase (BRAF) mutation, either based on both its presence or its quantitative measurement, and ultrasound (US) features may serve as a prognostic marker. The aim of this study was to investigate (1) the association between clinical-pathologic prognostic factors and the BRAF mutation found in fine-needle aspirates, based on both its presence and its corresponding cycle threshold (Ct) value, and (2) the association between prognostic factors and suspicious US features classified by the thyroid imaging reporting and data system (TIRADS) in PTC.Two-hundred fifty-eight consecutive patients with PTC &gt; 1 cm and who underwent preoperative US-guided fine-needle aspiration were included in this retrospective study. Clinical-pathologic variables were compared between patients with and without the BRAF mutation. Multivariate analyses were performed to investigate (1) the association between clinical-pathologic prognostic factors and the BRAF mutation found in fine-needle aspirates, based on both its presence and corresponding Ct values, and (2) the association between prognostic factors and suspicious TIRADS US features.BRAF-positive patients had a higher proportion of multiple tumors (P = 0.017). The number of suspicious US features classified by the TIRADS was an independent factor for predicting lateral lymph node metastasis, both in all 258 patients (odds ratio [OR] = 1.902, P = 0.005) and in 214 BRAF-positive patients (OR = 1.686, P = 0.037). The BRAF mutation status or BRAFCt values were not associated with any of the clinical-pathologic prognostic factors.In conclusion, a higher number of suspicious US features classified by the TIRADS, but not the BRAF mutation, are associated with lateral lymph node metastasis in patients with PTC, and can aid in the preoperative identification of patients at increased risk of lateral lymph node metastasis.
Serrated polyposis (SPP) is characterized by the development of multiple serrated polyps and an increased predisposition to colorectal cancer (CRC). In the present study, we aimed to characterize, at a clinical and molecular level, a cohort of SPP patients with or without a family history of SPP and/or polyps/CRC (SPP-FHP/CRC). Sixty-two lesions from 12 patients with SPP-FHP/CRC and 6 patients with sporadic SPP were included. The patients with SPP-FHP/CRC presented with an older mean age at diagnosis (p=0.027) and a more heterogeneous histological pattern of lesions (p=0.032) than the patients with sporadic SPP. We identified two molecular forms of SPP-FHP/CRC, according to the preferential location of the lesions: proximal/whole-colon or distal colon. Mismatch repair (MMR) gene methylation [mutS homolog 6 (MSH6)/mutS homolog 3 (MSH3)] or loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of D2S123 (flanking MSH6) were detected exclusively in the former (p=3.0x10-7), in most early lesions. Proximal/whole‑colon SPP-FHP/CRC presented a higher frequency of O-6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) methylation/LOH, microsatellite instability (MSI) and Wnt mutations (19/29 vs. 7/17; 16/23 vs. 1/14, p=2.2x10-4; 15/26 vs. 2/15, p=0.006; 14/26 vs. 4/20, p=0.02) but a lower frequency of B-raf proto-oncogene, serine/threonine kinase (BRAF) mutations (7/30 vs. 12/20, p=0.0089) than the distal form. CRC was more frequent in cases of Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (KRAS)-associated proximal/whole-colon SPP-FHP/CRC than in the remaining cases (4/4 vs. 1/8, p=0.01). Thus, SPP-FHP/CRC appears to be a specific entity, presenting two forms, proximal/whole-colon and distal, which differ in the underlying tumor initiation pathways. Early MGMT and MMR gene deficiency in the former may underlie an inherited susceptibility to genotoxic stress.
The therapeutic response to vemurafenib, a BRAF serine-threonine kinase inhibitor, exhibits large variations between patients. Evaluation of factors predicting the clinical efficacy of vemurafenib may help to identify patients at high risk of non-response in the early phase of treatment. The aim of this study was to analyze the pharmacokinetics of vemurafenib by a population approach and to evaluate the relationship between plasma drug exposure and pre-treatment plasma hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) levels with clinical effects (progression-free survival (PFS), peripheral lymphocytes depletion) in patients with metastatic BRAF(V600) mutated melanoma treated with single agent vemurafenib. Concentration-time data (n=332) obtained in 44 patients were analyzed using the NONMEM program. Pre-treatment plasma levels of HGF (n=36) were assayed by ELISA method. A Cox model was used to identify prognostic factors associated with progression-free survival (PFS), and a linear regression to identify factors contributing to the depletion of peripheral lymphocytes at day 15. Steady-state pharmacokinetics of vemurafenib was described by a one compartment model with first order absorption and first order elimination. None of the tested covariates explained the inter-patient variability in CL/F. A significant decrease in total lymphocytes count was observed within the first 15days (median ratio Day15/Day0=0.66, p&lt;0.0001). Patients with Day15/Day0 ratio below 0.66 had longer PFS (14 vs 4 months, HR=0.41, CI95%=[0.15-0.77], p=0.0095). In the multivariate Cox model analysis, ECOG PS was the only parameter independently associated with PFS (grade 1 vs 0, HR=3.26, CI95%=[1.29-8.22], p=0.01 and grade ≥2 vs 0, HR=4.77, CI95%=[1.52-14.95], p=0.007). Plasma vemurafenib exposure (p=0.046) and pre-treatment HGF levels (p=0.003) were independently associated with the total lymphocyte ratio Day15/Day0. These findings show that plasma vemurafenib exposure and pre-treatment HGF levels are two factors contributing to the early peripheral lymphocytes depletion which itself is associated with PFS.
The serine/threonine-protein kinase B-Raf (BRAF) V600E mutant (BRAF(V600E)) inhibitor vemurafenib, has improved clinical outcomes for patients with BRAF(V600E) melanoma, but acquired cellular resistance mediated by AKT serine/threonine kinase 1 (AKT) phosphorylation limits its efficacy. We examined the effect of resveratrol on vemurafenib-resistant melanoma cells.
A vemurafenib-resistant human metastatic melanoma cell line positive for the BRAF V600E mutation was established. The anti-tumorigenic effects of vemurafenib and resveratrol, both alone and in combination, were examined through analysis of cell proliferation and protein expression.
The level of phosphorylated AKT (p-AKT) was increased in the primary melanoma cells after treatment with vemurafenib, and the basal level of p-AKT was increased in vemurafenib-resistant melanoma cells. Notably, resveratrol both alone and in combination with vemurafenib effectively suppressed cell proliferation and AKT phosphorylation in both parental and vemurafenib-resistant melanoma cells.
Vemurafenib resistance can be reversed by addition of resveratrol in patients undergoing treatment with BRAF inhibitors.
The BRAF proto-oncogene serine/threonine-protein kinase, known as BRAF, belongs to the RAF kinase family. It regulates the MAPK/ERK signalling pathway affecting several cellular processes such as growth, survival, differentiation, and cellular transformation. BRAF is mutated in ~8% of all human cancers with the V600E mutation constituting ~90% of mutations. Here, we have used quantitative mass spectrometry to map and compare phosphorylation site patterns between BRAF and BRAF V600E. We identified sites that are shared as well as several quantitative differences in phosphorylation abundance. The highest difference is phosphorylation of S614 in the activation loop which is ~5fold enhanced in BRAF V600E. Mutation of S614 increases the kinase activity of both BRAF and BRAF V600E and the transforming ability of BRAF V600E. The phosphorylation of S614 is mitogen inducible and the result of autophosphorylation. These data suggest that phosphorylation at this site is inhibitory, and part of the physiological shut-down mechanism of BRAF signalling.
In oncology, positron emission tomography imaging using dedicated tracers as biomarkers may assist in early evaluation of therapy efficacy. Using 3'-deoxy-3'-[(18)F]fluorothymidine ([(18)F]FLT), we investigated the early effects of chemotherapeutic treatment on cancer cell proliferation in a BRAF-mutated colorectal cancer xenograft model.
Colo205 subcutaneously inoculated animals underwent 90-min dynamic imaging before and 24 h after treatment with vehicle (control), cetuximab (resistant) or irinotecan (sensitive). Total distribution volume was quantified from dynamic data, and standardized uptake values as well as tumor-to-blood ratios were calculated from static images averaged over the last 20 min. In vivo imaging data was correlated with ex vivo proliferation and thymidine metabolism proteins.
All imaging parameters showed a significant post-treatment decrease from [(18)F]FLT baseline uptake for the irinotecan group (p ≤ 0.001) as compared with the cetuximab and vehicle group and correlated strongly with each other (p ≤ 0.0001). In vivo data were in agreement with Ki67 staining, showing a significantly lower percentage of Ki67-positive cells in the irinotecan group as compared with other groups (p ≤ 0.0001). Tumor expression of thymidine kinase 1 phosphorylated on serine 13, thymidylate synthase, and thymidine phosphorylase remained unaffected, while thymidine kinase 1 expression was, surprisingly, significantly higher in irinotecan-treated animals (p ≤ 0.01). In contrast, tumor ATP levels were lowest in this group.
[(18)F]FLT positron emission tomography was found to be a suitable biomarker of early tumor response to anti-proliferative treatment, with static imaging not being inferior to full compartmental analysis in our xenograft model. The dynamics of thymidine kinase 1 protein expression and protein activity in low ATP environments merits further investigation.
This study attempts to determine whether primary tumor tissue could reliably represent metastatic colorectal cancer in therapy-guiding analysis of mitochondrial microsatellite instability. Therefore, we investigated the concordance of microsatellite instability in D310, D514, and D16184 (mitochondrial DNA displacement loop), and its association with selected clinical categories and KRAS/NRAS/BRAF/PIK3CA/TP53 mutation status between primary and metastatic colorectal cancer tissue from 119 patients. Displacement loop microsatellite instability was significantly more frequently seen in lymph node metastases (53.1%) compared to primary tumors (37.5%) and distant metastases (21.4%) ( p = 0.0183 and p = 0.0005). The discordant rate was significantly higher in lymph node metastases/primary tumor pairs (74.6%) than in distant metastases/primary tumor pairs (52.4%) or lymph node metastases/distant metastases pairs (51.6%) ( p = 0.0113 and p = 0.0261) with more gain (86.7%) than loss (61.1%) of microsatellite instability in the discordant lymph node metastases ( p = 0.0024). Displacement loop instability occurred significantly more frequently in lymph node metastases and distant metastases of patients with early colorectal cancer onset age &lt;60 years ( p = 0.0122 and p = 0.0129), was found with a significant high rate in a small cohort of TP53-mutated distant metastases ( p = 0.0418), and was associated with TP53 wild-type status of primary tumors ( p = 0.0009), but did not correlate with KRAS, NRAS, BRAF, or PIK3CA mutations. In conclusion, mitochondrial microsatellite instability and its association with selected clinical and molecular markers are discordant in primary and metastatic colorectal cancer, which could have importance for surveillance and therapeutic strategies.
Several side effects have been reported during treatment with vemurafenib, including multiple benign lesions and, less frequently, atypical melanocytic proliferations and second primary melanomas.
A 46-year-old man undergoing vemurafenib therapy for metastatic malignant melanoma was clinically and dermoscopically monitored using total-body mapping.
During BRAF inhibitor (BRAFi) treatment, the patient developed atypical melanocytic lesions and particularly secondary primary melanoma.
Secondary melanomas are usually diagnosed during the early disease stage, and no case of advanced melanomas is reported in the literature, mostly due to careful surveillance in BRAFi-treated patients.
Over the last two decades, cancer-related alterations in DNA methylation that regulate transcription have been reported for a variety of tumors of the gastrointestinal tract. Due to its relevance for translational research, great emphasis has been placed on the analysis and molecular characterization of the CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP), defined as widespread hypermethylation of CpG islands in clinically distinct subsets of cancer patients. Here, we present an overview of previous work in this field and also explore some open questions using cross-platform data for esophageal, gastric, and colorectal adenocarcinomas from The Cancer Genome Atlas. We provide a data-driven, pan-gastrointestinal stratification of individual samples based on CIMP status and we investigate correlations with oncogenic alterations, including somatic mutations and epigenetic silencing of tumor suppressor genes. Besides known events in CIMP such as BRAF V600E mutation, CDKN2A silencing or MLH1 inactivation, we discuss the potential role of emerging actors such as Wnt pathway deregulation through truncating mutations in RNF43 and epigenetic silencing of WIF1. Our results highlight the existence of molecular similarities that are superimposed over a larger backbone of tissue-specific features and can be exploited to reduce heterogeneity of response in clinical trials.
Cancer of unknown primary site is still a demanding condition as it is per definition metastatic, with heterogeneous biological behavior, and it is often resistant to therapy. Cancer of unknown primary site accounts for approximately 1 to 5 % of all cancers, but is currently among the top six causes of cancer deaths in Western countries. To correctly identify the biological origin of the tumor, a large spectrum of differential diagnoses must be considered and scrutinized. At progression, re-biopsy might be necessary to reveal the true origin of the tumor or actionable targets.
A 62-year-old Norwegian woman, with a fast growing lump in her left groin, was primarily diagnosed as having undifferentiated carcinoma that was BRAF V600 positive. There was complete response with paclitaxel-carboplatin and she was recurrence-free for 18 months. She had recurrence in both lungs and subcutaneously in her left groin and thigh; a re-biopsy revealed transformation to a malignant melanoma. She was resistant to BRAF inhibitors, then treated with ipilimumab and is currently a long-term survivor of 4 years and 4 months since the first diagnosis, with no clinical or radiological evidence of recurrence.
A biopsy from patients with metastasis of unknown primary should be analyzed thoroughly to identify organ of origin, molecular make-up, and possible molecular targets. Re-biopsy of cancer of unknown primary site at progression can reveal the true cellular origin of the tumor as well as provide novel therapeutic opportunities, including immunotherapy.
Treating advanced or recurrent melanoma remains a challenge. Cancer cells can evade the immune system by blocking T-cell activation via overexpression of the inhibitory receptor programmed death 1 (PD-1) ligands. The PD-1 inhibitor nivolumab blocks the inhibitory signal in T cells, thus overcoming the immune resistance of cancer cells. Nivolumab has demonstrated promising anti-cancer activity in various cancers. We conducted a single-arm, open-label, multicenter, phase II study to investigate the efficacy and safety of nivolumab in previously untreated Japanese patients with advanced melanoma. Twenty-four patients with stage III/IV or recurrent melanoma were enrolled and received intravenous nivolumab 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The primary endpoint was overall response rate evaluated by an independent radiology review committee. The independent radiology review committee-assessed overall response rate was 34.8% (90% confidence interval [CI]: 20.8, 51.9), and the overall survival rate at 18 months was 56.5% (90% CI: 38.0, 71.4). Treatment-related adverse events (AEs) of grade 3 or 4 only occurred in three patients (12.5%). Two patients discontinued nivolumab because of AEs, but all AEs were considered manageable by early diagnosis and appropriate treatment. Subgroup analyses showed that nivolumab was clinically beneficial and tolerable regardless of BRAF genotype and that patients with treatment-related select AEs and with vitiligo showed tendency for better survival. In conclusion, nivolumab demonstrated favorable efficacy and safety profiles in Japanese patients with advanced or recurrent melanoma, with or without BRAF mutations.

Recent advances in targeted anticancer therapies have substantially improved the prognosis of several cancers. Such targeted therapies are not, however, free of side effects, and these side effects are clearly distinct from those induced by classical cytotoxic chemotherapies. This is likely so because targeted therapies are designed to interfere with specific oncogenic signaling pathways rather than to inhibit cell proliferation in general. In fact, interference with specific signaling pathways may lead to effects that mimic those associated with genetic disorders due to alterations in the corresponding signaling pathways. Here, we compare the clinical effects of treatment with BRAF inhibitors with those of genetic RASopathies and find a striking overlap between the inhibitor-induced, iatrogenic dermatoses with the genodermatoses seen in patients with corresponding congenital RASopathies. We hope that such comparisons lead to a better understanding of the side effects of targeted therapies.
Myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) are clonal hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) disorders that can be classified on the basis of genetic, clinical, phenotypic features. Genetic lesions such as JAK2 mutations and BCR-ABL translocation are often mutually exclusive in MPN patients and lead to essential thrombocythemia, polycythemia vera or myelofibrosis (ET/PV/MF) or chronic myeloid leukemia, respectively. Nevertheless, coexistence of these genetic aberrations in the same patient has been reported. Whether these aberrations occur in the same stem cell or a different cell is unclear, but an unstable genome in the HSCs seems to be the common antecedent. In an effort to characterize the underlying genetic events that might contribute to the appearance of more than one MPN in a patient, we studied neoplastic cells from patients with dual MPNs by next-generation sequencing. We observed that most patients with two MPNs harbored mutations in genes known to contribute to clonal hematopoiesis through altered epigenetic regulation such as TET2, ASXL1/2, SRSF2, and IDH2 at varying frequencies (1-47%). In addition, we found that some patients also harbored oncogenic mutations in N/KRAS, TP53, BRAF, EZH2, GNAS at low frequencies, which probably represent clonal evolution. These findings support the hypothesis that hematopoietic cells from MPN patients harbor multiple genetic aberrations, some of which can contribute to clonal dominance. Acquiring mutations in JAK2/CALR/MPL or the BCR-ABL translocation probably drive the oncogenic phenotype towards a specific MPN. Further, we propose that the acquisition of BCR-ABL in these patients is frequently a secondary event resulting from an unstable genome. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
An increased risk of small bowel carcinoma (SBC) has been reported in coeliac disease (CD) and Crohn's disease (CrD). We explored clinico-pathologic, molecular and prognostic features of CD-associated SBC (CD-SBC) and CrD-associated SBC (CrD-SBC) in comparison with sporadic SBC (spo-SBC).
Seventy-six patients undergoing surgical resection for non-familial SBC (26 CD-SBC, 25 CrD-SBC, 25 spo-SBC) were retrospectively enrolled to investigate patients' survival and histological and molecular features including microsatellite instability (MSI) and KRAS/NRAS, BRAF, PIK3CA, TP53, HER2 gene alterations.
CD-SBC showed a significantly better sex-, age- and stage-adjusted overall and cancer-specific survival than CrD-SBC, while no significant difference was found between spo-SBC and either CD-SBC or CrD-SBC. CD-SBC exhibited a significantly higher rate of MSI and median tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) than CrD-SBC and spo-SBC. Among the whole SBC series, both MSI -which was the result of MLH1 promoter methylation in all but one cases- and high TIL density were associated with improved survival at univariable and stage-inclusive multivariable analysis. However, only TILs retained prognostic power when clinical subgroups were added to the multivariable model. KRAS mutation and HER2 amplification were detected in 30% and 7% of cases respectively, without prognostic implications.
In comparison with CrD-SBC, CD-SBC patients harbor MSI and high TILs more frequently and show better outcome. This seems mainly due to their higher TIL density, which at multivariable analysis showed an independent prognostic value. MSI/TIL status, KRAS mutations and HER2 amplification might help in stratifying patients for targeted anti-cancer therapy.
We aimed to detect the effects of miR-145-5p on the cell proliferation, apoptosis, migration, and invasion in NRAS-mutant, BRAF-mutant, and wild-type melanoma cells, in order to figure out the potential mechanisms and provide a novel therapeutic target of melanoma. RT-qPCR and western blot were used to detect the expression of miR-145-5p and NRAS in melanoma tumor tissues and cells, respectively. Luciferase assay was performed to determine whether miR-145-5p directly targeted NRAS. After transfecting miR-145-5p mimics, miR-145-5p inhibitors, NRAS cDNA and NRAS siRNA into CHL-1, VMM917 and SK-mel-28 cells, functional assays were used to detect the proliferation, apoptosis, invasion and migration, including MTT, flow cytometry, Transwell and wound healing assays. In addition, xenograft models in nude mice were also conducted to verify the role of miR-145-5p in vivo. MiR-145-5p was able to suppress proliferation, invasion, and migration of VMM917 and CHL-1 cells and induce apoptosis by inhibiting MAPK and PI3K/AKT pathways. However, aberrant expression of miR-145-5p and NRAS has little impact on the viability and metastasis of BRAF-mutant melanoma. The higher expression of miR-145-5p in xenograft models repressed the VMM917-induced and CHL-1-induced tumor growth observably and has little effect on SK-mel-28-induced tumor growth which was consistent with the results in vitro. Through targeting NRAS, miR-145-5p could suppress cell proliferation, invasion, and migration and induce apoptosis of CHL-1 and VMM917 melanoma cells by inhibiting MAPK and PI3K/AKT pathways.
BRAF mutations using cellular DNA from fine-needle aspiration (FNA) specimens are commonly used to support the diagnosis of papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC). The goal of this study was to preliminarily evaluate the diagnostic utility of detecting BRAF mutations in the routinely discarded FNA specimen supernatant fluid.
Seventy-eight FNAs of thyroid lesions were evaluated for BRAF mutations using both cellular and supernatant DNA. BRAF mutation data were correlated with cytology and surgical pathology.
Of the 78 samples evaluated, 68 (87%) had amplifiable DNA in the supernatant with 2 (3%) positive for BRAF mutations. These two samples showed no mutations in the cellular counterpart. Among the 11 samples showing morphologic findings (FNA/surgical pathology) suspicious/diagnostic of PTC, 6 (55%) samples (one supernatant and five cellulars) were positive for BRAF mutations. This suggests that testing supernatant DNA in FNA specimens may increase the diagnostic yield by 1/11 (9%) in this setting.
The vast majority of routinely discarded FNA supernatants contain amplifiable DNA. In addition, profiling the mutations of BRAF and other genes using supernatant DNA may provide valuable diagnostic information to assist the diagnosis of PTC in patients with clinical/morphologic findings suspicious for malignancies and cellular DNA showing no mutations.
We assessed the associations between FDG uptake in primary papillary thyroid carcinomas (PTCs) and clinicopathological features, including the BRAF V600E mutation, using quantitative and qualitative analyses of preoperative PET/CT data.
This was a retrospective review of 106 patients with PTC who underwent PET/CT scans between February 2009 and January 2011 before undergoing total thyroidectomy. Data collected from surgical specimens were compared with FDG uptake in the primary tumor using quantitative and qualitative analyses of preoperative PET/CT data. Clinicopathological data included the primary tumor size, subtype, capsular invasion, extrathyroid extension, multifocality, BRAF V600E mutation status, lymph node metastasis, and distant metastasis.
The SUVmax of the primary tumor was significantly higher in patients with a primary tumor &gt;1 cm, extrathyroid extension, or the BRAF V600E mutation than in patients without these features (P&lt;0.001, 0.049, and &lt;0.001). Univariate analyses showed that primary tumor size, extrathyroid extension, and BRAF V600E mutation status were associated with the SUVmax of the PTC. Multivariate analysis indicated that primary tumor size and the BRAF V600E mutation were associated with the SUVmax of the PTC. In a visual assessment, the primary tumor size was larger in FDG-avid than in non-FDG-avid PTCs (P&lt;0.001). There was no significant difference in the presence of multifocality, thyroid capsular invasion, extrathyroid extension, BRAF V600E mutation, lymph node metastasis, or distant metastasis between FDG-avid and non-FDG-avid PTCs.
Primary tumor size and the BRAF V600E mutation are significant factors associated with the SUVmax on preoperative PET/CT in patients with PTC. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.

Observational studies suggest that higher levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D 3 (25(OH)D) are associated with a reduced risk of colorectal cancer and improved survival of colorectal cancer patients. However, the influence of vitamin D status on cancer recurrence and survival of patients with stage III colon cancer is unknown.

We prospectively examined the influence of post-diagnosis predicted plasma 25(OH)D on outcome among 1,016 patients with stage III colon cancer who were enrolled in a National Cancer Institute-sponsored adjuvant therapy trial (CALGB 89803). Predicted 25(OH)D scores were computed using validated regression models. We examined the influence of predicted 25(OH)D scores on cancer recurrence and mortality (disease-free survival; DFS) using Cox proportional hazards.

Patients in the highest quintile of predicted 25(OH)D score had an adjusted hazard ratio (HR) for colon cancer recurrence or mortality (DFS) of 0.62 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.44 to 0.86), compared with those in the lowest quintile ( P trend = 0.005). Higher predicted 25(OH)D score was also associated with a significant improvement in recurrence-free survival and overall survival ( P trend = 0.01 and 0.0004, respectively). The benefit associated with higher predicted 25(OH)D score appeared consistent across predictors of cancer outcome and strata of molecular tumor characteristics, including microsatellite instability and KRAS, BRAF, PIK3CA, and TP53 mutation status.

Higher predicted 25(OH)D levels after a diagnosis of stage III colon cancer may be associated with decreased recurrence and improved survival. Clinical trials assessing the benefit of vitamin D supplementation in the adjuvant setting are warranted.

Clinical and pathologic features of patients with WTX-mutated Wilms tumor (WT) have not been studied in detail. We characterize the clinical and pathologic findings in WT with WTX abnormalities and provide comparison with WT without WTX mutation. Clinical, gross, and microscopic features in 35 patients with WT were examined. Karyotype was examined in a subset of cases. All cases had been previously analyzed for WTX, WT1, and CTNNB1 aberrations via array comparative genomic hybridization; OncoMap 4 high throughput genotyping was performed on 18 cases. Eleven tumors had WTX abnormality. No significant differences were identified between patients with mutated versus nonmutated WTX with respect to gender (45% versus 33% male), age (mean 3.9 versus 4.1 years), tumor size (mean 12.7 cm versus 12.8 cm), anaplasia (9% versus 12%), rhabdomyoblastic differentiation (18% versus 8%), cartilage differentiation (9% versus 4%), mucinous epithelial differentiation (9% versus 4%), nephrogenic rests (28% versus 21%), or relapse rate (11% versus 25%). Mutations in KRAS, MYC, and PIK3R1 were restricted to WTX-mutated WT, mutations in AKT, CKDN2A, EFGR, HRAS, MET, and RET were restricted to WT without WTX mutation, and mutations in BRAF, CTTNB1, NRAS, PDGFRA, and STK11 were seen in both groups. Our study revealed no clinical or pathologic distinctions between WT with and without WTX abnormality. This similarity lends support to the concept of a common tumorigenic pathway between WT with aberrant WTX and those without.
Molecular genetic analysis of KRAS, NRAS, and BRAF genes was carried out in order to develop an optimal algorithm for detection of minor mutations. We analyzed 35 melanoma and 33 colorectal cancer specimens. Frequent G12D/V/A/C/S mutations were detected in KRAS. The most frequent BRAF mutation in melanoma was V600E, the percentage of rare mutations is significant for DNA diagnosis (24%). Identification of rare BRAF mutations 1790C→G (L597R), 1798_1799delinsAA (V600K), 1798_1799delinsAG (V600R), and 1799_1800delinsAA (V600E) and NRAS mutation 38G→T (G13V) was possible only by Sanger sequencing. The combination of real-time PCR and sequencing can improve analysis sensitivity and ensure concordance of the tested loci with the international recommendations.
Cancers are the group of diseases, which arise because of the uncontrolled behavior of some of the genes in our cells. There are possibilities of gene amplifications, overexpressions, deletions and other anomalies which might lead to the development and spread of cancer. One of the most dangerous ways to the cancers is the mutations of the genes. The mutated genes can start unstoppable proliferation of cells, their uncontrolled motility, protection from apoptosis, the DNA mutation enhancement as well as other anomalies, leading to the cancer. This review focuses on the genes, which are frequently mutated in various cancers and are known to be important in the advance and progression of colorectal cancer and melanoma, namely KRAS, NRAS and BRAF.
The mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) mediate intracellular signals activated by a wide variety of extracellular stimuli. The activation of the RAS-RAF-MEK-MAPK cascade culminates in the regulation of gene transcription promoting cancer cell proliferation, survival, migration and angiogenesis. MEK (mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase-MAPKK) 1/2 is a transducer of the growth factor receptor-RAS-RAF-MAPK signalling cascade and plays a relevant role in development and progression of human cancers, such as colorectal cancer (CRC), non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Direct inhibition of MEK is a promising strategy and several inhibitors are currently under evaluation in clinical trials showing initial clinical activity in different tumours. MEK activation, by different genetic mechanisms, has been described for both intrinsic and acquired resistance to drugs targeting the EGFR (Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor)-RAS-RAF pathway in CRC, NSCLC. Combination therapies with chemotherapy and/or with molecular targeted agents are warranted and biomarkers studies are needed to identify those tumours dependent on MEK signalling.
Mucosal melanomas represent a rare entity with different risk factors and molecular features compared to cutaneous melanomas. They arise most commonly from mucosal surfaces in the head/neck region, the female genital tract (FGT) and the anorectal region. The aim of this study was to evaluate clinics, prognosis, and treatment options of patients with mucosal melanoma, in particular with regard to different primary sites.We retrospectively analyzed 75 patients with mucosal melanomas diagnosed in the years 1993 to 2015 in our department. The primary melanomas were located in the head/neck region (n = 32), the FGT (n = 24), and the anorectal region (n = 19).The median age of the patients was 66 years. At initial diagnosis the primary melanoma was not completely resectable in 11 (15%) patients, 18 (24%) patients had regional lymph node metastases, and 7 (9%) patients distant metastases. During follow-up, 22 (29%) patients suffered from a local recurrence, in particular patients with primary melanoma in the head/neck region without postoperative radiotherapy. By multivariate analysis location of the primary melanoma in the head/neck area or anorectal region and presence of metastases at time of diagnosis represented poor prognostic factors for recurrence-free survival. In 62 tested individuals 7 KIT mutations were found, 2 BRAF mutations in 57 tested patients. Four patients received targeted therapies, 14 checkpoint inhibitors, 4 (1/1 on vemurafenib, 1/7 on ipilimumab, and 2/7 on PD-1 inhibitors) patients showed responses of more than 100 days duration.Mucosal melanomas are often locally advanced or metastatic at initial diagnosis, thus they require extensive staging procedures. The high rate of local recurrences in the head/neck region can be significantly reduced by postoperative radiotherapy. For the potential use of medical treatment a mutation analysis for KIT and BRAF genes should be performed. The use of new immunologic and targeted therapies has to be further evaluated.
Raf-mitogen-activated protein kinase (Raf-MAPK) pathway inhibition with the BRAF inhibitors vemurafenib and dabrafenib, alone or in combination with a MEK inhibitor, has become a standard therapeutic approach in patients with BRAF-mutated metastatic melanoma. Both vemurafenib and dabrafenib have shown good safety and efficacy as monotherapy compared with chemotherapy. However, the duration of response is limited in the majority of patients treated with BRAF inhibitor monotherapy because of the development of acquired resistance. The addition of a MEK inhibitor can improve blockade of the MAPK pathway and may help to overcome resistance and thereby prolong efficacy, as well as reduce cutaneous toxicity. Combinations of BRAF inhibitors and MEK inhibitors (dabrafenib plus trametinib and vemurafenib plus cobimetinib) have been approved for the treatment of BRAF-mutant metastatic melanoma and may become a new standard of care. However, acquired resistance is still a significant concern with BRAF and MEK inhibitor combination therapy, and other strategies are being investigated, including the use of sequential and intermittent schedules. The combination of BRAF or MEK inhibitors with immunotherapy has been shown to hold considerable promise, with several combinations being evaluated in clinical trials. Preliminary results from clinical trials involving triple combination therapy with BRAF-MEK inhibitors and anti-PD-L1 antibodies appear promising and may indicate a new strategy to treat patients with BRAF-mutated metastatic melanoma. Biomarkers are needed to help identify patients with BRAFV600 mutations most likely to benefit from first-line BRAF/MEK inhibitor therapy rather than immunotherapy and vice versa.
Cardio-facio-cutaneous (CFC) syndrome is characterized by a variable degree of developmental delay and congenital anomalies, including characteristic facial, cardiac, and ectodermal abnormalities. It is caused by activating mutations in the Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway. In, however, approximately 10%-30% of individuals with a clinical diagnosis of CFCS, no mutation of the causative gene is found. Therefore, clinical studies in patients with the CFCS spectrum are valuable. To investigate the phenotypic spectrum and molecular diversity of germline mutations affecting genes encoding serine/threonine kinases, a group of 15 children and young adults with a diagnosis of CFCS was screened. We documented three novel mutations in the BRAF gene and correlated clinical findings with causative mutations in the BRAF or MEK1/MEK2 genes.
Noonan syndrome with multiple giant cell lesions (NS/MGCL) was recently shown to be a phenotypic variation within the syndromes of the Ras/MAPK pathway and not an independent entity as previously thought. Here we report on a 13-year-old boy with a typical phenotype of NS including atrial septal defect, pulmonic stenosis, short stature, and combined pectus carinatum/excavatum, pronounced MGCL of both jaws, and a de novo mutation in PTPN11, c.236A&gt;G (which predicts p.Q79R). Mutations in PTPN11 are the most frequent cause of NS and p.Q79R is a recurrent mutation in exon 3. Including this patient, 24 patients with molecularly confirmed NS, LEOPARD, or CFC/MGCL syndrome have been reported to date, of these 21 patients have PTPN11, SOS1, or RAF1 mutations and three have BRAF or MAP2K1 mutations, confirming that MGCL is a rare complication of the deregulated RAS/MAPK pathway. In all patients, the lesions of the mandible and to a lesser extent of the maxilla were first noted between ages 2 and 19 years (median 11 years), and were combined with enlargement of the jaws in 11/24 patients (46%). In this case and, with one exception (mutation not reported), all previous cases the NS/MGCL was caused by known mutations in the PTPN11, SOS1, RAF1, BRAF1, and MAP2K1 genes that were previously reported with RASopathies without MGCL.
Recent molecular characterization of colorectal tumors has identified several molecular alterations of interest that are considered targetable in metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC).
We conducted a single-institution, retrospective study based on comprehensive genomic profiling of tumors from 138 patients with mCRC using next-generation sequencing (NGS) via FoundationOne.
Overall, RAS mutations were present in 51.4% and RAF mutations were seen in 7.2% of mCRC patients. We found a novel KRASR68S1 mutation associated with an aggressive phenotype. RAS amplifications (1.4% KRAS and 0.7% NRAS), MET amplifications (2.2%), BRAFL597Ralterations (0.7%), ARAFS214F alterations (0.7%), and concurrent RAS+RAF (1.4%), BRAF+RAF1 (0.7%), and rare PTEN-PIK3CA-AKT pathway mutations were identified and predominantly associated with poor prognosis. ERBB2 (HER2) amplified tumors were identified in 5.1% and all arose from the rectosigmoid colon. Three cases (2.2%) were associated with a hypermutated profile that was corroborated with findings of high tumor mutational burden (TMB): 2 cases with MSI-H and 1 case with a POLE mutation.
Comprehensive genomic profiling can uncover alterations beyond the well-characterized RAS/RAF mutations associated with anti-EGFR resistance. ERBB2 amplified tumors commonly originate from the rectosigmoid colon, are predominantly RAS/BRAF wild-type, and may predict benefit to HER2-directed therapy. Hypermutant tumors or tumors with high TMB correlate with MSI-H status or POLE mutations and may predict a benefit from anti-PD-1 therapy.
Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common malignancies worldwide. Recently, a novel circular RNA, ciRS-7, was proposed to be a potential miR-7 sponge. Since miR-7 regulates the expression of several important drivers of CRC, we analyzed the clinical significance of ciRS-7 in CRC patients.
Initially, we evaluated the expression levels of ciRS-7 in a training cohort comprising of 153 primary CRC tissues and 44 matched normal mucosae. We subsequently confirmed its clinical relevance in an independent validation cohort (n=165), and evaluated the effect of ciRS-7 on miR-7, and its targets genes EGFR and RAF1. Functional analysis were performed in cell lines and an animal model to support clinical findings.
Our data revealed that ciRS-7 was significantly up-regulated in CRC tissues compared with matched normal mucosae (P=0.0018), and its overexpression was associated with poor patient survival (P=0.0224 and 0.0061 in the training and validation cohorts, respectively). Multivariate survival analysis revealed that ciRS-7 emerged as an independent risk factor for overall survival (P=0.0656 and 0.0324 in the training and validation cohorts, respectively). Overexpression of ciRS-7 in HCT116 and HT29 cells led to blocking of tumor suppressive effects of miR-7 and resulted in a more aggressive oncogenic phenotype, and ciRS-7 overexpression permitted inhibition of miR-7 and subsequent activation of EGFR and RAF1 oncogenes.
CiRS-7 is a promising prognostic biomarker in CRC patients and may serve as a therapeutic target for reducing EGFR-RAF1 activity in CRC patients.
Costello syndrome (CS) is caused by heterozygous germline HRAS mutations. Most patients share the HRAS mutation c.34G&gt;A (p.Gly12Ser) associated with the typical, relatively homogeneous phenotype. Rarer mutations occurred in individuals with an attenuated phenotype. Though many disease-associated HRAS alterations trigger constitutive activation of HRAS-dependent signalling pathways, additional pathological consequences exist. An infant with failure-to-thrive and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy had a novel de novo HRAS mutation (c.179G&gt;T; p.Gly60Val). He showed subtle dysmorphic findings consistent with attenuated CS and died from presumed cardiac cause. Functional studies revealed that amino acid change p.Gly60Val impairs HRAS binding to effectors PIK3CA, PLCE1, and RALGDS. In contrast, interaction with effector RAF1 and regulator NF1 GAP was enhanced. Importantly, expression of HRAS p.Gly60Val in HEK293 cells reduced growth factor sensitivity leading to damped RAF-MAPK and PI3K-AKT signalling response. Our data support the idea that a variable range of dysregulated HRAS-dependent signalling dynamics, rather than static activation of HRAS-dependent signal flow, may underlie the phenotypic variability in CS.
Ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco) is responsible for carbon dioxide conversion during photosynthesis and, therefore, is the most important protein in biomass generation. Modifications of this biocatalyst toward improvements in its properties are hindered by the complicated and not yet fully understood assembly process required for the formation of active holoenzymes. An entire set of auxiliary factors, including chaperonin GroEL/GroES and assembly chaperones RbcX or Rubisco accumulation factor 1 (RAF1), is involved in the folding and subsequent assembly of Rubisco subunits. Recently, it has been shown that cyanobacterial RAF1 acts during the formation of the large Rubisco subunit (RbcL) dimer. However, both its physiological function and its necessity in the prokaryotic Rubisco formation process remain elusive. Here, we demonstrate that the Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 strain with raf1 gene disruption shows the same growth rate as wild-type cells under standard conditions. Moreover, the Rubisco biosynthesis process seems to be unperturbed in mutant cells despite the absence of RbcL-RAF1 complexes. However, in the tested environmental conditions, sulfur starvation triggers the degradation of RbcL and subsequent proteolysis of other polypeptides in wild-type but not Δraf1 strains. Pull-down experiments also indicate that, apart from Rubisco, RAF1 co-purifies with phycocyanins. We postulate that RAF1 is not an obligatory factor in cyanobacterial Rubisco assembly, but rather participates in environmentally regulated Rubisco homeostasis.
To identify new biomarkers for biochemical recurrence (BCR) of prostate adenocarcinoma.
Clinical information of 500 patients with prostate adenocarcinoma and their 152 RNA-sequencing and protein-array data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) were separated into a discovery set and a validation set. Each dataset was analysed according to the Gleason grade groups reflecting BCR. The results obtained from the analysis using TCGA dataset were confirmed by immunohistochemistry analyses of a confirmation cohort composed of 395 patients with localised prostate adenocarcinoma.
TCGA discovery set was subgrouped into lower- and higher-risk groups for recurrence-free survival (RFS) (P &lt; 0.001). Cyclin B1 (CCNB1), dishevelled segment polarity protein 3 (DVL3), paxillin (PXN), RAF1, transferrin, X-ray repair cross complementing 5 (XRCC5) and BIM had lower expression in the lower-risk group than that in the higher-risk group (all, P &lt; 0.05). In TCGA validation set, CCNB1, DVL3, transferrin, XRCC5 and BIM were also differently expressed between the two groups. Immunohistochemically, DVL3 positivity was associated with high prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels, resection margin involvement, and BCR (all, P &lt; 0.05). A high Gleason score indicated a marginal relationship (P = 0.055). BIM positivity was related to high PSA levels, lymphovascular invasion, and BCR (all, P &lt; 0.05). Both DVL3 positivity (P = 0.010) and BIM positivity (P = 0.024) were associated with shorter RFS, but statistical significance was lost when the multivariate Cox regression model included all patients. In the lower-risk group, the multivariate Cox model confirmed that DVL3 was an independent predictor for poor RFS (hazard ratio 1.80, P = 0.040), and the concordance index (C-index) was 0.805.
DVL3 and BIM were expressed in patients with a higher risk of BCR. DVL3 may be a novel and easily applicable recurrence predictor of localised prostate adenocarcinoma.
Neutrophil granule exocytosis plays an important role in innate and adaptive immune responses. The present study examined TNF-α stimulation or priming of exocytosis of the 4 neutrophil granule subsets. TNF-α stimulated exocytosis of secretory vesicles and gelatinase granules and primed specific and azurophilic granule exocytosis to fMLF stimulation. Both stimulation and priming of exocytosis by TNF-α were dependent on p38 MAPK activity. Bioinformatic analysis of 1115 neutrophil proteins identified by mass spectrometry as being phosphorylated by TNF-α exposure found that actin cytoskeleton regulation was a major biologic function. A role for p38 MAPK regulation of the actin cytoskeleton was confirmed experimentally. Thirteen phosphoproteins regulated secretory vesicle quantity, formation, or release, 4 of which-Raf1, myristoylated alanine-rich protein kinase C (PKC) substrate (MARCKS), Abelson murine leukemia interactor 1 (ABI1), and myosin VI-were targets of the p38 MAPK pathway. Pharmacologic inhibition of Raf1 reduced stimulated exocytosis of gelatinase granules and priming of specific granule exocytosis. We conclude that differential regulation of exocytosis by TNF-α involves the actin cytoskeleton and is a necessary component for priming of the 2 major neutrophil antimicrobial defense mechanisms: oxygen radical generation and release of toxic granule contents.
How lncRNA MALAT1 is regulated by miRNAs at posttranscriptional level in pancreatic cancer and their regulative effects on the cancer cells remain largely unknown. By retrieving previous miRNA array data and performing primary qRT-PCR, we observed a significant negative correlation between miR-216a and MALAT1 in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) tissues and adjacent normal tissues. The following in vitro cell assay further confirmed a direct binding between miR-216a and MALAT1 and the suppressive effect of miR-216a on MALAT1 expression. MiR-216a overexpression had similar effects as MALAT1 siRNA on restoring p21 and p27 expression and inhibiting B-MYB, RAF1 and PCNA1 expression in both PANC-1 and BxPC3 cells. MiR-216a overexpression and MALAT1 knockdown induced cell cycle arrest at G2/M phase. MiR-216a overexpression not only significantly induced cell apoptosis, but also reduced cell viability and increased cell apoptosis in response to gemcitabine in the cancer cells. Based on these findings, we infer that miR-216a induces apoptosis both in the presence and absence of gemcitabine in pancreatic cancer cells by silencing MALAT1 expression.
Development of genetic instability is a hallmark of tumor progression. Type III β-tubulin (TUBB3) is a component of microtubules involved in chromosome segregation. Its overexpression has been linked to adverse features of urinary bladder cancer. To investigate the role of TUBB3 for development of genetic instability, we compared TUBB3 expression with histopathological features and surrogate markers of genetic instability and tumor aggressiveness; copy number changes of HER2, TOP2A, CCND1, RAF1, and FGFR1; nuclear accumulation of p53, and cell proliferation in a tissue microarray (TMA) with more than 700 bladder cancers. TUBB3 expression was linked to high-grade and advanced-stage cancers (P&lt;.0001), rapid cell proliferation (P&lt;.0001), presence of multiple gene copy number alterations (P=.0008), and nuclear accumulation of p53 (P=.0008). Strong TUBB3 staining was found in 43% of urothelial cancers harboring copy number alterations as compared with 28% of genetically stable cancers, and in 50% of p53-positive cancers as compared with 30% of p53-negative tumors. The fraction of tumors with concomitant TUBB3 and p53 positivity increased with tumor stage and grade: 2% in pTaG1-2, 11% in pTaG3, 17% in pT1G2, 23% in pT1G3, and 32% in pT2-4 cancers (P&lt;.0001). Importantly, strong TUBB3 overexpression was detectable in about 20% of low-grade, noninvasive cancers. In summary, our study demonstrates that TUBB3 overexpression is linked to an aggressive subtype of urinary bladder cancers, which is characterized by increased genetic instability, p53 alterations, and rapid cell proliferation. Detection of TUBB3 overexpression in genetically stable, low-grade, and noninvasive bladder cancers may be clinically useful to identify patients requiring particular close monitoring.
Glia scar is a hallmark in late-stage of brain stroke disease, which hinder axonal regeneration and neuronal repair. Mitofusin2 (Mfn2) is a newly found cellular proliferation inhibitor. This study is to elucidate the role of Mfn2 in reactive astrocytes induced by oxygen-glucose deprivation/reoxygenation(OGD/R) model in vitro. Up-expression in EdU staining and protein level of GFAP, PCNA and CyclinD1, demonstrates the distinct activation and proliferation of astrocytes after the stimulation of OGD/R. Meanwhile, Mfn2 was proved to be down-regulated both in gene and protein levels. Pretreatment of cells with adenoviral vector encoding Mfn2 gene increased Mfn2 expression and subsequently attenuated OGD-induced astrocyte proliferation. Down-regulation of Ras-p-Raf1-p-ERK1/2 pathway and cell cycle arrest were found to be relevant. Together, these results suggested that overexpression of Mfn2 can effectively inhibit the proliferation of reactive astrogliosis, which might contribute to a promising therapeutic intervention in cerebral ischemic injury.
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a leading cause of cancer deaths, but its molecular heterogeneity hampers the design of targeted therapies. Currently, the only therapeutic option for advanced HCC is Sorafenib, an inhibitor whose targets include RAF. Unexpectedly, RAF1 expression is reduced in human HCC samples. Modelling RAF1 downregulation by RNAi increases the proliferation of human HCC lines in xenografts and in culture; furthermore, RAF1 ablation promotes chemical hepatocarcinogenesis and the proliferation of cultured (pre)malignant mouse hepatocytes. The phenotypes depend on increased YAP1 expression and STAT3 activation, observed in cultured RAF1-deficient cells, in HCC xenografts, and in autochthonous liver tumours. Thus RAF1, although essential for the development of skin and lung tumours, is a negative regulator of hepatocarcinogenesis. This unexpected finding highlights the contribution of the cellular/tissue environment in determining the function of a protein, and underscores the importance of understanding the molecular context of a disease to inform therapy design.
High nevus count is the strongest risk factor for melanoma, and although gene variants have been discovered for both traits, epigenetic variation is unexplored. We investigated 322 healthy human skin DNA methylomes associated with total body nevi count, incorporating genetic and transcriptomic variation. DNA methylation changes were identified at genes involved in melanocyte biology, such as RAF1 (P = 1.2 × 10(-6)) and CTC1 (region: P = 6.3 × 10(-4)), and other genes including ARRDC1 (P = 3.1 × 10(-7)). A subset exhibited coordinated methylation and transcription changes within the same biopsy. The total analysis was also enriched for melanoma-associated DNA methylation variation (P = 6.33 × 10(-6)). In addition, we show that skin DNA methylation is associated in cis with known genome-wide association study single nucleotide polymorphisms for nevus count, at PLA2G6 (P = 1.7 × 10(-49)) and NID1 (P = 6.4 × 10(-14)), as well as melanoma risk, including in or near MC1R, MX2, and TERT/CLPTM1L (P &lt; 1 × 10(-10)). Our analysis using a uniquely large dataset comprising healthy skin DNA methylomes identified known and additional regulatory loci and pathways in nevi and melanoma biology. This integrative study improves our understanding of predisposition to nevi and their potential contribution to melanoma pathogenesis.
Molecular profiling is revolutionizing cancer diagnostics and leading to personalized therapeutic approaches. Herein we describe our clinical experience performing targeted sequencing for 31 pediatric neuro-oncology patients.
We sequenced 510 cancer-associated genes from tumor and peripheral blood to identify germline and somatic mutations, structural variants, and copy number changes.
Genomic profiling was performed on 31 patients with tumors including 11 high-grade gliomas, 8 medulloblastomas, 6 low-grade gliomas, 1 embryonal tumor with multilayered rosettes, 1 pineoblastoma, 1 uveal ganglioneuroma, 1 choroid plexus carcinoma, 1 chordoma, and 1 high-grade neuroepithelial tumor. In 25 cases (81%), results impacted patient management by: (i) clarifying diagnosis, (ii) identifying pathogenic germline mutations, or (iii) detecting potentially targetable alterations. The pathologic diagnosis was amended after genomic profiling for 6 patients (19%), including a high-grade glioma to pilocytic astrocytoma, medulloblastoma to pineoblastoma, ependymoma to high-grade glioma, and medulloblastoma to CNS high-grade neuroepithelial tumor with BCOR alteration. Multiple patients had pathogenic germline mutations, many of which were previously unsuspected. Potentially targetable alterations were identified in 19 patients (61%). Additionally, novel likely pathogenic alterations were identified in 3 cases: an in-frame RAF1 fusion in a BRAF wild-type pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma, an inactivating ASXL1 mutation in a histone H3 wild-type diffuse pontine glioma, and an in-frame deletion within exon 2 of MAP2K1 in a low-grade astrocytic neoplasm.
Our experience demonstrates the significant impact of molecular profiling on diagnosis and treatment of pediatric brain tumors and confirms its feasibility for use at the time of diagnosis or recurrence.
The treatment responses of sorafenib in hepatocellular carcinoma are modest which may be due to different characteristics of cancer cells or insufficient therapeutic concentrations. This study was to clarify this issue. The anti-proliferative effects and differential expressions of 8 genes related to sorafenib anti-cancer mechanisms (tyrosine kinase receptor genes: KDR, PDGFRB; RAF cascade: RAF1, BRAF, MAP2K1, MAP2K2, MAPK1, MAPK3) were investigated in primary cultured hepatocellular carcinoma cells collected from 8 patients using clinically applied sorafenib concentrations (5, 10μg/mL). The anti-proliferative effects of sorafenib at either 5 or 10μg/mL, which were related to down-regulations of KDR, PDGFRB and/or genes in the RAF cascade, were achieved only in one patient (HCC38/KMUH). However, either 5 or 10μg/mL sorafenib promoted proliferation in 4 patients (HCC29/KMUH, HCC62/KMUH, HCC87/KMUH, HCC98/KMUH). Among them, the RAF cascade, PDGFRB and/or KDR were up-regulated in 3 patients but no gene was differentially expressed in the remaining one patient (HCC87/KMUH). Increase the sorafenib concentration to 10μg/mL paradoxically up-regulated and/or obliterated the previously down-regulated genes in the RAF cascade and/or KDR in 4 patients (HCC29/KMUH, HCC76/KMUH, HCC87/KMUH, HCC98/KMUH). Significant down-regulations of the RAF cascade and PDGFRB by sorafenib but without anti-proliferative effects were detected in one patient (HCC54/KMUH). In conclusion, influence of sorafenib on proliferation is not simply through the RAF cascade. The responses of KDR, PDGFRB and the RAF cascade to sorafenib among patients are diverse or even contrary. Increase the sorafenib concentration has potential to up-regulate genes favored angiogenesis and proliferation.
Herbal medicines have been used in cancer treatment, with many exhibiting favorable side effect and toxicity profiles compared with conventional chemotherapeutic agents. SH003 is a novel extract from Astragalus membranaceus, Angelica gigas, and Trichosanthes Kirilowii Maximowicz combined at a 1:1:1 ratio that impairs the growth of breast cancer cells. This study investigates anti-cancer effects of SH003 in prostate cancer cells.
SH003 extract in 30% ethanol was used to treat the prostate cancer cell lines DU145, LNCaP, and PC-3. Cell viability was determined by MTT and BrdU incorporation assays. Next, apoptotic cell death was determined by Annexin V and 7-AAD double staining methods. Western blotting was conducted to measure protein expression levels of components of cell death and signaling pathways. Intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels were measured using H2DCF-DA. Plasmid-mediated ERK2 overexpression in DU145 cells was used to examine the effect of rescuing ERK2 function. Results were analyzed using the Student's t-test and P-values &lt; 0.05 were considered to indicate statistically-significant differences.
Our data demonstrate that SH003 induced apoptosis in DU145 prostate cancer cells by inhibiting ERK signaling. SH003 induced apoptosis of prostate cancer cells in dose-dependent manner, which was independent of androgen dependency. SH003 also increased intracellular ROS levels but this is not associated with its pro-apoptotic effects. SH003 inhibited phosphorylation of Ras/Raf1/MEK/ERK/p90RSK in androgen-independent DU145 cells, but not androgen-dependent LNCaP and PC-3 cells. Moreover, ERK2 overexpression rescued SH003-induced apoptosis in DU145 cells.
SH003 induces apoptotic cell death of DU145 prostate cancer cells by inhibiting ERK2-mediated signaling.
The aim of this study was to analyze and summarize the clinicopathological and molecular characteristics of classic biphasic pulmonary blastoma (PB) to improve its diagnosis and treatment.
A retrospective analysis was performed in patients who were diagnosed with PB at Sun Yat-Sen University Cancer Center from March 1995 to March 2015. Genomic DNA was profiled using a capture-based targeted sequencing panel.
Sixteen patients with an average age of 40 years were included in this study. Accurate preoperative diagnosis was very challenging as surgically resected tissues with immunohistochemical staining were required for the diagnosis. Surgery was the optimal treatment for localized disease and there was no standard management for metastatic disease. Mutations were detected among 9 out of the 56 genes profiled, including BRCA2, ERBB4, ALK, MET, BRAF, RAF1, PTEN, EGFR, and PIK3CA.
Due to the low incidence rate and the reclassification of PB, no standard treatment is available. Although the numbers of cases are few with varying individual experiences, it is important to improve our understanding regarding this rare lung cancer. Targeted DNA sequencing may be of clinical use for molecular testing and the effects of targeted therapy need to be confirmed.
Beginning with our previously reported ERK inhibitor BL-EI001, we found Raf1 to be an important regulator in the ERK interactive network, and then we designed and synthesized a novel series of Raf1/ERK dual inhibitors against human breast cancers through integrative computational, synthetic and biological screening methods. Moreover, we found that compound 9d suppressed the proliferation of breast cancer cell lines and induced cellular apoptosis via a mitochondrial pathway with only partial dependence on Raf1 and ERK. Our results suggest that an integrative method including in silico design, chemical synthesis, biological screening and bioinformatics analysis could be an attractive strategy for the discovery of multi-target inhibitors against breast cancer.
Pilocytic astrocytoma (PA) is one of the most common brain cancers among children and activation of the Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase (MAPK) pathway is considered the hallmark. In the majority of cases, oncogenic BRAF fusions or BRAF V600E mutations are observed, while RAF1 or NF1 alterations are more rarely found. However, in some cases, no apparent cancer driver events can be identified. Here, we describe a novel fusion between the transcription factor nuclear factor 1A (NFIA) and Raf-1 proto-oncogene (RAF1) in a 5-year old boy with PA. The novel fusion was identified as part of a comprehensive genomic tumor profiling. We show that the NFIA:RAF1 fusion results in constitutive Raf1 kinase activity, leading to activation of downstream MEK1/2 cascade and increased proliferation of cancer cells. The NFIA:RAF1 fusion displayed distinct subcellular localization towards the plasma membrane indicative of Raf-1 activation, in contrast to both wild type NFIA and Raf-1, which were localized in the nucleus and cytoplasm, respectively. In conclusion, our data support the existence of rare oncogenic RAF1 fusions with constitutive Raf-1 activity. This highlights the need for broad genetic testing in order to refine diagnostics of PA and to unravel potential treatment options, e.g. with MEK inhibitors.
LPIN1 is a protein that exhibits dual functions as a phosphatidic acid phosphatase enzyme in regulation of triglyceride and glycerophospholipid metabolism and a transcriptional coregulator. Through unknown tumour-promoting mechanism, LPIN1 frequently observed in various human cancer cell lines controls main cellular processes involved in cancer progression. Here, we demonstrate that LPIN1 enhances the tumour-promoting function of insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) by controlling IRS1 stability. LPIN1 interacts with IRS1 in an insulin growth factor-1-dependent signalling pathway and inhibits its serine phosphorylation, and thereby eliminating ubiquitin-dependent degradation of IRS1 via proteasomal and lysosomal pathways. Consequently, LPIN1 overexpression increases IRS1 abundance and enhances IRS1's ability to induce epithelial cell proliferation and mammary tumourigenesis. By contrast, depletion or inhibition of LPIN1 in breast cancer cells leads to a decreased IRS1 level, which subsequently inhibits the RAF1-mediated signalling pathway and AP-1 activity. In the syngeneic 4T1 breast cancer model, LPIN1 overexpression increased tumour development, whereas inhibition of LPIN1 and IRS1 suppressed it. Consistent with these observations, LPIN1 levels were positively correlated with IRS1 expression in human breast cancer. Thus, our results indicate a mechanism by which IRS1 expression is increased in breast cancer, and LPIN1 may be a promising drug target for anticancer therapy.
The present study screened potential genes related to lung adenocarcinoma, with the aim of further understanding disease pathogenesis. The GSE2514 dataset including 20 lung adenocarcinoma and 19 adjacent normal tissue samples from 10 patients with lung adenocarcinoma aged 45-73 years was downloaded from Gene Expression Omnibus. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between the two groups were screened using the t-test. Potential gene functions were predicted using functional and pathway enrichment analysis, and protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks obtained from the STRING database were constructed with Cytoscape. Module analysis of PPI networks was performed through MCODE in Cytoscape. In total, 535 upregulated and 465 downregulated DEGs were identified. These included ATP5D, UQCRC2, UQCR11 and genes encoding nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH), which are mainly associated with mitochondrial ATP synthesis coupled electron transport, and which were enriched in the oxidative phosphorylation pathway. Other DEGs were associated with DNA replication (PRIM1, MCM3, and RNASEH2A), cell surface receptor-linked signal transduction and the enzyme-linked receptor protein signaling pathway (MAPK1, STAT3, RAF1, and JAK1), and regulation of the cytoskeleton and phosphatidylinositol signaling system (PIP5K1B, PIP5K1C, and PIP4K2B). Our findings suggest that DEGs encoding subunits of NADH, PRIM1, MCM3, MAPK1, STAT3, RAF1, and JAK1 might be associated with the development of lung adenocarcinoma.
The continuously evolving field of proteomics produces increasing amounts of data while improving the quality of protein identifications. Albeit quantitative measurements are becoming more popular, many proteomic studies are still based on non-quantitative methods for protein identification. These studies result in potentially large sets of identified proteins, where the biological interpretation of proteins can be challenging. Systems biology develops innovative network-based methods, which allow an integrated analysis of these data. Here we present a novel approach, which combines prior knowledge of protein-protein interactions (PPI) with proteomics data using functional similarity measurements of interacting proteins. This integrated network analysis exactly identifies network modules with a maximal consistent functional similarity reflecting biological processes of the investigated cells. We validated our approach on small (H9N2 virus-infected gastric cells) and large (blood constituents) proteomic data sets. Using this novel algorithm, we identified characteristic functional modules in virus-infected cells, comprising key signaling proteins (e.g. the stress-related kinase RAF1) and demonstrate that this method allows a module-based functional characterization of cell types. Analysis of a large proteome data set of blood constituents resulted in clear separation of blood cells according to their developmental origin. A detailed investigation of the T-cell proteome further illustrates how the algorithm partitions large networks into functional subnetworks each representing specific cellular functions. These results demonstrate that the integrated network approach not only allows a detailed analysis of proteome networks but also yields a functional decomposition of complex proteomic data sets and thereby provides deeper insights into the underlying cellular processes of the investigated system.
Harboring the behavioral and histopathological signatures of Alzheimer's disease (AD), senescence accelerated mouse-prone 8 (SAMP8) mice are currently considered a robust model for studying AD. However, the underlying mechanisms, prioritized pathways and genes in SAMP8 mice linked to AD remain unclear. In this study, we provide a biological interpretation of the molecular underpinnings of SAMP8 mice. Our results were derived from differentially expressed genes in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex of SAMP8 mice compared to age-matched SAMR1 mice at 2, 6, and 12 months of age using cDNA microarray analysis. On the basis of PPI, MetaCore and the co-expression network, we constructed a distinct genetic sub-network in the brains of SAMP8 mice. Next, we determined that the regulation of synaptic transmission and apoptosis were disrupted in the brains of SAMP8 mice. We found abnormal gene expression of RAF1, MAPT, PTGS2, CDKN2A, CAMK2A, NTRK2, AGER, ADRBK1, MCM3AP, and STUB1, which may have initiated the dysfunction of biological processes in the brains of SAMP8 mice. Specifically, we found microRNAs, including miR-20a, miR-17, miR-34a, miR-155, miR-18a, miR-22, miR-26a, miR-101, miR-106b, and miR-125b, that might regulate the expression of nodes in the sub-network. Taken together, these results provide new insights into the biological and genetic mechanisms of SAMP8 mice and add an important dimension to our understanding of the neuro-pathogenesis in SAMP8 mice from a systems perspective.
Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) often leads to a long-term narrowing of cerebra! artery called vasospasm. To understand the molecular mechanisms in vasospasm, signal transduction of tyrosine kinase pathway and phosphorylation of myosin light chain (MLC) and calponin (CaP) in the basilar artery were studied. Vasospasm was produced in the canine basilar artery by a two-hemorrhage method, and vasocontraction was induced by a local application of KCI or serotonin to the basilar artery after a transclival exposure. Intracellular substrates of tyrosine kinase pathway, including Shc, Rafl, and extracellular-regulated kinases in the basilar artery, were activated after SAH, and the activation of Shc suggests stimulation of signal transductions from tyrosine kinase receptors, G-coupled receptors, or both. The activation of tyrosine kinase pathway in vasospasm also was supported by dose-dependent dilation of the spastic basilar artery on days 0 and 7 by topical application of genistein, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, and associated marked inhibition of tyrosine phosphorylation of intracellular substrates, including Shc. In addition, the generation of protein kinase M, catalytic fragment of protein kinase C(alpha) (PKC alpha), in vasospasm on days 0 and 7 was inhibited in response to genistein, indicating an inactivation of mu-calpain. It is suggested, therefore, that the reversal of vasospasm by genistein is closely associated with the restoration of intracellular Ca2+ levels. However, the increased activities of Raf1 and extracellular-regulated kinases in vasospasm were declined on day 7 compared with those on day 0 or 2, suggesting that the activation of tyrosine kinase pathway is more closely associated with the early stage of vasospasm than with the late stage of vasospasm. The analysis by pyrophosphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PPi-PAGE) demonstrated three MLC bands in vasospasm on days 2 and 7, as well as in KCI- and serotonin-induced vasocontraction. Since PPi-PAGE resolves smooth muscle MLC into three bands in the MLC kinase (MLCK)-mediated phosphorylation and into a single band in the PKC-mediated phosphorylation based on the phosphorylation state, the current results suggest that MLC in vasospasm is phosphorylated by MLCK but not by PKC. In basilar artery, CaP was significantly down-regulated, and in addition, significantly phosphorylated on serine and threonine residues only in vasospasm on days 2 and 7. Although the significance of CaP phosphorylations in vivo still is controversial, CaP down-regulation and phosphorylation may attenuate the inhibition of Mg(2+)-ATPase activity by CaP and induce a potential enhancement of smooth muscle contractility in delayed vasospasm. Since CaP is phosphorylated in vivo by PKC, activated PKC in vasospasm may phosphorylate CaP. Thus, SAH stimulates tyrosine kinase pathway to increase intracellular Ca2+ and activate PKC, and the former activates MLCK to phosphorylate MLC, whereas the latter phosphorylates CaP but not MLC.
Colorectal cancer (CRC) remains one of the leading causes of cancer-related death. Novel therapeutics are urgently needed, especially for tumours with activating mutations in KRAS (∼40%). Here we investigated the role of RAF1 in CRC, as a potential, novel target.
Colonosphere cultures were established from human tumour specimens obtained from patients who underwent colon or liver resection for primary or metastatic adenocarcinoma. The role of RAF1 was tested by generating knockdowns (KDs) using three independent shRNA constructs or by using RAF1-kinase inhibitor GW5074. Clone-initiating and tumour-initiating capacities were assessed by single-cell cloning and injecting CRC cells into immune-deficient mice. Expression of tight junction (TJ) proteins, localisation of polarity proteins and activation of MEK-ERK pathway was analysed by western blot, immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence.
KD or pharmacological inhibition of RAF1 significantly decreased clone-forming and tumour-forming capacity of all CRC cultures tested, including KRAS-mutants. This was not due to cytotoxicity but, at least in part, to differentiation of tumour cells into goblet-like cells. Inhibition of RAF1-kinase activity restored apicobasal polarity and the formation of TJs in vitro and in vivo, without reducing MEK-ERK phosphorylation. MEK-inhibition failed to restore polarity and TJs. Moreover, RAF1-impaired tumours were characterised by normalised tissue architecture.
RAF1 plays a critical role in maintaining the transformed phenotype of CRC cells, including those with mutated KRAS. The effects of RAF1 are kinase-dependent, but MEK-independent. Despite the lack of activating mutations in RAF1, its kinase domain is an attractive therapeutic target for CRC.
Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is one of the most common cardiomyopathies, which induces sudden cardiac death. Several mutants have been identified among HCM cases.
A 10-month female infant who experienced cough, fever, aggressive exertional dyspnea, and recurrent cyanosis was admitted to our hospital. The patient was first diagnosed with type I respiratory failure, dysfunction of heart, severe pneumonia, and also some cardiac disorders were suspected. The echocardiography, cardiac computed tomography scan, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging scan, and also electrocardiogram were performed to confirm a diagnosis of HCM. Moreover, the whole-genome sequencing and chromatin analysis have been suggested. Based on the sequencing analysis, a new heterozygous mutant of RAF1 at c. 770C&gt;T had been identified in absence of the same mutant in both her parents. Besides, the existence of normal karyotypes was confirmed among 3 samples.
So we first reported a single mutant of RAF1 770C&gt;T with idiopathic HCM in a very early age. This patient would have suffered significant cardiac ventricular hypertrophy with more severe clinical manifestation in an extremely younger age compared with other identified mutations. However, we could only take limited advantages of deoxyribonucleic acid sequencing in HCM diagnosis and therapy. Reporting additional observations of well designed cohorts with a long-term follow-up would be very helpful to accelerate the transition of genetic molecular research on HCM.
LEOPARD syndrome (LS) is an autosomal dominant inherited disorder primarily caused by mutations in the PTPN11, RAF1 and BRAF genes. Characteristic features include lentigines, craniofacial dysmorphism, myocardium or valve abnormalities, eletrocardiographic conduction defects and deafness. LS, neurofibromatosis type 1, Noonan syndrome and Legius syndrome are a group of highly overlapped disorders termed 'RASopathies'. Therefore, clinical discrimination between these syndromes represents a huge challenge. The present study reports a young child diagnosed with LS via identification of a common p.Thr468Met mutation in PTPN11. Taking into account two Taiwanese LS cases with an identical mutation, Thr468Met is likely to be the most prevalent mutation in the Chinese population. Furthermore, this study suggests that a clinical diagnosis of LS should be considered for individuals with congenital cardiac defects and atypical lentigines (i.e., light brown freckles) scattered particularly on the face.
SHOC2 is a scaffold protein composed almost entirely by leucine-rich repeats (LRRs) and having an N-terminal region enriched in alternating lysine and glutamate/aspartate residues (KEKE motifs). SHOC2 acts as a positive modulator of the RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK signalling cascade by favouring stable RAF1 interaction with RAS. We previously reported that the p.Ser2Gly substitution in SHOC2 underlies Mazzanti syndrome, a RASopathy clinically overlapping Noonan syndrome, promoting N-myristoylation and constitutive targeting of the mutant to the plasma membrane. We also documented transient nuclear translocation of wild-type SHOC2 upon EGF stimulation, suggesting a more complex function in signal transduction.Here, we characterized the domains controlling SHOC2 shuttling between the nucleus and cytoplasm, and those contributing to SHOC2(S2G) mistargeting to the plasma membrane, analysed the structural organization of SHOC2's LRR motifs, and determined the impact of SHOC2 mislocalization on ERK signalling. We show that LRRs 1 to 13 constitute a structurally recognizable domain required for SHOC2 import into the nucleus and constitutive targeting of SHOC2(S2G) to the plasma membrane, while the KEKE motif-rich region is necessary to achieve efficient SHOC2 export from the nucleus. We also document that SHOC2(S2G) localizes both in raft and non-raft domains, and that it translocates to the non-raft domains following stimulation. Finally, we demonstrate that SHOC2 trapping at different subcellular sites has a diverse impact on ERK signalling strength and dynamics, suggesting a dual counteracting modulatory role of SHOC2 in the control of ERK signalling exerted at different intracellular compartments.
The tumor suppressor proteins p15(INK4B), p16(INK4A), and p14(ARF), encoded by the INK4AB/ARF locus, are crucial regulators of cellular senescence. The locus is epigenetically silenced by the repressive Polycomb complexes in growing cells but is activated in response to oncogenic stress. Here we show that the mitogen- and stress-activated kinase (MSK1) is up-regulated after RAF1 oncogenic stress and that the phosphorylated (activated) form of MSK1 is significantly increased in the nucleus and recruited to the INK4AB/ARF locus. We show that MSK1 mediates histone H3S28 phosphorylation at the INK4AB/ARF locus and contributes to the rapid transcriptional activation of p15(INK4B) and p16(INK4A) in human cells despite the presence of the repressive H3K27me3 mark. Furthermore, we show that upon MSK1 depletion in oncogenic RAF1-expressing cells, H3S28ph presence at the INK4 locus and p15(INK4B) and p16(INK4A) expression are reduced. Finally, we show that H3S28-MSK-dependent phosphorylation functions in response to RAF1 signaling and that ERK and p38α contribute to MSK1 activation in oncogene-induced senescence.
Retinal injury induces Müller cell dedifferentiation by activating extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling. Stimulation of α2-adrenergic receptors protects against injury but also activates ERK in Müller cells. The purpose of this work was to study the effect of α2-adrenergic signaling on injury-induced ERK and Müller cell dedifferentiation. We tested the hypothesis that α2-stimulation triggers negative feedback regulation of the injury-induced ERK pathway that attenuates Müller cell dedifferentiation.
Chicken retina injured by N-methyl-D-aspartate and cultured primary Müller cells were stimulated by the α2-adrenergic agonist brimonidine. Immunostaining, quantitative RT-PCR, and Western blot techniques in combination with receptor blockers were used for analysis of the cellular responses.
Alpha2-adrenergic receptor stimulation attenuated injury-induced ERK activation and dedifferentiation of Müller cells as seen by decreased phospho-ERK, expression of transitin, and retinal progenitor cell genes. The attenuation was concomitant with a synergistic upregulation of several negative ERK-signal feedback regulators including ERK-phosphatases, Raf1-, and growth factor receptor-binding proteins. The results were also seen in cultures of primary Müller cells.
Alpha2-adrenergic signaling on Müller cells elicits an intracellular attenuation of the injury response that comprises negative ERK-signaling feedback leading to attenuated Müller cell dedifferentiation. The implications of this study are that adrenergic stress signals may directly modulate glial function in retina and that α2-adrenergic receptor pharmacology may be used to control glial injury response.
The milk pentasaccharide LNFPIII has therapeutic action for metabolic and autoimmune diseases and prolongs transplant survival in mice when presented as a neoglycoconjugate. Within LNFPIII is the Lewisx trisaccharide, expressed by many helminth parasites. In humans, LNFPIII is found in human milk and also known as stage-specific embryonic antigen-1. LNFPIII-NGC drives alternative activation of macrophages and dendritic cells via NFκB activation in a TLR4 dependent mechanism. However, the connection between LNFPIII-NGC activation of APCs, TLR4 signaling and subsequent MAP kinase signaling leading to anti-inflammatory activation of APCs remains unknown. In this study we determined that the innate receptor CD14 was essential for LNFPIII-NGC induction of both ERK and NFkB activation in APCs. Induction of ERK activation by LNFPIII-NGC was completely dependent on CD14/TLR4-Ras-Raf1/TPL2-MEK axis in bone marrow derived dendritic cells (BMDCs). In addition, LNFPIII-NGC preferentially induced the production of Th2 "favoring" chemokines CCL22 and matrix metalloprotease protein-9 in a CD14 dependent manner in BMDCs. In contrast, LNFPIII-NGC induces significantly lower levels of Th1 "favoring" chemokines, MIP1α, MIP1β and MIP-2 compared to levels in LPS stimulated cells. Interestingly, NGC of the identical human milk sugar LNnT, minus the alpha 1-3 linked fucose, failed to activate APCs via TLR4/MD2/CD14 receptor complex, suggesting that the alpha 1-3 linked fucose in LNFPIII and not on LNnT, is required for this process. Using specific chemical inhibitors of the MAPK pathway, we found that LNFPIII-NGC induction of CCL22, MMP9 and IL-10 production was dependent on ERK activation. Over all, this study suggests that LNFPIII-NGC utilizes CD14/TLR4-MAPK (ERK) axis in modulating APC activation to produce anti-inflammatory chemokines and cytokines in a manner distinct from that seen for the pro-inflammatory PAMP LPS. These pathways may explain the in vivo therapeutic effect of LNFPIII-NGC treatment for inflammation based diseases.
We investigated the role of intracerebroventricular (ICV) injection of rimonabant (500ng), a CB1 antagonist, on lipopolysaccharide ((LPS) 5mg/kg)-induced pulmonary inflammation in rats in an isolated perfused lung model. There were decreases in pulmonary capillary pressure (Ppc) and increases in the ((Wet-Dry)/Dry lung weight)/(Ppc) ratio in the ICV-vehicle/LPS group at 4h. There were decreases in TLR4 pathway markers, such as interleukin receptor-associated kinase-1, IκBα, Raf1 and phospho-SFK (Tyr416) at 30min and at 4h increases in IL-6, vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 and myeloperoxidase in lung homogenate. Intracerebroventricular rimonabant attenuated these LPS-induced responses, indicating that ICV rimonabant modulates LPS-initiated pulmonary inflammation.
Biogenesis of the photosynthetic enzyme Rubisco, a complex of eight large (RbcL) and eight small (RbcS) subunits, requires assembly chaperones. Here we analyzed the role of Rubisco accumulation factor1 (Raf1), a dimer of ∼40-kDa subunits. We find that Raf1 from Synechococcus elongatus acts downstream of chaperonin-assisted RbcL folding by stabilizing RbcL antiparallel dimers for assembly into RbcL8 complexes with four Raf1 dimers bound. Raf1 displacement by RbcS results in holoenzyme formation. Crystal structures show that Raf1 from Arabidopsis thaliana consists of a β-sheet dimerization domain and a flexibly linked α-helical domain. Chemical cross-linking and EM reconstruction indicate that the β-domains bind along the equator of each RbcL2 unit, and the α-helical domains embrace the top and bottom edges of RbcL2. Raf1 fulfills a role similar to that of the assembly chaperone RbcX, thus suggesting that functionally redundant factors ensure efficient Rubisco biogenesis.
Granulosa cell tumors of the ovary (GCTs) represent a specific subset of malignant ovarian tumors, of which there are 2 distinct subtypes, the juvenile and the adult form. Aside from surgery, no reliable therapeutic options currently exist for patients with GCT. This study sought to investigate the potential role of small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) as novel therapeutics in the clinical management of GCT.
Using TKI with distinct but overlapping multitargeted specificities, cellular proliferation, viability, and apoptosis were evaluated in 2 human GCT-derived cell lines, COV434 and KGN.
Sunitinib, which targets the imatinib-inhibited tyrosine kinases of VEGFR, KIT, PDGFR, and FLT-3, was without effect in COV434 and KGN cell lines. Sorafenib, which has a high affinity for RAF1 and BRAF, dose dependently inhibited cellular proliferation and viability in both cell lines at concentrations equivalent to that seen in other systems. A RAF1 kinase inhibitor was without effect, suggesting that sorafenib is acting via inhibition of BRAF, or that aberrant signaling originates upstream of BRAF in the MAPK pathway. In the presence of a selective Src family inhibitor (SU6656), cell proliferation and cell viability responses dissociated; that is, although SU6656 dose dependently inhibited cell viability, it had limited effect on proliferation and apoptosis.
These findings implicate BRAF in the activated signaling responsible for the growth and viability of GCT and suggest that TKI already in clinical use may be a therapeutic option in the treatment of GCT.
RAS proteins are signal transduction gatekeepers that mediate cell growth, survival, and differentiation through interactions with multiple effector proteins. The RAS effector RAS- and RAB-interacting protein 1 (RIN1) activates its own downstream effectors, the small GTPase RAB5 and the tyrosine kinase Abelson tyrosine-protein kinase (ABL), to modulate endocytosis and cytoskeleton remodeling. To identify ABL substrates downstream of RAS-to-RIN1 signaling, we examined human HEK293T cells overexpressing components of this pathway. Proteomic analysis revealed several novel phosphotyrosine peptides, including Harvey rat sarcoma oncogene (HRAS)-pTyr(137). Here we report that ABL phosphorylates tyrosine 137 of H-, K-, and NRAS. Increased RIN1 levels enhanced HRAS-Tyr(137) phosphorylation by nearly 5-fold, suggesting that RAS-stimulated RIN1 can drive ABL-mediated RAS modification in a feedback circuit. Tyr(137) is well conserved among RAS orthologs and is part of a transprotein H-bond network. Crystal structures of HRAS(Y137F) and HRAS(Y137E) revealed conformation changes radiating from the mutated residue. Although consistent with Tyr(137) participation in allosteric control of HRAS function, the mutations did not alter intrinsic GTP hydrolysis rates in vitro. HRAS-Tyr(137) phosphorylation enhanced HRAS signaling capacity in cells, however, as reflected by a 4-fold increase in the association of phosphorylated HRAS(G12V) with its effector protein RAF proto-oncogene serine/threonine protein kinase 1 (RAF1). These data suggest that RAS phosphorylation at Tyr(137) allosterically alters protein conformation and effector binding, providing a mechanism for effector-initiated modulation of RAS signaling.
Heterozygous germline mutations in the proto-oncogene HRAS cause Costello syndrome (CS), an intellectual disability condition with severe failure to thrive, cardiac abnormalities, predisposition to tumors, and neurologic abnormalities. More than 80% of patients share the HRAS mutation c.34G&gt;A (p.Gly12Ser) associated with the typical, relatively homogeneous phenotype. Rarer mutations occurred in individuals with an attenuated phenotype and less characteristic facial features. Most pathogenic HRAS alterations affect hydrolytic HRAS activity resulting in constitutive activation. "Gain-of-function" and "hyperactivation" concerning downstream pathways are widely used to explain the molecular basis and dysregulation of the RAS-MAPK pathway is the biologic mechanism shared amongst rasopathies. Panel testing for rasopathies identified a novel HRAS mutation (c.179G&gt;A; p.Gly60Asp) in three individuals with attenuated features of Costello syndrome. De novo paternal origin occurred in two, transmission from a heterozygous mother in the third. Individuals showed subtle facial features; curly hair and relative macrocephaly were seen in three; atrial tachycardia and learning difficulties in two, and pulmonic valve dysplasia and mildly thickened left ventricle in one. None had severe failure to thrive, intellectual disability or cancer, underscoring the need to consider HRAS mutations in individuals with an unspecific rasopathy phenotype. Functional studies revealed strongly increased HRAS(Gly60Asp) binding to RAF1, but not to other signaling effectors. Hyperactivation of the MAPK downstream signaling pathways was absent. Our results indicate that an increase in the proportion of activated RAS downstream signaling components does not entirely explain the molecular basis of CS. We conclude that the phenotypic variability in CS recapitulates variable qualities of molecular dysfunction.
The genetic basis of 50% to 60% of prostate cancer (PCa) is attributable to rearrangements in E26 transformation-specific (ETS) (ERG, ETV1, ETV4, and ETV5), BRAF, and RAF1 genes and overexpression of SPINK1. The development and validation of reliable detection methods are warranted to classify various molecular subtypes of PCa for diagnostic and prognostic purposes. ETS gene rearrangements are typically detected by fluorescence in situ hybridization and reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction methods. Recently, monoclonal antibodies against ERG have been developed that detect the truncated ERG protein in immunohistochemical assays where staining levels are strongly correlated with ERG rearrangement status by fluorescence in situ hybridization. However, specific antibodies for ETV1, ETV4, and ETV5 are unavailable, challenging their clinical use. We developed a novel RNA in situ hybridization-based assay for the in situ detection of ETV1, ETV4, and ETV5 in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues from prostate needle biopsies, prostatectomy, and metastatic PCa specimens using RNA probes. Further, with combined RNA in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry we identified a rare subset of PCa with dual ETS gene rearrangements in collisions of independent tumor foci. The high specificity and sensitivity of RNA in situ hybridization provides an alternate method enabling bright-field in situ detection of ETS gene aberrations in routine clinically available PCa specimens.
KRAS is the most frequently mutated oncogene in human cancer, yet no therapies are available to treat KRAS mutant cancers. We used two independent reverse genetic approaches to identify components of the RAS-signaling pathways required for growth of KRAS mutant tumors. Small interfering RNA (siRNA) screening of 37 KRAS mutant colorectal cancer cell lines showed that RAF1 suppression was synthetic lethal with MEK inhibition. An unbiased kinome short hairpin RNA (shRNA)-based screen confirmed this synthetic lethal interaction in colorectal as well as in lung cancer cells bearing KRAS mutations. Compounds targeting RAF kinases can reverse resistance to the MEK inhibitor selumetinib. MEK inhibition induces RAS activation and BRAF-RAF1 dimerization and sustains MEK-ERK signaling, which is responsible for intrinsic resistance to selumetinib. Prolonged dual blockade of RAF and MEK leads to persistent ERK suppression and efficiently induces apoptosis. Our data underlie the relevance of developing combinatorial regimens of drugs targeting the RAF-MEK pathway in KRAS mutant tumors.
Macrophages acquire distinct phenotypes during tissue stress and inflammatory responses, but the mechanisms that regulate the macrophage polarization are poorly defined. Here we show that tuberous sclerosis complex 1 (TSC1) is a critical regulator of M1 and M2 phenotypes of macrophages. Mice with myeloid-specific deletion of TSC1 exhibit enhanced M1 response and spontaneously develop M1-related inflammatory disorders. However, TSC1-deficient mice are highly resistant to M2-polarized allergic asthma. Inhibition of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) fails to reverse the hypersensitive M1 response of TSC1-deficient macrophages, but efficiently rescues the defective M2 polarization. Deletion of mTOR also fails to reverse the enhanced inflammatory response of TSC1-deficient macrophages. Molecular studies indicate that TSC1 inhibits M1 polarization by suppressing the Ras GTPase-Raf1-MEK-ERK pathway in mTOR-independent manner, whereas TSC1 promotes M2 properties by mTOR-dependent CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein-β pathways. Overall, these findings define a key role for TSC1 in orchestrating macrophage polarization via mTOR-dependent and independent pathways.
Ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco) biosynthesis is a multi-step process in which specific chaperones are involved. Recently, a novel polypeptide, Rubisco Accumulation Factor 1 (RAF1), has been identified as a protein that is necessary for proper assembly of this enzyme in maize cells (Zea mays). However, neither its specific function nor its mode of action have as yet been determined. The results presented here show that the prokaryotic homolog of RAF1 from Thermosynechococcus elongatus is expressed in cyanobacterial cells and interacts with a large Rubisco subunit (RbcL). Using a heterologous expression system, it was demonstrated that this protein promotes Rubisco assembly in Escherichia coli cells. Moreover, when co-expressed with RbcL alone, a stable RbcL-RAF1 complex is formed. Molecular mass determination for this Rubisco assembly intermediate by size-exclusion chromatography coupled with multi-angle light scattering indicates that it consists of an RbcL dimer and two RAF1 molecules. A purified RbcL-RAF1 complex dissociated upon addition of a small Rubisco subunit (RbcS), leading to formation of the active holoenzyme. Moreover, titration of the octameric (RbcL8) core of Rubisco with RAF1 results in disassembly of such a stucture and creation of an RbcL-RAF1 intermediate. The results presented here are the first attempt to elucidate the role of cyanobacterial Rubisco Accumulation Factor 1 in the Rubisco biosynthesis process.
The RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK pathway is one of the best characterized kinase cascades. During the exploration of small molecules that inhibit RAF1 kinase, regorafenib (BAY 73-4506) was discovered as a multikinase inhibitor which demonstrated anti-cancer, anti-angiogenic, and apoptotic activities in metastatic colorectal cancer. This was not the first multikinase inhibitor discovered for the disease; indeed, before regorafenib was approved by FDA as a multikinase inhibitor for metastatic colorectal cancer in 2012, sorafenib (BAY 43-9006) had already been developed to be the first in the world as a multikinase inhibitor for malignancy. Indeed, the only difference between the two compounds is fluorine bound to its proximal phenyl ring although the end result is a considerably different profile, both as a kinase inhibitor as well as in its clinical application.
In this drug discovery case history, the authors review the design, discovery, and development of both regorafenib and sorafenib from back in the 1990s. Furthermore, the authors highlight the drug's anti-cancer and anti-angiogenic properties as well as its efficacy, safety pharmacology and toxicology based on FDA documents.
In order to better predict the efficacy of kinase inhibitors and to utilize them more efficiently, our understanding of drug discovery, the approaches for kinase profiling, and technologies needed for their development are paramount. Indeed, the authors believe that the field should better explore the use of predictive biomarkers that might be able to better assess these therapeutics. Pharmaceutical scientists must also consider the cost effectiveness of the targeted agents developed as a number of the drugs developed are very expensive.
Raf1 kinase inhibitor protein (RKIP) negatively regulates the Raf1/MEK/ERK pathway which is vital for cell growth and differentiation. It is also a biomarker in clinical cancer diagnosis. RKIP binds to the N-terminus of Raf1 kinase but little is known about the structural basis of RKIP binding with Raf1. Here, we demonstrate that the N-terminus of human Raf1 kinase (hRaf11-147aa) binds with human RKIP (hRKIP) at its ligand-binding pocket, loop "127-149", and the C-terminal helix by NMR experiments. D70, D72, E83, Y120, and Y181 were further verified as the key residues participating in the interaction of hRKIP and hRaf11-147aa. G143-R146 fragment was also critical for hRKIP binding with hRaf11-147aa, for its deletion decreased the binding affinity around 300 times, from 154 to 0.46 mM(-1). Our results provide important structural clues for designing the lead compound that disrupts RKIP-Raf1 interaction.
Previous co-expression analysis of human kinase genes highlighted 119 genes in neurotransmitter-related activity (based on Go:Terms). Using a merged interactome dataset, we analyzed the network of these Neurotransmitter Related Human Kinase Genes. Using the full interactome dataset we extended the network and calculating degrees and closeness centralities we identified SRC, MAPK1, RAF1, PTK2B and AKT1 kinase genes as potentially relevant nodes which did not show relevant activity in the original experimental study. As AKT1 and MAPK1 have already been indicated in various neuronal functions, we hypothesize a potential direct or indirect role for SRC, RAF1, PTK2B genes in neurotransmission and in central nervous system signaling processes.
Butyltins (BTs) contaminate the environment and are found in human blood. BTs, tributyltin (TBT) and dibutyltin (DBT) diminish the cytotoxic function and levels of key proteins of human natural killer (NK) cells. NK cells are an initial immune defense against tumors, virally infected cells and antibody-coated cells and thus critical to human health. The signaling pathways that regulate NK cell functions include mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs). Studies have shown that exposure to BTs leads to activation of specific MAPKs and MAPK kinases (MAP2Ks) in human NK cells. MAP2K kinases (MAP3Ks) are upstream activators of MAP2Ks, which then activate MAPKs. The current study examined if BT-induced activation of MAP3Ks was responsible for MAP2K and thus, MAPK activation. This study examines the effects of TBT and DBT on the total levels of two MAP3Ks, c-Raf and ASK1, as well as activating and inhibitory phosphorylation sites on these MAP3Ks. In addition, the immediate upstream activator of c-Raf, Ras, was examined for BT-induced alterations. Our results show significant activation of the MAP3K, c-Raf, in human NK cells within 10 min of TBT exposure and the MAP3K, ASK1, after 1 h exposures to TBT. In addition, our results suggest that both TBT and DBT affect the regulation of c-Raf.
Protein post-translational modifications (PTMs) are an important aspect of protein regulation. The number of PTMs discovered within the human proteome, and other proteomes, has been rapidly expanding in recent years. As a consequence of the rate in which new PTMs are identified, analysis done in one year may result in different conclusions when repeated in subsequent years. Among the various functional questions pertaining to PTMs, one important relationship to address is the interplay between modifications and mutations. Specifically, because the linear sequence surrounding a modification site often determines molecular recognition, it is hypothesized that mutations near sites of PTMs may be more likely to result in a detrimental effect on protein function, resulting in the development of disease.
We wrote an application programming interface (API) to make analysis of ProteomeScout, a comprehensive database of PTMs and protein information, easy and reproducible. We used this API to analyze the relationship between PTMs and human mutations associated with disease (based on the 'Clinical Significance' annotation from dbSNP). Proteins containing pathogenic mutations demonstrated a significant study bias which was controlled for by analyzing only well-studied proteins, based on their having at least one pathogenic mutation. We found that pathogenic mutations are significantly more likely to lie within eight amino acids of a phosphoserine, phosphotyrosine or ubiquitination site when compared to mutations in general, based on a Fisher's Exact test. Despite the skew of pathogenic mutations occurring on positively charged arginines, we could not account for this relationship based only on residue type. Finally, we hypothesize a potential mechanism for a pathogenic mutation on RAF1, based on its proximity to a phosphorylation site, which represents a subtle regulation difference that may explain why its biochemical effect has failed to be uncovered previously. The combination of the API and a dynamically expanding PTM database will make the reanalysis of this question and other systems-level questions easier in the future.
Acute ischemic stroke is one of the most important factors leading to disability and death with the characterization of accumulated neuron death and injured supportive neurovascular structures. Raf-1 kinase inhibitory protein (RKIP) is a key molecule in cell response to survival or death stimuli. However, the role of RKIP in stroke is worthy to be further studied.
We used lentivirus mediated RKIP knockdown and overexpression to investigate the effect of RKIP on animal models of focal cerebral ischemia. Cell Counting Kit-8 assay, lactate dehydrogenase release analysis, and Annexin V-APC apoptosis assay were used to detect the effect RKIP on microglial cell apoptosis and survival. Transwell migration assay was carried out to evaluate the migration of microglia cells. The releases of inflammatory cytokines were determined by ELISA. The activation of NF-kappaB signaling pathway was determined by western blot.
Overexpression of RKIP reduced focal cerebral ischemia injury. RKIP knockdown and overexpression regulated survival, activation, and motility via the NF-κB pathway. NF-κB inhibitor BAY 11-7082 blocked the changes caused by RKIP down-regulation after oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD). RKIP overexpression inhibited the upregulation of phosphorylation of NF-κB induced by OGD and cerebral ischemia.
The present study showed that RKIP protects against ischemic stroke through inhibition of microglial excessive activation, inhibits its motility, and promotes neuronal survival partly though IKKβ-IκBα-NF-κB signaling axis and indicate that RKIP is a new target for the treatment of ischemic stroke.
Galectin-1 (Gal-1), a member of the galectin family of carbohydrate binding proteins, plays a pivotal role in various cellular processes of tumorigenesis. The regulatory effect of Gal-1 on multidrug resistance (MDR) breast cancer cells is still unclear. qRT-PCR and western blot showed that Gal-1 and MDR gene 1 (MDR1) were both highly expressed in breast tumor tissues and cell lines. MTT assay and flow cytometry revealed that Gal-1 knockdown improved sensitivity to paclitaxel (PTX) and adriamycin (ADR) in MCF-7/PTX and MCF-7/ADR cells via inhibition of cell viability and promotion of cell apoptosis, while MDR1 overexpression weakened the sensitivity to PTX and ADR induced by Gal-1 knockdown. Furthermore, the negative effects of Gal-1 knockdown on sensitivity to PTX and ADR in MCF-7/PTX and MCF-7/ADR cells were revealed to be mediated via the suppression of Raf-1/AP-1 pathway. In conclusion, Gal-1 knockdown dramatically improved drug sensitivity of breast cancer by reducing P-glycoprotein (P-gp) expression via inhibiting the Raf-1/AP-1 pathway, providing a novel therapeutic target to overcome MDR in breast cancer.
In cancer, upregulated Ras promotes cellular transformation and proliferation in part through activation of oncogenic Ras-MAPK signaling. While directly inhibiting Ras has proven challenging, new insights into Ras regulation through protein-protein interactions may offer unique opportunities for therapeutic intervention. Here we report the identification and validation of Aurora kinase A (Aurora A) as a novel Ras binding protein. We demonstrate that the kinase domain of Aurora A mediates the interaction with the N-terminal domain of H-Ras. Further more, the interaction of Aurora A and H-Ras exists in a protein complex with Raf-1. We show that binding of H-Ras to Raf-1 and subsequent MAPK signaling is enhanced by Aurora A, and requires active H-Ras. Thus, the functional linkage between Aurora A and the H-Ras/Raf-1 protein complex may provide a mechanism for Aurora A's oncogenic activity through direct activation of the Ras/MAPK pathway.
This study aimed to investigate rapid effect of anti-androgen 2-hydroxyflutamide (HF) on cadherin/catenin complex and androgen receptor (AR) phosphorylation in prostate cancer cell lines. In addition, a role of PI3K/Akt and MAPK/ERK1/2 pathways in mediating these effects was explored. We have demonstrated that in androgen-sensitive LNCaP cells HF induced rapid increase of E-cadherin phosphorylation at Ser 838/840 (p&lt;0.05) in MAPK/ERK1/2-dependent manner, whereas phosphorylation of β-catenin at Tyr 654 was unchanged. Concomitantly, the reduction of the level of AR phosphorylated at Ser210/213 was found (p&lt;0.01). In androgen-independent PC3 cells HF decreased Tyr 860 N-cadherin and Tyr 645 β-catenin phosphorylation (p&lt;0.01), acting via both MAPK/ERK1/2 and PI3K/Akt pathways. Further, we evidenced that MAPK/ERK1/2 and PI3K/Akt pathways were differentially influenced by HF in LNCaP and PC3 cells. In LNCaP cells, both Akt (p&lt;0.01) and ERK1/2 (p&lt;0.001) phosphorylation were negatively regulated and this effect was mediated by Raf-1 (p&lt;0.05). In contrast, in PC3 cells HF stimulated Akt (p&lt;0.001) and ERK1/2 (p&lt;0.001) activation, but had no effect on the crosstalk between PI3K/Akt and MEK/ERK1/2 pathways at the Raf-1 kinase level. Our findings expand the role of anti-androgen into non-genomic signaling, creating a link between anti-androgen action and phosphorylation of adherens junction proteins in prostate cancer cells.
Large granular lymphocyte (LGL) leukemia has been recognized by the World Health Organization classifications amongst mature T-cell and natural killer (NK) cell neoplasms. There are 3 categories: chronic T-cell leukemia and NK-cell lymphocytosis, which are similarly indolent diseases characterized by cytopenias and autoimmune conditions as opposed to aggressive NK-cell LGL leukemia. Clonal LGL expansion arise from chronic antigenic stimulation, which promotes dysregulation of apoptosis, mainly due to constitutive activation of survival pathways including Jak/Stat, MapK, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-Akt, Ras-Raf-1, MEK1/extracellular signal-regulated kinase, sphingolipid, and nuclear factor-κB. Socs3 downregulation may also contribute to Stat3 activation. Interleukin 15 plays a key role in activation of leukemic LGL. Several somatic mutations including Stat3, Stat5b, and tumor necrosis factor alpha-induced protein 3 have been demonstrated recently in LGL leukemia. Because these mutations are present in less than half of the patients, they cannot completely explain LGL leukemogenesis. A better mechanistic understanding of leukemic LGL survival will allow future consideration of a more targeted therapeutic approach than the current practice of immunosuppressive therapy.
MicroRNA (miR)-217 has been reported to participate in carcinogenesis and tumor progression in several cancers; however, its expression and biological functions in colorectal cancer (CRC) are still unclear. The present study demonstrated that miR-217 expression was significantly higher in matched adjacent noncancerous tissues than in CRC tissues (P&lt;0.001). In addition, it was observed that low-grade CRC exhibited greater expression of miR-217 compared with high-grade CRC (P&lt;0.05). Kaplan-Meier survival and Cox regression analyses revealed that overall survival rates were significantly poorer in the low-expression group relative to the high-expression group (P&lt;0.005). Next, a potential miR-217 target, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) 1, was identified. Upregulation of miR-217 could significantly downregulate MAPK1 expression. CRC cells overexpressing miR-217 exhibited cell growth inhibition by significant enhancement of apoptosis in vitro. The present study further investigated the MAPK signaling pathway to verify the mechanisms, and revealed that KRAS and Raf-1 expression was downregulated in miR-217-overexpressing RKO cells. Taken together, our results revealed that miR-217 inhibits tumor growth and enhances apoptosis in CRC, and that this is associated with the downregulation of MAPK signaling. These results indicate that miR-217 is a promising therapeutic target for the treatment of CRC.
Although type II cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKGII) is a major downstream effector of cGMP in chondrocytes and attenuates the FGF receptor 3/ERK signaling pathway, its direct target proteins have not been fully explored. In the present study, we attempted to identify PKGII-targeted proteins, which are associated with the inhibition of FGF-induced MAPK activation. Although FGF2 stimulation induced the phosphorylation of ERK1/2, MEK1/2, and Raf-1 at Ser-338 in rat chondrosarcoma cells, pretreatment with a cell-permeable cGMP analog strongly inhibited their phosphorylation. On the other hand, Ser-43 of Raf-1 was phosphorylated by cGMP in a dose-dependent manner. Therefore, we examined the direct phosphorylation of Raf-1 by PKGII. Wild-type PKGII phosphorylated Raf-1 at Ser-43 in a cGMP-dependent manner, but a PKGII D412A/R415A mutant, which has a low affinity for cGMP, did not. Finally, we found that a phospho-mimic mutant, Raf-1 S43D, suppressed FGF2-induced MAPK pathway. These results suggest that PKGII counters FGF-induced MEK/ERK activation through the phosphorylation of Raf-1 at Ser-43 in chondrocytes.
Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) infections represent a major health concern in Southeast Asia since no effective treatments are available. Recently, several reports have demonstrated that inhibition of certain host cell proteins prevents viral infection. Raf-1 kinase is a central component of many signaling pathways involved in normal cell growth and oncogenic transformation, and Ras/Raf/ERK signaling activation has been observed during viral infections (including JEV infection). In this study, Raf-1 was confirmed to be upregulated by JEV infection, which suggested that Raf-1 might be important for JEV infection and might be a target for novel anti-JEV drugs. To determine the role of Raf-1 during the JEV infection process, antisense oligonucleotides (ASODNs) were used to downregulate Raf-1 expression in JEV-infected baby hamster kidney (BHK-21) cells and African green monkey kidney (Vero) cells. From five ASODNs candidates tested, Raf-1-1 (Raf-1 antisense) significantly downregulated Raf-1 protein expression levels, significantly inhibited cytopathic effect (CPE) in cultured cells, and reduced JEV RNA levels in cell medium without affecting cell viability. Furthermore, it also demonstrated that ASODN Raf-1-1 possessed therapeutic effects by using a lethal JEV infection mouse model. In conclusion, data presented in this report demonstrated that ASODN Raf-1-1 could suppress Raf-1 protein and that Raf-1 inhibition suppressed JEV replication in vitro and in vivo. These data provided evidence for targeting Raf-1 in the development of novel anti-JEV therapies. In addition, Raf-1-1 represents potential drugs that can be adapted for treating JEV infections.
Suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA), a histone deacetylase inhibitor, has preclinical efficacy in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), despite an unclear molecular mechanism. We sought to further investigate the effects of SAHA on HCC. We hypothesize SAHA will inhibit HCC cellular proliferation through apoptosis and aid in further profiling SAHA's effect on HCC oncogenic pathways.
HCC cell lines were treated with various concentrations of SAHA. Cell proliferation was determined by MTT and colonogenic assays. Cell lysates were analyzed via Western blotting for apoptotic and oncogenic pathway markers. Caspase glo-3/7 was used to assess apoptosis.
SAHA treatment demonstrated significant (&lt;0.05) reduction in cell growth and colony formation through apoptosis and cell cycle arrest. Western analysis showed reduction in Notch, pAKT and pERK1/2 proteins. Interestingly, phosphorylated STAT3 was increased in all cell lines.
SAHA inhibits Notch, AKT, and Raf-1 pathways but not the STAT3 pathway. We believe that STAT3 may lead to cancer cell progression, reducing SAHA efficacy in HCC. Therefore, combination of SAHA and STAT or Notch inhibition may be a strategy for HCC treatment.
Stem cell transplantation is a promising clinical strategy to cure acute liver failure. However, low cell survival ratio after transplantation significantly impaired its therapeutic efficacy. This is partly due to insufficient resistance of transplanted stem cells to severe oxidative and inflammatory stress at the injury sites. In the current study, we demonstrated that a small molecule zeaxanthin dipalmitate (ZD) could enhance the defensive abilities against adverse stresses of human adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hADMSCs) in vitro and increase their therapeutic outcomes of acute liver failure after transplantation in vivo. Treatment with ZD dramatically improved cell survival, suppressed apoptosis, inflammation, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production of hADMSCs through the PKC/Raf-1/MAPK/NF-&amp;#954;B pathway to maintain a reasonably high expression level of microRNA-210 (miR-210). The regulation loop between miR-210 and cellular/mitochondrial ROS production was found to be linked by the ROS inhibitor iron-sulfur cluster assembly proteins (ISCU). Pre-treatment with ZD and stable knock-down of miR-210 significantly improved and impaired the stem cell transplantation efficacy through the alteration of hepatic cell expansion and injury amelioration, respectively. Vehicle-treatment with ZD did not pose any adverse effect on cell homeostasis or healthy animal. In conclusion, elevating endogenous antioxidant level of hADMSCs with ZD significantly enhances their hepatic tissue repairing capabilities. Maintenance of a physiological level of miR-210 is critical for hADMSCs homeostasis.
We previously reported in atrial myocytes that inhibition of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) by laminin (LMN)-integrin signaling activates β2-adrenergic receptor (β2-AR) stimulation of cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2). The present study sought to determine the signaling mechanisms by which inhibition of PKA activates β2-AR stimulation of cPLA2. We therefore determined the effects of zinterol (0.1 μM; zint-β2-AR) to stimulate ICa,L in atrial myocytes in the absence (+PKA) and presence (-PKA) of the PKA inhibitor (1 μM) KT5720 and compared these results with atrial myocytes attached to laminin (+LMN). Inhibition of Raf-1 (10 μM GW5074), phospholipase C (PLC; 0.5 μM edelfosine), PKC (4 μM chelerythrine) or IP3 receptor (IP3R) signaling (2 μM 2-APB) significantly inhibited zint-β2-AR stimulation of ICa,L in-PKA but not +PKA myocytes. Western blots showed that zint-β2-AR stimulation increased ERK1/2 phosphorylation in-PKA compared to +PKA myocytes. Adenoviral (Adv) expression of dominant negative (dn) -PKCα, dn-Raf-1 or an IP3 affinity trap, each inhibited zint-β2-AR stimulation of ICa,L in + LMN myocytes compared to control +LMN myocytes infected with Adv-βgal. In +LMN myocytes, zint-β2-AR stimulation of ICa,L was enhanced by adenoviral overexpression of wild-type cPLA2 and inhibited by double dn-cPLA2S505A/S515A mutant compared to control +LMN myocytes infected with Adv-βgal. In-PKA myocytes depletion of intracellular Ca2+ stores by 5 μM thapsigargin failed to inhibit zint-β2-AR stimulation of ICa,L via cPLA2. However, disruption of caveolae formation by 10 mM methyl-β-cyclodextrin inhibited zint-β2-AR stimulation of ICa,L in-PKA myocytes significantly more than in +PKA myocytes. We conclude that inhibition of PKA removes inhibition of Raf-1 and thereby allows β2-AR stimulation to act via PKCα/Raf-1/MEK/ERK1/2 and IP3-mediated Ca2+ signaling to stimulate cPLA2 signaling within caveolae. These findings may be relevant to the remodeling of β-AR signaling in failing and/or aging heart, both of which exhibit decreases in adenylate cyclase activity.
Raf-1 has an important role in cellular antiapoptosis. So far, there is no solid evidence that shows that Raf-1 mutation is associated with cancer development. In the course of further study of Raf-1 signaling, we have reported that Raf-1 hyperphosphorylation inhibits its kinase activity toward its downstream mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 1/2 (MEK1/2) and proposed a model for negative feedback regulation of Raf-1. Here, we show that there is no hyperphosphorylation in some cancer cells, which results in increased kinase activity and enhances the antiapoptotic ability. Inhibition of either Raf-1 or ALG-2 (apoptosis-linked gene 2) expression results in apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1/c-Jun N-terminal kinase (ASK1/JNK) signaling activation, and cell sensitivity to chemotherapeutic reagents, indicating that inhibition of ASK1/JNK apoptotic signaling by Raf-1 is mediated by ALG-2. A previous report indicated that extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) were responsible for Raf-1 hyperphosphorylation. However, our evidence shows that when ERK1/2 are activated and the Raf-1 gene is not mutated, Raf-1 is not hyperphosphorylated in these cells, indicating that ERK1/2 are not responsible for the Raf-1 hyperphosphorylation in these cancer cell lines. Surprisingly, we also found that Raf-1 is not a necessary kinase for MEK1/2 activation under normal tissue culture conditions, but is required for MEK1/2 activation under apoptosis-inducing conditions. Our research demonstrates that although Raf-1 gene is not mutated, an abnormality of Raf-1 kinase feedback regulation enhances its antiapoptotic function, and Raf-1 can still be a pharmaceutical target to increase chemotherapy or radiotherapy sensitivity in these cancer cells.Oncogene advance online publication, 14 November 2016; doi:10.1038/onc.2016.384.
Helicobacter pylori employs unique methods to colonize the stomach, which induces chronic inflammation. It is also able to avoid eradication by macrophages and other immune cells. Leukocyte cell-derived chemotaxin 2 (LECT2), a multi-functional cytokine involved in many pathological conditions, has recently been shown to activate macrophages via the CD209a receptor. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the effects of LECT2 on H. pylori-infected macrophages. Macrophages were treated with recombinant LECT2, and both their ability to kill H. pylori and produce nitric oxide were analyzed. Western blot was performed to determine nuclear translocation and protein phosphorylation of p65, a subunit of nuclear factor (NF)-κB. Transfection experiments were performed to analyze the signaling pathway of LECT2 in macrophages. We found that treatment with LECT2 enhanced H. pylori killing and nitric oxide production in macrophages. In addition, DNA-binding activity and nuclear translocation of p65 were up-regulated by LECT2 treatment. Furthermore, we found that NF-κB activation by LECT2 was mediated by Raf-1 in macrophages, and Raf-1 phosphorylation was specifically altered in response to LECT2. Moreover, LECT2 induced Ser28 phosphorylation in the intracellular domain of CD209a. CD209a Ser28 phosphorylation was required for LECT2-induced Raf-1 and NF-κB activation in RAW264.7 macrophages. Our study showed that the effects of LECT2 on H. pylori killing and nitric oxide production were dependent on CD209a phosphorylation, Raf-1, and NF-κB activation. Together, these results demonstrate for the first time that exposure to LECT2 can modulate specific intracellular mechanisms downstream of CD209a to enhance H. pylori killing and nitric oxide production in macrophages.
Two new scalarane sesterterpenoids, 12β-(3'β-hydroxybutanoyloxy)-20,24-dimethyl-24-oxo-scalara-16-en-25-al (1) and 12β-(3'β-hydroxypentanoyloxy)-20,24-dimethyl-24-oxo-scalara-16-en-25-al (2), along with one known tetraprenyltoluquinol-related metabolite (3), were isolated from the sponge Carteriospongia sp. In leukemia Molt 4 cells, 1 at 0.0625 μg/mL (125 nM) triggered mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) disruption and apoptosis showing more potent effect than 2 and 3. The isolates inhibited topoisomerase IIα expression. The apoptotic-inducing effect of 3 was supported by the in vivo experiment through suppressing the volume of xenograft tumor growth (47.58%) compared with the control. Compound 1 apoptotic mechanism of action in Molt 4 cells was further elucidated through inducing ROS generation, calcium release and ER stress. Using the molecular docking analysis, 1 exhibited more binding affinity to N-terminal ATP-binding pocket of Hsp90 protein than 17-AAG, a standard Hsp90 inhibitor. The expression of Hsp90 client proteins, Akt, p70(S6k), NFκB, Raf-1, p-GSK3β, and XIAP, MDM 2 and Rb2, and CDK4 and Cyclin D3, HIF 1 and HSF1 were suppressed by the use of 1. However, the expression of Hsp70, acetylated tubulin, and activated caspase 3 were induced after 1 treatment. Our results suggested that the proapoptotic effect of the isolates is mediated through the inhibition of Hsp90 and topoisomerase activities.
Prostate cancer (PCa) is a malignant disease influencing numerous men worldwide every year. However, the exact pathogenesis and the genes, environment, and other factors involved have not been explained clearly. Some studies have proposed that cell signaling pathways might play a key role in the development and progression of PCa. According to our previous study, the RTK/ERK pathway containing nearly 40 genes was associated with PCa risk. On the basis of these genes, we conducted a meta-analysis with our own Chinese Consortium for Prostate Cancer Genetics (ChinaPCa) study and available studies in the databases to describe the association between the pathway and PCa on the SNP level. The results suggested that rs4764695/IGF1 (recessive model: pooled OR=0.92, 95%CI=0.852-0.994, P=0.034; I(2)=0%, P=0.042; allele analysis: pooled OR=0.915, 95%CI=0.874-0.958, P=0; I(2)=0%, P=0.424; codominant model: OR=0.835, 95%CI=0.762-0.916, P=0; I(2)=0%, P=0.684) and rs1570360/VEGF (recessive model: OR=0.596, 95%CI=0.421-0.843, P=0.003; I(2)=23.9%, P=0.269; codominant model: OR=0.576, 95%CI=0.404-0.820, P=0.002; I(2)=49.1%, P=0.140) were significantly associated with PCa. In subgroup analysis, the relationship was also found in Caucasians for IGF1 (dominant model: OR=0.834, 95%CI=0.769-0.904, P=0; allele analysis: OR=0.908, 95%CI=0.863-0.955, P=0; AA vs CC: OR=0.829, 95%CI=0.750-0.916, P=0; AC vs CC: OR=0.837, 95%CI=0.768-0.912, P=0). In addition, in Asians (allele analysis: OR=0.21, 95%CI=0.168-0.262, P=0) and Caucasians (recessive model: OR=0.453, 95%CI: 0.240-0.855, P=0.015; codominant model: OR=0.464, 95%CI=0.240-0.898, P=0.023) for VEGF, the association was significant. The results indicated that rs4764695/IGF1 and rs1570360/VEGF might play a key role in the development and progression of PCa. On the SNP level, we suggest that the study gives us a new view of gene-pathway analysis and targeted therapy for PCa.
Men with a family history of prostate cancer and African-American men are at high risk for prostate cancer and in need of personalized risk estimates to inform screening decisions. This study evaluated genetic variants in genes encoding microRNA (miRNA) binding sites for informing of time to prostate cancer diagnosis among ethnically diverse, high-risk men undergoing prostate cancer screening.
The Prostate Cancer Risk Assessment Program (PRAP) is a longitudinal screening program for high-risk men. The eligibility includes men aged between 35 and 69 years with a family history of prostate cancer or African descent. Participants with 1 follow-up visit were included in the analyses (n=477). Genetic variants in genes encoding miRNA binding sites (ALOX15 (arachidonate 15-lipooxygenase), IL-16, IL-18 and RAF1 (v-raf-1 murine leukemia viral oncogene homolog 1)) previously implicated in prostate cancer development were evaluated. Genotyping methods included Taqman SNP Genotyping Assay or pyrosequencing. Cox models were used to assess time to prostate cancer diagnosis by risk genotype.
Among 256 African Americans with one follow-up visit, the TT genotype at rs1131445 in IL-16 was significantly associated with earlier time to prostate cancer diagnosis vs the CC/CT genotypes (P=0.013), with a suggestive association after correction for false discovery (P=0.065). Hazard ratio after controlling for age and PSA for TT vs CC/CT among African Americans was 3.0 (95% confidence interval: 1.26-7.12). No association with time to diagnosis was detected among Caucasians by IL-16 genotype. No association with time to prostate cancer diagnosis was found for the other miRNA target genotypes.
Genetic variation in IL-16 encoding miRNA target site may be informative of time to prostate cancer diagnosis among African-American men enrolled in prostate cancer risk assessment, which may inform individualized prostate cancer screening strategies in the future.
V-raf-1 murine leukemia viral oncogene homolog 1 (Raf-1) is a key activator of the ERK pathway and is a target for cross-regulation of this pathway by the cAMP signaling system. The cAMP-activated protein kinase, PKA, inhibits Raf-1 by phosphorylation on S259. Here, we show that the cAMP-degrading phosphodiesterase-8A (PDE8A) associates with Raf-1 to protect it from inhibitory phosphorylation by PKA, thereby enhancing Raf-1's ability to stimulate ERK signaling. PDE8A binds to Raf-1 with high (picomolar) affinity. Mapping of the interaction domain on PDE8A using peptide array technology identified amino acids 454-465 as the main binding site, which could be disrupted by mutation. A cell-permeable peptide corresponding to this region disrupted the PDE8A/Raf-1 interaction in cells, thereby reducing ERK activation and the cellular response to EGF. Overexpression of a catalytically inactive PDE8A in cells displayed a dominant negative phenotype on ERK activation. These effects were recapitulated at the organism level in genetically modified (PDE8A(-/-)) mice. Similarly, PDE8 deletion in Drosophila melanogaster reduced basal ERK activation and sensitized flies to stress-induced death. We propose that PDE8A is a physiological regulator of Raf-1 signaling in some cells.
Endometriosis is a hormone-sensitive gynecological disorder characterized by the benign growth of endometrial-like tissue in the pelvic cavity. Endometriotic lesions composed of endometrial stromal cells (ESC) and glandular epithelial cells (EEC) are thought to arise from menstrual endometrial tissue reaching the pelvic cavity via retrograde menstruation. The cause of endometriotic lesion formation is still not clear. Recent evidence suggest that cytokines may play a role in the early development of endometriosis lesions. Because cytokines and growth factors signal via the v-raf-1 murine leukemia viral oncogene homolog 1 (Raf-1) kinase pathway, we have examined the role of Raf-1 in early steps of endometriosis lesion formation, specifically attachment of endometrial cells to peritoneal mesothelial cells (PMC) and invasion of endometrial cells through PMC (trans-mesothelial invasion). Raf-1 antagonist GW5074 decreased attachment to PMC and trans-mesothelial invasion by primary EEC and ESC. Raf-1 also mediated TGFβ-induced trans-mesothelial invasion by the established, low-invasive EEC line EM42. TGFβ treatment of EEC resulted in Raf-1 phosphorylation at S338 and phosphorylation of ERK, suggesting that TGFβ activates Raf-1 signaling in these cells. GW5074 had little effect on ESC proliferation but inhibited EEC growth significantly under reduced serum conditions. Antagonizing Raf-1 activity and expression via GW5074 and specific Raf-1 small interfering RNA, respectively, did not alter EEC resistance to growth inhibition by TGFβ. Raf-1 inhibition blocked induction of EEC growth by epidermal growth factor. Our data suggest that Raf-1 may mediate pathologic steps involved in early endometriosis lesion formation and may be a mediator of TGFβ and epidermal growth factor actions in endometriosis.
The ERK1/2 (extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 and 2) pathway, comprising the protein kinases RAF (v-raf-1 murine leukemia viral oncogene homolog 1), MEK1/2 (mitogen-activated protein kinase or ERK kinase 1 and 2) and ERK1/2 is frequently de-regulated in human cancers, due to mutations in RAS or BRAF (v-raf-1 murine leukemia viral oncogene homolog B1). New, highly selective inhibitors of BRAF and MEK1/2 have shown promise in clinical trials, including in previously intractable diseases such as melanoma. However, drug-resistant tumour cells invariably emerge leading to disease progression. It is important to understand the mechanisms underlying such acquired resistance since this may lead to the development of rational strategies either to delay its onset or to overcome it once established. It also offers unique insights into the plasticity of signalling pathways, which may in turn inform our understanding of the basic biology of these pathways and lead to the validation of new drug targets. Several recent reports have identified diverse mechanisms of acquired resistance to MEK1/2 or BRAF inhibitors. In this article, we review these studies, discuss the different mechanisms, identify common themes and consider their therapeutic implications.
Exposure to environmental pollutants has been linked to various airway diseases and disease exacerbations. Almost all chronic airway diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and asthma are caused by complicated interactions between gene and environment. One of the major hallmarks of those diseases is airway mucus overproduction (MO). Excessive mucus causes airway obstruction and significantly increases morbidity and mortality. Metals are major components of environmental particulate matters (PM). Among them, vanadium has been suggested to play an important role in PM-induced mucin production. Vanadium pentoxide (V(2)O(5)) is the most common commercial source of vanadium, and it has been associated with occupational chronic bronchitis and asthma, both of which are MO diseases. However, the underlying mechanism is not entirely clear. In this study, we used both in vitro and in vivo models to demonstrate the robust inductions of mucin production by V(2)O(5). Furthermore, the follow-up mechanistic study revealed a novel v-raf-1 murine leukemia viral oncogene homolog 1-IKK-NF-κB pathway that mediated V(2)O(5)-induced mucin production. Most interestingly, the reactive oxygen species and the classical mucin-inducing epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-MAPK pathway appeared not to be involved in this process. Thus the V(2)O(5)-induced mucin production may represent a novel EGFR-MAPK-independent and environmental toxicant-associated MO model. Complete elucidation of the signaling pathway in this model will not only facilitate the development of the treatment for V(2)O(5)-associated occupational diseases but also advance our understanding on the EGFR-independent mucin production in other chronic airway diseases.
Atherothrombotic cardiovascular diseases are the predominant causes of mortality of diabetic patients. Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) is the major physiological inhibitor for fibrinolysis, and it is also implicated in inflammation and tissue remodeling. Increased levels of PAI-1 and glycated low-density lipoprotein (glyLDL) were detected in patients with diabetes. Previous studies in our laboratory demonstrated that heat shock factor-1 (HSF1) is involved in glyLDL-induced PAI-1 overproduction in vascular endothelial cells (EC). The present study investigated transmembrane signaling mechanisms involved in glyLDL-induced HSF1 and PAI-1 up-regulation in cultured human vascular EC and streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice. Receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) antibody prevented glyLDL-induced increase in the abundance of PAI-1 in EC. GlyLDL significantly increased the translocation of V-Ha-Ras Harvey rat sarcoma viral oncogene homologue (H-Ras) from cytoplasm to membrane compared with LDL. Farnesyltransferase inhibitor-277 or small interference RNA against H-Ras inhibited glyLDL-induced increases in HSF1 and PAI-1 in EC. Treatment with diphenyleneiodonium, a nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase (NOX) inhibitor, blocked glyLDL-induced translocation of H-Ras, elevated abundances of HSF1 and PAI-1 in EC, and increased release of hydrogen peroxide from EC. Small interference RNA for p22(phox) prevented glyLDL-induced expression of NOX2, HSF1, and PAI-1 in EC. GlyLDL significantly increased V-raf-1 murine leukemia viral oncogene homolog 1 (Raf-1) phosphorylation. Treatment with Raf-1 inhibitor blocked glyLDL-induced increase of PAI-1 mRNA in EC. The levels of RAGE, H-Ras, NOX4, HSF1, and PAI-1 were increased in hearts of streptozotocin-diabetic mice and positively correlated with plasma glucose. The results suggest that RAGE, NOX, and H-Ras/Raf-1 are implicated in the up-regulation of HSF1 or PAI-1 in vascular EC under diabetes-associated metabolic stress.
Although recurrent gene fusions involving erythroblastosis virus E26 transformation-specific (ETS) family transcription factors are common in prostate cancer, their products are considered 'undruggable' by conventional approaches. Recently, rare targetable gene fusions involving the anaplastic lymphoma receptor tyrosine kinase (ALK) gene, have been identified in 1-5% of lung cancers, suggesting that similar rare gene fusions may occur in other common epithelial cancers, including prostate cancer. Here we used paired-end transcriptome sequencing to screen ETS rearrangement-negative prostate cancers for targetable gene fusions and identified the SLC45A3-BRAF (solute carrier family 45, member 3-v-raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B1) and ESRP1-RAF1 (epithelial splicing regulatory protein-1-v-raf-1 murine leukemia viral oncogene homolog-1) gene fusions. Expression of SLC45A3-BRAF or ESRP1-RAF1 in prostate cells induced a neoplastic phenotype that was sensitive to RAF and mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MAP2K1) inhibitors. Screening a large cohort of patients, we found that, although rare, recurrent rearrangements in the RAF pathway tend to occur in advanced prostate cancers, gastric cancers and melanoma. Taken together, our results emphasize the key role of RAF family gene rearrangements in cancer, suggest that RAF and MEK inhibitors may be useful in a subset of gene fusion-harboring solid tumors and demonstrate that sequencing of tumor transcriptomes and genomes may lead to the identification of rare targetable fusions across cancer types.
The aim of this study was to investigate the expression and function of the transient receptor potential vanilloid 2 (TRPV2) in human glioma cells. By Real-Time-PCR and western blot analysis, we found that TRPV2 messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein were expressed in benign astrocyte tissues, and its expression progressively declined in high-grade glioma tissues as histological grade increased (n = 49 cases), and in U87MG cells and in MZC, FCL and FSL primary glioma cells. To investigate the function of TRPV2 in glioma, small RNA interfering was used to silence TRPV2 expression in U87MG cells. As evaluated by RT-Profiler PCR array, siTRPV2-U87MG transfected cells displayed a marked downregulation of Fas and procaspase-8 mRNA expression, associated with upregulation of cyclin E1, cyclin-dependent kinase 2, E2F1 transcriptor factor 1, V-raf-1 murine leukemia viral oncogene homolog 1 and Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bcl-X(L)) mRNA expression. TRPV2 silencing increased U87MG cell proliferation as shown by the increased percentage of cells incorporating 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine expressing beta(III)-tubulin and rescued glioma cells to Fas-induced apoptosis. These events were dependent on extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) activation: indeed inhibition of ERK activation in siTRPV2-U87MG transfected cells by treatment with PD98059, a specific mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase inhibitor, reduced Bcl-X(L) protein levels, promoted Fas expression, and restored Akt/protein kinase B pathway activation leading to reduced U87MG cell survival and proliferation, and increased sensitivity to Fas-induced apoptosis. In addition, transfection of TRPV2 in MZC glioma cells, by inducing Fas overexpression, resulted in a reduced viability and an increased spontaneous and Fas-induced apoptosis. Overall, our findings indicate that TRPV2 negatively controls glioma cell survival and proliferation, as well as resistance to Fas-induced apoptotic cell death in an ERK-dependent manner.
The inhibition of heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) has emerged as a promising antineoplastic strategy in diverse human malignancies. Hsp90 has been predicted to be involved in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) development; however, its role in hepatocarcinogenesis remains elusive. Using chemically distinctive Hsp90 inhibitors, we show that Hsp90 capacitates the aberrant expression and activity of crucial hepatocarcinogenesis-driving factors (e.g., insulin-like growth factor receptor 1, hepatocyte growth factor receptor, protein kinase B, v-raf-1 murine leukemia viral oncogene homolog 1, and cyclin-dependent kinase 4). In vitro, Hsp90 inhibition with both geldanamycin analogs (17-allylamino-17-desmethoxygeldanamycin (17-AAG) and 17-dimethylaminoethylamino-17-desmethoxygeldanamycin (17-DMAG)) and the non-quinone compound 8-(6-iodobenzo[d][1,3]dioxol-5-ylthio)-9-(3-(isopropylamino)propyl)-9H-purin-6-amine (PU-H71) reduced the viability of various HCC cell lines, induced the simultaneous degradation of numerous hepatocarcinogenic factors, and caused substantial cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. In contrast, nontumorigenic hepatocytes were less susceptible to Hsp90 inhibition. Because conventional geldanamycin-derivate Hsp90 inhibitors induce dose-limiting liver toxicity, we tested whether novel Hsp90 inhibitors lacking the benzoquinone moiety, which has been deemed responsible for hepatotoxicity, can elicit antineoplastic activity without causing significant liver damage. In HCC xenograft mouse models, PU-H71 was retained in tumors at pharmacologically relevant concentrations while being rapidly cleared from nontumorous liver. PU-H71 showed potent and prolonged in vivo Hsp90 inhibitory activity and reduced tumor growth without causing toxicity.
Hsp90 constitutes a promising therapeutic target in HCC. Non-quinone Hsp90 inhibitors exhibit tumor-specific accumulation and exert potent antineoplastic activity without causing significant hepatotoxicity.
There is an increased risk of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) in human diabetes mellitus. We therefore examined the influence of hyperglycaemia and glucose-lowering treatment on nephrocarcinogenesis in rats.
Rats (n = 850), which were either spontaneously diabetic, streptozotocin-diabetic or normoglycaemic, were examined with special reference to Armanni-Ebstein lesions (AEL).
Irrespective of the cause of diabetes, diabetic but not normoglycaemic rats developed typical glycogenotic clear-cell AEL. AEL showed strong proliferative activity, which was nearly completely inhibited by EGF receptor blockade (Gefitinib treatment). Many findings suggested a stepwise development of RCCs from AEL. Whereas the number and size of RCCs gradually increased in all diabetic groups, beginning at 6 months after onset of diabetes, normoglycaemic controls did not developed RCC. After 28 months, up to 82% of diabetic animals had at least one RCC. In contrast to the proximal tubules, the distal tubular system, including glycogenotic AEL, had the same levels of enzyme activities as RCC (e.g. high glycogen phosphorylase and synthase activity, lack of glucose 6-phosphatase activity) and the same expression patterns of cytokeratin 7 and several growth factors, along with their receptors and signal transduction proteins (TGF-alpha, EGF receptor, IGF-I, IGF-I receptor, IGF-II receptor, insulin receptor substrate 1, v-raf-1 murine leukemia viral oncogene homologue 1 and mitogen activated protein kinase kinase 1). In addition, direct morphological transitions between distal tubules, AEL and RCCs were frequently observed. All these findings indicate a common origin and a precursor-product relationship of AEL and RCCs.
Nephrocarcinogenesis in diabetic rats results from sustained hyperglycaemia, resulting in an adaptive metabolic response, altered growth factor signalling and subsequent neoplastic transformation of the tubular epithelial cells.
Prior studies have shown that bladder trauma occurring during transurethral bladder tumor resection increases urinary levels of the cytokine transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta1. This study used complementary deoxyribonucleic acid micro-array technology to identify additional genes in human transitional cell carcinoma (TCC), whose expression is altered as a consequence of increased urinary levels of TGF-beta1.
The human TCC line 253J was cultured in standard media, or media spiked with either 10% post-transurethral bladder tumor resection urine (PTU), or PTU and anti-TGF-beta1 neutralizing antibody. Messenger ribonucleic acid from these conditions, together with messenger ribonucleic acid from stably transfected 253J cells over-expressing TGF-beta1, was hybridized with ATLAS micro-array membranes (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) containing 588 human genes. Hybridization signal intensity was quantified using phospho-imaging. An analytic strategy based on the variance in the signal intensity ratio of specific housekeeping genes in control and experimental comparisons was used to identify significant changes in gene expression. Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction of target genes was used to confirm gene over-expression and TGF-beta1 responsiveness.
Seven genes were identified on micro-array: v-RAF-1, colony stimulating factor-1 receptor, v-FGR, insulin growth factor-1 receptor, epidermal growth factor receptor, alpha5 integrin, and interferon receptor-1. Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction confirmed over-expression in the autocrine TGF-beta1 producing cell line and increased expression in response to exogenous TGF-beta1.
TGF-beta1 in PTU alters the expression of multiple genes in human TCC in vitro. The impact of these changes on the biologic phenotype of the malignant cell and the efficacy of adjuvant therapies requires further evaluation.
We performed microarray analyses on RNA from human intestinal epithelial (HT-29) cells treated with the cytotoxic enterotoxin (Act) of Aeromonas hydrophila to examine global cellular transcriptional responses. Based on three independent experiments, Act upregulated the expression of 34 genes involved in cell growth, adhesion, signaling, immune responses (including interleukin-8 [IL-8] production), and apoptosis. We verified the upregulation of 14 genes by real-time reverse transcriptase-PCR and confirmed Act-induced production of IL-8 by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay on supernatants from nonpolarized and polarized HT-29 cells. Maximal production of IL-8 in response to Act required the presence of intracellular calcium, since chelation of calcium with BAPTA-AM significantly reduced Act-induced IL-8 production in HT-29 cells. We also examined activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases and, as demonstrated by Western blot analysis of apical side-treated polarized HT-29 cells, Act induced phosphorylation of p38, c-Jun NH(2)-terminal kinase, and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2. In addition, KinetWorks proteomics screening of whole-cell lysates revealed Act-induced phosphorylation of cyclic AMP-response element binding protein (CREB), c-Jun, adducin, protein kinase C, and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) and decreased phosphorylation of protein kinase Balpha, v-raf-1 murine leukemia viral oncogene homolog 1 (i.e., Raf1), and STAT1. We verified activation of CREB and activator protein 1 in polarized cells by gel shift assay. This is the first description of human intestinal epithelial cell transcriptional alterations, phosphorylation or activation of signaling molecules, cytokine production, and calcium mobilization in response to this toxin.
To establish the DNA methylation patterns of the promoter CpG islands of 14 "drug-resistance" genes in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).
The methylation specific polymerase chain reaction in conjunction with sequencing verification was used to establish the methylation patterns of the 14 genes in the liver tissues of four healthy liver donors, as well as tumor and the paired non-cancerous tissues of 30 HCC patients.
While 11 genes (ATP-binding cassette, sub-family G (WHITE), member 2(ABCG2), activating transcription factor (ATF2), beta-2-microglobulin (B2M), deoxycytidine kinase (DCK), occludin (OCLN), v-raf-1 murine leukemia viral oncogene homolog (RAF1), ralA binding protein 1 (RALBP1), splicing factor (45 kD) (SPF45), S-phase kinase-associated protein 2 (p45) (SKP2), tumor protein p53 (Li-Fraumeni syndrome) (TP53) and topoisomerase (DNA) II beta (TOP2B)) maintained the unmethylated patterns, three genes displayed to various extents the hypermethylation state in tumor tissues in comparison with the normal counterparts. The catalase (CAT) was hypermethylated in tumor and the neighboring non-cancerous tissue of one case (3.3%). Both glutathione S-transferase pi (GSTpi) (80%, 24/30 in tumor and 56.7%, 17/30 in the paired non-cancerous tissues) and cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator, ATP-binding cassette (sub-family C, member 7) (CFTR) (77%, 23/30 in tumor and 50%, 15/30 in the paired non-cancerous tissues) genes were prevalently hypermethylated in HCC as well as their neighboring non-cancerous tissues. No significant difference in the hypermethylation occurrence was observed between the HCC and its neighboring non-cancerous tissues.
Hypermethylation of promoter CpG islands of both CFTR and GSTpi genes occurs prevalently in HCC, which may correlate with the low expression of these two genes at the mRNA level and has the profound etiological and clinical implications. It is likely to be specific to the early phase of HCC carcinogenesis.
A comparative map of human chromosome 3 (HSA 3) and pig chromosome 13 (SSC 13) was constructed using physically assigned pig sequence-tagged sites (STSs). Pig STSs representing 11 HSA 3 genes, including v-Raf-1 murine leukemia viral oncogene homolog 1 (RAF1), retinoic acid beta receptor (RARB), cholecystokinin (CCK), pituitary transcription factor 1 (POU1F1), ceruloplasmin (CP), guanine nucleotide binding protein, alpha-inhibiting polypeptide 2 (GNAI2), sucrase-isomaltase (SI), rhodopsin (RHO), dopamine receptor D3 (DRD3), growth-associated protein 43 (GAP43), and somatostatin (SST), were developed. Ten pig STSs were regionally mapped using a somatic cell hybrid panel (SCHP) to SSC 13 with 80-100% concordance. Large-insert probes were obtained by screening a pig yeast artificial chromosome (YAC) library with primers for each STS. Several YACs were identified for DRD3, GAP43, POU1F1, RHO, SI, and SST for fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) mapping. Single gene and bi-color FISH with each pairwise combination were used to further define the gene order on SSC 13. While these data confirm chromosome painting results showing that HSA 3 probes hybridize to a major portion of SSC 13, they also demonstrate extensive gene-order differences between man and pig within this large conserved synteny group. Interestingly, several conserved chromosomal regions have been detected between pig and mouse that are not conserved between man and mouse, suggesting that the SSC 13 gene arrangement may be the closest to that of the ancestral eutherian chromosome.
Activating the protein-tyrosine kinase activity of v-Fps leads to the rapid transcriptional activation of the Egr-1 gene, which encodes a mitogen-responsive transcription factor. Activation of Egr-1 by v-Fps was insensitive to protein kinase C depletion, suggesting that a protein kinase C-independent signal activated by v-Fps leads to the induction of Egr-1. Expression of v-Fps in transient expression assays induced Egr-1 promoter activation. v-HaRas and v-Raf also activated the Egr-1 promoter. To characterize HaRas and Raf-1 involvement in v-Fps-induced Egr-1 expression, we used recently characterized dominant negative mutants of HaRas and Raf-1. v-Fps-induced Egr-1 promoter activation was inhibited by the dominant negative mutants of both HaRas and Raf-1. v-HaRas-induced Egr-1 promoter activation was blocked by the negative Raf-1 mutant; however, v-Raf-1-induced Egr-1 promoter activation was unaffected by the inhibitory HaRas mutant. These data suggest that v-Fps activates a protein kinase C-independent intracellular signaling pathway that is dependent on both HaRas and Raf-1, where Raf-1 functions downstream of HaRas.
Homologs to genes residing on human chromosome 3 (HSA 3) map to four mouse chromosomes (MMU) 3, 6, 9, and 16. In the bovine, two syntenic groups that contain HSA 3 homologs, unassigned syntenic groups 10 (U10) and 12 (U12), have been defined. U10 also contains HSA 21 genes, which is similar to the situation seen on MMU 16, whereas U12 apparently contains only HSA 3 homologs. The syntenic arrangement of other HSA 3 homologs in the bovine was investigated by physically mapping five genes through segregation analysis of a bovine-hamster hybrid somatic cell panel. The genes mapped include Friend-murine leukemia virus integration site 3 homolog (FIM3; HSA 3/MMU 3), sucrase-isomaltase (SI) and glutathione peroxidase 1 (GPX1) (HSA 3/MMU ?), murine leukemia viral (v-raf-1) oncogene homolog 1 (RAF1; HSA 3/MMU 6), and ceruloplasmin (CP; HSA 3/MMU 9). FIM3, SI, and CP mapped to bovine syntenic group U10, while RAF1 and GPX1 mapped to U12.
Choline kinase (ChoK) is a cytosolic enzyme present in various tissues, which catalyzes the phosphorylation of choline to form phosphorylcholine (PCho) in the presence of ATP and magnesium. ChoK is important for the generation of two major membrane phospholipids, phosphatidylcholine (PC) and sphingomyelin (SM) and subsequently for the cell division. ChoK plays a vital role in cell signaling pathways and regulation of cell growth along with PCho involved in malignant transformation through ras oncogenes in different cancers such as breast, lung, colon, prostate, neuroblastoma, hepatic lymphomas, meningiomas and diverse murine tumours. The Ras effectors serine/threonine kinase (Raf-1), the Ral-GDP dissociation stimulator (Ral-GDS) and the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) are involved in the activation of ChoK during tumorigenesis. ChoK gene induction seems to be associated with certain cell stress or cell defense. Nowadays, RNAi appear to be one of the most promising routes in the cancer therapy. The anticancer potential of both stable expression of siRNAs and their high sequence specificity by RNAi mediated suppression of oncogenic ras in human pancreatic carcinoma, human melanomas and ovarian cancer has been observed. It has an important role in sequence specific post-transcriptional gene silencing mechanism. Presently, the crystal structure of Caenorhabditis elegans choline kinase A-2 (ChoKA-2) is available, which may be useful for comparative modeling of human ChoK and further modeling studies. The present review aims at the general overview of importance, expression, structure, progress in molecular modeling, active site analysis and inhibitors of ChoK. It also highlights the recent role of ChoK in various types of Ras-dependent and Ras-independent carcinogenesis.
The lethal toxin (LT) from Clostridium sordellii, which belongs to the family of large clostridial cytotoxins, acts as a monoglucosyltransferase for the Rho subfamily GTPase Rac and also modifies Ras. In the present study we investigated structural changes of H-Ras in its di- and triphosphate form that occur upon glucosylation of the effector domain amino acid threonine-35 by LT. (31)P NMR experiments recorded during the enzymatic glucosylation process, using UDP-glucose as a cosubstrate, show that the modification of the threonine side chain influences the chemical shifts of the phosphate groups of the bound nucleotides. In the diphosphate-bound form (Ras.GDP) glucosylation of Thr35 induces only small changes in the chemical environment of the active center. In the triphosphate form with the GTP analogue GppNHp bound (Ras.GppNHp) Ras shows at least two different conformations in the active center that exchange on a medium-range time scale (10 to 0.1 ms). Glucosylation selectively stabilizes one distinct conformation of the effector loop (state 1) with tyrosine-32 probably apart from the nucleotide and threonine-35 not involved in magnesium ion coordination. This conformation is known to have a low affinity to effector proteins such as Raf-1, AF-6, or Byr2 and thus prevents the transduction of the activation signal in the Ras-mediated pathway. NMR correlation spectra of Ras(T35glc).GDP and denaturation experiments with urea indicate that the glucose is bound in the alpha-anomeric form to the hydroxyl group of the threonine-35 side chain. Inhibition of the glucosylation reaction by 1,5-gluconolactone suggests a stereospecific reaction mechanism with a glucosyl oxonium ion transition state for the enzymatic activity of LT.
The c-Raf-1 protein kinase plays a central role in the mitogenic response of cells to growth factors, cytokines, and many oncogenes. Despite the critical importance of this enzyme, very little is known of its biochemical properties or mechanisms of regulation. In these experiments, we used the only candidate physiologic substrate identified as yet for c-Raf-1, mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MAPKK), to examine enzymatic characteristics and candidate modulators of c-Raf-1, c-Raf-1 was purified from Sf9 cells infected with recombinant baculovirus encoding a histidine-tagged c-Raf-1. The Km values of c-Raf-1 for ATP and MAPKK were 11.6 microM and 0.8 microM, respectively, and the stoichiometry of phosphorylation of MAPKK by c-Raf-1 was 1.67 mol of phosphate per mol of MAPKK. In contrast to prior reports, Mg2+ was the preferred cation at Mg2+ and Mn2+ concentrations &gt; 5 mM. c-Raf-1 substrate specificity was extremely restricted, consistent with the identification of only one candidate physiologic substrate to date and highlighting the necessity of using MAPKK rather than artificial substrates in c-Raf-1 activity assays. Of multiple potential substrates tested, the only one phosphorylated to &gt; 20% of the level of MAPKK phosphorylation was myelin basic protein (22%). Heat-denatured MAPKK was phosphorylated at only 2% the level of native MAPKK, indicating that the restricted substrate specificity may be due to tertiary-structural requirements. We also examined whether c-Raf-1 activity is modulated by lipid binding to the cysteine finger region in its regulatory domain. Of multiple mitogen-stimulated or cell-membrane lipids tested, only phosphatidylserine and diacylglycerol in the presence of Ca2+ (2.5 mM) increased c-Raf-1 kinase activity significantly (1.5-fold). The increase is probably not of physiologic significance because it was about two orders of magnitude less than the stimulation of protein kinase C by these lipids. On gel-filtration chromatography, the peak of c-Raf-1 kinase activity and immunoreactivity eluted at a predicted molecular mass of &gt; 150 kDa, suggesting that active c-Raf-1 (but not inactive c-Raf-1) exists as a multimeric complex. This complex may not include p21ras, however, because immunoreactive p21ras was not identified in the active fractions.
The statin family of drugs are well-established inhibitors of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase and are used clinically in the control of hypercholesterolemia. Recent evidence, from ourselves and others, shows that statins can also trigger tumor-specific apoptosis by blocking protein geranylgeranylation. We and others have proposed that statins disrupt localization and function of geranylgeranylated proteins responsible for activating signal transduction pathways essential for the growth and/or survival of transformed cells. To explore this further, we have investigated whether the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling cascades play a role in regulating statin-induced apoptosis. Cells derived from acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) are used as our model system. We show that p38 and c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase/stress-activated kinase MAPK pathways are not altered during lovastatin-induced apoptosis. By contrast, exposure of primary and established AML cells to statins results in significant disruption of basal extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2 phosphorylation. Addition of geranylgeranyl PPi reverses statin-induced loss of ERK1/2 phosphorylation and apoptosis. By establishing and evaluating the inducible Raf-1:ER system in AML cells, we show that constitutive activation of the Raf/MAPK kinase (MEK)/ERK pathway significantly represses but does not completely block lovastatin-induced apoptosis. Our results strongly suggest statins trigger apoptosis by regulating several signaling pathways, including the Raf/MEK/ERK pathway. Indeed, down-regulation of the Raf/MEK/ERK pathway potentiates statin-induced apoptosis because exposure to the MEK1 inhibitor PD98059 sensitizes AML cells to low, physiologically achievable concentrations of lovastatin. Our study suggests that lovastatin, alone or in combination with a MEK1 inhibitor, may represent a new and immediately available therapeutic approach to combat tumors with activated ERK1/2, such as AML.
Recently, some findings support the (pro) renin-(Pro) renin receptor (P) RR interaction at exceptionally high (pro) renin levels in vitro. The aim of this study was to investigate the roles of cardiac (P) RR and its downward signals on mean arterial pressure (MAP) in rats with abdominal aortic constriction, following treatment of handle region peptide (HRP) and phospholipase C-β3 (PLC-b3) inhibitor, U73122.
Seventy-five SD rats were divided into 5 groups (n=15 each group) as following: sham operated (SO), rats with the aortic ligation (AL), AL rats were given HRP (4 μg kg d, SC), AL rats given U73122 (40 μg kg d, SC) and AL rats given HRP+U73122. MAP was recorded using a tail-cuff method. After 4 weeks of treatment, levels of (P) RR, PLC-b3, PKC-a and ERK1/2 in the heart were examined by RT-PCR and western blot.
The levels of (P) RR and PLC-b3 significantly increased in the left ventricle in hypertensive rats (P &lt; 0.01), respectively. MAP rose markedly (P &lt; 0.01). HRP decreased the level of (P) RR and U73122 suppressed PLC-b3 expression. Treatment of both HRP and U73122 significantly decreased levels of PKC-a, ERK1/2 and Raf-1 in the heart (P &lt; 0.001). Meanwhile, MAP was decreased after treatment.
This study demonstrates that (P) RR inhibitor, HRP and PLC-b3 inhibitor, U73122 decreased levels of (P) RR, PLC-b3, PKC-a, ERK1/2 and Raf-1 in the heart. Meanwhile, administration of both reagents lowered MAP. These findings indicate that cardiac (P) RR may activate PLC-b3, PKC, ERK1/2 and Raf-1 signals and lead to hypertension.
This study was supported by the Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 81270336).
Gastric carcinoma is one of the most lethal malignancies of cancers and its prognosis remains dismal due to the paucity of effective therapeutic targets. Herein, we showed that HRAS is markedly up-regulated in gastric carcinoma. Prognostic analysis indicated that HRAS expression might be a prognostic indicator for the survival of patients with gastric carcinoma. Ectopic expression of HRAS in gastric carcinoma cells accelerated proliferation, migration, invasion, angiogenesis, and clone formation ability of gastric carcinoma cells in vitro. Furthermore, HRAS over-expressing significantly promoted the tumorigenicity of gastric carcinoma cells in vivo whereas silencing endogenous HRAS caused opposite outcomes. Moreover, we demonstrated that HRAS enhanced gastric carcinoma aggressiveness by activating VEGFA/PI3K/AKT pathway and Raf-1 signaling. Together, our results provide new evidence that HRAS overexpression promotes the progression of gastric carcinoma and might represent a novel therapeutic target for its treatment.
Aurora kinase A (AURKA) is an oncogenic serine/threonine kinase, it plays important roles in tumorigenesis and chemoresistance. In this study, we investigated the expression of AURKA in lung adenocarcinoma tissues, the role of small interference RNA targeting AURKA on growth, cell cycle, and apoptosis of lung adenocarcinoma cell lines in vitro. The AURKA is highly expressed in lung adenocarcinoma tissues and human lung adenocarcinoma cell lines. Lentivirus-mediated short hairpin RNA (shRNA) was used to knock down AURKA expression in human lung adenocarcinoma cell lines H1299 and A549. The results indicated that depletion of AURKA could inhibit cell growth, cause cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. The potential mechanisms of AURKA inhibition induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis are associated with downregulated RAF-1, CCND2, CCND3, CDK4, PAK4, EGFR and upregulated WEE1 expression. Furthermore, AURKA knockdown cooperated with vincristine (VCR) to repress A549 cell proliferation. Therefore, AURKA plays important roles in the proliferation of human lung adenocarcinoma cells, which suggests that AURKA could be a promising tool for lung adenocarcinoma therapy.
Mutations in the translocated BCL2 gene are often detected in diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (DLBCLs), indicating both their significance and pervasiveness. Large series genome sequencing of more than 200 DLBCLs has identified frequent BCL2 mutations clustered in the exons coding for the BH4 domain and the folded loop domain (FLD) of the protein. However, BCL2 mutations are mostly contemplated to represent bystander events with negligible functional impact on the pathogenesis of DLBCL. BCL2 arbitrates apoptosis through a classic interaction between its hydrophobic groove forming BH1-3 domains and the BH3 domain of pro-apoptotic members of the BCL2 family. The effects of mutations are mainly determined by the ability of the mutated BCL2 to mediate apoptosis by this inter-member protein binding. Nevertheless, BCL2 regulates diverse non-canonical pathways that are unlikely to be explained by canonical interactions. In this review, first, we identify recurrent missense mutations in the BH4 domain and the FLD reported in independent lymphoma sequencing studies. Second, we discuss the probable consequences of mutations on the binding ability of BCL2 to non-BCL2 family member proteins crucial for 1) maintaining mitochondrial energetics and calcium hemostasis such as VDAC, IP3R, and RyR and 2) oncogenic pathways implicated in the acquisition of the 'hallmarks of cancer' such as SOD, Raf-1, NFAT, p53, HIF-1α, and gelsolin. The study also highlights the likely ramifications of mutations on binding of BCL2 antagonists and BH3 profiling. Based on our analysis, we believe that an in-depth focus on BCL2 interactions mediated by these domains is warranted to elucidate the functional significance of missense mutations in DLBCL. In summary, we provide an extensive overview of the pleiotropic functions of BCL2 mediated by its physical binding interaction with other proteins and the various ways BCL2 mutations would affect the normal function of the cell leading to the development of DLBCL.
Silodosin, a selective α1A-adrenergic blocker prescribed for the symptomatic treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia, was previously shown to decrease the expression of ELK1, a c-fos proto-oncogene regulator and a well-described downstream target of the PKC/Raf-1/ERK pathway, in human prostate smooth muscle cells. PKC/Raf-1/ERK activation has also been implicated in drug resistance. In the current study, we assessed the effects of silodosin on ELK1 expression/activity in bladder cancer cells as well as on their proliferation in the presence or absence of chemotherapeutic drugs, including cisplatin and gemcitabine. In bladder cancer cell lines, silodosin reduced the expression of ELK1 (mRNA/protein) and its downstream target, c-fos gene, as well as the transcriptional activity of ELK1. While silodosin alone (up to 10 μM) insignificantly affected the growth of bladder cancer cells cultured in androgen depleted conditions or those expressing ELK1-short hairpin RNA, it considerably inhibited the viability of androgen receptor (AR)-positive/ELK1-positive cells in the presence of androgens. Silodosin also inhibited the migration of ELK1-positive cells with or without a functional AR, but not that of ELK1 knockdown cells. Interestingly, silodosin treatment or ELK1 silencing resulted in increases in drug sensitivity to cisplatin, but not to gemcitabine, even in AR-negative cells or AR-positive cells cultured in an androgen-depleted condition. In addition, silodosin decreased the expression of NF-κB, a key regulator of chemoresistance, and its transcriptional activity. Moreover, immunohistochemistry in bladder cancer specimens from patients who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy revealed that phospho-ELK1 positivity strongly correlated with chemoresistance. Silodosin was thus found to not only inhibit cell viability and migration but also enhance the cytotoxic activity of cisplatin in bladder cancer lines via inactivating ELK1. Our results suggest that combined treatment with silodosin is useful for overcoming chemoresistance in patients with ELK1-positive urothelial carcinoma receiving cisplatin.
Melatonin exerts a protective effect during hepatic ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury through modulation of the apoptotic cell death program. Mitogen-activated protein kinases mediate various intracellular processes such as cell differentiation, survival, and death. This study investigated whether melatonin exerts a protective effect through the activation of Raf-MEK-ERK and its downstream targets, including 90 ribosomal S6 kinase (p90RSK) and Bad, during hepatic I/R damage.
Hepatic ischemia was induced in mice by occlusion of the hepatic artery, portal vein, and bile duct. Adult mice were subjected to 1 h of hepatic ischemia and 3 h of reperfusion. Vehicle or melatonin (10 mg/kg, intraperitoneal) was injected 15 min before ischemia and just before reperfusion. Serum aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase levels were measured, and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick-end labeling histochemistry was performed. Moreover, Western blot and immunoprecipitation analyses were performed.
Melatonin treatment attenuated hepatic I/R-induced increases in alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase levels and also ameliorated hepatic injury-induced pathologic lesions and increases of positive terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick-end labeling staining in hepatic tissues. Hepatic I/R injury induced decreases in the phosphorylation of Raf-1, MEK1/2, and extracellular-regulated kinase (ERK)1/2, whereas melatonin attenuated decreases in these phosphorylation levels. Moreover, melatonin prevented the injury-induced decreases in phosphorylation of downstream targets, p90RSK and Bad. Immunoprecipitation analysis showed that the interaction between phospho-Bad and 14-3-3 was decreased in vehicle-treated animals, while melatonin prevented this decrease. Melatonin also attenuated the injury-induced increase in cleaved caspase-3. In cultured hepatocytes, melatonin treatment prevented the hydrogen peroxide-induced cell death and decrease in phosphorylation of ERK1/2. Moreover, blocking MEK by PD98059 attenuated the effect of melatonin.
These data suggest that melatonin protects hepatic cells against hepatic I/R damage through the activation of the Raf-MEK-ERK cascade and phosphorylation of its downstream targets.
Neuroendocrine neoplasms are a low-incidence and heterogeneous group of malignancies. In the advanced stage, several therapeutic options can be discussed, including molecular-targeted agents, but biological predicting factors are lacking. A number of molecular targets have been studied over the last decade leading to several phase II studies; however, very few agents progressed to phase III clinical trials. The RAF family of proteins belongs to the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, that has a role in several types of cancers, particularly related to BRAF mutations. Indeed BRAF inhibitors have been reported as being effective, mainly in melanoma. However, in neuroendocrine neoplasms BRAF mutations are extremely rare and RAF-1 activation has been reported to inhibit tumor growth in a pre-clinical setting. Therefore, in this field, RAF-1 activators rather than BRAF inhibitors should be clinically investigated. This article reviews the basic science as well as clinical data of RAF signaling in advanced neuroendocrine neoplasms with special emphasis on the potential role of both RAF activators and inhibitors.
Hyperalgesia often occurs in opioid-induced withdrawal syndrome. In the present study, we found that three hourly injections of DAMGO (a μ-opioid receptor agonist) followed by naloxone administration at the fourth hour significantly decreased rat paw nociceptive threshold, indicating the induction of withdrawal hyperalgesia. Application of NaHS (a hydrogen sulfide donor) together with each injection of DAMGO attenuated naloxone-precipitated withdrawal hyperalgesia. RT-PCR and Western blot analysis showed that NaHS significantly reversed the gene and protein expression of up-regulated spinal calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) in naloxone-treated animals. NaHS also inhibited naloxone-induced cAMP rebound and cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) phosphorylation in rat spinal cord. In SH-SY5Y neuronal cells, NaHS inhibited forskolin-stimulated cAMP production and adenylate cyclase (AC) activity. Moreover, NaHS pre-treatment suppressed naloxone-stimulated activation of protein kinase C (PKC) α, Raf-1, and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2 in rat spinal cord. Our data suggest that H2S prevents the development of opioid withdrawal-induced hyperalgesia via suppression of synthesis of CGRP in spine through inhibition of AC/cAMP and PKC/Raf-1/ERK pathways.
Primary Sjögren syndrome (pSS) is an autoimmune disorder characterized by an epithelial injury surrounded by dense lymphocytic infiltrates. The conditions for the long-term maintenance of human salivary gland epithelial cells from pSS patients and a co-culture system with pSS lymphocytes were used to assess the effect of Rituximab (RTX) on the inflammatory condition and progression in pSS. Quantitative real-time PCR, genes and protein array analysis, Western blot, flow cytometry, small interfering RNA transfection and nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) DNA binding assays were used as methods. Supporting the benefits of RTX, this study demonstrates that RTX decreases NF-κB activity and interrupts the NF-κB signalling pathway through the up-regulation of the Raf-1 kinase inhibitor protein (RKIP). Over-expression of RKIP down-regulates interleukins, their receptors and the expression of genes encodes proteins that attracted lymphocytes. Silencing of the RKIP gene leads to significantly increased expression and release of pro-inflammatory mediators supporting that RKIP expression could be involved in the suppression of NF-κB activation in pSS salivary gland epithelial cells.
Androgen receptor (AR)-mediated signaling is necessary for prostate cancer cell proliferation and an important target for therapeutic drug development. Canonically, AR signals through a genomic or transcriptional pathway, involving the translocation of androgen-bound AR to the nucleus, its binding to cognate androgen response elements on promoter, with ensuing modulation of target gene expression, leading to cell proliferation. However, prostate cancer cells can show dose-dependent proliferation responses to androgen within minutes, without the need for genomic AR signaling. This proliferation response known as the non-genomic AR signaling is mediated by cytoplasmic AR, which facilitates the activation of kinase-signaling cascades, including the Ras-Raf-1, phosphatidyl-inositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt and protein kinase C (PKC), which in turn converge on mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) activation, leading to cell proliferation. Further, since activated ERK may also phosphorylate AR and its coactivators, the non-genomic AR signaling may enhance AR genomic activity. Non-genomic AR signaling may occur in an ERK-independent manner, via activation of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway, or modulation of intracellular Ca(2+) concentration through plasma membrane G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). These data suggest that therapeutic strategies aimed at preventing AR nuclear translocation and genomic AR signaling alone may not completely abrogate AR signaling. Thus, elucidation of mechanisms that underlie non-genomic AR signaling may identify potential mechanisms of resistance to current anti-androgens and help developing novel therapies that abolish all AR signaling in prostate cancer.
Y-box-binding protein-1 (YB-1) is known to conduct various functions related to cell proliferation, anti-apoptosis, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, and castration resistance in prostate cancer. However, it is still unknown how YB-1 affects cancer biology, especially its correlations with the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway. Therefore, we aimed to examine the interaction between YB-1 and the MAPK pathway in prostate cancer.
Quantitative real-time PCR, Western blotting, and co-immunoprecipitation assay were conducted in prostate cancer cells. YB-1, phosphorylated YB-1 (p-YB-1), and ERK2 protein expressions in 165 clinical specimens of prostate cancer were investigated by immunohistochemistry. YB-1, p-YB-1, and ERK2 nuclear expressions were compared with clinicopathologic characteristics and patient prognoses.
EGF upregulated p-YB-1, whereas MEK inhibitor (U0126, PD98059) decreased p-YB-1. Inversely, silencing of YB-1 using siRNA decreased the expression of ERK2 and phosphorylated MEK, ERK1/2, and RSK. Furthermore, YB-1 interacted with ERK2 and Raf-1 and regulated their expressions, through the proteasomal pathway. Immunohistochemical staining showed a significant correlation among the nuclear expressions of YB-1, p-YB-1, and ERK2. The Cox proportional hazards model revealed that high ERK2 expression was an independent prognostic factor [HR, 7.947; 95% confidence interval (CI), 3.527-20.508; P&lt;0.0001].
We revealed the functional relationship between YB-1 and MAPK signaling and its biochemical relevance to the progression of prostate cancer. In addition, ERK2 expression was an independent prognostic factor. These findings suggest that both the ERK pathway and YB-1 may be promising molecular targets for prostate cancer diagnosis and therapeutics.
Excessive alcohol consumption is associated with most cases of chronic pancreatitis, a progressive necrotizing inflammatory disease that can result in pancreatic insufficiency due to acinar atrophy and fibrosis and an increased risk of pancreatic cancer. At a cellular level acute alcohol exposure can sensitize pancreatic acinar cells to secretagogue stimulation, resulting in dysregulation of intracellular Ca(2+) homeostasis and premature digestive enzyme activation; however, the molecular mechanisms by which ethanol exerts these toxic effects have remained undefined. In this study we identify Raf-1 kinase inhibitory protein as an essential mediator of ethanol-induced sensitization of cholecystokinin- and carbachol-regulated Ca(2+) signaling in pancreatic acinar cells. We show that exposure of rodent acinar cells to ethanol induces protein kinase C-dependent Raf-1 kinase inhibitory protein phosphorylation, sensitization of cholecystokinin-stimulated Ca(2+) signaling, and potentiation of both basal and cholecystokinin-stimulated extracellular signal-regulated kinase activation. Furthermore, we show that either suppression of Raf-1 kinase inhibitory protein expression using short hairpin RNA or gene ablation prevented the sensitizing effects of ethanol on cholecystokinin- and carbachol-stimulated Ca(2+) signaling and intracellular chymotrypsin activation in pancreatic acinar cells, suggesting that the modulation of Raf-1 inhibitory protein expression may have future therapeutic utility in the prevention or treatment of alcohol-associated pancreatitis.
Glioma cells with stem cell properties, termed glioma stem-like cells (GSCs), have been linked to tumor formation, maintenance, and progression and are responsible for the failure of chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Because conventional glioma treatments often fail to eliminate GSCs completely, residual surviving GSCs are able to repopulate the tumor. Compounds that target GSCs might be helpful in overcoming resistance to anticancer treatments in human brain tumors. In this study, we showed that 5-bromo-3-(3-hydroxyprop-1-ynyl)-2H-pyran-2-one (BHP), a new 2-pyrone derivative, suppressed the maintenance of the GSC population in both a glioma cell line and patient-derived glioma cells. Treatment of GSCs with BHP effectively inhibited sphere formation and suppressed the CD133(+) cell population. Treatment with BHP also suppressed expression of the stemness-regulating transcription factors Sox2, Notch2, and β-catenin in sphere-cultured glioma cells. Treatment of GSCs with BHP significantly suppressed two fundamental characteristics of cancer stem cells: self-renewal and tumorigenicity. BHP treatment dramatically inhibited clone-forming ability at the single-cell level and suppressed in vivo tumor formation. BHP markedly inhibited both phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Akt and Ras/Raf-1/extracellular signal-regulated kinase signaling, which suggests that one or both of these pathways are involved in BHP-induced suppression of GSCs. In addition, treatment with BHP effectively sensitized GSCs to chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Taken together, these results indicate that BHP targets GSCs and enhances their sensitivity to anticancer treatments and suggest that BHP treatment may be useful for treating brain tumors by eliminating GSCs.
Endometriosis is a disease characterized by the localization of endometrial tissue outside the uterine cavity. The differences observed in migration of human endometrial stromal cells (hESC) obtained from patients with endometriosis versus healthy controls were proposed to correlate with the abnormal activation of Raf-1/ROCKII signalling pathway. To evaluate the mechanism by which Raf-1 regulates cytoskeleton reorganization and motility, we used primary eutopic (Eu-, n = 16) and ectopic (Ec-, n = 8; isolated from ovarian cysts) hESC of patients with endometriosis and endometriosis-free controls (Co-hESC, n = 14). Raf-1 siRNA knockdown in Co- and Eu-hESC resulted in contraction and decreased migration versus siRNA controls. This phenotype was reversed following the re-expression of Raf-1 in these cells. Lowest Raf-1 levels in Ec-hESC were associated with hyperactivated ROCKII and ezrin/radixin/moesin (E/R/M), impaired migration and a contracted phenotype similar to Raf-1 knockdown in Co- and Eu-hESC. We further show that the mechanism by which Raf-1 mediates migration in hESC includes direct myosin light chain phosphatase (MYPT1) phosphorylation and regulation of the levels of E/R/M, paxillin, MYPT1 and myosin light chain (MLC) phosphorylation indirectly via the hyperactivation of ROCKII kinase. Furthermore, we suggest that in contrast to Co-and Eu-hESC, where the cellular Raf-1 levels regulate the rate of migration, the low cellular Raf-1 content in Ec-hESC, might ensure their restricted migration by preserving the contracted cellular phenotype. In conclusion, our findings suggest that cellular levels of Raf-1 adjust the threshold of hESC migration in endometriosis.
Hsp90 is an abundant protein in mammalian cells. It forms several discrete complexes, each containing distinct groups of co-chaperones that assist protein folding and refolding during stress, protein transport and degradation. It interacts with a variety of proteins that play key roles in breast neoplasia including estrogen receptors, tumor suppressor p53 protein, angiogenesis transcription factor HIF-1alpha, antiapoptotic kinase Akt, Raf-1 MAP kinase and a variety of receptor tyrosine kinases of the erbB family. Elevated Hsp90 expression has been documented in breast ductal carcinomas contributing to the proliferative activity of breast cancer cells; whilst a significantly decreased Hsp90 expression has been shown in infiltrative lobular carcinomas and lobular neoplasia. Hsp90 overexpression has been proposed as a component of a mechanism through which breast cancer cells become resistant to various stress stimuli. Therefore, pharmacological inhibition of HSPs can provide therapeutic opportunities in the field of cancer treatment. 17-allylamino,17-demethoxygeldanamycin is the first Hsp90 inhibitor that has clinically been investigated in phase II trial, yielding promising results in patients with HER2-overexpressing metastatic breast cancer, whilst other Hsp90 inhibitors (retaspimycin HCL, NVP-AUY922, NVP-BEP800, CNF2024/BIIB021, SNX-5422, STA-9090, etc.) are currently under evaluation.
Langerhans cell (LC) infiltration has been observed in glioblastoma, but the glioblastoma microenvironment may be conditioned to resist antitumor immune responses. As little is known about how glioblastoma may affect dendritic cell differentiation, here we set out to delineate the effects of glioblastoma-derived soluble factors on LC differentiation.
CD34(+) precursor cells of the human myeloid cell line MUTZ-3 were differentiated into LC in the presence of conditioned media of the human glioblastoma cell lines U251 or U373 and phenotypically and functionally characterized.
Glioblastoma-conditioned media inhibited LC differentiation, resulting in functional impairment, as determined by allogeneic mixed leukocyte reactivity, and induction of STAT3 activation. IL-6 blockade completely abrogated these glioblastoma-induced immunosuppressive effects and reduced STAT3 phosphorylation. However, neither addition of JSI-124 (cucurbitacin-I; a JAK2/STAT3 inhibitor), nor of GW5074 (a Raf-1 inhibitor), both of which interfere with signaling pathways reported to act downstream of the IL-6 receptor, prevented the observed inhibitory effects on LC differentiation.
Glioblastoma-derived IL-6 is responsible for the observed suppression of LC differentiation from CD34(+) precursors but appears to exert this effect in a STAT3 and Raf-1 independent fashion.
The 14-3-3 family of phosphoserine/threonine-recognition proteins engage multiple nodes in signaling networks that control diverse physiological and pathophysiological functions and have emerged as promising therapeutic targets for such diseases as cancer and neurodegenerative disorders. Thus, small molecule modulators of 14-3-3 are much needed agents for chemical biology investigations and therapeutic development. To analyze 14-3-3 function and modulate its activity, we conducted a chemical screen and identified 4-[(2Z)-2-[4-formyl-6-methyl-5-oxo-3-(phosphonatooxymethyl)pyridin-2-ylidene]hydrazinyl]benzoate as a 14-3-3 inhibitor, which we termed FOBISIN (FOurteen-three-three BInding Small molecule INhibitor) 101. FOBISIN101 effectively blocked the binding of 14-3-3 with Raf-1 and proline-rich AKT substrate, 40 kD(a) and neutralized the ability of 14-3-3 to activate exoenzyme S ADP-ribosyltransferase. To provide a mechanistic basis for 14-3-3 inhibition, the crystal structure of 14-3-3ζ in complex with FOBISIN101 was solved. Unexpectedly, the double bond linking the pyridoxal-phosphate and benzoate moieties was reduced by X-rays to create a covalent linkage of the pyridoxal-phosphate moiety to lysine 120 in the binding groove of 14-3-3, leading to persistent 14-3-3 inactivation. We suggest that FOBISIN101-like molecules could be developed as an entirely unique class of 14-3-3 inhibitors, which may serve as radiation-triggered therapeutic agents for the treatment of 14-3-3-mediated diseases, such as cancer.
Novel functions of signaling molecules have been revealed in studies of cancer stem cells. Retinoic acid (RA) is an embryonic morphogen and stem cell regulator that controls the differentiation of a patient-derived leukemic cell line, HL-60, which is composed of progenitor cells with bipotent myelo-monocytic differentiation capability. RA treatment of HL-60 cells causes unusually long-lasting mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling, with the cells exhibiting the beginning of G0 cell cycle arrest and functional differentiation by 48 h after treatment with RA. This event coincides with the nuclear translocation of Raf-1, phosphorylated at serine 621. The present study shows how the novel localization of Raf-1 to the nucleus results in transcriptional changes that contribute to the differentiation of HL-60 cells induced by RA. We find that nuclear pS621 Raf-1 associates with NFATc3 near its cognate binding site in the promoter of CXCR5, a gene that must be up-regulated to drive RA-induced differentiation. NFATc3 becomes immunoprecipitable with anti-phosphoserine serum, and CXCR5 is transcriptionally up-regulated upon RA-induced differentiation. Inhibiting the pS621 Raf-1/NFATc3 association with PD98059 inhibits these processes and cripples RA-induced differentiation. In this novel paradigm for Raf-1 and RA function, Raf-1 has a role in driving the nuclear signaling of RA-induced differentiation of leukemic progenitor cells.
KLF10 is now classified as a member of the Krüppel-like transcription factor family and acts as a tumor suppressor. Although KLF10 is originally named as TGF-β-inducible early gene-1 and mimicking the anti-proliferative effect of TGF-β in various carcinoma cells, the transcriptional upregulatory function of KLF10 has been described for a variety of cytokines and in many diseases. Through in vivo and in vitro phosphorylation assays, we identified that KLF10 is a phosphorylated protein in cells. Using yeast-two hybrid screening and site direct mutagenesis, we also identified PIN1 as a novel KLF10 associated protein. PIN1 is a peptidyl-prolyl isomerase enzyme belonging to the parvulin family, which specifically recognizes phosphorylated Ser/Thr-Pro containing substrates. Through protein-protein interaction assays, we showed that the Pro-directed Ser/Thr-Pro motif at Thr-93 in the KLF10 N-terminal region is essential for the interaction between KLF10 and PIN1. More importantly, PIN1 interacts with KLF10 in a phosphorylation-dependent manner and this interaction promotes KLF10 protein degradation in cells. Therefore, KLF10 shows shorter protein stability compared with mutant KLF10 that lacks PIN1 binding ability after cycloheximide treatments. The reversely correlated expression profile between KLF10 and PIN1 as observed in cell lines was also shown in clinic pancreatic cancer specimen. Using in vitro kinase assays and depletion assays, we were able to show that RAF-1 phosphorylates the Thr-93 of KLF10 and affects the KLF10 expression level in cells. Thus these findings as a whole indicate that RAF-1 phosphorylation and PIN1 isomerization together regulate KLF10 stability and further affect the role of KLF10 in tumor progression.
Raf kinases are essential for regulating cell proliferation, survival, and tumorigenesis. However, the mechanisms by which Raf is activated are still incompletely understood. Phosphorylation plays a critical role in Raf activation in response to mitogens. The present study characterizes phosphorylation of Ser338, a crucial event for Raf-1 activation. Here we report that mutation of Lys375 to Met diminishes phosphorylation of Ser338 on both wild type Raf-1 in cells treated with epidermal growth factor (EGF) or 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) and a constitutively active mutant in which Tyr340/Tyr341 are replaced by 2 aspartic acids, a conserved substitution present in natural B-Raf. The loss of Ser338 phosphorylation in these Raf mutants is not engendered by a mutation-induced conformational change, inasmuch as mutation of another site (Ser471 to Ala) in the activation segment also abolishes Ser338 phosphorylation, whereas both the kinase-dead mutants of Raf-1 are phosphorylated well by active Pak1. Furthermore, our data demonstrate that EGF-stimulated phosphorylation of Ser338 is inhibited by Sorafenib, a Raf kinase inhibitor, but not by the MEK inhibitor U0126. Interestingly, a kinase-dead mutation and Sorafenib also markedly reduce phosphorylation of Ser445 on B-Raf, a site equivalent to Raf-1 Ser338. Finally, our data reveal that Ser338 is phosphorylated on inactive Raf-1 by an active mutant of Raf-1 when they are dimerized in cells and that artificial dimerization of Raf-1 causes Ser338 phosphorylation, accompanied by activation of ERK1/2. Altogether, our data suggest that Ser338 on Raf-1 is autophosphorylated in response to mitogens.
Raf-1 is an important effector of Ras mediated signaling and is a critical regulator of the ERK/MAPK pathway. Raf-1 activation is controlled in part by phosphorylation on multiple residues, including an obligate phosphorylation site at serine 338. Previously PAK1 and casein kinase II have been implicated as serine 338 kinases. To identify novel kinases that phosphorylate this site, we tested the ability of group II PAKs (PAKs 4-6) to control serine 338 phosphorylation. We observed that all group II PAKs were efficient serine 338 kinases, although only PAK1 and PAK5 significantly stimulated Raf-1 kinase activity. We also showed that PAK5 forms a tight complex with Raf-1 in the cell, but not A-Raf or B-Raf. Importantly, we also demonstrated that the association of Raf-1 with PAK5 targets a subpopulation of Raf-1 to mitochondria. These data indicate that PAK5 is a potent regulator of Raf-1 activity and may control Raf-1 dependent signaling at mitochondria.
Activation of the PI3K/Akt signaling cascade is often associated with advanced forms of prostatic carcinoma (CaP). This is likely explained by the common loss of the PTEN gene in a majority of CaP patients. Conversely, activation of the Raf/MEK/ERK pathway is seldom linked with prostatic disease. The interplay between these two pathways in advanced CaP has not been established. The following manuscript demonstrates that Akt can directly associate with Raf-1 causing its inactivation via phosphorylation of a negative regulatory residue (serine 259). Inhibition of PI3K with either LY294002 and wortmannin was sufficient to cause upregulation of ERK activity as measured by immunoblotting. Prolonged treatment with two commonly-used chemotoxic compounds, doxorubicin and paclitaxel, caused increased activation of ERK in PTEN-positive DU145 cells, but not PTEN-negative PC3 cells. Others have reported that ERK activation is essential for drug-induced death, which, when combined with these data, supports the notion that Akt plays an integral role in the response of prostate cancer cells to chemotherapeutic drugs. These results demonstrate that, in prostate cancer cells, the efficacy of chemotherapy may be limited by its effects on the intracellular signaling pathways found within the cell. The genotype of the tumor must be considered for an effective response to these and other antineoplastic drugs.
The chaperone glucose-regulated protein, 78/immunoglobulin binding protein (GRP78/Bip), protects cells from cytotoxicity induced by DNA damage or endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. In this study, we showed that GRP78 is a major inducible protein in human non-small cell lung cancer H460 cells treated with ER stress inducers, including A23187 and thapsigargin. AEBSF, an inhibitor of serine protease, diminished GRP78 induction, enhanced mitochondrial permeability, and augmented apoptosis in H460 cells during ER stress. Simultaneously, AEBSF promoted Raf-1 degradation and suppressed phosphorylation of Raf-1 at Ser338 and/or Tyr340 during ER stress. Coimmunoprecipitation assays and subcellular fractionations showed that GRP78 associated and colocalized with Raf-1 on the outer membrane of mitochondria, respectively. While treatment of cells with ER stress inducers inactivated BAD by phosphorylation at Ser75, a Raf-1 phosphorylation site; AEBSF attenuated phosphorylation of BAD, leading to cytochrome c release from mitochondria. Additionally, overexpression of GRP78 and/or Raf-1 protected cells from ER stress-induced apoptosis. Taken together, our results indicate that GRP78 may stabilize Raf-1 to maintain mitochondrial permeability and thus protect cells from ER stress-induced apoptosis.
Engagement of the T-cell antigen receptor (TCR) results in the proximal activation of the Src family tyrosine kinase Lck. The activation of Lck leads to the downstream activation of the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK signaling pathway (where ERK is extracellular signal-related kinase). Under conditions of weak, but not strong, stimulation through the TCR, a version of Lck that contains a single point mutation in the SH3 (Src homology 3) domain (W97ALck) fails to support the activation of ERK, despite initiating signaling through the TCR, as demonstrated by the robust activation of ZAP-70, PLC-gamma, and Ras. We determined that the signaling lesion in W97ALck-expressing cells lies at the level of Raf-1 activation and is dependent on the presence of tyrosines 340/341 in the Raf-1 sequence. These data demonstrate a second function for Lck in TCR-mediated signaling to ERK. Additionally, we found that a significant fraction of Lck is localized to the Golgi apparatus and that, compared with wild-type Lck, W97ALck displays aberrant Golgi membrane localization. Our results support a model where under conditions of weak stimulation through the TCR, in addition to activated Ras, Golgi apparatus-localized Lck is needed for the full activation of Raf-1.
Interferon alpha (IFNalpha) induces an EGF-Ras--&gt;Raf-1--&gt;Erk dependent survival pathway counteracting apoptosis induced by the cytokine. In this paper we have evaluated the effects of the combination between farnesyl-transferase inhibitor (FTI) R115777 and IFNalpha on the growth inhibition and apoptosis of cancer cells. Simultaneous exposure to R115777 and IFNalpha produced synergistic both antiproliferative and proapoptotic effects. In these experimental conditions, IFNalpha and R115777 completely antagonized the increased activity of both Ras and Erk-1/2 induced by IFNalpha and strongly reduced Akt activity. Furthermore, treatment with R115777 in combination with IFNalpha regimen induced tumor growth delay on established KB cell xenografts in nude mice, while the single agents were almost inactive. R115777 was again able to antagonize the Ras-dependent survival pathway induced by IFNalpha also in vivo. Raf-1, one of the downstream targets of Ras, has been reported to activate bcl-2 through displacement and/or phosphorylation of Bad. We have found that IFNalpha induced mitochondrial localization of Raf-1 that was antagonized by R115777. Moreover, IFNalpha increased Raf-1/bcl-2 immuno-conjugate formation and intracellular co-localization and enhanced phosphorylation of Bad at Ser 112 and again R115777 counteracted all these effects. Moreover, the use of plasmids encoding for dominant negative or dominant positive Raf-1 antagonized and potentiated, respectively, the co-immunoprecipitation between Raf-1 and bcl-2. In conclusion, FTI R115777 strongly potentiates the antitumor activity of IFNalpha both in vitro and in vivo through the inhibition of different survival pathways that are dependent from isoprenylation of intracellular proteins such as ras.
Adaptive immune responses by dendritic cells (DCs) are critically controlled by Toll-like receptor (TLR) function. Little is known about modulation of TLR-specific signaling by other pathogen receptors. Here, we have identified a molecular signaling pathway induced by the C-type lectin DC-SIGN that modulates TLR signaling at the level of the transcription factor NF-kappaB. We demonstrated that pathogens trigger DC-SIGN on human DCs to activate the serine and threonine kinase Raf-1, which subsequently leads to acetylation of the NF-kappaB subunit p65, but only after TLR-induced activation of NF-kappaB. Acetylation of p65 both prolonged and increased IL10 transcription to enhance anti-inflammatory cytokine responses. We demonstrated that different pathogens such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis, M. leprae, Candida albicans, measles virus, and human immunodeficiency virus-1 interacted with DC-SIGN to activate the Raf-1-acetylation-dependent signaling pathway to modulate signaling by different TLRs. Thus, this pathway is involved in regulation of adaptive immunity by DCs to bacterial, fungal, and viral pathogens.
Activation of Raf-1 by Ras requires recruitment to the membrane as well as additional phosphorylations, including phosphorylation at serine 338 (Ser-338) and tyrosine 341 (Tyr-341). In this study we show that Tyr-341 participates in the recruitment of Raf-1 to specialized membrane domains called "rafts," which are required for Raf-1 to be phosphorylated on Ser-338. Raf-1 is also thought to be recruited to the small G protein Rap1 upon GTP loading of Rap1. However, this does not result in Raf-1 activation. We propose that this is because Raf-1 is not phosphorylated on Tyr-341 upon recruitment to Rap1. Redirecting Rap1 to Ras-containing membranes or mimicking Tyr-341 phosphorylation of Raf-1 by mutation converts Rap1 into an activator of Raf-1. In contrast to Raf-1, B-Raf is activated by Rap1. We suggest that this is because B-Raf activation is independent of tyrosine phosphorylation. Moreover, mutants that render B-Raf dependent on tyrosine phosphorylation are no longer activated by Rap1.
14-3-3 proteins are a family of conserved dimeric molecules that interact with a broad range of target proteins, most of which contain phosphoserine/threonine. The amphipathic groove of 14-3-3 is the main structural feature involved in mediating its associations. We have studied another domain of 14-3-3, the C-terminal loop, to determine what role it plays in ligand interaction. A truncated form of 14-3-3zeta lacking this C-terminal loop was generated and found to bind with higher affinity than the wild-type 14-3-3zeta protein to the ligands Raf-1 and Bad. Interestingly, the truncated 14-3-3zeta also showed increased association with the 14-3-3 binding-deficient Bad/S136A mutant. Taken together, these data support a role for the C-terminal loop as a general inhibitor of 14-3-3/ligand interactions. This may provide a mechanism by which inappropriate associations with 14-3-3 are prevented.
14-3-3 proteins belong to a family of conserved molecules, which play a regulatory role and participate in signal transduction and checkpoint control pathways. 14-3-3 proteins bind phosphoserine-phosphorylated ligands, such as the Raf-1 kinase and Bad, through recognition of the phosphorylated consensus motif, RSXpSXP (where pS is phosphoserine). Recently, a phosphorylation-independent interaction has been reported to occur between 14-3-3 and a small number of proteins, for example the 43 kDa inositol polyphosphate 5-phosphatase, glycoprotein Ib, p75NTR-associated cell-death executor (NADE) and the bacterial ADP-ribosyltransferase toxin exoenzyme S (ExoS). It has been suggested that specific residues of 14-3-3 proteins are required for activation of the bacterial toxin ExoS. An unphosphorylated peptide derived from a phage display library, known as the R18 peptide, and a synthetic peptide derived from ExoS inhibit the interaction between ExoS and 14-3-3. In this report we identify the amino acid sequence on ExoS which is responsible for its specific interaction with 14-3-3, both in vitro and in vivo. In addition, we believe that this interaction is critical for the ADP-ribosylation of an endogenous target, Ras, by ExoS both in vitro and in vivo. Loss of the 14-3-3-binding site on ExoS results in an ExoS molecule that is unable to efficiently inactivate Ras and shows a reduced capacity to change the morphology of infected cells, together with reduced killing activity.
Mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase activity is essential for tumor necrosis factor (TNF) alpha receptor 1 regulation of intestinal epithelial cell proliferation. However, the mechanism of TNF-alpha mediated activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)/M1AP kinase has not been established clearly. Both TNF-alpha and cell-permeable ceramide have been reported to increase the kinase activity of kinase suppressor of Ras (KSR). To determine the role of KSR in TNF-alpha-induced ERK1/ERK2 activation, we studied young adult mouse colon cells expressing a dominant-negative, kinase-inactive (ki) KSR. We report that TNF-alpha, a cell-permeable ceramide, and sphingomyelinase stimulate ERK1/ERK2 activation and increase the phosphoserine content of KSR, which are inhibited by kiKSR expression in intact cells. Furthermore, TNF-alpha-induced Raf-1 threonine phosphorylation, kinase activity toward MEK1, and association with KSR are also inhibited by kiKSR expression. Our data also show by sequential in vitro kinase assays that TNF-alpha enhances KSR phosphorylation of Raf-1 on threonine, enhancing Raf-1 kinase activity toward MAP kinase kinase. We therefore conclude that KSR is an essential upstream regulator of TNF-alpha-stimulated ERK1/ERK2 activation, most likely mediated via direct phosphorylation of Raf-1.
cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) has been suggested to interfere with T-cell activation by inhibiting interleukin (IL-2) receptor alpha-chain (CD25) expression and IL-2 production. The Ras/MAP kinase pathway has been found to be necessary for induction of the IL-2 production. In this study, we have scrutinized the Ras/MAP kinase pathway in Jurkat T-cells to attempt to identify any sites for PKA-mediated regulatory phosphorylations. Here we unambiguously demonstrate that PKA directly inhibits anti-CD3-induced MAP kinase activation. In vitro phosphorylation experiments showed that Raf-1 was extensively phosphorylated by PKA, while ERK2 and MEK were not. Phosphopeptide mapping identified Ser-43 of Raf-1 as the only site phosphorylated by PKA in the Ras/MAPK pathway. Transient transfection experiments demonstrated that mutations of Ser-43 of the Raf-1 kinase were rendered insensitive to cAMP-mediated inhibition.
The Raf-1 kinase domain is kept in an inactive state by the N-terminal regulatory domain. Activation of the kinase domain occurs following release from the N-terminal repression and possible catalytic upregulation. To distinguish the regulatory mechanisms that directly influence the catalytic activity of the enzyme from those which act through the inhibitory domain, the catalytic domain of Raf-1 (CR3) was expressed in COS-7 cells. The role of phosphorylation in the direct regulation of this domain was determined by substituting non-phosphorylatable amino acids for known serine and tyrosine phosphorylation sites. The intrinsic activity of each mutant protein was determined as well as stimulation by v-Src and phorbol esters. Both v-Src and phorbol esters were potent activators of CR3, requiring the serine 338/339 (p21-activated protein kinase, Pak) and tyrosine 340/341 (Src) phosphorylation sites for full stimulation of CR3. In contrast, loss of the serine 497/499 protein kinase C phosphorylation sites had little effect on CR3 activation by either v-Src or phorbol esters. Loss of serine 621, a 14-3-3 adaptor-protein-binding site, prevented activation of CR3 by v-Src or phorbol esters and partially decreased the high basal activity of the kinase fragment. When co-expressed in COS-7 cells, 14-3-3 associated strongly with full-length Raf-1, weakly with wild-type CR3 and not at all with the A621 and D621 CR3 mutants. The role of 14-3-3 in maintaining the activity of the catalytic domain of Raf-1 was investigated further by performing peptide-competition studies with wild-type CR3, wild-type CR3 and v-Src or constitutively active CR3 (CR3[YY340/341DD]). In each case, incubation of the proteins with a phosphoserine-621 Raf-1 peptide, which we show displaced Raf-1 and CR3[YY340/341DD] from 14-3-3, was found to substantially reduce catalytic activity. Taken together, our results support a model of Raf regulation in which the activity of the Raf-1 catalytic domain is directly upregulated by phosphorylation, following relief of inhibition by the N-terminal regulatory domain upon Ras-GTP binding. Moreover, the presence of serine 621 in the free catalytic fragment is required for full CR3 activation by stimulatory factors, and the continuous presence of 14-3-3 at this site is necessary for retaining activity once the kinase is activated.
14-3-3 proteins play a regulatory role and participate in both signal transduction and checkpoint control pathways. 14-3-3 proteins bind phosphoserine ligands, such as Raf-1 kinase and Bad, by recognizing the phosphorylated consensus motif, Arg-Ser-Xaa-pSer-Xaa-Pro (where 'Xaa' represents 'any residue', and 'pSer' is 'phosphoserine'). However, 14-3-3 proteins must bind unphosphorylated ligands, such as glycoprotein Ibalpha and Pseudomonas aeruginosa exoenzyme S (ExoS), since it has been suggested that specific residues of 14-3-3 proteins are required for activation of ExoS. Furthermore, an unphosphorylated peptide derived from a phage display library inhibited the binding of both ExoS and Raf-1 to 14-3-3, and bound within the same conserved amphipathic groove on the surface of 14-3-3 as the Raf-derived phosphopeptide (pS-Raf-259). In the present study we identify the interaction site on ExoS for 14-3-3, and show that ExoS and 14-3-3 do indeed interact in vivo. In addition, we show that this interaction is critical for the ADP-ribosylation of Ras by ExoS, both in vitro and in vivo. Loss of the 14-3-3 binding site on ExoS results in an ExoS molecule that is unable to efficiently inactivate Ras, and displays reduced killing activity.
Full activation of Raf-1 requires the interaction of its CRD with Ras. The serine/threonine-rich region, CR2, of Raf-1 was implicated in Raf-1 regulation, but the underlying mechanism was unclear. Here we show that CRD loses its Ras-binding activity when expressed in connection with CR2, suggesting that CR2 masks CRD. This masking effect is abolished by substitution of Asp or Ala for Ser-259, a growth factor- and TPA-induced phosphorylation site in CR2. Treatment of COS-7 cells expressing Ha-Ras(Val-12) and Raf-1 with TPA enhances the Ha-Ras(Val-12)-dependent Raf-1 kinase activity. In contrast, the Ha-Ras(Val-12)-dependent activities of the Raf-1(S259D) and Raf-1(S259A) mutants are comparable to that of wild-type Raf-1 stimulated by both Ha-Ras(Val-12) and TPA and cannot be further stimulated by TPA treatment. These results suggest that the in vivo phosphorylation of Ser-259 may comprise a crucial step for Ras-dependent Raf-1 activation by unmasking CRD and promoting its association with Ras.
A number of Raf-associated proteins have recently been identified, including members of the 14-3-3 family of phosphoserine-binding proteins. Although both positive and negative regulatory functions have been ascribed for 14-3-3 interactions with Raf-1, the mechanisms by which 14-3-3 binding modulates Raf activity have not been fully established. We report that mutational disruption of 14-3-3 binding to the B-Raf catalytic domain inhibits B-Raf biological activity. Expression of the isolated B-Raf catalytic domain (B-Rafcat) induces PC12 cell differentiation in the absence of nerve growth factor. By contrast, the B-Rafcat 14-3-3 binding mutant, B-Rafcat S728A, was severely compromised for the induction of PC12 cell differentiation. Interestingly, the B-Rafcat 14-3-3 binding mutant retained significant in vitro catalytic activity. In Xenopus oocytes, the analogous full-length B-Raf 14-3-3 binding mutant blocked progesterone-stimulated maturation and the activation of endogenous mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase and mitogen-activated protein kinase. Similarly, the full-length B-Raf 14-3-3 binding mutant inhibited nerve growth factor-stimulated PC12 cell differentiation. We conclude that 14-3-3 interaction with the catalytic domain is not required for kinase activity per se but is essential to couple B-Raf catalytic activity to downstream effector activation.
Persistent hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a major cause of chronic liver dysfunction in humans and is epidemiologically closely associated with the development of human hepatocellular carcinoma. Among HCV components, core protein has been reported to be implicated in cell growth regulation both in vitro and in vivo, although mechanisms explaining those effects are still unclear. In the present study, we identified that members of the 14-3-3 protein family associate with HCV core protein. 14-3-3 protein bound to HCV core protein in a phosphoserine-dependent manner. Introduction of HCV core protein caused a substantial increase in Raf-1 kinase activity in HepG2 cells and in a yeast genetic assay. Furthermore, the HCV core-14-3-3 interaction was essential for Raf-1 kinase activation by HCV core protein. These results suggest that HCV core protein may represent a novel type of Raf-1 kinase-activating protein through its interaction with 14-3-3 protein and may contribute to hepatocyte growth regulation.
Expression of polySia is associated with metastatic dissemination and progression of various malignant diseases. In particular, it may contribute to tumorigenesis by a negative modulatory effect on cellular signaling cascades responsible for cellular migration, differentiation and proliferation. In this study, we investigated the expression of polySia in primary metastatic and non-metastatic laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC) tumor tissues and its potential impact on the LSCC progression.
The expression of polySia in metastatic and non-metastatic primary laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC) tumor biopsy specimens was investigated by immunohistochemistry, while the expression of polysialyltransferase IV (ST8SiaIV)(), fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1), extracellular signal regulated kinases 1 and 2 (Erk 1/2) and c-Raf was tested in metastatic and non-metastatic primary tumor tissues (including the corresponding non-tumor control tissues) by Western blot analysis.
The expression of polySia was detected in LSCC biopsies specimens with generally stronger immunoreactivity in non-metastatic tumor LSCC sections and in histologically undifferentiated tumors. Also, increased polySia expression was observed in adjacent histologically unaltered laryngeal tumor-associated tissue of the metastatic sections. In addition, we provide an evidence of increased polysialyltransferase IV (ST8SiaIV) expression, involved in polySia synthesis in both metastatic and non-metastatic primary tumors which is accompanied by decreased levels of FGFR1, Erk 1/2 and c-Raf.
We present for the first time the evidence for the polySia expression in LSCC biopsies specimens which suggests its potential impact on initial steps of LSCC malignant transformation.
Several brain-gut peptides have been reported to have a close relationship with the central dopaminergic system; one such brain-gut peptide is nesfatin-1. Nesfatin-1 is a satiety peptide that is predominantly secreted by X/A-like endocrine cells in the gastric glands, where ghrelin is also secreted. We previously reported that ghrelin exerted neuroprotective effects on nigral dopaminergic neurons, which implied a role for ghrelin in Parkinson's disease (PD). In the present study, we aim to clarify whether nesfatin-1 has similar effects on dopaminergic neurons both in vivo and in vitro. We show that nesfatin-1 attenuates the loss of nigral dopaminergic neurons in the 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1, 2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced mouse model of PD. In addition, nesfatin-1 antagonized 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridillium ion (MPP(+))-induced toxicity by restoring mitochondrial function, inhibiting cytochrome C release and preventing caspase-3 activation in MPP(+)-treated MES23.5 dopaminergic cells. These neuroprotective effects could be abolished by selective inhibition of C-Raf and the extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2). Our data suggest that C-Raf-ERK1/2, which is involved in an anti-apoptotic pathway, is responsible for the neuroprotective effects of nesfatin-1 in the context of MPTP-induced toxicity. These results imply that nesfatin-1 might have therapeutic potential for PD.
This article describes the design, synthesis, and biological screening of a new series of diarylurea derivatives possessing quinoline nucleus. Nine target compounds were selected by the National Cancer Institute (NCI, Bethesda, Maryland, USA) for in vitro antiproliferative screening against a panel of 58 cancer cell lines of nine cancer types. Following one-dose initial screening, compounds 1d-g and 2b were selected for 5-dose screening in order to calculate their IC50 and total growth inhibition (TGI) values against the cell lines. Compounds 1e and 1g were the most promising analogues. Both compounds showed strong potency and broad-spectrum antiproliferative activity against the different tested cancer types. Their IC50 and TGI values were less than those of the reference drug, sorafenib, against most of the tested cell lines of the nine different cancer types. Furthermore, the most potent compounds 1d-g were tested against C-RAF kinase as a potential molecular target of this series of compounds. All of them showed high potency, and the most potent derivative was compound 1e (IC50 = 0.10 μM). It was further tested against a panel of another twelve kinases, and it showed selectivity against C-RAF kinase. This could be, at least in part, the possible mechanism of antiproliferative action of this series of compounds at molecular level. The binding modes of compounds 1e and 1g were studied by docking studies, which highlighted the importance of the urea linker compared with the amide linker.
This study focused on the inhibitory effect of rhodomyrtone, a bioactive compound isolated from the leaves of Rhodomyrtus tomentosa (Aiton) Hassk., on cancer metastasis in epidermoid carcinoma A431 cells and on the verification of the underlying related molecular mechanisms of this event. We demonstrated that rhodomyrtone at the subcytotoxic concentration (0.5 and 1.5 µg/ml) exhibited pronounced inhibition of cancer metastasis by reducing cell migration, cell adhesive ability and cell invasion of A431 cells in a dose-dependent manner. Data demonstrated that rhodomyrtone could inhibit the focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and phosphorylation of protein kinase B (AKT), c-Raf, extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) and p38 MAPK involved in the downregulation the enzyme activities and protein expression of matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) and MMP-9. Moreover, we found that rhodomyrtone increased the expression of TIMP-1 and TIMP-2, which are inhibitors of MMP-9 and MMP-2, respectively. Rhodomyrtone also inhibited the expression of NF-κB and phosphorylation of NF-κB in a dose-dependent manner. These results suggested that rhodomyrtone inhibited A431 cell metastasis by reducing MMP-2/9 activities and expression through inhibiting ERK1/2, p38 and FAK/Akt signaling pathways via NF-κB activities. This finding suggested that rhodomyrtone may be a novel antimetastasis agent for treatment of skin cancer cells.
Hypophosphatemia causes rickets by impairing hypertrophic chondrocyte apoptosis. Phosphate induction of MEK1/2-ERK1/2 phosphorylation in hypertrophic chondrocytes is required for phosphate-mediated apoptosis and growth plate maturation. MEK1/2 can be activated by numerous molecules including Raf isoforms. A- and B-Raf ablation in chondrocytes does not alter skeletal development, whereas ablation of C-Raf decreases hypertrophic chondrocyte apoptosis and impairs vascularization of the growth plate. However, ablation of C-Raf does not impair phosphate-induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation in vitro, but leads to rickets by decreasing VEGF protein stability. To determine whether Raf isoforms are required for phosphate-induced hypertrophic chondrocyte apoptosis, mice lacking all three Raf isoforms in chondrocytes were generated. Raf deletion caused neonatal death and a significant expansion of the hypertrophic chondrocyte layer of the growth plate, accompanied by decreased cleaved caspase-9. This was associated with decreased phospho-ERK1/2 immunoreactivity in the hypertrophic chondrocyte layer and impaired vascular invasion. These data further demonstrated that Raf kinases are required for phosphate-induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation in cultured hypertrophic chondrocytes and perform essential, but partially redundant roles in growth plate maturation.
Cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) is an important mediator of hormonal stimulation of cell growth and differentiation through its activation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) cascade. Two small G proteins, Ras and Rap1 have been proposed to mediate this activation. Using HEK293 cells as a model system, we have recently shown that both Ras and Rap1 are required for cAMP signaling to ERKs. However, cAMP-dependent Ras signaling to ERKs is transient and rapidly terminated by PKA phosphorylation of the Raf isoforms C-Raf and B-Raf. In contrast, cAMP-dependent Rap1 signaling to ERKs and Rap1 is potentiated by PKA. We show that this is due to sustained binding of B-Raf to Rap1. One of the targets of PKA is Rap1 itself, directly phosphorylating Rap1a on serine 180 and Rap1b on serine 179. We show that these phosphorylations create potential binding sites for the adaptor protein 14-3-3 that links Rap1 to the scaffold protein KSR. These results suggest that Rap1 activation of ERKs requires PKA phosphorylation and KSR binding. Because KSR and B-Raf exist as heterodimers within the cell, this binding also brings B-Raf to Rap1, allowing Rap1 to couple to ERKs through B-Raf binding to Rap1 independently of its Ras-binding domain.
X-linked juvenile retinoschisis (XLRS) is a hereditary retinal dystrophy in young males, caused by mutations in the RS1 gene. The function of the encoded protein, termed retinoschisin, and the molecular mechanisms underlying XLRS pathogenesis are still unresolved, although a direct interaction partner of the secreted retinoschisin, the retinal Na/K-ATPase, was recently identified. Earlier gene expression studies in retinoschisin-deficient (Rs1h(-/Y) ) mice provided a first indication of pathological up-regulation of mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase signalling in disease pathogenesis. To further investigate the role for retinoschisin in MAP kinase regulation, we exposed Y-79 cells and murine Rs1h(-/Y) retinae to recombinant retinoschisin and the XLRS-associated mutant RS1-C59S. Although normal retinoschisin stably bound to retinal cells, RS1-C59S exhibited a strongly reduced binding affinity. Simultaneously, exposure to normal retinoschisin significantly reduced phosphorylation of C-RAF and MAP kinases ERK1/2 in Y-79 cells and murine Rs1h(-/Y) retinae. Expression of MAP kinase target genes C-FOS and EGR1 was also down-regulated in both model systems. Finally, retinoschisin treatment decreased pro-apoptotic BAX-2 transcript levels in Y-79 cells and Rs1h(-/Y) retinae. Upon retinoschisin treatment, these cells showed increased resistance against apoptosis, reflected by decreased caspase-3 activity (in Y-79 cells) and increased photoreceptor survival (in Rs1h(-/Y) retinal explants). RS1-C59S did not influence C-RAF or ERK1/2 activation, C-FOS or EGR1 expression, or apoptosis. Our data imply that retinoschisin is a novel regulator of MAP kinase signalling and exerts an anti-apoptotic effect on retinal cells. We therefore discuss that disturbances of MAP kinase signalling by retinoschisin deficiency could be an initial step in XLRS pathogenesis.
Sorafenib is an antitumor drug for treatment of advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). It acts as a multikinase inhibitor suppressing cell proliferation and angiogenesis. Human microRNA-125a-5p (miR-125a) is endowed with similar activities and is frequently downregulated in HCC. Looking for a potential microRNA-based mechanism of action of the drug, we found that sorafenib increases cellular expression of miR-125a in cultured HuH-7 and HepG2 HCC cells. Upregulation of the microRNA inhibited cell proliferation by suppression of sirtuin-7, a NAD(+)-dependent deacetylase, and p21/p27-dependent cell cycle arrest in G1. Later, recruitment of miR-125a in the antiproliferative activity of sorafenib was inquired by modulating its expression in combination with the drug treatment. This analysis showed that intracellular delivery of miR-125a had no additive effect on the antiproliferative activity of sorafenib, whereas a miR-125a inhibitor could counteract it. Finally, evaluation of other oncogenic targets of miR-125a revealed its ability to interfere with the expression of matrix metalloproteinase-11, Zbtb7a proto-oncogene, and c-Raf, possibly contributing to the antiproliferative activity of the drug.

Mitochondria play a central role in pancreatic β-cell nutrient sensing by coupling their metabolism to plasma membrane excitability and insulin granule exocytosis. Whether non-nutrient secretagogues stimulate mitochondria as part of the molecular mechanism to promote insulin secretion is not known. Here, we show that PKC signaling, which is employed by many non-nutrient secretagogues, augments mitochondrial respiration in INS-1E (rat insulinoma cell line clone 1E) and human pancreatic β cells. The phorbol ester, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, accelerates mitochondrial respiration at both resting and stimulatory glucose concentrations. A range of inhibitors of novel PKC isoforms prevent phorbol ester-induced respiration. Respiratory response was blocked by oligomycin that demonstrated PKC-dependent acceleration of mitochondrial ATP synthesis. Enhanced respiration was observed even when glycolysis was bypassed or fatty acid transport was blocked, which suggested that PKC regulates mitochondrial processes rather than upstream catabolic fluxes. A phosphoproteome study of phorbol ester-stimulated INS-1E cells maintained under resting (2.5 mM) glucose revealed a large number of phosphorylation sites that were altered during short-term activation of PKC signaling. The data set was enriched for proteins that are involved in gene expression, cytoskeleton remodeling, secretory vesicle transport, and exocytosis. Interactome analysis identified PKC, C-Raf, and ERK1/2 as the central phosphointeraction cluster. Prevention of ERK1/2 signaling by using a MEK1 inhibitor caused a marked decreased in phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-induced mitochondrial respiration. ERK1/2 signaling module therefore links PKC activation to downstream mitochondrial activation. We conclude that non-nutrient secretagogues act, in part, via PKC and downstream ERK1/2 signaling to stimulate mitochondrial energy production to compensate for energy expenditure that is linked to β-cell activation.-Santo-Domingo, J., Chareyron, I., Dayon, L., Galindo, A. N., Cominetti, O., Giménez, M. P. G., De Marchi, U., Canto, C., Kussmann, M., Wiederkehr, A. Coordinated activation of mitochondrial respiration and exocytosis mediated by PKC signaling in pancreatic β cells.
Lung cancer remains the top cancer killer worldwide, with squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) as the second commonest histologic subtype. Arsenic trioxide (ATO) was previously shown to suppress growth of lung cancer. Fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) amplification was recently demonstrated in lung SCC, with specific FGFR inhibitor (e.g. PD173074) developed as a potential targeted therapy. Therefore the combination effects of ATO and PD173074 in SCC was studied.
The combination of ATO/PD173074 was studied in a proof-of-principle model using a lung SCC cell line with FGFR1 overexpression: SK-MES-1. The effects of ATO and/or PD173074 on cell viability and protein expression were studied by MTT assay and Western blot respectively. Cell cycle analysis, phosphatidylserine externalization and mitochondrial membrane depolarization were monitored by flow cytometry. FGFR1 knockdown was performed with siRNAs. Proteasome inhibitor (MG-132) was used to study the degradation mechanism. In vivo effect of ATO and/or PD173074 was investigated using a nude mice xenograft model.
Combined ATO/PD173074 reduced cell viability along with increased sub-G1 population, phosphatidylserine externalization and mitochondrial membrane depolarization more significantly than single treatments. Downregulation of FGFR1, p-Akt, Akt, p-Src, Src, p-c-Raf, c-Raf, Erk and survivin as well as upregulation of p-Erk and cleaved PARP were observed upon ATO and/or PD treatment. MG-132 partially reversed the degradation of Akt, Src, c-Raf and Erk induced by ATO/PD, suggestive of ubiquitin-independent proteasome-dependent degradation. However, the mechanism of FGFR1 downregulation remained unknown. Downregulation of FGFR1, Akt, Src, c-Raf and Erk as well as cleaved PARP elevation induced by ATO and/or PD were confirmed in vivo.
Massive protein degradation (FGFR1, Akt, Src, c-Raf and Erk) was induced by ATO and/or PD173074 treatment mainly mediated by activation of proteasomal degradation in SCC cell line SK-MES-1 in vitro and in vivo.
The molecular chaperone Hsp90 plays an important role in cancer cell survival and proliferation by regulating the maturation and stabilization of numerous oncogenic proteins. Due to its potential to simultaneously disable multiple signaling pathways, Hsp90 has emerged as an attractive therapeutic target for cancer treatment. In this study, the design, synthesis, and biological evaluation of a series of Hsp90 inhibitors are described. Among the synthetic compounds, 6,7-dihydrothieno [3,2-c]pyridin-5(4H)-yl amide 19 exhibits a remarkable binding affinity to the N-terminus of Hsp90 in a fluorescence polarization (FP) binding assay (IC50 = 50.3 nM). Furthermore, it effectively inhibits the proliferation of H1975 non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and Skbr3 breast cancer cell lines with GI50 values of 0.31 μM and 0.11 μM, respectively. Compound 19 induces the degradation of the Hsp90 client proteins including EGFR, Her2, Met, c-Raf, and Akt, and consequently promotes apoptotic cancer cell death. Compound 19 also inhibits the growth of H1975 xenografts in NOD-scid IL2R gamma(null) mice without any apparent body-weight loss. The immunohistologic evaluation indicates that compound 19 decreases the expression of Akt in xenograft tumor tissue via an inhibition of the Hsp90 chaperon function. Additionally, the cytochrome P450 assay indicates that compound 19 has no effect on the activities of five major P450 isoforms (IC50 &gt; 50 μM for 1A2, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, and 3A), suggesting that clinical interactions between compound 19 and the substrate drugs of the five major P450 isoforms are not expected. Overall, compound 19 represents a new class of Hsp90 inhibitor with its 6,7-dihydrothieno[3,2-c]pyridin-5(4H)-yl-amide structure, and it has the therapeutic potential to overcome drug resistance in cancer chemotherapy.
Mortalin is frequently overexpressed in human malignancies. Previous studies have suggested that mortalin contributes to ovarian cancer development and progression, but further investigation is warranted. The aim of this study is to elucidate the mechanism of mortalin in ovarian cancer development and progression. In this study, lentivirus-delivered mortalin short hairpin RNA (shRNA) was used to knockdown mortalin expression in A2780 and A2780/cis ovarian cancer cell lines, and lentiviral mortalin-pLVX-AcGFP was used to generate mortalin-overexpressing cell lines. The results demonstrated that decreased mortalin expression reduced ovarian cancer cell proliferation, colony formation, migration and invasion by Cell Counting Kit-8 assay, colony formation assay, wounding healing assay and Transwell cell invasion assay, respectively. Flow cytometry results suggested that mortalin promotes the G1 transition, leading to faster restoration of a normal cell-cycle distribution. Cell-cycle proteins, including C-myc and Cyclin-D1, significantly increased, and Cyclin-B1 remarkably decreased upon mortalin down-regulation. Western blot analysis showed that mortalin knockdown significantly decreased p-c-Raf and phospho-extracellular-regulated protein kinases (p-ERK1/2) pathways but not the Jun N-terminal kinase pathway, whereas mortalin overexpression had the opposite effect. Taken together, these results indicate that mortalin is an oncogenic factor, and mitogen-activated protein kinase-ERK signalling pathway activation by mortalin may contribute to ovarian cancer development and progression.
C1ql-like (C1QL)-1 and -4 proteins are encoded by homologous genes that are highly expressed in brain and adipose tissues. However, functional properties of C1QL proteins outside of the brain and adipocytes remain unknown. Here, we report that the globular domain of C1ql1/Ctrp14 and C1ql4/Ctrp11 proteins directly stimulate the angiogenesis of endothelial cells. In this study, soluble C1ql1/CTRP14 and C1ql4/Ctrp11 proteins, produced in prokaryote expression system, are co-cultured with human umbilical vein endothelium cells (HUVECs), which phenotype is identified with von Willebrand factor antibody. C1ql1/Ctrp14 and C1ql4/Ctrp11 promote the migration and capillary tube formation of HUVECs in a dose-dependent manner. During this process, phosphorylation of c-Raf, MEK1/2, ERK1/2, and p90RSK are activated by C1ql1/Ctrp14 and C1ql4/Ctrp11. MEK1/2 inhibitor, U0126, blocks C1ql1/Ctrp14-, and C1ql4/Ctrp11-induced capillary tube formation and cell migration. Moreover, the immunoreactivity of the receptor of C1QL1-C1QL4, brain-specific angiogenesis inhibitor 3 (BAI3), is detected in HUVECs, suggesting that BAI3 may mediate C1QL1/CTRP14- and C1QL4/CTRP11-induced angiogenesis. Meanwhile, C1ql1/Ctrp14 and C1ql4/Ctrp11 exposure also causes a stimulatory response of angiogenesis in chick yolk sac membrane. These data demonstrate that C1ql1/Ctrp14 and C1ql4/Ctrp11 stimulate the new blood vessel growth by activation of ERK1/2 signal pathway. The proangiogenic activity of C1ql1/Ctrp14 and C1ql4/Ctrp11 provides novel insights into the new opportunities for therapeutic intervention by targeting C1QLs in tumorigenesis, tissue regeneration, and recovery of ischemic heart disease.
6-C-(E-phenylethenyl)naringenin (6-CEPN) is a small molecule found in naringenin fortified fried beef. It has been shown to suppress colon cancer cell proliferation, but the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. Here we demonstrate that 6-CEPN suppresses tumour cell proliferation through cell cycle arrest in G1 phase, induces necrotic cell death and autophagy in colon cancer cells. Blockade of autophagy by knockdown of the essential autophagy proteins, Atg7 or beclin-1, resulted in aggravated cell death in response to 6-CEPN treatment. In addition, genome-wide transcriptome expression profiling by RNA-sequencing revealed that 6-CEPN-mediated gene expression pattern was extremely similar to the transcriptome response induced by a RAS inhibitor salirasib (farnesylthiosalicylic acid [FTS; salirasib]). Subsequent molecular biological and biochemical experiments demonstrated that 6-CEPN indeed strongly inhibited RAS activation, leading to the inhibition of the downstream effector pathways c-Raf/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MEK)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase and phosphoinositide 3-kinase/AKT/mammalian target of rapamycin. More importantly, our computational molecular docking data showed that 6-CEPN could bind to the active site of isoprenylcysteine carboxyl methyltransferase (Icmt), a critical enzyme for the activation of RAS. Icmt activity assay showed that 6-CEPN inhibited its activity significantly. Knockdown of Icmt by siRNA attenuated 6-CEPN-mediated autophagy and cell death. The present study demonstrates that 6-CEPN induces cell growth inhibition and cytoprotective autophagy in colon cancer cells, at least in part, though inhibition of the Icmt/RAS signalling pathways.
Direct therapeutic targeting of oncogenic RAS is currently still impossible due to lack of suitable pharmacological inhibitors. Because specific blockade of druggable RAS effectors might represent an alternative treatment approach, we evaluated the role of the Raf complex for multiple myeloma (MM) pathobiology. We found frequent overexpression of the Raf isoforms (A-, B- and C-Raf) and downstream activation of MEK1,2/ERK1,2 in MM cells. Concomitant inhibition of all Raf isoforms (pan-Raf inhibition) by RNAi or pharmacological inhibitors was required to strongly induce apoptosis in human MM cell lines (HMCLs), in primary MM cells in vitro, and in a syngeneic MM mouse model in vivo. The anti-MM effect of pan-Raf inhibition did not correlate with the RAS mutation status, and functionally appeared to involve both MEK-dependent and -independent mechanisms. Furthermore, transcriptome analyses revealed that pan-Raf activity affects PI3K-dependent signalling, thus highlighting a functional link between the RAS/Raf and PI3K/mTOR/Akt pro-survival pathways. Accordingly, pharmacological inhibition of PI3K strongly enhanced the anti-MM effect of pan-Raf inhibition in MM cell lines and in primary MM cells in vitro and in vivo. Concomitant pan-Raf/PI3K inhibition was also effective in carfilzomib- and lenalidomide-resistant MM models underscoring that this attractive therapeutic anti-MM strategy is suitable for immediate clinical translation.Leukemia advance online publication, 18 November 2016; doi:10.1038/leu.2016.264.
Stress conditions are correlated with tumor growth, progression and metastasis. We hypothesized that stress signals might affect tumor progression via epigenetic control of gene expression and investigated the effects of stress signals on the expression levels of histone deacetylases (HDACs) and the underlying mechanisms of these effects in lung cancer cells. Treatment with isoproterenol (ISO), an analog of the stress signal epinephrine, increased the expression of HDAC6 protein and mRNA in H1299 lung cancer cells. ISO caused the deacetylation of α-tubulin and stimulated cell migration in an HDAC6-dependent manner. HDAC6 expression was increased by treatment with selective activators of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) or exchange protein activated by cAMP (Epac). ISO activated Rap1 via Epac, and constitutively active Rap1A increased the HDAC6 level; however, the knockdown of Rap1A decreased the 8-(4-cholorophenylthio)-2'-O-methyl-cAMP-induced increase in HDAC6 expression. Both PKA and Rap1A decreased c-Raf activation to inhibit extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling. Inhibition of ERK caused an increase in HDAC6 expression, and constitutively active MEK1 decreased the ISO-induced HDAC6 expression. We concluded that ISO increases HDAC6 expression via a PKA/Epac/ERK-dependent pathway that stimulates the migration of lung cancer cells. This study suggests that stress signals can stimulate the migration of cancer cells by inducing HDAC6 expression in lung cancer cells.
Cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) is an important mediator of hormonal stimulation of cell growth and differentiation through its activation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) cascade. Two small G proteins, Ras and Rap1, have been proposed to mediate this activation, with either Ras or Rap1 acting in distinct cell types. Using Hek293 cells, we show that both Ras and Rap1 are required for cAMP signaling to ERKs. The roles of Ras and Rap1 were distinguished by their mechanism of activation, dependence on the cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA), and the magnitude and kinetics of their effects on ERKs. Ras was required for the early portion of ERK activation by cAMP and was activated independently of PKA. Ras activation required the Ras/Rap guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) PDZ-GEF1. Importantly, this action of PDZ-GEF1 was disrupted by mutation within its putative cyclic nucleotide-binding domain within PDZ-GEF1. Compared with Ras, Rap1 activation of ERKs was of longer duration. Rap1 activation was dependent on PKA and required Src family kinases and the Rap1 exchanger C3G. This is the first report of a mechanism for the cooperative actions of Ras and Rap1 in cAMP activation of ERKs. One physiological role for the sustained activation of ERKs is the transcription and stabilization of a range of transcription factors, including c-FOS. We show that the induction of c-FOS by cAMP required both the early and sustained phases of ERK activation, requiring Ras and Rap1, as well as for each of the Raf isoforms, B-Raf and C-Raf.
The guanine nucleotide-binding protein Ras occurs in solution in two different states, state 1 and state 2, when the GTP analogue GppNHp is bound to the active center as detected by (31)P NMR spectroscopy. Here we show that Ras(wt).Mg(2+).GppCH(2)p also exists in two conformational states in dynamic equilibrium. The activation enthalpy DeltaH(++)(12) and the activation entropy DeltaS(++)(12) for the transition from state 1 to state 2 are 70 kJ mol(-1) and 102 J mol(-1) K(-1), within the limits of error identical to those determined for the Ras(wt).Mg(2+).GppNHp complex. The same is true for the equilibrium constants K(12) = [2]/[1] of 2.0 and the corresponding DeltaG(12) of -1.7 kJ mol(-1) at 278 K. This excludes a suggested specific effect of the NH group of GppNHp on the equilibrium. The assignment of the phosphorus resonance lines of the bound analogues has been done by two-dimensional (31)P-(31)P NOESY experiments which lead to a correction of the already reported assignments of bound GppNHp. Mutation of Thr35 in Ras.Mg(2+).GppCH(2)p to serine leads to a shift of the conformational equilibrium toward state 1. Interaction of the Ras binding domain (RBD) of Raf kinase or RalGDS with Ras(wt) or Ras(T35S) shifts the equilibrium completely to state 2. The (31)P NMR experiments suggest that, besides the type of the side chain of residue 35, a main contribution to the conformational equilibrium in Ras complexes with GTP and GTP analogues is the effective acidity of the gamma-phosphate group of the bound nucleotide. A reaction scheme for the Ras-effector interaction is presented which includes the existence of two conformations of the effector loop and a weak binding state.
Guanosine triphosphate nucleotide analogues such as GppNHp (also named GMPPNP) or GTPgammaS are widely used to stabilize rapidly hydrolyzing protein-nucleotide complexes and to investigate biochemical reaction pathways. Here we describe the chemical synthesis of guanosine 5'-O-(gamma-amidotriphosphate) (GTPgammaNH(2)) and a new synthesis of guanosine 5'-O-(gamma-fluorotriphosphate) (GTPgammaF). The two nucleotides were characterized using NMR spectroscopy and isothermal titration calorimetry. Chemical shift data on (31)P, (19)F and (1)H NMR resonances are tabulated. For GTPgammaNH(2) the enthalpy of magnesium coordination is DeltaH degrees = 3.9 kcal.mol(-1) and the association constant K(a) is 0.82 mm(-1). The activation energy for GTPgammaNH(2).Mg2+ complex formation is DeltaH++ = 7.8 +/- 0.15 kcal.mol(-1), similar to that for the natural substrate GTP. For GTPgammaF we obtained a similar enthalpy of DeltaH degrees = 3.9 kcal.mol(-1) while the magnesium association constant is only K(a) = 0.2 mm(-1). The application of both guanine nucleotide analogues to the GTP-binding protein Ras was investigated. The rate of hydrolysis of GTPgammaNH(2) bound to Ras protein lay between the rates found for Ras-bound GTPgammaS and GppNHp, while Ras-catalysed hydrolysis of GTPgammaF was almost as fast as for GTP. The two compounds extend the variety of nucleotide analogues and may prove useful in structural, kinetic and cellular studies.
The protooncogenes Ras and Raf play important roles in signal transduction pathways regulated by mitogen-activated protein kinases. Mutations of Ras that arrest the protein in its active state are frequently implicated in tumor formation. We used Ras and Raf proteins in the yeast two-hybrid system to search for natural or synthesized substances capable of modulating Ras/Raf interaction by specifically binding to one of the interacting partners. We found that cycloalkylidene carboxylic acids enhanced Ras/Raf interaction by acting on the cysteine-rich domain of Raf. Several analogues of the active substance 2-cyclohexylidene propanoic acid were synthesized and the importance of the semicyclic double bond in the stabilization of Ras/Raf interaction was demonstrated. Variation of the size and the substituents of the cyclic system as well as the length of the carboxylic acid resulted in enhanced Ras/Raf interaction.
The Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway is tightly controlled by negative feedback regulators, such as the tumor suppressor SPRED1. The SPRED1 gene also carries loss-of-function mutations in the RASopathy Legius syndrome. Growth factor stimulation translocates SPRED1 to the plasma membrane, triggering its inhibitory activity. However, it remains unclear whether SPRED1 there acts at the level of Ras or Raf. We show that pharmacological or galectin-1 (Gal-1)-mediated induction of B- and C-Raf-containing dimers translocates SPRED1 to the plasma membrane. This is facilitated in particular by SPRED1 interaction with B-Raf and, via its N terminus, with Gal-1. The physiological significance of these novel interactions is supported by two Legius syndrome-associated mutations that show diminished binding to both Gal-1 and B-Raf. On the plasma membrane, SPRED1 becomes enriched in acidic membrane domains to specifically perturb membrane organization and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling of active K-ras4B (here, K-ras) but not H-ras. However, SPRED1 also blocks on the nanoscale the positive effects of Gal-1 on H-ras. Therefore, a combinatorial expression of SPRED1 and Gal-1 potentially regulates specific patterns of K-ras- and H-ras-dependent signaling output. More broadly, our results open up the possibility that related SPRED and Sprouty proteins act in a similar Ras and Raf isoform-specific manner.
The identification of inhibitors of Hsp90 is currently a primary goal in the development of more effective drugs for the treatment of various types of multidrug resistant malignancies. In an attempt to identify new small molecules modulating the activity of Hsp90, we screened a small library of tetranortriterpenes. A high-affinity interaction with Hsp90 inducible form was uncovered for eight of these compounds, five of which are described here for the first time. By monitoring the ATPase activity and the citrate synthase thermal induced aggregation, compound 1 (cedrelosin A), 3 (7α-limonylacetate), and 5 (cedrelosin B), containing a limonol moiety, were found to be the most effective in compromising the Hsp90α chaperone activity. Consistent with these findings, the three compounds caused a depletion of c-Raf and pAkt Hsp90 client proteins in HeLa and MCF/7 cell lines. Induced fit docking protocol and molecular dynamics were used to rationalize the structural basis of the biological activity of the limonol derivatives. Taken together, these results point to limonol-derivatives as promising scaffolds for the design of novel Hsp90α inhibitors.
Identification of novel drug targets and affordable therapeutic agents remains a high priority in the fight against chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. Here, we report that the cellular proteins prohibitin 1 (PHB1) and 2 (PHB2) are pan-genotypic HCV entry factors functioning at a post-binding step. While predominantly found in mitochondria, PHBs localize to the plasma membrane of hepatocytes through their transmembrane domains and interact with both EGFR and CRaf. Targeting PHB by rocaglamide (Roc-A), a natural product that binds PHB1 and 2, reduced cell surface PHB1 and 2, disrupted PHB-CRaf interaction, and inhibited HCV entry at low nanomolar concentrations. A structure-activity analysis of 32 synthetic Roc-A analogs indicated that the chiral, racemic version of aglaroxin C, a natural product biosynthetically related to Roc-A, displayed improved potency and therapeutic index against HCV infection. This study reveals a new class of HCV entry inhibitors that target the PHB1/2-CRaf pathway.
Castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) ultimately occurs after a period of treatment with androgen deprivation therapy. Furthermore, CRPC patients can only derive limited survival benefits from traditional cytotoxic drugs. HSP90, which is a molecular chaperone, plays a vital role in client protein processing and maintaining the function of cells. HSP90 is usually overexpressed in prostate cancer tissues, which makes it a potential target for managing prostate cancer. Geldanamycin (GA), which was recognized as the first natural HSP90 inhibitor, has demonstrated potent anti-tumor efficacy in large-scale pre-clinical studies, but its application in the clinic is not permitted due to its liver toxicity and unstable physical properties. In this study, we report a new GA derivative, 17-PAG (17-(propynylamino)-17-demethoxygeldanamycin), which demonstrates highly effective anti-tumor activity against androgen-independent prostate cancer cells. Treating cells with 17-PAG dose-dependently suppressed proliferation, reduced colony formation and induced apoptosis of DU-145/C4-2B cells. Moreover, 17-PAG suppressed the migration and invasion of DU-145/C4-2B cells by regulating epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT). 17-PAG also downregulated the HSP90 client proteins, including Her2, EGFR, C-Raf, AKT, p-AKT, and CDK4. Animal assays confirmed that 17-PAG shows strong anti-tumor effects with no obvious organ toxicity in DU-145 cell xenografted nude mice. These results provide us with a potential target for treating androgen-independent prostate cancer in a safe and effective manner.
Neuroblastoma (NB) is one of the most common childhood malignancies. Currently, high risk NB carries a poor outcome and significant treatment related toxicities and, thus has been a focus for new therapeutics research in pediatric oncology. In this study, we evaluated the effects of the MEK inhibitor cobimetinib, as a single agent and in combinations, on the growth, survival and differentiation properties against a molecularly representative panel of NB cell lines.
In vitro anti-proliferative activity of cobimetinib alone or in combination was investigated by cell viability assays and its target modulatory activity was evaluated using phospho-kinases antibody arrays and western blot analysis. To determine the effect of combination with cis-RA on differentiation and resulting enhanced cellular cytotoxicity, the expression of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2) expression levels were examined by immuno-fluorescence.
Our findings show that cobimetinib alone induced a concentration-dependent loss of cell viability in all NB cell lines. In addition, cobimetinib showed feedback activation of MEK1/2, and the dephosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK1/2) and c-RAF, providing information on the biological correlates of MEK inhibition in NB. Combined treatment with cis-RA, led to differentiation and enhanced sensitization of NB cells lines to cobimetinib.
Collectively, our results provide evidence that cobimetinib, in combination with cis-RA, represents a feasible option to develop novel treatment strategies for refractory NB.
LY3009120 is a pan-RAF and RAF dimer inhibitor that inhibits all RAF isoforms and occupies both protomers in RAF dimers. Biochemical and cellular analyses revealed that LY3009120 inhibits ARAF, BRAF, and CRAF isoforms with similar affinity, while vemurafenib or dabrafenib have little or modest CRAF activity compared to their BRAF activities. LY3009120 induces BRAF-CRAF dimerization but inhibits the phosphorylation of downstream MEK and ERK, suggesting that it effectively inhibits the kinase activity of BRAF-CRAF heterodimers. Further analyses demonstrated that LY3009120 also inhibits various forms of RAF dimers including BRAF or CRAF homodimers. Due to these unique properties, LY3009120 demonstrates minimal paradoxical activation, inhibits MEK1/2 phosphorylation, and exhibits anti-tumor activities across multiple models carrying KRAS, NRAS, or BRAF mutation.
Although oncology therapy regimens commonly include radiation and genotoxic drugs, tumour cells typically develop resistance to these interventions. Here we report that treatment of tumours with ionizing radiation or genotoxic drugs drives p21-activated kinase 1 (PAK1)-mediated phosphorylation of CRAF on Serine 338 (pS338) triggering a kinase-independent mechanism of DNA repair and therapeutic resistance. CRAF pS338 recruits CHK2, a cell cycle checkpoint kinase involved in DNA repair, and promotes CHK2 phosphorylation/activation to enhance the tumour cell DNA damage response. Accordingly, a phospho-mimetic mutant of CRAF (S338D) is sufficient to induce the CRAF/CHK2 association enhancing tumour radioresistance, while an allosteric CRAF inhibitor sensitizes tumour cells to ionizing radiation or genotoxic drugs. Our findings establish a role for CRAF in the DNA damage response that is independent from its canonical function as a kinase.
The coiled coil is a superhelical structural protein motif involved in a diverse array of biological functions, and the abnormal expression of the coiled-coil domain containing proteins has a direct link with the phenotype of tumor cell migration, invasion and metastasis. The aim of this study was to investigate the critical role of Coiled-coil domain-containing protein 34 (CCDC34) in bladder carcinogenesis, which has never been reported to date. Here, we found CCDC34 expression was elevated in bladder cancer tissues and cell lines. The knockdown of CCDC34 via lentivirus-mediated siRNA significantly suppressed bladder cancer cells proliferation and migration, and induced cell cycle arrest at G2/M phase and increased apoptosis in vitro. In addition, CCDC34 knockdown suppressed bladder tumor growth in nude mice. Moreover, CCDC34 silencing decreased the phosphorylation of MEK, ERK1/2, JNK, p38 and Akt, and the expressions of c-Raf and c-Jun, indicating MAPK and AKT pathways (ERK/MAPK, p38/MAPK, JNK/MAPK and PI3K/Akt) might be involved in CCDC34 regulation of bladder cancer cell proliferation and migration. Our findings revealed for the first time a potential oncogenic role for CCDC34 in bladder carcinoma pathogenesis and it may serve as a biomarker or even a therapeutic target for bladder cancer.
Newcastle disease virus (NDV) causes a severe and economically significant disease affecting almost the entire poultry industry worldwide. However, factors that affect NDV replication in host cells are poorly understood. Raf kinase inhibitory protein (RKIP) is a physiological inhibitor of c-RAF kinase and NF-κB signalling, known for their functions in the control of immune response as well as tumour invasion and metastasis. In the present study, we investigated the consequences of overexpression of host RKIP during viral infection. We demonstrate that NDV infection represses RKIP expression thereby promoting virus replication. Experimental upregulation of RKIP in turn acts as a potential antiviral defence mechanism in host cells that restricts NDV replication by repressing the activation of Raf/MEK/ERK and IκBα/NF-κB signalling pathways. Our results not only extend the concept of linking NDV-host interactions, but also reveal RKIP as a new class of protein-kinase-inhibitor protein that affects NDV replication with therapeutic potential.
Mitochondria are the powerhouses of cells. Mitochondrial C-Raf is a potential cancer therapeutic target, as it regulates mitochondrial function and is localized to the mitochondria by its N-terminal domain. However, Raf inhibitor monotherapy can induce S338 phosphorylation of C-Raf (pC-Raf(S338)) and impede therapy. This study identified the interaction of C-Raf with S308 phosphorylated DAPK (pDAPK(S308)), which together became colocalized in the mitochondria to facilitate mitochondrial remodeling. Combined use of the Raf inhibitors sorafenib and GW5074 had synergistic anticancer effects in vitro and in vivo, but targeted mitochondrial function, rather than the canonical Raf signaling pathway. C-Raf depletion in knockout MEF(C-Raf-/-) or siRNA knockdown ACHN renal cancer cells abrogated the cytotoxicity of combination therapy. Crystal structure simulation showed that GW5074 bound to C-Raf and induced a C-Raf conformational change that enhanced sorafenib-binding affinity. In the presence of pDAPK(S308), this drug-target interaction compromised the mitochondrial targeting effect of the N-terminal domain of C-Raf, which induced two-hit damages to cancer cells. First, combination therapy facilitated pC-Raf(S338) and pDAPK(S308) translocation from mitochondria to cytoplasm, leading to mitochondrial dysfunction and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. Second, ROS facilitated PP2A-mediated dephosphorylation of pDAPK(S308) to DAPK. PP2A then dissociated from the C-Raf-DAPK complex and induced profound cancer cell death. Increased pDAPK(S308) modification was also observed in renal cancer tissues, which correlated with poor disease-free survival and poor overall survival in renal cancer patients. Besides mediating the anticancer effect, pDAPK(S308) may serve as a predictive biomarker for Raf inhibitors combination therapy, suggesting an ideal preclinical model that is worthy of clinical translation.
Treatments for recurrent or metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) have limited efficacy. One potential therapeutic target for HNSCC is the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK cascade, which is one of the major signaling pathways for HNSCC cell survival. In HNSCC, RAS can be activated either by HRAS mutation or by upstream signaling. The ABL inhibitor nilotinib acts as a weak RAF inhibitor that induces RAF dimerization and subsequent activation of MEK/ERK in other cancer cell lines with activated RAS, leading to an unexpected dependence on MEK/ERK for cell survival. We hypothesized that nilotinib and the MEK inhibitor MEK162 would be synergistic in HNSCC cell lines owing to the frequent activation of RAS. We treated HNSCC cell lines with nilotinib and performed immunoblotting and cell-viability experiments. We used an orthotopic mouse model to assess synergistic effects in vivo. Nilotinib induced significant BRAF-CRAF heterodimerization and ERK activation irrespective of RAS mutation status. In cell-viability assays, nilotinib synergized with MEK162. MEK162 alone induced G1 arrest that was minimally enhanced by nilotinib. In the mouse model, treatment with MEK162 alone or combined with nilotinib led to tumor growth inhibition. In HNSCC, nilotinib-induced RAF dimerization is independent of RAS mutation status, but this dimerization does not lead to MEK dependence for cell survival in all HNSCC cell lines. MEK inhibition alone leads to decreased proliferation both in vitro and in vivo. Although nilotinib has some synergistic effects with MEK162, other agents may be more effective against HNSCC when combined with MEK162.
Both Cluster of Differentiation 166 (CD166) and Melanoma Cell Adhesion Molecule (MCAM) play critical roles in maintaining transformative phenotype of Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) cells. However, the relationship between these two membrane proteins remains unknown. Here, we found that CD166 has a positive impact on the expression of MCAM, while MCAM has no feedback on CD166. Tissue microarray analysis (TMA) also showed a positive correlation between CD166 and MCAM. Depletion of CD166-induced anti-carcinogenic phenotype could be reversed by overexpression of MCAM, suggesting MCAM is functional important in the CD166-induced liver tumorigenesis. Furthermore, we found CD166 regulates MCAM mainly through protecting MCAM from ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation. Mechanically, CD166 down-regulated two ubiquitin E3 ligases, βTrCP and Smurf1, which play critical roles in the destability of MCAM protein. In addition, overexpression of βTrCP and Smurf1-reduced transformative phenotype could be partially reversed by MCAM, providing evidence that MCAM is a target of βTrCP and Smurf1. Moreover, we identified c-Raf/MEK/ERK signaling acts as a downstream effecter of CD166/PI3K/AKT axis to stimulate ubiquitination and destability of βTrCP and Smurf1. Taken together, we establish a model that CD166 regulates MCAM through a signaling flow from activation of PI3K/AKT and c-Raf/MEK/ERK signaling to the inhibition of potential MCAM ubiquitin E3 ligases, βTrCP and Smurf1, blockage of this signaling cascade may be useful in the treatment of CD166 and MCAM-dependent HCC.
Tumors are often greatly dependent on signaling cascades promoting cell growth or survival and may become hypersensitive to inactivation of key components within these signaling pathways. Ras and RAF mutations found in human cancer confer constitutive activity to these signaling molecules thereby converting them into an oncogenic state. RAF dimerization is required for normal Ras-dependent RAF activation and is required for the oncogenic potential of mutant RAFs. Here we describe a new mouse model for lung tumor development to investigate the role of B-RAF in oncogenic C-RAF-mediated adenoma initiation and growth. Conditional elimination of B-RAF in C-RAF BxB-expressing embryonic alveolar epithelial type II cells did not block adenoma formation. However, loss of B-RAF led to significantly reduced tumor growth. The diminished tumor growth upon B-RAF inactivation was due to reduced cell proliferation in absence of senescence and increased apoptosis. Furthermore, B-RAF elimination inhibited C-RAF BxB-mediated activation of the mitogenic cascade. In line with these data, mutation of Ser-621 in C-RAF BxB abrogated in vitro the dimerization with B-RAF and blocked the ability to activate the MAPK cascade. Taken together these data indicate that B-RAF is an important factor in oncogenic C-RAF-mediated tumorigenesis.
Melatonin, a neurohormone secreted mainly by the pineal gland, has a variety of physiological functions and neuroprotective effects. Previous studies have shown that melatonin could stimulate the proliferation of neural stem/progenitor cells (NS/PCs). Recent studies reported that the activities of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) of neural stem cells (NSCs) changed in response to the proliferative effect of melatonin. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to explore the proliferative mechanism mediated by melatonin on the adult rat hippocampal NS/PCs. Treatment with melatonin significantly increased the number of neurospheres in a concentration-dependent manner and up-regulated nestin protein. Pretreatment with luzindole, a melatonin receptor antagonist, and PD98059, a mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK) inhibitor, prevented the increase in the number of neurospheres formed by the activation of melatonin. The levels of phospho-c-Raf and phospho-extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) increased when treated with melatonin. Pretreatment with luzindole or PD98059 prevented the melatonin-induced increase in these signaling molecules. The present results showed that melatonin could induce NS/PCs to proliferate by increasing phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and c-Raf through melatonin receptor. These results provide further evidence for a role of melatonin in promoting neurogenesis, adding to the remarkably pleiotropic nature of this neurohormone. This intrinsic modulator deserves further investigation to better understand its physiological and therapeutic implication.
Gastric cancer is the leading cause of cancer death worldwide. Oridonin, a diterpenoid isolated from Rabdosia rubescens, has attracted considerable attention as a potential treatment for gastric cancer based on its anti-tumor effects in many tumor cell lines. However, detailed anti-tumor mechanisms of oridonin remain a matter of speculation. In the present study, a gastric carcinoma cell line harboring c-Met gene amplification SNU-5 was used to investigate the underlying mechanisms. The results showed that in vitro, oridonin potently inhibited c-Met phosphorylation and c-Met-dependent cell proliferation (IC50 value, 36.8 μM), meanwhile down-regulated the expression of the downstream signaling molecules including phospho-c-Raf, phospho-Erk, and phospho-Akt. In vivo, oridonin showed efficacy at well-tolerated doses, including marked cytoreductive anti-tumor activity in SNU-5 subcutaneous xenograft model. The anti-tumor efficacy of oridonin was dose-dependent and showed strong inhibition of c-Met phosphorylation. Additional mechanism of action studies showed dose-dependent inhibition of c-Met-dependent signal transduction, tumor cell proliferation (Ki67), and reduction of microvessel density (CD31). These results suggested that the anti-tumor activity of oridonin may be mediated by direct effects on tumor cell growth or survival as well as anti-angiogenic mechanisms. In summary, the results indicated that oridonin exerted anti-tumor growth on human gastric cancer SNU-5 in vitro and in vivo by direct regulation of c-Met signaling pathway and the anti-tumor effects was mainly based on its anti-proliferation and anti-angiogenesis.
The 14-3-3 proteins are structurally conserved throughout eukaryotes and participate in protein kinase signaling. All 14-3-3 proteins are known to bind to evolutionally conserved phosphoserine-containing motifs (modes 1 and/or 2) with high affinity. In Trypanosoma brucei, 14-3-3I and II play pivotal roles in motility, cytokinesis and the cell cycle. However, none of the T. brucei 14-3-3 binding proteins have previously been documented.
Initially we showed that T. brucei 14-3-3 proteins exhibit far lower affinity to those peptides containing RSxpSxP (mode 1) and RxY/FxpSxP (mode 2) (where x is any amino acid residue and pS is phosphoserine) than human 14-3-3 proteins, demonstrating the atypical target recognition by T. brucei 14-3-3 proteins. We found that the putative T. brucei protein phosphatase 2C (PP2c) binds to T. brucei 14-3-3 proteins utilizing its mode 3 motif (-pS/pTx(1-2)-COOH, where x is not Pro). We constructed eight chimeric PP2c proteins replacing its authentic mode 3 motif with potential mode 3 sequences found in Trypanosoma brucei genome database, and tested their binding. As a result, T. brucei 14-3-3 proteins interacted with three out of eight chimeric proteins including two with high affinity. Importantly, T. brucei 14-3-3 proteins co-immunoprecipitated with an uncharacterized full-length protein containing identified high-affinity mode 3 motif, suggesting that both proteins form a complex in vivo. In addition, a synthetic peptide derived from this mode 3 motif binds to T. brucei 14-3-3 proteins with high affinity.
Because of the atypical target recognition of T. brucei 14-3-3 proteins, no 14-3-3-binding proteins have been successfully identified in T. brucei until now whereas over 200 human 14-3-3-binding proteins have been identified. This report describes the first discovery of the T. brucei 14-3-3-binding proteins and their binding motifs. The high-affinity phosphopeptide will be a powerful tool to identify novel T. brucei 14-3-3-binding proteins.
Atk can be activated by two independent phosphorylation events. Growth factor-dependent phosphorylation of threonine 308 (Akt-308) by phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-dependent PDK1 leads to activation of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTor) complex 1 (TORC1) and stimulation of protein synthesis. Phosphorylation on serine 473 (Akt-473) is catalyzed by mTor in a second complex (TORC2), and Akt-473 phosphorylates Foxo3a to inhibit apoptosis. Accumulation of both phosphorylated forms of Akt is frequent in cancer, and TORC2 activity is required for progression to prostate cancer with Pten mutation. Here, we link Akt-473 to the Rb1 pathway and show that mTor is overexpressed with loss of the Rb1 family pathway. This leads to constitutive Akt-473 and, in turn, phosphorylation of Foxo3a and resistance to cell adhesion-dependent apoptosis (anoikis). Additionally, Akt-473 accumulation blocks c-Raf activation, thereby preventing downstream Erk activation. This block cannot be overcome by constitutively active Ras, and it also prevents induction of the Arf tumor suppressor by Ras. These studies link inactivation of the Rb1 pathway, a hallmark of cancer, to accumulation of Akt-473, resistance to anoikis, and a block in c-Raf/Erk activation.
Activation of protein kinase clients by the Hsp90 system is mediated by the cochaperone protein Cdc37. Cdc37 requires phosphorylation at Ser13, but little is known about the regulation of this essential posttranslational modification. We show that Ser13 of uncomplexed Cdc37 is phosphorylated in vivo, as well as in binary complex with a kinase (C-K), or in ternary complex with Hsp90 and kinase (H-C-K). Whereas pSer13-Cdc37 in the H-C-K complex is resistant to nonspecific phosphatases, it is efficiently dephosphorylated by the chaperone-targeted protein phosphatase 5 (PP5/Ppt1), which does not affect isolated Cdc37. We show that Cdc37 and PP5/Ppt1 associate in Hsp90 complexes in yeast and in human tumor cells, and that PP5/Ppt1 regulates phosphorylation of Ser13-Cdc37 in vivo, directly affecting activation of protein kinase clients by Hsp90-Cdc37. These data reveal a cyclic regulatory mechanism for Cdc37, in which its constitutive phosphorylation is reversed by targeted dephosphorylation in Hsp90 complexes.
The CRAF protein kinase regulates proliferative, differentiation, and survival signals from activated RAS proteins to downstream effectors, most often by inducing MEK/ERK activation. A well-established model of CRAF regulation involves RAS-mediated translocation of CRAF to the plasma membrane, where it is activated by a series of events including phosphorylation. Here we have discovered a new mode of regulation that occurs prior to this step. By creating a kinase-defective version of CRAF in mice or by use of the RAF inhibitor sorafenib, we show that CRAF must first undergo autophosphorylation of serine 621 (S621). Autophosphorylation occurs in cis, does not involve MEK/ERK activation, and is essential to ensure the correct folding and stability of the protein. In the absence of S621 phosphorylation, CRAF is degraded by the proteasome by mechanisms that do not uniquely rely on the E3 ubiquitin ligase CHIP.
The mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) signaling pathway is a potential target in cancer therapy. Constitutive phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK1/2), which is one of the MAPKs has been detected in a variety of tumors. Calcitonin (CT) is a polypeptide hormone secreted by the thyroid gland and has been used to treat the osteoporosis and humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy. We report that CT decreases ERK1/2 phosphorylation in cancer cells showing constitutive phosphorylated ERK1/2. In MDA-MB-231 cells, a breast cancer cell line showing constitutive phosphorylated ERK1/2, CT phosphorylated c-Raf at Ser(259) via the protein kinase A pathway, resulting in suppression of ERK1/2 phosphorylation. CT significantly reduced the tumor volume of MDA-MB-231 cells showing constitutive phosphorylated ERK1/2 compared with saline buffer. However, CT did not exert any significant effects on the proliferation of MCF-7 cells, a breast cancer cell line, showing non-constitutive phosphorylated ERK1/2. These novel findings indicate that CT may be used to target ERK in the treatment of cancer.
Interferon alpha (IFNalpha) induces both apoptosis and a counteracting epidermal growth factor Erk-dependent survival response in cancer cells. In this report, IFNalpha increased eukaryotic elongation factor 1A (eEF-1A) protein expression by inhibition of eEF-1A degradation via a proteasome-dependent pathway. The reduction of the expression level of eEF-1A by RNA interference enhanced the apoptosis induced by IFNalpha on the same cells. Moreover, IFNalpha induced the phosphorylation of both serine and threonine in eEF-1A. These effects were paralleled by an increased co-immunoprecipitation and colocalization of eEF-1A with C-Raf. The suppression of C-Raf kinase activity with the inhibitor BAY 43-9006 completely antagonized the increase of both eEF-1A phosphorylation and expression and of C-Raf/eEF-1A colocalization induced by IFNalpha and enhanced apoptosis and eEF-1A ubiquitination. Cell transfection with the mutated K48R ubiquitin increased EF-1A expression and desensitized tumor cells to the modulating effects of IFNalpha. The dynamic simulation of 3Dstructure of eEF-1A identified putative serine and threonine phosphorylation sites. In conclusion, the interaction between eEF-1A and C-Raf increases eEF-1A stability and induces a survival activity.
The 14-3-3 proteins associate with many cellular proteins that participate in the regulation of various cellular events including apoptosis, the cell cycle, spreading, and migration. We have previously described that 14-3-3beta binds the beta1-integrin and overexpression of 14-3-3beta promoted increased cell spreading and migration (Han et al. [2001] Oncogene 20: 346-357). In this study, we find that mutation of Ser 60 of 14-3-3beta, outside of the amphipathic groove which is involved in 14-3-3 protein interactions with other ligands, abolished its interaction with integrin. Surprisingly, this mutant retained its ability to promote cell spreading, suggesting that 14-3-3beta interaction with the beta1-integrin is not required for its regulation of cell adhesion. We next showed that mutations of several critical residues in the amphipathic groove did not affect 14-3-3beta interaction with the beta1-integrin. As expected, these mutants disrupted their association with the phosphoserine dependent ligands Raf and Cas. Analysis of the groove mutant LF (mutation of Arg129Tyr130 to Leu and Phe) indicated that, unlike wild type 14-3-3beta, it could not stimulate cell spreading or migration, suggesting that a functional amphipathic groove is required for 14-3-3 regulation of cell adhesion and migration. Consistent with this, cells expressing the LF mutant exhibited a delay in F-actin organization compared to cells expressing wild type or the S60A mutant (Ser 60 to Ala mutation) upon cell adhesion to fibronectin (FN). Taken together, these studies identified a novel binding site on 14-3-3 for integrin beta1 and showed that a functional amphipathic groove, rather than its interaction with integrin beta1, is required for 14-3-3 regulation of cell spreading and migration.
Signal transducer and activator of transcription (Stat)5a and Stat5b are critical for normal immune function. Progression of T cells through G(1)-S phase of cell cycle requires T cell receptor (TCR)- and/or cytokine-inducible tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat5a/b. Stat5a/b may also, in a cell-dependent manner, be constitutively or cytokine-inducibly phosphorylated on a Pro-Ser-Pro (PSP) motif located within the transcriptional activation domain. Phosphorylation of the PSP motif is needed for maximal transcriptional activation by Stat5, at least in certain promoter contexts. The basal and cytokine-inducible serine phosphorylation state of Stat5a/b has not been determined in T cells. Using primary human T cells and T lymphocytic cell lines coupled with novel phospho-specific antibodies to this conserved phosphoserine motif in Stat5a or Stat5b, we report that: Stat5a and Stat5b were unphosphorylated on the PSP motif under basal conditions and became markedly phosphorylated in response to several T cell growth factor stimuli, including interleukin (IL)-2, -7, -9, and -15 and phorbol ester 12-myristate 13-acetate but not TCR engagement; inducible Stat5a/b serine phosphorylation differed quantitatively and temporally; and Stat5a/b serine phosphorylation was, in contrast to inducible Stat3 serine phosphorylation, insensitive to inhibitors of mitogen-activated protein kinase, phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase, and mammalian target of rapamycin or deletion of Raf-A, -B, or -C by antisense oligonucleotides. We conclude that IL-2 family cytokines tightly control Stat5 serine phosphorylation through a kinase distinct from the Stat3 serine kinase.
At present, the Chinese specification for testing of quality control in X-ray mammography is based on a simple breast model, and does not consider the glandular tissue distribution in the breast. In order to more precisely estimate the mean glandular dose (MGD) in mammography for Chinese women, a three-dimensional (3D) detailed breast model based on realistic structures in the breast and Chinese female breast parameters was built and applied in this study.
To characterize the Chinese female breast, Chinese female breast parameters including breast size, compressed breast thickness (CBT), and glandular content were investigated in this study. A mathematical model with the detailed breast structures was constructed based on the Chinese female breast parameters. The mathematical model was then converted to a voxel model with voxels. The voxel model was compressed in craniocaudal (CC) view to obtain a deformation model. The compressed breast model was combined with the Chinese reference adult female whole-body voxel phantom (CRAF) to study the effects of backscatter from the female body. Monte Carlo simulations of the glandular dose in mammography were performed with Geant 4. The glandular tissue dose conversion coefficients for breasts with different glandular contents (5%, 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100% glandularity) and CBTs (3 cm, 4 cm, 5 cm, and 6 cm) were calculated respectively at various X-ray tube voltages (25 kV, 28 kV, 30 kV, 32 kV, and 35 kV) for various target/filter combinations (Mo/Mo, Mo/Rh, Rh/Rh, and W/Rh).
A series of glandular tissue dose conversion coefficients for dose estimation in mammography were calculated. The conversion coefficients calculated in this study were compared with those estimated with the simple breast model. A discrepancy of 5.4% - 38.0% was observed. This was consistent with the results obtained from the realistic breast models in the literature.
A 3D detailed breast model with realistic structures in the breast was constructed based on the Chinese female breast parameters. It was used to calculate glandular tissue dose conversion coefficients for mammography. Although the accuracy of the proposed model could not be directly assessed, the consistency of the obtained results with previously performed analyses increases the confidence in the applicability of the proposed model. The proposed model could be used in dose estimation and dose optimization for mammography of Chinese women. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
Epidemiological studies found an increased risk for kidney cancer in hypertensive patients, of which a subgroup has high aldosterone (Ald) levels. We recently showed that Ald is genotoxic both in kidney tubular cells and in rats with mineralocorticoid-mediated hypertension. The present work investigated in vitro and in vivo, if the oxidative stress-mediated activation of the ERK1/2 pathway, and its downstream target STAT3, could be one mechanism involved in the potential oncogenic potential of excess Ald exposure. The effects of excess Ald were investigated in LLC-PK1 cells and in Ald-induced hypertensive rats. Ald caused cRaf, MEK1/2 and ERK1/2 phosphorylation both in LLC-PK1 cells and in rat kidneys. ERK1/2 activation led to an increased phosphorylation of MSK1, p90RSK, and STAT3. The involvement of ERK1/2 in the activation of STAT3 was evidenced by the capacity of the MEK inhibitor U0126 to prevent Ald-mediated ERK1/2 and STAT3 phosphorylation. Both in vitro and in vivo, the activation of ERK1/2 and STAT3 by Ald was dependent on the mineralocorticoid receptor and was triggered by an increase in cellular oxidants. Ald-mediated oxidant increase was in part due to the activation of the enzymes NADPH oxidase and NO synthase. Proliferation was significantly enhanced and apoptosis decreased in Ald-treated rat kidneys and/or LLC-PK1 cells. Results support the concept that the oxidant-mediated long-term activation of ERK1/2/STAT3 by persistently high Ald levels could trigger proliferative and prosurvival events. Ald-mediated promotion of cell survival and DNA damage could result in kidney cells transformation and initiation of cancer in hypertensive patients with hyperaldosteronism.

RAS effectors specifically interact with the GTP-bound form of RAS in response to extracellular signals and link them to downstream signaling pathways. The molecular nature of effector interaction by RAS is well-studied but yet still incompletely understood in a comprehensive and systematic way. Here, structure-function relationships in the interaction between different RAS proteins and various effectors were investigated in detail by combining our in vitro data with in silico data. Equilibrium dissociation constants were determined for the binding of HRAS, KRAS, NRAS, RRAS1 and RRAS2 to both the RAS binding (RB) domain of CRAF and PI3Kα, and the RAS association (RA) domain of RASSF5, RALGDS and PLCε, respectively, using fluorescence polarization. An interaction matrix, constructed on the basis of available crystal structures, allowed identification of hotspots as critical determinants for RAS-effector interaction. New insights provided by this study are the dissection of the identified hotspots in five distinct regions (R1 to R5) in spite of high sequence variability not only between, but also within, RB/RA domain-containing effectors proteins. Finally, we propose that intermolecular β-sheet interaction in R1 is a central recognition region while R3 may determine specific contacts of RAS versus RRAS isoforms with effectors.
Histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors, which are approved for the treatment of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma and multiple myeloma, are undergoing evaluation in other lymphoid neoplasms. How they kill susceptible cells is incompletely understood. Here, we show that trichostatin A, romidepsin and panobinostat induce apoptosis across a panel of malignant B cell lines, including lines that are intrinsically resistant to bortezomib, etoposide, cytarabine and BH3 mimetics. Further analysis traces the pro-apoptotic effects of HDAC inhibitors to increased acetylation of the chaperone heat shock protein 90 (HSP90), causing release and degradation of the HSP90 client proteins RASGRP1 and CRAF, which in turn leads to downregulation of mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway signaling and upregulation of the pro-apoptotic BCL2 family member BIM in vitro and in vivo. Importantly, these pro-apoptotic effects are mimicked by RASGRP1 small interfering RNA (siRNA) or HSP90 inhibition and reversed by overexpression of constitutively active MEK1 or siRNA-mediated downregulation of BIM. Collectively, these observations not only identify a new HSP90 client protein, RASGRP1, but also delineate a complete signaling pathway from HSP90 acetylation through RASGRP1 and CRAF degradation to BIM upregulation that contributes to selective cytotoxicity of HDAC inhibitors in lymphoid malignancies.Leukemia advance online publication, 16 December 2016; doi:10.1038/leu.2016.357.
Cutaneous malignant melanoma is among the deadliest human cancers, broadly resistant to most clinical therapies. A majority of patients with BRAFV600E melanomas respond well to inhibitors such as vemurafenib, but all ultimately relapse. Moreover, there are no viable treatment options available for other non-BRAF melanoma subtypes in the clinic. A key to improving treatment options lies in a better understanding of mechanisms underlying melanoma progression, which are complex and heterogeneous.
In this study we integrated gene and microRNA (miRNA) expression data from genetically engineered mouse models of highly and poorly malignant melanocytic tumors, as well as available human melanoma databases, and discovered an important role for a pathway centered on a tumor suppressor miRNA, miR-32.
Malignant tumors frequently exhibited poor expression of miR-32, whose targets include NRAS, PI3K and notably, MCL-1. Accordingly, MCL-1 was often highly expressed in melanomas, and when knocked down diminished oncogenic potential. Forced MCL-1 overexpression transformed immortalized primary mouse melanocytes, but only when also expressing activating mutations in BRAF, CRAF or PI3K. Importantly, both miR-32 replacement therapy and the MCL-1-specific antagonist sabutoclax demonstrated single-agent efficacy, and acted synergistically in combination with vemurafenib in preclinical melanoma models.
We here identify miR-32/MCL-1 pathway members as key early genetic events driving melanoma progression, and suggest that their inhibition may be an effective anti-melanoma strategy irrespective of NRAS, BRAF, and PTEN status.
RAS GTPases are important mediators of oncogenesis in humans. However, pharmacological inhibition of RAS has proved challenging. Here we describe a functionally critical region, located outside the effector lobe of RAS, that can be targeted for inhibition. We developed NS1, a synthetic binding protein (monobody) that bound with high affinity to both GTP- and GDP-bound states of H-RAS and K-RAS but not N-RAS. NS1 potently inhibited growth factor signaling and oncogenic H-RAS- and K-RAS-mediated signaling and transformation but did not block oncogenic N-RAS, BRAF or MEK1. NS1 bound the α4-β6-α5 region of RAS, which disrupted RAS dimerization and nanoclustering and led to blocking of CRAF-BRAF heterodimerization and activation. These results establish the importance of the α4-β6-α5 interface in RAS-mediated signaling and define a previously unrecognized site in RAS for inhibiting RAS function.
Definition of cell cycle control proteins that modify tumor cell resistance to estrogen (E2) signaling antagonists could inform clinical choice for estrogen receptor positive (ER+) breast cancer (BC) therapy. Cyclin G2 (CycG2) is upregulated during cell cycle arrest responses to cellular stresses and growth inhibitory signals and its gene, CCNG2, is directly repressed by E2-bound ER complexes. Our previous studies showed that blockade of HER2, PI3K and mTOR signaling upregulates CycG2 expression in HER2+ BC cells, and that CycG2 overexpression induces cell cycle arrest. Moreover, insulin and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) receptor signaling strongly represses CycG2. Here we show that blockade of ER-signaling in MCF7 and T47D BC cell lines enhances the expression and nuclear localization of CycG2. Knockdown of CycG2 attenuated the cell cycle arrest response of E2-depleted and fulvestrant treated MCF7 cells. These muted responses were accompanied by sustained inhibitory phosphorylation of retinoblastoma (RB) protein, expression of cyclin D1, phospho-activation of ERK1/2 and MEK1/2 and expression of cRaf. Our work indicates that CycG2 can form complexes with CDK10, a CDK linked to modulation of RAF/MEK/MAPK signaling and tamoxifen resistance. We determined that metformin upregulates CycG2 and potentiates fulvestrant-induced CycG2 expression and cell cycle arrest. CycG2 knockdown blunts the enhanced anti-proliferative effect of metformin on fulvestrant treated cells. Meta-analysis of BC tumor microarrays indicates that CCNG2 expression is low in aggressive, poor-prognosis BC and that high CCNG2 expression correlates with longer periods of patient survival. Together these findings indicate that CycG2 contributes to signaling networks that limit BC.
The BRAF kinase, within the mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway, harbors activating mutations in about half of melanomas and to a significant extent in many other cancers. A single valine to glutamic acid substitution at residue 600 (BRAF(V600E)) accounts for about 90% of these activating mutations. While BRAF(V600E)-selective small molecule inhibitors, such as debrafenib and vemurafenib, have shown therapeutic benefit, almost all patients develop resistance. Resistance often arises through reactivation of the MAPK pathway, typically through mutation of upstream RAS, downstream MEK, or splicing variants. RAF kinases signal as homo- and heterodimers, and another complication associated with small molecule BRAF(V600E) inhibition is drug-induced allosteric activation of a wild-type RAF subunit (BRAF or CRAF) of the kinase dimer, a process called "transactivation" or "paradoxical activation." Here, we used BRAF(V600E) and vemurafenib as a model system to develop chemically linked kinase inhibitors to lock RAF dimers in an inactive conformation that cannot undergo transactivation. This structure-based design effort resulted in the development of Vem-BisAmide-2, a compound containing two vemurafenib molecules connected by a bis amide linker. We show that Vem-BisAmide-2 has comparable inhibitory potency as vemurafenib to BRAF(V600E) both in vitro and in cells but promotes an inactive dimeric BRAF(V600E) conformation unable to undergo transactivation. The crystal structure of a BRAF(V600E)/Vem-BisAmide-2 complex and associated biochemical studies reveal the molecular basis for how Vem-BisAmide-2 mediates selectivity for an inactive over an active dimeric BRAF(V600E) conformation. These studies have implications for targeting BRAF(V600E)/RAF heterodimers and other kinase dimers for therapy.
CRAF kinase maintains cell viability, growth, and proliferation by participating in the MAPK pathway. Unlike BRAF, CRAF requires continuous chaperoning by Hsp90 to retain MAPK signaling. However, the reason behind the continuous association of Hsp90 with CRAF is still elusive. In this study, we have identified the bipartite role of Hsp90 in chaperoning CRAF kinase. Hsp90 facilitates Ser-621 phosphorylation of CRAF and prevents the kinase from degradation. Co-chaperone Cdc37 assists in this phosphorylation event. However, after folding, the stability of the kinase becomes insensitive to Hsp90 inhibition, although the physical association between Hsp90 and CRAF remains intact. We observed that overexpression of Hsp90 stimulates MAPK signaling by activating CRAF. The interaction between Hsp90 and CRAF is substantially increased under an elevated level of cellular Hsp90 and in the presence of either active Ras (Ras(V12)) or EGF. Surprisingly, enhanced binding of Hsp90 to CRAF occurs prior to the Ras-CRAF association and facilitates actin recruitment to CRAF for efficient Ras-CRAF interaction, which is independent of the ATPase activity of Hsp90. However, monomeric CRAF (CRAF(R401H)) shows abrogated interaction with both Hsp90 and actin, thereby affecting Hsp90-dependent CRAF activation. This finding suggests that stringent assemblage of Hsp90 keeps CRAF kinase equipped for participating in the MAPK pathway. Thus, the role of Hsp90 in CRAF maturation and activation acts as a limiting factor to maintain the function of a strong client like CRAF kinase.
Erianin is a natural compound found in Dendrobium chrysotoxum Lindl. Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a serious and common microvascular complication of diabetes. This study aims to investigate the inhibitory mechanism of erianin on retinal neoangiogenesis and its contribution to the amelioration of DR. Erianin blocked high glucose (HG)-induced tube formation and migration in choroid-retinal endothelial RF/6A cells. Erianin inhibited HG-induced vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression, hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF-1α) translocation into nucleus and ERK1/2 activation in RF/6A and microglia BV-2 cells. MEK1/2 inhibitor U0126 blocked HG-induced HIF-1α and ERK1/2 activation in both above two cells. In addition, erianin abrogated VEGF-induced angiogenesis in vitro and in vivo, and also inhibited VEGF-induced activation of VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR2) and its downstream cRaf-MEK1/2-ERK1/2 and PI3K-AKT signaling pathways in RF/6A cells. Furthermore, erianin reduced the increased retinal vessels, VEGF expression and microglia activation in streptozotocin (STZ)-induced hyperglycemic and oxygen-induced retinopathy (OIR) mice. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that erianin inhibits retinal neoangiogenesis by abrogating HG-induced VEGF expression by blocking ERK1/2-mediated HIF-1α activation in retinal endothelial and microglial cells, and further suppressing VEGF-induced activation of VEGFR2 and its downstream signals in retinal endothelial cells.
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are attractive therapeutic targets for various therapy-resistant tumors. However, the association between miRNA and BRAF inhibitor resistance in melanoma remains to be elucidated. We used microarray analysis to comprehensively study the miRNA expression profiling of vemurafenib resistant (VemR) A375 melanoma cells in relation to parental A375 melanoma cells. MicroRNA-7 (miR-7) was identified to be the most significantly down-regulated miRNA in VemR A375 melanoma cells. We also found that miR-7 was down-regulated in Mel-CVR cells (vemurafenib resistant Mel-CV melanoma cells). Reestablishment of miR-7 expression could reverse the resistance of both cells to vemurafenib. We showed that epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF-1R) and CRAF were over-expressed in VemR A375 melanoma cells. Introduction of miR-7 mimics could markedly decrease the expressions of EGFR, IGF-1R and CRAF and further suppressed the activation of MAPK and PI3K/AKT pathway in VemR A375 melanoma cells. Furthermore, tumor growth was inhibited in an in vivo murine VemR A375 melanoma tumor model transfected with miR-7 mimics. Collectively, our study demonstrated that miR-7 could reverse the resistance to BRAF inhibitors in certain vemurafenib resistant melanoma cell lines. It could advance the field and provide the basis for further studies in BRAF inhibitor resistance in melanoma.
Detect if there are differences in prevalence, distribution of cardiovascular risk factors and risk according to REGICOR and SCORE's function; between people belonging to different occupational classes and population at risk of social exclusion.
Cross-sectional. SITE: Occupational health unit of the City Hall of Córdoba.
Sample availability of 628 people, excluding 59 by age or incomplete data. The group of municipal workers was obtained randomly while all contracted exclusion risk was taken.
No preventive, diagnostic or therapeutic actions that modify the course of the previous situation of workers were applied.
Smoke, glucose, lipids, blood pressure and BMI as main variables. T-student were used for comparison of means and percentages for Chi(2). Statistical significance attached to an alpha error &lt;5% and confidence interval with a 95% security. Receiver operator curves (ROC) were employed to find out what explanatory variables predict group membership of workers at risk of exclusion.
Smoking (95% CI: -.224;-.443), hypercholesterolemia (95% CI: -.127;-.320), obesity (95% CI: -.005;-0.214), diabetes (95% CI: -.060;-.211) and cardiovascular risk were higher in men at risk of exclusion. In women there were differences in the same variables except smoking (P=.053).
The existence of inequalities in prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors is checked. In a context of social crisis, health promotion and primary prevention programs directing to the most vulnerable, they are needed to mit.
Activating BRAF mutations promote constitutive activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway and are common in a variety of human malignancies, including melanoma and colon cancer. Several small molecule BRAF inhibitors such as vemurafenib have been developed and demonstrate remarkable clinical efficacy. However, resistance typically emerges in most melanoma patients. Studies have demonstrated that reactivation of MAPK signaling via CRAF overexpression and dysregulation is a mechanism for vemurafenib resistance in melanoma. Prohibitins (PHBs) are highly conserved proteins that are thought to control the cell cycle, senescence and tumor suppression. PHB1 is essential for CRAF-mediated ERK1/2 activation through direct binding to CRAF. We developed a CRAF-mediated model of vemurafenib resistance in melanoma cells to assess the importance of the interaction between CRAF and PHB1 in resistance to BRAF-targeting agents. We demonstrate that CRAF overexpression renders melanoma cells resistant to BRAF-targeting agents. Moreover, treatment with the natural compound rocaglamide A disrupts the interaction between PHB and CRAF in melanoma cells, thus reducing MEK1/2 and ERK1/2 signaling, inhibiting melanoma cell growth and inducing apoptosis. The efficacy of these compounds was also demonstrated in a human melanoma xenograft model. Taken together, these data suggest that PHB1 may serve as a novel, druggable target in CRAF-mediated vemurafenib resistance.
Both adaptive and acquired resistance significantly limits the efficacy of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) kinase inhibitors. However, the distinct or common mechanisms of adaptive and acquired resistance have not been fully characterized. Here, through systematic modeling of erlotinib resistance in lung cancer, we found that feedback reactivation of MAPK signaling following erlotinib treatment, which was dependent on the MET receptor, contributed to the adaptive resistance of EGFR inhibitors. Interestingly, acquired resistance to erlotinib was also associated with the MAPK pathway activation as a result of CRAF or NRAS amplification. Consequently, combined inhibition of EGFR and MAPK impeded the development of both adaptive and acquired resistance. These observations demonstrate that adaptive and acquired resistance to EGFR inhibitors can converge on the same pathway and credential cotargeting EGFR and MAPK as a promising therapeutic approach in EGFR mutant tumors.
Approximately 75% of melanomas have known driver oncogenic mutations in BRAF, NRAS, GNA11 or GNAQ, while the mutations providing constitutive oncogenic signaling in the remaining melanomas are not known. We established a melanoma cell line from a tumor with none of the common driver mutations. This cell line demonstrated a signaling profile similar to BRAF-mutants, but lacked sensitivity to the BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib. RNA-seq mutation data implicated CRAF R391W as the alternative driver mutation of this melanoma. CRAF R391W was homozygous and over expressed. These melanoma cells were highly sensitive to CRAF, but not BRAF knockdown. In reconstitution experiments, CRAF R391W, but not CRAF WT, transformed NIH3T3 cells in soft-agar colony formation assays, increased kinase activity in vitro, induced MAP kinase signaling and conferred vemurafenib resistance. MAP kinase inducing activity was dependent on CRAF dimerization. Thus, CRAF is a bona fide alternative oncogene for BRAF/NRAS/GNAQ/GNA11 wild type melanomas.
Although treatment of BRAF V600E-mutant non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC(V600E)) with GSK2118436 has shown an encouraging efficacy, most patients develop resistance. To investigate the mechanisms of acquired resistance to GSK2118436 in NSCLC(V600E), we established GSK2118436-resistant (GSR) cells by exposing MV522 NSCLC(V600E) to increasing GSK2118436 concentrations. GSR cells displayed activated EGFR-RAS-CRAF signaling with upregulated EGFR ligands and sustained activation of ERK1/2, but not MEK1/2, in the presence of GSK2118436. Treatment of GSR cells with GSK2118436 enhanced EGFR-mediated RAS activity, leading to the formation of BRAF-CRAF dimers and transactivation of CRAF. Interestingly, sustained activation of ERK1/2 was partly dependent on receptor-interacting protein kinase-2 (RIP2) activity, but not on MEK1/2 activity. Combined BRAF and EGFR inhibition blocked reactivation of ERK signaling and improved efficacy in vitro and in vivo Our findings support the evaluation of combined BRAF and EGFR inhibition in NSCLC(V600E) with acquired resistance to BRAF inhibitors.

Modulation of protein-protein interactions (PPIs) is a highly demanding, but also a very promising approach in chemical biology and targeted drug discovery. In contrast to inhibiting PPIs with small, chemically tractable molecules, stabilisation of these interactions can only be achieved with complex natural products, like rapamycin, FK506, taxol, forskolin, brefeldin and fusicoccin. Fusicoccin stabilises the activatory complex of the plant H(+)-ATPase PMA2 and 14-3-3 proteins. Recently, we have shown that the stabilising effect of fusicoccin could be mimicked by a trisubstituted pyrrolinone (pyrrolidone1, 1). Here, we report the synthesis, functional activity and crystal structure of derivatives of 1 that stabilise the 14-3-3-PMA2 complex. With a limited compound collection three modifications that are important for activity enhancement could be determined: 1) conversion of the pyrrolinone scaffold into a pyrazole, 2) introduction of a tetrazole moiety to the phenyl ring that contacts PMA2, and 3) addition of a bromine to the phenyl ring that exclusively contacts the 14-3-3 protein. The crystal structure of a pyrazole derivative of 1 in complex with 14-3-3 and PMA2 revealed that the more rigid core of this molecule positions the stabiliser deeper into the rim of the interface, enlarging especially the contact surface to PMA2. Combination of the aforementioned features gave rise to a molecule (37) that displays a threefold increase in stabilising the 14-3-3-PMA2 complex over 1. Compound 37 and the other active derivatives show no effect on two other important 14-3-3 protein-protein interactions, that is, with CRaf and p53. This is the first study that describes the successful optimisation of a PPI stabiliser identified by screening.
Treatment of cancer patients with ATP-competitive inhibitors of BRAF/CRAF kinases surprisingly increases total kinase activity, especially in wild-type BRAF cells, subverting the desired clinical outcome. Similar inhibition resistance is observed for numerous kinases involving homo/heterodimerization in their activation cycles. Here, I demonstrate that drug resistance resulting from kinase dimerization can be explained using thermodynamic principles. I show that allosteric regulation by inhibitors is described by thermodynamic factors that quantify inhibitor-induced changes in kinase dimerization and the difference in the drug affinity for a free monomer versus a dimer harboring one drug molecule. The analysis extends to kinase homo- and heterodimers, allows for their symmetric and asymmetric conformations, and predicts how thermodynamic factors influence dose-response dependencies. I show how two inhibitors, ineffective on their own, when combined can abolish drug resistance at lower doses than either inhibitor applied alone. Thus, the mechanistic models suggest ways to overcome resistance to kinase inhibitors.
Vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) undergo cell biological changes in response to a variety of cytokines and growth factors. Adiponectin inhibits neointimal formation through suppressing the proliferation and migration of VSMCs. However, the mechanisms underlying the effect of adiponectin on VSMC proliferation and apoptosis require further investigation. The present study was designed to investigate the mechanisms of adiponectin on VSMC proliferation and apoptosis, focusing on the mitofusin‑2 (MFN2) mediated Ras‑Raf‑extracellular signal regulated kinase (Erk)1/2 signaling pathway. The results of western blot analysis revealed that adiponectin increased the expression of MFN2 in a concentration‑dependent manner. Adiponectin also suppressed VSMC proliferation and induced VSMC apoptosis. However, transfection of the VSMCs with small interfering (si)RNA, to knock down the expression of MFN2 attenuated the effect of adiponectin on VSMC proliferation and apoptosis. The decreased expression levels of Ras, phosphorlated (p)‑c‑Raf and p‑Erk1/2, observed in the VSMCs treated with adiponectin were also reversed by the transfection of the VSMCs with MFN2 siRNA to knock down the expression of MFN2. The results of the present study demonstrated for the first time, to the best of our knowledge, that adiponectin exhibits an inhibitory effect on VSMC proliferation and induces cell proliferation via regulation of the expression levels of MFN2. Adiponectin upregulated the expression of MFN2, inhibiting the Ras‑Raf‑Erk1/2 signaling pathway, which led to the inhibition of VSMC proliferation and the induction of VSMC apoptosis. The results of the present study may provide a novel basis for the therapy of vascular disease.
Cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas and keratoacanthomas commonly occur in patients treated with BRAF inhibitors. We investigated the effect of the BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib on normal immortalized human HaCaT keratinocytes to explore the mechanism of hyperproliferative cutaneous neoplasia associated with the use of BRAF inhibitors. Vemurafenib induced an increase in viable cell number in BRAF wild-type cell lines (SK-MEL-2 and HaCaT) but not in BRAF mutant cell lines (SK-MEL-24 and G361). In HaCaT keratinocytes, a low concentration (2 μmol/L) of vemurafenib increased cell proliferation and activated mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase in a CRAF-dependent manner. Invasiveness of HaCaT cells in a Matrigel assay significantly increased upon cultivation of cells with 2 μmol/L vemurafenib for 24 h. Gelatin zymography, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and western blot results revealed that 2 μmol/L vemurafenib treatment increased matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and MMP-9 expressions and activities in HaCaT cells. These results offer additional insight into the complex mechanism of paradoxical mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling involved in hyperproliferative cutaneous neoplasias that arise after BRAF inhibition and suggest a possible role for MMP in tumor progression and invasion.
Resistance to the BCR-ABL inhibitor imatinib mesylate (IM) poses a major problem for the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). IM resistance often results from a secondary mutation in BCR-ABL that interferes with drug binding. However, in many instances, there is no mutation in BCR-ABL, and the basis of such BCR-ABL-independent IM resistance remains to be elucidated. To gain insight into BCR-ABL-independent IM resistance mechanisms, we performed a large-scale RNA interference screen and identified IM-sensitizing genes (IMSGs) whose knockdown renders BCR-ABL(+) cells IM-resistant. In these IMSG knockdown cells, RAF/mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling is sustained after IM treatment because of up-regulation of PRKCH, which encodes the protein kinase C (PKC) family member PKCη, an activator of CRAF. PRKCH is also up-regulated in samples from CML patients with BCR-ABL-independent IM resistance. Combined treatment with IM and trametinib, a U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved MEK inhibitor, synergistically kills BCR-ABL(+) IMSG knockdown cells and prolongs survival in mouse models of BCR-ABL-independent IM-resistant CML. Finally, we showed that CML stem cells contain high levels of PRKCH, and this contributes to their intrinsic IM resistance. Combined treatment with IM and trametinib synergistically kills CML stem cells with negligible effect on normal hematopoietic stem cells. Collectively, our results identify a therapeutically targetable mechanism of BCR-ABL-independent IM resistance in CML and CML stem cells.
Dabrafenib is an orally bioavailable, potent, and selective inhibitor of human wild-type BRAF and CRAF kinases as well as mutant forms of BRAF kinase. The aim of this phase 1, single-center, open-label study in four patients with BRAF mutation-positive solid tumors was to determine the absolute bioavailability of a 150 mg oral dose of dabrafenib. A microtracer study approach, in which a 50 µg radiolabeled intravenous (IV) microdose of dabrafenib was given concomitantly with a 150 mg oral dose, was used to simultaneously recover IV and oral pharmacokinetic parameters. The least squares mean (90% CI) absolute bioavailability of dabrafenib (HPMC capsules) was 94.5% (81.3%, 109.7%). Median T(max) after oral administration was 2.0 hours and the geometric mean terminal half-life was 4.8 hours. The geometric mean clearance and volume of distribution after IV administration were 12.0 L/h and 45.5 L, respectively. Human clearance and volume of distribution at steady state were in agreement with predictions made using allometric scaling of pharmacokinetic parameters from four preclinical species. In conclusion, dabrafenib absolute bioavailability was high, whereas first-pass metabolism was low. Furthermore, the microtracer approach provided an innovative and efficient method for assessing the absolute bioavailability of dabrafenib in patients with advanced cancer.
Rocaglamides are potent natural anticancer products that inhibit proliferation of various cancer cells at nanomolar concentrations. We have recently shown that these compounds prevent tumor growth and sensitize resistant cancer cells to apoptosis by blocking the MEK-ERK-eIF4 pathway. However, their direct molecular target(s) remain(s) unknown. In this study, using an affinity chromatography approach we discovered that prohibitin (PHB) 1 and 2 are the direct targets of rocaglamides. Binding of rocaglamides to PHB prevents interaction between PHB and CRaf and, thereby, inhibits CRaf activation and subsequently CRaf-MEK-ERK signaling. Moreover, knockdown of PHB mimicked the effects of rocaglamides on the CRaf-MEK-ERK pathway and cell cycle progression. Thus, our finding suggests that rocaglamides are a new type of anticancer agent and that they may serve as a small-molecular tool for studying PHB-mediated cellular processes.
Interaction with prohibitin (PHB) is required for full activation of CRAF kinase, the central member of the highly conserved RAS-CRAF-MAPK pathway. In this issue of Chemistry &amp; Biology, Polier et al. show that the natural anti-tumor compounds rocaglamides target the CRAF-PHB interaction to disrupt the MAPK pathway leading to proliferation block in human leukemic cells.
(L597V)BRAF mutations are acquired somatically in human cancer samples and are frequently coincident with RAS mutations. Germline (L597V)BRAF mutations are also found in several autosomal dominant developmental conditions known as RASopathies, raising the important question of how the same mutation can contribute to both pathologies. Using a conditional knock-in mouse model, we show that endogenous expression of (L597V)Braf leads to approximately twofold elevated Braf kinase activity and weak activation of the Mek/Erk pathway. This is associated with induction of RASopathy hallmarks including cardiac abnormalities and facial dysmorphia but is not sufficient for tumor formation. We combined (L597V)Braf with (G12D)Kras and found that (L597V)Braf modified (G12D)Kras oncogenesis such that fibroblast transformation and lung tumor development were more reminiscent of that driven by the high-activity (V600E)Braf mutant. Mek/Erk activation levels were comparable with those driven by (V600E)Braf in the double-mutant cells, and the gene expression signature was more similar to that induced by (V600E)Braf than (G12D)Kras. However, unlike (V600E)Braf, Mek/Erk pathway activation was mediated by both Craf and Braf, and ATP-competitive RAF inhibitors induced paradoxical Mek/Erk pathway activation. Our data show that weak activation of the Mek/Erk pathway underpins RASopathies, but in cancer, (L597V)Braf epistatically modifies the transforming effects of driver oncogenes.
Aberrant regulation of growth signaling is a hallmark of cancer development that often occurs through the constitutive activation of growth factor receptors or their downstream effectors. Using validation-based insertional mutagenesis (VBIM), we identified family with sequence similarity 83, member B (FAM83B), based on its ability to substitute for RAS in the transformation of immortalized human mammary epithelial cells (HMECs). We found that FAM83B coprecipitated with a downstream effector of RAS, CRAF. Binding of FAM83B with CRAF disrupted CRAF/14-3-3 interactions and increased CRAF membrane localization, resulting in elevated MAPK and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling. Ablation of FAM83B inhibited the proliferation and malignant phenotype of tumor-derived cells or RAS-transformed HMECs, implicating FAM83B as a key intermediary in EGFR/RAS/MAPK signaling. Analysis of human tumor specimens revealed that FAM83B expression was significantly elevated in cancer and was associated with specific cancer subtypes, increased tumor grade, and decreased overall survival. Cumulatively, these results suggest that FAM83B is an oncogene and potentially represents a new target for therapeutic intervention.
BRAF and RAS are often mutated in cutaneous melanoma and both mutations stimulate the MAPK pathway. However the biological consequences of BRAF and NRAS mutations are different because when RAS is mutated in melanoma, cells use CRAF rather than BRAF to activate MEK/ERK. The mechanism of this BRAF to CRAF isoform switching in response to oncogenic RAS has recently been described. Activation of the MAPK pathway, which results from a mutation of NRAS, induces phosphorylation of BRAF on serine 151 by ERK which prevents its binding to NRAS. To circumvent this negative feedback inhibition of BRAF, melanoma cells containing a mutation of RAS use CRAF to activate MEK/ERK. However, because the cAMP pathway in melanocytes constitutively inhibits CRAF, RAF isoform switching in melanoma is accompanied by an inhibition of the cAMP pathway. This inhibition is due to an increase in phosphodiesterase activity, which degrades cAMP thereby preventing inhibition of CRAF by PKA. These data highlight the importance of CRAF downstream of oncogenic Ras in tumor development.
The RAS to extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signal transduction cascade is crucial to cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival. Although numerous growth factors activate the RAS-ERK pathway, they can have different effects on the amplitude and duration of the ERK signal and, therefore, on the biological consequences. For instance, nerve growth factor, which elicits a larger and more sustained increase in ERK phosphorylation in PC12 cells than does epidermal growth factor (EGF), stimulates PC12 cell differentiation, whereas EGF stimulates PC12 cell proliferation. Here, we show that protein arginine methylation limits the ERK1/2 signal elicited by particular growth factors in different cell types from various species. We found that this restriction in ERK1/2 phosphorylation depended on methylation of RAF proteins by protein arginine methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5). PRMT5-dependent methylation enhanced the degradation of activated CRAF and BRAF, thereby reducing their catalytic activity. Inhibition of PRMT5 activity or expression of RAF mutants that could not be methylated not only affected the amplitude and duration of ERK phosphorylation in response to growth factors but also redirected the response of PC12 cells to EGF from proliferation to differentiation. This additional level of regulation within the RAS pathway may lead to the identification of new targets for therapeutic intervention.
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by memory loss and the upregulation of pro-neuroinflammatory factors such as cRaf-1, cyclooxygenase-2 (Cox-2), and the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB), as well as a downregulation of protein kinase A (PKA) activity and the activation by phosphorylation of its downstream factor CREB. We investigated the effect of the anti-cancer cRaf-1 inhibitor, sorafenib tosylate (Nexavar), on the expression of these factors and on the cognitive performance of aged APPswe mice. We found that chronic treatment with sorafenib stimulated PKA and CREB phosphorylation and inhibited cRaf-1 and NF-kappaB in the brains of APPswe mice. NF-kappaB controls the expression of several genes related to AD pathology, including iNOS and Cox-(2)Concurrent with NF-kappaB inhibition, sorafenib treatment decreased the cerebral expression of Cox-2 and iNOS in APPswe mice. It has recently been observed that Cox-2 inhibition prevents cognitive impairment in a mouse model of AD and amyloid beta peptide (Abeta)-induced inhibition of long-term potentiation (LTP). Consistent with the idea that Cox-2 inhibition can improve cognitive abilities, we found that sorafenib restored working memory abilities in aged APPswe mice without reducing Abeta levels in the brain. These findings suggest that sorafenib reduced AD pathology by reducing neuroinflammation.
Epidemiological data suggest that epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) possesses chemopreventive properties against cancer. In this study, we examined the molecular mechanisms of EGCG in human pancreatic cancer cells. EGCG caused growth arrest at G1 stage of cell cycle through regulation of cyclin D1, cdk4, cdk6, p21/WAF1/CIP1 and p27/KIP1, and induced apoptosis through generation of reactive oxygen species and activation of caspase-3 and caspase-9. EGCG inhibited expressions of Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL and induced expressions of Bax, Bak, Bcl-XS and PUMA. Mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) derived from Bax and Bak double knockout mice exhibited greater protection against EGCG-induced apoptosis than wild-type or single knockout MEFs. EGCG caused Bax activation in p53 -/- MEFs, suggesting that EGCG can induce apoptosis in the absence of p53. Furthermore, the activities of Ras, Raf-1 and ERK1/2 were inhibited, whereas the activities of MEKK1, JNK1/2 and p38 MAP kinases were induced by EGCG. Inhibition of cRaf-1 or ERK enhanced EGCG-induced apoptosis, whereas inhibition of JNK or p38 MAP kinase inhibited EGCG-induced apoptosis. EGCG inhibited the activation of p90 ribosomal protein S6 kinase, and induced the activation of cJUN. Our results suggest that EGCG induces growth arrest and apoptosis through multiple mechanisms, and can be used for pancreatic cancer prevention.
BAY 43-9006 is an oral inhibitor of CRAF, wild-type BRAF, mutant V599E BRAF, vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) 2, VEGFR3, mVEGFR2, FLT-3, platelet-derived growth factor receptor, p38, and c-kit among other kinases. A Phase I study of BAY 43-9006 identified 400 mg orally twice daily as the recommended Phase II dose. The Phase II results of a study of BAY 43-9006 at 400 mg orally twice daily were particularly interesting in patients with renal cell carcinoma. Data from the first 41 patients with renal cell carcinoma showed that 30% of patients had stable disease (defined as between 25% reduction and 25% growth), 40% had responded (defined as &gt;25% reduction), and 30% had progressed. Disease could be stabilized for periods in excess of a year. Some lesions became cystic and could actually enlarge while developing a low attenuation core. This phenomenon is recognized in the treatment of gastrointestinal stromal tumors with imatinib mesylate. The toxic effects of BAY 43-9006 were manageable and included hypertension, edema, diarrhea, hand and foot syndrome, rash, and hair loss where the rash involved the scalp. There was an impression of tachyphylaxis such that patients who required a dose reduction could be restored to full dose after a few months. A Phase III randomized, placebo-controlled trial of BAY 43-9006 has started for patients whose renal cell carcinoma has progressed within 6 months of immunotherapy. Combination studies with interferon, interleukin 2, bevacizumab, and chemotherapy are under consideration. The therapeutic targets of BAY 43-9006 in renal cell carcinoma remain unclear. Unlike melanoma, BRAF mutations have not been found in renal cell carcinoma. Other candidate targets include VEGFR2 and VEGFR3.
Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a severe problem throughout the world and requires identification of novel targets for its treatment. This multifactorial disease accounts for about 15% of the all diagnosed leukemia cases. Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway is crucial for the cell survival and its dysregulation is being implicated in various types of cancers. In here, we have discussed the potential role of various miRNAs that are found involved in regulating the proteins cascades of MAPK signaling pathway associated with CML. An emphasis has been paid to summarize the influence of various miRNAs in elevating or suppressing the expression level of significant proteins such as miR-203, miR-196a, miR-196b, miR-30a, miR-29b, miR-138 in BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase; miR-126, miR-221, miR-128, miR-15a, miR-188-5p, miR-17 in CRK family proteins; miR-155, miR-181a with SOS proteins; miR-155, miR-19a, with KRAS proteins; miR-19a with RAF1 protein; and miR-17, miR-19a, miR-17-92 cluster with MAPK/ERK proteins. In light of ever-increasing importance and ever-widening regulatory roles of miRNAs in cells, we have reviewed the recent progress in the field of miRNAs and have tried to suggest them as controlling targets for various protein cascades of MAPK signaling pathway. An understanding of the supervisory mechanism of MAPK by miRNAs might provide novel targets for treating CML.
Clinical heterogeneity is a major barrier to effective treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Emerging evidence suggests that constitutive activation of various signaling pathways like mitogen-activated protein kinase-extracellular signal-regulated kinase (MAPK-Erk) signaling plays a role in the heterogeneous clinical outcome of CLL patients. In this study, we have investigated the role of Sprouty (SPRY)2 as a negative regulator of receptor and nonreceptor tyrosine kinase signaling in the pathogenesis of CLL. We show that SPRY2 expression is significantly decreased in CLL cells, particularly from poor-prognosis patients compared with those from good-prognosis patients. Overexpression of SPRY2 in CLL cells from poor-prognosis patients increased their apoptosis. Conversely, downregulation of SPRY2 in CLL cells from good-prognosis patients resulted in increased proliferation. Furthermore, CLL cells with low SPRY2 expression grew more rapidly in a xenograft model of CLL. Strikingly, B-cell-specific transgenic overexpression of spry2 in mice led to a decrease in the frequency of B1 cells, the precursors of CLL cells in rodents. Mechanistically, we show that SPRY2 attenuates the B-cell receptor (BCR) and MAPK-Erk signaling by binding to and antagonizing the activities of RAF1, BRAF, and spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK) in normal B cells and CLL cells. We also show that SPRY2 is targeted by microRNA-21, which in turn leads to increased activity of Syk and Erk in CLL cells. Taken together, these results establish SPRY2 as a critical negative regulator of BCR-mediated MAPK-Erk signaling in CLL, thereby providing one of the molecular mechanisms to explain the clinical heterogeneity of CLL.
RASopathies are autosomal dominant disorders caused by mutations in more than 10 known genes that regulate the RAS/MAPK pathway. Noonan syndrome (NS) is a RASopathy characterized by a distinctive facial appearance, musculoskeletal abnormalities, and congenital heart defects. We have recently identified mutations in RIT1 in patients with NS. To delineate the clinical manifestations in RIT1 mutation-positive patients, we further performed a RIT1 analysis in RASopathy patients and identified 7 RIT1 mutations, including two novel mutations, p.A77S and p.A77T, in 14 of 186 patients. Perinatal abnormalities, including nuchal translucency, fetal hydrops, pleural effusion, or chylothorax and congenital heart defects, are observed in all RIT1 mutation-positive patients. Luciferase assays in NIH 3T3 cells demonstrated that the newly identified RIT1 mutants, including p.A77S and p.A77T, and the previously identified p.F82V, p.T83P, p.Y89H, and p.M90I, enhanced Elk1 transactivation. Genotype-phenotype correlation analyses of previously reported NS patients harboring RIT1, PTPN11, SOS1, RAF1, and KRAS revealed that hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (56 %) was more frequent in patients harboring a RIT1 mutation than in patients harboring PTPN11 (9 %) and SOS1 mutations (10 %). The rates of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy were similar between patients harboring RIT1 mutations and patients harboring RAF1 mutations (75 %). Short stature (52 %) was less prevalent in patients harboring RIT1 mutations than in patients harboring PTPN11 (71 %) and RAF1 (83 %) mutations. These results delineate the clinical manifestations of RIT1 mutation-positive NS patients: high frequencies of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, atrial septal defects, and pulmonary stenosis; and lower frequencies of ptosis and short stature.
The management of gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST) evolved due to effective molecularly targeted therapy with imatinib and sunitinib which are used first- and second-line, respectively. However, due to the development of resistance to those drugs in the majority of patients, the need for third-line therapy arose.
Regorafenib, an oral multitargeted inhibitor with activity against multiple kinases including KIT, RET, RAF1, BRAF, angiogenesis (VEGFR, TIE-2) and those involved in tumor microenvironment (PDGFR and FGFR) was introduced after the successful Phase III GRID (GIST - Regorafenib In progressive Disease) clinical trial. This study showed significant improvement in progression-free survival for patients receiving regorafenib compared to placebo (4.8 months vs 0.9 months). The treatment was reasonably well tolerated, with arterial hypertension, hand-foot syndrome, diarrhea being the most common grade ≥3 adverse events, which could be managed by dose reduction and supportive treatment. The aim of this paper is to describe, assess and advise on the safety of regorafenib as third-line therapy in GIST.
Regorafenib has demonstrated clinical benefit in GIST patients after progression on prior treatment with at least imatinib/sunitinib and currently it is the approved standard third-line option in therapy of advanced GIST. The safety profile is similar to other multikinase inhibitors with anti-VEGFR activity and is manageable.
Gefitinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor that has been used for the treatment of non-small-cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC). The ability of miR-7 to enhance gefitinib-induced cytotoxicity in NSCLC cells was evaluated in this study. We found that miR-7 significantly decreased the IC50 of gefitinib and inhibited cell growth. G0/G1 cell cycle arrest and cell apoptosis were increased after the treatment of gefitinib coupled with miR-7 transfection. In addition, levels of Raf1, IGF1R, and PI3K and phosphorylation levels of Akt and ERK were also significantly decreased. Our results suggest that miR-7 may provide a novel therapeutic target for the treatment of NSCLCs.
Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), a clonal hyperproliferation of immature blood cells accounts for 20% of adult leukemia cases. Reciprocal translocation of chromosomes 9 and 22, results into Bcr-Abl fusion and is responsible for expression of a tyrosine kinase protein p210(bcr/abl), which mediates several survival pathways and confer therapeutic resistance. Protein kinase C (PKC), a family of serine threonine kinases play an important role in the process of leukemogenesis. A crosstalk between Bcr-Abl and PKC signaling has been documented. Therefore, targeting p210(bcr/abl) and its associated signaling proteins using non-toxic natural means will be an effective strategy for antileukemic therapy. Aim of the present study is to investigate whether PEITC, a natural isothiocyanate in combination with imatinib mesylate (IM), a tyrosine kinase inhibitor could increase the therapeutic efficacy of IM by modulating the expression of p210(bcr/abl). Enhanced cytotoxic efficacy of IM by PEITC was further validated using another myelogenous leukemia cell line, KU812. It was observed that PEITC in combination with IM efficiently downregulated the expression of p210(bcr/abl) in chronic myelogenous leukemia cell lines (K-562). PEITC inhibited the expressions of PKCα, PKCβII and PKCζ (both phosphorylated and total form). Expression of Raf1 and ERK1/2, two important target proteins in PKC signaling cascade was diminished. The result indicated that PEITC ultimately reduced expression of Raf1 and ERK1/2 through Bcr-Abl and PKC inhibition. This result was further confirmed by UCN-01, a selective PKC inhibitor and IM; indicating an association between p210(bcr/abl) and PKC with Raf1 and ERK1/2. PEITC thus may have enormous potential in synergistic therapy of leukemia by enhancing drug efficacy.
Most cases of Noonan syndrome (NS) result from mutations in one of the RAS-MAPK signaling genes, including PTPN11, SOS1, KRAS, NRAS, RAF1, BRAF, SHOC2, MEK1 (MAP2K1), and CBL. Cardiovascular diseases of varying severity, such as pulmonary stenosis and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), are common in NS patients. RAF1 mutations are most frequent in NS with HCM, while PTPN11 mutations are also well known. Thr73Ile is a gain-of-function mutation of PTPN11, which has been highly associated with juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia and NS/myeloproliferative disease (MPD), but has not previously been reported in HCM. Here, we report a Japanese female infant with NS carrying the PTPN11 T73I mutation with NS/MPD, complete atrio-ventricular septal defect, and rapidly progressive HCM. No other HCM-related mutations were detected in PTPN11, RAF1, KRAS, BRAF, and SHOC2. This patient provides additional information regarding the genotype-phenotype correlation for PTPN11 T73I mutation in NS.
Vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR2) directed therapies result in a modest survival benefit for patients with advanced esophageal and gastroesophageal (GE) junction cancer. Platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) may contribute to escape from VEGFR2 inhibition. We evaluated the efficacy of sorafenib, a broad spectrum tyrosine kinase inhibitor targeting VEGFR2 and PDGFR as well as RET and RAF1, in patients with metastatic chemotherapy refractory esophageal and GE junction cancer.
This phase II trial of sorafenib 400 mg twice daily enrolled chemotherapy refractory patients with metastatic esophageal and GE junction cancer with primary endpoint of progression-free survival (PFS) rate at two months. Secondary endpoints included overall survival, objective response rate and toxicity.
Among 34 patients, 8 week Kaplan-Meier estimated PFS was 61% (90%CI 45 to 73%). Median PFS is 3.6 months (95% CI 1.8 to 3.9 months), with median overall survival OS 9.7 months (95% CI 5.9 to 11.6 months). Grade 3 toxicities were uncommon and included hand foot skin reaction, rash, dehydration and fatigue. One patient (3%) with ongoing complete response and remains on trial for over 5 years. Whole exome sequencing of this tumor revealed mutations in many cancer-associated genes including ARID1A, PIK3CA, and TP53, and focal amplifications of HMGA2 and MET.
Sorafenib therapy results in disease stabilization and encouraging PFS in patients with refractory esophageal and GE junction cancer.

For carcinoma of unknown primary site (CUP), determining the primary tumor site may be uninformative and often does not improve outcome.
To discover opportunities for targeted therapies in patients with CUP not currently searched for in routine practice.
Comprehensive genomic profiling on 200 CUP formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded specimens (mean, 756× coverage) using the hybrid-capture-based FoundationOne assay at academic and community oncology clinics.
Presence of targetable genomic alterations (GAs) in CUP and responses to targeted therapies.
There were 125 adenocarcinomas of unknown primary site (ACUPs) and 75 carcinomas of unknown primary site without features of adenocarcinoma (non-ACUPs). At least 1 GA was found in 192 (96%) of CUP specimens, with a mean (SD) of 4.2 (2.8) GAs per tumor. The most frequent GAs were in TP53 (110 [55%]), KRAS (40 [20%]), CDKN2A (37 [19%]), MYC (23 [12%]), ARID1A (21 [11%]), MCL1 (19 [10%]), PIK3CA (17 [9%]), ERBB2 (16 [8%]), PTEN (14 [7%]), EGFR (12 [6%]), SMAD4 (13 [7%]), STK11 (13 [7%]), SMARCA4 (12 [6%]), RB1 (12 [6%]), RICTOR (12 [6%]), MLL2 (12 [6%]), BRAF (11 [6%]), and BRCA2 (11 [6%]). One or more potentially targetable GAs were identified in 169 of 200 (85%) CUP specimens. Mutations or amplifications of ERBB2 were more frequent in ACUPs (13 [10%]) than in non-ACUPs (3 [4%]). Alterations of EGFR (10 [8%] vs 2 [3%]) and BRAF (8 [6%] vs 3 [4%]) were more common in ACUPs than in non-ACUPs. Strikingly, clinically relevant alterations in the receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK)/Ras signaling pathway including alterations in ALK, ARAF, BRAF, EGFR, FGFR1, FGFR2, KIT, KRAS, MAP2K1, MET, NF1, NF2, NRAS, RAF1, RET, and ROS1 were found in 90 (72%) ACUPs but in only 29 (39%) non-ACUPs (P &lt; .001).
Almost all CUP samples harbored at least 1 clinically relevant GA with potential to influence and personalize therapy. The ACUP tumors were more frequently driven by GAs in the highly druggable RTK/Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway than the non-ACUP tumors. Comprehensive genomic profiling can identify novel treatment paradigms to address the limited options and poor prognoses of patients with CUP.
This is the first cohort in which hearing impairment and external ear anomalies in Noonan Syndrome are described extensively.
Retrospective analysis of the otorhinolaryngological and clinical genetic data from 97 Noonan Syndrome (NS) patients. Forty-four NS patients were seen by an otorhinolaryngologist for the analysis of hearing impairment. In our cohort 80 of the 97 patients were genetically tested. In 71 of these mutations were found: in 48 patients a mutation in PTPN11, in 10 patients in SOS1, in 5 patients in SHOC2, in 5 patients in RAF1, in 1 patient in MAP2K2, in 1 patient in KRAS and in 1 patient in A2ML1.
External ear anomalies were reported in 75 NS patients (77%). In 69 patients the ears were low-set, 28 patients had posteriorly rotated ears, 14 patients showed protruding ears and 18 had thickened helices. Hearing impairment was detected in 34 NS patients. Nine patients had sensorineural hearing impairment, two a permanent conductive hearing impairment, two other patients had mixed hearing impairment and 20 patients had conductive hearing impairment in the past, caused by otitis media with effusion. Their temporary conductive hearing impairment resolved between the ages of 2 and 18 years. Sensorineural hearing impairment varied between mild high-frequency hearing impairment and profound (uni- and bilateral) hearing impairment and was progressive in three patients. Four NS patients received cochlear implants for their severe sensorineural hearing impairment. The cohort is small for genotype-phenotype correlations, but sensorineural hearing impairment, especially the bilateral severe hearing impairment, was only seen in patients with a PTPN11 mutation.
NS is characterized by dysmorphic external ear anomalies and both sensorineural and conductive hearing impairment. Audiological examinations are recommended in all patients with Noonan Syndrome.
Protein tyrosine phosphatase interacting protein 51 (PTPIP51) is upregulated in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) and expression levels correlate with the grade of malignancy in gliomas. A similar correlation was reported for its interacting partner 14-3-3β, which has been shown to facilitate the interaction of PTPIP51 with cRAF (Raf1). Since the interaction of these signalling partners stimulates growth factor signalling downstream of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), a major drug target in GBM, we here investigated the impact of EGFR inhibition by small molecule inhibitors or monoclonal antibody on PTPIP51. The effect of EGFR inhibition on PTPIP51 mRNA, protein expression and its interaction profile in GBM was analyzed using the U87 cell line as model system. The transferability of the results to in vivo conditions was evaluated in cultured tumour cells from GBM patients. Cells were treated either to the small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor of EGFR Gefitinib or the monoclonal antibody Cetuximab in a time and dose dependent manner. Gefitinib treatment decreased the proliferation rate and induced apoptosis in U87 and primary tumour cells. The PTPIP51 interaction profile changed in correlation to the applied Gefitinib. Despite unchanged mRNA levels PTPIP51 protein was reduced. In contrast, treatment with Cetuximab had no effects on PTPIP51 expression. In conclusion, our results demonstrate the impact of EGFR inhibition by Gefitinib on PTPIP51 protein expression, a downstream regulator of MAPK signalling. These data will serve as a basis to unravel the precise role of PTPIP51-mediated signalling in GBM and its potential implications for Gefitinib-mediated therapy in future studies.
Large-scale sequencing has characterized an enormous number of genetic variations (GVs), and the functional analysis of GVs is fundamental to understanding differences in disease susceptibility and therapeutic response among and within populations. Using a combination of a sequence-based predictor with known phosphorylation and protein-protein interaction information, we computationally detected 9606 potential phosSNPs (phosphorylation-related single nucleotide polymorphisms), including 720 known, disease-associated SNPs that dramatically modify the human phosSNP-associated kinase-substrate network. Further analyses demonstrated that the proteins in the network are heavily associated in various signaling and cancer pathways, while cancer genes and drug targets are significantly enriched. We re-constructed four population-specific kinase-substrate networks and found that several inherited disease or cancer genes, such as IRS1, RAF1, and EGFR, were differentially regulated by phosSNPs. Thus, phosSNPs may influence disease susceptibility and be involved in cancer development by reconfiguring phosphorylation networks in different populations. Moreover, by systematically characterizing potential phosphorylation-related cancer mutations (phosCMs) in 12 types of cancers, we observed that both types of GVs preferentially occur in the known cancer genes, while a considerable number of phosphorylated proteins, especially those over-representing cancer genes, contain both phosSNPs and phosCMs. Furthermore, it was observed that phosSNPs were significantly enriched in amplification genes identified from breast cancers and tyrosine kinase circuits of lung cancers. Taken together, these results should prove helpful for further elucidation of the functional impacts of disease-associated SNPs.
Lung adenocarcinomas harboring activating mutations in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) represent a common molecular subset of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cases. EGFR mutations predict sensitivity to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) and thus represent a dependency in NSCLCs harboring these alterations, but the genetic basis of EGFR dependence is not fully understood. Here, we applied an unbiased, ORF-based screen to identify genetic modifiers of EGFR dependence in EGFR-mutant NSCLC cells. This approach identified 18 kinase and kinase-related genes whose overexpression can substitute for EGFR in EGFR-dependent PC9 cells, and these genes include seven of nine Src family kinase genes, FGFR1, FGFR2, ITK, NTRK1, NTRK2, MOS, MST1R, and RAF1. A subset of these genes can complement loss of EGFR activity across multiple EGFR-dependent models. Unbiased gene-expression profiling of cells overexpressing EGFR bypass genes, together with targeted validation studies, reveals EGFR-independent activation of the MEK-ERK and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)-AKT pathways. Combined inhibition of PI3K-mTOR and MEK restores EGFR dependence in cells expressing each of the 18 EGFR bypass genes. Together, these data uncover a broad spectrum of kinases capable of overcoming dependence on EGFR and underscore their convergence on the PI3K-AKT and MEK-ERK signaling axes in sustaining EGFR-independent survival.
Constitutively active receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) are known oncogenic drivers and provide valuable therapeutic targets in many cancer types. However, clinical efficacy of RTK inhibitors is limited by intrinsic and acquired resistance. To identify genes conferring resistance to inhibition of the MET RTK, we conducted a forward genetics screen in the GTL-16 gastric cancer cell line, carrying MET amplification and exquisitely sensitive to MET inhibition. Cells were transduced with three different retroviral cDNA expression libraries and selected for growth in the presence of the MET inhibitor PHA-665752. Selected cells displayed robust and reproducible enrichment of library-derived cDNAs encoding truncated forms of RAF1 and BRAF proteins, whose silencing reversed the resistant phenotype. Transduction of naïve GTL-16 cells with truncated, but not full length, RAF1 and BRAF conferred in vitro and in vivo resistance to MET inhibitors, which could be reversed by MEK inhibition. Induction of resistance by truncated RAFs was confirmed in other MET-addicted cell lines, and further extended to EGFR-addicted cells. These data show that truncated RAF1 and BRAF proteins, recently described as products of genomic rearrangements in gastric cancer and other malignancies, have the ability to render neoplastic cells resistant to RTK-targeted therapy.
Memantine (MEM) is used for improving the cognitive impairments of the patients suffering from Alzheimer's disease (AD) by multiple neuroprotective mechanisms. However, it is still not clear whether nerve growth factor (NGF) signaling is involved in the mechanisms of MEM. The present study investigated the neuroprotective effects of MEM treatment on the cognitive performance and amyloidosis in APP/PS1 transgenic mice, and disclosed the NGF-related mechanism of MEM. We found that MEM treatment improved the cognitive performance by decreasing the escape latency and path length in the navigation test, by shortening the duration in target quadrant and reducing the frequency to pass through the target in probe trial, and by prolonging the latency and decreasing the frequencies of entering the dark compartment in passive avoidance test. The over-expressions of Aβ(1-42) and amyloid precursor protein (APP) were also decreased in the brains of APP/PS1 mice. Interestingly, MEM treatment improved the decreased NGF levels in APP/PS1 mice. Furthermore, NGF/TrkA signaling was activated by increasing the phosphorylation levels of tyrosine kinase (TrkA), proto-oncogene serine/threonine-protein kinase, Raf1 (c-Raf), extracellular regulated protein kinases (ERK)1/2 and cAMP-response element binding protein (CREB) after MEM treatment. Simultaneously, MEM also inhibited NGF/p75(NTR) signaling via decreasing the cleavage substrate of p75(NTR), increasing the JNK2 phosphorylation and decreasing the levels of p53 and cleaved-caspase 3. Therefore, the dual-regulation on NGF signaling was attributed to the improvements of cognitive deficits and Aβ depositions in APP/PS1 mice. In conclusion, MEM treatment activated the NGF/TrkA signaling, and inhibited the p75(NTR) signaling in APP/PS1 mice to ameliorate the behavioral deficits and amyloidosis, indicating that NGF signaling was a new potential target of MEM treatment for AD therapy.
Extramammary Paget's disease (EMPD) is a rare cutaneous malignant neoplasm. The genetic alterations underlying its pathogenesis have less been described. Therefore, we analyzed the possible mutations in the KRAS, HRAS, NRAS, BRAF, ARAF, RAF1, PIK3CA, AKT1, CTNNB1 and APC genes as well as methylation and expression of CDH1 in 144 EMPD cases and 42 matched normal skin tissues. A distinct mutation profile was identified in EMPDs with 27 (19%) cases mutant for RAS and RAF genes and 50 (35%) cases harboring oncogenic mutations in PIK3CA and AKT1. Moreover, a mutually exclusive pattern was observed in the genetic variants in these two signaling pathways. No mutation was detected in CTNNB1 and APC genes. High prevalence of low expression and hypermethylation of CDH1 gene was detected in 33 and 48% of the EMPD cases, respectively. Furthermore, PIK3CA and AKT1 mutations were significantly correlated with CDH1 hypermethylation which could explain why the majority of EMPD cases with mutant PIK3CA and AKT1 were invasive. Our study demonstrates that genetic variants associated with constitutive activation of RAS/RAF and PI3K/AKT pathways are involved in the pathogenesis of EMPD. This may represent novel therapeutic targets for this skin cancer.
Urothelial carcinoma (UC) is characterized by frequent gene mutations of which activating mutations in FGFR3 are the most frequent. Several downstream targets of FGFR3 are also mutated in UC, e.g., PIK3CA, AKT1, and RAS. Most mutation studies of UCs have been focused on single or a few genes at the time or been performed on small sample series. This has limited the possibility to investigate co-occurrence of mutations.
We performed mutation analyses of 16 genes, FGFR3, PIK3CA, PIK3R1 PTEN, AKT1, KRAS, HRAS, NRAS, BRAF, ARAF, RAF1, TSC1, TSC2, APC, CTNNB1, and TP53, in 145 cases of UC. We show that FGFR3 and PIK3CA mutations are positively associated. In addition, we identified PIK3R1 as a target for mutations. We demonstrate a negative association at borderline significance between FGFR3 and RAS mutations, and show that these mutations are not strictly mutually exclusive. We show that mutations in BRAF, ARAF, RAF1 rarely occurs in UC. Our data emphasize the possible importance of APC signaling as 6% of the investigated tumors either showed inactivating APC or activating CTNNB1 mutations. TSC1, as well as TSC2, that constitute the mTOR regulatory tuberous sclerosis complex were found to be mutated at a combined frequency of 15%.
Our data demonstrate a significant association between FGFR3 and PIK3CA mutations in UC. Moreover, the identification of mutations in PIK3R1 further emphasizes the importance of the PI3-kinase pathway in UC. The presence of TSC2 mutations, in addition to TSC1 mutations, underlines the involvement of mTOR signaling in UC.
Myofibroblasts play critical roles in the development of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis by depositing components of extracellular matrix. One source of lung myofibroblasts is thought to be alveolar epithelial type 2 cells that undergo epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Rat RLE-6TN alveolar epithelial type 2 cells treated with transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) are converted into myofibroblasts through EMT. TGF-β induces both canonical Smad signaling and non-canonical signaling, including the Ras-induced ERK pathway (Raf-MEK-ERK). However, the signaling mechanisms regulating TGF-β1-induced EMT are not fully understood. Here, we show that the Ras-ERK pathway negatively regulates TGF-β1-induced EMT in RLE-6TN cells and that DA-Raf1 (DA-Raf), a splicing isoform of A-Raf and a dominant-negative antagonist of the Ras-ERK pathway, plays an essential role in EMT. Stimulation of the cells with fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2), which activated the ERK pathway, prominently suppressed TGF-β1-induced EMT. An inhibitor of MEK, but not an inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, rescued the TGF-β1-treated cells from the suppression of EMT by FGF2. Overexpression of a constitutively active mutant of a component of the Ras-ERK pathway, i.e., H-Ras, B-Raf, or MEK1, interfered with EMT. Knockdown of DA-Raf expression with siRNAs facilitated the activity of MEK and ERK, which were only weakly and transiently activated by TGF-β1. Although DA-Raf knockdown abrogated TGF-β1-induced EMT, the abrogation of EMT was reversed by the addition of the MEK inhibitor. Furthermore, DA-Raf knockdown impaired the TGF-β1-induced nuclear translocation of Smad2, which mediates the transcription required for EMT. These results imply that intrinsic DA-Raf exerts essential functions for EMT by antagonizing the TGF-β1-induced Ras-ERK pathway in RLE-6TN cells.
Alveolar formation is coupled to the spatiotemporally regulated differentiation of alveolar myofibroblasts (AMYFs), which contribute to the morphological changes of interalveolar walls. Although the Ras-ERK signaling pathway is one of the key regulators for alveolar formation in developing lungs, the intrinsic molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying its role remain largely unknown. By analyzing the Ras-ERK signaling pathway during postnatal development of lungs, we have identified a critical role of DA-Raf1 (DA-Raf)-a dominant-negative antagonist for the Ras-ERK signaling pathway-in alveolar formation. DA-Raf-deficient mice displayed alveolar dysgenesis as a result of the blockade of AMYF differentiation. DA-Raf is predominantly expressed in type 2 alveolar epithelial cells (AEC2s) in developing lungs, and DA-Raf-dependent MEK1/2 inhibition in AEC2s suppresses expression of tissue inhibitor of matalloprotienase 4 (TIMP4), which prevents a subsequent proteolytic cascade matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)14-MMP2. Furthermore, MMP14-MMP2 proteolytic cascade regulates AMYF differentiation and alveolar formation. Therefore, DA-Raf-dependent inhibition of the Ras-ERK signaling pathway in AEC2s is required for alveolar formation via triggering MMP2 activation followed by AMYF differentiation. These findings reveal a pivotal role of the Ras-ERK signaling pathway in the dynamic regulation of alveolar development.
New therapeutic strategies are required to develop candidate drugs and ensure efficient delivery of these drugs to the brain and the central nervous system (CNS). Small interfering RNA (siRNA)-based therapies have been investigated as potential novel approaches for the treatment of brain disorders. Previously, we showed that Tat, a cell-penetrating peptide derived from HIV-Tat, and the modified block copolymers (MPEG-PCL-Tat) can form stable complexes with siRNA or can be loaded with an anticancer drug and efficiently deliver the drugs to the brain tissue via intranasal delivery. In this study, to develop a novel, efficient, and safe therapeutic strategy for managing brain disorders, we used MPEG-PCL-Tat micelles with a nose-to-brain delivery system to investigate its therapeutic effects on a rat model of malignant glioma using siRNA with a Raf-1 (siRaf-1)/camptothecin (CPT) codelivery system. MPEG-PCL-Tat and CPT-loaded MPEG-PCL-Tat can form a stable complex with siRNA with a particle size from 60 to 200 nm and a positive charge at N/P ratios up to 5. Additionally, MPEG-PCL-Tat/siRaf-1 and CPT-loaded MPEG-PCL-Tat/siRaf-1 have fostered cell death in rat glioma cells after the high cellular uptake of siRaf-1/drug by the MPEG-PCL-Tat carrier. Furthermore, compared to the unloaded MPEG-PCL-Tat/siRaf-1 complex, a CPT-loaded MPEG-PCL-Tat/siRaf-1 complex achieved the high therapeutic effect because of the additive effects of CPT and siRaf-1. These results indicate that drug/siRNA codelivery using MPEG-PCL-Tat nanomicelles with nose-to-brain delivery is an excellent therapeutic approach for brain and CNS diseases.
Cigarette smoke exposure increases the risk of stroke. Upregulation of 5-hydroxytryptamine 1B (5-HT(1) (B) ) receptors is associated with the pathogenesis of cerebral ischaemia. This study examined the hypothesis that the expression of 5-HT(1) (B) receptors is altered in brain vessels after secondhand smoke (SHS) exposure.
Rats were exposed to SHS in vivo for 200 min daily for 8 weeks. The contractile responses of isolated cerebral arteries were studies by a sensitive myograph. The mRNA and protein expression for 5-HT(1) (B) receptors were examined by real-time PCR, Western blot and immunofluorescence respectively. In addition, the phosphorylation of Raf/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)/mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) pathway was evaluated.
The results showed that SHS exposure shifted the 5-HT(1) (B) receptor-mediated concentration-contraction curve towards the left with a markedly increased maximal contraction. Furthermore, there were significant elevations in mRNA level and protein expression of 5-HT(1) (B) receptors in SHS-exposed rats. Immunostaining revealed that the 5-HT(1) (B) receptors were localized to the smooth muscle cells of cerebral arteries. SHS was also found to induce the phosphorylation of Raf-1 and ERK1/2 proteins. The administration of a Raf-1 inhibitor GW5074 attenuated the 5-HT(1) (B) receptor upregulation.
Secondhand smoke exposure upregulates cerebrovascular 5-HT(1) (B) receptors in rats. The receptor upregulation is associated with Raf/ERK/MAPK activation.
Atherosclerosis is characterized by hyperplastic neointima and an inflammatory response with cytokines such as TNFα. TNFα is a pleiotropic cytokine that mediates inflammatory, proliferative, cytostatic and cytotoxic effects in a variety of cell types, including endothelial cells and vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). Interestingly, TNFα has been shown to play two very opposing roles in these cell types; it inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis in endothelial cells, while it enhances the proliferation and migration of VSMCs. Here we show that TNFα is capable of stimulating proliferation of rat VSMCs as well as human VSMCs in a Raf-1/MAP K-dependent manner. TNFα could increase the expression of E2F-regulated proliferative cdc6, Thymidylate synthase (TS) and cdc25A genes in Aortic smooth muscle cells (AoSMC), as seen by real time PCR assays. There is an activation of the stress-induced kinase, JNK1, in VSMCs upon TNFα stimulation. TNFα was capable of inducing binding of the Raf-1 kinase to Rb, and treatment with the Rb-Raf-1 inhibitor, RRD-251, could prevent TNFα-induced S-phase entry in AoSMCs. In addition, inhibition of Raf-1 or Src kinases using pharmacologic inhibitors could also prevent S-phase entry, while inhibition of JNK was not as effective. These results suggest that inhibiting the Rb-Raf-1 interaction is a potential avenue to prevent VSMC proliferation associated with atherosclerosis.
Long-term morphine treatment enhances pain neurotransmitter [such as calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP)] levels in the spinal cord. It has been suggested previously that increased spinal CGRP may contribute to sustained morphine-mediated paradoxical pain sensitization and antinociceptive tolerance. Previous in vitro studies from our group indicated that Raf-1 kinase-mediated adenylyl cyclase superactivation played a crucial role in sustained morphine-mediated augmentation of basal and evoked CGRP release from cultured primary sensory neurons. The present study was aimed to evaluate the physiological significance of this molecular mechanism in vivo, in rats.
Rats were intrathecally (i.th) injected with a Raf-1-selective small interfering RNA (siRNA) mixture for 3 days and were subsequently infused with saline or morphine, s.c. for 7 days. Thermal and mechanical sensory thresholds of the animals were assessed by daily behavioural tests. After final behavioural testing (day 6), spinal cords were isolated from each animal group and spinal CGRP and Raf-1 protein levels were measured using elisa and immunohistochemistry.
Selective knockdown of spinal Raf-1 protein levels by i.th Raf-1-selective siRNA pretreatment significantly attenuated sustained morphine-mediated up-regulation of CGRP immunoreactivity in the spinal cord of rats and prevented the development of thermal hyperalgesia, mechanical allodynia and antinociceptive tolerance.
Raf-1 played a significant role in sustained morphine-mediated paradoxical pain sensitization and antinociceptive tolerance in vivo. These findings suggest novel pharmacological approaches to improve the long-term utility of opioids in the treatment of chronic pain.
The lacrimal gland is primarily responsible for the aqueous portion of the tear film. Simultaneous addition of cholinergic agonists or growth factors with cAMP-dependent agonists potentiates secretion. Recent investigations revealed that cAMP decreases p44/p42 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activity stimulated by cholinergic agonists and growth factors that could account for this potentiation. In this study the authors identify the signal transduction pathway used by cAMP to inhibit MAPK activity.
Rat lacrimal gland acini were incubated with H89, an inhibitor of protein kinase A, before the addition of dibutyryl cAMP (dbcAMP, 10(-3) M) for 30 minutes. Basal MAPK and CREB activity and MAPK activity after stimulation with the cholinergic agonist carbachol (Cch) or epidermal growth factor (EGF) for 5 minutes was determined. The effect of dbcAMP on EGF receptor activity and basal and stimulated Ras, Raf-1, mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK), and MAPK activity was determined. The effect of a Rap-1 inhibitor, GGTI-298, on MAPK activity after the addition of dbcAMP was also determined.
H89 relieved the inhibition of cAMP on MAPK activity and inhibited CREB activity. Incubation with dbcAMP did not have any effect either on the EGF receptor or on Ras but significantly inhibited both basal and Raf-1 and MEK activity stimulated with Cch or EGF. GGTI-298 did not have any effect on cAMP-dependent decrease in MAPK activity.
The authors conclude that cAMP mediates the inhibition of MAPK by PKA in a Raf-1-dependent manner.
Mutations in genes of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade have recently been shown to cause several syndromes characterized by dysmorphic facial features, growth retardation, cognitive impairment, heart disease and cutaneous abnormalities. This signalling pathway involves RAS and RAF proteins, and is central in the regulation of normal growth and the development of cancer.
We have studied 23 Norwegian patients for whom there was a clinical suspicion of Costello, Noonan or cardio-facio-cutaneous syndrome. Patients suspected of having Noonan syndrome had previously tested negative for mutations in the tyrosine phosphatase gene PTPN11. The material was examined for mutations in the HRAS, KRAS, RAF1 and BRAF genes. Two patients are described to illustrate diagnostic challenges and the usefulness of genetic testing.
Ten of 23 patients (43 %) had mutations affecting the RAS/MAPK signalling pathway. Mutations in HRAS were most common (five cases), while three patients had mutations in KRAS and two in RAF1. Spontaneous mutations were demonstrated in eight cases. Our data indicate an annual incidence of 1-2 new cases of congenital RAS/RAF mutations in Norway.
Upon clinical suspicion of syndromes of the RAS/MAPK signalling pathway, molecular genetic analyses may be essential for a correct diagnosis. Certain mutations are associated with an increased cancer risk, exemplifying that results of genetic laboratory testing may influence medical management.
The RAF-MEK-ERK pathway regulates both myoblast proliferation and differentiation; however, it is unclear how these events are coordinated. Here, we show that human phosphatidylethanolamine-binding protein 4 (PEBP4), a RAF kinase inhibitory protein (RKIP) family protein expressed preferentially in muscle, regulates the activity of the ERK pathway and myoblast differentiation by acting as a scaffold protein. In contrast to RKIP, which disrupts the RAF1-MEK interaction, PEBP4 forms ternary complexes with RAF1 and MEK, and can scaffold this interaction. PEBP4 expression is induced during the differentiation of primary human myoblasts. Consistent with the properties of a scaffold, PEBP4 enhances the RAF1-MEK interaction and the activation of MEK at low expression levels, whereas it inhibits these parameters at higher expression levels. Downregulation of PEBP4 by short hairpin RNA in human myoblasts increases MEK signalling and inhibits differentiation; by contrast, PEBP4 overexpression enhances differentiation. Thus, PEBP4 participates in the control of muscle cell differentiation by modulating the activity of MEK and ERK.
Ras activates Raf, leading to the extracellular-regulated kinase (ERK)-mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway, which is involved in a variety of cellular, physiological, and pathological responses. Thus, regulators of this Ras-Raf interaction play crucial roles in these responses. In this study, we report a novel regulator of the Ras-Raf interaction named DA-Raf1. DA-Raf1 is a splicing isoform of A-Raf with a wider tissue distribution than A-Raf. It contains the Ras-binding domain but lacks the kinase domain, which is responsible for activation of the ERK pathway. As inferred from its structure, DA-Raf1 bound to activated Ras as well as M-Ras and interfered with the ERK pathway. The Ras-ERK pathway is essential for the negative regulation of myogenic differentiation induced by growth factors. DA-Raf1 served as a positive regulator of myogenic differentiation by inducing cell cycle arrest, the expression of myogenin and other muscle-specific proteins, and myotube formation. These results imply that DA-Raf1 is the first identified competent, intrinsic, dominant-negative antagonist of the Ras-ERK pathway.
The contributions of specific residues to the delicate balance between function, stability and folding rates could be determined, in part by [corrected] comparing the sequences of structures having identical folds, but insignificant sequence homology. Recently, we have devised an experimental strategy to thoroughly explore residue substitutions consistent with a specific class of structure. Using this approach, the amino acids tolerated at virtually all residues of the c-Raf/Raf1 ras binding domain (Raf RBD), an exemplar of the common beta-grasp ubiquitin-like topology, were obtained and used to define the sequence determinants of this fold. Herein, we present analyses suggesting that more subtle sequence selection pressure, including propensity for secondary structure, the hydrophobic core organization and charge distribution are imposed on the Raf RBD sequence. Secondly, using the Gibbs free energies (DeltaG(F-U)) obtained for 51 mutants of Raf RBD, we demonstrate a strong correlation between amino acid conservation and the destabilization induced by truncating mutants. In addition, four mutants are shown to significantly stabilize Raf RBD native structure. Two of these mutations, including the well-studied R89L, are known to severely compromise binding affinity for ras. Another stabilized mutant consisted of a deletion of amino acid residues E104-K106. This deletion naturally occurs in the homologues a-Raf and b-Raf and could indicate functional divergence. Finally, the combination of mutations affecting five of 78 residues of Raf RBD results in stabilization of the structure by approximately 12 kJ mol(-1) (DeltaG(F-U) is -22 and -34 kJ mol(-1) for wt and mutant, respectively). The sequence perturbation approach combined with sequence/structure analysis of the ubiquitin-like fold provide a basis for the identification of sequence-specific requirements for function, stability and folding rate of the Raf RBD and structural analogues, highlighting the utility of conservation profiles as predictive tools of structural organization.
The expression of various proto-oncogenes in primary culture of lymphocytes from peripheral blood of bovine with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) was studied. Cellular proto-oncogenes encode proteins that propagate growth, differentiation or apoptosis signals from cell membrane to nucleus. The proliferation and differentiation of normal eukaryotic cells are precisely controlled. Tumor cells usually are characterized both by the continuous growth signal and by the block of cell differentiation. We have previously reported that along with spontaneous proliferation, bovine CLL lymphocytes continuously differentiate and enter apoptosis in vitro. CLL cells with an autocrine growth mechanism and at the same time undergoing spontaneous differentiation and apoptosis in vitro provide a new model system to investigate the possible involvement of various proto-oncogenes in the regulation of cellular proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis. Northern blot analysis revealed simultaneous expression of a number of proto-oncogenes in CLL cells. Transcripts of c-fos, c-myc, c-myb, A-raf, c-raf1, hck, IL-2 receptor alpha-chain (IL-2R alpha) were found in lymphocytes at the peak of their proliferative activity in culture. Kinetics studies demonstrated that CLL cells constitutively express transcripts of so-called immediate response nuclear proto-oncogenes c-myc, c-fos as well as cytoplasmic proto-oncogenes hck and c-raf1, i.e., genes coding for tyrosine and serine-threonine protein kinases, respectively. Expression level did not change significantly during all stages of CLL cells in culture. The results show that continuous expression of c-myc mRNA does not prevent CLL cell differentiation and may be associated with apoptotic cell death.
The RAS pathway is central to epidermal homeostasis, and its activation in tumors or in Rasopathies correlates with hyperproliferation. Downstream of RAS, RAF kinases are actionable targets regulating keratinocyte turnover; however, chemical RAF inhibitors paradoxically activate the pathway, promoting epidermal proliferation. We generated mice with compound epidermis-restricted BRAF/RAF1 ablation. In these animals, transient barrier defects and production of chemokines and Th2-type cytokines by keratinocytes cause a disease akin to human atopic dermatitis, characterized by IgE responses and local and systemic inflammation. Mechanistically, BRAF and RAF1 operate independently to balance MAPK signaling: BRAF promotes ERK activation, while RAF1 dims stress kinase activation. In vivo, JNK inhibition prevents disease onset, while MEK/ERK inhibition in mice lacking epidermal RAF1 phenocopies it. These results support a primary role of keratinocytes in the pathogenesis of atopic dermatitis, and the animals lacking BRAF and RAF1 in the epidermis represent a useful model for this disease.
A novel series of 1,3,4-triarylpyrazole derivatives possessing terminal arylamide or arylurea terminal moieties has been designed and synthesized. Their in vitro antiproliferative activities were investigated against a panel of 58 cell lines of nine different cancer types at the NCI, USA. The urea analogues 2b, 2c, and 2f as well as the amide derivatives 3e and 3f exerted the highest mean % inhibition values over the 58 cell line panel at 10 μM, and thus were further tested in 5-dose testing mode to determine their GI50, TGI, and LC50 values. The above mentioned compounds have shown stronger antiproliferative activities in terms of potency and efficacy upon comparing their results with Sorafenib as a reference compound. Among them, compounds 2c and 2f possessing 3,4-dichlorophenylurea terminal moiety showed the highest mean %inhibition value of about 99.85 and 104.15% respectively over the 58-cell line panel at 10 μM concentration. Also compounds 2b, 3e, and 3f exhibited mean % inhibition over 80% at 10 μM concentration. The GI50 value of compound 3e over K-562 cancer cell line was 0.75 μM. Accordingly, compound 2f was screened over seven kinases at a single-dose concentration of 10 μM to profile its kinase inhibitory activity. Interestingly, the compound showed highly inhibitory activities (90.44% and 87.71%) against BRAF (V600E) and RAF1 kinases, respectively. Its IC50 value against BRAF (V600E) was 0.77 μM. Compounds 2b, 2c, 2f, 3e, and 3f exerted high selectivity towards cancer cell lines than L132 normal lung cells.
Rasopathies are a group of rare disorders characterized by neurocardiofaciocutaneous involvement, and caused by mutations in several genes of the RAS/MAPK pathway. In the present study, we characterized growth parameters, body composition, and nutritional aspects of children and adults (n = 62) affected by these disorders, mainly Noonan syndrome, using an indirect method-anthropometry-and a 24-hr recall questionnaire. The growth parameters in our cohort showed short stature, especially in individuals with RAF1 and SHOC2 mutations, lower obesity rates compared to the control population, and BMI scores highest in individuals with BRAF mutations and lowest in individuals with SHOC2. Body composition showed a compromise in the upper arm muscle circumference, with a statistically significant difference in the z-score of triceps skinfold (P = 0.0204) and upper arm fat area (P = 0.0388) between BRAF and SHOC2 groups and in the z-score of triceps skinfold between RAF1 and SHOC2 (P = 0.0218). The pattern of macronutrient consumption was similar to the control population. Our study is the first to address body composition in RASopathy individuals and the data indicate a compromise not only in adipose tissue, but also in muscle mass. Studies using different techniques, such as dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry or imaging studies, which give a more precise delineation of fat and non-fat mass, are required to confirm our results, ultimately causing an impact on management strategies. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
Disseminated glioneuronal tumors of childhood are rare. We present a retrospective IRB-approved review of the clinical course and frequency of BRAF mutations in disseminated glioneuronal tumors at two institutions. Defining features of our cohort include diffuse leptomeningeal-spread, often with a discrete spinal cord nodule and oligodendroglioma-like histologic features. Patients were identified through a pathology database search of all cases with disseminated low-grade neoplasms with an oligodendroglioma-like component. De-identified clinical information was collected by chart review and all imaging was reviewed. We retrieved the results of targeted genomic analyses for alterations in BRAF. Ten patients (aged 2-14 years) were identified from the Dana-Farber/Boston Children's Hospital and the Royal Children's Hospital, Melbourne pathology databases. Nine patients received chemotherapy. Eight patients are alive, although three have had episodes of progressive disease. We identified genomic alterations affecting the MAPK pathway in six patients. One patient had a germline RAF1 mutation and a clinical diagnosis of cardio-facio-cutaneous syndrome. BRAF duplications were identified in four and BRAF V600E mutation was identified in one. These data support the presence of targetable genomic alterations in this disease.
Noonan syndrome (NS) is characterized by characteristic facies, short stature, congenital heart defect, and developmental delay of variable degree. Other findings can include broad or webbed neck, unusual chest shape with superior pectus carinatum and inferior pectus excavatum, cryptorchidism, varied coagulation defects, lymphatic dysplasias, and ocular abnormalities. Although birth length is usually normal, final adult height approaches the lower limit of normal. Congenital heart disease occurs in 50%-80% of individuals. Pulmonary valve stenosis, often with dysplasia, is the most common heart defect and is found in 20%-50% of individuals. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, found in 20%-30% of individuals, may be present at birth or develop in infancy or childhood. Other structural defects include atrial and ventricular septal defects, branch pulmonary artery stenosis, and tetralogy of Fallot. Up to one fourth of affected individuals have mild intellectual disability, and language impairments in general are more common in NS than in the general population.
NS is diagnosed on clinical grounds by observation of key features. Affected individuals have normal chromosome studies. Molecular genetic testing identifies a pathogenic variant in PTPN11 in 50% of affected individuals, SOS1 in approximately 13%, RAF1 and RIT1 each in 5%, and KRAS in fewer than 5%. Other genes in which pathogenic variants have been reported to cause Noonan syndrome in fewer than 1% of cases include NRAS, BRAF, and MAP2K1. Several additional genes associated with a Noonan-syndrome-like phenotype in fewer than ten individuals have been identified.
Treatment of manifestations: Cardiovascular anomalies in NS are usually treated as in the general population. Developmental disabilities are addressed by early intervention programs and individualized education strategies. Treatment for serious bleeding is guided by knowledge of the specific factor deficiency or platelet aggregation anomaly. Growth hormone (GH) treatment increases growth velocity. Surveillance: Monitoring of anomalies found in any system, especially cardiovascular abnormalities.
NS is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Although many individuals with NS have a de novo pathogenic variant, an affected parent is recognized in 30%-75% of families. The risk to sibs of a proband depends on the genetic status of the parents. If a parent is affected, the risk is 50%. When the parents are clinically unaffected, the risk to the sibs of a proband appears to be low (&lt;1%). Each child of an individual with Noonan syndrome has a 50% chance of inheriting the pathogenic variant. Prenatal testing is possible if the NS-related pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected family member.
Enabled by high-throughput sequencing approaches, epithelial cancers across a range of tissue types are seen to harbor gene fusions as integral to their landscape of somatic aberrations. Although many gene fusions are found at high frequency in several rare solid cancers, apart from fusions involving the ETS family of transcription factors which have been seen in approximately 50% of prostate cancers, several other common solid cancers have been shown to harbor recurrent gene fusions at low frequencies. On the other hand, many gene fusions involving oncogenes, such as those encoding ALK, RAF or FGFR kinase families, have been detected across multiple different epithelial carcinomas. Tumor-specific gene fusions can serve as diagnostic biomarkers or help define molecular subtypes of tumors; for example, gene fusions involving oncogenes such as ERG, ETV1, TFE3, NUT, POU5F1, NFIB, PLAG1, and PAX8 are diagnostically useful. Tumors with fusions involving therapeutically targetable genes such as ALK, RET, BRAF, RAF1, FGFR1-4, and NOTCH1-3 have immediate implications for precision medicine across tissue types. Thus, ongoing cancer genomic and transcriptomic analyses for clinical sequencing need to delineate the landscape of gene fusions. Prioritization of potential oncogenic "drivers" from "passenger" fusions, and functional characterization of potentially actionable gene fusions across diverse tissue types, will help translate these findings into clinical applications. Here, we review recent advances in gene fusion discovery and the prospects for medicine.
We queried whether extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma featured clinically relevant genomic alterations that could lead to targeted therapy.
Comprehensive genomic profiling by hybridisation capture of up to 315 genes was performed on 99 clinically advanced extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma.
There were 60 male and 39 female patients with a median age of 60.5 years. A total of 400 alterations were identified (mean 4.0; range 0-13) in 84 genes. Eighty-two (83%) of extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma patients featured at least one clinically relevant genomic alterations including KRAS (43%); ERBB2 (9%), PTEN (7%); ATM and NF1 (6%) and CCND1, FBXW7, GNAS, MDM2 and NRAS (all at 5%). BRAF, BRCA2, CDK4, CDK6, FGFR1, FGFR3, PTCH1, RAF1 and STK11 were each altered in a single patient. No IDH1/2 mutations or FGFR2 gene fusions were identified.
Comprehensive genomic profiling of extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma differs significantly from intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma and pancreatic adenocarcinoma, and reveals diverse opportunities for the use of targeted therapies.
Noonan syndrome (NS), a heterogeneous developmental disorder associated with variable clinical expression including short stature, congenital heart defect, unusual pectus deformity and typical facial features, is caused by activating mutations in genes involved in the RAS-MAPK signaling pathway.
Here, we present a clinical and molecular characterization of a small family with Noonan syndrome. Comprehensive mutation analysis of NF1, PTPN11, SOS1, CBL, BRAF, RAF1, SHOC2, MAP2K2, MAP2K1, SPRED1, NRAS, HRAS and KRAS was performed using targeted next-generation sequencing. The result revealed a recurrent mutation in NRAS, c.179G &gt; A (p.G60E), in the index patient. This mutation was inherited from the index patient's father, who also showed signs of NS.
We describe clinical features in this family and review the literature for genotype-phenotype correlations for NS patients with mutations in NRAS. Neither of affected individuals in this family presented with juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML), which together with previously published results suggest that the risk for NS individuals with a germline NRAS mutation developing JMML is not different from the proportion seen in other NS cases. Interestingly, 50% of NS individuals with an NRAS mutation (including our family) present with lentigines and/or Café-au-lait spots. This demonstrates a predisposition to hyperpigmented lesions in NRAS-positive NS individuals. In addition, the affected father in our family presented with a hearing deficit since birth, which together with lentigines are two characteristics of NS with multiple lentigines (previously LEOPARD syndrome), supporting the difficulties in diagnosing individuals with RASopathies correctly. The clinical and genetic heterogeneity observed in RASopathies is a challenge for genetic testing. However, next-generation sequencing technology, which allows screening of a large number of genes simultaneously, will facilitate an early and accurate diagnosis of patients with RASopathies.
Copy number alterations have been shown to be involved in melanoma pathogenesis. The randomized phase III clinical trial E2603: carboplatin, paclitaxel, ± sorafenib (CP vs. CPS) offers a large collection of tumor samples to evaluate association of somatic mutations, genomic alterations, and clinical outcomes, prior to current FDA-approved therapies.
Copy number and mutational analysis on 119 pretreatment samples was performed.
CPS therapy was associated with improved progression-free survival (PFS) compared with CP in patients with tumors with RAF1 (cRAF) gene copy gains (HR, 0.372; P = 0.025) or CCND1 gene copy gains (HR, 0.45; P = 0.035). CPS therapy was associated with improved overall survival (OS) compared with CP in patients with tumors with KRAS gene copy gains (HR, 0.25; P = 0.035). BRAF gene copy gain and MET amplification were more common in samples with V600K versus V600E mutations (P &lt; 0.001), which was validated in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset.
We observed improved treatment response with CPS in patients with melanoma whose tumors have RAF1 (cRAF), KRAS, or CCND1 amplification, all of which can be attributed to sorafenib targeting CRAF. These genomic alterations should be incorporated in future studies for evaluation as biomarkers.
A novel series of substituted pyrimidine compounds bearing N-phenylpyrazole and terminating with aryl and cyclic sulfonamido moiety were designed, synthesized, and evaluated in vitro as antiproliferative agents against a panel of 53 cell lines of different tissues at the NCI. Among them, compound 1d with p-chlorobenzenesulfonamido terminal moiety, ethylene spacer, and 4-chloro-3-methoxyphenyl ring at position 3 of the pyrazole nucleus showed the highest mean percentage inhibition value over the whole cancer cell line panel at 10 μM concentration. It showed broad-spectrum antiproliferative activity over many cell lines of different cancer types. For instance, compound 1d inhibited the growth of HL-60 (TB), SR leukemia, and T-47D and MCF-7 breast cancer cell line by 135.92%, 119.44%, 95.32%, and 82.03% at 10 μM, respectively. And it inhibited the growth of COLO 205 colon, HT29 colon, BT-549 breast, and ACHN renal cancer cell lines by more than 80% at the same test concentration. However, testing compound 1d upon determining its IC50 against the most sensitive cell lines showed to good extent selectivity against HT29 colon cancer cell line than HL-60 leukemia and MRC-5 lung fibroblasts (normal cells). Compound 1d was further tested against 12 kinases of different kinase families, and the highest inhibitory effect was exerted against RAF1, V600E-B-RAF, and V600K-B-RAF kinases.
Pancreatic acinar cell carcinomas (PACC) account for approximately 1% (∼500 cases) of pancreatic cancer diagnoses annually in the United States. Oncogenic therapuetic targets have proven elusive in this disease, and chemotherapy and radiotherapy have demonstrated limited efficacy against these tumors. Comprehensive genomic profiling of a large series of PACCs (n=44) identified recurrent rearrangements involving BRAF and RAF1 (CRAF) in approximately 23% of tumors. The most prevalent fusion, SND1-BRAF, resulted in activation of the MAPK pathway, which was abrogated with MEK inhibition. SND1-BRAF-transformed cells were sensitive to treatment with the MEK inhibitor trametinib. PACCs lacking RAF rearrangements were significantly enriched for genomic alterations, causing inactivation of DNA repair genes (45%); these genomic alterations have been associated with sensitivity to platinum-based therapies and PARP inhibitors. Collectively, these results identify potentially actionable genomic alterations in the majority of PACCs and provide a rationale for using personalized therapies in this disease.
PACC is genomically distinct from other pancreatic cancers. Fusions in RAF genes and mutually exclusive inactivation of DNA repair genes represent novel potential therapeutic targets that are altered in over two thirds of these tumors.
To describe 11 patients with cardiofaciocutaneous syndrome (CFC) and compare them with 130 patients with other RAS-MAPK syndromes (111 Noonan syndrome patients [NS] and 19 patients with LEOPARD syndrome).
Clinical data from patients submitted for genetic analysis were collected. Bidirectional sequencing analysis of PTPN11, SOS1, RAF1, BRAF, and MAP2K1 focused on exons carrying recurrent mutations, and of all KRAS exons were performed.
Six different mutations in BRAF were identified in 9 patients, as well as 2 MAP2K1 mutations. Short stature, developmental delay, language difficulties and ectodermal anomalies were more frequent in CFC patients when compared with other neuro-cardio-faciocutaneous syndromes (P&lt;.05). In at least 2 cases molecular testing helped reconsider the diagnosis.
CFC patients showed a rather severe phenotype but at least one patient with BRAF mutation showed no developmental delay, which illustrates the variability of the phenotypic spectrum caused by BRAF mutations. Molecular genetic testing is a valuable tool for differential diagnosis of CFC and NS related disorders.
Fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based detection of protein interactions is limited by the very narrow range of FRET-permitting distances. We show two different strategies for the rational design of weak helper interactions that co-recruit donor and acceptor fluorophores for a more robust detection of bimolecular FRET: (i) in silico design of electrostatically driven encounter complexes and (ii) fusion of tunable domain-peptide interaction modules based on WW or SH3 domains. We tested each strategy for optimization of FRET between (m)Citrine and mCherry, which do not natively interact. Both approaches yielded comparable and large increases in FRET efficiencies with little or no background. Helper-interaction modules can be fused to any pair of fluorescent proteins and could, we found, enhance FRET between mTFP1 and mCherry as well as between mTurquoise2 and mCitrine. We applied enhanced helper-interaction FRET (hiFRET) probes to study the binding between full-length H-Ras and Raf1 as well as the drug-induced interaction between Raf1 and B-Raf.
Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase (MAPK) pathway activation has been implicated in many types of human cancer. BRAF mutations that constitutively activate MAPK signalling and bypass the need for upstream stimuli occur with high prevalence in melanoma, colorectal carcinoma, ovarian cancer, papillary thyroid carcinoma, and cholangiocarcinoma. In this report we characterize the novel, potent, and selective BRAF inhibitor, dabrafenib (GSK2118436). Cellular inhibition of BRAF(V600E) kinase activity by dabrafenib resulted in decreased MEK and ERK phosphorylation and inhibition of cell proliferation through an initial G1 cell cycle arrest, followed by cell death. In a BRAF(V600E)-containing xenograft model of human melanoma, orally administered dabrafenib inhibited ERK activation, downregulated Ki67, and upregulated p27, leading to tumor growth inhibition. However, as reported for other BRAF inhibitors, dabrafenib also induced MAPK pathway activation in wild-type BRAF cells through CRAF (RAF1) signalling, potentially explaining the squamous cell carcinomas and keratoacanthomas arising in patients treated with BRAF inhibitors. In addressing this issue, we showed that concomitant administration of BRAF and MEK inhibitors abrogated paradoxical BRAF inhibitor-induced MAPK signalling in cells, reduced the occurrence of skin lesions in rats, and enhanced the inhibition of human tumor xenograft growth in mouse models. Taken together, our findings offer preclinical proof of concept for dabrafenib as a specific and highly efficacious BRAF inhibitor and provide evidence for its potential clinical benefits when used in combination with a MEK inhibitor.
The most common pediatric brain tumors are low-grade gliomas (LGGs). We used whole-genome sequencing to identify multiple new genetic alterations involving BRAF, RAF1, FGFR1, MYB, MYBL1 and genes with histone-related functions, including H3F3A and ATRX, in 39 LGGs and low-grade glioneuronal tumors (LGGNTs). Only a single non-silent somatic alteration was detected in 24 of 39 (62%) tumors. Intragenic duplications of the portion of FGFR1 encoding the tyrosine kinase domain (TKD) and rearrangements of MYB were recurrent and mutually exclusive in 53% of grade II diffuse LGGs. Transplantation of Trp53-null neonatal astrocytes expressing FGFR1 with the duplication involving the TKD into the brains of nude mice generated high-grade astrocytomas with short latency and 100% penetrance. FGFR1 with the duplication induced FGFR1 autophosphorylation and upregulation of the MAPK/ERK and PI3K pathways, which could be blocked by specific inhibitors. Focusing on the therapeutically challenging diffuse LGGs, our study of 151 tumors has discovered genetic alterations and potential therapeutic targets across the entire range of pediatric LGGs and LGGNTs.
We recently found that TMPRSS2:ERG fusion genes and PTEN loss, which are common in Western prostate cancers are infrequent in Chinese cases. As previous studies indicated a higher frequency of RAS and BRAF mutation rates in Eastern Asian than in Western prostate cancers and fusion genes involving the RAF family genes BRAF and RAF1 were recently identified in prostate cancer in the American population, we investigated BRAF and RAF1 alterations in Chinese prostate cancer. Using fluorescence in situ hybridization, we found that BRAF was truncated in five of 200 informative Chinese cases (2.5%) and that RAF1 was truncated in three of 204 informative cases (1.5%) and genomic rearrangements of these genes were significantly correlated with high Gleason scores (&gt;7; P &lt; 0.01) and have a trend to appear in high clinical stage disease. A high frequency of BRAF and RAF1 copy number gain was found (29 and 15%, respectively). BRAF copy number gain in Chinese cancers was significantly higher than in UK cases (9.2%)(P &lt; 0.001) and correlated with a number of clinical parameters. High-level expression of BRAF was found by immunohistochemistry in Chinese cancer samples compared with adjacent nonmalignant epithelial cells, which was correlated with high BRAF copy number. We also identified KRAS codon 12 mutations in three of 96 Chinese cases, no BRAF V600E mutations were observed. Our finding suggests that the activation of the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK pathway may be frequent in Chinese prostate cancer, with RAF gene copy number gain potentially being the main contributor.
Noonan syndrome (NS) is a relatively common autosomal dominant disorder characterized by congenital heart defects, short stature, and facial dysmorphia. NS is caused by germ line mutations in several components of the RAS-RAF-MEK-extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, including both kinase-activating and kinase-impaired alleles of RAF1 (∼3 to 5%), which encodes a serine-threonine kinase for MEK1/2. To investigate how kinase-impaired RAF1 mutants cause NS, we generated knock-in mice expressing Raf1(D486N). Raf1(D486N/+) (here D486N/+) female mice exhibited a mild growth defect. Male and female D486N/D486N mice developed concentric cardiac hypertrophy and incompletely penetrant, but severe, growth defects. Remarkably, Mek/Erk activation was enhanced in Raf1(D486N)-expressing cells compared with controls. RAF1(D486N), as well as other kinase-impaired RAF1 mutants, showed increased heterodimerization with BRAF, which was necessary and sufficient to promote increased MEK/ERK activation. Furthermore, kinase-activating RAF1 mutants also required heterodimerization to enhance MEK/ERK activation. Our results suggest that an increased heterodimerization ability is the common pathogenic mechanism for NS-associated RAF1 mutations.
Molecular characterization of congenital heart diseases now includes the not infrequent dysmorphic Noonan syndrome. A study of 6 genes of the RAS-MAPK pathway in Spanish patients is presented: the impact of heart disease, clinical expressivity, and diagnostic yield are investigated.
The study included 643 patients (and 182 family members) diagnosed by dysmorphologists, cardiologists, and pediatric endocrinologists from 74 tertiary hospitals. Bidirectional sequencing analysis of PTPN11, SOS1, RAF1, BRAF, KRAS and HRAS focused on exons carrying recurrent mutations accounting for 80% to 95% of previously described mutations.
Mutations were detected in 230 patients (91 women and 139 men) in 200 (31%) families (172 PTPN11+, 14 SOS1+, 9 RAF1+, 5 BRAF+). There was specific reference to the heart defect suffered in 156 index cases: 103 patients had shown pulmonary stenosis, 12 pulmonary stenosis with hyperthrophic cardiomyopathy, 18 hypertrophic cardiomiopathy, and 14 other cardiopathies; heart disease was absent in 9 index cases. Heart disease had not been documented in 23 of 30 family members with positive genotype and compatible clinical signs. Diagnostic yield was higher (P=.016) for samples from some centers (53%; 14/32) and even from certain professionals (64%; 9/14; P=.019). Characterization rate was 18% in patients for whom clinical data were not available. Genotyping led to a more precise diagnosis in 26 patients.
Most patients (94%) with a positive genotype had known congenital heart disease, 79% pulmonary stenosis and 12% hyperthrophic cardiomyopathy. Cardiopathy had not been documented in 76% of family members carrying the mutation. Molecular study is a useful tool in these syndromes but a more rigorous clinical diagnosis should be intended as well.
The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling cascades have been implicated in a number of human cancers. The tumor suppressor gene tuberous sclerosis-2 (Tsc-2) functions as a negative regulator of mTOR. Critical proteins in both pathways are activated following treatment of Eker rats (Tsc-2(EK/+)) with the nephrocarcinogen 2,3,5-tris-(glutathion-S-yl)hydroquinone (TGHQ), which also results in loss of the wild-type allele of Tsc-2 in renal preneoplastic lesions and tumors. Western blot analysis of kidney tumors formed following treatment of Tsc-2(EK/+) rats with TGHQ for 8 months revealed increases in B-Raf, Raf-1, pERK, cyclin D1, 4EBP1, and p-4EBP1-Ser65, -Thr70, and -Thr37/46 expression. Similar changes are observed following TGHQ-mediated transformation of primary renal epithelial cells derived from Tsc-2(EK/+) rats (quinol-thioether rat renal epithelial [QTRRE] cells) that are also null for tuberin. These cells exhibit high ERK, B-Raf, and Raf-1 kinase activity and increased expression of all p-4EBP1s and cyclin D1. Treatment of the QTRRE cells with the Raf kinase inhibitor, sorafenib, or the MEK1/2 kinase inhibitor, PD 98059, produced a significant decrease in the protein expression of all p-4EBP1s and cyclin D1. Following siRNA knockdown of Raf-1, Western blot analysis revealed a significant decrease in Raf-1, cyclin D1, and all p-4EBP1 forms noted above. In contrast, siRNA knockdown of B-Raf resulted in a nominal change in these proteins. The data indicate that Raf-1/MEK/ERK participates in crosstalk with 4EBP1, which represents a novel pathway interaction leading to increased protein synthesis, cell growth, and kidney tumor formation.
Genetic loss-of-function studies in murine tumor models have been essential in the analysis of downstream mediators of oncogenic transformation. Unfortunately, these studies are frequently limited by the availability of genetically modified mouse strains. Here we describe a versatile method allowing the efficient expression of an oncogene and simultaneous knockdown of targets of interest (TOI) from a single retroviral vector. Both oncogene and TOI-specific miR30-based shRNA are under the control of the strong viral long terminal repeat promoter, resulting in a single shared RNA transcript. Using this vector in a murine syngeneic BM transplantation model for BCR-ABL-induced chronic myeloid leukemia, we find that oncogene expression and target knockdown in primary hematopoietic cells with this vector is efficient both in vitro and in vivo, and demonstrate that Raf1, but not BRAF, modulates BCR-ABL-dependent ERK activation and transformation of hematopoietic cells. This expression system could facilitate genetic loss-of-function studies and allow the rapid validation of potential drug targets in a broad range of oncogene-driven murine tumor models.
Activation of the MAPK signaling pathway has been shown to be a unifying molecular feature in pilocytic astrocytoma (PA). Genetically, tandem duplications at chromosome 7q34 resulting in KIAA1549-BRAF fusion genes constitute the most common mechanism identified to date. To elucidate alternative mechanisms of aberrant MAPK activation in PA, we screened 125 primary tumors for RAF fusion genes and mutations in KRAS, NRAS, HRAS, PTPN11, BRAF and RAF1. Using microarray-based comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH), we identified in three cases an interstitial deletion of ~2.5 Mb as a novel recurrent mechanism forming BRAF gene fusions with FAM131B, a currently uncharacterized gene on chromosome 7q34. This deletion removes the BRAF N-terminal inhibitory domains, giving a constitutively active BRAF kinase. Functional characterization of the novel FAM131B-BRAF fusion demonstrated constitutive MEK phosphorylation potential and transforming activity in vitro. In addition, our study confirmed previously reported BRAF and RAF1 fusion variants in 72% (90/125) of PA. Mutations in BRAF (8/125), KRAS (2/125) and NF1 (4/125) and the rare RAF1 gene fusions (2/125) were mutually exclusive with BRAF rearrangements, with the exception of two cases in our series that concomitantly harbored more than one hit in the MAPK pathway. In summary, our findings further underline the fundamental role of RAF kinase fusion products as a tumor-specific marker and an ideally suited drug target for PA.
Noonan syndrome is a relatively common, clinically variable developmental disorder. Cardinal features include postnatally reduced growth, distinctive facial dysmorphism, congenital heart defects and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, variable cognitive deficit and skeletal, ectodermal and hematologic anomalies. Noonan syndrome is transmitted as an autosomal dominant trait, and is genetically heterogeneous. So far, heterozygous mutations in nine genes (PTPN11, SOS1, KRAS, NRAS, RAF1, BRAF, SHOC2, MEK1 and CBL) have been documented to underlie this disorder or clinically related phenotypes. Based on these recent discoveries, the diagnosis can now be confirmed molecularly in approximately 75% of affected individuals. Affected genes encode for proteins participating in the RAS-mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) signal transduction pathway, which is implicated in several developmental processes controlling morphology determination, organogenesis, synaptic plasticity and growth. Here, we provide an overview of clinical aspects of this disorder and closely related conditions, the molecular mechanisms underlying pathogenesis, and major genotype-phenotype correlations.
β-Lapachone [β-lap; 3,4-dihydro-2,2-dimethyl-2H-naphthol[1,2-b]pyran-5,6-dione] is a novel anticancer drug currently under investigation in phase I/II clinical trials. However, the mechanism underlying its clinical efficacy remains unclear. In this study, we found that β-lap provoked the cleavage of heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) in
quinone oxidoreductase-1 (NQO1)-expressing lung and prostate cancer cells as well as in primary human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). These actions of β-lap were different from that of the conventional Hsp90 inhibitor 17-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin. As a consequence of Hsp90 cleavage, Hsp90-associated oncoproteins, such as receptor-interacting protein, Raf-1, AKT, and CDK4, were degraded in treated cancer cells, and key receptor tyrosine kinases such as vascular endothelial cell growth factor receptor-2 and Her-2 were degraded in treated HUVECs through a proteasomal system. Further results revealed that specific inhibitors of NQO1 and reactive oxygen species could dramatically reduce β-lap-mediated Hsp90 cleavage. In addition to its cytotoxicity, β-lap effectively inhibited angiogenesis by suppressing tube formation and the invasion of HUVECs in vitro, rat aortic microvascular sprouts ex vivo, and mouse corneal neovascularization in vivo. Furthermore, β-lap markedly suppressed the growth and angiogenesis of human lung cancer xenografts in nude mice and decreased the levels of receptor-interacting protein, AKT, CDK4, and CD31 in the solid tumors. Unlike other NQO1-dependent cytotoxic quinones, such as streptonigrin, menadione, mitomycin, and 17-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin, β-lap was the only agent that could cause Hsp90 cleavage. Taken together, our results suggest a crucial mechanism underlying the antitumor efficacy of β-lap.
Lapatinib, a dual epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and HER2 tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), has been approved for HER2-positive breast cancer patients. Nevertheless, its inhibitory effect on EGFR did not deliver clinical benefits for triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) patients even EGFR overexpression was frequently found in this disease. Moreover, lapatinib was unexpectedly found to enhance metastasis of TNBC cells, but the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. In this study, we explored that the level of interleukin-6 (IL-6) was elevated in lapatinib-treated TNBC cells. Treatment with IL-6 antibody abolished the lapatinib-induced migration. Mechanistically, the signaling axis of Raf-1/mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNKs), p38 MAPK, and activator protein 1 (AP-1) was activated in response to lapatinib treatment to induce IL-6 expression. Furthermore, our data showed that microRNA-7 directly binds and inhibits Raf-1 3'UTR activity, and that down-regulation of miR-7 by lapatinib contributes to the activation of Raf-1 signaling pathway and the induction of IL-6 expression. Our results not only revealed IL-6 as a key regulator of lapatinib-induced metastasis, but also explored the requirement of miR7/Raf-1/MAPK/AP-1 axis in lapatinib-induced IL-6 expression.
Thyroid cancer (TC) is frequently associated with BRAF or RAS oncogenic mutations and RET/PTC rearrangements, with aberrant RAF-MEK-ERK and/or PI3K pathway activation. BRAF underlies ERK activation in most TC cells, but not in TPC-1 cells with RET/PTC1 rearrangement. Here, we show that depletion of RAF-1, a RAF family member with a poorly defined role in TC, decreases proliferation and increases apoptosis in TPC-1 cells and, less significantly, in cells harboring a BRAF(V600E) or HRAS(G13R) mutations, but without affecting ERK activation. We further demonstrate that constitutive activation of ERKs in TPC-1 cells is not caused by mutations in 50 oncogenes and tumor suppressors prone to activate the ERK pathway, or affected by inhibition of BRAF, MEK1/2 or PI3K. Our data indicate that RAF-1 is important for the survival of TPC-1 cells independently of the classical MEK1/2-ERK activation, offering new perspectives on RET/PTC signaling and for the therapy of thyroid cancers.
The present study shows a new connection of protein tyrosine phosphatase interacting protein 51 (PTPIP51) to the nuclear factor κB (NFκB) signalling pathway. PTPIP51 mRNA and protein expression is regulated by RelA. If bound to the PTPIP51 promoter, RelA repress the mRNA and protein expression of PTPIP51. The parallel treatment with pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC) reversed the suppression of PTPIP51 protein expression induced by TNFα. Using the intensity correlation analysis PTPIP51 verified a co-localization with RelA, which is also regulated by TNFα administration. Moreover, the direct interaction of PTPIP51 and RelA was established using the DuoLink proximity ligation assay. IκBα, the known inhibitor of RelA, also interacted with PTPIP51. This hints to the fact that in un-stimulated conditions PTPIP51 forms a complex with RelA and IκBα. The PTPIP51/RelA/IκBα complex is modulated by TNFα. Interestingly, the impact on the mitogen activated protein kinase pathway was negligible except in highest TNFα concentration. Here, PTPIP51 and Raf-1 interactions were slightly repressed. The newly established relationship of PTPIP51 and the NFκB signaling pathway provides the basis for a possible therapeutic impact.
Early life is characterized by a high susceptibility to infection and a TH2-biased CD4 T-cell response to vaccines. Toll-like receptor (TLR) agonists are currently being implemented as new vaccine adjuvants for TH1 activation, but their translation to the field of pediatric vaccines is facing the impairment of neonatal innate TLR responses.
We sought to analyze C-type lectin receptor pathways as an alternative or a coactivator to TLRs for neonatal dendritic cell activation for TH1 polarization.
Neonatal monocyte-derived dendritic cells (moDCs) were exposed to various combinations of TLR agonists with or without Dectin-1 agonist. IL-12 and IL-23 responses were analyzed at the transcriptional and protein levels after stimulation. The intracellular pathways triggered by combined TLR plus Dectin-1 stimulation was determined by using pharmacologic inhibitors. The capacity of neonatal moDCs to differentiate naive CD4 TH cells was evaluated in cocultures with heterologous neonatal naive T cells. Curdlan was finally tested as an adjuvant within a subunit tuberculosis vaccine in neonatal mice.
Simultaneous coactivation through Dectin-1 and TLRs induced robust secretion of IL-12p70 by neonatal moDCs by unlocking transcriptional control on the p35 subunit of IL-12. Both the spleen tyrosine kinase and Raf-1 pathways were involved in this process, allowing differentiation of neonatal naive T cells toward IFN-γ-producing TH1 cells. In vivo a Dectin-1 agonist as adjuvant was sufficient to induce TH1 responses after vaccination of neonatal mice.
Coactivation of neonatal moDCs through Dectin-1 allows TLR-mediated IL-12p70 secretion and TH1 polarization of neonatal T cells. Dectin-1 agonists represent a promising TH1 adjuvant for pediatric vaccination.
Autocrine platelet derived growth factor-BB (PDGF-BB) and cerebrospinal fluid, which also contains PDGF, stimulate proliferation of leptomeningeal and meningioma cells, in part, by activation of the Raf-1-MEK-1-MAPK pathway. The negative regulators of this activation are not known. However, PDGF receptors and p44/42 MAPK are regulated, in part, by mitogen activated kinase phosphatase 3 (MKP-3) and Src homology carboxyl terminus protein (SHP-2). Six fetal and one adult human leptomeninges specimens and 22 meningiomas were evaluated for MKP-3, SHP-2, and phospho-SHP-2 as well as activation/phosphorylation of MEK1/2, p44/42 MAPK, Akt and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) by western blot and MKP3 expression by polymerase chain reaction. PDGF-BB and cerebrospinal fluid effects on these phosphatases and signaling were also studied in vitro. MKP-3 and phospho-p44/42 MAPK were detected in all or six of seven leptomeninges, respectively. MKP-3 was detected in six of eight World Health Organization grade I and II meningiomas. Three of four grade I and five of five grade II with no or low MKP-3 had high levels of phospho-p44/42MAPK. MKP3 was not detected in four of six grade III meningiomas. These had high levels of phospho-p44/42MAPK. SHP2 was found in all leptomeninges and meningiomas while phospho-SHP-2 was found in 11 to 33% of grade I-III meningiomas. Reduced MKP-3 may facilitate PDGF-BB autocrine and paracrine mitogenic effects in a subpopulation of higher grade meningiomas by increasing phospho-p44/42 MAPK.
Mitosis and epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor (EGFR) are both targets for cancer therapy. The role of EGFR signaling in mitosis has been rarely studied and poorly understood. The limited studies indicate that the activation of EGFR and downstream signaling pathways is mostly inhibited during mitosis. However, we recently showed that EGFR is phosphorylated in response to EGF stimulation in mitosis. Here we studied EGF-induced EGFR activation and the activation of major signaling pathways downstream of EGFR during mitosis. We showed that EGFR was strongly activated by EGF during mitosis as all the five major tyrosine residues including Y992, Y1045, Y1068, Y1086, and Y1173 were phosphorylated to a level similar to that in the interphase. We further showed that the activated EGFR is able to selectively activate some downstream signaling pathways while avoiding others. Activated EGFR is able to activate PI3K and AKT2, but not AKT1, which may be responsible for the observed effects of EGF against nocodazole-induced cell death. Activated EGFR is also able to activate c-Src, c-Cbl and PLC-γ1 during mitosis. However, activated EGFR is unable to activate ERK1/2 and their downstream substrates RSK and Elk-1. While it activated Ras, EGFR failed to fully activate Raf-1 in mitosis due to the lack of phosphorylation at Y341 and the lack of dephosphorylation at pS259. We conclude that contrary to the dogma, EGFR is activated by EGF during mitosis. Moreover, EGFR-mediated cell signaling is regulated differently from the interphase to specifically serve the needs of the cell in mitosis.
We characterized the mechanism(s) underlying the abrogating effect of withaferin A (WFA) on the stem cell factor (SCF)-stimulated pigmentation of human epidermal equivalents (HEEs). Increased gene and protein expression levels of tyrosinase, tyrosinase-related protein1, dopachrome tautomerase, PMEL17, c-KIT and their targeted transcription factor, microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF) were significantly reversed at days 7 and 10, respectively, by treatment with WFA. In WFA-treated normal human melanocytes (NHMs), there was a marked deficiency in the SCF-stimulated series of phosphorylations of c-KIT, Shc, Raf-1, MEK, ERK, MITF and CREB. Treatment with dithiothreitol (DTT) distinctly abolished the suppressive effect of WFA on the SCF-stimulated phosphorylation of c-KIT in NHMs. On the other hand, even after incubation at 4 °C for 2 h with 5 nM SCF, followed by the removal of unbound SCF by washing and then raising the temperature to 37 °C to start the signaling reaction, c-KIT was distinctly phosphorylated to a similar extent by incubation for 15 min with SCF only or with SCF + WFA. These findings indicate that WFA attenuates the SCF-induced activation of c-KIT in NHMs by interrupting the auto-phosphorylation of c-KIT through DTT-suppressible Michael addition thioalkylation reactions without interrupting the binding of SCF to the c-KIT receptor.
We examined glucose and fructose effects on serine phosphorylation levels of a range of proteins in rat liver and muscle cells. For this, healthy adult rats were subjected to either oral glucose or fructose loads. A mini-array system was utilized to determine serine phosphorylation levels of liver and skeletal muscle proteins. A glucose oral load of 125 mg/100 g body weight (G 1/2) did not induce changes in phosphorylated serines of the proteins studied. Loading with 250 mg/100 g body weight of fructose (Fr), which induced similar glycemia levels as G 1/2, significantly increased serine phosphorylation of liver cyclin D3, PI3 kinase/p85, ERK-2, PTP2 and clusterin. The G 1/2 increased serine levels of the skeletal muscle proteins cyclin H, Cdk2, IRAK, total PKC, PTP1B, c-Raf 1, Ras and the β-subunit of the insulin receptor. The Fr induced a significant increase only in muscle serine phosphorylation of PI3 kinase/p85. The incubation of isolated rat hepatocytes with 10 mM glucose for 5 min significantly increased serine phosphorylation of 31 proteins. In contrast, incubation with 10 mM fructose produced less intense effects. Incubation with 10 mM glucose plus 75 µM fructose counteracted the effects of the incubation with glucose alone, except those on Raf-1 and Ras. Less marked effects were detected in cultured muscle cells incubated with 10 mM glucose or 10 mM glucose plus 75 µM fructose. Our results suggest that glucose and fructose act as specific functional modulators through a general mechanism that involves liver-generated signals, like micromolar fructosemia, which would inform peripheral tissues of the presence of either glucose- or fructose-derived metabolites.
Second-phase insulin secretion sustains insulin release in the face of hyperglycemia associated with insulin resistance, requiring the continued mobilization of insulin secretory granules to the plasma membrane. Cdc42, the small Rho family GTPase recognized as the proximal glucose-specific trigger to elicit second-phase insulin secretion, signals downstream to activate the p21-activated kinase (PAK1), which then signals to Raf-1/MEK/ERK to induce filamentous actin (F-actin) remodeling, to ultimately mobilize insulin granules to the plasma membrane. However, the steps required to initiate Cdc42 activation in a glucose-specific manner in β cells have remained elusive. Toward this, we identified the involvement of the Src family kinases (SFKs), based upon the ability of SFK inhibitors to block glucose-stimulated Cdc42 and PAK1 activation events as well as the amplifying pathway of glucose-stimulated insulin release, in MIN6 β cells. Indeed, subsequent studies performed in human islets revealed that SFK phosphorylation was induced only by glucose and within 1 min of stimulation before the activation of Cdc42 at 3 min. Furthermore, pervanadate treatment validated the phosphorylation event to be tyrosine-specific. Although RT-PCR showed β cells to express five different SFK proteins, only two of these, YES and Fyn kinases, were found localized to the plasma membrane, and of these two, only YES kinase underwent glucose-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation. Immunodetection and RNAi analyses further established YES kinase as a proximal glucose-specific signal in the Cdc42-signaling cascade. Identification of YES kinase provides new insight into the mechanisms underlying the sustainment of insulin secretion via granule mobilization/replenishment and F-actin remodeling.
Primary Sjögren's syndrome (pSS) is a chronic autoimmune exocrine disease associated with variable lymphocytic infiltration of the affected organs (primarily salivary and lachrymal glands). To investigate the potential implication of nerve growth factor-β (NGF-β) and its high affinity receptor tyrosine kinase receptor A (TrkA) in the regulation of pSS inflammatory responses, we studied their expression in the human salivary gland epithelial cells (SGEC) cultures from pSS minor salivary glands (MSG) biopsies and their relationship with histopathological disease parameters. Here, we demonstrated an increased expression of the NGF-β/TrkA system in pSS SGEC, correlated with the MSG inflammation grade. The results demonstrate that the pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-α and IL-6 enhance NGF-β production; on the contrary, NGF-β production was reduced in the presence of both Raf-1 kinase and MEK inhibitors. Furthermore, TNF-α/IL-6 treatment increased ERK1/2 phosphorylation. Inhibition of the EGF/EGFR system also decreased NGF-β release by pSS SGEC, indicating that the chronic inflammatory condition characteristic of pSS enhances NGF-β production via EGFR/Raf-1/MEK/ERK pathway activation.
NGF-β and TrkA expression is elevated in salivary gland epithelial cells of primary Sjögren's syndrome (pSS). Overexpression of NGF-β/TrkA system in pSS occurs via EGFR/Raf-1/MEK/ERK pathway. In pSS, NGF-β overexpression was prevented by EGFR/Raf-1/MEK/ERK pathway inhibition.
Protein tyrosine phosphatse interacting protein (PTPIP51) is involved in the modulation of the mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway. Up to now, less is known about the regulation of this modulation. A recent study hinted to the phosphorylation status of PTPIP51 being essential for correct regulation of PTPIP51 function. In this study we investigate the phosphorylation status of PTPIP51 under the inhibition of the main interacting kinases and phosphatases of PTPIP51. c-Src was inhibited by Dasatinib, EGF receptor by Gefitinib, protein kinase C by staurosporine, protein kinase A by RpcAMPs and PTP1B by its specific inhibitor. Furthermore, a combination of PP2 with Gefitinib and RpcAMPs was used, respectively. The data were acquired for non-EGF and EGF treated HaCaT cells. All cells were analyzed relative to the subcellular distribution and change in the amount of tyrosine 176 phosphorylated PTPIP51. Furthermore, the protein interactions were assayed by duolink proximity ligation assay. HaCaT cells submitted to the respective inhibitor displayed a subcellular redistribution of tyrosine 176 phosphorylated PTPIP51 depending on the applied inhibitor. Yet, the amount of tyrosine 176 phosphorylated PTPIP51 remained unchanged by inhibitor treatment except for Gefitinib and simultaneous PP2 and Gefitnib treatment in non EGF-stimulated cells, but was elevated if cells were also EGF stimulated, in control and inhibitor treated cells. Interestingly, the interaction with EGFR, 14-3-3, Raf-1, c-Src, PTP1B, PKA and PKC was influenced by the application of inhibitors. Also EGF application resulted in a sharp drop of the PTPIP51 interaction with the MAPK pathway (e.g. Raf-1) in the control group. Summarizing these new findings, we postulate that PTPIP51 is regulated by its phosphorylation status combined with a thereby induced subcellular redistribution. In addition, the EGF receptor regulates PTPIP51 interaction with Raf-1 by its phosphorylation, thus preventing an overshooting activation of the MAPK pathway.

Yet, the amount of tyrosine 176 phosphorylated PTPIP51 remained unchanged by inhibitor treatment except for Gefitinib and simultaneous PP2 and Gefitnib treatment in non EGF-stimulated cells, but was elevated if cells were also EGF stimulated, in control and inhibitor treated cells. Interestingly, the interaction with EGFR, 14-3-3, Raf-1, c-Src, PTP1B, PKA and PKC was influenced by the application of inhibitors. Also EGF application resulted in a sharp drop of the PTPIP51 interaction with the MAPK pathway (e.g. Raf-1) in the control group.Summarizing these new findings, we postulate that PTPIP51 is regulated by its phosphorylation status combined with a thereby induced subcellular redistribution. In addition, the EGF receptor regulates PTPIP51 interaction with Raf-1 by its phosphorylation, thus preventing an overshooting activation of the MAPK pathway.
Sorafenib (Nexavar) is a multi-kinase inhibitor that was developed as an inhibitor of RAF-1, in the ERK1/2 pathway, but which was subsequently shown to inhibit class III tyrosine kinase receptors. (1) More recently regorafenib (Stivarga) has been developed, which is a further fluorinated version of sorafenib with greater bioavailability and similar inhibitory properties against RAF-1/class III RTKs. (2) Some of the anti-tumor effects of sorafenib have been ascribed to anti-angiogenic actions of this agent on endothelial associated kinases such as VEGFR2. Other effects of sorafenib clearly have to be due to its effects on the inherent biology of the tumor cells themselves. For example, through various mechanisms sorafenib has been shown in the laboratory and the clinic to suppress expression of the protective protein MCL-1. (3) Sorafenib has also been linked to inhibition of STAT3, NFκB, and activation of the death receptor CD95. (4) Sorafenib is routinely dosed daily (400 mg BID) and 7 d after the start of dosing has a Cmax of ~21 μM with a nadir at 12 h of ~10 μM, and is a highly protein bound based on in vitro assays. (5) Despite this in vitro binding data sorafenib has profound in vivo effects on tumor cells in renal carcinoma and hepatocellular carcinoma patients; cells which are not per se addicted to high activity oncogene signals that are targets of sorafenib/regorafenib. Thus the precise stable bioavailable level of sorafenib/regorafenib in patient plasma is not known.
PAH associated with connective tissue diseases is associated with significant functional impairment and morbidity, and carries with it a poor prognosis. The mortality is as high as 10% to 15% in the first year after diagnosis; making it a devastating disease. The availability of ever-increasing numbers of treatment options in the recent era have improved survival in this patient population and have made early and accurate diagnosis a more important goal. According to the Registry to Evaluate Early and Long-Term Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension Disease Management (REVEAL), 1-year, 3-year, 5-year, and 7-year survival rates from time of diagnostic right-sided heart catheterization in patients with PAH were found to be 85%, 68%, 57%, and 49%, respectively, which is a considerable improvement since the National Institutes of Health registry 2 decades previously. In a study by Condliffe and colleagues, survival rates in patients with SSC-associated PAH have improved to 78%at 1 year and 47% at 3 years. Patients with SLE-related PAH have a much higher survival rate of up to 75% at 3 years. Proper screening, early diagnosis, and early treatment can have a significant impact in reducing morbidity and mortality. A small study to assess outcomes in patients with asymptomatic CTD found to have exercise induced PAH suggest that bosentan may be safe and effective in improving the hemodynamics and outcomes in these patients. This study included only 10 patients, and additional randomized trials with larger numbers of subjects are needed to affirm this hypothesis. Studies are under way to find additional therapeutic modalities in the form of PDGF receptor blockers, VEGF blockers, tyrosine kinase inhibitors, endothelial dysfunction inhibitors, multikinase inhibitor of Raf-1, serotonin receptor antagonists,and rho kinase inhibitors. Despite these, clinical suspicion, early diagnosis, early
The µ-opioid receptor (OPRM1) signals as a classic G protein-coupled receptor by activating heterotrimeric Gi/Go proteins resulting in adenylyl cyclase (AC) inhibition. Such AC inhibition is desensitized after prolonged agonist treatment. However, after receptor desensitization, the intracellular cAMP level remains regulated by OPRM1, as demonstrated by the intracellular cAMP level increase or AC superactivation upon removal of an agonist or addition of an antagonist. We now demonstrate that such intracellular cAMP regulation is mediated by a novel noncanonical signaling pathway resulting from OPRM1 being converted to a receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK)-like entity. This noncanonical OPRM1 signaling is initiated by the receptor recruiting and activating Src kinase within the receptor complex, leading to phosphorylation of the OPRM1 Tyr(336) residue. Phospho-Tyr(336) serves as the docking site for growth factor receptor-bound protein/son of sevenless, leading to the recruitment and activation of the Ras/Raf-1 and subsequent phosphorylation and activation of AC5/6 by Raf-1. Such sequence of events was established by the absence of Ras/Raf1 recruitment and activation by the OPRM1-Y336F mutant, by the presence of Src kinase inhibitor 4-amino-5-(4-chlorophenyl)-7-(t-butyl)pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine (PP2) or the absence of Src activity, by the presence of specific Raf-1 inhibitor GW5074 (5-iodo-3-[(3,5-dibromo-4-hydroxyphenyl) methylene]-2-indolinone) or the absence of Raf-1, or by the dominant negative RasN17 mutant. Src together with Ras activates Raf1 which was established by the inability of the Raf1-Tyr(340/341) mutant to activate AC. Hence, the phosphorylation of OPRM1 at Tyr(336) by Src serves as the trigger for the conversion of a classic Gi/Go-coupled receptor into an RTK-like entity, resulting in a noncanonical pathway even after the original Gi/Go signals are blunted.
Authors submitted an analysis of papers given up an involvement of protein kinases in heart ischemic postconditioning. This analysis of literature source allowed to authors affirms that signaling system of postconditioning can involve kinases: PKC, PI3K, Akt, MEKl/2, ERK1/2, MTOR, p70s6K, GSK3b, PKG and also eNOS, NO, GC, motoKATP channel, ROS, MPT pore. At the same time it is unclear a real contributions of kinases mTOR, p70s6, AMPK and GSK3b in the mechanism of infarct limiting impact of postconditioning. It is required a further study of the chain of signaling events following JAK2 and p38 kinase activation. The knowledge of Ras and Raf-1 role in postconditioning has hypothetical character. The tyrosine kinase significance in postcondi-tioning is unclear, particular Src kinase, which plays an important role in the regulation of cardiac tolerance to an impact of ischemia and reperfusion.
Although multitargeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor sunitinib has been used as first-line therapeutic agent against metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC), the molecular mechanism and functional role per se for its therapeutic performance remains obscure. Our present study revealed that sunitinib-treated RCC cells exhibit senescence characteristics including increased SA-β-gal activity, DcR2 and Dec1 expression, and senescence-associated secretary phenotype (SASP) such as proinflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-1α, IL-6 and IL-8 secretion. Moreover, sunitinib administration also led to cell growth inhibition, G1-S cell cycle arrest and DNA damage response in RCC cells, suggesting therapeutic significance of sunitinib-induced RCC cellular senescence. Mechanistic investigations indicated that therapy-induced senescence (TIS) following sunitinib treatment mainly attributed to p53/Dec1 signaling activation mediated by Raf-1/NF-κB inhibition in vitro. Importantly, in vivo study showed tumor growth inhibition and prolonged overall survival were associated with increased p53 and Dec1 expression, decreased Raf-1 and Ki67 staining, and upregulated SA-β-gal activity after sunitinib treatment. Immunohistochemistry analysis of tumor tissues from RCC patients receiving sunitinib neoadjuvant therapy confirmed the similar treating phenotype. Taken together, our findings suggested that sunitinib treatment performance could be attributable to TIS, depending on p53/Dec1 activation via inhibited Raf-1/nuclear factor (NF)-κB activity. These data indicated potential insights into therapeutic improvement with reinforcing TIS-related performance or overcoming SASP-induced resistance.
Members of the RAF family (ARAF, BRAF, and CRAF/RAF-1) are involved in a variety of cellular activities, including growth, survival, differentiation, and transformation. An oncogene encodes BRAF, the function of which is linked to MEK activation. BRAF is the most effective RAF kinase in terms of induction of MEK/ERK activity. However, the mechanisms involved in BRAF regulation remain unclear. In the present work, we used a tandem affinity purification approach to show that RNF149 (RING finger protein 149) interacts with wild-type BRAF. The latter protein is a RING domain-containing E3 ubiquitin ligase involved in control of gene transcription, translation, cytoskeletal organization, cell adhesion, and epithelial development. We showed that RNF149 bound directly to the C-terminal kinase-containing domain of wild-type BRAF and induced ubiquitination, followed by proteasome-dependent degradation, of the latter protein. Functionally, RNF149 attenuated the increase in cell growth induced by wild-type BRAF. However, RNF149 did not bind to mutant BRAF or induce ubiquitination thereof. Thus, we show that RNF149 is an E3 ubiquitin ligase active on wild-type BRAF.
Raf Kinase Inhibitory Protein or RKIP was initially identified as a Raf-1 binding protein using the yeast 2-hybrid screen. RKIP inhibits the activation phosphorylation of MEK by Raf-1 by competitively inhibiting the binding of MEK to Raf-1 and thus exerting an inhibitory effect on the Raf-MEK-Erk pathway. RKIP has been identified as a metastasis suppressor gene. Expression of RKIP is low in cancer metastases. Although primary tumor growth remains unaffected, re- expression of RKIP inhibits cancer metastasis. Mechanistically, RKIP constrains metastasis by inhibiting angiogenesis, local invasion, intravasation, and colonization. The molecular mechanism of how RKIP inhibits these individual steps remains undefined. In our present study, using an unbiased PCR based screening and by analyzing DNA microarray expression datasets we observe that the expression of multiple metalloproteases (MMPs) including MMP1, MMP3, MMP10 and MMP13 are negatively correlated with RKIP expression in breast cancer cell lines and clinical samples. Since expression of MMPs by cancer cells is important for cancer metastasis, we hypothesize that RKIP may mediate suppression of breast cancer metastasis by inhibiting multiple MMPs. We show that the expression signature of RKIP and MMPs is better at predicting high metastatic risk than the individual gene. Using a combination of loss- and gain-of-function approaches, we find that MMP13 is the cause of RKIP-mediated inhibition of local cancer invasion. Interestingly expression of MMP13 alone is not sufficient to reverse the inhibition of breast cancer cell metastasis to the lung due to the expression of RKIP. We find that RKIP negatively regulates MMP13 through the Erk2 signaling pathway and the repression of MMP13 by RKIP is transcription factor AP-1 independent. Together, our findings indicate that RKIP inhibits cancer cell invasion, in part, via MMP13 inhibition. These data also implicate RKIP in the regulation of MMP transcription, suggesting a potential mechanism by which RKIP inhibits tumor progression and metastasis.
In the present study, a new compound named 17-(6-cinnamamido-hexylamino-)-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (CDG) was obtained by introducing the cinnamic acid (CA) group into the 17-site of geldanamycin (GDM). The anti-cancer effects of CDG in vitro and in vivo were evaluated. MTT assay was used to examine the inhibitory effect of CDG on the proliferation of MCF-7, HepG2, H460 and SW1990 cells. Immunofluorescent staining flow cytometry combined with Annexin V-FITC/PI staining were used to detect apoptotic cells. Transwell assay was used to analyze the effect of CDG on cell invasion and migration ability. Western blotting was used to detect the expression levels of RAF-1, EGFR, AKT, CDK4 and HER-2 of MCF-7, HepG2 and H460 cells. The toxicities of CDG and GDM were evaluated in mice. Using the subcutaneously transplanted MCF-7 xenograft in nude mice, inhibitory effect was evaluated in vivo. The results showed that CDG inhibited the proliferation of cancer cells (IC50: 13.6-67.4 microg.mL-1). After exposure to CDG for 48 h, most cells presented typical morphologic changes of apoptosis such as chromatin condensation or shrunken nucleus. The rates of apoptosis of MCF-7, HepG2, H460 and SW1990 cells incubated with 10 microg.mL-1 CDG were 23.16%, 27.55%, 22.21%, 20.47%, respectively. A dose-dependent reduction of migration of four cell lines was found after exposure to CDG. The decreased levels of RAF-1, EGFR, AKT, CDK4 and HER-2 showed that CDG possessed HSP90 inhibitory effect. The result of animal toxicity test on the mice suggested that CDG had lower toxicity than GDM. Meanwhile, CDG inhibited the growth of MCF-7 xenografts of athymic mice.
Astrocytes undergo de-differentiation and become activated during a response to injury. Several studies have found that reactive astrocytes re-express markers, such as Nestin, which are normally expressed in neural stem cells. It was recently shown that the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is up-regulated in astrocytes after injury and promotes reactive astrocyte transformation. However, the signaling pathways involved in this process have not been elucidated. In the present study, we showed that Nestin was strongly expressed in reactive astrocytes. Furthermore, as shown by immunoblot analyses, epidermal growth factor (EGF) regulated Nestin expression through EGFR activation. Inhibition of the PLCγ, PI3K, ERK, p38, and JNK pathways did not affect Nestin expression in reactive astrocytes. However, treatment with a Raf-1 inhibitor inhibited Nestin expression in a concentration-dependent manner. Taken together, the signaling analyses revealed that EGF induced and regulated Nestin expression through activation of the Ras-Raf--ERK signaling pathway. This is the first study to show that Nestin expression is regulated by an extracellular signaling molecule in reactive astrocytes.
Upregulated ERK1/2 activity is often correlated with AKT activation during prostate cancer (PCa) progression, yet their functional relation needs elucidation. Using androgen-deprived LNCaP cells, in which ERK1/2 activation occurs in strong correlation with AKT activation, we found that AKT-mediated B-Raf regulation is necessary for ERK1/2 activation. Specifically, in response to androgen deprivation, AKT upregulated B-Raf phosphorylation at Ser445 without affecting A-Raf or C-Raf-1. This effect of AKT was abolished by Arg25 to Ala mutation or truncating (∆4-129) the pleckstrin homology domain of AKT, indicating that the canonical AKT regulation is important for this signaling. Intriguingly, although a constitutively active AKT containing N-terminal myristoylation signal could sufficiently upregulate B-Raf phosphorylation at Ser445 in LNCaP cells, subsequent MEK/ERK activation still required hormone deprivation. In contrast, AKT activity was sufficient to induce not only B-Raf phosphorylation but also MEK/ERK activation in the hormone refractory LNCaP variant, C4-2. These data indicate that androgen depletion may induce MEK/ERK activation through a synergy between AKT-dependent and -independent mechanisms and that the latter may become deregulated in association with castration resistance. In support, consistent AKT-mediated B-Raf regulation was also detected in a panel of PCa lines derived from the cPten(-/-)L mice before and after castration. Our results also demonstrate that AKT regulates androgen receptor levels partly via the Raf/MEK/ERK pathway. This study reveals a novel crosstalk between ERK1/2 and AKT in PCa cells.
MAP kinase (MAPK) signaling results from activation of Raf kinases in response to external or internal stimuli. Here, we demonstrate that Raf kinase inhibitory protein (RKIP) regulates the activation of MAPK when B-Raf signaling is defective. We used multiple models including mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) and primary keratinocytes from RKIP- or Raf-deficient mice as well as allografts in mice to investigate the mechanism. Loss of B-Raf protein or activity significantly reduces MAPK activation in these cells. We show that RKIP depletion can rescue the compromised ERK activation and promote proliferation, and this rescue occurs through a Raf-1 dependent mechanism. These results provide formal evidence that RKIP is a bona fide regulator of Raf-1. We propose a new model in which RKIP plays a key role in regulating the ability of cells to signal through Raf-1 to ERK in B-Raf compromised cells.
Activation of tumor necrosis factor receptor-1 can trigger survival or apoptosis pathways. In many cellular models, including the neuronal cell model PC12, it has been demonstrated that inhibition of protein synthesis is sufficient to render cells sensitive to apoptosis induced by TNFα. The survival effect is linked to the translocation of the transcription factor nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) to the nucleus and activation of survival-related genes such as FLICE-like inhibitory protein long form (FLIP-L) or IAPs. Nonetheless, we previously reported an NF-κB-independent contribution of Bcl-xL to cell survival after TNFα treatment. Here, we demonstrate that NF-κB-induced increase in FLIP-L expression levels is essential for mitogen-activated protein kinases/extracellular signal-regulated kinases (MAPK/ERK) activation. We demonstrate that FLIP-L behaves as a Raf-1 activator through both protein-protein interaction and Raf-1 kinase activation, without the requirement of the classical Ras activation. Importantly, prevention of FLIP-L increase by NF-κB inhibition or knockdown of endogenous FLIP-L blocks MAPK/ERK activation after TNFα treatment. From a functional point of view, we show that inhibition of the MAPK/ERK pathway and the NF-κB pathway are equally relevant to render PC12 cells sensitive to cell death induced by TNFα. Apoptosis induced by TNFα under these conditions is dependent on jun nuclear kinase1/2 JNK1/2-dependent Bim upregulation. Therefore, we report a previously undescribed and essential role for MAPK/ERK activation by FLIP-L in the decision between cell survival and apoptosis upon TNFα stimulation.
In addition to its functions in thrombosis and hemostasis, thrombin also plays an important role in lung inflammation. Our previous report showed that thrombin activates the protein kinase C (PKC)α/c-Src and Gβγ/Rac1/PI3K/Akt signaling pathways to induce IκB kinase α/β (IKKα/β) activation, NF-κB transactivation, and IL-8/CXCL8 expressions in human lung epithelial cells (ECs). In this study, we further investigated the mechanism of c-Src-dependent Shc, Raf-1, and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling pathways involved in thrombin-induced NF-κB activation and IL-8/CXCL8 release. Thrombin-induced increases in IL-8/CXCL8 release and κB-luciferase activity were inhibited by the Shc small interfering RNA (siRNA), p66Shc siRNA, GW 5074 (a Raf-1 inhibitor), and PD98059 (a mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) kinase (MEK) inhibitor). Treatment of A549 cells with thrombin increased p66Shc and p46/p52Shc phosphorylation at Tyr239/240 and Tyr317, which was inhibited by cell transfection with the dominant negative mutant of c-Src (c-Src DN). Thrombin caused time-dependent phosphorylation of Raf-1 and ERK, which was attenuated by the c-Src DN. Thrombin-induced IKKα/β phosphorylation was inhibited by GW 5074 and PD98059. Treatment of cells with thrombin induced Gβγ, c-Src, and p66Shc complex formation in a time-dependent manner. Taken together, these results show for the first time that thrombin activates Shc, Raf-1, and ERK through Gβγ, c-Src, and Shc complex formation to induce IKKα/β phosphorylation, NF-κB activation, and IL-8/CXCL8 release in human lung ECs.
Before entering mitosis, the stacks of the Golgi cisternae are separated from each other, and inhibiting this process delays entry of mammalian cells into mitosis. Protein kinase D (PKD) is known to be involved in Golgi-to-cell surface transport by controlling the biogenesis of specific transport carriers. Here we show that depletion of PKD1 and PKD2 proteins from HeLa cells by small interfering RNA leads to the accumulation of cells in the G2 phase of the cell cycle and prevents cells from entering mitosis. We further provide evidence that inhibition of PKD blocks mitotic Raf-1 and mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK) activation, and, as a consequence, mitotic Golgi fragmentation, which could be rescued by expression of active MEK1. Finally, Golgi fluorescence recovery after photobleaching analyses demonstrate that PKD is crucial for the cleavage of the noncompact zones of Golgi membranes in G2 phase. Our findings suggest that PKD controls interstack Golgi connections in a Raf-1/MEK1-dependent manner, a process required for entry of the cells into mitosis.
Cigarette smoke exposure is strongly associated with airway hyperreactivity (AHR) which is the main characteristic seen in asthma. The intracellular MAPK signaling pathways are suggested to be associated with the airway damage to the AHR. In the present study, we hypothesize that secondhand cigarette smoke (SHS) exposure upregulates the bronchial contractile receptors via activation of the Raf/ERK/MAPK pathway.
Rats were exposed to SHS for 3 h daily for up to 8 weeks. The receptor agonists-induced bronchial contractile reactivity was analyzed with a sensitive myograph system. The mRNA transcription and protein translation of the target receptors and the kinases in Raf/ERK/MAPK pathway were investigated by real-time PCR, Western blotting and immunofluorescence, respectively. Compared with exposure to fresh air, SHS induced enhanced bronchial contractile responses mediated by the 5-hydroxytryptamine 2A (5-HT(2A)) receptors as well as the endothelin type B (ET(B)) and type A (ET(A)) receptors. The response curves were shifted toward the left with an increased maximal contraction (E(max)) demonstrating that SHS induced AHR. Additionally, the mRNA and protein levels of the 5-HT(2A), ET(B) and ET(A) receptors were increased. Furthermore, SHS exposure increased the phosphorylation of Raf-1 and ERK1/2, but it did not alter p38 or JNK. A Raf-1 inhibitor (GW5074) suppressed the SHS-induced increase in the expression of 5-HT(2A) and ET(A) receptors and the receptor-mediated AHR.
Our findings show that SHS exposure induces transcriptional upregulation of the 5-HT(2A), ET(B) and ET(A) receptors in rat bronchial smooth muscle cells, which mediates AHR. The Raf/ERK/MAPK pathway is involved in SHS-associated receptor upregulation and AHR.
Members of the Ras protooncogene family are mutated in approximately 75% of colon cancers. The Raf kinases (Raf-1, b-Raf and a-Raf) directly interact with Ras and serve as mediators of mitogenic signals. Expression of the constitutively active alleles of Raf or Ras gene families results in oncogenesis in a number of model systems. Previous studies emphasized the importance of Raf-1 and b-Raf in preventing apoptosis in addition to their roles in cell growth. In the present study, we examined whether inhibition of the Raf-1 or b-Raf kinase decreases cell growth and increases apoptosis in colon cancer cells. c-Raf and b-Raf were depleted in colon cancer cell lines, such as HCT116, HT29 and Colo205, containing Ras or b-Raf mutations by RNA interference (RNAi). The results showed that colon cancer cells with activating Ras mutations undergo apoptosis following Raf-1 inhibition, as determined by cell cycle analysis and the release of cytochrome c. Moreover, in b-Raf mutant colon cancers, the inhibition of b-Raf as compared to Raf-1 is crucial for cancer cell death. There is increasing evidence for both MEK-independent Raf signaling and Raf-independent MEK signaling. Thus, we investigated whether targeting multiple points of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway with a MEK inhibitor and Raf RNAi increases cancer cell death. The results showed that combination therapy, inhibiting Raf and MEK kinases simultaneously, increased apoptosis in colon cancer cells. Taken together, our data demonstrate that combination therapy targeting the MAPK pathway at two distinct points, Raf kinase and MEK, has greater efficacy in increasing cancer cell death and is likely to improve therapeutic outcomes for patients.
