The nuclear receptor CAR was first implicated as a transcription factor that activates the cytochrome P450 Cyp2b10 gene. In response to PB, CAR forms a heterodimer with the retinoid X receptor (RXR), binds to a PB response element (typified by DR-4 motif), and activates transcription of the gene. In the CAR-null mouse, PB does not only induce the Cyp2b10 gene, but also induces genes encoding various metabolizing enzymes. Thus, CAR is a general nuclear receptor that is essential for PB induction of drug/steroid metabolizing enzymes. PB also induces amino levulinate synthase 1 (ALAS-1), the rate-limiting enzyme in heme biosynthesis, to increase heme supply. However, PB induction of the synthase occurs in CAR-null mice, suggesting that CAR does not coordinate the heme synthesis for the induction of drug/steroid metabolism.
The induction of CYP2B gene expression by phenobarbital (PB) is mediated by the translocation of the constitutive androstane receptor (CAR) from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. The CAR/RXR heterodimer binds to two DR-4 sites in a complex phenobarbital responsive unit (PBRU) in the CYP2B gene. The short heterodimer partner (SHP), an orphan nuclear receptor that lacks a conventional DNA binding domain, was initially identified by its interaction with CAR. We have examined the role of SHP in CAR-mediated transactivation of the CYP2B gene. Coexpression of SHP inhibited the transactivation of the CYP2B gene by CAR in cultured hepatoma cells and the p160 coactivator GRIP1 reversed the inhibition. The interaction of CAR with SHP was confirmed by GST pulldown experiments. SHP did not block the binding of either CAR/RXR to the PBRU or binding of GRIP1 to the CAR/RXR complex in gel mobility shift assays, but slightly increased CAR/RXR binding and slightly altered the mobility of the CAR/RXR/GRIP1 complex, suggesting an interaction of SHP with these complexes. The presence of SHP in the complexes, however, could not be detected in an antibody supershift assay. Recombinant corepressors mSin3A, SMRT, and HDAC1, but not NCoR1, interacted with GST-SHP but each of these corepressors in liver nuclear extracts bound to GST-SHP. SMRT and NCoR1 inhibited CAR-mediated activation independent of SHP, but mSin3A and HDAC1 had little effect alone, and were additive with SHP. These studies demonstrate that SHP does not inhibit CAR-mediated trans-activation by interfering with DNA binding or by competition with GRIP1. Instead, SHP may either inhibit recruitment of other coactivators by GRIP1 or actively recruit corepressors directly to the CAR/RXR/PBRU complex.
The apical sodium-dependent bile salt transporter (ASBT/SLC10A2), also called the ileal bile acid transporter, mediates the intestinal absorption of bile salts. The efficiency of this transport process is a determinant of hepatic bile salt synthesis from cholesterol and of serum triglyceride levels. Our aim was to characterize the human ASBT gene promoter with respect to regulatory mechanisms that coordinately affect ASBT expression and hepatic lipid and bile salt metabolism. The minimal construct that confers full promoter activity contains three functional hepatocyte nuclear factor 1alpha (HNF1alpha) recognition sites, explaining the dependence of ASBT gene expression upon HNF1alpha. A nuclear receptor binding site arranged as a direct hexanucleotide repeat (DR1 motif) is localized approximately 1.6 kb upstream of the transcription initiation site. Constructs containing this element were transactivated by WY14643 and ciprofibrate, ligands of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARalpha), in Caco2 cells. The DR1 element was shown to bind the PPARalpha/9-cis-retinoic acid receptor heterodimer, and targeted mutagenesis of the DR1 motif abolished PPARalpha responsiveness. Ciprofibrate treatment of SK-ChA cholangiocytes increased ASBT mRNA levels, suggesting a physiologic role for PPARalpha-mediated ASBT gene regulation. This study identifies PPARalpha as a novel link between ileal bile salt absorption and hepatic lipid metabolism.
Sister of P-glycoprotein (SPGP) is the major hepatic bile salt export pump (BSEP). BSEP/SPGP expression varies dramatically among human livers. The potency and hierarchy of bile acids as ligands for the farnesyl/bile acid receptor (FXR/BAR) paralleled their ability to induce BSEP in human hepatocyte cultures. FXR:RXR heterodimers bound to IR1 elements and enhanced bile acid transcriptional activation of the mouse and human BSEP/SPGP promoters. In FXR/BAR nullizygous mice, which have dramatically reduced BSEP/SPGP levels, hepatic CYP3A11 and CYP2B10 were strongly but unexpectedly induced. Notably, the rank order of bile acids as CYP3A4 inducers and activators of pregnane X receptor/steroid and xenobiotic receptor (PXR/SXR) closely paralleled each other but was markedly different from their hierarchy and potency as inducers of BSEP in human hepatocytes. Moreover, the hepatoprotective bile acid ursodeoxycholic acid, which reverses hydrophobic bile acid hepatotoxicity, activates PXR and efficaciously induces CYP3A4 (a bile-metabolizing enzyme) in primary human hepatocytes thus providing one mechanism for its hepatoprotection. Because serum and urinary bile acids increased in FXR/BAR -/- mice, we evaluated hepatic transporters for compensatory changes that might circumvent the profound decrease in BSEP/SPGP. We found weak MRP3 up-regulation. In contrast, MRP4 was substantially increased in the FXR/BAR nullizygous mice and was further elevated by cholic acid. Thus, enhanced hepatocellular concentrations of bile acids, due to the down-regulation of BSEP/SPGP-mediated efflux in FXR nullizygous mice, result in an alternate but apparent compensatory up-regulation of CYP3A, CYP2B, and some ABC transporters that is consistent with activation of PXR/SXR by bile acids.
The vectorial transport of bile salts from blood into bile is essential for the generation of bile flow, solubilization of cholesterol in bile, and emulsification of lipids in the intestine. Major transport proteins involved in the enterohepatic circulation of bile salts include the hepatocellular bile salt export pump (BSEP, ABCB11), the apical sodium-dependent bile salt transporter (ASBT, SLC10A2) in cholangiocytes and enterocytes, the sodium-dependent hepatocyte bile salt uptake system NTCP (SLC10A1), the organic anion transporting polypeptides OATP-C (SLC21A6), OATP8 (SLC21A8) and OATP-A (SLC21A3), and the multidrug resistance protein MRP3 (ABCC3). Synthesis and transport of bile salts are intricately linked processes that undergo extensive feedback and feed-forward regulation by transcriptional and posttranscriptional mechanisms. A key regulator of hepatocellular bile salt homeostasis is the bile acid receptor/farnesoid X receptor FXR, which activates transcription of the BSEP and OATP8 genes and of the small heterodimer partner 1 (SHP). SHP is a transcriptional repressor that mediates bile acid-induced repression of the bile salt uptake systems rat Ntcp and human OATP-C. A nuclear receptor that activates rodent Oatp2 (Slc21a5) and human MRP2 (ABCC2) is the pregnane X receptor/steroid X receptor PXR/SXR. Intracellular trafficking and membrane insertion of bile salt transporters is regulated by lipid, protein, and extracellular signal-related kinases in response to physiologic stimuli such as cyclic adenosine monophosphate or taurocholate. Finally, dysfunction of individual bile salt transporters such as BSEP, on account of genetic mutations, steric inhibition, suppression of gene expression, or disturbed signaling, is an important cause of cholestatic liver disease.
Phenobarbital (PB) increases hepatic drug/steroid-metabolic capability by coordinately activating transcription of the genes encoding various metabolizing enzymes. The nuclear receptor CAR was first implicated as a transcription factor that activates the cytochrome P450 Cyp2b10 gene. In response to PB, CAR forms a heterodimer with the retinoid X receptor (RXR), binds to a PB response element (typified by DR-4 motif), and activates transcription of the gene. In the CAR-null mouse, PB does not only induce the Cyp2b10 gene, but also induces genes encoding various metabolizing enzymes. Thus, CAR is a general nuclear receptor that is essential for PB induction of drug/steroid metabolizing enzymes. PB also induces amino levulinate synthase 1 (ALAS-1), the rate-limiting enzyme in heme biosynthesis, to increase heme supply. However, PB induction of the synthase occurs in CAR-null mice, suggesting that CAR does not coordinate the heme synthesis for the induction of drug/steroid metabolism.
The functional mapping of the human cytochrome P4502D6 (CYP2D6) promoter in HepG2 cells revealed the presence of both positive and negative regulatory elements. One of these regulatory elements overlapped a sequence that is highly conserved in most members of the CYP2 family. This element, which consists of a degenerate AGGTCA direct repeat spaced by 1 base pair (DR1) and is known to be a target for members of the steroid receptor superfamily, was found to bind in vitro translated hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 (HNF4) in gel retardation analysis. Using HepG2 nuclear extracts, three protein-DNA complexes were formed on the DR1 element, one of which was confirmed to be dependent on the binding of HNF4. The other DR1 complexes were shown to be due to the interaction of the orphan receptor chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter transcription factor I (COUP-TFI). Experiments in COS-7 cells showed that HNF4 could activate the CYP2D6 promoter 30-fold. Surprisingly, mutation of the DR1 element produced a relatively minor 23% decrease in activity in HepG2 cells. Additionally, COUP-TFI was shown to inhibit HNF4 stimulation of the CYP2D6 promoter in COS-7 cells, suggesting that COUP-TFI could attenuate the effect of HNF4 in HepG2 cells. However, when HNF4 levels were increased in HepG2 cells by co-transfection, it resulted in the enhancement of CYP2D6 promoter activity, indicating that HNF4 could overcome the repressive effect of COUP-TFI. Therefore, the contribution of the DR1 element in controlling the transcription of the CYP2D6 gene depends on the balance between positively and negatively acting transcription factors.
1,25 Dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25(OH)(2)D) regulates the differentiation of keratinocytes. 1,25(OH)(2)D raises intracellular free calcium (Cai) as a necessary early step toward stimulating differentiation. 1,25(OH)(2)D induces the calcium sensing receptor (CaR) in keratinocytes and enhances the calcium response of these cells. Activation of the CaR by calcium increases intracellular free calcium by a mechanism involving phospholipase C (PLC) cleavage of phosphatidylinositolbisphosphate into inositoltrisphosphate (IP(3)) and diacylglycerol (DG). 1,25(OH)(2)D induces the family of PLCs. PLC-gamma1 has a DR6 VDRE in its promoter which binds and is activated by VDR/RAR rather than VDR/RXR. The involucrin gene, which encodes a critical component of the cornified envelope, contains a DR3 VDRE in its promoter that acts in conjunction with a nearby AP-1 site. The sequential regulation of these genes is critical for the differentiation process. In undifferentiated keratinocytes, the VDR binds preferentially to the DRIP complex of coactivators. However, with differentiation DRIP 205 is no longer produced, and the VDR switches partners to the SRC family (SRC2 and 3). These studies suggest that at least part of the sequential activation of genes required during keratinocyte differentiation is regulated by the change (availability) of these different coactivator complexes.
The catabolism of cholesterol into bile acids is regulated by oxysterols and bile acids, which induce or repress transcription of the pathway's rate-limiting enzyme cholesterol 7alpha-hydroxylase (CYP7A1). The nuclear receptor LXRalpha binds oxysterols and mediates feed-forward induction. Here, we show that repression is coordinately regulated by a triumvirate of nuclear receptors, including the bile acid receptor, FXR; the promoter-specific activator, LRH-1; and the promoter-specific repressor, SHP. Feedback repression of CYP7A1 is accomplished by the binding of bile acids to FXR, which leads to transcription of SHP. Elevated SHP protein then inactivates LRH-1 by forming a heterodimeric complex that leads to promoter-specific repression of both CYP7A1 and SHP. These results reveal an elaborate autoregulatory cascade mediated by nuclear receptors for the maintenance of hepatic cholesterol catabolism.
Cholesterol 7alpha-hydroxylase (CYP7A1) plays a key role in maintaining lipid and bile salt homeostasis as it is the rate-limiting enzyme converting cholesterol to bile acids. Deficiency of CYP7A1 leads to hyperlipidemia in man and mouse. Hyperlipidemia is often seen in patients when treated with high-dose retinoic acid (RA), but the molecular mechanisms remain elusive. Our present study revealed that CYP7A1 mRNA expression is greatly repressed by RA in both human hepatocytes and HepG2 cells where increased fibroblast growth factor 19 (FGF19) and small heterodimer partner (SHP) expressions were also observed, suggesting farnesoid X receptor (FXR) and retinoid X receptor (RXR) were activated. Promoter reporter assays demonstrate that all-trans RA (atRA) specifically activated FXR/RXR. However, detailed molecular analyses indicate that this activation is through RXR, whose ligand is 9-cis RA. Knocking down of FXR or RXRalpha by small interference RNA (siRNA) in human hepatocytes increased CYP7A1 basal expression, but the repressive effect of atRA persisted, suggesting there are also FXR/RXR-independent mechanisms mediating atRA repression of CYP7A1 expression. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay and cell transfection results indicate that PGC-1alpha plays a role in the FXR/RXR-independent mechanism. Our findings may provide a potential explanation for hyperlipidemic side effects observed in some patients treated with high-dose RA.
Hepatocyte nuclear factor 1alpha (HNF1alpha) and HNF4alpha are liver-selective transcription factors and are essential for hepatocyte differentiation. This study demonstrates that HNF1alpha as well as HNF4alpha genes contain a direct repeat with a space of one nucleotide (DR1)-retinoic acid (RA) response element that can be bound and regulated by RA and retinoid x receptor alpha (RXRalpha) complex. Transient transfection experiments showed that RA increased the promoter activity of the HNF1alpha and HNF4alpha genes in Hep3B cells. Overexpression of RXRalpha further enhanced the activities of both genes. Two putative RXRalpha binding sites on the HNF1alpha (-295 to -276) and HNF4alpha (-418 to -399) genes have been characterized. By transient transfection, both sites positively responded to RA, and overexpression of RXRalpha in Hep3B cells increased the regulatory effect. Gel mobility shift assay demonstrated that these two DR-1 sites could be bound by RXRalpha specifically. These data suggest that the differentiation effect of RA on hepatocyte may be due to direct interaction of RXRalpha with the RA-responsive elements on the HNF1alpha and HNF4alpha genes.

Peroxisome proliferator-activator receptors (PPAR) are involved in cholesterol homeostasis through the regulation of bile acids synthesis, composition, and reclamation. As ileal bile acid-binding protein (I-BABP) is thought to play a crucial role in the enterohepatic circulation of bile acids, we investigated whether I-BABP gene expression could also be affected by PPAR. Indeed, treatment with the PPARalpha-PPARbeta/delta agonist bezafibrate led to the up-regulation of I-BABP mRNA levels in the human intestine-derived Caco-2 cells. Cotransfections of the reporter-linked human I-BABP promoter (hI-BABP-2769/+44) together with PPAR and RXR expression vectors demonstrated that the fibrate-mediated induction of the I-BABP gene is dependent on PPARalpha or PPARbeta/delta. Using progressive 5' deletions of the hI-BABP promoter and sequence analysis, we identified a putative PPAR-binding site located at the position -198 and -186 upstream of the transcription initiation site. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays showed that the PPAR/RXR heterodimer can specifically bind to this PPRE-like motif. The deletion of the PPRE within the hI-BABP promoter abolished the PPAR-mediated transactivation in transient transfection assays. The regulation of the I-BABP promoter by PPAR appears species-specific, as the mouse I-BABP promoter, which lacks a conserved PPRE, was not responsive to exogenous PPAR expression in the presence of bezafibrate. Our findings show that the I-BABP gene may be a novel target for PPAR in humans and further emphasize the role for PPAR in the control of bile acid homeostasis.
The human multidrug resistance gene MDR3 encodes a P-glycoprotein that belongs to the ATP-binding cassette transporter family (ABCB4). MDR3 is a critical trans-locator for phospholipids across canalicular membranes of hepatocytes, evidenced by the fact that human MDR3 deficiencies result in progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis type III. It has been reported previously that MDR3 expression is modulated by hormones, cellular stress, and xenobiotics. Here we show that the MDR3 gene is trans-activated by the farnesoid X receptor (FXR) via a direct binding of FXR/retinoid X receptor alpha heterodimers to a highly conserved inverted repeat element (a FXR response element) at the distal promoter (-1970 to -1958). In FXR trans-activation assays, both the endogenous FXR agonist chenodeoxycholate and the synthetic agonist GW4064 activated the MDR3 promoter. Deletion or mutation of this inverted repeat element abolished FXR-mediated MDR3 promoter activation. Consistent with these data, MDR3 mRNA was significantly induced by both chenodeoxycholate and GW4064 in primary human hepatocytes in time- and dose-dependent fashions. In conclusion, we demonstrate that MDR3 expression is directly up-regulated by FXR. These results, together with the previous report that the bile salt export pump is a direct FXR target, suggest that FXR coordinately controls secretion of bile salts and phospholipids. Results of this study further support the notion that FXR is a master regulator of lipid metabolism.
Phenobarbital (PB) increases hepatic drug/steroid-metabolic capability by coordinately activating transcription of the genes encoding various metabolizing enzymes. The nuclear receptor CAR was first implicated as a transcription factor that activates the cytochrome P450 Cyp2b10 gene. In response to PB, CAR forms a heterodimer with the retinoid X receptor (RXR), binds to a PB response element (typified by DR-4 motif), and activates transcription of the gene. In the CAR-null mouse, PB does not only induce the Cyp2b10 gene, but also induces genes encoding various metabolizing enzymes. Thus, CAR is a general nuclear receptor that is essential for PB induction of drug/steroid metabolizing enzymes. PB also induces amino levulinate synthase 1 (ALAS-1), the rate-limiting enzyme in heme biosynthesis, to increase heme supply. However, PB induction of the synthase occurs in CAR-null mice, suggesting that CAR does not coordinate the heme synthesis for the induction of drug/steroid metabolism.
It has been hypothesised, mainly from studies with animal models of liver disease, that the transport of substrates for metabolic enzymes and their subsequent metabolism and elimination in hepatic bile or blood is co-ordinated, but there is little information on this process in diseased human liver.
In this study we have measured by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) major genes involved in drug metabolism from UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGT1A1, UGT1A6, UGT1A9, and UGT2B4) and cytochrome P450 (CYP) families (CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, and CYP3A4), transport (OATP-C, MRP2, MRP3, and MDR1) and major transcription factors (PXR, CAR, HNF1alpha, HNF4alpha, RXR, and AHR) involved in their regulation. Liver biopsy tissue from patients with viral hepatitis was scored for inflammation and fibrosis by the METAVIR system, and separated into groups with mild (A0-1; F0-1, n = 20) or severe (A2-3; F3-4, n = 19) liver disease. Correlation analysis (Spearman rank-test, P &lt; 0.05) was used to identify metabolic enzymes and transporters which shared significant correlation with transcription factors.
Our results show an extensive correlation between transcription factors, transporters, and metabolic enzymes. An unexpected finding was that this was substantially greater in the severely diseased liver. Cross-talk between transcription factors was markedly increased in tissue from patients with severe liver disease, particularly between CAR, HNF4alpha, and PXR.
Our results support the hypothesis of co-ordinate regulation of metabolic enzymes and transporters in diseased human liver, as part of a widespread co-ordinated process under the control of nuclear receptor transcription factors.

Multidrug resistance-associated proteins 2-4 (MRP2-4) are membrane efflux transporters critical for the hepatic clearance of pharmaceuticals and endogenous chemicals. Little is known about the constitutive regulation of MRP2-4 mRNA in normal human liver. The purpose of this study was to identify transcription factors whose expression significantly correlates with MRP2-4 mRNA in human liver specimens. Ninety adult human livers were profiled for mRNA expression of MRP2-4 as well as aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), constitutive androstane receptor (CAR), pregnane X receptor (PXR), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPAR alpha) and gamma (gamma), liver X receptor alpha (LXR alpha), farnesoid X receptor (FXR), glucocorticoid receptor (GR), retinoid X receptor alpha (RXR alpha), hepatocyte nuclear factor 1 alpha (HNF1 alpha) and 4 alpha (4 alpha), and nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) transcription factors. Using linear regression and stepwise selection of partial R(2)-values, CAR, HNF1 alpha, and PPAR alpha mRNA exhibited the greatest correlation with MRP2, 3, and 4, respectively. Interindividual variation in the expression of the identified transcription factors may account for the variability in constitutive mRNA levels of MRP2-4. The multivariate approach presented in this study should aid in predicting signalling pathways that participate either directly or indirectly in regulating hepatic drug disposition.

Hepatobiliary transporters are down-regulated in toxic and cholestatic liver injury. Cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin 1 beta (IL-1 beta) are attributed to mediate this regulation, but their particular contribution in vivo is still unknown. Thus, we studied the molecular mechanisms by which Ntcp, Oatp1, Oatp2, and Mrp2 are regulated by proinflammatory cytokines during liver injury. Rats were injected intraperitoneally with either carbon tetrachloride or endotoxin. Inactivation of TNF-alpha and IL-1 beta was achieved by repetitive intraperitoneal injection of etanercept and anakinra, respectively. Messenger RNA (mRNA) levels of transporters and binding activities as well as nuclear protein levels of Ntcp, Oatp2, and Mrp2 transactivators were determined 20 to 24 hours later. In contrast to IL-1 beta, TNF-alpha inactivation alone fully prevented down-regulation of Ntcp, Oatp1, and Oatp2 mRNA as well as reduced binding activity of hepatocyte nuclear factor 1 (HNF-1) in CCl(4)-induced toxic injury. In endotoxemia, down-regulation of Mrp2, and partially in case of Ntcp, could be prevented by IL-1 beta but not TNF-alpha blockade. However, inactivation of either cytokine led to preservation of HNF1 and partially of retinoid X receptor/retinoic acid receptor (RXR/RAR) binding activity. No effect of anticytokines was seen on pregnane X receptor (PXR) and constitutive androstane receptor (CAR) binding activity as well as nuclear protein mass. In conclusion, TNF-alpha represents the master cytokine responsible for HNF1-dependent down-regulation of Ntcp, Oatp1, and Oatp2 in CCl(4)-induced toxic liver injury. IL-1 beta predominates in a complex signaling network of Ntcp and Mrp2 regulation in cholestatic liver injury. In contrast to in vitro studies, HNF1 and RXR/RAR-independent mechanisms appear to be more important in regulation of Mrp2 and Ntcp gene expression in endotoxemia.
The multidrug resistance-associated protein 3 (MRP3) is a multispecific anion transporter that is capable of transporting a number of conjugated and unconjugated bile acids. Expression of the MRP3 gene is increased during pathological states associated with elevated bile acid concentrations indicating a role for this transporter in adaptive and homeostatic bile acid metabolism. Analysis of Mrp3 mRNA levels in various mouse tissues with known relevance and/or exposure to bile acids revealed the highest levels of basal expression in the colon followed in order by the liver, duodenum, jejunum, ileum, and kidney. Functional analysis of a murine Mrp3 promoter reporter construct revealed vitamin D receptor (VDR)-dependent activation by 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) (VD3), 9-cis-retinoic acid (RA), and the cholestatic secondary bile acid, lithocholic acid (LCA). Using a series of deletion constructs combined with sequence analysis, a candidate VDR response element (VDRE) was identified between -1028 and -1014 bp of the Mrp3 promoter. Activation of the Mrp3 promoter in response to VD3, RA, or LCA, as well as binding of VDR/RXR heterodimers, was attenuated substantially by mutation of this VDRE. Treatment of mice with VD3 or LCA demonstrated in vivo modulation of the Mrp3 gene in colon but not in the liver. Reduction of endogenous VDR expression in colon adenocarcinoma MCA-38 cells by siRNA transfection was associated with reduced constitutive and inducible expression of the Mrp3 gene. These data support a regulatory role for the VDR in the protection of colon cells from bile acid toxicity through regulation of the Mrp3 expression.
Lysyl oxidase (LOX) remodels the tumour microenvironment by cross-linking the extracellular matrix. LOX overexpression is associated with poor cancer outcomes. Here, we find that LOX regulates the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) to drive tumour progression. We show that LOX regulates EGFR by suppressing TGFβ1 signalling through the secreted protease HTRA1. This increases the expression of Matrilin2 (MATN2), an EGF-like domain-containing protein that traps EGFR at the cell surface to facilitate its activation by EGF. We describe a pharmacological inhibitor of LOX, CCT365623, which disrupts EGFR cell surface retention and delays the growth of primary and metastatic tumour cells in vivo. Thus, we show that LOX regulates EGFR cell surface retention to drive tumour progression, and we validate the therapeutic potential of inhibiting this pathway with the small molecule inhibitor CCT365623.
Obesity and stroke are multifactorial diseases in which genetic, epigenetic and lifestyle factors are involved. The research aims were, first, the description of genes with differential epigenetic regulation obtained by an 'omics' approach in patients with ischemic stroke and, second, to determine the importance of some regions of these selected genes in biological processes depending on the body mass index. A case-control study using two populations was designed. The first population consisted of 24 volunteers according to stroke/non-stroke and normal weight/obesity conditions. The second population included 60 stroke patients and 55 controls classified by adiposity. DNA from the first population was analyzed with a methylation microarray, showing 80 cytosine-guanine dinucleotides (CpG) sites differentially methylated in stroke and 96 CpGs in obesity, whereas 59 CpGs showed interaction. After validating these data by MassArray Epityper, the promoter region of peptidase M20 domain containing 1 (PM20D1) gene was significantly hypermethylated in stroke patients. One CpG site at Caldesmon 1 (CALD1) gene showed an interaction between stroke and obesity. Two CpGs located in the genes Wilms' tumor 1 (WT1) and potassium voltage-gated channel, KQT-like subfamily, member 1 (KCNQ1) were significantly hypermethylated in obese patients. In the second population, KCNQ1 was also hypermethylated in the obese subjects. Two CpGs of this gene were subsequently validated by methylation-sensitive high-resolution melting. Moreover, KCNQ1 methylation levels were associated with plasma KCNQ1 protein concentrations. In conclusion, obesity induced changes in the KCNQ1 methylation pattern which were also dependent on stroke. Furthermore, the epigenetic marks differentially methylated in the stroke patients were dependent on the previous obese state. These DNA methylation patterns could be used as future potential stroke biomarkers. 
Brown and beige adipocytes are specialized cells that express uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) and dissipate chemical energy as heat. These cells likely possess alternative UCP1-independent thermogenic mechanisms. Here, we identify a secreted enzyme, peptidase M20 domain containing 1 (PM20D1), that is enriched in UCP1(+) versus UCP1(-) adipocytes. We demonstrate that PM20D1 is a bidirectional enzyme in vitro, catalyzing both the condensation of fatty acids and amino acids to generate N-acyl amino acids and also the reverse hydrolytic reaction. N-acyl amino acids directly bind mitochondria and function as endogenous uncouplers of UCP1-independent respiration. Mice with increased circulating PM20D1 have augmented respiration and increased N-acyl amino acids in blood. Lastly, administration of N-acyl amino acids to mice improves glucose homeostasis and increases energy expenditure. These data identify an enzymatic node and a family of metabolites that regulate energy homeostasis. This pathway might be useful for treating obesity and associated disorders. 
The chances to develop Alzheimer's disease (AD) result from a combination of genetic and non-genetic risk factors 1 , the latter likely being mediated by epigenetic mechanisms 2 . In the past, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified an important number of risk loci associated with AD pathology 3 , but a causal relationship remains difficult to establish. In contrast, locus-specific or epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) have revealed site-specific epigenetic alterations, which provide mechanistic insights for a particular risk gene but often lack the statistical power of GWAS 4 . Here, combining both approaches, we report a previously unidentified association of the peptidase M20-domain-containing protein 1 (PM20D1) with AD. We find that PM20D1 is a methylation and expression quantitative trait locus coupled to an AD-risk associated haplotype, which displays enhancer-like characteristics and contacts the PM20D1 promoter via a haplotype-dependent, CCCTC-binding-factor-mediated chromatin loop. Furthermore, PM20D1 is increased following AD-related neurotoxic insults at symptomatic stages in the APP/PS1 mouse model of AD and in human patients with AD who are carriers of the non-risk haplotype. In line, genetically increasing or decreasing the expression of PM20D1 reduces and aggravates AD-related pathologies, respectively. These findings suggest that in a particular genetic background, PM20D1 contributes to neuroprotection against AD.
The present study aimed to characterize the epigenetic architecture by studying the DNA methylation signature in bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BM‑MSCs) from patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Microarray dataset GSE79695 was downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus database. Differentially methylated sites and differentially methylated CpG islands were identified in BM‑MSC samples from patients with AML compared with controls. MicroRNAs (miRs) encoding genes covering differentially methylated sites were found and the regulation network was constructed. Pathway enrichment analysis of hypermethylated genes and hypomethylated genes was performed, followed by protein‑protein interaction (PPI) network construction. Moreover, the identified differentially methylated genes were compared with the leukemia‑related marker/therapeutic genes from the literature. Overall, 228 hypermethylated CpG site probes covering 183 gene symbols and 523 hypomethylated CpG sites probes covering 362 gene symbols were identified in the BM‑MSCs from AML patients. Furthermore, 4 genes with CpG island hypermethylation were identified, including peptidase M20 domain containing 1 (PM20D1). The hsa‑miR‑596‑encoding gene MIR596 was found to be hypermethylated and the regulation network based on hsa‑miR‑596 and its targets (such as cytochrome P450 family 1 subfamily B member 1) was constructed. Hypermethylated and hypomethylated genes were enriched in different Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathways, including 'hsa05221: Acute myeloid leukemia' and 'hsa05220: Chronic myeloid leukemia', which the hypomethylated gene mitogen‑activated protein kinase 3 (MAPK3) was involved in. In addition, MAPK3, lysine demethylase 2B and RAP1A, member of RAS oncogene family were hubs in the PPI network of methylated genes. In conclusion, PM20D1 with hypermethylation of CpG islands may be associated with the energy expenditure of patients with AML. Furthermore, the aberrantly hypermethylated miR‑159‑encoding gene MIR159 may be a potential biomarker of AML.
N-acyl amino acids (NAAs) are a structurally diverse class of bioactive signaling lipids whose endogenous functions have largely remained uncharacterized. To clarify the physiologic roles of NAAs, we generated mice deficient in the circulating enzyme peptidase M20 domain-containing 1 (PM20D1). Global PM20D1-KO mice have dramatically reduced NAA hydrolase/synthase activities in tissues and blood with concomitant bidirectional dysregulation of endogenous NAAs. Compared with control animals, PM20D1-KO mice exhibit a variety of metabolic and pain phenotypes, including insulin resistance, altered body temperature in cold, and antinociceptive behaviors. Guided by these phenotypes, we identify N-oleoyl-glutamine (C18:1-Gln) as a key PM20D1-regulated NAA. In addition to its mitochondrial uncoupling bioactivity, C18:1-Gln also antagonizes certain members of the transient receptor potential (TRP) calcium channels including TRPV1. Direct administration of C18:1-Gln to mice is sufficient to recapitulate a subset of phenotypes observed in PM20D1-KO animals. These data demonstrate that PM20D1 is a dominant enzymatic regulator of NAA levels in vivo and elucidate physiologic functions for NAA signaling in metabolism and nociception.
Bile acids are powerful detergents produced by the liver to aid in the absorption of dietary lipids. We recently reported a novel role for Foxa2 in bile acid metabolism. The winged helix transcription factor Foxa2 is required to prevent intrahepatic cholestasis and liver injury in mice fed a cholic acid-enriched diet. Here, we use functional genomics to study how Foxa2 regulates its targets in a cholic acid-dependent manner. We found that multiple signaling pathways essential for the hepatic response to acute liver injury are impaired in livers of Foxa2-deficient mice, suggesting that the deletion of Foxa2 in the hepatocyte affects the liver on a large scale. We also discovered distinct feed-forward regulatory loops controlling Foxa2-dependent targets in a cholic acid-dependent or -independent manner. We show that Foxa2 interacts with different transcription factors to achieve gene expression responses appropriate for each physiologic state.
Homeostatic regulation of bile acid metabolism and biliary lipid secretion is critical to prevent enterohepatic diseases. Kaestner and coworkers (Bochkis et al., 2008) show that loss of forkhead box transcription factor Foxa2 in the liver leads to hepatic injury due to downregulation in the expression levels of bile acid transporters and detoxification enzymes.
ATP binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) plays a key role in the biogenesis of HDL by promoting the efflux of cellular cholesterol and phospholipids to lipid free apoA-I. Mutations in the ABCA1 gene cause Tangier disease which is characterized by near or complete absence of circulating plasma HDL. In the present study we show that the winged helix/forkhead box containing transcription factor A2 (FOXA2) shown previously to play a role in glucose and bile acid homeostasis in the liver and in energy utilization in adipose tissue is a negative modulator of ABCA1 gene expression in hepatic cells. We show that the ABCA1 promoter contains three FOXA2 binding elements in the proximal region. Two of the sites are localized in a region of the ABCA1 promoter enriched in binding elements for transcriptional repressor proteins whereas the third site is the core of the TATA element of the ABCA1 promoter. Inhibition of FOXA2 binding to the ABCA1 promoter by site-directed mutagenesis or FOXA2 gene expression by siRNA was associated with increased ABCA1 promoter activity and protein levels. Overexpression of FOXA2 inhibited both the constitutive ABCA1 gene expression as well as ABCA1 gene induction by oxysterols and retinoids via nuclear receptors LXRα/RXRα. In summary, the present study identifies transcription factor FOXA2 as a negative modulator of ABCA1 gene expression in hepatic cells and reveals a novel mechanism of transcriptional repression by FOXA2 which involves the TATA element of the ABCA1 gene. 
Cytokine signaling has been connected to regulation of metabolism and energy balance. Numerous cytokine gene expression changes are stimulated by accumulation of bile acids in livers of young Foxa2 liver-conditional null mice. We hypothesized that bile acid-induced inflammation in young Foxa2 mutants, once chronic, affects metabolic homeostasis. We found that loss of Foxa2 in the liver results in a premature aging phenotype, including significant weight gain, reduced food intake, and decreased energy expenditure. We show that Foxa2 antagonizes the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway, resulting in increased hepatic lipogenesis and adiposity. While much prior work has focused on adipose tissue in obesity, we discovered a novel age-onset obesity phenotype in a model where gene deletion occurs only in the liver, underscoring the importance of the role hepatic lipogenesis plays in the development of obesity. 
We previously generated a transgenic mouse line (T-77) in which increased hepatic expression of the hepatocyte nuclear factor-3beta (HNF-3beta) protein was used to assess its role in hepatocyte-specific gene transcription. The T-77 transgenic mice displayed elevated serum bile acid and bilirubin levels and a complete absence of hepatic glycogen storage. These postnatal liver defects were associated with diminished expression of hepatocyte genes involved in gluconeogenesis and bile acid transport as well as reduced levels of hepatocyte transcription factors. In this study, we show that mouse tail vein injections of adenovirus expressing the rat HNF-3beta (AdHNF3beta) cDNA efficiently increased its levels throughout the liver lobule and recapitulated the T-77 transgenic liver phenotype within several days postinfection. Likewise, the AdHNF3beta-infected liver phenotype was associated with reduced hepatic expression of genes involved in glucose homeostasis, bile acid transport, and bilirubin conjugation, which were not found with control adenovirus infections. These studies show that adenovirus-mediated gene transfer is an effective method for rapid hepatic increases in transcription factor levels to determine in vivo target genes. In contrast, AdHNF3alpha-infected liver displayed only a transient reduction in hepatic glycogen levels and was associated with less severe decreases in hepatic expression of gluconeogenic and bilirubin metabolism genes. Consistent with these findings, only T-77 transgenic and AdHNF3beta-infected liver exhibited diminished hepatic expression of the HNF-6 transcription factor, suggesting that reduced HNF-6 levels contribute to diminished HNF-3beta-specific transcriptional activity.
The winged helix transcription factor, hepatocyte nuclear factor-3beta (HNF-3beta), mediates the hepatocyte-specific transcription of numerous genes important for liver function. However, the in vivo role of HNF-3beta in regulating these genes remains unknown because homozygous null HNF3beta mouse embryos die in utero prior to liver formation. In order to examine the regulatory function of HNF-3beta, we created transgenic mice in which the -3-kb transthyretin promoter functions to increase hepatocyte expression of the rat HNF-3beta protein. Postnatal transgenic mice exhibit growth retardation, depletion of hepatocyte glycogen storage, and elevated levels of bile acids in serum. The retarded growth phenotype is likely due to a 20-fold increase in hepatic expression of insulin-like growth factor binding protein 1 (IGFBP-1), which results in elevated levels in serum of IGFBP-1 and limits the biological availability of IGFs required for postnatal growth. The defects in glycogen storage and serum bile acids coincide with diminished postnatal expression of hepatocyte genes involved in gluconeogenesis (phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase and glycogen synthase) and sinusoidal bile acid uptake (Ntcp), respectively. These changes in gene transcription may result from the disruptive effect of HNF-3beta on the hepatic expression of the endogenous mouse HNF-3alpha,-3beta, -3gamma, and -6 transcription factors. Furthermore, adult transgenic livers lack expression of the canalicular phospholipid transporter, mdr2, which is consistent with ultrastructure evidence of damage to transgenic hepatocytes and bile canaliculi. These transgenic studies represent the first in vivo demonstration that the HNF-3beta transcriptional network regulates expression of hepatocyte-specific genes required for bile acid and glucose homeostasis, as well as postnatal growth.
Production of bile by the liver is crucial for the absorption of lipophilic nutrients. Dysregulation of bile acid homeostasis can lead to cholestatic liver disease and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. We show by global location analysis ('ChIP-on-chip') and cell type-specific gene ablation that the winged helix transcription factor Foxa2 is required for normal bile acid homeostasis. As suggested by the location analysis, deletion of Foxa2 in hepatocytes in mice using the Cre-lox system leads to decreased transcription of genes encoding bile acid transporters on both the basolateral and canalicular membranes, resulting in intrahepatic cholestasis. Foxa2-deficient mice are strikingly sensitive to a diet containing cholic acid, which results in toxic accumulation of hepatic bile salts, ER stress and liver injury. In addition, we show that expression of FOXA2 is markedly decreased in liver samples from individuals with different cholestatic syndromes, suggesting that reduced FOXA2 abundance could exacerbate the injury.
Microsomal epoxide hydrolase (mEH) is a bifunctional protein that plays a central role in carcinogen metabolism and is also able to mediate the sodium-dependent uptake of bile acids into hepatocytes. Studies have identified a subject (S-1) with extremely elevated serum bile salt levels in the absence of observable hepatocellular injury, suggesting a defect in bile acid uptake. In this individual, mEH protein and mEH mRNA levels were reduced by approximately 95% and 85%, respectively, whereas the expression and amino acid sequence of another bile acid transport protein (NTCP) was unaffected. Sequence analysis of the mEH gene (EPHX1) revealed a point mutation at an upstream HNF-3 site (allele I) and in intron 1 (allele II), which resulted in a significant decrease in EPHX1 promoter activity in transient transfection assays. Gel shift assays using a radiolabeled oligonucleotide from each region resulted in specific transcription factor binding patterns, which were altered in the presence of the mutation. These studies demonstrate that the expression of mEH is greatly reduced in a patient with hypercholanemia, suggesting that mEH participates in sodium-dependent bile acid uptake in human liver where its absence may contribute to the etiology of this disease.
FOXA2, a member of the forkhead family of transcription factors, plays essential roles in liver development and bile acid homeostasis. In this study, we report a 2.8 Å co-crystal structure of the FOXA2 DNA-binding domain (FOXA2-DBD) bound to a DNA duplex containing a forkhead consensus binding site (GTAAACA). The FOXA2-DBD adopts the canonical winged-helix fold, with helix H3 and wing 1 regions mainly mediating the DNA recognition. Although the wing 2 region was not defined in the structure, isothermal titration calorimetry assays suggested that this region was required for optimal DNA binding. Structure comparison with the FOXA3-DBD bound to DNA revealed more major groove contacts and fewer minor groove contacts in the FOXA2 structure than in the FOXA3 structure. Structure comparison with the FOXO1-DBD bound to DNA showed that different forkhead proteins could induce different DNA conformations upon binding to identical DNA sequences. Our findings provide the structural basis for FOXA2 protein binding to a consensus forkhead site and elucidate how members of the forkhead protein family bind different DNA sites.
Metformin is widely used to treat hyperglycemia. However, metformin treatment may induce intrahepatic cholestasis and liver injury in a few patients with type II diabetes through an unknown mechanism. Here we show that metformin decreases SIRT1 protein levels in primary hepatocytes and liver. Both metformin-treated wild-type C57 mice and hepatic SIRT1-mutant mice had increased hepatic and serum bile acid levels. However, metformin failed to change systemic bile acid levels in hepatic SIRT1-mutant mice. Molecular mechanism study indicates that SIRT1 directly interacts with and deacetylates Foxa2 to inhibit its transcriptional activity on expression of genes involved in bile acids synthesis and transport. Hepatic SIRT1 mutation elevates Foxa2 acetylation levels, which promotes Foxa2 binding to and activating genes involved in bile acids metabolism, impairing hepatic and systemic bile acid homeostasis. Our data clearly suggest that hepatic SIRT1 mediates metformin effects on systemic bile acid metabolism and modulation of SIRT1 activity in liver may be an attractive approach for treatment of bile acid-related diseases such as cholestasis.
Dysregulation of systemic bile acid homeostasis can lead to cholestatic liver diseases and metabolic syndromes. As important anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive drugs, synthetic glucocorticoids (GCs) are used to treat several cholestatic disorders, including biliary atresia (BA), because of their effects on the regulation of bile acid metabolism. However, the molecular mechanisms that underlie GCs regulation of bile acid homeostasis remain unclear.
To provide a mechanistic basis for the effects of GCs on bile acid homeostasis.
Male rats were treated with methylprednisolone for 7 days with slow-release osmotic pumps under physiological and cholestatic status that was induced by bile duct ligation (BDL). Expression of glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and genes related to bile acid metabolism was investigated using western blotting, qRT-PCR and immunohistochemistry.
We show here that sustained treatment with GCs in rats disrupts the normal changes in systemic bile acid distribution by elevating plasma bile acid levels and reducing faecal bile acid loss. Treatment with GCs stimulated bile acid absorption in the ileum by increasing expression of the apical sodium-dependent bile acid transporter (Asbt). Concomitantly, administration of GCs enhanced liver bile acid uptake by increasing the expression of the major hepatocyte basolateral bile transporter (Ntcp). The reduced expression of a bile acid synthesis rate-controlling enzyme, Cyp7a1, suggests that treatment with GCs suppressed hepatic bile acid synthesis.
Our study provides evidence that GCs can increase enterohepatic bile acid circulation through regulation of the biosynthesis and transport of bile salts, which suggests that plasma bile acid levels should be monitored during treatment with GCs in patients with BA.
Capicua (CIC) has been implicated in pathogenesis of spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 and cancer in mammals; however, the in vivo physiological functions of CIC remain largely unknown. Here we show that Cic hypomorphic (Cic-L(-/-)) mice have impaired bile acid (BA) homeostasis associated with induction of proinflammatory cytokines. We discovered that several drug metabolism and BA transporter genes were down-regulated in Cic-L(-/-) liver, and that BA was increased in the liver and serum whereas bile was decreased within the gallbladder of Cic-L(-/-) mice. We also found that levels of proinflammatory cytokine genes were up-regulated in Cic-L(-/-) liver. Consistent with this finding, levels of hepatic transcriptional regulators, such as hepatic nuclear factor 1 alpha (HNF1α), CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein beta (C/EBPβ), forkhead box protein A2 (FOXA2), and retinoid X receptor alpha (RXRα), were markedly decreased in Cic-L(-/-) mice. Moreover, induction of tumor necrosis factor alpha (Tnfα) expression and decrease in the levels of FOXA2, C/EBPβ, and RXRα were found in Cic-L(-/-) liver before BA was accumulated, suggesting that inflammation might be the cause for the cholestasis in Cic-L(-/-) mice. Our findings indicate that CIC is a critical regulator of BA homeostasis, and that its dysfunction might be associated with chronic liver disease and metabolic disorders. 
Cholestasis represents pathophysiologic syndromes defined as an impaired bile flow from the liver. As an outcome, bile acids accumulate and promote hepatocytes injury followed by liver cirrhosis and liver failure. Bile acids induce apoptosis, ER stress and mitochondrial membrane instability. In this study we aimed to investigate the role of cytosolic short form of ALR (Augmenter of Liver Regeneration) in the synthesis of bile acids and bile acid-induced apoptosis. Human hepatoma cells over-expressing the short form of ALR (sfALR, 15 kDa) were incubated with glycochenodeoxycholic acid (GCDCA), and then primary bile acids' production and apoptosis were analyzed. High levels of cytosolic sfALR reduced CYP7A1 mRNA expression and bile acids levels, the rate-limiting enzyme in the classic pathway of bile acid synthesis. This reduction was attributed to STAT3 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 3) activation and reduction of HNF4α (Hepatocyte nuclear factor 4α). Furthermore, apoptosis induction by GCDCA and TRAIL was reduced in cells over-expressing sfALR which was attributed to reduced expression of death receptor 5 (DR5). We found decreased hepatic mRNA levels of ALR and FOXA2 (Forkhead Box A2), an inducer of ALR expression, in human cholestatic liver samples which might explain the increased accumulation of bile acids and bile acid-induced apoptosis in cholestasis patients.
Embedded into a complex signaling network that coordinates glucose uptake, usage and production, the nuclear bile acid receptor FXR is expressed in several glucose-processing organs including the liver. Hepatic gluconeogenesis is controlled through allosteric regulation of gluconeogenic enzymes and by glucagon/cAMP-dependent transcriptional regulatory pathways. We aimed to elucidate the role of FXR in the regulation of fasting hepatic gluconeogenesis.
The role of FXR in hepatic gluconeogenesis was assessed in vivo and in mouse primary hepatocytes. Gene expression patterns in response to glucagon and FXR agonists were characterized by quantitative reverse transcription PCR and microarray analysis. FXR phosphorylation by protein kinase A was determined by mass spectrometry. The interaction of FOXA2 with FXR was identified by cistromic approaches and in vitro protein-protein interaction assays. The functional impact of the crosstalk between FXR, the PKA and FOXA2 signaling pathways was assessed by site-directed mutagenesis, transactivation assays and restoration of FXR expression in FXR-deficient hepatocytes in which gene expression and glucose production were assessed.
FXR positively regulates hepatic glucose production through two regulatory arms, the first one involving protein kinase A-mediated phosphorylation of FXR, which allowed for the synergistic activation of gluconeogenic genes by glucagon, agonist-activated FXR and CREB. The second arm involves the inhibition of FXR's ability to induce the anti-gluconeogenic nuclear receptor SHP by the glucagon-activated FOXA2 transcription factor, which physically interacts with FXR. Additionally, knockdown of Foxa2 did not alter glucagon-induced and FXR agonist enhanced expression of gluconeogenic genes, suggesting that the PKA and FOXA2 pathways regulate distinct subsets of FXR responsive genes.
Thus, hepatic glucose production is regulated during physiological fasting by FXR, which integrates the glucagon/cAMP signal and the FOXA2 signal, by being post-translationally modified, and by engaging in protein-protein interactions, respectively.
Activation of the nuclear bile acid receptor FXR regulates gene expression networks, controlling lipid, cholesterol and glucose metabolism, which are mostly effective after eating. Whether FXR exerts critical functions during fasting is unknown. The results of this study show that FXR transcriptional activity is regulated by the glucagon/protein kinase A and the FOXA2 signaling pathways, which act on FXR through phosphorylation and protein-protein interactions, respectively, to increase hepatic glucose synthesis.
The liver-enriched transcription factor Forkhead Box A2 (FOXA2) has been reported to be involved in bile acid homeostasis and bile duct development. However, the role of FOXA2 in liver fibrogenesis remains undefined. In this study, we found that the abundance of FOXA2 was significantly lower in fibrotic livers of patients and mice treated with CCl4 than in controls. Interestingly, the expression level of FOXA2 decreased in hepatocytes, whereas FOXA2 was elevated in hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) of mouse fibrotic livers. Hepatocyte-specific ablation of FOXA2 in adult mice exacerbated liver fibrosis induced by CCl4. Either lentivirus LV-CMV-FOXA2 mediated FOXA2 overexpression in the liver or adeno-associated virus AAV8-TBG-FOXA2-mediated hepatocyte-specific upregulation of FOXA2 alleviated hepatic fibrosis. Overexpression of FOXA2 in HSCs did not obviously affect hepatic fibrogenesis. Additionally, FOXA2 knockout in hepatocytes resulted in aberrant transcription of metabolic genes. Furthermore, hepatocyte-specific knockout of FOXA2 enhanced endoplasmic reticulum stress (ER stress) and the apoptosis of hepatocytes, whereas FOXA2 overexpression in hepatocytes suppressed ER stress and hepatocyte apoptosis in mouse fibrotic livers. In conclusion, our findings suggested that FOXA2-mediated hepatocyte protection has a therapeutic role in hepatic fibrosis, and thus may be a new, promising anti-fibrotic option for treating chronic liver diseases.
Pax-5 gene is important transcription factor in B-lymphopoiesis and B-cell development. To understand the regulatory mechanism of pax-5 expression, the immediate 5'-flanking region (6 671 bp) of human pax-gene exon 1B was isolated and characterized. Analysis of the total sequence showed that the proximal promoter includes 3 CAT boxes, 1 SP1 and 1 E box. However, there was no consensus sequence for a TATA box in the 5'-flanking region. Putative regulatory sites of further upstream in the sequence revealed 6 LMO(2)COM, 5 NFAT, 2 LPOLYA-B, 3 GATA1, 2 AP4, 10 MZF1, 1 ETS1-B, 1 GATA3, 1 NKX25, 2 RORA1, 1 LYF1, 2 Ikaros2, 2 TCF11, 1 GATA-C and 1 FREAC7. Therefore, the 5'-flanking region of human pax-5 exon 1B could be involved in regulating the expression of human pax-5 and B-cell differentiation and development.
KCNN3 is a member of the gene family, KCNN1-4, encoding the small and intermediate conductance calcium-activated potassium channels. Long CAG-repeat alleles of this gene have been found to be over-represented in patients with schizophrenia in a number of population-based association studies, and this gene maps to human chromosome 1q21, a region recently implicated in schizophrenia by linkage. To set the stage for a further functional evaluation of KCNN3, we defined the nature of the genomic locus in the size, structure, and sequence of its introns and exons and the function of potential upstream regulatory regions. We isolated P1-derived artificial chromosome (PAC) clones from a genomic library and identified an overlapping available bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clone. Cosmids subcloned from the PAC and BAC clones were then sequenced and merged with the sequence in the public database. The KCNN3 gene spans over 163.1 kb and is composed of eight exons and seven introns. All of the exon-intron junctions conform closely to consensus splice sites. The proximal 2.5 kb of the 5'-flanking sequence was obtained and analyzed for potential transcription factor binding sites. In the proximal 2.5 kb upstream region, potential sites for the Ikaros factor (IK2), homeodomain factor Nkx-2.5/Csx (NKX25), nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFAT), upstream stimulating factor (USF), c-AMP responsive element binding protein (CREB), POU factor Brn2 (BRN-2), myeloid zinc finger protein (MZF1), vitellogenin binding protein (VBP), HNF3 forkhead homologue 2 (HFH2), and transcription initiation were identified, as well as several potential AP-1 and AP-4 sites. Finally, a 2261-bp fragment of this upstream region was cloned into a promoterless pGL3-luciferase vector, where it produced orientation-dependent expression of the reporter gene in transiently transfected PC12 cells, cells which natively express functional KCNN3 channels, suggesting that this cloned fragment includes competent promoter elements of this gene.
Congenital heart disease (CHD) is a complex illness with high rates of morbidity and mortality. In embryonic development, the heart is the first formed organ, which is strictly controlled by gene regulatory networks, including transcription factors, signaling pathways, epigenetic factors and microRNAs. Bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)-2 and -4 are essential in cardiogenesis as they can induce the expression of transcription factors, NKX2‑5 and GATA binding protein 4, which are important in the development of the heart. The inhibition of BMP‑2 and ‑4 inhibits the late expression of NKX2-5 and affects cardiac differentiation. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether BMP-2 and ‑4 variations may be associated with CHD in Chinese Han populations. The rs1049007, rs235768 and rs17563 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), which are genetic variations located within the translated region of the BMP-2 and -4, were evaluated in 230 patients with CHD from the Chinese Han population and 160 non-CHD control individuals. Statistical analyses were performed using the χ2 test, implemented using SPSS software (version 13.0). The Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium test was performed on the population using online Online Encyclopedia for Genetic Epidemiology studies software, and multiple-sequence alignments of the BMP proteins were performed using Vector NTI software. No statistically significant associations were identified between these genetic variations and the risk of CHD (rs1049007, P‑value=0.560; rs235768, P‑value=0.972; rs17563, P‑value=0.787). In addition, no correlation was found between the patients with CHD and the non‑CHD control individuals. Therefore, the rs1049007, rs235768 and rs17563 genetic variations of BMP-2 were not associated with CHD in the Chinese Han population. 
Until recently, the mechanism of adaptive thermogenesis was ascribed to the expression of uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) in brown and beige adipocytes. UCP1 is known to catalyze a proton leak of the inner mitochondrial membrane, resulting in uncoupled oxidative metabolism with no production of adenosine triphosphate and increased energy expenditure. Thus increasing brown and beige adipose tissue with augmented UCP1 expression is a viable target for obesity-related disorders. Recent work demonstrates an UCP1-independent pathway to uncouple mitochondrial respiration. A secreted enzyme, PM20D1, enriched in UCP1+ adipocytes, exhibits catalytic and hydrolytic activity to reversibly form N-acyl amino acids. N-acyl amino acids act as endogenous uncouplers of mitochondrial respiration at physiological concentrations. Administration of PM20D1 or its products, N-acyl amino acids, to diet-induced obese mice improves glucose tolerance by increasing energy expenditure. In short-term studies, treated animals exhibit no toxicity while experiencing 10% weight loss primarily of adipose tissue. Further study of this metabolic pathway may identify novel therapies for diabesity, the disease state associated with diabetes and obesity. 
The etiology of respiratory allergies (RA) can be partly explained by DNA methylation changes caused by adverse environmental and lifestyle factors experienced early in life. Longitudinal, prospective studies can aid in the unravelment of the epigenetic mechanisms involved in the disease development. High compliance rates can be expected in these studies when data is collected using non-invasive and convenient procedures. Saliva is an attractive biofluid to analyze changes in DNA methylation patterns. We investigated in a pilot study the differential methylation in saliva of RA (n = 5) compared to healthy controls (n = 5) using the Illumina Methylation 450K BeadChip platform. We evaluated the results against the results obtained in mononuclear blood cells from the same individuals. Differences in methylation patterns from saliva and mononuclear blood cells were clearly distinguishable (PAdj&lt;0.001 and |Δβ|&gt;0.2), though the methylation status of about 96% of the cg-sites was comparable between peripheral blood mononuclear cells and saliva. When comparing RA cases with healthy controls, the number of differentially methylated sites (DMS) in saliva and blood were 485 and 437 (P&lt;0.05 and |Δβ|&gt;0.1), respectively, of which 216 were in common. The methylation levels of these sites were significantly correlated between blood and saliva. The absolute levels of methylation in blood and saliva were confirmed for 3 selected DMS in the PM20D1, STK32C, and FGFR2 genes using pyrosequencing analysis. The differential methylation could only be confirmed for DMS in PM20D1 and STK32C genes in saliva. We show that saliva can be used for genome-wide methylation analysis and that it is possible to identify DMS when comparing RA cases and healthy controls. The results were replicated in blood cells of the same individuals and confirmed by pyrosequencing analysis. This study provides proof-of-concept for the applicability of saliva-based whole-genome methylation analysis in the field of respiratory allergy. 
The PARK16 locus, spanning five genes on chromosome 1, was among the first genetic regions to show genome-wide association in Parkinson's disease (PD). Subsequent investigations have found variability in PARK16 top-hits and association patterns across populations, and the implicated genes and mechanisms are currently unclear. In the present study, we aimed to explore the contribution of PARK16 variability to PD risk in a Scandinavian population. We genotyped 17 single-nucleotide polymorphisms in a case-control sample set of 2570 individuals from Norway and Sweden to fine map the locus. Targeted resequencing of the full coding regions of SLC45A3, NUCKS1, RAB7L1, SLC41A1 and PM20D1 was performed in DNA pools from a subset of 387 patient samples. We find evidence for an association with PD for rs1775143 as well as a haplotype located around the 5' region of RAB7L1, implicating variants which are not in high linkage disequilibrium with the strongest signal from a recent large meta-analysis in Caucasians. We also provide suggestive support for epistasis between RAB7L1 and LRRK2 as previously hypothesized by others. Comparing our results with previous work, allelic heterogeneity at PARK16 appears likely, and further studies are warranted to disentangle the complex patterns of association and pinpoint the functionally relevant variants. 
Childhood abuse is associated with increased adult disease risk, suggesting that processes acting over the long-term, such as epigenetic regulation of gene activity, may be involved. DNA methylation is a critical mechanism in epigenetic regulation. We aimed to establish whether childhood abuse was associated with adult DNA methylation profiles.
In 40 males from the 1958 British Birth Cohort we compared genome-wide promoter DNA methylation in blood taken at 45y for those with, versus those without, childhood abuse (n = 12 vs 28). We analysed the promoter methylation of over 20,000 genes and 489 microRNAs, using MeDIP (methylated DNA immunoprecipitation) in triplicate.
We found 997 differentially methylated gene promoters (311 hypermethylated and 686 hypomethylated) in association with childhood abuse and these promoters were enriched for genes involved in key cell signaling pathways related to transcriptional regulation and development. Using bisulfite-pyrosequencing, abuse-associated methylation (MeDIP) at the metalloproteinase gene, PM20D1, was validated and then replicated in an additional 27 males. Abuse-associated methylation was observed in 39 microRNAs; in 6 of these, the hypermethylated state was consistent with the hypomethylation of their downstream gene targets. Although distributed across the genome, the differentially methylated promoters associated with child abuse clustered in genome regions of at least one megabase. The observations for child abuse showed little overlap with methylation patterns associated with socioeconomic position.
Our observed genome-wide methylation profiles in adult DNA associated with childhood abuse justify the further exploration of epigenetic regulation as a mediating mechanism for long-term health outcomes.
Asthma is a complex disease that involves both genetic factors and environmental exposures. Aberrant epigenetic modifications, such as DNA methylation, may be important in asthma development. Fetal exposure to maternal asthma during critical periods of in utero development may lead to epigenetic alterations that predispose infants to a greater risk of developing asthma themselves. We investigated alterations in the DNA methylation profile of peripheral blood from infants exposed to maternal asthma during pregnancy.
Peripheral blood was collected from 12-month-old infants born to women with (n = 25) and without (n = 15) doctor diagnosed asthma during pregnancy. Genomic DNA was extracted, bisulfite converted, and hybridized to Infinium Methylation 27 arrays (Illumina), containing over27,000 CpGs from 14,495 genes. CpG loci in only autosomal genes were classified as differentially methylated at the 99% level (P &lt; 0.01, |DiffScore| &gt; 22 and delta beta &gt;0.06).
There were 70 CpG loci, corresponding to 67 genes that were significantly differentially methylated. Twelve CpG loci (11 genes) showed greater than 10% comparative difference in DNA methylation, including hyper-methylated loci of FAM181A, MRI1, PIWIL1, CHFR, DEFA1, MRPL28, AURKA, and hypo-methylated loci of NALP1L5, MAP8KIP3, ACAT2, and PM20D1 in maternal asthma. Methylation of MAPK8IP3 was significantly negatively correlated with maternal blood eosinophils (r = -0.38; P = 0.022), maternal eNO (r = -0.44; P = 0.005), and maternal serum total IgE (r = -0.39, P = 0.015). Methylation of AURKA negatively correlated with maternal hemoglobin (r = -0.43; P = 0.008), infants height (r = -0.51; P &lt; 0.001) and weight (r = -0.36; P = 0.021). Methylation of PM20D1 was lower in infants born to mothers with asthma on inhaled corticosteroid treatment. Methylation of PM20D1 was lower and MRI1 was higher in infants born to atopic mothers without asthma.
In an Australian study population, exposure to maternal asthma during pregnancy is associated with differential methylation profiles of infants' peripheral blood DNA, which may act as risk factors for future asthma development.
Epigenetic studies are commonly conducted on DNA from tissue samples. However, tissues are ensembles of cells that may each have their own epigenetic profile, and therefore inter-individual cellular heterogeneity may compromise these studies. Here, we explore the potential for such confounding on DNA methylation measurement outcomes when using DNA from whole blood. DNA methylation was measured using pyrosequencing-based methodology in whole blood (n = 50-179) and in two white blood cell fractions (n = 20), isolated using density gradient centrifugation, in four CGIs (CpG Islands) located in genes HHEX (10 CpG sites assayed), KCNJ11 (8 CpGs), KCNQ1 (4 CpGs) and PM20D1 (7 CpGs). Cellular heterogeneity (variation in proportional white blood cell counts of neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils and basophils, counted by an automated cell counter) explained up to 40% (p&lt;0.0001) of the inter-individual variation in whole blood DNA methylation levels in the HHEX CGI, but not a significant proportion of the variation in the other three CGIs tested. DNA methylation levels in the two cell fractions, polymorphonuclear and mononuclear cells, differed significantly in the HHEX CGI; specifically the average absolute difference ranged between 3.4-15.7 percentage points per CpG site. In the other three CGIs tested, methylation levels in the two fractions did not differ significantly, and/or the difference was more moderate. In the examined CGIs, methylation levels were highly correlated between cell fractions. In summary, our analysis detects region-specific differential DNA methylation between white blood cell subtypes, which can confound the outcome of whole blood DNA methylation measurements. Finally, by demonstrating the high correlation between methylation levels in cell fractions, our results suggest a possibility to use a proportional number of a single white blood cell type to correct for this confounding effect in analyses.
This study examined links between DNA methylation and birth weight centile (BWC), and explored the impact of genetic variation.
Using HumanMethylation450 arrays, we examined candidate gene-associated CpGs in cord blood from newborns with low (&lt;15th centile), medium (40-60th centile) and high (&gt;85th centile) BWC (n = 12). Candidates were examined in an investigation cohort (n = 110) using pyrosequencing and genotyping for putative methylation-associated polymorphisms performed using standard PCR.
Array analysis identified 314 candidate genes associated with BWC extremes, four of which showed ≥ 4 BWC-linked CpGs. Of these, PM20D1 and MI886 suggested genetically determined methylation levels. However, methylation at three CpGs in FGFR2 remained significantly associated with high BWC (p = 0.004-0.027).
We identified a novel biologically plausible candidate (FGFR2) for with BWC that merits further study.
Piglets are characteristically cold intolerant and thus susceptible to high mortality. However, browning of white adipose tissue (WAT) can induce non-shivering thermogenesis as a potential strategy to facilitate the animal's response to cold. Whether cold exposure can induce browning of subcutaneous WAT (sWAT) in piglets in a similar manner as it can in humans remains largely unknown. In this study, piglets were exposed to acute cold (4°C, 10 h) or chronic cold exposure (8°C, 15 days), and the genes and proteins of uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1)-dependent and independent thermogenesis, mitochondrial biogenesis, lipogenic and lipolytic processes were analysed. Interestingly, acute cold exposure induced browning of porcine sWAT, smaller adipocytes and the upregulated expression of UCP1, PGC1α, PGC1β, C/EBPβ, Cidea, UCP3, CKMT1 and PM20D1. Conversely, chronic cold exposure impaired the browning process, reduced mitochondrial numbers and the expression of browning markers, including UCP1, PGC1α and PRDM16. The present study demonstrated that acute cold exposure (but not chronic cold exposure) induces porcine sWAT browning. Thus, browning of porcine sWAT could be a novel strategy to balance the body temperature of piglets, and thus could be protective against cold exposure.
Brown adipose tissue (BAT)-dependent thermogenesis and its suggested augmenting hormone, FGF21, are potential therapeutic targets in current obesity and diabetes research. Here, we studied the role of UCP1 and FGF21 for metabolic homeostasis in the cold and dissected underlying molecular mechanisms using UCP1-FGF21 double-knockout mice. We report that neither UCP1 nor FGF21, nor even compensatory increases of FGF21 serum levels in UCP1 knockout mice, are required for defense of body temperature or for maintenance of energy metabolism and body weight. Remarkably, cold-induced browning of inguinal white adipose tissue (iWAT) is FGF21 independent. Global RNA sequencing reveals major changes in response to UCP1- but not FGF21-ablation in BAT, iWAT, and muscle. Markers of mitochondrial failure and inflammation are observed in BAT, but in particular the enhanced metabolic reprogramming in iWAT supports the thermogenic role of UCP1 and excludes an important thermogenic role of endogenous FGF21 in normal cold acclimation.
Although many genetic variants have been associated with multiple sclerosis (MS) risk, they do not explain all the disease risk and there remains uncertainty as to how these variants contribute to disease. DNA methylation is an epigenetic mechanism that can influence gene expression and has the potential to mediate the effects of environmental factors on MS. In a previous study, we found a differentially methylation region (DMR) at MHC HLA-DRB1 that was associated within relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) patients in CD4+ T cells. This study aimed to confirm this earlier finding in an independent RRMS cohort of treatment-naïve female patients.
Total genomic DNA was extracted from CD4+ T cells of 28 female RRMS and 22 age-matched healthy controls subjects. DNA was bisulfite-converted and hybridised to Illumina 450K arrays. Beta values for all CpGs were analysed using the DMPFinder function in the MINFI program, and a follow-up prioritisation process was applied to identify the most robust MS-associated DMRs.
This study confirmed our previous findings of a hypomethylated DMR at HLA-DRB1 and a hypermethylated DMR at HLA-DRB5 in this RRMS patient cohort. In addition, we identified a large independent DMR at MHC, whereby 11 CpGs in RNF39 were hypermethylated in MS cases compared to controls (max. ∆beta = 0.19, P = 2.1 × 10-4). We did not find evidence that SNP genotype was influencing the DMR in this cohort. A smaller MHC DMR was also identified at HCG4B, and two non-MHC DMRs at PM20D1 on chr1 and ERICH1 on chr8 were also identified.
The findings from this study confirm our previous results of a DMR at HLA-DRB1 and also suggest hypermethylation in an independent MHC locus, RNF39, is associated with MS. Taken together, our results highlight the importance of epigenetic factors at the MHC locus in MS independent of treatment, age and sex. Prospective studies are now required to discern whether methylation at MHC is involved in influencing risk of disease onset or whether the disease itself has altered the methylation profile.
Epigenetics may play a role in wheezing and asthma development. We aimed to examine infant saliva DNA methylation in association with early childhood wheezing.
A case-control study was nested within the NINFEA birth cohort with 68 cases matched to 68 controls by sex, age (between 6 and 18 months, median: 10.3 months) and season at saliva sampling. Using a bumphunting region-based approach, we examined associations between saliva methylome measured using Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450k array and wheezing between 6 and 18 months of age. We tested our main findings in independent publicly available data sets of childhood respiratory allergy and atopic asthma, with DNA methylation measured in different tissues and at different ages.
We identified one wheezing-associated differentially methylated region (DMR) spanning ten sequential CpG sites in the promoter-regulatory region of PM20D1 gene (family-wise error rate &lt; 0.05). The observed associations were enhanced in children born to atopic mothers. In the publicly available data sets, hypermethylation in the same region of PM20D1 was consistently found at different ages and in all analysed tissues (cord blood, blood, saliva and nasal epithelia) of children with respiratory allergy/atopic asthma compared with controls.
This study suggests that PM20D1 hypermethylation is associated with early childhood wheezing. Directionally consistent epigenetic alteration observed in cord blood and other tissues at older ages in children with respiratory allergy and atopic asthma provides suggestive evidence that a long-term epigenetic modification, likely operating from birth, may be involved in childhood atopic phenotypes.
N-Acyl amino acids directly bind mitochondria and function as endogenous uncouplers of UCP1-independent respiration. We found that administration of N-acyl amino acids to mice improves glucose homeostasis and increases energy expenditure, indicating that this pathway might be useful for treating obesity and associated disorders. We report the full account of the synthesis and mitochondrial uncoupling bioactivity of lipidated N-acyl amino acids and their unnatural analogues. Unsaturated fatty acid chains of medium length and neutral amino acid head groups are required for optimal uncoupling activity on mammalian cells. A class of unnatural N-acyl amino acid analogues, characterized by isoindoline-1-carboxylate head groups (37), were resistant to enzymatic degradation by PM20D1 and maintained uncoupling bioactivity in cells and in mice.
Pancreatic duct epithelial cells have been suggested as a source of progenitors for pancreatic growth and regeneration. However, genetic lineage-tracing experiments with pancreatic duct-specific Cre expression have given conflicting results. Using immunofluorescence and flow cytometry, we show heterogeneous expression of both HNF1β and SOX9 in adult human and murine ductal epithelium. Their expression was dynamic and diminished significantly after induced replication. Purified pancreatic duct cells formed organoid structures in 3D culture, and heterogeneity of expression of Hnf1β and Sox9 was maintained even after passaging. Using antibodies against a second cell surface molecule CD51 (human) or CD24 (mouse), we could isolate living subpopulations of duct cells enriched for high or low expression of HNF1β and SOX9. Only the CD24high (Hnfβhigh/Sox9high) subpopulation was able to form organoids.
Endometrial cancer is the most common gynecological cancer. Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) plays a critical role in tumor invasion and metastasis, which limits the success of treatment. Here, we investigated the roles of forkhead box A2 (FOXA2) and microRNA-200a (miR-200a) in regulating the EMT of endometrial cancer cells RL95-2. Empty vector or FOXA2 was stably transfected into RL95-2 cells. MTT assay measured cell proliferation, apoptosis assay measured apoptosis, Transwell invasion assay measured cell invasion, and Western blot measured the protein expression of FOXA2, E-cadherin, and vimentin. ChIP assay determined the binding of FOXA2 to E-cadherin promoter. For miR-200a analysis, the cells with stable FOXA2 expression were transfected with miR-negative control or miR-200a. Forced expression of FOXA2 decreased the proliferation and invasion, and increased the apoptosis of RL95-2 cells. FOXA2 also affected the EMT-associated proteins: FOXA2 increased the protein expression of E-cadherin and decreased the expression of vimentin. Moreover, FOXA2 positively regulated the promoter of E-cadherin in RL95-2 cells. Luciferase reporter assay identified FOXA2 as a target of miR-200a, which negatively regulated FOXA2. Western blot results showed that overexpression of miR-200a decreased the expression of E-cadherin but increased the expression of vimentin in the endometrial cancer cells by downregulating FOXA2 expression. FOXA2 may act as a tumor suppressor and inhibit EMT of endometrial cancer cells. FOXA2 expression is controlled by miR-200a, which promotes EMT of the endometrial cancer cells.
In 2020, 146,063 deaths due to pancreatic cancer are estimated to occur in Europe and the United States combined. To identify common susceptibility alleles, we performed the largest pancreatic cancer GWAS to date, including 9040 patients and 12,496 controls of European ancestry from the Pancreatic Cancer Cohort Consortium (PanScan) and the Pancreatic Cancer Case-Control Consortium (PanC4). Here, we find significant evidence of a novel association at rs78417682 (7p12/TNS3, P = 4.35 × 10-8). Replication of 10 promising signals in up to 2737 patients and 4752 controls from the PANcreatic Disease ReseArch (PANDoRA) consortium yields new genome-wide significant loci: rs13303010 at 1p36.33 (NOC2L, P = 8.36 × 10-14), rs2941471 at 8q21.11 (HNF4G, P = 6.60 × 10-10), rs4795218 at 17q12 (HNF1B, P = 1.32 × 10-8), and rs1517037 at 18q21.32 (GRP, P = 3.28 × 10-8). rs78417682 is not statistically significantly associated with pancreatic cancer in PANDoRA. Expression quantitative trait locus analysis in three independent pancreatic data sets provides molecular support of NOC2L as a pancreatic cancer susceptibility gene.
Maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) is a form of diabetes classically characterized as having autosomal dominant inheritance, onset before the age of 25 years in at least one family member and partly preserved pancreatic β-cell function. The 14 responsible genes are reported to be MODY type 1~14, of which MODY 2 and 3 might be the most common forms. Although MODY is currently classified as diabetes of a single gene defect, it has become clear that mutations in rare MODYs, such as MODY 5 and MODY 6, have small mutagenic effects and low penetrance. In addition, as there are differences in the clinical phenotypes caused by the same mutation even in the same family, other phenotypic modifying factors are thought to exist; MODY could well have characteristics of type 2 diabetes mellitus, which is of multifactorial origin. Here, we outline the effects of genetic and environmental factors on the known phenotypes of MODY, focusing mainly on the examples of MODY 5 and 6, which have low penetrance, as suggestive models for elucidating the multifactorial origin of type 2 diabetes mellitus.
Interleukin (IL)-1-type cytokines including IL-1α, IL-1β and interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra) are among the most potent molecules of the innate immune system and exert biological activities through the ubiquitously expressed interleukin-1 receptor type 1 (IL-1R1). The role of IL-1R1 in hepatocytes during acute liver failure (ALF) remains undetermined.
The role of IL-1R1 during ALF was investigated using a novel transgenic mouse model exhibiting deletion of all signaling-capable IL-1R isoforms in hepatocytes (Il1r1Hep-/-).
ALF induced by D-galactosamine (D-GalN) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was significantly attenuated in Il1r1Hep-/- mice leading to reduced mortality. Conditional deletion of Il1r1 decreased activation of injurious c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK)/c-Jun signaling, activated nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) p65, inhibited extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and prevented caspase 3-mediated apoptosis. Moreover, Il1r1Hep-/- mice exhibited reduced local and systemic inflammatory cytokine and chemokine levels, especially TNF-α, IL-1α/β, IL-6, CC-chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2), C-X-C motif ligand 1 (CXCL-1) and CXCL-2, and a reduced neutrophil recruitment into the hepatic tissue in response to injury. NLRP3 inflammasome expression and caspase 1 activation were suppressed in the absence of the hepatocellular IL-1R1. Inhibition of IL-1R1 using IL-1ra (anakinra) attenuated the severity of liver injury, while IL-1α administration exaggerated it. These effects were lost ex vivo and at later time points, supporting a role of IL-1R1 in inflammatory signal amplification during acute liver injury.
IL-1R1 in hepatocytes plays a pivotal role in an IL-1-driven auto-amplification of cell death and inflammation in the onset of ALF.
Acute liver injury which can cause lethal liver failure is medicated by a class of proteins called cytokines. Among these, interleukin-1 (IL-1) and the corresponding receptor IL-1R1 play a prominent role in the immune system, but their role in the liver is undetermined. In the current study, a novel mouse model with defective IL-1R1 in liver cells was studied. Mice lacking this receptor in liver cells were protected from cell death to a certain extent. This protection occurred only in the presence of other, neighboring cells, arguing for the involvement of proteins derived from these cells. This effect is called paracrine signaling and the current study has for the first time shown that the IL-1R1 receptor on hepatocytes is involved in acute liver failure in this context. The approved drug anakinra - which blocks IL-1R1 - had the same effect, supporting the proposed mechanism of action. The findings of this study suggest new treatment options for patients with acute liver failure by blocking defined signals of the immune system.
Hepatocytes are epithelial cells with highly specialized polarity. The disorder and loss of hepatocyte polarity leads to a weakness of cell adhesion and connection, the induction of epithelial-mesenchymal transition, and eventually the occurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Cluster of differentiation 147 (CD147), a tumor-related glycoprotein, promotes epithelial-mesenchymal transition and the invasion of HCC. However, the function of CD147 in hepatocyte depolarization is unknown. Here we identified that CD147 was basolaterally polarized in hepatocyte membrane of liver tissues and HepG2 cells. CD147 not only promoted transforming growth factor-β1-mediated hepatocyte polarity loss but also directly induced endocytosis and down-regulation of E-cadherin which contributed to hepatocyte depolarization. Overexpression of CD147 induced Src activation and subsequently recruited ubiquitin ligase Hakai for E-cadherin ubiquitination and lysosomal degradation, leading to decreases of partitioning defective 3 expression and β-catenin nuclear translocation. This signal transduction was initiated by competitive binding of CD147 with integrin β1 that interrupted the interaction between the Arg-Gly-Asp motif of fibronectin and integrin β1. The specific antibodies targeting integrin α5 and β1 reversed the decrease of E-cadherin and partitioning defective 3 levels induced by CD147 overexpression. In human liver tissues, CD147 polarity rates significantly declined from liver cirrhosis (71.4%) to HCC (10.4%). CD147-polarized localization negatively correlated with Child-Pugh scores in human liver cirrhosis (r = -0.6092, P &lt; 0.0001) and positively correlated with differentiation grades in HCC (r = 0.2060, P = 0.004). HCC patients with CD147-polarized localization had significantly better overall survival than patients with CD147 nonpolarity (P = 0.021).
The ectopic CD147-polarized distribution on basolateral membrane promotes hepatocyte depolarization by activation of the CD147-integrin α5β1-E-cadherin ubiquitination-partitioning defective 3 decrease and β-catenin translocation signaling cascade, replenishing a molecular pathway in hepatic carcinogenesis. (Hepatology 2018;68:317-332).
Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling plays an important role in the regulation of cellular lipid metabolism and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). However, little is known about the role of the regulatory subunits of PI3K in lipid metabolism and NAFLD. In this study, we characterized the functional role of PIK3R3 in fasting-induced hepatic lipid metabolism. In this study, we showed that the overexpression of PIK3R3 promoted hepatic fatty acid oxidation via PIK3R3-induced expression of PPARα, thus improving the fatty liver phenotype in high-fat diet (HFD)-induced mice. By contrast, hepatic PIK3R3 knockout in normal mice led to increased hepatic TG levels. Our study also showed that PIK3R3-induced expression of PPARα was dependent on HNF4α. The novel PIK3R3-HNF4α-PPARα signaling axis plays a significant role in hepatic lipid metabolism. As the activation of PIK3R3 decreased hepatosteatosis, PIK3R3 can be considered a promising novel target for developing NAFLD and metabolic syndrome therapies.
Persistent hypoglycemia in the newborn period most commonly occurs as a result of hyperinsulinism. The phenotype of hypoketotic hypoglycemia can also result from pituitary hormone deficiencies, including growth hormone and adrenocorticotropic hormone deficiency. Forkhead box A2 (Foxa2) is a transcription factor shown in mouse models to influence insulin secretion by pancreatic β cells. In addition, Foxa2 is involved in regulation of pituitary development, and deletions of FOXA2 have been linked to panhypopituitarism.
To describe an infant with congenital hyperinsulinism and hypopituitarism as a result of a mutation in FOXA2 and to determine the functional impact of the identified mutation.
Difference in wild-type (WT) vs mutant Foxa2 transactivation of target genes that are critical for β cell function (ABCC8, KNCJ11, HADH) and pituitary development (GLI2, NKX2-2, SHH).
Transactivation by mutant Foxa2 of all genes studied was substantially decreased compared with WT.
We report a mutation in FOXA2 leading to congenital hyperinsulinism and hypopituitarism and provide functional evidence of the molecular mechanism responsible for this phenotype.
Emerging evidence indicates that the long noncoding RNAs extensively participate in cancer progression. Nevertheless, the molecular pathogenesis of how these lncRNAs regulate tumorigenesis has not been fully elucidated especially in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Here, we sought to define the role of a novel lncRNA named lncRNA-NEF in modulating epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) in HCC. It was found that the lncRNA-NEF was transcriptionally activated by EMT suppressor FOXA2 and frequently downregulated in HCC cell lines as well as clinical specimens. Although enhanced expression of lncRNA-NEF did not affect tumor cell growth, ectopic expression of lncRNA-NEF significantly suppressed EMT program and cell migration. Animal studies validated that lncRNA-NEF alleviated in vivo tumor metastasis and protected mice from tumor-induced mortality. Interestingly, we verified that lncRNA-NEF acted as a novel activator of its neighbor gene FOXA2, which formed a positive feedback loop. Subsequent studies revealed that lncRNA-NEF physically interacted with β-catenin to increase the binding of GSK3β with β-catenin and therefore promoted the inhibitory phosphorylation of β-catenin, leading to the suppression on Wnt/β-catenin signaling and activation of FOXA2 expression. Hence, our findings illustrated a novel feedback loop including FOXA2 and its neighboring gene lncRNA-NEF, which might provide mechanistic insights into the metastatic progress of HCC.
Hepatocellular adenomas (HCAs) are rare benign monoclonal hepatic tumors that commonly occur in females (3-4 per 100,000 women) due to the use of oral contraceptives, its primary risk factor. Recently, HCAs have been classified into 4 distinct subtypes according to genotypic and phenotypic characteristics and clinical features: inflammatory HCA (40-50%), which are hypervascular with marked peliosis and a tendency to bleed; hepatocyte nuclear factor 1α (HNF1A)-mutated HCA (H-HCA, 30-40%) that are diffusely steatotic and rarely undergo malignant transformation; β-catenin activated HCA (10-15%), which frequently undergo malignant transformation and may seem hepatocellular carcinoma on imaging; and unclassified HCA (10-25%). In this study, we report the case of a 23-year-old female oral contraceptive user with H-HCA. Usually, H-HCA is considered to be nonsevere in most cases and often requires outpatient follow-up. However, in this case, the injury had substantially increased in volume and evolved with a major bleeding frame, which was an unusual finding for this subtype of adenoma. The therapeutic used for this patient was a laparoscopic left hepatic segmentectomy. Thus, the choice of treatment to be performed in a patient with H-HCA can depend on the tumor size (&gt;5 cm), the outcome of previous bleeding, and the risk of bleeding recurrence.
Inherited peroxisomal biogenesis disorders (PBDs) are characterized by the absence of functional peroxisomes. They are caused by mutations of peroxisomal biogenesis factors encoded by Pex genes, and result in childhood lethality. Owing to the many metabolic functions fulfilled by peroxisomes, PBD pathology is complex and incompletely understood. Besides accumulation of peroxisomal educts (like very-long-chain fatty acids [VLCFAs] or branched-chain fatty acids) and lack of products (like bile acids or plasmalogens), many peroxisomal defects lead to detrimental mitochondrial abnormalities for unknown reasons. We generated Pex19 Drosophila mutants, which recapitulate the hallmarks of PBDs, like absence of peroxisomes, reduced viability, neurodegeneration, mitochondrial abnormalities, and accumulation of VLCFAs. We present a model of hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 (Hnf4)-induced lipotoxicity and accumulation of free fatty acids as the cause for mitochondrial damage in consequence of peroxisome loss in Pex19 mutants. Hyperactive Hnf4 signaling leads to up-regulation of lipase 3 and enzymes for mitochondrial β-oxidation. This results in enhanced lipolysis, elevated concentrations of free fatty acids, maximal β-oxidation, and mitochondrial abnormalities. Increased acid lipase expression and accumulation of free fatty acids are also present in a Pex19-deficient patient skin fibroblast line, suggesting the conservation of key aspects of our findings.
The development of chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) technology has revolutionized the genetic analysis of the basic mechanisms underlying transcription regulation and led to accumulation of information about a huge amount of DNA sequences. There are a lot of web services which are currently available for de novo motif discovery in datasets containing information about DNA/protein binding. An enormous motif diversity makes their finding challenging. In order to avoid the difficulties, researchers use different stochastic approaches. Unfortunately, the efficiency of the motif discovery programs dramatically declines with the query set size increase. This leads to the fact that only a fraction of top "peak" ChIP-Seq segments can be analyzed or the area of analysis should be narrowed. Thus, the motif discovery in massive datasets remains a challenging issue. Argo_Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) web service is designed to process the massive DNA data. It is a program for the detection of degenerate oligonucleotide motifs of fixed length written in 15-letter IUPAC code. Argo_CUDA is a full-exhaustive approach based on the high-performance GPU technologies. Compared with the existing motif discovery web services, Argo_CUDA shows good prediction quality on simulated sets. The analysis of ChIP-Seq sequences revealed the motifs which correspond to known transcription factor binding sites.
Hepatocytes differentiated from human embryonic stem cells (ESCs) could provide a powerful tool for enabling cell-based therapies, studying the mechanisms underlying human liver development and disease, and testing the efficacy and safety of pharmaceuticals. However, currently most in vitro protocols yield hepatocytes with low levels of liver function. In this study, we investigated the potential of Salvianolic acid B (Sal B), an active pharmaceutical compound present in Salvia miltiorrhiza, which has been shown to have an antifibrotic effect in previous studies, to enhance hepatocyte differentiation from human ESCs. After treatment with Sal B, albumin expression and secretion were consistently increased, indicating that Sal B could promote hepatocyte differentiation process. Expression of a large number of important phase 1 and 2 metabolizing enzymes and phase 3 transporters was also increased in treated cells, indicating an enhanced biotransformation function. Our investigations further revealed the activation of Wnt pathway in treated cells, as determined by upregulation of Wnts, which increased amounts of nuclear β-catenin. This increased nuclear β-catenin led in turn to the enhanced expression of T cell factor (TCF) 3 and lymphoid enhancer-binding factor (LEF) 1 which upregulated their downstream targets, cyclin D1 and c-Myc. Notch receptors (Notch1, Notch3), Notch ligand (Jagged2), and Notch receptor targets [hairy and enhancer of split (Hes) 1, 5] were downregulated in treated cells, suggesting that Notch pathway was inhibited. Consistent with the inhibition of Notch pathway, expression of cholangiocyte marker, CK7, was significantly reduced by treatment with Sal B. Numb, a direct transcriptional target of Wnt pathway and a negative regulator of Notch pathway, was upregulated, consistent with activation of Wnt signaling and suppression of Notch signaling. In conclusion, our study demonstrated that Sal B enhanced hepatocyte differentiation from human ESCs through activation of Wnt pathway and inhibition of Notch pathway. Therefore, this study suggests that Sal B can be used as a potential agent to generate more mature hepatocytes for cell-based therapeutics and pharmaceutical studies.
Hepatocyte nuclear factor 1β (HNF1β) is a transcription factor that is involved in embryonic development and tissue-specific gene expression in several organs, including the kidney and the liver. HNF1β mutations are associated with hypomagnesemia and renal magnesium wasting; however, to date, the exact molecular mechanism involved in this regulation is unclear. Furthermore, it is not known whether the Mg concentration could per se participate to this regulation by modifying HNF1β expression. We have studied in rats the effects of a 6-week diet with deficient or supplemented Mg concentrations compared to a diet with a standard Mg concentration on HNF1β protein expression. HNF1β expression was increased in the Mg-deficient group as compared to the other groups in the liver but not in the kidney. No changes in tissue Mg level were obtained in both organs. By contrast, a significant correlation between plasma Mg concentration and HNF1β level in the rat liver was evidenced. In rat hepatocyte cultures exposed for 72h to various extracellular Mg concentrations, HNF1β expression was modified after 72h of treatment of the hepatocytes with the lowest Mg concentrations as compared to the other Mg conditions. Moreover, these changes were correlated with extracellular but not intracellular Mg concentrations. In conclusion, HNF1β expression is modified by the extracellular Mg concentration in the liver, both in vivo and in vitro, suggesting regulations with membrane events in hepatocytes.
Endometriosis is characterized by eutopic endometrial cell 'metastasis' to ectopic foci. FOXA2 is a member of the forkhead transcription factor family, which may participate in transcriptional regulation in endometrial cells and contribute to the aetiology of endometriosis. This study investigated the roles played by FOXA2 in eutopic endometrium using endometriosis samples. Western blotting showed that the relative expression of FOXA2 was significantly reduced in eutopic endometrium from patients with endometriosis (n = 14) compared with endometriosis-free controls (n = 16) (0.69 ± 0.07 versus 1.24 ± 0.06, P &lt; 0.05). To mimic eutopic endometrium of endometriosis, primary eutopic endometrial stromal cells (ESC) of controls were harvested and transfected with FOXA2 siRNA. MTT assay showed that cell viability of ESC with transfected FOXA2 siRNA increased significantly, whereas the apoptosis rate decreased as indicated by flow cytometry experiments (both P &lt; 0.05). Wound healing assays revealed that transfection of FOXA2 siRNA promoted ESC migration. Moreover, real-time PCR analysis showed progesterone-induced FOXA2 expression in ESC under physiological conditions. In conclusion, these findings indicate that FOXA2 might be a progesterone-induced gene, which may participate in the 'metastatic' process of eutopic endometrium to ectopic loci in patients with endometriosis.
To explore the effect of cigarette smoke (CS) on the development of squamous metaplasia in human airway epithelial cells and the role of MAPK- and FoxA2-signaling pathways in the process.
In an in vitro study, we treated the bronchial epithelial cell line BEAS2B with CS extract, followed by treatment with the ERK inhibitor U0126, the JNK inhibitor SP600125, or the p38 inhibitor SB203580. In vivo, we used a CS-induced rat model. After treatment with CS with or without MAPK inhibitors for 90 days, lung tissues were harvested. p-ERK, p-p38 and p-JNK protein levels in cells and lung tissue were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, mRNA- and protein-expression profiles of FoxA2, E-cadherin, CD44, and ZO1 were measured using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting, respectively, and morphological changes in bronchial epithelial cells were observed using lung-tissue staining.
In both the in vitro and in vivo studies, phosphorylation of the ERK1/2, JNK, and p38 proteins was significantly increased (P&lt;0.05) and mRNA and protein expression of E-cadherin and FoxA2 significantly decreased (P&lt;0.05) compared with the control group. ERK, JNK, and p38 inhibitors reversed the CS-extract-induced changes in E-cadherin, CD44, and ZO1 mRNA and protein expression (P&lt;0.05), decreased p-ERK, p-p38, and p-JNK protein levels in cells and lung tissue, suppressed bronchial epithelial hyperplasia and local squamous metaplasia, and decreased FoxA2 expression.
MAPK and FoxA2 mediate CS-induced squamous metaplasia. MAPK inhibitors upregulate FoxA2, resulting in a reduction in the degree of squamous metaplasia.
Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are regarded as the main cell type responsible for the initiation, metastasis, drug resistance, and recurrence of cancer. But the mechanism by which cancer stem cells maintain their stemness remains unclear.
In the present study, ovarian cancer stem cells (OCSCs) were revealed to have an enhanced autophagic flux. Furthermore, their chemoresistance and ability to self-renewal in vitro were decreased when autophagy was inhibited by Bafilomycin A1(BafA1), Chloroquine(CQ) or autophagy related 5(ATG5) knockdown. PCR array screening determined that Forkhead Box A2(FOXA2) was highly expressed in OCSCs, and correspondingly regulated by autophagy activity. In addition, the self-renewal ability was decreased in the case of FOXA2 knockdown by shRNA in OCSCs. Overexpression of FOXA2 from the pEGFP(+)-FOXA2 plasmid partially reversed the depressed self-renewal ability of OCSCs during autophagy inhibition.
Our findings suggest that autophagy, through participation of FOXA2, maintains the characteristics of OCSCs. Autophagy and FOXA2 are therefore potential targets for ovarian cancer stem cell directed therapies.
Lead-induced hepatotoxicity is characterized by an extensive oxidative stress. Grape seed procyanidin extract (GSPE) possesses abundant biological activities. Herein, we investigated the protective role of GSPE against lead-induced liver injury and determined the potential molecular mechanisms. In vivo, rats were treated with/without lead acetate (PbAc) (0.05%, w/v) in the presence/absence of GSPE (200 mg/kg). In vitro, hepatocytes were pretreated with/without GSPE (100 μg/ml) in the presence/absence of PbAc (100 μM). PbAc administration to rats resulted in anemia, liver dysfunction, lead accumulation in the bone and liver, oxidative stress, DNA damage and apoptosis. GSPE significantly attenuated these adverse effects, except lead accumulation in liver. GSPE also decreased the expression of miRNA153 and increased the translocation of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and levels of its downstream protein, and protein kinase B (AKT) phosphorylation in PbAc-induced liver injury. In primary hepatocytes treated with PbAc, GSPE increased hepatocyte viability and decreased lactate dehydrogenase release and reactive oxygen species levels. Dietary GSPE attenuated PbAc-induced liver injury in rats via an integrated mechanism associated with the miRNA153 and AKT/glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta/Fyn-mediated Nrf2 activation.
The hepatocyte nuclear factors (HNFs) namely HNF1α/β, FOXA1/2/3, HNF4α/γ and ONECUT1/2 are expressed in a variety of tissues and organs, including the liver, pancreas and kidney. The spatial and temporal manner of HNF expression regulates embryonic development and subsequently the development of multiple tissues during adulthood. Though the HNFs were initially identified individually based on their roles in the liver, numerous studies have now revealed that the HNFs cross-regulate one another and exhibit synergistic relationships in the regulation of tissue development and function. The complex HNF transcriptional regulatory networks have largely been elucidated in rodent models, but less so in human biological systems. Several heterozygous mutations in these HNFs were found to cause diseases in humans but not in rodents, suggesting clear species-specific differences in mutational mechanisms that remain to be uncovered. In this review, we compare and contrast the expression patterns of the HNFs, the HNF cross-regulatory networks and how these liver-enriched transcription factors serve multiple functions in the liver and beyond, extending our focus to the pancreas and kidney. We also summarise the insights gained from both human and rodent studies of mutations in several HNFs that are known to lead to different disease conditions.
Current in vitro islet differentiation protocols suffer from heterogeneity and low efficiency. Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) derived from pancreatic beta cells (BiPSCs) preferentially differentiate toward endocrine pancreas-like cells versus those from fibroblasts (FiPSCs). We interrogated genome-wide open chromatin in BiPSCs and FiPSCs via ATAC-seq and identified ∼8.3k significant, differential open chromatin sites (DOCS) between the two iPSC subtypes (false discovery rate [FDR] &lt; 0.05). DOCS where chromatin was more accessible in BiPSCs (Bi-DOCS) were significantly enriched for known regulators of endodermal development, including bivalent and weak enhancers, and FOXA2 binding sites (FDR &lt; 0.05). Bi-DOCS were associated with genes related to pancreas development and beta-cell function, including transcription factors mutated in monogenic diabetes (PDX1, NKX2-2, HNF1A; FDR &lt; 0.05). Moreover, Bi-DOCS correlated with enhanced gene expression in BiPSC-derived definitive endoderm and pancreatic progenitor cells. Bi-DOCS therefore highlight genes and pathways governing islet-lineage commitment, which can be exploited for differentiation protocol optimization, diabetes disease modeling, and therapeutic purposes.
Glucagon plays a major role in the regulation of glucose homeostasis during fed and fasting states. However, the mechanisms responsible for the regulation of pancreatic α cell mass and function are not completely understood. In the current study, we identified mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) as a major regulator of α cell mass and glucagon secretion. Using mice with tissue-specific deletion of the mTORC1 regulator Raptor in α cells (αRaptorKO), we showed that mTORC1 signaling is dispensable for α cell development, but essential for α cell maturation during the transition from a milk-based diet to a chow-based diet after weaning. Moreover, inhibition of mTORC1 signaling in αRaptorKO mice and in WT animals exposed to chronic rapamycin administration decreased glucagon content and glucagon secretion. In αRaptorKO mice, impaired glucagon secretion occurred in response to different secretagogues and was mediated by alterations in KATP channel subunit expression and activity. Additionally, our data identify the mTORC1/FoxA2 axis as a link between mTORC1 and transcriptional regulation of key genes responsible for α cell function. Thus, our results reveal a potential function of mTORC1 in nutrient-dependent regulation of glucagon secretion and identify a role for mTORC1 in controlling α cell-mass maintenance.
This study aimed to examine the anti-diabetic effect of germinated waxy black rice (GWBR) using streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats. In the diabetic rats, GWBR supplementation for 8 weeks reduced plasma blood glucose concentrations, improved glucose clearance and prevented diabetes-induced weight loss. Rats with STZ-induced diabetes who received GWBR supplementation exhibited decreased expression of sodium-dependent glucose transporter 1 (SGLT1) and glucose transporter (GLUT) 2 genes and proteins in the small intestine via decreases in hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF)-1α, HNF-1β, and HNF-4α, transcriptional factors that are involved in the regulation of SGLT1 and GLUT2, compared with the rats with STZ-induced diabetes that did not receive GWBR supplements. GWBR supplementation also enhanced the expression of GLUT4 and the genes and proteins involved in GLUT4 translocation, such as insulin receptor (IR) and insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1), and increased the phosphorylation of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and protein kinase B (PKB, Akt) proteins in skeletal muscle. GWBR further increased glycogen synthase (GS) 1 by decreasing glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)-3β in skeletal muscle. Interestingly, GWBR recovered STZ-impaired pancreatic β-cells, resulting in increased insulin synthesis and secretion. In addition, GWBR reduced serum triglyceride, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, aspartate transferase and alanine transferase concentrations and increased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations. Taken together, these findings suggest that GWBR could be a candidate for improving the diabetic condition by regulating glucose uptake in the intestine and muscle and regulating the secretion of insulin from the pancreas.
In multiple types of tumors, fibrotic collagen is regarded as the 'highway' for cancer cell migration, which is mainly modified by lysyl hydroxylase 2 (PLOD2). The previous findings have demonstrated that the expression of PLOD2 was regulated by multiple factors, including HIF-1α, TGF-β and microRNA-26a/b. Although PLOD2 was confirmed to be related to poor prognosis in lung adenocarcinoma, the regulatory mechanism and function of PLOD2 in human lung adenocarcinoma is poorly understood. On the other hand, upregulation or hyperactivation of epidermal growth factor receptor is considered as a prognostic marker in many cancers, especially in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In this study, we found that PLOD2 was elevated in NSCLC specimens and positively links to NSCLC poor prognosis. Gain- and loss-of-function studies and orthotopic implantation metastasis model pinpointed that PLOD2 promotes NSCLC metastasis directly by enhancing migration and indirectly by inducing collagen reorganization. In addition, we revealed that PLOD2 was regulated by PI3K/AKT-FOXA1 axis. The transcription factor FOXA1 directly bound to the PLOD2 promoter, and turned on PLOD2 transcription. In summary, our findings revealed a regulatory mechanism of NSCLC metastasis through EGFR-PI3K/AKT-FOXA1-PLOD2 pathway, and provided PLOD2 as a therapeutic target for NSCLC treatment.
Age is an independent risk factor of multiple organ failure in patients with sepsis. However, the age-related mechanisms of injury are not known. AMPK is a crucial regulator of energy homeostasis, which controls mitochondrial biogenesis by activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ coactivator-α (PGC-1α) and disposal of defective organelles by autophagy. We investigated whether AMPK dysregulation might contribute to age-dependent liver injury in young (2-3 mo) and mature male mice (11-13 mo) subjected to sepsis. Liver damage was higher in mature mice than in young mice and was associated with impairment of hepatocyte mitochondrial function, structure, and biogenesis and reduced autophagy. At molecular analysis, there was a time-dependent nuclear translocation of the active phosphorylated catalytic subunits AMPKα1/α2 and PGC-1α in young, but not in mature, mice after sepsis. Treatment with the AMPK activator 5-amino-4-imidazolecarboxamide riboside-1-β-d-ribofuranoside (AICAR) improved liver mitochondrial structure in both age groups compared with vehicle. In loss-of-function studies, young knockout mice with systemic deficiency of AMPKα1 exhibited greater liver injury than did wild-type mice after sepsis. Our study suggests that AMPK is important for liver metabolic recovery during sepsis. Although its function may diminish with age, pharmacological activation of AMPK may be of therapeutic benefit.-Inata, Y., Kikuchi, S., Samraj, R. S., Hake, P. W., O'Connor, M., Ledford, J. R., O'Connor, J., Lahni, P., Wolfe, V., Piraino, G., Zingarelli, B. Autophagy and mitochondrial biogenesis impairment contribute to age-dependent liver injury in experimental sepsis: dysregulation of AMP-activated protein kinase pathway.
Congenital hypopituitarism (CH) is characterized by the deficiency of one or more pituitary hormones and can present alone or in association with complex disorders. Congenital hyperinsulinism (CHI) is a disorder of unregulated insulin secretion despite hypoglycaemia that can occur in isolation or as part of a wider syndrome. Molecular diagnosis is unknown in many cases of CH and CHI. The underlying genetic etiology causing the complex phenotype of CH and CHI is unknown. In this study, we identified a de novo heterozygous mutation in the developmental transcription factor, forkhead box A2, FOXA2 (c.505T&gt;C, p.S169P) in a child with CHI and CH with craniofacial dysmorphic features, choroidal coloboma and endoderm-derived organ malformations in liver, lung and gastrointestinal tract by whole exome sequencing. The mutation is at a highly conserved residue within the DNA binding domain. We demonstrated strong expression of Foxa2 mRNA in the developing hypothalamus, pituitary, pancreas, lungs and oesophagus of mouse embryos using in situ hybridization. Expression profiling on human embryos by immunohistochemistry showed strong expression of hFOXA2 in the neural tube, third ventricle, diencephalon and pancreas. Transient transfection of HEK293T cells with Wt (Wild type) hFOXA2 or mutant hFOXA2 showed an impairment in transcriptional reporter activity by the mutant hFOXA2. Further analyses using western blot assays showed that the FOXA2 p.(S169P) variant is pathogenic resulting in lower expression levels when compared with Wt hFOXA2. Our results show, for the first time, the causative role of FOXA2 in a complex congenital syndrome with hypopituitarism, hyperinsulinism and endoderm-derived organ abnormalities.
Pancreatic β cell dysfunction and death are central in the pathogenesis of most if not all forms of diabetes. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying β cell failure is important to develop β cell protective approaches.
Here we review the role of endoplasmic reticulum stress and dysregulated endoplasmic reticulum stress signaling in β cell failure in monogenic and polygenic forms of diabetes. There is substantial evidence for the presence of endoplasmic reticulum stress in β cells in type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Direct evidence for the importance of this stress response is provided by an increasing number of monogenic forms of diabetes. In particular, mutations in the PERK branch of the unfolded protein response provide insight into its importance for human β cell function and survival. The knowledge gained from different rodent models is reviewed. More disease- and patient-relevant models, using human induced pluripotent stem cells differentiated into β cells, will further advance our understanding of pathogenic mechanisms. Finally, we review the therapeutic modulation of endoplasmic reticulum stress and signaling in β cells.
Pancreatic β cells are sensitive to excessive endoplasmic reticulum stress and dysregulated eIF2α phosphorylation, as indicated by transcriptome data, monogenic forms of diabetes and pharmacological studies. This should be taken into consideration when devising new therapeutic approaches for diabetes.
Uterine carcinosarcomas (UCSs) are a rare but clinically aggressive form of cancer. They are biphasic tumors consisting of both epithelial and sarcomatous components. The majority of uterine carcinosarcomas are clonal, with the carcinomatous cells undergoing metaplasia to give rise to the sarcomatous component. The objective of the current study was to identify novel somatically mutated genes in UCSs.
We whole exome sequenced paired tumor and nontumor DNAs from 14 UCSs and orthogonally validated 464 somatic variants using Sanger sequencing. Fifteen genes that were somatically mutated in at least 2 tumor exomes were Sanger sequenced in another 39 primary UCSs.
Overall, among 53 UCSs in the current study, the most frequently mutated of these 15 genes were tumor protein p53 (TP53) (75.5%), phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase catalytic subunit alpha (PIK3CA) (34.0%), protein phosphatase 2, regulatory subunit A, alpha (PPP2R1A) (18.9%), F-box and WD repeat domain containing 7 (FBXW7) (18.9%), chromodomain helicase DNA binding protein 4 (CHD4) (17.0%), and forkhead box A2 (FOXA2) (15.1%). FOXA2 has not previously been implicated in UCSs and was predominated by frameshift and nonsense mutations. One UCS with a FOXA2 frameshift mutation expressed truncated FOXA2 protein by immunoblotting. Sequencing of FOXA2 in 160 primary endometrial carcinomas revealed somatic mutations in 5.7% of serous, 22.7% of clear cell, 9% of endometrioid, and 11.1% of mixed endometrial carcinomas, the majority of which were frameshift mutations.
Collectively, the findings of the current study provide compelling genetic evidence that FOXA2 is a pathogenic driver gene in the etiology of primary uterine cancers, including UCSs. Cancer 2018;124:65-73. © 2017 American Cancer Society.
Successful pregnancy relies on dynamic control of cell signaling to achieve uterine receptivity and the necessary biological changes required for endometrial decidualization, embryo implantation, and fetal development. Glucocorticoids are master regulators of intracellular signaling and can directly regulate embryo implantation and endometrial remodeling during murine pregnancy. In immortalized human uterine cells, we have shown that glucocorticoids and estradiol (E2) coregulate thousands of genes. Recently, glucocorticoids and E2 were shown to coregulate the expression of Left-right determination factor 1 (LEFTY1), previously implicated in the regulation of decidualization. To elucidate the molecular mechanism by which glucocorticoids and E2 regulate the expression of LEFTY1, immortalized and primary human endometrial cells were evaluated for gene expression and receptor recruitment to regulatory regions of the LEFTY1 gene. Glucocorticoid administration induced expression of LEFTY1 messenger RNA and protein and recruitment of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and activated polymerase 2 to the promoter of LEFTY1. Glucocorticoid-mediated recruitment of GR was dependent on pioneer factors FOXA1 and FOXA2. E2 was found to antagonize glucocorticoid-mediated induction of LEFTY1 by reducing recruitment of GR, FOXA1, FOXA2, and activated polymerase 2 to the LEFTY1 promoter. Gene expression analysis identified several genes whose glucocorticoid-dependent induction required FOXA1 and FOXA2 in endometrial cells. These results suggest a molecular mechanism by which E2 antagonizes GR-dependent induction of specific genes by preventing the recruitment of the pioneer factors FOXA1 and FOXA2 in a physiologically relevant model.
Objective: Hepatocyte nuclear factor 1 homeobox b (HNF1B) -associated disease is an autosomal dominant inherited disorder with a variable, multi-systemic phenotype. In China, five adult probands and one child proband with HNF1B-associated disease had been reported, whereas few fetuses are described. The aims of this retrospective study were to understand about the clinical manifestations of HNF1B-associated disease and to further improve the recognition of this disorder. Method: Four patients (3 males, 1 female) and three fetuses with HNF1B mutations were included in this study. They were admitted to our hospital from January 2013 to March 2017. HNF1B mutations were detected using targeted next generation sequencing and quantitative real-time PCR or Sanger sequencing. HNF1B heterozygous deletion of exons 1-9 was found in 4 patients and 2 fetuses, and HNF1B heterozygous missense mutation in 1 fetus. These two mutations had been reported. Two patients and 1 fetus had de novo mutations. Results of renal ultrasonography with or without magnetic resonance imaging, biochemical investigations, urine routine examination and other necessary investigations in 7 cases were analyzed. Result: Three patients were Han Chinese ethnicity, and one patient was Mongolian. In patients 1 and 4, abnormal fetal kidneys were discovered by routine ultrasonography, and the age at first feature identified in Patients 2 and 3 were 13 years and 28 years. Patient 3 had normal renal function and the remainder had reduced glomerular filtration rate. In addition, patient 4 presented with nephrotic syndrome and glycosuria, patient 2 with early onset hyperparathyroidism and renal osteodystrophy, and patient 3 with diabetes mellitus. All the 4 patients had renal structural abnormalities including bilateral multiple renal cysts, dysplasia and hyperechogenic kidneys. Only patient 3 had a positive family history of renal diseases, the remainder had a negative family history of renal diseases. In 3 fetuses, prenatal ultrasound anomalies were detected during the second trimester. These 3 fetuses had hyperechogenic kidneys with or without renal cysts. Polyhydramnios was detected in only one of the 3 fetuses. Two of the 3 fetuses had a positive family history of renal diseases. Conclusion: Clinical phenotypes of HNF1B-related disease are heterogeneous, renal malformations clearly appear to be the most common manifestation, multiple renal cysts are characteristic, and patients can progress to impaired kidney function during childhood; HNF1B mutation is a differential diagnosis of fetal hyperechogenic kidneys or multiple renal cysts.
目的： 了解HNF1B基因相关疾病临床表型。 方法： 选择2013至2017年在北京大学第一医院儿科和妇产科住院、门诊就诊的不明原因肾功能减退的4例患者(例1、2、4为男性患儿，例3为成年女性患者)，胎儿期肾脏超声异常的胎儿3例，经目标区域捕获二代测序、实时定量PCR或Sanger测序验证检测到HNF1B基因突变。以其为研究对象，回顾性分析其肾脏影像、血生化、尿液常规和其他必要检查结果。 结果： 4例患者中，例1和例4自胎儿期起病，例2和例3分别于13岁和28岁起病；除例3外，其余3例患者均有不同程度的肾功能减退；例4尚表现有肾病综合征和糖尿，例2尚表现有早发的甲状旁腺功能亢进和肾性骨病，例3尚有糖尿病；仅例3有肾脏病家族史，其余3例患者均无肾脏病家族史；4例患者均有肾脏结构异常，包括双肾多发囊肿、肾脏小和肾脏高回声。3例胎儿均经产前超声检查发现肾脏高回声，伴或不伴肾脏囊肿；仅1例胎儿羊水过多；2例胎儿有肾脏病家族史。 结论： HNF1B基因相关疾病临床表型存在异质性，肾脏受累最为常见，多表现为肾脏囊肿，儿童期会出现肾功能减退；胎儿期肾脏超声显示肾脏高回声或肾脏囊肿者应想到HNF1B基因相关疾病的可能。.
Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) covers a spectrum from simple steatosis to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and cirrhosis. Free fatty acids (FFA) induce steatosis and lipo-toxicity and correlate with severity of NAFLD. In this study we aimed to investigate the role of exogenous and endogenous ALR (augmenter of liver regeneration) for FFA induced ER (endoplasmatic reticulum) -stress and lipoapoptosis. Primary human hepatocytes or hepatoma cells either treated with recombinant human ALR (rhALR, 15kDa) or expressing short form ALR (sfALR, 15kDa) were incubated with palmitic acid (PA) and analyzed for lipo-toxicity, -apoptosis, activation of ER-stress response pathways, triacylglycerides (TAG), mRNA and protein expression of lipid metabolizing genes. Both, exogenous rhALR and cytosolic sfALR reduced PA induced caspase 3 activity and Bax protein expression and therefore lipotoxicity. Endogenous sfALR but not rhALR treatment lowered TAG levels, diminished activation of ER-stress mediators C-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), X-box binding protein-1 (XBP1) and proapoptotic transcription factor C/EBP-homologous protein (CHOP), and reduced death receptor 5 protein expression. Cellular ALR exerts its lipid lowering and anti-apoptotic actions by enhancing FABP1, which binds toxic FFA, increasing mitochondrial β-oxidation by elevating the mitochondrial FFA transporter CPT1α, and decreasing ELOVL6, which delivers toxic FFA metabolites. We found reduced hepatic mRNA levels of ALR in a high fat diet mouse model, and of ALR and FOXA2, a transcription factor inducing ALR expression, in human steatotic as well as NASH liver samples, which may explain increased lipid deposition and reduced β-oxidation in NASH patients. Present study shows that exogenous and endogenous ALR reduce PA induced lipoapoptosis. Furthermore, cytosolic sfALR changes mRNA and protein expression of genes regulating lipid metabolism, reduces ER-stress finally impeding progression of NASH.
Direct reprogramming of other somatic cells into neurons is an alternative strategy for the recovery of an injured nervous system. In this work, we developed a new non-viral gene carrier based on Porphyra yezoensis polysaccharide (PYP). After modification with ethylenediamine, the cationized PYP (Ed-PYP) was combined with plasmids encoding Ascl1, Brn2 and FoxA1 to form spherical nanoscale particles (Ed-PYP-pABF nanoparticles). Cytotoxicity assays proved that Ed-PYP-pABF nanoparticles had a better safety profile than Lipofectamine 2000 and polyetherimide. Characterization tests illustrated that the Ed-PYP-pABF nanoparticles at an Ed-PYP:pABF weight ratio of 40:1 is a potential candidate for gene delivery, which was further supported by Western blot and plasmid encoding enhanced green fluorescence protein transfection. Based on this transfection strategy, we co-delivered pABF to 3T6 cells using Ed-PYP. ELISA indicated that the levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor, nerve growth factors and sonic hedgehog reached a maximum at 14 days after the last transfection. Immunofluorescence and Western blot further exhibited positive expression of neurofilament 200, Nestin, glial fibrillary acidic protein, growth associated protein-43, β-3tubulin, and microtubule associated protein 2, proving the successful conversion of 3T6 cells into neurons. Taken together, these results illustrated that a natural polysaccharide-based gene co-delivery system is a promising strategy for neural reprogramming.
The vascular endothelium is critical for induction of appropriate lineage differentiation in organogenesis. In this study, we report that dysfunctional pulmonary endothelium, resulting from the loss of matrix Gla protein (MGP), causes ectopic hepatic differentiation in the pulmonary epithelium. We demonstrate uncontrolled induction of the hepatic growth factor (HGF) caused by dysregulated cross talk between pulmonary endothelium and epithelium in Mgp-null lungs. Elevated HGF induced hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 α (Hnf4a), which competed with NK2 homeobox 1 (Nkx2.1) for binding to forkhead box A2 (Foxa2) to drive hepatic differentiation in Mgp-null airway progenitor cells. Limiting endothelial HGF reduced Hnf4a, abolished interference of Hnf4a with Foxa2, and reduced hepatic differentiation in Mgp-null lungs. Together, our results suggest that endothelial-epithelial interactions, maintained by MGP, are essential in pulmonary cell differentiation.
Bronchial epithelial goblet cell metaplasia (GCM) with hyperplasia is a prominent feature of asthma, but the effects of treatment with corticosteroids alone or in combination with a long-acting β2 -adrenergic receptor agonist (LABA) on GCM in the bronchial epithelium are unknown.
To determine whether corticosteroid alone or in combination with a LABA alters protein and gene expression pathways associated with IL-13-induced goblet cell metaplasia.
We evaluated the effects of fluticasone propionate (FP) and of salmeterol (SM), on the response of well-differentiated cultured bronchial epithelial cells to interleukin-13 (IL-13). Outcome measures included gene expression of SPDEF/FOXa2, gene expression and protein production of MUC5AC/MUC5B and morphologic appearance of cultured epithelial cell sheets. We additionally analysed expression of these genes in bronchial epithelial brushings from healthy, steroid-naïve asthmatic and steroid-treated asthmatic subjects. In cultured airway epithelial cells, FP treatment inhibited IL-13-induced suppression of FOXa2 gene expression and up-regulation of SPDEF, alterations in gene and protein measures of MUC5AC and MUC5B and induction of GCM. The addition of SM synergistically modified the effects of FP modestly-only for gel-forming mucin MUC5AC. In bronchial epithelial cells recovered from asthmatic vs healthy human subjects, we found FOXa2 and MUC5B gene expression to be reduced and SPDEF and MUC5AC gene expression to be increased; these alterations were not observed in bronchial epithelial cells recovered after treatment with inhaled corticosteroids.
Corticosteroid treatment inhibits IL-13-induced GCM of the airways in asthma, possibly through its effects on SPDEF and FOXa2 regulation of mucin gene expression. These effects are modestly augmented by the addition of a long-acting ß-agonist. As we found evidence for drug treatment counteracting the effects of IL-13 on the epithelium, we conclude that further exploration into the mechanisms by which corticosteroids and long-acting β2 -adrenergic agonists confer protection against pathologic airway changes is warranted.
β3-adrenergic receptor (β3-AR) was shown to upregulate hepatic apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I) expression and reverse atherosclerotic plaques in vivo experiments. However, the effect of β3-AR on apoA-I expression in vitro is unknown. The specific mechanism underlying β3-AR prevention of atherosclerosis is unclear.
The present study was designed to investigate the molecular mechanism of β3-AR-mediated regulation of hepatic apoA-I gene expression.
HepG2 cells were preincubated with/without a selective protein kinase A inhibitor (H-89) and then treated with a selective β3-AR agonist (BRL37344) or antagonist (SR59230A). The hepatic apoA-I expression was detected by reverse transcription real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction and Western blot analysis. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to evaluate the secretion of apoA-I. A recombinant plasmid containing the apoA-I promoter was constructed and transiently transfected into HepG2 cells, and dual-luciferase reporter assays were used to examine the activity of the apoA-I promoter. A chromatin immunoprecipitation polymerase chain reaction assay was used to evaluate binding activities of hepatocyte nuclear factor-4 (HNF-4), HNF-3, and early growth response protein-1.
β3-AR activation significantly upregulated apoA-I expression, promoted apoA-I secretion, and enhanced the activities of the apoA-I promoter, HNF-4, and HNF-3 in hepatocytes, whereas early growth response protein-1 was not affected. Moreover, protein kinase A inhibition partially suppressed the activation of the apoA-I promoter, HNF-4, and HNF-3 and almost completely blocked the upregulation of apoA-I expression induced by β3-AR.
β3-AR activation increased the activities of the apoA-I promoter, HNF-4, and HNF-3, which might account for the mechanism of β3-AR-mediated upregulation of hepatic apoA-I expression. β3-AR might exert an anti-atherosclerotic effect by upregulating hepatic apoA-I expression and promoting the cholesterol reverse transport process.
Somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT)-mediated reprogramming is a rapid, efficient, and sophisticated process that reprograms differentiated somatic cells to a pluripotent state. However, many factors in this elaborate reprogramming process remain largely unknown. Here, we report that the microRNA (miR) miR-125b is an important component of SCNT-mediated reprogramming. Luciferase reporter assay, quantitative PCR, and Western blotting demonstrated that miR-125b directly binds the 3'-untranslated region of SUV39H1, encoding the histone-lysine N-methyltransferase SUV39H1, to down-regulate histone H3 lysine-9 tri-methylation (H3K9me3) in SCNT embryos. Furthermore, the miR-125b/SUV39H1 interaction induced loss of SUV39H1-mediated H3K9me3, caused heterochromatin relaxation, and promoted the development of SCNT embryos. Transcriptome analyses of SCNT blastomeres indicated that HNF1 homeobox B (HNF1B), a gene encoding a transcription factor downstream of and controlled by the miR-125b/SUV39H1 axis, is important for conferring developmental competence on preimplantation embryos. We conclude that miR-125b promotes SCNT-mediated nuclear reprogramming by targeting SUV39H1 to decrease the deposition of repressive H3K9me3 modifications.
Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP)-producing adenocarcinoma is a high-malignant variant of adenocarcinoma with a hepatic or fetal-intestinal phenotype. The number of cases of AFP-producing adenocarcinomas is increasing, but the molecular mechanism underlying the aberrant production of AFP is unclear. Here we sought to assess the role of Forkhead box A (FoxA)2, which is a pioneer transcription factor in the differentiation of hepatoblasts. FoxA2 expression was investigated in five cases of AFP-producing gastric adenocarcinomas by immunohistochemistry, and all cases showed FoxA2 expression. Chromatin immunoprecipitation revealed the DNA binding of FoxA2 on the regulatory element of AFP gene in AFP-producing adenocarcinoma cells. The inhibition of FoxA2 expression with siRNA reduced the mRNA expression of liver-specific proteins, including AFP, albumin, and transferrin. The inhibition of FoxA2 also reduced the expressions of liver-enriched nuclear factors, i.e., hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF) 4α and HNF6, although the expressions of HNF1α and HNF1β were not affected. The same effect as FoxA2 knockdown in AFP producing adenocarcinoma cells was also observed in hepatocellular carcinoma cells. Our results suggest that FoxA2 plays a key role in the expression of hepatic phenotype of AFP-producing adenocarcinomas.
AKI is a frequent condition that involves renal microcirculation impairment, infiltration of inflammatory cells with local production of proinflammatory cytokines, and subsequent epithelial disorders and mitochondrial dysfunction. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator 1-α (PPARGC1A), a coactivator of the transcription factor PPAR-γ that controls mitochondrial biogenesis and function, has a pivotal role in the early dysfunction of the proximal tubule and the subsequent renal repair. Here, we evaluated the potential role of hepatocyte nuclear factor-1β (HNF-1β) in regulating PPARGC1A expression in AKI. In mice, endotoxin injection to induce AKI also induced early and transient inflammation and PPARGC1A inhibition, which overlapped with downregulation of the HNF-1β transcriptional network. In vitro, exposure of proximal tubule cells to the inflammatory cytokines IFN-γ and TNF-α led to inhibition of HNF-1β transcriptional activity. Moreover, inhibition of HNF-1β significantly reduced PPARGC1A expression and altered mitochondrial morphology and respiration in proximal tubule cells. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays and PCR analysis confirmed HNF-1β binding to the Ppargc1a promoter in mouse kidneys. We also demonstrated downregulation of renal PPARGC1A expression in a patient with an HNF1B germinal mutation. Thus, we propose that HNF-1β links extracellular inflammatory signals to mitochondrial dysfunction during AKI partly via PPARGC1A signaling. Our findings further strengthen the view of HNF1B-related nephropathy as a mitochondrial disorder in adulthood.
Hepatocellular adenomas (HCA) are rare benign liver tumors occurring in young women taking contraception. They are associated with rare complications such as bleeding or malignant transformation into hepatocellular carcinoma. A molecular classification has divided HCA in several subgroups linked with risk factors, clinical behaviour, histological features and imaging: HNF1A inactivated HCA, Inflammatory HCA, CTNNB1 mutated HCA in exon 3, CTNNB1 mutated in exon 7 and 8 HCA, sonic hedgehog HCA and unclassified HCA. CTNNB1 mutated HCA in exon 3 and sonic hedgehog HCA have been linked with a high risk of malignant transformation and bleeding respectively. Herein, we review how molecular classification has modified our understanding of the pathophysiology and risk factors of HCA development, analysing its impact on clinical care in the field of diagnosis and therapeutic stratification.
Type 2-associated goblet cell hyperplasia and mucus hypersecretion are well known features of asthma. 15-Lipoxygenase-1 (15LO1) is induced by the type 2 cytokine IL-13 in human airway epithelial cells (HAECs) in vitro and is increased in fresh asthmatic HAECs ex vivo. 15LO1 generates a variety of products, including 15-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (15-HETE), 15-HETE-phosphatidylethanolamine (15-HETE-PE), and 13-hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid (13-HODE). In this study, we investigated the 15LO1 metabolite profile at baseline and after IL-13 treatment, as well as its influence on goblet cell differentiation in HAECs. Primary HAECs obtained from bronchial brushings of asthmatic and healthy subjects were cultured under air-liquid interface culture supplemented with arachidonic acid and linoleic acid (10 μM each) and exposed to IL-13 for 7 days. Short interfering RNA transfection and 15LO1 inhibition were applied to suppress 15LO1 expression and activity. IL-13 stimulation induced expression of 15LO1 and preferentially generated 15-HETE-PE in vitro, both of which persisted after removal of IL-13. 15LO1 inhibition (by short interfering RNA and chemical inhibitor) decreased IL-13-induced forkhead box protein A3 (FOXA3) expression and enhanced FOXA2 expression. These changes were associated with reductions in both mucin 5AC and periostin. Exogenous 15-HETE-PE stimulation (alone) recapitulated IL-13-induced FOXA3, mucin 5AC, and periostin expression. The results of this study confirm the central importance of 15LO1 and its primary product, 15-HETE-PE, for epithelial cell remodeling in HAECs.
Generation of functional dopamine (DA) neurons is an essential step for the development of effective cell therapy for Parkinson's disease (PD). The generation of DA neurons can be accomplished by overexpression of DA-inducible genes using virus- or DNA-based gene delivery methods. However, these gene delivery methods often cause chromosomal anomalies. In contrast, mRNA-based gene delivery avoids this problem and therefore is considered safe to use in the development of cell-based therapy. Thus, we used mRNA-based gene delivery method to generate safe DA neurons. In this study, we generated transformation-free DA neurons by transfection of mRNA encoding DA-inducible genes Nurr1 and FoxA2. The delivery of mRNA encoding dopaminergic fate inducing genes proved sufficient to induce naive rat forebrain precursor cells to differentiate into neurons exhibiting the biochemical, electrophysiological, and functional properties of DA neurons in vitro. Additionally, the generation efficiency of DA neurons was improved by the addition of small molecules, db-cAMP, and the adjustment of transfection timing. The successful generation of DA neurons using an mRNA-based method offers the possibility of developing clinical-grade cell sources for neuronal cell replacement treatment for PD.
The application of stem cells holds great promises in cell and tissue transplants. This study was designed to compare the hepatogenic differentiation of iPSCs on aligned PES/COL versus random. Aligned and random PES/COL nanofibrus scaffolds were fabricated by electrospining and their surface modified through plasma treatment and collagen coating. The scaffolds were characterized using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and ATR-FTIR. Morphology and biochemical activities of the differentiated hepatocyte-like cells (HLCs) were examined after 5 and 20 days of differentiation. Real-Time RT-PCR and ICC showed no significant difference in the mRNA and protein levels of two important definitive endoderm specific markers, including Sox17 and Foxa2 between two scaffolds. However, Real-Time RT-PCR analysis indicated an increase in the expression of Cyp7A1 gene over the period of the differentiation procedure on the aligned nanofibers but there was no difference in other genes such as Albumin and CK19. Moreover, comparison of hepatogenic differentiation evaluated by Albumin production in conditioned media of HLCs differentiated on aligned PES/COL, showed increase expression of these markers after 20 days compared to that of the random nanofibers. Taken together, the results of this study may indicate that aligned PES/COL nanofibrous scaffolds can improve terminal differentiation of HLCs from iPSCs.
Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified more than 100 genetic loci associated with type 2 diabetes (T2D). However, the underlying biological mechanisms for many of these associations remain unknown. GWAS signals close to the glucokinase regulatory protein gene (GCKR) have been reported for lipid and glucose metabolism traits and the risk of T2D. We investigated the regulatory function of an intronic locus at GCKR represented by the lead single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs780094.
We used ENCODE project histone modification and transcription factor binding data to determine the regulatory features of a GCKR intronic locus formed by the high linkage disequilibrium rs780094(C/T), rs780095(G/A), and rs780096(G/C) SNPs. Characterization of the transcriptional activity of this region was assessed by luciferase reporter assays in HepG2 cells and mouse primary hepatocytes. ChIP-qPCR was used to determine the levels of haplotype specific transcription factor binding and histone marks. A CRISPR-dCas9 transcriptional activator system and qPCR were used to activate the locus and measure GCKR expression, respectively. Differential haplotype expression was measured from human liver biopsies.
The ENCODE data suggest the existence of a liver-specific intragenic enhancer at the locus represented by s780094. We observed that FOXA2 increased the transcriptional activity of this region in a haplotype specific way (CGG &gt; TAC; rs780094, rs780095, and rs780096). In addition, the CGG haplotype showed higher binding to FOXA2 and higher levels of the H3K27Ac histone mark. The epigenetic activation of this locus increased the expression of endogenous GCKR in HepG2 cells, confirming that GCKR is the direct target gene of the enhancer. Finally, we confirmed that the CGG haplotype exhibits higher levels of transcription in human liver.
Our results demonstrate the existence of a liver-specific FOXA2-regulated transcriptional enhancer at an intronic T2D locus represented by rs780094, rs780095, and rs780096 SNPs that increases GCKR expression. Differential haplotype regulation suggests the existence of cis regulatory effects that may contribute to the associated traits at this locus.
Only a few families with neuronal differentiation 1 (NEUROD1)-deficient diabetes, currently designated as maturity-onset diabetes of the young 6 (MODY6), have been reported, but mostly in Caucasian, and no mutation has been identified by family-based screening in Japanese. Accordingly, the phenotypic details of the disease remain to be elucidated.
We examined a total of 275 subjects having diabetes suspected to be MODY who were negative for mutations in MODY1-5 referred from 155 medical institutions throughout Japan. So as not to miss low penetrant cases, we examined non-obese Japanese patients with early-onset diabetes regardless of the presence of family history by direct sequencing of all exons and flanking regions of NEUROD1 . Large genomic rearrangements also were examined.
Four patients with 3 frameshift mutations and 1 missense mutation, all of which were heterozygous and 3 of which were novel, were identified. Diabetic ketosis was found occasionally in these patients even under conditions of chronic hyperglycemia, for unknown reasons. Although the capacity of early-phase insulin secretion was low in these patients, the insulin secretory capacity was relatively preserved compared to that in hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF)1A- and HNF1B-MODY. One of the patients and 2 of their diabetic mothers were found to have some mental or neuronal abnormality.
This is the first report of NEUROD1 mutations in Japanese, who have a genetic background of intrinsically lower capacity of insulin secretion. NEUROD1-deficient diabetes appears to be low penetrant, and may occur in concert with other genetic factors.
The root of Polygonum multiflorum Thunb (PM) has been used in China to treat a variety of diseases, such as constipation, early graying of the hair and hyperlipemia. Recent evidence shows that PM causes idiosyncratic drug-induced liver injury (IDILI) in humans. In this study, we investigated the molecular basis of PM-induced liver injury in a rat model of IDILI based on a non-hepatotoxic dose of LPS. SD rats were orally administered 3 potentially hepatotoxic compounds of PM: cis-stilbene glucoside (cis-SG, 50 mg/kg), trans-SG (50 mg/kg) or emodin (5 mg/kg), followed by injection of LPS (2.8 mg/kg, iv). Serum and liver histology were evaluated 7 h after LPS injection. Among the 3 compounds tested, cis-SG, but not emodin or trans-SG, induced severe liver injury in rats when combined with LPS. The levels of AST and ALT in plasma and inflammatory cytokines in both plasma and liver tissues were markedly elevated. The liver tissues showed increased injury, hepatocyte apoptosis, and macrophage infiltration, and decreased cell proliferation. Microarray analysis revealed a negative correlation between peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPAR-γ) and LPS/cis-SG-induced liver injury. Immunohistochemical staining and RT-PCR results further confirmed that cis-SG significantly inhibited activation of the PPAR-γ pathway in the liver tissues of LPS/cis-SG-treated rats. Pre-treatment with a PPAR-γ agonist pioglitazone (500 g/kg, ig) reversed LPS/cis-SG-induced liver injury, which was associated with inhibiting the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) pathway. These data demonstrate that cis-stilbene glucoside induces immunological idiosyncratic hepatotoxicity through suppressing PPAR-γ in a rat model of IDILI.
In recent years there has been a reclassification of hereditary tubulointerstitial renal diseases. The old concepts of nephronoptisis or medullary cystic disease have been reordered based on the discovery of new genes. The 2015 KDIGO guidelines proposed a unification of terminology, diagnostic criteria and monitoring. So far 4genes causing autosomal dominant tubulointerstitial kidney disease have been described: MUC1, UMOD, HNF1B and REN. Although the mutation in each of them causes distinctive features in how they present, all have in common the progressive tubulointerstitial damage and renal fibrosis. In this article, we present a review of the guidelines and the literature, and some practical recommendations for dealing with this disease.
Osteoblast differentiation is a multistep process delicately regulated by many factors, including cytoskeletal dynamics and signaling pathways. Microtubule actin crosslinking factor 1 (MACF1), a key cytoskeletal linker, has been shown to play key roles in signal transduction and in diverse cellular processes; however, its role in regulating osteoblast differentiation is still needed to be elucidated. To further uncover the functions and mechanisms of action of MACF1 in osteoblast differentiation, we examined effects of MACF1 knockdown (MACF1-KD) in MC3T3-E1 osteoblastic cells on their osteoblast differentiation and associated molecular mechanisms. The results showed that knockdown of MACF1 significantly suppressed mineralization of MC3T3-E1 cells, down-regulated the expression of key osteogenic genes alkaline phosphatase (ALP), runt-related transcription factor 2 (Runx2) and type I collagen α1 (Col Iα1). Knockdown of MACF1 dramatically reduced the nuclear translocation of β-catenin, decreased the transcriptional activation of T cell factor 1 (TCF1), and down-regulated the expression of TCF1, lymphoid enhancer-binding factor 1 (LEF1), and Runx2, a target gene of β-catenin/TCF1. In addition, MACF1-KD increased the active level of glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β), which is a key regulator for β-catenin signal transduction. Moreover, the reduction of nuclear β-catenin amount and decreased expression of TCF1 and Runx2 were significantly reversed in MACF1-KD cells when treated with lithium chloride, an agonist for β-catenin by inhibiting GSK-3β activity. Taken together, these findings suggest that knockdown of MACF1 in osteoblastic cells inhibits osteoblast differentiation through suppressing the β-catenin/TCF1-Runx2 axis. Thus, a novel role of MACF1 in and a new mechanistic insight of osteoblast differentiation are uncovered.
The median survival of patients with small cell neuroendocrine carcinoma is significantly shorter than that of patients with classic acinar-type adenocarcinoma. Small cell neuroendocrine carcinoma is traditionally diagnosed based on histologic features because expression of current immunohistochemical markers is inconsistent. This is a challenging diagnosis even for expert pathologists and particularly so for pathologists who do not specialize in prostate cancer. New biomarkers to aid in the diagnosis of small cell neuroendocrine carcinoma are therefore urgently needed. We discovered that FOXA2, a pioneer transcription factor, is frequently and specifically expressed in small cell neuroendocrine carcinoma compared with prostate adenocarcinoma from published mRNA-sequencing data of a wide range of human prostate cancers. We verified the expression of FOXA2 in human prostate cancer cell lines and xenografts, patient biopsy specimens, tissue microarrays of prostate cancers with lymph node metastasis, primary small cell neuroendocrine carcinoma, and metastatic treatment-related small cell neuroendocrine carcinoma and cases from a rapid autopsy program. FOXA2 expression was present in NCI-H660 and PC3 neuroendocrine cell lines, but not in LNCAP and CWR22 adenocarcinoma cell lines. Of the human prostate cancer specimens, 20 of 235 specimens (8.5%) showed diagnostic histologic features of small cell neuroendocrine carcinoma as judged histologically. Fifteen of 20 small cell neuroendocrine carcinoma tissues (75%) showed strong expression of FOXA2 (staining intensity 2 or 3). FOXA2 expression was also detected in 9 of 215 prostate cancer tissues (4.2%) that were histologically defined as adenocarcinoma. Our findings demonstrate that FOXA2 is a sensitive and specific molecular marker that may be extremely valuable in the pathologic diagnosis of small cell neuroendocrine carcinoma.
Mutations in causative genes for neonatal diabetes or maturity-onset diabetes of the young have been identified in multiple patients with autoantibody-negative type 1 diabetes (T1D).
We aimed to clarify the prevalence and phenotypic characteristics of monogenic abnormalities among 89 children with autoantibody-negative insulin-requiring T1D.
Mutations in 30 genes were screened using next-generation sequencing, and copy-number alterations of 4 major causative genes were examined using multiplex-ligation-dependent probe amplification. We compared the clinical characteristics between mutation carriers and non-carriers.
We identified 11 probable pathogenic substitutions (6 in INS , 2 in HNF1A , 2 in HNF4A , and 1 in HNF1B ) in 11 cases, but no copy-number abnormalities. Only 2 mutation carriers had affected parents. De novo occurrence was confirmed for 3 mutations. The non-carrier group, but not the carrier group, was enriched with susceptible HLA alleles. Mutation carriers exhibited comparable phenotypes to those of non-carriers, except for a relatively normal body mass index (BMI) at diagnosis.
This study demonstrated significant genetic overlap between autoantibody-negative T1D and monogenic diabetes. Mutations in INS and HNF genes, but not those in GCK and other monogenic diabetes genes, likely play critical roles in children with insulin-requiring T1D. This study also suggests the relatively high de novo rates of INS and HNF mutations, and the etiological link between autoimmune abnormalities and T1D in the non-carrier group. Carriers of monogenic mutations show non-specific phenotypes among all T1D cases, although they are more likely to have a normal BMI at diagnosis than non-carriers.
Dyslipidemia during pregnancy increases the risk of complications of pregnancy. Lipid profiles have a strong genetic determinant and numerous susceptibility loci have been identified. However, very few studies have focused on the association of lipid-related loci and maternal serum lipids during pregnancy. For the first time, we investigated the association of common variants in three maturity onset diabetes of the young (MODY) genes (HNF1A, HNF4A and HNF1B) with serum lipid concentrations and glucose metabolism related quantitative traits in the second trimester of pregnancy.
A total of 1797 unrelated Han Chinese pregnant women were included. Three variants in 3'-UTR were selected and genotyped using TaqMan allelic discrimination assays. Multiple linear regression adjusted for age and body mass index was applied for analysis.
We found that T allele of rs1169309 in MODY3-HNF1A gene was significantly associated with increased levels of total cholesterol [β = 0.123 (0.057-0.189); p = 2.7 × 10-4 ] and LDL-C [β = 0.075 (0.018-0.132); p = 1.0 × 10-2 ]. Rs1169309-TT genotype carriers exhibited with higher levels of apolipoprotein A1 (p = 4.2 × 10-2 ) and ApoB (p = 6.0 × 10-3 ). In addition, correlations between minor C allele of HNF1B-rs2688 and decreased levels of HOMA-B (p = 1.4 × 10-2 ), fasting insulin (p = 2.7 × 10-2 ) and HOMA-IR (p = 3.8 × 10-2 ) were identified. The minor C allele of HNF4A-rs6130615 was marginally associated with decreased fasting insulin levels (p = 0.050) and HOMA-IR (p = 0.048).
Variants in MODY genes playe a critical role in lipid and glucose homeostasis. Future studies will be required to further clarify the molecular mechanisms underlying these observed associations.
FOXA2, a member of the forkhead family of DNA-binding proteins, is frequently mutated in uterine cancers. Most of the mutations observed in uterine cancers are frameshifts and stops. FOXA2 is considered to be a driver gene in uterine cancers, functioning as a haploinsufficient tumor suppressor. The functional consequences of FOXA2 mutations, however, have not yet been determined. We evaluated the effects that frameshift mutations and a recurrent missense mutation have on FOXA2 transcriptional activity. Recurrent N-terminal frameshifts resulted in truncated proteins that failed to translocate to the nucleus and have no transcriptional activity using an E-cadherin/luciferase reporter assay. Protein abundance was reduced for the recurrent p.S169 W mutation, as was transcriptional activity. A C-terminal frameshift mutation had increased FOXA2 levels evidenced by both Western blot and immunofluorescence. Given that FOXA2 is a recognized activator of E-cadherin (CDH1) expression and E-cadherin's potential role in epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in a wide range of cancer types, we tested the hypothesis that FOXA2 mutations in primary uterine cancer specimens would be associated with reduced CDH1 transcript levels. qRT-PCR revealed significantly lower levels of CDH1 expression in primary tumors with FOXA2 mutations. Our findings in vitro and in vivo suggest that reduced transcriptional activity associated with FOXA2 mutations in uterine cancers is likely to contribute to protumorigenic changes in gene expression.
To provide a synopsis of the current understanding of the association between variants of HNF1B and cancer susceptibility, we conducted a comprehensive research synopsis and meta-analysis to evaluate associations between HNF1B variants and prostate and endometrial cancers.
Eighteen studies totaling 34,937 patients and 55,969 controls were eligible for this meta-analysis. Four variants showed a significant association with the risk of individual cancer. Strong significant associations were found between rs4430796 A and the risk of both prostate cancer (OR = 1.247, p = 2.21 × 10- 77) and endometrial cancer (OR = 1.217, p = 8.98 × 10- 16); the AA, AG genotypes also showed strong significant associations with the risk of prostate cancer (OR1 = 1.517, p = 4.46 × 10- 22; OR2 = 1.180, p = 0.002). There was a strong significant association between rs7501939 G and the risk of prostate cancer (OR = 1.201, p = 9.31 × 10- 31). Strong significant association was found between rs11649743 G (OR = 1.138, p = 1.08 × 10- 12), rs3760511 C (OR = 1.214, p = 1.57 × 10- 19) and the prostate cancer risk;the GG, AG genotypes of rs11649743 also showed strong significant associations with the risk of prostate cancer (OR1 = 1.496, p = 3.32 × 10- 6; OR2 = 1.276, p = 7.82 × 10- 6). All the cumulative epidemiological evidence of associations was graded as strong.
Our study summarizes the evidence and helps to reveal that common variants of HNF1B are associated with risk of prostate and endometrial cancer.
Prostate cancer is one of the most common types of cancer in men and the leading cause of death in developed countries. With the aid of molecular and genetic profiling of cancers, cancer molecular subtypes are paving the way for tailored cancer therapy. FOXA1 has been identified as one of the seven molecular subtypes of prostate cancer. FOXA1 is involved in a variety of metabolic process such as glucose homeostasis and deregulation of its expression is crucial in prostate cancer progression. In this study, we investigated the effects of FOXA1 gene knock-out on the expression levels of various cancer cell metabolism and cell cycle-related protein expressions. FOXA1 gene was knocked-out by using CRISPR/Cas9 technique. While FOXA1 gene knock-out significantly altered Casp-9, Bax, CCND1, CDK4, and fibronectin protein expressions (P &lt; 0.05, fold change: ∼40, 4.5, 2.5, 4.5, and 4, respectively), it did not affect the protein expression levels of Casp-3, Bcl-2, survivin, β-catenin, c-Myc, and GSK-3B. Knocking-out FOXA1 gene in androgen-dependent LNCaP prostate cancer cells inhibited CCND1 protein expression. Our pre-clinical results demonstrate the importance of FOXA1 as a drug target in the treatment of prostate cancer. Impact statement Knock-out studies offer a unique way of studying the function of genes especially for developmentally lethal genes. FOXA1 has prominent roles both in breast and prostate cancer pathogenesis due to its role in ER receptor signaling pathway. FOXA1 has also been identified as one of the seven molecular subtypes of primary prostate cancer. In the present study, we used an efficient gene knock-out method, CRISPR/Cas9, in order to investigate FOXA1 function on LNCaP prostate cancer cells in vitro. FOXA1 knock-out altered cell-cycle regulator CCND1 protein expression levels. Therefore, our results suggest that FOXA1 might be a plausible drug target for prostate cancer treatment.
Oct4 is uniformly expressed by all types of pluripotent cells and is essential for pluripotency. Oct4 is also the central reprogramming factor that is constant in most transcription factor cocktails used to generate iPS cells. This article discusses the mechanisms of regulating Oct4 expression by confluence-based Hgf and hypoxia signalling in mouse somatic cells. Stat3 is activated ligandindependently in confluent cells and triggers the formation of cell aggregates. Hgf signalling is preserved after confluence, stimulating β-catenin and Stat3 activity, which are both crucial for Oct4 transcription. Stat3 and β-catenin activities also help sustain cell survival and proliferation, resulting in the formation of cell spheres. Hypoxic conditions in spheres activate regulators of Oct4 and further induce Oct4 expression. Activation of the Oct4 gene depends on nuclear receptors Lrh1/SF1, Esrrb, and Rars. These interact synergistically to initiate Oct4 transcription through organizing a transcriptional initiation complex. cAMP signalling stimulates the production of the SF1/Lrh1 ligand. Esrrb agonist or estrogen might function in activating Esrrb, while Rars might be induced by hypoxia. Taken together, Oct4 expression is probably induced in mouse somatic cells by culturing post-confluence cells with media containing Hgf, Esrrb agonist, and cAMP agonist. Exploring confluence-related signalling to modulate the expression of Oct4 might be helpful in finding novel strategies for reprogramming somatic cells.
Heterozygous mutation of the transcription factor HNF1B is the most common cause of monogenetic developmental renal disease. Disease-associated mutations fall into two categories: HNF1B intragenic mutations and a 1.3 Mb deletion at chromosome 17q12. An increase in neurodevelopmental disorders has been observed in individuals harbouring the 17q12 deletion but not in patients with HNF1B coding mutations.Previous investigations have concentrated on identifying a genetic cause for the increase in behavioural problems seen in 17q12 deletion carriers. We have taken the alternative approach of investigating the DNA methylation profile of these two HNF1B genotype groups along with controls matched for age, gender and diabetes status using the Illumina 450K DNA methylation array (total sample n = 60).We identified a number of differentially methylated probes (DMPs) that were associated with HNF1B-associated disease and passed our stringent experiment-wide significance threshold. These associations were largely driven by the deletion patients and the majority of the significant probes mapped to the 17q12 deletion locus. The observed changes in DNA methylation at this locus were not randomly dispersed and occurred in clusters, suggesting a regulatory mechanism reacting to haploinsufficiency across the entire deleted region.Along with these deletion-specific changes in DNA methylation, we also identified a shared DNA methylation signature in both mutation and deletion patient groups indicating that haploinsufficiency of HNF1B impacts on the methylome of a number of genes, giving further insight to the role of HNF1B.
Obesity is a complex disorder, the development of which is modulated by a multitude of environmental, behavioral and genetic factors. The common forms of obesity are polygenic in nature which means that many variants in the same or different genes act synergistically and affect the body weight quantitatively. The aim of the current study was to use information from many common variants previously identified to affect body weight to construct a gene score and observe whether it improves the associations observed. The SNPs selected were G2548A in leptin (LEP) gene, Gln223Arg in leptin receptor (LEPR) gene, Ala54Thr in fatty acid binding protein 2 (FABP2) gene, rs1121980 in fat mass and obesity associated (FTO) gene, rs3923113 in Growth Factor Receptor Bound Protein 14 (GRB14), rs16861329 in Beta-galactoside alpha-2,6-sialyltransferase 1 (ST6GAL1), rs1802295 in Vacuolar protein sorting-associated protein 26A (VPS26A), rs7178572 in high mobility group 20A (HMG20A), rs2028299 in adaptor-related protein complex 3 (AP3S2), and rs4812829 in Hepatocyte Nuclear Factor 4 Alpha (HNF4A).
A total of 475 subjects were genotyped for the selected SNPs in different genes using different genotyping techniques. The study subjects' age, weight, height, BMI, waist and hip circumference, serum total cholesterol, triglycerides, LDL and HDL were measured. A summation term, genetic risk score (GRS), was calculated using SPSS.
The results showed a significantly higher mean gene score in obese cases than in non-obese controls (9.1 ± 2.26 vs 8.35 ± 2.07, p = 2 × 10- 4). Among the traits tested for association, gene score appeared to significantly affect BMI, waist circumference, and all lipid traits.
In conclusion, the use of gene score is a better way to calculate the overall genetic risk from common variants rather than individual risk variants.
Human islet amyloid polypeptide (hIAPP) is the principal constituent of amyloid deposits and toxic oligomers in the pancreatic islets. Together with hyperglycemia, hIAPP-derived oligomers and aggregates are important culprits in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Here, we explored the role of the cell's main proteolytic complex, the proteasome, in hIAPP turnover in normal and stressed β-cells evoked by chronic hyperglycemia. Moderate inhibition (10-35%) of proteasome activity/function in cultured human islets by the proteasome inhibitor lactacystin enhanced intracellular accumulation of hIAPP. Unexpectedly, prolonged (&gt;1 h) and marked (&gt;50%) impairment of proteasome activity/function had a strong inhibitory effect on hIAPP transcription and secretion from normal and stressed β-cells. This negative compensatory feedback mechanism for controlling IAPP turnover was also observed in the lactacystin-treated rat insulinoma β-cell line (INS 832/13), demonstrating the presence of an evolutionarily conserved mechanism for IAPP production. In line with these in situ studies, our current ex vivo data showed that proteasome activity and hIAPP expression are also down-regulated in islets isolated from T2DM subjects. Gene expression and promoter activity studies demonstrated that the functional proteasome complex is required for efficient activation of the hIAPP promoter and for full expression of IAPP's essential transcription factor, FOXA2. ChIP studies revealed that promoter occupancy of FoxA2 at the rat IAPP promoter region is an important and limiting factor for amylin expression in proteasome-impaired murine cells. This study suggests a novel regulatory pathway in β-cells involving proteasome, FOXA2, and IAPP, which can be possibly targeted to regulate hIAPP levels and islet amyloidosis in T2DM.
Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is the most common tumor of the kidney and its major histologic subtype is clear cell RCC (ccRCC). About 30% of diagnosed ccRCCs already have metastasis. Traditionally, localized ccRCC is treated with nephrectomy but the relapse rate is 30%. Thus, the discovery of effective biomarkers for early detection, as well as the identification of new targets for molecular-based therapy of ccRCC are urgently required. In this study, we focused on molecules that could modulate the trascription of the enzyme nicotinamide N-methyltransferase (NNMT) that is known to be up-regulated in ccRCC. Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), interleukin 6 (IL-6), hepatocyte nuclear factor 1 beta (HNF-1β) and transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-β1) expression levels were determined in tumor and non tumor samples obtained from 30 patients with ccRCC, using Real-Time PCR. Results obtained showed that TGF-β1 is significantly (p&amp;lt;0.05) overexpressed in tumor compared with normal tissue samples of ccRCC patients. Conversely, we did not find any statistically significant difference concerning STAT3, IL-6, HNF-1β gene expression levels. TGF-β1 up-regulation could be responsible for the high levels of NNMT observed in ccRCC. Targeting TGF-β1 could improve the outcome of ccRCC patients due to its role in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), that is known to be associated with a worse overall survival (OS) in this neoplasm.
Gut derived bacterial endotoxins, such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS), are involved in one of the important mechanisms that lead to inflammation associated with various liver diseases, including nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and alcoholic liver disease. Kahweol is a coffee-specific diterpene present in coffee bean and exhibits anti-angiogenic and anti-inflammatory activities. However, to date, the effect of kahweol on liver inflammation remains unknown. In this study, we examined whether kahweol exhibits a protective effect by inhibiting liver inflammation in primary Kupffer cells and primary hepatocytes cultures as well as their co-cultures. Kahweol decreased the LPS-induced production of interleukin 1 alpha, interleukin 1 beta, interleukin 6, and tumor necrosis factor alpha. The inhibitory effect of kahweol on the liver inflammation was associated with the down regulation of LPS-stimulated phospho-nuclear factor kappa B and -signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 expression. These results suggest that kahweol might be a novel potent agent to treat liver inflammation induced by LPS.
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), is one of the most frequent human cancer and is characterized by a high mortality rate. The aggressiveness appears strictly related to the liver pathological background on which cancer develops. Inflammation and the consequent fibro/cirrhosis, derived from chronic injuries of several origins (viral, toxic and metabolic) and observable in almost all oncological patients, represents the most powerful risk factor for HCC and, at the same time, an important obstacle to the efficacy of systemic therapy. Multiple microenvironmental cues, indeed, play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis, evolution and recurrence of HCC as well as in the resistance to standard therapies observed in most of patients. The identification of altered pathways in cancer cells and of microenvironmental changes, strictly connected in pathogenic feedback loop, may permit to plan new therapeutic approaches targeting tumor cells and their permissive microenvironment, simultaneously.
This study was undertaken to detect if free fatty acids (FFA) induce hepatocyte senescence in L-02 cells and if huperzine A has an anti-aging effect in fatty liver cells.
L-02 cells were treated with a FFA mixture (oleate/palmitate, at 3:0, 2:1, 1:1, 1:2 and 0:3 ratios) at different concentrations. Cell viability and fat accumulation rate were assessed by a Cell Counting Kit 8 and Nile Red staining, respectively. The mixture with the highest cell viability and fat accumulation rate was selected to continue with the following experiment. The L-02 cells were divided into five groups, including the control group, FFA group, FFA + 0.1 μmol/L huperzine A (LH) group, FFA + 1.0 μmol/L huperzine A (MH) group and FFA + 10 μmol/L huperzine A (HH) group, and were cultured for 24 h. The expression of senescence-associated β-galactosidase (SA-β-gal) was detected by an SA-β-gal staining kit. The expression levels of aging genes were measured by qRT-PCR. The expression levels of apoptosis proteins were detected by a Western blot. ELISA kits were used to detect inflammatory factors and oxidative stress products. The expression of nuclear factor (NF-κB) and IκBα were detected by immunofluorescence.
The FFA mixture (oleate/palmitate, at a 2:1 ratio) of 0.5 mmol/L had the highest cell viability and fat accumulation rate, which was preferable for establishing an in vitro fatty liver model. The expression of inflammatory factors (TNF-α and IL-6) and oxidants Malonaldehyde (MDA), 4-hydroxynonenal (HNE) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) also increased in the L-02 fatty liver cells. The expression levels of aging markers and aging genes, such as SA-β-gal, p16, p21, p53 and pRb, increased more in the L-02 fatty liver cells than in the L-02 cells. The total levels of the apoptosis-associated proteins Bcl2, Bax, Bax/Bcl-2, CyCt and cleaved caspase 9 were also upregulated in the L-02 fatty liver cells. All of the above genes and proteins were downregulated in the huperzine A and FFA co-treatment group. In the L-02 fatty liver cells, the expression of IκBα decreased, while the expression of NF-κB increased. After the huperzine A and FFA co-treatment, the expression of IκBα increased, while the expression of NF-κB decreased.
Fatty liver cells showed an obvious senescence and apoptosis phenomenon. Huperzine A suppressed hepatocyte senescence, and it might exert its anti-aging effect via the NF-κB pathway.
Uterine glands are essential for pregnancy establishment. By employing forkhead box A2 (FOXA2)-deficient mouse models coupled with leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) repletion, we reveal definitive roles of uterine glands in embryo implantation and stromal cell decidualization. Here we report that LIF from the uterine glands initiates embryo-uterine communication, leading to embryo attachment and stromal cell decidualization. Detailed histological and molecular analyses discovered that implantation crypt formation does not involve uterine glands, but removal of the luminal epithelium is delayed and subsequent decidualization fails in LIF-replaced glandless but not gland-containing FOXA2-deficient mice. Adverse ripple effects of those dysregulated events in the glandless uterus result in embryo resorption and pregnancy failure. These studies provide evidence that uterine glands synchronize embryo-endometrial interactions, coordinate on-time embryo implantation, and impact stromal cell decidualization, thereby ensuring embryo viability, placental growth, and pregnancy success.
Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) is a useful tumor marker for ovarian germ cell tumors, particularly yolk sac tumor (YST). It is valuable for both diagnosis and further follow-up. Epithelial ovarian carcinoma (EOC) rarely secretes AFP, especially for clear cell type and in the postmenopausal women. Based on the limited knowledge about AFP-producing clear cell type EOC, a case and literature review on this topic is extensively reviewed.
We report a 55-year-old postmenopausal woman experienced vaginal spotting for one month, and serum level of AFP was 60,721 ng/ml initially. Histological examination was clear cell type EOC. Tumor cells revealed strong immunoreactivity for glypican-3 (GPC3) and AFP and weak for hepatocyte nuclear factor-1 beta (HNF-1 beta), but negative for CD30, making the diagnosis of AFP-producing clear cell type EOC with fetal gut differentiation in focal areas, FIGO (International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics) IIIc. Although the patient underwent an intensive treatment, including optimal debulking surgery and multi-agent chemotherapy, the patient died of disease. To provide a better understanding of clinical and molecular characteristics of the AFP-producing clear cell type EOC, we conducted a systematic literature review.
A total of three papers described the AFP-producing clear cell type EOC are available. The overall survival rate of these cases, including the current case is 50%. Although immunohistochemical examination is not always needed in routine for the diagnosis of clear cell type EOC, to distinguish from other tumors, especially germ cell tumors, or to provide the better way to monitor therapeutic response or to evaluate the disease status, immunostaining, including GPC3, HNF-1 beta, CD30, cytokeratin 7 or 20, and AFP is taken into account. Due to rarity, the appropriate chemotherapy regimen and the biological behavior of AFP-producing clear cell type EOC are still unclear.
Epidemiologic studies have reported relationships between maternal high folate and/or low B12 status during pregnancy and greater adiposity and insulin resistance in children. The goal of this study was to determine the effects of maternal folic acid supplementation (10 mg/kg diet), with (50 μg/kg diet) and without B12, on adult female offspring adiposity and glucose homeostasis. Female C57BL/6J mice were fed 1 of 3 diets from weaning and throughout breeding, pregnancy, and lactation: control (2 mg/kg diet folic acid, 50 μg/kg diet B12), supplemental folic acid with no B12 (SFA-B12), or supplemental folic acid with adequate B12 (SFA+B12). Female offspring were weaned onto the control diet or a Western diet (45% energy fat, 2 mg/kg diet folic acid, 50 μg/kg diet B12) for 35 wk. After weaning, control diet-fed offspring with SFA-B12 dams had fasting hyperglycemia, glucose intolerance, lower β cell mass, and greater islet hepatocyte nuclear factor 1 homeobox α and nuclear receptor subfamily 1 group H member 3 mRNA than did offspring from control dams. In Western diet-fed offspring, those with SFA-B12 dams had lower fasting blood glucose and plasma insulin concentrations, and were smaller than control offspring. Our findings suggest that maternal folic acid supplementation with B12 deficiency during pregnancy/lactation programs the metabolic health of adult female offspring but is dependent on offspring diet.-Henderson, A. M., Tai, D. C., Aleliunas, R. E., Aljaadi, A. M., Glier, M. B., Xu, E. E., Miller, J. W., Verchere, C. B., Green, T. J., Devlin, A. M. Maternal folic acid supplementation with vitamin B12 deficiency during pregnancy and lactation affects the metabolic health of adult female offspring but is dependent on offspring diet.
The incidence of cervical adenocarcinoma, both absolute and relative to squamous cell carcinoma, is increasing. Most cervical adenocarcinomas are human papillomavirus associated, although non-human papillomavirus-associated neoplasms exist; the latter include gastric-type adenocarcinoma (GAS) and clear cell carcinoma (CCC). Histologically, these 2 tumors may superficially resemble one other and although morphologic evaluation usually permits a correct diagnosis, immunohistochemistry may be required to resolve diagnostic uncertainty, especially in a small biopsy specimen. Markers of CCC include hepatocyte nuclear factor 1 beta (HNF1β) and Napsin A. In order to explore the utility of these markers in distinguishing between GAS and CCC, we stained 24 cases of GAS (19 cervical, 5 vaginal), 3 of cervical gastric-type adenocarcinoma in situ (gAIS) and 14 CCCs (13 cervical, 1 vaginal) with these antibodies. We found HNF1β expression in 21 of 23 cases of GAS (91.3%; there was no material available for staining in 1 case), 3/3 cases of gAIS (100%) and 10 of 14 (71.4%) CCCs. Napsin A was expressed in 4 of 24 (16.7%) cases of GAS, 0 of 3 (0%) gAIS, and 11 of 14 (78.6%) CCC. On the basis of these findings, Napsin A is of value in resolving diagnostic confusion between GAS and CCC, whereas HNF1β lacks specificity and its use in this setting is discouraged.
The diagnosis of atypical non-autoimmune forms of diabetes mellitus, such as maturity onset diabetes of the young (MODY) presents several challenges, in view of the extensive clinical and genetic heterogeneity of the disease. In this report we describe a case of atypical non autoimmune diabetes associated with a damaging HNF1β mutation. This is distinguished by a number of uncharacteristic clinical features, including early-onset obesity, the absence of renal cysts and diabetic nephropathy. HNF1β-MODY (MODY5) is an uncommon form of monogenic diabetes that is often complicated by a wide array of congenital morphological anomalies of the urinary tract, including renal cysts. This report expands on the clinical phenotypes that have been described in the context of HNF1β mutations, and is relevant as only isolated cases of diabetic nephropathy in the setting of MODY5 have been reported.
An obese Maltese female with non-autoimmune diabetes, microalbuminuria, glomerular hyperfiltration, fatty liver and no renal cysts was studied by whole exome sequencing to investigate potential genes responsible for the proband's phenotype. A rare missense mutation at a highly conserved site in exon 8 of HNF1β was identified (c.1580G &gt; A, NM_000458.3, p.Arg527Gln), with multiple in-silico predictions consistent with pathogenicity. This mutation has not been previously characterised. Additionally, several common susceptibility variants associated with early-onset obesity, polygenic type 2 diabetes and nephropathy were identified in the proband that could impose additional effects on the phenotype, its severity or its clinical course.
This report highlights several atypical features in a proband with atypical diabetes associated with an HNF1β missense mutation. It also reinforces the concept that monogenic causes of diabetes could be significant contributors to disease burden in obese individuals with atypical diabetes.
Studying the profile of micro RNAs (miRs) elucidated the highest expressed miRs in hepatic differentiation. In this study, we investigated to clarify the role of three embryonic overexpressed miRs (miR-106a, miR-574-3p and miR-451) during hepatic differentiation of human umbilical cord derived mesenchymal stem cells (UC-MSCs). We furthermore, aimed to explore whether overexpression of any of these miRs alone is sufficient to induce the differentiation of the UC-MSCs into hepatocyte-like cells. UC-MSCs were transfected either alone or together with miR-106a, miR-574-3p and miR-451 and their potential hepatic differentiation and alteration in gene expression profile, morphological changes and albumin secretion ability were investigated. We found that up-regulation of any of these three miRs alone cannot induce expression of all hepatic specific genes. Transfection of each miR alone, led to Sox17, FoxA2 expression that are related to initiation step of hepatic differentiation. However, concurrent ectopic overexpression of three miRs together can induce UC-MSCs differentiation into functionally mature hepatocytes. These results show that miRs have the capability to directly convert UC-MSCs to a hepatocyte phenotype in vitro.
The growth plate mediates bone growth where SOX9 and GLI factors control chondrocyte proliferation, differentiation and entry into hypertrophy. FOXA factors regulate hypertrophic chondrocyte maturation. How these factors integrate into a Gene Regulatory Network (GRN) controlling these differentiation transitions is incompletely understood. We adopted a genome-wide whole tissue approach to establish a Growth Plate Differential Gene Expression Library (GP-DGEL) for fractionated proliferating, pre-hypertrophic, early and late hypertrophic chondrocytes, as an overarching resource for discovery of pathways and disease candidates. De novo motif discovery revealed the enrichment of SOX9 and GLI binding sites in the genes preferentially expressed in proliferating and prehypertrophic chondrocytes, suggesting the potential cooperation between SOX9 and GLI proteins. We integrated the analyses of the transcriptome, SOX9, GLI1 and GLI3 ChIP-seq datasets, with functional validation by transactivation assays and mouse mutants. We identified new SOX9 targets and showed SOX9-GLI directly and cooperatively regulate many genes such as Trps1, Sox9, Sox5, Sox6, Col2a1, Ptch1, Gli1 and Gli2. Further, FOXA2 competes with SOX9 for the transactivation of target genes. The data support a model of SOX9-GLI-FOXA phasic GRN in chondrocyte development. Together, SOX9-GLI auto-regulate and cooperate to activate and repress genes in proliferating chondrocytes. Upon hypertrophy, FOXA competes with SOX9, and control toward terminal differentiation passes to FOXA, RUNX, AP1 and MEF2 factors.
MicroRNAs (miRs) are considered to be effective, post‑transcriptional regulators in the pathophysiology of type 2 diabetes (T2D) and promising treatment targets. However, the function of miR‑141 remains to be elucidated. In the present study, upregulation of miR‑141 was demonstrated in diabetic mice and elderly diabetic patients. Using reverse transcriptase‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction, luciferase reporter assays and western blotting, forkhead box A2 (FOXA2) was identified as a direct target gene of miR‑141. The potential role of miRNA‑141 or FOXA2 was evaluated by overexpressing or silencing miR‑141 or FOXA2, respectively. The increased expression of miR‑141 resulted in impaired glucose‑stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) and INS‑1 β cell proliferation. In addition, miR‑141 silencing in MIN6 pseudoislets or INS‑1 β cells led to reduced T2D‑associated damage. Furthermore, the expression of miR‑141 may be corrected by treatment with pioglitazone, which is widely used for insulin resistance therapy. The present study also demonstrated the mechanism by which miR‑141 regulated GSIS and proliferation through FOXA2. Overexpression of FOXA2 in MIN6 pseudoislets increased the effect of the miR‑141 inhibitor on GSIS. FOXA2 effectively reversed the effect of miR‑141 overexpression on β cell proliferation. In conclusion, the results of the present study indicate that the pioglitazone/miR‑141/FOXA2 axis may represent a promising target mechanism for T2D treatment.
Heterozygous non-synonymous (p.S142F) mutation in HNF1A leads to maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) type 3, which is a subtype of dominant inherited young-onset non-autoimmune diabetes due to the defect of insulin secretion from pancreatic beta cells. We generated induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from a patient with HNF1A p.S142F mutation. Cells from this patient, which were reprogrammed by non-integrative viral transduction had normal karyotype, harboured the HNF1A p.S142F mutation, expressed pluripotency hallmarks.
Background: To elucidate the expression of Aurora kinases (AURK) and the anticancer effects of pan-aurora kinase inhibitor Danusertib in hepatocarcinogenesis model in C56Bl6 mice. Methods: Thirty mice C56Bl6 were randomly divided into Group A or control, Group B animals who underwent experimental hepatocarcinogenesis with diethylnitrosamine (DEN), and Group C animals with DEN-induced hepatocarcinogenenesis that treated with pan-aurora kinase inhibitor Danusertib. Primary antibodies for immunochistochemistry (IHC) included rabbit antibodies against Ki-67, DKK1, INCENP, cleaved caspase-3, NF-κB p65, c-Jun, β-catenin. Hepatocyte growth factor receptor (C-MET/HGFR) and Bcl-2 antagonist of cell death (BAD) serum levels were determined using a quantitative sandwich enzyme immunoassay technique. Results: Inhibition of AURK reduced the number of DEN-induced liver tumours. Apoptosis and proliferation was very low in both DEN-induced and anti- AURK groups respectively. The hepatocellular adenoma cells of DEN-treated mice uniformly had ample nuclear INCENP whereas in anti- AURK markedly decreased. Expression of β-catenin, NF-kB and c-Jun did not differ in liver tumors of both AURK -depleted and non-depleted mice. Conclusions: Depletion of AURK reduced the number of DEN-induced hepatic tumours. However, their size did not differ significantly between the groups.
Forkhead box A2 (FOXA2) is a pioneer transcription factor involved in organ development, function, and cancer. In the uterus, FOXA2 is essential for pregnancy and expressed specifically in the glands of the endometrium. Loss of FOXA2 function occurs during development of endometrial cancer in humans. The current study describes the development of a mouse model for conditional expression of mouse FOXA2. Using a system consisting of a minigene located at the Rosa26 locus, we generated a CAG-S-mFOXA2 allele in embryonic stem cells and subsequently in mice; before activation, the minigene is silent because of a floxed stop cassette inserted between the promoter and the transgene. To validate functionality, mice with the CAG-S-mFOXA2 allele were crossed with progesterone receptor (Pgr)-Cre mice and lactotransferrin (Ltf)-iCre mice that express Cre in the immature and adult uterus, respectively. In immature Pgr-Cre-CAG-S-mFoxa2 mice, FOXA2 protein was expressed in the luminal epithelium (LE), glandular epithelium (GE), stroma, and inner layer of the myometrium. Interestingly, FOXA2 protein was not observed in most of the LE of uteri from adult Pgr-Cre-CAG-S-mFoxa2 mice, although FOXA2 was maintained in the stroma, GE, and myometrium. The adult Pgr-Cre-CAG-S-mFoxa2 females were completely infertile. In contrast, Ltf-iCre-CAG-S-mFoxa2 mice were fertile with no detectable histological differences in the uterus. The adult uterus of Pgr-Cre-CAG-S-mFoxa2 mice was smaller, contained few endometrial glands, and displayed areas of partially stratified LE and GE. This transgenic mouse line is a valuable resource to elucidating and exploring FOXA2 function.
Toll-like receptors and downstream signal transduction pathways play pivotal roles in induction of inflammation, which is crucial for liver injury and regeneration.
Using a mouse model of partial hepatic ischemia-reperfusion injury followed by a 28-day time course for liver repair and regeneration, we assessed gene expression levels for Toll-like receptors, myeloid differentiation primary response 88, TIR-domain-containing adapter-inducing interferon-β, nuclear factor κB, interferon regulatory factors, tumor necrosis factor-α, and interleukins 1β and 6 at days 1, 4, 7, 14, and 28 after reperfusion in liver and blood cells by quantitative polymerase chain reaction.
Mouse liver was gradually injured until 24 hours after reperfusion, and necrotic areas remained for 7 days. Concurrent with liver necrosis, overexpression of hepatocyte growth factor in blood cells (days 1-14), transient overexpression of cyclin D1 at day 7 in hepatic cells, and overexpression of transforming growth factor-β1 at days 7 and 14 in blood cells were used to characterize the priming, proliferative, and termination phases of liver regeneration. Liver regeneration was associated with significant up-regulation of Toll-like receptor 4, p65, interferon regulatory factors 1, 3, 9, tumor necrosis factor-α, and interleukin 1β at 24 hours. Liver regeneration was also associated with persistent overexpression of MyD88 (days 1-28) and with delayed TIR-domain-containing adapter-inducing interferon-β (days 4-28) in hepatic cells. In peripheral blood cells, Toll-like receptor 2 and MyD88 were up-regulated at 24 hours and Toll-like receptor 4 (days 1-14) and interferon regulatory factor 1 (days 1-7) showed persistent overexpression concomitant with interferon regulatory factor 5 (days 7-14); interleukin 1β (days 1-28) and interleukin 6 (day 4-28) also showed persistent expression.
We depict for the first time a prospective view of cooperative transcriptional activation of Toll-like receptors/adaptors/interferon regulatory factors/cytokines in both liver and blood cells during different phases of liver repair after ischemia-reperfusion injury.
Obesity is associated with both endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and chronic metabolic inflammation. ER stress activates the unfolded protein response (UPR) and has been implicated in a variety of cancers, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). It is unclear whether individual UPR pathways are mechanistically linked to HCC development, however. Here we report a dual role for inositol-requiring enzyme 1α (IRE1α), the ER-localized UPR signal transducer, in obesity-promoted HCC development. We found that genetic ablation of IRE1α in hepatocytes not only markedly reduced the occurrence of diethylnitrosamine (DEN)-induced HCC in liver-specific IRE1α knockout (LKO) mice when fed a normal chow (NC) diet, but also protected against the acceleration of HCC progression during high-fat diet (HFD) feeding. Irrespective of their adiposity states, LKO mice showed decreased hepatocyte proliferation and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) activation, even in the face of increased hepatic apoptosis. Furthermore, IRE1α abrogation blunted obesity-associated activation of hepatic inhibitor of nuclear factor kappa B kinase subunit beta (IKKβ)-nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) pathway, leading to reduced production of the tumor-promoting inflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and interleukin 6 (IL-6). Importantly, higher IRE1α expression along with elevated STAT3 phosphorylation was also observed in the tumor tissues from human HCC patients, correlating with their poorer survival rate.
IRE1α acts in a feed-forward loop during obesity-induced metabolic inflammation to promote HCC development through STAT3-mediated hepatocyte proliferation. (Hepatology 2018).
Acute hepatic failure involves in serious inflammatory responses and leads to a high mortality. Magnesium isoglycyrrhizinate (MgIG), a magnesium salt of 18-α glycyrrhizic acid (GA) stereoisomer, has been shown anti-inflammatory activity previously.
This study aimed to investigate the protective effects of MgIG, a hepatocyte protective agent, on D-galactosamine and lipopolysaccharide (D-GaIN/LPS)-induced acute liver injury in rats, and meanwhile explore the molecular mechanism.
Male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were injected with D-GaIN/LPS (800 mg/kgBW/10 μg/kgBW) with or without administration of MgIG (225 mg/kg once 6 h after D-GaIN/LPS injection and MgIG 45 mg/kg twice in another 12 h, intraperitoneal injection). Rats were sacrificed 24 h after D-GaIN/LPS injection, the blood and liver samples were collected for future inflammation and hepatotoxicity analyses.
MgIG significantly inhibited D-GaIN/LPS-induced inflammatory cytokines production and hepatotoxicity as indicated by both diagnostic indicators of liver damage [aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels] and histopathological analysis. Western blot analysis demonstrated that MgIG significantly decreased p38-mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) activation induced by D-GaIN/LPS.
The results indicated that the protective effects of MgIG on D-GaIN/LPS-induced acute liver injury might be correlated with its capacity to regulate the p38-MAPK and NF-κB signaling pathways.
Elongation of very long chain fatty acids protein 6 (Elovl6) is a key enzyme in fatty acid synthesis, which participates in converting palmitate (C16:0) to stearate (C18:0). Although studies of Elovl6 have been carried out in mammals, the nutritional regulation of elovl6 in fish remains poorly understood. In the present study, the cloning and nutritional regulation of elovl6 were determined in large yellow croaker. Sequence and phylogenetic analysis revealed that the full-length cDNA of elovl6 was 1360 bp, including an open reading frame of 810 bp encoding a putative protein of 269 amino acid that possesses the characteristic features of Elovl proteins. The transcript level of elovl6 was significantly increased in the liver of croaker fed the diets with soybean oil (enriched with 18: 2n-6, LA) or linseed oil (enriched with 18: 3n-3, ALA) than that in croaker fed the diet with fish oil (enriched with 20: 5n-3 and 22: 6n-3). Correspondingly, the elovl6 expression in croaker's hepatocytes treated with ALA or LA was remarkably increased compared to the controls. Furthermore, the transcription factors including hepatocyte nuclear factor 1α (HNF1α), CCAAT-enhancer-binding protein β (CEBPβ), retinoid X receptor α (RXRα), and cAMP response element-binding protein 1 (CREB1) greatly enhanced promoter activity of elovl6 in large yellow croaker, and the expression of transcription factors is consistent with the changes of elovl6 expression in response to fatty acids in vivo and in vitro. In conclusion, this study revealed that elovl6 expression in large yellow croaker could be upregulated by dietary ALA or LA via the increased transcriptional expression of transcription factors including hnf1α, cebpβ, rxrα, and creb1.
Over the past few decades, there has been growing interest in understanding the molecular mechanisms of cancer pathogenesis and progression, as it is still associated with high morbidity and mortality. Current management of large bone sarcomas typically includes the complex therapeutic approach of limb salvage or sacrifice combined with pre- and postoperative multidrug chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy, and is still associated with high recurrence rates. The development of cellular strategies against specific characteristics of tumour cells appears to be promising, as they can target cancer cells selectively. Recently, Mesenchymal Stromal Cells (MSCs) have been the subject of significant research in orthopaedic clinical practice through their use in regenerative medicine. Further research has been directed at the use of MSCs for more personalized bone sarcoma treatments, taking advantage of their wide range of potential biological functions, which can be augmented by using tissue engineering approaches to promote healing of large defects. In this review, we explore the use of MSCs in bone sarcoma treatment, by analyzing MSCs and tumour cell interactions, transduction of MSCs to target sarcoma, and their clinical applications on humans concerning bone regeneration after bone sarcoma extraction.
Hepatic progenitor cells (HPCs) in adult liver are promising for treatment of liver diseases. A biliary-derived HPC population in adult mice has been characterized by co-expression of stem cell marker Sry (sex determining region Y)-box 9 (SOX9) and biliary marker cytokeratin 7 (CK7). However, isolation of these HPCs in adult healthy liver without any selection procedures remains a big challenge in this field. Here, by establishing a simple and efficient method to isolate and expand the CK7+ SOX9+ HPCs in vitro as clones, we acquired a stable and largely scalable cell source. The CK7+ SOX9+ progenitor cells were then further induced to differentiate into hepatocyte-like cells with expression of mature hepatocyte markers albumin (Alb) and hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 alpha (HNF4α), both in vitro and in vivo in the presence of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and fibroblast growth factor 9 (FGF9). Furthermore, we found that the HPCs are highly responsive to transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) signals. Collectively, we identified and harvested a CK7+ SOX9+ progenitor cell population from adult mouse liver by a simple and efficient approach. The exploration of this HPC population offers an alternative strategy of generating hepatocyte-like cells for cell-based therapies of acute and chronic liver disorders.
Background Congenital hyperinsulinism (CHI) occurs due to an unregulated insulin secretion from the pancreatic β-cells resulting in hypoglycaemia. Causative mutations in multiple genes have been reported. Phenotypic variability exists both within and between different genetic subgroups. Case presentation A male infant born at 35+6 weeks' gestation with a birth weight of 4.3 kg [+3.6 standard deviation score (SDS)] had recurrent hypoglycaemic episodes from birth. Biochemical investigations confirmed a diagnosis of CHI. Diazoxide was started and the dose was progressively increased to maintain euglycaemia. His father was slim and had been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes in his 30s. Sequence analysis identified a heterozygous hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 alpha (HNF4A) mutation (p.Arg245Pro, c.734G&gt;C) and compound heterozygous ABCC8 mutations (p.Gly92Ser, c.274G&gt;A and p.Ala1185Val, c.3554C&gt;T) in the patient. The p.Ala1185Val ABCC8 mutation was inherited from his unaffected mother and the p.Arg245Pro HNF4A and p.Gly92Ser ABCC8 mutations from his father. All three mutations were predicted to be pathogenic. Identification of the HNF4A mutation in the father established a diagnosis of maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY), which enabled medication change resulting in improved glycaemic control. Conclusions We report a rare patient with CHI due to dual genetic aetiology. Although he is currently responsive to the maximum dose of diazoxide, the long-term prognosis remains unclear.
Congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract are caused by genetic alterations mostly unknown. Mutations in the gene that codes for hepatocyte nuclear factor 1B (HNF1B) are the most frequently described monogenic causes. Data are unknown in Chile and Latin America.
To determine the presence of variants of the HNF1B gene in Chilean children with conge nital anomalies of the kidney and/or the urinary tract and their clinical characteristics.
Descriptive study with children aged 10 months to 17 years, patients of the Calvo Mackenna Hospital Nephrology Unit, with cystic renal dysplasia, non cystic renal dysplasia/hypoplasia, horses hoe kidney between April and December 2016. HNF1B variants were determined by sequencing of exons 1, 2, 3 and 4 after DNA extraction and amplification. Restriction enzymes were used to define if the variants were homo or heterozygous. Direct family members of index cases were studied with sequencing of the affected exon.
32 patients were included, 43.75% males, median age 11 years. 65.6% of them had non-cystic renal dysplasia, 31.25% cystic renal dysplasia, and 3.15% hor seshoe kidney. In two patients (6.25%) the same heterozygous genetic variant was detected in exon 4, position 1027 (C1027T), not previously described. The study of relatives found the same variant in three out of five individuals, all without congenital nephro-urological anomalies.
We confirmed the presence of a not previously described heterozygous genetic variant of the HNF1B gene. This work initiates the search for this type of mutations in our region which allows us to ap proach the knowledge of causality, determination of extrarenal involvement, and genetic counseling.
Hepatocyte nuclear factor 1 α (HNF1α) mutations cause maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) type 3 and are associated with hepatocellular adenomatosis. Malignant transformation of HNF1α-mutated hepatocellular adenomas is rare. We report a case of a 28-year-old man with HNF1α-inactivated adenomatosis who developed an inflammatory adenoma with β catenin mutation with malignant transformation into a well-differentiated hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).
Mutationen des hepatocyte nuclear factor 1 α-(HNF1α) Gens lösen einen MODY3-Diabetes aus und sind mit einer hepatozellulären Adenomatose assoziiert. Eine maligne Transformation von HNF1α-mutierten hepatozellulären Adenomen ist selten. Wir beschreiben hier den Fall eines 28-jährigen Mannes mit heterozygoter HNF1α-Keimbahnmutation mit MODY3-Diabetes und einer hepatozellulären Adenomatose mit multiplen, HNF1α-inaktivierten Adenomen, der ein inflammatorisches Adenom mit β-Catenin-Mutation mit maligner Transformation in ein gut differenziertes hepatozelluläres Karzinom (HCC) entwickelte.
Costunolide, a sesquiterpene isolated from Vladimiria souliei (Franch.) Ling, is known to exhibit anti-inflammatory, anti-viral, and anti-tumor activities. However, the effects of costunolide on liver injury are poorly understood. The current study aimed to investigate the hepatoprotective effects of costunolide against lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and D-galactosamine-induced acute liver injury (ALI) in mice. The results indicated that costunolide (40 mg/kg) could significantly improve the pathological changes of hepatic tissue, and reduced the LPS and D-galactosamine-induced increases of alanine aminotransferase (from 887.24 ± 21.72 to 121.67 ± 6.56 IU/L) and aspartate aminotransferase (from 891.01 ± 45.24 to 199.94 ± 11.53 IU/L) activities in serum. Further research indicated that costunolide significantly reduced malondialdehyde content (from 24.56 ± 1.39 to 9.17 ± 0.25 nmol/ml) and reactive oxygen species (from 203.34 ± 7.68 to 144.23 ± 7.12%), increased the activity of anti-oxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase (from 153.74 ± 10.33 to 262.27 ± 8.39 U/ml), catalase (from 6.12 ± 0.30 to 12.44 ± 0.57 U/ml), and total anti-oxidant capacity (from 0.64 ± 0.06 to 6.29 ± 0.11 U/ml) in hepatic tissues. Western blot results revealed that costunolide may trigger the anti-oxidative defense system by inhibiting kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 and nuclear factor-related factor 2 (cytosol), increasing nuclear factor-related factor 2 (nucleus), heme oxygenase-1 and NAD (P) H quinone oxidoreductase 1 activity. Moreover, costunolide significantly decreased the protein expression of proinflammatory cytokines including interleukin 1β, interleukin 6, and tumor necrosis factor. Pretreatment with costunolide could reduce the expression of toll-like receptor 4, myeloid differentiation factor 88, p65 (Nucleus), phosphorylated IκB kinase α/β, inhibitor of nuclear factor kappa-B kinase, inhibitor kappa Bα and prevent the expression of phosphorylated inhibitor kappa B kinase which repressed translocation of p65 from cytoplasm to nucleus. In addition, pretreatment with costunolide also inhibited hepatocyte apoptosis by reducing the expression of B-cell lymphoma 2 associated X, cytochrome C, cysteinyl aspartate specific proteinase 3, cysteinyl aspartate specific proteinase 8 and cysteinyl aspartate specific proteinase 9, and by increasing B-cell lymphoma 2. From the above analysis, the protective effects of costunolide against LPS and D-galactosamine-induced ALI in mice may be attributed to its anti-oxidative activity in nuclear factor-related factor 2 signaling pathways, anti-inflammatory suppression in nuclear factor-kappa B signaling pathways, and inhibition of hepatocyte apoptosis. Thus, costunolide may be a potential therapeutic agent in attenuating LPS and D-galactosamine -induced ALI in the future.
The Arias-Stella reaction (ASR) can mimic endometrial clear cell carcinoma (ECCC) in small biopsies, especially when drug or pregnancy history is unknown. A panel of immunohistochemical markers comprising napsin A, hepatocyte nuclear factor-1-beta (HNF-1β), estrogen and progesterone receptors (ER, PR) has been found useful in confirming a diagnosis of ECCC. However, the detailed characterization of how expression of this combination of markers in the ECCC mimics ASR has yet to be thoroughly evaluated.
The frequency and extent of napsin A, HNF-1β, ER, and PR expression in ASR were assessed in a large series. For napsin A, any cytoplasmic staining was considered positive while only nuclear staining was deemed to be positive for HNF-1β, ER, and PR. Immunohistochemical histoscores based on the intensity and extent of staining were calculated.
Forty cases were gestational and 10 were nongestational ASR. In 19 (38%), the reaction was extensive and involved &gt;50% of the glands. A stromal decidual change was found in 31 (77.5%) of the gestational and 3 (30%) of the nongestational cases. Napsin A was positive in all gestational and 8 of 10 (80%) nongestational ASR. All ASR showed HNF-1β expression. ER expression was reduced in 37 (92.5%) and lost in 3 (7.5%) gestational ASR, and reduced in 9 (90%) and lost in 1 (10%) of nongestational ASR. None of the ASR in our series expressed PR.
Naspin A and HNF-1β were frequently expressed in both gestational and nongestational ASR, and ER expression was usually either reduced or loss. Interpretation of these markers in small biopsies containing atypical clear cells should be made with caution.
In the present study, we summarize the role of the shared and independent (epi)genetic background between endometrioid carcinoma (EC) and clear cell carcinoma (CCC), two histological subtypes of endometriosis-associated ovarian cancer (EAOC). Using the PubMed database, we conducted a literature review of various studies related to the malignant transformation of endometriosis. Both endometriosis and EAOC face potential environmental hazards, including hemoglobin (Hb), heme and free iron, which induces DNA damage and mutations. Although EC is distinguished from CCC due to different morphologies, both represent common environmental profiles and maintain the similar (epi)genomic abnormalities with multiple overlaps and share similar molecular signatures. By contrast, EAOC also has disease-specific gene signatures corresponding with each histological subtype: Estrogen receptor promotes EC cell proliferation ('go') and hepatocyte nuclear factor-1β (HNF-1β) induces CCC cell cycle arrest ('stop') under oxidative stress conditions. This model underscores a subtype-dependent 'go or stop' dichotomy, possibly through better ability to adapt in a changing environment. It was found that cyst fluid Hb and iron concentrations were significantly lower in EAOC when compared to benign ovarian endometrioma (OE), supporting the hypothesis that the redox imbalance plays a key role in the pathogenesis of EAOC. There are at least two phases of iron carcinogenesis and tumor progression: The initial wave of iron-induced oxidative stress and DNA mutations would be followed by the second big wave of subsequent synthesis of the antioxidants, which diminishes cellular oxidative stress capacity, increases apoptosis resistance and promotes tumor initiation and progression. Special emphasis is given to novel pathophysiological concepts of malignant transformation of endometriosis.
Hydrogen-rich saline (HRS) has antioxidative, anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic properties. We investigated the effects of hydrogen on hepatic ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) and laparoscopic hepatectomy in swine.
Twenty-one healthy Bama miniature pigs were randomly divided into the sham group, ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) group, HRS-5 (5 mL/kg) group, and HRS-10 (10 mL/kg) group. HRS was injected through the portal vein 10 min before reperfusion and at postoperative day 1, 2 and 3. The roles of HRS on oxidative stress, inflammatory response and liver regeneration were studied.
Compared with the IRI group, HRS treatment attenuated oxidative stress by increasing catalase activity and reducing myeloperoxidase. White blood cells in the HRS-10 group were reduced compared with the IRI group (P &lt; 0.01). In the HRS-10 group, interleukin-1 beta, interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor alpha, C-reactive protein and cortisol were downregulated, whereas interleukin-10 was upregulated. In addition, HRS attenuated endothelial cell injury and promoted the secretion of angiogenic cytokines, including vascular endothelial growth factor, angiopoietin-1 and angiopoietin-2. HRS elevated the levels of hepatocyte growth factor, Cyclin D1, proliferating cell nuclear antigen, Ki-67 and reduced the secretion of transforming growth factor-beta.
HRS treatment may exert a protective effect against I/R and hepatectomy-induced hepatic damage by reducing oxidative stress, suppressing the inflammatory response and promoting liver regeneration.
We previously reported that transplantation of hepatic cell sheets from human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs) with hexachlorophene, a Wnt/β-catenin signaling inhibitor, ameliorated acute liver injury. In a further previous report, we identified IC-2, a newly synthesized derivative of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling inhibitor ICG-001, as a potent inducer of hepatic differentiation of BM-MSCs.
We manufactured hepatic cell sheets by engineering from human BM-MSCs using the single small molecule IC-2. The therapeutic potential of IC-2-induced hepatic cell sheets was assessed by transplantation of IC-2- and hexachlorophene-treated hepatic cell sheets using a mouse model of acute liver injury.
Significant improvement of liver injury was elicited by the IC-2-treated hepatic cell sheets. The expression of complement C3 was enhanced by IC-2, followed by prominent hepatocyte proliferation stimulated through the activation of NF-κB and its downstream molecule STAT-3. Indeed, IC-2 also enhanced the expression of amphiregulin, resulting in the activation of the EGFR pathway and further stimulation of hepatocyte proliferation. As another important therapeutic mechanism, we revealed prominent reduction of oxidative stress mediated through upregulation of the thioredoxin (TRX) system by IC-2-treated hepatic cell sheets. The effects mediated by IC-2-treated sheets were superior compared with those mediated by hexachlorophene-treated sheets.
The single compound IC-2 induced hepatic cell sheets that possess potent regeneration capacity and ameliorate acute liver injury.
Head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC) preferentially spread to regional cervical tissues and lymph nodes. Here, we hypothesized that lymphotoxin-β (LTβ), receptor LTβR, and NF-κB-inducing kinase (NIK), promote the aberrant activation of alternative NF-κB2/RELB pathway and genes, that enhance migration and invasion of HNSCC. Genomic and expression alterations of the alternative NF-kB pathway were examined in 279 HNSCC tumors from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and a panel of HNSCC lines. LTβR is amplified or overexpressed in HNSCC of the larynx or oral cavity, while LTβ, NIK, and RELB are overexpressed in cancers arising within lymphoid oropharyngeal and tonsillar sites. Similarly, subsets of HNSCC lines displayed overexpression of LTβR, NIK, and RELB proteins. Recombinant LTβ, and siRNA depletion of endogenous LTβR and NIK, modulated expression of LTβR, NIK, and nuclear translocation of NF-κB2(p52)/RELB as well as functional NF-κB promoter reporter activity. Treatment with a NIK inhibitor (1,3[2H,4H]-Iso-Quinoline Dione) reduced the protein expression of NIK and NF-κB2(p52)/RELB, and blocked LTβ induced nuclear translocation of RELB. NIK and RELB siRNA knockdown or NIK inhibitor slowed HNSCC migration or invation in vitro. LTβ-induces expression of migration and metastasis related genes, including hepatocyte growth/scatter factor receptor MET. Knockdown of NIK or MET similarly inhibited the migration of HNSCC cell lines. This may help explain why HNSCC preferentially migrate to local lymph nodes, where LTβ is expressed. Our findings show that LTβ/LTβR promotes activation of the alternative NIK-NF-κB2/RELB pathway to enhance MET-mediated cell migration in HNSCC, which could be potential therapeutic targets in HNSCC.
Maturity onset diabetes of the young (MODY) is a rare condition often misdiagnosed as type 1 diabetes (T1D). The purposes of this study were: to identify any patients followed in a large Turkish cohort as T1D, with an atypical natural history, who may in fact have MODY, and to define the criteria which would indicate patients with likely MODY as early as possible after presentation to allow prompt genetic testing.
Urinary C-peptide/creatinine ratio (UCPCR) was studied in 152 patients having a diagnosis of T1D for at least 3 years. Those with a UCPCR ≥0.2 nmol/mmol were selected for genetic analysis of the Glucokinase (GCK), Hepatocyte nuclear factor 1a (HNF1A), Hepatocyte nuclear factor 4a (HNF4A), and Hepatocyte nuclear factor 1b (HNF1B) genes. This UCPCR cut-off was used because of the reported high sensitivity and specificity. Cases were also evaluated using a MODY probability calculator.
Twenty-three patients from 152 participants (15.1%) had a UCPCR indicating persistent insulin reserve. The mean age ± SD of the patients was 13.6 ± 3.6 years (range 8.30-21.6). Of these 23, two (8.7%) were found to have a mutation, one with HNF4A and one with HNF1B mutation. No mutations were detected in the GCK or HNF1A genes.
In Turkish children with a diagnosis of T1D but who have persistent insulin reserve 3 years after diagnosis, up to 9% may have a genetic mutation indicating a diagnosis of MODY.
Wingless-type mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) integration site (Wnt) signaling is one of the most critical pathways in developing and adult tissues. In the brain, Wnt signaling contributes to different neurodevelopmental aspects ranging from differentiation to axonal extension, synapse formation, neurogenesis, and neuroprotection. Canonical Wnt signaling is mediated mainly by the multifunctional β-catenin protein which is a potent co-activator of transcription factors such as lymphoid enhancer factor (LEF) and T-cell factor (TCF). Accumulating evidence points to dysregulation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling in major neurodegenerative disorders. This review highlights a Wnt/β-catenin/glial connection in Parkinson's disease (PD), the most common movement disorder characterized by the selective death of midbrain dopaminergic (mDAergic) neuronal cell bodies in the subtantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) and gliosis. Major findings of the last decade document that Wnt/β-catenin signaling in partnership with glial cells is critically involved in each step and at every level in the regulation of nigrostriatal DAergic neuronal health, protection, and regeneration in the 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) mouse model of PD, focusing on Wnt/β-catenin signaling to boost a full neurorestorative program in PD.
Changes in cancer cell identity can alter malignant potential and therapeutic response. Loss of the pulmonary lineage specifier NKX2-1 augments the growth of KRAS-driven lung adenocarcinoma and causes pulmonary to gastric transdifferentiation. Here, we show that the transcription factors FoxA1 and FoxA2 are required for initiation of mucinous NKX2-1-negative lung adenocarcinomas in the mouse and for activation of their gastric differentiation program. Foxa1/2 deletion severely impairs tumor initiation and causes a proximal shift in cellular identity, yielding tumors expressing markers of the squamocolumnar junction of the gastrointestinal tract. In contrast, we observe downregulation of FoxA1/2 expression in the squamous component of both murine and human lung adenosquamous carcinoma. Using sequential in vivo recombination, we find that FoxA1/2 loss in established KRAS-driven neoplasia originating from SPC-positive alveolar cells induces keratinizing squamous cell carcinomas. Thus, NKX2-1, FoxA1 and FoxA2 coordinately regulate the growth and identity of lung cancer in a context-specific manner.
Traumatic brain injury (TBI) represents a major cause of disability and death worldwide with sustained neuroinflammation and autophagy dysfunction contributing to the cellular damage. Stimulator of interferon genes (STING)-induced type-I interferon (IFN) signalling is known to be essential in mounting the innate immune response against infections and cell injury in the periphery, but its role in the CNS remains unclear. We previously identified the type-I IFN pathway as a key mediator of neuroinflammation and neuronal cell death in TBI. However, the modulation of the type-I IFN and neuroinflammatory responses by STING and its contribution to autophagy and neuronal cell death after TBI has not been explored.
C57BL/6J wild-type (WT) and STING-/- mice (8-10-week-old males) were subjected to controlled cortical impact (CCI) surgery and brains analysed by QPCR, Western blot and immunohistochemical analyses at 2 h or 24 h. STING expression was also analysed by QPCR in post-mortem human brain samples.
A significant upregulation in STING expression was identified in late trauma human brain samples that was confirmed in wild-type mice at 2 h and 24 h after CCI. This correlated with an elevated pro-inflammatory cytokine profile with increased TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β and type-I IFN (IFN-α and IFN-β) levels. This expression was suppressed in the STING-/- mice with a smaller lesion volume in the knockout animals at 24 h post CCI. Wild-type mice also displayed increased levels of autophagy markers, LC3-II, p62 and LAMP2 after TBI; however, STING-/- mice showed reduced LAMP2 expression suggesting a role for STING in driving dysfunctional autophagy after TBI.
Our data implicates a detrimental role for STING in mediating the TBI-induced neuroinflammatory response and autophagy dysfunction, potentially identifying a new therapeutic target for reducing cellular damage in TBI.
Vanadate, a protein tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor which elicits insulin-like effects, has previously been shown to inhibit expression of the insulin receptor gene at the transcriptional level in rat hepatoma cells. In an attempt to identify the DNA sequence and transcription factors potentially involved in this effect, a fragment of the proximal 5'flanking region of the IR gene (-1143/-252 upstream the ATG codon) has been cloned and functionally characterized. RNase protection allowed the identification of several transcription start sites in the conserved region of the gene, among which two major sites at -455 and -396. Upon fusion to the luciferase gene and transient transfection into hepatoma cells, the -1143/-252 fragment showed promoter activity. This was unaffected by deletion of the -1143/-761 sequence, but markedly decreased (90%) by additional deletion of the -760/-465 sequence. Treatment of hepatoma cells with vanadate led to a dose-dependent decrease in promoter activity of the 1143/-252, -760/-252 and -464/-252 constructs (change relative to untreated cells, 40, 55 and 23% at 125 μM, and 70, 85 and 62% at 250 μM, respectively). These data suggest that although the entire DNA sequence upstream the transcription start sites is probably involved in vanadate-induced inhibition, the short sequence downstream of position -464 and is sufficient for inhibition. Potential targets of vanadate are the transcription factors FoxO1 and HMGA1, two downstream targets of the insulin signaling pathway which have been shown to mediate the inhibitory effect of insulin on IR gene expression.
Leucine-rich repeat G protein-coupled receptors (LGRs) and their endogenous ligands R-spondin1-4 (Rspo) are critical in embryonic development and in maintenance of stem cells. The functions of the Rspo-LGR system in differentiated cells remain uncharacterized. In this study, the expression profiles of LGRs and Rspos were characterized in mature hepatocytes. A liver-specific knockout of LGR4 in mouse was generated and used to study hepatic ischemia/reperfusion-induced injury (HIRI) as well as lipopolysaccharide/ D- galactosamine (LPS/D-Gal)-induced liver injury. We have demonstrated that, in adult liver, LGR4 is expressed in hepatocytes and responds to Rspo1 with internalization. Rspo1 is responsive to various nutritional states and to mTOR signaling. Activation of LGR4 by Rspo1 significantly reduced tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα)-induced cell death, and levels of NF-κB-p65 and caspase-3 in cultured hepatocytes. Knockdown of hepatic LGR4 rendered hepatocytes more vulnerable to TNFα-induced damage in cultured primary cells and in the setting of HIRI and LPS/D-Gal-induced liver injury. Rspo1 potentiated both basal and Wnt3a-induced stabilization of β-catenin. Disruption of β-catenin signaling reversed the protective effects of Rspo1 on TNFα-induced hepatocyte toxicity. LGR4 knockdown increased nuclear translocation of NF-κB-p65 in response to acute injury. Overexpression of IKKβ attenuated the protective effects of Rspo1 on TNFα-induced cell death. In conclusion, the Rspo1-LGR4 system represents a novel pathway for cytoprotection and modulation of stress-induced tissue damage. NEW &amp; NOTEWORTHY Functional LGR4 is present in mature hepatocytes. R-spodin1 protects hepatocytes from tumor necrosis factor-α-induced cell death. Liver-specific knockdown of LGR4 renders liver more susceptible to acute injury. LGR4 protects hepatocytes from injury by inhibition of NF-κB signaling.
Hepatocyte nuclear factor 1-β is a transcription factor which plays a crucial role during ontogenesis in the differentiation of visceral endoderm from primitive endoderm, and is especially important for the normal development of the kidney, urogenital tract, gastrointestinal tract, liver, and pancreas. Despite the growing knowledge about the potential involvement of hepatocyte nuclear factor 1-β in the process of carcinogenesis, the exact underlying mechanism that would explain its rather varied effects in different tumours has not been sufficiently investigated. Most of the data regarding the significance of hepatocyte nuclear factor 1-β arise from genome- wide association studies and is concerned with the influence of single-nucleotide polymorphisms of hepatocyte nuclear factor 1-β on either the increased or decreased susceptibility to certain types of cancer. However, the influence of both the germinal and somatic mutations of this gene on the process of carcinogenesis is still poorly understood. According to current data, in some tumours hepatocyte nuclear factor 1-β acts as a protooncogene, while in others as a tumour suppressor gene, although the reasons for this are not clear. The exact incidence of hepatocyte nuclear factor 1-β mutations and the spectrum of tumours in which they may play a role in the process of carcinogenesis remain unknown. From the practical point of view, immunohistochemical expression of hepatocyte nuclear factor 1-β can be used in differential diagnostics of certain tumours, especially clear cell carcinoma. In our article we review the current knowledge regarding the significance of hepatocyte nuclear factor 1-β in carcinogenesis.
Liver organoids derived from human pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) represent a new type of in vitro liver model for understanding organ development, disease mechanism and drug testing. However, engineering liver organoids with favorable functions in a controlled cellular microenvironment remains challenging. In this work, we present a new strategy for engineering liver organoids derived from human induced PSCs (hiPSCs) in a 3D perfusable chip system by combining stem cell biology with microengineering technology. This approach enabled formation of hiPSC-based embryoid bodies (EBs), in situ hepatic differentiation, long-term 3D culture and generation of liver organoids in a perfusable micropillar chip. The generated liver organoids exhibited favorable growth and differentiation of hepatocytes and cholangiocytes, recapitulating the key features of human liver formation with cellular heterogeneity. The liver organoids in perfused cultures displayed improved cell viability and higher expression of endodermal genes (SOX17 and FOXA2) and mature hepatic genes (ALB and CYP3A4) under perfused culture conditions. In addition, the liver organoids showed a marked enhancement of hepatic-specific functions, including albumin and urea production and metabolic capabilities, indicating the role of mechanical fluid flow in promoting the functions of the liver organoids. Moreover, the liver organoids exhibited hepatotoxic response after exposure to acetaminophen (APAP) in a dose- and time-dependent manner. The established liver organoid-on-a-chip system may provide a promising platform for engineering stem cell-based organoids with applications in regenerative medicine, disease modeling and drug testing.
Mammalian pregnancy depends on the ability of the uterus to support embryo implantation. Previous studies reveal the Sox17 gene as a downstream target of the Pgr-Gata2-dependent transcription network that directs genomic actions in the uterine endometrium receptive for embryo implantation. Here, we report that ablating Sox17 in the uterine epithelium impairs leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and Indian hedgehog homolog (IHH) signaling, leading to failure of embryo implantation. In vivo deletion of the SOX17-binding region 19 kb upstream of the Ihh locus by CRISPR-Cas technology reduces Ihh expression specifically in the uterus and alters proper endometrial epithelial-stromal interactions, thereby impairing pregnancy. This SOX17-binding interval is also bound by GATA2, FOXA2, and PGR. This cluster of transcription factor binding is common in 737 uterine genes and may represent a key regulatory element essential for uterine epithelial gene expression.
This study investigated the expression of lung surfactant proteins (SP-B and SP-C), and regulatory factors [forkhead box A2 (FOXA2) and nitrolyogenic FOXA2 (N-FOXA2)] in the fetal lung of rats with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) in order to study the mechanism of pulmonary dysplasia. The rat GDM model was established by using streptozotocin intraperitoneally in the first stage of pregnancy. There were 10 rats in the GDM group, and 10 healthy rats in normal control group without any treatment. Fetal lungs of two groups were taken at day 21 of pregnancy. Blood glucose levels of maternal rats and fetal rats were measured by Roche blood glucose meter. The histological changes in the fetal lung were observed under the light microscope in both groups. The SP-B, SP-C and FOXA2 were determined in the fetal lung of two groups immunohistochemically. The expression levels of SP-B, SP-C, total FOXA2, FOXA2 in nucleus (n-FOXA2), N-FOXA2 proteins were detected by Western blotting, and the relative expression levels of SP-B, SP-C, FOXA2 mRNA in the fetal lung of two groups were detected by RTPCR. The results showed that blood glucose levels of maternal rats and fetal rats in GDM group were higher than those in control group. The light microscope revealed fetal lung development retardation in GDM group. The expression of SP-B and SP-C in GDM group was significantly reduced as compared with control group (P&lt;0.05). As compared with control group, the n-FOXA2 expression was significantly decreased in the fetal lung tissue, and N-FOXA2 was significantly increased in control group (P&lt;0.05), but there was no significant changes in the total FOXA2 (P&gt;0.05). It was concluded that GDM can cause fetal lung development and maturation disorders, and FOXA2 in fetal lung tissue decreases while nitrocellulose FOXA2 increases.
The role of DNA methylation patterns in complex phenotypes remains unclear. To explore this question, we adapted our methods for rare variant analysis to characterize genome-wide murine DNA hybridization array to investigate methylation at CpG islands, shores, and regulatory elements. We have applied this platform to compare age and tissue- specific methylation differences in the brain and spleen of young and aged mice. As expected from prior studies, there are clear global differences in organ-specific, but not age-specific, methylation due mostly to changes at repetitive elements. Surprisingly, out of 200,000 loci there were only 946 differentially methylated cytosines (DMCs) between young and old samples (529 hypermethylated, 417 hypomethylated in aged mice) compared to thousands of tissue-specific DMCs. Hypermethylated loci were clustered around the promoter region of Sfi1, exon 2 of Slc11a2, Drg1, Esr1 and Foxa2 transcription factor binding sites. In particular, there were 75 hypermethylated Foxa2 binding sites across a 2.7 Mb region of chromosome 11. Hypomethylated loci were clustered around Mid1, Isoc2b and genome-wide loci with binding sites for Foxa2 and Esr1, which are known to play important roles in development and aging. These data suggest discreet tissue-independent methylation changes associated with aging processes such as cell division (Sfi1, Mid1), energy production (Drg1, Isoc2b) and cell death (Foxa2, Esr1).
To elucidate the immunohistochemical (IHC) differences of endometrioma tissues that may have the potential to progress to ovarian clear cell carcinoma (OCCC) by using KRAS, HNF1β, PIK3CA, PPP2R1A, and ARID1A as biomarkers.
This is a retrospective clinical study, which was conducted in an university hospital. The groups comprised 14 patients with endometrioma resection who later developed OCCC (non-healthy endometrioma-case group) and 66 patients with endometrioma resection who did not develop ovarian cancer in subsequent follow-ups (healthy endometrium-control group). IHC staining with KRAS, HNF1β, PIK3CA, PPP2R1A, and ARID1A antibodies was performed in paraffin blocks of endometriomas obtained in both groups. For KRAS, PIK3CA, PPP2R1A, and ARID1A, cell staining intensity on a scale from 0 (negative) to 3 (strongly positive), and for HNF1β, the percentage of stained cells (0-5) and the intensity of staining (0-3) were scored.
KRAS, HNF1β, PIK3CA, PPP2R1A, and ARID1A were overexpressed in the case group samples compared with the endometrioma samples in the epithelial cells, and ARID1A and KRAS in the stroma were overexpressed in the case group samples compared with the matched control samples.
KRAS, HNF1β, PIK3CA, PPP2R1A, and ARID1A immunostaining scores in endometriomas previous to OCCC were significantly different than in endometriomas with no malignancy occurring in subsequent follow-ups, and were single predictors of OCCC. Hence, immunostaining with these biomarkers may be a method of identifying patients with endometrioma who have the potential to develop OCCC.
We have previously shown that cooperative, interdependent binding by the pioneer factors FoxO1 and FoxA1/2 is required for recruitment of RNA polymerase II and H3K27 acetylation to the promoters of insulin-regulated genes. However, the underlying mechanisms are unknown. In this study, we demonstrate that, in HepG2 cells, FoxO1 and FoxA2 form a complex on DNA that is disrupted by insulin treatment. Insulin-mediated phosphorylation of FoxO1 and FoxA2 does not impair their cooperative binding to mononucleosome particles assembled from the IGFBP1 promoter, indicating that direct disruption of complex formation by phosphorylation is not responsible for the loss of interdependent FoxO1:FoxA1/2 binding following insulin treatment. Since FoxO1 and FoxA1/2 binding is required for the establishment and maintenance of transcriptionally active chromatin at insulin-regulated genes, we hypothesized that cooperative FoxO1 and FoxA1/2 binding dictates the chromatin remodeling events required for the initial activation of these genes. In support of this idea, we demonstrate that FoxO1 and FoxA2 cooperatively open linker histone compacted chromatin templates containing the IGFBP1 promoter. Taken together, these results provide a mechanism for how interdependent FoxO1:FoxA1/2 binding is negatively impacted by insulin and provide a developmental context for cooperative gene activation by these factors.
Alzheimer's disease (AD) phenotype complexity raises the question whether genetic features remain unknown. Although a few percentage of patients are familial cases linked to mutations in amyloid precursor protein, presenilin 1 or presenilin 2 genes, the remainder are considered mainly sporadic late-onset cases with a complex etiology. However, changes in gene expression or other genetic features of the individual can clearly contribute to develop the illness. Consequently, in this paper we have focused on the identification of new genes, the expression of which is altered in AD. We used the technique of differential display reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (DDRT-PCR) in order to study the gene expression differences in brain tissue from patients in an advanced stage of AD. After studying medial septum and hippocampus brain areas, we found an inhibition of the KIAA0471 gene expression in three out of six AD patients, including one with a presenilin 1 gene mutation. This gene encodes for a large protein that presents, in its predicted form, 95% homology with IDN4-GGTR sequences. These results may provide significant clues for understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying septohippocampal neurodegeneration. In addition, they may open a new area of research for diagnostic and therapeutic tools, the relevance of which is also considered.
To identify the genes involved in esophageal carcinogenesis, we compared gene expression profiles in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) and matched normal esophageal epithelial tissues. Differential display analysis revealed significant changes in the expression of 26 genes; 21 genes were upregulated and 5 genes were downregulated. The differentially expressed genes included those associated with cellular metabolism, cell structure, transcription, proliferation, apoptosis, signal transduction, complement pathway, and cell-cell adhesion. The differential expression of these genes was confirmed by reverse Northern blot analysis. Reverse transcription PCR analysis of ESCC and matched normal esophageal tissues provided the first evidence that melanoma metastasis clone D (MEMD), a gene similar to oncostatin M receptor beta, and KIAA0471 gene products are upregulated in ESCCs. Intriguingly, KIAA0471, a novel gene product, is upregulated in esophageal tumors showing nodal invasion. Identification of these differentially expressed genes in esophageal tumors adds to the repertoire of genes associated with esophageal carcinogenesis and they may thus serve as potential novel molecular targets for diagnosis and therapy. Further characterization of known and unknown differentially expressed cDNAs identified in this study may provide significant clues for understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying esophageal tumorigenesis.
Rapid advances in multimodality therapy have not significantly improved the overall 5-yr survival of oral cancer patients in the past two decades, thereby underscoring the need for molecular therapeutics. The development of new treatment strategies for more effective management of oral cancer requires identification of novel biological targets. Therefore, the aim of this study was to identify novel genes associated with oral tumorigenesis by comparing gene expression profile of oral squamous cell carcinomas (OSCCs) and matched nonmalignant oral epithelial tissues with differential display. Of the 180 differentially expressed cDNAs isolated, reamplified, and cloned into pGEMT-Easy Vector, 26 cDNAs were confirmed to be upregulated in OSCCs by reverse Northern blot analysis. The differentially expressed genes included components of immune system, signaling pathways, angiogenesis, cell structure, proliferation, apoptosis, cell-adhesion, and cellular metabolism. Reverse transcription (RT)-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis of 15 OSCCs and matched nonmalignant oral tissues provided the first evidence that 14-3-3-zeta, melanoma metastasizing clone D (MEMD), KIAA0471, sperm protein 17 (SP17), TC21, and anti-TNF alpha antibody are upregulated in OSCCs. Immunohistochemical analysis confirmed overexpression of 14-3-3-zeta and TC21 protein, a member of the Ras family, in OSCCs as compared to histologically normal oral tissues validating the differential display analysis. Identification of six novel differentially expressed genes in oral tumors adds to the repertoire of genes associated with oral carcinogenesis and provides candidate potential biological targets for diagnosis and/or therapy. Further characterization of the 14 unknown differentially expressed cDNAs identified in this study may provide significant clues for understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying oral tumorigenesis.
We have reported on a patient with thrombocytopenia, impaired platelet aggregation, secretion, phosphorylation of pleckstrin and myosin light chain (MLC), and GPIIb-IIIa activation, associated with a heterozygous mutation in transcription factor CBFA2 (core binding factor A2, RUNX1 or AML1). To obtain insights into the abnormal platelet mechanisms and CBFA2-regulated genes, we performed platelet expression profiling in four control subjects and the patient using the Affymetrix U133 GeneChips. In the patient, 298 probe sets were significantly downregulated at least 2-fold. MLC regulatory polypeptide (MYL9 gene) was decreased approximately 77-fold; this is an important finding because agonist-stimulated MLC phosphorylation is decreased in patient platelets. Genes downregulated &gt; or = 5-fold include those involving calcium binding proteins (CABP5), ion transport (sodium/potassium/Ca exchanger, SLC24A3), cytoskeletal/microtubule proteins (erythrocyte membrane protein band 4.1-like 3, EPB41L3; tropomyosin 1, TPM1; tubulin, alpha 1, TUBA1), signaling proteins (RAB GTPase activating protein 1-like, RABGAP1L; beta3-endonexin, ITGB3 BP) and chemokines (platelet factor 4 variant 1, PF4V1; chemokine CXCL5, CXCL5). These and other downregulated genes are relevant to the patient's platelet defects in function and production. These studies provide the first proof of concept that platelet expression profiling can be applied to obtain insights into the molecular basis of inherited platelet defects.
The cortical scaffolding proteins EBP50 (ERM-binding phosphoprotein-50) and E3KARP (NHE3 kinase A regulatory protein) contain two PDZ (PSD-95/DlgA/ZO-1-like) domains followed by a COOH-terminal sequence that binds to active ERM family members. Using affinity chromatography, we identified polypeptides from placental microvilli that bind the PDZ domains of EBP50. Among these are 64- and/or 65-kD differentially phosphorylated polypeptides that bind preferentially to the first PDZ domain of EBP50, as well as to E3KARP, and that we call EPI64 (EBP50-PDZ interactor of 64 kD). The gene for human EPI64 lies on chromosome 22 where nine exons specify a protein of 508 residues that contains a Tre/Bub2/Cdc16 (TBC)/rab GTPase-activating protein (GAP) domain. EPI64 terminates in DTYL, which is necessary for binding to the PDZ domains of EBP50, as a mutant ending in DTYLA no longer interacts. EPI64 colocalizes with EBP50 and ezrin in syncytiotrophoblast and cultured cell microvilli, and this localization in cultured cells is abolished by introduction of the DTYLA mutation. In addition to EPI64, immobilized EBP50 PDZ domains retain several polypeptides from placental microvilli, including an isoform of nadrin, a rhoGAP domain-containing protein implicated in regulating vesicular transport. Nadrin binds EBP50 directly, probably through its COOH-terminal STAL sequence. Thus, EBP50 appears to bind membrane proteins as well as factors potentially involved in regulating membrane traffic.
Endosomal membrane trafficking requires coordination between phosphoinositide lipids, Rab GTPases, and microtubule-based motors to dynamically determine endosome identity and promote long-range organelle transport. Here we report that ankyrin-B (AnkB), through integrating all three systems, functions as a critical node in the protein circuitry underlying polarized recycling of α5β1-integrin in mouse embryonic fibroblasts, which enables persistent fibroblast migration along fibronectin gradients. AnkB associates with phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PI3P)-positive organelles in fibroblasts and binds dynactin to promote their long-range motility. We demonstrate that AnkB binds to Rab GTPase Activating Protein 1-Like (RabGAP1L) and recruits it to PI3P-positive organelles, where RabGAP1L inactivates Rab22A, and promotes polarized trafficking to the leading edge of migrating fibroblasts. We further determine that α5β1-integrin depends on an AnkB/RabGAP1L complex for polarized recycling. Our results reveal AnkB as an unexpected key element in coordinating polarized transport of α5β1-integrin and likely of other specialized endocytic cargos.
Lamellar bodies (LBs) are tubulovesicular secretory organelles of epithelial cells related to lysosomes. In the epidermis, they play a crucial role in permeability barrier homeostasis, secreting their contents, lipids, a variety of hydrolases, protease inhibitors, and antimicrobial peptides, in the upper keratinocyte layers. The identification of proteins transported in epidermal LBs is still far from complete, and the way their secretion is controlled unknown. In this study, we describe the first proteomics characterization by nano-LC-MS/MS of a fraction enriched in epidermal LBs. We identified 984 proteins, including proteins known or thought to be secreted by LBs. Moreover 31 proteins corresponded to lysosomal components further suggesting that LBs are a new class of secretory lysosomes. Many of the newly found proteins could play a role in the epidermal barrier and desquamation (one acid ceramidase-like protein, apolipoproteins, glycosidases, protease inhibitors, and peptidases) and in LB trafficking (e.g. Rab, Arf, and motor complex proteins). We focus here on CLIP-170/restin, a protein that mediates interactions between organelles and microtubules. Western blotting confirmed the presence of CLIP-170 and its known effectors IQGAP1 and Cdc42 in the LB-enriched fraction. We showed, by confocal microscopy analysis of skin cryosections, that CLIP-170 was expressed in differentiated keratinocytes, first at the periphery of the nucleus then with a granular cytoplasmic labeling evocative of LBs. It was preferentially co-localized with Cdc42 and with the known LB protein cathepsin D. CLIP-170 was also largely co-localized with Rab7. This study strongly suggests a new function for CLIP-170, its involvement together with Cdc42 and/or Rab7 in the intracellular trafficking of LBs, and provides evidence that nano-LC-MS/MS combined with monodimensional electrophoresis separation constitutes a powerful method for identifying proteins in a complex mixture such as subcellular structures.
AS160 (Akt substrate of 160 kDa) and TBC1D1 are related RabGAPs (Rab GTPase-activating proteins) implicated in regulating the trafficking of GLUT4 (glucose transporter 4) storage vesicles to the cell surface. All animal species examined contain TBC1D1, whereas AS160 evolved with the vertebrates. TBC1D1 has two clusters of phosphorylated residues, either side of the second PTB (phosphotyrosine-binding domain). Each cluster contains a 14-3-3-binding site. When AMPK (AMP-activated protein kinase) is activated in HEK (human embryonic kidney)-293 cells, 14-3-3s bind primarily to pSer237 (where pSer is phosphorylated serine) in TBC1D1, whereas 14-3-3 binding depends primarily on pThr596 (where pThr is phosphorylated threonine) in cells stimulated with IGF-1 (insulin-like growth factor 1), EGF (epidermal growth factor) and PMA; and both pSer237 and pThr596 contribute to 14-3-3 binding in cells stimulated with forskolin. In HEK-293 cells, LY294002 inhibits phosphorylation of Thr596 of TBC1D1, and promotes phosphorylation of AMPK and Ser237 of TBC1D1. In vitro phosphorylation experiments indicated regulatory interactions among phosphorylated sites, for example phosphorylation of Ser235 prevents subsequent phosphorylation of Ser237. In rat L6 myotubes, endogenous TBC1D1 is strongly phosphorylated on Ser237 and binds to 14-3-3s in response to the AMPK activators AICAR (5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide-1-b-D-ribofuranoside), phenformin and A-769662, whereas insulin promotes phosphorylation of Thr596 but not 14-3-3 binding. In contrast, AS160 is phosphorylated on its 14-3-3-binding sites (Ser341 and Thr642) and binds to 14-3-3s in response to insulin, but not A-769662, in L6 cells. These findings suggest that TBC1D1 and AS160 may have complementary roles in regulating vesicle trafficking in response to insulin and AMPK-activating stimuli in skeletal muscle.
The Evi5 oncogene has recently been shown to regulate the stability and accumulation of critical G(1) cell cycle factors including Emi1, an inhibitor of the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome, and cyclin A. Sequence analysis of the amino terminus of Evi5 reveals a Tre-2, Bub2, Cdc16 domain, which has been shown to be a binding partner and GTPase-activating protein domain for the Rab family of small Ras-like GTPases. Here we describe the identification of Evi5 as a candidate binding protein for Rab11, a GTPase that regulates intracellular transport and has specific roles in endosome recycling and cytokinesis. By yeast two-hybrid analysis, immunoprecipitation, and Biacore analysis, we demonstrate that Evi5 binds Rab11a and Rab11b in a GTP-dependent manner. However, Evi5 displays no activation of Rab11 GTPase activity in vitro. Evi5 colocalizes with Rab11 in vivo, and overexpression of Rab11 perturbs the localization of Evi5, redistributing it into Rab11-positive recycling endosomes. Interestingly, in vitro binding studies show that Rab11 effector proteins including FIP3 compete with Evi5 for binding to Rab11, suggesting a partitioning between Rab11-Evi5 and Rab11 effector complexes. Indeed, ablation of Evi5 by RNA interference causes a mislocalization of FIP3 at the abscission site during cytokinesis. These data demonstrate that Evi5 is a Rab11 binding protein and that Evi5 may cooperate with Rab11 to coordinate vesicular trafficking, cytokinesis, and cell cycle control independent of GTPase-activating protein function.
It has recently been proposed that the TBC (Tre2/Bub2/Cdc16) domain functions as a GAP (GTPase-activating protein) domain for small GTPase Rab. Because of the large number of Rab proteins in mammals, however, most TBC domains have never been investigated for Rab-GAP activity. In this study we established panels of the GTP-fixed form of 60 different Rabs constructed in pGAD-C1, a yeast two-hybrid bait vector. We also constructed a yeast two-hybrid prey vector (pGBDU-C1) that harbors the cDNA of 40 distinct TBC proteins. Systematic investigation of 2400 combinations of 60 GTP-fixed Rabs and 40 TBC proteins by yeast two-hybrid screening revealed that seven TBC proteins specifically and differentially interact with specific Rabs (e.g. OATL1 interacts with Rab2A; FLJ12085 with Rab5A/B/C; and Evi5-like with Rab10). Measurement of in vitro Rab-GAP activity revealed that OATL1 and Evi5-like actually possess significant Rab2A- and Rab10-GAP activity, respectively, but that FLJ12085 do not display Rab5A-GAP activity at all. These results indicate that specific interaction between TBC protein and Rab would be a useful indicator for screening for the target Rabs of some TBC/Rab-GAP domains, but that there is little correlation between the Rab-binding activity and Rab-GAP activity of other TBC proteins.
Phosphoinositides regulate a wide range of cellular activities, including membrane trafficking and biogenesis, via interaction with various effector proteins that contain phosphoinositide binding motifs. We show that in the yeast Pichia pastoris, phosphatidylinositol 4'-monophosphate (PI4P) initiates de novo membrane synthesis that is required for peroxisome degradation by selective autophagy and that this PI4P signaling is modulated by an ergosterol-converting PpAtg26 (autophagy-related) protein harboring a novel PI4P binding GRAM (glucosyltransferase, Rab-like GTPase activators, and myotubularins) domain. A phosphatidylinositol-4-OH kinase, PpPik1, is the primary source of PI4P. PI4P concentrated in a protein-lipid nucleation complex recruits PpAtg26 through an interaction with the GRAM domain. Sterol conversion by PpAtg26 at the nucleation complex is necessary for elongation and maturation of the membrane structure. This study reveals the role of the PI4P-signaling pathway in selective autophagy, a process comprising multistep molecular events that lead to the de novo membrane formation.
The Ypt/Rab family of small G-proteins is important in regulating vesicular transport. Rabs hydrolyze GTP very slowly on their own and require GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs). Here we report the identification and characterization of OsGAP1, a Rab-specific rice GAP. OsGAP1 strongly stimulated OsRab8a and OsRab11, which are homologs of the mammalian Rab8 and Rab11 proteins that are essential for Golgi to plasma membrane (PM) and trans-Golgi network (TGN) to PM trafficking, respectively. Substitution of two invariant arginines within the catalytic domain of Oryza sativa GTPase-activating protein 1 (OsGAP1) with alanines significantly inhibited its GAP activity. In vivo targeting experiments revealed that OsGAP1 localizes to the TGN or pre-vacuolar compartment (PVC). A yeast expression system demonstrated that wild-type OsGAP1 facilitates O. sativa dissociation inhibitor 3 (OsGDI3)-catalyzed OsRab11 recycling at an early stage, but the OsGAP1(R385A) and (R450A) mutants do not. Thus, GTP hydrolysis is essential for Rab recycling. Moreover, expression of the OsGAP1 mutants in Arabidopsis protoplasts inhibited the trafficking of some cargo proteins, including the PM-localizing H+-ATPase-green fluorescent protein (GFP) and Ca2+-ATPase8-GFP and the central vacuole-localizing Arabidopsis aleurain-like protein (AALP)-GFP. The OsGAP1 mutants caused these proteins to accumulate at the Golgi apparatus. Surprisingly, OsRab11 overproduction relieved the inhibitory effect of the OsGAP1 mutants on vesicular trafficking. OsRab8a had no such effect. Thus, the OsGAP1 mutants may inhibit TGN to PM or central vacuole trafficking because they induce the sequestration of endogenous Rab11. We propose that OsGAP1 facilitates vesicular trafficking from the TGN to the PM or central vacuole by both stimulating the GTPase activity of OsRab11 and increasing the recycling of inactive OsRab11.
The regulation of cellular membrane flux is poorly understood. Yeast respond to hypertonic stress by fragmentation of the normally large, low copy vacuole. We used this phenomenon as the basis for an in vivo screen to identify regulators of vacuole membrane dynamics. We report here that maintenance of the fragmented phenotype requires the vacuolar casein kinase I Yck3: when Yck3 is absent, salt-stressed vacuoles undergo fission, but reassemble in a SNARE-dependent manner, suggesting that vacuole fusion is disregulated. Accordingly, when Yck3 is deleted, in vitro vacuole fusion is increased, and Yck3 overexpression blocks fusion. Morphological and functional studies show that Yck3 modulates the Rab/homotypic fusion and vacuole protein sorting complex (HOPS)-dependent tethering stage of vacuole fusion. Intriguingly, Yck3 mediates phosphorylation of the HOPS subunit Vps41, a bi-functional protein involved in both budding and fusion during vacuole biogenesis. Because Yck3 also promotes efficient vacuole inheritance, we propose that tethering complex phosphorylation is a part of a general, switch-like mechanism for driving changes in organelle architecture.
HERC1 is a giant multidomain protein involved in membrane trafficking through its interaction with vesicle coat proteins such as clathrin and ARF. Previously, it has been shown that the RCC1-like domain 1 (RLD1) of HERC1 stimulates guanine nucleotide dissociation on ARF1 and Rab proteins. In this study, we have analyzed whether HERC1 may also regulate ARF6 activity. We show that HERC1, through its RLD1, stimulates GDP release from ARF6 but, unexpectedly, it inhibits GDP/GTP exchange on ARF6 under conditions where ARNO stimulates it. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the activity of HERC1 as a guanine nucleotide release factor requires the presence of PI(4,5)P(2) bound to HERC1's RLD1. In agreement with this, we find that purified HERC1 contains PI(4,5)P(2) bound to the RLD1.
Yeast cells of different cell type exhibit distinct budding patterns that reflect the organization of the actin cytoskeleton. Bud1p (Rsr1p), a Ras-like GTPase, and Bud2p, a GTPase-activating protein for Bud1p, are essential for proper budding pattern. We show that Bud2p is localized at the presumptive bud site in G(1) cells in all cell types and that this localization is independent of Bud1p. Bud2p subsequently localizes to the mother-bud neck after bud emergence; this localization depends on the integrity of the septins. These observations indicate that Bud2p becomes positioned in G(1) cells by recognizing cell type-specific landmarks at the presumptive bud site.
Small GTPases of the Ypt/Rab family are regulators of vesicular protein trafficking in exo-and endocytosis. GTPase-activating proteins (GAP) play an important role as down regulators of GTPases. We here report the molecular cloning of a novel GAP-encoding gene (GYP7, for GAP for Ypt7) by high expression from a Saccharomyces cerevisiae genomic library. The GYP7 gene encodes a hydrophilic protein with a molecular mass of 87 kDa. Comparison of its primary sequence with that of the three other known GAPs for transport GTPases, the yeast Gyp6 and Gyp1 proteins and the Rab3A-GAP from rat brain, shows similarity between the yeast GAPs only. Like GYP6 and GYP1, GYP7 is not essential for yeast cell viability. Gyp7p was able to most effectively accelerate the intrinsic GTPase activity of Ypt7p. It was also active, but to a lesser extent, on Ypt31p, Ypt32p and Ypt1p. Ypt6p, Sec4p and the human H-Ras protein did not serve as substrates. We also report the identification and cloning of a gene from the dimorphic yeast Yarrowia lipolytica that encodes a protein whose primary structure and biochemical activity are significantly related to those of Gyp7p from baker's yeast.
Recent extensive studies have clarified the functions of the small G protein superfamily, which consists of the Ras, Rho, Rab, Arf, Sar1, and Ran families (for reviews, Refs, 1 and 2). The Ras family regulates gene expression at least through the MAP kinase cascade; the Rho family mainly regulates reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton; the Rab, Arf, and Sar1 families regulate intracellular vesicle trafficking; and the Ran family regulates nuclear transport. Of these cellular functions, reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton, seen in the formation of filopodia, lamellipodia, and ruffles during cell motility, dynamically occurs at specific sites of cells. To regulate this type of dynamic cellular functions, temporal and spatial determination mechanisms of signal transduction would be important. Like other G proteins, small G proteins cycle between the GDP-bound inactive and GTP-bound active forms (1,2). They receive upstream signals through their regulators and transduce signals to downstream targets while they stay in the GTP-bound form. Thus, G proteins serve as timers. There are at least three types of regulators for small G proteins: GDP/GTP exchange protein (GEP) which stimulates conversion from the GDP-bound form to the GTP-bound form; GDP dissociation inhibitor (GDI) which inhibits this reaction; and GTPase activating protein (GAP) which stimulates conversion from the GTP-bound form to the GDP-bound form. Of these regulators, GDI has thus far been found for the Rho and Rab families. We have recently found that the Rho family-Rho GDI system plays an important role in spatial determination in the actin cytoskeletal control (3-6). We briefly describe here this function of the Rho family-Rho GDI system.
Ran, a small soluble GTP-binding protein, has been shown to be essential for the nuclear translocation of proteins and it is also thought to be involved in regulating cell cycle progression in mammalian and yeast cells. Genes encoding Ran-like proteins have been isolated from different higher plant species. Overexpression of plant Ran cDNAs, similarly to their mammalian/yeast homologues, suppresses the phenotype of the pim46-1 cell cycle mutant in yeast cells. The mammalian/yeast Ran proteins have been shown to interact with a battery of Ran-binding proteins, including the guanidine nucleotide exchange factor RCC1, the GTPase-activating Ran-GAP, nucleoporins and other Ran-binding proteins (RanBPs) specific for Ran-GTP. Here, the characterization of the first Ran-binding proteins from higher plants is reported. The yeast two-hybrid system was used to isolate cDNA clones encoding proteins of approximately 28 kDa (At-RanBP1a, At-RanBP1b) that interact with the GTP-bound forms of the Ran1, Ran2 and Ran3 proteins of Arabidopsis thaliana. The deduced amino acid sequences of the At-RanBP1s display high similarity (60%) to mammalian/yeast RanBP1 proteins and contain the characteristic Ran-binding domains. Furthermore, interaction of the plant Ran and RanBP1 proteins, is shown to require the acidic C-terminal domain (-DEDDDL) of Ran proteins in addition to the presence of an intact Ran-binding domain. In whole cell extracts, the GST-RanBP1a fusion protein binds specifically to GTP-Ran and will not interact with Rab/Ypt-type small GTP-binding proteins. Finally, in good agreement with their proposed biological function, the At-Ran and the At-RanBP genes are expressed coordinately and show the highest level of expression in meristematic tissues.
Previous studies have demonstrated that Sec4, a 23.5 kDa guanine nucleotide-binding protein of the ras superfamily is required for exocytosis in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Ypt1, another ras-like 23 kDa guanine nucleotide-binding protein in yeast has been found to be involved in ER-Golgi transport. A mammalian homologue of Ypt1 called rab1 has also been identified. Recent studies using purified Sec4 protein have identified a component of yeast lystate that specifically stimulates the hydrolysis of GTP bound to Sec4. In the present study, purified recombinant Sec4 and Ypt1 proteins expressed in E. coli have been used as substrates to determine if GTPase activating proteins (GAPs) directed toward these proteins are present in rat pancreas. Our studies showed that 65% of Sec4-GAP activity was associated with the 150,000 x g pancreatic particulate fraction with approximately 35% being found in the cytosol. On the other hand, more than 95% of Ypt1-GAP activity was found to associate with the particulate fraction. Sec4 and Ypt1 competition assays further demonstrated the specificity of the Sec4 and Ypt1 GAPs. The results from the present study suggest the presence of a distinct GAP in the pancreas that interacts with Sec4, and another that interacts with Ypt1.
Leucine-rich repeats (LRRs) are 20-29-residue sequence motifs present in a number of proteins with diverse functions. The primary function of these motifs appears to be to provide a versatile structural framework for the formation of protein-protein interactions. The past two years have seen an explosion of new structural information on proteins with LRRs. The new structures represent different LRR subfamilies and proteins with diverse functions, including GTPase-activating protein rna1p from the ribonuclease-inhibitor-like subfamily; spliceosomal protein U2A', Rab geranylgeranyltransferase, internalin B, dynein light chain 1 and nuclear export protein TAP from the SDS22-like subfamily; Skp2 from the cysteine-containing subfamily; and YopM from the bacterial subfamily. The new structural information has increased our understanding of the structural determinants of LRR proteins and our ability to model such proteins with unknown structures, and has shed new light on how these proteins participate in protein-protein interactions.
Small G proteins of the Rab family are regulators of intracellular vesicle traffic. Their intrinsic rate of GTP hydrolysis is very low but is enhanced by specific GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) that switch G proteins to their inactive form. We have characterized the activity of recombinant Rab3-GAP on Rab3A in solution. The K(m) and K(d) values (75 microm) indicate a low affinity of Rab3-GAP for its substrate. The affinity is higher for the transition state analog Rab3A:GDP:AlF(x) (15 microm). The k(cat) (1 s(-)(1)) is within the range of values reported for other GAPs. A mutation in the switch I region of Rab3A disrupted the interaction with Rab3-GAP. Furthermore, Rabphilin, a putative target of Rab3, inhibited the activity of Rab3-GAP on Rab3. Therefore, the Rab3-GAP-binding site involves the switch I region of Rab3 and overlaps with the Rabphilin-binding domain. Substitution of a single arginine residue (Arg-728) of Rab3-GAP disrupted its catalytic activity but not its interaction with Rab3A. We propose that Rab3-GAP, like Ras- and Rho-GAPs, stabilizes the transition state of Rab3 and provides a critical arginine residue to accelerate the GTPase reaction.
Structural and biochemical data indicate the importance of the phosphate-binding loop residues Gly(12) and Gly(13) of Ras both in the GTP hydrolysis reaction and in biological activity, but these two residues are not conserved in other Ras-related GTPases. To gain a better understanding of this region in GTP hydrolysis and GTPase function, we used the Ras-related Rab5 GTPase as a model for comparison, and substituted the Ala(30) residue (the equivalent of Gly(13) of Ras) with all the other 19 amino acids. The resulting mutants were analysed for GTP hydrolysis, GTP binding, GTP dissociation and biological activity. Only the substitution of alanine with proline reduced the GTPase activity by an order of magnitude. This effect is in sharp contrast with the observation that a proline substitution at the neighbouring position (Gly(12) of Ras) has little effect on the GTPase activity. Whereas most other substitutions showed either a small negative effect or no effect on the GTPase activity, the arginine substitution surprisingly stimulated the GTPase activity by 5-fold. Molecular modelling suggests that this built-in arginine mimics the catalytic arginine residues found in trimeric GTPases and GTPase-activating proteins in providing the positive charge to facilitate the GTP hydrolysis reaction. We investigated further the biological activity of the Rab5 mutants in relation to stimulating endocytosis. When expressed in cultured baby hamster kidney cells, both arginine and proline mutants, like wild-type Rab5, stimulated endocytosis. However, the arginine mutant was a more potent stimulator than the proline mutant (3-fold stimulation as against 1.7-fold). The tryptophan mutant, on the other hand, was completely deficient in activity in terms of the stimulation of endocytosis, demonstrating the importance of the phosphate-binding loop in Rab GTPase function.
Ypt/Rab proteins constitute the largest subfamily of the Ras superfamily of monomeric GTPases and are regulators of vesicular protein transport. Their slow intrinsic GTPase activity (10(-4)-10(-3) min(-1) at 30 degrees C) has to be accelerated to switch the active to the inactive conformation. We have identified the catalytic domain within the C-terminal halves of two yeast GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs), Gyp1p and Gyp7p, with specificity for Ypt/Rab GTPases. The catalytically active fragments of Gyp1p and Gyp7p were more active than the full-length proteins and accelerated the intrinsic GTP hydrolysis rates of their preferred substrates by factors of 4.5 x 10(4) and 7.8 x 10(5), respectively. The K(m) values for the Gyp1p and Gyp7p active fragments (143 and 42 microM, respectively) indicate that the affinities of those GAPs for their substrates are very low. The catalytic domains of Gyp1p and Gyp7p contain five invariant arginine residues; substitutions of only one of them (R343 in Gyp1p and R458 in the analogous position of Gyp7p) rendered the GAPs almost completely inactive. We suggest that Ypt/Rab-GAPs, like Ras- and Rho-GAPs, follow the same mode of action and provide a catalytic arginine ('arginine finger') in trans to accelerate the GTP hydrolysis rate of the transport GTPases.
Two cell type-specific Rab proteins, Rab32 and Rab38 (Rab32/38), have been proposed as regulating the trafficking of melanogenic enzymes, including tyrosinase and tyrosinase-related protein 1 (Tyrp1), to melanosomes in melanocytes. Like other GTPases, Rab32/38 function as switch molecules that cycle between a GDP-bound inactive form and a GTP-bound active form; the cycle is thought to be regulated by an activating enzyme, guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF), and an inactivating enzyme, GTPase-activating protein (GAP), which stimulates the GTPase activity of Rab32/38. Although BLOC-3 has already been identified as a Rab32/38-specific GEF that regulates the trafficking of tyrosinase and Tyrp1, no physiological GAP for Rab32/38 in melanocytes has ever been identified, and it has remained unclear whether Rab32/38 is involved in the trafficking of dopachrome tautomerase, another melanogenic enzyme, in mouse melanocytes. In this study we investigated RUTBC1, which was originally characterized as a Rab9-binding protein and GAP for Rab32 and Rab33B in vitro, and the results demonstrated that RUTBC1 functions as a physiological GAP for Rab32/38 in the trafficking of all three melanogenic enzymes in mouse melanocytes. The results of this study also demonstrated the involvement of Rab9A in the regulation of the RUTBC1 localization and in the trafficking of all three melanogenic enzymes. We discovered that either excess activation or inactivation of Rab32/38 achieved by manipulating RUTBC1 inhibits the trafficking of all three melanogenic enzymes. These results collectively indicate that proper spatiotemporal regulation of Rab32/38 is essential for the trafficking of all three melanogenic enzymes in mouse melanocytes. 
Rab proteins represent the largest branch of the Ras-like small GTPase superfamily and there are 66 Rab genes in the human genome. They alternate between GTP- and GDP-bound states, which are facilitated by guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) and GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs), and function as molecular switches in regulation of intracellular membrane trafficking in all eukaryotic cells. Each Rab targets to an organelle and specify a transport step along exocytic, endocytic, and recycling pathways as well as the crosstalk between these pathways. Through interactions with multiple effectors temporally, a Rab can control membrane budding and formation of transport vesicles, vesicle movement along cytoskeleton, and membrane fusion at the target compartment. The large number of Rab proteins reflects the complexity of the intracellular transport system, which is essential for the localization and function of membrane and secretory proteins such as hormones, growth factors, and their membrane receptors. As such, Rab proteins have emerged as important regulators for signal transduction, cell growth, and differentiation. Altered Rab expression and/or activity have been implicated in diseases ranging from neurological disorders, diabetes to cancer. 
Rab GTPases play a crucial role in the regulation of many intracellular membrane trafficking pathways including endocytosis and ciliogenesis. Rab GTPase activating proteins (RabGAPs) increase the GTP hydrolysis rate of Rab GTPases and turn them into guanine nucleotide diphosphate (GDP) bound inactive form. Here, we determined the crystal structure of the putative catalytic domain of a RabGAP (which we name CrfRabGAP) that is found in the flagellar proteome of the unicellular green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. BLAST searches revealed potential human orthologues of CrfRabGAP as TBC1D3 and TBC1D26. Sequence and structural comparison with other canonical RabGAPs revealed that the CrfRabGAP does not contain the canonical catalytic residues required for the activation of Rab GTPases. The function of noncanonical RabGAPs-like CrfRabGAP might be to serve as Rab effectors rather than activators.
Co-ordination of Rab GTPase function has emerged as a crucial mechanism in the control of intracellular trafficking processes in eukaryotic cells. Here, we show that GRAB/Rab3IL1 [guanine nucleotide exchange factor for Rab3A; RAB3A interacting protein (rabin3)-like 1], a protein that has previously be shown to act as a GEF (guanine nucleotide exchange factor) for Rab3a, Rab8a and Rab8b, is also a binding partner for Rab11a and Rab11b, but not the closely related Rab25 GTPase. We demonstrate that exogenous expression of Rab11a and Rab11b shift GRAB's distribution from the cytoplasm onto membranes. We find that the Rab11a/Rab11b-binding region of GRAB lies within its carboxy-terminus, a region distinct from its GEF domain and Rab3a-binding region. Finally, we describe a GRAB deletion mutant (GRABΔ223-228) that is deficient in Rab11-binding ability. These data identify GRAB as a dual Rab-binding protein that could potentially link Rab3 and Rab11 and/or Rab8 and Rab11-mediated intracellular trafficking processes.
Small GTPases use GDP/GTP alternation to actuate a variety of functional switches that are pivotal for cell dynamics. The GTPase switch is turned on by GEFs, which stimulate dissociation of the tightly bound GDP, and turned off by GAPs, which accelerate the intrinsically sluggish hydrolysis of GTP. For Ras, Rho, and Rab GTPases, this switch incorporates a membrane/cytosol alternation regulated by GDIs and GDI-like proteins. The structures and core mechanisms of representative members of small GTPase regulators from most families have now been elucidated, illuminating their general traits combined with scores of unique features. Recent studies reveal that small GTPase regulators have themselves unexpectedly sophisticated regulatory mechanisms, by which they process cellular signals and build up specific cell responses. These mechanisms include multilayered autoinhibition with stepwise release, feedback loops mediated by the activated GTPase, feed-forward signaling flow between regulators and effectors, and a phosphorylation code for RhoGDIs. The flipside of these highly integrated functions is that they make small GTPase regulators susceptible to biochemical abnormalities that are directly correlated with diseases, notably a striking number of missense mutations in congenital diseases, and susceptible to bacterial mimics of GEFs, GAPs, and GDIs that take command of small GTPases in infections. This review presents an overview of the current knowledge of these many facets of small GTPase regulation.
The tripartite DENN module, comprised of a N-terminal longin domain, followed by DENN, and d-DENN domains, is a GDP-GTP exchange factor (GEFs) for Rab GTPases, which are regulators of practically all membrane trafficking events in eukaryotes. Using sequence and structure analysis we identify multiple novel homologs of the DENN module, many of which can be traced back to the ancestral eukaryote. These findings provide unexpected leads regarding key cellular processes such as autophagy, vesicle-vacuole interactions, chromosome segregation, and human disease. Of these, SMCR8, the folliculin interacting protein-1 and 2 (FNIP1 and FNIP2), nitrogen permease regulator 2 (NPR2), and NPR3 are proposed to function in recruiting Rab GTPases during different steps of autophagy, fusion of autophagosomes with the vacuole and regulation of cellular metabolism. Another novel DENN protein identified in this study is C9ORF72; expansions of the hexanucleotide GGGGCC in its first intron have been recently implicated in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and fronto-temporal dementia (FTD). While this mutation is proposed to cause a RNA-level defect, the identification of C9ORF72 as a potential DENN-type GEF raises the possibility that at least part of the pathology might relate to a specific Rab-dependent vesicular trafficking process, as has been observed in the case of some other neurological conditions with similar phenotypes. We present evidence that the longin domain, such as those found in the DENN module, are likely to have been ultimately derived from the related domains found in prokaryotic GTPase-activating proteins of MglA-like GTPases. Thus, the origin of the longin domains from this ancient GTPase-interacting domain, concomitant with the radiation of GTPases, especially of the Rab clade, played an important role in the dynamics of eukaryotic intracellular membrane systems.
Lysosomes provide a niche for molecular digestion and are a convergence point for endocytic trafficking, phagosome maturation and autophagy. Typically, lysosomes are small, globular organelles that appear punctate under the fluorescence microscope. However, activating agents like phorbol esters transform macrophage lysosomes into tubular lysosomes (TLs), which have been implicated in retention of pinocytic uptake and phagosome maturation. Moreover, dendritic cells exposed to lipopolysaccharides (LPSs) convert their punctate class II major histocompatibility complex compartment, a lysosome-related organelle, into a tubular network that is thought to be involved in antigen presentation. Other than a requirement for microtubules and kinesin, little is known about the molecular mechanisms that drive lysosome tubulation. Here, we show that macrophage cell lines readily form TLs after LPS exposure, with a requirement for the Rab7 GTPase and its effectors RILP (Rab7-interacting lysosomal protein) and FYCO1 (coiled-coil domain-containing protein 1), which respectively modulate the dynein and kinesin microtubule motor proteins. We also show that Arl8B, a recently identified lysosomal GTPase, and its effector SKIP, are also important for TL biogenesis. Finally, we reveal that TLs are significantly more motile than punctate lysosomes within the same LPS-treated cells. Therefore, we identify the first molecular regulators of lysosome tubulation and we show that TLs represent a more dynamic lysosome population.
The internalization of essential nutrients, lipids and receptors is a crucial process for all eukaryotic cells. Accordingly, endocytosis is highly conserved across cell types and species. Once internalized, small cargo-containing vesicles fuse with early endosomes (also known as sorting endosomes), where they undergo segregation to distinct membrane regions and are sorted and transported on through the endocytic pathway. Although the mechanisms that regulate this sorting are still poorly understood, some receptors are directed to late endosomes and lysosomes for degradation, whereas other receptors are recycled back to the plasma membrane; either directly or through recycling endosomes. The Rab family of small GTP-binding proteins plays crucial roles in regulating these trafficking pathways. Rabs cycle from inactive GDP-bound cytoplasmic proteins to active GTP-bound membrane-associated proteins, as a consequence of the activity of multiple specific GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) and GTP exchange factors (GEFs). Once bound to GTP, Rabs interact with a multitude of effector proteins that carry out Rab-specific functions. Recent studies have shown that some of these effectors are also interaction partners for the C-terminal Eps15 homology (EHD) proteins, which are also intimately involved in endocytic regulation. A particularly interesting example of common Rab-EHD interaction partners is the MICAL-like protein, MICAL-L1. MICAL-L1 and its homolog, MICAL-L2, belong to the larger MICAL family of proteins, and both have been directly implicated in regulating endocytic recycling of cell surface receptors and junctional proteins, as well as controlling cytoskeletal rearrangement and neurite outgrowth. In this review, we summarize the functional roles of MICAL and Rab proteins, and focus on the significance of their interactions and the implications for endocytic transport.
Mutations of the inositol 5' phosphatase oculocerebrorenal syndrome of Lowe (OCRL) give rise to the congenital X-linked disorders oculocerebrorenal syndrome of Lowe and Dent disease, two conditions giving rise to abnormal kidney proximal tubule reabsorption, and additional nervous system and ocular defects in the case of Lowe syndrome. Here, we identify two closely related endocytic proteins, Ses1 and Ses2, which interact with the ASH-RhoGAP-like (ASPM-SPD-2-Hydin homology and Rho-GTPase Activating Domain-like) domain of OCRL. The interaction is mediated by a short amino acid motif similar to that used by the rab-5 effector APPL1 (Adaptor Protein containing pleckstrin homology [PH] domain, PTB domain and Leucine zipper motif 1) APPL1 for OCRL binding. Ses binding is mutually exclusive with APPL1 binding, and is disrupted by the same missense mutations in the ASH-RhoGAP-like domain that also disrupt APPL1 binding. Like APPL1, Ses1 and -2 are localized on endosomes but reside on different endosomal subpopulations. These findings define a consensus motif (which we have called a phenylalanine and histidine [F&amp;H] motif) for OCRL binding and are consistent with a scenario in which Lowe syndrome and Dent disease result from perturbations at multiple sites within the endocytic pathway.
Macrophages are important immune sentinels that detect and clear pathogens and initiate inflammatory responses through the activation of surface receptors, including Toll-like receptors (TLRs). Activated TLRs employ complex cellular trafficking and signalling pathways to initiate transcription for inflammatory cytokine programs. We have previously shown that Rab8a is activated by multiple TLRs and regulates downstream Akt/mTOR signalling by recruiting the effector PI3Kγ, but the guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEF) canonically required for Rab8a activation in TLR pathways is not known. Using GST affinity pull-downs and mass spectrometry analysis, we identified a Rab8 specific GEF, GRAB, as a Rab8a binding partner in LPS-activated macrophages. Co-immunoprecipitation and fluorescence microscopy showed that both GRAB and a structurally similar GEF, Rabin8, undergo LPS-inducible binding to Rab8a and are localised on cell surface ruffles and macropinosomes where they coincide with sites of Rab8a mediated signalling. Rab nucleotide activation assays with CRISPR-Cas9 mediated knock-out (KO) cell lines of GRAB, Rabin8 and double KOs showed that both GEFs contribute to TLR4 induced Rab8a GTP loading, but not membrane recruitment. In addition, measurement of signalling profiles and live cell imaging with the double KOs revealed that either GEF is individually sufficient to mediate PI3Kγ-dependent Akt/mTOR signalling at macropinosomes during TLR4-driven inflammation, suggesting a redundant relationship between these proteins. Thus, both GRAB and Rabin8 are revealed as key positive regulators of Rab8a nucleotide exchange for TLR signalling and inflammatory programs. These GEFs may be useful as potential targets for manipulating inflammation.

Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) is the fifth leading cause of cancer mortality in American women. Normal ovarian physiology is intricately connected to small GTP binding proteins of the Ras superfamily (Ras, Rho, Rab, Arf, and Ran) which govern processes such as signal transduction, cell proliferation, cell motility, and vesicle transport. We hypothesized that common germline variation in genes encoding small GTPases is associated with EOC risk. We investigated 322 variants in 88 small GTPase genes in germline DNA of 18,736 EOC patients and 26,138 controls of European ancestry using a custom genotype array and logistic regression fitting log-additive models. Functional annotation was used to identify biofeatures and expression quantitative trait loci that intersect with risk variants. One variant, ARHGEF10L (Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor 10 like) rs2256787, was associated with increased endometrioid EOC risk (OR = 1.33, p = 4.46 x 10-6). Other variants of interest included another in ARHGEF10L, rs10788679, which was associated with invasive serous EOC risk (OR = 1.07, p = 0.00026) and two variants in AKAP6 (A-kinase anchoring protein 6) which were associated with risk of invasive EOC (rs1955513, OR = 0.90, p = 0.00033; rs927062, OR = 0.94, p = 0.00059). Functional annotation revealed that the two ARHGEF10L variants were located in super-enhancer regions and that AKAP6 rs927062 was associated with expression of GTPase gene ARHGAP5 (Rho GTPase activating protein 5). Inherited variants in ARHGEF10L and AKAP6, with potential transcriptional regulatory function and association with EOC risk, warrant investigation in independent EOC study populations.
In mammalian cells, autophagy plays crucial roles in restricting further spread of invading bacterial pathogens. Previous studies have established that the Salmonella virulence factors SseF and SseG are required for intracellular bacterial survival and replication. However, the underlying mechanism by which these two effectors facilitate bacterial infection remains elusive. Here, we report that SseF and SseG secreted by Salmonella Typhimurium (S. Typhimurium) inhibit autophagy in host cells and thereby establish a replicative niche for the bacteria in the cytosol. Mechanistically, SseF and SseG impaired autophagy initiation by directly interacting with the small GTPase Rab1A in the host cell. This interaction abolished Rab1A activation by disrupting the interaction with its guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF), the TRAPPIII (transport protein particle III) complex. This disruption of Rab1A signaling blocked the recruitment and activation of Unc-51-like autophagy-activating kinase 1 (ULK1) and decreased phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate biogenesis, which ultimately impeded autophagosome formation. Furthermore, SseF- or SseG-deficient bacterial strains exhibited reduced survival and growth in both mammalian cell lines and mouse infection models, and Rab1A depletion could rescue these defects. These results reveal that virulence factor-dependent inactivation of the small GTPase Rab1A represents a previously unrecognized strategy of S Typhimurium to evade autophagy and the host defense system.
Adaptation of cell shape and polarization through the formation and retraction of cellular protrusions requires balancing of endocytosis and exocytosis combined with fine-tuning of the local activity of small GTPases like Rab8. Here, we show that endocytic turnover of the plasma membrane at protrusions is directly coupled to surface removal and inactivation of Rab8. Removal is induced by reduced membrane tension and mediated by the GTPase regulator associated with focal adhesion kinase-1 (GRAF1, also known as ARHGAP26), a regulator of clathrin-independent endocytosis. GRAF1-depleted cells were deficient in multi-directional spreading and displayed elevated levels of GTP-loaded Rab8, which was accumulated at the tips of static protrusions. Furthermore, GRAF1 depletion impaired lumen formation and spindle orientation in a 3D cell culture system, indicating that GRAF1 activity regulates polarity establishment. Our data suggest that GRAF1-mediated removal of Rab8 from the cell surface restricts its activity during protrusion formation, thereby facilitating dynamic adjustment of the polarity axis.
Simultaneous hyperactivation of stress-activated protein kinase/c-Jun N-terminal protein kinase (SAPK/JNK) and mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (MEK/ERK) signaling cascades has been reported in carcinogenesis. However, how they are integrated to promote oncogenesis remains unknown. By analyzing breast invasive carcinoma database (The Cancer Genome Altas), we found that the mRNA expression levels of both JNK1 and ERK2 are positively correlated with the mRNA level of EEA1, an endosome associated protein, indicating the potential JNK/ERK crosstalk at endosome. Unbiased screen of different endosome-associated Rab GTPases reveals that late endosome serves as a unique platform to integrate JNK/ERK signaling. Furthermore, we identify that BPGAP1 (a BCH domain-containing, Cdc42GAP-like Rho GTPase-activating protein) promotes MEK partner 1 (MP1)-induced ERK activation on late endosome through scaffolding MP1/MEK1 complex. This regulatory function requires phosphorylation of BPGAP1 by JNK at its C terminal tail (Ser424) to unlock its autoinhibitory conformation. Consequently, phosphorylated BPGAP1 facilitates endosomal ERK signaling transduction to the nucleus, driving cell proliferation and transformation via the ERK-Myc-CyclinA axis. BPGAP1 therefore provides a crucial spatiotemporal checkpoint where JNK and MP1/MEK1 work in concert to regulate endosomal and nuclear ERK signaling in cell proliferation control.
Hepatocellular carcinoma comprises of a group of heterogeneous tumors of different etiologies. The multistep process of liver carcinogenesis involves various genetic and phenotypic alterations. The molecular pathways and driver mutations involved are still under investigation.
DNA micorarray technology was used to identify differentially expressed genes between human hepatocarcinoma and non-tumorous liver tissues to establish a unique specific gene-expression profile independent of the underlying liver disease. The validity of this global gene-expression profile was tested for its robustness against biopsies from other liver entities (cirrhotic and non-cirrhotic liver) by diagnosing HCC in blinded samples.
Most of the consistently and strongly overexpressed genes were related to cell-cycle regulation and DNA replication [27 genes, e.g. cyclin B1, karyopherin alpha 2 (KPNA2), cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDC2)], G-protein depending signaling [e.g. Rac GTPase activating protein 1 (RACGAP1), Rab GTPase YPT1 homolog (RAB1), and ADP-ribosylation factor-like 2 (ARL2)] and extracellular matrix re-modelling or cytoskeleton structure [22 genes, e.g. serine proteinase inhibitor 1 kazal-type (SPINK1), osteopontin (OPN), secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine (SPARC), collagen type 1 alpha2 (COL1A2), integrin alpha6 (ITGA6), and metalloproteinase 12 (MMP12)]. Furthermore, significantly differentially expressed genes (e.g. calcium-binding proteins, G-proteins, oncofetal proteins) in relation to tumor differentiation were detected using gene-expression analysis.
It is suggested that these significantly dysregulated genes are highly specific and potentially utilizable as prognostic markers and may lead to a better understanding of human hepatocarcinogenesis.
Tre-2/USP6, BUB2, cdc16 domain family member 1 (the TBC domain is the GTPase activating protein domain) (TBC1D1) is a Rab GTPase activating protein that is phosphorylated on Ser(231) by the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) in response to intracellular energy stress. However, the in vivo role and importance of this phosphorylation event remains unknown. To address this question, we generated a mouse model harboring a TBC1D1(Ser231Ala) knockin (KI) mutation and found that the KI mice developed obesity on a normal chow diet. Mechanistically, TBC1D1 is located on insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) storage vesicles, and the KI mutation increases endocrinal and paracrinal/autocrinal IGF1 secretion in an Rab8a-dependent manner. Hypersecretion of IGF1 causes increased expression of lipogenic genes via activating the protein kinase B (PKB; also known as Akt)-mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway in adipose tissues, which contributes to the development of obesity, diabetes, and hepatic steatosis as the KI mice age. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that the AMPK-TBC1D1 signaling nexus interacts with the PKB-mTOR pathway via IGF1 secretion, which consequently controls expression of lipogenic genes in the adipose tissue. These findings also have implications for drug discovery to combat obesity.
The preadipocyte factor 1 (Pref-1) is involved in the proliferation and differentiation of various precursor cells. However, the intracellular signaling pathways that control these processes and the role of Pref-1 in the pancreas remain poorly understood. Here, we showed that Pref-1 induces insulin synthesis and secretion via two independent pathways. The overexpression of Pref-1 activated MAPK signaling, which induced nucleocytoplasmic translocation of FOXO1 and PDX1 and led to the differentiation of human pancreatic ductal cells into β-like cells and an increase in insulin synthesis. Concurrently, Pref-1 activated Akt signaling and facilitated insulin secretion. A proteomics analysis identified the Rab43 GTPase-activating protein as a downstream target of Akt. A serial activation of both proteins induced various granular protein syntheses which led to enhanced glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. In a pancreatectomised diabetic animal model, exogenous Pref-1 improved glucose homeostasis by accelerating pancreatic ductal and β-cell regeneration after injury. These data establish a novel role for Pref-1, opening the possibility of applying this molecule to the treatment of diabetes. 
We have developed a novel chromatographic analytical method for the simultaneous quantitation of collagen crosslinks. Seven non-derivatised crosslinks could be separated on a Cogent Diamond Hydride HPLC column using either isocratic or gradient conditions then detected by mass spectrometry. The total run time was less than 10min which is significantly shorter than that previously reported. This is the first method in which histidinohydroxylysinonorleucine (HHL) and histidinohydroxymero-desmosine (HHMD) were separated and identified by mass spectrometry without the need for pre- or post-column derivatization. The CVs of the retention times of all seven crosslinks were less than 1% and the limit of detection (LOD) and the limits of quantitation (LOQ) were 0.07-0.13pmol/μL and 0.20-0.38pmol/μL, respectively. This novel method was used for the routine analysis and quantitation of crosslinks in different animal skins in which potential new collagen crosslinks were identified that are as yet undocumented.
This study aims to evaluate the in vitro angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition activity of different extracts of Orthosiphon stamineus (OS) leaves and their main flavonoids, namely rosmarinic acid (RA), sinensetin (SIN), eupatorin (EUP) and 3'-hydroxy-5,6,7,4'-tetramethoxyflavone (TMF). Furthermore, to identify possible mechanisms of action based on structure-activity relationships and molecular docking. The in vitro ACE inhibition activity relied on determining hippuric acid (HA) formation from ACE-specific substrate (hippuryl-histidyl-leucine (HHL)) by the action of ACE enzyme. A High Performance Liquid Chromatography method combined with UV detection was developed and validated for measurement the concentration of produced HA. The chelation ability of OS extract and its reference compounds was evaluated by tetramethylmurexide reagent. Furthermore, molecular docking study was performed by LeadIT-FlexX: BioSolveIT's LeadIT program. OS ethanolic extract (OS-E) exhibited highest inhibition and lowest IC50 value (45.77 ± 1.17 µg/mL) against ACE compared to the other extracts. Among the tested reference compounds, EUP with IC50 15.35 ± 4.49 µg/mL had highest inhibition against ACE and binding ability with Zn (II) (56.03% ± 1.26%) compared to RA, TMF and SIN. Molecular docking studies also confirmed that flavonoids inhibit ACE via interaction with the zinc ion and this interaction is stabilized by other interactions with amino acids in the active site. In this study, we have demonstrated that changes in flavonoids active core affect their capacity to inhibit ACE. Moreover, we showed that ACE inhibition activity of flavonoids compounds is directly related to their ability to bind with zinc ion in the active site of ACE enzyme. It was also revealed that OS extract contained high amount of flavonoids other than RA, TMF, SIN and EUP. As such, application of OS extract is useful as inhibitors of ACE.
A significant contribution to the causes of hereditary hearing impairment comes from genetic factors. More than 120 genes and 160 loci have been identified to be involved in hearing impairment. Given that consanguine populations are more vulnerable to most inherited diseases, such as hereditary hearing loss (HHL), the genetic picture of HHL among the Iranian population, which consists of at least eight ethnic subgroups with a high rate of intermarriage, is expected to be highly heterogeneous. Using an electronic literature review through various databases such as PubMed, MEDLINE, and Scopus, we review the current picture of HHL in Iran. In this review, we present more than 39 deafness genes reported to cause non-syndromic HHL in Iran, of which the most prevalent causative genes include GJB2, SLC26A4, MYO15A, and MYO7A. In addition, we highlight some of the more common genetic causes of syndromic HHL in Iran. These results are of importance for further investigation and elucidation of the molecular basis of HHL in Iran and also for developing a national diagnostic tool tailored to the Iranian context enabling early and efficient diagnosis of hereditary hearing impairment.
The occurrence of tinnitus can be linked to hearing loss in the majority of cases, but there is nevertheless a large degree of unexplained heterogeneity in the relation between hearing loss and tinnitus. Part of the problem might be that hearing loss is usually quantified in terms of increased hearing thresholds, which only provides limited information about the underlying cochlear damage. Moreover, noise exposure that does not cause hearing threshold loss can still lead to "hidden hearing loss" (HHL), i.e., functional deafferentation of auditory nerve fibers (ANFs) through loss of synaptic ribbons in inner hair cells. While it is known that increased hearing thresholds can trigger increases in spontaneous neural activity in the central auditory system, i.e., a putative neural correlate of tinnitus, the central effects of HHL have not yet been investigated. Here, we exposed mice to octave-band noise at 100 and 105 dB SPL to generate HHL and permanent increases of hearing thresholds, respectively. Deafferentation of ANFs was confirmed through measurement of auditory brainstem responses and cochlear immunohistochemistry. Acute extracellular recordings from the auditory midbrain (inferior colliculus) demonstrated increases in spontaneous neuronal activity (a putative neural correlate of tinnitus) in both groups. Surprisingly, the increase in spontaneous activity was most pronounced in the mice with HHL, suggesting that the relation between hearing loss and neuronal hyperactivity might be more complex than currently understood. Our computational model indicated that these differences in neuronal hyperactivity could arise from different degrees of deafferentation of low-threshold ANFs in the two exposure groups. Our results demonstrate that HHL is sufficient to induce changes in central auditory processing, and they also indicate a non-monotonic relationship between cochlear damage and neuronal hyperactivity, suggesting an explanation for why tinnitus might occur without obvious hearing loss and conversely why hearing loss does not always lead to tinnitus. 
A sulfated polysaccharide was successfully isolated from Cymodocea nodosa (CNSP). This is the first report that indicates the chemical composition, structural characterization, functional and antihypertensive properties of this polysaccharide. The CNSP consisted mainly of sulfate (23.17%), total sugars (54.90%), galactose (44.89%), mannose (17.30%), arabinose (12.05%), xylose (9.18%), maltose (1.07%) and uronic acid (11.03%) with low water activity (0.49). CNSP had an XRD pattern that was typical for a semi-crystalline polymer with homogeneous structure. It also displayed an important anti-hypertensive activity (IC50=0.43mgml) with a dose-dependent manner using a synthetic substrate, N-hippuryl-His-Leu hydrate salt (HHL). Overall, the results indicate that CNSP have attractive chemical, functional and biological properties, with a preliminary structural may have a backbone of branched 6-O-sulfated (1→4) galactosidic linkages, which can be considered in the future as alternative additive in various foods, cosmetic and pharmaceutical preparations. 
The prostate is a male accessory genital gland that plays an essential role in reproductive function. To understand the cytological characteristics of differentiating prostatic cells, we used lectin histochemistry combined with immunohistochemistry to examine the distribution of lectin-binding sites on prostatic cells during postnatal development in the mouse. During postnatal development, Hippeastrum Hybrid Lectin (HHL) lectin reacted consistently with the luminal cells of all prostatic lobes (regions), whereas the Ricinus Communis Agglutinin I (RCA-I) and Soybean Agglutinin (SBA) lectins showed remarkable differences with age, region, and cell type. We found that the lectin-binding pattern in differentiating prostatic cells acquired adult characteristics around 3 weeks after birth. The results indicate that prostatic cell differentiation during postnatal development in mice is characterized by the presence of cell- and region-specific lectin-binding sites in the prostate, suggesting that there may also be cellular and regional differences in their function. Furthermore, some lectins (HHL, RCA-I, and SBA) could provide useful markers for research into cell differentiation and for the pathological evaluation of prostatic diseases or in the diagnosis of male infertility. 
Three new 30-noroleanane triterpenoid saponins, akebonoic acid 28-O-β-d-glucopyranosyl-(1''→6')-β-d-glucopyranosyl ester (1), akebonoic acid 28-O-(6''-O-caffeoyl)-β-d-glucopyranosyl-(1''→6')-β-d-glucopyranosyl ester (Holboelliside A, 2) and 3β,20α,24-trihydroxy-29-norolean-12-en-28-oic acid 3-O-(6'-O-caffeoyl)-β-d-glucopyranoside (Holboelliside B, 3) were isolated from the stems of Holboellia coriacea Diels, together with five known compounds, eupteleasaponin VIII (4), 3α-akebonoic acid (5), quinatic acid (6), 3β-hydroxy-30-norhederagenin (7) and quinatoside A (8). The structures of these compounds were determined on the basis of spectral and chemical evidence. Compounds 1-5 were evaluated for their inhibitory activity against three human tumors HepG2, HCT116 and SGC-7901 cell lines in vitro. 
Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) converts angiotensin I to angiotensin II and degrades bradykinin and other vasoactive peptides. ACE inhibitors are used to treat diseases such as hypertension and heart failure. It is thus highly desirable to understand the catalytic mechanism of ACE, as this should facilitate the design of more powerful and selective ACE inhibitors. ACE exhibits two different active domains, the C-domain and the N-domain. In this work, we systematically investigated the inhibitor- and substrate-binding patterns in the N-domain of human ACE using a combined quantum mechanical and molecular mechanical approach. The hydrolysis of hippuryl-histidyl-leucine (HHL) as catalyzed by the N-domain of human somatic ACE was explored, and the effects of chloride ion on the overall reaction were also investigated. Two models, one with and one without a chloride ion at the first binding position, were then designed to examine the chloride dependence of inhibitor-substrate binding and the catalytic mechanism. Our calculations indicate that the hydrolysis reaction follows a stepwise general base/general acid catalysis path. The estimated mean free energy barrier height in the two models is about 15.6 kcal/mol, which agrees very well with the experimentally estimated value of 15.8 kcal/mol. Our simulations thus suggest that the N-domain is in a mixed form during ACE-catalyzed hydrolysis, with the single-chloride-ion and the double-chloride-ion forms existing simultaneously. Graphical Abstract Superposition of ACE C- and N- domains.
Collagen type I crosslink type and prevalence can be influenced by age, tissue type, and health; however, the role that crosslink chemical structure plays in mechanical behavior is not clear. Molecular dynamics simulations of ~65-nm-long microfibril units were used to predict how difunctional (deH-HLNL and HLKNL) and trifunctional (HHL and PYD) crosslinks respond to mechanical deformation. Low- and high-strain stress-strain regions were observed, corresponding to crosslink alignment. The high-strain elastic moduli were 37.7, 37.9, 39.9, and 42.4GPa for the HLKNL, deH-HLNL, HHL, and PYD-crosslinked models, respectively. Bond dissociation analysis suggests that PYD is more brittle than HHL, with deH-HLNL and HLKNL being similarly ductile. These results agree with the tissues in which these crosslinks are found (e.g., deH-HLNL/HLKNL in developing tissues, HHL in mature skin, and PYD in mature bone). Chemical structure-function relationships identified for these crosslinks can aid the development of larger-scale models of collagenous tissues and materials.
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a disorder with altered immunologic function and increased risks of infection, while the association between HBV and RA remains largely unknown.To determine the prevalence and risk of HBV infection in patients with RA, 2 cohort datasets were sourced from Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database to capture National Health Insurance claims data between 1999 and 2009. One set was a specially requested RA subject's dataset extracted from the whole 23 million beneficiaries, and a total of 38,969 aged ≧18 years RA subjects were identified (RA cohort). The other one was a randomly selected 1 million patients' longitudinal dataset, and from which an additional 701,476 aged ≧18 years non-RA subjects were identified (non-RA cohort). An epidemiological approach was used to compare the prevalence and risk for HBV infection between RA and non-RA subjects.During the followed interval between 1999 and 2009, 3260 in RA cohort and 63,588 in non-RA cohort had a diagnosis of HBV infection. The annual age- and sex-standardized prevalence of HBV infection in the RA cohort was generally higher than that in the non-RA cohort. The RA patients had a higher HBV period prevalence than did the non-RA subjects (RA vs. non-RA = 69.9 vs. 60.1 cases per 1000 subjects). Compared with the non-RA cohort, the RA cohort had an increased risk of HBV infection after adjustment for potential prognostic factors (1.13, 95% CIs: 1.08-1.17).RA patients are characterized by an increased risk of HBV infection than non-RA subjects. 
Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the hepatic manifestation of the metabolic syndrome and is strongly associated with obesity, dyslipidaemia and altered glucose regulation. Previous data demonstrated that low circulating levels of tumour necrosis factor weak inducer of apoptosis (sTWEAK) were associated with obesity, diabetes and insulin resistance, all traits associated with an increased risk of NALFD. Circulating sTWEAK levels are expected to be reduced in the presence of NAFLD.
We aimed to explore the relationship between NAFLD and circulating sTWEAK levels in obese patients, and to evaluate the effect of sTWEAK on hepatocyte triglyceride accumulation.Design setting and patients:This is an observational case-control study performed in n=112 severely obese patients evaluated for NAFLD by abdominal ultrasound and n=32 non-obese patients without steatosis. Serum sTWEAK concentrations were measured by ELISA. Multivariable analyses were performed to determine the independent predictors of NAFLD. We analysed TWEAK and Fn14 protein expression in liver biopsies by western blotting and immunohistochemistry. An immortalized primary human hepatocyte cell line (HHL) was used to evaluate the effect of sTWEAK on triglyceride accumulation.
We observed a reduction in serum circulating sTWEAK concentrations with the presence of liver steatosis. On multivariable analysis, lower sTWEAK concentrations were independently associated with the presence of NAFLD (odds ratio (OR)=0.023; 95% confidence interval: 0.001-0.579; P&lt;0.022). In human hepatocytes, sTWEAK administration reduced fat accumulation as demonstrated by the reduction in palmitic acid-induced accumulation of triglyceride and the decreased expression of cluster of differentiation 36 (CD36) and perilipin 1 and 2 (PLIN1 and PLIN2) genes.
Decreased sTWEAK concentrations are independently associated with the presence of NAFLD. This is concordant with the observation that TWEAK reduces lipid accumulation in human liver cells.
Radiomics can quantify tumor phenotypic characteristics non-invasively by applying feature algorithms to medical imaging data. In this study of lung cancer patients, we investigated the association between radiomic features and the tumor histologic subtypes (adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma). Furthermore, in order to predict histologic subtypes, we employed machine-learning methods and independently evaluated their prediction performance.
Two independent radiomic cohorts with a combined size of 350 patients were included in our analysis. A total of 440 radiomic features were extracted from the segmented tumor volumes of pretreatment CT images. These radiomic features quantify tumor phenotypic characteristics on medical images using tumor shape and size, intensity statistics, and texture. Univariate analysis was performed to assess each feature's association with the histological subtypes. In our multivariate analysis, we investigated 24 feature selection methods and 3 classification methods for histology prediction. Multivariate models were trained on the training cohort and their performance was evaluated on the independent validation cohort using the area under ROC curve (AUC). Histology was determined from surgical specimen.
In our univariate analysis, we observed that fifty-three radiomic features were significantly associated with tumor histology. In multivariate analysis, feature selection methods ReliefF and its variants showed higher prediction accuracy as compared to other methods. We found that Naive Baye's classifier outperforms other classifiers and achieved the highest AUC (0.72; p-value = 2.3 × 10(-7)) with five features: Stats_min, Wavelet_HLL_rlgl_lowGrayLevelRunEmphasis, Wavelet_HHL_stats_median, Wavelet_HLL_stats_skewness, and Wavelet_HLH_glcm_clusShade.
Histological subtypes can influence the choice of a treatment/therapy for lung cancer patients. We observed that radiomic features show significant association with the lung tumor histology. Moreover, radiomics-based multivariate classifiers were independently validated for the prediction of histological subtypes. Despite achieving lower than optimal prediction accuracy (AUC 0.72), our analysis highlights the impressive potential of non-invasive and cost-effective radiomics for precision medicine. Further research in this direction could lead us to optimal performance and therefore to clinical applicability, which could enhance the efficiency and efficacy of cancer care.
The gap junction β2 (GJB2) gene is associated with more than half of the recessive forms of hereditary hearing loss (HHL). However, the correlation between p.V27I and p.E114G variants of GJB2 and hearing phenotype remains controversial. This study aimed to clarify possible roles of these variants in Chinese infants with nonsyndromic hearing loss (NSHL). Hearing and gene tests were conducted in 300 infants (aged 0-3 months) with NSHL and 484 normal infants (aged 0-3 months). The p.V27I and p.E114G variants appeared frequently in both NSHL patients and normal controls. The allele and haplotype frequencies of p.V27I and p.E114G in patients and controls were compared, but no significant difference was observed (p=0.44 and p=0.26, respectively). Moreover, genotype frequencies of the p.V27I variant showed no significant difference between the two groups (p=0.66). Interestingly, more homozygote p.V27I/p.E114G subjects were found in NSHL infants than in controls (5/484 and 13/300, respectively), most of whom (61.54%) had mild or moderate hearing losses. Our results indicate that homozygote p.V27I/p.E114G is associated with mild and moderate HHL.
Keratins 8/18 (K8/18) are phosphoglycoproteins and form the major intermediate filament network of simple epithelia. The three O-GlcNAcylation (Ser(29), Ser(30), and Ser(48)) and two phosphorylation (Ser(33) and Ser(52)) serine sites on K18 are well characterized. Both of these modifications have been reported to increase K18 solubility and regulate its filament organization. In this report, we investigated the site-specific interplay between these two modifications in regulating the functional properties of K18, like solubility, stability, and filament organization. An immortalized hepatocyte cell line (HHL-17) stably expressing site-specific single, double, and triple O-GlcNAc and phosphomutants of K18 were used to identify the site(s) critical for regulating these functions. Keratin 18 mutants where O-GlcNAcylation at Ser(30) was abolished (K18-S30A) exhibited reduced phosphorylation induced solubility, increased stability, defective filament architecture, and slower migration. Interestingly, K18-S30A mutants also showed loss of phosphorylation at Ser(33), a modification known to regulate the solubility of K18. Further to this, the K18 phosphomutant (K18-S33A) mimicked K18-S30A in its stability, filament organization, and cell migration. These results indicate that O-GlcNAcylation at Ser(30) promotes phosphorylation at Ser(33) to regulate the functional properties of K18 and also impact cellular processes like migration. O-GlcNAcylation and phosphorylation on the same or adjacent sites on most proteins antagonize each other in regulating protein functions. Here we report a novel, positive interplay between O-GlcNAcylation and phosphorylation at adjacent sites on K18 to regulate its fundamental properties.
The xenoestrogen bisphenol A (BPA) is a widespread plasticizer detectable within several ecosystems. BPA is considered a metabolic disruptor, affecting different organs; however, little is known about its mechanism of action in the liver, in which it triggers triglyceride accumulation. Adult zebrafish (Danio rerio) exposed to BPA developed hepatosteatosis, which was associated with an increase in the liver levels of the obesogenic endocannabinoids 2-arachidonoylglycerol and anandamide and a concomitant decrease in palmitoylethanolamide. These changes were associated with variations in the expression of key endocannabinoid catabolic and metabolic enzymes and an increase in the expression of the endocannabinoid receptor cnr1. Acute and chronic in vitro treatments with nano- and micromolar BPA doses showed increased anandamide levels in line with decreased activity of fatty acid amide hydrolase, the main anandamide hydrolytic enzyme, and induced triglyceride accumulation in HHL-5 cells in a CB1-dependent manner. We conclude that BPA is able to produce hepatosteatosis in zebrafish and human hepatocytes by up-regulating the endocannabinoid system.
Tulsi, Banyan, and Jamun are popular Indian medicinal plants with notable hypoglycemic potentials. Now the work reports chemo-profiling of the three species with in-vitro screening approach for natural enzyme inhibitors (NEIs) against enzymes pathogenic for type 2 diabetes. Further along with the chemometrics optimized extraction process technology, phyto-synergistic studies of the composite polyherbal blends have also been reported.
Chemometrically optimized extraction procedures, ratios of polyherbal composites to achieve phyto-synergistic actions, and in-vitro screening of NEIs amongst leaves of Tulsi, Banyan, and Jamun.
The extraction process parameters of the leaves of three plant species (Ficus benghalensis, Syzigium cumini and Ocimum sanctum) were optimized by rotatable central composite design of chemometrics so as to get maximal yield of bio-actives. Phyto-blends of three species were prepared so as to achieve synergistic antidiabetic and antioxidant potentials and the ratios were optimized by chemometrics. Next, for in vitro screening of natural enzyme inhibitors the individual leaf extracts as well as composite blends were subjected to assay procedures to see their inhibitory potentials against the enzymes pathogenic in type 2 diabetes. The antioxidant potentials were also estimated by DPPH radical scavenging, ABTS, FRAP and Dot Blot assay.
Considering response surface methodology studies and from the solutions obtained using desirability function, it was found that hydro-ethanolic or methanolic solvent ratio of 52.46 ± 1.6 and at a temperature of 20.17 ± 0.6 gave an optimum yield of polyphenols with minimal chlorophyll leaching. The species also showed the presence of glycosides, alkaloids, and saponins. Composites in the ratios of 1:1:1 and 1:1:2 gave synergistic effects in terms of polyphenol yield and anti-oxidant potentials. All composites (1:1:1, 1:2:1, 2:1:1, 1:1:2) showed synergistic anti-oxidant actions. Inhibitory activities against the targeted enzymes expressed in terms of IC50 values have shown that hydro-ethanolic extracts in all cases whether individual species or composites in varying ratios gave higher IC50 values thus showing greater effectivity.
Current research provides the state-of-the-art of search of NEIs amongst three species by in-vitro assays which can be further utilized for bioactivity-guided isolations of such enzyme inhibitors. Further, it reports the optimized phyto-blend ratios so as to achieve synergistic anti-oxidative actions.
The current research work focuses on the optimization of the extraction process parameters and the ratios of phyto-synergistic blends of the leaves of three common medicinal plants viz. banyan, jamun and tulsi by chemometrics. Qualitative and quantitative chemo profiling of the extracts were done by different phytochemical tests and UV spectrophotometric methods. Enzymes like alpha amylase, alpha glucosidase, aldose reductase, dipeptidyl peptidase 4, angiotensin converting enzymes are found to be pathogenic in type 2 diabetes. In vitro screening of natural enzyme inhibitors amongst individual extracts and composite blends were carried out by different assay procedures and the potency expressed in terms of IC50 values. Antioxidant potentials were estimated by DPPH radical scavenging, ABTS, FRAP and Dot Blot assay. Hydroalcoholic solvent (50:50) gave maximal yield of bio-actives with minimal chlorophyll leaching. Hydroethanolic extract of tulsi showed maximal antioxidant effect. Though all composites showed synergism, maximal effects were shown by the composite (1:1:2) in terms of polyphenol yield, antioxidant effect and inhibitory actions against the targeted enzymes.

The inhibition of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) activity was determined in vitro by mushroom-derived eritadenine (EA), which was analyzed in 11 principal Korean edible mushrooms. EA inhibited ACE activity with 0.091 μM IC50, whereas the IC50 of captopril (CP), which is a reference compound, was 0.025 μM. Kinetic measurements of ACE reaction in the substrate of hippuryl-l-histidyl-l-leucine (HHL) with or without EA revealed that the Vmax (0.0465 O.D/30 min) was unchanged, but the the Km increased from 2.063 to 3.887 mM, indicating that EA competes with HHL for the active site. When EA was analyzed by HPLC, Lentinus edodes with a soft cap contained the highest amount EA (642.8 mg%); however, Phellinus linteus with a hard cap contained the least amount of EA (9.4 mg%). These results indicate that EA was a strong competitive inhibitor for ACE, and edible mushrooms with soft caps contained a significant amount of EA. 
Hereditary Hearing Loss (HHL) is an extremely heterogeneous disorder. Approximately 30 out of 80 known HHL genes are associated with autosomal dominant forms. Here, we identified PSIP1/LEDGF (isoform p75) as a novel strong candidate gene involved in dominant HHL. Using exome sequencing we found a frameshift deletion (c.1554_1555del leading to p.E518Dfs*2) in an Italian pedigree affected by sensorineural mild-to-moderate HHL but also showing a variable eye phenotype (i.e. uveitis, optic neuropathy). This deletion led to a premature stop codon (p.T519X) with truncation of the last 12 amino acids. PSIP1 was recently described as a transcriptional co-activator regulated by miR-135b in vestibular hair cells of the mouse inner ear as well as a possible protector against photoreceptor degeneration. Here, we demonstrate that it is ubiquitously expressed in the mouse inner ear. The PSIP1 mutation is associated with a peculiar audiometric slope toward the high frequencies. These findings indicate that PSIP1 likely plays an important role in HHL. 
Two isoforms of Rho-associated coiled-coil kinase (ROCK), ROCKI and ROCKII, play an important role in many cellular processes. Despite the accumulating evidence showing that ROCK could be a potential cancer therapeutic target, the relevant tumor types to ROCK activation are not well clarified. The aim of this study was to evaluate the ROCK activation status in different tumor types of breast cancer.
We evaluated the immunoreactivities of phosphorylation-specific antibodies of ROCKI and ROCKII to inform their kinase activation in 275 of breast carcinoma tissues, including 56 of carcinoma in situ, 116 of invasive carcinoma, and 103 of invasive carcinoma with metastasis. ROCKII activation signal detected in nucleus was significantly correlated with tumor metastasis, while ROCKI and cytosolic ROCKII activation signals made no significant difference in that metastasis. Furthermore, nuclear ROCKII activation signal was associated with poor clinical outcome and correlated with late tumor stage, low expression of estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR), overexpression of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) and high Ki67 labeling index.
Nuclear ROCKII activation signal might contribute to the tumor metastasis in breast cancer. Differences in ROCK activation that underlie the phenotypes of breast cancer could enhance our understanding for the use of ROCK inhibitors in cancer therapy.
We study team decision problems where communication is not possible, but coordination among team members can be realized via signals in a shared environment. We consider a variety of decision problems that differ in what team members know about one another's actions and knowledge. For each type of decision problem, we investigate how different assumptions on the available signals affect team performance. Specifically, we consider the cases of perfectly correlated, i.i.d., and exchangeable classical signals, as well as the case of quantum signals. We find that, whereas in perfect-recall trees (Kuhn 1950 Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. USA 36, 570-576; Kuhn 1953 In Contributions to the theory of games, vol. II (eds H Kuhn, A Tucker), pp. 193-216) no type of signal improves performance, in imperfect-recall trees quantum signals may bring an improvement. Isbell (Isbell 1957 In Contributions to the theory of games, vol. III (eds M Drescher, A Tucker, P Wolfe), pp. 79-96) proved that, in non-Kuhn trees, classical i.i.d. signals may improve performance. We show that further improvement may be possible by use of classical exchangeable or quantum signals. We include an example of the effect of quantum signals in the context of high-frequency trading. 
The purpose of this study was to create symptom indexes, that is scores derived from questionnaires to accurately and efficiently measure symptoms of interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome and chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome, collectively referred to as urological chronic pelvic pain syndromes. We created these indexes empirically by investigating the structure of symptoms using exploratory factor analysis.
As part of the MAPP (Multi-Disciplinary Approach to the Study of Chronic Pelvic Pain) Research Network 424 participants completed questionnaires, including GUPI (Genitourinary Pain Index), ICSI (Interstitial Cystitis Symptom Index) and ICPI (Interstitial Cystitis Problem Index). Individual items from questionnaires about bladder and pain symptoms were evaluated by principal component and exploratory factor analyses to identify indexes with fewer questions to comprehensively quantify symptom severity. Additional analyses included correlating symptom indexes with symptoms of depression, which is a known comorbidity of patients with pelvic pain.
Exploratory factor analyses suggested that the 2 factors pain severity and urinary severity provided the best psychometric description of items in GUPI, ICSI and ICPI. These factors were used to create 2 symptom indexes for pain and urinary symptoms. Pain, but not urinary symptoms, was associated with symptoms of depression on multiple regression analysis, suggesting that these symptoms may impact patients with urological chronic pelvic pain syndromes differently (B ± SE for pain severity = 0.24 ± 0.04, 95% CI 0.16-0.32, β = 0.32, p &lt;0.001). Our results suggest that pain and urinary symptoms should be assessed separately rather than combined into 1 total score. Total scores that combine the separate factors of pain and urinary symptoms into 1 score may be limited for clinical and research purposes.
Chronic lymphocytic inflammation with pontine perivascular enhancement responsive to steroids is a brainstem disorder characterized by perivascular pathologic reaction with lymphocyte infiltration and leading to diplopia, facial palsy, dysarthria, and gait ataxia. It was thought to be an autoimmune disorder without distinct pathogenesis. Chronic hepatitis B virus infection has been proposed in correlation with autoimmune diseases, including central nervous system demyelinating disease. Patients with chronic hepatitis B infection may develop the syndrome of chronic lymphocytic inflammation with pontine perivascular enhancement responsive to steroids.
A 34-year-old Taiwanese man who had been a hepatitis B virus carrier for a decade presented to our emergency room. He had influenza symptoms and progressive symptoms of left hemifacial numbness, double vision, and an unsteady gait of 2 days' duration. Chronic lymphocytic inflammation with pontine perivascular enhancement responsive to steroids was diagnosed, with increased hepatitis B viral load at the same time. He had no past history of similar neurologic deficits, and his liver function tests had been within normal limits before this episode. After corticosteroid and entecavir treatments, his neurological deficits and neuroimaging anomalies improved and his serum hepatitis B virus DNA viral load normalized.
Hepatitis B virus infection may induce central nervous system autoimmune reactions, including chronic lymphocytic inflammation with pontine perivascular enhancement responsive to steroids. In such cases, concomitant administration of corticosteroids and antiviral agent was helpful. We suggest further investigations in patients with regulatory T cell dysfunction, which may assist in clarifying a loss of immune tolerance in patients with such disorders.
Diverticular disease and acute coronary syndrome (ACS) are common disorders that share several risk factors. Few researchers have evaluated the association between diverticular disease and ACS. We aimed to assess the risk of ACS in patients with diverticular disease. A nationwide retrospective cohort study was conducted by analyzing data from the National Health Insurance Research Database in Taiwan. All patients aged ≥20 years with a diagnosis of diverticular disease from January 1, 2000, to December 31, 2011, were included in this study. For comparison, patients without diverticular disease were randomly selected and matched with the study cohort at a 4:1 ratio according to age, sex, and the year of the diagnosis of diverticular disease. Patients with incomplete age or sex information and a history of cardiovascular diseases were excluded from the study. All patients were followed until an ACS event, withdrawal from the insurance program, or December 31, 2011. In this study, 52,681 patients with diverticular disease and 210,724 patients without diverticular disease were included. Men accounted for 56.1% of patients and 57.8% of patients were ≥50 years old. The overall incidence density of ACS in patients with diverticular disease (45.5 per 10,000 person-years) was significantly higher than in those without diverticular disease (30.3 per 10,000 person-years), with an adjusted hazard ratio (HR) of 1.23 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.14-1.32) after adjustment for age, sex, and comorbidities. The cumulative incidence of ACS in patients with diverticular disease was significantly higher than that in the control cohort (log-rank test, P &lt; 0.001). The adjusted HRs for the development of ACS were 1.25 (95% CI, 1.15-1.37) and 1.19 (95% CI, 1.07-1.32) in patients with diverticulitis and diverticulosis, respectively. The adjusted HRs of ACS in patients with diverticular disease additionally increased from 1.97 (95% CI, 1.73-2.23) in patients with 1 comorbidity to 5.51 (95% CI, 3.88-7.84) in those with ≥5 comorbidities. This large population-based retrospective study revealed an association between diverticular disease and ACS. Further research is warranted to determine the exact mechanism of the link between these diseases.
Instead of waiting for challenges to confront hospital management, doctors and managers should act in advance to optimize and sustain value-based health. This work highlights the importance of scenario planning in hospitals, proposes an elaborated definition of the stakeholders of a hospital and defines the influence factors to which hospitals are exposed to.
Based on literature analysis as well as on personal interviews with stakeholders we propose an elaborated definition of stakeholders and designed a questionnaire that integrated the following influence factors, which have relevant impact on hospital management: political/legal, economic, social, technological and environmental forces. These influence factors are examined to develop the so-called critical uncertainties. Thorough identification of uncertainties was based on a "Stakeholder Feedback".
Two key uncertainties were identified and considered in this study: the development of workload for the medical staff the profit oriented performance of the medical staff. According to the developed scenarios, complementary education of the medical staff as well as of non-medical top executives and managers of hospitals was the recommended core strategy. Complementary scenario-specific strategic options should be considered whenever needed to optimize dealing with a specific future development of the health care environment.
Strategic planning in hospitals is essential to ensure sustainable success. It considers multiple situations and integrates internal and external insights and perspectives in addition to identifying weak signals and "blind spots". This flows into a sound planning for multiple strategic options. It is a state of the art tool that allows dealing with the increasing challenges facing hospital management.
Hintergrund: Das Krankenhausmanagement ist stets Herausforderungen ausgesetzt. Anstatt auf die Herausforderungen zu warten, sollten Ärzte und Manager im Voraus handeln, um ein optimiertes und nachhaltig wertorientiertes Gesundheitswesen zu sichern.

Ergänzende szenariospezifische strategische Optionen sollen, falls erforderlich, in Betracht gezogen werden, um eine bestimmte zukünftige Entwicklung des medizinischen Umfeldes zu optimieren.Schlussfolgerung: Strategische Planung in Krankenhäusern ist wichtig, um nachhaltigen Erfolg zu gewährleisten. Diese Planung soll mehrere Situationen berücksichtigen und integriert interne und externe Ein- und Ausblicke. Darüber hinaus soll sie schwache Signale und „blinde Flecken“ identifizieren. Dieses fließt in eine solide Planung für mehrere strategische Optionen ein. Es ist eine State-of-the-Art-Methode, die dem Krankenhausmanagement erlaubt, mit zunehmenden Herausforderungen umzugehen.
Countries with culturally accepted consanguinity provide a unique resource for the study of rare recessively inherited genetic diseases. Although hereditary hearing loss (HHL) is not uncommon, it is genetically heterogeneous, with over 85 genes causally implicated in non-syndromic hearing loss (NSHL). This heterogeneity makes many gene-specific types of NSHL exceedingly rare. We sought to define the spectrum of autosomal recessive HHL in Iran by investigating both common and rarely diagnosed deafness-causing genes.
Using a custom targeted genomic enrichment (TGE) panel, we simultaneously interrogated all known genetic causes of NSHL in a cohort of 302 GJB2-negative Iranian families.
We established a genetic diagnosis for 67% of probands and their families, with over half of all diagnoses attributable to variants in five genes: SLC26A4, MYO15A, MYO7A, CDH23 and PCDH15. As a reflection of the power of consanguinity mapping, 26 genes were identified as causative for NSHL in the Iranian population for the first time. In total, 179 deafness-causing variants were identified in 40 genes in 201 probands, including 110 novel single nucleotide or small insertion-deletion variants and three novel CNV. Several variants represent founder mutations.
This study attests to the power of TGE and massively parallel sequencing as a diagnostic tool for the evaluation of hearing loss in Iran, and expands on our understanding of the genetics of HHL in this country. Families negative for variants in the genes represented on this panel represent an excellent cohort for novel gene discovery.
In ferroelectric thin films, controlling the orientation of the polarization is a key element to controlling their physical properties. We use laboratory and synchrotron X-ray diffraction to investigate ferroelectric bicolor PbTiO3/PbZr0.2Ti0.8O3 and tricolor PbTiO3/SrTiO3/PbZr0.2Ti0.8O3 superlattices and to study the role of the SrTiO3 layers on the domain structure. In the tricolor superlattices, we demonstrate the existence of 180° ferroelectric stripe nanodomains, induced by the depolarization field produced by the SrTiO3 layers. Each ultrathin SrTiO3 layer modifies the electrostatic boundary conditions between the ferroelectric layers compared to the corresponding bicolor structures, leading to the suppression of the a/c polydomain states. Combined with the electrostatic effect, the tensile strain induced by PbZr0.2Ti0.8O3 in the PbTiO3 layers leads to polarization rotation in the system as evidenced by grazing incidence X-ray measurements. This polarization rotation is associated with the monoclinic Mc phase as revealed by the splitting of the (HHL) and (H0L) reciprocal lattice points. This work demonstrates that the tricolor paraelectric/ferroelectric superlattices constitute a tunable system to investigate the concomitant effects of strains and depolarizing fields. Our studies provide a pathway to stabilize a monoclinic symmetry in ferroelectric layers, which is of particular interest for the enhancement of the piezoelectric properties. 
Quorum sensing has been shown to play a crucial role in Pseudomonas aeruginosa pathogenesis where it activates expression of myriad genes that regulate the production of important virulence factors such as biofilm formation. Antagonism of quorum sensing is an excellent target for antimicrobial therapy and represents a novel approach to combat drug resistance. In this study, Chromobacterium violaceum biosensor strain was employed as a fast, sensitive, reliable, and easy to use tool for rapid screening of soil samples for Quorum Sensing Inhibitors (QSI) and the optimal conditions for maximal QSI production were scrutinized. Screening of 127 soil isolates showed that 43 isolates were able to breakdown the HHL signal. Out of the 43 isolates, 38 isolates were able to inhibit the violet color of the biosensor and to form easily detectable zones of color inhibition around their growth. A confirmatory bioassay was carried out after concentrating the putative positive cell-free lysates. Three different isolates that belonged to Bacillus cereus group were shown to have QSI activities and their QSI activities were optimized by changing their culture conditions. Further experiments revealed that the cell-free lysates of these isolates were able to inhibit biofilm formation by P. aeruginosa clinical isolates. 
During safety rounds, we observed few residents demonstrating hand hygiene and patient identification as they began their postgraduate clinical training. We assessed baseline performance of these 2 basic safety skills in residents entering the first year of postgraduate clinical training (PGY1).
PGY1 residents beginning training on July 1, 2013, and July 1, 2014, at our institution were examined using a simulated scenario testing for hand hygiene and patient identification. Nurse volunteers posed as patients and evaluated each resident using a standardized scoring tool. Residents were observed for the following behaviors when interacting: (1) hand hygiene before or upon entry into the patient's room (HHE); (2) resident introducing himself or herself (INTRO); (3) resident identifying patient (IDNB); (4) resident comparing patient's stated name and date of birth to patient's ID band (IDC); (5) resident explaining procedure to patient (EXP); and (6) resident performing hand hygiene upon exiting patient's room (HHL).
A total of 114 residents were examined. Compliance results were as follows: HHE at 66% (75); INTRO at 96% (110); IDNB at 52% (59); IDC at 42% (48); EXP at 90% (103); and HHL at 58% (66).
Developing and hardwiring basic patient safety skills is essential for creating an institutional culture of safety. We used a simulated patient scenario to provide a baseline assessment of 2 important safety skills.The results obtained demonstrate poor compliance with hand hygiene and patient identification. Our results suggest that there is a need for additional training and perhaps new methods of training and reinforcement in medical school and beyond, to hardwire these basic patient safety skills.
Acute aortic dissections of Stanford type A require emergency surgery repair and present challenges to surgeons. The frozen elephant technique is one of several approaches used to treat aortic arch dissection. The purpose of this meta-analysis was to investigate the clinical effectiveness of the frozen elephant technique for treating acute type A aortic dissection.Medline, Cochrane, Google Scholar, and ClinicalTrials.gov databases were searched up to March 31, 2014, for studies that assessed the use of frozen elephant trunk technique for treating acute type A aortic dissection. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes included rate of stroke, spinal cord injury, renal failure, and reoperations for bleeding.Eleven studies were included in the analysis that encompassed 881 patients. The mean age ranged from 45.4 to 66.8 years, and the proportion of the population that was male ranged from 45 to 85%. The overall in-hospital mortality rate was 8%. The rate of stroke, spinal cord injury, renal failure, and frequency of reoperations for bleeding were 3, 4, 5, and 5, respectively. Sensitivity analysis indicates that the findings are robust and there was no publication bias.These findings indicate that the frozen elephant techniques does not bring unacceptable mortality or morbidity risk for treating acute type A aortic dissection. 
Mucuna pruriens Linn. (Fabaceae) is a tropical legume, traditionally used for controlling blood pressure. Inhibition of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) is one of the successful strategies for controlling hypertension.
The present study evaluated the ACE inhibition potential of the standardized extract of M. pruriens seeds.
Standardization of the extract and its fractions were carried out by RP-HPLC method [methanol and 1% v/v acetic acid in water (5:95 v/v)] using levodopa as a marker. The ACE inhibition activity of the extract and fractions was evaluated at different concentrations (20, 40, 60, 80, and 100 µg/mL) using the HPLC-DAD and the UV spectrophotometric method. The liberation of hippuric acid (HA) from hippuryl-L-histidyl-L-leucine (HHL) was estimated in the spectrophotometric method and RP-HPLC assay at 228 nm.
Methanol extract and aqueous fraction showed a maximum activity with IC50 values of 38.44 ± 0.90 and 57.07 ± 2.90 µg/mL (RP-HPLC), and 52.68 ± 2.02 and 67.65 ± 2.40 µg/mL (spectrophotometry), respectively.
The study revealed that the aqueous extract contains the highest amount of levodopa. Eventually the methanol extract showed highest ACE inhibition activity except levodopa alone. It was further observed that the inhibition was altered with respect to the change in the content of levodopa in the extract. Thus, it can be assumed that levodopa may be responsible for the ACE inhibition activity of M. pruriens seeds.
It can be concluded that M. pruriens seed is a potential ACE inhibitor can be explored further as an effective antihypertensive agent.
The lean body weight phenotype of hepatic lipase (HL)-deficient mice (hl(-/-)) suggests that HL is required for normal weight gain, but the underlying mechanisms are unknown. HL plays a unique role in lipoprotein metabolism performing bridging as well as catalytic functions, either of which could participate in energy homeostasis. To determine if both the catalytic and bridging functions or the catalytic function alone are required for the effect of HL on body weight, we studied (hl(-/-)) mice that transgenically express physiologic levels of human (h)HL (with catalytic and bridging functions) or a catalytically-inactive (ci)HL variant (with bridging function only) in which the catalytic Serine 145 was mutated to Alanine. As expected, HL activity in postheparin plasma was restored to physiologic levels only in hHL-transgenic mice (hl(-/-)hHL). During high-fat diet feeding, hHL-transgenic mice exhibited increased body weight gain and body adiposity relative to hl(-/-)ciHL mice. A similar, albeit less robust effect was observed in female hHL-transgenic relative to hl(-/-)ciHL mice. To delineate the basis for this effect, we determined cumulative food intake and measured energy expenditure using calorimetry. Interestingly, in both genders, food intake was 5-10% higher in hl(-/-)hHL mice relative to hl(-/-)ciHL controls. Similarly, energy expenditure was ~10% lower in HL-transgenic mice after adjusting for differences in total body weight. Our results demonstrate that (1) the catalytic function of HL is required to rescue the lean body weight phenotype of hl(-/-) mice; (2) this effect involves complementary changes in both sides of the energy balance equation; and (3) the bridging function alone is insufficient to rescue the lean phenotype of hl(-/-)ciHL mice. 
The effects of the phosphorylation state of the glycogen synthase kinase 3β involved in the cardiac myocytes (jelly-like cells) epithelial-mesenchymal transition-associated migration during heart-valve formation were examined through the valproic acid-induced cardiac teratogenicity of transgenic line A34 of Tg in a the Brachydanio rerio embryo model. Valproic acid is an effective anti-epileptic drug; however, when taken by pregnant women to treat epilepsy, it can produce cardiac developmental defects in fetuses. In this study, the role of glycogen synthase kinase 3β in valproic acid-induced cardiac teratogenicity was investigated. Transgenic line A34 of zebrafish embryos was used at 3 days postfertilization. The results show that 78% (18/23) of the embryos treated with 0.10 mM valproic acid (group A) had incomplete chamber formation with normal looping and 22 % (5/23) had abnormal looping. Bradycardia was also found in comparison with control embryos (P &lt; 0.001). For the embryos treated with 0.25 mM valproic acid (group B), 92% (22/24) demonstrated chamber formation failure and looping abnormality. Pericardial effusion, noncontracting ventricles, and enlarged, slowly beating atriums were observed at 6 days postfertilization. Valproic acid inhibited phosphorylation of serine 9 in glycogen synthase kinase 3β in a dose-dependent manner. According to immunochemical staining results, valproic acid was shown to inhibit the mass migration and proliferation of cardiomyocytes in the development of the heart-valve region through inhibition of the GSK3β Ser 9 phosphorylation. Folic acid rescued the GSK3β Ser 9 phosphorylation and reversed the valproic acid-induced cardiac morphological, functional, and biochemical defects.
Histopathological classification of lung cancer has important implications in the application of clinical practice guidelines and the prediction of patient prognosis. Thus, we focused on discovering glycobiomarker candidates to classify the types of lung cancer tissue. First, we performed lectin microarray analysis of lung cancer tissue specimens and cell lines and identified Aleuria aurantia lectin (AAL), Hippeastrum hybrid lectin (HHL), and Concanavalia ensiformis agglutinin (ConA) as lectin probes specific to non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC). LC-MS-based analysis was performed for the comprehensive identification of glycoproteins and N-linked glycosylation sites using lectin affinity capture of NSCLC-specific glycoforms of glycoproteins. This analysis identified 1092 AAL-bound glycoproteins (316 gene symbols) and 948 HHL/ConA-bound glycoproteins (279 gene symbols). The lectin microarray-assisted verification using 15 lung cancer cell lines revealed the NSCLC-specific expression of fibronectin. The glycosylation profiling of fibronectin indicated that the peanut agglutinin (PNA) signal appeared to differentiate two NSCLC types, adenocarcinoma and large cell carcinoma, whereas the protein expression level was similar between these types. Our glycoproteomics approach together with the concurrent use of an antibody and lectin is applicable to the quantitative and qualitative monitoring of variations in glycosylation of fibronectin specific to certain types of lung cancer tissue. 
Modern treatment of Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL) has transformed its prognosis but causes late effects, including premature menopause. Cohort studies of premature menopause risks after treatment have been relatively small, and knowledge about these risks is limited.
Nonsurgical menopause risk was analyzed in 2127 women treated for HL in England and Wales at ages younger than 36 years from 1960 through 2004 and followed to 2003 through 2012. Risks were estimated using Cox regression, modified Poisson regression, and competing risks. All statistical tests were two-sided.
During follow-up, 605 patients underwent nonsurgical menopause before age 40 years. Risk of premature menopause increased more than 20-fold after ovarian radiotherapy, alkylating chemotherapy other than dacarbazine, or BEAM (bis-chloroethylnitrosourea [BCNU], etoposide, cytarabine, melphalan) chemotherapy for stem cell transplantation, but was not statistically significantly raised after adriamycin, bleomycin, vinblastine, dacarbazine (ABVD). Menopause generally occurred sooner after ovarian radiotherapy (62.5% within five years of ≥5 Gy treatment) and BEAM (50.9% within five years) than after alkylating chemotherapy (24.2% within five years of ≥6 cycles), and after treatment at older than at younger ages. Cumulative risk of menopause by age 40 years was 81.3% after greater than or equal to 5Gy ovarian radiotherapy, 75.3% after BEAM, 49.1% after greater than or equal to 6 cycles alkylating chemotherapy, 1.4% after ABVD, and 3.0% after solely supradiaphragmatic radiotherapy. Tables of individualized risk information for patients by future period, treatment type, dose and age are provided.
Patients treated with HL need to plan intended pregnancies using personalized information on their risk of menopause by different future time points.
Qatar is a sovereign state located on the Eastern coast of the Arabian Peninsula in the Persian Gulf. Its native population consists of 3 major subgroups: people of Arabian origin or Bedouins, those from an Eastern or Persian ancestry and individuals with African admixture. Historically, all types of consanguineous marriages have been and still are common in the Qatari population, particularly among first and double-first cousins. Thus, there is a higher risk for most inherited diseases including hereditary hearing loss (HHL). In particular, a hearing loss prevalence of 5.2% has been reported in Qatar, with parental consanguinity being more common among affected individuals as compared with unaffected ones. Our recent molecular results confirm a high homogeneity and level of inbreeding in Qatari HHL patients. Among all HHL genes, GJB2, the major player worldwide, accounts for a minor proportion of cases and at least 3 additional genes have been found to be mutated in Qatari patients. Interestingly, one gene, BDP1, has been described to cause HHL only in this country. These results point towards an unexpected level of genetic heterogeneity despite the high level of inbreeding. This review provides an up-to-date picture of HHL in Qatar and of the impact of consanguinity on this disease.
This study aimed to examine whether expression of human hepatic lipase (hHL) exerted an intracellular effect on hepatic production of apolipoprotein (apo) A-I. The levels of secreted and cell-associated apoA-I were contrasted between primary hepatocytes isolated from Lipc-null and C57BL/6 mice, and between Lipc-null hepatocytes transfected with either hHL-encoding or control adenovirus. An HSPG-binding deficient hHL protein (hHLmt) was used to determine the impact of cell surface binding on HL action. Accumulation of apoA-I in conditioned media of primary hepatocytes isolated from Lipc-null mice was increased as compared to that from C57BL/6 mice. Metabolic labeling experiments showed that secretion of (35)S-apoA-I from Lipc-null cells was significantly higher than that from C57BL/6 cells. Expression of hHL in Lipc-null hepatocytes, through adenovirus-mediated gene transfer, resulted in decreased synthesis and secretion of (35)S-apoA-I, but not (35)S-apoE, as compared with cells transfected with control adenovirus. Expression of HSPG-binding deficient hHLmt in Lipc-null cells also exerted an inhibitory effect on apoA-I production, even though hHLmt displayed impaired exit from the endoplasmic reticulum as compared with hHL. Subcellular fractionation revealed that expression of hHL or hHLmt led to increased microsome-association of apoA-I relative to non-transfected control. Expression of hHL negatively impacts hepatic production of apoA-I. 
Pregabalin (PGB) displays analgesic and anticonvulsant activities. Regulation of the resting membrane potential (RMP) by renal outer medullary potassium (ROMK1) channels may provide a mechanism for these activities. We examined the effects of PGB on ROMK1 channel activity. To investigate the regulatory effect of PGB on the activity of ROMK1 channel, we used inside-out excised membrane patches to measure the K+ current in Xenopus oocytes expressed either the wild-type (WT) or mutant ROMK1 channels. PGB concentration-dependently enhanced the activity of ROMK1 channels. PGB increases the WT channels, pHi gating residue mutant channels (K80M) and the mutant channels at phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate (PIP2)-binding sites (R188Q, R217A, and K218A). Our study suggests that PGB in the regulating of ROMK1 channel function are neither by pHi- nor PIP2-dependent mechanism. We found PGB failed to prompt the activity of consensus phosphorylation sites for protein kinase C (PKC) mutated channels (S183A, T191A, T193A, S201A and T234A). Furthermore, PGB did not stimulate the activity of channels in the presence of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) inhibitors, the mutants of the C-terminal PKA-phosphorylation sites (S219A and S313A), and the mutants constructed (S219D and S313D) which mimic the addition of negative charged associated with phosphorylation bound to a serine. These results demonstrated that PKA- and PKC-mediated phosphorylation represents a novel mechanism for PGB-activated ROMK1 channels. The enhancement of ROMK1 currents proves to an important molecular mechanism underlying the analgesic/anticonvulsant property of PGB for the restoration of RMP.
After introducing radiation-free spinometry as a diagnostic tool to predict prevalent vertebral fractures, its validity and comparison with established tools such as historical height loss (HHL) was missing. This study shows that radiation-free spinometry is valid and its application adds predictive power to the ability of HHL to assess presence of vertebral fractures.
Recently, radiation-free spinometry was introduced to identify patients with vertebral fractures (VFs). The goals of this study were to validate previous findings and to test the predictive accuracy of radiation-free spinometry compared to the assessment of historical height loss (HHL).
We analyzed 304 patients [258 (85%) females (age range, 42-90 years) and 46 males (50-84 years)], including 108 patients with VFs. We performed receiver operator characteristic and net reclassification improvement (NRI) analyses to quantify the predictive power and the added predictive ability of radiation-free spinometry and HHL for VFs.
The estimated odds ratios in the thoracic and the lumbar spine showed no significant differences compared to the previously published, except for the effect of thoracic kyphosis in region "Th12 + L4-5." Radiation-free spinometry and HHL were both moderately accurate to raise suspicion for VFs. According to the NRI, which is defined as the net sum of the predicted risk increase in individuals who have VFs and the predicted net risk decrease for those who have not, we found significant improvements in all regions of interest when HHL and radiation-free spinometry were used in combination (area under the curve (AUC) 0.729-0.788).
Our results based on a new data set suggest validity of the prognostic score published previously. In addition, although our findings did not confirm our initial hypothesis that radiation-free spinometry alone performs superior to the assessment of HHL to predict VFs, we showed that radiation-free spinometry still adds predictive power to the ability of HHL to discriminate patients with VFs.
In the present study, we investigated the potential efficacy of cruciferous vegetable-derived sulforaphane (SFN) in improving homocysteine (HCY)-stressed cells. After human hepatocyte line HHL-5 was preincubated with SFN and subsequently with 10 mmol/L HCY, SFN improved the pathologic changes which are caused by HCY, including cell morphological abnormality, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) swelling, excessive generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), the increased malondialdehyde (MDA) levels, as well as the increased activities of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST). Phase II enzymes, thioredoxin reductase-1 (TrxR-1) and
quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1), were involved in the protective effect of SFN against injury by HCY. The ER stress-specific proteins, such as glucose-regulated protein-78 (GRP78) and protein kinase RNA (PKR)-like ER kinase (PERK), were strikingly abolished by SFN. Furthermore, Nrf-2 translocation was enhanced by SFN, which lead to the induction of TrxR-1and NQO1.
Phenytoin is an effective anti-epileptic drug that inhibits Na(+) channel activities; however, how phenytoin modulates synaptic transmission to soothe epileptic symptoms is not clear. To characterize the effects of phenytoin regulation on neurotransmission, we studied the electrophysical properties of cultured embryonic cortical neurons. Phenytoin inhibited the inward Na(+) current in a dose-dependent manner with an IC50 of 16.8 μM, and at 100 μM, the inhibitory effect of phenytoin on the Na(+) current was proportional to the frequency applied. In cultured neurons, phenytoin significantly decreased the action potential firing rate and the peak potential. To study the effect of phenytoin in neurotransmission, we measured the Ca(2+) responses from stimulated target neurons and their neighboring neurons. Phenytoin significantly suppressed the Ca(2+) responses evoked by strong stimulations in the target and neighboring neurons, and exerted a decreased inhibitory effect under moderate stimulation. Picrotoxin, a GABAA receptor antagonist, enhanced the recorded spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic current activities. After picrotoxin-induced enhancement, phenytoin had a more pronounced effect on the suppression of the spontaneous hyper-exciting excitatory postsynaptic current (&gt;100 pA), but it only mildly inhibited the general excitatory postsynaptic current. Our results demonstrate that phenytoin suppresses the efficacy of neurotransmission especially for the high-frequency stimulation by reducing the Na(+) channel activity and can potentially alleviate epileptiform activity. 
Young children in military families with a member who has a life changing injury can experience emotional difficulties and behavior changes.
This study evaluated a Sesame Workshop multimedia kit called: Talk, Listen, Connect: Changes (TLC-II(C); 2008). The kit, which included video and print materials, aimed to help caregivers (i.e., at-home partner, at-home relative or family member of a current or discharged military member) assist young children as they adjusted to their parent's injury. We expected that the materials would be used and their quality evaluated. We hypothesized that use of the materials would produce improvements in caregiver and child outcomes as well as reductions in perceptions of disruption in the home. We also predicted that kit-use would have a positive impact on the family.
One-hundred and fifty three families with children aged 2-8 years were randomly assigned to receive the kit being evaluated (TLC-II(C)) or a control kit (Healthy Habits for Life (HHL)), also developed by Sesame Workshop. Group outcomes were compared four weeks following receipt of the kits using multivariate analysis of variance.
All materials were well used and highly rated. All caregivers reported less social isolation, less child aggression, and significantly less disruptive home environments after kit use. Test group caregivers reported significantly greater reductions in depressive symptoms and significant increases in children's social competence over time in comparison to the control group.
These results signal important improvements among families as a consequence of using either test or control materials. As a preventative intervention designed for families with an injured member, TLC-II(C) was particularly effective at improving coping.
This study explores the relationship between aflatoxin and the insulin-like growth factor (IGF) axis and its potential effect on child growth.
One hundred and ninety-nine Kenyan schoolchildren were studied for aflatoxin-albumin adduct (AF-alb), IGF1 and IGF-binding protein-3 (IGFBP3) levels using ELISA. AF-alb was inversely associated with IGF1 and IGFBP3 (p &lt; 0.05). Both IGF1 and IGFBP3 were significantly associated with child height and weight (p &lt; 0.01). Children in the highest tertile of AF-alb exposure (&gt;198.5 pg/mg) were shorter than children in the lowest tertile (&lt;74.5 pg/mg), after adjusting for confounders (p = 0.043). Path analysis suggested that IGF1 levels explained ∼16% of the impact of aflatoxin exposure on child height (p = 0.052). To further investigate this putative mechanistic pathway, HHL-16 liver cells (where HHL-16 is human hepatocyte line 16 cells) were treated with aflatoxin B1 (0.5, 5 and 20 μg/mL for 24-48 h). IGF1 and IGFBP3 gene expression measured by quantitative PCR and protein in culture media showed a significant down-regulation of IGF genes and reduced IGF protein levels.
Aflatoxin treatment resulted in a significant decrease in IGF gene and protein expression in vitro. IGF protein levels were also lower in children with the highest levels of AFB-alb adducts. The data suggest that aflatoxin-induced changes in IGF protein levels could contribute to growth impairment where aflatoxin exposure is high.
The effects of different modes of hypoxic exercise training on free radical production and antioxidant enzyme activity in the brain of rats were investigated in this study. A total of 40 healthy 2-month-old male Wister rats were randomly assigned to 5 groups according to different training modes. Endurance training sessions were performed for 5 weeks under different normoxic (atmospheric pressure ~632 mmHg, altitude ~1,500 m) and hypoxic conditions (atmospheric pressure ~493 mmHg, altitude ~3,500 m) at the same relative intensity. The superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) and catalase (CAT) activity and the malondialdehyde (MDA) content of the brain were evaluated by spectrophotometric analysis. Compared to the low-training low (LL) group, the SOD activity was significantly increased by 68.73, 54.28 and 304.02% in the high-training high (HH), high-training low (HL) and high-exercise high-training low (HHL) groups, respectively. However, no obvious change was observed for the low-training high (LH) group. In comparison to the LL group, the GSH-Px activity was found to be significantly higher in the HH, HL, LH and HHL groups. Similarly, in comparison to the LL group, the CAT activity exhibited a significant increase in the HH, HL, LH and HHL groups. Compared to the LL group, the MDA content was significantly increased in the HH, HL and HHL groups, although no significant difference was detected for the LH group. Following exhaustive exercise, the antioxidant enzyme activities in the rat brains were immediately improved in all the hypoxia modes. Moreover, the free radical production was increased after all the modes of hypoxic exercise training, with the LH mode being the only exception.
Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and c-Fos are shown to promote epileptogenesis and are taken as a marker of neuronal activity. The present study investigated the expression of BDNF and c-Fos in mice brain with pentylenetetrazol- (PTZ-) induced generalized seizure and evaluated the effect of novel tryptamine derivative HHL-6 on the expression of these two markers. The subconvulsive dose of PTZ (50 mg/kg) was administered on alternate days in the experimental groups until the seizure scores 4-5 developed in the PTZ-control group. At the end of each experiment, animals were sacrificed, brain samples were collected and cryosectioned, and immunohistochemical analysis of BDNF and c-Fos protein was performed. Data obtained from two sections per mouse (n = 12 animals/group) is presented as means ± S.E.M. The test compound HHL-6 demonstrated a potent anticonvulsant activity in the PTZ-induced seizure in mice. Significant reduction in the BDNF (P &lt; 0.003) and c-Fos (P &lt; 0.01) protein expression was observed in the HHL-6 treated group. Based on these results we suggest that one of the possible mechanisms of HHL-6 to inhibit epileptogenesis might be due to its controlling effect on the cellular and molecular expression of the factors that contribute to the development of epileptogenic plasticity in the CNS. 
The X-ray powder diffraction pattern that corresponds to the disordered state of kalsilite (potassium aluminium orthosilicate), KAlSiO4, is investigated. The directionality of (Al,Si)O4 tetrahedra within single six-membered tetrahedral ring building units (S6R) could not be defined. With equal probability for the directionality of each tetrahedra within one S6R [free apex pointing up (U) or down (D)], an undefined sequence of U and D directionalities is needed to describe the S6R building units. The extinction conditions of disordered kalsilite are also different compared to ordered kalsilite within the space group P63. In disordered kalsilite, h0l and hhl reflections with l = 2n + 1 are systematically absent. 
It is unknown how well prediction models incorporating multiple risk factors identify women with radiographic prevalent vertebral fracture (PVFx) compared with simpler models and what their value might be in clinical practice to select older women for lateral spine imaging. We compared 4 regression models for predicting PVFx in women aged 68 y and older enrolled in the Study of Osteoporotic Fractures with a femoral neck T-score ≤ -1.0, using area under receiving operator characteristic curves (AUROC) and a net reclassification index. The AUROC for a model with age, femoral neck bone mineral density, historical height loss (HHL), prior nonspine fracture, body mass index, back pain, and grip strength was only minimally better than that of a more parsimonious model with age, femoral neck bone mineral density, and historical height loss (AUROC 0.689 vs 0.679, p values for difference in 5 bootstrapped samples &lt;0.001-0.35). The prevalence of PVFx among this older population of Caucasian women remained more than 20% even when women with low probability of PVFx, as estimated by the prediction models, were included in the screened population. These results suggest that lateral spine imaging is appropriate to consider for all Caucasian women aged 70 y and older with low bone mass to identify those with PVFx. 
Angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) has two functional N- and C-domain active centers that display differences in the metabolism of biologically-active peptides including the hemoregulatory tetrapeptide, Ac-SDKP, hydrolysed preferentially by the N domain active center. Elevated Ac-SDKP concentrations are associated with reduced tissue fibrosis.
We identified a patient of African descent exhibiting unusual blood ACE kinetics with reduced relative hydrolysis of two synthetic ACE substrates (ZPHL/HHL ratio) suggestive of the ACE N domain center inactivation. Inhibition of blood ACE activity by anti-catalytic mAbs and ACE inhibitors and conformational fingerprint of blood ACE suggested overall conformational changes in the ACE molecule and sequencing identified Ser333Trp substitution in the N domain of ACE. In silico analysis demonstrated S333W localized in the S1 pocket of the active site of the N domain with the bulky Trp adversely affecting binding of ACE substrates due to steric hindrance. Expression of mutant ACE (S333W) in CHO cells confirmed altered kinetic properties of mutant ACE and conformational changes in the N domain. Further, the S333W mutant displayed decreased ability (5-fold) to cleave the physiological substrate AcSDKP compared to wild-type ACE.
A novel Ser333Trp ACE mutation results in dramatic changes in ACE kinetic properties and lowered clearance of Ac-SDKP. Individuals with this mutation (likely with significantly increased levels of the hemoregulatory tetrapeptide in blood and tissues), may confer protection against fibrosis.
Hypertension is an independent yet controllable risk factor for cardiovascular diseases. Synthetic angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors used to treat hypertension are often associated with adverse effects, and the interest in diet-related inhibitors is increasing. We hypothesized that North Atlantic fish hydrolysate might inhibit ACE, thus preventing hypertension. We assessed the ACE inhibitory potential of various North Atlantic fish species and evaluated the effect of dietary supplementation of fish hydrolysates on the blood pressure of spontaneously hypertensive rats. Fish samples were hydrolyzed using simulated gastrointestinal digestion, and ACE inhibitory activity was evaluated using an ACE inhibitory activity assay. In vivo anti-hypertensive effects were evaluated by administering hydrolysates of wild Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua L.), haddock (Melanogrammus aeglefinus L.), or farmed Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.) to 10-week-old male, spontaneously hypertensive rats for 4 weeks. The dosing was 200 mg/kg body weight for 21 days, followed by 500 mg/kg body weight for 7 days. Water and Captopril (20 mg/kg body weight) were administered as the negative and positive controls, respectively. The analyzed fish hydrolysates exhibited a 50% ACE inhibition coefficient (IC50) of 1 to 2.7 μg/mU ACE. Fish hydrolysate supplements did not significantly inhibit the increase in blood pressure during the experimental period. The group receiving cod supplement had a lower (not significant) increase in blood pressure compared to the other groups. Although further studies are necessary to verify the antihypertensive effect of cod, the results obtained in this study indicate the potential that cod hydrolysate may have in inhibiting hypertension.
Aeromonads are inhabitants of aquatic ecosystems and are described as being involved in intestinal disturbances and other infections. The purpose of this study was to investigate the production of N-acyl-homoserine lactone (AHL) signal molecules and some virulence factors, including hemolysins, proteases, extracellular nucleases production and cytotoxicity by waterborne Aeromonas hydrophila. A total of 24 strains isolated from fresh-water or diseased fish were used in the study. The majority A.hydrophila strains produce two AHL molecules (21/24), one is N-butanoyl homoserine lactone (BHL), and the other is N-hexanoyl homoserine lactone (HHL) according to thin-layer chromatography analysis. Among the virulence factors tested, more than 83 % of the isolates produced β haemolysin when inoculated on sheep blood agar, only 50 % of the isolates displayed DNase activity, 75 % of the isolates shown proteolytic activity on skimmed milk plate, and cytotoxic activity was detected in 20 of 24 of the isolates. The strains producing AHLs possessed one or more virulence factors. In conclusion, the production of quorum sensing signal molecules is common among the strains that we examined, and there seems to some relationships between quorum sensing signal production and virulence factors in A. hydrophila. 
The German healthcare system is facing ongoing radical change and development. The increasing tendency to urge hospitals and medical staff to work in a profit-oriented way constitute among other factors clear present and future challenges. Physicians and surgeons in particular increasingly complain of increasing stress attributed to measures aiming at cost reduction in hospitals. The highest priority must always be patient satisfaction and the delivery of good medical and human service. Problem description: The health care market in Germany has become an increasingly complex business with uncertain and unpredictable future events. Strategic planning has to enable hospitals to quickly and flexibly adapt strategies to changes in the environment that become essential to their success. The most important task is to develop a strategy that can be applied with success in all possible future scenarios. This is known as the core strategy.
The core strategy for hospitals in Germany is complementary education of the medical staff as well as top management. Accordingly, courses, workshops or even part-time graduate or postgraduate education in business and economics are recommended for the medical staff. As far as non-medical hospital executives are concerned, there is no better way than to host them in a hospital department for a period of 6-12 months. This paves the way for understanding and accepting each others' opinion which increases hospital performance.
Proper and complementary education of the medical staff as well as of non-medical top executives and managers of hospitals is recommended as the core strategy. This harmonizes both professional medical and managerial efforts with a synergy effect that allows soundly facing the increasingly challenging environment of the health care sector in general and in hospitals in particular.
Einleitung: Das deutsche Gesundheitswesen steht vor anhaltenden Umbrüchen und Entwicklungen. Die zunehmende Tendenz, Krankenhäuser und medizinisches Personal zu drängen, ertragsorientiert zu arbeiten, stellt zusammen mit anderen Faktoren eine Herausforderung für Gegenwart und Zukunft dar. Ärzte und Chirurgen klagen über zunehmenden Stress, der auf Maßnahmen zur Kostensenkung in Krankenhäusern zurückzuführen ist. Die höchste Priorität muss immer die Zufriedenheit der Patienten und die Sicherstellung von gutem medizinischen und menschlichen Service haben.Problembeschreibung: Der Gesundheitsmarkt in Deutschland wurde zu einem immer komplexer werdenden Geschäft mit unsicheren und unvorhersehbaren zukünftigen Ereignissen. Die strategische Planung muss den Krankenhäusern ermöglichen, die Strategie schnell und flexibel an die Veränderungen in der Umwelt anzupassen, da dies für ihren Erfolg wesentlich ist. Die wichtigste Aufgabe ist es, eine Strategie zu entwickeln, die mit Erfolg in allen möglichen Zukunftsszenarien angewendet werden kann. Diese ist als die Kernstrategie bekannt.Diskussion: Die Kernstrategie für Krankenhäuser in Deutschland ist die komplementäre Ausbildung des medizinischen Personals sowie des Top-Managements. Dementsprechend sollen Kurse, Workshops oder auch Teilzeit-Studium oder weiterführende Ausbildung in Betriebs- und Volkswirtschaft für das medizinische Personal empfohlen werden. Soweit nicht-medizinische Krankenhausführungskräfte betroffen sind, gibt es keinen besseren Weg, als sie in medizinischen Krankenhausabteilungen für einen Zeitraum von 6–12 Monaten hospitieren zu lassen. Dies bahnt den Weg für besseres Verständnis und bessere Kooperation und somit erhöhte Krankenhausleistung.Fazit: Die angemessene und komplementäre Ausbildung des medizinischen Personals und der nicht-medizinischen Top-Führungskräfte und Manager von Krankenhäusern wird als Kernstrategie empfohlen. Dies bringt die Bemühungen der Mediziner sowie die der nichtmedizinischen Führungskräfte in Einklang. Somit wird den Krankenhäusern der erfolgreiche Umgang mit dem zunehmend herausfordernden Umfeld des Gesundheitswesens ermöglicht.
This represents the first systematic study where levan polysaccharide was used to fabricate fibrous matrices by co-axial and single-needle electrospinning techniques. For this, hydrolyzed (hHL) and sulfated hydrolyzed (ShHL) Halomonas levan were chemically synthesized and used together with polycaprolactone (PCL) and polyethyleneoxide (PEO) for the spinning process. In co-axially spun matrices, ultimate tensile strength (UTS) were found to increase with increasing ShHL concentration and elongation at break of PCL + ShHL matrices increased up to ten-fold when compared to PCL matrices. Similarly, in single-needle spun matrices, higher elongation at break values were obtained by blending HL and ShHL with PEO pointing to the effective energy absorbing features. Dense and fine fibers were characterized by FTIR and SEM. Cell viability and fluorescence imaging of L929 fibroblasts and HUVECs as well as heparin mimetic activity of the matrices pointed to their high potential to be used in decreasing neointimal proliferation and thrombogenicity of grafts and prosthesis.
In the present study, a novel angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitory (ACE inhibitory) peptide, EPNGLLLPQY, derived from walnut seed storage protein, fragment residues 80-89, was identified by ultra-high performance liquid chromatography electrospray ionization quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-ESI-Q-TOF-MS/MS) from walnut protein hydrolysate. The IC50 value of the peptide was 233.178 μM, which was determined by the high performance liquid chromatography method by measuring the amount of hippuric acid (HA) generated from the ACE decomposition substrate (hippuryl-l-histidyl-l-leucine (HHL) to assess the ACE activity. Enzyme inhibitory kinetics of the peptide against ACE were also conducted, by which the inhibitory mechanism of ACE-inhibitory peptide was confirmed. Moreover, molecular docking was simulated by Discovery Studio 2017 R2 software to provide the potential mechanisms underlying the ACE-inhibitory activity of EPNGLLLPQY.
Quorum sensing (QS) regulates important bacterial behaviors such as virulent protein production and biofilm formation. QS requires that molecular signals are exchanged between cells, extracellularly, where environmental conditions influence signal stability. In this work, we present a novel complexation between metal cations (Ag+ and Cu2+) and a QS autoinducer signal, N-hexanoyl- L-homoserine lactone (HHL). The molecular interactions were investigated using mass spectrometery, attenuated total reflectance-Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and computational simulations. Results show that HHL forms predominantly 1:1 complexes with Ag+ ( Kd = 3.41 × 10-4 M) or Cu2+ ( Kd = 1.40 × 10-5 M), with the coordination chemistry occurring on the oxygen moieties. In vivo experiments with Chromobacterium violaceum CV026 show that sublethal concentrations of Ag+ and Cu2+ decreased HHL-regulated QS activity. Furthermore, when Ag+ was preincubated with HHL, Ag+ toxicity to CV026 decreased by an order of magnitude, suggesting HHL:metal complexes alter the bioavailability of the individual constituents.
Gaucher disease is characterized by the activation of splenic and hepatic macrophages, accompanied by dramatically increased levels of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). To evaluate the source of the elevated blood ACE, we performed complete ACE phenotyping using blood, spleen and liver samples from patients with Gaucher disease and controls.
ACE phenotyping included 1) immunohistochemical staining for ACE; 2) measuring ACE activity with two substrates (HHL and ZPHL); 3) calculating the ratio of the rates of substrate hydrolysis (ZPHL/HHL ratio); 4) assessing the conformational fingerprint of ACE by evaluating the pattern of binding of monoclonal antibodies to 16 different ACE epitopes.
We show that in patients with Gaucher disease, the dramatically increased levels of ACE originate from activated splenic and/or hepatic macrophages (Gaucher cells), and that both its conformational fingerprint and kinetic characteristics (ZPHL/HHL ratio) differ from controls and from patients with sarcoid granulomas. Furthermore, normal spleen was found to produce high levels of endogenous ACE inhibitors and a novel, tightly-bound 10-30 kDa ACE effector which is deficient in Gaucher spleen.
The conformation of ACE is tissue-specific. In Gaucher disease, ACE produced by activated splenic macrophages differs from that in hepatic macrophages, as well as from macrophages and dendritic cells in sarcoid granulomas. The observed differences are likely due to altered ACE glycosylation or sialylation in these diseased organs. The conformational differences in ACE may serve as a specific biomarker for Gaucher disease.
Male urinary incontinence is thought to be infrequent. We sought to describe the prevalence of urinary incontinence in a male treatment seeking cohort enrolled in the LURN (Symptoms of Lower Urinary Tract Dysfunction Research Network).
Study inclusion and exclusion criteria, including men with prostate cancer or neurogenic bladder, were previously reported. LURN participants prospectively completed questionnaires regarding lower urinary tract symptoms and other clinical variables. Men were grouped based on incontinence type, including 1) no urinary incontinence, 2) post-void dribbling only and 3) urinary incontinence. Comparisons were made using ANOVA and multivariable regression.
Of the 477 men 24% reported no urinary incontinence, 44% reported post-void dribbling only and 32% reported urinary incontinence. African American men and those with sleep apnea were more likely to be in the urinary incontinence group than in the no urinary incontinence group (OR 3.2, p = 0.02 and OR 2.73, p = 0.003, respectively). Urinary incontinence was associated with significantly higher bother compared to men without leakage (p &lt;0.001). Compared to men without urinary incontinence and men with only post-void dribbling those with urinary incontinence were significantly more likely to report higher scores (more severe symptoms) on the PROMIS (Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System) questionnaires regarding bowel issues, depression and anxiety than men without urinary incontinence (p &lt;0.01).
Urinary incontinence is common among treatment seeking men. This is concerning because the guideline recommended questionnaires to assess male lower urinary tract symptoms do not query for urinary incontinence. Thus, clinicians may be missing an opportunity to intervene and improve patient care. This provides a substantial rationale for a new or updated symptom questionnaire which provides a more comprehensive symptom assessment.
When the sexual activity of bucks is minimal, there is a minimal male effect on does regardless of their body weight (BW)/body condition (BC) and whether does are treated with melatonin or not. The study examines whether sexually active bucks can induce an adequate male effect in does with an increasing or decreasing trajectory of change in BW/BC when does are or not treated with melatonin. During natural anoestrus, 46 Blanca Andaluza does were assigned to two groups: 1) low BW/low BC group in which does were fed 1.9 times maintenance requirements for dietary energy for gaining BW/BC (LLg group; n = 23); or 2) a high BW/high BC group in which the does were fed 0.4 times maintenance requirements for dietary energy that resulted in a loss of BW/BC (HHl group; n = 23). There were similar numbers of does in each group that were treated or not treated with melatonin (MEL). Following 48 days of isolation from bucks, four sexually active individuals fitted with marking harnesses were transferred to the paddock containing the does of each group. Blood samples were collected by jugular venipuncture (before the distribution of concentrate) twice per week. The effect of the treatments (increasing or decreasing BW/BC and melatonin) on the different variables that were assessed were analysed using an ANOVA or the Fisher-Freeman-Halton exact probability test as necessary. During the 35 days after treatments were applied, the percentage of females expressing oestrous and having an ovulation were greater in the LLg + MEL than HHl-MEL subgroup (P &lt; 0.05). The interaction of nutrition × melatonin treatment had a significant effect on reproduction of does (P &lt; 0.05). This could be explained by the greater plasma glucose and IGF-1 and lesser plasma non-esterified fatty acid concentrations in does with increasing BW/BC (P &lt; 0.01), and the greater IGF-1 concentrations of MEL-treated females (P &lt; 0.01). The LH concentration and pulsatile release of this hormone from the pituitary were also modified by the presence of the males (P &lt; 0.01). Furthermore, the LLg + MEL-treated does were responsive to the presence of bucks (P &lt; 0.05). The present results indicate sexually active males cannot induce an adequate reproductive response in females with decreasing BW/BC even when does are being treated with melatonin. The presence of bucks enhanced the doe reproductive response when does were treated with melatonin and a pattern of increasing BW/BC.
Recent animal studies suggest that noise-induced synaptopathy may underlie a phenomenon that has been labeled hidden hearing loss (HHL). Noise exposure preferentially damages low spontaneous-rate auditory nerve fibers, which are involved in the processing of moderate- to high-level sounds and are more resistant to masking by background noise. Therefore, the effect of synaptopathy may be more evident in suprathreshold measures of auditory function, especially in the presence of background noise. The purpose of this study was to develop a statistical model for estimating HHL in humans using thresholds in noise as the outcome variable and measures that reflect the integrity of sites along the auditory pathway as explanatory variables. Our working hypothesis is that HHL is evident in the portion of the variance observed in thresholds in noise that is not dependent on thresholds in quiet, because this residual variance retains statistical dependence on other measures of suprathreshold function.
Study participants included 13 adults with normal hearing (≤15 dB HL) and 20 adults with normal hearing at 1 kHz and sensorineural hearing loss at 4 kHz (&gt;15 dB HL). Thresholds in noise were measured, and the residual of the correlation between thresholds in noise and thresholds in quiet, which we refer to as thresholds-in-noise residual, was used as the outcome measure for the model. Explanatory measures were as follows: (1) auditory brainstem response (ABR) waves I and V amplitudes; (2) electrocochleographic action potential and summating potential amplitudes; (3) distortion product otoacoustic emissions level; and (4) categorical loudness scaling. All measurements were made at two frequencies (1 and 4 kHz). ABR and electrocochleographic measurements were made at 80 and 100 dB peak equivalent sound pressure level, while wider ranges of levels were tested during distortion product otoacoustic emission and categorical loudness scaling measurements. A model relating the thresholds-in-noise residual and the explanatory measures was created using multiple linear regression analysis.
Predictions of thresholds-in-noise residual using the model accounted for 61% (p &lt; 0.01) and 48% (p &lt; 0.01) of the variance in the measured thresholds-in-noise residual at 1 and 4 kHz, respectively.
Measures of thresholds in noise, the summating potential to action potential ratio, and ABR waves I and V amplitudes may be useful for the prediction of HHL in humans. With further development, our approach of quantifying HHL by the variance that remains in suprathreshold measures of auditory function after removing the variance due to thresholds in quiet, together with our statistical modeling, may provide a quantifiable and verifiable estimate of HHL in humans with normal hearing and with hearing loss. The current results are consistent with the view that inner hair cell and auditory nerve pathology may underlie suprathreshold auditory performance.
Effective prevention strategies require specific actions during the different phases of ischemia-reperfusion (I-R) injury. The objective of our study is to evaluate the effect of aqueous extract of Hypericum humifusum leaves (HHL) on liver I-R model in Rat.
Animals were subjected to 90 min of hepatic ischemia followed by reperfusion (120 min). HHL extract (25 mg/mL/kg) was injected 15 min before reperfusion. To evaluate the effect of HHL extract on I-R, we have monitored transaminases levels, Malondialdehyde (MDA) concentration, histological lesions (apoptosis and necrosis) and compared the results to a reference oxidant vitamin E.
The determination of total phenol extracts of HHL was 59.91 ± 0.35 mg of Gallic Acid/g dry plant material with higher antioxidant activity (91.73% ± 1.67) compared to vitamin E (87.42%). Using aqueous extract of HHL, we noted a significant decrease of AST and ALT [1129 UI (585/1995) and 768 UI (335/1375)] compared to no-treated group [5,585.5 UI (5,035/12,070) and 8,099.5 UI (5,040/12,326)] as a decrease in MDA content [85.7% protection (50.9/91.5)]. HHL extract reduce the damage induced by I-R of 48.7% (27/48.7) and 96.1% (95.7/96.5) for necrosis and apoptosis lesions respectively.
HHL aqueous extract have potential to protect liver from the damage effect induced by I-R better than vitamin E solution.
Human hepatic lipase (hHL) is mainly localized on the hepatocyte cell surface where it hydrolyzes lipids from remnant lipoproteins and high density lipoproteins and promotes their hepatic selective uptake. Furthermore, hepatic lipase (HL) is closely associated with obesity in multiple studies. Therefore, HL may play a key role on lipid homeostasis in liver and white adipose tissue (WAT). In the present study, we aimed to evaluate the effects of hHL expression on hepatic and white adipose triglyceride metabolism in vivo. Experiments were carried out in hHL transgenic and wild-type mice fed a Western-type diet. Triglyceride metabolism studies included β-oxidation and de novo lipogenesis in liver and WAT, hepatic triglyceride secretion, and adipose lipoprotein lipase (LPL)-mediated free fatty acid (FFA) lipolysis and influx. The expression of hHL promoted hepatic triglyceride accumulation and de novo lipogenesis without affecting triglyceride secretion, and this was associated with an upregulation of Srebf1 as well as the main genes controlling the synthesis of fatty acids. Transgenic mice also exhibited more adiposity and an increased LPL-mediated FFA influx into the WAT without affecting glucose tolerance. Our results demonstrate that hHL promoted hepatic steatosis in mice mainly by upregulating de novo lipogenesis. HL also upregulated WAT LPL and promoted triglyceride-rich lipoprotein hydrolysis and adipose FFA uptake. These data support the important role of hHL in regulating hepatic lipid homeostasis and confirm the broad cardiometabolic role of HL.
Non-adherence to antihypertensives is a cause of 'pseudo-treatment-resistant' hypertension.
To determine whether monitoring plasma amlodipine concentrations and inhibition of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) can be adjunct adherence tools.
Patients with hypertension who were prescribed enalapril and amlodipine were enrolled. Blood pressures (BPs) were monitored and an adherence questionnaire was completed. Steady-state amlodipine was assayed using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry and degree of ACE inhibition using the Z-FHL/HHL (z-phenylalanine-histidine-leucine/hippuryl-histidine-leucine) ratio.
One hundred patients (mean (standard deviation) age 50.5 (12) years, 46% male) were enrolled. Based on plasma assays, 26/97 patients (26.8%) were unsuppressed by enalapril and 20/100 (20%) were sub-therapeutic for amlodipine. There were significant BP differences based on plasma levels of the medication: 21/20 mmHg lower in the group with suppressed ACE and 26/20 mmHg in the group with steady-state amlodipine concentrations.
Monitoring antihypertensive adherence by assaying plasma medication concentrations is a feasible option for evaluating true v. pseudo-resistant hypertension.
The aim of this study was to develop experimental and numerical models for a better understanding of hyperthermic laser lipolysis (HHL).
A 3 cm thick porcine fat sample was irradiated over a 4.3 × 4.7 cm2 area for 2 minutes with a 1,064 nm Nd:YAG laser using 1.2 W/cm2 irradiance. Two irradiation scenarios were considered: without and with forced air cooling. Following the irradiation, the sample was left to cool down by natural convection. During the irradiation period, the surface temperature of the sample was continuously recorded by an infrared camera. Additionally, temperature depth profiles during the cooling period were also obtained. A one-dimensional model of the laser irradiation procedure was developed, including light and heat transport. The model was used to determine the absorption coefficient of the fat and the heat convection coefficients from the measured data, and to evaluate the treatment by varying the parameters.
The measured temperature depth profiles revealed a maximum temperature (45.5°C) at the surface for a non-cooled sample, and a surface temperature of 38°C with a subsurface temperature peak of 42.6°C at a depth of 5.7 mm for a cooled sample. This corresponded well with the measured surface temperature increase following the irradiation as a result of heat diffusion from the heated deeper fat layers. The developed numerical model was used to fit the measured data. A good agreement between the model and the measurements was obtained. By varying the treatment parameters, basic empirical relations connecting the treatment, thermal signal, and temperature depth profile parameters were found.
The results of this study provide a better understanding of transcutaneous laser lipolysis. The developed numerical model can be extended to transcutaneous laser lipolysis of human subjects. Lasers Surg. Med. 50:125-136, 2018. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
Background: Chronic infection with HBV (CHB) or HCV (CHC) is the most common chronic viral hepatitis that can lead to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma in humans, their infections have distinct pathogenic processes, however, little is known about the difference of glycoprotein glycopatterns in serum between hepatitis B virus (HBV)- and hepatitis C virus (HCV)-infected patients. Methods: A method combining the lectin microarrays, letin-mediated affinity capture glycoproteins, and MALDI-TOF/TOF-MS was employed to analyze serum protein glycopatterns and identify the glycan structures from patients with CHB (n = 54) or CHC(n = 47), and healthy volunteers (HV, n = 35). Lectin blotting was further utilized to validate and assess the expression levels of their serum glycopatterns. Finally, the differences of the glycoprotein glycopatterns were systematically compared between CHB and CHC patients. Conclusions: As a result, there were 11 lectins (e.g., HHL, GSL-II, and EEL) exhibited significantly increased expression levels, and three lectins (LCA, VVA, and ACA) exhibited significantly decreased expression levels of serum protein glycopatterns only in the CHB patients. However, DBA exhibited significantly decreased expression levels, and two lectins (WGA and SNA) exhibited significantly increased expression levels of serum glycopatterns only in the CHC patients. Furthermore, LEL and MAL-I showed a coincidentally increasing trend in both CHC and CHB patients compared with the HV. The individual analysis demonstrated that eight lectins (MPL, GSL-I, PTL-II, UEA-I, WGA, LEL, VVA, and MAL-I) exhibited a high degree of consistency with the pooled serum samples of HV, CHB, and CHC patients. Besides, a complex-type N-glycans binder PHA-E+L exhibited significantly decreased NFIs in the CHB compared with HV and CHC subjects (p &lt; 0.01). The MALDI-TOF/TOF-MS results of N-linked glycans from the serum glycoproteins isolated by PHA-E+L-magnetic particle conjugates showed that there was an overlap of 23 N-glycan peaks (e.g., m/z 1419.743, 1663.734, and 1743.581) between CHB, and CHC patients, 5 glycan peaks (e.g., m/z 1850.878, 1866.661, and 2037.750) were presented in virus-infected hepatitis patients compared with HV, 3 glycan peaks (1460.659, 2069.740, and 2174.772) were observed only in CHC patients. Our data provide useful information to find new biomarkers for distinguishing CHB and CHC patients based on the precision alteration of their serum glycopatterns.
Glycans are known to play important roles in molecular recognition, cell-cell adhesion, molecular trafficking, receptor activation, and signal transduction during development and regeneration. Despite numerous investigations of regenerating salamander limbs, global analysis of the precise variation of glycans during the limb regeneration process has received little attention. Here, we have used lectin microarrays and lectin histochemistry to analyze the alterations and distribution of glycans during the early stages leading to blastema formation during Cynops orientalis limb regeneration in response to limb amputation. Compared with the control group, analysis at several time points (3, 7, and 14 days postamputation) using microarrays containing 37 lectins showed that limb tissues expressed significantly different complements of glycans recognized by 9 different lectins. Postamputation limb tissues showed higher expression of two glycan structures recognized by the lectins STL and LTL and lower expression of seven glycan structures recognized by PHA-E, MAL-I, SNA, UEA-I, PHA-E + L, VVA, and GNA. We also observed significant changes in glycans specifically at 7 days postamputation, including higher binding capacity by WFA, GSL-I, and NPA and lower binding capacity by PNA, HHL, ConA, LCA, GSL-II, and PWM. Next, we validated our lectin microarray data using lectin histochemistry in limb tissues. Glycans recognized by STL and GNA showed similar changes in signal intensity to those found in the lectin microarrays, with STL staining in the cytoplasm and GNA in the cytoplasm and nucleus. Our findings are the first report of significant postamputation changes in glycans in limb tissues and suggest that those glycans perform potentially important functions during the early stages of C. orientalis limb regeneration.
Cell membrane roughness has been proposed as a sensitive feature to reflect cellular physiological conditions. In order to know whether membrane roughness is associated with the substrate properties, we employed the non-interferometric wide-field optical profilometry (NIWOP) technique to measure the membrane roughness of living mouse embryonic fibroblasts with different conditions of the culture substrate. By controlling the surface density of fibronectin (FN) coated on the substrate, we found that cells exhibited higher membrane roughness as the FN density increased in company with larger focal adhesion (FA) sizes. The examination of membrane roughness was also confirmed with atomic force microscopy. Using reagents altering actin or microtubule cytoskeletons, we provided evidence that the dynamics of actin filaments rather than that of microtubules plays a crucial role for the regulation of membrane roughness. By changing the substrate rigidity, we further demonstrated that the cells seeded on compliant gels exhibited significantly lower membrane roughness and smaller FAs than the cells on rigid substrate. Taken together, our data suggest that the magnitude of membrane roughness is modulated by way of actin dynamics in cells responding to substrate properties.
Hereditary hearing loss (HHL) is a common genetically heterogeneous disorder, which follows Mendelian inheritance in humans. Because of this heterogeneity, the identification of the causative gene of HHL by linkage analysis or Sanger sequencing have shown economic and temporal limitations. With recent advances in next-generation sequencing (NGS) techniques, rapid identification of a causative gene via massively parallel sequencing is now possible. We recruited a Korean family with three generations exhibiting autosomal dominant inheritance of hearing loss (HL), and the clinical information about this family revealed that there are no other symptoms accompanied with HL. To identify a causative mutation of HL in this family, we performed whole-exome sequencing of 4 family members, 3 affected and an unaffected. As the result, A novel splicing mutation, c.763+1G&gt;T, in the solute carrier family 17, member 8 (SLC17A8) gene was identified in the patients, and the genotypes of the mutation were co-segregated with the phenotype of HL. Additionally, this mutation was not detected in 100 Koreans with normal hearing. Via NGS, we detected a novel splicing mutation that might influence the hearing ability within the patients with autosomal dominant non-syndromic HL. Our data suggests that this technique is a powerful tool to discover causative genetic factors of HL and facilitate diagnoses of the primary cause of HHL.
In this work, weddellite and sylvite crystals are identified for the first time on the involucral bracts and petals of Xeranthemum annuum and Xeranthemum cylindraceum using scanning electron microscopy coupled with energy dispersive spectrometric (SEM-EDS) analysis. Well-developed crystals of weddellite (CaC2O4·2H2O) occur in the form of a tetragonal bipyramid (hhl), rarely in combination of a bipyramid and tetragonal prism (h00). Indumentum of involucral bracts of X. cylindraceum consists of nonglandular and glandular trichomes. Sylvite (KCl) crystals are observed only on the petal surface of X. cylindraceum. The crystals of sylvite occur in the form of perfect cubes (hexahedrons), but some crystals are deformed, i.e., partially elongated. Taxonomic significance of investigated microcharacters as well as the use of SEM-EDS analysis in taxonomic studies of plants are discussed.
To further characterize the mechanisms underlying liver toxicity induced by arsenic, we examined in this study the effect of arsenic on thioredoxin (Trx) and the apoptotic signaling pathways in human liver HHL-5 cells. The cells were treated with 0, 2, 5, and 10 μM of sodium arsenite for 24 h, and the changes of Trx1 and thioredoxin reductase (TrxR1) as well as intracellular ROS and apoptosis were examined. A concentration-dependent increase in mRNA and protein levels of Trx1 and TrxR1 was observed in arsenic-treated cells. Intracellular ROS levels and apoptosis were also significantly increased in a concentration-dependent manner. In line with this, protein levels of Bax and cytochrome C were increased and Bcl-2 was decreased by arsenic treatments. Increases in caspase 3 activity were observed. These results indicate that Trx is involved in arsenic-induced liver cell injury, probably through the apoptotic signaling pathway. However, further studies are needed to elucidate on these findings.
The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system is a signaling pathway which responsible in the blood pressure regulation. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) is one of the key elements responsible for the hypertensive mechanism. It converts angiotensin-I to angiotensin-II. The discovery history of the ACE inhibitory activity assay method has been through a long stage for decades and development continues until today. The ACE inhibitory activity has become an effective screening method in the search for new antihypertensive agents from herbal plants. Some of in vitro assay methods were used to examine the activity of ACE inhibitors based on the substrate usage, such as; Cushman and Cheung Method using a substrate hippuryl-histidyl-leucine (HHL), Holmquist method using a substrate furanacryloyl-tripeptide, Elbl and Wagner method using a substrate benzoil-[l-14C] glicyl-L-histidine-L-leucine, Carmel and Yaron method using a substrate o-aminobenzoylglycyl-p-nitrophenylalanilproline, and Lam method using 3-hydroxybutyrylglycyl-glycyl-glycine as substrate. Several different methods to measure the results of enzymatic reactions or separating substrate with products, including spectrophotometric, fluorometric, high-performance liquid chromatography, electrophoresis, and radiochemistry. Application of the test method for screening the ACE inhibitors activity and investigation of active compounds from natural products can be done easily with this method, it is very helpful in research because the results obtained are simple, accurate, and rapid.
Hereditary hearing loss is characterized by a very high genetic heterogeneity. In the Qatari population the role of GJB2, the worldwide HHL major player, seems to be quite limited compared to Caucasian populations. In this study we analysed 18 Qatari families affected by non-syndromic hearing loss using a targeted sequencing approach that allowed us to analyse 81 genes simultaneously. Thanks to this approach, 50% of these families (9 out of 18) resulted positive for the presence of likely causative alleles in 6 different genes: CDH23, MYO6, GJB6, OTOF, TMC1 and OTOA. In particular, 4 novel alleles were detected while the remaining ones were already described to be associated to HHL in other ethnic groups. Molecular modelling has been used to further investigate the role of novel alleles identified in CDH23 and TMC1 genes demonstrating their crucial role in Ca2+ binding and therefore possible functional role in proteins. Present study showed that an accurate molecular diagnosis based on next generation sequencing technologies might largely improve molecular diagnostics outcome leading to benefits for both genetic counseling and definition of recurrence risk.
MicroRNA (miRNA) expression has been linked to the molecular pathogenesis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The aberrant expression of miRNA is involved in the processes of tumorigenesis and cancer progression. According to the latest research, miR-888-5p is associated with strong cancer-promoting effect. For instance, miR-888-5p is up-regulated in prostate cancer and breast cancer. Nevertheless, the role of miR-888-5p in HCC has not been investigated to date. In this study, we found that miR-888-5p levels in four HCC cell lines (SMMC7721, HepG2, Huh-7 and Bel7402) were significantly up-regulated compared with human hepatocyte cell line (HHL-5). After transiently transfected with miR-888-5p mimic, our results demonstrated that miR-888-5p plays a major role in promoting the proliferation and metastatic potential of HCC cells. Moreover, miR-888-5p also increased the expression of MMP-2 and MMP-9 proteins which account for cell migration and invasion, and decreased the expression of p53 protein which further promoted malignance of HCC. Therefore, miR-888-5p may be considered a potential biomarker for diagnostics and prognosis of HCC.
Hidden hearing loss (HHL) is a recently described auditory neuropathy believed to contribute to speech discrimination and intelligibility deficits in people with normal audiological tests. Animals and humans with HHL have normal auditory thresholds but defective cochlear neurotransmission, that is, reduced suprathreshold amplitude of the sound-evoked auditory nerve compound action potential. Currently, the only cellular mechanism known for HHL is loss of inner hair cell synapses (synaptopathy). Here we report that transient loss of cochlear Schwann cells results in permanent auditory deficits characteristic of HHL. This auditory neuropathy is not associated with synaptic loss, but rather with disruption of the first heminodes at the auditory nerve peripheral terminal. Thus, this study identifies a new mechanism for HHL, highlights the long-term consequences of transient Schwann cell loss on hearing and might provide insights into the causes of the auditory deficits reported in patients that recover from acute demyelinating diseases such as Guillain-Barré syndrome.
The aim of the present work was to determine whether treatment with melatonin modifies the reproductive response of female goats experiencing increasing or decreasing body weight (BW)/body condition score (BCS) when introduced to bucks displaying springtime sexual activity. During natural anoestrus, 53 does were isolated from bucks for a period of 42days and distributed into two groups: 1) low BW/low BCS animals (N=24) (LLg group), which were fed 1.9 times their maintenance requirements so they would experience increasing BW and BCS; and 2) high BW/high BCS animals (N=29) (HHl group), which were fed 0.4 times their maintenance requirements so they would experience decreasing BW and BCS. Half of each group was treated, or not, with melatonin (LLg+Mel N=12, HHl+Mel N=15, LLg-Mel N=12 and HHl-Mel N=14). On 6th May they were introduced to six males, showing natural sexual activity, fitted with marking harnesses (thus permitting the detection of oestrous activity). The ovulation rate was assessed by transrectal ultrasonography and confirmed via the plasma progesterone concentration (measured twice per week in blood samples). Plasma glucose, IGF-1 and non-esterified fatty acid concentrations were also determined, along with the conception rate, fertility, prolificacy and productivity of the does. LH concentrations and LH pulsatility were also recorded in the hours around introduction to the males. 'Oestrous plus ovulation' was observed only in does treated with melatonin. A higher conception rate and greater fertility and productivity were observed among the LLg+Mel does. These females showed higher glucose and IGF-1 concentrations after the introduction of the males. LH concentrations increased after male introduction independent of all other conditions. In conclusion, the present results show that treatment with melatonin does not enhance reproductive performance in does experiencing decreasing BW/BCS, but can improve it when does are experiencing increasing BW/body fat reserves - even when exposed to males displaying only springtime sexual activity. This might be explained by the higher blood glucose and IGF-1 concentrations of the LLg+Mel females.
Hanatoxin (HaTx), a 35-residue polypeptide from spider venom, functions as an inhibitor of Kv2.1 channels by interacting with phospholipids prior to affecting the voltage-sensor. However, how this water-soluble peptide modifies the gating remains poorly understood, as the voltage-sensor is deeply embedded within the bilayer. To determine how HaTx interacts with phospholipid bilayers, in this study, we examined the toxin-induced partitioning of liposomal membranes. HPLC-results from high-speed spin-down vesicles with HaTx demonstrated direct binding. Dynamic light scattering (DLS) and leakage assay results further indicated that neither membrane pores nor membrane fragmentations were observed in the presence of HaTx. To clarify the binding details, Langmuir trough experiments were performed with phospholipid monolayers by mimicking the external leaflet of membrane bilayers, indicating the involvement of acyl chains in such interactions between HaTx and phospholipids. Our current study thus describes the interaction pattern of HaTx with vesicle membranes, defining a membrane-partitioning mechanism for peptide insertion involving the membrane hydrocarbon core without pore formation.
Unilateral mesial temporal lobe epilepsy and hippocampal sclerosis have structural and functional abnormalities in the mesial temporal regions. To gain insight into the pathophysiology of the epileptic network in mesial temporal lobe epilepsy with hippocampal sclerosis, we aimed to clarify the relationships between hippocampal atrophy and the altered connection between the hippocampus and the posterior cingulate cortex in patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy with hippocampal sclerosis.
Fifteen patients with left mesial temporal lobe epilepsy with hippocampal sclerosis and 15 healthy controls were included in the study. Multicontrast MR imaging, including high-resolution T1WI, diffusion spectrum imaging, and resting-state fMRI, was performed to measure the hippocampal volume, structural connectivity of the inferior cingulum bundle, and intrinsic functional connectivity between the hippocampus and the posterior cingulate cortex, respectively.
Compared with controls, patients had decreased left hippocampal volume (volume ratio of the hippocampus and controls, 0.366% ± 0.029%; patients, 0.277% ± 0.063%, corrected P = .002), structural connectivity of the bilateral inferior cingulum bundle (generalized fractional anisotropy, left: controls, 0.234 ± 0.020; patients, 0.193 ± 0.022, corrected P = .0001, right: controls, 0.226 ± 0.022; patients, 0.208 ± 0.017, corrected P = .047), and intrinsic functional connectivity between the left hippocampus and the left posterior cingulate cortex (averaged z-value: controls, 0.314 ± 0.152; patients, 0.166 ± 0.062). The left hippocampal volume correlated with structural connectivity positively (standardized β = 0.864, P = .001), but it had little correlation with intrinsic functional connectivity (standardized β = -0.329, P = .113). On the contralesional side, the hippocampal volume did not show any significant correlation with structural connectivity or intrinsic functional connectivity (F2,12 = 0.284, P = .757, R2 = 0.045).
In left mesial temporal lobe epilepsy with hippocampal sclerosis, the left inferior cingulum bundle undergoes degeneration in tandem with the left hippocampal volume, whereas intrinsic functional connectivity seems to react by compensating the loss of connectivity. Such insight might be helpful in understanding the development of the epileptic network in left mesial temporal lobe epilepsy with hippocampal sclerosis.
Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) plays a central role in blood pressure regulation by producing the vasoconstrictor angiotensin II. The inhibition of ACE with natural inhibitors, as alternatives to avoid the side effect of synthetic drugs, is a major target in the prevention of hypertension. In this study, we examined the separated caseins and whey proteins of goat milk for the presence of ACE inhibitory peptides. Digestion of isolated whey proteins and caseins of goat milk by gastric pepsin generated soluble hydrolysates exhibiting significant inhibition of ACE compared to weak inhibition by undigested proteins. The hydrolysates were fractionated by size exclusion chromatography, Sephacryl S-100 column, into four fractions (F1-F4). The late-eluting fraction (F4) of either whey or caseins exhibited greater ACE inhibition. Peptides in both F4 fractions, isolated by RP-HPLC, exhibited variable ACE inhibitory activities with the hydrophobic peptide peaks being the most potent ACE inhibitors. MALDI-TOF MS/MS resulted in identification of three potent ACE inhibitory peptides: PEQSLACQCL from β-lactoglobulin (residues 113-122), QSLVYPFTGPI from β-casein (residues 56-66), and ARHPHPHLSFM from κ-casein (residues 96-106). The peptides from whey and caseins exert significant ACE inhibitory activities comparable to that of captopril, an antihypertensive drug, exhibiting IC50 values of 4.45 μM and 4.27 μM, respectively. The results introduce, for the first time, new potent ACE-inhibitory peptides that can be released by gastric pepsin of goat milk whey and caseins and thus may pave the way for their candidacy as anti-hypertensive bioactive peptides and prevention of associated disorders.
Casein hydrolysates (CH) were prepared using papain and modified by the plastein reaction (CH-P) in the presence of extrinsic phenylalanine (CH-P-Phe) or tryptophan (CH-P-Trp). The in vitro protective activity of CH and its modified products against ethanol-induced damage in HHL-5 cells was investigated. The results showed that the modification by the plastein reaction reduced the amino group content of CH. However, the modification by the plastein reaction in the presence of extrinsic amino acids could enhance the antioxidant, proliferative, cell cycle arresting, and anti-apoptosis activity of CH. Biological activities of CH and its modified products in the HHL-5 cells varied depending on the hydrolysate concentration (1, 2, and 3 mg/mL) and treatment time (24, 48, and 72 h). Generally, higher biological activities were found after cell treatment with CH or its modified products at concentration of 2 mg/mL for 48 h compared to other treatments. In addition, CH modified in the presence of tryptophan (CH-P-Trp) showed higher biological activity than that modified in the presence of phenylalanine (CH-P-Phe). Based on the obtained results, it can be concluded that casein hydrolysates with enhanced biological activity and potential health benefits can be produced by papain and the plastein reaction with the incorporation of extrinsic amino acids.
We propose a hybrid quantum algorithm based on the Harrow-Hassidim-Lloyd (HHL) algorithm for solving a system of linear equations. In this paper, we show that our hybrid algorithm can reduce a circuit depth from the original HHL algorithm by means of a classical information feed-forward after the quantum phase estimation algorithm, and the results of the hybrid algorithm are identical to those of the HHL algorithm. In addition, it is experimentally examined with four qubits in the IBM Quantum Experience setups, and the experimental results of our algorithm show higher accurate performance on specific systems of linear equations than that of the HHL algorithm.
Helping Her Live (HHL) is a community health worker-led outreach model that navigates women from vulnerable communities to mammography screening and diagnostic follow-up. The objective of this study was to evaluate HHL implementation on the southwest side of Chicago. HHL has been implemented on the west side of Chicago since 2008, where it has increased mammogram completion and diagnostic follow-up rates among Black and Hispanic women from resource poor communities. In 2014, HHL was translated to the southwest side of Chicago; implementation success was evaluated by comparing outreach, navigation request, and mammogram completion metrics with the west side. During January 2014-December 2015, outreach was less extensive in the southwest setting (SW) compared to the benchmark west setting (W); however, the proportion of women who completed mammograms in SW was 50%, which compared favorably to the proportion observed in the benchmark setting W (42%). The distribution of insurance status and the racial and ethnic makeup of individuals met on outreach in the W and SW were significantly different (p &lt; 0.0005). This successful expansion of HHL in terms of both geographic and demographic reach justifies further studies leveraging these results and tailoring HHL to additional underserved communities.
To get new anti-hepatoma agents with anti-inflammatory activity and hypotoxicity, a series of dissymmetric pyridyl-substituted 3,5-bis(arylidene)-4-piperidones (BAPs, 25-82) were designed and synthesized. Many of them exhibited potential anti-hepatoma properties against human hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines (HepG2, QGY-7703, SMMC-7721) and hypotoxicity for human normal heptical cell line (HHL-5, LO2), and prominently inhibited lipopolysaccharides (LPS) induced IL-6, TNF-α secretion to exert its anti-inflammatory effect. Combining the data of cytotoxicity, cytocompatibility and anti-inflammatory activity, 3-pyridyl and -CF3 substituted 67 may be the potential anti-hepatoma agent. 67 effectively promoted cell apoptosis through up-regulating cleaved caspase-3 and Bax expression and down-regulating Bcl-2 expression. Furthermore, 67 prominently inhibited NF-κB pathway activation by blocking the phosphorylation of IκBα, p65 and the nuclear translocation of NF-κB induced by TNF-α and LPS. In addition, 67 could reasonably bind to the active site of Bcl-2 and NF-κB/p65 protein proved by Molecular docking analyses. Moreover, 67 significantly suppressed the growth and inflammatory response of HepG2 xenografts in nude mice and was relatively nontoxic to mice. These results suggest that 67 may be effective and hypotoxicity anti-hepatoma agent for the clinical treatment of liver cancers.
To explore predictors of epilepsy presentation in unruptured brain arteriovenous malformations (bAVMs) with quantitative evaluation of location and radiomics features on T2-weighted imaging.
This retrospective study identified 117 patients with unruptured bAVMs. Cases were randomly split into training dataset (n = 90) and test dataset (n = 27). On the training dataset, we applied atlas-based analysis to identify epilepsy-susceptible brain regions of bAVMs, and then applied the radiomics technique to explore shape, intensity, and textural features that were correlated with epilepsy presentation. Informative radiomics predictors were selected by least absolute shrinkage and selection operator with 3-fold cross-validation. A linear classification score was then constructed, and we tested if we could precisely identify epilepsy-susceptible bAVMs with the location and radiomics predictors.
Two brain regions and 4 radiomics features were screened out as predictors for epilepsy. The percent of damage of the right precentral gyrus and the right superior longitudinal fasciculus was associated with epilepsy presentation. The 4 radiomics features were Original_firstorder_Median, Wavelet-LHL_firstorder_InterquartileRange, Wavelet-HHL_firstorder_InterquartileRange, and Wavelet-HHH_glrlm_RunVariance. Epileptogenic bAVMs had larger variance of run lengths, larger median value, and interquartile range of voxel intensities. On the training dataset, these 6 predictors were able to classify epilepsy-susceptible bAVMs with accuracy at 0.822, and the area under the curve was 0.866 (95% confidence interval, 0.791-0.940). On the test dataset, sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of classification reached 0.786, 0.769, and 0.778, respectively.
Epilepsy-susceptible bAVMs had distinct locations and radiomics features on T2-weighted imaging.
Lysyl oxidase-generated intermolecular cross-links are essential for the tensile strength of collagen fibrils. Two cross-linking pathways can be defined, one based on telopeptide lysine aldehydes and another on telopeptide hydroxylysine aldehydes. Since the 1970s it has been accepted that the mature cross-linking structures on the lysine aldehyde pathway, which dominates in skin and cornea, incorporate histidine residues. Here, using a range of MS-based methods, we re-examined this conclusion and found that telopeptide aldol dimerization is the primary mechanism for stable cross-link formation. The C-telopeptide aldol dimers formed labile addition products with glucosylgalactosyl hydroxylysine at α1(I)K87 in adjacent collagen molecules that resisted borohydride reduction and after acid hydrolysis produced histidinohydroxylysinonorleucine (HHL), but only from species with a histidine in their α1(I) C-telopeptide sequence. Peptide MS analyses and the lack of HHL formation in rat and mouse skin, species that lack an α1(I) C-telopeptide histidine, revealed that HHL is a laboratory artifact rather than a natural cross-linking structure. Our experimental results also establish that histidinohydroxymerodesmosine is produced by borohydride reduction of N-telopeptide allysine aldol dimers in aldimine intermolecular linkage to nonglycosylated α1(I) K930. Borohydride reduction of the aldimine promotes an accompanying base-catalyzed Michael addition of α1(I) H932 imidazole to the α,β-unsaturated aldol. These aldehydes are intramolecular at the N terminus but at the C terminus they can be both intramolecular and intermolecular according to present and earlier findings.
A method aiming at investigating possible bioactive conformations of acyl homoserine lactone (AHL) quorum sensing (QS) modulators is established. The method relies on the exhaustive conformational analysis of AHLs by varying torsion angles around the amide group then on the selection of the closest conformation to those known from co-crystallized XRD data of AHL-receptor complexes. These latter are then docked as rigid ligand within the receptor binding site, leading to interactions with binding site residues which are highly consistent as compared with the data arising from XRD studies. The method is first validated using AHLs for which XRD data of their complexes with their cognate receptor are available, then extended to examples for which the binding mode is still unknown. Three compounds were used to validate the method: hexanoyl homoserine lactone (HHL) as an example of autoinducer, 3-oxo-butanoyl homoserine lactone (OBHL), as a representative model of 3-oxo-AHLs, and 4-(4-chlorophenoxy)butanoyl homoserine lactone (CPOBHL) as an example of a QS inhibitor. The conformational analysis of these three compounds to their cognate protein (TraR, SdiA, LasR and CviR) provides the data which enable the next rigid docking step. Further rigid docking of the closest conformations compared to the known bioactive ones within the binding sites allows to recover the expected binding mode with high precision (atomic RMSD &lt; 2 Å). This "conformational analysis/torsion angle filter/rigid ligand docking" method was then used for investigating three non-natural AHL-type QS inhibitors without known co-crystallized XRD structures, namely was 2-hexenoyl homoserine lactone (HenHL), 3-oxo-4-phenylbutanoyl homoserine lactone (OPBHL) and 3-(4-bromophenyl)propanoyl homoserine lactone (BPPHL). Results provide insights into their possible binding mode by identifying specific interactions with some key residues within the receptor binding site, allowing discussion of their biological activity.
Hypertension is a becoming a major threat to the world. Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) is a key part in the renin angiotensin aldosterone system (RAAS) which control blood pressure. Over expression of RAAS is related with vascular hypertension, ACE inhibition has turned into a noteworthy target for controlling hypertension. In the search of lead molecules from plant origin as a substitute for toxic synthetic drugs, 25 Indian medicinal plants and foods were screened for their ACE inhibitory activity. IC50 (50% inhibition of ACE) values of hydroalcoholic crude extracts and fraction were determined by a colorimetric method. Active fractions were further screened to determine the enzyme kinetics, mode, specificity and mechanism of inhibition. Standardization was done by determining total phenolics and flavonoids as gallic acid and quercetin equivalents/mg of extract respectively. Among 25 crude extracts, Cynara scolymus extract showed the best activity, IC50 value 356.62 μg/mL. ACE inhibition resulting from protein precipitation was highest in Coscinium fenestratum. Lineweaver-Burk plots revealed a competitive mode of inhibition for Punica granatum ethyl acetate fraction. Fractions of Cassia occidentalis, Cynara scolymus and Embelia ribes were found to be non-specific inhibitors of ACE. Embelia ribes, Cassia occidentalis and Coscinium fenestratum fractions inhibited the ACE by Zn2+ ion chelation. Research revealed the potential of tested plants fractions as ACE inhibitors along with their inhibition kinetics and mechanism of inhibition. These active plant fractions might find importance in the development of potential antihypertensive agents after further investigations using preclinical and clinical trials.
Hereditary hearing loss (HHL) is a common disorder characterized by a huge genetic heterogeneity. The definition of a correct molecular diagnosis is essential for proper genetic counseling, recurrence risk estimation, and therapeutic options. From 20 to 40% of patients carry mutations in GJB2 gene, thus, in more than half of cases it is necessary to look for causative variants in the other genes so far identified (~100). In this light, the use of next-generation sequencing technologies has proved to be the best solution for mutational screening, even though it is not always conclusive. Here we describe a combined approach, based on targeted re-sequencing (TRS) of 96 HHL genes followed by high-density SNP arrays, aimed at the identification of the molecular causes of non-syndromic HHL (NSHL). This strategy has been applied to study 103 Italian unrelated cases, negative for mutations in GJB2, and led to the characterization of 31% of them (i.e., 37% of familial and 26.3% of sporadic cases). In particular, TRS revealed TECTA and ACTG1 genes as major players in the Italian population. Furthermore, two de novo missense variants in ACTG1 have been identified and investigated through protein modeling and molecular dynamics simulations, confirming their likely pathogenic effect. Among the selected patients analyzed by SNP arrays (negative to TRS, or with a single variant in a recessive gene) a molecular diagnosis was reached in ~36% of cases, highlighting the importance to look for large insertions/deletions. Moreover, copy number variants analysis led to the identification of the first case of uniparental disomy involving LOXHD1 gene. Overall, taking into account the contribution of GJB2, plus the results from TRS and SNP arrays, it was possible to reach a molecular diagnosis in ~51% of NSHL cases. These data proved the usefulness of a combined approach for the analysis of NSHL and for the definition of the epidemiological picture of HHL in the Italian population.
Hidden hearing loss (HHL), a recently described auditory disorder, has been proposed to affect auditory neural processing and hearing acuity in subjects with normal audiometric thresholds, particularly in noisy environments. In contrast to central auditory processing disorders, HHL is caused by defects in the cochlea, the peripheral auditory organ. Noise exposure, aging, ototoxic drugs, and peripheral neuropathies are some of the known risk factors for HHL. Our knowledge of the causes and mechanisms of HHL are based primarily on animal models. However, recent clinical studies have also shed light on the etiology and prevalence of this cochlear disorder and how it may affect auditory perception in humans. Here, we review the current knowledge regarding the causes and cellular mechanisms of HHL, summarize information on available noninvasive tests for differential diagnosis, and discuss potential therapeutic approaches for treatment of HHL.
Sulforaphane (SFN) is reported to reduce the accumulation of lipids. However, the underling mechanism remains unclear. In this study, the potential of SFN to improve lipid metabolism is investigated through altering mitochondrial function and biogenesis-related mechanisms.
The abnormal lipid metabolism model was established both in HHL-5 cells and in rats by feeding a high-fat diet (HFD) for 10 weeks. The current findings suggest that SFN alleviates the swelling of mitochondria and stimulates mitochondrial biogenesis. The reduced expression of NRF1 and TFAM, were reversed by SFN. SFN increases the levels of antioxidant compounds via nuclear factor erythroid-2-related factor (Nrf2) activation. Furthermore, SFN improves multiple mitochondrial bioactivities, such as mitochondrial membrane potential, ATP, and the electron transfer chain based on PGC-1α pathway. SFN also activates lipolysis by transcriptionally upregulating adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL) and hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL).
SFN enhances utilization of lipids via both the PGC- 1α-dependent promotion of mitochondrial biogenesis and Nrf2 dependent improvement of mitochondrial function.
BACKGROUND Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fifth most common malignancy in China, and China's annual number of new cases accounts for about 45% of the world total. This research was aimed to study the expression of TBX3 protein in HCC and exploring its clinical significance. MATERIAL AND METHODS We collected tumor tissues and adjacent non-tumoral tissues of 174 patients with HCC undergoing surgical resection. The expression of TBX3 protein in different tissues and cell lines in vitro (LO2, HHL-5, MHC97-L, MHC97-H) was detected by immunohistochemistry or Western blotting, and the relationship between TBX3 expression and clinical data of patients with HCC was analyzed. RESULTS The expression of TBX3 protein in HCC was significantly correlated with histological grade, tumor size, cancer cell metastasis, hepatitis B surface antigen, and the expression of Ki-67 in tumor tissues (P&lt;0.05), and it was positively correlated with serum AFP level (r=0.766, P&lt;0.05). The expression of TBX3 increased with increased histological grade in HCC (P&lt;0.05). Cox regression analysis showed that the expression of TBX3 protein in HCC was an independent risk factor for prognosis (OR=0.524, 95% CI=0.283-0.964). The 5-year survival rate of patients with HCC that highly expressed TBX3 protein was 20.83%, which was significantly lower than the 40.20% rate in patients with low expression (P&lt;0.05). CONCLUSIONS The expression of TBX3 in HCC patients undergoing surgical resection is high, and its expression increases with the degree of tumor differentiation. It is related to the metastasis of tumor cells and is positively correlated with the serum level of AFP and may affect the survival time of HCC patients undergoing surgical resection.
To evaluate the auditory system for hidden hearing loss (HHL) and its association with clinical variables and endothelial dysfunction (ED) in children and adolescents with sickle cell anemia (SCA).
Participants included 37 patients with stable SCA and 44 healthy controls (HC group) (aged 6-18 years) with hearing thresholds ≤ 20 dB (dB) were evaluated for pure tone audiometry, tympanometry, acoustic reflex, otoacoustic emission, and auditory evoked potentials. Laboratory analysis of the lipid profile, and C-reactive protein levels and endothelial function using ultrasonographic imaging of the brachial artery to assess flow-mediated dilation were performed.
The SCA group presented with a higher rate of increased contralateral acoustic reflex thresholds, compared to those in the HC group at all frequencies and in both ears (p &lt; 0.05). There were significant differences in the brainstem auditory evoked potentials between the SCA and HC groups. In the SCA group, the waves III and V latencies were increased (p = 0.006 and 0.004 respectively), and the I-III and I-V interpeak intervals were longer (p = 0.015 and 0.018 respectively) than those in the HC group. There was no association between the audiological measures and clinical and metabolic variables and sickle cell anemia complications including endothelial function and therapy.
In conclusion, our findings suggest that damage in the auditory system in SCA patients can be present involving retrocochlear structures, causing functional deficits without deterioration of auditory sensitivity.
The gradient relationship between mean corpuscular volume (MCV) and mortality due to ischemic vascular disease has not been researched using a large-scale population-based study. This study evaluated the association between MCV and death attributable to cerebrovascular disease (CVD) and cardiovascular disease (CAD) in a large population- and community-based Taiwanese cohort. A longitudinal study with a 9-year follow-up was conducted to evaluate individuals aged 20 years or older who had participated in the Keelung (the northernmost city in Taiwan) community-based integrated screening (abbreviated as KCIS) program since September 1999. The mortality rates associated with CVD and CAD were classified across a range of different MCV levels. Increased MCV levels were associated with an increased risk of CVD/CAD-related death (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] = 1.42, trend test P = 0.0119). Marginally statistically significant associations were noted for specific deaths from ischemic heart disease (aHR = 1.44, trend test P = 0.0992) and cerebral ischemic stroke (aHR = 1.66, trend test P = 0.0667), respectively, but no significant gradient relationship was noted for death from cerebral hemorrhage stroke (aHR = 1.23, trend test, P = 0.6278). A gradient relationship between baseline MCV level and CVD/CAD-related death was noted, but whether such gradient relationships existed for two specific deaths and how these relationships may be confounded by extraneous factors that were not considered here should be investigated in the future.
Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) biosensor has been utilized for monitoring analyte-ligand interactions in modern drug discovery processes. SPR biosensors measure the change in refractive indexes over the course of analyte molecules' binding to a specific immobilized ligand on sensor chip. This effort highlights a comprehensive SPR study besides enzymatic assay for discovery of new Angiotensin Converting Enzyme (ACE) inhibitors via screening of medicinal plants. At first, five medicinal plants were selected as potential sources for developing new ACE inhibitors through hydrolyzing hippuryl-L-histidyl-L-leucine (HHL) assay. The interaction of selected extracts with immobilized ACE on the sensor chip (500D) confirmed that the Onopordum acanthium L. had the greatest ACE inhibition activity among the set of compounds and its active compound (onopordia) was isolated. SPR biosensor used to evaluate binding affinity of onopordia and ACE. Equilibrium constant (KD), and changes in Gibb's free energy of the binding (ΔGbinding) values for the interaction of onopordia with ACE were found to be 10.24 μM and -28.48 kJ/mol, respectively. Computational analysis supported the binding of onopordia to the ACE active site. Kinetic and thermodynamic parameters of binding revealed that onopordia is an acceptable ACE inhibitor and could treat hypertension. SPR biosensor can be used to improve the drug discovery process for many important classes of drug targets due to its great sensitivity.
Hereditary hearing loss (HHL) is an extremely heterogeneous disorder with autosomal dominant, recessive, and X-linked forms. Here, we described an Italian pedigree affected by HHL but also prostate hyperplasia and increased ratio of the free/total PSA levels, with the unusual and extremely rare Y-linked pattern of inheritance. Using exome sequencing we found a missense variant (r.206A&gt;T leading to p.Asp69Val) in the TBL1Y gene. TBL1Y is homologous of TBL1X, whose partial deletion has described to be involved in X-linked hearing loss. Here, we demonstrate that it has a restricted expression in adult human cochlea and prostate and the variant identified induces a lower protein stability caused by misfolded mutated protein that impairs its cellular function. These findings indicate that TBL1Y could be considered a novel candidate for HHL.
IGF-I as a human growth factor produced in Escherichia coli is a single, non-glycosylated, polypeptide chain containing 70 amino acids and having a molecular mass of 7.6 kDa. Up to now, E. coli expression system has been widely used as the host to produce rhIGF-1 with high yields. Acyl Homoserine Lactones (AHLs) are intercellular signaling molecules used in quorum sensing by Gram-negative bacteria. Quorum sensing is a cell density-dependent gene regulation process that allows bacterial cells to express specific genes only when signaling molecules reach the sufficient concentration.
For the first time, this study focuses on the N-hexanoyl-L- Homoserine Lactone (HHL) activity on increasing the cell growth and rh-IGF-1concentration in batch culture of E. coli.
The maximum production of rhIGF-I was previously optimized in 32y culture medium at 32°C with 0.05 mM IPTG as inducer and 10 g/l glucose concentration. Under this condition, different amounts of HHL (0.001 µg/ml, 1 µg/ml, and 100µg/ml) were evaluated as an inducer for IGF-1 production.
Generally, with increasing of HHL concentration, an increase in dry cell weight (2.45 mg/ml to 4.63 mg/ml) and IGF-I expression level (0.4 mg/ml to 0.77 mg/ml) was observed.
HHL or other types of AHLs can be considered as protein production inducer in bacterial expression systems through the quorum sensing pathways.
Exposure to even a single episode of loud noise can damage synapses between cochlear hair cells and auditory nerve fibres, causing hidden hearing loss (HHL) that is not detected by audiometry. Here we investigate the effects of noise-induced HHL on functional hearing by measuring the ability of neurons in the auditory midbrain of mice to adapt to sound environments containing quiet and loud periods. Neurons from noise-exposed mice show less capacity for adaptation to loud environments, convey less information about sound intensity in those environments, and adaptation to the longer-term statistical structure of fluctuating sound environments is impaired. Adaptation comprises a cascade of both threshold and gain adaptation. Although noise exposure only impairs threshold adaptation directly, the preserved function of gain adaptation surprisingly aggravates coding deficits for loud environments. These deficits might help to understand why many individuals with seemingly normal hearing struggle to follow a conversation in background noise.
The increasing occurrence of resistance among Pseudomonas aeruginosa clinical isolates necessitates finding alternatives to antibiotics for controlling the infection of such pathogenic bacteria. In this study, lactonase gene ahl-1 from Bacillus weihenstephanensis isolate-P65 was successfully cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) under the control of T7 promoter for utilizing its quorum quenching activity against three multidrug-resistant (MDR) P. aeruginosa clinical isolates. The biological activity of the overexpressed lactonase enzyme (Ahl-1), tested using a synthetic signal and Chromobacterium violaceum CV026 as a biosensor, displayed good catalytic activity using hexanoyl homoserine lactone (HHL) as a substrate and Chromobacterium violaceum (CV026) as a biosensor (77.2 and 133 nm min-1 for the crude and the purified Ahl-lactonase enzymes, respectively). Upon challenging its ability to inhibit the virulence of three MDR P. aeruginosa clinical isolates, recombinant Ahl-1 successfully prevented the accumulation of acylhomoserine lactone signals resulting in a significant reduction in the investigated virulence determinants; protease (from 40 up to 75.5%), pyocyanin (48-75.9%), and rhamnolipids (52.7-63.4%) (P value &lt; 0.05). Ahl-1 also displayed significant inhibitory activities on the swarming motility and biofilm formation of the three tested MDR P. aeruginosa clinical isolates (P value &lt; 0.05). Consequently, Ahl-1 lactonase enzyme in this study is considered a promising therapeutic agent to inhibit P. aeruginosa pathogenicity with no fear of emergence of resistance.
Human hepatic lipase (hHL) is a cell surface associated enzyme that hydrolyzes triacylglycerols and phospholipids within circulating lipoproteins. We hypothesized that an amino acid sequence mimicking the major heparin binding domain (HBD) of hHL will displace hHL from cell surfaces. To test this hypothesis, we generated a recombinant protein of thioredoxin linked with a cleavable, tagged sequence containing amino acids 442 to 476 of the mature hHL sequence, which contains the major HBD of hHL. The recombinant protein associated with heparin-sepharose, and its peak elution from heparin-sepharose occurred in the presence of 0.5 M NaCl. We cleaved and purified the tagged sequence containing the HBD from the recombinant protein and tested the ability of the peptide to displace full-length hHL from HEK-293 cells. The peptide indeed displaced hHL from cell surfaces, while no significant displacement was observed in the presence of a peptide with a scrambled sequence. Finally, we obtained structural information for the peptide containing the HBD. 1 H- and 15 N-NMR spectra of the peptide indicate the peptide is largely unstructured, although not completely random coil. The addition of heparin to the peptide induced some changes in chemical shift, suggesting changes in peptide structure and/or specific interactions with heparin. Molecular simulations confirm the largely unstructured nature of the isolated peptide, but they also indicate weak tendencies for both α- and β-structure formation in different parts of the chain. Overall, these data provide a proof-of-principle for the use of mimetic peptides for the displacement of cell surface associated lipases.
Hereditary hearing loss (HHL) and age-related hearing loss (ARHL) are two major sensory diseases affecting millions of people worldwide. Despite many efforts, additional HHL-genes and ARHL genetic risk factors still need to be identified. To fill this gap a large genomic screening based on next-generation sequencing technologies was performed. Whole exome sequencing in a 3-generation Italian HHL family and targeted re-sequencing in 464 ARHL patients were performed. We detected three variants in SPATC1L: a nonsense allele in an HHL family and a frameshift insertion and a missense variation in two unrelated ARHL patients. In silico molecular modelling of all variants suggested a significant impact on the structural stability of the protein itself, likely leading to deleterious effects and resulting in truncated isoforms. After demonstrating Spatc1l expression in mice inner ear, in vitro functional experiments were performed confirming the results of the molecular modelling studies. Finally, a candidate-gene population-based statistical study in cohorts from Caucasus and Central Asia revealed a statistically significant association of SPATC1L with normal hearing function at low and medium hearing frequencies. Overall, the amount of different genetic data presented here (variants with early-onset and late-onset hearing loss in addition to genetic association with normal hearing function), together with relevant functional evidence, likely suggest a role of SPATC1L in hearing function and loss.
Cochlear synaptopathy produced by exposure to noise levels that cause only transient auditory threshold elevations is a condition that affects many people and is believed to contribute to poor speech discrimination in noisy environments. These functional deficits in hearing, without changes in sensitivity, have been called hidden hearing loss (HHL). It has been proposed that activity of the medial olivocochlear (MOC) system can ameliorate acoustic trauma effects. Here we explore the role of the MOC system in HHL by comparing the performance of two different mouse models: an α9 nicotinic receptor subunit knock-out (KO; Chrna9 KO), which lacks cholinergic transmission between efferent neurons and hair cells; and a gain-of-function knock-in (KI; Chrna9L9'T KI) carrying an α9 point mutation that leads to enhanced cholinergic activity. Animals of either sex were exposed to sound pressure levels that in wild-type produced transient cochlear threshold shifts and a decrease in neural response amplitudes, together with the loss of ribbon synapses, which is indicative of cochlear synaptopathy. Moreover, a reduction in the number of efferent contacts to outer hair cells was observed. In Chrna9 KO ears, noise exposure produced permanent auditory threshold elevations together with cochlear synaptopathy. In contrast, the Chrna9L9'T KI was completely resistant to the same acoustic exposure protocol. These results show a positive correlation between the degree of HHL prevention and the level of cholinergic activity. Notably, enhancement of the MOC feedback promoted new afferent synapse formation, suggesting that it can trigger cellular and molecular mechanisms to protect and/or repair the inner ear sensory epithelium.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Noise overexposure is a major cause of a variety of perceptual disabilities, including speech-in-noise difficulties, tinnitus, and hyperacusis. Here we show that exposure to noise levels that do not cause permanent threshold elevations or hair cell death can produce a loss of cochlear nerve synapses to inner hair cells as well as degeneration of medial olivocochlear (MOC) terminals contacting the outer hair cells. Enhancement of the MOC reflex can prevent both types of neuropathy, highlighting the potential use of drugs that increase α9α10 nicotinic cholinergic receptor activity as a pharmacotherapeutic strategy to avoid hidden hearing loss.
Young musicians may be at risk for developing cochlear synaptopathy (CS), or hidden hearing loss (HHL), that could lead to permanent music-induced hearing loss (MIHL). Patients with CS often complain of tinnitus and/or difficulty understanding speech in noisy situations, even though traditional audiometric testing indicates normal hearing. The aim of this article was to determine the effects of including information about HHL on an Adopt-A-Band program involving college band members' concern about and self-efficacy toward the prevention of MIHL. We conducted a single-blinded, randomized clinical trial. Forty-eight band members participated in this study. Band members were randomly assigned to two Adopt-A-Band presentations, one with and one without information on HHL. Including information about HHL had no effect on these band members' concerns about and self-efficacy toward the prevention of MIHL. However, the Adopt-A-Band program resulted in significantly increased concern for MIHL by 39.5% ( p  &lt; 0.0001, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 25-54.2), self-efficacy in its prevention by 79.1% ( p  &lt; 0.0001, 95% CI: 66.9-91.2), and plans to use musicians' earplugs while playing by 67.4% ( p  &lt; 0.0001, 95% CI: 53.4-81.45). Although inclusion of information about HHL did not have a significant effect, the Adopt-A-Band program, in general, significantly increased the immediate intent of these students to practice healthy hearing behaviors. Future research is needed to determine the long-term effects of using the Adopt-A-Band program with university marching bands' use of healthy hearing behaviors.
Standard audiometric evaluations are not sensitive enough to identify hidden hearing loss (HHL) and/or cochlear synaptopathy (CS). Patients with either of these conditions frequently present with difficulty understanding speech in noise or other complaints such as tinnitus. The purpose of this systematic review is to identify articles in peer-reviewed journals that assessed the sensitivity of audiologic measures for detecting HHL and/or CS, and which showed potential for use in a clinical test battery for these disorders. A reference librarian submitted specific boolean terminology to MEDLINE, Embase, and Web of Science. The authors used a consensus approach with specially designed score sheets for the selection of titles, abstracts, and then articles for inclusion in the systematic review and for quality assessment. Fifteen articles were included in the systematic review. Seven articles involved humans; seven involved animals, and one study used both humans and animals. Results showed that pure-tone audiometry to 20 kHz, otoacoustic emissions, electrocochleography, auditory brainstem response (ABR), electrophysiological tests, speech recognition in noise with and without temporal distortion, interviews, and self-report measures have been used to assess HHL and/or CS. For HHL, ultra-high-frequency audiometry may help identify persons with sensory hair cell loss that does not show up on standard audiograms. Promising nonbehavioral measures for CS included ABR wave I amplitude, the summating potential-to-action potential ratio, and speech recognition in noise with and without temporal distortion. Self-report questionnaires also may help identify auditory dysfunction in persons with normal hearing.
Recent animal studies have shown that the synapses between inner hair cells and the dendrites of the spiral ganglion cells they innervate are the elements in the cochlea most vulnerable to excessive noise exposure. Particularly in rodents, several studies have concluded that exposure to high level octave-band noise for 2 h leads to an irreversible loss of around 50% of synaptic ribbons, leaving audiometric hearing thresholds unaltered. Cochlear synaptopathy following noise exposure is hypothesized to degrade the neural encoding of sounds at the subcortical level, which would help explain certain listening-in-noise difficulties reported by some subjects with otherwise 'normal' hearing. In response to this peripheral damage, increased gain of central stages of the auditory system has been observed across several species of mammals, particularly in association with tinnitus. The auditory brainstem response (ABR) wave I amplitude and waves I-V amplitude ratio have been suggested as non-invasive indicators of cochlear synaptopathy and central gain activation respectively, but the evidence for these hearing disorders in humans is inconclusive. In this study, we evaluated the influence of lifetime noise exposure (LNE) on the human ABR and on speech-in-noise intelligibility performance in a large cohort of adults aged 29 to 55. Despite large inter-subject variability, results showed a moderate, but statistically significant, negative correlation between the ABR wave I amplitude and LNE, consistent with cochlear synaptopathy. The results also showed (a) that central gain mechanisms observed in animal studies might also occur in humans, in which higher stages of the auditory pathway appear to compensate for reduced input from the cochlea; (b) that tinnitus was associated with activation of central gain mechanisms; (c) that relevant cognitive and subcortical factors influence speech-in-noise intelligibility, in particular, longer ABR waves I-V interpeak latencies were associated with poorer performance in understanding speech in noise when central gain mechanisms were active; and (d) absence of a significant relationship between LNE and tinnitus, central gain activation or speech-in-noise performance. Although this study supports the possible existence of cochlear synaptopathy in humans, the great degree of variability, the lack of uniformity in central gain activation and the significant involvement of attention in speech-in-noise performance suggests that noise-induced cochlear synaptopathy is, at most, one of several factors that play a role in humans' speech-in-noise performance.
Hypertension is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Although genetic studies have suggested that several genetic variants increase the risk for hypertension, the genes that underlie genetic susceptibility to this condition remain to be identified definitively. The purpose of the present study was to identify genetic variants that confer susceptibility to hypertension in Japanese individuals.
A total of 5,734 Japanese individuals from two independent populations were examined: subject panel A comprised 2,066 hypertensive individuals and 824 controls; and subject panel B comprised 834 hypertensive individuals and 2,010 controls. The 150 polymorphisms examined in the present study were selected by genome-wide association studies of myocardial infarction and ischemic stroke with the use of the GeneChip Human Mapping 500K Array Set (Affymetrix).
The chi(2)-test revealed that 10 polymorphisms were significantly (P &lt; 0.05) related to the prevalence of hypertension in subject panel A. To validate the relations, these polymorphisms were examined in subject panel B. The A--&gt;G polymorphism (rs645106) of SDK1 and the C--&gt;G polymorphism (rs12078839) of RABGAP1L were significantly associated with hypertension in subject panel B. Multivariable logistic regression analysis with adjustment for covariates, as well as a stepwise forward selection procedure revealed that the A--&gt;G polymorphism of SDK1 was significantly associated with hypertension in both subject panels A and B, with the G allele protecting against this condition.
SDK1 may be a susceptibility gene for hypertension in Japanese individuals, although the functional relevance of the identified polymorphism was not determined.
In this study, we report the molecular cytogenetic characterization of an acute myeloid leukemia with a der(Y)t(Y;1)(q12;q25) in bone marrow cells in a child with Klinefelter syndrome. Conventional cytogenetics demonstrated the unbalanced translocation, i.e., a trisomic 1q25-qter juxtaposed to Yq12 replaced the terminal segment of chromosome Y was acquired and present only on bone marrow cells. Fluorescence in situ hybridization showed that the breakpoint at 1q25 disrupted RABGAP1L, a strongly expressed gene in CFU-GEMM, erythroid cells, and megakaryocytes, while the Yq12 breakpoint fell within the heterochromatic region. As der(Y)t(Y;1)(q12;q25) was an isolated cytogenetic change, RABGAP1L rearrangement as well as gene(s) dosage effects correlated to 1q25-qter trisomy, and Yq12-qter loss may make a major contribution to leukemogenesis and/or disease progression.
The human mixed lineage leukemia (MLL) gene is frequently involved in genetic rearrangements with more than 55 different translocation partner genes, all associated with acute leukemia. Reciprocal chromosomal translocations generate two MLL fusion alleles, where 5'- and 3'-portions of MLL are fused to gene segments of given fusion partners. In case of t(4;11) patients, about 80% of all patients exhibit both reciprocal fusion alleles, MLL.AF4 and AF4.MLL, respectively. By contrast, 20% of all t(4;11) patients seem to encode only the MLL.AF4 fusion allele. Here, we analyzed these 'MLL.AF4(+)/AF4.MLL(-)' patients at the genomic DNA level to unravel their genetic situation. Cryptic translocations and three-way translocations were found in this group of t(4;11) patients. Reciprocal MLL fusions with novel translocation partner genes, for example NF-KB1 and RABGAP1L, were identified and actively transcribed in leukemic cells. In other patients, the reciprocal 3'-MLL gene segment was fused out-of-frame to PBX1, ELF2, DSCAML1 and FXYD6. The latter rearrangements caused haploinsufficiency of genes that are normally expressed in hematopoietic cells. Finally, patients were identified that encode only solitary 3'-MLL gene segments on the reciprocal allele. Based on these data, we propose that all t(4;11) patients exhibit reciprocal MLL alleles, but due to the individual recombination events, provide different pathological disease mechanisms.
Using an expression gene trapping strategy, we have identified and characterized two novel hematopoietic genes, Hzf and Hhl. Embryonic stem (ES) cells containing a gene trap vector insertion were cultured on OP9 stromal cells to induce hematopoietic differentiation and screened for lacZ reporter gene expression. Two ES clones displaying lacZ expression within hematopoietic cells in vitro were used to generate mice containing the gene trap integrations. Paralleling this in vitro expression pattern, both Hzf and Hhl were expressed in a tissue-specific manner during hematopoietic development in vivo. Hzf encodes a novel protein containing three C(2)H(2)-type zinc fingers predominantly expressed in megakaryocytes and CFU-GEMM. Hhl encodes a novel protein containing a putative phosphotyrosine binding (PTB) domain expressed in megakaryocytes, CFU-GEMM and BFU-E. These results demonstrate the utility of expression trapping to identify novel hematopoietic genes. Future studies of Hzf and Hhl should provide valuable information on the role these genes play during megakaryocytopoiesis.
Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a genetic disorder where affected individuals develop benign or malignant nervous system tumors. To date, NF1 is caused by mutations in the NF1 tumor suppressor gene located at chromosome band 17q11.2. In this study, we aimed to characterize novel recurrent regional chromosomal imbalances and tumor-related candidate genes in NF1-associated cutaneous neurofibromas. Nine cutaneous neurofibromas from NF1 patients were screened for recurrent chromosomal imbalances using high-resolution 400K oligonucleotide array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH). All the cases exhibited at least one sub-microscopic abnormality. Regions of recurrent chromosomal imbalances in a least one third of cases were loss of 1q13.2 (33%, FAM19A3), 1q21.1 (44%, RABGAP1L), 2q37.1 (56%, INPP5D), 3p25.1 (67%, CHCHD4), 4p15.32 (56%, FGFBP1), 5q11.2 (56%, ARL15), 6q22.31 (56%, NKAIN2), 6q22.33 (67%, ARHGAP18), 6q25.1 (67%, UST), 7q13 (56%, ADCY1), 12q13.13 (44%, KRT71), 19q13.32 (56%, GRLF1), and 20p11.21 (56%, NLP) and gain of 2p23.3 (76%, C2orf53), 8q22.3 (44%, ODF1) and 8q24.3 (67%, ARC). Several chromosomal imbalances, including loss of 7q11.23, 13q14.1, 14q32.13, 17p12, and 17q11.2 were detected at a lower frequency. We also confirmed that these chromosomal imbalances were not detected in the patient-matched lymphocyte DNAs. Amongst the 6 tumor-related candidate genes (RABGAP1L, ADCY1, SLIT2, GRLF1, UST, and ARC) identified in the regions of recurrent chromosomal imbalances, the gene expression changes of UST (down-regulation) and ARC (up-regulation) were found to be significantly associated with copy number alterations. The novel recurrent chromosomal imbalances and the altered expression levels of the tumor-related candidate genes may be associated with the development of NF1-associated benign cutaneous neurofibromas.
Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) is a subtype of primary liver cancer that is rarely curable by surgery and is rapidly increasing in incidence. Relapsed ICC has a poor prognosis, and current systemic nontargeted therapies are commonly extrapolated from those used in other gastrointestinal malignancies. We hypothesized that genomic profiling of clinical ICC samples would identify genomic alterations that are linked to targeted therapies and that could facilitate a personalized approach to therapy.
DNA sequencing of hybridization-captured libraries was performed for 3,320 exons of 182 cancer-related genes and 36 introns of 14 genes frequently rearranged in cancer. Sample DNA was isolated from 40 μm of 28 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded ICC specimens and sequenced to high coverage.
The most commonly observed alterations were within ARID1A (36%), IDH1/2 (36%), and TP53 (36%) as well as amplification of MCL1 (21%). Twenty cases (71%) harbored at least one potentially actionable alteration, including FGFR2 (14%), KRAS (11%), PTEN (11%), CDKN2A (7%), CDK6 (7%), ERBB3 (7%), MET (7%), NRAS (7%), BRCA1 (4%), BRCA2 (4%), NF1 (4%), PIK3CA (4%), PTCH1 (4%), and TSC1 (4%). Four (14%) of the ICC cases featured novel gene fusions involving the tyrosine kinases FGFR2 and NTRK1 (FGFR2-KIAA1598, FGFR2-BICC1, FGFR2-TACC3, and RABGAP1L-NTRK1).
Two thirds of patients in this study harbored genomic alterations that are associated with targeted therapies and that have the potential to personalize therapy selection for to individual patients.
Several copy number variations (CNVs) have been found to be associated with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) through the target gene approach. However, genome-wide features of CNVs and their role in the risk of SLE remain unknown. The aim of this study was to identify SLE-associated CNVs in Korean women.
Genome-wide assessments of CNVs were performed in 382 SLE patients and 191 control subjects, using an Illumina HumanHap610 BeadChip genotyping platform. SLE-associated CNV regions that were identified by genome-wide association study (GWAS) were replicated in quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and deletion-typing PCR analyses in an independent sample set comprising 564 SLE patients and 511 control subjects.
Of 144 common CNV regions, 3 deletion-type CNV regions in 1q25.1, 8q23.3, and 10q21.3 were found to be significantly associated with SLE by GWAS analysis. In the independent replication, the CNV regions in 1q25.1 (RABGAP1L) and 10q21.3 were successfully replicated (odds ratio [OR] 1.30, P=0.038 and OR 1.90, P=3.6×10(-5), respectively), and the associations were confirmed again by deletion-typing PCR. The CNV region in the C4 gene, which showed a potential association in the discovery stage, was included in the replication analysis and was found to be significantly associated with the risk of SLE (OR 1.88, P=0.01). Through deletion-typing PCR, the exact sizes and breakpoint sequences of the deletions were defined. Individuals with the deletions in all 3 loci (RABGAP1L, 10q21.3, and C4) had a much higher risk of SLE than did those without any deletions in the 3 loci (OR 5.52, P=3.9×10(-4)).
These CNV regions can be useful to identify the pathogenic mechanisms of SLE, and might be used to more accurately predict the risk of SLE by taking into consideration their synergistic effects on disease susceptibility.
The tumor microenvironment is critical to cancer growth and therapy resistance. We previously characterized human ovarian carcinoma-associated mesenchymal stem cells (CA-MSCs). CA-MSCs are multi-potent cells that can differentiate into tumor microenvironment components including fibroblasts, myofibroblasts and adipocytes. We previously reported CA-MSCs, compared to normal MSCs, express high levels of BMP proteins and promote tumor growth by increasing numbers of cancer stem-like cells (CSCs). We demonstrate here that ovarian tumor cell-secreted Hedgehog (HH) induces CA-MSC BMP4 expression. CA-MSC-derived BMP4 reciprocally increases ovarian tumor cell HH expression indicating a positive feedback loop. Interruption of this loop with a HH pathway inhibitor or BMP4 blocking antibody decreases CA-MSC-derived BMP4 and tumor-derived HH preventing enrichment of CSCs and reversing chemotherapy resistance. The impact of HH inhibition was only seen in CA-MSC-containing tumors, indicating the importance of a humanized stroma. These results are reciprocal to findings in pancreatic and bladder cancer, suggesting HH signaling effects are tumor tissue specific warranting careful investigation in each tumor type. Collectively, we define a critical positive feedback loop between CA-MSC-derived BMP4 and ovarian tumor cell-secreted HH and present evidence for the further investigation of HH as a clinical target in ovarian cancer. 
Huntington's disease (HD) represents an important model for neurodegenerative disorders and proteinopathies. It is mainly caused by cytotoxicity of the mutant huntingtin protein (Htt) with an expanded polyQ stretch. While Htt is ubiquitously expressed, HD is characterized by selective neurodegeneration of the striatum. Here we report a striatal-enriched orphan G protein-coupled receptor(GPCR) Gpr52 as a stabilizer of Htt in vitro and in vivo. Gpr52 modulates Htt via cAMP-dependent but PKA independent mechanisms. Gpr52 is located within an intron of Rabgap1l, which exhibits epistatic effects on Gpr52-mediated modulation of Htt levels by inhibiting its substrate Rab39B, which co-localizes with Htt and translocates Htt to the endoplasmic reticulum. Finally, reducing Gpr52 suppresses HD phenotypes in both patient iPS-derived neurons and in vivo Drosophila HD models. Thus, our discovery reveals modulation of Htt levels by a striatal-enriched GPCR via its GPCR function, providing insights into the selective neurodegeneration and potential treatment strategies. 
Developmental information aids stem cell biologists in producing tissue-specific cells. Recapitulation of the developmental profile of a specific cell type in an in vitro stem cell system provides a strategy for manipulating cell-fate choice during the differentiation process. Nurr1 and Foxa2 are potential candidates for genetic engineering to generate midbrain-type dopamine (DA) neurons for experimental and therapeutic applications in Parkinson's disease (PD), as forced expression of these genes in neural stem/precursor cells (NPCs) yields cells with a complete battery of midbrain DA neuron-specific genes. However, simple overexpression without considering their expression pattern in the developing midbrain tends to generate DA cells without adequate neuronal maturation and long-term maintenance of their phenotype in vitro and in vivo after transplantation. We here show that the physiological levels and timing of Nurr1 and Foxa2 expression can be replicated in NPCs by choosing the right vectors and promoters. Controlled expression combined with a strategy for transgene expression maintenance induced generation of fully mature midbrain-type DA neurons. These findings demonstrate the feasibility of cellular engineering for artificial cell-fate specification.
The gain-of-function mucin 5B (MUC5B) promoter variant, rs35705950, confers the largest risk, genetic or otherwise, for the development of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis; however, the mechanisms underlying the regulation of MUC5B expression have yet to be elucidated. Here, we identify a critical regulatory domain that contains the MUC5B promoter variant and has a highly conserved forkhead box protein A2 (FOXA2) binding motif. This region is differentially methylated in association with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, MUC5B expression, and rs35705950. In addition, we show that this locus binds FOXA2 dynamically, and that binding of FOXA2 is necessary for enhanced expression of MUC5B. In aggregate, our findings identify novel targets to regulate the expression of MUC5B.
Carbamoyl phosphate synthase 1 (CPS1) is the rate-limiting enzyme in the first step of the urea cycle and an indispensable enzyme in the metabolism of human liver. However, CPS1 epigenetic regulation involves promoter analysis and the role of liver-enriched transcription factors (LETFs), which is not fully elucidated. In this work, the promoter region of hCPS1 gene was cloned, and its activity was investigated. An LETF, hepatocyte nuclear factor 3-beta (HNF3β), was found to promote the transcriptional expression of CPS1 in liver-derived cell lines. In addition, dual-luciferase reporter assay shows that the essential binding sites of the HNF3β may exist in the oligonucleotide -70 nt to +73 nt. Two putative binding sites are available for HNF3β. Mutation analysis results show that the binding site 2 of HNF3β was effective, and the transcriptional activity of CPS1 promoter significantly decreased after mutation. Electrophoretic mobile shift assay (EMSA) and ChIP assay confirmed that HNF3β can interact with the binding site in the CPS1 promoter region of -70 nt to +73 nt promoter region in vivo and in vitro to regulate the transcription of CPS1. Moreover, HNF3β overexpression enhanced the transcription of CPS1 and consequently improved the mRNA and protein levels of CPS1, whereas the knockdown of HNF3β showed the opposite effects. Finally, urea production in cells was measured, and ammonia detoxification improved significantly in cells after transfection with HNF3β. HNF3β plays a vital role in regulation of CPS1 gene and could promote the metabolism of ammonia by regulating CPS1 expression.
So far, the understanding of germ cell cancer (GCC) pathogenesis is based on a model, where seminomas and non-seminomas represent distinct entities although originating from a common precursor termed germ cell neoplasia in situ (GCNIS). Embryonal carcinomas (ECs), the stem cell population of the non-seminomas, is pluri- to totipotent and able to differentiate into cells of all three germ layers, giving rise to teratomas or tumours mimicking extraembryonic tissues (yolk sac tumours, choriocarcinomas). With regard to gene expression, (epi)genetics and histology, seminomas are highly similar to GCNIS and primordial germ cells, but limited in development. It remains elusive, whether this block in differentiation is controlled by cell intrinsic mechanisms or by signals from the surrounding microenvironment. Here, we reviewed the recent literature emphasizing the plasticity of GCCs, especially of seminomas. We propose that this plasticity is controlled by the microenvironment, allowing seminomas to transit into an EC or mixed non-seminoma and vice versa. We discuss several mechanisms and routes of reprogramming that might be responsible for this change in the cell fate. We finally integrate this plasticity into a new model of GCC pathogenesis, allowing for an alternative view on the dynamics of GCC development and progression.
The recent identification of progenitor populations that contribute to the developing heart in a distinct spatial and temporal manner has fundamentally improved our understanding of cardiac development. However, the mechanisms that direct atrial versus ventricular specification remain largely unknown. Here we report the identification of a progenitor population that gives rise primarily to cardiovascular cells of the ventricles and only to few atrial cells (&lt;5%) of the differentiated heart. These progenitors are specified during gastrulation, when they transiently express Foxa2, a gene not previously implicated in cardiac development. Importantly, Foxa2+ cells contribute to previously identified progenitor populations in a defined pattern and ratio. Lastly, we describe an analogous Foxa2+ population during differentiation of embryonic stem cells. Together, these findings provide insight into the developmental origin of ventricular and atrial cells, and may lead to the establishment of new strategies for generating chamber-specific cell types from pluripotent stem cells.
Foxa2, known as one of the pioneer factors, plays a crucial role in islet development and endocrine functions. Its expression and biological functions are regulated by various factors, including, in particular, insulin and glucagon. However, its expression and biological role in adult pancreatic α-cells remain elusive. In the current study, we showed that Foxa2 was overexpressed in islets from α-cell-specific Men1 mutant mice, at both the transcriptional level and the protein level. More importantly, immunostaining analyses showed its prominent nuclear accumulation, specifically in α-cells, at a very early stage after Men1 disruption. Similar nuclear FOXA2 expression was also detected in a substantial proportion (12/19) of human multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1) glucagonomas. Interestingly, our data revealed an interaction between Foxa2 and menin encoded by the Men1 gene. Furthermore, using several approaches, we demonstrated the relevance of this interaction in the regulation of two tested Foxa2 target genes, including the autoregulation of the Foxa2 promoter by Foxa2 itself. The current study establishes menin, a novel protein partner of Foxa2, as a regulator of Foxa2, the biological functions of which extend beyond the pancreatic endocrine cells.

Lipoprotein lipase (LPL) plays a major role in the hydrolysis of triglycerides (TG) from circulating TG-rich lipoproteins. The role of LPL in the liver has been controversial but recent studies in mice with liver LPL overexpression or deficiency have revealed important new roles of the enzyme in glucose and lipid metabolism. The objective of this study was to identify regulatory elements and factors that control the transcription of the human LPL gene in hepatocytes. Deletion analysis of the human LPL promoter revealed that the proximal region which harbors a binding site for the forkhead box transcription factor FOXA2/HNF-3β at position -47/-40 is important for its hepatic cell activity. Silencing of FOXA2 in HepG2 cells reduced the LPL mRNA and protein levels. Direct binding of FOXA2 to the novel binding site was established in vitro and ex vivo. Mutagenesis of the FOXA2 site reduced the basal activity and abolished the FOXA2-mediated transactivation of the LPL promoter. Ιnsulin decreased LPL mRNA levels in HepG2 cells and this was associated with phosphorylation of AKT and nuclear export of FOXA2. In summary, the data of the present study combined with previous findings on the role of FOXA2 in HDL metabolism and gluconeogenesis, suggest that FOXA2 is a key regulator of lipid and glucose homeostasis in the adult liver. Understanding the mechanisms by which FOXA2 exerts its functions in hepatocytes may open the way to novel therapeutic strategies for patients with metabolic diseases such as dyslipidemia, diabetes and the metabolic syndrome.
The functional unit of the thyroid gland, the thyroid follicle, dynamically responds to various stimuli to maintain thyroid hormone homeostasis. However, thyroid follicles in the adult human thyroid gland have a very limited regenerative capacity following partial resection of the thyroid gland. To gain insight into follicle regeneration in the adult thyroid gland, we observed the regeneration processes of murine thyroid follicles after partial resection of the lower third of the thyroid gland in 10-week-old male C57BL/6 mice. Based on sequential observation of the partially resected thyroid lobe, we found primitive follicles forming in the area corresponding to the central zone of the intact lateral thyroid lobe. The primitive thyroid follicles were multiciliated and had coarsely vacuolated cytoplasm and large vesicular nuclei. Consistently, these primitive follicular cells did not express the differentiation markers paired box gene-8 and thyroid transcription factor-1 (clone SPT24), but were positive for forkhead box protein A2 and leucine-rich repeat-containing G-protein-coupled receptor 4/GPR48. Follicles newly generated from the primitive follicles had clear or vacuolar cytoplasm with dense, darkly stained nuclei. At day 21 after partial thyroidectomy, the tall cuboidal follicular epithelial cells had clear or vacuolar cytoplasm, and the intraluminal colloid displayed pale staining. Smaller activated follicles were found in the central zone of the lateral lobe, whereas larger mature follicles were located in the peripheral zone. Based on these observations, we propose that the follicle regeneration process in the partially resected adult murine thyroid gland associated with the appearance of primitive follicular cells may be a platform for the budding of differentiated follicles in mice.
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play an active role in the pathogenesis of gastric cancer. The expression and biological function for miR-187 in gastric cancer remains unknow. In the present study, we demonstrated that miR-187 expression was increased in gastric cancer (GC) tissues and cells. Increased expression level of miR-187 was associated with adverse clinical features including tumor size, lymph metastasis and TNM stage, and decreased overall survival and disease-free survival of GC patients. Functionally, overexpression miR-187 could promote while inhibition of miR-187 could suppress, the proliferation, migration and invasion of GC cells in vitro. In vivo experiments showed that overexpression of miR-187 promoted the growth and lung metastasis of SGC-7901 cells in nude mice. Mechanically, we confirmed that FOXA2 was the downstream target of miR-187 in GC cells using luciferase assay, qRT-PCR and western blot analysis. Moreover, overexpression of FOXA2 abrogated the promoting effects of miR-187 overexpression on SGC-7901 cell proliferation, migration and invasion, while inhibition of FOXA2 reversed the inhibitory effects of miR-187 downregulation on these biological functions of AGS cells, suggesting that FOXA2 was a functional mediator of miR-187 in GC. Therefore, this study indicates that miR-187 is potentially a biomarker and treatment target for GC patients.
Establishment of pregnancy is a critical event, and failure of embryo implantation and stromal decidualization in the uterus contribute to significant numbers of pregnancy losses in women. Glands of the uterus are essential for establishment of pregnancy in mice and likely in humans. Forkhead box a2 (FOXA2) is a transcription factor expressed specifically in the glands of the uterus and is a critical regulator of postnatal uterine gland differentiation in mice. In this study, we conditionally deleted FOXA2 in the adult mouse uterus using the lactotransferrin Cre (Ltf-Cre) model and in the neonatal mouse uterus using the progesterone receptor Cre (Pgr-Cre) model. The uteri of adult FOXA2-deleted mice were morphologically normal and contained glands, whereas the uteri of neonatal FOXA2-deleted mice were completely aglandular. Notably, adult FOXA2-deleted mice are completely infertile because of defects in blastocyst implantation and stromal cell decidualization. Leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), a critical implantation factor of uterine gland origin, was not expressed during early pregnancy in adult FOXA2-deleted mice. Intriguingly, i.p. injections of LIF initiated blastocyst implantation in the uteri of both gland-containing and glandless adult FOXA2-deleted mice. Although pregnancy was rescued by LIF and was maintained to term in uterine gland-containing adult FOXA2-deleted mice, pregnancy failed by day 10 in neonatal FOXA2-deleted mice lacking uterine glands. These studies reveal a previously unrecognized role for FOXA2 in regulation of adult uterine function and fertility and provide original evidence that uterine glands and, by inference, their secretions play important roles in blastocyst implantation and stromal cell decidualization.
The forkhead box A2 (FOXA2) is the key transcriptional factor that plays an important role in tumorigenesis. However, until now the expression pattern and role of FOXA2 in glioma have yet to be elucidated. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the expression of FOXA2 in glioma and investigate its role in glioma cells. Our data showed that FOXA2 was significantly downregulated in human glioma cell lines. Forced expression of FOXA2 suppressed the ability of glioma cells to proliferate, migrate, and invade and influenced the expression level of EMT-associated proteins. In addition, forced expression of FOXA2 attenuated tumor growth of glioma in a nude mouse xenograft model. Mechanistically, we disclosed that forced expression of FOXA2 greatly downregulated the expression of β-catenin, cyclin D1, and c-Myc in glioma cells. Taken together, these results show that FOXA2 may play an important role in proliferation, invasion, and tumorigenesis in glioma cells. Thus, FOXA2 may be a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of glioma.
The recognition of β cell dedifferentiation in type 2 diabetes raises the translational relevance of mechanisms that direct and maintain β cell identity. LIM domain-binding protein 1 (LDB1) nucleates multimeric transcriptional complexes and establishes promoter-enhancer looping, thereby directing fate assignment and maturation of progenitor populations. Many terminally differentiated endocrine cell types, however, remain enriched for LDB1, but its role is unknown. Here, we have demonstrated a requirement for LDB1 in maintaining the terminally differentiated status of pancreatic β cells. Inducible ablation of LDB1 in mature β cells impaired insulin secretion and glucose homeostasis. Transcriptomic analysis of LDB1-depleted β cells revealed the collapse of the terminally differentiated gene program, indicated by a loss of β cell identity genes and induction of the endocrine progenitor factor neurogenin 3 (NEUROG3). Lineage tracing confirmed that LDB1-depleted, insulin-negative β cells express NEUROG3 but do not adopt alternate endocrine cell fates. In primary mouse islets, LDB1 and its LIM homeodomain-binding partner islet 1 (ISL1) were coenriched at chromatin sites occupied by pancreatic and duodenal homeobox 1 (PDX1), NK6 homeobox 1 (NKX6.1), forkhead box A2 (FOXA2), and NK2 homeobox 2 (NKX2.2) - factors that co-occupy active enhancers in 3D chromatin domains in human islets. Indeed, LDB1 was enriched at active enhancers in human islets. Thus, LDB1 maintains the terminally differentiated state of β cells and is a component of active enhancers in both murine and human islets.
Recent investigations have reported many markers associated with human liver stem/progenitor cells, "oval cells," and identified "niches" in diseased livers where stem cells occur. However, there has remained a need to identify entire lineages of stem cells as they differentiate into bile ducts or hepatocytes. We have used combined immunohistochemical staining for a marker of hepatic commitment and specification (FOXA2 [Forkhead box A2]), hepatocyte maturation (Albumin and HepPar1), and features of bile ducts (CK19 [cytokeratin 19]) to identify lineages of stem cells differentiating toward the hepatocytic or bile ductular compartments of end-stage cirrhotic human liver. We identified large clusters of disorganized, FOXA2 expressing, oval cells in localized liver regions surrounded by fibrotic matrix, designated as "micro-niches." Specific FOXA2-positive cells within the micro-niches organize into primitive duct structures that support both hepatocytic and bile ductular differentiation enabling identification of entire lineages of cells forming the two types of structures. We also detected expression of hsa-miR-122 in primitive ductular reactions expected for hepatocytic differentiation and hsa-miR-23b cluster expression that drives liver cell fate decisions in cells undergoing lineage commitment. Our data establish the foundation for a mechanistic hypothesis on how stem cell lineages progress in specialized micro-niches in cirrhotic end-stage liver disease.
The cells isolated from biopsy specimen of a patient with alcoholic liver cirrhosis and cultured under standard conditions for obtaining stromal cell culture clearly diverged during early passages into two morphologically and phenotypically different subtypes: epithelial and mesenchymal. Mesenchymal cells expressed CD90 and CD44 and epithelial cells expressed CD166, CD227, and hepatocyte growth factor receptor Met. Starting from passage 6, the culture underwent spontaneous morphological changes and by passages 8-10 contained only epithelium-like cells. CD90 and CD44 expression disappeared, CD166 and CD227 expression remained unchanged, and Met expression increased. A small fraction of cells expressed GATA-4, HNF3β, HNF1α, and HNF4α. After addition of inducers of hepatogeneic differentiation, the cells started producing albumin.
1. Albumin (ALB) is a serum protein most highly expressed in liver and regarded as an effective indicator for liver pathologies. The objectives of this study were to determine the expression of duck ALB gene (duALB) in various non-hepatic tissues and identify the potential cis-regulatory elements in the promoter. 2. A model was established to assess duALB promoter activity in different cell lines by construction of a duALB promoter-driven GFP (Green Fluorescent Protein)-expressing vector, which exhibited high expression activity in liver-derived cells and lower expression in other cells. Through the firefly luciferase reporter gene driven by a series of constructs carrying progressive deletions, the core transcriptional regulatory region within the duALB promoter was identified. Mutations in candidate-binding sites were made by site-directed mutagenesis. 3. The core transcriptional regulatory region was located in the -190/-51 bp region. This region contains three potential transcription factor-binding sites, one each for hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF-3β) (-158/-149), CCAAT/Enhancer-binding protein element (C/EBPα) (-119/-107) and nuclear factor-1 (HNF-1) (-67/-57). Site-directed mutagenesis of HNF-1 and C/EBPα-binding sites resulted in a significant reduction in duALB promoter activity. Two potential cis-regulatory elements (C/EBPα and HNF-1) were responsible for its transcriptional activity in liver-derived cells. 4. These findings contribute to the further understanding of the fundamental mechanisms of ALB gene regulation and the use of tissue-specific gene promoters to regulate tissue-specific expression of exogenous genes in vivo.
To clarify the mechanisms regulating lipoprotein production by hepatocyte nuclear factors (HNFs), we generated four kinds of transfectants in human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells: UE7T-13, stably expressing FOXA2 (also known as HNF3β), HNF4α, HNF1α or co-expressing HNF4α, and HNF1α (HNF4α/HNF1α). In HNF4α/HNF1α transfectants, cellular contents of triglycerides (TG) and cholesterol were markedly higher than in UE7T-13 cells and comparable to those in human hepatoma HepG2 cells. However, TG and cholesterol, which are secreted from cells as components of lipoproteins, were hardly detected in the medium for any of the transfectants. ApoB100 and MTP, which are essential for the formation and secretion of lipoproteins, were undetectable and detected at low levels, respectively, in HNF4α/HNF1α transfectants. We suggest that enforced co-expression of HNF4α and HNF1α is effective for cellular lipid accumulation, while additional factors are probably required for lipoprotein formation and secretion.
Biological rhythms controlled by the circadian clock are absent in embryonic stem cells (ESCs). However, they start to develop during the differentiation of pluripotent ESCs to downstream cells. Conversely, biological rhythms in adult somatic cells disappear when they are reprogrammed into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). These studies indicated that the development of biological rhythms in ESCs might be closely associated with the maintenance and differentiation of ESCs. The core circadian gene Clock is essential for regulation of biological rhythms. Its role in the development of biological rhythms of ESCs is totally unknown. Here, we used CRISPR/CAS9-mediated genetic editing techniques, to completely knock out the Clock expression in mouse ESCs. By AP, teratoma formation, quantitative real-time PCR and Immunofluorescent staining, we did not find any difference between Clock knockout mESCs and wild type mESCs in morphology and pluripotent capability under the pluripotent state. In brief, these data indicated Clock did not influence the maintaining of pluripotent state. However, they exhibited decreased proliferation and increased apoptosis. Furthermore, the biological rhythms failed to develop in Clock knockout mESCs after spontaneous differentiation, which indicated that there was no compensational factor in most peripheral tissues as described in mice models before (DeBruyne et al., 2007b). After spontaneous differentiation, loss of CLOCK protein due to Clock gene silencing induced spontaneous differentiation of mESCs, indicating an exit from the pluripotent state, or its differentiating ability. Our findings indicate that the core circadian gene Clock may be essential during normal mESCs differentiation by regulating mESCs proliferation, apoptosis and activity.
Forkhead box protein A2 (FOXA2) plays an important in development, cellular metabolism and tumorigenesis. The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) identified a modest frequency of FOXA2 mutations in endometrioid endometrial cancers (EEC). The current study sought to determine the relationship between FOXA2 mutation and clinicopathologic features in EEC and FOXA2 expression.
Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification and sequencing were used to identify mutations in 542 EEC. Western blot, quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR) and immunohistochemistry (IHC) were used to assess expression. Methylation analysis was performed using combined bisulfite restriction analysis (COBRA) and sequencing. Chi-squared, Fisher's exact, Student's t- and log-rank tests were performed.
Fifty-one mutations were identified in 49 tumors (9.4% mutation rate). The majority of mutations were novel, loss of function (LOF) (78.4%) mutations, and most disrupted the DNA-binding domain (58.8%). Six recurrent mutations were identified. Only two tumors had two mutations and there was no evidence for FOXA2 allelic loss. Mutation status was associated with tumor grade and not associated with survival outcomes. Methylation of the FOXA2 promoter region was highly variable. Most tumors expressed FOXA2 at both the mRNA and protein level. In those tumors with mutations, the majority of cases expressed both alleles.
FOXA2 is frequently mutated in EEC. The pattern of FOXA2 mutations and expression in tumors suggests complex regulation and a haploinsufficient or dominant-negative tumor suppressor function. In vitro studies may shed light on how mutations in FOXA2 affect FOXA2 pioneer and/or transcription factor functions in EEC.
Biliary-committed progenitor cells (small mouse cholangiocytes; SMCCs) from small bile ducts are more resistant to hepatobiliary injury than large mouse cholangiocytes (LGCCs) from large bile ducts. The definitive endoderm marker, forkhead box A2 (FoxA2), is the key transcriptional factor that regulates cell differentiation and tissue regeneration. Our aim was to characterize the translational role of FoxA2 during cholestatic liver injury. Messenger RNA expression in SMCCs and LGCCs was assessed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) array analysis. Liver tissues and hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) from primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) and primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) patients were tested by real-time PCR for methylation, senescence, and fibrosis markers. Bile duct ligation (BDL) and multidrug resistance protein 2 (MDR2) knockout mice (MDR2-/- ) were used as animal models of cholestatic liver injury with or without healthy transplanted large or small cholangiocytes. We demonstrated that FoxA2 was notably enhanced in murine liver progenitor cells and SMCCs and was silenced in human PSC and PBC liver tissues relative to respective controls that are correlated with the epigenetic methylation enzymes, DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) 1 and DNMT3B. Serum alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase levels in nonobese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficiency mice engrafted with SMCCs post-BDL showed significant changes compared to vehicle-treated mice, along with improved liver fibrosis. Enhanced expression of FoxA2 was observed in BDL mouse liver after SMCC cell therapy. Furthermore, activation of fibrosis signaling pathways were observed in BDL/MDR2-/- mouse liver as well as in isolated HSCs by laser capture microdissection, and these signals were recovered along with reduced hepatic senescence and enhanced hepatic stellate cellular senescence after SMCC engraft.
The definitive endoderm marker and the positive regulator of biliary development, FoxA2, mediates the therapeutic effect of biliary-committed progenitor cells during cholestatic liver injury. (Hepatology 2017;65:544-559).
We show characteristic morphological changes corresponding to epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) program fulfillment in PANC1 cell line stimulated with TGFβ1. Our results support downregulation of E-cadherin protein. We show 5- and 28-fold increase in SNAI1 and SNAI2 expression levels and 25- and 15-fold decrease in CDH1 and KRT8 expression levels, respectively, which confirms the EMT-program fulfillment. We demonstrate downregulation of expression of pancreatic master genes SOX9, FOXA2, and GATA4 (2-, 5-, and 4-fold, respectively) and absence of significant changes in HES1, NR5A2, and GATA6 expression levels in the cells stimulated with TGFβ1. Our results indicate the absence of induction of expression of PTF1A, PDX1, HNF1b, NEUROG3, RPBJL, NKX6.1, and ONECUT1 genes, which are inactive in PANC1 cell line after the EMT stimulated by TGFβ1. 
Parkinson's disease is characterized by the death of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. To understand the molecular mechanisms of the disease, an in vitro model is important. In the 1990s, we used the SV40 large T antigen to immortalize dopaminergic neurons derived from Embryonic Day 14 rat mesencephalon. We selected a clone for its high expression of dopaminergic neuron markers such as tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), and we named it 1RB3AN27 (N27). Because the original N27 cell line has been passaged many times, the line has become a mixture of cell types with highly variable expression of TH. In the current study, we have performed multiple rounds of clonal cultures and have identified a dopaminergic cell clone expressing high levels of TH and the dopamine transporter (DAT). We have named this new clone N27-A. Nearly 100% of N27-A cells express TH, DAT and Tuj1. Western blots have confirmed that N27-A cells have three to four times the levels of TH and DAT compared to the previous mixed population in N27. Further analysis has shown that the new clone expresses the dopamine neuron transcription factors Nurr1, En1, FoxA2 and Pitx3. The N27-A cells express the vesicular monoamine transporter (VMAT2), but do not express dopamine-beta-hydroxylase (DβH), the enzyme responsible for converting dopamine to norepinephrine. Functional analysis has shown that N27-A cells are more sensitive than N27 cells to neurotoxins taken up by the dopamine transporter such as 6-hydroxydopamine and 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridine (MPP+). The DAT inhibitor nomifensine can block MPP+ induced toxicity. The non-selective toxic effects of hydrogen peroxide were similar in both cell lines. The N27-A cells show dopamine release under basal and depolarization conditions. We conclude that the new N27-A clone of the immortalized rat dopaminergic cell line N27 should provide an improved in vitro model for Parkinson's disease research. 
Oxidative stress can contribute to the development and progression of liver diseases, such as drug-induced or alcoholic liver injury, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. Nectandrin B is a bioactive lignan isolated from nutmeg extract. To date, little information is available about its pharmacological activities in the liver. This study investigated the hepatocyte-protective effect of nectandrin B against tert-butylhydroperoxide-induced oxidative injury and the underlying molecular mechanism. The cell viability assay revealed that nectandrin B prevents apoptosis stimulated by tert-butylhydroperoxide in both HepG2 cells and primary mouse hepatocytes. Nectandrin B also attenuated ROS production and restored the depleted glutathione level. Real-time PCR and immunoblot analyses showed that the expression of glutamate-cysteine ligase, an enzyme responsible for the glutathione biosynthesis, was induced by nectandrin B, indicating its indirect antioxidative effect. The NF-E2-related factor-2 (Nrf2) regulates gene expression of an array of antioxidant enzymes in hepatocytes. Nectandrin B stimulated Nrf2 activation as evidenced by its enhanced nuclear accumulation and increased antioxidant response element (ARE)-luciferase activity. Intriguingly, the hepatocyte-protective effect of nectandrin B against oxidative damage was completely abrogated by Nrf2 knockdown using Nrf2 specific siRNA. Nectandrin B promoted ERK activation, but inactivated GSK-3β through the AMPK-mediated inhibitory phosphorylation. The enforced overexpression of dominant-negative mutant of MEK1 or AMPKα, or wild-type GSK-3β inhibited the increase in the NQO1-ARE-luciferase activity stimulated by nectandrin B, suggesting that both ERK and AMPK-GSK-3β signalings are involved in the activation of Nrf2/ARE pathway by nectandrin B. Consistent with this, cytoprotection and restoration of glutathione level by nectandrin B was also blocked by the overexpression of dominant-negative MEK1 or wild-type GSK-3β. Finally, our data demonstrate that nectandrin B has the ability to protect hepatocytes against oxidative injury through the activation of Nrf2/ARE pathway mediated by ERK phosphorylation and AMPK-dependent inactivation of GSK-3β.
Hepatocytes from human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hBM-MSCs) are expected to be a useful source for cell transplantation. However, relatively low efficiency and repeatability of hepatic differentiation of human BM-MSCs remains an obstacle for clinical translation. Hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 alpha (HNF4α), a critical transcription factor, plays an essential role in the entire process of liver development. In this study, immortalized hBM-MSCs, UE7T-13 cells were transduced with a lentiviral vector containing HNF4α. The typical fibroblast-like morphology of the MSCs changed, and polygonal, epithelioid cells grew out after HNF4α transduction. In hepatocyte culture medium, HNF4α-transduced MSCs (E7-hHNF4α cells) strongly expressed the albumin (ALB), CYP2B6, alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT), and FOXA2 mRNA and exhibited morphology markedly similar to that of mature hepatocytes. The E7-hHNF4α cells showed hepatic functions such as Indocyanine green (ICG) uptake and release, glycogen storage, urea production and ALB secretion. Approximately 28% of E7-hHNF4α cells expressed both ALB and AAT. Furthermore, these E7-hHNF4α cells via superior mesenteric vein (SMV) injection expressed human ALB in mouse chronic injured liver. In conclusion, this study represents a novel strategy by directly inducing hepatocyte-like cells from MSCs.
The ZIC2 transcription factor is one of the genes most commonly mutated in Holoprosencephaly (HPE) probands. Studies in cultured cell lines and mice have shown a loss of ZIC2 function is the pathogenic mechanism but the molecular details of this ZIC2 requirement remain elusive. HPE arises when signals that direct morphological and fate changes in the developing brain and facial primordia are not sent or received. One critical signal is sent from the prechordal plate (PrCP) which develops beneath the ventral forebrain. An intact NODAL signal transduction pathway and functional ZIC2 are both required for PrCP establishment. We now show that ZIC2 acts downstream of the NODAL signal during PrCP development. ZIC2 physically interacts with SMAD2 and SMAD3, the receptor activated proteins that control transcription in a NODAL dependent manner. Together SMAD3 and ZIC2 regulate FOXA2 transcription in cultured cells and Zic2 also controls the foxA2 expression during Xenopus development. Variant forms of the ZIC2 protein, associated with HPE in man or mouse, are deficient in their ability to influence SMAD-dependent transcription. These findings reveal a new mechanism of NODAL signal transduction in the mammalian node and provide the first molecular explanation of how ZIC2 loss-of-function precipitates HPE.
Hypothyroidism is a very common hormonal deficiency and the stem cell technology which developed in the recent years may offer a therapeutic strategy for treating this disorder. Hypoxia has been demonstrated to play an important role in embryonic formation and development and to modulate stem cell differentiation. However, the influence of oxygen tension on thyroid differentiation has not been studied. In this study, we used murine induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells for thyroid cell differentiation under normoxic and hypoxic conditions and compared differentiation efficiency in morphology, function, gene and protein expression under both conditions. We found that hypoxia promoted adhesion and outgrowth of embryoid bodies (EBs) derived from murine iPS cells. Expression of endodermal markers (Foxa2 and Gata4) and thyroid transcription factors (Pax8 and Nkx2.1) was increased by hypoxia at both gene and protein levels during early-mid differentiation stages (p&lt;0.05). And so were the thyroid specific markers NIS and TSHR at the end of the experiment (p&lt;0.05). In addition, functional iodide uptake by differentiated cells was also increased after hypoxia. Thyroid differentiation from iPS cells is enhanced under hypoxia and this may involve hypoxia inducible factors (HIFs) and their downstream gene FGF2. Our data offer a foundation for understanding thyroid development and provide a potentially more efficient way to use cell therapy for treating thyroid deficiency.
The molecular mechanisms underlying the formation of the thalamus during development have been investigated intensively. Although transcription factors distinguishing the thalamic primordium from adjacent brain structures have been uncovered, those involved in patterning inside the thalamus are largely unclear. Here, we show that Foxp2, a member of the forkhead transcription factor family, regulates thalamic patterning during development. We found a graded expression pattern of Foxp2 in the thalamic primordium of the mouse embryo. The expression levels of Foxp2 were high in the posterior region and low in the anterior region of the thalamic primordium. In Foxp2 (R552H) knockin mice, which have a missense loss-of-function mutation in the forkhead domain of Foxp2, thalamic nuclei of the posterior region of the thalamus were shrunken, while those of the intermediate region were expanded. Consistently, Foxp2 (R552H) knockin mice showed changes in thalamocortical projection patterns. Our results uncovered important roles of Foxp2 in thalamic patterning and thalamocortical projections during development.
Pancreatic cancer is the fourth leading cause of cancer death in the United States. Better understanding of pancreatic cancer biology may help identify new oncotargets towards more effective therapies. This study investigated the mechanistic actions of microRNA-1291 (miR-1291) in the suppression of pancreatic tumorigenesis. Our data showed that miR-1291 was downregulated in a set of clinical pancreatic carcinoma specimens and human pancreatic cancer cell lines. Restoration of miR-1291 expression inhibited pancreatic cancer cell proliferation, which was associated with cell cycle arrest and enhanced apoptosis. Furthermore, miR-1291 sharply suppressed the tumorigenicity of PANC-1 cells in mouse models. A proteomic profiling study revealed 32 proteins altered over 2-fold in miR-1291-expressing PANC-1 cells that could be assembled into multiple critical pathways for cancer. Among them anterior gradient 2 (AGR2) was reduced to the greatest degree. Through computational and experimental studies we further identified that forkhead box protein A2 (FOXA2), a transcription factor governing AGR2 expression, was a direct target of miR-1291. These results connect miR-1291 to the FOXA2-AGR2 regulatory pathway in the suppression of pancreatic cancer cell proliferation and tumorigenesis, providing new insight into the development of miRNA-based therapy to combat pancreatic cancer.
As known from model organisms, such as frog, fish, mouse, and chicken, the anterior-posterior patterning of the definitive endoderm (DE) into distinct domains is controlled by a variety of signaling interactions between the DE and its surrounding mesoderm. This includes Wnt/FGFs and BMPs in the posterior half and all-trans-retinoic acid, TGF-β-ligands, Wnt-, and BMP-inhibitors in the anterior half of the DE sheet. However, it is currently unclear how these embryonic tissue interactions can be translated into a defined differentiation protocol for human embryonic stem cells. Activin A has been proposed to direct DE into a SOX2-positive foregut-like cell type. Due to the pleiotropic nature of SOX2 in pluripotency and developing cells of the foregut, we purified DE-cells by magnetic cell sorting and tested the effects of anteriorizing and posteriorizing factors on pure endoderm. We show in contrast to previous studies that the generation of the foregut marked by SOX2/FOXA2 double-positive cells does not depend on activin A/TGF-β-signaling but is mediated by the inhibition of Wnt- and BMP-signaling. Retinoic acid can posteriorize and at the same time dorsalize the foregut toward a PDX1-positive pancreatic duodenal cell type whereas active Wnt/beta-catenin signaling synergistically with FGF-2, BMP-4, and RA induces the formation of CDX2-positive posterior endoderm. Thus, these results provide new insights into the mechanisms behind cell specification of human DE derived from pluripotent stem cells. Stem Cells 2016;34:2635-2647.
Mammalian anterior gradient 2 (AGR2), an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) protein disulfide-isomerase (PDI), is involved in cancer cell growth and metastasis, asthma and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Mice lacking Agr2 exhibit decreased Muc2 protein in intestinal goblet cells, abnormal Paneth cell development, ileitis and colitis. Despite its importance in cancer biology and inflammatory diseases, the mechanisms regulating agr2 expression in the gastrointestinal tract remain unclear. In the present study, we investigated the mechanisms that control agr2 expression in the pharynx and intestine of zebrafish by transient/stable transgenesis, coupled with motif mutation, morpholino knockdown, mRNA rescue and ChIP. A 350 bp DNA sequence with a hypoxia-inducible response element (HRE) and forkhead-response element (FHRE) within a region -4.5 to -4.2 kbp upstream of agr2 directed EGFP expression specifically in the pharynx and intestine. No EGFP expression was detected in the intestinal goblet cells of Tg(HREM:EGFP) or Tg(FHREM:EGFP) embryos with mutated HRE or FHRE, whereas EGFP was expressed in the pharynx of Tg(HREM:EGFP), but not Tg(FHREM:EGFP), embryos. Morpholino knockdown of foxa1 (forkhead box A1) reduced agr2 levels in the pharynx, whereas knockdown of foxa2 or hif1ab decreased intestinal agr2 expression and affected the differentiation and maturation of intestinal goblet cells. These results demonstrate that Foxa1 regulates agr2 expression in the pharynx, whereas both Foxa2 and Hif1ab control agr2 expression in intestinal goblet cells to regulate maturation of these cells.
Lung cancer is largely an environmentally caused disease with poor prognosis. An in vitro transformation model of human bronchial epithelial cells (HBEC) was used to study long-term effects of tobacco smoke carcinogens on epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and the forkhead box transcription factors FOXA1 and FOXA2. CDK4 and hTERT immortalized HBEC2 and HBEC12 cell lines were exposed weekly to either cigarette smoke condensate (CSC), benzo[a]pyrene, or methylnitrosourea. Transformed cell lines were established from soft-agar colonies after 12weeks of exposure. HBEC12 was transformed by all exposures while HBEC2 was only transformed by CSC. Untransformed HBEC2 showed little invasive capacity, whereas transformed cell lines completely closed the gap in a matrigel scratch wound assay. CDH1 was down-regulated in all of the transformed cell lines. In contrast, CDH2 was up-regulated in both HBEC2 and one of the HBEC12 transformed cell lines. Furthermore, transformed cells showed activation of EMT markers including SNAI1, ZEB1, VIM, and MMP2. All transformed cell lines had significant down-regulation of FOXA1 and FOXA2, indicating a possible role in cell transformation and EMT. ChIP analysis showed increased binding of Histone-H3 and macroH2A in FOXA1 and FOXA2 in the transformed HBEC2 cell lines, indicating a compact chromatin. In conclusion, long-term carcinogen exposure lead to down-regulation of FOXA1 and FOXA2 concomitantly with the occurrence of EMT and in vitro transformation in HBEC cells. 
Transcriptional regulation by the estrogen receptor-α (ER) has been investigated mainly in breast cancer cell lines, but estrogens such as 17β-estradiol (E2) exert numerous extrareproductive effects, particularly in the liver, where E2 exhibits both protective metabolic and deleterious thrombotic actions. To analyze the direct and early transcriptional effects of estrogens in the liver, we determined the E2-sensitive transcriptome and ER cistrome in mice after acute administration of E2 or placebo. These analyses revealed the early induction of genes involved in lipid metabolism, which fits with the crucial role of ER in the prevention of liver steatosis. Characterization of the chromatin state of ER binding sites (BSs) in mice expressing or not ER demonstrated that ER is not required per se for the establishment and/or maintenance of chromatin modifications at the majority of its BSs. This is presumably a consequence of a strong overlap between ER and hepatocyte nuclear factor 4α BSs. In contrast, 40% of the BSs of the pioneer factor forkhead box protein a (Foxa2) were dependent upon ER expression, and ER expression also affected the distribution of nucleosomes harboring dimethylated lysine 4 of Histone H3 around Foxa2 BSs. We finally show that, in addition to a network of liver-specific transcription factors including CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein and hepatocyte nuclear factor 4α, ER might be required for proper Foxa2 function in this tissue. 
Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is an aggressive cancer with low survival rates and limited therapeutic options. Thus elucidation of signaling pathways involved in PDAC pathogenesis is essential for identifying novel potential therapeutic gene targets. Here, we used a systems approach to elucidate those pathways by integrating gene and microRNA profiling analyses together with CRISPR/Cas9 technology to identify novel transcription factors involved in PDAC pathogenesis. FOXA2 transcription factor was found to be significantly downregulated in PDAC relative to control pancreatic tissues. Functional experiments revealed that FOXA2 has a tumor suppressor function through inhibition of pancreatic cancer cell growth, migration, invasion, and colony formation. In situ hybridization analysis revealed miR-199a to be significantly upregulated in pancreatic cancer. Bioinformatics and luciferase analyses showed that miR-199a negatively but directly regulates FOXA2 expression through binding in its 3'-untranslated region (UTR). Evaluation of the functional importance of miR-199a on pancreatic cancer revealed that miR-199a acts as an inhibitor of FOXA2 expression, inducing an increase in pancreatic cancer cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. Additionally, gene ontology and network analyses in PANC-1 cells treated with a small interfering RNA (siRNA) against FOXA2 revealed an enrichment for cell invasion mechanisms through PLAUR and ERK activation. FOXA2 deletion (FOXA2Δ) by using two CRISPR/Cas9 vectors in PANC-1 cells induced tumor growth in vivo resulting in upregulation of PLAUR and ERK pathways in FOXA2Δ xenograft tumors. We have identified FOXA2 as a novel tumor suppressor in pancreatic cancer and it is regulated directly by miR-199a, thereby enhancing our understanding of how microRNAs interplay with the transcription factors to affect pancreatic oncogenesis.
Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of type 2 diabetes (T2D) have discovered a number of loci that contribute to susceptibility to the disease. Future challenges include elucidation of functional mechanisms through which these GWAS-identified loci modulate T2D disease risk. The aim of the present study was to comprehensively characterize T2D associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and genes through computational approaches.
Computational biology approaches used in the present study included comparative genomic analyses and functional annotation using GWAS3D and RegulomeDB, investigation of the effects of T2D-associated SNPs on miRNA binding and protein phosphorylation, and gene ontology, pathway enrichment, protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks and functional module analysis of T2D-associated genes from previously published GWAS.
Computational analysis identified a number of T2D GWAS-associated SNPs that were located at protein binding sites, including CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF), E1A binding protein p300 (EP300), hepatocyte nuclear factor 4alpha (HNF4A), transcription factor 7 like 2 (TCF7L2), forkhead box A1 (FOXA1) and A2 (FOXA2), and potentially affected the binding of miRNAs and protein phosphorylation. Pathway enrichment analysis confirmed two well-known maturity onset diabetes of the young and T2D pathways, whereas PPI network analysis identified highly interconnected "hub" genes, such as TCF7L2, melatonin receptor 1B (MTNR1B), and solute carrier family 30 (zinc transporter), member 8 (SLC30A8), that created two tight subnetworks.
The results provide objectives and clues for future experimental studies and further insights into the molecular pathogenesis of T2D.
The importance of canonical Wnt signaling to murine uterine development is well established. Mouse models in which uterine-specific Wnt ligands, β-catenin, or Lef1 are disrupted result in failure of postnatal endometrial gland development. Sox17 is a transcription factor characterized in numerous tissues as an antagonist of Wnt signaling. Thus, we hypothesized that conditional ablation of Sox17 would lead to hyperproliferation of endometrial glands in mice. Contrary to our prediction, disruption of Sox17 in epithelial and stromal compartments led to inhibition of endometrial adenogenesis and a loss of reproductive capacity. Epithelium-specific Sox17 disruption resulted in normal adenogenesis although reproductive capacity remained impaired. These findings suggest that non-epithelial, Sox17-positive cells are necessary for adenogenesis and that glands require Sox17 to properly function. To our knowledge, these findings are the first to implicate Sox17 in endometrial gland formation and reproductive success. The data presented herein underscore the importance of studying Sox17 in uterine homeostasis and function.
The rare inborn cblF defect of cobalamin metabolism is caused by mutations in the limb region 1 (LMBR1) domain containing 1 gene (LMBRD1). This defect is characterized by massive accumulation of free cobalamin in lysosomes and loss of mitochondrial succinyl-CoA synthesis and cytosolic methionine synthesis. Affected children suffer from heart defects, developmental delay and megaloblastic anemia. LMBRD1 encodes for LMBD1, a predicted lysosomal cobalamin transport protein. In this study, we determine the physiological function of LMBRD1 during embryogenesis by generating Lmbrd1 deficient mice using the Cre/LoxP system. Complete loss of Lmbrd1 function is accompanied by early embryonic death in mice. Whole mount in situ hybridization studies against bone morphogenetic protein 4 and Nodal show that initial formation of the proximal-distal axis is unaffected in early embryonic stages whereas the initiation of gastrulation is disturbed shown by the expression pattern of even skipped homeotic gene 1 and fibroblast growth factor 8 in Lmbrd1 deficient mice. We conclude that intact function of LMBD1 is essential for the initiation of gastrulation.
Nuclear DNA wraps around core histones to form nucleosomes, which restricts the binding of transcription factors to gene regulatory sequences. Pioneer transcription factors can bind DNA sites on nucleosomes and initiate gene regulatory events, often leading to the local opening of chromatin. However, the nucleosomal configuration of open chromatin and the basis for its regulation is unclear. We combined low and high levels of micrococcal nuclease (MNase) digestion along with core histone mapping to assess the nucleosomal configuration at enhancers and promoters in mouse liver. We find that MNase-accessible nucleosomes, bound by transcription factors, are retained more at liver-specific enhancers than at promoters and ubiquitous enhancers. The pioneer factor FoxA displaces linker histone H1, thereby keeping enhancer nucleosomes accessible in chromatin and allowing other liver-specific transcription factors to bind and stimulate transcription. Thus, nucleosomes are not exclusively repressive to gene regulation when they are retained with, and exposed by, pioneer factors. 
The mechanisms that allow breast cancer (BCa) cells to metabolically sustain rapid growth are poorly understood. Here we report that BCa cells are dependent on a mechanism to supply precursors for intracellular lipid production derived from extracellular sources and that the endothelial lipase (LIPG) fulfils this function. LIPG expression allows the import of lipid precursors, thereby contributing to BCa proliferation. LIPG stands out as an essential component of the lipid metabolic adaptations that BCa cells, and not normal tissue, must undergo to support high proliferation rates. LIPG is ubiquitously and highly expressed under the control of FoxA1 or FoxA2 in all BCa subtypes. The downregulation of either LIPG or FoxA in transformed cells results in decreased proliferation and impaired synthesis of intracellular lipids. 
Insulin-secreting cells have been generated from human embryonic or induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) by mimicking developmental processes. However, these cells do not always secrete glucose-responsive insulin, one of the most important characteristics of pancreatic β-cells. We focused on the importance of endodermal differentiation from human iPSCs in order to obtain functional pancreatic β-cells.
A six-stage protocol was established for the differentiation of human iPSCs to pancreatic β-cells using defined culture media without feeders or serum. The effects of CHIR99021, a selective glycogen synthase kinase-3β inhibitor, were examined in the presence of fibroblast growth factor 2, activin, and bone morphogenetic protein 4 (FAB) during definitive endodermal induction by immunostaining for SRY (sex determining region Y)-box 17 (SOX17) and Forkhead box protein A2 (FOXA2). Insulin secretion was compared between the last stage of monolayer culture and spheroid culture conditions. Cultured cells were transplanted under kidney capsules of streptozotocin-diabetic non-obese diabetic-severe combined immunodeficiency mice, and blood glucose levels were measured once a week. Immunohistochemical analyses were performed 4 and 12 weeks after transplantation.
Addition of CHIR99021 (3 μmol/L) in the presence of FAB for 2 days improved endodermal cell viability, maintaining the high SOX17-positive rate. Spheroid formation after the endocrine progenitor stage showed more efficient insulin secretion than did monolayer culture. After cell transplantation, diabetic mice had lower blood glucose levels, and islet-like structures were detected in vivo.
Functional pancreatic β-cells were generated from human iPSCs. Induction of definitive endoderm and spheroid formation may be key steps for producing these cells.
CYP2B6 plays an increasingly important role in xenobiotic metabolism and detoxification. The constitutive androstane receptor (CAR) and the pregnane X receptor (PXR) have been established as predominant regulators for the inductive expression of CYP2B6 gene in human liver. However, there are dramatic interindividual variabilities in CYP2B6 expression that cannot be fully explained by the CAR/PXR-based modulation alone. Here, we show that expression level of CYP2B6 was correlated with that of hepatocyte nuclear factor 3β (HNF3β) in human primary hepatocytes prepared from 35 liver donors. Utilizing recombinant virus-mediated overexpression or knockdown of HNF3β in HepG2 cells, as well as constructs containing serial deletion and site-directed mutation of HNF3β binding motifs in CYP2B6 luciferase reporter assays, we demonstrated that the presence or lack of HNF3β expression markedly correlated with CYP2B6 gene expression and its promoter activity. Novel enhancer modules of HNF3β located upstream of the CYP2B6 gene transcription start site were identified and functionally validated as key elements governing HNF3β-mediated CYP2B6 expression. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays in human primary hepatocytes and surface plasmon resonance binding affinity experiments confirmed the essential role of these enhancers in the recruitment of HNF3β to the promoter of CYP2B6 gene. Overall, these findings indicate that HNF3β represents a new liver enriched transcription factor that is involved in the transcription of CYP2B6 gene and contributes to the large interindividual variations of CYP2B6 expression in human population. 
FoxO1 binds to insulin response elements located in the promoters of insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 1 (IGFBP1) and glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase), activating their expression. Insulin-mediated phosphorylation of FoxO1 promotes cytoplasmic translocation, inhibiting FoxO1-mediated transactivation. We have previously demonstrated that FoxO1 opens and remodels chromatin assembled from the IGFBP1 promoter via a highly conserved winged helix motif. This finding, which established FoxO1 as a "pioneer" factor, suggested a model whereby FoxO1 chromatin remodeling at regulatory targets facilitates binding and recruitment of additional regulatory factors. However, the impact of FoxO1 phosphorylation on its ability to bind chromatin and the effect of FoxO1 loss on recruitment of neighboring transcription factors at its regulatory targets in liver chromatin is unknown. In this study, we demonstrate that an amino acid substitution that mimics insulin-mediated phosphorylation of a serine in the winged helix DNA binding motif curtails FoxO1 nucleosome binding. We also demonstrate that shRNA-mediated loss of FoxO1 binding to the IGFBP1 and G6Pase promoters in HepG2 cells significantly reduces binding of RNA polymerase II and the pioneer factors FoxA1/A2. Knockdown of FoxA1 similarly reduced binding of RNA polymerase II and FoxO1. Reduction in acetylation of histone H3 Lys-27 accompanies loss of FoxO1 and FoxA1/A2 binding. Interdependent binding of FoxO1 and FoxA1/A2 possibly entails cooperative binding because FoxO1 and FoxA1/A2 facilitate one another's binding to IGFPB1 promoter DNA. These results illustrate how transcription factors can nucleate transcriptional events in chromatin in response to signaling events and suggest a model for regulation of hepatic glucose metabolism through interdependent FoxO/FoxA binding. 
Integrated genomic analysis of 456 pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas identified 32 recurrently mutated genes that aggregate into 10 pathways: KRAS, TGF-β, WNT, NOTCH, ROBO/SLIT signalling, G1/S transition, SWI-SNF, chromatin modification, DNA repair and RNA processing. Expression analysis defined 4 subtypes: (1) squamous; (2) pancreatic progenitor; (3) immunogenic; and (4) aberrantly differentiated endocrine exocrine (ADEX) that correlate with histopathological characteristics. Squamous tumours are enriched for TP53 and KDM6A mutations, upregulation of the TP63∆N transcriptional network, hypermethylation of pancreatic endodermal cell-fate determining genes and have a poor prognosis. Pancreatic progenitor tumours preferentially express genes involved in early pancreatic development (FOXA2/3, PDX1 and MNX1). ADEX tumours displayed upregulation of genes that regulate networks involved in KRAS activation, exocrine (NR5A2 and RBPJL), and endocrine differentiation (NEUROD1 and NKX2-2). Immunogenic tumours contained upregulated immune networks including pathways involved in acquired immune suppression. These data infer differences in the molecular evolution of pancreatic cancer subtypes and identify opportunities for therapeutic development. 
We have previously shown that exposure to phenyl ethyl alcohol (PEA) causes an increase in the expression of the transcription factor otx2 in the olfactory epithelium (OE) of juvenile zebrafish, and this change is correlated with the formation of an odor memory of PEA. Here, we show that the changes in otx2 expression are specific to βPEA: exposure to αPEA did not affect otx2 expression. We identified 34 olfactory receptors (ORs) representing 16 families on 4 different chromosomes as candidates for direct regulation of OR expression via Otx2. Subsequent in silico analysis uncovered Hnf3b binding sites closely associated with Otx2 binding sites in the regions flanking the ORs. Analysis by quantitative polymerase chain reaction and RNA-seq of OR expression in developing zebrafish exposed to different isoforms of PEA showed that a subset of ORs containing both Otx2/Hnf3b binding sites were downregulated only in βPEA-exposed juveniles and this change persisted through adult life. Localization of OR expression by in situ hybridization indicates the downregulation occurs at the level of RNA and not the number of cells expressing a given receptor. Finally, analysis of immediate early gene expression in the OE did not reveal changes in c-fos expression in response to either αPEA or βPEA. 
Although the incidence of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is continuously increasing in the aging population worldwide, effective therapies are not available. The interplay between causative genetic and environmental factors is partially understood. Meta-analyses have been performed on aspects such as polymorphisms, cytokines, and cognitive training. Here, we propose a meta-analysis approach based on hierarchical clustering analysis of a reliable training set of hippocampus biopsies, which is condensed to a gene expression signature. This gene expression signature was applied to various test sets of brain biopsies and iPSC-derived neuronal cell models to demonstrate its ability to distinguish AD samples from control. Thus, our identified AD-gene signature may form the basis for determination of biomarkers that are urgently needed to overcome current diagnostic shortfalls. Intriguingly, the well-described AD-related genes APP and APOE are not within the signature because their gene expression profiles show a lower correlation to the disease phenotype than genes from the signature. This is in line with the differing characteristics of the disease as early-/late-onset or with/without genetic predisposition. To investigate the gene signature's systemic role(s), signaling pathways, gene ontologies, and transcription factors were analyzed which revealed over-representation of response to stress, regulation of cellular metabolic processes, and reactive oxygen species. Additionally, our results clearly point to an important role of FOXA1 and FOXA2 gene regulatory networks in the etiology of AD. This finding is in corroboration with the recently reported major role of the dopaminergic system in the development of AD and its regulation by FOXA1 and FOXA2. 
The forkhead/winged helix transcription factor Foxa2 is a major upstream regulator of Pdx1, a transcription factor necessary for pancreatic development. In the present study, we conditionally knocked out Foxa2 in Pdx1-expressing domain and further analyzed the contribution of Foxa2 to α- and β-cell development and the effect of Foxa2 deletion on plasma insulin, glucagon, and glucose levels. Homozygous pdx1 Foxa2 mice and heterozygous pdx1 Foxa2 mice were generated by homologous recombination using a Foxa2 gene-targeting vector. α- and β-cell mass was examined by immunofluorescence microscopy. Plasma glucose, insulin, and plasma were measured at postnatal day 10. For pdx1 lineage tracing studies, heterozygous pdx1 Foxa2 EYFP and homozygous pdx1 Foxa2 EYFP mice were used. Our immunofluorescence analysis revealed that in the pancreas sections of the homozygous mutant mice, Foxa2 was virtually absent from non-β cells and its expression almost exclusively coincided with remnant β cells. The density of both α and β cells apparently decreased in the pancreas of the heterozygous mutant mice and in the pancreas of the homozygous mutant mice, α cells lost its predominance and β cells increased proportionally. Direct Pdx1 cell lineage tracing revealed that, on embryonic day 18.5, in the homozygous mutant mice, Pdx1 expression coincided almost exclusively with that of insulin-secreting β cells. Chemiluminescence assays revealed that heterozygous pdx1 Foxa2 mice had significantly lower insulin levels than control mice (P &lt; 0.01). However, no apparent difference was observed between homozygous pdx1 Foxa2 mice and control mice (P &gt; 0.05). Chemiluminescence assays also showed that Foxa2 deletion significantly depressed plasma glucagon levels in both homozygous pdx1 Foxa2 mice and heterozygous pdx1 Foxa2 mice (P &lt; 0.01 vs. controls). Plasma glucose on postnatal day 10 was significantly lower in homozygous pdx1 Foxa2 mice compared with control mice (P &lt; 0.01). Our study demonstrates that homozygous Foxa2 ablation leads to an imbalance in β/α ratio, profound hypoglucagonemia, inappropriate hyperinsulinemia, and hypoglycemia in mice. Our conditional tissue-specific Foxa2 ablation mouse model will be useful in elucidating regulation of normal and abnormal α- and β-cell differentiation and pinpointing novel targets for diabetes control.
Mutations in hepatocyte nuclear factor 1 transcription factors (HNF1α/β) are associated with diabetes. These factors are well studied in the liver, pancreas and kidney, where they direct tissue-specific gene regulation. However, they also have an important role in the biology of many other tissues, including the intestine. We investigated the transcriptional network governed by HNF1 in an intestinal epithelial cell line (Caco2). We used chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by direct sequencing (ChIP-seq) to identify HNF1 binding sites genome-wide. Direct targets of HNF1 were validated using conventional ChIP assays and confirmed by siRNA-mediated depletion of HNF1, followed by RT-qPCR. Gene ontology process enrichment analysis of the HNF1 targets identified multiple processes with a role in intestinal epithelial cell function, including properties of the cell membrane, cellular response to hormones, and regulation of biosynthetic processes. Approximately 50% of HNF1 binding sites were also occupied by other members of the intestinal transcriptional network, including hepatocyte nuclear factor 4A (HNF4A), caudal type homeobox 2 (CDX2), and forkhead box A2 (FOXA2). Depletion of HNF1 in Caco2 cells increases FOXA2 abundance and decreases levels of CDX2, illustrating the coordinated activities of the network. These data suggest that HNF1 plays an important role in regulating intestinal epithelial cell function, both directly and through interactions with other intestinal transcription factors. 
Generation of induced dopaminergic (iDA) neurons may provide a significant step forward towards cell replacement therapy for Parkinson's disease (PD). To study and compare transcriptional programs of induced cells versus primary DA neurons is a preliminary step towards characterizing human iDA neurons. We have optimized a protocol to efficiently generate iDA neurons from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs). We then sequenced the transcriptomes of iDA neurons derived from 6 different hPSC lines and compared them to that of primary midbrain (mDA) neurons. We identified a small subset of genes with altered expression in derived iDA neurons from patients with Parkinson's Disease (PD). We also observed that iDA neurons differ significantly from primary mDA neurons in global gene expression, especially in genes related to neuron maturation level. Results suggest iDA neurons from patient iPSCs could be useful for basic and translational studies, including in vitro modeling of PD. However, further refinement of methods of induction and maturation of neurons may better recapitulate full development of mDA neurons from hPSCs. 
Elucidating the molecular mechanisms involved in the differentiation of stem cells to hepatic cells is critical for both understanding normal developmental processes as well as for optimizing the generation of functional hepatic cells for therapy. We performed in vitro differentiation of mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) with a null mutation in the homeobox gene Hhex and show that Hhex(-/-) mESCs fail to differentiate from definitive endoderm (Sox17(+/)Foxa2(+)) to hepatic endoderm (Alb(+)/Dlk(+)). In addition, hepatic culture elicited a &gt;7-fold increase in Vegfa mRNA expression in Hhex(-/-) cells compared to Hhex(+/+) cells. Furthermore, we identified VEGFR2(+)/ALB(+/)CD34(-) in early Hhex(+/+) hepatic cultures. These cells were absent in Hhex(-/-) cultures. Finally, through manipulation of Hhex and Vegfa expression, gain and loss of expression experiments revealed that Hhex shares an inverse relationship with the activity of the Vegf signaling pathway in supporting hepatic differentiation. In summary, our results suggest that Hhex represses Vegf signaling during hepatic differentiation of mouse ESCs allowing for cell-type autonomous regulation of Vegfr2 activity independent of endothelial cells.
Recent living condition improvements, changes in dietary habits, and reductions in physical activity are contributing to an increase in metabolic syndrome symptoms including diabetes and obesity. Through such societal developments, humankind is continuously exposed to metabolic diseases such as diabetes, and the number of the victims is increasing. This study investigated Cordyceps militaris water extract (CMW)-induced glucose uptake in HepG2 cells and the effect of CMW treatment on glucose metabolism.
Colorimetric assay kits were used to determine the glucokinase (GK) and pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) activities, glucose uptake, and glycogen content. Either RT-PCR or western blot analysis was performed for quantitation of glucose transporter 2 (GLUT2), hepatocyte nuclear factor 1 alpha (HNF-1α), phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3k), protein kinase B (Akt), phosphorylated AMP-activated protein kinase (pAMPK), phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, GK, PDH, and glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK-3β) expression levels. The α-glucosidase inhibitory activities of acarbose and CMW were evaluated by absorbance measurement.
CMW induced glucose uptake in HepG2 cells by increasing GLUT2 through HNF-1α expression stimulation. Glucose in the cells increased the CMW-induced phosphorylation of AMPK. In turn, glycolysis was stimulated, and glyconeogenesis was inhibited. Furthermore, by studying the mechanism of action of PI3k, Akt, and GSK-3β, and measuring glycogen content, the study confirmed that the glucose was stored in the liver as glycogen. Finally, CMW resulted in a higher level of α-glucosidase inhibitory activity than that from acarbose.
CMW induced the uptake of glucose into HepG2 cells, as well, it induced metabolism of the absorbed glucose. It is concluded that CMW is a candidate or potential use in diabetes prevention and treatment.
The transcription factors (TF) Foxa2 and Pdx1 are key regulators of beta-cell (β-cell) development and function. Mutations of these TFs or their respective cis-regulatory consensus binding sites have been linked to maturity diabetes of the young (MODY), pancreas agenesis, or diabetes susceptibility in human. Although Foxa2 has been shown to directly regulate Pdx1 expression during mouse embryonic development, the impact of this gene regulatory interaction on postnatal β-cell maturation remains obscure.
In order to easily monitor the expression domains of Foxa2 and Pdx1 and analyze their functional interconnection, we generated a novel double knock-in homozygous (FVFPBFDHom) fluorescent reporter mouse model by crossing the previously described Foxa2-Venus fusion (FVF) with the newly generated Pdx1-BFP (blue fluorescent protein) fusion (PBF) mice.
Although adult PBF homozygous animals exhibited a reduction in expression levels of Pdx1, they are normoglycemic. On the contrary, despite normal pancreas and endocrine development, the FVFPBFDHom reporter male animals developed hyperglycemia at weaning age and displayed a reduction in Pdx1 levels in islets, which coincided with alterations in β-cell number and islet architecture. The failure to establish mature β-cells resulted in loss of β-cell identity and trans-differentiation towards other endocrine cell fates. Further analysis suggested that Foxa2 and Pdx1 genetically and functionally cooperate to regulate maturation of adult β-cells.
Our data show that the maturation of pancreatic β-cells requires the cooperative function of Foxa2 and Pdx1. Understanding the postnatal gene regulatory network of β-cell maturation will help to decipher pathomechanisms of diabetes and identify triggers to regenerate dedifferentiated β-cell mass.
Lipoprotein lipase (LPL) catalyzes the hydrolysis of triglycerides from triglyceride-rich lipoproteins such as VLDL and chylomicrons in the circulation. Mutations in LPL or its activator apolipoprotein C-II cause hypertriglyceridemia in humans and animal models. The levels of LPL in the liver are low but they can be strongly induced by a high cholesterol diet or by synthetic ligands of Liver X Receptors (LXRs). However, the mechanism by which LXRs activate the human LPL gene is unknown. In the present study we show that LXR agonists increased the mRNA and protein levels as well as the promoter activity of human LPL in HepG2 cells. A promoter deletion analysis defined the proximal -109/-28 region, which contains a functional FOXA2 element, as essential for transactivation by ligand-activated LXRα/RXRα heterodimers. Silencing of endogenous FOXA2 in HepG2 cells by siRNAs or by treatment with insulin compromised the induction of the LPL gene by LXR agonists whereas mutations in the FOXA2 site abolished the synergistic transactivation of the LPL promoter by LXRα/RXRα and FOXA2. Physical and functional interactions between LXRα and FOXA2 were established in vitro and ex vivo. In summary, the present study revealed a novel mechanism of human LPL gene induction by oxysterols in the liver with is based on physical and functional interactions between transcription factors LXRα and FOXA2. This mechanism, which may not be restricted to the LPL gene, is critically important for a better understanding of the regulation of cholesterol and triglyceride metabolism in the liver under healthy or pathological states.
Aberrant DNA methylation patterns have been reported in inflamed tissues and may play a role in disease. We studied DNA methylation and gene expression profiles of purified intestinal epithelial cells from ulcerative colitis patients, comparing inflamed and non-inflamed areas of the colon. We identified 577 differentially methylated sites (false discovery rate &lt;0.2) mapping to 210 genes. From gene expression data from the same epithelial cells, we identified 62 differentially expressed genes with increased expression in the presence of inflammation at prostate cancer susceptibility genes PRAC1 and PRAC2. Four genes showed inverse correlation between methylation and gene expression; ROR1, GXYLT2, FOXA2, and, notably, RARB, a gene previously identified as a tumor suppressor in colorectal adenocarcinoma as well as breast, lung and prostate cancer. We highlight targeted and specific patterns of DNA methylation and gene expression in epithelial cells from inflamed colon, while challenging the importance of epithelial cells in the pathogenesis of chronic inflammation.
Extraembryonic endoderm (XEN) cells are stem cell lines derived from primitive endoderm cells of inner cell mass in blastocysts. These cells have self-renewal properties and differentiate into visceral endoderm (VE) and parietal endoderm (PE) of the yolk sac. Recently, it has been reported that XEN cells can contribute to fetal embryonic endoderm, and their unique potency has been evaluated. In this study, we have described the induction and characterization of new canine stem cell lines that closely resemble to XEN cells. These cells, which we designated canine induced XEN (ciXEN)-like cells, were induced from canine embryonic fibroblasts by introducing four transgenes. ciXEN-like cells expressed XEN markers, which could be maintained over 50 passages in N2B27 medium supplemented with inhibitors of mitogen-activated protein kinase p38 and transforming growth factor-beta 1. Our ciXEN-like cells were maintained without transgene expression and exhibited upregulated expression of VE and PE markers in feeder-free conditions. The cells differentiated from ciXEN-like cells using a coculture system showed multiple nuclei and expressed albumin protein, similar to characteristics of hepatocytes. Furthermore, these cells expressed the adult hepatocyte marker, CYP3A4. Interestingly, these cells also formed a net structure expressing the bile epithelium capillary marker, multidrug resistance-associated protein 2. Thus, we have demonstrated the induction of a new canine stem cell line, ciXEN-like cells, which could form an embryonic endodermal cell layer. Our ciXEN-like cells may be a helpful tool to study the canine embryo development and represent a promising cell source for proceeding human and canine regenerative medicine.
The extracellular matrix (ECM) microenvironment is involved in the regulation of hepatocyte phenotype and function. Recently, the cell-derived extracellular matrix has been proposed to represent the bioactive and biocompatible materials of the native ECM. Here, we show that the endothelial cell-derived matrix (EC matrix) promotes the metabolic maturation of human adipose stem cell-derived hepatocyte-like cells (hASC-HLCs) through the activation of the transcription factor forkhead box protein A2 (FOXA2) and the nuclear receptors hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 alpha (HNF4α) and pregnane X receptor (PXR). Reducing the fibronectin content in the EC matrix or silencing the expression of α5 integrin in the hASC-HLCs inhibited the effect of the EC matrix on Src phosphorylation and hepatocyte maturation. The inhibition of Src phosphorylation using the inhibitor PP2 or silencing the expression of Src in hASC-HLCs also attenuated the up-regulation of the metabolic function of hASC-HLCs in a nuclear receptor-dependent manner. These data elucidate integrin-Src signalling linking the extrinsic EC matrix signals and metabolic functional maturation of hepatocyte. This study provides a model for studying the interaction between hepatocytes and non-parenchymal cell-derived matrix.
Insulin resistance is a critical factor contributing to the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes and other metabolic diseases. Recent studies have indicated that miR-338-3p plays an important role in cancer. Here, we investigated whether miR-338-3p mediates tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α)-induced hepatic insulin resistance.
The activation of the insulin signalling pathway and the level of glycogenesis were examined in the livers of the db/db and high fat diet (HFD)-fed mice and in HEP1-6 cells transfected with miR-338-3p mimic or inhibitor. Computational prediction of microRNA target, luciferase assay and Western blot were used to assess the miR-338-3p target. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay was used to determine the transcriptional regulator of miR-338-3p.
miR-338-3p was down-regulated in the livers of the db/db, HFD-fed and TNF-α-treated C57BL/6J mice, as well as in mouse HEP1-6 hepatocytes treated with TNF-α. Importantly the down-regulation of miR-338-3p induced insulin resistance, as indicated by impaired glucose tolerance and insulin tolerance. Further research showed that the down-regulated miR-338-3p resulted in the impaired AKT/ glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSl·Gβ) signalling pathway and glycogen synthesis. In contrast, hepatic over-expression of miR-338-3p rescued the TNF-α-induced insulin resistance. Moreover, protein phosphatase 4 regulator subunit 1 (PP4R1) was identified as a direct target of miR-338-3p that mediated hepatic insulin signalling by regulating protein phosphatase 4 (PP4). Finally we identified hepatic nuclear factor 4 alpha (HNF-4α) as the transcriptional regulator of miRNA-338-3p.
Our studies provide novel insight into the critical role and molecular mechanism by which miR-338-3p is involved in TNF-α-induced hepatic insulin resistance. miR-338-3p might mediate TNF-α-induced hepatic insulin resistance by targeting PP4R1 to regulate PP4 expression.
Reflux esophagitis damages the squamous epithelium that normally lines the esophagus, and promotes replacement of the damaged squamous lining by the intestinal metaplasia of Barrett's esophagus, the precursor of esophageal adenocarcinoma. Therefore, to prevent the development of Barrett's metaplasia and esophageal adenocarcinoma, the pathogenesis of reflux esophagitis must be understood. We have reported that reflux esophagitis, both in a rat model and in humans, develops as a cytokine-mediated inflammatory injury (i.e., cytokine sizzle), not as a caustic chemical injury (i.e., acid burn), as traditionally has been assumed. Moreover, reflux induces activation of hypoxia inducible factor (HIF)-2α, which enhances the transcriptional activity of nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) causing increases in pro-inflammatory cytokines and in migration of T lymphocytes, an underlying molecular mechanism for this cytokine-mediated injury. In some individuals, reflux esophagitis heals with Barrett's metaplasia. A number of possibilities exist for the origin of the progenitor cells that give rise to this intestinal metaplasia including those of the esophagus, the proximal stomach, or the bone marrow. However, intestinal cells are not normally found in the esophagus, the stomach, or the bone marrow. Thus, the development of Barrett's intestinal metaplasia must involve some molecular reprogramming of key developmental transcription factors within the progenitor cell, a process termed transcommitment, which may be initiated by the noxious components of the gastric refluxate. This review will highlight recent studies on the pathogenesis of reflux esophagitis and on reflux-related molecular reprogramming of esophageal squamous epithelial cells in the pathogenesis of Barrett's metaplasia.
Goblet cell metaplasia, a common feature of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), is associated with mucus hypersecretion which contributes to the morbidity and mortality among patients. Transcription factors SAM-pointed domain-containing Ets-like factor (SPDEF) and forkhead box protein A2 (FOXA2) regulate goblet cell differentiation. This study aimed to (1) investigate DNA methylation and expression of SPDEF and FOXA2 during goblet cell differentiation and (2) compare this in airway epithelial cells from patients with COPD and controls during mucociliary differentiation.
To assess DNA methylation and expression of SPDEF and FOXA2 during goblet cell differentiation, primary airway epithelial cells, isolated from trachea (non-COPD controls) and bronchial tissue (patients with COPD), were differentiated by culture at the air-liquid interface (ALI) in the presence of cytokine interleukin (IL)-13 to promote goblet cell differentiation.
We found that SPDEF expression was induced during goblet cell differentiation, while FOXA2 expression was decreased. Importantly, CpG number 8 in the SPDEF promoter was hypermethylated upon differentiation, whereas DNA methylation of FOXA2 promoter was not changed. In the absence of IL-13, COPD-derived ALI-cultured cells displayed higher SPDEF expression than control-derived ALI cultures, whereas no difference was found for FOXA2 expression. This was accompanied with hypomethylation of CpG number 6 in the SPDEF promoter and also hypomethylation of CpG numbers 10 and 11 in the FOXA2 promoter.
These findings suggest that aberrant DNA methylation of SPDEF and FOXA2 is one of the factors underlying mucus hypersecretion in COPD, opening new avenues for epigenetic-based inhibition of mucus hypersecretion.
Infantile hemangioma is a vascular neoplasm and is one of the most common tumors diagnosed in young children. Although most hemangiomas are harmless and involute spontaneously, some show severe progression, leading to serious complications, such as high-output cardiac failure, ulcerations, compression of the trachea or deprivation amblyopia, depending on their size and localization. However, the pathogenesis and cause of hemangioma are largely unknown to date. The goal of this study was to identify markers that could predict hemangiomas with aggressive growth and severe progression that would benefit from early intervention. By using a PCR-based screening approach, we first confirmed that previously known markers of hemangioma, namely FGF2 and GLUT1, are highly expressed in hemangioma. Nevertheless, these genes did not show any differential expression between severely progressing tumors and mild tumors. However, transcriptional upregulation of several Hedgehog signalling components, comprising the ligand Sonic Hedgehog (SHH), the transcription factor GLI2 and its target gene FOXA2 were detected in extremely aggressive hemangioma specimens during the proliferation phase. Notably, GLI2 was even overexpressed in involuting hemangiomas if they showed an aggressive growth pattern. In conclusion, our data suggest that overexpression of the Hedgehog components SHH, GLI2 and FOXA2 might be used as markers of an aggressive hemangioma that would benefit from too early intervention, while FGF2 and GLUT1 are more general markers of hemangiomas.
To enhance survival and generation of definitive endoderm cells from human embryonic stem cells in a simple and reproducible system.
Definitive endoderm (DE) differentiation from human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) was induced under a chemical-defined condition withdrawn insulin supplement and serum albumin. We dissected influence of "alternative growth factors", WNT3A, BMP4 and bFGF in activin A-driven differentiation by detection of DE-associated genes expression and cell viability. Expression of DE-associated SOX17 and FOXA2 genes was analyzed by real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Western blot assays. Quantitative evaluation of DE efficiency was performed by flow cytometry analysis of CXCR4-expressed cell population. Cell viability during DE differentiation was analyzed by an Annexin V/PI double staining test.
Supplementation with WNT3A, BMP4 or bFGF promoted DE generation in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Cell apoptosis elicited by activin A was significantly ameliorated by a cocktail with WNT3A, BMP4 and bFGF. This allowed for sustained cell viability without insulin-containing supplements, thereby indirectly improving the efficiency of DE generation. Therefore, the cocktail containing is optimal for efficient DE generation in the presence of activin A and an insulin/albumin-free condition.
This optimal condition facilitates the balance between the productivity and the viability maintenance, and could be valuable for mass production of DE with minimal variation.
The allantois-derived umbilical component of the chorio-allantoic placenta shuttles fetal blood to and from the chorion, thereby ensuring fetal-maternal exchange. The progenitor populations that establish and supply the fetal-umbilical interface lie, in part, within the base of the allantois, where the germ line is claimed to segregate from the soma. Results of recent studies in the mouse have reported that STELLA (DPPA-3, PGC7) co-localizes with PRDM1 (BLIMP1), the bimolecular signature of putative primordial germ cells (PGCs) throughout the fetal-placental interface. Thus, if PGCs form extragonadally within the posterior region of the mammal, they cannot be distinguished from the soma on the basis of these proteins. We used immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence, and confocal microscopy of the mouse gastrula to co-localize STELLA with a variety of gene products, including pluripotency factor OCT-3/4, mesendoderm-associated T and MIXl1, mesendoderm- and endoderm-associated FOXa2 and hematopoietic factor Runx1. While a subpopulation of cells localizing OCT-3/4 was always found independently of STELLA, STELLA always co-localized with OCT-3/4. Despite previous reports that T is involved in specification of the germ line, co-localization of STELLA and T was detected only in a small subset of cells in the base of the allantois. Slightly later in the hindgut lip, STELLA+/(OCT-3/4+) co-localized with FOXa2, as well as with RUNX1, indicative of definitive endoderm and hemangioblasts, respectively. STELLA was never found with MIXl1. On the basis of these and previous results, we conclude that STELLA identifies at least five distinct cell subpopulations within the allantois and hindgut, where they may be involved in mesendodermal differentiation and hematopoiesis at the posterior embryonic-extraembryonic interface. These data provide a new point of departure for understanding STELLA's potential roles in building the fetal-placental connection.
Decreased expression of airway epithelial-specific transcription factor NK2 homeobox 1 (NKX2-1) was associated with allergic inflammation in asthma patients. However, the expression and role of NKX2-1 in nasal polyps (NPs) with different endotypes were undefined yet.
We examined the expression of key cytokines (interleukin [IL]-4 IL-5, IL-13, and IL-17A, etc.) and NKX2-1 in NPs with different endotypes and control tissues by immunohistochemistry staining, qualitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and Western blot analysis.
We found 23% of chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) with NP (CRSwNP) patients had IL-5+ eosinophilic NPs, 40.7% of NPs were key cytokines negative NPs (KCN NPs) with less eosinophil accumulation. The expression of NKX2-1 in IL-5+ NPs was significantly lower than KCN NPs and normal controls (p &lt; 0.05). The expression of mucin 5AC (MUC5AC) and MUC5B, as well as goblet cells hyperplasia, were significantly elevated in IL-5+ NPs, which correlated with the decreased expression of NKX2-1 (p &lt; 0.05). Moreover, "SAM pointed domain containing ETS transcription factor" (SPDEF) was significantly elevated, while expression of Forkhead Box A2 (FoxA2) was significantly decreased in IL-5+ NPs (p &lt; 0.05). The expression of chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 17 (CCL17) and IL-4 was significantly increased in IL-5+ NPs, which was associated with eosinophil accumulation(p &lt; 0.05).
The downregulation of NKX2-1 in IL-5+ NPs may be associated with tissue eosinophilia and goblet cells hyperplasia.
Our goal is to decipher which DNA sequences are required for tissue-specific expression of epididymal genes. At least 6 epididymis-specific lipocalin genes are known. These are differently regulated and regionalized in the epididymis. Lipocalin 5 (Lcn5 or mE-RABP) and Lipocalin 8 (Lcn8 or mEP17) are homologous genes belonging to the epididymis-specific lipocalin gene cluster. Both the 5 kb promoter fragment of the Lcn5 gene and the 5.3 kb promoter fragment of the Lcn8 gene can direct transgene expression in the epididymis (Lcn5 to the distal caput and Lcn8 to the initial segment), indicating that these promoter fragments contain important cis-regulatory element(s) for epididymis-specific gene expression. To define further the fragments regulating gene expression, the Lcn5 promoter was examined in transgenic mice and immortalized epididymal cell lines. After serial deletion, the 1.8 kb promoter fragment of the Lcn5 gene was sufficient for tissue-specific and region-specific gene expression in transgenic mice. Transient transfection analysis revealed that a transcription factor forkhead box A2 (Foxa2) interacts with androgen receptor and binds to the 100 bp fragment of the Lcn5 promoter between 1.2 kb and 1.3 kb and that Foxa2 expression inhibits androgen-dependent induction of the Lcn5 promoter activity. Immunohistochemistry indicated a restricted expression of Foxa2 in the epididymis where endogenous Lcn5 gene expression is suppressed and that the Foxa2 inhibition of the Lcn5 promoter is consistent with the lack of expression of Lcn5 in the corpus and cauda. Our approach provides a basic strategy for further analysis of the epididymal lipocalin gene regulation and flexible control of epididymal function.
We have used a yeast genetic system to isolate cDNAs encoding proteins that specifically interact with the ligand-binding domain of human retinoid X receptor-alpha (RXR alpha). A number encoded portions of two known RXR heterodimer partners, the retinoic acid receptor (RAR) and the peroxisome proliferator activated receptor. Of four additional RXR-interacting proteins (RIPs) selected for further study two, RIP14 and RIP15, are previously unidentified orphan members of the nuclear receptor superfamily. Two others, RIP110 and RIP13, do not show significant similarities to previously reported proteins. RIP110 interacts with LexA-RXR only in yeast cells grown in the presence of the RXR ligand 9-cis-RA, while the interaction of the four receptor superfamily members and RIP13 is unaffected by the presence or absence of 9-cis-RA. RIP110 and RIP13 also interact in yeast with several other members of the receptor superfamily, but RIP14 and RIP15 interact only with RXR. Analysis of larger cDNA clones demonstrates that there are at least two isoforms of RIP14 that differ in the N-terminal (A and B) and hinge (D) domains. Northern blot analysis indicates that RIP14 is expressed specifically in liver and kidney, while RIP15 is expressed in every tissue tested. Both RIP14 and 15 bind as heterodimers with RXR to the RA response element (RARE) from the promoter of the RAR beta 2 isoform (the beta RARE), and RIP14 and RXR heterodimers also bind the ecdysone response element from the Drosophila heat shock protein 27 promoter. Both heterodimers also bind to several synthetic RAREs and other elements. In cotransfections, neither RIP14 nor RIP15 trans-activates a reporter containing multiple copies of the beta RARE under any of a variety of conditions, suggesting that their activities are dependent on the binding of as yet unidentified specific ligands or on activation by other processes.
The Liver X receptors (LXR) alpha and beta and their target genes such as the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters have been shown to be crucially involved in the regulation of cellular cholesterol homeostasis. The aim of this study was to characterize the role of LXR alpha/beta in the human placenta under normal physiological circumstances and in preeclampsia.
We investigated the expression pattern of the LXRs and their target genes in the human placenta during normal pregnancy and in preeclampsia. Placental explants and cell lines were studied under different oxygen levels and pharmacological LXR agonists.
Gene expressions (Taqman PCR) and protein levels (Western Blot) were combined with immunohistochemistry to analyze the expression of LXR and its target genes.
In the human placenta, LXRA and LXRB expression increased during normal pregnancy. This was paralleled by the expression of their prototypical target genes, e.g., the cholesterol transporter ABCA1. Interestingly, early-onset preeclamptic placentae revealed a significant upregulation of ABCA1. Culture of JAr trophoblast cells and human first trimester placental explants under low oxygen lead to increased expression of LXRA and ABCA1 which was further enhanced by the LXR agonist T0901317.
LXRA together with ABCA1 are specifically expressed in the human placenta and can be regulated by hypoxia. Deregulation of this system in early preeclampsia might be the result of placental hypoxia and hence might have consequences for maternal-fetal cholesterol transport.
Liver X receptors (LXRs) are key regulators of macrophage function, controlling transcriptional programs involved in lipid homeostasis and inflammation. However, exactly how LXRs modulate inflammation during infection remains unknown. To explore this, we used a mouse model of Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection. Upon intratracheal infection with M. tuberculosis, LXRs and LXR target genes were induced in CD11c+ lung and alveolar cells. Furthermore, mice deficient in both LXR isoforms, LXRalpha and LXRbeta (Lxra-/-Lxrb-/- mice), were more susceptible to infection, developing higher bacterial burdens and an increase in the size and number of granulomatous lesions. Interestingly, mice solely deficient in LXRalpha, but not those lacking only LXRbeta, mirrored the susceptibility of the Lxra-/-Lxrb-/- animals. Lxra-/-Lxrb-/- mice failed to mount an effective early neutrophilic airway response to infection and showed dysregulation of both pro- and antiinflammatory factors in CD11c+ lung cells. T cell responses were strongly affected in Lxra-/-Lxrb-/- mice, showing near-complete abrogation of the infection-induced Th1 function - and even more so Th17 function - in the lungs. Treatment of WT mice with the LXR agonists TO901317 and GW3965 resulted in a 10-fold decrease of the pulmonary bacterial burden and a comparable increase of Th1/Th17 function in the lungs. The dependence of LXR signaling on the neutrophil IL-17 axis represents what we believe to be a novel function for these nuclear receptors in resistance to M. tuberculosis infection and may provide a new target for therapeutics.
Liver X receptor alpha (LXRA) and beta (LXRB) regulate glucose and lipid homeostasis in model systems but their importance in human physiology is poorly understood. This project aimed to determine whether common genetic variations in LXRA and LXRB associate with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and quantitative measures of glucose homeostasis, and, if so, reveal the underlying mechanisms.
Eight common single nucleotide polymorphisms in LXRA and LXRB were analyzed for association with T2D in one French cohort (N = 988 cases and 941 controls), and for association with quantitative measures reflecting glucose homeostasis in two non-diabetic population-based samples comprising N = 697 and N = 1344 adults. Investigated quantitative phenotypes included fasting plasma glucose, serum insulin, and HOMAIR as measure of overall insulin resistance. An oral glucose tolerance test was performed in N = 1344 of adults. The two alleles of the proximal LXRB promoter, differing only at the SNP rs17373080, were cloned into reporter vectors and transiently transfected, whereupon allele-specific luciferase activity was measured. rs17373080 overlapped, according to in silico analysis, with a binding site for Nuclear factor 1 (NF1). Promoter alleles were tested for interaction with NF1 using direct DNA binding and transactivation assays.
Genotypes at two LXRB promoter SNPs, rs35463555 and rs17373080, associated nominally with T2D (P values 0.047 and 0.026). No LXRA or LXRB SNP associated with quantitative measures reflecting glucose homeostasis. The rs17373080 C allele displayed higher basal transcription activity (P value &lt; 0.05). The DNA-mobility shift assay indicated that oligonucleotides corresponding to either rs17373080 allele bound NF1 transcription factors in whole cell extracts to the same extent. Different NF1 family members showed different capacity to transactivate the LXRB gene promoter, but there was no difference between promoter alleles in NF1 induced transactivation activity.
Variations in the LXRB gene promoter may be part of the aetiology of T2D. However, the association between LXRB rs35463555 and rs17373080, and T2D are preliminary and needs to be investigated in additional larger cohorts. Common genetic variation in LXRA is unlikely to affect the risk of developing T2D or quantitative phenotypes related to glucose homeostasis.
We examined the function of the oxysterol receptors (LXRs) in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) through studying dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)- and 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS)-induced colitis in mice and by elucidating molecular mechanisms underlying their anti-inflammatory action. We observed that Lxr-deficient mice are more susceptible to colitis. Clinical indicators of colitis including weight loss, diarrhea and blood in feces appeared earlier and were more severe in Lxr-deficient mice and particularly LXRβ protected against symptoms of colitis. Addition of an LXR agonist led to faster recovery and increased survival. In contrast, Lxr-deficient mice showed slower recovery and decreased survival. In Lxr-deficient mice, inflammatory cytokines and chemokines were increased together with increased infiltration of immune cells in the colon epithelium. Activation of LXRs strongly suppressed expression of inflammatory mediators including TNFα. While LXRα had anti-inflammatory effects in CD11b(+) immune cell populations, LXRβ in addition had anti-inflammatory effects in colon epithelial cells. Lack of LXRβ also induced CD4(+)/CD3(+) immune cell recruitment to the inflamed colon. Expression of both LXRA and LXRB was significantly suppressed in inflamed colon from subjects with IBD compared with non-inflamed colon. Taken together, our observations suggest that the LXRs could provide interesting targets to reduce the inflammatory responses in IBD. 
The Liver X receptors (LXRs), Liver X receptor A (LXRA) and Liver X receptor B (LXRB), regulate lipid metabolism and antimicrobial response. LXRs have a crucial role in the control of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb). Lacking LXRs mice is more susceptibility to infection M.tb, developing higher bacterial burdens and an increase in the size and number of granulomatous lesions. We aimed to assess the associations between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in LXRs and risk of tuberculosis.
We sequenced the LXRs genes to detect SNPs and to examine genotypic frequencies in 600 patients and 620 healthy controls to investigate for associations with tuberculosis (TB) in the Chinese Han population. DNA re-sequencing revealed eight common variants in the LXRs genes.
The G allele of rs1449627 and the T allele of rs1405655 demonstrated an increased risk of developing TB (p&lt;0.001, p = 0.002), and the T allele of rs3758673, the T allele of rs2279238, and the C allele of rs1449626 in LXRA and the C allele of rs17373080, the G allele of rs2248949, and the C allele of rs1052677 in LXRB were protective against TB patients compared to healthy controls (p = 0.0002, p = 0.006, p&lt;0.001, p = 0.004, p = 0.008, p = 0.003, respectively). All SNP genotypes were significantly associated with TB. An estimation of the frequencies of haplotypes revealed two potential risk haplotypes,GGCG in LXRB (p = 0.004,) and TTCG in LXRA (p&lt;0.001, p = 0.004). Moreover, three protective haplotypes, TTAT and CCAT in LXRA and CATC in LXRB, were significantly "protective" (p = 0.008, p&lt;0.001, p = 0.031) for TB. Furthermore, we determined that the LXRs SNPs were nominally associated with the clinical pattern of disease.
Our study data supported that LXRs play a fundamental role in the genetic susceptibility to TB and to different clinical patterns of disease. Thus, further investigation is required in larger populations and in additional areas.
Cholesterol precursors act as activators of the nuclear hormone receptor, liver X receptor (LXR). One of these LXR-activating ligands is meiosis activating sterol (MAS), which also induces resumption of meiosis in oocytes from mice in vitro. Whether LXR participates in the regulation of oocyte maturation and whether the expression of either one of the two paralogues of LXR (alpha and beta) affect fertility of mice has, however, not yet been clarified. Female mice lacking Lxra, Lxrb or both genes (Lxra(-/-), Lxrb(-/-) and Lxrab(-/-), respectively) conceive less frequently and have significantly fewer pups per litter as compared to wild type mice. Both Lxra and Lxrb mRNA were found to be expressed in mouse oocytes. The relative expression of, in particular, Lxrb was almost two orders of magnitude higher than in liver, brain and testis. A water-soluble LXR agonist caused naked oocytes, but not cumulus enclosed oocytes (CEO), from wild type mice to resume meiosis significantly more often than control oocytes. Follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) is a potent stimulator of meiosis in CEO from wild type mice, but was without effect in mice lacking both Lxr genes. Zymosterol, a MAS active substance, induced resumption of meiosis in oocytes from Lxrab(-/-) mice, but significantly less effectively than in oocytes from wild type mice. Taken together, LXRs seem to affect ovarian function, suggesting specific roles of cholesterol precursors in regulation of female reproduction.
Liver X receptor alpha (LXRA) and beta (LXRB) are members of the nuclear receptor subfamily and are important regulators of genes involved in lipid, fatty acid and glucose metabolism in liver, and adipose tissue as well as in skeletal muscle. To investigate whether the two LXR genes play a role in influencing lean and fat growth in pigs, we discovered and examined two polymorphisms in LXRA (LXRA Bsl in exon 2, and LXRA HpyCH4 III in intron 8) and one polymorphism in LXRB (LXRB Aci I in exon 5) for genetic linkage and association analyses. Linkage analyses using a three-generation resource family of a cross between the Berkshire and Yorkshire (BY) pig breeds assigned LXRA to SSC2 and LXRB to SSC6. Association analyses were carried out among those polymorphisms and traits evaluated in the BY F(2) family and four pig commercial populations. These analyses indicated that the LXRA HpyCH4 III polymorphism was significantly associated with loin eye area and total lipid in individuals from the BY family. Significant associations were also found between Bsl I polymorphism in LXRA and boneless loin (%), as well as marbling score in one commercial line. The LXRB Aci I polymorphism was significantly associated with lean meat and fat content in the BY family and a number of the commercial lines examined. Our current findings suggested that LXRA and LXRB might have potential effects, especially for loin lean and fat content.
Lipids (cholesterol and fatty acids) are essential nutriments and have a major impact on gene expression. Hence cholesterol intracellular concentration is precisely controlled by some complex mechanisms involving transcriptional regulations. The excess of cholesterol in cells is converted into oxysterols. These cholesterol metabolites are important signalisation molecules that modulate several transcription factors involved in cholesterol homeostasis. Schematically, regulation of cholesterol homeostasis is achieved by three different but complementary pathways: 1) endogeneous biosynthesis, which corresponds to the de novo synthesis of cholesterol and is controlled by sterol response element binding proteins (SREBPs); 2) the transport, intracellular absorption and esterification of the cholesterol; 3) the metabolic conversion into bile acids and steroid hormones. These three pathways are closely linked, however we will schematically detail the role of the orphan nuclear receptors on the modulation of these three levels of regulation. Phenotype analyses of knock-out or transgenic mice pointed out the respective role of the "enterohepatic" orphan nuclear receptors LXRalpha, LXRB, FXR, LRH-1, the nuclear receptor PPARalpha, and their heterodimeric partner RXR, as well as the peculiar receptor SHP. Complex feed-backs have thus been demonstrated. These transciptional regulations have several targets: the P450 cytochromes involved in the bile acid synthesis Cyp7a1 and Cyp8b1; the intestinal bile acid binding protein IBABP; the cholesteryl ester transfert protein CETP and phospholipid transfert protein PLTP, both involved in the HDL catabolism; the ABC cholesterol transporters ABCG1/ABC8 and ABCAI/ABCI. At last it seems that polyunsaturated fatty acids could activate LXRalpha transcription through its activation by PPARalpha. In the near future, the identification and study of new target genes by transcriptomic or proteomic analyses will allow a better understanding of lipid homeostasis in physiological as well as pathophysiological conditions.
The nuclear receptors LXRalpha (NR1H3) and LXRbeta (NR1H2) are attractive drug targets for the treatment of diabetes and cardiovascular disease due to their established role as regulators of cholesterol and lipid metabolism. A large body of literature has recently indicated their important roles in glucose metabolism and particularly LXRbeta is important for proper insulin production in pancreas. In this study, we report that glucose induces transcription via the LXRB gene promoter. The transcription start site of the human LXRB gene was determined and we identified two highly conserved, and functional, ETS and Elk1 binding sites, respectively, in the LXRB gene promoter. The Elk1 binding site also bound the serum responsive factor (SRF). Mutation of these sites abolished binding. Furthermore, mutation of the binding sites or siRNA knockdown of SRF and Elk1 significantly reduced the promoter activity and impaired the glucose response. Our results indicate that the human LXRB gene is controlled by glucose, thereby providing a novel mechanism by which glucose regulates cellular functions via LXRbeta.
LXRA and LXRB genes regulate adiposity, energy dissipation, as well as glucose and lipid homeostasis in mice. We investigated the LXR genes in human obesity.
LXRA and LXRB mRNAs were quantified in abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue of obese and nonobese women. The LXRA and LXRB genes were screened for polymorphisms and common single nucleotide polymorphisms genotyped in obese and nonobese women.
Relative LXRA mRNA expression levels were higher in obese women (P=0.03). One LXRA single nucleotide polymorphism, rs2279238, and one common haplotype, CAAGCC, as well as two LXRB single nucleotide polymorphisms, LB44732G&gt;A and rs2695121, were associated with obesity phenotypes (nominal P values of 0.0075, 0.0014, 0.008 and 0.02, respectively). Furthermore, there was evidence of interaction between LXRA and LXRB alleles in determining body mass index.
Our results support a role for LXRA in human adipose tissue. The nominal associations of LXRA and LXRB alleles with obesity are interesting and should be further investigated in independent data sets.
In ruminants, recent research has identified a crucial role for liver X receptors (LXR) in regulating lipid metabolism in mammary cells. However, the differences between LXR subtypes in regulating ruminant lipid metabolism are unknown. We used overexpression and knockdown of LXRA and LXRB in goat primary mammary epithelial cells to distinguish subtype-specific regulation of sterol regulatory element binding protein 1c (SREBP1c) and fatty acid synthase (FASN) mRNA expression and their promoter activity. Incubation with siRNA targeting LXR decreased expression of LXRA and LXRB. Knockdown of LXRA and LXRB in cells incubated with dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, control) had no effect on the expression of SREBP1c or FASN. Knockdown of LXRB in cells incubated with LXR ligand T0901317 (T09) led to decreased expression of FASN, but not SREBP1c. Overexpression of LXRB plus T09 dramatically upregulated SREBP1c and FASN to levels higher than overexpression of LXRA with T09. Luciferase reporter assays in cells with site-directed mutagenesis of LXR response elements (LXRE; LXRE1 from -286 to -251 bp or LXRE2 from -235 to -219 bp) revealed that the SREBP1c promoter with the wild type or either LXRE mutation in cells supplemented with T09 decreased markedly only when LXRB was knocked down. Knockdown of LXRA and LXRB had no effect on the SREBP1c promoter when cells had a double LXRE mutation. Overexpression of LXRA only in cells incubated with T09 increased the activity of the SREBP1c promoter with the wild type and the LXRE2 mutation. In contrast, compared with each control group, overexpression of LXRB dramatically increased SREBP1c promoter activity, regardless of LXRE mutation. Furthermore, in cells stimulated with T09, knockdown of either LXRA or LXRB did not alter wild-type FASN promoter activity. Knockdown of LXRA increased wild-type and LXRE-site-mutated (LXRE from -677 to -662 bp) FASN promoter activity. Overexpression of LXRB increased wild-type and LXRE-site-mutated FASN promoter activity regardless of treatment with DMSO or T09, but overexpression of LXRA altered LXRE-site-mutated FASN promoter activity only in cells treated with DMSO. Increased activation of SREBP1c or FASN promoters containing LXRE mutations after overexpression of LXRB suggested that LXRB activates endogenous SREBP1c, which can then bind to the promoter of SREBP1c via an auto-loop circuit regulatory mechanism. Collectively, these results highlight an important role for LXRB in the transcriptional regulation of SREBP1c and FASN in goat mammary epithelial cells. Activation of this nuclear receptor controls lipogenesis via different mechanisms.
Tissue specific expression of genes encoding cholesterol transporters ABCA1 and ABCG1 as well as genes encoding the most important transcriptional regulators of adipogenesis - LXRa, LXRb, PPARg and RORa has been investigated in intraabdominal adipose tissue (IAT) samples.A direct correlation between the content of ABCA1 and ABCG1 proteins with RORa protein level (r=0.480, p&lt;0.05; r=0.435, p&lt;0.05, respectively) suggests the role of the transcription factor RORa in the regulation of IAT ABCA1 and ABCG1 protein levels. ABCA1 and ABCG1 gene expression positively correlated with obesity indicators such as body mass index (BMI) (r=0.522, p=0.004; r=0.594, p=0.001, respectively) and waist circumference (r=0.403, p=0.033; r=0.474, p=0.013, respectively). The development of obesity is associated with decreased IAT levels of RORa and LXRb mRNA (p=0.016 and p=0.002, respectively). These data suggest that the nuclear factor RORa can play a significant role in the regulation of cholesterol metabolism and control IAT expression of ABCA1 and ABCG1, while the level of IAT LXRb gene expression may be an important factor associated with the development of obesity.

Niemann-Pick C1-like 1 (NPC1L1), ATP-binding cassette (ABC)G5, and ABCG8 mediate intestinal cholesterol absorption. It is unclear whether pravastatin (PR) or ezetimibe (EZ) affect expression of these transporters. We examined the effects of PR and EZ on NPC1L1, ABCG5, and ABCG8 expression in human hepatoma HepG2 cells and the murine small intestine. We also assessed expression of the transcription factors liver X receptor (LXR)a, LXRb and sterol regulatory element-binding protein.
Transporter mRNA levels were determined in murine small intestines 6 and 24 h after oral PR and EZ administration by real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). In PR- and EZ-treated HepG2 cells, transporter and transcription factor mRNA and protein levels were examined by RT-PCR and western blot, respectively.
Significant decreases in NPC1L1, ABCG5, and ABCG8 mRNA expression were observed in the duodenum, but not jejunum and ileum, of mice 24 h after treatment with PR, but not EZ. In HepG2 cells, PR but not EZ treatment for 24 h also significantly decreased NPC1L1 protein and ABCG5, and ABCG8 mRNA expression, while increasing LXRa mRNA levels.
PR but not EZ treatment reduced duodenal cholesterol transporter expression in mice. PR-induced increases in LXRa mRNA levels may be involved in attenuation of NPC1L1 expression, subsequently decreasing intestinal cholesterol absorption.
Uveal melanoma (UM) is recognized as the most common intraocular malignancy and the second most common form of melanoma. Nearly 50% of UM patients develop untreatable and fatal metastases. The 48-member nuclear receptor (NR) superfamily represents a therapeutically targetable group of transcription factors known for their regulation of key cancer pathways in numerous tumor types. Here, we profiled the expression of the 48 human NRs by qRT-PCR across a melanoma cell line panel including 5 UM lines, 9 cutaneous melanoma (CM) lines, and normal primary melanocytes. NR expression patterns identified a few key features. First, in agreement with our past studies identifying RXRg as a CM-specific marker, we found that UM cells also exhibit high levels of RXRg expression, making it a universal biomarker for melanoma tumors. Second, we found that LXRb is highly expressed in both UM and CM lines, suggesting that it may be a therapeutic target in a UM metastatic setting as it has been in CM models. Third, we found that RARg, PPARd, EAR2, RXRa, and TRa expressions could subdivide UM from CM. Previous studies of UM cancers identified key mutations in three genes: GNAQ, GNA11, and BRAF. We found unique NR expression profiles associated with each of these UM mutations. We then performed NR-to-NR and NR-to-genome expression correlation analyses to find potential NR-driven transcriptional programs activated in UM and CM. Specifically, RXRg controlled gene networks were identified that may drive melanoma-specific signaling and metabolism. ERRa was identified as a UM-defining NR and genes correlated with its expression confirm the role of ERRa in metabolic control. Given the plethora of available NR agonists, antagonists, and selective receptor modulators, pharmacologic manipulation of these NRs and their transcriptional outputs may lead to a more comprehensive understanding of key UM pathways and how we can leverage them for better therapeutic alternatives. 
Apolipoprotein M (APOM) has been suggested as a vasculoprotective constituent of high density lipoprotein (HDL), which plays a crucial role behind the mechanism of HDL-mediated anti-atherosclerosis. Previous studies demonstrated that insulin resistance could associate with decreased APOM expressions. In agreement with our previous reports, here, we further confirmed that the insulin sensitivity was also reduced in rats treated with high concentrations of glucose; such effect could be reversed by administration of rosiglitazone, a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPARγ). The present study shows that Apom expression is significantly affected by either rosiglitazone or hyperglycemia alone without cross interaction with each other, which indicates that the pathway of Apom expression regulating by hyperglycemia might be differed from that by rosiglitazone. Further study indicated that hyperglycemia could significantly inhibit mRNA levels of Lxrb (P=0.0002), small heterodimer partner 1 (Shp1) (P&lt;0.0001), liver receptor homologue-1 (Lrh1) (P=0.0012), ATP-binding cassette transporter 1 (Abca1) (P=0.0012) and Pparb/d (P=0.0043). Two-way ANOVA analysis demonstrated that the interactions between rosiglitazone and infusion of 25% glucose solution on Shp1 (P=0.0054) and Abca1 (4E, P=0.0004) mRNA expression was statistically significant. It is concluded that rosiglitazone could increase Apom expression, of which the detailed mechanism needs to be further investigated. The downregulation of Apom by hyperglycemia might be mainly through decreasing expression of Pparg and followed by inhibiting Lxrb in rats. 
Metabolic syndrome (MetS) has been postulated to increase the risk for type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease and cancer. Adipose tissue (AT) plays an important role in metabolic homeostasis, and AT dysfunction has an active role in metabolic diseases. MetS is closely related to lifestyle and environmental factors. Epigenetics has emerged as an interesting landscape to evaluate the possible interconnection between AT and metabolic disease, since it can be modulated by environmental factors and metabolic status. The aim of this study was to determine whether MetS has an impact on the global DNA methylation pattern and the DNA methylation of several genes related to adipogenesis (PPARG, PPARA), lipid metabolism (RXRA, SREBF2, SREBF1, SCD, LPL, LXRb), and inflammation (LRP1 C3, LEP and TNF) in visceral adipose tissue. LPL and TNF DNA methylation values were significantly different in the control-case comparisons, with higher and lower methylation respectively in the MetS group. Negative correlations were found between global DNA methylation (measured by LINE-1 methylation levels) and the metabolic deterioration and glucose levels. There were associations among variables of MetS, BMI, and HOMA-IR with DNA methylation at several CpG positions for the studied genes. In particular, there was a strong positive association between serum triglyceride levels (TG) with PPARA and LPL methylation levels. TNF methylation was negatively associated with the metabolic worsening and could be an important factor in preventing MetS occurrence according to logistic regression analysis. Therefore, global DNA methylation and methylation at specific genes related to adipogenesis, lipid metabolism and inflammation are related to the etiology of MetS and might explain in part some of the features associated to metabolic disorders.
Triclosan (TCS), a commonly used antimicrobial compound, has recently been detected in the eggs of wild avian species. Exposure to TCS in rodents is known to interfere with thyroid hormone (TH), disrupt immune responses and cause liver disease. However, no attempt has been made to clarify the effects of TCS in avian species. The aim of this study is therefore to evaluate the toxic effects of in ovo exposure to TCS and explore the molecular mechanism by transcriptome analysis in the embryonic liver of a model avian species, chicken (Gallus gallus). Embryos were treated with graded concentration of TCS (0.1, 1 and 10 μg/g egg) at Hamburger Hamilton Stage (HHS) 1 (1st day), followed by 20 days of incubation to HHS 46. At the administration of 10 μg TCS/g egg, embryo mortality increased from 20% in control to 37% accompanied with 8% attenuation in tarsus length. While liver somatic index (LSI) in TCS treatments was enhanced, statistical difference was only observed at the treatment of 0.1 μg TCS/g egg in females. The up-regulation of several crucial differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in transcriptome analysis suggested that TCS induced xenobiotic metabolism (e.g. CYP2C23a, CYP2C45 and CYP3A37 in males; CYP2C45 in females) and activated the thyroid hormone receptor (THR) - mediated downstream signaling (e.g. THRSPB and DIO2 in males; THRSPB in females). In females, TCS may further activate the lipogenesis signaling (e.g. ACSL5, ELOVL2) and repress the lipolysis signaling (e.g. ABHD5, ACAT2). A battery of enriched transcription factors in relation to these TCS-induced signaling and phenotypes were found, including activated SREBF1, PPARa, LXRa, and LXRb in males and activated GLI2 in females; COUP-TFII was predicted to be suppressed in both genders. Finally, we developed adverse outcome pathways (AOPs) that provide insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the alteration of phenotypes.
The signals that determine atherosclerosis-specific DNA methylation profiles are only partially known. We previously identified a 29-bp DNA motif (differential methylation motif [DMM]) proximal to CpG islands (CGIs) that undergo demethylation in advanced human atheromas. Those data hinted that the DMM docks modifiers of DNA methylation and transcription.
We sought to functionally characterize the DMM. We showed that the DMM overlaps with the RNA polymerase III-binding B box of Alu short interspersed nuclear elements and contains a DR2 nuclear receptor response element. Pointing to a possible functional role for an Alu DMM, CGIs proximal (&lt;100 bp) to near-intact DMM-harboring Alu are significantly less methylated relative to CGIs proximal to degenerate DMM-harboring Alu or to DMM-devoid mammalian-wide interspersed repeat short interspersed nuclear elements in human arteries. As for DMM-binding factors, LXRB (liver X receptor β) binds the DMM in a DR2-dependent fashion, and LXR (liver X receptor) agonists induce significant hypermethylation of the bulk of Alu in THP-1 cells. Furthermore, we describe 3 intergenic long noncoding RNAs that harbor a DMM, are under transcriptional control by LXR agonists, and are differentially expressed between normal and atherosclerotic human aortas. Notably, CGIs adjacent to those long noncoding RNAs tend to be hypomethylated in symptomatic relative to stable human atheromas.
Collectively, the data suggest that a DMM is associated with 2 distinct methylation states: relatively low methylation of in cis CGIs and Alu element hypermethylation. Based on the known atheroprotective role of LXRs, we propose that LXR agonist-induced Alu hypermethylation, a landmark of atherosclerosis, is a compensatory rather than proatherogenic response.
Liver X receptor [LXR; nuclear receptor subfamily 1, group H, member 2 (NR1H2, alias LXRB)] can inhibit proliferation and induce apoptosis of cancer cells. Its relationship with disease severity is not known.
Expression of LXRB, ATP binding cassette subfamily A member 1 (ABCA1), ATP binding cassette subfamily G member 1 (ABCG1), apolipoprotein E (APOE) and paraoxonase 2 (PON2) were determined in 69 breast tumors and were related to clinical stages of the disease and tumor characteristics, as well as time to recurrence.
ABCG1 expression differed with the tumor Scarff Bloom and Richardson (SBR) status (p=0.02), with a lower expression in SBRIII than in SBRII and SBRI. ABCG1 expression was significantly higher in estrogen receptor-positive tumors (N=63) (p=0.02). APOE expression was significantly lower in progesterone receptor-positive tumors (N=55) (p=0.03). No relationship with time to recurrence was observed.
Expression of some LXR-dependent genes is related to breast tumor characteristics, but not time to recurrence. This may be due to a lack of study power or too short a follow-up time.
Melanogenesis is the process of production of melanin pigments that are responsible for the colors of skin, eye, and hair and provide protection from ultraviolet radiation. However, excessive levels of melanin formation cause hyperpigmentation disorders such as freckles, melasma, and age spots. Liver X receptors (LXR) are nuclear oxysterol receptors belonging to the family of ligand-activated transcription factors and physiological regulators of lipid and cholesterol metabolism. In the skin, activation of LXRs stimulates differentiation of keratinocytes and augments lipid synthesis in sebocytes. However, the function of LXRs in melanogenesis has not been clearly elucidated. In addition, although beauvericin, a well-known mycotoxin primarily isolated from several fungi, has various biological properties, its involvement in melanogenesis has not been reported. Therefore, in this study, we examined the effects of beauvericin on melanogenesis and its molecular mechanisms. Beauvericin decreased melanin content and tyrosinase activity without any cytotoxicity. Beauvericin also reduced protein levels of MITF, tyrosinase, TRP1, and TRP2. In addition, beauvericin suppressed cAMP-PKA-CREB signaling and upregulated expression of LXR-α, resulting in the suppression of p38 MAPK. Our results indicate that beauvericin attenuates melanogenesis by regulating both cAMP/PKA/CREB and LXR-α/p38 MAPK pathways, consequently leading to a reduction of melanin levels.
De novo lipogenesis (DNL) is a complex and highly regulated process in which carbohydrates from circulation are converted into fatty acids that are then used for synthesizing either triglycerides or other lipid molecules. Dysregulation of DNL contributes to human diseases such as obesity, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases. Thus, the lipogenic pathway may provide a new therapeutic opportunity for combating various pathological conditions that are associated with dysregulated lipid metabolism. Hepatic DNL has been well documented, but lipogenesis in adipocytes and its contribution to energy homeostasis and insulin sensitivity are less studied. Recent reports have gained significant insights into the signaling pathways that regulate lipogenic transcription factors and the role of DNL in adipose tissues. In this review, we will update the current knowledge of DNL in white and brown adipose tissues with the focus on transcriptional, post-translational, and central regulation of DNL. We will also summarize the recent findings of adipocyte DNL as a source of some signaling molecules that critically regulate energy metabolism.
Oxysterol receptors LXRs (α and β) are recently reported to be one of the novel and potential therapeutic targets in reducing cell proliferation and tumor growth in different system model. Activation of LXRs is correlated with modification of PI3K/Akt pathway. LXRs are also found to play a critical role in maintaining lipid homeostatais by regulating ABCA1, IDOL, SREBP1, LDLR and also certain lipogenic genes such as FASN and SCD1. In the present study a potential furanocoumarin, Bergapten (BeG) has been evaluated for its anticancer property on Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) on LXR axis. The molecular docking analysis was carried out for BeG on LXR (α &amp; β) using Maestro tool and compared with reference ligands. This was followed by in vitro (HepG2 cell lines) and in vivo (on NDEA induced HCC in Wistar albino rats) anticancer evaluation of BeG. The docking results revealed polar and hydrophobic interactions of BeG with LXR (α,β). The in vitro studies revealed the potential of BeG in lowering the accumulation of lipid droplets in HepG2 cells which was correlated with increase in LXR (α,β) protein expressions. Furthermore, the in vivo studies demonstrated the potential of BeG in ameliorating the cancer induced alterations in body weight, liver weight and significant restoration of the changes in mRNA and protein expressions of LXR(α,β), ABCA1, IDOL, SREBP1 and LDLR. BeG also modulated the expressions of PI3K, Akt and certain lipogenic genes like FASN and SCD1 and reduced the lipid droplets level in liver cancer cells. These results provide evidence and validates the critical role of BeG in maintaining the lipid homeostasis and justifies its anticancer potential against NDEA-induced HCC.
The Liver X Receptors (LXRs) drive the transcriptional response to excess intracellular cholesterol. Oxysterols, the products of cholesterol oxidation, are activating ligands for LXR that can accumulate under conditions of oxidative stress and disrupt cholesterol homeostasis. While activation of LXR inhibits trophoblast differentiation, the impact of LXR on trophoblast physiology or cholesterol homeostasis is incompletely understood. We sought to determine if the effects of LXR activation can be ameliorated through modification of cholesterol bioavailability or inhibition of LXR-driven cholesterol efflux in trophoblasts.
We measured the effect of oxysterol exposure on BeWo cells and primary human trophoblasts (PHT cells) cultured in lipoprotein-deficient medium. We also measured the effect of the synthetic, LXR-specific ligand T0901317 on PHT cell differentiation and survival. Finally, we silenced the ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1), a transcriptional target of LXR that drives cholesterol efflux, to determine if inhibition of cholesterol efflux could block the effects of T0901317.
Oxysterols inhibited BeWo survival and PHT cell differentiation, and these effects were blocked by cholesterol supplementation. T0901317 also inhibited PHT cell differentiation, and this effect was similarly blocked by cholesterol. Unlike cholesterol however, ABCA1 silencing did not modify the effect of T0901317 on PHT cell differentiation.
Oxysterols and LXR inhibit trophoblast survival and differentiation exclusively in conditions of cholesterol scarcity. These findings underscore the importance of cholesterol homeostasis in the maintenance of placental function and suggest that pathways regulating cholesterol homeostasis may represent therapeutic targets to mitigate harmful sequelae of placental injury.
Stearoyl CoA desaturases (SCD) are enzymes that convert saturated to monounsaturated fatty acids and have increased activity in hepatic steatosis.
We aimed to investigate the potential of ginger extract (GIN) to modulate the liver SCD1 expression and activity in hyperlipidemic (HL) conditions, in order to lower lipid accumulation in the steatotic liver.
Male Golden Syrian hamsters were divided in three groups: (i) fed with standard chow (N), (ii) fed with standard chow plus 3% cholesterol and 15% butter for 21 weeks (HL), (iii) HL treated with GIN (800 µg/kg body weight/day) in the last 5 weeks of fat diet (HL-GIN). Cholesterol (C), triglycerides (TG), non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA), SCD1 estimated activity (C16:1n7/C16:0; C18:1n9/C18:0) and gene expression, acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), paraoxonase1 (PON1) and myeloperoxidase (MPO) were determined in the plasma and liver of all hamsters. We measured protein expression of endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) markers, gene and protein expression of liver X receptor α/β (LXRα/β), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ), ATP-binding cassette sub-family G member 5/8 (ABCG5/G8) and 7α-hydroxylase1 (CYP7A1) in all hamsters' livers.
In plasma, in HL-GIN versus HL hamsters, SCD1 estimated activity was lower (27%; 15%, p &lt; 0.05), NEFA levels decreased by 91%, p &lt; 0.001, while C and TG levels did not vary; the oxidative stress expressed as MPO and TBARS levels decreased (15%; 11%, p &lt; 0.01), while PON1 protein increased (75%, p &lt; 0.05). In the liver of HL-GIN versus HL, C, TG, NEFA, MPO and TBARS levels decreased (8-40%, p &lt; 0.05) and PON1 protein levels increased (30%, p &lt; 0.05), SCD1 estimated activity decreased (8%; 9%, p &lt; 0.05), in parallel with the reduced gene expression of SCD1 and ACC (70-80%, p &lt; 0.05). The protein expression of the ERS sensors decreased (30-65%, p &lt; 0.05), while that of ABCG5/G8, CYP7A1, LXRα/β and PPARγ increased in HL-GIN (20-30%, p &lt; 0.05) versus HL liver.
GIN reduces SCD1 estimated activity and expression, as well as the lipids accumulated in the livers of HL hamsters. This is achieved through a mechanism involving the decrease of the oxidative and ERS, and the enhancement of cholesterol efflux.
Metabolic reprogramming plays a critical role in the important cellular metabolic alterations that occur during the activation of immune cells to enable them to adapt to the extracellular environment. Here, we review recent studies on how substrate availability and metabolites mediate the signalling pathways that regulate fatty acid synthesis (FAS) in different immune cells and how FAS determines cellular fate and function. The major regulators sterol regulatory element-binding proteins and liver X receptors, the key enzyme ATP citrate lyase and the PI3K-Akt-mTOR signalling axis play important roles in de novo FAS during a variety of biological events, including cellular proliferation and differentiation and the development of organelles and intracellular membrane components in immune cells. In addition, the regulation of FAS substantially contributes to the inflammatory response of immune cells. Post-transcriptional modifications in FAS are also closely associated with the functional processes of immune cells. Understanding and investigating the intrinsic regulatory mechanism of FAS is of great significance for developing novel therapies for inflammation-induced diseases.
Prostate cancer (PCa) incidence has been dramatically increasing these last years in westernized countries. Though localized PCa is usually treated by radical prostatectomy, androgen deprivation therapy is preferred in locally advanced disease in combination with chemotherapy. Unfortunately, PCa goes into a castration-resistant state in the vast majority of the cases, leading to questions about the molecular mechanisms involving the steroids and their respective nuclear receptors in this relapse. Interestingly, liver X receptors (LXRα/NR1H3 and LXRβ/NR1H2) have emerged as new actors in prostate physiology, beyond their historical roles of cholesterol sensors. More importantly LXRs have been proposed to be good pharmacological targets in PCa. This rational has been based on numerous experiments performed in PCa cell lines and genetic animal models pointing out that using selective liver X receptor modulators (SLiMs) could actually be a good complementary therapy in patients with a castration resistant PCa. Hence, this review is focused on the interaction among the androgen receptors (AR/NR3C4), estrogen receptors (ERα/NR3A1 and ERβ/NR3A2), and LXRs in prostate homeostasis and their putative pharmacological modulations in parallel to the patients' support.
Deoxypodophyllotoxin (DPT) is a naturally occurring flavolignan in Anthriscus sylvestris known as cow parsley or wild chervil, and has been reported to have inhibitory effects against several pathological processes including cancer, inflammation and infection. Here, we report the effects of DPT in the fatty liver induced by high fat diet in vivo as well as its regulatory mechanism related with the transcription factor for lipogenic genes such as sterol regulatory element binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c) in vitro. C57BL/6 mice were fed high fat diet for 10 weeks and also orally administrated with DPT for additional 4 weeks. 5 and 10 mg/kg of DPT decreased lipid accumulation in the liver induced by high fat diet, as indicated by histological parameters such as Oil Red O staining and hematoxylin &amp; eosin as well as the contents of hepatic triglyceride and cholesterol. In hepatocytes, DPT inhibited the liver X receptor α-mediated SREBP-1c induction and expression of the lipogenic genes, including fatty acid synthase, acetyl-CoA carboxylase and stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1. Moreover, DPT induced AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activation, which has been known to inhibit the expression of SREBP-1c in hepatocyte. Also this compound restored the dysregulation of AMPK and SREBP-1c induced by high fat diet in mice. In conclusion, we demonstrated that DPT significantly inhibited fatty liver by adjusting lipid metabolism coordinated with AMPK activation and SREBP-1c inhibition.
Sex differences in heart failure development following myocardial infarction (MI) are not fully understood. We hypothesized that differential MI signaling could explain variations in outcomes. Analysis of the mouse heart attack research tool 1.0 (422 mice; young = 5.4 ± 0.1; old = 23.3 ± 0.1 months of age) was used to dissect MI signaling pathways, which was validated in a new cohort of mice (4.8 ± 0.2 months of age); and substantiated in humans. Plasma collected at visit 2 from the MI subset of the Jackson Heart Study (JHS; a community-based study consisting of middle aged and older adults of African ancestry) underwent glycoproteomics grouped by outcome: (1) heart failure hospitalization after visit 2 (n = 3 men/12 women) and (2) without hospitalization through 2012 (n = 24 men/21 women). Compared to young male mice, the infarct region of young females had fewer, but more efficient tissue clearing neutrophils with reduced pro-inflammatory gene expression. Apolipoprotein (Apo) F, which acts upstream of the liver X receptors/retinoid X receptor (LXR/RXR) pathway, was elevated in the day 7 infarcts of old mice compared to young controls and was increased in both men and women with heart failure. In vitro, Apo F stimulated CD36 and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)γ activation in male neutrophils to turn off NF-κB activation and stimulate LXR/RXR signaling to initiate resolution. Female neutrophils were desensitized to Apo F and instead relied on thrombospondin-1 stimulation of CD36 to upregulate AMP-activated protein kinase, resulting in an overall better wound healing strategy. With age, female mice were desensitized to LXR/RXR signaling, resulting in enhanced interleukin-6 activation, a finding replicated in the JHS community cohort. This is the first report to uncover sex differences in post-MI neutrophil signaling that yielded better outcomes in young females and worse outcomes with age.
Reverse cholesterol transport (RCT) is a process that prevents atherosclerosis. Studies showed that exercise training for strengthening cardiac muscle, increasing heart lipid metabolism and its potency against risk factors could protect cardiovascular health. Thus, the present study aims to investigate the effects of high intensity interval training (HIIT) on RCT and its related elements in plasma and tissues (liver and intestine) of rats.
Twenty adult male Wistar rats were randomly divided into control (n = 10) and trained (n = 10) groups. The trained group undertook HIIT (90%-95% of VO2max, five days/week, for 10 weeks) on a treadmill. The rats were killed five days after the last training session to minimize the effects of the last training session.
A higher and significant ABCA1 mRNA was observed in the liver and intestine of trained rats. However, ABCG1 and LXR expressions only increased in the liver following the HIIT. These changes in the expression of the trained rats were accompanied by higher changes in plasma LCAT and HDL levels.
The responses of ABCA1, as a key player in plasma HDL biogenesis, are similar in liver and intestine tissues after the HIIT program. However, different responses of ABCG1 and LXR in the liver and intestine tissues of the trained rats confirm the main role of the liver than the intestine in HDL biogenes. Therefore, HIIT modality result in cardiovascular protection by increasing the expression of genes involved in RCT and biogenesis of HDL.
The novel neurite outgrowth inhibitor B (Nogo‑B) receptor (NgBR) is specific for Nogo‑B, which is highly expressed in various human organs and cells, including the lung, liver, kidney, smooth muscle cells, blood vessel endothelial cells and inflammatory cells. Previous studies have indicated that NgBR directly interacts with Nogo‑B and is able to independently influence lipid and cholesterol homeostasis, angiogenesis, N‑glycosylation, the epithelial-mesenchymal transition, the chemotaxis of endothelial cells and cellular proliferation and apoptosis. These multiple functions and actions of this receptor provide an understanding of the important roles of NgBR in various conditions, including fatty liver, atherosclerosis, intracranial microaneurysms, retinitis pigmentosa and severe neurological impairment. Furthermore, NgBR has been demonstrated to exert protean, multifunctional and enigmatic effects in cancer. The present review summarizes the latest knowledge on the suppressing and activating effects of NgBR, emphasizing its function in cancer. Further basic and medical research on this receptor may provide novel insight into its clinical implications on the prognosis of relevant human cancer types.
Atherosclerosis is a chronic condition associated with cardiovascular disease. While largely identified by the accumulation of lipid-laden foam cells within the aorta later on in life, atherosclerosis develops over several stages and decades. During atherogenesis, various cell types of the aorta acquire a pro-inflammatory phenotype that initiates the cascade of signaling events facilitating the formation of these foam cells. The liver X receptors (LXRs) are nuclear receptors that upon activation induce the expression of transporters responsible for promoting cholesterol efflux. In addition to promoting cholesterol removal from the arterial wall, LXRs have potent anti-inflammatory actions via the transcriptional repression of key pro-inflammatory cytokines. These beneficial functions sparked an interest in the potential to target LXRs and the development of agonists as anti-atherogenic agents. These early studies focused on mediating the contributions of macrophages to the underlying pathogenesis. However, further evidence has since demonstrated that LXRs reduce atherosclerosis through their actions in multiple cell types apart from those monocytes/macrophages that infiltrate the lesion. LXRs and their target genes have profound effects on multiple other cells types of the hematopoietic system. Furthermore, LXRs can also mediate dysfunction within vascular cell types of the aorta including endothelial and smooth muscle cells. Taken together, these studies demonstrate the whole-body benefits of LXR activation with respect to anti-atherogenesis, and that LXRs remain a viable target for the treatment of atherosclerosis, with a reach which extends beyond plaque macrophages.
Pregnane X receptor (PXR) is a ligand-dependent transcription factor that is considered to be a potential therapeutic target for multiple diseases. Herein, we report the development and structure-activity relationship studies of a new series of hPXR agonists. Focusing on our recently developed silanol-sulfonamide scaffold, we developed the potent hPXR agonist 28, which shows good selectivity over hLXRα and β, hFXR, and hRORα and γ. Examination of the structure-activity relationship suggested a possible strategy to manipulate the selectivity. Docking simulation indicated the presence of an additional binding cavity and polar contacts in the ligand-binding pocket of hPXR. This information should be helpful for the future development of more potent and selective hPXR ligands.
Heterogeneity between different macrophage populations has become a defining feature of this lineage. However, the conserved factors defining macrophages remain largely unknown. The transcription factor ZEB2 is best described for its role in epithelial to mesenchymal transition; however, its role within the immune system is only now being elucidated. We show here that Zeb2 expression is a conserved feature of macrophages. Using Clec4f-cre, Itgax-cre, and Fcgr1-cre mice to target five different macrophage populations, we found that loss of ZEB2 resulted in macrophage disappearance from the tissues, coupled with their subsequent replenishment from bone-marrow precursors in open niches. Mechanistically, we found that ZEB2 functioned to maintain the tissue-specific identities of macrophages. In Kupffer cells, ZEB2 achieved this by regulating expression of the transcription factor LXRα, removal of which recapitulated the loss of Kupffer cell identity and disappearance. Thus, ZEB2 expression is required in macrophages to preserve their tissue-specific identities.
Hepatic lipogenesis is aberrantly induced in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) via activation of the LXR-SREBP1c pathway. To date, a number of protein factors impinging on the transcriptional activity of LXR and SREBP1c have been elucidated. However, whether this regulatory axis interfaces with long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) remains largely unexplored. Here we show that hepatic expression of the lncRNA Blnc1 is strongly elevated in obesity and NAFLD in mice. Blnc1 is required for the induction of SREBP1c and hepatic lipogenic genes in response to LXR activation. Liver-specific inactivation of Blnc1 abrogates high-fat diet-induced hepatic steatosis and insulin resistance and protects mice from diet-induced nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. Proteomic analysis of the Blnc1 ribonucleoprotein complex identified EDF1 as a component of the LXR transcriptional complex that acts in concert with Blnc1 to activate the lipogenic gene program. These findings illustrate a lncRNA transcriptional checkpoint that licenses excess hepatic lipogenesis to exacerbate insulin resistance and NAFLD.
Cholesterol is essential for numerous biologic functions and processes, but an excess of intracellular cholesterol can be toxic. Intestinal cholesterol absorption is a major determinant of plasma cholesterol level. The liver X receptor (LXR) is a nuclear receptor known for its activity in cholesterol efflux and reverse cholesterol transport. In this study, we uncovered a surprising function of LXR in intestinal cholesterol absorption and toxicity. Genetic or pharmacologic activation of LXRα-sensitized mice to a high-cholesterol diet (HCD) induced intestinal toxicity and tissue damage, including the disruption of enterocyte tight junctions, whereas the same HCD caused little toxicity in the absence of LXR activation. The gut toxicity in HCD-fed LXR-KI mice may have been accounted for by the increased intestinal cholesterol absorption and elevation of enterocyte and systemic levels of free cholesterol. The increased intestinal cholesterol absorption preceded the gut toxicity, suggesting that the increased absorption was not secondary to tissue damage. The heightened sensitivity to HCD in the HCD-fed LXRα-activated mice appeared to be intestine-specific because the liver was not affected despite activation of the same receptor in this tissue. Moreover, heightened sensitivity to HCD cannot be reversed by ezetimibe, a Niemann-Pick C1-like 1 inhibitor that inhibits intestinal cholesterol absorption, suggesting that the increased cholesterol absorption in LXR-activated intestine is mediated by a mechanism that has yet to be defined.
A close relationship exists between cholesterol and female reproductive physiology. Indeed, cholesterol is crucial for steroid synthesis by ovary and placenta, and primordial for cell structure during folliculogenesis. Furthermore, oxysterols, cholesterol-derived ligands, play a potential role in oocyte maturation. Anomalies of cholesterol metabolism are frequently linked to infertility. However, little is known about the molecular mechanisms. In parallel, increasing evidence describing the biological roles of liver X receptors (LXRs) in the regulation of steroid synthesis and inflammation, two processes necessary for follicle maturation and ovulation. Both of the isoforms of LXRs and their bona fide ligands are present in the ovary. LXR-deficient mice develop late sterility due to abnormal oocyte maturation and increased oocyte atresia. These mice also have an ovarian hyper stimulation syndrome in response to gonadotropin stimulation. Hence, further studies are necessary to explore their specific roles in oocyte, granulosa, and theca cells. LXRs also modulate estrogen signaling and this could explain the putative protective role of the LXRs in breast cancer growth. Altogether, clinical studies would be important for determining the physiological relevance of LXRs in reproductive disorders in women.
Clinical studies showed that intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR) neonatus had lower cholesterol concentrations in cord blood, which might be associated with increased risk of metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular diseases in adulthood. We previously observed lower blood cholesterol levels in prenatal nicotine exposure (PNE)-induced IUGR fetal rats, and this study aimed to elucidate the placental mechanism. Pregnant Wistar rats were subcutaneously injected with nicotine (2.0 mg/kg⋅d) on gestational day 9-20. In vivo, PNE increased levels of total cholesterol (TCH), high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C) and low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) in maternal serum, while decreased levels of TCH and LDL-C in female fetal serum. Meanwhile, the expression of scavenger receptor class B type 1 (SR-B1), ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) and ATP-binding cassette transporter G1 (ABCG1) were decreased, and the expression of liver X receptor (LXR) α and β were also decreased in female placentas. In vitro, nicotine (0.1-10 μM) reduced the expression of LXRα, LXRβ, SR-B1, ABCA1 and ABCG1 in a concentration dependent manner, which could be annulled by nAChR antagonist and LXR agonist. Taken together, nicotine could inhibit the expression of SR-B1, ABCA1 and ABCG1 via nAChR and LXR α/β in female placentas, finally leading to reduced blood cholesterol levels in fetal rats.
This study was designed to select potent cholesterol-lowering probiotic strains on HepG2 cell and investigate the effect of selected strain, Lactobacillus plantarum LRCC 5273 and LRCC 5279 in hypercholesterolemic mice. In the results, LP5273 group showed significantly reduced total and LDL cholesterol compared to HCD group. In addition to significantly up-regulated hepatic mRNA expression of LXR-α and CYP7A1, intestinal LXR-α and ABCG5 were significantly up-regulated in LP5273 group. With activation of hepatic and intestinal LXR-α and its target genes, fecal cholesterol and bile acid excretion were increased in LP5273 fed mice. These results suggest that LP5273 ameliorates hypercholesterolemia in mice through the activation of hepatic and intestinal LXR-α, resulting in enhancement of fecal cholesterol and bile acids excretion in the small intestine. The results of present study suggest mechanistic evidences for hypocholesterolemic effects of L. plantarum spp., and may contribute to future researches for prevention of hypercholesterolemia and cardiovascular disease.
Liver-X-receptors (LXRs) are ligand-activated transcription factors belonging to the nuclear receptor superfamily. The two popular homologous receptor subtypes, LXRα and LXRβ, exhibit differential expression patterns, thereby probably playing different roles in different contexts. This study aimed to evaluate the different roles of the two LXR subtypes and the mechanisms underlying their protection of cardiomyocytes against high-glucose stress. Silencing of LXRα, but not LXRβ impaired normal LXR-mediated cardioprotective effects against high glucose-induced oxidative stress, apoptosis, and inflammation. Mechanistically, silencing of small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO)1 or SUMO2/3 did not affect LXR-mediated cardioprotective effects; however, these were impaired in response to nuclear receptor corepressor (NCoR) silencing. Together, these findings indicate that LXRα, but not LXRβ, protects against high glucose-induced cardiomyocyte injury, probably via the NCoR-dependent transrepression of downstream target genes.
Nuclear receptors (NRs) are considered as potential drug targets because they control diverse biological functions. However, steroidal ligands for NRs have the potential to cross-react with other nuclear receptors, so development of non-steroidal NR ligands is desirable to obtain safer agents for clinical use. We anticipated that efficient lead finding and enhancement of activity toward nuclear receptors recognizing endogenous steroidal ligands might be achieved by exhaustive evaluation of a steroid surrogate library coupled with examination of structure-activity relationships (SAR).
We evaluated our library of RORs (retinoic acid receptor-related orphan receptors) inverse agonists and/or PR (progesterone receptor) antagonists based on the phenanthridinone skeleton for antagonistic activities toward liver X receptors (LXRs), androgen receptor (AR) and glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and examined their SAR.
Potent LXRβ, AR, and GR antagonists were identified. SAR studies led to a potent AR antagonist (IC50: 0.059 μM).
Our approach proved effective for efficient lead finding, activity enhancement and preliminary control of selectivity over other receptors. The phenanthridinone skeleton appears to be a promising steroid surrogate.
Gammaherpesviruses are oncogenic pathogens that persist in ~95% of the adult population. Cellular metabolic pathways have emerged as important regulators of many viral infections, including infections by gammaherpesviruses that require several lipid synthetic pathways for optimal replication. Liver X receptors (LXRs) are transcription factors that are critical regulators of cellular fatty acid and cholesterol synthesis pathways. Not surprisingly, LXRs are attractive therapeutic targets in cardiovascular disease. Here we describe an antiviral role for LXRs in the context of gammaherpesvirus infection of primary macrophages. We show that type I interferon increased LXR expression following infection. Surprisingly, there was not a corresponding induction of LXR target genes. Rather, LXRs suppressed the expression of target genes, leading to decreased fatty acid and cholesterol synthesis, two metabolic pathways that support gammaherpesvirus replication. This report defines LXR-mediated restriction of cholesterol and lipid synthesis as an intrinsic metabolic mechanism to restrict viral replication in innate immune cells.IMPORTANCE Fatty acid and cholesterol synthesis pathways of the host play important roles in diverse biological systems. Importantly, these two metabolic pathways are also usurped by a number of viruses to facilitate viral replication. In this report, we show that suppression of these pathways by liver X receptors in primary macrophages creates an intrinsic antiviral state that attenuates gammaherpesvirus replication by limiting viral access to the two metabolic pathways.
Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most diagnosed cancer in the western world, affecting 1 out of approximately 22 people in their lifetime. Several epidemiological studies suggest a positive association between high plasma cholesterol levels and colorectal cancer. However, the molecular mechanisms by which cholesterol may alter the risk of colorectal cancer (CRC) are ill-defined as the cholesterol lowering drugs statins do not appear to decrease a patient's risk of developing colorectal cancer. Cholesterol is metabolized to active derivatives including cholesterol oxidization products (COP), known as oxysterols, which have been shown to alter cellular proliferation. These metabolites and not cholesterol per se, may therefore affect the risk of developing colorectal cancer. The cholesterol metabolite or the oxysterol 27-hydroxycholesterol (27-OHC) is the most abundant oxysterol in the plasma and has been shown to be involved in the pathogenesis of several cancers including breast and prostate cancer. However, the role of 27-OHC in colorectal cancer has not been investigated. We treated Caco2 and SW620, two well characterized colon cancer cells with low, physiological and high concentrations of 27-OHC, and found that 27-OHC reduces cellular proliferation in these cells. We also found that the effects of 27-OHC on cell proliferation are not due to cellular cytotoxicity or apoptotic cellular death. Additionally, 27-OHC-induced reduction in cell proliferation is independent of actions on its target nuclear receptors, liver-X-receptors (LXR) and estrogen receptors (ER) activation. Instead, our study demonstrates that 27-OHC significantly decreases AKT activation, a major protein kinase involved in the pathogenesis of cancer as it regulates cell cycle progression, protein synthesis, and cellular survival. Our data shows that treatment with 27-OHC substantially decreases the activation of AKT by reducing levels of its active form, p-AKT, in Caco2 cells but not SW620 cells. All-together, our results show for the first time that the cholesterol metabolite 27-OHC reduces cell proliferation in colorectal cancer cells.
Involvement of high cholesterol and oxidative stress in cardiovascular diseases is well studied, as it can be hypothesized that various products originated from lipid peroxidation, such as oxysterols, or affected protein expression might lead to cardiomyocyte damage followed by the pathological modifications. Although oxidation of excessive cholesterol to oxysterols in elevated stress conditions is identified by a number of studies, the role of a high cholesterol diet in regulating fatty acid and oxysterol accumulation, together with scavenger receptor mRNA levels, in the heart remains little investigated. Our study provides a detailed analysis of the changes in fatty acid, oxysterol, and scavenger receptor profiles and its relation with histological alterations in the heart tissue. We evaluated alterations of fatty acid composition, by the GC-MS method, while 4β-, 25-, and 27-hydroxycholesterol and 7-ketocholesterol levels by means of LC-MS/MS in high cholesterol diet-fed rabbits. Additionally, a number of proteins related to lipid metabolism and scavenger receptor mRNA expressions were evaluated by Western blotting and RT-PCR. According to our in vivo results, a high cholesterol diet enhances a number of unsaturated fatty acids, oxysterols, and LXRα, in addition to CD36, CD68, CD204, and SR-F1 expressions while α-tocopherol supplementation decreases LXRα and SR expressions together with an increase in 27-hydroxycholesterol and ABCA1 levels. Our results indicated that the high cholesterol diet modulates proteins related to lipid metabolism, which might result in the malfunction of the heart and α-tocopherol shows its beneficial effects. We believe that this work will lead the generation of different theories in the development of heart diseases.
Nuclear hormone receptors represent a large family of ligand-activated transcription factors that include steroid receptors, thyroid/retinoid receptors, and orphan receptors. Among nuclear hormone receptors, the liver X receptors have emerged as very important drug targets. These receptors regulate some of the most important metabolic functions, and they were also identified as anti-inflammatory transcription factors and regulators of the immune system. The development of drugs targeting liver X receptors continues to be a challenge, but advances in our knowledge of receptor structure and function move us forward, toward achieving this goal. This review highlights the latest advances in the development of synthetic LXR modulators in the primary literature from 2013 to 2017. In this review, we place great emphasis on the structure and function of LXRs because of their essential role in the drug design process. The structure-activity relationships of the most active and promising synthetic modulators are discussed.

Atherosclerosis is a process of imbalanced lipid metabolism in the vascular walls. The underlying pathology mainly involves the deposition of oxidized lipids in the endothelium and the accumulation of cholesterol in macrophages. Macrophages export excessive cholesterol (cholesterol efflux) through ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) to counter the progression of atherosclerosis. We synthesized novel chalcone derivatives and assessed their effects and the underlying mechanisms on ABCA1 expression in macrophages. Human THP-1 macrophages were treated with synthetic chalcone derivatives for 24 h. In Western blot and flow cytometry analyses, a chalcone derivative, (E)-1-(3,4-diisopropoxyphenyl)-3-(4-isopropoxy-3-methoxyphenyl)prop- 2-en-1-one (1m), was observed to significantly enhance ABCA1 protein expression in THP-1 cells (10 &amp;micro;M, 24 h). Levels of mRNA of ABCA1 and liver X receptor alpha (LXR&amp;alpha;) were quantified using a real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction technique and were found to be significantly increased after treatment with the novel chalcone derivative 1m. Several microRNAs, including miR155, miR758, miR10b, miR145, miR33, and miR106b, which functionally inhibit ABCA1 expression were suppressed after treatment with 1m. Collectively, 1m increases ABCA1 expression in human THP-1 macrophages. The mechanisms involve the activation of the LXR&amp;alpha;-ABCA1 pathway and suppression of certain microRNAs that regulate ABCA1 expression.
In obesity, elevated insulin causes fatty liver by activating the gene encoding SREBP-1c, a transcription factor that enhances fatty acid synthesis. Two transcription factors, LXRα and C/EBPβ, are necessary but not sufficient for insulin induction of hepatic SREBP-1c mRNA. Here, we show that a third transcription factor, BHLHE40, is required. Immunoprecipitation revealed that BHLHE40 binds to C/EBPβ and LXRα in livers of rats that had fasted and then refed. Hepatic BHLHE40 mRNA rises rapidly when fasted rats are refed and when rat hepatocytes are incubated with insulin. Preventing this rise by gene knockout in mice or siRNAs in hepatocytes reduces the insulin-induced rise in SREBP-1c mRNA. Although BHLHE40 is necessary for insulin induction of SREBP-1c, it is not sufficient as demonstrated by failure of lentiviral BHLHE40 overexpression to increase hepatocyte SREBP-1c mRNA in the absence of insulin. Thus, an additional event is required for insulin to increase SREBP-1c mRNA.
In the present study, we used the human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) to investigate the anti-inflammatory effects and mechanism of taraxasterol on vascular inflammation. HUVECs were pre-treated with taraxasterol 1 h before lipopolysaccharide (LPS) treatment. The concentrations of TNF-α, IL-8, PGE2, and NO were measured. The expression of VCAM-1, ICAM-1, iNOS, COX-2, NF-κB, and LXRα was detected by western blot analysis. The results showed that taraxasterol not only reduced the production of TNF-α, IL-8, PGE2, and NO induced by LPS, but also reduced the expression of iNOS and COX-2. Taraxasterol also suppressed LPS-induced NF-κB activation and VCAM-1 and ICAM-1 expression. Furthermore, taraxasterol concentration-dependently increased the expression of LXRα. The inhibition of taraxasterol on TNF-α, IL-8, PGE2, and NO production can be reversed by geranylgeranyl diphosphate (GGPP, the LXRα inhibitor). Here, we found that taraxasterol inhibited vascular inflammation through activating LXRα.
Macrophages are key immune cells for the initiation and development of atherosclerotic lesions. However, the macrophage regulatory nodes that determine how lesions progress in response to dietary challenges are not fully understood. Liver X receptors (LXRs) are sterol-regulated transcription factors that play a central role in atherosclerosis by integrating cholesterol homeostasis and immunity. LXR pharmacological activation elicits a robust antiatherosclerotic transcriptional program in macrophages that can be affected by LXRα S196 phosphorylation in vitro. To investigate the impact of these transcriptional changes in atherosclerosis development, we have generated mice carrying a Ser-to-Ala mutation in myeloid cells in the LDL receptor (LDLR)-deficient atherosclerotic background (M-S196ALdlr-KO). M-S196ALdlr-KO mice fed a high-fat diet exhibit increased atherosclerotic plaque burden and lesions with smaller necrotic cores and thinner fibrous caps. These diet-induced phenotypic changes are consistent with a reprogramed macrophage transcriptome promoted by LXRα-S196A during atherosclerosis development. Remarkably, expression of several proliferation-promoting factors, including the protooncogene FoxM1 and its targets, is induced by LXRα-S196A. This is consistent with increased proliferation of plaque-resident cells in M-S196ALdlr-KO mice. Moreover, disrupted LXRα phosphorylation increases expression of phagocytic molecules, resulting in increased apoptotic cell removal by macrophages, explaining the reduced necrotic cores. Finally, the macrophage transcriptome promoted by LXRα-S196A under dietary perturbation is markedly distinct from that revealed by LXR ligand activation, highlighting the singularity of this posttranslational modification. Overall, our findings demonstrate that LXRα phosphorylation at S196 is an important determinant of atherosclerotic plaque development through selective changes in gene transcription that affect multiple pathways.
Ginseng is widely used in energy drinks, dietary supplements, and herbal medicines, and its pharmacological actions are related with energy metabolism. As an important modulating energy metabolism pathway, liver X receptors (LXRs) can promote the resolving of hepatic fibrosis and inflammation. The present study aims to evaluate the regulation of 25-OCH3-PPD, a ginsenoside isolated from Panax ginseng, against hepatic fibrosis and inflammation in thioacetamide (TAA)-stimulated mice by activating the LXRs pathway. 25-OCH3-PPD decreases serum ALT/AST levels and improves the histological pathology of liver in TAA-induced mice; attenuates transcripts of pro-fibrogenic markers associated with hepatic stellate cell activation; attenuates the levels of pro-Inflammatory cytokines and blocks apoptosis happened in liver; inhibits NLRP3 inflammasome by affecting P2X7R activation; and regulates PI3K/Akt and LKB1/AMPK-SIRT1. 25-OCH3-PPD also facilitates LX25Rs and FXR activities decreased by TAA stimulation. 25-OCH3-PPD also decreases α-SMA via regulation of LXRs and P2X7R-NLRP3 in vitro. Our data suggest the possibility that 25-OCH3-PPD promotes activity of LXRs to ameliorate P2X7R-mediated NLRP3 inflammasome in the development of hepatic fibrosis.
The liver X receptors (LXRs) are members of the nuclear receptor superfamily. The activated LXRs have a variety of biological functions, for instance they can not only regulate the metabolism of cholesterol, fatty acids and glucose, but also play an important role in immune inflammatory response. Massive studies have shown that LXRs are involved in the occurrence and progress of inflammatory-related diseases, and can inhibit the inflammation of some inflammatory-related diseases in the nervous system, the respiratory system, and the cardiovascular system. In this review, we summarized the recent progress regarding LXRs in inflammatory-related diseases, including the structure, function and anti-inflammatory mechanism of LXRs, in order to provide new methods for preventing and treating inflammatory-related diseases.
The liver X receptors (LXRs), LXRα and LXRβ, are nuclear receptors that regulate lipid homeostasis. LXRs also regulate inflammatory responses in cultured macrophages. However, the role of LXRs in hepatic immune cells remains poorly characterized. We investigated the role of LXRs in regulation of inflammatory responses of hepatic mononuclear cells (MNCs) in mice. Both LXRα and LXRβ were expressed in mouse hepatic MNCs and F4/80+ Kupffer cells/macrophages. LXRα/β-knockout (KO) mice had an increased number of hepatic MNCs and elevated expression of macrophage surface markers and inflammatory cytokines compared to wild-type (WT) mice. Among MNCs, F4/80+CD11b+ cells, not F4/80+CD11b- or F4/80+CD68+ cells, were increased in LXRα/β-KO mice more than WT mice. Isolated hepatic MNCs and F4/80+CD11b+ cells of LXRα/β-KO mice showed enhanced production of inflammatory cytokines after stimulation by lipopolysaccharide or CpG-DNA compared to WT cells, and LXR ligand treatment suppressed lipopolysaccharide-induced cytokine expression in hepatic MNCs. Lipopolysaccharide administration also stimulated inflammatory cytokine production in LXRα/β-KO mice more effectively than WT mice. Thus, LXR deletion enhances recruitment of F4/80+CD11b+ Kupffer cells/macrophages and acute immune responses in the liver. LXRs regulate the Kupffer cell/macrophage population and innate immune and inflammatory responses in mouse liver.
Liver X receptors α and β (LXRα and LXRβ) are nuclear receptors with pivotal roles in the transcriptional control of lipid metabolism. Transcriptional activity of LXRs is induced in response to elevated cellular levels of cholesterol. LXRs bind to and regulate the expression of genes that encode proteins involved in cholesterol absorption, transport, efflux, excretion and conversion to bile acids. The coordinated, tissue-specific actions of the LXR pathway maintain systemic cholesterol homeostasis and regulate immune and inflammatory responses. LXRs also regulate fatty acid metabolism by controlling the lipogenic transcription factor sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1c and regulate genes that encode proteins involved in fatty acid elongation and desaturation. LXRs exert important effects on the metabolism of phospholipids, which, along with cholesterol, are major constituents of cellular membranes. LXR activation preferentially drives the incorporation of polyunsaturated fatty acids into phospholipids by inducing transcription of the remodelling enzyme lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase 3. The ability of the LXR pathway to couple cellular sterol levels with the saturation of fatty acids in membrane phospholipids has implications for several physiological processes, including lipoprotein production, dietary lipid absorption and intestinal stem cell proliferation. Understanding how LXRs regulate membrane composition and function might provide new therapeutic insight into diseases associated with dysregulated lipid metabolism, including atherosclerosis, diabetes mellitus and cancer.
Activating Liver X receptors (LXRs) represents a promising therapeutic option for dyslipidemia. However, activating LXRα may cause undesired lipogenic effects. Discovery of highly LXRβ-selective agonists without LXRα activation were indispensable for dyslipidemia. In this study, in silico approaches were applied to develop highly potent LXRβ-selective agonists based on a series of newly reported 3-(4-(2-propylphenoxy)butyl)imidazolidine-2,4-dione-based LXRα/β dual agonists. Initially, Kohonen and stepwise multiple linear regression SW-MLR were performed to construct models for LXRβ agonists and LXRα agonists based on the structural characteristics of LXRα/β dual agonists, respectively. The obtained LXRβ agonist model gave a good predictive ability (R²train = 0.837, R²test = 0.843, Q²LOO = 0.715), and the LXRα agonist model produced even better predictive ability (R²train = 0.968, R²test = 0.914, Q²LOO = 0.895). Also, the two QSAR models were independent and can well distinguish LXRβ and LXRα activity. Then, compounds in the ZINC database met the lower limit of structural similarity of 0.7, compared to the 3-(4-(2-propylphenoxy)butyl)imidazolidine-2,4-dione scaffold subjected to our QSAR models, which resulted in the discovery of ZINC55084484 with an LXRβ prediction value of pEC50 equal to 7.343 and LXRα prediction value of pEC50 equal to -1.901. Consequently, nine newly designed compounds were proposed as highly LXRβ-selective agonists based on ZINC55084484 and molecular docking, of which LXRβ prediction values almost exceeded 8 and LXRα prediction values were below 0.
Curcumin is a natural polyphenol with beneficial effects on NAFLD patients and NAFLD is accompanied by metabolism decompensation.
This study was focused on the effect of curcumin on the relationship between endogenous bile acids metabolism pathway and exogenous xenobiotics metabolism pathway in C57BL/6 mice of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease induced by high-fat and high-fructose diet (HFHFr) and in cultured mice hepatocytes.
Our results showed curcumin treatment apparently attenuated the hepatic steatosis and reversed the abnormalities of serum biochemical parameters in HFHFr-fed mice. Curcumin effectively reversed the expression of CYP3A and CYP7A in fatty liver status to restore metabolism capability. In the meantime, lipid synthesis has been controlled by curcumin, evidenced by the expression of CD36, SREBP-1c and FAS. Further, FXR, SHP and Nrf2 expressions were remarkably dropped in HFHFr-fed mice and LXRα expression was significantly enhanced, while curcumin treatment was quite effective to restore this pathway. In addition, LXRα antagonist GGPP pretreatment weakened the curcumin effects on CYP3A, CYP7A and SREBP-1c.
These findings indicate that the Nrf2/FXR/LXRα pathway might synergistically regulate both endogenous and exogenous metabolism in NAFLD mice and LXRα may be a novel therapeutic target of curcumin for the prevention and treatment of NAFLD.
The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of capsaicinoids (CAPs) on lipid metabolism, inflammation, antioxidant status and the changes in gene products involved in these metabolic functions in exercised rats. A total of 28 male Wistar albino rats were randomly divided into four groups (n = 7) (i) No exercise and no CAPs, (ii) No exercise + CAPs (iii) Regular exercise, (iv) Regular exercise + CAPs. Rats were administered as 0.2 mg capsaicinoids from 10 mg/kg BW/day Capsimax® daily for 8 weeks. A significant decrease in lactate and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels and increase in activities of antioxidant enzymes were observed in the combination of regular exercise and CAPs group (P &lt; 0.0001). Regular exercise + CAPs treated rats had greater nuclear factor-E2-related factor-2 (Nrf2) and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) levels in muscle than regular exercise and no exercise rats (P &lt; 0.001). Nevertheless, regular exercise + CAPs treated had lower nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) and IL-10 levels in muscle than regular exercise and control rats (P &lt; 0.001). Muscle sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1c (SREBP-1c), liver X receptors (LXR), ATP citrate lyase (ACLY) and fatty acid synthase (FAS) levels in the regular exercise + CAPs group were lower than all groups (P &lt; 0.05). However, muscle PPAR-γ level was higher in the regular exercise and CAPs alone than the no exercise rats. These results suggest CAPs with regular exercise may enhance lipid metabolism by regulation of gene products involved in lipid and antioxidant metabolism including SREBP-1c, PPAR-γ, and Nrf2 pathways in rats.
Migration and homing of dendritic cells (DCs) to lymphoid organs are quite crucial for T cell-induced immune response against tumor. However, tumor microenvironment can make some tumor cells escape immune response by impairing DC migration. Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) plays important roles in initiating and terminating inflammatory responses. In this study, we investigated whether PGE2 could inhibit murine prostate cancer progression by countervailing tumor microenvironment-induced impairment of dendritic cell migration. We found that murine prostate cancer cell line RM-1-conditioned medium impaired chemotactic movement of marrow-derived DCs and splenic cDCs toward CC chemokine receptor-7 (CCR7) ligand CCL19 in vitro and migration to draining lymph gland in vivo. Meanwhile, it also induced LXRα activation and CCR7 inhibition on maturing DCs. However, the treatment of PGE2 rescued this impairment of DC migration with upregulation of CCR7 and inhibition of LXRα. Further, it was observed that PGE2 also increased MMP9 expression and activated Notch1 signaling on DCs. In RM-1-bearing mouse model, PGE2 treatment was identified to inhibit tumor growth and induce more tumor-infiltrating T cells and CD11c dendritic cells in tumor sites. Therefore, our findings may demonstrate a new perspective for therapeutic interventions on prostate cancer immunoescape.
Quercetin is a flavonoid that has anti‑inflammatory, anti‑oxidant and lipid metabolic effects. It has also been reported to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease. The present study measured the effects of quercetin on the expression of ATP‑binding cassette transporter 1 (ABCAl), ATP‑binding cassette sub‑family G member 1 (ABCG1), liver X receptor‑α (LXR‑α), proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9), p53, p21 and p16 induced by oxidized low density lipoprotein (ox‑LDL). RAW264.7 macrophages were exposed to ox‑LDL with or without 20 µmol/l quercetin and cell proliferation and senescence were quantified using β‑gal staining. Superoxide dismutase (SOD), malondialdehyde (MDA) and lipid droplets were measured in the cytoplasm using oil red staining, while intracellular and total cholesterol (TC) were measured using filipin staining and a TC kit. Immunofluorescent studies and western blot analysis were performed to quantify the expression of ABCAl, ABCG1, LXR‑α, PCSK9, p53, p21 and p16. Quercetin increased RAW264.7 cell viability and reduced lipid accumulation, senescence, lipid droplets, intracellular cholesterol and TC. It was concluded that quercetin inhibits ox‑LDL‑induced lipid droplets in RAW264.7 cells by upregulation of ABCAl, ABCG1, LXR‑α and downregulation of PCSK9, p53, p21 and p16.
7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene(DMBA), a PAH derivative initializes cascades of signaling events that alters a variety of enzymes responsible for lipid and glucose homeostasis resulting in enhanced availability and consumption of energy producing molecules for the development of carcinogenesis. 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (HMG-CoAR) is a key enzyme regulating the pathway of synthesis of cholesterol whereas liver-X-receptor (LXR) regulates lipid, carbohydrate metabolism in various malignancies including mammary carcinogenesis (MC). In this study Taxifolin (TAX), a potential flavanoid has been subjected to evaluate its anti-cancer potential on (MC).
We designed to screen the molecular docking analysis of TAX on LXRα, LXRβ, HMG-CoAR, mTOR and PTEN using MAESTRO tool comparing with their reference ligands. MC was developed by the administration of DMBA in the air pouch (under the mammary fat pad) of the female Sprague-Dawley rats (55 days old). After 90 days of cancer induction, the chemotherapeutic potential of TAX was evaluated by administering TAX at different doses (10, 20 and 40 mg/kg b.w./day). Then western blot and RT-qPCR analysis were performed for determination of the protein and mRNA expressions respectively.
The docking analysis revealed significant interaction with LXR (α&amp;β), HMG-CoAR, mTOR and PTEN. The docking results were validated with the enzyme inhibition assay using HMG-CoAR (EC 1.1.1.34). TAX inhibited the HMG-CoAR activity with an IC50 value of 97.54 ± 2.5 nM whereas the reference molecule pavastatin revealed an IC50 value of 84.35 ± 1.2 nM. Moreover, TAX modulated the energy regulation on DMBA-induced MC in SD-rats by significantly restoring the cancer-induced alterations in body weight, tumor growth and lipid, lipoproteins, lipid metabolizing enzymes and glycolytic enzymes. TAX interacted with LXRs, HMG-CoAR, metabolic enzymes and restored the altered metabolism that accelerates uncontrolled cell proliferation in MC. Moreover, TAX also altered the mRNA and protein expressions of HMG-CoAR, LXR (α,β), Maf1, PTEN, phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), Akt, mTOR, fatty acid synthase (FASN) and acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1 (ACC1) in a dose dependent manner.
These results validate the anti-cancer potential of TAX in DMBA-induced MC through LXR-mTOR/Maf1/PTEN axis.
Trans-10,cis-12 conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) has been identified as an intermediate of rumen fatty acid biohydrogenation that caused milk fat depression (MFD) in the dairy cow. Previous studies in cows experiencing CLA- and diet-induced MFD have identified reduced mammary expression of the master lipogenic regulator sterol response element transcription factor 1 (SREBF1) and many of its dependent genes. To distinguish between primary mechanisms regulating milk fat synthesis and secondary adaptations to the reduction in milk fat, we conducted a time-course experiment. Eleven dairy cows received by abomasal infusion an initial priming dose of 6.25 g of CLA followed by 12.5 g/d delivered in multiple pulses per day for 5 d. Cows were milked 3×/d and mammary biopsies were obtained under basal condition (prebolus control) and 12, 30, and 120 h relative to initiation of CLA infusion. Milk fat concentration and yield decreased progressively reaching a nadir at 69 h (1.82% and 38.2 g/h) and averaged 2.03 ± 0.19% and 42.1 ± 4.10 g/h on the last day of treatment (±standard deviation). Expression of fatty acid synthase (FASN) and lipoprotein lipase (LPL) were decreased at 30 and 120 h compared with control. Expression of SREBF1 and THRSP were also decreased at 30 and 120 h compared with control. Additionally, we failed to observe changes in other factors, including peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ and liver × receptor β and milk fat globular membrane proteins, during CLA treatment. However, expression of milk fat globular membrane proteins were decreased after 14 d of diet-induced MFD in samples from a previous experiment, indicating a possible long-term response. The rapid decrease in lipogenic enzymes, SREBF1, and THRSP provide strong support for their transcriptional regulation as a primary mechanism of milk fat depression.
Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is associated with excessive oxidative stress which may affect placental vascular function. Cholesterol homeostasis is crucial for maintaining fetoplacental endothelial function. We aimed to investigate whether and how GDM affects cholesterol metabolism in human fetoplacental endothelial cells (HPEC). HPEC were isolated from fetal term placental arterial vessels of GDM or control subjects. Cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) were detected by H2DCFDA fluorescent dye. Oxysterols were quantified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis. Genes and proteins involved in cholesterol homeostasis were detected by real-time PCR and immunoblotting, respectively. Cholesterol efflux was determined from [3H]-cholesterol labeled HPEC and [14C]-acetate was used as cholesterol precursor to measure cholesterol biosynthesis and esterification. We detected enhanced formation of ROS and of specific, ROS-derived oxysterols in HPEC isolated from GDM versus control pregnancies. ROS-generated oxysterols were simultaneously elevated in cord blood of GDM neonates. Liver-X receptor activation in control HPEC by synthetic agonist TO901319, 7-ketocholesterol, or 7β-hydroxycholesterol upregulated ATP-binding cassette transporters (ABC)A1 and ABCG1 expression, accompanied by increased cellular cholesterol efflux. Upregulation of ABCA1 and ABCG1 and increased cholesterol release to apoA-I and HDL3 (78 ± 17%, 40 ± 9%, respectively) were also observed in GDM versus control HPEC. The LXR antagonist GGPP reversed ABCA1 and ABCG1 upregulation and reduced the increased cholesterol efflux in GDM HPEC. Similar total cellular cholesterol levels were detected in control and GDM HPEC, while GDM enhanced cholesterol biosynthesis along with upregulated 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase (HMGCR) and sterol O-acyltransferase 1 (SOAT1) mRNA and protein levels. Our results suggest that in GDM cellular cholesterol homeostasis in the fetoplacental endothelium is modulated via LXR activation and helps to maintain its proper functionality.
In this issue, Ma et al. (https://doi.org/10.1084/jem.20171576) show that removal of cholesterol from CD8 T cells during type 9 differentiation increases their IL-9 production, persistence in vivo, and cytolytic function against tumors by preventing SUMOylation of liver X receptors.
Oxysterols, oxygenated derivatives of cholesterol, are formed in the human body or ingested. Experimental evidence suggests that due to their diverse functions, e.g. modulating the activity of receptors such as liver X receptors, oxysterol-binding and metabolizing proteins, and several ATP binding cassette transporters, oxysterols may contribute to a number of human disorders including cancer. Genetic variability of oxysterol pathways represents another side of this process, affecting carcinogenesis and cancer progression. This review summarizes information about both the physiological role of oxysterol pathway genes and observed associations between their genetic variability and cancer incidence, progression, and therapy outcome. Besides candidate gene studies, results of genome-wide association studies are presented as well. The survey of available data shows some potential genetic biomarkers that, if clinically validated, may allow the stratification of individuals into genetically defined groups for prediction of individual cancer risk and subsequent screening strategies for early diagnosis.
CD8+ T cells can be polarized into IL-9-secreting (Tc9) cells. We previously showed that adoptive therapy using tumor-specific Tc9 cells generated stronger antitumor responses in mouse melanoma than classical Tc1 cells. To understand why Tc9 cells exert stronger antitumor responses, we used gene profiling to compare Tc9 and Tc1 cells. Tc9 cells expressed different levels of cholesterol synthesis and efflux genes and possessed significantly lower cholesterol content than Tc1 cells. Unique to Tc9, but not other CD8+ or CD4+ T cell subsets, manipulating cholesterol content in polarizing Tc9 cells significantly affected IL-9 expression and Tc9 differentiation and antitumor response in vivo. Mechanistic studies showed that IL-9 was indispensable for Tc9 cell persistence and antitumor effects, and cholesterol or its derivatives inhibited IL-9 expression by activating liver X receptors (LXRs), leading to LXR Sumoylation and reduced p65 binding to Il9 promoter. Our study identifies cholesterol as a critical regulator of Tc9 cell differentiation and function.
The liver X receptors (LXRs; α/β) are nuclear receptors known to regulate cholesterol homeostasis and the production of select hematopoietic populations. The objective of this study was to determine the importance of LXRs and a high-fat high-cholesterol diet on global hematopoiesis, with special emphasis on endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs), a vasoreparative cell type that is derived from bone marrow hematopoietic stem cells.
Wild-type and LXR double-knockout (Lxrαβ 
                        -/-
                     ) mice were fed a Western diet (WD) to increase plasma cholesterol levels. In WD-fed Lxrαβ 
                        -/-
                     mice, flow cytometry and complete blood cell counts revealed that hematopoietic stem cells, a myeloid progenitor, and mature circulating myeloid cells were increased; EPC numbers were significantly decreased. Hematopoietic stem cells from WD-fed Lxrαβ 
                        -/-
                     mice showed increased cholesterol content, along with increased myeloid colony formation compared with chow-fed mice. In contrast, EPCs from WD-fed Lxrαβ 
                        -/-
                     mice also demonstrated increased cellular cholesterol content that was associated with greater expression of the endothelial lineage markers Cd144 and Vegfr2, suggesting accelerated differentiation of the EPCs. Treatment of human umbilical vein endothelial cells with conditioned medium collected from these EPCs increased THP-1 monocyte adhesion. Increased monocyte adhesion to conditioned medium-treated endothelial cells was recapitulated with conditioned medium from Lxrαβ 
                        -/-
                     EPCs treated with cholesterol ex vivo, suggesting cholesterol is the main component of the WD inducing EPC dysfunction.
LXRs are crucial for maintaining the balance of hematopoietic cells in a hypercholesterolemic environment and for mitigating the negative effects of cholesterol on EPC differentiation/secretome changes that promote monocyte-endothelial adhesion.
The cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)-responsive element-binding protein H (CREBH, encoded by CREB3L3) is a membrane-bound transcriptional factor that primarily localizes in the liver and small intestine. CREBH governs triglyceride metabolism in the liver, which mediates the changes in gene expression governing fatty acid oxidation, ketogenesis, and apolipoproteins related to lipoprotein lipase (LPL) activation. CREBH in the small intestine reduces cholesterol transporter gene Npc1l1 and suppresses cholesterol absorption from diet. A deficiency of CREBH in mice leads to severe hypertriglyceridemia, fatty liver, and atherosclerosis. CREBH, in synergy with peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor &amp;alpha; (PPAR&amp;alpha;), has a crucial role in upregulating Fgf21 expression, which is implicated in metabolic homeostasis including glucose and lipid metabolism. CREBH binds to and functions as a co-activator for both PPAR&amp;alpha; and liver X receptor alpha (LXR&amp;alpha;) in regulating gene expression of lipid metabolism. Therefore, CREBH has a crucial role in glucose and lipid metabolism in the liver and small intestine.
Breast cancer​ is one of the most commonly diagnosed cancers in women. Accumulating evidence suggests that cholesterol plays an important role in the development of breast cancer. Even though the mechanistic link between these two factors is not well understood, one possibility is that dysregulated cholesterol metabolism may affect lipid raft and membrane fluidity and can promote tumor development. Current studies have shown oxysterol 27-hydroxycholesterol (27-HC) as a critical regulator of cholesterol and breast cancer pathogenesis. This is supported by the significantly higher expression of CYP27A1 (cytochrome P450, family 27, subfamily A, polypeptide 1) in breast cancers. This enzyme is responsible for 27-HC synthesis from cholesterol. It has been shown that 27-HC can not only increase the proliferation of estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer cells but also stimulate tumor growth and metastasis in several breast cancer models. This phenomenon is surprising since 27-HC and other oxysterols generally reduce intracellular cholesterol levels by activating the liver X receptors (LXRs). Resolving this paradox will elucidate molecular pathways by which cholesterol, ER, and LXR are connected to breast cancer. These findings will also provide the rationale for evaluating pharmaceutical approaches that manipulate cholesterol or 27-HC synthesis in order to mitigate the impact of cholesterol on breast cancer pathophysiology. In addition to cholesterol, epigenetic changes including non-coding RNAs, and microRNAs, DNA methylation, and histone modifications, have all been shown to control tumorigenesis. The purpose of this review is to discuss the link between altered cholesterol metabolism and epigenetic modification during breast cancer progression.
Epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs) are efficient in treating patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring EGFR activating mutations. Unfortunately, nearly all patients ultimately acquire resistance to EGFR-TKI treatment. Liver X receptors (LXRs) can regulate tumor growth in various cancer cell lines. The present study indicated that LXR agonist combined with gefitinib weakened Akt-nuclear factor (NF)-κB activation and inhibited the expression levels of apoptosis-related proteins in vitro. By contrast, LXR ligands alone exhibited no significant effect on gefitinib-resistant lung cells. In conclusion, the study provided evidence for the combination treatment of acquired TKI resistance in NSCLC.
The liver X receptors α and β (LXRα and LXRβ) are oxysterol-activated transcription factors that coordinately regulate gene expression that is important for cholesterol and fatty acid metabolism. In addition to their roles in lipid metabolism, LXRs participate in the transcriptional regulation of macrophage activation and are considered potent regulators of inflammation. LXRs are highly similar, and despite notable exceptions, most of their reported functions are substantially overlapping. However, their individual genomic distribution and transcriptional capacities have not been characterized. Here, we report a macrophage cellular model expressing equivalent levels of tagged LXRs. Analysis of data from chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with deep sequencing revealed that LXRα and LXRβ occupy both overlapping and exclusive genomic regulatory sites of target genes and also control the transcription of a receptor-exclusive set of genes. Analysis of genomic H3K27 acetylation and mRNA transcriptional changes in response to synthetic agonist or antagonist treatments revealed a putative mode of pharmacologically independent regulation of transcription. Integration of microarray and sequencing data enabled the description of three possible mechanisms of LXR transcriptional activation. Together, these results contribute to our understanding of the common and differential genomic actions of LXRs and their impact on biological processes in macrophages.
Coffea arabica pulp (CP) is the first by-product obtained from coffee berries during coffee processing. The major constituents of CP, including chlorogenic acid, caffeine, and epicatechin exhibit anti-hyperlipidemic effects in in vitro and in vivo models. Whether Coffea arabica pulp aqueous extract (CPE) has a lipid-lowering effect remains unknown.
This study examined the effect of CPE on cholesterol absorption, and identified the mechanisms involved in lowered cholesterol in in vitro and in vivo models.
Uptake of [3H]-cholesterol micelles and the mode of CPE inhibition were determined using human intestinal Caco-2 cells, and subsequently, confirmed using isolated rat jejunal loops. In addition, the 12-week high-fat diet-induced hypercholesterolemic rats (HF) received either CPE (1000  mg/kg BW), a sole and high dose which was selected because it contained approximately 12  mg of CGA that was previously shown to have lipid-lowering effects, or ezetimibe (10  mg/kg BW), a cholesterol inhibitor. The rats were divided into HF, HF  ++ CPE, and HF  ++ ezetimibe groups for the next 12 weeks. Normal rats received a normal diet (ND) and CPE (ND  +  CPE). Body weights and lipid profiles were evaluated. Cholesterol transporter, Niemann-Pick C1-Like 1 (NPC1L1), protein expression and liver X receptor alpha (LXRα) mRNA expression were determined. In vitro micellar complex properties were also investigated.
CPE inhibited [3H]-cholesterol micelle transport in Caco-2 cells and rat jejunal loops in a dose-dependent, non-competitive manner partly by decreasing membrane NPC1L1 expression. Congruently, CPE and its major constituents activated LXRα which, in turn, down-regulated NPC1L1. Furthermore, CPE interfered with physicochemical characteristics of cholesterol mixed micelles. These data were consistent with decreased body weight and slowed body weight gain and improved lipid profiles by CPE in hypercholesterolemic rats while no change occurred in these parameters in normal rats. Down-regulated intestinal NPC1L1 expression mediated by increased LXRα mRNA were also observed in HF  ++ CPE and ND  +  CPE rats.
CPE has a cholesterol-lowering effect in in vitro and in vivo via inhibition of intestinal cholesterol absorption by down-regulating NPC1L1 mediated LXRα activation and interfering with micellar complex formation. Accordingly, CPE could be developed as nutraceutical product to prevent dyslipidemia-induced obesity and insulin resistance.
Dysregulation of cholesterol metabolism represents one of the major risk factors for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (CVD). Oxidized cholesterol esters (oxCE) in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) have been implicated in CVD but the underlying mechanisms remain poorly defined. We use a targeted lipidomic approach to demonstrate that levels of oxCEs in human plasma are associated with different types of CVD and significantly elevated in patients with myocardial infarction. We synthesized a major endogenous cholesterol ester hydroperoxide (CEOOH), cholesteryl-13(cis, trans)-hydroperoxy-octadecadienoate (ch-13(c,t)-HpODE) and show that this endogenous compound significantly increases plasma cholesterol level in mice while decrease cholesterol levels in mouse liver and peritoneal macrophages, which is primarily due to the inhibition of cholesterol uptake in macrophages and liver. Further studies indicate that inhibition of cholesterol uptake by ch-13(c,t)-HpODE in macrophages is dependent on LXRα-IDOL-LDLR pathway, whereas inhibition on cholesterol levels in hepatocytes is dependent on LXRα and LDLR. Consistently, these effects on cholesterol levels by ch-13(c,t)-HpODE are diminished in LDLR or LXRα knockout mice. Together, our study provides evidence that elevated plasma cholesterol levels by CEOOHs are primarily due to the inhibition of cholesterol uptake in the liver and macrophages, which may play an important role in the pathogenesis of CVD.
CYP27A1, an enzyme involved in regulating cellular cholesterol homeostasis, converts cholesterol into 27-hydroxycholesterol (27-HC). The relationship between CYP27A1 and cell proliferation was studied to determine the role of CYP27A1 in bladder cancer. The expression of CYP27A1 in three bladder cancer cell lines (T24, UM-UC-3 and 5637) were assessed by qRT-PCR and Western blotting, and cells with stable CYP27A1 expression were generated by lentiviral infection. Cell proliferation was detected by MTT assays, colony formation assays and a tumor xenograft model in vitro and in vivo, and the intracellular 27-HC and cholesterol secretion levels were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA). The results revealed that CYP27A1 expression was downregulated in androgen receptor (AR)-positive T24/UM-UC-3 cells compared with AR-negative 5637 cell. After CYP27A1 expression was restored, cell proliferation was inhibited in vitro and in vivo because much more intracellular 27-HC was produced in the CYP27A1-overexpressing cells than in the control cells. Both T24 and UM-UC-3 cells treated with 27-HC showed similar results. In addition, CYP27A1/27HC could reduce the cellular cholesterol level in both T24 and UM-UC-3 cells by upregulating ATP-binding cassette transporters G1 and A1 (ABCG1 and ABCA1) through Liver X receptors (LXRs) pathway and downregulating low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) expression. These findings all suggest that CYP27A1 is a critical cholesterol sensor in bladder cancer cells that may contribute significantly to bladder cancer proliferation.
Peroxisome proliferator-activator receptor (PPAR) γ is a nuclear hormone receptor that regulates glucose homeostasis, lipid metabolism, and adipocyte function. It has been shown that activation of PPARγ can reduce the incidence of gallstone. Herein we aimed to clarify the role of PPARγ in the reduction of gallstones. The plasmid containing the coding sequence of PPARγ was constructed and transfected in the human liver cell line (L02 cells). Western blot and RT-PCR were used to detect hydroxyl-methyl-glutaryl-CoA reductase (HMGCR), sterol regulatory element-binding proteins 2 (SREBP2), 7α-hydroxylase (CYP7A1), adenosine triphosphate-binding cassette (ABC) sterol transporters G5 and G8 (ABCG5, ABCG8) and liver X receptor α (LXRα). The Amplex Red cholesterol assay kit was used to detect the intracellular or extracellular cholesterol level. Our data showed that PPARγ overexpression caused significant decreases in both extracellular and intracellular cholesterol in the L02 cells. The further studies indicated PPARγ overexpression substantially decreased expression of HMGCR and SREBP-2, increased expression of CYP7A1, ABCG5, ABCG8 and LXRα. These results indicated that upregulation of PPARγ may reduce cholesterol levels through multiple-pathways including HMGCR/SREBP2-mediated biosynthesis, CYP7A1-mediated transformation, and ABCG5/ABCG8-mediated efflux. We thus suggest that PPARγ might have beneficial effects for cholesterol gallstones diseases.
The purpose of this study was to investigate the role of malignant ascites tumor microenvironment in ovarian cancer progression and chemoresistance.
A total of 45 patients with ovarian cancer and three benign ascites were collected at the time of clinical intervention. Ascites cholesterol levels were quantitated using cholesterol quantitation kit and recurrence free survival (RFS) of ovarian cancer patients were collected. The sensitivity of ovarian cancer cells to cisplatin (CDDP) and paclitaxel (PAC) were assessed by viability assay, flow cytometry and protein expression. Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve and Youden index analysis were applied to calculate the optimal cut-off values for ascites cholesterol. Kaplan-Meier curve were applied to compare RFS between high and low ascites cholesterol levels in ovarian cancer patients.
Here we show that cholesterol is elevated in malignant ascites and modulates the sensitivity of ovarian cancer cells to CDDP and PAC by upregulating the expression of drug efflux pump proteins, ABCG2 and MDR1, together with upregulation of LXRɑ/β, the cholesterol receptor. Transfection of LXRɑ/β siRNA inhibited cholesterol-induced chemoresistance and upregulation of MDR1. In addition, the cholesterol level in malignant ascites was negatively correlated with number of CDDP-induced apoptotic cell death, but not with that of PAC-induced apoptotic cell death. Cholesterol depletion by methyl beta cyclodextrin (MβCD) inhibited malignant ascites-induced chemoresistance to CDDP and upregulation of MDR1 and LXRɑ/β. For patients with ovarian cancer, high cholesterol level in malignant ascites correlated with short RFS.
High cholesterol in malignant ascites contributes to poor prognosis in ovarian cancer patients, partly by contributing to multidrug resistance through upregulation of MDR1 via activation of LXRɑ/β.
Choroidal endothelial cells supply oxygen and nutrients to retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells and photoreceptors, recycle metabolites, and dispose of metabolic waste through the choroidal blood circulation. Death of the endothelial cells of the choroid may cause abnormal deposits including unesterified and esterified cholesterol beneath RPE cells and within Bruch's membrane that contribute to the progression of age-related macular degeneration (AMD), the most prevalent cause of blindness in older people. Translocator protein (TSPO) is a cholesterol-binding protein that is involved in mitochondrial cholesterol transport and other cellular functions. We have investigated the role of TSPO in choroidal endothelial cells. Immunocytochemistry showed that TSPO was localized to the mitochondria of choroidal endothelial cells. Choroidal endothelial cells exposed to TSPO ligands (Etifoxine or XBD-173) had significantly increased cholesterol efflux, higher expression of cholesterol homeostasis genes (LXRα, CYP27A1, CYP46A1, ABCA1 and ABCG1), and reduced biosynthesis of cholesterol and phospholipids from [14C]acetate, when compared to untreated controls. Treatment with TSPO ligands also resulted in reduced production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), increased antioxidant capacity, and reduced release of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α and VEGF) induced by oxidized LDL. These data suggest TSPO ligands may offer promise for the treatment of AMD.
Stress is a reflex response, both psychological and physiological, of the body to a difficult situation that requires adaptation. Stress is at the intersection of the objective event and the subjective event. The physiological mechanisms involved in chronic stress are numerous and can contribute to a wide variety of disorders, in all systems including the immune system. Stress modifies the Th1/Th2 balance via the HPA axis and a set of immune mediators. This will make the body more vulnerable to external infections in a scientific way while others claim the opposite, stress could be considered immune stimulatory. The development of synthetic LXR ligands such as T0901317 and GW3965 as well as an understanding of the direct involvement of these receptors in the regulation of proopiomelanocortin (POMC) gene expression and indirectly by producing a variety of cytokines in a stressor response, will open in the near future new therapeutic methods against the undesirable effects of stress on the behavior of the immune system.
Exposure to potential Endocrine Disrupting Chemicals (EDCs) pose a documented risk to both wildlife and human health. Many studies so far described declining sperm counts, genital malformations, early puberty onset, highlighting the negative impact on reproduction caused by the exposure to many anthropogenic chemicals. In the last years, increasing evidence suggested that these compounds, other than altering reproduction, affect metabolism and induce the onset of obesity and metabolic disorders. According to the "environmental obesogens" hypothesis, evidence exists that exposure to potential EDCs during critical periods when adipocytes are differentiating, and organs are developing, can induce diseases that manifest later in the life. This review summarizes the effects occurring at the hepatic level in different animal models, describing morphological alterations and changes of molecular pathways elicited by the toxicant exposure. Results currently available demonstrated that these chemicals impair normal metabolic processes via interaction with members of the nuclear receptor superfamily, including steroid hormone receptors, thyroid hormone receptors, retinoid X receptors, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors, liver X receptors, and farnesoid X receptors. In addition, novel results revealed that EDC exposure can either affect circadian rhythms as well as up-regulate the expression of signals belonging to the endocannabinoid system, in both cases leading to a remarkable increase of lipid accumulation. These results warrant further research and increase the interest toward the identification of new mechanisms for EDC metabolic alterations. The last part of this review article condenses recent evidences on the ability of potential EDCs to cause "transgenerational effects" by a single prenatal or early life exposure. On this regard, there is compelling evidence that epigenetic modifications link developmental environmental insults to adult disease susceptibility. This review will contribute to summarize the mechanisms underlying the insurgence of EDC-induced metabolic alterations as well as to build integrated strategies for their better management. In fact, despite the large number of results obtained so far, there is still a great demand for the development of frameworks that can integrate mechanistic and toxicological/epidemiological observations. This would increase legal and governmental institution awareness on this critical environmental issue responsible for negative consequences in both wild species and human health.
Fumonisin B1 (FB1), a congener of fumonisins produced by Fusarium species, is the most abundant and most toxicologically active fumonisin. FB1 causes severe mycotoxicosis in animals, including nephrotoxicity, hepatotoxicity, and disruption of the intestinal barrier. However, mechanisms associated with FB1 toxicity are still unclear. Preliminary studies have highlighted the role of liver X receptors (LXRs) during FB1 exposure. LXRs belong to the nuclear receptor family and control the expression of genes involved in cholesterol and lipid homeostasis. In this context, the toxicity of FB1 was compared in female wild-type (LXR+/+) and LXRα,β double knockout (LXR-/-) mice in the absence or presence of FB1 (10 mg/kg body weight/day) for 28 days. Exposure to FB1 supplemented in the mice's drinking water resulted in more pronounced hepatotoxicity in LXR-/- mice compared to LXR+/+ mice, as indicated by hepatic transaminase levels (ALT, AST) and hepatic inflammatory and fibrotic lesions. Next, the effect of FB1 exposure on the liver transcriptome was investigated. FB1 exposure led to a specific transcriptional response in LXR-/- mice that included altered cholesterol and bile acid homeostasis. ELISA showed that these effects were associated with an elevated FB1 concentration in the plasma of LXR-/- mice, suggesting that LXRs participate in intestinal absorption and/or clearance of the toxin. In summary, this study demonstrates an important role of LXRs in protecting the liver against FB1-induced toxicity, suggesting an alternative mechanism not related to the inhibition of sphingolipid synthesis for mycotoxin toxicity.
The study is designed to determine whether consumption of the soy isoflavones, genistein and daidzein, differentially influence metabolic syndrome, and to further investigate the involvement of Liver X Receptor (LXR) regulation. C57BL/6J mice were fed diets as follows: low fat diet (LF), western-style diet (WD), and WD containing 0.16% (w/w) of genistein (WD + G) or daidzein (WD + D) for 10 weeks. Intake of WD + G and WD + D produced a robust decrease in body weight gain by 40% and 19%, respectively (p &lt; 0.05). Genistein reduced energy intake by 26%, and daidzein decreased energy intake by 8% (p &lt; 0.05). A glucose tolerance test indicated that genistein consumption significantly decreased the incremental areas under the curve (AUC) from 60-120 min, compared to WD-fed mice. Gene array profiling of hepatic mRNA, and cell studies utilizing transiently-transfected HepG2 cells and mouse embryonic fibroblast cells devoid of or expressing LXRα, indicate that genistein and daidzein induce LXR-mediated pathways. In summary, addition of genistein, compared to daidzein, to a western-style diet, more profoundly decreased food intake, body weight gain, while both appear to regulate LXR-mediated pathways.
Adiponectin is known to have beneficial effects on lipid and insulin metabolism, wound healing, and cellular senescence, but its effect on skin barrier formation remains unknown. We investigated the effects of adiponectin on keratinocyte lipid synthesis with respect to skin barrier function. Lipid staining revealed an adiponectin-mediated increase in keratinocyte intracellular and reconstructed epidermal lipid content. Moreover, significant increases in the levels of ceramide and its downstream metabolites (sphingosine and sphingosine-1-phosphate) following adiponectin stimulation were detected using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Expression levels of keratinocyte differentiation markers were also increased. Adiponectin also increased expression of lipid biosynthesis enzymes (fatty acid synthase, HMG-CoA reductase, and serine palmitoyltransferase), nuclear hormone receptors (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors and liver X receptors), and the adiponectin signal molecule SIRT1. Suppression of SIRT1, liver X receptor-α, or peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-α downregulated the expression of lipid synthetic enzymes, decreasing lipid content. Inhibition of adiponectin receptors decreased expression of nuclear hormone receptors, SIRT1, lipid-synthesizing enzymes, and sphingolipids. Thus, activation of adiponectin signaling increases the expression of transcription factors, including SIRT1, liver X receptor-α, and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-α, enhancing lipid synthesis and keratinocyte cell differentiation and possibly aiding in the maintenance of skin barrier homeostasis.
Macrophage-derived foam-cell formation plays a crucial role in the development of atherosclerosis, and liver X receptor alpha (LXRα) is a key regulator of lipid metabolism in macrophages. Homocysteine (Hcy) is an independent risk factor of atherosclerosis; however, the regulation of lipid metabolism and role of LXRα induced by Hcy in macrophages is still unknown. The present study aimed to investigate the potential role of Hcy in disordered lipid metabolism and atherosclerotic lesions, especially the effects of Hcy on cholesterol efflux in macrophages and the possible mechanisms.
In vitro, lipid accumulation and cholesterol efflux were evaluated in THP-1 macrophages with Hcy intervention. Real-time quantitative PCR and western blot analyses were used to assess mRNA and protein levels. In vivo, atherosclerotic lesions and lipid profiles were evaluated by methionine diet-induced hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy) in ApoE-/- mice. The LXRα agonist T0901317 was used to verify the role of LXRα in HHcy-accelerated atherosclerosis.
Hcy promoted lipid accumulation and inhibited cholesterol efflux in THP-1 macrophages. HHcy mice showed increased lesion area and lipid accumulation in plaque. Both studies in vitro and in vivo showed decreased expression of ATP binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) and G1 (ABCG1). T0901317 treatment increased ABCA1 and ABCG1 levels; reversed macrophage-derived foam-cell formation in THP-1 macrophages and reduced atherosclerotic lesions in ApoE-/- mice.
Inhibition of LXRα-mediated ABCA1/ABCG1-dependent cholesterol efflux from macrophages is a novel mechanism in Hcy-accelerated atherosclerosis.
Anthocyanin-rich cherries are known for preventing/decreasing risk factors associated with obesity; however, the specific benefits exerted by cherry non-anthocyanin phenolics are not clear. Obese diabetic (db/db) mice fed a diet supplemented with anthocyanin-depleted cherry powder (cherry) were compared to db/db (obese) or lean counterparts (lean) fed a control isocaloric diet for 12 weeks. The reduced plasma interleukin (IL)-6 and improved liver health may be mediated by cherry fibre and non-anthocyanin phenolics. Benefits for liver health included reduction of lipids and protein carbonyls, and modulation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)δ mRNA to resemble levels in lean. Lack of plasma antilipidemic, improvement of antioxidant defenses, and PPARα/γ mRNA modulation in liver suggest cherry anthocyanins specific benefits. This is the first study to elucidate in vivo the potential benefits of cherry non-anthocyanin phenolics for diabetes-induced liver disorders and the importance of choosing processing technologies that preserve anthocyanins and health benefits of whole cherries.
Liver X receptors (LXRs) play an important role in the regulation of cholesterol, fatty acid and glucose metabolisms together with inflammatory processes. In the present study, the effects of LXR agonist GW3965 on vascular reactivity and expression of functional proteins in DOCA-Salt induced hypertension were examined.
Hypertension was induced through unilateral nephrectomy and deoxycorticosterone-acetate (DOCA) injection (20 mg/kg, twice a week) for 6 weeks in male Wistar albino rats (8 weeks old). An LXR agonist GW3965 (10 mg/kg/day, i.p.) was administered to animals for last seven days.
GW3965 treatment reduced systolic blood pressures in hypertensive rats. Acetylcholine-induced endothelium-dependent and sodium nitroprusside-induced endothelium-independent vasorelaxations were decreased in hypertensive rats but not affected by GW3965. GW3965 treatment enhanced plasma nitrite levels in normotensive rats. KCl and phenylephrine (Phe)-induced vasocontractions were reduced in hypertensive groups and increased with GW3965 treatment. Decreased sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase2 (SERCA2) expression in the hypertensive aorta was not changed by GW3965 treatment. Expression of inositoltrisphosphate receptor1 (IP3R1) was increased by GW3965 in normotensive animals. The nuclear factor kappaB (NF-κB) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) expressions were increased in hypertensive rats and reduced by GW3965 treatment.
The results of study indicate that the LXR agonist, GW3965, exhibited a beneficial effect on increased blood pressure and improved hypertension-induced impairment in contractile activity of vessel and inflammatory markers in vascular tissue. Therefore, these effects of LXR agonists on vessel should be taken into account in experimental or therapeutic approaches to hypertension.
It has been long recognized that cholesterol is a critical molecule in mammalian cell biology, primarily for its contribution to the plasma membrane's composition and its role in assuring proper transmembrane receptor signaling as part of lipid rafts. Efforts have also been made to characterize the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway, cholesterol homeostasis, and cholesterol-derived metabolites in order to gain insights into their dysregulation during metabolic diseases. Despite the central role cholesterol metabolism plays in shaping human health, its regulation during immune activation, such as immune response to pathogens or autoimmune/autoinflammatory diseases, is poorly understood. The immune system is composed of several type of cells with distinct developmental origin, life span, molecular requirements, and gene expressions. It is unclear whether the same array of cholesterol metabolism regulators are equally employed by different immune cells and whether distinct cholesterol metabolites have similar biological consequences in different immune cells. In this review, we will describe how cholesterol metabolism is controlled during the adaptive and the innate immune response and the role for intracellular and extracellular receptors for cholesterol and its derivatives.
Six transmembrane protein of prostate 2 (STAMP2) is a critical modulator of inflammation and metabolism in adipose tissue. There are no data on the expression of STAMP2 in chronic kidney disease, which is an inflammatory disease related to metabolic disorders. This study aimed to investigate STAMP2 expression in the kidney and heart in 5/6 nephrectomy (Nx) rats, and the effect of omega-3 fatty acid (FA) on STAMP2 expression. Male Sprague Dawley rats were divided into three groups: sham control (0.9% saline), 5/6 Nx (0.9% saline), and 5/6 Nx treated with omega-3 FA (300 mg per kg per day by gastric gavage). The expression of STAMP2 in the kidney and heart were examined by western blotting. Serum creatinine levels were higher in 5/6 Nx rats than in controls. Compared with sham controls, the expression of IκB, NF-κB, NOX4, SREBP-1, and LXR were upregulated and STAMP2 and phosphorylated-AMPK expression were downregulated in the kidney and heart of 5/6 Nx rats. Omega-3 FA supplementation prevented these changes in biomarkers related to inflammation and metabolic lipid disorders. Omega 3-FA supplementation induced the upregulation of STAMP2 protein in 5/6 Nx rats, which was associated with an attenuation of inflammation- and metabolic disease-related markers.
Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a very common liver disease, and its incidence has significantly increased worldwide. The liver X receptor α (LXRα) is a multifunctional nuclear receptor that controls lipid homeostasis. Inhibition of LXRα transactivation may be beneficial for NAFLD and hyperlipidemia treatment. Ursolic acid (UA) is a plant triterpenoid with many beneficial effects; however, the mechanism of its action on LXRα remains elusive. We evaluated the effects of UA on T0901317 (T090)-induced LXRα activation and steatosis. UA significantly decreased the LXR response element and sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c ( SREBP-1c) gene promoter activities, mRNA, protein expression of LXRα target genes, and hepatic cellular lipid content in a T090-induced mouse model. A molecular docking study indicated that UA bound competitively with T090 at the LXRα ligand binding domain. UA stimulated AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) phosphorylation in hepatic cells and increased corepressor, small heterodimer partner-interacting leucine zipper protein (SMILE) but decreased coactivator, steroid receptor coactivator-1 (SRC-1) recruitment to the SREBP-1c promoter region. In contrast, UA induced SRC-1 binding but decreased SMILE binding to reverse cholesterol transport-related gene promoters in intestinal cells, increasing lipid excretion from intestinal cells. Additionally, UA reduced valproate-induced LXRα mediated and rifampin-induced pregnane X receptor mediated lipogenesis, offering potential treatments for drug-induced hepatic steatosis. Thus, UA displays liver specificity and can be selectively repressed while RCT stimulation by LXRα is preserved and enhanced. This is a novel therapeutic option to treat NAFLD and may be helpful in developing LXR agonists to prevent atherosclerosis.
Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are an important group of pervasive noncoding RNAs (&gt;200nt) proposed to be crucial regulators of numerous physiological and pathological processes. Through interactions with RNA, chromatin, and protein, lncRNAs modulate mRNA stability, chromatin structure, and the function of proteins (including transcription factors). In addition, to their well-known roles in the modulation of cell growth, apoptosis, neurological disease progression and cancer metastasis, these large molecules have also been identified as likely mediators of lipid metabolism. In particular, lncRNAs orchestrate adipogenesis; fatty acid, cholesterol, and phospholipid metabolism and transport; and the formation of high-density and low-density lipoproteins (HDLs and LDLs). LncRNAs also appear to target several transcription factors that play essential roles in the regulation of lipid metabolism, such as liver X receptors (LXRs), sterol regulatory element binding proteins (SREBPs), and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ). Better understanding the regulatory roles of lncRNAs in dyslipidemia, atherosclerosis, and adipogenesis will reveal appropriate strategies to treat these diseases. In this review, we review recent progress in lncRNA-mediated regulation of lipid metabolism, as well as its role in the regulation of adipogenesis.
Recent advances in the development of human-based in vitro models offer new tools for drug screening and mechanistic investigations of new therapeutic agents. However, there is a lack of evidence that disease models respond favourably to potential drug candidates. Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a very common disease associated with an altered skin barrier and chronic inflammation. Here, we demonstrate that the AD-like features of a reconstructed human epidermis (RHE) model treated with Th2 cytokines are reversed in the presence of molecules known to have a beneficial effect on damaged skin as a result of modulating various signalling cascades including the Liver X Receptors and JAK/STAT pathways. This work shows that standardized and reproducible RHE are relevant models for therapeutic research assessing new drug candidates aiming to restore epidermal integrity in an inflammatory environment.
Liver X receptors (LXRs) are involved in various diseases associated with lipid disorders, and in regulating cancer cell proliferation. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms, especially those in gastric cancer (GC) remain to be clarified. In this study, immunohistochemistry analysis revealed that LXRβ was mainly expressed in GC tissue, with less expression in adjacent normal tissues. The LXRβ agonist T0901317 efficiently suppressed the proliferation and colony formation of various GC cell lines. We further showed that LXRβ translocated from the cytoplasm to the nucleus when activated by T0901317. LXRβ nuclear localization suppressed the activation of Wnt signalling and decreased the expression of target genes such as MYC, BMP4, and MMP7 through binding to their promoters. Moreover, we demonstrated that the LXR agonist efficiently suppressed GC tumour growth in a nude mouse xenograft model. Taken together, these results revealed that LXRβ agonist inhibited GC cells proliferation by suppressing Wnt signalling via LXRβ relocalization. The results strongly suggest that LXRβ could be a promising target in GC therapy.
The present study was performed to explore the underlying molecular mechanism of Cu-induced disorder of lipid metabolism in fish. To this end, adult zebrafish were exposed to three waterborne Cu concentrations (0 (control), 8 and 16 μg Cu/L, respectively) for 60 days. Hepatic Cu content and hepatosomatic index increased after waterborne Cu exposure. H&amp;E and oil red O stainings showed extensive steatosis in the liver of Cu-exposed fish. Cu exposure up-regulated lipogenic enzymes activities of ME, ICDH, 6PGD, G6PD and FAS, but down-regulated CPTI activities. Transcriptomic analysis indicated that lipid metabolism related pathways were significantly enriched in both low-dose and high-dose Cu exposure group. Genes involved in lipogenic process from fatty acid biosynthesis, fatty acid elongation, fatty acid desaturation to glycerolipid biosynthesis were up-regulated by Cu. To elucidate the mechanism, LXRα inhibitor SR9243 and SREBP1 inhibitor fatostatin were used to verify the role of LXRα and SREBP1 in Cu-induced disorder of lipid metabolism. Both SR9243 and fatostatin significantly attenuated the Cu-induced increase of TG accumulation of hepatocytes. Meanwhile, SR9243 significantly attenuated the Cu-induced up-regulation of expression of lipogenic genes (acaca, fas, icdh, dgat1, moat2 and moat3), and fatostatin significantly attenuated the up-regulation of expression of acaca, fas, g6pd, dgat1 and moat2. Enzymes analysis showed both SR9243 and fatostatin blocked the Cu-induced increase of lipogenic enzymes activities. Taken together, our findings highlight the importance of LXRα and SREBP1 in Cu-induced hepatic lipid deposition, which proposed a novel mechanism for elucidating metal element exposure inducing the disorder of lipid metabolism in aquatic vertebrates.
Recent evidence indicates that immune cells contribute to the formation of tumor metastases by regulating the pre-metastatic niche. Whether tumor-derived factors involved in primary tumor formation play a role in metastasis formation is poorly characterized. Oxysterols act as endogenous regulators of lipid metabolism through the interaction with the nuclear Liver X Receptors-(LXR)α and LXRβ. In the context of tumor development, they establish a pro-tumor environment by dampening antitumor immune responses, and by recruiting pro-angiogenic and immunosuppressive neutrophils. However, the ability of LXR/oxysterol axis to promote tumor invasion and metastasis by exploiting immune cells, is still up to debate. In this study we provide evidence that oxysterols participate in the primary growth of orthotopically implanted 4T1 breast tumors by establishing a tumor-promoting microenvironment. Furthermore, we show that oxysterols are involved in the metastatic spread of 4T1 breast tumors, since their enzymatic inactivation mediated by the sulfotransferase 2B1b, reduces the number of metastatic cells in the lungs of tumor-bearing mice. Finally, we provide evidence that oxysterols support the metastatic cascade by modifying the lung metastatic niche, particularly allowing the recruitment of tumor-promoting neutrophils. These results identify a possible new metastatic pathway to target in order to prevent metastasis formation in breast cancer patients.
Obesity is associated with many complications, including type 2 diabetes and painful neuropathy. There is no cure or prevention for obesity-induced pain, and the neurobiology underlying the onset of the disease is still obscure. In this study, we observe that western diet (WD)-fed mice developed early allodynia with an increase of ER stress markers in the sensory neurons of the dorsal root ganglia (DRG). Using cell-specific approaches, we demonstrate that neuronal liver X receptor (LXR) activation delays ER stress and allodynia in WD-fed mice. Our findings suggest that lipid-binding nuclear receptors expressed in the sensory neurons of the DRG play a role in the onset of obesity-induced hypersensitivity. The LXR and lipid-sensor pathways represent a research avenue to identify targets to prevent debilitating complications affecting the peripheral nerve system in obesity.
Goat intramuscular fat (IMF) content is mainly determined by the processes of intramuscular preadipocytes adipogenic differentiation and mature adipocyte lipid accumulation. However, the underlying regulators of these biological processes remain largely unknown. Here, we report that the expression of Liver X receptor alpha (LXRα) reaches a peak at early stage and then gradually decreases during goat intramuscular adipogenesis. Knockdown of LXRα mediated by two independent siRNAs significantly inhibits intramuscular adipocytes lipid accumulation and upregulates preadipocytes marker- preadipocyte factor 1 (pref1) expression. Consistently, siRNA treatments robustly decrease mRNA level of adipogenic related genes, including CCAAT enhancer binding protein alpha (Cebpα), Peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma (Pparg), Sterol regulatory element binding protein isoform 1c (Srebp1c), Fatty acids binding protein (aP2) and Lipoprotein lipase (Lpl). Next, adenovirus overexpression of LXRα does not affect intramuscular adipocytes adipogenesis manifested by Oil Red O signal measurement and adipogenic specific genes detection. Mechanically, we found that both CCAAT enhancer binding protein beta (Cebpβ) and Kruppel like factor 8 (Klf8) are potential targets of LXRα, indicated by having putative binding sites of LXRα at the promoter of these genes and similar expression pattern during adipogenesis comparing to LXRα. Importantly, mRNA levels of Cebpβ and Klf8 are downregulated significantly in goat LXRα knockdown intramuscular adipocyte. These results demonstrate that loss function of LXRα inhibits intramuscular adipogenesis possibly through down-regulation of Cebpβ and Klf8. Our research will provide new insights into mechanical regulation of goat IMF deposition.
Obesity is increasing in an alarming rate worldwide, which causes higher risks of some diseases, such as type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and cancer. Current therapeutic approaches, either pancreatic lipase inhibitors or appetite suppressors, are generally of limited effectiveness. Brown adipose tissue (BAT) and beige cells dissipate fatty acids as heat to maintain body temperature, termed non-shivering thermogenesis; the activity and mass of BAT and beige cells are negatively correlated with overweight and obesity. The existence of BAT and beige cells in human adults provides an effective weight reduction therapy, a process likely to be amenable to pharmacological intervention. Herein, we combed through the physiology of thermogenesis and the role of BAT and beige cells in combating with obesity. We summarized the thermogenic regulators identified in the past decades, targeting G protein-coupled receptors, transient receptor potential channels, nuclear receptors and miscellaneous pathways. Advances in clinical trials were also presented. The main purpose of this review is to provide a comprehensive and up-to-date knowledge from the biological importance of thermogenesis in energy homeostasis to the representative thermogenic regulators for treating obesity. Thermogenic regulators might have a large potential for further investigations to be developed as lead compounds in fighting obesity.
Liver-X-Receptors are ligand-dependent transcription factors activated by cholesterol metabolites. These receptors induce a suite of target genes required for de novo synthesis of triglycerides and cholesterol transport in many tissues. Two different isoforms -LXRα and LXRβ- have been well characterized in liver, adipocytes, macrophages and intestinal epithelium among others, but their contribution to cholesterol and fatty acid efflux in the lactating mammary epithelium is poorly understood. We hypothesize that LXR regulates lipogenesis during milk fat production in lactation. Global mRNA analysis of mouse mammary epithelial cells (MECs) revealed multiple LXR/RXR targets upregulated sharply early in lactation compared to mid-pregnancy. LXRα is the primary isoform and its protein levels increase throughout lactation in MECs. The LXR agonist GW3965 markedly induced several genes involved in cholesterol transport and lipogenesis and enhanced cytoplasmic lipid droplet accumulation in the HC11 MEC cell line. Importantly, in vivo pharmacological activation of LXR increased the milk cholesterol percentage and induced Srebp1c and Abca7 expression in MECs. Cumulatively, our findings identify LXRα as an important regulator of cholesterol incorporation into the milk through key nodes of de novo lipogenesis, suggesting a potential therapeutic target in women with difficulty initiating lactation.
Liver X receptors (LXRs) α (NR1H3) and β (NR1H2) are nuclear receptors that have been involved in the regulation of many physiological processes, principally in the control of cholesterol homeostasis, as well as in the control of the cell death and proliferation balance. These receptors are thus promising therapeutic targets in various pathologies such as dyslipidemia, atherosclerosis, diabetes and/or cancers. These receptors are known to be activated by specific oxysterol compounds. The screening for LXR-specific ligands is a challenging process: indeed, these molecules should present a specificity towards each LXR-isoform. Because some natural products have significant effects in the regulation of the LXR-regulated homeostasis and are enriched in flavonoids, we have decided to test in cell culture the effects of 4 selected flavonoids (galangin, quercetin, apigenin and naringenin) on the modulation of LXR activity using double-hybrid experiments. In silico, molecular docking suggests specific binding pattern between agonistic and antagonistic molecules. Altogether, these results allow a better understanding of the ligand binding pocket of LXRα/β. They also improve our knowledge about flavonoid mechanism of action, allowing the selection and development of better LXR selective ligands.
Liver X receptors (LXRs) have emerged as important regulators of inflammatory gene expression. Previously, we had reported that an LXRα gene promoter polymorphism (-1830 T &gt; C) is associated with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Therefore, we assessed cytokine expression in relation to LXRα polymorphism in monocyte-derived macrophages from patients with SLE. Macrophages were obtained after 72 hours of culture of human monocytes supplemented with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate. Cells were transfected with LXRα promoter constructs. Additionally, peripheral blood mononuclear cell- (PBMC-) derived macrophages from the patients were evaluated for proinflammatory cytokines in relation to the genotypes of LXRα -1830 T &gt; C. The expression of LXRα was increased in macrophages; levels of proinflammatory cytokines were decreased with LXRα expression. Production of proinflammatory cytokines varied depending on LXRα -1830 T &gt; C genotype. In particular, expression of LXRα was decreased and that of proinflammatory cytokines was increased for LXRα -1830 TC genotype compared to that for TT genotype. The data were consistent in PBMC-derived macrophages from patients with SLE. Increased proinflammatory cytokines is related to TLR7 and TLR9 expression. These data suggest that the expression levels of LXRα, according to LXRα -1830 T &gt; C genotype, may contribute to the inflammatory response by induction of inflammatory cytokines in SLE.
Protein-bound uremic toxins indoxyl sulfate (IS) and p-cresyl sulfate (PCS) have been associated with cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in patients with CKD. However, direct evidence for a role of these toxins in CKD-related vascular calcification has not been reported.
To study early and late vascular alterations by toxin exposure, we exposed CKD rats to vehicle, IS (150 mg/kg per day), or PCS (150 mg/kg per day) for either 4 days (short-term exposure) or 7 weeks (long-term exposure). We also performed unbiased proteomic analyses of arterial samples coupled to functional bioinformatic annotation analyses to investigate molecular signaling events associated with toxin-mediated arterial calcification.
Long-term exposure to either toxin at serum levels similar to those experienced by patients with CKD significantly increased calcification in the aorta and peripheral arteries. Our analyses revealed an association between calcification events, acute-phase response signaling, and coagulation and glucometabolic signaling pathways, whereas escape from toxin-induced calcification was linked with liver X receptors and farnesoid X/liver X receptor signaling pathways. Additional metabolic linkage to these pathways revealed that IS and PCS exposure engendered a prodiabetic state evidenced by elevated resting glucose and reduced GLUT1 expression. Short-term exposure to IS and PCS (before calcification had been established) showed activation of inflammation and coagulation signaling pathways in the aorta, demonstrating that these signaling pathways are causally implicated in toxin-induced arterial calcification.
In CKD, both IS and PCS directly promote vascular calcification via activation of inflammation and coagulation pathways and were strongly associated with impaired glucose homeostasis.
Recent studies have reported the upregulation of a subgroup of triacylglycerides as markers of different diseases with dysregulated lipogenesis, which means that these markers are not selective. This observation has a deep impact on their use as diagnostic tools in clinical practice (e.g., markers of risk of type 2 diabetes).
To evaluate the role of liver X receptor (LXR) nuclear receptors on irradiation-induced cell death and polarization of macrophages and the potential implications in the context of radiation therapy treatment of cancer.
Primary and immortalized murine bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) from wild type or LXR double knock-out mice were exposed to gamma irradiation. Subsequently, analysis of LXR signaling on cell proliferation and cytotoxicity induced by ionizing radiation was determined by time-lapse photomicroscopy. Genotoxic cell damage was evaluated by Western blot of γ-H2AX and p53. Pyroptosis was analyzed through cell viability assay, lactate dehydrogenase release assay, and Western blot of caspase-1 active protein. Expression of inflammatory markers was measured by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction.
Genetic and pharmacologic inactivation of LXR induced radiosensitivity of macrophages. LXR deficiency decreased cell proliferation and enhanced cytotoxicity induced by ionizing radiation in both immortalized and primary BMDMs. Protein levels of γ-H2AX and p53, both involved in response to cell damage, were exacerbated in LXR-deficient macrophages exposed to irradiation. Cell membrane damage was augmented and cell viability was decreased in LXR-deficient macrophages compared with LXR wild type macrophages in response to irradiation. In addition, LXR deficiency enhanced both caspase-1 activation and lactate dehydrogenase release in BMDM exposed inflammasome activators. LXR inactivation or deficiency markedly increased the expression of proinflammatory markers IL-1β, IL-6, and inducible nitric oxide synthase in irradiated macrophages.
The present work identifies LXR transcription factors as potential therapeutic targets to enhance the suppressive effects of radiation therapy on tumor growth through induction of macrophage cell death and activation of the inflammatory cascade.
Nuclear receptors (NRs) are ligand-activated transcription factors that are expressed in a variety of cells, including macrophages. For decades, NRs have been therapeutic targets because their activity can be pharmacologically modulated by specific ligands and small molecule inhibitors. NRs regulate a variety of processes, including those intersecting metabolic and immune functions, and have been studied in regard to various autoimmune diseases. However, the complex roles of NRs in host response to infection are only recently being investigated. The NRs peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) and liver X receptors (LXRs) have been most studied in the context of infectious diseases; however, recent work has also linked xenobiotic pregnane X receptors (PXRs), vitamin D receptor (VDR), REV-ERBα, the nuclear receptor 4A (NR4A) family, farnesoid X receptors (FXRs), and estrogen-related receptors (ERRs) to macrophage responses to pathogens. Pharmacological inhibition or antagonism of certain NRs can greatly influence overall disease outcome, and NRs that are protective against some diseases can lead to susceptibility to others. Targeting NRs as a novel host-directed treatment approach to infectious diseases appears to be a viable option, considering that these transcription factors play a pivotal role in macrophage lipid metabolism, cholesterol efflux, inflammatory responses, apoptosis, and production of antimicrobial byproducts. In the current review, we discuss recent findings concerning the role of NRs in infectious diseases with an emphasis on PPARγ and LXR, the two most studied. We also highlight newer work on the activity of emerging NRs during infection.
Activation of liver X receptors (LXRs) by synthetic agonists was found to improve cognition in Alzheimer's disease (AD) mice. However, these LXR agonists induce hypertriglyceridemia and hepatic steatosis, hampering their use in the clinic. We hypothesized that phytosterols as LXR agonists enhance cognition in AD without affecting plasma and hepatic triglycerides. Phytosterols previously reported to activate LXRs were tested in a luciferase-based LXR reporter assay. Using this assay, we found that phytosterols commonly present in a Western type diet in physiological concentrations do not activate LXRs. However, a lipid extract of the 24(S)-Saringosterol-containing seaweed Sargassum fusiforme did potently activate LXRβ. Dietary supplementation of crude Sargassum fusiforme or a Sargassum fusiforme-derived lipid extract to AD mice significantly improved short-term memory and reduced hippocampal Aβ plaque load by 81%. Notably, none of the side effects typically induced by full synthetic LXR agonists were observed. In contrast, administration of the synthetic LXRα activator, AZ876, did not improve cognition and resulted in the accumulation of lipid droplets in the liver. Administration of Sargassum fusiforme-derived 24(S)-Saringosterol to cultured neurons reduced the secretion of Aβ42. Moreover, conditioned medium from 24(S)-Saringosterol-treated astrocytes added to microglia increased phagocytosis of Aβ. Our data show that Sargassum fusiforme improves cognition and alleviates AD pathology. This may be explained at least partly by 24(S)-Saringosterol-mediated LXRβ activation.
Nuclear receptors (NRs) are transcription factors actively involved in many aspects of human physiology and pathology, serving as sensors of stimuli, master regulators of downstream molecular events and hubs governing complex gene regulatory networks. The importance of various members of the NR superfamily in cancer has led to substantial efforts to target them therapeutically. Notably, drugs that block the action of estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) in patients with ERα+ breast cancer or the androgen receptor (AR) in prostate cancer patients have provided remarkable improvements in survival. However, there is continuing need for novel drugs that target ERα or AR owing to resistance to established drugs, and there are also promising opportunities for targeting other nuclear receptors in cancer. In this article, we overview NR-based drug discovery in cancer and related resistance mechanisms, focusing on novel strategies for targeting well-established NR targets, including ERα, AR, the glucocorticoid receptor and the progesterone receptor, as well as opportunities to target other NRs that are attracting interest in immuno-oncology, such as liver X receptors (LXRs), RAR-related orphan receptors (RORs) and farnesoid X receptors (FXRs).
Liver X receptors are members of the nuclear receptor superfamily of transcription factors. The LXR genes (NR1H2 and NR1H3) encode for two different proteins referred to as LXRα and LXRβ. Each LXR presents diverse tissue distribution but similar target DNA-binding elements and ligands. Both LXRs act as relevant transcriptional regulators of cholesterol metabolism in many tissues. Additionally, LXRs participate in innate immunity and inflammation. Therefore, in order to understand the molecular requirements that operate in LXR-dependent transcription, it is important to decipher LXR genomic binding properties. We have recently performed genome-wide binding analysis of LXR proteins. In this method paper, we describe a detailed computational protocol primarily based on HOMER software package for the analysis of ChIP-seq data.
Oxidative derivatives of cholesterol such as 22(R)-hydroxycholesterol, 24(S)-hydroxycholesterol, 25-hydroxycholesterol, and (25S),26-hydroxycholesterol are endogenous ligands for the liver X receptors (LXRα and LXRβ). The LXRs are nuclear hormone receptors known as "intracellular cholesterol sensors" because of their ability to bind to and be activated by oxysterols at circulating concentrations. Oxysterols are expressed in a tissue-specific manner and are generally at least 104 to 106-fold less abundant than cholesterol. Thus, the extraction and measurement of oxysterols from plasma and tissues are facilitated by the removal of bulk sterols by solid phase extraction prior to quantitative analysis by mass spectrometry. In this chapter we describe step by step methods for extracting and quantitating oxysterols from biological samples using electrospray ionization LC/MS/MS.
Oxysterols can contribute to proliferation of breast cancer through activation of the Estrogen Receptors, and to metastasis through activation of the Liver X Receptors. Endogenous levels of both esterified and free sidechain-hydroxylated oxysterols were examined in breast cancer tumours from Estrogen Receptor positive and negative breast tumours, using a novel fast liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry method. Multiple aliquots of five milligram samples of 22 tumours were analysed for oxysterol content to assess intra- and inter-tumour variation. Derivatization was performed with Girard T reagent (with and without alkaline hydrolysis) and sample clean-up was performed using a robust automatic on-line column switching system ("AFFL"). Oxysterols were separated isocratically on a 2.1 mm inner diameter column packed with ACE SuperPhenylHexyl core shell particles using a mobile phase consisting of 0.1% formic acid in H2O/methanol/acetonitrile (57/10/33, v/v/v) followed by a wash out step (0.1% formic acid in methanol/acetonitrile, 50/50, v/v). The total analysis time, including sample clean-up and column reconditioning, was 8 min (80% time reduction compared to other on-line systems). Analysis revealed large intra-tumour variations of sidechain oxysterols, resulting in no significant differences in endogenous oxysterols levels between Estrogen Receptor positive and Estrogen Receptor negative breast cancers. However, a correlation between esterified and free 27-hydroxycholesterol was observed. The same correlation was not observed for 24S-hydroxycholesterol or 25-hydroxycholesterol. The oxysterol heterogeneity of tumour tissue is a critical factor when assessing the role of these lipids in cancer.
Notwithstanding the researches on biomarkers and targeted therapies in renal cell carcinomas (RCC) have made progress in the last decades, the application of the biomarkers and targeted therapy agents for RCC in clinic are restricted because of their limitation or side effects. Liver X receptors (LXRs) and the NLRP3 inflammasome have been the research hotspots in recent years. In our study, we integrated bioinformatics analysis, molecular biology experiments and biological function experiments to study the roles of LXRα and the NLRP3 inflammasome in RCC. The study demonstrated that the elevated LXRα expression is correlated with a poor prognosis in RCC. Furthermore, our study revealed the expression levels and roles of the NLRP3 inflammasome in RCC for the first time. This research demonstrated that LXRα could promote the metastasis of RCC cells by suppressing the expression of the NLRP3 inflammasome. In Brief, LXRα had the possibility to be a novel diagnostic and prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target in renal cell cancer and LXRα could regulate the metastasis of renal cell cancer via NLRP3 inflammamsome.
Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most aggressive malignant brain tumor known with a poor survival rate despite current advances in the field of cancer. Additional research into the pathophysiology of GBM is urgently needed given the devastating nature of this disease. Recent studies have revealed the unique cellular physiology of GBM cells as compared with healthy astrocytes. Intriguingly, GBM cells are incapable of de novo cholesterol synthesis via the mevalonate pathway. Thus, the survival of GBM cells depends on cholesterol uptake via low-density lipoprotein receptors (LDLRs) in the form of apolipoprotein-E-containing lipoproteins and ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) that efflux surplus cholesterol out of cells. Liver X receptors regulate intracellular cholesterol levels in neurons and healthy astrocytes through changes in the expression of LDLR and ABCA1 in response to cholesterol and its derivatives. In GBM cells, due to the dysregulation of this surveillance pathway, there is an accumulation of intracellular cholesterol. Furthermore, intracellular cholesterol regulates temozolomide-induced cell death in glioblastoma cells via accumulation and activation of death receptor 5 in plasma membrane lipid rafts. The mevalonate pathway and autophagy flux are also fundamentally related with implications for cell health and death. Thus, via cholesterol metabolism, the mevalonate pathway may be a crucial player in the pathogenesis and treatment of GBM where our current understanding is still lacking. Targeting cholesterol metabolism in GBM may hold promise as a novel adjunctive clinical therapy for this devastating cancer.
Liver X receptors are recognized as important regulators of cholesterol, fatty acid metabolism, inflammatory responses, and glucose homeostasis. The antineoplastic properties of synthetic liver X receptor (LXR) agonists (T0901317 and GW3965) have been reported in human carcinomas. Epidermal growth factor tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR-TKI) is a first-line treatment for non-small-cell lung cancer patients with EGFR mutations. We used scratch and transwell assays to analyze cell migration and invasion. We evaluated tumor migration and invasion in vitro using a fluorescent orthotopic lung cancer model. An MMP9 (mouse) enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit was used to measure serum MMP9 concentrations. Protein expression was identified by western blot assays. In this study, we determined the effects of T0901317 and/or an EGFR-TKI on the lung cancer cell lines A549 and HCC827-8-1 in vitro and in vivo. We confirmed that the combination of the LXR agonist T0901317 and gefitinib can inhibit the migration and invasion of lung cancer both in vivo and in vitro, and this effect was possibly achieved by the inhibition of the ERK/MAPK signaling pathway. Our study showed that the combination of the LXR agonist T0901317 and gefitinib can inhibit the migration and invasion of lung cancer both in vivo and in vitro.
Cholesterol is essential for cell function and viability. It is a component of the plasma membrane and lipid rafts and is a precursor for bile acids, steroid hormones, and Vitamin D. As a ligand for estrogen-related receptor alpha (ESRRA), cholesterol becomes a signaling molecule. Furthermore, cholesterol-derived oxysterols activate liver X receptors (LXRs) or estrogen receptors (ERs). Several studies performed in cancer cells reveal that cholesterol synthesis is enhanced compared to normal cells. Additionally, high serum cholesterol levels are associated with increased risk for many cancers, but thus far, clinical trials with 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors (statins) have had mixed results. Statins inhibit cholesterol synthesis within cells through the inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase, the rate-limiting enzyme in the mevalonate and cholesterol synthetic pathway. Many downstream products of mevalonate have a role in cell proliferation, since they are required for maintenance of membrane integrity; signaling, as some proteins to be active must undergo prenylation; protein synthesis, as isopentenyladenine is an essential substrate for the modification of certain tRNAs; and cell-cycle progression. In this review starting from recent acquired findings on the role that cholesterol and its metabolites fulfill in the contest of cancer cells, we discuss the results of studies focused to investigate the use of statins in order to prevent cancer growth and metastasis.
Androgens and androgen receptor (AR, NR3C4) clearly play a crucial role in prostate cancer progression. Besides, the link between metabolic disorders and the risk of developing a prostate cancer has been emerging these last years. Interestingly, "lipid" nuclear receptors such as LXRα/NR1H3 and LXRβ/NR1H2 (as well as FXRα/NR1H4 and SHP/NR0B2) have been described to decrease the lipid metabolism, while AR increases it. Moreover, these former orphan nuclear receptors can regulate androgen levels and modulate AR activity. Thus, it is not surprising to find such receptors involved in the physiology of prostate. This review is focused on the roles of liver X receptors (LXRs), farnesoid X receptor (FXR), and small heterodimeric partner (SHP) in prostate physiology and their capabilities to interfere with the androgen-regulated pathways by modulating the levels of active androgen within the prostate. By the use of prostate cancer cell lines, mice deficient for these nuclear receptors and human tissue libraries, several authors have pointed out the putative possibility to pharmacologically target these receptors. These data open a new field of research for the development of new drugs that could overcome the castration resistance in prostate cancer, a usual phenomenon in patients.
Our study aimed to investigate the expression of NR1H3 in endometrial carcinoma, its effect on the proliferation of endometrial carcinoma cells in vitro, and the underlying mechanism of this effect.
Immunohistochemistry of paraffin-embedded, sectioned specimens and of a tissue microarray was conducted to estimate the expression of NR1H3 (liver X receptors α: LXRα) and NR1H2 (liver X receptors β: LXRβ) in endometrial carcinoma tissues. The subcellular localization of NR1H3 in the endometrial carcinoma cell line Ishikawa was determined by immunofluorescence. An agonist of NR1H3, TO901317, was then administered to activate the expression of NR1H3, and cell viability and cell-cycle progression were investigated through MTT and flow cytometric assays, respectively. The gene and protein expression levels of NR1H3, cyclin D1 (CCND1), and cyclin E (CCNE) in cells pretreated with different concentrations of TO901317 for different periods of time were also detected by real-time RT-PCR and Western blot, respectively.
The results showed that, in contrast to NR1H2, which was expressed at low levels in endometrial tissues, NR1H3 was upregulated in endometrial adenocarcinoma tissues compared to levels in normal endometrial tissues and endometrial polyps. Moreover, NR1H3 was mainly expressed in the cytoplasm of Ishikawa cells. TO901317 significantly decreased cell viability and arrested the cell cycle in Ishikawa cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Furthermore, the administration of TO901317 not only promoted the expression of NR1H3 but also inhibited the expression of CCND1 and CCNE in Ishikawa cells.
We demonstrated that NR1H3 is upregulated in endometrial adenocarcinoma and that it inhibits cell viability by inhibiting the expression of CCND1 and CCNE in endometrial carcinoma cells. Our study indicates that NR1H3 may play a role in the development of endometrial cancer and may emerge as a promising therapeutic target.
LXRα is a subtype of the liver X receptors (LXRs). There is accumulating evidence to support the involvement of LXRα in a variety of malignancies. However, the function and specific mechanism of LXRα in gastric cancer (GC) remain unclear. In this study, the expression of LXRα was significantly lower in poorly differentiated and undifferentiated GC tissues compared with well- and moderately differentiated GC tissues by immunohistochemistry analysis. The activation of LXRα leads to the decreased expression of β-catenin, CD44, and Cyclin D1, whereas the inhibition of LXRα has opposite effect. The same results were obtained in animal experiments. Furthermore, results showed that CD44 and Cyclin D1 expression significantly decreased when Wnt/β-catenin signaling was blocked in LXRα silent GC cells, whereas it was significantly increased when Wnt/β-catenin signaling was activated in LXRα over-expressed GC cells. CD44 and Cyclin D1, downstream targets of Wnt/β-catenin signaling, are specific markers for cell differentiation. Therefore, we conclude that LXRα may promote the differentiation of human GC cells through inactivation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling.
Oxysterols are derivatives of cholesterol and an important regulator of cholesterol metabolism, in part due to their role as ligands for nuclear receptors, such as the liver X receptors. Oxysterols are also known to be ligands for the RAR-related orphan receptors, involved in normal T cell differentiation. However, increasing evidence supports a role for oxysterols in the progression of several diseases. Here, we review recent developments in oxysterol research, highlighting the biological functions that oxysterols exert through their target nuclear receptors: the liver X receptors, estrogen receptors, RAR-related orphan receptors and the glucocorticoid receptor. We also bring the regulation of the immune system into the context of interaction between oxysterols and nuclear receptors, discussing the effect of such interaction on the pro-inflammatory function of macrophages and the development of T cells. Finally, we examine the impact that oxysterols have on various disease models, including cancer, Alzheimer's disease and atherosclerosis, stressing the role of nuclear receptors if previously identified. This review underscores the need to consider the multifaceted roles of oxysterols in terms of multiple receptor engagements and selective modulation of these receptors.
Retinoid X receptor (RXR) ligands have a wide range of beneficial effects in mouse models of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Recently accumulated evidence suggests that early neuroinflammation may be a therapeutic target for AD treatment. We therefore investigated the anti-inflammatory effects of the prenylated flavanoids SPF1 and SPF2, which were previously isolated from root of Sophora tonkinensis and identified as potent ligands for RXR, and potential mechanisms involved. SPF1 and SPF2 efficiently reduced interleukin (IL)-1β messenger RNA (mRNA) and IL-6 mRNA levels in lipopolysaccharide-stimulated and tumor necrosis factor-α-stimulated RAW264.7 cells, whereas SPF3-which has a structure similar to SPF1 and SPF2 but no RXR ligand activity-did not exhibit such effects. Intriguingly, the liver X receptor (LXR) ligand T0901317 reduced proinflammatory cytokine mRNA levels, and these effects were potentiated by SPF1. With regard to the mechanism underlying the anti-inflammatory effects, SPF1 induced significant amounts of activating transcription factor 3 (ATF3) mRNA and protein, and this effect was potentiated by T0901317. SPF1 also reduced translocation of nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) into nuclei. The production of proinflammatory cytokines was significantly inhibited by SPF1, and this effect was primarily exerted via RXR/LXR heterodimers. The effects of SPF1 may partly depend on the induction of ATF3, which may bind to the p65 subunit of NF-κB, resulting in reduced translocation of NF-κB into nuclei and reduced NF-κB transcription. Although inflammatory effects mediated by RXR/LXR heterodimers have not been thoroughly investigated, the above-described results shed light on the mechanism of the anti-inflammatory effect via RXR/LXR heterodimer.
The liver X receptors Lxrα/NR1H3 and Lxrβ/NR1H2 are ligand-dependent nuclear receptors critical for midbrain dopaminergic (mDA) neuron development. We found previously that 24(S),25-epoxycholesterol (24,25-EC), the most potent and abundant Lxr ligand in the developing mouse midbrain, promotes mDA neurogenesis in vitro In this study, we demonstrate that 24,25-EC promotes mDA neurogenesis in an Lxr-dependent manner in the developing mouse midbrain in vivo and also prevents toxicity induced by the Lxr inhibitor geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate. Furthermore, using MS, we show that overexpression of human cholesterol 24S-hydroxylase (CYP46A1) increases the levels of both 24(S)-hydroxycholesterol (24-HC) and 24,25-EC in the developing midbrain, resulting in a specific increase in mDA neurogenesis in vitro and in vivo, but has no effect on oculomotor or red nucleus neurogenesis. 24-HC, unlike 24,25-EC, did not affect in vitro neurogenesis, indicating that the neurogenic effect of 24,25-EC on mDA neurons is specific. Combined, our results indicate that increased levels of 24,25-EC in vivo, by intracerebroventricular delivery in WT mice or by overexpression of its biosynthetic enzyme CYP46A1, specifically promote mDA neurogenesis. We propose that increasing the levels of 24,25-EC in vivo may be a useful strategy to combat the loss of mDA neurons in Parkinson's disease.
Nephrolithiasis is a common disease of the urinary system, of which idiopathic calcium oxalate (CaOx) kidney stones, in particular, are one of the special types. In the initial stages of CaOx kidney stone formation, Randall's plaques (RPs) develop. Liver X receptors (LXRs) inhibit oxidative stress and inﬂammatory in other diseases; nevertheless, the role of LXRs in nephrolithiasis has yet to be elucidated. In this study, the role of LXRs in the progression of RP formation was investigated. Microarray analysis revealed that LXR/RXR levels were significantly greater in low-plaque tissues (&lt;5%) than in high-plaque tissues (&gt;5%), confirming the link between LXR activation and RP formation. Correspondingly, expression levels of two LXR target genes, LXRα and LXRβ, were lower in high-plaque tissues than in low-plaque tissues. In vitro, LXR agonist alleviated calcium oxalate monohydrate-induced cellular calcium deposits and apoptosis. LXR activation decreased reactive oxygen species production and gene expression of inflammatory mediators, including osteopontin that has recently been demonstrated to correlate with the development of RPs. Moreover, p38 MAPK and JNK signaling may mediate LXR-regulated expression in HK-2 cells. In an animal model, the deposition was reduced by activating LXR, and osteopontin expression was also inhibited. Our findings suggest a role for LXRs in the progression of idiopathic CaOx kidney stones; LXR agonists may have therapeutic potential for the treatment of nephrolithiasis.
Gammaherpesviruses are ubiquitous viruses that establish lifelong infections. Importantly, these viruses are associated with numerous cancers and lymphoproliferative diseases. While risk factors for developing gammaherpesvirus-driven cancers are poorly understood, it is clear that elevated viral reactivation from latency often precedes oncogenesis. Here, we demonstrate that the liver X receptor alpha isoform (LXRα) restricts gammaherpesvirus reactivation in an anatomic-site-specific manner. We have previously demonstrated that deficiency of both LXR isoforms (α and β) leads to an increase in fatty acid and cholesterol synthesis in primary macrophage cultures, with a corresponding increase in gammaherpesvirus replication. Interestingly, expression of fatty acid synthesis genes was not derepressed in LXRα-deficient hosts, indicating that the antiviral effects of LXRα are independent of lipogenesis. Additionally, the critical host defenses against gammaherpesvirus reactivation, virus-specific CD8+ T cells and interferon (IFN) signaling, remained intact in the absence of LXRα. Remarkably, using a murine gammaherpesvirus 68 (MHV68) reporter virus, we discovered that LXRα expression dictates the cellular tropism of MHV68 in the peritoneal cavity. Specifically, LXRα-/- mice exhibit reduced latency within the peritoneal B cell compartment and elevated latency within F4/80+ cells. Thus, LXRα restricts gammaherpesvirus reactivation through a novel mechanism that is independent of the known CD8+ T cell-based antiviral responses or changes in lipid synthesis and likely involves changes in the tropism of MHV68 in the peritoneal cavity.IMPORTANCE Liver X receptors (LXRs) are nuclear receptors that mediate cholesterol and fatty acid homeostasis. Importantly, as ligand-activated transcription factors, LXRs represent potential targets for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia and atherosclerosis. Here, we demonstrate that LXRα, one of the two LXR isoforms, restricts reactivation of latent gammaherpesvirus from peritoneal cells. As gammaherpesviruses are ubiquitous oncogenic agents, LXRs may represent a targetable host factor for the treatment of poorly controlled gammaherpesvirus infection and associated lymphomagenesis.
Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors (IP3 Rs) are a family of ubiquitously expressed intracellular Ca(2+) release channels. Regulation of channel activity by Ca(2+) , nucleotides, phosphorylation, protein binding partners and other cellular factors is thought to play a major role in defining the specific spatiotemporal characteristics of intracellular Ca(2+) signals. These properties are, in turn, believed pivotal for the selective and specific physiological activation of Ca(2+) -dependent effectors. IP3 Rs are also substrates for the intracellular cysteine proteases, calpain and caspase. Cleavage of the IP3 R has been proposed to play a role in apoptotic cell death by uncoupling regions important for IP3 binding from the channel domain, leaving an unregulated leaky Ca(2+) pore. Contrary to this hypothesis, we demonstrate following proteolysis that N- and C-termini of IP3 R1 remain associated, presumably through non-covalent interactions. Further, we show that complementary fragments of IP3 R1 assemble into tetrameric structures and retain their ability to be regulated robustly by IP3 . While peptide continuity is clearly not necessary for IP3 -gating of the channel, we propose that cleavage of the IP3 R peptide chain may alter other important regulatory events to modulate channel activity. In this scenario, stimulation of the cleaved IP3 R may support distinct spatiotemporal Ca(2+) signals and activation of specific effectors. Notably, in many adaptive physiological events, the non-apoptotic activities of caspase and calpain are demonstrated to be important, but the substrates of the proteases are poorly defined. We speculate that proteolytic fragmentation may represent a novel form of IP3 R regulation, which plays a role in varied adaptive physiological processes.
Nuclear steroid hormone receptors are ubiquitously expressed transcription factors whose activity can be altered by post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation. The consequences of post-translational modifications have been described for several members of the nuclear steroid hormone receptor superfamily; however, little is known about the effects of oestrogen receptor (ER)β phosphorylation in the brain. Moreover, to our knowledge, the presence of phosphorylated ERβ has not been detected in the brain of any species to date. Oestrogen receptor β is highly expressed in several regions of the brain and in vitro studies have demonstrated that it can be phosphorylated at two serine residues (S87 and S105) in the N-terminal AF-1 region. The present study aimed to determine whether phosphorylated ERβ is detectable in the hippocampus of aged female rats, as well as the functional consequences of ERβ S87 and S105 phosphorylation on transcriptional activity in neuronal cells. First, we used a novel PhosTag(™) approach to detect phosphorylated forms of ERβ in the dorsal hippocampus of aged female rats. The data obtained demonstrated abundant forms of phosphorylated ERβ in the dorsal hippocampus, suggesting that this post-translational modification might be an important regulator of ERβ function. To assess the functional consequences of ERβ phosphorylation in neuronal cells, we created phospho-mimetic (S87E, S105E) and phospho-null (S87A, S105A) ERβ receptors that were transiently transfected in a hippocampal-derived cell line. Collectively, our results showed that phosphorylation of S87 and S105 altered both ligand-independent and ligand-dependent ERβ transcriptional regulation. Overall, these data demonstrate that phosphorylated forms of ERβ are present in the brain of aged female rats and that phosphorylation of ERβ could differentially alter ERβ-mediated gene expression. 
The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) is a ubiquitously expressed receptor/transcription factor that mediates toxicological responses of environmental contaminants such as 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD). Emerging evidence indicates that the AhR suppresses apoptosis and proliferation independent of exogenous ligands, including suppression of apoptosis by cigarette smoke, a key risk factor for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). As cigarette smoke is a potent inducer of oxidative stress, a feature that may contribute to the development of COPD, we hypothesized that the AhR prevents smoke-induced apoptosis by regulating oxidative stress. Utilizing primary lung fibroblasts derived from AhR(+/+) and AhR(-/-) mice as well as A549 human lung adenocarcinoma cells deficient in AhR expression (A549-AhR(ko)), we first show that AhR(-/-) fibroblasts and A549-AhR(ko) epithelial cells have a significant increase in cigarette smoke extract (CSE)-induced oxidative stress compared to wild type. CSE induced a significant increase in the mRNA expression of key antioxidant genes, including Nqo1 and Srxn1, predominantly in AhR(+/+) fibroblasts, with significantly less induction in AhR(-/-) cells. The induction of Srxn1, but not Nqo1, was independent of dioxin-response element (DRE) binding as AhR(DBD/DBD) lung fibroblasts, which express an AhR incapable of binding the DRE, increased Srxn1 to a degree similar to wild-type cells in response to CSE. There was no difference in Nrf2 expression or activation based on AhR expression. Lung fibroblasts derived from COPD subjects have significantly less AhR protein expression compared with both never-smokers (Normal) and smokers (At Risk). Consequently, COPD-derived fibroblasts were less robust in their induction of both Nqo1 and Srxn1 mRNA after exposure to CSE, which also failed to activate the AhR in the COPD fibroblasts. Taken together, these results support a new role for the AhR in regulating antioxidant defense in lung structural cells, such that low AhR expression may facilitate the development or progression of COPD. 
Liver X Receptor (LXR) plays a pivotal role in metabolic regulation in mammals, but little is known about its function in fish. In this study, two lxra isoforms, namely lxra1 and lxra2, were isolated. Their molecular characterization, tissues distribution and transcriptional regulation by insulin in vivo and in vitro were determined. lxrα1 and lxrα2 cDNA covered 2775bp and 3093bp, encoding 446 and 515 amino acid residues, respectively. The protein sequence of yellow catfish lxra included characteristic feature of mammalian lxrs, including the DNA binding (DBD) (containing P-box), ligand binding (LBD) and activation function-2 (AF-2) domains, D-box, and D (hinge) region. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that yellow catfish lxra grouped with lxra of zebrafish but was distant from those of medaka and stickleback. lxrβ clades was absent in teleosts in phylogenetic tree, proving gene loss of lxrβ in teleosts during evolution. The two lxra isoforms (lxra1 and lxra2) mRNAs were ubiquitously expressed in 11 tested tissues. Compared to lxra2, lxra1 mRNA expression was predominant in all tested tissues. The expression of lxrα1 was the highest in testis, then in liver, and the lowest in other tissues. lxrα2 expression was the highest in liver, then in testis, and the lowest in ovary. Insulin significantly stimulated the mRNA expression of lxra1 in vitro and in vivo, while the expression of lxra2 remained unchanged after insulin treatment. The present study serves to increase our understanding into the function of lxra in fish. 
CD44 is a transmembrane receptor for hyaluronic acid. CD44 pre-mRNA contains 19 exons, 9 of which are alternatively spliced. Among the CD44 spliced variants, the v4-7 variant, one of the v6 exon-containing isoforms that contains variable exon 4, 5, 6 and 7, confers metastatic potential to non-metastatic cells. Splicing of CD44 and the function of CD44 isoforms are different in breast cancer cells. hnRNP A1 is a ubiquitously expressed protein with an inhibitory function in pre-mRNA splicing. We showed that CD44v6 isoform, which includes all of the v6-containing mRNA isoforms, had the highest expression level in non-metatatic breast cancer cells (MCF7) when compared to the level in metastatic breast cancer cells (MDA-MB-231) and normal breast cells (MCF10A). Furthermore we showed that hnRNP A1 knockdown regulated splicing of CD44 differently in breast cancer cells. We showed here that CD44 isoform expression is completely different in MDA-MB-231 cells than that in MCF7 and MCF10A cells, whereas MCF7 and MCF10A cells had a similar expression pattern of CD44 isoforms. RT-PCR analysis of CD44v6 showed that MCF7 and MCF10A cells predominantly expressed the c5v6v7v8v9v10c6 isoform. However, in addition to this isoform, MDA-MB-231 cells also expressed the c5v6v8v9v10c6 and c5v6c6 isoforms. We also found that knockdown of hnRNP A1 significantly reduced the expression of c5v6v7v8v9v10c6 and c5v6v8v9v10c6, and promoted the expression of c5v6c6. hnRNP A1 knockdown significantly induced cell death. In addition, hnRNP A1 knockdown induced a decrease in cell invasion in the MDA-MB-231 cells. Our results indicate that the knockdown of hnRNP A1 has a specific function on the splicing of CD44 in breast cancer cells. 
The organismal roles of the ubiquitously expressed class I PI3K isoform p110β remain largely unknown. Using a new kinase-dead knockin mouse model that mimics constitutive pharmacological inactivation of p110β, we document that full inactivation of p110β leads to embryonic lethality in a substantial fraction of mice. Interestingly, the homozygous p110β kinase-dead mice that survive into adulthood (maximum ~26% on a mixed genetic background) have no apparent phenotypes, other than subfertility in females and complete infertility in males. Systemic inhibition of p110β results in a highly specific blockade in the maturation of spermatogonia to spermatocytes. p110β was previously suggested to signal downstream of the c-kit tyrosine kinase receptor in germ cells to regulate their proliferation and survival. We now report that p110β also plays a germ cell-extrinsic role in the Sertoli cells (SCs) that support the developing sperm, with p110β inactivation dampening expression of the SC-specific Androgen Receptor (AR) target gene Rhox5, a homeobox gene critical for spermatogenesis. All extragonadal androgen-dependent functions remain unaffected by global p110β inactivation. In line with a crucial role for p110β in SCs, selective inactivation of p110β in these cells results in male infertility. Our study is the first documentation of the involvement of a signalling enzyme, PI3K, in the regulation of AR activity during spermatogenesis. This developmental pathway may become active in prostate cancer where p110β and AR have previously been reported to functionally interact. 
Prohibitin (PHB) is a ubiquitously expressed and highly conserved protein that participates in diverse cellular processes, and its functions are linked to a variety of diseases. In the present study, to explore transcriptional activation and signaling pathways involved in PHB regulation in response to sex hormone treatment, we investigated the effects of estrogen (17-β-estradiol, E2) on regulation of PHB in several metabolic tissues from male and female rats. Elevated expression of PHB was prominent in white adipose tissue (WAT) and the liver, and E2 stimulated PHB expression in both ND and HFD-fed rats. To further confirm the expression of PHB which was increased in WAT and the liver, we analyzed PHB expression levels in 3T3-L1 and C9 cells after the treatment of E2. Transcription and protein levels of PHB were dose-dependently increased by E2 treatment in both cell types, supporting our in vivo data. To further evaluate the possible role of E2 in elevation of PHB via estrogen receptors (ER), the potent ER inhibitor fulvestrant was treated to 3T3-L1 and C9 cells. Fulvestrant markedly suppressed both transcription and protein levels of PHB, suggesting that PHB expression in both tissues may be regulated through ERs. GeneMANIA, a predictive web interface, was used to show that Phb is regulated via the intracellular steroid hormone receptor signaling pathway, suggesting a role for ERs in expression of Phb as well as other metabolically important genes. Based on these results, we expect that targeting PHB would be a useful therapeutic approach for treatment of obesity. 
Myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88) is an adapter protein involved in the interleukin-1 receptor (IL-1R) and Toll-like receptor (TLR)-mediated activation of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-κB). In this study, a full length cDNA of MyD88 was cloned from turbot, Scophthalmus maximus. It is 1619 bp in length and contains an 858-bp open reading frame that encodes a peptide of 285 amino acid residues. The putative turbot (Sm)MyD88 protein possesses a N-terminal death domain and a C-terminal Toll/IL-1 receptor (TIR) domain known to be important for the functions of MyD88 in mammals. Phylogenetic analysis grouped SmMyD88 with other fish MyD88s. SmMyD88 mRNA was ubiquitously expressed in all examined tissues of healthy turbots, with higher levels observed in immune-relevant organs. To explore the role of SmMyD88, its gene expression profile in response to stimulation of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), CpG oligodeoxynucleotide (CpG-ODN) or turbot reddish body iridovirus (TRBIV) was studied in the head kidney, spleen, gills and muscle over a 7-day time course. The results showed an up-regulation of SmMyD88 transcript levels by the three immunostimulants in all four examined tissues, with the induction by CpG-ODN strongest and initiated earliest and inducibility in the muscle very weak. Additionally, TRBIV challenge resulted in a quite high level of SmMyD88 expression in the spleen, whereas the two synthetic immunostimulants induced the higher levels in the head kidney. These data provide insights into the roles of SmMyD88 in the TLR/IL-1R signaling pathway of the innate immune system in turbot. 
Vitamin D is an antiproliferative and differentiation-promoting secosteroid hormone with pleiotropic homeostatic functions in bone and extraskeletal tissues. Signaling of vitamin D is mediated via its ubiquitously expressed nuclear receptor, the vitamin D receptor (VDR). Pancreatic stellate cells have recently been identified as targets of vitamin D action. Our aim was to elucidate the effectiveness of the most potent endogenous vitamin D metabolite, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1,25(OH)2D3] on the proliferation and extracellular matrix (ECM) protein expression in pancreatic stellate cells (PSCs) using concentrations of the compound from the physiological and clinically attainable range in humans.
Culture-activated mouse PSCs were exposed to 1,25(OH)2D3 concentrations ranging from 0.1 nM to 10 nM for 7 days and subjected to colorimetric crystal violet assay for cell growth assessment and to Western blot and immunohistochemical analyses of VDR, fibronectin and collagen I using protein-specific antibodies. Immunohistochemical localization of VDR was performed on mouse pancreatic tissue and on a set of human specimens obtained at pancreatic surgery.
A low basal level of VDR was detected in PSCs that was strongly induced in the presence of ligand. Cell growth was suppressed dose-dependently by 1,25(OH)2D3, the mean percentages of inhibition ranging from 24% at the physiological 0.1 nM concentration to around 60% at 10 nM. Significant 48% and 40% reductions in fibronectin expression were seen at 0.5 nM and 1 nM 1,25(OH)2D3. A minor decrease in collagen I expression was detected at 5 nM. VDR was predominantly localized in the islets of Langerhans in mouse and human tissues. In the latter VDR was expressed also in the exocrine tissue showing individual variation in its cellular distribution.
Mouse PSCs express VDR protein and are sensitive 1,25(OH)2D3 target cells with low levels of 1,25(OH)2D3 exerting antiproliferative and antifibrotic effects on activated PSCs in vitro.
Myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88) is the classic signaling adaptor that mediates Toll/interleukin-1 receptor (TIR/IL-1R) dependent activation of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB). In this study, two naturally truncated MyD88 members were identified from the Pacific oyster (Crassostrea gigas), namely CgMyD88-T1 and CgMyD88-T2. The full-length cDNA of CgMyD88-T1, CgMyD88-T2 are 976 bp and 1038 bp in length, containing an ORF of 552 bp and 555 bp, respectively. The two ORF encode a putative protein of 183 and 184 amino acids, respectively, with a calculated molecular weight of about 21 and 22 kDa. When compared to complete MyD88 paralogues, we found that both CgMyD88-T1 and CgMyD88-T2 contain only TIR domain but lack DD (Death Domain), which share 90.8% of similarity and 71.7% of identity with each other. Phylogenetic tree demonstrated that CgMyD88-T1 and CgMyD88-T2 clustered together and belonged to mollusk branch. Meanwhile, genomic arrangement analysis displayed that the two truncated MyD88s were distributed in tandem in one scaffold, revealing that they may originate from one truncated MyD88 ancestor recently. Expression profile showed that both of CgMyD88 variants were ubiquitously expressed in all tested tissues with highest expression in the gills and hemocytes, respectively. Both truncated CgMyD88 mRNAs were significantly up-regulated in hemocytes under HKLM (heat-killed Listeria monocytogenes) and HKVA (heat-killed Vibrio alginolyticus) challenge. Moreover, either CgMyD88-T1 or CgMyD88-T2 were able to inhibit MyD88 activated Rel/NF-κB activity in HEK293 cell, demonstrating their negative role in regulating MyD88-mediated immune signaling.
Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor β/δ (PPARβ/δ) is a ubiquitously expressed gene with higher levels observed in skeletal muscle. Recently, our laboratory showed (Bonala S, Lokireddy S, Arigela H, Teng S, Wahli W, Sharma M, McFarlane C, Kambadur R. J Biol Chem 287: 12935-12951, 2012) that PPARβ/δ modulates myostatin activity to induce myogenesis in skeletal muscle. In the present study, we show that PPARβ/δ-null mice display reduced body weight, skeletal muscle weight, and myofiber atrophy during postnatal development. In addition, a significant reduction in satellite cell number was observed in PPARβ/δ-null mice, suggesting a role for PPARβ/δ in muscle regeneration. To investigate this, tibialis anterior muscles were injured with notexin, and muscle regeneration was monitored on days 3, 5, 7, and 28 postinjury. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed an increased inflammatory response and reduced myoblast proliferation in regenerating muscle from PPARβ/δ-null mice. Histological analysis confirmed that the regenerated muscle fibers of PPARβ/δ-null mice maintained an atrophy phenotype with reduced numbers of centrally placed nuclei. Even though satellite cell numbers were reduced before injury, satellite cell self-renewal was found to be unaffected in PPARβ/δ-null mice after regeneration. Previously, our laboratory had showed (Bonala S, Lokireddy S, Arigela H, Teng S, Wahli W, Sharma M, McFarlane C, Kambadur R. J Biol Chem 287: 12935-12951, 2012) that inactivation of PPARβ/δ increases myostatin signaling and inhibits myogenesis. Our results here indeed confirm that inactivation of myostatin signaling rescues the atrophy phenotype and improves muscle fiber cross-sectional area in both uninjured and regenerated tibialis anterior muscle from PPARβ/δ-null mice. Taken together, these data suggest that absence of PPARβ/δ leads to loss of satellite cells, impaired skeletal muscle regeneration, and postnatal myogenesis. Furthermore, our results also demonstrate that functional antagonism of myostatin has utility in rescuing these effects.
