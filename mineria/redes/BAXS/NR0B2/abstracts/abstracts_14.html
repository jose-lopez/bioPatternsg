<!DOCTYPE html><html><head>	<meta charset="utf-8">	<title>generación de archivo html</title></head><body>Heart rate (HR) recovery (HRR) reflects autonomic activity and predicts cardiovascular events. The aim of this study was to assess HRR in patients with myocardial bridge (MB).
Medical recordings of 93 patients with MB and appropriate age, compared to 78 sex-matched healthy subjects were analyzed. MB was diagnosed via coronary computed tomography angiography after a positive exercise stress test (EST). HRR indices were calculated by subtracting 1st (HRR1), 2nd (HRR2) and 3rd (HRR3) minute HR from the maximal HR during EST.
HRR1 (30.2 ± 13.3 bpm vs. 35.8 ± 10.4 bpm, p = 0.001) and HRR2 (52.3 ± 13.3 bpm vs. 57.1 ± 11.6 bpm, p = 0.013) were lower in patients with MB. In addition, HRR1 was lower in patients with left anterior descending (LAD) MB than non-LAD MB (28.5 ± 13.2 vs. 37.1 ± 11.4, p = 0.013). Presence of MB, deep MB, LAD MB and multi-vessel MB were predictors of HRR1 (p &lt; 0.01 for all). In a multivariate analysis, LAD MB was the only significant independent predictor of HRR1 (b = -8.524, p = 0.009).
Patients with MB have impairment in HRR indices which is more pronounced among patients with LAD MB. Cardiac autonomic dysfunction in MB might be due to recurrent myocardial ischemia.
To determine the relationship between central adiposity parameters and autonomic nervous system (ANS) dysfunction.
The study included 114 obese individuals without any cardiovascular risk factors. Weight (in kg), height (in m), and waist circumference (WC; in cm) were measured and body mass index was calculated. Echocardiographic examination was performed to measure left ventricular mass and epicardial fat thickness (EFT). All the participants underwent an exercise test and electrophysiological evaluation using electromyography. Heart rate recovery (HRR) at 1-5 min, R-R interval variation at rest and during hyperventilation, and sympathetic skin response were measured. Pearson's correlation analysis was used. Multiple linear regression analysis was used to identify the factors associated with autonomic dysfunction.
The HRR at 1-5 min was negatively correlated with WC and age (WC-HRR1: r = -0.32; WC-HRR2: r = -0.31; WC-HRR3: r = -0.26; WC-HRR4: r = -0.23; WC-HRR5: r = -0.21; age-HRR2: r = -0.32; age-HRR3: r = -0.28; age-HRR4: r = -0.41; age-HRR5: r = -0.42). Age was the only independent predictor of reduced HRR at 1-5 min. In addition, WC predicted a reduced HRR at 3 min. There were no significant associations between central obesity and electrophysiological parameters. EFT was not associated with ANS dysfunction.
In this study, central adiposity and aging were associated with ANS dysfunction in obese individuals. The WC could be a marker of ANS dysfunction in obese individuals without any cardiovascular risk factors. The HRR assessment at a later decay phase could be more valuable for evaluating ANS function than during early recovery.
Patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) have an increased risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD) with poor parasympathetic function being implicated as an underlying factor. Factors related to parasympathetic function, commonly assessed by heart rate recovery (HRR) following maximal exercise, are currently not known in RA. We aimed to explore the association between HRR with CVD risk factors, inflammatory markers, and wellbeing in patients with RA.
Ninety-six RA patients (54.4 ± 12.6 years, 68 % women) completed a treadmill exercise test, during which heart rate (HR) was monitored. HRR1 and HRR2 were defined as the absolute change from HR peak to HRR 1 min post HR peak and 2 min post HR peak, respectively. Cardiorespiratory fitness, CVD risk factors, and serological markers of inflammation were measured in all patients. The Framingham Risk Score (FRS) was used as an assessment of global risk for CVD events, and wellbeing was assessed by questionnaires.
Mean HRR1 and HRR2 were 29.1 ± 13.2 bpm and 46.4 ± 15.3 bpm, respectively. CVD risk factors as well as most inflammatory markers and measures of wellbeing were inversely correlated with HRR1 and HRR2. Multivariate regression analyses revealed that 27.9 % of the variance in HRR1 and 37.9 % of the variance in HRR2 was explained collectively by CVD risk factors, measures of inflammation, and wellbeing (p = 0.009, p = 0.001 respectively), however no individual measure was independently associated with HRR1 or HRR2.
Parasympathetic activation was associated with overall CVD risk, arthritis-related burden and wellbeing in patients with RA.

In this study we aimed to investigate heart rate recovery (HRR) in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).
A total of 40 patients with IBD and 30 healthy controls were included in this study. A treadmill stress test was performed in all the patients to calculate the HRR index based on the age-specific maximum heart rate. The HRR indices were calculated as follows: HRR1, 2, 3, 4, 5 = heart rate at peak exercise - heart rate at 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 min. The independent samples t test was used to compare HRR indices between the patient and control groups. The Pearson correlation coefficient was used to examine the association between the duration of IBD and the HRR indices. Multivariate regression analysis was carried out to identify predictors of impaired HRR in patients with IBD.
HRR indices at various time intervals were significantly lower in the patients with IBD than in the controls: HRR1 (1.18 ± 8 vs. 31 ± 7, p &lt; 0.001), HRR2 (36 ± 12 vs. 51 ± 8, p &lt; 0.001), HRR3 (46 ± 12 vs. 62 ± 11, p &lt; 0.001), HRR4 (54 ± 7 vs. 65 ± 8, p &lt; 0.001), and HRR5 (55 ± 13 vs. 71 ± 15, p &lt; 0.001). Mean duration of IBD was 7.8 ± 3.6 years. In addition, there was a significant negative correlation between disease duration and HRR at the first minute (r = -0.704, p &lt; 0.001). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that symptom duration (OR: 1.742, 95% CI: 1.148-2.636, p = 0.009) was an independent predictor of impaired HRR in patients with IBD.
In this study, the data showed that the HRR was impaired in patients with IBDs. Hence, given the prognostic value of the test, patients with IBD should be monitored for future cardiovascular events.
It is generally well-understood that iron-mediated cardiomyopathy is the major complication that can arise from beta thalassemia major (TM). Therefore, early diagnosis, risk stratification, and the effective treatment of beta TM patients are clinically important to optimize long-term positive outcomes.
This study included 57 beta TM patients with a mean age of 25 ± 7 years. We determined the serum ferritin level, echocardiography, heart rate recovery (HRR), and cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) T2* in all patients. CMR T2* findings were categorized as normal myocardium (T2* &gt; 20 ms), and myocardial involvement (T2* ≤ 20 ms). HRR values at 1-5 min (HRR1-5) were recorded; Subsequently. HRR was calculated by subtracting the heart rate at each time point from the heart rate at peak exercise.
There was a significant negative correlation between the serum ferritin level and the cardiac T2* MRI findings (r = -0.34, p = 0.009). A similar result was found in the negative correlation between serum ferritin and all heart rate recovery values. There was a significant positive correlation between HRR1, HRR2, and HRR3 values, and CMR T2* (T2* heart rate recovery (HRR)1: r = 0.51, p &lt; 0.001; T2* HRR2: r = 0.48, p &lt; 0.001; T2* HRR3: r = 0.47, p &lt; 0.001, respectively).
The serum ferritin level and echocardiography can be used to predict the presence of myocardial iron load in beta TM patients. Therefore, HRR can be used to screen beta TM patients, and the clinical use of HRR can be a predictive marker for autonomic dysfunction in beta TM patients.

Hepatic encephalopathy describes the array of neurological complications that arise due to liver insufficiency and/or portal-systemic shunt. The pathogenesis of hepatic encephalopathy shares a longstanding association with hyperammonemia and inflammation. Recently, aberrant bile acid signaling has been implicated in the development of key features of hepatic encephalopathy due to acute liver failure including neuronal dysfunction, neuroinflammation and blood-brain barrier permeability. This review summarizes the findings of recent studies demonstrating a role for bile acids in hepatic encephalopathy and speculates on the possible downstream consequences of bile acid signaling.
The farnesoid X receptor (FXR) is a ligand-activated transcription factor that regulates genes involved in bile acid metabolism. Accumulating data demonstrate that FXR has an anti-inflammatory activity. The present study aimed to investigate the effect of obeticholic acid (OCA), a novel synthetic FXR agonist, on D-galactosamine (GalN)/lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-evoked acute liver injury. All mice except controls were intraperitoneally injected with GalN (300 mg/kg) plus LPS (2.5 μg/kg). Some mice were pretreated with OCA (10 mg/kg) 48, 24 and 1 h before GalN/LPS. As expected, pretreatment with OCA alleviated hepatocyte apoptosis at early and middle stages of GalN/LPS-induced acute liver failure. By contrast, pretreatment with OCA augmented hepatic injury and inflammatory cell infiltration at middle stage of GalN/LPS-induced acute liver failure. Additional experiment found that OCA inhibited hepatic NF-κB activation at early and middle stages of GalN/LPS-induced acute liver failure. Interestingly, OCA inhibited hepatic proinflammatory cytokine tnf-α and il-6 but upregulated hepatic anti-inflammatory cytokine il-10 at early stage of GalN/LPS-induced acute liver failure. By contrast, OCA suppressed hepatic anti-inflammatory cytokine tgf-β and il-10 at middle stage of GalN/LPS-induced acute liver injury. These results suggest that FXR agonist OCA differentially regulates hepatic injury and inflammation at different stages of GalN/LPS-evoked acute liver failure.
The management of lead (Pb) exposure and toxicity remains a major public health priority worldwide. In our previous study, the probiotic strain Lactobacillus plantarum CCFM8661 prevented Pb absorption in mice via intestinal sequestration. This follow-up study aimed to evaluate the additional protective mechanism of L. plantarum CCFM8661 with a focus on its regulation of enterohepatic circulation. We first confirmed the relationship between the enterohepatic circulations of Pb and bile acid (BA) by administering a BA sequestrant, cholestyramine, to mice with a high Pb burden. Our data further showed that L. plantarum CCFM8661 significantly induced hepatic BA synthesis, enhanced bile flow and biliary glutathione output, and increased fecal BA excretion in the mice, which in turn increased biliary Pb output and enhanced fecal Pb excretion. This regulation was associated with the alterations in the expression of target genes in the enterohepatic farnesoid X receptor-fibroblast growth factor (FXR-FGF15) axis and could be reversed using an FXR agonist, GW4064. Pre-treatment with antibiotics also abolished the L. plantarum CCFM8661-induced effects on BA and Pb enterohepatic circulation. These results suggest that L. plantarum CCFM8661 induces fecal Pb excretion by regulating BA enterohepatic circulation. This regulation is associated with the down-regulation of the FXR-FGF15 axis and is partly dependent on the gut microbiota of mice.
Liver regeneration following partial hepatectomy (PHx) is a complicated process involving multiple organs and several types of signaling networks. The bile acid-activated metabolic pathways occupy an auxiliary yet important chapter in the entire biochemical story. PHx is characterized by rapid but transient bile acid overload in the liver, which constitutes the first wave of proliferative signaling in the remnant hepatocytes. Bile acids trigger hepatocyte proliferation through activation of several nuclear receptors. Following biliary passage into the intestines, enterocytes reabsorb the bile acids, which results in the activation of farnesoid X receptor (FXR), the consequent excretion of fibroblast growth factor (FGF)19/FGF15, and its release into the enterohepatic circulation. FGF19/FGF15 subsequently binds to its cognate receptor, fibroblast growth factor receptor 4 (FGFR4) complexed with β-klotho, on the hepatocyte membrane, which initiates the second wave of proliferative signaling. Because some bile acids are toxic, the remnant hepatocytes must resolve the potentially detrimental state of bile acid excess. Therefore, the hepatocytes orchestrate a bile acid detoxification and elimination response as a protective mechanism in concurrence with the proliferative signaling. The response in part results in the excretion of (biotransformed) bile acids into the canalicular system, causing the bile acids to end up in the intestines.
Recently, FXR agonists have been shown to promote regeneration via the gut-liver axis. This type of pharmacological intervention may prove beneficial for patients with hepatobiliary tumors undergoing PHx. In light of these developments, the review provides an in-depth account of the pathways that underlie post-PHx liver regeneration in the context of bile acid homeostasis in the liver and the gut-liver signaling axis.
Fibroblast growth factor 15 (FGF15) was previously identified to be highly expressed in the ileum and functions as an endocrine factor to regulate bile acid synthesis in the liver. FGF15 targets its receptor fibroblast growth factor receptor 4 in the liver and serves important roles in energy metabolism, including bile acid homeostasis, glucose metabolism and protein synthesis. The expression of FGF15 is known to be regulated by the transcription factor farnesoid X receptor (FXR). In the present study, reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction was used for measuring Fgf15 expression from the animal and tissue culture experiments, and it was identified that dexamethasone, a drug widely used in anti‑inflammation therapy, and a classical inducer of glucocorticoid receptor (GR)‑ and pregnane X receptor (PXR)‑target genes, may downregulate Fgf15 expression in the ileum. GR was identified to be highly expressed in the ileum by western blot analysis. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that the downregulation of Fgf15 by dexamethasone is due to the repression of ileal FXR activity via GR; however, not PXR, in the ileum. The present results provide insight for a better understanding of the adverse effects associated with dexamethasone therapy.
Hyperlipidemia, characterized by high serum lipids, is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Recent studies have identified an important role for celastrol, a proteasome inhibitor isolated from Tripterygium wilfordii Hook. F., in obesity-related metabolic disorders. However, the exact influences of celastrol on lipid metabolism remain largely unknown. Celastrol inhibited the terminal differentiation of 3T3-L1 adipocytes and decreased the levels of triglycerides in wild-type mice. Lipidomics analysis revealed that celastrol increased the metabolism of lysophosphatidylcholines (LPCs), phosphatidylcholines (PCs), sphingomyelins (SMs), and phosphatidylethanolamines (PEs). Further, celastrol reversed the tyloxapol-induced hyperlipidemia induced associated with increased plasma LPCs, PCs, SMs, and ceramides (CMs). Among these lipids, LPC(16:0), LPC(18:1), PC(22:2/15:0), and SM(d18:1/22:0) were also decreased by celastrol in cultured 3T3-L1 adipocytes, mice, and tyloxapol-treated mice. The mRNAs encoded by hepatic genes associated with lipid synthesis and catabolism, including Lpcat1, Pld1, Smpd3, and Sptc2, were altered in tyloxapol-induced hyperlipidemia, and significantly recovered by celastrol treatment. The effect of celastrol on lipid metabolism was significantly reduced in Fxr-null mice, resulting in decreased Cers6 and Acer2 mRNAs compared to wild-type mice. These results establish that FXR was responsible in part for the effects of celastrol in controlling lipid metabolism and contributing to the recovery of aberrant lipid metabolism in obesity-related metabolic disorders.
Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) may be associated with changes in bile acid (BA) metabolism. Hepatic BA production, measured by serum levels of the precursor 7α-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one (C4), is regulated by the farnesoid-X-receptor (FXR)-dependent ileal hormone fibroblast growth factor 19 (FGF19). Low FGF19 and high C4 are features of chronic BA diarrhea. Obeticholic acid, an FXR agonist, stimulates FGF19 and has shown therapeutic potential in both BA diarrhea and in NAFLD. We hypothesized there are associations of FGF19, C4 and BA diarrhea with NAFLD.
127 patients with known NAFLD were recruited prospectively. Clinical features, including metformin use, markers of NAFLD severity and BA synthesis were analyzed. The overall incidence of chronic diarrhea was 25%, with features of BA diarrhea in 12%. FGF19 negatively correlated with C4 (rs = -0.43, p = 0.001) and with alanine aminotransferase (rs = -0.22, p = 0.03), but not with either NAFLD fibrosis or Fibroscan scores. High C4 was associated with a higher NAFLD fibrosis score (p &lt; 0.05), and with diarrhea (p = 0.001). The median NAFLD fibrosis score was higher in those with diarrhea (p = 0.002). Metformin use, in 44% overall, was particularly associated with diarrhea (in 36% vs 17%, p = 0.02), and a lower median FGF19 (74 vs 105 pg/mL, p &lt; 0.05).
Increased hepatic BA production and diarrhea, but not low FGF19, were associated with increased NAFLD fibrosis score, indicating dysregulation of the FXR-FGF19 axis and suggesting hepatic FGF19 resistance. Metformin use was an important factor in a subgroup, lowering FGF19, and resulting in bile acid diarrhea.
Progression to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) manifests as hepatitis, fibrosis, and sometimes carcinoma, resulting in liver failure. Various clinical trials have indicated that several pharmacological agents, including angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) or farnesoid X receptor (FXR) agonists, are effective in NASH treatment. In addition, functional foods are expected to be important alternatives for treating or preventing NASH. Recently, focus has been directed toward microalgae as dietary supplements, mainly for lifestyle-related diseases, because they contain various nutrients and functional ingredients. Specifically, a unicellular microalga Euglena gracilis stores a unique β-1,3-glucan particle called paramylon that stimulates the immune system. In this study, we evaluated the effects of Euglena and paramylon on NASH in Stelic Animal Model (STAM) mice using Sirius red staining and confirmed that oral administration of Euglena or paramylon inhibits the process of liver fibrosis. Moreover, compared with controls, paramylon decreased non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) activity scores related to inflammation. These results indicate that the oral administration of Euglena and paramylon inhibits fibrosis and ameliorates NASH.
Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) is an aggressive cancer with high resistance to chemotherapeutics. CCA is enriched in cancer stem cells, which correlate with aggressiveness and prognosis. FXR, a member of the metabolic nuclear receptor family, is markedly down-regulated in human CCA. Our aim was to evaluate, in primary cultures of human intrahepatic CCA (iCCA), the effects of the FXR agonist obeticholic acid (OCA), a semisynthetic bile acid derivative, on their cancerogenic potential. Primary human iCCA cell cultures were prepared from surgical specimens of mucinous or mixed iCCA subtypes. Increasing concentrations (0-2.5 μM) of OCA were added to culture media and, after 3-10 days, effects on proliferation (MTS assay, cell population doubling time), apoptosis (annexin V-FITC/propidium iodide), cell migration and invasion (wound healing response and Matrigel invasion assay), and cancerogenic potential (spheroid formation, clonogenic assay, colony formation capacity) were evaluated. Results: FXR gene expression was downregulated (RT-qPCR) in iCCA cells vs normal human biliary tree stem cells (p &lt; 0.05) and in mucinous iCCA vs mixed iCCA cells (p &lt; 0.05) but was upregulated by addition of OCA. OCA significantly (p &lt; 0.05) inhibited proliferation of both mucinous and mixed iCCA cells, starting at a concentration as low as 0.05 μM. Also, CDCA (but not UDCA) inhibited cell proliferation, although to a much lower extent than OCA, consistent with its different affinity for FXR. OCA significantly induced apoptosis of both iCCA subtypes and decreased their in vitro cancerogenic potential, as evaluated by impairment of colony and spheroid formation capacity and delayed wound healing and Matrigel invasion. In general, these effects were more evident in mixed than mucinous iCCA cells. When tested together with Gemcitabine and Cisplatin, OCA potentiated the anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic effects of these chemotherapeutics, but mainly in mixed iCCA cells. OCA abolished the capacity of both mucinous and mixed iCCA cells to form colonies when administered together with Gemcitabine and Cisplatin. In subcutaneous xenografts of mixed iCCA cells, OCA alone or combined with Gemcitabine or Cisplatin markedly reduced the tumor size after 5 weeks of treatment by inducing necrosis of tumor mass and inhibiting cell proliferation. In conclusion, FXR is down-regulated in iCCA cells, and its activation by OCA results in anti-cancerogenic effects against mucinous and mixed iCCA cells, both in vitro and in vivo. The effects of OCA predominated in mixed iCCA cells, consistent with the lower aggressiveness and the higher FXR expression in this CCA subtype. These results, showing the FXR-mediated capacity of OCA to inhibit cholangiocarcinogenesis, represent the basis for testing OCA in clinical trials of CCA patients.
Activation of the farnesoid X receptor (FXR), a member of the nuclear receptor steroid superfamily, leads to anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic effects in several tissues, including the lung. We have recently demonstrated a protective effect of the farnesoid X receptor (FXR) agonist obeticholic acid (OCA) in rat models of monocrotaline (MCT)-induced pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) and bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether the positive effects of OCA treatment could be exerted also in established MCT-induced PAH, i.e., starting treatment 2 weeks after MCT administration.
Rats with MCT-induced PAH were treated, 2 weeks after MCT administration, with OCA or tadalafil for two additional weeks. Pulmonary functional tests were performed at week 2 (before treatment) and four (end of treatment). At the same time points, lung morphological features and expression profile of genes related to smooth muscle relaxation/contraction and tissue remodeling were also assessed.
2 weeks after MCT-induced injury, the treadmill resistance (a functional parameter related to pulmonary hypertension) was significantly decreased. At the same time point, we observed right ventricular hypertrophy and vascular remodeling, with upregulation of genes related to inflammation. At week 4, we observed a further worsening of the functional and morphological parameters, accompanied by dysregulation of inflammatory and extracellular matrix markers mRNA expression. Administration of OCA (3 or 10 mg/kg/day), starting 2 weeks after MCT-induced injury, significantly improved pulmonary function, effectively normalizing the exercise capacity. OCA also reverted most of the lung alterations, with a significant reduction of lung vascular wall thickness, right ventricular hypertrophy, and restoration of the local balance between relaxant and contractile pathways. Markers of remodeling pathways were also normalized by OCA treatment. Notably, results with OCA treatment were similar, or even superior, to those obtained with tadalafil, a recently approved treatment for pulmonary hypertension.
The results of this study demonstrate a significant therapeutic effect of OCA in established MCT-induced PAH, improving exercise capacity associated with reduction of right ventricular hypertrophy and lung vascular remodeling. Thus, OCA dosing in a therapeutic protocol restores the balance between relaxant and contractile pathways in the lung, promoting cardiopulmonary protective actions in MCT-induced PAH.
Though bile acids have been well known as digestive juice, recent studies have demonstrated that bile acids bind to their endogenous receptors, including Farnesoid X receptor (FXR) and G protein-coupled bile acid receptor 1 (GPBAR1; TGR5) and serve as hormone to control various biological processes, including cholesterol/bile acid metabolism, glucose/lipid metabolism, immune responses, and energy metabolism. Deficiency of those bile acid receptors has been reported to induce diverse metabolic syndromes such as obesity, hyperlipidemia, hyperglycemia, and insulin resistance. As consistent, numerous studies have reported alteration of bile acid signaling pathways in type II diabetes patients. Interestingly, bile acids have shown to activate TGR5 in intestinal L cells and enhance secretion of glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) to potentiate insulin secretion in response to glucose. Moreover, FXR has been shown to crosstalk with TGR5 to control GLP-1 secretion. Altogether, bile acid receptors, FXR and TGR5 are potent therapeutic targets for the treatment of metabolic diseases, including type II diabetes.
Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is currently evolving as the most common liver disease worldwide. Dyslipidemia, pathoglycemia and insulin resistance are the major risk factors for the development of NAFLD. To date, no effective drug therapies for this condition have been approved.
The present study was to investigate the protective effects of yangonin, a kavalactone isolated from Kava, against NAFLD and further elucidate the mechanisms in vivo and in vitro.
A high-fat diet (HFD) induced mouse NAFLD model was used with or without yangonin treatment.
The body weight, relative liver weight and serum biochemical indicators were measured. H&amp;E and Oil Red O staining were used to identify the amelioration of the liver histopathological changes. Serum and hepatic triglyceride, free fatty acids and total cholesterol were analyzed. siRNA, quantitative real-time PCR and Western blot assay were used to clarify the mechanisms underlying yangonin protection.
Yangonin had obvious protective effects against NAFLD via farnesoid X receptor (FXR) activation. Through FXR activation, yangonin attenuated lipid accumulation in the liver via inhibition of hepatic lipogenesis-related protein including sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1c (SREBP-1c), fatty acid synthetase (FAS), acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1 (ACC1) and stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 (SCD1). Besides, yangonin promoted lipid metabolism through an induction in genes required for lipoprotein lipolysis and fatty acid β-oxidation. Furthermore, yangonin modulated blood glucose homeostasis through regulation of gluconeogenesis-related gene phosphoenol pyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) and glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase), and glycogen synthesis-related gene glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β) and pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDase). Also, yangonin increased insulin sensitivity through upregulating phosphorylation of insulin responsive substrate 1, 2 (IRS-1 and IRS-2). Then, in vivo and in vitro evidence further demonstrated the involvement of FXR activation in yangonin hepatoprotection.
Yangonin protects against NAFLD due to its activation of FXR signalling to inhibit hepatic lipogenesis and gluconeogenesis, and to promote lipid metabolism and glycogen synthesis, as well as insulin sensitivity.
Activation of the nuclear bile acid receptor farnesoid X receptor (FXR) protects against hepatic inflammation and injury, while Takeda G protein-coupled receptor 5 (TGR5) promotes adipose tissue browning and energy metabolism. Here, we examined the physiological and metabolic effects of the deficiency of these two bile acid receptors on hepatic metabolism and injury in mice. Fxr/Tgr5 double knockout mice (DKO) were generated for metabolic phenotyping. Male DKO mice fed a chow diet had reduced liver lipid levels but increased serum cholesterol levels. Liver cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase (Cyp7a1) activity and sterol 12α-hydroxylase mRNA levels were induced, while ileum FXR target genes were suppressed in DKO mice compared to wild-type (WT) mice. Bile acid pool size was increased in DKO mice, with increased taurocholic acid and decreased tauromuricholic acids. RNA sequencing analysis of the liver transcriptome revealed that bile acid synthesis and fibrosis gene expression levels are increased in chow-fed DKO mice compared to WT mice and that the top regulated pathways are involved in steroid/cholesterol biosynthesis, liver cirrhosis, and connective tissue disease. Cholestyramine treatment further induced Cyp7a1 mRNA and protein in DKO mice and increased bile acid pool size, while cholic acid also induced Cyp7a1 in DKO mice, suggesting impaired bile acid feedback regulation. A Western diet containing 0.2% cholesterol increased oxidative stress and markers of liver fibrosis but not hepatic steatosis in DKO mice. Conclusion: FXR and TGR5 play critical roles in protecting the liver from inflammation and fibrosis, and deficiency of both of these bile acid receptors in mice increased cholic acid synthesis and the bile acid pool, liver fibrosis, and inflammation; FXR and TGR5 DKO mice may be a model for liver fibrosis.
Bile acids are now accepted as central signalling molecules for the regulation of glucose, amino acid and lipid metabolism. Adrenal gland cortex cells express the bile acid receptors farnesoid X receptor (FXR), the G protein-coupled bile acid receptor (TGR5) and the sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 2 (S1PR2). We aimed to determine the effects of cholestasis and more specifically of bile acids on cortisol production.
FXR and TGR5 knockout mice and controls were subjected to common bile duct ligation (CBDL) or chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) feeding to model cholestasis. Human adrenocortical H295R cells were challenged with bile acids for mechanistic studies.
We found that CBDL and CDCA feeding increased the levels of corticosterone, the rodent equivalent to human cortisol and mRNA and protein levels of steroidogenesis-related enzymes in adrenals independent of FXR and TGR5. Taurine-conjugated CDCA (TCDCA) significantly stimulated cortisol secretion, phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and expression of steroidogenesis-related genes in human adrenocortical H295R cells. FXR and TGR5 agonists failed to induce cortisol secretion in H295R cells. S1PR2 inhibition significantly abolished TCDCA-induced cortisol secretion, lowered phosphorylation of ERK and abrogated enhanced transcription of steroidogenesis-related genes in H295R cells. Likewise, siRNA S1PR2 treatment reduced the phosphorylation of ERK and cortisol secretion. Steroidogenic factor-1 (SF-1) transactivation activity was increased upon TCDCA treatment suggesting that bile acid signalling is linked to SF-1. Treatment with SF-1 inverse agonist AC45594 also reduced TCDCA-induced steroidogenesis.
Our findings indicate that supraphysiological bile acid levels as observed in cholestasis stimulate steroidogenesis via an S1PR2-ERK-SF-1 signalling pathway.
Placement of the duodenal-jejunal bypass liner (DJBL) leads to rapid weight loss and restoration of insulin sensitivity in a similar fashion to bariatric surgery. Increased systemic bile acid levels are candidate effectors for these effects through postprandial activation of their receptors TGR5 and FXR. We aimed to quantify postprandial bile acid, GLP-1 and FGF19 responses and assess their temporal relation to the weight loss and metabolic and hormonal changes seen after DJBL placement.
We performed mixed meal testing in 17 obese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2) directly before, one week after and 6 months after DJBL placement.
Both fasting and postprandial bile acid levels were unchanged at 1 week after implantation, and greatly increased 6 months after implantation. The increase consisted of unconjugated bile acid species. 3 hour-postprandial GLP-1 levels increased after 1 week and were sustained, whereas FGF19 levels and postprandial plasma courses were unaffected.
DJBL placement leads to profound increases in unconjugated bile acid levels after 6 months, similar to the effects of bariatric surgery. The temporal dissociation between the changes in bile acids, GLP-1 and FGF19 and other gut hormone responses warrant caution about the beneficial role of bile acids after DJBL placement. This observational uncontrolled study emphasizes the need for future controlled studies.
Probucol has antioxidant effects and inhibits inflammation. Farnesoid X receptor (FXR) is a nuclear receptor that regulates autophagy, which is regarded as the key cause of the activation of hepatic stellate cell (HSC). In this study, the effects of probucol on HSC activation and autophagy in vitro and vivo and the role of FXR in this progress were investigated. Results showed that probucol ameliorated hepatic fibrosis and autophagy, and increased the expression of FXR in liver in a mouse model of fibrosis induced by CCl4. And probucol could alleviate lipopolysaccharide-induced autophagy and HSC activation in vitro. In addition, probucol increased FXR expression, and the Z-guggulsterone, an antagonist of FXR, could block the effects of probucol on HSC activation and autophagy. Additionally, agonists of FXR could suppress LPS-induced autophagy and activation. These results suggest that probucol could ameliorate hepatic fibrosis, and inhibit HSC autophagy and activation, and these effects are associated with FXR.
Bile acids (BAs) are the major metabolic product of cholesterol, having detergent-like activities and being responsible for absorption of lipid and lipid-soluble vitamins. In addition, it has been increasingly recognized that BAs are important signaling molecules, regulating energy metabolism and immunity. Under physiological circumstances, synthesis and transport of BAs are precisely regulated to maintain bile acid homeostasis. Disruption of bile acid homeostasis results in pathological cholestasis and metabolic liver diseases. During the last decades, BAs have been gradually recognized as an important therapeutic target for novel treatment in chronic liver diseases. This review will provide an update on the current understanding of synthesis, transport and regulation of BAs, with a focus on the therapeutic roles of bile acid signaling in chronic liver diseases.
The molecular mechanism for the pathogenesis of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) remains elusive. Both farnesoid X receptor (FXR) signalling and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress contribute to the progression of NAFLD; however, it is not clear whether the actions of these two pathways are dependent on each other. Moreover, the pharmacological benefits and mechanism of betulinic acid (BA) in controlling metabolic syndrome and NAFLD are largely unknown.
A reporter assay and a time-resolved FRET assay were used to identify BA as an agonist of the FXR. NAFLD was induced by a methionine and choline-deficient L-amino acid diet (MCD) and high-fat diet (HFD). The pharmacological effects of BA (100 mg·kg-1 ·day-1 ) and potential interactions between hepatic FXR activation and ER stress pathways were evaluated by FXR silencing, Western blot and RT-PCR analyses using control and FXR-/- mice.
Activation of the FXR inhibited intracellular PERK/EIF2α/ATF4 and CHOP signalling, thereby alleviating hepatic ER stress, whereas FXR silencing resulted in an opposite effect. Furthermore, we identified BA as an FXR agonist that effectively attenuated the progression of NAFLD and metabolic disorders in both HFD- and MCD diet-fed mice and restored the hepatocellular ER homeostasis by stimulating the FXR signalling pathway and blocking PERK/EIF2α signalling. In contrast, the effects of BA were attenuated in FXR-/- mice.
Our data demonstrate that pharmacological activation of the FXR by BA reduces hepatocellular ER stress and attenuates NAFLD in an animal model of hepatic steatosis.
Obesity and type 2 diabetes are increasing in prevalence around the world, and there is a clear need for new and effective strategies to promote metabolic health. A low protein (LP) diet improves metabolic health in both rodents and humans, but the mechanisms that underlie this effect remain unknown. The gut microbiome has recently emerged as a potent regulator of host metabolism and the response to diet. Here, we demonstrate that a LP diet significantly alters the taxonomic composition of the gut microbiome at the phylum level, altering the relative abundance of Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Firmicutes. Transcriptional profiling suggested that any impact of the microbiome on liver metabolism was likely independent of the microbiome-farnesoid X receptor (FXR) axis. We therefore tested the ability of a LP diet to improve metabolic health following antibiotic ablation of the gut microbiota. We found that a LP diet promotes leanness, increases energy expenditure, and improves glycemic control equally well in mice treated with antibiotics as in untreated control animals. Our results demonstrate that the beneficial effects of a LP diet on glucose homeostasis, energy balance, and body composition are unlikely to be mediated by diet-induced changes in the taxonomic composition of the gut microbiome.
This review presents mechanistic studies performed in vitro and in animal models, as well as data obtained in patients that contribute to a better understanding of the impact of nutrients interacting with the gut microbiota on metabolic and behavioural alterations linked to obesity. The gut microbiota composition and function are altered in several pathological conditions including obesity and related diseases i.e. non-alcoholic fatty liver diseases (NAFLD). The gut-liver axis is clearly influenced by alterations of the gut barrier that drives inflammation. In addition, recent papers propose that specific metabolites issued from the metabolic cooperation between the gut microbes and host enzymes, modulate inflammation and gene expression in the liver. This review illustrates how dietary intervention with prebiotics or probiotics influences host energy metabolism and inflammation. Indeed, intervention studies are currently underway in obese and NAFLD patients to unravel the relevance of the changes in gut microbiota composition in the management of metabolic and behavioural disorders by nutrients interacting with the gut microbiota. In conclusion, diet is among the main triggers of NAFLD and the gut microbiota is modified accordingly, underlining the importance of the concomitant study of the nutrients and microbial impact on liver health and metabolism, in order to propose innovative, clinically relevant, therapeutic approaches.
The bile acid activated transcription factor farnesoid X receptor (FXR) has revealed therapeutic potential as a molecular drug target for the treatment of hepatic and metabolic disorders. Despite strong efforts in FXR ligand development, the structural diversity among the known FXR modulators is limited. Only four molecular frameworks account for more than 50 % of the FXR modulators annotated in ChEMBL. Here, we leverage machine learning methods to expand the chemical space of FXR-targeting small molecules by employing an ensemble of three complementary machine learning approaches. A counter-propagation artificial neural network, a k-nearest neighbor learner, and a three-dimensional pharmacophore descriptor were combined to retrieve novel FXR ligands from a collection of more than 3 million compounds. The ensemble machine learning model identified six new FXR modulators among ten top-ranked candidates. These active hits comprise both FXR activators and antagonists with micromolar potencies. With four novel FXR ligand scaffolds, these computationally identified bioactive compounds appreciably expand the chemical space of known FXR modulators and may serve as starting points for hit-to-lead expansion.
Invited for this month's cover picture is the group of Prof. Dr. Gisbert Schneider from the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (ETH) Zurich (Switzerland). The cover picture illustrates the application of machine-learning methods to expand the chemical space of farnesoid X receptor (FXR)-targeting small molecules, by employing an ensemble of three complementary machine-learning approaches (counter-propagation artificial neural network, k-nearest neighbor learner, and three-dimensional pharmacophore model).

Celastrol, derived from the roots of the Tripterygium Wilfordi, shows a striking effect on obesity. In the present study, the role of celastrol in cholestasis was investigated using metabolomics and transcriptomics. Celastrol treatment significantly alleviated cholestatic liver injury in mice induced by α-naphthyl isothiocyanate (ANIT) and thioacetamide (TAA). Celastrol was found to activate sirtuin 1 (SIRT1), increase farnesoid X receptor (FXR) signaling and inhibit nuclear factor-kappa B and P53 signaling. The protective role of celastrol in cholestatic liver injury was diminished in mice on co-administration of SIRT1 inhibitors. Further, the effects of celastrol on cholestatic liver injury were dramatically decreased in Fxr-null mice, suggesting that the SIRT1-FXR signaling pathway mediates the protective effects of celastrol. These observations demonstrated a novel role for celastrol in protecting against cholestatic liver injury through modulation of the SIRT1 and FXR.
We demonstrated the metabolic benefits of Parabacteroides distasonis (PD) on decreasing weight gain, hyperglycemia, and hepatic steatosis in ob/ob and high-fat diet (HFD)-fed mice. Treatment with live P. distasonis (LPD) dramatically altered the bile acid profile with elevated lithocholic acid (LCA) and ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) and increased the level of succinate in the gut. In vitro cultivation of PD demonstrated its capacity to transform bile acids and production of succinate. Succinate supplementation in the diet decreased hyperglycemia in ob/ob mice via the activation of intestinal gluconeogenesis (IGN). Gavage with a mixture of LCA and UDCA reduced hyperlipidemia by activating the FXR pathway and repairing gut barrier integrity. Co-treatment with succinate and LCA/UDCA mirrored the benefits of LPD. The binding target of succinate was identified as fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase, the rate-limiting enzyme in IGN. The succinate and secondary bile acids produced by P. distasonis played key roles in the modulation of host metabolism.
Fructus Psoraleae (FP) causes cholestatic liver injury; however, its main toxic constituents that are responsible for causing hepatotoxicity remained undetermined in previous studies. In the present study, psoralen and isopsoralen, the two main constituents of FP, were administered orally to rats (80 and 40 mg/kg, respectively) and mice (320 and 160 mg/kg, respectively) for 28 days, followed by biochemical and histopathological examinations to evaluate their hepatotoxicity. The results showed that psoralen and isopsoralen could induce the toxic reactions of liver and other organs in rats, while mice were not sensitive to these two compounds. Furthermore, the corresponding results indicated that administration of psoralen and isopsoralen repressed the expression of CYP7A1, BSEP, MRP2 and SULT2A1 and increased the expression of FXR and MRP3 in the rat liver. In summary, the toxic reactions of psoralen and isopsoralen are different in different species. In this study, multiple organ toxicity, such as cholestatic liver injury, occurs in rats, but not in mice. Psoralen and isopsoralen are the two main toxic constituents of FP. In addition, psoralen and isopsoralen cause liver injury, possibly through inhibiting bile acid excretion in the liver, leading to the accumulation of toxin in hepatocytes.
The expression of the human organic cation transporter-1 (hOCT1, gene SLC22A1) is reduced in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The molecular bases of this reduction and its relationship with the poor response of HCC to sorafenib were investigated.
HCC transcriptomes from 366 samples available at TCGA were analysed. Alternative splicing was determined by RT-PCR. The role of miRNAs in SLC22A1 downregulation was investigated. Expression of Oct1 was measured in rodent HCC models (spontaneously generated in Fxr-/- mice and chemically-induced in rats). hOCT1 was overexpressed in human hepatoma cells (HuH7 and HepG2). Sorafenib and regorafenib uptake was determined by HPLC-MS/MS.
hOCT1 overexpression enhanced sorafenib, but not regorafenib, quinine-inhibitable uptake by hepatoma cells. In rodent HCC, Oct1 was downregulated, which was accompanied by impaired sorafenib uptake. In mice with s.c.-implanted HCC, sorafenib inhibited the growth of hOCT1 overexpressing tumours. In human HCC, hOCT1 expression was inversely correlated with SLC22A1 promoter methylation, whereas demethylation with decitabine enhanced hOCT1 expression in hepatoma cells. Increased proportion of aberrant hOCT1 mRNA variants was found in HCC samples. In silico analysis identified six miRNAs as candidates to target hOCT1 mRNA. When overexpressed in HepG2 cells a significant hOCT1 mRNA decay was induced by hsa-miR-330 and hsa-miR-1468. Analysis of 39 paired tumour/adjacent samples from TCGA revealed that hsa-mir-330 was consistently upregulated in HCC.
Impaired hOCT1 expression/function in HCC, in part due to epigenetic modifications, plays an important role in the poor pharmacological response of this cancer to sorafenib.
Insoluble residue (INS) is a lignin-rich fraction of brewer's spent grain (BSG) that also contains β-glucan and arabinoxylan, the major constituents of dietary fiber. We investigated the effects of INS in diet-induced obese mice in terms of lipid metabolism and metabolic diseases. Male mice (C57bl6) were fed a high-fat diet (HFD), a HFD + 20% INS, a HFD + 20% cellulose (CEL), a HFD with a combination of 20% INS-CEL (1:1), or a control diet for 14 weeks. Insulin and glucose tolerance tests were performed after 12 weeks. Fasting plasma lipids, bile acid, and fecal bile acid were measured after 14 weeks of feeding, and tissues were collected for gene expression analysis. Body weight gain was significantly reduced with all fibers, but only INS and INS-CEL decreased fasting plasma low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and total cholesterol compared to HFD. CEL and INS-CEL significantly improved insulin resistance. Fecal bile acids were significantly increased by all fibers, but there was no change in plasma bile acid. Clostridium leptum was increased with all fibers, but universal bacterial diversity was only with INS and INS-CEL. In addition, INS significantly increased the abundance of Bacteriodes, while CEL decreased Atopobium and Lactobacillus. INS feeding significantly upregulated various genes of cholesterol and bile acid metabolism, such as Srebp2, Hmgcr, Ldlr, Cyp7a1, Pparα, Fxr, and Pxr, in the liver. INS, INS-CEL, and CEL significantly attenuated liver steatosis. Our results suggest that INS from BSG induced beneficial systemic changes in mice via gut microbiota, bile acids, and gene expression in the liver.
Bile acids, amphipathic molecules known for their facilitating role in fat absorption, are also recognized as signalling molecules acting via nuclear and membrane receptors. Of the bile acid-activated receptors, the Farnesoid X Receptor (FXR) and the G protein-coupled bile acid receptor-1 (Gpbar1 or TGR5) have been studied most extensively. Bile acid signaling is critical in the regulation of bile acid metabolism itself, but it also plays a significant role in glucose, lipid and energy metabolism. Activation of FXR and TGR5 leads to reduced hepatic bile salt load, improved insulin sensitivity and glucose regulation, increased energy expenditure, and anti-inflammatory effects. These beneficial effects render bile acid signaling an interesting therapeutic target for the treatment of diseases such as cholestasis, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, and diabetes. Here, we summarize recent findings on bile acid signaling and discuss potential and current limitations of bile acid receptor agonist and modulators of bile acid transport as future therapeutics for a wide-spectrum of diseases.
Long-chain acyl-CoA synthetase 1 (ACSL1) plays a pivotal role in fatty acid β‑oxidation in heart, adipose tissue and skeletal muscle. However, key functions of ACSL1 in the liver remain largely unknown. We investigated acute effects of hepatic ACSL1 deficiency on lipid metabolism in adult mice under hyperlipidemic and normolipidemic conditions. We knocked down hepatic ACSL1 expression using adenovirus expressing a ACSL1 shRNA (Ad-shAcsl1) in mice fed a high-fat diet or a normal chow diet. Hepatic ACSL1 depletion generated a hypercholesterolemic phenotype in mice fed both diets with marked elevations of total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol and free cholesterol in circulation and accumulations of cholesterol in the liver. Furthermore, SREBP2 pathway in ACSL1 depleted livers was severely repressed with a 50% reduction of LDL receptor protein levels. In contrast to the dysregulated cholesterol metabolism, serum triglycerides, free fatty acid and phospholipid levels were unaffected. Mechanistic investigations of genome-wide gene expression profiling and pathway analysis revealed that ACSL1 depletion repressed expressions of several key enzymes for bile acid biosynthesis, consequently leading to reduced liver bile acid levels and altered bile acid compositions. These results are the first demonstration of a requisite role of ACSL1 in bile acid biosynthetic pathway in liver tissue. Furthermore, we discovered that Acsl1 is a novel molecular target of the bile acid-activated farnesoid X receptor (FXR). Activation of FXR by agonist obeticholic acid repressed the expression of ACSL1 protein and mRNA in the liver of FXR wild-type mice but not in FXR knockout mice.
Farnesoid X receptor (FXR) is a nuclear bile acid (BA) receptor widely distributed among tissues, a major sensor of BA levels, primary suppressor of hepatic BA synthesis and secondary regulator of lipid metabolism and inflammation. Chronic kidney disease is a common, multifactorial condition with metabolic and inflammatory causes and implications. An array of natural and synthetic FXR agonists has been developed, but not yet studied clinically in kidney disease. Areas covered: Following a summary of FXR's physiological functions in the kidney, we discuss its effects in renal disease with emphasis on chronic and acute kidney disease, chemotherapy-induced nephrotoxicity, and renal neoplasia. Most information is derived from animal models; no relevant clinical study has been conducted to date. Expert opinion: Most available preclinical data indicates a promising outlook for clinical research in this direction. We believe FXR agonism to be an auspicious approach to treating renal disease, considering that multifactorial diseases call for ideally wide-reaching therapies.
The manipulation of bile acid (BA) homeostasis by blocking the ileal apical Na+-dependent bile salt transporter (ASBT/SLC10A2) may have therapeutic effects in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. We developed a novel ASBT inhibitor, an N-(3,4-o-dichlorophenyl)-2-(3-trifluoromethoxy) benzamide derivative referred to as IMB17-15, and investigated its therapeutic effects and the molecular mechanisms underlying the effects. Syrian golden hamsters were challenged with high-fat diet (HFD) to induce NAFLD and were subsequently administered 400 mg/kg IMB17-15 by gavage daily for 21 days. Serum, liver, and fecal samples were collected for further analysis. Plasma concentration-time profiles of IMB17-15 were also constructed. The human hepatocyte cell line HL-7702 was treated with Oleic acid (OA) with or without IMB17-15. Western blotting and real-time PCR were used to study the molecular mechanisms of IMB17-15. We found that IMB17-15 inhibited ASBT and subsequently suppressed ileal farnesoid X receptor (FXR) and FXR-activated fibroblast growth factor15/19 (FGF15/19) expression, which reduced the hepatic phosphorylated extracellular regulated protein kinase (ERK) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) levels and upregulated the cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase (CYP7A1) activity. Additionally, IMB17-15 stimulated adenosine monophosphate (AMP)-activated protein kinase (AMPKα) phosphorylation and enhanced peroxisome proliferator activated receptor α (PPARα) expression and thus promoted triglyceride (TG) oxidation and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-c) metabolism through an ASBT-independent mechanism. In conclusion, a novel ASBT inhibitor known as IMB17-15 protected hamsters against HFD-induced NFALD by manipulating BA and lipid homeostasis. IMB17-15 also reduced lipid deposition in human hepatic cell lines, indicating that it may be useful as a therapy for NAFLD patients.
Ten new triterpenoid compounds with structure diversity of the C-17 side-chain, including nine tirucallanes, named xylocarpols A⁻E (1⁻5) and agallochols A⁻D (6⁻9), and an apotirucallane, named 25-dehydroxy protoxylogranatin B (10), were isolated from the mangrove plants Xylocarpus granatum, Xylocarpus moluccensis, and Excoecaria agallocha. The structures of these compounds were established by HR-ESIMS and extensive one-dimensional (1D) and two-dimensional (2D) NMR investigations. The absolute configurations of 1 and 2 were unequivocally determined by single-crystal X-ray diffraction analyses, conducted with Cu Kα radiation; whereas those of 4, 6⁻8 were assigned by a modified Mosher's method and the comparison of experimental electronic circular dichroism (ECD) spectra. Most notably, 5, 6, 7, and 9 displayed potent activation effects on farnesoid⁻X⁻receptor (FXR) at the concentration of 10.0 μM; 10 exhibited very significant agonistic effects on pregnane⁻X⁻receptor (PXR) at the concentration of 10.0 nM.
Overweight-related metabolic diseases are an important threat to health in the Western world. Dietary habits are one of the main causative factors for metabolic syndrome, CVD and type 2 diabetes. The human gut microbiota is emerging as an important player in the interaction between diet and metabolic health. Gut microbial communities contribute to human metabolism through fermentation of dietary fibre and the result of intestinal saccharolytic fermentation is production of SCFA. Acetate, propionate and butyrate positively influence satiety, endocrine system, glucose homeostasis, adipogenesis, lipid oxidation, thermoregulation, hepatic gluconeogenesis, endothelial function and gut barrier integrity, and these mechanisms have all been linked to protection from type 2 diabetes, hypertension and cardiovascular health. The gut microbiota is also involved in bile acid metabolism and regulating their cell signalling potential, which has also been shown to modify pathways involved in metabolic health. Similarly, the gut microbiota renders recalcitrant plant polyphenols into biologically active small phenolic compounds which then act systemically to reduce metabolic disease risk. This review summarises how dietary patterns, specific foods and a healthy lifestyle may modulate metabolic health through the gut microbiota and their molecular cross-talk with the host.
Apart from well-known functions of bile acids in digestion and solubilization of lipophilic nutrients and drugs in the small intestine, the emerging evidence from the past two decades identified the role of bile acids as signaling, endocrine molecules that regulate the glucose, lipid, and energy metabolism through complex and intertwined pathways that are largely mediated by activation of nuclear receptor farnesoid X receptor (FXR) and cell surface G protein-coupled receptor 1, TGR5 (also known as GPBAR1). Interactions of bile acids with the gut microbiota that result in the altered composition of circulating and intestinal bile acids pool, gut microbiota composition and modified signaling pathways, are further extending the complexity of biological functions of these steroid derivatives. Thus, bile acids signaling pathways have become attractive targets for the treatment of various metabolic diseases and metabolic syndrome opening the new potential avenue in their treatment. In addition, there is a significant effort to unveil some specific properties of bile acids relevant to their intrinsic potency and selectivity for particular receptors and to design novel modulators of these receptors with improved pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles. This resulted in synthesis of few semi-synthetic bile acids derivatives such as 6α-ethyl-chenodeoxycholic acid (obeticholic acid, OCA), norursodeoxycholic acid (norUDCA), and 12-monoketocholic acid (12-MKC) that are proven to have positive effect in metabolic and hepato-biliary disorders. This review presents an overview of the current knowledge related to bile acids implications in glucose, lipid and energy metabolism, as well as a potential application of bile acids in metabolic syndrome treatment with future perspectives.
Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has an estimated prevalence of 25% in the general population, and cirrhosis secondary to Non-Alcoholic Steatohepatitis (NASH) is predicted to become the leading cause of liver transplantation and yet there is a lack of effective licensed treatments. There is a close relationship between insulin resistance and NAFLD, with the prevalence of NAFLD being five-fold higher in patients with diabetes compared to patients without. Insulin resistance is implicated both in the pathogenesis of NAFLD and in disease progression from steatosis to NASH. Thus modulation of insulin resistance represents a potential strategy for NAFLD treatment. This review highlights key proposed mechanisms linking insulin resistance and NAFLD, such as changes in rates of adipose tissue lipolysis and de novo lipogenesis, impaired mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation, changes in fat distribution, alterations in the gut microbiome, and alterations in levels of adipokines and cytokines. Further, it goes on to discuss the main pharmacological strategies used to treat insulin resistance in patients with NAFLD, and their efficacy based on recently published experimental and clinical data. These include (biguanides, glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor (GLP-1) agonists, Dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4) inhibitors, Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor (PPAR- γ/ α/δ) agonists, Sodium Glucose Cotransporter (SGLT2) inhibitors and Farnesoid X receptor (FXR) agonists), with further novel treatments on the horizon. Ideally treatment would improve insulin resistance, reduce cardiovascular risk and produce demonstrable improvements in NASH histology - this is likely to be achieved with a combinatorial approach.

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide, and an association between altered bile acid (BA) metabolism, down-regulation of farnesoid X receptor (FXR), which is a master regulator of BA metabolism, and hepatocarcinogenesis has been documented. While global FXR deficiency in mice results in spontaneous HCC with aging, the contribution of tissue-specific FXR deficiency to hepatocarcinogenesis remains unclear. In this study, the prevalence of hepatic tumors, expression of genes related to tumorigenesis, and serum/liver BA levels were compared among male whole-body Fxr-null, hepatocyte-specific Fxr-null (Fxr∆Hep), and enterocyte-specific Fxr-null (Fxr∆IE) mice at the age of 3, 14, and 20 months. More than 90% of 20-month-old whole-body Fxr-null mice had hepatic tumors with enhanced hepatic expression of myelocytomatosis oncogene (Myc) and cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (Cdk4) messenger RNAs (mRNAs) and elevated serum taurocholate (TCA) and tauromuricholate (TMCA) and their respective unconjugated derivatives. The incidence of hepatic tumors was significantly lower in Fxr∆Hep and Fxr∆IE mice (20% and 5%, respectively), and the increases in Myc and Cdk4 mRNA or serum BA concentrations were not detected in these mice compared to Fxrfloxed [fl]/fl mice; a similar tendency was observed in 14-month-old mice. However, increased hepatic c-Myc protein expression was found only in Fxr-null mice at the age of 3, 14, and 20 months. Treatment with TCA induced Myc expression in Fxr-null cultured primary mouse hepatocytes but not in wild-type (WT) mouse hepatocytes, demonstrating that the combination of hepatocyte FXR disruption with elevated TCA is required for Myc induction and ensuing age-dependent hepatocarcinogenesis in Fxr-null mice. Conclusion: There is a relatively low risk of hepatic tumors by inhibition of FXR in enterocytes, likely due to the lack of increased TCA and Myc induction.
Cholestasis-induced accumulation of bile acids in the liver leads to farnesoid X receptor (FXR)-mediated transcriptional down-regulation of the bile acid importer Na+-taurocholate cotransporting protein (NTCP) and to induction of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. However, whether ER stress affects bile acid uptake is largely unknown. Here, we investigated the role of ER stress on the regulation and function of the bile acid transporter NTCP. ER stress was induced using thapsigargin or subtilase cytotoxin in human osteosarcoma (U2OS) and human hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2) cells stably expressing NTCP. Cellular bile acid uptake was determined using radiolabeled taurocholate (TCA). NTCP plasma membrane expression was determined by cell surface biotinylation. Mice received a single injection of thapsigargin, and effects of ER stress on NTCP messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein were measured by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and western blot analysis. Effects of cholestasis on NTCP and ER stress were assessed in response to 3, 5-diethoxycarbonyl-1, 4-dihydrocollidine (DDC) feeding or bile duct ligation in FXR-/- mice after 7 or 3 days, respectively. Novel NTCP-interacting proteins were identified by mass spectrometry (MS), interaction verified, and assessed by co-immunoprecipitation and TCA uptake for functional relevance in relation to ER stress. ER stress induction strongly reduced NTCP protein expression, plasma membrane abundance, and NTCP-mediated bile acid uptake. This was not controlled by FXR or through a single unfolded protein response (UPR) pathway but mainly depended on the interaction of NTCP with calnexin, an ER chaperone. In mice, expression of both NTCP and calnexin was reduced by thapsigargin or cholestasis-induced ER stress. Calnexin down-regulation in vitro recapitulated the effect of ER stress on NTCP. Conclusion: ER stress-induced down-regulation of calnexin provides an additional mechanism to dampen NTCP-mediated bile acid uptake and protect hepatocytes against bile acid overload during cholestasis.
Bile acids (BA) are increasingly recognized as pleiotropic and hormone-like signaling molecules with metabolic and endocrine functions. However, the role of BA in white adipocyte physiology remains somewhat obscure. It was the aim to investigate the BA receptors (FXR, TGR5) and FGFR1 (Fibroblast growth factor receptor 1) as well as Bsep (bile salt export pump) in white adipocytes and in murine and human adipose tissue (AT) and to investigate effects of different BA species in adipocyte physiology.
Receptor mRNA expression was quantified by real-time PCR in mice, humans and during 3T3-L1 pre-adipocyte differentiation. Adipokines were measured by ELISA upon stimulation by several BA. Effects of BA on TNF- and LPS-induced MCP-1 secretion and lipolysis were analyzed. TNF-induced lipolysis was investigated by glycerol assay.
The present data provide for the first time a detailed expression profile of FXR, TGR5, FGFR1, and Bsep during adipocyte differentiation and in murine and human AT. FGFR1 expression is upregulated in adipose tissue of LPS-injected animals. Several BA regulate secretion of adipokines such as adiponectin and resistin differentially. Importantly, TNF- and LPS-induced MCP-1 release from adipocytes as well as TNF-induced lipolysis can be antagonized by cholic acid (CA) and deoxycholic acid (DCA).
The present data provide evidence of functional BA signaling pathways in adipocytes and argue for certain MCP-1 related anti-inflammatory effects of BA in TNF- and LPS-induced inflammation, whereas pro-inflammatory resistin is induced by CA and glycocholic acid (GCA). Systemic bile acids might represent a hormonal network regulating white adipocyte physiology including lipolysis.
Type II diabetes is a complex, chronic, and progressive disease. Glucagon-like peptide-1 (7-36) amide (GLP-1) is a gut hormone released from the L cells which stimulate insulin secretion and promotes insulin gene expression and β-cell growth and differentiation. Elevated levels of hormones secreted by L cells are an essential reason for diabetes improvement. GLP-1 secretion has been reported to be regulated by farnesoid X receptor (FXR), a transcriptional sensor for bile acids which also acts on glucose metabolism. Herein, we attempted to evaluate the effect of FXR on GLP-1 secretion in mouse enteroendocrine L cell line, namely STC-1, and to investigate the underlying mechanism. FXR inversely regulated GLP-1 secretion in STC-1. A total of 24 nonredundant human proteins were shown to be related to FXR by BioGRID; KEGG pathway analysis revealed that FXR was related to glucagon signaling pathway, particularly with the transcriptional activators CREB, PGC1α, Sirt1, and CBP. CREB could positively regulate GLP-1 secretion in STC-1 cells. FXR combined with CREB to inhibit its transcriptional activity, thus inhibiting proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 1 protein level and GLP-1 secretion. In the present study, we demonstrated a negative regulation of GLP-1 secretion by FXR in L cell line, STC-1; FXR exerts its function in L cells through interacting with CREB, a crucial transcriptional regulator of cAMP-CREB signaling pathway, to inhibit its transcriptional activity. Targeting FXR to rescue GLP-1 secretion may be a promising strategy for type II diabetes.
Farnesoid X receptor (FXR) agonists play important regulatory roles in bile acid, lipid and glucose metabolism in vitro and in vivo. Thus, FXR agonists exhibit potential therapeutic effects on metabolism-related diseases that are associated with extrahepatic manifestations induced by hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. This study investigated the effect and mechanism of FXR agonist GW4064 against HCV in vitro to explore the potential application of FXR agonists. Results showed that GW4064 and other FXR agonists have potent antiviral activity against HCV in Huh7.5 cells. GW4064 down-regulated the expression of scavenger receptor class B type I protein via FXR and thereby indirectly inhibited HCV entry into cells, leading to interruption of HCV life cycle. GW4064 also exhibited synergistic anti-HCV effect with known direct-acting antiviral agents (DAAs) used in the clinic and remained sensitive to DAA-resistant HCV mutations. Therefore, FXR agonists are also a kind of antiviral agent, and might be helpful in treatment of HCV-induced hepatic and extrahepatic manifestations.
Sterol 12α-hydroxylase (CYP8B1) is required for synthesis of cholic acid in the classic bile acid synthesis pathway and plays a role in dyslipidemia and insulin resistance. However, the mechanism of the involvement of Cyp8b1 in dyslipidemia and insulin resistance is not known. CYP8B1 mRNA and protein expression are elevated in diabetic and obese (db/db) mouse liver. In this study adenovirus-mediated transduction of CYP8B1 was used to study the effect of Cyp8b1 on lipid metabolism in mice. Results show that Ad-Cyp8b1 increased 12α-hydroxylated bile acids and induced sterol regulatory element binding protein 1c (Srebp1c)-mediated lipogenic gene expression. Interestingly, Ad-Cyp8b1 increased ceramide synthesis and activated hepatic mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1)-p70S6K signaling cascade and inhibited AKT/insulin signaling in mice. Ad-Cyp8b1 increased free fatty acid uptake into mouse primary hepatocytes. Ceramides stimulated S6K phosphorylation in both mouse and human primary hepatocytes. In high fat diet-fed mice, Ad-Cyp8b1 reduced fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21), activated intestinal farnesoid X receptor (FXR) target gene expression, increased serum ceramides, VLDL secretion, and LDL cholesterol. In high fat diet-induced obese (DIO) mice, Cyp8b1 ablation by adenovirus-mediated shRNA improved oral glucose tolerance, increased FGF21, and reduced liver triglycerides, inflammatory cytokine expression, nuclear localization of Srebp1c and phosphorylation of S6K. In conclusion, this study unveiled a novel mechanism linking CYP8B1 to ceramide synthesis and mTORC1 signaling in dyslipidemia and insulin resistance, via intestinal FXR-mediated induction of FGF15 and liver FGF21. Reducing cholic acid synthesis may be a potential therapeutic strategy to treat dyslipidemia and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.
As a cellular bile acid sensor, farnesoid X receptor (FXR) and the membrane G-coupled receptor (GPBAR1) participate in maintaining bile acid, lipid, and glucose homeostasis. To date, several selective and dual agonists have been developed as promising pharmacological approach to metabolic disorders, with most of them possessing an acidic conjugable function that might compromise their pharmacokinetic distribution. Here, guided by docking calculations, nonacidic 6-ethyl cholane derivatives have been prepared. In vitro pharmacological characterization resulted in the identification of bile acid receptor modulators with improved pharmacokinetic properties.
Farnesoid X receptor (FXR) is a nuclear receptor that has emerged as a key regulator in the maintenance of hepatic steatosis, inflammation, and fibrosis. However, the role of FXR in renal fibrosis remains to be established. Here, we investigate the effects of the FXR agonist EDP-305 in a mouse model of tubulointerstitial fibrosis via unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO). Male C57Bl/6 mice received a UUO on their left kidney. On postoperative d 4, mice received daily treatment by oral gavage with either vehicle control (0.5% methylcellulose) or 10 or 30 mg/kg EDP-305. All animals were euthanized on postoperative d 12. EDP-305 dose-dependently decreased macrophage infiltration as measured by the F4/80 staining area and proinflammatory cytokine gene expression. EDP-305 also dose-dependently reduced interstitial fibrosis as assessed by morphometric quantification of the collagen proportional area and kidney hydroxyproline levels. Finally, yes-associated protein (YAP) activation, a major driver of fibrosis, increased after UUO injury and was diminished by EDP-305 treatment. Consistently, EDP-305 decreased TGF-β1-induced YAP nuclear localization in human kidney 2 cells by increasing inhibitory YAP phosphorylation. YAP inhibition may be a novel antifibrotic mechanism of FXR agonism, and EDP-305 could be used to treat renal fibrosis.-Li, S., Ghoshal, S., Sojoodi, M., Arora, G., Masia, R., Erstad, D. J., Ferriera, D. S., Li, Y., Wang, G., Lanuti, M., Caravan, P., Or, Y. S., Jiang, L.-J., Tanabe, K. K., Fuchs, B. C. The farnesoid X receptor agonist EDP-305 reduces interstitial renal fibrosis in a mouse model of unilateral ureteral obstruction.
Progressive familial intrahepatic cholestases (PFIC) are a spectrum of autosomal progressive liver diseases developing to end-stage liver disease. ATP8B1 deficiency caused by mutations in ATP8B1 gene encoding a P-type ATPase leads to PFIC1. The gene for PFIC1 has been mapped on a 19-cM region of 18q21-q22, and a gene defect in ATP8B1 can cause deregulations in bile salt transporters through decreased expression and/or activity of FXR. Point mutations are the most common, with the majority being missense or nonsense mutations. In addition, approximately 15% of disease-causing ATP8B1 mutations are annotated as splicing disrupting alteration given that they are located at exon-intron borders.
Here, we describe the hidden layer of computational biology information of rare codons in ATP8B1, which can help us for drug design.
Some rare codons in different locations of ATP8b1 gene were identified using several web servers and by in-silico modelling of ATP8b1 in Phyre2 and I-TASSER server, some rare codons were evaluated.
Some of these rare codons were located at special positions which seem to have a critical role in proper folding of ATP8b1 protein. Structural analysis showed that some of rare codons are related to mutations in ATP8B1 that are responsible for PFIC1 disease, which may have a critical role in ensuring the correct folding.
Investigation of such hidden information can enhance our understanding of ATP8b1 folding. Moreover, studies of these rare codons help us to clarify their role in rational design of new and effective drugs.
We review current evidence regarding changes in bile acid (BA) metabolism, transport, and signaling after bariatric surgery and how these might bolster fat mass loss and energy expenditure to promote improvements in type 2 diabetes (T2D) and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).
The two most common bariatric techniques, Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) and vertical sleeve gastrectomy (VSG), increase the size and alter the composition of the circulating BA pool that may then impact energy metabolism through altered activities of BA targets in the many tissues perfused by systemic blood. Recent reports in human patients indicate that gene expression of the major BA target, the farnesoid X receptor (FXR), is increased in the liver but decreased in the small intestine after RYGB. In contrast, intestinal expression of the transmembrane G protein-coupled BA receptor (TGR5) is upregulated after surgery. Despite these apparent conflicting changes in receptor transcription, changes in BAs after both RYGB and VSG are associated with elevated postprandial systemic levels of fibroblast growth factor 19 (from FXR activation) and glucagon-like peptide 1 (from TGR5 activation). These signaling activities are presumed to support fat mass loss and related metabolic benefits of bariatric surgery, and this supposition is in agreement with findings from rodent models of RYGB and VSG. However, inter-species differences in BA physiology limit direct translation and mechanistic understanding of how changes in individual BA species contribute to post-operative improvements of T2D and NAFLD in humans. Thus, details of all these changes and their influences on BAs' biological actions are still under scrutiny. Changes in BA physiology and receptor activities after RYGB and VSG likely support weight loss and promote sustained metabolic improvements.
This review will summarize the use of obeticholic acid (OCA) in treatment of primary biliary cholangitis (PBC). It seeks to discuss the mechanism of action, evidence for use, appropriate clinical use, and common adverse effects of OCA.
PBC is a chronic, progressive cholestatic liver disease that is a chronic progressive that may lead to end-stage liver disease and need for liver transplantation. Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) has been the mainstay of therapy for PBC for decades. Recent research has led to the discovery that bile acids act as hormones and have many effects, one of which is activating the farnesoid X receptor (FXR). Activation of FXR leads to decreased bile acid synthesis, inflammation, and fibrosis of the liver. OCA is a highly potent FXR agonist.
Several clinical trials demonstrated that OCA treatment in PBC led to a significant decrease in serum alkaline phosphatase, a marker for long-term survival. The US FDA-approved OCA in 2016, which led to incorporation of OCA into current guidelines as a second-line treatment for PBC. The most clinically relevant adverse effect of OCA is dose-related pruritus. We review the role of OCA and current guidelines in treatment of PBC.
Bile acids have recently been associated with the pathogenesis of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). We therefore evaluated the expression of bile acid receptors in the intestinal mucosa of IBS patients as well as the effects of bile acids on small intestinal epithelial cells.
Intestinal biopsy specimens were obtained from 15 IBS patients and 15 healthy controls. The effects of bile acid stimulation on trans-epithelial electrical resistance (TEER) and permeability in differentiated Caco-2 cells were measured. Proinflammatory cytokines were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. mRNA levels of bile acid receptors, including farnesoid X receptor (FXR), and cytokines were determined by real-time reverse transcription-PCR. Caco-2 cells were pre-incubated with the FXR antagonist guggulsterone.
FXR mRNA expression at the terminal ileum was increased in IBS patients. Chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) significantly decreased TEER, increased permeability, and increased interleukin-8 (IL-8) release from Caco-2 cells. Pre-incubation with guggulsterone blocked CDCA-mediated IL-8 release; however, the decrease in TEER was not reversed. CDCA-induced IL-6 and IL-8 mRNA levels were blocked by guggulsterone. CDCA increased IL-6, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), and vascular endothelial growth factor release, whereas guggulsterone significantly blocked IL-6 and TNF-α release.
FXR expression was elevated at the terminal ileum in IBS patients. CDCA increased proinflammatory cytokines, while guggulsterone blocked these increases.
Numerous micro-organisms naturally reside in the human body assuming a symbiotic, or, at times, even a dysbiotic relationship with the host. These microbial populations are referred to as the human microbiota. Host microbial populations are an important mediator of gastro-intestinal mucosal permeability, bile acid metabolism, short-chain fatty acids synthesis, fermentation of dietary polysaccharides and FXR/TGR5 signaling. Variations in the composition and function of gut microbiota have been observed in type 2 diabetes mellitus, insulin resistance and obesity, as well as in inflammatory bowel diseases. The microbial imbalance induced by such pathological processes is described as dysbiosis. In this review, we describe the pathophysiological links between type 2 diabetes mellitus and gut microbiota, explore the effect of anti-diabetic drugs on gut microbiota and suggest possible therapeutic targets.
Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) patients benefit from physical exercise. This study aimed to investigate the effect of acute exercise on hepatic gene expression in different mouse models of NAFLD.
C57BL/6J mice were fed with a control (CD) or a high fat (HFD) diet. AlbCrePtenflox/flox (Pten-KO) and Fxr-/- mice, two genetic models of NAFLD with insulin hypersensitivity and resistance, respectively, were fed with CD. After 4 weeks, mice were randomly assigned to exercise or sedentariness. Mice were killed 15 min or 3 h after the running/sedentary period. Genome-wide hepatic gene expression was evaluated with the Illumina Micro-array platform. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction confirmed changes in gene expression.
Acute exercise transiently affected the expression of genes involved in the immune response in C57BL/6 mice fed with CD and this effect normalized in the recovery phase. Acute exercise affected genes involved in gluconeogenesis in the insulin resistant Fxr-/- model. Genes involved in lipid metabolism were affected in C57BL/6 mice fed with CD, but not in mouse models of NAFLD. Genes involved in DNA damage response pathways were deregulated only in C57BL/6 mice fed with CD and not in mouse models of NAFLD.
The simultaneous analysis of different NAFLD models revealed that an acute exercise bout affects hepatic gene expression differentially according to animal models and that most of the differentially expressed genes are involved in glucose and fatty acid metabolism, immune regulation, and DNA damage response.
Environmental pollution contributes to fatty liver disease pathogenesis. Polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) exposures have been associated with liver enzyme elevation and suspected steatohepatitis in cohort studies. Male mice treated with the commercial PCB mixture, Aroclor 1260 (20 mg/kg), and fed high fat diet (HFD) for 12 weeks developed steatohepatitis. Receptor-based modes of action including inhibition of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor were previously proposed, but other mechanisms likely exist. Objectives were to identify and validate the pathways, transcription factors, and mechanisms responsible for the steatohepatitis associated with PCB and HFD coexposures. Comparative proteomics analysis was performed in archived mouse liver samples from the aforementioned chronic exposure study. Pathway and transcription factor analysis (TFA) was performed, and selected results were validated. Liver proteomics detected 1103 unique proteins. Aroclor 1260 upregulated 154 and downregulated 93 of these. Aroclor 1260 + HFD coexposures affected 55 pathways including glutathione metabolism, intermediary metabolism, and cytoskeletal remodeling. TFA of Aroclor 1260 treatment demonstrated alterations in the function of 42 transcription factors including downregulation of NRF2 and key nuclear receptors previously demonstrated to protect against steatohepatitis (e.g., HNF4α, FXR, PPARα/δ/γ, etc.). Validation studies demonstrated that Aroclor 1260 significantly reduced HNF4α protein levels, while Aroclor 1260 + HFD reduced expression of the HNF4α target gene, albumin, in vivo. Aroclor 1260 attenuated EGF-dependent HNF4α phosphorylation and target gene activation in vitro. Aroclor 1260 reduced levels of NRF2, its target genes, and glutathione in vivo. Aroclor 1260 attenuated EGF-dependent NRF2 upregulation, in vitro. Aroclor 1260 indirectly activated hepatic stellate cells in vitro via induction of hepatocyte-derived TGFβ. PCB exposures adversely impacted transcription factors regulating liver protection, function, and fibrosis. PCBs, thus, compromised the liver by reducing its protective responses against nutritional stress to promote diet-induced steatohepatitis. The identified mechanisms by which environmental pollutants influence fatty liver disease pathogenesis require confirmation in humans.
Nuclear receptors (NRs) are ligand-dependent transcription factors that regulate the transcription of target genes. Previous epidemiological and genetic studies have documented the association of NRs with the risk of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Although the mechanisms of action of NRs in IBD have not been fully established, accumulating evidence has demonstrated that NRs play complicated roles in regulating intestinal immunity, mucosal barriers, and intestinal flora. As one of the first-line medications for the treatment of IBD, 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) activates peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) to attenuate colitis. The protective roles of rifaximin and rifampicin partly depend on promoting pregnane X receptor (PXR) expression. The aims of this review are to discuss the roles of several important NRs, such as PPARγ, PXR, vitamin D receptor (VDR), farnesoid X receptor (FXR), and RAR-related orphan receptor gammat (RORγt), in the pathogenesis of IBD and management strategies based on targeting these receptors.
Increased levels of intestinal bile acids (BAs) are a risk factor for colorectal cancer (CRC). Here, we show that the convergence of dietary factors (high-fat diet) and dysregulated WNT signaling (APC mutation) alters BA profiles to drive malignant transformations in Lgr5-expressing (Lgr5+) cancer stem cells and promote an adenoma-to-adenocarcinoma progression. Mechanistically, we show that BAs that antagonize intestinal farnesoid X receptor (FXR) function, including tauro-β-muricholic acid (T-βMCA) and deoxycholic acid (DCA), induce proliferation and DNA damage in Lgr5+ cells. Conversely, selective activation of intestinal FXR can restrict abnormal Lgr5+ cell growth and curtail CRC progression. This unexpected role for FXR in coordinating intestinal self-renewal with BA levels implicates FXR as a potential therapeutic target for CRC.
The G-protein bile acid receptor 1 (GPBAR1) has emerged in the last decade as prominent target for the treatment of metabolic and inflammatory diseases including type 2 diabetes, obesity, and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. To date numerous bile acid derivatives have been identified as GPBAR1 agonists, however their clinical application is hampered by the lack of selectivity toward the other bile acid receptors. Therefore, non-steroidal GPBAR1 ligands able to selectively activate the receptor are urgently needed. With this aim, we here designed, synthesized and biologically evaluated ((1,2,4-oxadiazol-5-yl)pyrrolidin-3-yl) urea derivatives as novel potent GPBAR1 agonists. Particularly, compounds 9 and 10 induce the mRNA expression of the GPBAR1 target gene pro-glucagon and show high selectivity over the other bile acid receptors FXR, LXRα, LXRβ and PXR, and the related receptors PPARα and PPARγ. Computational studies elucidated the binding mode of 10 to GPBAR1, providing important structural insights for the design of non-steroidal GPBAR1 agonists. The pharmacokinetic properties of 9 and 10 suggest that the ((1,2,4-oxadiazol-5-yl)pyrrolidin-3-yl)ureydil scaffold might be exploited to achieve effective drug candidates to treat GPBAR1 related disorders.
Cholesterol gallstone disease have relationships with various conditions linked with insulin resistance, but also with heart disease, atherosclerosis, and cancer. These associations derive from mechanisms active at a local (i.e. gallbladder, bile) and a systemic level and are involved in inflammation, hormones, nuclear receptors, signaling molecules, epigenetic modulation of gene expression, and gut microbiota. Despite advanced knowledge of these pathways, the available therapeutic options for symptomatic gallstone patients remain limited. Therapy includes oral litholysis by the bile acid ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) in a small subgroup of patients at high risk of postdissolution recurrence, or laparoscopic cholecystectomy, which is the therapeutic radical gold standard treatment. Cholecystectomy, however, may not be a neutral event, and potentially generates health problems, including the metabolic syndrome. Areas covered: Several studies on risk factors and pathogenesis of cholesterol gallstone disease, acting at a systemic level have been reviewed through a PubMed search. Authors have focused on primary prevention and novel potential therapeutic strategies. Expert commentary: The ultimate goal appears to target the manageable systemic mechanisms responsible for gallstone occurrence, pointing to primary prevention measures. Changes must target lifestyles, as well as experimenting innovative pharmacological tools in subgroups of patients at high risk of developing gallstones.
Adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) plays a pivotal role in the regulation of carbohydrate, lipid, and protein metabolism in animals. In this study, we examined whether any cross talk exists between glucocorticoids and AMPK in the regulation of the liver bile acid biosynthesis pathway. Dexamethasone treatment decreased the growth performance of broiler chickens. The liver mRNA levels of fatty acid transport protein (FATP-1), farnesoid X receptor (FXR), AMPK alpha 1 subunit (AMPKα1), and glucocorticoid receptor were significantly upregulated in DEX-treated broilers; the gene expression of liver cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase (CYP7A1) was significantly downregulated. The protein level of liver CYP7A1 was significantly decreased by DEX treatment at both 24 and 72 h, while the protein level of p-AMPK/ t-AMPK stayed unchanged. In the in vitro cultured hepatocytes, compound C pretreatment blocked the increase in CYP7A1 protein level by DEX and significantly suppressed FATP-1, SREBP-1c, FXR, and CYP7A1 gene expression stimulated by DEX. Compound C treatment significantly reduces the protein level of p-AMPK, and the combination of compound C and DEX significantly reduces the protein level of t-AMPK. Thus, glucocorticoids affected liver AMPK and the bile acid synthesis signal pathway, and AMPK might be involved in the glucocorticoid effect of liver bile acid synthesis.
Cholestatic diseases are characterized by toxic bile acid (BA) accumulation, and abnormal BA composition, which subsequently lead to liver injury. Biochemical synthetic Calculus Bovis Sativus (CBS) is derived from natural Calculus Bovis, a traditional Chinese medicine, which has been used to treat hepatic diseases for thousands of years. Although it has been shown that CBS administration to 17α-ethinylestradiol (EE)-induced cholestatic rats improves bile flow and liver injury, the involved underlying mechanism is largely unknown. In this study, we showed that CBS administration to EE-induced cholestatic rats significantly decreased serum and hepatic BA levels and reversed hepatic BA composition. DNA microarray analysis suggested that the critical pathways enriched by CBS treatment were bile secretion and primary BA synthesis. These findings led us to focus on the effects of CBS on regulating BA homeostasis, including BA transport, synthesis and metabolism. CBS enhanced hepatic BA secretion by inducing efflux transporter expression and inhibiting uptake transporter expression. Moreover, CBS reduced BA synthesis by repressing the expression of BA synthetic enzymes, CYP7A1 and CYP8B1, and increased BA metabolism by inducing the expression of metabolic enzymes, CYP3A2, CYP2B10, and SULT2A1. Mechanistic studies indicated that CBS increased protein expression and nuclear translocation of hepatic and intestinal farnesoid X receptor (FXR) to regulate the expression of these transporters and enzymes. We further demonstrated that beneficial effects of CBS administration on EE-induced cholestatic rats were significantly blocked by guggulsterone, a FXR antagonist. Therefore, CBS improved BA homeostasis through FXR-mediated signaling in estrogen-induced cholestatic rats. Together, these findings suggested that CBS might be a novel and potentially effective drug for the treatment of cholestasis.
Bariatric surgery has been proved to be effective and sustainable in the long-term weight-loss and remission of metabolic disorders. However, the underlying mechanisms are still far from fully elucidated. After bariatric surgery, the gastrointestinal tract is manipulated, either anatomically or functionally, leading to changed bile acid metabolism. Accumulating evidence has shown that bile acids play a role in metabolic regulation as signaling molecules other than digestive juice. And most of the metabolism-beneficial effects are mediated through nuclear receptor FXR and membrane receptor TGR5, as well as reciprocal influence on gut microbiota. Bile diversion procedure is also performed on animals to recapitulate the benefits of bariatric surgery. It appears that bile acid alteration is an important component of bariatric surgery, and represents a promising target for the management of metabolic disorders.
To investigate the changes of bile acids in the liver during hemorrhagic shock (HS) and their potential to attenuate liver injury via activation of SIRT1 (sirtuin 1)-FXR (farnesoid X receptor) signaling.
A Sprague-Dawley (SD) rat HS model was established, while HepG2 cells were hypoxically cultured to simulate HS in vitro. Liver bile acids (BA) were profiled with ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS). FXR expression was detected by western blot and immunohistochemistry. The mRNA levels of SIRT1 and FXR were detected by polymerase chain reaction. Protein expression of SIRT1, FoxM1, NF-κB, acetyl-NF-κB, p53, and acetyl-p53 was analyzed by western blot. Hepatocyte apoptosis and proliferation were measured by TUNEL assay and Ki-67 staining, respectively. Serum and supernatant cytokines were analyzed using ELISA assays. Liver injury was also assessed. To investigate the possible mechanisms, SIRT1 agonist (SRT1720), SIRT1 inhibitor (EX527), and FXR inhibitor (Z-guggulsterone) were used.
Tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA) in the liver decreased significantly after HS. SIRT1 and FXR expression was time-dependently downregulated by HS or hypoxia condition. TUDCA upregulated SIRT1-FXR activity, which inhibited expression and acetylation of NF-κB and p53 and increased FoxM1 expression, leading to decreased inflammatory response and apoptosis and increased proliferative capacity in hepatocytes, and attenuation of liver injury. EX527 pretreatment reversed the protective effect of TUDCA. Moreover, Z-guggulsterone supplementation decreased the protective effect of TUDCA in vitro.
TUDCA in the liver decreased during HS. TUDCA supplementation might attenuate HS-induced liver injury by upregulating SIRT1-FXR signaling.
Recent findings have shown that Farnesoid X Receptor (FXR) antagonists might be useful in the treatment of cholestasis and related metabolic disorders. In this paper, we report the discovery of a new chemotype of FXR antagonists featured by a 3,5-disubstituted oxadiazole core. In total, 35 new derivatives were designed and synthesized, and notably, compounds 3f and 13, containing a piperidine ring, displayed the best antagonistic activity against FXR with promising cellular potency (IC50 = 0.58 ± 0.27 and 0.127 ± 0.02 μM, respectively). The excellent pharmacokinetic properties make compound 3f the most promising lead identified in this study.
Acetaminophen misuse is a leading cause of acute liver failure and liver transplantation for which therapy is poorly effective. FXR ligands have shown effective in reducing liver injury in several experimental and clinical settings. In this Letter, we have elaborated on the structure of GW4064, the first nonsteroidal agonist for FXR, to identify novel isoxazoles endowed with FXR agonistic activity and improved ADME properties. The pharmacological characterization and molecular docking studies for the structure-activity rationalization allowed the identification of several FXR agonists with nanomolar potency in transactivation and SRC-1 recruitment assays. This characterization resulted in the identification of a potent FXR agonist, compound 20 that was orally active, and rescued mice from acute liver failure caused by acetaminophen overdose in a FXR-dependent manner.
The bile acid (BA) nuclear receptor, farnesoid X receptor (FXR/NR1H4), maintains metabolic homeostasis by transcriptional control of numerous genes, including an intestinal hormone fibroblast growth factor-19 (FGF19, FGF15 in mouse). Besides, activation by BAs, the gene-regulatory function of FXR is also modulated by hormone or nutrient signaling-induced posttranslational modifications. Recently, phosphorylation at Tyr-67 by the FGF15/19 signaling-activated nonreceptor tyrosine kinase Src was shown to be important for FXR function in BA homeostasis. Here, we examined the role of this FXR phosphorylation in cholesterol regulation. In both hepatic FXR-knockout and FXR-knockdown mice, reconstitution of FXR expression up-regulated cholesterol transport genes for its biliary excretion, including scavenger receptor class B member 1 (Scarb1) and ATP-binding cassette subfamily G member 8 (Abcg5/8), decreased hepatic and plasma cholesterol levels, and increased biliary and fecal cholesterol levels. Of note, these sterol-lowering effects were blunted by substitution of Phe for Tyr-67 in FXR. Moreover, consistent with Src's role in phosphorylating FXR, Src-knockdown impaired cholesterol regulation in mice. In hypercholesterolemic apolipoprotein E-deficient mice, expression of FXR, but not Y67F-FXR, ameliorated atherosclerosis, whereas Src downregulation exacerbated it. Feeding or treatment with an FXR agonist induced Abcg5/8 and Scarb1 expression in WT, but not FGF15-knockout, mice. Furthermore, FGF19 treatment increased occupancy of FXR at Abcg5/8 and Scarb1, expression of these genes, and cholesterol efflux from hepatocytes. These FGF19-mediated effects were blunted by the Y67F-FXR substitution or Src downregulation or inhibition. We conclude that phosphorylation of hepatic FXR by FGF15/19-induced Src maintains cholesterol homeostasis and protects against atherosclerosis.
To investigate the effects of geniposidic acid( GPA) on hepato-enteric circulation in cholestasis rats,and to explore the mechanism based on the sirtuin 1( Sirt1)-farnesol X receptor( FXR) pathway,sixty SD rats were randomly divided into 6 groups:blank control group,ANIT model group,ursodeoxycholic acid group( 100 mg·kg~(-1)·d-1 UDCA),and GPA high,medium and low( 100,50 and 25 mg·kg~(-1)·d-1) dosage groups,10 rats in each group. Corresponding drugs were intragastrically( ig) administered for10 days. After administration on day 8,all rats except blank rats were administered with 65 mg·kg~(-1)α-naphthalene isothiocyanate( ANIT) once. After the last administration,the serum levels of alanine aminotransferase( ALT),glutamine oxalacetate aminotransferase( AST),gamma-glutamyltransferase( γ-GGT),alkaline phosphatase( ALP),total bilirubin( TB) and total bile acid( TBA)were measured,and the mRNA transcription levels of Sirt1,FXR,multidrug resistant associated protein 2( MRP2),bile salt export pump( BSEP),sodium taurocholate contractible polypeptide( NTCP) in liver and apical sodium bile acid transporter( ASBT),ileum bile acid binding protein( IBABP) in ileum were detected by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction( RT-PCR). The protein expression levels of Sirt1,FXR and NTCP were detected by Western blot; the expression of MRP2,BSEP in liver and ASBT,IBABP in ileum were determined by immunofluorescence three staining. Primary rat hepatocytes were cultured in vitro to investigate the inhibitory effect of GPA on a potent and selective Sirt1 inhibitor( EX 527),and the mRNA and protein expression levels of Sirt1 and FXR were detected by RT-PCR and Western blot. GPA significantly decreased the levels of ALT,AST,γ-GGT,ALP,TB,TBA in serum( P&lt;0.01) and improved the pathological damage of liver tissues in ANIT-induced cholestasis rats; significantly increased the mRNA and protein expression levels of Sirt1,FXR,MRP2,BSEP,NTCP in liver and ASBT,IBABP in ileum( P&lt; 0.01). In vitro primary hepatocytes experiment indicated that the gene and protein expression levels of FXR and Sirt1 were noticeably improved by GPA in primary hepatocytes inhibited by EX-527( P&lt;0.01). It was found that the improvement of GPA was in a dose-dependent manner. GPA could improve bile acid hepatointestinal circulation and play a liver protection and cholagogu role in cholestasis rats induced by ANIT.The mechanism may be that GPA activated FXR by regulating Sirt1,a key regulator of oxidative stress injury,and then the activated FXR could regulate protein of bile acid hepato-enteric circulation.
Chrysosplenium nudicaule,Tibetan name " Yajima",is recorded as an effective medicine for the treatment of liver and gallbladder diseases by Tibetan Pharmacopoeia published in the past dynasties,but its traditional efficacy has not yet been investigated by means of modern pharmacological research methods. In this paper,the protective effect of extract of C. nudicaule(ECN) on liver injury in mice was observed by using the mice model of intrahepatic cholestasis(IC) induced by α-naphthyl isothiocyanate(ANIT) and the possible mechanism by which ECN work as the therapeutic agent was discussed. The results showed that the serum levels of AST,ALT,ALP,DBIL,TBIL and TBA of the model mice were notably reduced in dose-dependent manner(P&lt;0. 01,P&lt;0. 05). The activity of SOD and GSH-Px in the liver homogenate of mice was increased,while the content of MDA was decreased(P&lt;0. 01,P&lt;0. 05).Pathological examination of liver in mice showed that ECN could improve the pathological changes of liver tissue in mice. The mRNA expression level of genes related to bile acid metabolism were detected by RT-PCR and the results suggested that ECN could significantly increase the expression of genes such as BSEP,FXR and MRP2(P&lt;0. 01,P&lt;0. 05),meanwhile significantly reduce the expression of CYP7 A1(P&lt;0. 01,P&lt;0. 05). These results confirmed the protective effect of ECN on intrahepatic cholestasis-induced liver injury in mice,and indicated that the mechanism may be related to activating FXR and its target genes,reducing bile acid synthesis and increasing bile acid excretion. This study provides a modern pharmacological basis for the clinical application of Yajima in Tibetan medicine.
Pregnancy is associated with progressive hypercholanemia, hypercholesterolemia and hypertriglyceridemia, which can result in metabolic disease in susceptible women. Gut signals modify hepatic homeostatic pathways, linking intestinal content to metabolic activity. We sought to identify whether enteric endocrine signals contribute to raised serum bile acids observed in human and murine pregnancies, by measuring fibroblast growth factor (FGF)19/15 protein and mRNA levels, and 7α-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one. Terminal ileal farnesoid X receptor(FXR)-mediated gene expression and apical sodium bile acid transporter (ASBT) protein concentration were measured by qPCR and western blotting. Shotgun whole genome sequencing and UPLC-MS were used to determine the cecal microbiome and metabonome. Targeted and untargeted pathway analyses were performed to predict the systemic effects of the altered metagenome and metabolite profiles. Dietary cholic acid supplementation was used to determine whether the observed alterations could be overcome by intestinal bile acids functioning as FXR agonists. Human and murine pregnancy were associated with reduced intestinal FXR signaling, with lower FGF19/15 and resultant increased hepatic bile acid synthesis. Terminal ileal ASBT protein was reduced in murine pregnancy. Cecal bile acid conjugation was reduced in pregnancy due to elevated bile salt hydrolase-producing Bacteroidetes. Cholic acid supplementation induced intestinal FXR signaling, which was not abrogated by pregnancy, with strikingly similar changes to the microbiota and metabonome as identified in pregnancy. CONCLUSION: the altered intestinal microbiota of pregnancy enhance bile acid deconjugation, reducing ileal bile acid uptake and lowering FXR induction in enterocytes. This exacerbates the effects mediated by reduced bile acid uptake transporters in pregnancy. Thus, in pregnant women and mice, there is reduced FGF19/15-mediated hepatic repression of hepatic bile acid synthesis, resulting in hypercholanemia. This article is protected by copyright.

Hypoglycemia is an increasingly recognized complication of bariatric surgery. Mechanisms contributing to glucose lowering remain incompletely understood. We aimed to identify differentially abundant plasma proteins in patients with post-bariatric hypoglycemia (PBH) after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB), compared to asymptomatic post-RYGB.
Proteomic analysis of blood samples collected after overnight fast and mixed meal challenge in individuals with PBH, asymptomatic RYGB, severe obesity, or overweight recruited from outpatient hypoglycemia or bariatric clinics.
The top-ranking differentially abundant protein at 120 min after mixed meal was fibroblast growth factor 19 (FGF-19), an intestinally derived hormone regulated by bile acid-FXR signaling; levels were 2.4-fold higher in PBH vs. asymptomatic post-RYGB (mean + SEM, 1094 ± 141 vs. 428 ± 45, P &lt; 0.001, FDR &lt; 0.01). FGF-19 ELISA confirmed 3.5-fold higher concentrations in PBH versus asymptomatic (360 ± 70 vs. 103 ± 18, P = 0.025). To explore potential links between increased FGF-19 and GLP-1, residual samples from other human studies in which GLP-1 was modulated were assayed. FGF-19 levels did not change in response to infusion of GLP-1 and PYY in overweight/obese individuals. Infusion of the GLP-1 receptor antagonist exendin 9-39 in recently operated asymptomatic post-RYGB did not alter FGF-19 levels after mixed meal. By contrast, GLP-1 receptor antagonist infusion yielded a significant increase in FGF-19 levels after oral glucose in individuals with PBH. While plasma bile acids did not differ between PBH and asymptomatic post-RYGB, these data suggest unique interrelationships between GLP-1 and FGF-19 in PBH.
Taken together, these data support FGF-19 as a potential contributor to insulin-independent pathways driving postprandial hypoglycemia in PBH.
The farnesoid X receptor (FXR) regulates inflammation and immune responses in a subset of immune-mediated diseases. We previously reported that FXR expression promotes tumor cell proliferation in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Here we study the relevance of FXR to the immune microenvironment of NSCLC. We found an inverse correlation between FXR and PD-L1 expression in a cohort of 408 NSCLC specimens; from this, we identified a subgroup of FXRhighPD-L1low patients. We showed that FXR downregulates PD-L1 via transrepression and other mechanisms in NSCLC. Cocultured with FXRhighPD-L1low NSCLC cell lines, effector function and proliferation of CD8+ T cell in vitro are repressed. We also detected downregulation of PD-L1 in FXR-overexpressing Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) mouse syngeneic models, indicating an FXRhighPD-L1low subtype in which FXR suppresses tumor-infiltrating immune cells. Anti-PD-1 therapy was effective against FXRhighPD-L1low mouse LLC tumors. Altogether, our findings demonstrate an immunosuppressive role for FXR in the FXRhighPD-L1low NSCLC subtype and provide translational insights into therapeutic response in PD-L1low NSCLC patients treated with anti-PD-1. We recommend FXRhighPD-L1low as a biomarker to predict responsiveness to anti-PD-1 immunotherapy.
The etiology of autoimmune liver diseases, such as autoimmune hepatitis (AIH), primary biliary cholangitis (PBC), and primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), still remains largely unknown and no therapeutic agents that are able to "cure" these diseases have been developed. Although corticosteroids for AIH and ursodeoxycholic acid for PBC have been shown to significantly improve liver transplantation (LT)-free survival and are recommended as first-line drugs, treatment strategies for patients who show incomplete response to these drugs have not yet been fully established. No drug is significantly associated with long LT-free survival in PSC patients. Nevertheless, with progress in genetics, immunology, and cellular biology, several new compounds or antibodies are expected to have an effect on autoimmune liver diseases and several drugs are under consideration for clinical use. Although most clinical trials have been carried out in the USA or Europe, some are, or will be, undertaken in Japan in the future. In this review, the current standard-of-care of autoimmune liver diseases will be summarized, together with emerging novel treatments relevant to clinical practice in Japan.
The function of MDR3 is important in bile acid transport. The miRNAs can suppress the expression of gene through combining mRNA of target gene. The regulation about MDR3 mediated by FXR or PPARα in cholestasis is clear, but the mechanism through miRNA is hardly reported. We aimed to find out the miRNA, which could suppress MDR3 expression and the significance of this connection in cholestasis.
We measured hsa-miR-378a-5p expression level in liver tissues from 20 patients with cholestasis and 15 patients without cholestasis by quantitative PCR. We also tested the level of clinical features of the same group. HepG2 cell lines were performed experiments to discover the connection between hsa-miR-378a-5p and MDR3, including transient transfection, RNA and protein extraction, qPCR, Western blotting and luciferase reporter assay.
A significant decrease of miR-378a-5p was observed in obstructive cholestasis patient liver tissues compared to control group. We also find that the miR-378a-5p expression is correlated to several clinical features, which are important biomarkers in cholestatic liver injury. Then we predicted that MDR3 may be the target gene of miR-378a-5p through miRanda v3.3a. We programed the transient transfection of mimics and inhibitor on HepG2 cell lines, and detected the mRNA and protein expression of MRP2, MRP3 and MDR3. The results suggested that miR-378a-5p could negatively regulate MDR3 expression in both mRNA and protein expression level, and this regulation is specific. We didn't find same regulation in MRP2 and MRP3. Dual luciferase assays proved this regulation is mediated by a direct binding between miR-378a-5p and CDS of MDR3.
We found that hsa-miR-378a-5p expression was down-regulated in cholestatic liver tissues, compared to control liver tissues. Transient transfection and luciferase reporter assay in HepG2 cell lines results suggest that hsa-miR-378a-5p can directly combine MDR3 mRNA and suppress MDR3 protein expression. The down-regulated hsa-miR-378a-5p may cause a protective alteration through up-regulating MDR3 expression in cholestasis.
The objective of this study was to determine the effects of sanshoamides and capsaiciniods on plasma and liver lipid levels and the mRNA expression levels of key receptors involved in cholesterol metabolism in hyperlipidemic rats. A total of 56 three-week-old female Sprague-Dawley rats were assigned to 7 treatment groups based on initial body weight (n = 8 rats per group). With certain combinations of sanshoamides and capsaicinoids significantly increased food intake, reduced lipid levels in blood and liver, improved histological characteristics of a fatty liver, down regulated mRNA expression levels of cholesterol 7-alpha-hydroxylase (CYP7A1), 3-hydroxyl-3-methylglutary CoA (HMG-CoA) and Farnesoid X Receptor (FXR) in liver and apical sodium-dependent bile acid transporter, Ileal Bile Acid Binding Protein and FXR in the ileum in hyperlipidemic rats. These results indicated that dietary supplementation with sanshoamides and capsaicinoids reduced blood lipid levels and improved cholesterol metabolism in hyperlipidemic rats.
Critically ill patients frequently present with the systemic inflammatory response syndrome, which is largely a reflection of the liver's response to injury. Underlying hepatic congestion is a major risk factor for hypoxic liver injury, the most common cause for hepatocellular injury. Cholestatic liver injury often occurs in critically ill patients due to inhibition of farnesoid X receptor (FXR), the main regulator of bile acid handling, particularly in the liver and intestines. Additional injury to the liver occurs due to alterations in the bile acid pool with increased cytotoxic forms and disturbance in the typical processing of xenobiotics in the liver.
The current study investigated whether bile diversion (BD) improves metabolic phenotype under farnesoid X receptor (FXR) deficiency.
BD was performed in high-fat diet (HFD)-fed FXR knockout (FXRko) and wild-type (WT) animals. Metabolic phenotypes, circulating enteroendocrine hormones, total bile acids (BAs) and BA composition, and cecal gut microbiota were analyzed.
FXR-deficient mice were resistant to HFD-induced obesity; however, FXR-deficient mice also developed hyperglycemia and exhibited increased liver weight, liver steatosis, and circulating triglycerides. BD increased circulating total BAs and taurine-b-muricholic acid, which were in line with normalized hyperglycemia and improved glucose tolerance in HFD-fed WT mice. FXR deficiency also increased total BAs and taurine-b-muricholic acid, but these animals remained hyperglycemic. While BD improved metabolic phenotype in HFD-fed FXRko mice, these improvements were not as effective as in WT mice. BD increased liver expression of fibroblast growth factor 21 and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator-1β and elevated circulating glucagon-like peptide-1 levels in WT mice but not in FXRko mice. FXR deficiency altered gut microbiota composition with a specific increase in phylum Proteobacteria that may act as a possible microbial signature of some diseases. These cellular and molecular changes in FXRko mice may contribute to resistance toward improved metabolism.
FXR signaling plays a pivotal role in improved metabolic phenotype following BD surgery.
Cholestasis, which is characterized by bile acid (BA) overload within the hepatocytes, is a major contributor to liver injury. The dysregulation of bile acid homeostasis, such as excessive bile acid synthesis and defected secretion, leads to intracellular retention of hydrophobic bile acid which undermines the physiological function of hepatocytes. Cholestasis can further develop into hepatic fibrosis and cirrhosis, and eventually life-threating liver failure. In the liver, BA-activated FXR can reduce hepatic BA concentration by negative feedback regulation. Clinically, FXR and PPARα are the pharmacological targets of obeticholic acid and fenofibrate for the treatment of primary biliary cirrhosis, respectively. Formononetin, a natural isoflavone compound, exerts beneficial effects in various biological processes, such as anti-inflammation, anti-tumor. However, the role of formononetin in bile acid metabolism remains unclear. Herein, we show that formononetin improves hepatic/systemic bile acid metabolism and protects against ANIT-induced liver injury. Mechanistically, formononetin improves the genes profile orchestrating bile acid homeostasis through modulating SIRT1-FXR signaling pathway. Moreover, formononetin attenuated ANIT-induced inflammatory response by inactivating JNK inflammation pathway in PPARα dependent manner. Taken together, our study demonstrates that formononetin ameliorates hepatic cholestasis by upregulating expression of SIRT1 and activating PPARα, which is an important anti-cholestatic mechanism of formononetin.
The tumor microenvironment is a complex and dynamic cellular community comprising the tumor epithelium and various tumor-supporting cells such as immune cells, fibroblasts, immunosuppressive cells, adipose cells, endothelial cells, and pericytes. The interplay between the tumor microenvironment and tumor cells represents a key contributor to immune evasiveness, physiological hardiness and the local and systemic invasiveness of malignant cells. Nuclear receptors are master regulators of physiological processes and are known to play pro-/anti-oncogenic activities in tumor cells. However, the actions of nuclear receptors in tumor-supporting cells have not been widely studied. Given the excellent druggability and extensive regulatory effects of nuclear receptors, understanding their biological functionality in the tumor microenvironment is of utmost importance. Therefore, the present review aims to summarize recent evidence about the roles of nuclear receptors in tumor-supporting cells and their implications for malignant processes such as tumor proliferation, evasion of immune surveillance, angiogenesis, chemotherapeutic resistance, and metastasis. Based on findings derived mostly from cell culture studies and a few in vivo animal cancer models, the functions of VDR, PPARs, AR, ER and GR in tumor-supporting cells are relatively well-characterized. Evidence for other receptors, such as RARβ, RORγ, and FXR, is limited yet promising. Hence, the nuclear receptor signature in the tumor microenvironment may harbor prognostic value. The clinical prospects of a tumor microenvironment-oriented cancer therapy exploiting the nuclear receptors in different tumor-supporting cells are also encouraging. The major challenge, however, lies in the ability to develop a highly specific drug delivery system to facilitate precision medicine in cancer therapy.
Primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) is an autoimmune hepatobiliary disorder characterised by destruction of liver bile ducts leading to intrahepatic cholestasis. It is a disease associated with significant morbidity, and is characterised in particular, by intractable pruritus for which treatments are often unsuccessful. Although used in clinical practice by dermatologists in the UK, the evidence base for phototherapy in this condition is not well documented. Case studies have reported on the clinical outcome of phototherapy in cholestatic pruritus which are summarised in this review. In addition, this review considers recent studies that provide insight into the pathophysiology of itch in PBC; these include the role of bile salts, autotaxin and specific receptors including G-protein-coupled bile acid receptor, Gpbar1 (TGR5) and the nuclear transcription factor farnesoid X receptor (FXR). Through use of a focused search strategy using PubMed and subsequent literature review, we propose testable hypotheses for the mechanism of action of phototherapy in attenuating itch through modulation of these specific signalling pathways. Such studies could subsequently lead to increased mechanistic understanding, identification of novel therapeutic targets and the potential to refine phototherapy protocols, leading to improved control of itch and quality of life of PBC patients.

Enteroendocrine L cells and GLP-2 secretion are activated in the intestinal adaptation process following bowel resection in short bowel patients. Our aim was to assess whether enteral activation of Takeda G-protein-coupled receptor 5 (TGR5) expressed in enteroendocrine L cells could augment endogenous GLP-2 secretion and the intestinal adaptation response in a piglet model. In study 1, parenterally-fed, neonatal pigs (n=6/group) were gavaged with vehicle, olive extract (OE) at 10 or 50 mg/kg, or ursolic acid (UA) 10 mg/kg and plasma GLP-2 were measured for 6 hr. In study 2, neonatal pigs (n=6-8/group) received either transection or 80% mid-small intestine resection and after 2 d assigned to treatments for 10 d including: 1) transection + vehicle (Sham), 2) resection + vehicle (SBS), 3) resection + (30 mg UA)(SBS-UA), 4) resection + (180 mg/kg OE)(SBS-OE). We measured plasma GLP-2, intestinal histology, cell proliferation, gene expression as well as whole body citrulline-arginine kinetics and bile acid profiles. In study 1, GLP-2 secretion was increased by UA and tended be with OE. In study 2, SBS alone but not additional treatment with either TGR5 agonist resulted in increased mucosal thickness and crypt cell proliferation in remnant jejunum and ileum sections. SBS increased biliary and ileal concentration of bile acids and expression of inflammatory and FXR-target genes, but these measures were suppressed by UA treatment. In conclusion, UA is an effective oral GLP-2 secretagogue in parenterally-fed pigs but was not capable of augmenting GLP-2 secretion nor the intestinal adaptation response after massive small bowel resection.
Mortality associated with liver disease was observed in patients with short bowel syndrome (SBS); however, its mechanism remains unclear. Bile acid (BA) dysmetabolism may be one of the putative mechanisms, and farnesoid X receptor (FXR) is the key regulator of BA synthesis. Here, we showed that in a rat model of small bowel resection associated with liver disease (SBR-ALD), BA composition of hepatic tissues reflected a larger proportion of primary and secondary unconjugated BAs, and those of colon contents and serum showed an increased ratio of secondary unconjugated BAs. Both hepatic and intestinal regulation of BA synthesis was characterized by a blunted hepatic FXR activation response. Gene expression of the key enzymes in BA synthesis was activated. After intervention with FXR agonist GW4064, both liver histology and serum transaminase activity were improved, which demonstrated the attenuation of SBR-ALD. BA compositions of hepatic tissue, colon contents, and serum were recovered and were closer to those of the sham group. Expression levels of hepatic FXR and its target genes were activated. The study showed that FXR agonist GW4064 could balance BA dysmetabolism to alleviate hepatotoxicity in SBR animals. GW4064 intervention resulted in a decrease in fecal bile excretion and elevated plasma/hepatic conjugated BA levels. GW4064 increased the reabsorption of conjugated BAs by inducing ASBT expression in the ileum. Concomitantly, FXR activation in the presence of GW4064 decreased BA production by repressing the expression of key synthetases. These findings provide a clinical research direction for the prevention of SBS with liver disease.
Farnesoid X receptor (FXR) is a transcription factor that can be activated by bile acid as well as influenced bile acid metabolism. β-cell bile acid metabolism is mediated by FXR and closely related to the regulation of blood glucose (BG). FXR can regulate BG through multiple pathways. This review summarises recent studies on FXR regulation of BG balance via bile acid regulation, lowering glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), inhibiting gluconeogenesis, increasing insulin secretion and enhancing insulin sensitivity. In addition, the current review provides additional insight into the relationship between FXR and BG which may provide a new theoretical basis for further study on the role of FXR.
The heavy metal cadmium (Cd) is a contaminant widely distributed in the food chain. In the present study, 8-week oral administration of a probiotic strain, Lactobacillus plantarum CCFM8610, markedly decreased blood Cd levels in volunteers. Further animal study showed that three L. plantarum strains administered orally exhibited significantly different effects on the regulation of bile acid (BA) metabolism and Cd excretion in mice. Among the strains, L. plantarum CCFM8610 showed the most significant effects on enhancing hepatic BA synthesis, biliary glutathione output, and fecal BA excretion. Biliary Cd output and fecal Cd excretion were markedly increased after L. plantarum CCFM8610 administration, resulting in a marked reduction in tissue Cd levels. The regulation of BA homeostasis and Cd excretion was due to the suppression of the enterohepatic farnesoid X receptor-fibroblast growth factor 15 (FXR-FGF15) axis by L. plantarum CCFM8610 and could be abolished by treatment with the FXR agonist GW4064. The regulatory effects were also related to the gut microbiota, as antibiotic pretreatment reversed L. plantarum CCFM8610-induced effects in BA and Cd metabolism.
Hepatic steatosis continues to present a major challenge in liver transplantation. These organs have been shown to have increased susceptibility to cold ischemia/reperfusion (CIR) injury in comparison with otherwise comparable lean livers; the mechanisms governing this increased susceptibility to CIR injury are not fully understood. Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress is an important link between hepatic steatosis, insulin resistance, and metabolic syndrome. In this study, we investigated ER stress signaling and blockade in the mediation of CIR injury in severely steatotic rodent allografts. Steatotic allografts from genetically leptin-resistant rodents had increased ER stress responses and increased markers of hepatocellular injury after liver transplantation into strain-matched lean recipients. ER stress response components were reduced by the chemical chaperone taurine-conjugated ursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA), and this resulted in an improvement in the allograft injury. TUDCA treatment decreased nuclear factor kappa B activation and the proinflammatory cytokines interleukin-6 and interleukin-1β. However, the predominant response was decreased expression of the ER stress cell death mediator [CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein homologous protein (CHOP)]. Furthermore, activation of inflammation-associated caspase-11 was decreased, and this linked ER stress/CHOP to proinflammatory cytokine production after steatotic liver transplantation. These data confirm ER stress in steatotic allografts and implicate this as a mediating mechanism of inflammation and hepatocyte death in the steatotic liver allograft.
It is estimated that more than 40 different lysosomal storage disorders (LSDs) cumulatively affect one in 5000 live births, and in the majority of the LSDs, neurodegeneration is a prominent feature. Neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses (NCLs), as a group, represent one of the most common (one in 12,500 births) neurodegenerative LSDs. The infantile NCL (INCL) is the most devastating neurodegenerative LSD, which is caused by inactivating mutations in the palmitoyl-protein thioesterase-1 (PPT1) gene. We previously reported that neuronal death by apoptosis in INCL, and in the PPT1-knockout (PPT1-KO) mice that mimic INCL, is at least in part caused by endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and oxidative stresses. In the present study, we sought to determine whether ER and oxidative stresses are unique manifestations of INCL or they are common to both neurodegenerative and non-neurodegenerative LSDs. Unexpectedly, we found that ER and oxidative stresses are common manifestations in cells from both neurodegenerative and non-neurodegenerative LSDs. Moreover, all LSD cells studied show extraordinary sensitivity to brefeldin-A-induced apoptosis, which suggests pre-existing ER stress conditions. Further, we uncovered that chemical disruption of lysosomal homeostasis in normal cells causes ER stress, suggesting a cross-talk between the lysosomes and the ER. Most importantly, we found that chemical chaperones that alleviate ER and oxidative stresses are also cytoprotective in all forms of LSDs studied. We propose that ER and oxidative stresses are common mediators of apoptosis in both neurodegenerative and non-neurodegenerative LSDs and suggest that the beneficial effects of chemical/pharmacological chaperones are exerted, at least in part, by alleviating these stress conditions.
Heat stress (HS) reduces the many sequelae of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced endotoxemia. Without HS, endotoxins have been shown to induce a transcriptional down-regulation of hepatocyte transport proteins for bile acids and organic anions. We performed experiments in isolated perfused rat livers at various times after LPS administration with and without HS pretreatment to determine whether HS would correct deficient transport of bromosulfophthalein (BSP). Possible mechanisms involved were investigated in livers from intact animals. In isolated perfused livers, LPS injection reduced BSP excretion to 48% compared with saline-injected controls (P &lt; 0.01). When HS was applied 2 hours prior to LPS, BSP excretion increased to 74% of controls (P &lt; 0.05 vs LPS and controls). Expression of the basolateral (Oatp1a1) and canalicular (Mrp2) organic anion transporter involved in the transport of BSP recovered more rapidly when HS preceded LPS application. Recovery of mRNA levels of these transporters occurred also earlier. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments and immunoelectron microscopy using a double immunogold labeling of heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) and various hepatocyte transporters suggested colocalization with HSP70 for the canalicular bile acid transporter (Bsep) in the subcanalicular space. In contrast, no colocalization was shown for Ntcp and anion transporters. In conclusion, we could show that HS enhances recovery of organic anion transporters and bile acid transporters following endotoxemia. Faster recovery of mRNA seems to be a key mechanism for anion transporters, whereas physical interaction with HSP70 plays a role in preservation of bile acid transporters. This interaction of HSP70 and canalicular transporters occurs only in pericanalicular vesicles but not when the protein is integrated into the plasma membrane.
This study aimed to investigate the protective effect of emodin on endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in rats with severe acute pancreatitis (SAP) and the underlying molecular mechanism. Sprague-Dawley male rats were randomly divided into sham operation group, SAP model group, and emodin treatment group. SAP was constructed through injecting sodium taurocholate into pancreatic and biliary duct in rats. Half an hour before establishing the animal model, emodin or sodium carboxymethylcellulose was intragastrically administrated to the rats in respective group. Rats were killed at 3, 6, and 12 h postdisease induction. The amylase, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels in serum, pancreatic histopathology, acinar ER ultrastructure, protein expression of Bip, IRE1α,TRAF2, ASK1, p-JNK, and p-p38 MAPK in pancreas were examined. Sodium taurocholate induced pancreatic injury and ER lumen dilated in exocrine pancreas in rats at 3-, 6-, and 12-h time points. ER stress transducers Bip, IRE1α, and their downstream molecules TRAF2, ASK1 in pancreatitis were upregulated. Furthermore, phosphorylation of JNK and p38MAPK in pancreas was increased, which induced high expression level of inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α and IL-6. Treatment with emodin obviously ameliorated pancreatic injury and decreased the release of amylase and inflammatory cytokines. Further studies showed that emodin significantly decreased the expression of Bip, IRE1α, TRAF2, and ASK1, inhibited phosphorylation of JNK and p38 MAPK in pancreas in rats at all time points. Emodin could reduce pancreatic injury and restrain inflammatory reaction in SAP rats partly via inhibiting ER stress transducers IRE1α and its downstream molecules.
Impaired fatty liver regeneration has already been reported in many genetic modification models. However, in diet-induced simple hepatic steatosis, which showed similar phenotype with clinical pathology, whether liver regeneration is impaired or not remains unclear. In this study, we evaluated liver regeneration in mice with diet-induced simple hepatic steatosis, and focused on excess lipid accumulation occurring during liver regeneration.
Mice were fed high fat diet (HFD) or control diet for 9-10 weeks. We analyzed intrahepatic lipid accumulation, DNA replication, and various signaling pathways including cell proliferation and ER stress during liver regeneration after partial hepatectomy. In addition, some of mice were pretreated with tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA), a chemical chaperone which alleviates ER stress, and then we estimated TUDCA effects on liver regeneration.
The peak of hepatocyte BrdU incorporation, the expression of proliferation cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) protein, and the expressions of cell cycle-related genes were observed in delayed time in HFD mice. The expression of phosphorylated Erk1/2 was also delayed in HFD mice. The amounts of liver triglyceride were at least twofold higher in HFD mice at each time point. Intrahepatic palmitic acid was increased especially in HFD mice. ER stress induced during liver regeneration was significantly higher in HFD mice. In HFD mice, pretreatment with TUDCA reduced ER stress and resulted in improvement of delayed liver regeneration.
In simple hepatic steatosis, lipid overloading occurring during liver regeneration might be caused ER stress and results in delayed hepatocyte DNA replication.
Epidemiologic studies indicate that environmental (smoking) and dietary factors (high fat) contribute to carcinogenesis in many organ systems. The aim of our study was to test the hypothesis that nicotine, a component of cigarette smoke, and sodium deoxycholate (NaDOC), a cytotoxic bile salt that increases in concentration in the gastrointestinal tract after a high fat meal, induce similar cellular stresses and that nicotine may enhance some of the NaDOC-induced stresses. We found that nicotine, at 0.8 microM, the very low sub-micromolar level occurring in the tissues of smokers: (1). increases oxidative stress; (2). activates NF-kappaB, a redox-sensitive transcription factor; (3). activates the 78 kD glucose regulated protein promoter, an indication of endoplasmic reticulum stress; (4). induces apoptosis; (5). enhances the ability of NaDOC to activate the 153 kD growth arrest and DNA damage promoter, an indication of increased genotoxic stress; and (6). enhances the ability of NaDOC to activate the xenobiotic response element. Our findings have applicability to G.I. cancer, in general, since smoking is a risk factor in the development of esophageal, pancreatic, gastric and colon cancer, and these cancers are also promoted by bile acids.
Evidence from live cell bioassays shows that the flat mucosa from patients with colon cancer exhibits resistance to bile salt-induced apoptosis. Three independent cell lines derived from the colonic epithelial cell line HCT-116 were selected for resistance to bile salt-induced apoptosis. These cell lines were developed as tissue culture models of apoptosis resistance. Selection was carried out for resistance to apoptosis induced by sodium deoxycholate (NaDOC), the bile salt found in highest concentrations in human fecal water. Cultures of HCT-116 cells were serially passaged in the presence of increasing concentrations of NaDOC. The resulting apoptosis resistant cells were able to grow at concentrations of NaDOC (0.5 mM) that cause apoptosis in a few hours in unselected HCT-116 cells. These cells were then analyzed for changes in gene expression. Observations from cDNA microarray, 2-D gel electrophoresis/MALDI-mass spectroscopy, and confocal microscopy of immunofluorescently stained preparations indicated underexpression or overexpression of numerous genes at either the protein or mRNA level. Genes that may play a role in apoptosis and early stage carcinogenesis have been identified as upregulated in these cell lines, including Grp78, Bcl-2, NF-kappaB(p50), NF-kappaB(p65), thioredoxin peroxidase (peroxiredoxin) 2, peroxiredoxin 4, maspin, guanylate cyclase activating protein-1, PKCzeta, EGFR, Ras family members, PKA, PI(4,5)K, TRAF2 and BIRC1 (IAP protein). Under-expressed mRNAs included BNIP3, caspase-6, caspase-3 and serine protease 11. NF-kappaB was constitutively activated in all three resistant cell lines, and was responsible, in part, for the observed apoptosis resistance, determined using antisense oligonucleotide strategies. Molecular and cellular analyses of these resistant cell lines has suggested potential mechanisms by which apoptosis resistance may develop in the colonic epithelium in response to high concentrations of hydrophobic bile acids that are associated with a Western-style diet. These analyses provide the rationale for the development of hypothesis-driven intermediate biomarkers to assess colon cancer risk on an individual basis.
Expression of heat-shock protein 47 in intact and fibrotic liver and in hepatic constituent cells was investigated in mice. Immunohistochemical study of intact liver and Western blot analysis of the protein from isolated liver cells revealed that stellate cells and smooth muscle cells of interlobular vessels, but not hepatocytes, Kupffer cells, or endothelial cells, expressed heat-shock protein 47. The protein was found in both vitamin-A-storing stellate cells and myofibroblast-like cells. The amount of the protein in cultured stellate cells was reduced by dexamethasone but was not regulated by quercetin, transforming growth factor beta, interferon gamma, or retinoic acid. In CCl4-treated or bile-duct-ligated mouse liver, the number of cells positive for heat-shock protein 47 markedly increased in the centrilobular area or around the periportal area, respectively, and the level of heat-shock protein 47 also increased.
Drugs and bile acids are taken up into hepatocytes by specialized transport proteins localized at the basolateral membrane, e.g., organic anion transporting polypeptides . Following intracellular metabolism by cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes, drug metabolites are excreted into bile or urine via ATP-dependent multidrug resistance proteins (MDR1 and MRPs). Bile acids are excreted mainly via the bile salt export pump (BSEP, ABCB11). The genes coding for drug and bile acid transporters and CYP enzymes are regulated by a complex network of transcriptional cascades, notably by the ligand-activated nuclear receptors FXR, PXR, and CAR and by the ligand-independent nuclear receptor HNF-4alpha. The bile acid synthesizing enzymes CYP7A1, CYP8B1, and CYP27A1 are subject to negative feedback regulation by bile acids, which is partly mediated through the transcriptional repressor SHP. The role of transcriptional cofactors, such as SRC-1 and PGC-1, in mediating the gene-specific effects of individual nuclear receptors is becoming increasingly evident.
Previous studies show that feedback inhibition of bile acid production by bile acids is mediated by multiple mechanisms, including activation of pregnane X receptor (PXR). Consistent with these studies, the antibiotic rifampicin, a ligand for human PXR, reduces hepatic bile acid levels in cholestasis patients. To delineate the mechanisms underlying PXR-mediated suppression of bile acid biosynthesis, we examined the functional cross-talk between human PXR and HNF-4, a key hepatic activator of genes involved in bile acid biosynthesis including the cholesterol 7-alpha hydroxylase (CYP7A1) and sterol 12-alpha hydroxylase (CYP8B1) genes. Treatment with rifampicin resulted in repression of endogenous human CYP7A1 expression in HepG2 cells that was reversed by PXR small interfering RNA. The coactivator PGC-1 enhanced transcriptional activity of HNF-4, and this enhancement was suppressed by rifampicin-activated PXR. Endogenous PGC-1 from mouse liver extracts bound to PXR, and recombinant PGC-1 directly interacted with both PXR and HNF-4 in vitro. Rifampicin-dependent interaction of PXR with PGC-1 was shown in cells by coimmunoprecipitation, and intranuclear localization studies using confocal microscopy provided further evidence for this interaction. In chromatin immunoprecipitation studies, rifampicin treatment did not inhibit HNF-4 binding to the native promoters of CYP7A1 and CYP8B1 but resulted in dissociation of PGC-1 and concomitant gene repression. Most interestingly, these rifampicin effects were also observed in the phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase gene that contains a functional HNF-4-binding site and is central to hepatic gluconeogenesis. Our study suggests that ligand-activated PXR interferes with HNF-4 signaling by targeting the common coactivator PGC-1, which underlies physiologically relevant inhibitory cross-talk between drug metabolism and cholesterol/glucose metabolism.
Tolerance to digestive stresses is one of the main factors limiting the use of microorganisms as live probiotic agents. Susceptibility to bile salts and tolerance acquisition in the probiotic strain Propionibacterium freudenreichii SI41 were characterized. We showed that pretreatment with a moderate concentration of bile salts (0.2 g/liter) greatly increased its survival during a subsequent lethal challenge (1.0 g/liter, 60 s). Bile salts challenge led to drastic morphological changes, consistent with intracellular material leakage, for nonadapted cells but not for preexposed ones. Moreover, the physiological state of the cells during lethal treatment played an important role in the response to bile salts, as stationary-phase bacteria appeared much less sensitive than exponentially growing cells. Either thermal or detergent pretreatment conferred significantly increased protection toward bile salts challenge. In contrast, some other heterologous pretreatments (hypothermic and hyperosmotic) had no effect on tolerance to bile salts, while acid pretreatment even might have sensitized the cells. Two-dimensional electrophoresis experiments revealed that at least 24 proteins were induced during bile salts adaptation. Identification of these polypeptides suggested that the bile salts stress response involves signal sensing and transduction, a general stress response (also triggered by thermal denaturation, oxidative toxicity, and DNA damage), and an alternative sigma factor. Taken together, our results provide new insights into the tolerance of P. freudenreichii to bile salts, which must be taken into consideration for the use of probiotic strains and the improvement of technological processes.
The mitochondrial and endoplasmic reticulum unfolded protein responses (UPR(mt) and UPR(ER)) are important for cellular homeostasis during stimulus-induced increases in protein synthesis. Exercise triggers the synthesis of mitochondrial proteins, regulated in part by peroxisome proliferator activator receptor-γ coactivator 1α (PGC-1α). To investigate the role of the UPR in exercise-induced adaptations, we subjected rats to 3 h of chronic contractile activity (CCA) for 1, 2, 3, 5, or 7 days followed by 3 h of recovery. Mitochondrial biogenesis signaling, through PGC-1α mRNA, increased 14-fold after 1 day of CCA. This resulted in 10-32% increases in cytochrome c oxidase activity, indicative of mitochondrial content, between days 3 and 7, as well as increases in the autophagic degradation of p62 and microtubule-associated proteins 1A/1B light chain 3A (LC3)-II protein. Before these adaptations, the UPR(ER) transcripts activating transcription factor-4, spliced X-box-binding protein 1, and binding immunoglobulin protein were elevated (1.3- to 3.8-fold) at days 1-3, while CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein homologous protein (CHOP) and chaperones binding immunoglobulin protein and heat shock protein (HSP) 70 were elevated at mRNA and protein levels (1.5- to 3.9-fold) at days 1-7 of CCA. The mitochondrial chaperones 10-kDa chaperonin, HSP60, and 75-kDa mitochondrial HSP, the protease ATP-dependent Clp protease proteolytic subunit, and the regulatory protein sirtuin-3 of the UPR(mt) were concurrently induced 10-80% between days 1 and 7 To test the role of the UPR in CCA-induced remodeling, we treated animals with the endoplasmic reticulum stress suppressor tauroursodeoxycholic acid and subjected them to 2 or 7 days of CCA. Tauroursodeoxycholic acid attenuated CHOP and HSP70 protein induction; however, this failed to impact mitochondrial remodeling. Our data indicate that signaling to the UPR is rapidly activated following acute contractile activity, that this is attenuated with repeated bouts, and that the UPR is involved in chronic adaptations to CCA; however, this appears to be independent of CHOP signaling.
Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), a chronic lung disease of prematurity, has been linked to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. To investigate a causal role for ER stress in BPD pathogenesis, we generated conditional knockout (KO) mice (cGrp78(f/f)) with lung epithelial cell-specific KO of Grp78, a gene encoding the ER chaperone 78-kD glucose-regulated protein (GRP78), a master regulator of ER homeostasis and the unfolded protein response (UPR). Lung epithelial-specific Grp78 KO disrupted lung morphogenesis, causing developmental arrest, increased alveolar epithelial type II cell apoptosis, and decreased surfactant protein and type I cell marker expression in perinatal lungs. cGrp78(f/f) pups died immediately after birth, likely owing to respiratory distress. Importantly, Grp78 KO triggered UPR activation with marked induction of the proapoptotic transcription factor CCAAT/enhancer-binding proteins (C/EBP) homologous protein (CHOP). Increased expression of genes involved in oxidative stress and cell death and decreased expression of genes encoding antioxidant enzymes suggest a role for oxidative stress in alveolar epithelial cell (AEC) apoptosis. Increased Smad3 phosphorylation and expression of transforming growth factor-β/Smad3 targets Cdkn1a (encoding p21) and Gadd45a suggest that interactions among the apoptotic arm of the UPR, oxidative stress, and transforming growth factor-β/Smad signaling pathways contribute to Grp78 KO-induced AEC apoptosis and developmental arrest. Chemical chaperone Tauroursodeoxycholic acid reduced UPR activation and apoptosis in cGrp78(f/f) lungs cultured ex vivo, confirming a role for ER stress in observed AEC abnormalities. These results demonstrate a key role for GRP78 in AEC survival and gene expression during lung development through modulation of ER stress, and suggest the UPR as a potential therapeutic target in BPD.
Pachymic acid (PA) is a purified triterpene extracted from medicinal fungus Poria cocos. In this paper, we investigated the anticancer effect of PA on human chemotherapy resistant pancreatic cancer. PA triggered apoptosis in gemcitabine-resistant pancreatic cancer cells PANC-1 and MIA PaCa-2. Comparative gene expression array analysis demonstrated that endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress was induced by PA through activation of heat shock response and unfolded protein response related genes. Induced ER stress was confirmed by increasing expression of XBP-1s, ATF4, Hsp70, CHOP and phospho-eIF2α. Moreover, ER stress inhibitor tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA) blocked PA induced apoptosis. In addition, 25 mg kg-1 of PA significantly suppressed MIA PaCa-2 tumor growth in vivo without toxicity, which correlated with induction of apoptosis and expression of ER stress related proteins in tumor tissues. Taken together, growth inhibition and induction of apoptosis by PA in gemcitabine-resistant pancreatic cancer cells were associated with ER stress activation both in vitro and in vivo. PA may be potentially exploited for the use in treatment of chemotherapy resistant pancreatic cancer. 
To investigate whether tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA) could attenuate contrast media (CM)-induced renal tubular cell apoptosis by inhibiting endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS), we exposed HK-2 cells to increasing doses of meglumine diatrizoate (20, 40, and 80 mg I/mL) for 2 to 16 hours, with/without TUDCA preconditioning for 24 hours. Cell viability test, Hoechst 33258 staining, and flow cytometry were used to detect meglumine diatrizoate-induced cell apoptosis, while real-time polymerase chain reaction and Western blot analysis were used to measure the expressions of ERS markers of glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78), activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4), and the apoptosis-related marker of caspase 12. Cell apoptosis and messenger RNA (mRNA) expression of GRP78 (P = .005), ATF4 (P = .01), and caspase 12 (P = .001) were significantly higher in the CM 4 hours group than the control as well as the protein expressions. The TUDCA preconditioning reduced the mRNA expression of GRP78, ATF4, and caspase 12 in the CM 4 hours groups (P = .009, .019, and .003, respectively) as well as the protein expression. In conclusion, TUDCA could protect renal tubular cells from meglumine diatrizoate-induced apoptosis by inhibiting ERS. 
The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) is a ligand-activated transcription factor which plays a role in the development of multiple tissues and is activated by a large number of ligands, including 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD). In order to examine the roles of the AHR in both normal biological development and response to environmental chemicals, an AHR knockout (AHR-KO) rat model was created and compared with an existing AHR-KO mouse. AHR-KO rats harboring either 2-bp or 29-bp deletion mutation in exon 2 of the AHR were created on the Sprague-Dawley genetic background using zinc-finger nuclease (ZFN) technology. Rats harboring either mutation type lacked expression of AHR protein in the liver. AHR-KO rats were also insensitive to thymic involution, increased hepatic weight and the induction of AHR-responsive genes (Cyp1a1, Cyp1a2, Cyp1b1, Ahrr) following acute exposure to 25 μg/kg TCDD. AHR-KO rats had lower basal expression of transcripts for these genes and also accumulated ~30-45-fold less TCDD in the liver at 7 days post-exposure. In untreated animals, AHR-KO mice, but not AHR-KO rats, had alterations in serum analytes indicative of compromised hepatic function, patent ductus venosus of the liver and persistent hyaloid arteries in the eye. AHR-KO rats, but not AHR-KO mice, displayed pathological alterations to the urinary tract: bilateral renal dilation (hydronephrosis), secondary medullary tubular and uroepithelial degenerative changes and bilateral ureter dilation (hydroureter). The present data indicate that the AHR may play significantly different roles in tissue development and homeostasis and toxicity across rodent species.
The aim of this study was to evaluate hepatic polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) and inflammatory response in an animal and cell model of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. Rats were divided into control, tunicamycin (TM)-treated, and TM + tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA)-treated groups. Hepatic ER stress was induced by TM and the ER stress inhibitor TUDCA was injected 30 min before induction of ER stress. Liver THLE-3 cells were treated with TM and TUDCA was administered in advance to decrease cytotoxic effects. Necroinflammation was evaluated in liver sections, while cell viability was determined using a 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay kit. ER stress was confirmed by immunofluorescence and Western blot analysis of C/EBP-homologous protein and 78-kDa glucose-regulated protein. Arachidonic acid (C20:4n-6), dihomo-γ-linolenic acid (C20:3n-6), eicosapentaenoic acid (C20:5n-3), and docosahexaenoic acid (C22:6n-3) in liver tissue and THLE-3 cells were determined by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Phospholipase A2 (PLA2), cyclooxygenase (COX), and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) were measured in tissue and cell samples. Hepatic ER stress was accomplished by TM and was alleviated by TUDCA. TM treatment significantly decreased PUFAs in both liver and THLE-3 cells compared to controls. PLA2, COX, and PGE2 levels were significantly increased in TM-treated rats and THLE-3 cells compared to controls. TUDCA leads to a partial restoration of liver PUFA levels and decreased PLA2, COX, and PGE2. This study reports decreased PUFA levels in ER stress and supports the use of omega-3 fatty acids in liver diseases demonstrating ER stress.
Few tissue markers are currently available to pathologists in the study of hepatocellular tumors. These markers should be used carefully taking into consideration not only morphology but also, and sometimes even more important, the clinical setting where the lesion to be diagnosed had developed. Glypican-3, heat shock protein 70, and glutamine synthetase (GS) are markers currently used, as a single panel, to discriminate the nature of a &lt;2 cm hepatocellular lesion lacking radiological features of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) detected in a cirrhotic patient under surveillance. Their use, which can be improved by clathrin heavy chain, is mostly requested on liver biopsy. Hepatocyte paraffin 1, arginase-1, polyclonal carcinoembryonic antigen, CD10, and bile salt export pump are tissue markers used to confirm, at histology, the diagnosis of HCC made by imaging before enrollment for phase III studies on novel anti-HCC drugs. In this setting, pathologists are usually requested a conclusive diagnosis on a liver biopsy of a poorly differentiated, necrotic, enriched in stem-phenotype, carcinoma. Liver fatty acid-binding protein, serum amyloid A, C-reactive protein, prostaglandin D2 synthetase, GS, and β-catenin can be used either on biopsy or surgical specimen to classify hepatocellular adenoma into hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF-1α) inactivated (steatotic), inflammatory, with dysregulation of sonic hedgehog and prostaglandin pathways, β-catenin mutated, and unclassified.
2,4-Dichlorophenol (2,4-DCP) is an environmental pollutant exhibiting a wide spectrum of toxic effects. We investigated the toxic effects and potential mechanisms underlying 2,4-DCP-induced hepatotoxicity. In vitro, 2,4-DCP caused hepatotoxicity manifested by a decrease in cell viability and inhibition of colony formation. Bip and CHOP expression was up-regulated at the mRNA and protein levels. Moreover, 2,4-DCP induced eIF2α phosphorylation and Xbp1 mRNA splicing, indicating that endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress was activated after exposure of HL7702 cells to 2,4-DCP for 12 hr. Furthermore, the mitochondrial membrane potential collapsed and apoptosis was triggered after exposure to 2,4-DCP for 24 hr. In vivo, 2,4-DCP caused histological changes in the liver, and dramatically elevated the serum alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels of mice. ER stress was also triggered in the liver of mice on days 1 and 3. The ER stress inhibitor TUDCA could partly relieve the liver damage, as indicated by the restoration of serum ALT and AST levels. Taken together, our results demonstrated that ER stress may serve as an early warning mechanism against 2,4-DCP-induced hepatotoxicity, and severe ER stress may lead to apoptosis.
We previously reported that endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress is induced in the subfornical organ (SFO) and the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of heart failure (HF) rats and is reduced by inhibition of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling. The present study further examined the relationship between brain MAPK signaling, ER stress, and sympathetic excitation in HF. Sham-operated (Sham) and HF rats received a 4-wk intracerebroventricular (ICV) infusion of vehicle (Veh) or the ER stress inhibitor tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA, 10 μg/day). Lower mRNA levels of the ER stress biomarkers GRP78, ATF6, ATF4, and XBP-1s in the SFO and PVN of TUDCA-treated HF rats validated the efficacy of the TUDCA dose. The elevated levels of phosphorylated p44/42 and p38 MAPK in SFO and PVN of Veh-treated HF rats, compared with Sham rats, were significantly reduced in TUDCA-treated HF rats as shown by Western blot and immunofluorescent staining. Plasma norepinephrine levels were higher in Veh-treated HF rats, compared with Veh-treated Sham rats, and were significantly lower in the TUDCA-treated HF rats. TUDCA-treated HF rats also had lower mRNA levels for angiotensin converting enzyme, angiotensin II type 1 receptor, tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-1β, cyclooxygenase-2, and NF-κB p65, and a higher mRNA level of IκB-α, in the SFO and PVN than Veh-treated HF rats. These data suggest that ER stress contributes to the augmented sympathetic activity in HF by inducing MAPK signaling, thereby promoting inflammation and renin-angiotensin system activity in key cardiovascular regulatory regions of the brain.
The objective was to investigate the interplay between transporter expression levels and substrate affinity in controlling the influence of aqueous boundary layer (ABL) resistance on transporter kinetics in an over-expression system. Taurocholate flux was measured across human apical sodium-dependent bile acid transporter (hASBT)-Madin-Darby canine kidney monolayers on different occasions and kinetic parameters estimated with and without considering ABL. In error-free simulation/regression studies, flux values were generated across a range of J max, Kt, and substrate concentrations. Similar evaluation was performed for transport inhibition studies. Additionally, simulation/regression studies were performed, incorporating 15% random error to estimate the probability of successfully estimating Kt. Across different occasions, experimental J max and Kt estimates for taurocholate were strongly associated (p &lt; 0.001; r2 = 0.82) when ABL was not considered. Simulation/regression results indicate that not considering ABL caused this association, such that Kt estimates were highly positively biased at high hASBT expression. In reanalyzing taurocholate flux data using the ABL-present model, Kt was relatively constant across occasions (approximately 5 microM) and not associated with J max (p = 0.24; r2 = 0.13). Simulations suggest that J max and Kt collectively determined ABL influence, which is most prominent under conditions of low monolayer resistance. Additionally, not considering ABL lead to negatively biased Ki estimates, especially at high J max. Error-inclusive simulation/regression studies indicated that the probability of successfully estimating Kt depended on the contribution of ABL resistance to flux; when flux became increasingly ABL-limited, probability of success decreased. Results indicate that ABL resistance can bias Kt and Ki estimates from overexpression systems, where the extent of bias is determined by transporter expression level and substrate affinity.
The human apical sodium-dependent bile acid transporter (hASBT) is a potential target for drug delivery, but an understanding of hASBT substrate requirements is lacking. The objective of this study was to characterize hASBT interaction with its native substrates, bile acids, and to evaluate C-24 conjugation and steroidal hydroxylation on transport affinity and inhibition potency.
Transport and inhibition kinetics of 15 bile acids were evaluated (cholate, chenodeoxycholate, deoxycholate, ursodeoxycholate, and lithocholate, including their glycine and taurine conjugates) with an hASBT-Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) monolayer assay. Samples were analyzed via liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) or chromatography-mass spectrometry-mass spectrometry (LC-MS-MS).
C-24 conjugation improved the inhibitory potency of all native bile acids. There was an inverse association between number of steroidal hydroxyl groups and inhibitory potency. Glycolithocholate and taurolithocholate were the most potent inhibitors. Results from transport studies followed trends from inhibition studies. Conjugated dihydroxy and monohydroxy bile acids exhibited the highest hASBT-mediated transport (i.e., lower Kt and higher Jmax). Across the 15 bile acids, Kt generally followed Ki. Additionally, Jmax correlated with Ki, where greater inhibition potency was associated with higher transport capacity.
C-24 conjugation and steroidal hydroxylation pattern modulated native bile acid interaction with hASBT, with C-24 effect dominating steroidal hydroxylation effect. Results indicate that bile acid binding to hASBT may be the rate-limiting step in the apical transport of bile acids.
Synthesize aminopiperidine conjugates of glutamyl-bile acids (glu-BAs) and develop a hASBT inhibition model using the conformationally sampled pharmacophore (CSP) approach.
glu-BAs aminopiperidine conjugates were synthesized. hASBT inhibition was measured as K(i). A CSP-SAR model was built using structural and physico-chemical descriptors and evaluated via cross-validation.
Twenty-nine aminopiperidine conjugates were synthesized. All inhibited hASBT, with K(i) ranging from 0.95 to 31.8 muM. Amidation of the piperidine nitrogen slightly decreased activity, while replacement by a carbon increased potency. Esterification of the glutamic acid linker had a minor impact, suggesting that a negative charge around C-24 is not required for binding. Three quantitative CSP-SAR models were developed. The best model (r (2) = 0.813, Q (2) = 0.726) included two descriptors: angle between 7-OH, alpha-substituent and centroid of rings B and C, and electrostatic contribution to the solvation free-energy. The model successfully distinguished between compounds with K(i) &lt; 16muM and K(i) &gt; 16muM. Models indicated that hydrophobicity, alpha substituent orientation, and partially compacted side chain conformation promote inhibitory potency. Qualitative CSP-SAR analysis indicated that the presence of an internal salt bridge, resulting in a locked conformation of the side chain, yielded weaker inhibitors.
Aminopiperidine conjugates of glu-BAs were potent hASBT inhibitors. A predictive and robust CSP-SAR model was developed.
Lipoprotein metabolism in FIC1 deficiency due to ATP8B1 mutations has never been studied sufficiently. This study was performed to investigate the detailed lipoprotein metabolism in benign recurrent intrahepatic cholestasis (BRIC) caused by FIC1 deficiency.
Lipoprotein profile and major lipoprotein regulators such as lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT), hepatic triglyceride lipase (HTGL), lipoprotein lipase, and cholesteryl ester transfer protein in a Japanese patient with BRIC were serially examined during a bout of cholestasis. Liver expression of farnesoid X receptor (FXR), which suppresses high-density lipoprotein (HDL) generation, was also examined.
Hypercholesterolemia and lipoprotein X accumulation were never observed throughout this study. When the cholestasis was severe, triglyceride-rich low-density lipoprotein (LDL) accounted for most of the plasma lipoproteins whereas HDL was hardly detectable. Concurrently, activities of all regulators were decreased, together with decreases of the serum parameter for liver protein synthesis. In particular, suppressions of LCAT and HTGL activities were severe and greatly contributed to the appearance of triglyceride-rich LDL. As the cholestasis improved, this LDL gradually transformed into normal LDL with the recoveries of LCAT and HTGL activities. The activities of all regulators for the last 1 to 2 months were normal but HDL remained depleted. His liver showed low FXR expression compared with control livers.
The present study showed an appearance of triglyceride-rich LDL due to suppressions of LCAT and HTGL activities and a depletion of HDL that is not able to be explained by lipoprotein regulators or FXR in our patient.
Maturity-onset diabetes of the young type 3 (MODY3) is caused by haploinsufficiency of hepatocyte nuclear factor-1alpha (encoded by TCF1). Tcf1-/- mice have type 2 diabetes, dwarfism, renal Fanconi syndrome, hepatic dysfunction and hypercholestrolemia. Here we explore the molecular basis for the hypercholesterolemia using oligonucleotide microchip expression analysis. We demonstrate that Tcf1-/- mice have a defect in bile acid transport, increased bile acid and liver cholesterol synthesis, and impaired HDL metabolism. Tcf1-/- liver has decreased expression of the basolateral membrane bile acid transporters Slc10a1, Slc21a3 and Slc21a5, leading to impaired portal bile acid uptake and elevated plasma bile acid concentrations. In intestine and kidneys, Tcf1-/- mice lack expression of the ileal bile acid transporter (Slc10a2), resulting in increased fecal and urinary bile acid excretion. The Tcf1 protein (also known as HNF-1alpha) also regulates transcription of the gene (Nr1h4) encoding the farnesoid X receptor-1 (Fxr-1), thereby leading to reduced expression of small heterodimer partner-1 (Shp-1) and repression of Cyp7a1, the rate-limiting enzyme in the classic bile acid biosynthesis pathway. In addition, hepatocyte bile acid storage protein is absent from Tcf1-/- mice. Increased plasma cholesterol of Tcf1-/- mice resides predominantly in large, buoyant, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) particles. This is most likely due to reduced activity of the HDL-catabolic enzyme hepatic lipase (Lipc) and increased expression of HDL-cholesterol esterifying enzyme lecithin:cholesterol acyl transferase (Lcat). Our studies demonstrate that Tcf1, in addition to being an important regulator of insulin secretion, is an essential transcriptional regulator of bile acid and HDL-cholesterol metabolism.
Corn silk (CS) extract contains large amounts of maysin, which is a major flavonoid in CS. However, studies regarding the effect of CS extract on cholesterol metabolism is limited. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to determine the effect of CS extract on cholesterol metabolism in C57BL/6J mouse fed high-fat diets.
Normal-fat group fed 7% fat diet, high-fat (HF) group fed 25% fat diet, and high-fat with corn silk (HFCS) group were orally administered CS extract (100 mg/kg body weight) daily. Serum and hepatic levels of total lipids, triglycerides, and total cholesterol as well as serum free fatty acid, glucose, and insulin levels were determined. The mRNA expression levels of acyl-CoA: cholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT), cholesterol 7-alpha hydroxylase (CYP7A1), farnesoid X receptor (FXR), lecithin cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT), low-density lipoprotein receptor, 3-hyroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (HMG-CoA reductase), adiponectin, leptin, and tumor necrosis factor α were determined.
Oral administration of CS extract with HF improved serum glucose and insulin levels as well as attenuated HF-induced fatty liver. CS extracts significantly elevated mRNA expression levels of adipocytokines and reduced mRNA expression levels of HMG-CoA reductase, ACAT, and FXR. The mRNA expression levels of CYP7A1 and LCAT between the HF group and HFCS group were not statistically different.
CS extract supplementation with a high-fat diet improves levels of adipocytokine secretion and glucose homeostasis. CS extract is also effective in decreasing the regulatory pool of hepatic cholesterol, in line with decreased blood and hepatic levels of cholesterol though modulation of mRNA expression levels of HMG-CoA reductase, ACAT, and FXR.
Steroid hormones, including glucocorticoids and androgens, have potent actions to regulate many cellular processes within the liver. The steroid A-ring reductase, 5β-reductase (AKR1D1), is predominantly expressed in the liver, where it inactivates steroid hormones and, in addition, plays a crucial role in bile acid synthesis. However, the precise functional role of AKR1D1 to regulate steroid hormone action in vitro has not been demonstrated. We have therefore hypothesised that genetic manipulation of AKR1D1 has the potential to regulate glucocorticoid availability and action in human hepatocytes. In both liver (HepG2) and non-liver cell (HEK293) lines, AKR1D1 over-expression increased glucocorticoid clearance with a concomitant decrease in the activation of the glucocorticoid receptor and the down-stream expression of glucocorticoid target genes. Conversely, knockdown of AKR1D1 using siRNA decreased glucocorticoid clearance and reduced the generation of 5β-reduced metabolites. In addition, the two 5α-reductase inhibitors finasteride and dutasteride failed to effectively inhibit AKR1D1 activity in either cell-free or hepatocellular systems. Through manipulation of AKR1D1 expression and activity, we have demonstrated its potent ability to regulate glucocorticoid availability and receptor activation within human hepatoma cells. These data suggest that AKR1D1 may have an important role in regulating endogenous (and potentially exogenous) glucocorticoid action that may be of particular relevance to physiological and pathophysiological processes affecting the liver.
Vitamin D-deficiency rickets, not responding to large treatment doses of oral vitamin D, suggest rare receptor mutations, malabsorption, or hepatobiliary dysfunction. We present a set of twins of Hispanic origin who presented with refractory vitamin D-deficiency rickets and failure to thrive (FTT) at 6 months of age. On follow-up, mild elevations in serum alanine transaminases and normal aspartate aminotransferase were noted. Subsequently, patients manifested fat-soluble vitamin deficiencies. More targeted evaluations revealed a diagnosis of 3β-hydroxy-Δ5-C27-steroid oxidoreductase deficiency. Treatment with oral bile acid replacement with cholic acid resolved rickets and promoted weight gain. Bile acid synthesis disorders should be suspected in refractory rickets in infancy, particularly in a clinical setting of FTT, even in the absence of substantial abnormalities in liver-function tests.

In cancer patients, metastasis of tumors to sentinel lymph nodes (LNs) predicts disease progression and often guides treatment decisions. The mechanisms underlying tumor LN metastasis are poorly understood. By using comparative transcriptomics and metabolomics analyses of primary and LN-metastatic tumors in mice, we found that LN metastasis requires that tumor cells undergo a metabolic shift toward fatty acid oxidation (FAO). Transcriptional coactivator yes-associated protein (YAP) is selectively activated in LN-metastatic tumors, leading to the up-regulation of genes in the FAO signaling pathway. Pharmacological inhibition of FAO or genetic ablation of YAP suppressed LN metastasis in mice. Several bioactive bile acids accumulated to high levels in the metastatic LNs, and these bile acids activated YAP in tumor cells, likely through the nuclear vitamin D receptor. Inhibition of FAO or YAP may merit exploration as a potential therapeutic strategy for mitigating tumor metastasis to LNs.
We explored the hypothesis that TGR5, the bile acid (BA) G-protein-coupled receptor highly expressed in biliary epithelial cells, protects the liver against BA overload through the regulation of biliary epithelium permeability.
Experiments were performed under basal and TGR5 agonist treatment. In vitro transepithelial electric resistance (TER) and FITC-dextran diffusion were measured in different cell lines. In vivo FITC-dextran was injected in the gallbladder (GB) lumen and traced in plasma. Tight junction proteins and TGR5-induced signalling were investigated in vitro and in vivo (wild-type [WT] and TGR5-KO livers and GB). WT and TGR5-KO mice were submitted to bile duct ligation or alpha-naphtylisothiocyanate intoxication under vehicle or TGR5 agonist treatment, and liver injury was studied.
In vitro TGR5 stimulation increased TER and reduced paracellular permeability for dextran. In vivo dextran diffusion after GB injection was increased in TGR5-knock-out (KO) as compared with WT mice and decreased on TGR5 stimulation. In TGR5-KO bile ducts and GB, junctional adhesion molecule A (JAM-A) was hypophosphorylated and selectively downregulated among TJP analysed. TGR5 stimulation induced JAM-A phosphorylation and stabilisation both in vitro and in vivo, associated with protein kinase C-ζ activation. TGR5 agonist-induced TER increase as well as JAM-A protein stabilisation was dependent on JAM-A Ser285 phosphorylation. TGR5 agonist-treated mice were protected from cholestasis-induced liver injury, and this protection was significantly impaired in JAM-A-KO mice.
The BA receptor TGR5 regulates biliary epithelial barrier function in vitro and in vivo through an impact on JAM-A expression and phosphorylation, thereby protecting liver parenchyma against bile leakage.
Activation of hedgehog (Hh) signaling contributes to the progression of Barrett's esophagus (BE), which increases the risk of esophageal adenocarcinoma. Recent clinical studies revealed that proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs) but not H2 receptor antagonists (H2RAs) were associated with a decreased risk of esophageal adenocarcinoma. We would like to know whether PPIs interfere with BE progression during BE treatment. Here, we explored the role of omeprazole on Hh signaling and expression of two crucial biomarkers of BE, SOX9 and CDX2. We demonstrated that bile acids elevated expression of Hh pathway target genes, such as GLI1 and PTCH1, and induced SOX9 and CDX2 up-regulation in both CP-A and CP-B cells. Omeprazole, but not famotidine, down-regulated these genes induced by bile acids. In addition, omeprazole-induced down-regulation of SOX9 and CDX2 was mediated by Hh signaling. To explore the mechanisms by which omeprazole inhibits Hh signaling, we performed luciferase assay but did not find any effects of omeprazole on the activity of GLI1 promoter, the critical transcription factor of Hh signaling. Therefore, we used miRNA sequencing and a bioinformatics tool in our study to identify the differently expressed miRNAs in BE organoids treated with or without omeprazole, and we identified miR-2116-3p was involved in omeprazole-mediated inhibition of Hh signaling and subsequent down-regulation of SOX9 and CDX2. Collectively, our data indicate omeprazole inhibits Hh signaling and subsequent SOX9 and CDX2 expression via up-regulating miR-2116-3p. We have demonstrated a novel acid-independent mechanism of omeprazole that might yield valuable insight into clinical management of BE progression, irrespective of acid reflux symptoms.
α-Calcitonin gene-related peptide (α-CGRP) is a 37-amino acid neuropeptide involved in several pathophysiological processes. α-CGRP is involved in the regulation of cholangiocyte proliferation during cholestasis. In this study, we aimed to evaluate if α-CGRP regulates bile duct ligation (BDL)-induced liver fibrosis by using a α-CGRP knockout (α-CGRP-/-) mouse model. α-CGRP-/- and wild-type (WT) mice were subjected to sham surgery or BDL for 7 days. Then, liver fibrosis and cellular senescence as well as the expression of kinase such as p38 and C-Jun N-terminal protein kinase (JNK) in mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) signaling pathway were evaluated in total liver, together with measurement of cellular senescence in cholangiocytes or hepatic stellate cells (HSCs). There was enhanced hepatic expression of Calca (coding α-CGRP) and the CGRP receptor components (CRLR, RAMP-1 and RCP) in BDL and in both WT α-CGRP-/- and BDL α-CGRP-/- mice, respectively. Moreover, there was increased CGRP serum levels and hepatic mRNA expression of CALCA and CGRP receptor components in late-stage PSC samples compared to healthy control samples. Depletion of α-CGRP reduced liver injury and fibrosis in BDL mice that was associated with enhanced cellular senescence of hepatic stellate cells and reduced senescence of cholangiocytes as well as decreased activation of p38 and JNK MAPK signaling pathway. Cholangiocyte supernatant from BDL α-CGRP-/- mice inhibited the activation and increased cellular senescence of cultured human HSCs (HHSCs) compared to HHSCs stimulated with BDL cholangiocyte supernatant. Taken together, endogenous α-CGRP promoted BDL-induced cholestatic liver fibrosis through differential changes in senescence of HSCs and cholangiocytes and activation of p38 and JNK signaling. Modulation of α-CGRP/CGRP receptor signaling may be key for the management of biliary senescence and liver fibrosis in cholangiopathies.
Fibroblast growth factor-19 (FGF-19) and its co-receptor, beta-klotho, regulate bile acid synthesis in the liver as an enterohepatic feedback mechanism. In this study, our aim was to investigate the circulating FGF-19 and β-klotho levels in intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP) cases.
A cross-sectional study including 40 women whose pregnancies were complicated with ICP were recruited for the study group. Forty randomly selected healthy pregnant women comprised the control group. The patient characteristics, including maternal age, gravidity, parity, gestational age at the time of diagnosis, body mass index (BMI), and obstetric history, were recorded. The serum FGF-19 and β-klotho concentrations were measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.
Maternal age, gravidity, parity, body mass index at assessment, and gestational age at blood sampling were similar between the two groups (p &gt; 0.05). Moreover, there were no significant differences in the FGF-19 and β-klotho concentrations between the two groups (p = 0.341 and p = 0.086, respectively). A positive correlation was detected between the β-klotho and FGF-19 levels, as well as between the FGF-19 level and BMI (r = 0.368, p = 0.020 and r = 0.389, p = 0.013, respectively).
The serum FGF-19 and β-klotho concentrations did not differ between the pregnancies with ICP and the healthy controls. However, in some cases, abnormalities in the FGF-19, β-klotho, and FGFR4 signaling system may play roles in the pathogenesis of ICP.
Post-hemorrhagic shock mesenteric lymph (PHSML) has an important role in the multiple organ injuries caused by severe shock. The current study investigated whether intravenous injection of PHSML induces organ injury in normal rats. Following the establishment of hemorrhagic shock in donor rats (40±2 mmHg, 3 h), PHSML was drained during hypotension at 1-3 h and then injected to normal rats through the femoral vein within 30 min. The mean arterial pressure (MAP) was measured, and samples were obtained for analysis of histology and biochemical indices at 2.5 h post-PHSML administration. PHSML administration resulted in a significant decrease in MAP at the early and late stage of the experiment. Structural damage of the lung, kidney, heart and liver was also observed, and the levels of urea, creatinine, aspartate aminotransferase, total bile acid and creatine kinase MB isoenzyme were increased in the plasma. Additionally, PHSML injection significantly increased the levels of trypsin, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), intercellular adhesion molecule-1 and receptor of advanced glycation end-products in the plasma, malondialdehyde in the lung and myocardium, and TNF-α in the lung, kidney, myocardium and liver. Intravenous injection of PHSML induced multiple organ injury in normal rats via increases in trypsin activity, inflammatory factors and free radical production. The findings indicate that PHSML return is an important contributor to organ damage following hemorrhagic shock.
Sortilin 1 (Sort1) is a member of the Vps10p domain intracellular trafficking receptor family. Genetic variations of the SORT1 gene are strongly associated with plasma cholesterol levels in humans. Recent studies have linked Sort1 to regulation of cholesterol metabolism in hepatocytes and pro-inflammatory response in macrophages, but the tissue-specific roles of Sort1 in lipid metabolism have not been well defined. We developed Sort1 floxed mice and investigated the development of Western diet (WD)-induced steatosis, hepatic inflammatory response, and hyperlipidemia in hepatocyte Sort1 KO mice and myeloid cell Sort1 KO mice. Our findings suggest that hepatocyte Sort1 deficiency attenuated diet-induced hepatic steatosis and hypercholesterolemia in mice. In contrast, myeloid Sort1 deficiency did not reduce hepatic cytokine expression or plasma cholesterol levels, but exacerbated hepatic triglyceride accumulation in WD-fed mice. Finally, we showed that treating WD-fed mice with an orally bioavailable Sort1 inhibitor, AF38469, decreased plasma cholesterol and hepatic cytokine expression. AF38469 treatment did not affect diet-induced obesity or insulin resistance, but was associated with reduced hepatic VLDL secretion and higher hepatic cholesterol 7α-hydrolase expression in WD-fed mice. In conclusion, findings from this study suggest that Sort1 loss-of-function in hepatocytes contributes to lower plasma cholesterol, and pharmacological inhibition of Sort1 attenuates diet-induced hypercholesterolemia in mice.
Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) represents a major unmet medical need. In a phase II double-blind, placebo-controlled study, we tested the safety and efficacy of cilofexor (formerly GS-9674), a nonsteroidal farnesoid X receptor agonist in patients without cirrhosis with large-duct PSC. Patients were randomized to receive cilofexor 100 mg (n = 22), 30 mg (n = 20), or placebo (n = 10) orally once daily for 12 weeks. All patients had serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) &gt; 1.67 × upper limit of normal and total bilirubin ≤ 2 mg/dL at baseline. Safety, tolerability, pharmacodynamic effects of cilofexor (serum C4 [7α-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one] and bile acids), and changes in liver biochemistry and serum fibrosis markers were evaluated. Overall, 52 patients were randomized (median age 43 years, 58% male, 60% with inflammatory bowel disease, 46% on ursodeoxycholic acid). Baseline median serum ALP and bilirubin were 348 U/L (interquartile range 288-439) and 0.7 mg/dL (0.5-1.0), respectively. Dose-dependent reductions in liver biochemistry were observed. At week 12, cilofexor 100 mg led to significant reductions in serum ALP (median reduction -21%; P = 0.029 versus placebo), gamma-glutamyl transferase (-30%; P &lt; 0.001), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (-49%; P = 0.009), and aspartate aminotransferase (-42%; P = 0.019). Cilofexor reduced serum C4 compared with placebo; reductions in bile acids were greatest with 100 mg. Relative reductions in ALP were similar between ursodeoxycholic acid-treated and untreated patients. At week 12, cilofexor-treated patients with a 25% or more relative reduction in ALP had greater reductions in serum alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, gamma-glutamyl transferase, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 1, C-reactive protein, and bile acids than nonresponders. Adverse events were similar between cilofexor and placebo-treated patients. Rates of grade 2 or 3 pruritus were 14% with 100 mg, 20% with 30 mg, and 40% with placebo. Conclusion: In this 12-week, randomized, placebo-controlled study, cilofexor was well tolerated and led to significant improvements in liver biochemistries and markers of cholestasis in patients with PSC.
Several marine Debaryomyces hansenii strains have shown probiotic effects on aquatic animals, and D. hansenii-derived β-glucans have recently provided immunostimulant effects on goat leukocytes. This study assessed the probiotic effects of live yeast D. hansenii CBS 8339 on newborn goats administered orally, and subsequently challenged in vitro with Escherichia coli. D. hansenii CBS 8339 demonstrated the capacity to survive gastrointestinal tract conditions (bile salts and acid pH tolerance) and adhere to goat intestine. Twelve Saanen × Nubian crossbred newborn goats (2.9 ± 0.47 kg) were fed with a controlled diet or D. hansenii (0.7 g/kg body weight per day)-supplemented milk for 30 days. Blood samples of newborn goats were taken at days 15 and 30, and peripheral blood leukocytes were isolated for bacterial challenge, and immunological and antioxidant analyses. Despite cell viability was higher in leukocytes of goat kids fed with the yeast supplement, protection against E. coli challenge was not significantly affected. On the other hand, at day 15, oral administration of D. hansenii enhanced respiratory burst and catalase activity and increased superoxide dismutase activity after challenge. In contrast, at day 30, administration of the yeast supplement increased peroxidase activity and enhanced nitric oxide production and catalase activity after challenge. Finally, the yeast-supplemented diet upregulated the expression of the receptor genes TLR (2, 4, 6), modulator genes Raf.1, Syk, and Myd88, transcription factor gene AP-1, and cytokine genes IL-1β and TNF-α only at day 15 in leukocytes from unchallenged goat kids. These results demonstrated that a short time (15 days) of orally administering the probiotic D. hansenii CBS 8339 to newborn goats stimulated innate immune and antioxidant parameters and the expression of immune-related gene signaling pathways.
Pyruvate is a normal constituent of the body that participates in carbohydrate metabolism and functions as a scavenger of free radicals. Calcium pyruvate monohydrate (CPM) is a more stable derivative that has proved its anti-inflammatory effect in experimental colitis, among other disorders, and that could also be considered a source of calcium. Thus, it would be useful for the treatment of diseases with an inflammatory component and a high prevalence of osteoporosis like the irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). The aim of the present study is to evaluate the effects of CPM in a rat model of chronic post-inflammatory visceral pain induced by deoxycholic acid (DCA) that resembles IBS. Rats were administered DCA for three days intracolonically and then treated daily with CPM (40 and 100 mg/kg) or gabapentin (70 mg/kg) (positive control) by oral gavage for 17 days. The treatments reduced the visceral hypersensitivity measured by response to colorectal distension and referred pain. DCA induced changes in the colonic immune response characterized by increased expression of the cytokine Il-1β and the inducible enzyme Cox-2, which was reduced by the treatments. DCA also decreased the gut expression of the mucins Muc-2 and Muc-3, which was normalized by CPM, whereas gabapentin only increased significantly Muc-3. Moreover, DCA increased the expression of Tlr3, which was decreased to basal levels by all the treatments. However, the serotonin receptor Htr-4, which was also elevated, was not affected by any of the treatments, indicating no effect through this signalling pathway. In conclusion, CPM ameliorated the visceral hypersensitivity and the referred pain caused by DCA, being as effective as the control drug. Furthermore, it improved the immune status of the animals, which could contribute to the visceral analgesia and the regeneration of the intestinal epithelial barrier integrity.
Fibroblast growth factor receptor 4 (FGFR4), a tyrosine kinase receptor for FGFs, is involved in diverse cellular processes, including the regulation of cell proliferation, differentiation, migration, metabolism, and bile acid biosynthesis. High activation of FGFR4 is strongly associated with the amplification of its specific ligand FGF19 in many types of solid tumors and hematologic malignancies, where it acts as an oncogene driving the cancer development and progression. Currently, the development and therapeutic evaluation of FGFR4-specific inhibitors, such as BLU9931 and H3B-6527, in animal models and cancer patients, are paving the way to suppress hyperactive FGFR4 signaling in cancer. This comprehensive review not only covers the recent discoveries in understanding FGFR4 regulation and function in cancer, but also reveals the therapeutic implications and applications regarding emerging anti-FGFR4 agents. Our aim is to pinpoint the potential of FGFR4 as a therapeutic target and identify new avenues for advancing future research in the field.
Human brown adipose tissue (BAT) has attracted clinical interest not only because it dissipates energy but also for its potential capacity to counteract obesity and related metabolic disorders (e.g., insulin resistance and dyslipidemia). Cold exposure is the most powerful stimulus for activating and recruiting BAT, and this stimulatory effect is mediated by the transient receptor potential (TRP) channels. BAT can also be activated by other receptors such as the G-protein-coupled bile acid receptor 1 (GPBAR1) or β-adrenergic receptors. Interestingly, these receptors also interact with several dietary components; in particular, capsinoids and tea catechins appear to mimic the effects of cold through a TRP-BAT axis, and they consequently seem to decrease body fat and improve metabolic blood parameters. This systematic review critically addresses the evidence behind the available human studies analyzing the effect of several dietary components (e.g., capsinoids, tea catechins, and ephedrine) on BAT activity. Even though the results of these studies are consistent with the outcomes of preclinical models, the lack of robust study designs makes it impossible to confirm the BAT-activation capacity of the specified dietary components. Further investigation into the effects of dietary components on BAT is warranted to clarify to what extent these components could serve as a powerful strategy to treat obesity and related metabolic disorders.
Bariatric surgery, such as vertical sleeve gastrectomy (VSG), is the most effective long-term treatment for obesity. However, there are conflicting reports on the effect of bariatric surgery on inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Bariatric surgery increases bile acid concentrations, which can decrease inflammation by signaling through the bile acid receptor, TGR5. TGR5 signaling protects against chemically induced colitis in mice. VSG increases circulating bile acid concentrations to increase TGR5 signaling, which contributes to improved metabolic regulation after VSG. Therefore, we investigated the effect of VSG on chemically induced colitis development and the role of TGR5 in this context.
VSG or sham surgery was performed in high fat diet-fed male Tgr5+/+ and Tgr5-/- littermates. Sham-operated mice were food restricted to match their body weight to VSG-operated mice. Colitis was induced with 2.5% dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) in water post-operatively. Body weight, energy intake, fecal scoring, colon histopathology, colonic markers of inflammation, goblet cell counts, and colonic microRNA-21 levels were assessed.
VSG decreased body weight independently of genotype. Consistent with previous work, genetic ablation of TGR5 increased the severity of DSS-induced colitis. Notably, despite the effect of VSG to decrease body weight and increase TGR5 signaling, VSG increased the severity of DSS-induced colitis. VSG-induced increases in colitis were associated with increased colonic expression of TNF-α, IL-6, MCP-1, and microRNA-21.
While our data demonstrate that TGR5 protects against colitis, they also demonstrate that VSG potentiates chemically induced colitis in mice. These data suggest that individuals undergoing VSG may be at increased risk for developing colitis; however, further study is needed.
Liver fatty acid binding protein (L-Fabp) modulates lipid trafficking in enterocytes, hepatocytes, and hepatic stellate cells (HSCs). We examined hepatocyte vs. HSC L-Fabp deletion in hepatic metabolic adaptation and fibrotic injury. Floxed L-Fabp mice were bred to different transgenic Cre mice or injected with adeno-associated virus type 8 (AAV8) Cre and fed diets to promote steatosis and fibrosis or were subjected to either bile duct ligation or CCl4 injury. Albumin-Cre-mediated L-Fabp deletion revealed recombination in hepatocytes and HSCs; these findings were confirmed with 2 other floxed alleles. Glial fibrillary acid protein-Cre and platelet-derived growth factor receptor β-Cre-mediated L-Fabp deletion demonstrated recombination only in HSCs. Mice with albumin promoter-driven Cre recombinase (Alb-Cre)-mediated or AAV8-mediated L-Fabp deletion were protected against food withdrawal-induced steatosis. Mice with Alb-Cre-mediated L-Fabp deletion were protected against high saturated fat-induced steatosis and fibrosis, phenocopying germline L-Fabp-/- mice. Mice with HSC-specific L-Fabp deletion exhibited retinyl ester depletion yet demonstrated no alterations in fibrosis. On the other hand, fibrogenic resolution after CCl4 administration was impaired in mice with Alb-Cre-mediated L-Fabp deletion. These findings suggest cell type-specific roles for L-Fabp in mitigating hepatic steatosis and in modulating fibrogenic injury and reversal.-Newberry, E. P., Xie, Y., Lodeiro, C., Solis, R., Moritz, W., Kennedy, S., Barron, L., Onufer, E., Alpini, G., Zhou, T., Blaner, W. S., Chen, A., Davidson, N. O. Hepatocyte and stellate cell deletion of liver fatty acid binding protein reveal distinct roles in fibrogenic injury.
Exendin-4 is a glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist and potent insulinotropic agent for type 2 diabetes patients; however, its therapeutic utility is limited due to the frequent injections required. Long-acting agonists reduce the number of injections, but they can compromise potency. In this study, chondroitin sulfate-g-glycocholic acid-coated and Exendin-4 (Ex-4)-loaded liposomes (EL-CSG) were prepared for oral administration of Ex-4. The Ex-4 loading efficiency was 77% and the loading content in the nanoparticles was 1 wt-%. In rat models, a single oral dose (200 μg/kg) of EL-CSG showed a relative oral bioavailability of 19.5%, compared with subcutaneous administration (20 μg/kg), and sustained pharmacokinetics for up to 72 h. The overall long-term pharmacodynamic effects, assessed by hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), body weight, and blood lipid concentrations, of daily oral EL-CSG (300 μg/kg) for four weeks were equivalent to or better than daily subcutaneous injections of free Ex-4 solution (20 μg/kg).
Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) surgery is one of the most effective treatment options for severe obesity and related comorbidities, including hyperlipidemia, a well-established risk factor of cardiovascular diseases. Elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying the beneficial effects of RYGB may facilitate development of equally effective, but less invasive, treatments. Recent studies have revealed that RYGB increases low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) expression in the intestine of rodents. Therefore, in this study we first examined the effects of RYGB on intestinal cholesterol metabolism in human patients, and we show that they also exhibit profound changes and increased LDLR expression. We then hypothesized that the upregulation of intestinal LDLR may be sufficient to decrease circulating cholesterol levels. To this end, we generated and studied mice that overexpress human LDLR specifically in the intestine. This perturbation significantly affected intestinal metabolism, augmented fecal cholesterol excretion, and induced a reciprocal suppression of the machinery related to luminal cholesterol absorption and bile acid synthesis. Circulating cholesterol levels were significantly decreased and, remarkably, several other metabolic effects were similar to those observed in RYGB-treated rodents and patients, including improved glucose metabolism. These data highlight the importance of intestinal cholesterol metabolism for the beneficial metabolic effects of RYGB and for the treatment of hyperlipidemia.
Precision-cut liver tissue slice (PCLS) contains all major cell types of the liver parenchyma and preserves the original cell-cell and cell-matrix contacts. It represents a promising ex vivo model to study liver fibrosis and test the antifibrotic effect of experimental compounds in a physiological environment. In this study using RNA sequencing, we demonstrated that various pathways functionally related to fibrotic mechanisms were dysregulated in PCLSs derived from rats subjected to bile duct ligation. The activin receptor-like kinase-5 (Alk5) inhibitor SB525334, nintedanib, and sorafenib each reversed a subset of genes dysregulated in fibrotic PCLSs, and of those genes we identified 608 genes whose expression was reversed by all three compounds. These genes define a molecular signature characterizing many aspects of liver fibrosis pathology and its attenuation in the model. A panel of 12 genes and 4 secreted biomarkers including procollagen I, hyaluronic acid (HA), insulin-like growth factor binding protein 5 (IGFBP5), and WNT1-inducible signaling pathway protein 1 (WISP1) were further validated as efficacy end points for the evaluation of antifibrotic activity of experimental compounds. Finally, we showed that blockade of αV-integrins with a small molecule inhibitor attenuated the fibrotic phenotype in the model. Overall, our results suggest that the rat fibrotic PCLS model may represent a valuable system for target validation and determining the efficacy of experimental compounds. NEW &amp; NOTEWORTHY We investigated the antifibrotic activity of three compounds, the activin receptor-like kinase-5 (Alk5) inhibitor SB525334, nintedanib, and sorafenib, in a rat fibrotic precision-cut liver tissue slice model using RNA sequencing analysis. A panel of 12 genes and 4 secreted biomarkers including procollagen I, hyaluronic acid (HA), insulin-like growth factor binding protein 5 (IGFBP5), and WNT1-inducible signaling pathway protein 1 (WISP1) were then established as efficacy end points to validate the antifibrotic activity of the αV-integrin inhibitor CWHM12. This study demonstrated the value of the rat fibrotic PCLS model for the evaluation of antifibrotic drugs.
Endometriosis is a condition characterized by the presence of endometrial tissues outside the uterus. Endometriotic stromal cells (ESCs) are known to undergo regeneration and are linked to the causation of endometriosis. Activation of stromal cells by local inflammatory cytokines is proposed to be one of the mechanisms of endometriosis development. Takeda-G-protein-receptor-5 (TGR5) is a G protein-coupled bile acid receptor that plays multiple roles in various cells and tissues. In this study, we show that activation of TGR5 by its specific agonist, INT-777, protects ESCs from inflammation and oxidative stress induced by tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α). TGR5 is fairly expressed in cultured ESCs, and TNF-α treatment suppresses TGR5 expression. Activation of TGR5 by its synthetic agonist, INT-777, dramatically reduces the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and adhesion molecules by TNF-α, including interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-8 (IL-8), monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1). Moreover, INT-777 suppresses TNF-α-induced NADPH oxidase 4 (NOX4) expression and ameliorates cellular oxidative stress. Mechanistically, our findings demonstrate that INT-777 suppresses TNF-α-induced c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) activation via suppression of p-JNK. INT-777 inhibits TNF-α-induced activation of the activator protein-1 (AP-1) pathway owing to its suppression of c-Jun and c-fos as well as transfected AP-1 promoter. INT-777 also inhibits nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) activation as revealed by its suppression of TNF-α-induced nuclear p65 accumulation and NF-κB promoter. Collectively, our data indicate that activation of TGR5 by its agonist has protective effects against inflammation and reactive oxygen species (ROS) in cytokine-induced activation of ESCs. Therefore, INT-777 may have an implication in the clinical treatment of endometriosis.
Sunitinib is a small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor associated with hepatotoxicity. The mechanisms of its toxicity are still unclear.
In the present study, mice were treated with 60 mg kg-1, 150 mg kg-1, and 450 mg kg-1 sunitinib to evaluate sunitinib hepatotoxicity. Sunitinib metabolites and endogenous metabolites in liver, serum, feces, and urine were analyzed using ultra-performance liquid chromatography electrospray ionization quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry-based metabolomics.
Four reactive metabolites and impaired clearance of sunitinib in liver played a dominant role in sunitinib-induced hepatotoxicity. Using a non-targeted metabolomics approach, various metabolic pathways, including mitochondrial fatty acid β-oxidation (β-FAO), bile acids, lipids, amino acids, nucleotides, and tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates, were disrupted after sunitinib treatment.
These studies identified significant alterations in mitochondrial β-FAO and bile acid homeostasis. Activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARα) and inhibition of xenobiotic metabolism may be of value in attenuating sunitinib hepatotoxicity.
Hyperthermia induced by 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) can be life-threatening. Here, we investigate the role of the gut microbiome and TGR5 bile acid receptors in MDMA-mediated hyperthermia. Fourteen days prior to treatment with MDMA, male Sprague-Dawley rats were provided water or water treated with antibiotics. Animals that had received antibiotics displayed a reduction in gut bacteria and an attenuated hyperthermic response to MDMA. MDMA treated animals showed increased uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) and TGR5 expression levels in brown adipose tissue and skeletal muscle while increased expression of UCP3 was observed only in skeletal muscle. Antibiotics prior to MDMA administration significantly blunted these increases in gene expression. Furthermore, inhibition of the TGR5 receptor with triamterene or of deiodinase II downstream of the TGR5 receptor with iopanoic acid also resulted in the attenuation of MDMA-induced hyperthermia. MDMA-treatment enriched the relative proportion of a Proteus mirabilis strain in the ceca of animals not pre-treated with antibiotics. These findings suggest a contributing role for the gut microbiota in MDMA-mediated hyperthermia and that MDMA treatment can trigger a rapid remodeling of the composition of the gut microbiome.
Acute biliary pancreatitis (ABP) is a potentially life-threatening disease that is induced by the common bile duct (CBD) sludge or stones. This study aimed to investigate protective effects of Qingyi Decoction (QYT) on deoxycholic-acid-sodium salt (DCA) induced ABP in rats. Gpbar1 is a G-protein coupled receptor that can be activated by DCA. Both Gpbar1 overexpression vector and Gpbar1 RNAi were constructed and transfected into ABP cell models. Functional assays reveal that DCA significantly induced AR42J apoptosis and triggered Gpbar1 expression. Gpbar1 significantly activated caspase 8 and caspase 9 as compared to LV5-NC and LV3-NC (p&lt;0.05). Gpbar1 significantly triggered apoptosis associated inflammatory factors as compared to LV5-NC and LV3-NC (p&lt;0.05). Gpbar1 significantly induced calcium flux as compared to LV5-NC and LV3-NC (p&lt;0.05). Gpbar1 up-regulated caspases and inflammatory factors in DCA treated pancreatic acinar cells. QYT reversed DCA induced apoptosis and inflammatory response. QYT significantly reduced Gpbar1 levels compared to no-QTY treated cells (p&lt;0.05). In conclusion, QYT protects against DCA induced pancreatic acinar cell damage in ABP by inhibiting Gpbar1/NF-kB/p-RIP signaling pathway.
The fish olfactory receptor ORA family is orthologous to the mammalian vomeronasal receptors type 1. It consists of six highly conserved chemosensory receptors expected to be essential for survival and communication. We deorphanized the zebrafish ORA family in a heterologous cell system. The six receptors responded specifically to lithocholic acid (LCA) and closely related C24 5β-bile acids/salts. LCA attracted zebrafish as strongly as food in behavioral tests, whereas the less potent cholanic acid elicited weaker attraction, consistent with the in vitro results. The ORA-ligand recognition patterns were probed with site-directed mutagenesis guided by in silico modeling. We revealed the receptors' structure-function relationship underlying their specificity and selectivity for these compounds. Bile acids/salts are putative fish semiochemicals or pheromones sensed by the olfactory system with high specificity. This work identified their receptors and provided the basis for probing the roles of ORAs and bile acids/salts in fish chemosensation.
Farnesoid X receptor is a tumor suppressor linking intestinal self-renewal and bile acid homeostasis.
Cholestasis is a pathological process in which bile drainage is poor for a variety of reasons. Many studies have shown that cholestatic liver injury is a neutrophil-mediated inflammatory response, and oxidative stress induced by neutrophils is the main mechanism of liver cell death. The literature summarizes the bile acid signaling pathway, the neutrophil chemotaxis recruitment process during cholestasis, and the oxidative stress damage produced by neutrophil activation, summarizes the latest research progress. Sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor (S1PR) is a potential therapeutic target for cholestasis that reduces neutrophil aggregation without inhibiting systemic immune status. Early growth response factor 1 (Egr-1) may play a central role in the inflammation induced by cholestasis, and it is also a potential therapeutic target to inhibit the inflammation induced by cholestasis. Strengthening the antioxidant system of hepatocytes to cope with oxidative stress of neutrophils is a feasible treatment for cholestatic liver injury.
To investigate the role of G-protein-coupled bile acid receptor-1, Gpbar1 (TGR5) in the pathogenesis of Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH) disease.
The mRNA level of TGR5, iNOS, Arg1, CD16, and CD206 in macrophages was assayed by real-time PCR. ELISA was used to detect the production of cytokines in cell culture supernatants. The frequencies of CD4+IFN-γ+ and CD4+ IL-17+ T cells were tested by flow cytometry.
A decreased expression of TGR5 in M1 macrophages was observed in active VKH patients as compared with normal controls. TGR5 stimulation of M1 macrophages with INT-777 caused a shift of the inflammatory M1 toward the anti-inflammatory M2 macrophage subtype. TGR5 activation of macrophages co-cultured with CD4+ T cells inhibited Th1 and Th17 polarization, as well as the release of IFN-γ and IL-17 in the culture supernatant.
Our results show that a decreased TGR5 expression might contribute to the pathogenesis of VKH disease.
Bile acids are involved in the emulsification and absorption of dietary fats, as well as acting as signaling molecules. Recently, bile acid signaling through farnesoid X receptor and G protein-coupled bile acid receptor (TGR5) has been reported to elicit changes in not only bile acid synthesis but also metabolic processes, including the alteration of gluconeogenic gene expression and energy expenditure. A role for bile acids in glucose metabolism is also supported by a correlation between changes in the metabolic state of patients (i.e., obesity or postbariatric surgery) and altered serum bile acid levels. However, despite evidence for a role for bile acids during metabolically challenging settings, the direct effect of elevated bile acids on insulin action in the absence of metabolic disease has yet to be investigated. The present study examines the impact of acutely elevated plasma bile acid levels on insulin sensitivity using hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamps. In wild-type mice, elevated bile acids impair hepatic insulin sensitivity by blunting the insulin suppression of hepatic glucose production. The impaired hepatic insulin sensitivity could not be attributed to TGR5 signaling, as TGR5 knockout mice exhibited a similar inhibition of insulin suppression of hepatic glucose production. Canonical insulin signaling pathways, such as hepatic PKB (or Akt) activation, were not perturbed in these animals. Interestingly, bile acid infusion directly into the portal vein did not result in an impairment in hepatic insulin sensitivity. Overall, the data indicate that acute increases in circulating bile acids in lean mice impair hepatic insulin sensitivity via an indirect mechanism.
We recently demonstrated that bile acids, especially tauro-deoxycholic acid (t-DCA), modify the function of the acid-sensing ion channel ASIC1a and other members of the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC)/degenerin (DEG) ion channel family. Surprisingly, ASIC1 shares a high degree of structural similarity with the purinergic receptor P2X4, a nonselective cation channel transiently activated by ATP. P2X4 is abundantly expressed in the apical membrane of bile duct epithelial cells and is therefore exposed to bile acids under physiological conditions. Here, we hypothesize that P2X4 may also be modulated by bile acids and investigate whether t-DCA and other common bile acids affect human P2X4 heterologously expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes. We find that application of either t-DCA or unconjugated deoxycholic acid (DCA; 250 µM) causes a strong reduction (∼70%) of ATP-activated P2X4-mediated whole-cell currents. The inhibitory effect of 250 µM tauro-chenodeoxycholic acid is less pronounced (∼30%), and 250 µM chenodeoxycholic acid, cholic acid, or tauro-cholic acid did not significantly alter P2X4-mediated currents. t-DCA inhibits P2X4 in a concentration-dependent manner by reducing the efficacy of ATP without significantly changing its affinity. Single-channel patch-clamp recordings provide evidence that t-DCA inhibits P2X4 by stabilizing the channel's closed state. Using site-directed mutagenesis, we identifiy several amino acid residues within the transmembrane domains of P2X4 that are critically involved in mediating the inhibitory effect of t-DCA on P2X4. Importantly, a W46A mutation converts the inhibitory effect of t-DCA into a stimulatory effect. We conclude that t-DCA directly interacts with P2X4 and decreases ATP-activated P2X4 currents by stabilizing the closed conformation of the channel.
Low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 6 (LRP6) is an important coreceptor in the Wnt/β-catenin upstream signaling pathway. Rs2302685 is a common functional mutation of LRP6 that has been previously associated with reduced alcoholic liver injury among alcoholic liver disease (ALD) patients, and the present research was designed to study the underlying mechanisms of that finding. A total of 107 ALD patients and 138 non-ALD patients were recruited from hospitalized alcoholics in China. Their venous blood samples were collected for DNA extraction and genotyped using Sequenom MassARRAY. We found that the rs2302685 mutation, which impaired the function of LRP6, was present in higher frequency among alcoholics with ALD than those without ALD. We also conducted a mouse model experiment in which LRP6(+/-) knockdown mice and LRP6(+/+) wild-type mice received daily intragastric doses of ethanol (2.4 g/kg) as well as a larger dose of ethanol (4 g/kg) every 7 days for 28 days. The mouse blood and liver specimens were subsequently collected for laboratory analysis, and cell experiments were performed to compare the inhibition, activation, over-expression, and siRNA of LRP6 in the treatment versus the control HL7702 cells. Expression of the targeted molecules was detected by real-time PCR or western blot analysis. Stably transfected cells with pRL3-CYP2E1 vector were used to further study the underlying mechanisms. The total bile acid (TBA), direct bilirubin, total bilirubin (TBIL), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), mitochondrial aspartate aminotransferase, and AST/ALT values were significantly lower in carriers of the rs2302685 mutation than in the wild-type patients, by 63.4, 60.6, 82.1, 44.8, 45.7, and 21.4%, respectively. Compared to the LRP6(+/+) wild-type mice, the LRP6(+/-) knockdown mice had lower ALT, TBIL, TBA, and ALB/GLO values, as well reduced liver tissue damage, in accordance with their reduced expressions of LRP6, β-catenin, and CYP2E1. In HL7702 cells exposed to ethanol, AST, ALT, lipid accumulation, and ROS generation decreased in cells that were treated with LRP6 inhibitors or siRNA but increased in cells treated with LRP6 activators or over-expressed LRP6. TCF1 was the transcriptional factor most likely to connect the LRP6-Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway to the regulation of CYP2E1. We concluded that the LRP6 functional mutation rs2302685 contributes to individual differences in susceptibility to alcoholic liver injury related to the Wnt/β-catenin-TCF1-CYP2E1 signaling pathway.
Patients with ulcerative colitis [UC] with long disease duration have a higher risk of developing colitis-associated cancer [CAC] compared with patients with short-duration UC. The aim of this study was to identify transcriptomic differences associated with the duration of UC disease.
We conducted transcriptome profiling on 32 colonic biopsies [11 long-duration UC, ≥20 years; and 21 short-duration UC, ≤5 years] using Affymetrix Human Transcriptome Array 2.0. Differentially expressed genes [fold change &gt; 1.5, p &lt; 0.05] and alternative splicing events [splicing index &gt; 1.5, p &lt; 0.05] were determined using the Transcriptome Analysis Console. KOBAS 3.0 and DAVID 6.8 were used for KEGG and GO analysis. Selected genes from microarray analysis were validated using qPCR.
There were 640 differentially expressed genes between both groups. The top ten upregulated genes were HMGCS2, UGT2A3 isoforms, B4GALNT2, MEP1B, GUCA2B, ADH1C, OTOP2, SLC9A3, and LYPD8; the top ten downregulated genes were PI3, DUOX2, VNN1, SLC6A14, GREM1, MMP1, CXCL1, TNIP3, TFF1, and LCN2. Among the 123 altered KEGG pathways, the most significant were metabolic pathways; fatty acid degradation; valine, leucine, and isoleucine degradation; the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor signalling pathway; and bile secretion, which were previously linked with CAC. Analysis showed that 3560 genes exhibited differential alternative splicing between long- and short-duration UC. Among them, 374 were differentially expressed, underscoring the intrinsic relationship between altered gene expression and alternative splicing.
Long-duration UC patients have altered gene expressions, pathways, and alternative splicing events as compared with short-duration UC patients, and these could be further validated to improve our understanding of the pathogenesis of CAC.
Clostridium difficile spore germination is critical for the transmission of disease. C. difficile spores germinate in response to cholic acid derivatives, such as taurocholate (TA), and amino acids, such as glycine or alanine. Although the receptor with which bile acids are recognized (germinant receptor) is known, the amino acid co-germinant receptor has remained elusive. Here, we used EMS mutagenesis to generate mutants with altered requirements for the amino acid co-germinant, similar to the strategy we used previously to identify the bile acid germinant receptor, CspC. Surprisingly, we identified strains that do not require co-germinants, and the mutant spores germinated in response to TA alone. Upon sequencing these mutants, we identified different mutations in yabG. In C. difficile, yabG expression is required for the processing of key germination components to their mature forms (e.g., CspBA to CspB and CspA). A defined yabG mutant exacerbated the EMS mutant phenotype. Building upon this work, we found that small deletions in cspA resulted in spores that germinated in the presence of TA alone without the requirement of a co-germinant. cspA encodes a pseudoprotease that was previously shown to be important for incorporation of the CspC germinant receptor. Herein, our study builds upon the role of CspA during C. difficile spore germination by providing evidence that CspA is important for recognition of co-germinants during C. difficile spore germination. Our work suggests that two pseudoproteases (CspC and CspA) likely function as the C. difficile germinant receptors.
Lithocholic acid (LCA) is a bile acid associated with adverse effects, including cholestasis, and exists in vivo mainly as conjugates known as glyco-LCA (GLCA) and tauro-LCA (TLCA). Tamoxifen has been linked to the development of cholestasis and it inhibits sulfotransferase 2A1 (SULT2A1)-catalyzed dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) sulfonation. The present study characterized the sulfonation of LCA, GLCA, and TLCA and investigated whether triphenylethylene (clomifene, tamoxifen, toremifene, ospemifene, droloxifene), benzothiophene (raloxifene, arzoxifene), tetrahydronaphthalene (lasofoxifene, nafoxidine), indole (bazedoxifene), and benzopyran (acolbifene) classes of SERM inhibit LCA, GLCA, and TLCA sulfonation. Human recombinant SULT2A1, but not SULT2B1b or SULT1E1, catalyzed LCA, GLCA, and TLCA sulfonation, whereas each of these enzymes catalyzed DHEA sulfonation. LCA, GLCA, and TLCA sulfonation catalyzed by human liver cytosol and SULT2A1 followed the substrate inhibition model with comparable apparent Km values (≤ 1 µM). Each of the SERMs inhibited LCA, GLCA, and TLCA sulfonation with varying potency and mode of enzyme inhibition. The potency and extent of inhibition of LCA sulfonation were attenuated or increased by structural modifications to toremifene, bazedoxifene, and lasofoxifene. The inhibitory effect of raloxifene, bazedoxifene, and acolbifene on LCA sulfonation was also observed in HepG2 cells. Overall, among the SERMs investigated, bazedoxifene and raloxifene were the most effective inhibitors of LCA, GLCA, and TLCA sulfonation. The findings provide an insight into the structural features of specific SERMs that contribute to their inhibition of SULT2A1-catalyzed LCA sulfonation. Inhibition of LCA, GLCA, and TLCA detoxification by a SERM may provide a biochemical basis for adverse effects associated with a SERM.
Recent developments in techniques of metabologenomics have given a better understanding the association of gut microbiota with various diseases. Gut microbiota has a strong impact on host immunostasis and homeostasis of gut function for maintaining the health condition. Dysbiosis leads to an increase in bacterial populations that stimulate tumorigenesis, and contributes to epithelial carcinogenesis and tumor progression by altering metabolic properties(such as bile acid and butyric acid)and inflammatory process. Inflammation aid the bacterial translocation into the neoplastic tissue, which in turn promotes production of inflammatory cytokines subsequently leading to tumor growth. The colonic microbiota such as enterotoxigenic Bacteroides fragilis(ETBF)may also promote colorectal cancer by stimulating exaggerated immune responses via Th17 cells. Dysbiosis caused by a deficiency of the NLRP6 inflammasome promotes cancer development via interleukin-6(IL- 6)-induced epithelial proliferation. Emerging data suggest that certain groups of bacteria might promote whereas others might protect against colon cancer. Indeed, Fusobacteriumnucleatum (F. nucleatum)seems to play a central role in the tumor microenvironment as its abundance correlates with cancer progression as well as the dysbiotic tumor microbiota composition including Bacteroides and Prevotella species. Moreover, gut microbiota not only plays a key role in carcinogenesis but also influences the efficacy and toxicity of cancer immunotherapy, especially immune checkpoint inhibitors by targeting the programmed death receptor 1(PD-1)and the cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen 4(CTLA-4).
A cDNA library established from the human mammary carcinoma cell line MCF7 was used to screen for transcripts related to or representing the gene coding for the estrogen receptor-related protein ERD5. Among the two populations of cDNAs isolated, one group (3 clones) represented heat shock protein transcripts (HSP27), the other (2 clones) appeared identical in their insert size and restriction enzyme banding pattern. Detailed analysis of one of them revealed its nature as a fusion sequence composed of two genes. At the 5'-end it consists of the last 157 bp of the HSP28 gene. At its 3'-part, it is identical to the 3'-portion of thr nuclear factor IV gene. The genuine expression of this fusion gene was demonstrated by Northern blots and RT-PCR. It appears to be ubiquitously expressed in a variety of normal tissues and malignant cells in man, mouse and rat.
Heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) is an abundantly and ubiquitously expressed chaperone with majority of client proteins which act as signal molecules. Transforming growth factor beta-activated kinase 1 (TAK1) is a mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase (MAPKKK), and is essential in interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) triggered signaling pathways. In the present study, we found that Hsp90 plays an important role in regulating IL-1beta signaling by keeping TAK1 stability. The results showed that the specific inhibitor geldanamycin (GA) of Hsp90 dramatically inhibited IL-1beta stimulated TAK1-MAPKs and TAK1-nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) activation, resulting in the decrease of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) protein expression. Silencing Hsp90 expression through RNA interference (RNAi) also down-regulated TAK1, as well as attenuated IL-1beta induced phosphorylation of c-Jun NH(2)-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38 MAPKs, and degradation of IkappaBalpha. The same results were obtained in T6RZC stable cells which initiated IL-1beta-induced cell signaling at the level of the oligomerization and ubquitination of TNF receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6). We further found that Hsp90 formed a complex with TAK1 via its N-terminal domain and GA destabilized TAK1 and induced TAK1 degradation through proteasome pathway. Taken together our results demonstrate that Hsp90 regulates IL-1beta-induced signaling by interacting with TAK1 and maintaining the stability of TAK1, suggesting that Hsp90 might act as the chaperone of TAK1 in immune and inflammatory responses related with IL-1 signal cascades.
The breakdown of the intestinal barrier is a common manifestation of many diseases. Recent evidence suggests that vitamin D and its receptor VDR may regulate intestinal barrier function. Claudin-2 is a tight junction protein that mediates paracellular water transport in intestinal epithelia, rendering them "leaky". Using whole body VDR(-/-) mice, intestinal epithelial VDR conditional knockout (VDR(ΔIEC)) mice, and cultured human intestinal epithelial cells, we demonstrate here that the CLDN2 gene is a direct target of the transcription factor VDR. The Caudal-Related Homeobox (Cdx) protein family is a group of the transcription factor proteins which bind to DNA to regulate the expression of genes. Our data showed that VDR-enhances Claudin-2 promoter activity in a Cdx1 binding site-dependent manner. We further identify a functional vitamin D response element (VDRE) 5΄-AGATAACAAAGGTCA-3΄ in the Cdx1 site of the Claudin-2 promoter. It is a VDRE required for the regulation of Claudin-2 by vitamin D. Absence of VDR decreased Claudin-2 expression by abolishing VDR/promoter binding. In vivo, VDR deletion in intestinal epithelial cells led to significant decreased Claudin-2 in VDR(-/-) and VDR(ΔIEC) mice. The current study reveals an important and novel mechanism for VDR by regulation of epithelial barriers. 
Small intestinal neuroendocrine tumors (SINET) are the commonest malignancy of the small intestine; however, underlying pathogenic mechanisms remain poorly characterized. Whole-genome and -exome sequencing has demonstrated that SINETs are mutationally quiet, with the most frequent known mutation in the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1B gene (CDKN1B) occurring in only ∼8% of tumors, suggesting that alternative mechanisms may drive tumorigenesis. The aim of this study is to perform genome-wide molecular profiling of SINETs in order to identify pathogenic drivers based on molecular profiling. This study represents the largest unbiased integrated genomic, epigenomic, and transcriptomic analysis undertaken in this tumor type.
Here, we present data from integrated molecular analysis of SINETs (n = 97), including whole-exome or targeted CDKN1B sequencing (n = 29), HumanMethylation450 BeadChip (Illumina) array profiling (n = 69), methylated DNA immunoprecipitation sequencing (n = 16), copy-number variance analysis (n = 47), and Whole-Genome DASL (Illumina) expression array profiling (n = 43).
Based on molecular profiling, SINETs can be classified into three groups, which demonstrate significantly different progression-free survival after resection of primary tumor (not reached at 10 years vs. 56 months vs. 21 months, P = 0.04). Epimutations were found at a recurrence rate of up to 85%, and 21 epigenetically dysregulated genes were identified, including CDX1 (86%), CELSR3 (84%), FBP1 (84%), and GIPR (74%).
This is the first comprehensive integrated molecular analysis of SINETs. We have demonstrated that these tumors are highly epigenetically dysregulated. Furthermore, we have identified novel molecular subtypes with significant impact on progression-free survival.
Regulation of RNA polymerase II transcription is critical for the proper development, differentiation, and growth of an organism. The RNA polymerase II core promoter is the ultimate target of a multitude of transcription factors that control transcription initiation. Core promoters encompass the RNA start site and consist of functional elements such as the TATA box, initiator, and downstream core promoter element (DPE), which confer specific properties to the core promoter. We have previously discovered that Drosophila Caudal, which is a master regulator of genes involved in development and differentiation, is a DPE-specific transcriptional activator. Here, we show that the mouse Caudal-related homeobox (Cdx) proteins (mCdx1, mCdx2, and mCdx4) are also preferential core promoter transcriptional activators. To elucidate the mechanism that enables Caudal to preferentially activate DPE transcription, we performed structure-function analysis. Using a systematic series of deletion mutants (all containing the intact DNA-binding homeodomain) we discovered that the C-terminal region of Caudal contributes to the preferential activation of the fushi tarazu (ftz) Caudal target gene. Furthermore, the region containing both the homeodomain and the C terminus of Caudal was sufficient to confer core promoter-preferential activation to the heterologous GAL4 DNA-binding domain. Importantly, we discovered that Drosophila CREB-binding protein (dCBP) is a co-activator for Caudal-regulated activation of ftz. Strikingly, dCBP conferred the ability to preferentially activate the DPE-dependent ftz reporter to mini-Caudal proteins that were unable to preferentially activate ftz transcription themselves. Taken together, it is the unique combination of dCBP and Caudal that enables the co-activation of ftz in a core promoter-preferential manner. 
The forced reduction of global DNA methylation suppresses tumor development in several cancer models in vivo. Nevertheless, the mechanisms underlying these suppressive effects remain unclear. In this report, we describe our findings showing that a genome-wide reduction in the DNA methylation levels induces cellular differentiation in association with decreased cell proliferation in Apc (Min/+) mouse colon tumor cells in vivo. Colon tumor-specific DNA methylation at Cdx1 is reduced in the DNA-hypomethylated tumors accompanied by Cdx1 derepression and an increased expression of intestinal differentiation-related genes. Furthermore, a histological analysis revealed that Cdx1 derepression in the DNA-hypomethylated tumors is correlated with the differentiation of colon tumor cells. Similarly, the treatment of human colon cancer cell lines with a hypomethylating agent induces differentiation-related genes, including CDX1. We herein propose that DNA demethylation exerts a tumor suppressive effect in the colon by inducing tumor cell differentiation.
Mesenchymal chondrosarcoma is a rare tumor of cartilaginous origin characterized by its bimorphic pattern composed of highly undifferentiated small round cells separated by islands of well-differentiated hyaline cartilage. It exhibits higher malignancy and earlier occurrence in comparison to classic chondrosarcomas. Recently identified HEY1-NCOA2 and IRF2BP2-CDX1 gene fusions confirm their distinct molecular origin and pose a promising diagnostic marker. The majority of cases arise from craniofacial bones. In this study, we present a rare case of mesenchymal chondrosarcoma encompassed within the brain parenchyma of the frontal lobe without any dural or bone attachment. We demonstrate histopathological findings and confirm the HEY1-NCOA2 gene fusion in a formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded archival sample using simple reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) method. IRF2BP2-CDX1 gene fusion was absent in the analyzed sample. The clinical follow-up is also presented with a review of treatment modalities for this entity. 
The transcription factor caudal-type homeobox 1 (CDX1) is a key regulator of differentiation in the normal colon and in colorectal cancer (CRC). CDX1 activates the expression of enterocyte genes, but it is not clear how the concomitant silencing of stem cell genes is achieved. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are important mediators of gene repression and have been implicated in tumor suppression and carcinogenesis, but the roles of miRNAs in differentiation, particularly in CRC, remain poorly understood. Here, we identified microRNA-215 (miR-215) as a direct transcriptional target of CDX1 by using high-throughput small RNA sequencing to profile miRNA expression in two pairs of CRC cell lines: CDX1-low HCT116 and HCT116 with stable CDX1 overexpression, and CDX1-high LS174T and LS174T with stable CDX1 knockdown. Validation of candidate miRNAs identified by RNA-seq in a larger cell-line panel revealed miR-215 to be most significantly correlated with CDX1 expression. Quantitative ChIP-PCR and promoter luciferase assays confirmed that CDX1 directly activates miR-215 transcription. miR-215 expression is depleted in FACS-enriched cancer stem cells compared with unsorted samples. Overexpression of miR-215 in poorly differentiated cell lines causes a decrease in clonogenicity, whereas miR-215 knockdown increases clonogenicity and impairs differentiation in CDX1-high cell lines. We identified the genome-wide targets of miR-215 and found that miR-215 mediates the repression of cell cycle and stemness genes downstream of CDX1. In particular, the miR-215 target gene BMI1 has been shown to promote stemness and self-renewal and to vary inversely with CDX1. Our work situates miR-215 as a link between CDX1 expression and BMI1 repression that governs differentiation in CRC. 
The vacuolated lens (vl) mouse mutation arose on the C3H/HeSnJ background and results in lethality, neural tube defects (NTDs) and cataracts. The vl phenotypes are due to a deletion/frameshift mutation in the orphan GPCR, Gpr161. A recent study using a null allele demonstrated that Gpr161 functions in primary cilia and represses the Shh pathway. We show the hypomorphic Gpr161(vl) allele does not severely affect the Shh pathway. To identify additional pathways regulated by Gpr161 during neurulation, we took advantage of naturally occurring genetic variation in the mouse. Previously Gpr161(vl-C3H) was crossed to different inbred backgrounds including MOLF/EiJ and the Gpr161(vl) mutant phenotypes were rescued. Five modifiers were mapped (Modvl: Modifier of vl) including Modvl5(MOLF). In this study we demonstrate the Modvl5(MOLF) congenic rescues the Gpr161(vl)-associated lethality and NTDs but not cataracts. Bioinformatics determined the transcription factor, Cdx1, is the only annotated gene within the Modvl5 95% CI co-expressed with Gpr161 during neurulation and not expressed in the eye. Using Cdx1 as an entry point, we identified the retinoid acid (RA) and canonical Wnt pathways as downstream targets of Gpr161. QRT-PCR, ISH and IHC determined that expression of RA and Wnt genes are down-regulated in Gpr161(vl/vl) but rescued by the Modvl5(MOLF) congenic during neurulation. Intraperitoneal RA injection restores expression of canonical Wnt markers and rescues Gpr161(vl/vl) NTDs. These results establish the RA and canonical Wnt as pathways downstream of Gpr161 during neurulation, and suggest that Modvl5(MOLF) bypasses the Gpr161(vl) mutation by restoring the activity of these pathways. 
Barrett's oesophagus (BO) is a complicated condition at the gastroesophageal junction in which normal squamous epithelium is changed to columnar and leads to oesophageal adenocarcinoma (OA). In the past decades, the prevalence of Barrett's disease and mortality rate of adenocarcinoma has significantly increased throughout the word. Data has shown that molecular pathogenesis of disease has not been clearly identified. However, a wide-range and successful administration of probiotics in cancer and gastrointestinal diseases has lead to the investigation into the possible inhibitory role of probiotics in oesophageal cancer. This study was conducted to evaluate the inhibitory effect of probiotics on the expression of biomarkers in an in vitro model. Two different Barrett's oesophageal cell lines were selected to co-culture with B. longum and Lactobacillus acidophilus to measure expression of IL-18, TNFα, p53 (tumour suppressor gene), cyclooxygenase 2 and CDX1 (caudal type homeobox 1) genes. In addition, two different aspects of probiotic administration, therapeutic and prophylactic test were also examined. Results showed that micro-organisms could inhibit expression of biomarkers and therapeutic culture conditions were more effective than prophylactic tests. The results obtained suggest that it is possible to incorporate the administration of probiotics in BO and OA prevention. 
Gastric cancer may appear by frequent genetic or epigenetic changes in oncogenes, tumor suppressor or DNA mismatch repair genes. Molecular studies show the possibility of involvement of certain cancer pathways in gastric cancer. In this respect, DNA methylation is one of the most important epigenetic alterations in gastric cancer and identifying the signaling mechanism and also methylation of some genes that are involved in gastric cancer can help to improve treatment strategies. Relatively, there are many reported methylation alteration of genes in stem cells in all kinds of tumors with some of these genes having a key role in tumor development. Correspondingly, KLF5, CDX1/2, WNT1 and FEM1A are considerable genes in gastric cancer, although many researches and studies have illustrated that sonic hedgehog and expression of its signaling cascade proteins are related in gastric cancer. Relatively, modification in these genes causes many eclectic cancers such as rhabdomyosarcoma and diverse kinds of digestive system tumor development. Conspicuously, these master genes have a noticeable role in stem cell's growth regulation as well as other kinds of cancer such as breast cancer and leukemia. Hence, we concluded that research and studies on methylation and expression of these genes and also the investigation of molecular signaling in gastric cancer can acquire impressive conclusions in order to control and treat this common place and serious problem. 
Barrett's esophagus (BE) is defined as an incomplete intestinal metaplasia characterized generally by the presence of columnar and goblet cells in the formerly stratified squamous epithelium of the esophagus. BE is known as a precursor for esophageal adenocarcinoma. Currently, the cell of origin for human BE has yet to be clearly identified. Therefore, we investigated the role of Notch signaling in the initiation of BE metaplasia. Affymetrix gene expression microarray revealed that BE samples express decreased levels of Notch receptors (NOTCH2 and NOTCH3) and one of the the ligands (JAG1). Furthermore, BE tissue microarray showed decreased expression of NOTCH1 and its downstream target HES1. Therefore, Notch signaling was inhibited in human esophageal epithelial cells by expression of dominant-negative-Mastermind-like (dnMAML), in concert with MYC and CDX1 overexpression. Cell transdifferentiation was then assessed by 3D organotypic culture and evaluation of BE-lineage specific gene expression. Notch inhibition promoted transdifferentiation of esophageal epithelial cells toward columnar-like cells as demonstrated by increased expression of columnar keratins (K8, K18, K19, K20) and glandular mucins (MUC2, MUC3B, MUC5B, MUC17) and decreased expression of squamous keratins (K5, K13, K14). In 3D culture, elongated cells were observed in the basal layer of the epithelium with Notch inhibition. Furthermore, we observed increased expression of KLF4, a potential driver of the changes observed by Notch inhibition. Interestingly, knockdown of KLF4 reversed the effects of Notch inhibition on BE-like metaplasia. Overall, Notch signaling inhibition promotes transdifferentiation of esophageal cells toward BE-like metaplasia in part via upregulation of KLF4. These results support a novel mechanism through which esophageal epithelial transdifferentiation promotes the evolution of BE. 
Cancers exhibit abnormal molecular signatures associated with disease initiation and progression. Molecular signatures could improve cancer screening, detection, drug development and selection of appropriate drug therapies for individual patients. Typically only very small amounts of tissue are available from patients for analysis and biopsy samples exhibit broad heterogeneity that cannot be captured using a single marker. This report details application of an in-house custom designed GenomeLab System multiplex gene expression assay, the hCellMarkerPlex, to assess predictive gene signatures of normal, adenomatous polyp and carcinoma colon tissue using archived tissue bank material. The hCellMarkerPlex incorporates twenty-one gene markers: epithelial (EZR, KRT18, NOX1, SLC9A2), proliferation (PCNA, CCND1, MS4A12), differentiation (B4GANLT2, CDX1, CDX2), apoptotic (CASP3, NOX1, NTN1), fibroblast (FSP1, COL1A1), structural (ACTG2, CNN1, DES), gene transcription (HDAC1), stem cell (LGR5), endothelial (VWF) and mucin production (MUC2). Gene signatures distinguished normal, adenomatous polyp and carcinoma. Individual gene targets significantly contributing to molecular tissue types, classifier genes, were further characterised using real-time PCR, in-situ hybridisation and immunohistochemistry revealing aberrant epithelial expression of MS4A12, LGR5 CDX2, NOX1 and SLC9A2 prior to development of carcinoma. Identified gene signatures identify aberrant epithelial expression of genes prior to cancer development using in-house custom designed gene expression multiplex assays. This approach may be used to assist in objective classification of disease initiation, staging, progression and therapeutic responses using biopsy material. 
Cdx1 encodes a homeodomain protein that regulates expression of some Hox genes. Cdx1 itself is known to be regulated in the primitive streak/tailbud by both retinoic acid (RA) and Wnt3a. Cdx1 in eutherian mammals has two retinoic acid response elements (RAREs), located upstream and in the first intron, and each is adjacent to structural Lef/Tcf motifs. Upstream Lef/Tcf motifs respond to canonical Wnt signalling to activate Cdx1 synergistically with RA. By combined use of reporter assays, immunofluorescence and flow cytometry in mouse P19 embryonal carcinoma cells we show that the Cdx1 intron Lef/Tcf motif also responds to Wnt3a signalling. Synergy between individual Cdx1 RARE and Lef/Tcf motifs can occur whether they are adjacent or distant in the gene. Part, though not all, of the Cdx1 stimulation by RA (in absence of added Wnt3a) likely depends upon Wnt protein produced by the cells themselves, since it is inhibited by mutation of Lef/Tcf motifs, or by IWP-2, an inhibitor of Wnt production. RA and Wnt3a stimulate Cdx1 by increasing both the proportion of P19 cells that are expressing and also their mean level of expression. The expressing/non-expressing sub-populations do not simply correspond with those that express a marker of pluripotentiality, Nanog. We conclude that RA and Wnt3a activate Cdx1 synergistically by overlapping use of both upstream and intron enhancers, and that mouse embryonal carcinoma cell populations display heterogeneity in their response to these activators. 
In humans, colorectal cancer is often initiated through APC loss of function, which leads to crypt hyperplasia and polyposis driven by unrestricted canonical Wnt signaling. Such polyps typically arise in the colorectal region and are at risk of transforming to invasive adenocarcinomas. Although colorectal cancer is the third most common cause of cancer-related death worldwide, the processes impacting initiation, transformation, and invasion are incompletely understood. Murine APC(Min/+) mutants are often used to model colorectal cancers; however, they develop nonmetastatic tumors confined largely to the small intestine and are thus not entirely representative of the human disease. APC(Min/+) alleles can collaborate with mutations impacting other pathways to recapitulate some aspects of human colorectal cancer. To this end, we assessed APC(Min/+)-induced polyposis following somatic loss of the homeodomain transcription factor Cdx2, alone or with a Cdx1 null allele, in the adult gastrointestinal tract. APC(Min/+)-Cdx2 mutants recapitulated several aspects of human colorectal cancer, including an invasive phenotype. Notably, the concomitant loss of Cdx1 led to a significant increase in the incidence of tumors in the distal colon, relative to APC(Min/+)-Cdx2 offspring, demonstrating a previously unrecognized role for this transcription factor in colorectal tumorigenesis. These findings underscore previously unrecognized roles for Cdx members in intestinal tumorigenesis. 
Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a phenomenon that allows the conversion of adherent epithelial cells to a mesenchymal cell phenotype, which enhances migratory capacity and invasiveness. Recent studies have suggested that EMT contributes to the pathogenesis of ulcerative colitis (UC). We investigated the promoter DNA methylation status of EMT-related genes in the colonic mucosa in UC.
Colonic biopsies were obtained from the rectal inflammatory mucosa of 86 UC patients and the non-inflammatory proximal colonic mucosa of 10 paired patients. Bisulfite pyrosequencing was used to quantify the methylation of 5 candidate CpG island promoters (NEUROG1, CDX1, miR-1247, CDH1, and CDH13) and LINE1.
Using an unsupervised hierarchical clustering analysis, inflamed rectal mucosa was well separated from mucosa that appeared normal. The CDH1 and CDH13 promoters were significantly associated with patient age (p = 0.04, 0.03, respectively). A similar trend was found between those genes and the duration of disease (CDH1: p = 0.07, CDH13: p = 0.0002, mean of both: p&lt;0.00001). Several positive associations were found between hypermethylation and severe clinical phenotypes (CDX1 and miR-1247 and a refractory phenotype: p = 0.04 and 0.006, respectively. miR-1247 and CDH1 hyper methylation and a more severe Mayo endoscopic subscore: miR-1247: p = 0.0008, CDH1: p = 0.03, mean of both: p = 0.003). When the severe clinical phenotype was defined as having any of five phenotypes (hospitalized more than twice, highest Mayo endoscopic subscore, steroid dependence, refractory, or a history of surgery) miR-1247 hypermethylation was associated with the same phenotype (p = 0.008).
Our data suggest that variability in the methylation status of EMT-related genes is associated with more severe clinical phenotypes in UC.
RAGE, receptor for advanced glycation endoproducts (AGE), has been characterized as an activator of osteoclastgenesis. However, whether RAGE directly regulates chondrocyte proliferation and differentiation is unclear. Here, we show that RAGE has an inhibitory role in chondrocyte differentiation. RAGE expression was observed in chondrocytes from the prehypertrophic to hypertrophic regions. In cultured cells, overexpression of RAGE or dominant-negative-RAGE (DN-RAGE) demonstrated that RAGE inhibited cartilaginous matrix production, while DN-RAGE promoted production. Additionally, RAGE regulated Ihh and Col10a1 negatively but upregulated PTHrP receptor. Ihh promoter analysis and real-time PCR analysis suggested that downregulation of Cdxs was the key for RAGE-induced inhibition of chondrocyte differentiation. Overexpression of the NF-κB inhibitor I-κB-SR inhibited RAGE-induced NF-κB activation, but did not influence inhibition of cartilaginous matrix production by RAGE. The inhibitory action of RAGE was restored by the Rho family GTPases inhibitor Toxin B. Furthermore, inhibitory action on Ihh, Col10a1 and Cdxs was reproduced by constitutively active forms, L63RhoA, L61Rac, and L61Cdc42, but not by I-κB-SR. Cdx1 induced Ihh and Col10a1 expressions and directly interacted with Ihh promoter. Retinoic acid (RA) partially rescued the inhibitory action of RAGE. These data combined suggests that RAGE negatively regulates chondrocyte differentiation at the prehypertrophic stage by modulating NF-κB-independent and Rho family GTPases-dependent mechanisms. 
The molecular mechanism that regulates epicardial development has yet to be understood. In this study, we explored the function of CDX1, a Caudal-related family member, in epicardial epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and in the migration and the differentiation of epicardium-derived progenitors into vascular smooth muscle cells. We detected a transient expression of CDX1 in murine embryonic hearts at 11.5 days post coitum (dpc). Using a doxycycline-inducible CDX1 mouse model, primary epicardium, and ex vivo heart culture, we further demonstrated that ectopic expression of CDX1 promoted epicardial EMT. In addition, a low-dose CDX1 induction led to enhanced migration and differentiation of epicardium-derived cells into α-SMA+ vascular smooth muscles. In contrast, either continued high-level induction of CDX1 or CDX1 deficiency attenuated the ability of epicardium-derived cells to migrate and to mature into smooth muscles induced by TGF-β1. Further RNA-seq analyses showed that CDX1 induction altered the transcript levels of genes involved in neuronal development, angiogenesis, and cell adhesions required for EMT. Our data have revealed a previously undefined role of CDX1 during epicardial development, and suggest that transient expression of CDX1 promotes epicardial EMT, whereas subsequent down-regulation of CDX1 after 11.5 dpc in mice is necessary for further subepicardial invasion of EPDCs and contribution to coronary vascular endothelium or smooth muscle cells. 
Mesenchymal chondrosarcomas are fast-growing tumors that account for 2-10% of primary chondrosarcomas. Cytogenetic information is restricted to 12 cases that did not show a specific aberration pattern. Recently, two fusion genes were described in mesenchymal chondrosarcomas: a recurrent HEY1-NCOA2 found in tumors that had not been cytogenetically characterized and an IRF2BP2-CDX1 found in a tumor carrying a t(1;5)(q42;q32) translocation as the sole chromosomal abnormality. Here, we present the cytogenetic and molecular genetic analysis of a mesenchymal chondrosarcoma in which the patient had two histologically indistinguishable tumor lesions, one in the neck and one in the thigh. An abnormal clone with the G-banding karyotype 46,XX,add(6)(q23),add(8)(p23),del(10)(p11),+12,-15[6] was found in the neck tumor whereas a normal karyotype, 46,XX, was found in the tumor of the thigh. RT-PCR and Sanger sequencing showed that exon 4 of HEY1 was fused to exon 13 of NCOA2 in the sample from the thigh lesion; we did not have spare material to perform a similar analysis of the neck tumor. Examining the published karyotypes we observed numerical or structural aberrations of chromosome 8 in the majority of the karyotyped mesenchymal chondrosarcomas. Chromosome 8 was also structurally affected in the present study. The pathogenetic mechanisms behind this nonrandom involvement are unknown, but the presence on 8q of two genes, HEY1 and NCOA2, now known to be involved in mesenchymal chondrosarcoma tumorigenesis is, of course, suggestive.
Pathogenesis of early-onset preeclampsia (PE) is generally recognized by impaired trophoblast invasion of the myometrial arteries, which results in placental insufficiency. Recently, we reported that CDX1 is hypermethylated in the human preeclampsia placenta. However, whether CDX1 participates in trophoblast invasion has not been clearly elucidated.
We investigated the function of CDX1 in the extravillous trophoblast cell line HTR-8/SVneo using stable transfection of CDX1. Using a CDX1 stable transfected cell line, we determined the cell invasion using a QCM ECMatrix 24-well kit. The cell viability was detected using an MTT (3-[4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay. Quantitative RT-PCR and western blotting analyses were performed to examine the changes in the expression of downstream target genes and proteins. To disrupt PI3K/AKT signaling, we used the PI3K inhibitor perifosine.
Cell invasion assays demonstrated that CDX1 restricts trophoblast cell invasiveness. In contrast, quantification of cumulative cell numbers revealed that CDX1 did not affect cell proliferation. Western blotting analysis and quantitative real time PCR demonstrated that MMP-9 expression was reduced, whereas TIMP-1 expression was increased in CDX1-overexpressed cells. However, overexpression of CDX1 did not affect PI3K/AKT signaling in HTR-8/SVneo trophoblast cells. In contrast, CDX1 was regulated by the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway.
Altogether, we found that in trophoblast cells, CDX1 reduced invasion independently of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. Furthermore, CDX1 functions in concert with PI3K/AKT signaling to regulate trophoblast invasion. We concluded that CDX1 restricts the invasion of HTR-8/SVneo trophoblast cells by inhibiting MMP-9 expression independently of the PI3K/AKT pathway.
Pax3 encodes a paired-box transcription factor with key roles in neural crest and neural tube ontogenesis. Robust control of Pax3 neural expression is ensured by two redundant sets of cis-regulatory modules (CRMs) that integrate anterior-posterior (such as Wnt-βCatenin signaling) as well as dorsal-ventral (such as Shh-Gli signaling) instructive cues. In previous work, we sought to characterize the Wnt-mediated regulation of Pax3 expression and identified the Cdx transcription factors (Cdx1/2/4) as critical intermediates in this process. We identified the neural crest enhancer-2 (NCE2) from the 5'-flanking region of Pax3 as a Cdx-dependent CRM that recapitulates the restricted expression of Pax3 in the mouse caudal neuroectoderm. While this is consistent with a key role in relaying the inductive signal from posteriorizing Wnt ligands, the broad expression of Cdx proteins in the tailbud region is not consistent with the restricted activity of NCE2. This implies that other positive and/or negative inputs are required and, here, we report a novel role for the transcription factor Zic2 in this regulation. Our data strongly suggests that Zic2 is involved in the induction (as a direct Pax3NCE2 activator and Cdx neural cofactor) as well as the maintenance of Pax3 dorsal restriction (as a target of the ventral Shh repressive input). We also provide evidence that the inductive Cdx-Zic2 interaction is integrated on NCE2 with a positive input from the neural-specific transcription factor Sox2. Altogether, our data provide important mechanistic insights into the coordinated integration of different signaling pathways on a short Pax3 CRM. 
Oesophageal exposure to duodenogastroesophageal refluxate is implicated in the development of Barrett's metaplasia (BM), with increased risk of progression to oesophageal adenocarcinoma. The literature proposes that reflux exposure activates NF-κB, driving the aberrant expression of intestine-specific caudal-related homeobox (CDX) genes. However, early events in the pathogenesis of BM from normal epithelium are poorly understood. To investigate this, our study subjected a 3D model of the normal human oesophageal mucosa to repeated, pulsatile exposure to specific bile components and examined changes in gene expression. Initial 2D experiments with a range of bile salts observed that taurochenodeoxycholate (TCDC) impacted upon NF-κB activation without causing cell death. Informed by this, the 3D oesophageal model was repeatedly exposed to TCDC in the presence and absence of acid, and the epithelial cells underwent gene expression profiling. We identified ~300 differentially expressed genes following each treatment, with a large and significant overlap between treatments. Enrichment analysis (Broad GSEA, DAVID and Metacore™; GeneGo Inc) identified multiple gene sets related to cell signalling, inflammation, proliferation, differentiation and cell adhesion. Specifically NF-κB activation, Wnt signalling, cell adhesion and targets for the transcription factors PTF1A and HNF4α were highlighted. Our data suggest that HNF4α isoform switching may be an early event in Barrett's pathogenesis. CDX1/2 targets were, however, not enriched, suggesting that although CDX1/2 activation reportedly plays a role in BM development, it may not be an initial event. Our findings highlight new areas for investigation in the earliest stages of BM pathogenesis of oesophageal diseases and new potential therapeutic targets. 
Cyclooxygenases (prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthases, (EC 1.14.99.1) 1 and 2 (COX-1 and COX-2)) are key enzymes with a highly functional and pharmacological relevance. Genetic variations in the corresponding genes PTGS1 and PTGS2 are related to diverse human disorders and adverse drug reactions. Although COX-2 is highly inducible, most genetic association studies have focused on coding region gene variants. The aim of this study is to analyze the genetic variants modifying transcription factor binding sites in human PTGS genes based on the combined use of bioinformatics with 1,000 genomes data and replication by next generation sequencing. Updated information on gene sequences and variants was obtained from the 1,000 genomes website and from a replication sequencing study. Of the 570 upstream PTGS1 gene variants, 43 altered binding sites, either by disrupting existing sequences or by creating new binding sites. The most relevant are the SNP rs72769722, which creates a new binding site for NFKB, and the SNPs rs73559017 and rs76403914, both disrupting binding sites for CDX1. Of the 682 upstream PTGS2 gene variants, 31 altered binding sites, the most relevant being rs689466 and rs20417, which disrupt binding sequences for MYB and E2F, respectively; rs689462 which creates a new binding site for POU3F2; and a haplotype combining the SNPs rs34984585+rs10911904, which creates a new binding site for SRY. This study provides a detailed catalog of variant and invariant transcription factor binding sites for PTGS genes and related haplotypes. This information can be useful to identify potential genetic targets for studies related to COX enzymes. 
We focused on transcription factors and epigenetic marks that regulate the B3GALT5 gene through its retroviral long terminal repeat (LTR) promoter. We compared the expression levels of the B3GALT5 LTR transcript, quantitated by competitive RT-PCR, with those of the candidate transcription factors HNF1α/β and Cdx1/2, determined by Western blot analysis, in colon cancer biopsies, various cell lines, and cell models serving as controls. We found that HNF1α/β were easily detected, irrespective of the amount of LTR transcript expressed by the source, whereas Cdx1/2 were undetectable, and no sample lacking HNF1α/β expressed the LTR transcript. On transfection in proper host cells, both HNF1α and HNF1β provided detectable LTR transcript, whereas shRNA-mediated silencing of HNF1β impaired transcription. Treating cells with 5'-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5AZA) strongly reduced expression, without affecting HNF1α/β, despite the lack of CpG islands in the LTR and proximal sequences. By electrophoresis mobility shift and luciferase reporter assays, the LTR promoter binding and activity did not correlate with the amounts of LTR transcript expressed in the cells and depended on the levels of the transcription factors. We conclude that HNF1α/β are necessary but insufficient to activate and regulate B3GALT5 LTR transcription, which depends on unknown regulatory elements that are active when methylated and located outside of and far from the LTR promoter.
This paper presents commentaries on the microscopic morphology of esophageal squamous epithelium; the frequency of duplication of the muscularis mucosae (MM) in Barrett's esophagus (BE); the significance of multilayered epithelium; whether cells in the lamina propria reflect those in the epithelium; how stem cells are identified in the squamous esophagus; dilated intercellular spaces; the metastasizing potential of early carcinoma-dependent, molecular or immunohistochemical tests that improve diagnosis; the role of immunohistochemistry IHC in grading of neoplasia in Barrett's esophagus and defining the risk of progression to adenocarcinoma; the roles of CDX1 and CDX2 in squamous and cardiac mucosa; and the role of desmosomal cadherins and lectins in squamous and cardiac mucosa. 
Gastric cancer is one of the most outgoing human cancers in the world. Two main functional types were described: Intestinal adenocarcinoma and diffuse one. The most important purpose of this review is to analyze and investigate the main genetic factors involved in tumorogenesis of stomach and the molecular mechanism of their expression regulation alongside with the importance of cancer stem cells and their relationship with gastric cancer. It is evident that proper diagnosis of molecular case of cancer may lead to absolute treatment and at least reduction in the disease severity. However, stemness factors such as Sox2, Oct3/4, and Nanog were related with induced pluripotent stem cells, proposing a correlation between these stemness factors and cancer stem cells. Moreover, aberrant induction by Helicobacter pylori of the intestinal-specific homeobox transcription factors, CDX1 and CDX2, also plays an important role in this modification. There are some genes which are directly activated by CDX1 in gastric cancer and distinguished stemness-related reprogramming factors like SALL4 and KLF5. Correspondingly, we also aimed to present the main important epigenetic changes such as DNA methylation, histone modification, and chromatin modeling of stemness genes in disease development. Remarkably, a better understanding of molecular bases of cancer may lead to novel diagnostic, therapeutic, and preventive approaches by some genetic and epigenetic changes such as gene amplifications, gene silencing by DNA methylation, losses of imprinting, LOH, and mutations. Consequently, genome-wide searches of gene expression are widely important for surveying the proper mechanisms of cancer emergence and development. Conspicuously, this review explains an outline of the molecular mechanism and new approaches in gastric cancer. 
Barrett's esophagus (BE), the premalignant lesion of esophageal adenocarcinoma, is believed to develop as a result of chronic gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Approximately 10 % of subjects with GERD progress to BE. Genetic, epigenetic and other risk factors may contribute to this inter-individual variability. Caudal type homeobox 1 (Cdx1) and Caudal type homeobox 2 (Cdx2) play important regulatory roles in the development of human BE.
To determine associations between Cdx1 and Cdx2 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and BE.
Genomic DNA was extracted from blood samples collected from BE (n = 109) and GERD (n = 223) patients for genotyping of 5 SNPs each of Cdx1 and Cdx2 using TaqMan allelic discrimination assays. Odds ratios and 95 % confidence intervals of SNPs and haplotypes were calculated with a logistic regression model adjusted for factors including age, sex and hiatal hernia. Interactions between genetic variants and these three risk factors were also analyzed.
Older age (≥50 years), male sex and hiatal hernia were significantly associated with BE (P &lt; 0.001). Five variants of Cdx1 SNPs (rs3776082, rs717746 and rs3776083), one Cdx1 haplotype, and three variants of Cdx2 SNPs (rs4769585 and rs3812863) were associated with BE (P &lt; 0.05). Statistically significant interactions were detected between most of these SNPs and the three risk factors (P &lt; 0.05).
Certain SNPs of Cdx1 and Cdx2 and their interactions with other risk factors are associated with BE, and may contribute to human susceptibility to BE.
Single cancer stem-like cells (CSC) from colorectal cancers can be functionally identified by their ability to form large lumen-containing colonies in three-dimensional Matrigel cultures. These colonies contain the three types of differentiated colorectal epithelial cells, and single cells obtained from them can reproduce themselves and form tumors efficiently in immunodeficient mice. In this study, we show how hypoxia affects these CSC-derived lumens to control differentiation of stem-like cells and enterocytes via the homeobox gene CDX1. Lumens were identified by F-actin staining and they expressed many characteristics associated with normal differentiated intestinal epithelium, including brush border enzymes, polarization, and tight junctions. RNA interference-mediated silencing of CDX1 reduced lumen formation. Inhibitory effects of hypoxia on lumen formation and stem cell differentiation, including suppression of CDX1 expression, could be mimicked by inhibiting prolyl-hydroxylases that activate HIF1, suggesting that HIF1 is a critical mediator of the effects of hypoxia in this setting. Cell line-derived lumens were phenotypically indistinguishable from colorectal tumor glandular structures used by pathologists to grade tumor differentiation. Parallel results to those obtained with established cell lines were seen with primary cultures from fresh tumors. This in vitro approach to functional characterization of CSCs and their differentiation offers a valid model to study colorectal tumor differentiation and differentiation of colorectal CSCs, with additional uses to enable high-throughput screening for novel anticancer compounds.
Barrett's esophagus (BE) is characterized by intestinal metaplasia with the differentiated epithelium replaced by another type of epithelium morphologically similar to normal intestinal epithelium. The metaplasia is preceded by bile and acid reflux into the esophagus. BE is a premalignant condition associated with increased risk of esophageal cancer, especially esophageal adenocarcinoma. The Caudal-related homeodomain transcription factors Caudal-related homeodomain transcription factor CDX1 and CDX2 are expressed exclusively in the small and large intestine, playing important roles in proliferation and differentiation of intestinal epithelial cells. Ectopic expression of CDX1 and CDX2 occurs in BE. The apical sodium-dependent bile acid transporter (ASBT) is expressed primarily in terminal ileum where it is a key factor for intestinal reabsorption of bile salts. In addition to upregulation of CDX1 and CDX2, ASBT expression is up-regulated in BE. Furthermore, both CDX1/CDX2 and ASBT expressions are down-regulated in high-grade esophageal dysplasia. The alteration of the above-mentioned factors calls for attention: what is the relationship between CDXs and ASBT aberrant expression in BE? In this commentary, we discuss this issue on basis of the recent study done by Ma et al.
Retinoic acid (RA), an active derivative of the liposoluble vitamin A (retinol), acts as an important signaling molecule during embryonic development, regulating phenomenons as diverse as anterior-posterior axial patterning, forebrain and optic vesicle development, specification of hindbrain rhombomeres, pharyngeal arches and second heart field, somitogenesis, and differentiation of spinal cord neurons. This small molecule directly triggers gene activation by binding to nuclear receptors (RARs), switching them from potential repressors to transcriptional activators. The repertoire of RA-regulated genes in embryonic tissues is poorly characterized. We performed a comparative analysis of the transcriptomes of murine wild-type and Retinaldehyde Dehydrogenase 2 null-mutant (Raldh2 (-/-)) embryos - unable to synthesize RA from maternally-derived retinol - using Affymetrix DNA microarrays. Transcriptomic changes were analyzed in two embryonic regions: anterior tissues including forebrain and optic vesicle, and posterior (trunk) tissues, at early stages preceding the appearance of overt phenotypic abnormalities. Several genes expected to be downregulated under RA deficiency appeared in the transcriptome data (e.g. Emx2, Foxg1 anteriorly, Cdx1, Hoxa1, Rarb posteriorly), whereas reverse-transcriptase-PCR and in situ hybridization performed for additional selected genes validated the changes identified through microarray analysis. Altogether, the affected genes belonged to numerous molecular pathways and cellular/organismal functions, demonstrating the pleiotropic nature of RA-dependent events. In both tissue samples, genes upregulated were more numerous than those downregulated, probably due to feedback regulatory loops. Bioinformatic analyses highlighted groups (clusters) of genes displaying similar behaviors in mutant tissues, and biological functions most significantly affected (e.g. mTOR, VEGF, ILK signaling in forebrain tissues; pyrimidine and purine metabolism, calcium signaling, one carbon metabolism in posterior tissues). Overall, these data give an overview of the gene expression changes resulting from embryonic RA deficiency, and provide new candidate genes and pathways that may help understanding retinoid-dependent molecular events.
Chemoresistance is a major cause of treatment failure in colon cancer, and cancer stem cells have been found to be involved in the chemoresistance of colon cancer. However, the mechanisms driving the chemoresistance of colon cancer stem cells have not been addressed.
In this study, we investigated the cytotoxicity of paclitaxel in CD44(+)CD24(+) SW1222 colon cancer cells expressing Cdx1 (CD44(+)CD24(+)Cdx1(+) stem cells) and CD44(+)CD24(+) HCT116 colon cancer cells expressing wild-type p53 (CD44(+)CD24(+)p53wt stem cells).
SW1222 cells were more resistant to paclitaxel-induced cytotoxicity than HCT116 cells. Conversely, HCT-116 cells had higher matrigel colony formation ability than SW1222 cells. The isolated CD44(+)CD24(+)Cdx1(+) cells showed higher resistance to paclitaxel-induced cytotoxicity than CD44(+)CD24(+)p53wt cells. The resistance of CD44(+)CD24(+)Cdx1(+) cells to paclitaxel is associated with upregulation of Cdx1 and Bcl-2 expression, caspase-3 activity, and the ratio of LC3-II/LC3-I. The sensitivity of CD44(+)CD24(+)p53wt cells to paclitaxel is associated with the downregulation of Bcl-2 expression, upregulation of Bax levels, and upregulation of caspase-3 activity. Silencing of Cdx1 expression and treatment with lysosomal inhibitor bafilomycin A increased paclitaxel-induced cytotoxicity in CD44(+)CD24(+)Cdx1(+) cells. Conversely, overexpression of Cdx1 decreased cell death in CD44(+)CD24(+)p53wt cells. Intratumoral injection of Cdx1 siRNA significantly inhibited tumor growth in a xenograft tumor model inoculated with CD44(+)CD24(+)Cdx1(+) cancer cells.
Cdx1 exerts a protective role in colon cancer stem cells, which play a crucial role in chemoresistance to paclitaxel through activation of autophagy. Autophagy is activated though the Cdx1-Bcl-2-LC3 pathway. In contrast, p53 exerts a major role in apoptosis and inhibits autophagy in colon cancer stem cells.
The intestine-specific transcription factor, caudal type homeobox-1 (CDX1), is a candidate tumor suppressor gene that plays key roles in regulating intestinal epithelial differentiation and proliferation. It is aberrantly down-regulated in colorectal cancers and colon cancer-derived cell lines by promoter hypermethylation. Since the effects of oxidative stress on the transcription of tumor suppressor genes are largely unknown, this study explored the epigenetic alterations that occur during reactive oxygen species (ROS)-induced silencing of CDX1 in colorectal cancer cells. Oxidative stress by hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) down-regulated CDX1 mRNA levels and protein expression in the human colorectal cancer cell line, T-84. This down-regulation was abolished by pretreatment with the ROS scavenger, N-acetylcysteine. In addition, the DNA methylation inhibitor, 5-aza-2-deoxycytidine (5-Aza-dC) markedly attenuated the decrease in mRNA and protein expression levels induced by H2O2. Moreover, methylation-specific PCR data revealed that H2O2 treatment increased CDX1 promoter methylation, and treatment with 5-Aza-dC reversed this effect, suggesting that an epigenetic regulatory mechanism triggered by ROS-induced methylation may be involved in CDX1 expression. Furthermore, H2O2 treatment resulted in up-regulation of DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) and histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) expression and activity, and enhanced the association between DNMT1 and HDAC1. Taken together, these results suggest that ROS-induced oxidative stress silences the tumor suppressor CDX1 through epigenetic regulation, and may therefore be associated with the progression of colorectal cancer.
The interplay between gastric and intestinal transcription factors has an important impact on gastric carcinogenesis. We compared the gene expression of CDX1, CDX2, SOX2 and related downstream genes in tumour and tumour surrounding gastric tissue of 48 gastric cancer patients with 30 healthy controls. There was no difference of gene expression of CDX1 and CDX2 between tumour or tumour-adjacent and tumour-distant mucosa, but both factors were significantly higher expressed in cancer patients compared with controls (p&lt;0.01). SOX2 was downregulated in tumour tissue compared to controls, whereas tumour-adjacent and tumour-distant mucosa showed intermediate SOX2 expression. Laurén type and Helicobacter pylori infection had no significant impact on expression of the transcription factors. Expression of CDX1 and CDX2 was higher in the presence of intestinal metaplasia. The differential regulation of the gene expression of CDX1, CDX2 and SOX2 in patients with gastric cancer affects not only the tumour but also the non-neoplastic tumour-distant mucosa. 
Primary osteoarthritis (OA) is a multifactorial disorder with several genetics factors involved. Calcitonin (CT) has been suggested to possess chondroprotective effects and could play an important role in the pathogenesis of OA. The aim of this study was to investigate whether genetic variations in or adjacent to the CT gene may be associated with primary OA of the knee in Mexican mestizo population. We conducted a case-control study to investigate the association between six single nucleotide polymorphisms at the CT locus and OA of the knee in 107 cases and 106 controls. Cases were patients &gt;40 years of age, with a body mass index (BMI) ≤ 27 and a radiologic score for OA of the knee ≥ 2. Controls were subjects &gt;40 years of age with a radiologic score &lt;2. Non-conditional logistic regression was developed to evaluate risk magnitude. The G allele and GT genotype frequencies of the G-706T polymorphism and the C allele and CC genotype of the C-778T polymorphism were significantly higher in patients with OA than in control subjects. The GG genotype of the G-706T was associated with lower risk of the development of OA of the knee. According to the results, the G-706T and the C-778T polymorphisms were related to the Cdx1 and Mzf1 transcription factor binding sites, respectively. Therefore, these could be related to regulation sequences in the CT gene promoter. In conclusion, G-706T and C-778T polymorphisms in the CT gene are significantly associated with the development of primary OA of the knee.
Mice lacking the 4th-group paralog Hoxd4 display malformations of the anterior vertebral column, but are viable and fertile. Here, we report that zebrafish embryos having decreased function of the orthologous hoxd4a gene manifest striking perturbations in vasculogenesis, angiogenesis and primitive and definitive hematopoiesis. These defects are preceded by reduced expression of the hemangioblast markers scl1, lmo2 and fli1 within the posterior lateral plate mesoderm (PLM) at 13 hours post fertilization (hpf). Epistasis analysis revealed that hoxd4a acts upstream of meis1.1 but downstream of cdx4 as early as the shield stage in ventral-most mesoderm fated to give rise to hemangioblasts, leading us to propose that loss of hoxd4a function disrupts hemangioblast specification. These findings place hoxd4a high in a genetic hierarchy directing hemangioblast formation downstream of cdx1/cdx4 and upstream of meis1.1. An additional consequence of impaired hoxd4a and meis1.1 expression is the deregulation of multiple Hox genes implicated in vasculogenesis and hematopoiesis which may further contribute to the defects described here. Our results add to evidence implicating key roles for Hox genes in their initial phase of expression early in gastrulation.
Chiari malformation type I (CMI) is a disorder characterized by hindbrain overcrowding into an underdeveloped posterior cranial fossa (PCF), often causing progressive neurological symptoms. The etiology of CMI remains unclear and is most likely multifactorial. A putative genetic contribution to CMI is suggested by familial aggregation and twin studies. Experimental models and human morphometric studies have suggested an underlying paraxial mesoderm insufficiency. We performed a case-control association study of 303 tag single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) across 58 candidate genes involved in early paraxial mesoderm development in a sample of 415 CMI patients and 524 sex-matched controls. A subgroup of patients diagnosed with classical, small-PCF CMI by means of MRI-based PCF morphometry (n = 186), underwent additional analysis. The genes selected are involved in signalling gradients occurring during segmental patterning of the occipital somites (FGF8, Wnt, and retinoic acid pathways and from bone morphogenetic proteins or BMP, Notch, Cdx and Hox pathways) or in placental angiogenesis, sclerotome development or CMI-associated syndromes. Single-marker analysis identified nominal associations with 18 SNPs in 14 genes (CDX1, FLT1, RARG, NKD2, MSGN1, RBPJ1, FGFR1, RDH10, NOG, RARA, LFNG, KDR, ALDH1A2, BMPR1A) considering the whole CMI sample. None of these overcame corrections for multiple comparisons, in contrast with four SNPs in CDX1, FLT1 and ALDH1A2 in the classical CMI group. Multiple marker analysis identified a risk haplotype for classical CMI in ALDH1A2 and CDX1. Furthermore, we analyzed the possible contributions of the most significantly associated SNPs to different PCF morphometric traits. These findings suggest that common variants in genes involved in somitogenesis and fetal vascular development may confer susceptibility to CMI.
The caudal-related homeodomain transcription factors Cdx1 and Cdx2 are expressed in the developing endoderm with expression persisting into adulthood. Cdx1(-/-) mutants are viable and fertile and display no overt intestinal phenotype. Cdx2 null mutants are peri-implantation lethal; however, conditional mutation approaches have revealed that Cdx2 is required for patterning the intestinal epithelium and specification of the colon. Cdx2 is also necessary for homeostasis of the intestinal tract in the adult, where Cdx1 and Cdx2 appear to functionally overlap in the distal colon, but not during intestinal development. Cdx1 and Cdx2 exhibit complete overlap of expression in the intestine, although they differ in their relative levels, with Cdx1 maximal in the distal colon and Cdx2 peaking in the proximal cecum. Moreover, Cdx1 protein is graded along the crypt-villus axis, being abundant in the crypts and diminishing towards the villi. Cdx2 is expressed uniformly along this axis, but is differentially phosphorylated; the functional relevance of these expression domains and phosphorylation is currently unknown. Cdx1 and Cdx2 have been suggested to exhibit functional specificity in the intestinal tract. In the present study, using cell-based models, we found that relative to Cdx1, Cdx2 was significantly less potent at effecting a transcriptional response from the Cdx1 promoter, a known Cdx target gene. We subsequently assessed this relationship in vivo using a "gene swap" approach and found that Cdx2 cannot substitute for Cdx1 in this autoregulatory loop. This is in marked contrast with the ability of Cdx2 to support Cdx1 expression and function in paraxial mesoderm and vertebral patterning, thus providing novel in vivo evidence of context-dependent transcriptional specificity between these transcription factors.
Caudal-related homeobox 1 (CDX1), an intestinal-specific transcription factor, has been reported to have vital roles in gastric intestinal metaplasia (IM). Although IM is a high-risk factor for gastric cancer (GC), the specific role of CDX1 in GC is largely unknown. In this study, we investigated the expression of CDX1 and its functional roles in GC, and its upstream regulatory mechanisms at the microRNA (miRNA) level were further explored. We found that CDX1 is lost in GC when compared with adjacent IM tissues. Gain-of-function studies showed that CDX1 significantly inhibited GC cell growth by inducing cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Interestingly, we identified and verified an onco-mir, miR-296-5p, as a direct upstream regulator of CDX1. miR-296-5p overexpression significantly promoted GC cell growth and attenuated the CDX1-induced anti-growth effects by recurring cell cycle distribution and apoptotic status, whereas knockdown of miR-296-5p decreased GC cell growth. Furthermore, we found that the extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) activation and the subsequent downstream changes in protein levels related to cell cycle and apoptosis partly account for the miR-296-5p-CDX1-induced GC growth promotion. In addition, the detection of miR-296-5p and expression of CDX1 in primary GC tissues and adjacent IM tissues revealed that miR-296-5p is inversely correlated with CDX1, further supporting our in vitro results. Our results showed an anti-growth effect of CDX1 and identified its miRNA regulatory mechanism in GC. The identification of this novel miR-296-5p-CDX1-ERK1/2 axis sheds new light on the understanding of the process from IM to GC and may provide therapeutic targets for the treatment of GC. 
Anorectal malformations (ARMs) represent a variety of congenital disorders that involve abnormal termination of the anorectum. This study was to reveal relation between CDX1 and human ARMs phenotypes.
108 Chinese patients and 120 Chinese controls were included in this study. We analyzed the relation between two by PCR, qRT-PCR, western blot and immunofluorescence.
Four heterozygous mutations in CDX1 gene were identified in ARMs patients (3.7%, 4/108), no found in controls. CDX1 protein expression was significantly decreased in the ARMs compared with the control anorectum. All samples analyzed in ARMs group exhibited down-regulated CDX1 mRNA expression in comparison to matched normal group, demonstrated significant differences statistically.
The findings represented the relation between CDX1 mutations and CDX1 genotype. Furthermore, it was suggested that the downregulation of CDX1 might be related to the development of ARMs.
Kruppel-like factor 5 (Klf5) is a transcription factor expressed by embryonic endodermal progenitors that form the lining of the gastrointestinal tract. A Klf5 floxed allele was efficiently deleted from the intestinal epithelium by a Cre transgene under control of the Shh promoter resulting in the inhibition of villus morphogenesis and epithelial differentiation. Although proliferation of the intestinal epithelium was maintained, the expression of Elf3, Pparγ, Atoh1, Ascl2, Neurog3, Hnf4α, Cdx1, and other genes associated with epithelial cell differentiation was inhibited in the Klf5-deficient intestines. At E18.5, Klf5(Δ/Δ) fetuses lacked the apical brush border characteristic of enterocytes, and a loss of goblet and enteroendocrine cells was observed. The failure to form villi was not attributable to the absence of HH or PDGF signaling, known mediators of this developmental process. Klf5-deletion blocked the decrease in FoxA1 and Sox9 expression that accompanies normal villus morphogenesis. KLF5 directly inhibited activity of the FoxA1 promoter, and in turn FOXA1 inhibited Elf3 gene expression in vitro, linking the observed loss of Elf3 with the persistent expression of FoxA1 observed in Klf5-deficient mice. Genetic network analysis identified KLF5 as a key transcription factor regulating intestinal cell differentiation and cell adhesion. These studies indicate a novel requirement for KLF5 to initiate morphogenesis of the early endoderm into a compartmentalized intestinal epithelium comprised of villi and terminally differentiated cells.
We have utilized retinoic acid receptor γ (gamma) knockout (RARγ(-/-)) embryonic stem (ES) cells as a model system to analyze RARγ mediated transcriptional regulation of stem cell differentiation. Most of the transcripts regulated by all-trans retinoic acid (RA) in ES cells are dependent upon functional RARγ signaling. Notably, many of these RA-RARγ target genes are implicated in retinoid uptake and metabolism. For instance, Lrat (lecithin:retinol acyltransferase), Stra6 (stimulated by retinoic acid 6), Crabp2 (cellular retinoic acid binding protein 2), and Cyp26a1 (cytochrome p450 26a1) transcripts are induced in wild type (WT), but not in RARγ(-/-) cells. Transcripts for the transcription factors Pbx1 (pre-B cell leukemia homeobox-1), Wt1 (Wilm's tumor gene-1), and Meis1 (myeloid ecotropic viral integration site-1) increase upon RA treatment of WT, but not RARγ(-/-) cells. In contrast, Stra8, Dleu7, Leftb, Pitx2, and Cdx1 mRNAs are induced by RA even in the absence of RARγ. Mapping of the epigenetic signature of Meis1 revealed that RA induces a rapid increase in the H3K9/K14ac epigenetic mark at the proximal promoter and at two sites downstream of the transcription start site in WT, but not in RARγ(-/-) cells. Thus, RA-associated increases in H3K9/K14ac epigenetic marks require RARγ and are associated with increased Meis1 transcript levels, whereas H3K4me3 is present at the Meis1 proximal promoter even in the absence of RARγ. In contrast, at the Lrat proximal promoter primarily the H3K4me3 mark, and not the H3K9/K14ac mark, increases in response to RA, independently of the presence of RARγ. Our data show major epigenetic changes associated with addition of the RARγ agonist RA in ES cells.
Mesenchymal chondrosarcomas (MCs) account for 3-10% of primary chondrosarcomas. The cytogenetic literature includes only ten such tumours with karyotypic information and no specific aberrations have been identified. Using a purely molecular genetic approach a HEY1-NCOA2 fusion gene was recently detected in 10 of 15 investigated MCs. The fusion probably arises through intrachromosomal rearrangement of chromosome arm 8 q. We report a new case of MC showing a t(1;5)(q42;q32) as the sole karyotypic aberration. Through FISH and whole transcriptome sequencing analysis we found a novel fusion between the IRF2BP2 gene and the transcription factor CDX1 gene arising from the translocation. The IRF2BP2-CDX1 has not formerly been described in human neoplasia. In our hospital's archives three more cases of MC were found, and we examined them looking for the supposedly more common HEY1-NCOA2 fusion, finding it in all three tumours but not in the case showing t(1;5) and IRF2BP2-CDX1 gene fusion. This demonstrates that genetic heterogeneity exists in mesenchymal chondrosarcoma.
Cdx and Hox gene families encode homeodomain-containing transcription factors involved in anterior-posterior vertebral patterning. Although Cdx proteins are direct transcriptional regulators of Hox gene expression, both Hox and Cdx proteins are known to interact with other homeodomain transcription factors, leading us to speculate that Cdx and Hox proteins may also interact physically. In testing this, we found that that Cdx1 is indeed capable of associating with a subset of Hox proteins. This interaction is localized to the homeodomain region of both classes of proteins, is reliant on specific arginine residues in helix I of the Hox homeodomain, and is further modulated by N-terminal Hox sequences. More promiscuous interactions were seen with Hox proteins expressed in vivo, suggestive of bridging factors or post-translational modifications. Finally, we demonstrate that this interaction modulates Cdx-Hox transcriptional activity on a Hox-responsive element. This study is the first example of Cdx-Hox protein interactions and suggests that such complexes may modulate Hox and/or Cdx function.
Intestinal metaplasia of the stomach, a mucosal change characterized by the conversion of gastric epithelium into an intestinal phenotype, is a precancerous lesion from which intestinal-type gastric adenocarcinoma arises. Chronic infection with Helicobacter pylori is a major cause of gastric intestinal metaplasia, and aberrant induction by H. pylori of the intestine-specific caudal-related homeobox (CDX) transcription factors, CDX1 and CDX2, plays a key role in this metaplastic change. As such, a critical issue arises as to how these factors govern the cell- and tissue-type switching. In this study, we explored genes directly activated by CDX1 in gastric epithelial cells and identified stemness-associated reprogramming factors SALL4 and KLF5. Indeed, SALL4 and KLF5 were aberrantly expressed in the CDX1(+) intestinal metaplasia of the stomach in both humans and mice. In cultured gastric epithelial cells, sustained expression of CDX1 gave rise to the induction of early intestinal-stemness markers, followed by the expression of intestinal-differentiation markers. Furthermore, the induction of these markers was suppressed by inhibiting either SALL4 or KLF5 expression, indicating that CDX1-induced SALL4 and KLF5 converted gastric epithelial cells into tissue stem-like progenitor cells, which then transdifferentiated into intestinal epithelial cells. Our study places the stemness-related reprogramming factors as critical components of CDX1-directed transcriptional circuitries that promote intestinal metaplasia. Requirement of a transit through dedifferentiated stem/progenitor-like cells, which share properties in common with cancer stem cells, may underlie predisposition of intestinal metaplasia to neoplastic transformation.
Members of the caudal gene family (in mice and humans: Cdx1, Cdx2, and Cdx4) have been studied during early development as regulators of axial elongation and anteroposterior patterning. In the adult, Cdx1 and Cdx2, but not Cdx4, have been intensively explored for their function in intestinal tissue homeostasis and the pathogenesis of gastrointestinal cancers. Involvement in embryonic hematopoiesis was first demonstrated in zebrafish, where cdx genes render posterior lateral plate mesoderm competent to respond to genes specifying hematopoietic fate, and compound mutations in cdx genes thus result in a bloodless phenotype. Parallel studies performed in zebrafish embryos and murine embryonic stem cells (ESCs) delineate conserved pathways between fish and mammals, corroborating a BMP/Wnt-Cdx-Hox axis during blood development that can be employed to augment derivation of blood progenitors from pluripotent stem cells in vitro. The molecular regulation of Cdx genes appears complex, as more recent data suggest involvement of non-Hox-related mechanisms and the existence of auto- and cross-regulatory loops governed by morphogens. Here, we will review the role of Cdx genes during hematopoietic development by comparing effects in zebrafish and mice and discuss their participation in malignant blood diseases.
Crosstalk between the Notch and wingless-type MMTV integration site (WNT) signaling pathways has been investigated for many developmental processes. However, this negative correlation between Notch and WNT/β-catenin signaling activity has been studied primarily in normal developmental and physiological processes in which negative feedback loops for both signaling pathways are intact. We found that Notch1 signaling retained the capability of suppressing the expression of WNT target genes in colorectal cancers even when β-catenin destruction by the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) complex was disabled. Activation of Notch1 converted high-grade adenoma into low-grade adenoma in an Apcmin mouse colon cancer model and suppressed the expression of WNT target genes in human colorectal cancer cells through epigenetic modification recruiting histone methyltransferase SET domain bifurcated 1 (SETDB1). Extensive microarray analysis of human colorectal cancers also showed a negative correlation between the Notch1 target gene, Notch-regulated ankyrin repeat protein 1 (NRARP), and WNT target genes. Notch is known to be a strong promoter of tumor initiation, but here we uncovered an unexpected suppressive role of Notch1 on WNT/β-catenin target genes involved in colorectal cancer.
The mammalian transcriptional factors, Cdx1 and Cdx2 (Cdx is caudal-type homeobox) are paralogues and critical for the cellular differentiation of intestinal or colorectal epithelia. It has been reported previously that in Cdx1 transgenic or knockout mice, endogenous Cdx2 levels are inversely correlated with Cdx1 levels. Recently, we found that exogenous Cdx1 expression can suppress Cdx2 in a human colorectal tumour cell line, SW480, although the underlying molecular mechanisms were unclear. In the present study, we show that several microRNAs induced by exogenous Cdx1 expression directly bind to the CDX2 mRNA 3'UTR (untranslated region) to destabilize these transcripts, finally leading to their degradation. Using microarray analysis, we found that several miRNAs that were computationally predicted to target CDX2 mRNAs are up-regulated by exogenous Cdx1 expression in SW480 cells. Among these molecules, we identified miR-9, miR-16 and miR-22 as having the potential to suppress Cdx2 through the binding of the 3'UTR to its transcript. Importantly, simultaneous mutations of both the miR-9- and miR-16-binding sites in the CDX2 3'UTR were shown to be sufficient to block Cdx2 suppression. The results of the present study suggest a unique feature of miRNAs in which they contribute to homoeostasis by limiting the levels of transcription factors belonging to the same gene family.
The caudal homeobox factor 1 (CDX1) is an essential transcription factor for intestinal differentiation. Its aberrant expression in intestinal metaplasia of the upper gastrointestinal tract is a hallmark within the gastritis-metaplasia-carcinoma sequence. CDX1 expression is influenced by certain pathways, such as Wnt, Ras, or NF-κB signaling; however, these pathways alone cannot explain the transient expression of CDX1 in intestinal metaplasia or the molecular inactivation mechanism of its loss in cases of advanced gastric cancer. In this study, we investigated the epigenetic inactivation of CDX1 by promoter methylation, as well as the functional link of CDX1 promoter methylation to the inflammatory NF-κB signaling pathway. We identified methylation-dependent NF-κB binding to the CDX1 promoter and quantified it using competitive electrophoretic mobility shift assays and chromatin immunoprecipitation. A methylated CDX1 promoter was associated with closed chromatin structure, reduced NF-κB binding, and transcriptional silencing. Along the gastritis-metaplasia-carcinoma sequence, we observed a biphasic pattern of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) protein expression and an inverse biphasic pattern of CDX1 promoter methylation; both are highly consistent with CDX1 protein expression. The stages of hyper-, hypo-, and hyper-methylation patterns of the CDX1 promoter were inversely correlated with the NF-κB signaling activity along this sequence. In conclusion, these functionally interacting events drive CDX1 expression and contribute to intestinal metaplasia, epithelial dedifferentiation, and carcinogenesis in the human stomach.
Accurate expression profiling is imperative for understanding the biological roles of mRNAs. Real-time PCR have been at the forefront of biological innovation in detection and monitoring of gene expression, however, fluorophore-labeled oligonucleotides and double-stranded DNA binding dyes, the two most frequently used dyes in RNA detection, are not very cost effective and have poor specificity, respectively. We have developed a cost effective and specific approach for mRNA expression profiling via added unique sequence index (USI) to cDNAs before amplification. USI is a barcode which enable the detection of each target RNA. Using this method, caudal type homeobox 1 (CDX1) and FAT atypical cadherin 4 (FAT4) expressions were investigated in tumoral and non-tumoral tissues of gastric cancer patients and compared with commercial ABI kit. Both methods indicated that FAT4 and CDX1 expression were significantly reduced in gastric cancer tissues compared with adjacent noncancerous tissues. Moreover, we have shown that this assay is highly sensitive, linear and reproducible. USI barcode not only provides a powerful tool for mRNA detection due to its sensitivity, specificity and cost-effectiveness, but also allows comfortable design for real-time qPCR assays within the least time and empowers the analysis of many transcripts of virtually any organism. Furthermore, USI barcode is highly affordable for large numbers of different samples or small sample sizes without microarray and expensive commercial platforms.
The packaging of genomic DNA into nucleosomes creates a barrier to transcription that can be relieved through ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling via complexes such as the switch-sucrose non-fermentable (SWI-SNF) chromatin remodeling complex. The SWI-SNF complex remodels chromatin via conformational or positional changes of nucleosomes, thereby altering the access of transcriptional machinery to target genes. The SWI-SNF complex has limited ability to bind to sequence-specific elements, and, therefore, its recruitment to target loci is believed to require interaction with DNA-associated transcription factors. The Cdx family of homeodomain transcript ion factors (Cdx1, Cdx2, and Cdx4) are essential for a number of developmental programs in the mouse. Cdx1 and Cdx2 also regulate intestinal homeostasis throughout life. Although a number of Cdx target genes have been identified, the basis by which Cdx members impact their transcription is poorly understood. We have found that Cdx members interact with the SWI-SNF complex and make direct contact with Brg1, a catalytic member of SWI-SNF. Both Cdx2 and Brg1 co-occupy a number of Cdx target genes, and both factors are necessary for transcriptional regulation of such targets. Finally, Cdx2 and Brg1 occupancy occurs coincident with chromatin remodeling at some of these loci. Taken together, our findings suggest that Cdx transcription factors regulate target gene expression, in part, through recruitment of Brg1-associated SWI-SNF chromatin remodeling activity.
The Cdx transcription factors play essential roles in primitive hematopoiesis in the zebrafish where they exert their effects, in part, through regulation of hox genes. Defects in hematopoiesis have also been reported in Cdx mutant murine embryonic stem cell models, however, to date no mouse model reflecting the zebrafish Cdx mutant hematopoietic phenotype has been described. This is likely due, in part, to functional redundancy among Cdx members and the early lethality of Cdx2 null mutants. To circumvent these limitations, we used Cre-mediated conditional deletion to assess the impact of concomitant loss of Cdx1 and Cdx2 on murine primitive hematopoiesis. We found that Cdx1/Cdx2 double mutants exhibited defects in primitive hematopoiesis and yolk sac vasculature concomitant with reduced expression of several genes encoding hematopoietic transcription factors including Scl/Tal1. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis revealed that Scl was occupied by Cdx2 in vivo, and Cdx mutant hematopoietic yolk sac differentiation defects could be rescued by expression of exogenous Scl. These findings demonstrate critical roles for Cdx members in murine primitive hematopoiesis upstream of Scl.
Valproic acid (VPA), an antiepileptic drug, is a teratogen that causes neural tube and axial skeletal defects, although the mechanisms are not fully understood. We previously established a gastrulation model using mouse P19C5 stem cell embryoid bodies (EBs), which exhibits axial patterning and elongation morphogenesis in vitro. Here, we investigated the effects of VPA on the EB axial morphogenesis to gain insights into its teratogenic mechanisms. Axial elongation and patterning of EBs were inhibited by VPA at therapeutic concentrations. VPA elevated expression levels of various developmental regulators, including Cdx1 and Hoxa1, known transcriptional targets of retinoic acid (RA) signaling. Co-treatment of EBs with VPA and BMS493, an RA receptor antagonist, partially rescued axial elongation as well as gene expression profiles. These results suggest that VPA requires active RA signaling to interfere with EB morphogenesis.
The NEDD8 conjugation pathway modulates the ubiquitination and activity of a wide range of intracellular proteins, and its blockade by pevonedistat is emerging as a promising therapeutic approach in various cancer settings. However, systematic characterization of pevonedistat efficacy in specific tumor types and definition of response predictors are still missing.
We investigated in vitro sensitivity to pevonedistat in 122 colorectal cancer (CRC) cell lines by an ATP-based proliferation assay and evaluated apoptosis and DNA content by flow cytometry. Associations between pevonedistat sensitivity and CRC molecular features were assessed by Student's t test. A 184-gene transcriptional predictor was generated in cell lines and applied to 87 metastatic CRC samples for which patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) were available. In vivo reponse to pevonedistat was assessed in PDX models (≥5 mice per group). All statistical tests were two-sided.
Sixteen (13.1%) cell lines displayed a marked response to pevonedistat, featuring DNA re-replication, proliferative block, and increased apoptosis. Pevonedistat sensitivity did not statistically significantly correlate with microsatellite instability or mutations in KRAS or BRAF and was functionally associated with low EGFR pathway activity. While ineffective on predicted resistant PDXs, in vivo administration of pevonedistat statistically significantly impaired growth of five out of six predicted sensitive models (P &lt; .01). In samples from CRC patients, transcriptional prediction of pevonedistat sensitivity was associated with poor prognosis after surgery (hazard ratio [HR] = 2.49, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.34 to 4.62, P = .003) and early progression under cetuximab treatment (HR = 3.59, 95% CI = 1.60 to 8.04, P &lt; .001). Histological and immunohistochemical analyses revealed that the pevonedistat sensitivity signature captures transcriptional traits of poor differentiation and high-grade mucinous adenocarcinoma.
These results highlight NEDD8-pathway inhibition by pevonedistat as a potentially effective treatment for poorly differentiated, clinically aggressive CRC.
Huntingtin-associated Protein 1 (HAP1) is expressed in neurons and endocrine cells, and is critical for postnatal survival in mice. HAP1 shares a conserved "HAP1_N" domain with TRAfficking Kinesin proteins TRAK1 and TRAK2 (vertebrate), Milton (Drosophila) and T27A3.1 (C. elegans). HAP1, TRAK1 and TRAK2 have a degree of common function, particularly regarding intracellular receptor trafficking. However, TRAK1, TRAK2 and Milton (which have a "Milt/TRAK" domain that is absent in human and rodent HAP1) differ in function to HAP1 in that they are mitochondrial transport proteins, while HAP1 has emerging roles in starvation response. We have investigated HAP1 function by examining its evolution, and upstream gene promoter sequences. We performed phylogenetic analyses of the HAP1_N domain family of proteins, incorporating HAP1 orthologues (identified by genomic synteny) from 5 vertebrate classes, and also searched the Dictyostelium proteome for a common ancestor. Computational analyses of mammalian HAP1 gene promoters were performed to identify phylogenetically conserved regulatory motifs.
We found that as recently as marsupials, HAP1 contained a Milt/TRAK domain and was more similar to TRAK1 and TRAK2 than to eutherian HAP1. The Milt/TRAK domain likely arose post multicellularity, as it was absent in the Dictyostelium proteome. It was lost from HAP1 in the eutherian lineage, and also from T27A3.1 in C. elegans. The HAP1 promoter from human, mouse, rat, rabbit, horse, dog, Tasmanian devil and opossum contained common sites for transcription factors involved in cell cycle, growth, differentiation, and stress response. A conserved arrangement of regulatory elements was identified, including sites for caudal-related homeobox transcription factors (CDX1 and CDX2), and myc-associated factor X (MAX) in the region of the TATA box. CDX1 and CDX2 are intestine-enriched factors, prompting investigation of HAP1 protein expression in the human duodenum. HAP1 was localized to singly dispersed mucosal cells, including a subset of serotonin-positive enterochromaffin cells.
We have identified eutherian HAP1 as an evolutionarily recent adaptation of a vertebrate TRAK protein-like ancestor, and found conserved CDX1/CDX2 and MAX transcription factor binding sites near the TATA box in mammalian HAP1 gene promoters. We also demonstrated that HAP1 is expressed in endocrine cells of the human gut.
Homeobox genes, including HOX and non-HOX genes, have been identified to be expressed aberrantly in solid tumors. In gastrointestinal (GI) cancers, most studies have focused on the function of non-HOX genes including caudal-related homeobox transcription factor 1 (CDX1) and CDX2. CDX2 is a crucial factor in the development of pre-cancerous lesions such as Barrett's esophagus or intestinal metaplasia in the stomach, and its tumor suppressive role has been investigated in colorectal cancers. Recently, several HOX genes were reported to have specific roles in GI cancers; for example, HOXA13 in esophageal squamous cell cancer and HOXB7 in stomach and colorectal cancers. HOXD10 is upregulated in colorectal cancer while it is silenced epigenetically in gastric cancer. Thus, it is essential to examine the differential expression pattern of various homeobox genes in specific tumor types or cell lineages, and understand their underlying mechanisms. In this review, we summarize the available research on homeobox genes and present their potential value for the prediction of prognosis in GI cancers.
The pathogenesis of precursor lesions of gastrointestinal tumors is manifested in many ways. In the esophagus an aberrant genetic expression of intestinal transcription factors, such as CDX2 is initiated by local environment factors. During the subsequent dysplasia to carcinoma sequence, chromosomal gain and loss of genes occurs. A 4-color fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) assay can be applied in dysplasia as well as in Barrett's adenocarcinoma to define prognostic marker combinations. In the gastric carcinogenesis sequence the gene expression of CDX1 is regulatively dependent on an interplay between inflammation and promotor methylation. In the colon sessile serrated adenomas show a sequence with initial BRAF mutation and late onset of MLH1 promotor hypermethylation with consecutive potential cancer progression. This event is accompanied by an increase of intraepithelial lymphocytes, which is an easy to use tool for routine diagnostics using H&amp;E sections. Next generation sequencing (NGS) investigations of germline mutations in colorectal cancer revealed a spectrum of mutations with low penetration in the field of mismatch repair proteins as well as the APC gene. An individual risk stratification for penetration of these germline mutations is necessary. In conclusion, genetics, phenotypes and terminology of gastrointestinal precursor lesions are unified to a mutually influencing concept within medicine.
Mild exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation is also harmful and hazardous to the skin and often causes a photosensitivity disorder accompanied by sunburn. To understand the action of UV on the skin we performed a microarray analysis to isolate UV-sensitive genes. We show here that UV irradiation promoted sunburn and downregulated filaggrin (Flg); fucoxanthin (FX) exerted a protective effect. In vitro analysis showed that UV irradiation of human dermal fibroblasts caused production of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) without cellular toxicity. ROS production was diminished by N-acetylcysteine (NAC) or FX, but not by retinoic acid (RA). In vivo analysis showed that UV irradiation caused sunburn and Flg downregulation, and that FX, but not NAC, RA or clobetasol, exerted a protective effect. FX stimulated Flg promoter activity in a concentration-dependent manner. Flg promoter deletion and chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis showed that caudal type homeo box transcription factor 1 (Cdx1) was a key factor for Flg induction. Cdx1 was also downregulated in UV-exposed skin. Therefore, our data suggested that the protective effects of FX against UV-induced sunburn might be exerted by promotion of skin barrier formation through induction of Flg, unrelated to quenching of ROS or an RA-like action.
The caudal-type homeobox 1 (CDX1) transcription factor is a member of the caudal-related homeobox transcription factor gene family and has been reported to be down-regulated in a variety of cancers. However, the expression status and significance of CDX1 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is still controversial, and little is known about the role of CDX1 in HCC·In our previous study, we investigated the expression and clinical significance of CDX1 in HCC samples from 313 HCC patients. We found CDX1 was strikingly down-regulated in HCC samples. CDX1 expression was associated with poor differentiation (P = 0.002), and patients with low CDX1 expression had a significantly poorer prognosis. A subgroup analysis revealed a difference in prognosis between groups with low and high CDX1 expression among patients who had tumors &lt;5 cm in size and who were alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) negative. Moreover, low expression was more frequently observed in the early recurrence group (within 2 years, P = 0.002). In addition, multivariate Cox regression analysis indicated that the CDX1 expression level, tumor size, presence of hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg), vascular invasion, and presence of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) were independent risk factors for HCC recurrence, and the CDX1 expression level, tumor size, tumor number, and presence of HBsAg were independent predictor of overall survival of HCC patients. In conclusion, the downregulation of CDX1 is associated with poor prognosis; and it may serve as a novel predictor of the prognosis of HCC patients after curative resection. 
Cell type specification relies on the capacity of undifferentiated cells to properly respond to specific differentiation-inducing signals. Using genomic approaches along with loss- and gain-of-function genetic models, we identified OCT4-dependent mechanisms that provide embryonic stem cells with the means to customize their response to external cues. OCT4 binds a large set of low-accessible genomic regions. At these sites, OCT4 is required for proper enhancer and gene activation by recruiting co-regulators and RAR:RXR or β-catenin, suggesting an unexpected collaboration between the lineage-determining transcription factor and these differentiation-initiating, signal-dependent transcription factors. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate that overexpression of OCT4 in a kidney cell line is sufficient for signal-dependent activation of otherwise unresponsive genes in these cells. Our results uncover OCT4 as an integral and necessary component of signal-regulated transcriptional processes required for tissue-specific responses.
CTCs are a promising alternative for metastatic tissue biopsies for use in precision medicine approaches. We investigated to what extent the molecular characteristics of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) resemble the liver metastasis and/or the primary tumor from patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC).
The CTC profiles were concordant with the liver metastasis in 17/23 patients (74%) and with the primary tumor in 13 patients (57%). The CTCs better resembled the liver metastasis in 13 patients (57%), and the primary tumor in five patients (22%). The strength of the correlations was not associated with clinical parameters. Nine genes (CDH1, CDH17, CDX1, CEACAM5, FABP1, FCGBP, IGFBP3, IGFBP4, and MAPT) displayed significant differential expressions, all of which were downregulated, in CTCs compared to the tissues in the 23 patients.
Patients were retrospectively selected from a prospective study. Using the CellSearch System, CTCs were enumerated and isolated just prior to liver metastasectomy. A panel of 25 CTC-specific genes was measured by RT-qPCR in matching CTCs, primary tumors, and liver metastases. Spearman correlation coefficients were calculated and considered as continuous variables with r=1 representing absolute concordance and r=-1 representing absolute discordance. A cut-off of r&gt;0.1 was applied in order to consider profiles to be concordant.
In the majority of the patients, CTCs reflected the molecular characteristics of metastatic cells better than the primary tumors. Genes involved in cell adhesion and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition were downregulated in the CTCs. Our results support the use of CTC characterization as a liquid biopsy for precision medicine.
Genetic analysis in the IL10-deficient mouse model revealed a modifier locus of experimental inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) on chromosome 18, with the allele of the strain C3H/HeJBir (C3Bir) conferring resistance and the allele of C57BL/6J (B6) conferring susceptibility. Differential Cd14 expression was associated with this background specific susceptibility to intestinal inflammation. Polymorphisms of the Cd14 promoter were found to be likely causative for strain specific expression, and Cd14-knockout mice revealed a protective role of this gene-product in experimental IBD. In this study, luciferase reporter assays confirmed an increased activity of the C3Bir derived Cd14 promoter compared to the one of B6. Promoter truncation experiments and site-directed mutagenesis in both strains resulted in reduced Cd14 promoter activity and confirmed that a central AP1 and the proximal SP1 transcription factor binding sites mediated the basal activity of the Cd14 promoter in the mouse. Moreover, a T to C exchange at position -259 replaced putative STAT1 and CDX1 sites in the Cd14 promoter from B6 by a SP2 site in C3Bir. Ablation of the Sp2 site through truncation was associated with a decreased promoter activity. Site-directed mutagenesis also demonstrated that the inactivation of SP2 led to a substantial loss of promoter activity in C3Bir. Performing electrophoretic mobility shift and supershift assays demonstrated interaction of SP2 with its potential binding site. In addition, retroviral-mediated overexpression of the SP2 transcription factor in primary bone marrow macrophages derived from C3Bir mice caused a significant increase in Cd14 transcription. These data characterized SP2 as important factor responsible for higher Cd14 expression and reduced IBD susceptibility mediated by the C3Bir allele.
Previously, we reported differential expression of Presenilin (PS)1 and 2 and epigenetic modifications of their gene promoter in the cerebral cortex of mice during development. We identified the crucial role of DNA methylation and H3K9/14 acetylation in stage specific PS expression during brain development. Interestingly, we noted differential DNA methylation in putative binding sites of transcription factors considered pivotal for brain development. This prompted us to study the binding of transcription factors to cis-acting elements of PS1 and PS2 promoter in the cerebral cortex of mice during development. In-silico analysis revealed various cis-acting elements of PS1 and PS2 promoter and their putative transcription factors. We selected those cis-acting elements that were proven by wet lab experiments to interact with the transcription factors crucial for brain development. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay revealed that the binding of nuclear proteins to PS1 promoter cis-acting elements like HSF-1, Cdx1, Ets-1 and Sp1 significantly increased at embryonic day (E) 12.5, postnatal day (P) 45 and 20 weeks (w) as compared to P0. The binding pattern of these factors correlated well with the PS1 expression profile, indicating their cumulative influence on PS1 gene transcription. For PS2 promoter, the binding of Nkx2.2 and HFH-2 was high at prenatal stages (E12.5 and E18.5) while that of Cdx1 and NF-κB was maximum at postnatal stages (P45 and 20w). Taken together, our study shows that the binding of HSF-1, Cdx1, Ets-1 and Sp1 to PS1 promoter and that of Nkx2.2, HFH-2, Cdx1 and NF-κB to PS2 promoter regulate their differential expression during brain development.
Embryotoxic responses are critically dependent on the timing of exposure during embryo development. Here, we examined the time- dependent developmental effects in rat embryos exposed to flusilazole (FLU), and their link to retinoic acid (RA) mediated pathways. To this end, we assessed the effects of 4h exposure of rat embryos in vitro to 300μM FLU during four developmental time windows (0-4, 4-8, 24-28 and 44-48h), evaluating morphological parameters, expression and localization of five genes directly or indirectly linked with the RA pathway. These were RA- (Cyp26a1 and Dhrs3), differentiation- (Gbx2 and Cdx1) and sterol biosynthesis- (Cyp51) related genes. Extended exposure for 48h to 300μM FLU resulted in morphological changes, typical for triazoles and RA, while the 4h exposure times did not. Time dependent significant upregulation of the five selected genes was observed. These results corroborate that the embryotoxic responses to FLU are correlated with the regulation of the RA pathway. Thus, these gene expression markers can be considered early biomarkers of FLU-induced potential developmental toxicity later in the development.
Background. The objectives of this study were to determine the spatiotemporal distribution of human caudal-type homeobox proteins CDX1, CDX2 and CDX4 during development of the hindgut and anorectum in the embryo and to explore the possible roles of CDX genes during morphogenesis of the hindgut and anorectum. Methods. Embryos (89) were cut into sections serially and sagittally. From gestation weeks 4-9, CDX1, CDX2 and CDX4 proteins were detected on the caudal midline by immunohistochemical staining. Results. During week 4, extensive immunoreactivity of CDX1, CDX2 and CDX4 was detected in the dorsal urorectal septum, urogenital sinus and hindgut. From weeks 5-7, CDX1-, CDX2- and CDX4- positive cells were detected mainly in the mesenchyme of the urorectal septum and hindgut. The levels of CDX2 and CDX4 immunoreactivity were lower compared to CDX1. During weeks 8 and 9, the anorectal epithelium stained positive for CDX1 and CDX4, and the anal epithelium was positive for CDX2. Conclusions. The CDX proteins are constantly distributed during development of the hindgut and anorectum and exhibit overlapping distribution patterns in the cloaca/hindgut, suggesting they are important in the morphogenesis of the human hindgut and anorectum. CDX genes might be involved in development of the anorectal epithelium after the rectum has separated from the urorectal septum. 
Numerous studies in chordates and arthropods currently indicate that Cdx proteins have a major ancestral role in the organization of post-head tissues. In urochordate embryos, Cdx loss-of-function has been shown to impair axial elongation, neural tube (NT) closure and pigment cell development. Intriguingly, in contrast to axial elongation and NT closure, a Cdx role in neural crest (NC)-derived melanocyte/pigment cell development has not been reported in any other chordate species. To address this, we generated a new conditional pan-Cdx functional knockdown mouse model that circumvents Cdx functional redundancy as well as the early embryonic lethality of Cdx mutants. Through directed inhibition in the neuroectoderm, we provide in vivo evidence that murine Cdx proteins impact melanocyte and enteric nervous system development by, at least in part, directly controlling the expression of the key early regulators of NC ontogenesis Pax3,Msx1 and Foxd3 Our work thus reveals a novel role for Cdx proteins at the top of the trunk NC gene regulatory network in the mouse, which appears to have been inherited from their ancestral ortholog.
This study aimed to determine the spatiotemporal expression of caudal-type homeobox genes (CDX1, CDX2 and CDX4) during development of the midgut in human embryos and to explore the possible roles of CDX genes during the morphogenesis of human midgut. Human embryos (n=28) were sectioned serially and sagittally and CDX1, CDX2 and CDX4 proteins were detected on the midline from the 5th to 9th weeks of gestation by immunohistochemical staining.
CDX1, CDX2 and CDX4 proteins were weakly expressed in epithelium and mesenchyme of the midgut in the 6th and 7th weeks of gestation and reached estimated optimal level on the 8th and 9th weeks of gestation. In the 9th week of gestation, immunoreactivities specific to CDX1, CDX2 and CDX4 were restricted in epithelium of the midgut.
CDX1, CDX2 and CDX4 proteins began to express in human midgut in the 6th week of gestation. From the 6th to 9th week of gastation, the expression of CDX1, CDX2 and CDX4 proteins gradually increase and exhibited overlapping expression patterns, suggesting that CDX genes may be involved in early development of the epithelium of human midgut. Cross-regulatory interactions may exist among CDX genes with respect to human midgut development.
Helicobacter pylori induces chronic inflammation and intestinal metaplasia (IM) through genetic and epigenetic changes and activation of intracellular signaling pathways that contribute to gastric carcinogenesis. However, the precise mechanism of IM in gastric carcinogenesis has not been fully elucidated. We previously found that intestine-specific homeobox (ISX) mRNA expression increased in organoids cultured from Helicobacter-infected mouse mucosa. In this study, we elucidate the role of ISX in the development of IM and gastric carcinogenesis.
ISX expression was assessed in Helicobacter-infected mouse and human gastric mucosa. MKN45 gastric cancer cells were co-cultured with H. pylori to determine whether Helicobacter infection induced ISX expression. We established stable MKN45 transfected cells expressing ISX (Stable-ISX MKN45) and performed a spheroid colony formation assay and a xenograft model. We performed ISX immunohistochemistry in cancer and adjacent gastric tissues.
ISX expression was increased in mouse and human gastric mucosa infected with Helicobacter. The presence of IM and H. pylori infection in human stomach was correlated with ISX expression. H. pylori induced ISX mRNA and protein expression. CDX1/2, cyclinD1, and MUC2 were upregulated in Stable-ISX MKN45, whereas MUC5AC was downregulated. Stable-ISX MKN45 cells formed more spheroid colonies, and had high tumorigenic ability. ISX expression in gastric cancer and adjacent mucosa were correlated.
ISX expression induced by H. pylori infection may lead to IM and hyperproliferation of gastric mucosa through CDX1/2 and cyclinD1 expression, contributing to gastric carcinogenesis.
Changes in CDX1/CDX2 in gastric mucosae following Helicobacter pylori eradication have not been clarified yet.
To evaluate the changes in CDX1/CDX2 expression after H. pylori eradication, in relation to the reversibility of intestinal metaplasia (IM).
Time course of CDX1/CDX2 expressions was investigated in 176 subjects with various gastroduodenal disorders. Among them, 132 patients were H. pylori positives; H. pylori were eradicated in 107 of them; 13 failed to eradicate; and 12 did not receive H. pylori eradication therapy. Forty-four subjects were H. pylori negatives. Expression levels in CDX1 and CDX2 from noncancerous gastric mucosae of the corpus, as well as the histologic findings of gastric mucosae, were evaluated during the follow-up.
Average follow-up duration was 33.7 months (range 2-97 months). Expression levels in both CDX1 and CDX2 mRNAs were correlated with IM grade in the corpus (ρ = 0.633 and 0.554, respectively, all P &lt; 0.001). Changes in CDX1/CDX2 mRNA expressions following H. pylori eradication showed only insignificant results; IM grade at the antrum and corpus showed a tendency to decrease after H. pylori eradication without statistical significance (P &gt; 0.05). However, histologic improvement of IM at the corpus was associated with a decrease in CDX2 mRNA expression during the follow-up (linear mixed model, P for slope = 0.015).
In this study, eradication of H. pylori did not show any beneficial effects on aberrant CDX1/CDX2 expressions or IM. Reversibility of IM may be associated with a decrease in CDX2 mRNA expression.
The importance of Helicobacter pylori eradication after endoscopic resection (ER) of gastric neoplasms remains controversial. In this study, we clarified the importance of H. pylori eradication for metachronous lesions after ER.
This study included 3,882 patients with gastric neoplasms who underwent ER. We included patients infected with H. pylori who received eradication therapy. Among them, 34 patients with metachronous lesions after ER and 102 age- and sex-matched patients (nonmetachronous group) were enrolled. Background mucosal pathologies such as atrophy and intestinal metaplasia (IM) were evaluated endoscopically. The expression levels of CDX1, CDX2, Sonic hedgehog (SHH), and SOX2 were evaluated based on H. pylori eradication and the development of metachronous lesions.
The eradication failure rate was higher in the metachronous group than in the nonmetachronous group (P=0.036). Open-type atrophy (P=0.003) and moderate-to-severe IM (P=0.001) occurred more frequently in the metachronous group. In patients with an initial diagnosis of dysplasia, the eradication failure rate was higher in the metachronous group than in the nonmetachronous group (P=0.002). In addition, open-type atrophy was more frequent in the metachronous group (P=0.047). In patients with an initial diagnosis of carcinoma, moderate-to-severe IM occurred more frequently in the metachronous group (P=0.003); however, the eradication failure rate was not significantly different between the two groups. SHH and SOX2 expression was increased, and CDX2 expression was decreased in the nonmetachronous group after eradication (P&lt;0.05).
Open-type atrophy, moderate-to-severe IM, and H. pylori eradication failure were significantly associated with metachronous lesions. However, eradication failure was significantly associated with dysplasia, but not carcinoma, in the metachronous group. Thus, H. pylori eradication may play an important role in preventing metachronous lesions after ER for precancerous lesions before carcinomatous transformation.
Cardiac induction requires stepwise integration of BMP and WNT pathway activity. Human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) are developmentally and clinically relevant for studying the poorly understood molecular mechanisms downstream of these cascades. We show that BMP and WNT signaling drive cardiac specification by removing sequential roadblocks that otherwise redirect hESC differentiation toward competing fates, rather than activating a cardiac program per se. First, BMP and WNT signals pattern mesendoderm through cooperative repression of SOX2, a potent mesoderm antagonist. BMP signaling promotes miRNA-877 maturation to induce SOX2 mRNA degradation, while WNT-driven EOMES induction transcriptionally represses SOX2. Following mesoderm formation, cardiac differentiation requires inhibition of WNT activity. We found that WNT inhibition serves to restrict expression of anti-cardiac regulators MSX1 and CDX2/1. Conversely, their simultaneous disruption partially abrogates the requirement for WNT inactivation. These results suggest that human cardiac induction depends on multi-stage repression of alternate lineages, with implications for deriving expandable cardiac stem cells.
Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is the leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide. Previous studies have suggested that DNA methylation involved in the development of ESCC. However, the precise mechanisms underlying the regulation and maintenance of the methylome as well as their relationship with ESCC remain poorly understood. Herein, we used methylated DNA immunoprecipitation sequencing (MeDIP-Seq) and RNA-Seq to investigate whole-genome DNA methylation patterns and the genome expression profiles in ESCC samples. The results of MeDIP-Seq analyses identified differentially methylated regions (DMRs) covering almost the entire genome with sufficient depth and high resolution. The gene ontology (GO) analysis showed that the DMRs related genes belonged to several different ontological domains, such as cell cycle, adhesion, proliferation and apoptosis. The RNA-Seq analysis identified a total of 6150 differentially expressed genes (3423 up-regulated and 2727 down-regulated). The significant GO terms showed that these genes belonged to several molecular functions and biological pathways. Moreover, the bisulfite-sequencing of genes MLH1, CDH5, TWIST1 and CDX1 confirmed the methylation status identified by MeDIP-Seq. And the mRNA expression levels of MLH1, TWIST1 and CDX1 were consistent with their DNA methylation profiles. The DMR region of MLH1 was found to correlate with survival. The identification of whole-genome DNA methylation patterns and gene expression profiles in ESCC provides new insight into the carcinogenesis of ESCC and represents a promising avenue through which to investigate novel therapeutic targets.
TThe molecular mechanisms responsible for the development of hepatic fibrosis are not fully understood. The Nlrc4 inflammasome detects cytosolic presence of bacterial components, activating inflammatory cytokines to facilitate clearance of pathogens and infected cells. We hypothesized that low-grade constitutive activation of the Nlrc4 inflammasome may lead to induced hepatocyte proliferation and prevent the development of hepatic fibrosis. The gene of Nlrc4 contains two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), one located within the Nlrc4 promoter and one contained within exon 5. These SNPs regulate Nlrc4 gene transcription and activation as measured through gene reporter assays and IL-1β secretion. The 17C-6 mice have increased IL-1β in plasma after chronic carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) administration compared to B6 mice. After two-thirds partial hepatectomy (2/3PH) 17C-6 mice have earlier restoration of liver mass with greater cyclin D1 protein and BrdU incorporation compared to B6 mice at several time points. These data reveal mild constitutive activation of the Nlrc4 inflammasome as the results of two SNPs, which leads to the stimulation of hepatocyte proliferation. The increased liver regeneration induces rapid liver mass recovery after hepatectomy and may prevent the development of hepatotoxin-induced liver fibrosis.
Various cancers such as colorectal cancer (CRC) are associated with alterations in protein glycosylation. CRC cell lines are frequently used to study these (glyco)biological changes and their mechanisms. However, differences between CRC cell lines with regard to their glycosylation have hitherto been largely neglected. Here, we comprehensively characterized the N-glycan profiles of 25 different CRC cell lines, derived from primary tumors and metastatic sites, in order to investigate their potential as glycobiological tumor model systems and to reveal glycans associated with cell line phenotypes. We applied an optimized, high-throughput membrane-based enzymatic glycan release for small sample amounts. Released glycans were derivatized to stabilize and differentiate between α2,3- and α2,6-linked N-acetylneuraminic acids, followed by N-glycosylation analysis by MALDI-TOF(/TOF)-MS. Our results showed pronounced differences between the N-glycosylation patterns of CRC cell lines. CRC cell line profiles differed from tissue-derived N-glycan profiles with regard to their high-mannose N-glycan content but showed a large overlap for complex type N-glycans, supporting their use as a glycobiological cancer model system. Importantly, we could show that the high-mannose N-glycans did not only occur as intracellular precursors but were also present at the cell surface. The obtained CRC cell line N-glycan features were not clearly correlated with mRNA expression levels of glycosyltransferases, demonstrating the usefulness of performing the structural analysis of glycans. Finally, correlation of CRC cell line glycosylation features with cancer cell markers and phenotypes revealed an association between highly fucosylated glycans and CDX1 and/or villin mRNA expression that both correlate with cell differentiation. Together, our findings provide new insights into CRC-associated glycan changes and setting the basis for more in-depth experiments on glycan function and regulation. 
The caudal-related homeobox protein 1 (CDX1) is a transcription factor, which is important in the development, differentiation, and homeostasis of the gut. Although the involvement of CDX genes in the regulation of the expression levels of a few glycosyltransferases has been shown, associations between glycosylation phenotypes and CDX1 mRNA expression have hitherto not been well studied. Triggered by our previous study, we here characterized the N-glycomic phenotype of 16 colon cancer cell lines, selected for their differential CDX1 mRNA expression levels. We found that high CDX1 mRNA expression associated with a higher degree of multi-fucosylation on N-glycans, which is in line with our previous results and was supported by up-regulated gene expression of fucosyltransferases involved in antenna fucosylation. Interestingly, hepatocyte nuclear factors (HNF)4A and HNF1A were, among others, positively associated with high CDX1 mRNA expression and have been previously proven to regulate antenna fucosylation. Besides fucosylation, we found that high CDX1 mRNA expression in cancer cell lines also associated with low levels of sialylation and galactosylation and high levels of bisection on N-glycans. Altogether, our data highlight a possible role of CDX1 in altering the N-glycosylation of colorectal cancer cells, which is a hallmark of tumor development.
Alzheimer's disease (AD), characterized by memory loss, cognitive decline, and dementia, is a progressive neurodegenerative disease. Although the long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have recently been identified to play a role in the pathogenesis of AD, the specific effects of lncRNAs in AD remain unclear. In present study, we have investigated the expression profiles of lncRNAs in hippocampal of intranasal LPS-mediated Alzheimer's disease models in mice by microarray method. A total of 395 lncRNAs and 123 mRNAs was detected to express differently in AD models and controls (&gt;2.0 folds, p&lt;0.05). The microarray expression was validated by Quantitative Real-Time-PCR (qRT-PCR). The pathway analysis showed the mRNAs that correlated with lncRNAs were involved in inflammation, apoptosis, and nervous system related pathways. The lncRNA-TFs network analysis suggested the lncRNAs were mostly regulated by HMGA2, ONECUT2, FOXO1, and CDC5L. Additionally, lncRNA-target-TFs network analysis indicated the FOXL1, CDC5L, ONECUT2, and CDX1 to be the TFs most likely to regulate the production of these lncRNAs. This is the first study to investigate lncRNAs expression pattern in intranasal LPS-mediated Alzheimer's disease model in mice. And these results may facilitate the understanding of the pathogenesis of AD targeting lncRNAs.
Chronic exposure to inorganic arsenic (As)-As(III) + As(V)-is associated with type 2 diabetes, vascular diseases and various types of cancer. Although the oral route is the main way of exposure to inorganic As, the adverse gastrointestinal effects produced by chronic exposure are not well documented. The aim of the present study is to evaluate the effect of chronic exposure to As(III) on the intestinal epithelium. For this purpose, NCM460 cells, non-transformed epithelial cells from the human colon, were exposed to As(III) (0.01-0.2 mg/L) for 6 months and monitored for acquisition of a tumor-like phenotype. Secretion of matrix metalloproteinases, histone modifications (H3 acetylation), hyperproliferation capacity, formation of floating spheres, anchorage-independent growth, release of cytokine interleukin-8 and expression of relevant genes in colon tumorigenesis were assessed. The results show a maintained proinflammatory response from the beginning, with an increase in interleukin-8 secretion (≤570%). Downregulation of CDX1 and CDX2 was also observed. After 14 weeks of exposure, cells presented marked increases in matrix metalloproteinase-2 secretion and histone modifications. As(III)-treated cells were hyperproliferative, grew in low-serum media and were able to form free-floating spheres. Overall, these data suggest that exposure of human colon epithelial cells to As(III) facilitates acquisition of transformed cell characteristics.
Recurrent miscarriage (RM) is currently defined as two or more losses of a clinically established intrauterine pregnancy. Despite years of research, RM continues to be a clinically frustrating challenge for patients and physicians, and its etiology remains poorly understood. Accumulating evidence has suggested that epigenetic modifications are involved in early embryogenesis, and defects in epigenetic patterning contribute to the development of RM. Here, we studied the role of enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) in the pathogenesis of RM and found that the EZH2 expression was significantly decreased in the villi from women with RM compared with that in control villi. EZH2 promoted the invasion of trophoblast cells. Moreover, EZH2 could promote epithelial-mesenchymal transition by epigenetically silencing CDX1. Both chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-PCR and dual-luciferase report assays demonstrated that EZH2 repressed CDX1 transcription via direct binding to its promoter region and then trimethylating Histone3-Lysine27. Furthermore, we discovered that progesterone, which is used extensively in the treatment of miscarriage and RM, increased the expression of EZH2 via the extracellular signaling-regulated kinase (ERK1/2) pathway. These findings revealed that EZH2 may regulate trophoblast invasion as an epigenetic factor, suggesting that EZH2 might be a potential therapeutic target for RM.
Gastric cancer is among the commonplace causes of cancer death worldwide. Sonic hedgehog (Shh) signaling is an important pathway which may be dysregulated in many cancers.CDX1/2, and KLF5are key transcription factors involved in Shh pathway and cancer stem cells. The aim of this study was to investigate the expression and epigenetic alterations of these genes in gastric cancer patients. DNA methylation's modifications of CDX1, KLF5 and CDX2 genes alongside with the expressions of these genes in gastric cancer tissues and their non-tumoral counterparts (margin tissues) were analyzed using methylation specific sequencing, and Real time PCR Taq man assays, respectively. The expression of CDX1 (P = 0.002) and KLF5 (P = 0.010) were decreased significantly, but it was considerably increased for CDX2 (P = 0.001). Relatively, the results for the regulatory region methylation status of each CpG site had shown a notable fluctuation in these genes with no significant difference in most places. The creation of metastatic lymph nodes in patients was significantly associated with increased expression of CDX2 gene. The modifications of these genes expression can be considered as a cancer biomarker in future studies. Methylation of the investigated genes is not the main mechanism of gastric cancer development.
The origin of extracellular digestion in metazoans was accompanied by structural and physiological alterations of the gut. These adaptations culminated in the differentiation of a novel digestive structure in jawed vertebrates, the stomach. Specific endoderm/mesenchyme signalling is required for stomach differentiation, involving the growth and transcription factors: 1) Shh and Bmp4, required for stomach outgrowth; 2) Barx1, Sfrps and Sox2, required for gastric epithelium development and 3) Cdx1 and Cdx2, involved in intestinal versus gastric identity. Thus, modulation of endoderm/mesenchyme signalling emerges as a plausible mechanism linked to the origin of the stomach. In order to gain insight into the ancient mechanisms capable of generating this structure in jawed vertebrates, we characterised the development of the gut in the catshark Scyliorhinus canicula. As chondrichthyans, these animals retained plesiomorphic features of jawed vertebrates, including a well-differentiated stomach. We identified a clear molecular regionalization of their embryonic gut, characterised by the expression of barx1 and sox2 in the prospective stomach region and expression of cdx1 and cdx2 in the prospective intestine. Furthermore, we show that gastric gland development occurs close to hatching, accompanied by the onset of gastric proton pump activity. Our findings favour a scenario in which the developmental mechanisms involved in the origin of the stomach were present in the common ancestor of chondrichthyans and osteichthyans.
Mouse Hox gene enhancer elements have typically been identified and characterized using Hox/lacZ transgenic mouse embryos. Such studies have, for example, identified Cdx responsive binding motifs in the enhancers of Hoxb8 and Hoxa7. Production of transgenic mouse embryos involves issues of cost, welfare, and considerable technical skill. It would be of benefit if these studies could be performed, or advanced, in cell culture. It is shown here that Cdx1 activation of mouse Hoxb4, b8 and a7 embryo-active enhancers can be detected using a HepG2 cell culture model system. The technique employed uses co-transfection of an inducible Cdx1 expression construct together with a Hox enhancer/luciferase reporter construct. Cultures to be compared receive identical DNAs and differ only in whether or not they also receive inducer (doxycycline). Response of all three Hox enhancers to Cdx1 protein is inhibited by mutation of Cdx binding motifs which are conserved in sequence from fish or Xenopus to mammals. The magnitude of transfected chick Hoxa7 activation by Cdx1 is increased by multiple copies of its enhancer, but for maximum effect these must contain intact Cdx binding motifs. Cdx1 protein was found not to activate Hoxb4, b8 or a7 enhancers in P19 mouse pluripotential cells.
Background: Barrett’s oesophagus (BO) is a pre-malignant condition in which normal squamous epithelium of the
lower oesophagus and gastresophageal junction is replaced by columnar cells and progress to oesophageal adenocarcinoma.
The increase burden of oesophagus cancer morbidity and mortality worldwide make study of factors involved in the
pathogenesis of BO essential. However, most of studies that examine the environmental risk factors associated with
increased incidence and prevalence of BO have largely ignored the potential role of bacteria in disease aetiology.
Aims: This study examined the role of Campylobacter concisus isolated from Barrett’s and adenocarcinoma
patient samples as one of possible environmental factors in the progression of Barrett’s oesophagus to oesophagus
adenocarcinoma. Methods: We focused on the effect of C. concisus on the expression caudal type homeobox 1 gene
(CDX1) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) in three BO cell lines using quantitative real-time PCR. In addition, the
attachment and invasion characteristics of C. concisus were also tested. Results: Results showed that C. concisus had a
strong attachment to the cell lines and induce the expression of CDX1 in Barrett’s cell lines in a time-dependent manner.
Conclusion: Findings indicate that C. concisus could be as a new challenge in the progression of BO to adenocarcinoma.
Intestinal metaplasia induced by ectopic expression of caudal-type homeobox (CDX)2 and/or CDX1 (CDX) is frequently observed around gastric cancer (GC). Abnormal expression of CDX is also observed in GC and suggests that inappropriate gastrointestinal differentiation plays essential roles in gastric tumorigenesis, but their roles on tumorigenesis remain unelucidated. Publicly available databases show that GC patients with higher CDX expression have significantly better clinical outcomes. We introduced CDX2 and CDX1 genes separately into GC-originated MKN7 and TMK1 cells deficient in CDX. Marked suppression of cell growth and dramatic morphological change into spindle-shaped flat form were observed along with induction of intestinal marker genes. G0-G1 growth arrest was accompanied by changed expression of cell cycle-related genes but not with apoptosis or senescence. Microarray analyses additionally showed decreased expression of gastric marker genes and increased expression of stemness-associated genes. Hierarchical clustering of 111 GC tissues and 21 non-cancerous gastric tissues by selected 18 signature genes based on our transcriptome analyses clearly categorized the 132 tissues into non-cancer, "CDX signature"-positive GC, and "CDX signature"-negative GC. Gene set enrichment analysis indicated that "CDX signature"-positive GC has lower malignant features. Immunohistochemistry of 89 GC specimens showed that 50.6% were CDX2-deficient, 66.3% were CDX1-deficient, and 44.9% were concomitant CDX2/CDX1-deficient, suggesting that potentially targetable GC cases by induced intestinal differentiation are quite common. In conclusion, exogenous expression of CDX2/CDX1 can lead to efficient growth inhibition of CDX-deficient GC cells. It is based on rapidly induced intestinal differentiation, which may be a future therapeutic strategy.
Recent studies have suggested that environmental enteric dysfunction can be assessed in rural African children by measuring levels of fecal mRNA transcripts. The field collection of fecal samples is less invasive and cumbersome than administration of the lactulose:mannitol test, which is typically used to assess environmental enteric dysfunction. This study sought to determine if, as in children aged 12-60 months, an array of seven fecal host transcripts (CD53, CDX1, HLA-DRA, TNF, S100A8, MUC12, and REG1A) could predict environmental enteric dysfunction in rural African infants. Host fecal transcript abundance was correlated to the percentage of lactulose (%L) excreted in the urine for 340 samples from Malawian children aged 6-12 months. Permeability was categorized as not severe (%L &lt; 0.45) and severe (%L ≥ 0.45). This study found the prevalence of severe environmental enteric dysfunction to be 114/834 (14%), lower than what was previously reported for 12-60 months old children, 595/1521 (39%, P = 0.001). In linear regression analysis with the seven host transcripts, two were associated with %L: β coefficients of -1.843 ( P = 0.035) and 0.215 ( P = 0.006) for CDX1 and REG1A, respectively. The seven fecal host transcripts in a random forest model did not predict severe environmental enteric dysfunction. Future models utilizing different transcripts identified from an untargeted, agnostic assessment of all potential host transcripts could provide accurate predictions of environmental enteric dysfunction in infants. Impact statement Environmental enteric dysfunction (EED) is associated with reduced linear growth. The dual sugar absorption test has been used as a non-invasive method to determine the gut health of individuals. Alternative methods using fecal host mRNAs as predictors of the gut health are promising. In older children, we have determined that seven transcripts can predict the gut health in a random forest model. Our current study determined that the host fecal mRNA is abundant in infants and toddlers alike. Severe EED in rural Malawian children is less prevalent in infants than in young children. REG1A and CDX1 are associated with gut health. Fecal host mRNA may well be a means to assess gut health in African infants, but the panel of transcripts used to do this will differ from that in older children.
Genetic alterations and epigenetic modifications are two main factors involved in gastric carcinogenesis, progression, and metastasis. Several miRNAs such as miRNA-9 and miRNA-326 may play important role in gastric cancer by targeting the 3'UTR of the caudal type homeobox (CDX) 1 and 2 mRNA respectively. The use of herbal medicines has been widely considered in the treatment of cancers such as gastric cancer. Sulforaphane extracted from broccoli may indirectly prevent cancer through affecting different signaling pathways. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of different concentrations of sulforaphane extracted from broccoli sprout (SEBS) on viability, death pattern, and expression alterations of CDX1/2 as well as miRNA-9 and miRNA-326 in normal (HF2FF) and gastric cancer cell lines.
Two gastric cancer cell lines (AGS and MKN45) and HF2FF normal cell line were cultured and treated with different concentrations (31.25, 62.5, 125, and 250 μg/ml) of the purified sulforaphane. Expression levels of CDX1 and CDX2 as well as miRNA-9 and miRNA-326, and mechanisms leading to cell death were assessed by Taqman real time PCR assay and flow cytometry, respectively.
Significant dose-dependent and anti-proliferative effects of the SEBS were observed on AGS and MKN45 cells after 48 h with an IC50 value of about 112 and 125 μg/ml, respectively (P &lt; 0.001). Apoptotic cells were observed in AGS and MKN45 cells but not HF2FF after 48 h of treatment with SEBS. Furthermore, significant changes in expression of CDX1, CDX2, miR-9 and miR-326 in the gastric cancer lines (AGS and MKN45), were observed under different concentrations of SEBS.
Our present study suggests that the SEBS may influence gastric cancer cell lines at specific doses and change their proliferation rate by altering the expression of CDX1, CDX2, miR-9, and miR-326.
Sporadic nonampullary duodenal epithelial tumors (NADETs) are uncommon, and thus their clinicopathological features have not been fully assessed.
In this study, we have analyzed a series of early sporadic NADETs, focusing on various immunohistological features.
We conducted a multicenter retrospective analysis of 68 patients with endoscopically resected sporadic NADETs. Associations between immunohistological features and clinicopathological features were statistically analyzed.
The 68 patients consisted of 46 men (68%) and 22 women (32%) with a mean age of 60.7 ± 12.2 years (range 37-85 years). The 68 tumors were composed of 39 adenomas (57%) and 29 early-stage adenocarcinomas (43%). Duodenal adenocarcinomas were larger in size than adenomas and had papillary architecture in their pathological diagnosis with statistical significance. Duodenal adenocarcinomas also demonstrated a significantly higher expression of gastric markers (MUC5AC and MUC6) and a higher MIB-1 index. Duodenal adenomas were contrastively apt to express intestinal markers (MUC2, CDX1 and CDX2). Of the 68 cases analyzed, there were only 3 tumors positive for p53 staining, all of which were adenocarcinoma. When 7 submucosal invasive cancers and 21 intramucosal cancers were compared, submucosal invasion was positively associated with expression of MUC5AC. Also, submucosal invasion showed strong association with double-positivity of MUC5AC and MUC6.
Our results indicate that immunohistochemical evaluation is useful for predicting malignant potential of NADETs, especially focusing on the expression of gastrointestinal markers.
Mesenchymal chondrosarcoma is a rare but deadly form of chondrosarcoma that typically affects adolescents and young adults. While curative intent is possible for patients with localized disease, few options exist for patients in the unresectable/metastatic setting. Thus, it is imperative to understand the fusion-driven biology of this rare malignant neoplasm so as to lead to the future development of better therapeutics for this disease. This manuscript will briefly review the clinical and pathologic features of mesenchymal chondrosarcoma followed by an appraisal of existing data linked to the fusions, HEY1-NCOA2 and IRF2BP2-CDX1, and the associated downstream pathways.
Adjuvant chemotherapy after surgery improves survival of patients with stage II-III, resectable gastric cancer. However, the overall survival benefit observed after adjuvant chemotherapy is moderate, suggesting that not all patients with resectable gastric cancer treated with adjuvant chemotherapy benefit from it. We aimed to develop and validate a predictive test for adjuvant chemotherapy response in patients with resectable, stage II-III gastric cancer.
In this multi-cohort, retrospective study, we developed through a multi-step strategy a predictive test consisting of two rule-based classifier algorithms with predictive value for adjuvant chemotherapy response and prognosis. Exploratory bioinformatics analyses identified biologically relevant candidate genes in gastric cancer transcriptome datasets. In the discovery analysis, a four-gene, real-time RT-PCR assay was developed and analytically validated in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumour tissues from an internal cohort of 307 patients with stage II-III gastric cancer treated at the Yonsei Cancer Center with D2 gastrectomy plus adjuvant fluorouracil-based chemotherapy (n=193) or surgery alone (n=114). The same internal cohort was used to evaluate the prognostic and chemotherapy response predictive value of the single patient classifier genes using associations with 5-year overall survival. The results were validated with a subset (n=625) of FFPE tumour samples from an independent cohort of patients treated in the CLASSIC trial (NCT00411229), who received D2 gastrectomy plus capecitabine and oxaliplatin chemotherapy (n=323) or surgery alone (n=302). The primary endpoint was 5-year overall survival.
We identified four classifier genes related to relevant gastric cancer features (GZMB, WARS, SFRP4, and CDX1) that formed the single patient classifier assay. In the validation cohort, the prognostic single patient classifier (based on the expression of GZMB, WARS, and SFRP4) identified 79 (13%) of 625 patients as low risk, 296 (47%) as intermediate risk, and 250 (40%) as high risk, and 5-year overall survival for these groups was 83·2% (95% CI 75·2-92·0), 74·8% (69·9-80·1), and 66·0% (60·1-72·4), respectively (p=0·012). The predictive single patient classifier (based on the expression of GZMB, WARS, and CDX1) assigned 281 (45%) of 625 patients in the validation cohort to the chemotherapy-benefit group and 344 (55%) to the no-benefit group. In the predicted chemotherapy-benefit group, 5-year overall survival was significantly improved in those patients who had received adjuvant chemotherapy after surgery compared with those who received surgery only (80% [95% CI 73·5-87·1] vs 64·5% [56·8-73·3]; univariate hazard ratio 0·47 [95% CI 0·30-0·75], p=0·0015), whereas no such improvement in 5-year overall survival was observed in the no-benefit group (72·9% [66·5-79·9] in patients who received chemotherapy plus surgery vs 72·5% [65·8-79·9] in patients who only had surgery; 0·93 [0·62-1·38], p=0·71). The predictive single patient classifier groups (chemotherapy benefit vs no-benefit) could predict adjuvant chemotherapy benefit in terms of 5-year overall survival in the validation cohort (pinteraction=0·036 in univariate analysis). Similar results were obtained in the internal evaluation cohort.
The single patient classifiers validated in this study provide clinically important prognostic information independent of standard risk-stratification methods and predicted chemotherapy response after surgery in two independent cohorts of patients with resectable, stage II-III gastric cancer. The single patient classifiers could complement TNM staging to optimise decision making in patients with resectable gastric cancer who are eligible for adjuvant chemotherapy after surgery. Further validation of these results in prospective studies is warranted.

Long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) is an important member of non-coding RNA family and emerging evidence has indicated that it plays a pivotal role in many physiological and pathological processes. The lncRNA X inactive specific transcript (XIST) is a potential tumour suppressor in some types of cancers. However, the expression and function of XIST in breast cancer remain largely unclear. The objective of this study was to evaluate the expression and biological role of XIST in breast cancer. The results showed that XIST was significantly down-regulated in breast cancer tissues and cell lines. Further functional analysis indicated that overexpression of XIST remarkably inhibited breast cancer cell growth, migration, and invasion. The results of luciferase reporter assays verified that miR-155 was a direct target of XIST in breast cancer. Moreover, caudal-type homeobox 1 (CDX1) was identified as a direct target of miR-155 and miR-155/CDX1 rescued the effects of XIST in breast cancer cells. Taken together, our results suggest that XIST is down-regulated in breast cancer and suppresses breast cancer cell growth, migration, and invasion via the miR-155/CDX1 axis.
The NanoString nCounter assay is a high-throughput hybridization technique using target-specific probes that can be customized to test for numerous fusion transcripts in a single assay using RNA from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded material. We designed a NanoString assay targeting 174 unique fusion junctions in 25 sarcoma types. The study cohort comprised 212 cases, 96 of which showed fusion gene expression by the NanoString assay, including all 20 Ewing sarcomas, 11 synovial sarcomas, and 5 myxoid liposarcomas tested. Among these 96 cases, 15 showed fusion expression not identified by standard clinical assay, including EWSR1-FLI1, EWSR1-ERG, BCOR-CCNB3, ZC3H7B-BCOR, HEY1-NCOA2, CIC-DUX4, COL1A1-PDGFB, MYH9-USP6, YAP1-TFE3, and IRF2BP2-CDX1 fusions. There were no false-positive results; however, four cases were false negative when compared with clinically available fluorescence in situ hybridization or RT-PCR testing. When batched as six cases, the per-sample reagent cost was less than conventional techniques, such as fluorescence in situ hybridization, with technologist hands-on time of 1.2 hours per case and assay time of 36 hours. In summary, the NanoString nCounter Sarcoma Fusion CodeSet reliably and cost-effectively identifies fusion genes in sarcomas using formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded material, including many fusions missed by standard clinical assays, and can serve as a first-line clinical diagnostic test for sarcoma fusion gene identification, replacing multiple individual clinical assays.
Anorectal malformation (ARM) is a common congenital anomaly with a wide clinical spectrum. Recently, many genetic and molecular studies have been conducted worldwide highlighting the contribution of genetic factors in its etiology. We summarize the current literature on such genetic factors.
Literature search was done using different combinations of terms related to genetics in anorectal malformations. From 2012 to June 2017, articles published in the English literature and studies conducted on human population were included.
A paradigm shift was observed from the earlier studies concentrating on genetic aberrations in specific pathways to genome wide arrays exploring single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and copy number variations (CNVs) in ARM patients. Rare CNVs (including 79 genes) and SNPs have been found to genetically contribute to ARM. Out of disrupted 79 genes one such putative gene is DKK4. Down regulation of CDX-1 gene has also been implicated in isolated ARM patients. In syndromic ARM de novo microdeletion at 17q12 and a few others have been identified.
Major genetic aberrations proposed in the pathogenesis of ARM affect members of the Wnt, Hox (homebox) genes, Sonic hedgehog (Shh) and Gli2, Bmp4, Fgf and CDX1 signalling pathways; probable targets of future molecular gene therapy.
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play important roles in the tumorigenesis of glioma. Recent studies showed that miR-155 expression was increased in types of cancer, including glioma. However, the underlying mechanism of miR-155 on glioma is still unclear. In the present study, expression of miR-155 and caudal-type homeobox 1 (CDX1) was determined in glioma tissues by qRT-PCR, and the regulatory axis was further studied in glioma cells. We showed that miR-155 expression was significantly increased in glioma tissues while CDX1 expression was decreased. Correlation analysis revealed that miR-155 was negatively correlated with CDX1 expression in glioma tissues. Moreover, Kaplan-Meier analysis indicated that patients with high miR-155 expression had a poor overall survival. In addition, our results showed that the translation of CDX1 expression could be suppressed by miR-155 mimics. And miR-155 mimics promoted glioma cell proliferation could be reversed by CDX1 overexpression. In vivo assay, we showed that miR-155 overexpression promoted the progress of tumor formation. Therefore, we suggested that miR-155 might promote glioma cell growth partially by targeting CDX1, which provided a novel therapeutic strategy for glioma patients.
Developing anatomy along the head-tail axis of bilaterian embryos is specified, to a large extent, by the overlapping patterns of expression of the Hox genes. Hox gene enhancers respond to a variety of signals in order to regulate these discreet domains of expression. For mouse Hoxc8, the 399bp "early enhancer" plays a major role. Activation of this enhancer is now examined using luciferase expression constructs transfected into HepG2 cells. Constructs are activated by the combined actions of Gdf11/Smad and Cdx protein signalling pathways, both of which are functional in early embryos. Each of these pathways alone has little stimulatory effect. Stimulation by the two pathways together exceeds the sum of the effects of each pathway alone, indicating synergistic activity. By mutation analysis, two Smad binding motifs are identified as mediators of the Gdf11 effect and two Cdx binding motifs mediate the Cdx effect. The two Smad motifs and one of the Cdx sites are conserved from fish to mammals. Gdf11 stimulation is partially inhibited by Specific Inhibitor of Smad3, suggesting that Smad3 plays a part in signal transduction. Fgf2 increases luciferase activation by the Hoxc8 enhancer, but not, apparently, by specific interactions with either Gdf11 or Cdx effects.
Gastric cancer is a world health problem and depicts the fourth leading mortality cause from malignancy in Mexico. Causation of gastric cancer is not only due to the combined effects of environmental factors and genetic variants. Recent molecular studies have transgressed a number of genes involved in gastric carcinogenesis. The aim of this review is to understand the recent basics of gene expression in the development of the process of gastric carcinogenesis. Genetic variants, polymorphisms, desoxyribonucleic acid methylation, and genes involved in mediating inflammation have been associated with the development of gastric carcinogenesis. Recently, these genes (interleukin 10, Il-17, mucin 1, β-catenin, CDX1, SMAD4, SERPINE1, hypoxia-inducible factor 1 subunit alpha, GSK3β, CDH17, matrix metalloproteinase 7, RUNX3, RASSF1A, TFF1, HAI-2, and COX-2) have been studied in association with oncogenic activation or inactivation of tumor suppressor genes. All these mechanisms have been investigated to elucidate the process of gastric carcinogenesis, as well as their potential use as biomarkers and/or molecular targets to treatment of disease.
Gene expression microarrays have identified many tumor markers and therapeutic targets for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). However, microarray profilings have limited sensitivity and are prone to cross-hybridization between homologous DNA fragments. Here, we perform a transcriptome analysis of paired tumor and adjacent benign pancreatic tissues from 10 patients who underwent resection for PDAC. We identify a total of 2736 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) with false discovery rate less than 0.05, including 1554 upregulated, 1182 downregulated, and 6 microRNAs (miR-614, miR-217, miR-27b, miR-4451, miR-3609, and miR-612). Overexpression of five DEGs, i.e. KRT16, HOXA10, CDX1, SI, and SERPINB5 in tumors is confirmed by RT-PCR in 20 additional tissues. Overexpression of KRT16 in PDAC is also verified on protein level. In addition, top canonical pathways such as granulocyte adhesion and diapedesis pathway have been identified. Our study represents a comprehensive characterization of the PDAC transcriptome and provides insight to the mechanisms of pancreatic carcinogenesis and potential biomarkers and novel therapeutic targets for pancreatic cancer.
Hypermethylation of CpG islands in the promoter region of tumor suppressor genes (TSGs) and their subsequent silencing is thought to be one of the main mechanisms of carcinogenesis. MBD2b enrichment coupled with a NimbleGen array was applied to examine the genome-wide CpG island methylation profile of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Hypermethylated DNA of 58 pairs of HCC and adjacent tissue samples was enriched and hybridized in the same array. Aberrant hypermethylated peaks of HCC and adjacent tissues were screened and annotated after data processing using NimbleScan2.5 and our newly developed Weighting and Scoring (WAS) method, respectively. Validation using bisulfite sequencing of randomly selected ANKRD45, APC, CDX1, HOXD3, PTGER and TUBB6 genes demonstrated significant hypermethylation modification in HCC samples, consistent with the array data.
CDX2 is widely used as a sensitive and specific immunomarker for colorectal carcinoma (CRC), but neither its sensitivity nor its specificity is absolute. The aim of this study was to compare CDX1 and A33 with CDX2 as immunomarkers for CRC.
As a pilot study, whole sections of 51 cases of liver metastatic carcinoma with different origins-colorectum (n = 32), breast (n = 3), oesophagogastric tract (n = 4), lung (n = 3), pancreas (n = 8), and prostate (n = 1)-were immunostained with CDX1, CDX2, and A33. A33 showed higher sensitivity as a CRC immunomarker, greater interobserver reproducibility for assessment of expression and less background cross-reactivity than CDX1. Therefore, only A33 was compared with CDX2 for a tissue microarray (TMA)-based study of primary adenocarcinomas with different origins: CRC (n = 55), liver deposits of metastatic CRC (n = 60), breast (n = 101), lung (n = 40), oesophagogastric tract (n = 134), ovary (n = 67), pancreas (n = 77), and prostate (n = 56). When the whole section and TMA cases of CRC were combined, A33 had a sensitivity of 95.9% and CDX2 had a sensitivity of 97.2%. When the whole section and TMA cases of non-colorectal carcinomas were combined, A33 had a specificity of 85.4% as a marker of CRC and CDX2 had a specificity of 64.3%. The higher specificity of A33 than of CDX2 as a CRC immunomarker was particularly seen among pancreatic and ovarian carcinomas. Furthermore, unlike what was seen with CDX2, none of the prostatic and lung carcinomas studied showed A33 positivity.
A33 shows similar sensitivity to but is more specific than CDX2 as an immunomarker of CRC.
Allergic rhinitis is a common chronic disorder characterized by immunoglobulin E-mediated inflammation. To identify new genes associated with this trait, we performed genome- and epigenome-wide association studies and linked marginally significant CpGs located in genes or its promoter and SNPs located 1 Mb from the CpGs, by identifying cis methylation quantitative trait loci (mQTL). This approach relies on functional cellular aspects rather than stringent statistical correction. We were able to identify one gene with significant cis-mQTL for allergic rhinitis, caudal-type homeobox 1 (CDX1). We also identified 11 genes with marginally significant cis-mQTLs (p &lt; 0.05) including one with both allergic rhinitis with or without asthma (RNF39). Moreover, most SNPs identified were not located closest to the gene they were linked to through cis-mQTLs counting the one linked to CDX1 located in a gene previously associated with asthma and atopic dermatitis. By combining omics data, we were able to identify new genes associated with allergic rhinitis and better assess the genes linked to associated SNPs.
CDX1 and CDX2 are possibly predictive biomarkers in colorectal cancer. We combined digitally-guided (next generation) TMA construction (ngTMA) and the utility of digital image analysis (DIA) to assess accuracy, tumour heterogeneity and the selective impact of different combined intensity-percentage levels on prognosis.CDX1 and CDX2 immunohistochemistry was performed on ngTMAs covering normal tissue, tumour centre and invasive front. The percentages of all epithelial cells per staining intensity per core were analysed digitally. Beyond classical prognosis analysis following REMARK guidelines, we investigated pre-analytical conditions, three different types of heterogeneity (mosaic-like, targeted and haphazard) and influences on cohort segregation and patient selection. The ngTMA-DIA approach produced robust biomarker data with infrequent core loss and excellent on-target punching. The detailed assessment of tumour heterogeneity could - except for a certain diffuse mosaic-like heterogeneity - exclude differences between the invasive front and tumour centre, as well as detect haphazard clonal heterogeneous elements. Moreover, lower CDX1 and CDX2 counts correlated with mucinous histology, higher TNM stage, higher tumour grade and worse survival (p &lt; 0.01, all). Different protein expression intensity levels shared comparable prognostic power and a great overlap in patient selection. The combination of ngTMA with DIA enhances accuracy and controls for biomarker analysis. Beyond the confirmation of CDX1 and CDX2 as prognostically relevant markers in CRC, this study highlights the greater robustness of CDX2 in comparison to CDX1. For the assessment of CDX2 protein loss, cut-points as percentage data of complete protein loss can be deduced as a recommendation.
Objective To evaluate the immunohistochemical staining pattern of caudal type homeobox 2 (CDX2) protein in germ cell tumours (GCTs) of the testis. Methods This study reassessed archival tissue samples collected from patients diagnosed with primary and metastatic testicular GCTs for CDX2 immunoreactivity using standard immunohistochemical techniques. Positive nuclear immunostaining was evaluated with regard to both the staining intensity and the extent of the staining. Results Tissue sections from primary and metastatic testicular GCTs ( n = 104), germ cell neoplasia in situ (GCNis) ( n = 5) and benign testicles ( n = 15) were analysed. The GCNis and benign testicular tissues showed no immunoreactivity for CDX2. Strong and diffuse staining of CDX2 was demonstrated only in the mature colonic epithelium of teratomas in both primary and metastatic GCTs. CDX2 positivity in other tumours (one pure yolk sac tumour, one yolk sac component of a mixed GCT and one pure seminoma) was infrequent, and was only weak and focal. Conclusions CDX2 immunostaining should be interpreted based on both the staining intensity and the extent of staining so as not to cause misdiagnosis. Teratomas with colonic-type epithelium should be considered in the differential diagnosis if a metastatic tumour with an unknown primary shows prominent CDX2 immunostaining.
A 39-year-old woman presented with low back pain lasting for several weeks. Abdominopelvic computed tomography showed an ovarian cystic mass with an enhancing solid portion, fat and internal calcification. A right salpingo-oophorectomy was performed. A 9.7 cm round multiseptated cystic mass showed pathology of mature cystic teratoma and contained a solid portion, measuring 4.2 cm, composed mainly of carcinoid cells arranged in a trabecular-insular configuration admixed with surrounding thyroid follicles containing colloid. Juxtaposed were several nests of columnar cells interspersed with goblet cells and extracellular mucin pools. In the cyst wall of the teratoma, the lining of pseudostratified columnar cells was occasionally mixed with goblet cells transforming to the carcinoid portion. Immunohistochemically, both mucinous and strumal carcinoids were positive for polyclonal carcinoembryonic antigen, caudal type homeobox 2, cytokeratin (CK)7, CK20, synaptophysin, CD56 and focally positive for chromogranin. Thyroid follicles were positive for thyroid transcription factor-1 and thyroglobulin. After gastrointestinal and respiratory tract evaluation, no evidence of primary tumor, including omentum, was observed. The mass was diagnosed as a mixed strumal and mucinous type carcinoid associated with a mature cystic teratoma. 
Villous adenoma is a rare primary tumor of the urinary system, especially the bladder and kidneys. This study presents two cases of right pelvis villous adenoma, including that of a 61-year-old patient who had experienced hematuria for more than 1 year and was diagnosed with bladder and ureteral stones via B-ultrasound examination, and the other one involving a 65-year-old patient who was hospitalized for 6 days due to a right upper quadrant mass and diagnosed with right renal pelvis stones and hydrops via B-ultrasound examination. Both patients underwent nephrectomy, and their histological analysis demonstrated papillary projections covered by columnar cells and goblet cells. The first patient had a large amount of renal pelvis mucus accumulation with obvious microscopic intestinal metaplasia and mild-moderate nuclear atypia. Immunohistochemical studies revealed positive carcinoembryonic antigen and the caudal type homeobox 2 staining with varying degrees of cytokeratin (CK)-7 and CK20 expression in both patients. Recurrences or metastasis was not observed during the follow-up period of 3-4 years. 
Chronic gastritis frequently progresses into precancerous intestinal metaplasia and intraepithelial neoplasia lesions. Rebamipide is a free radical scavenger and we assessed its efficacy on clinical symptoms, gastric mucosal lesions, pathologic grade, and immunohistochemistry in chronic gastritis patients.
178 eligible patients were randomized into treatment and control groups. Both groups followed an optimized lifestyle for 26 weeks, but the treatment group was additionally medicated with rebamipide 0.1 g three times per day. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy was performed in all patients to evaluate the severity of gastritis by the Modified Lanza Scoring (MLS) and histological changes were evaluated by the Updated Sydney System Score (USSS). Gastric mucosa immunohistochemistry in the treatment group was performed using the intestinal metaplasia markers caudal type homeobox transcription factor 2 (CDX2) and trefoil factor 3 (TFF3) detection.
There were significant outcome differences between the treatment and control groups regarding the clinical symptom scores (2.62 ± 1.86 vs. 1.55 ± 1.61, P = 0.0001), gastric mucosal lesion scores (0.57 ± 1.05 vs. 0.16 ± 0.90, P = 0.002), and inflammation (P &lt; 0.05). Only in the treated patients were the rates of intestinal metaplasia (P = 0.017 vs. P = 0.123) and low-grade intraepithelial neoplasia (P = 0.005 vs. P = 0.226) significantly reduced after 26 weeks. The percentages of CDX2 (31.5 vs. 15.7%, P = 0.021) and TFF3 (44.9 vs. 25.8%, P = 0.012) expressing gastric mucosa cells were significantly lower after rebamipide medication than pre-treatment values.
Rebamipide improved the clinical symptoms, gastric mucosal lesions, and pathological grades of chronic gastritis patients and decreased the expression rates of CDX2 and TFF3 in gastric cells.
The immunoreactivity of thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF-1) is a very specific marker for lung and thyroid neoplasms; the expression of TTF-1 has also been demonstrated in extrapulmonary carcinomas. We examined the expression of TTF-1 in 15 intestinal-type adenocarcinomas of the extrahepatic bile duct. We then compared the expression to TTF-1 staining with other immunohistochemical markers including cytokeratin (CK) 7, CK20, caudal-type homeobox transcription factor 2 (CDX2), Napsin A, and MUC2. We additionally compared the clinicopathological prognostic factors with the TTF-1 expression status.
Nuclear TTF-1 staining was detected in 2 cases (13.3%), and Napsin A was positive in the same 2 cases (13.3%). All cases were positive for CK20, CDX2, and MUC2; 5 cases were positive for CK7. There was no correlation between TTF-1 expression and the clinicopathological characteristics.
To avoid potential pitfalls, TTF-1 should be interpreted in conjunction with the clinical setting, histology, and the results of markers such as CK7, CK20, Napsin A, and CDX2. This report is the first of TTF-1 positivity in adenocarcinomas from the extrahepatic biliary tract.
CDX2 has recently been identified as a prognostic marker for pancreatic adenocarcinoma. However, the role and mechanism of CDX2 in progression of pancreatic adenocarcinoma are still elusive. In this study, we observed that CDX2 expression was much lower in mouse pancreatic adenocarcinoma tissues and pancreatic cancer cells. A network integrated by ChIPBase platform hinted that miR-615-5p, a most newly discovered tumor suppressor, was probably bound by CDX2 in the promoter region. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-qPCR assay showed that CDX2 exhibited a high capacity of binding to miR-615-5p promoter region compared to the negative control. Real-time PCR and western blotting analyses revealed that CDX2 overexpression caused inflation of miR-615-5p and depression of insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2), a direct target of miR-615-5p. 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) and EdU approaches showed that CDX2 overexpression markedly suppressed pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell proliferation. CDX2 small interfering RNA (siRNA) transfection showed an opposite effect on gene expression and cell proliferation to that of CDX2 overexpression. Collectively, CDX2 inhibited pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell proliferation via promoting tumor suppressor miR-615-5p. Our findings suggested a potential molecular target for pancreatic adenocarcinoma therapy. 
To characterize the regeneration-associated stem cell-related phenotype of hepatocyte-derived growth factor receptor (HGFR)-expressing cells in active ulcerative colitis (UC).
On the whole 38 peripheral blood samples and 38 colonic biopsy samples from 18 patients with histologically proven active UC and 20 healthy control subjects were collected. After preparing tissue microarrays and blood smears HGFR, caudal type homeobox 2 (CDX2), prominin-1 (CD133) and Musashi-1 conventional and double fluorescent immunolabelings were performed. Immunostained samples were digitalized using high-resolution Mirax Desk instrument, and analyzed with the Mirax TMA Module software. For semiquantitative counting of immunopositive lamina propria (LP) cells 5 fields of view were counted at magnification × 200 in each sample core, then mean ± SD were determined. In case of peripheral blood smears, 30 fields of view with 100 μm diameter were evaluated in every sample and the number of immunopositive cells (mean ± SD) was determined. Using 337 nm UVA Laser MicroDissection system at least 5000 subepithelial cells from the lamina propria were collected. Gene expression analysis of HGFR, CDX2, CD133, leucine-rich repeat-containing G-protein coupled receptor 5 (Lgr5), Musashi-1 and cytokeratin 20 (CK20) were performed in both laser-microdisscted samples and blood samples by using real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).
By performing conventional and double fluorescent immunolabelings confirmed by RT-PCR, higher number of HGFR (blood: 6.7 ± 1.22 vs 38.5 ± 3.18; LP: 2.25 ± 0.85 vs 9.22 ± 0.65; P &lt; 0.05), CDX2 (blood: 0 vs 0.94 ± 0.64; LP: 0.75 ± 0.55 vs 2.11 ± 0.75; P &lt; 0.05), CD133 (blood: 1.1 ± 0.72 vs 8.3 ± 1.08; LP: 11.1 ± 0.85 vs 26.28 ± 1.71; P &lt; 0.05) and Musashi-1 (blood and LP: 0 vs scattered) positive cells were detected in blood and lamina propria of UC samples as compared to controls. HGFR/CDX2 (blood: 0 vs 1 ± 0.59; LP: 0.8 ± 0.69 vs 2.06 ± 0.72, P &lt; 0.05) and Musashi-1/CDX2 (blood and LP: 0 vs scattered) co-expressions were found in blood and lamina propria of UC samples. HGFR/CD133 and CD133/CDX2 co-expressions appeared only in UC lamina propria samples. CDX2, Lgr5 and Musashi-1 expressions in UC blood samples were not accompanied by CK20 mRNA expression.
In active UC, a portion of circulating HGFR-expressing cells are committed to the epithelial lineage, and may participate in mucosal regeneration by undergoing mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition.
1,25 Dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25(OH)2 D) increases intestinal Ca absorption when dietary Ca intake is low by inducing gene expression through the vitamin D receptor (VDR). 1,25(OH)2 D-regulated Ca absorption has been studied extensively in the small intestine, but VDR is also present in the large intestine. Our goal was to determine the impact of large intestinal VDR deletion on Ca and bone metabolism. We used transgenic mice expressing Cre-recombinase driven by the 9.5-kb human caudal type homeobox 2 (CDX2) promoter to delete floxed VDR alleles from the caudal region of the mouse (CDX2-KO). Weanling CDX2-KO mice and control littermates were fed low (0.25%) or normal (0.5%) Ca diets for 7 weeks. Serum and urinary Ca, vitamin D metabolites, bone parameters, and gene expression were analyzed. Loss of the VDR in CDX2-KO was confirmed in colon and kidney. Unexpectedly, CDX2-KO had lower serum PTH (-65% of controls, p &lt; 0.001) but normal serum 1,25(OH)2 D and Ca levels. Despite elevated urinary Ca loss (eightfold higher in CDX2-KO) and reduced colonic target genes TRPV6 (-90%) and CaBPD9k (-80%) mRNA levels, CDX2-KO mice had only modestly lower femoral bone density. Interestingly, duodenal TRPV6 and CaBPD9k mRNA expression was fourfold and threefold higher, respectively, and there was a trend toward increased duodenal Ca absorption (+19%, p = 0.076) in the CDX2-KO mice. The major finding of this study is that large intestine VDR significantly contributes to whole-body Ca metabolism but that duodenal compensation may prevent the consequences of VDR deletion from large intestine and kidney in growing mice.
Epigenetic changes play significant roles in cancer development. UHRF1, an epigenetic regulator, has been shown to be overexpressed and to coordinate tumor suppressor gene (TSG) silencing in several cancers. In a previous study, we found that UHRF1 promoted gastric cancer (GC) invasion and metastasis. However, the role and underlying mechanism of UHRF1 in GC carcinogenesis remain largely unknown. In the present study, we investigated UHRF1 expression and function in GC proliferation and explored its downstream regulatory mechanism. The results demonstrated that UHRF1 overexpression was an independent and significant predictor of GC prognosis. Downregulation of UHRF1 suppressed GC proliferation and growth in vitro and in vivo, and UHRF1 upregulation showed opposite effects. Furthermore, downregulation of UHRF1 reactivated 7 TSGs, including CDX2, CDKN2A, RUNX3, FOXO4, PPARG, BRCA1 and PML, via promoter demethylation. These results provide insight into the GC proliferation process, and suggest that targeting UHRF1 represents a new therapeutic approach to block GC development. 
Gastric adenocarcinoma with enteroblastic differentiation (GAED) has been recognized as a variant of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP)-producing gastric carcinoma, although its clinicopathologic and immunohistochemical features have not been fully elucidated.
To elucidate the clinicopathologic and immunohistochemical features of GAED, we analyzed 29 cases of GAED, including ten early and 19 advanced lesions, and compared these cases with 100 cases of conventional gastric adenocarcinoma (CGA). Immunohistochemistry for AFP, glypican 3, SALL4, and p53 was performed, and the phenotypic expression of the tumors was evaluated by immunostaining with antibodies against MUC5AC, MUC6, MUC2, CD10, and caudal-type homeobox 2 (CDX2).
Lymphatic and venous invasion was more frequent in GAED (76 and 72 %) than in CGA (41 and 31 %; P ≤ 0.001). Lymph node metastasis was more frequently observed in GAED (69 %) than in CGA (38 %; P = 0.005), as were synchronous or metachronous liver metastases (GAED, 31 %; CGA, 6 %; P ≤ 0.001). Immunohistochemically, all GAED were positive for at least one of three enteroblastic linage markers (AFP, glypican 3, and SALL4). Glypican 3 was the most sensitive marker (83 %) for GAED, followed by SALL4 (72 %) and AFP (45 %), whereas no CGA was positive. Furthermore, the rate of positive p53 staining was 59 % in GAED. Regarding the mucin phenotype, CD10 and CDX2 were diffusely or focally expressed in all GAED cases. Invasive areas with hepatoid or enteroblastic differentiation were negative for CD10 and CDX2.
Clinicopathologic features of GAED differ from those of CGA. GAED shows aggressive biological behavior, and is characteristically immunoreactive to AFP, glypican 3, or SALL4.
Caudal type homeobox transcription factor 2 (CDX2) is important in intestinal cell fate specification and multiple lines of evidence have substantiated that CDX2 is important in carcinogenesis of the digestive tract. The CDX2 regulatory network is intricate and remains to be fully elucidated in gastric cancer. The aim of the present study was to examine the effects of CDX2 on the growth of the MGC-803 human gastric cancer cell line in vivo, and to elucidate the mechanism involved. The effects of the overexpression of CDX2 in xenograft tumors of MGC-803 cells was investigated in nude mice through the injection of CDX2 recombinant lentiviral vectors. The tumor size was measured using vernier callipers. The expression levels of CDX2, survivin, B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2), Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bax), cyclin D1, s-phase kinase-associated protein 2 (Skp2) and c-Myc in the tumor cells were analyzed by western blotting and semi-quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. The apoptotic rates were determined using a terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling assay. The overexpression of CDX2 was observed in the group subjected to the injection of CDX2 recombinant lentiviral vectors. CDX2 had an inhibitory effect on the MGC-803 human gastric cancer cell line and promoted tumor cell apoptosis in vivo. Furthermore, the overexpression of CDX2 upregulated the expression of Bax and downregulated the expression levels of survivin, Bcl-2, cyclin D1, Skp2 and c-Myc in the tumor tissues. These results indicated that CDX2 may serve as a tumor suppressor in gastric cancer, and inhibits gastric cancer cell growth by suppressing the nuclear factor-κB signaling pathway.
HOX gene encodes a group of homeodomain transcription factors which are highly conserved. The caudal-type homeobox (CDX) , ten-eleven translocation (TET) genes and polycomb group (PcG) , trithorax group (TrxG) proteins act as upstream regulators of HOX genes that manipulate the targeted gene expression through genetic and epigenetic mechanisms. The abnormal expression of HOX genes and their fusions contribute to myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) pathogenesis. Aberrant DNA methylation and NUP98-HOX translocation serve as molecular mediators of dysfunction in MDS which can be used for the evaluation of biology and therapy. This article provides an overview of recent advances of studies on HOX gene and its abnormal molecular mechanisms, as well as potential correlation with MDS. 
The main aim of this study was to determine Cdx2 expression patterns during anorectal development in normal and anorectal malformation (ARM) embryos with a view to establishing the possible role of Cdx2 in ARM pathogenesis. ARM was induced with ethylenethiourea on the 10th gestational day (GD10) in rat embryos, and Cesarean deliveries were performed to harvest the embryos. The temporal and spatial expression of Cdx2 was evaluated in normal rat embryos (n = 303) and ARM embryos (n = 321) from GD13 to GD16. Immunohistochemical staining revealed that, in normal embryos, Cdx2 was mainly expressed on the epithelium of the urorectal septum (URS) and the hindgut on GD13. On GD14, Cdx2-immunopositive cells were extensively detected on the URS, hindgut, and cloacal membrane. On GD15, increased immunopositive tissue staining on the anal membrane was evident. In ARM embryos, the epithelium of the cloaca, URS, and anorectum were negative or faintly immunostaining for Cdx2. Analyses by Western blot and real-time reverse transcription plus the polymerase chain reaction revealed that, in the normal group, Cdx2 protein and mRNA expression showed time-dependent changes in the developing hindgut from GD13 to GD16. Upon the URS division of the cloaca into the primitive rectum and urogenital sinus (UGS) on GD15, Cdx2 expression began to decrease. Moreover, the Cdx2 expression level in the ARM group from GD13 to GD14 was significantly lower than that in the normal group (P &lt; 0.05). In ARM embryos, an imbalance in the spatiotemporal expression of Cdx2 was noted during anorectal morphogenesis from GD13 to GD16. Downregulation of Cdx2 at the time of cloacal separation into the primitive rectum and UGS might thus be related to the development of ARM. 
To authenticate the colon cancer preventive potential of silibinin, the efficacy of silibinin needs to be tested by evaluating an organ-specific biomarker. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of silibinin on the colonic expression of the caudal-type homeobox transcription factor (CDX2) an intestine specific tumor suppressor gene and its downstream targets in the colon of rats challenged with 1,2 dimethyl hydrazine (DMH). Rats of groups 1 and 2 were treated as control and silibinin control. Rats under groups 3 and 4 were given DMH (20 mg/kg body weight (b.w.) subcutaneously) once a week for 15 consecutive weeks from the 4th week of the experimental period. In addition, group 4 rats alone were treated with silibinin (50 mg/kg b.w. per os) everyday throughout the study period of 32 weeks. Histological investigation and messenger RNA and protein expression studies were performed in the colonic tissues of experimental rats. Findings of the study revealed that DMH administration significantly decreased the expression of CDX2 and Guanylyl cyclase C (GCC) in the colon of experimental rats. Further the decreased levels of CDX2 protein, colonic mucin content, and increased number of mast cells in the colon of DMH alone-administered rats reflects the onset of carcinogenesis. The pathological changes caused due to CDX2 suppression were attenuated by silibinin supplementation. 
We report an unusual case of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP)-producing gastric carcinoma with enteroblastic differentiation. A 75-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital with occasional upper abdominal discomfort. We performed gastroscopy and observed a type 2 tumor, primarily in the pyloric region. Histological examination of biopsies confirmed gastric adenocarcinoma. Based on these findings, we diagnosed gastric adenocarcinoma and performed laparoscopic distal gastrectomy with lymph node dissection. Histological examination revealed an invasive lesion composed of adenocarcinoma with a tubulopapillary growth pattern. Tumor cells were cuboidal in shape with characteristically clear cytoplasm rich in glycogen. Two regional lymph node metastases were seen microscopically. Immunohistochemically these cells were positive for AFP, carcinoembryonic antigen, caudal-type homeobox transcription factor 2 and common acute lymphoblastic leukemia antigen. The final diagnosis was AFP-producing gastric carcinoma with enteroblastic differentiation. 26 months after initial surgery, the patient was readmitted to our hospital for gastrointestinal obstruction due to lymph node recurrence. 
Thyroid and glucocorticoid hormones and several transcriptional factors such as caudal type homeobox (CDX)-2 and hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF)-1α are important for the differentiation of small intestinal absorptive cells and the consequent expression of genes related to the digestion/absorption of carbohydrates. In this study, we investigated whether thyroid and glucocorticoid hormones enhanced the expression of lactase-phlorizin hydrolase (LPH) gene, an intestine-specific gene that encodes an enzyme for lactose digestion, in small intestinal stem-like IEC-6 cells co-transfected with CDX-2 and HNF-1α using a retrovirus system. Changes in expression of intestine-specific genes caused by treatment with thyroid and/or glucocorticoid hormones were monitored in empty vector-transfected cells and in CDX-2/HNF-1α co-transfected cells by qRT-PCR. Stable co-transfection with CDX-2 and HNF-1α evoked the expression of the LPH gene in IEC-6 cells. Furthermore, treatment with a thyroid hormone, triiodothyronine, and a glucocorticoid receptor agonist, dexamethasone, significantly enhanced expression of the LPH, CDX-2 and HNF-1α genes in CDX-2/HNF-1α co-transfected IEC-6 cells. These results suggest that thyroid and glucocorticoid hormones synergistically enhance expression of the LPH gene in CDX-2/HNF-1α co-transfected IEC-6 cells. 
Helicobacter pylori encoded CagA is presently the only known virulence factor that is injected into gastric epithelial cells where it destroys apical junctional complexes and induces dedifferentiation of gastric epithelial cells, leading to H. pylori-related gastric carcinogensis. However, little is known about the molecular mechanisms by which CagA mediates these changes. Caudal-related homeobox 2 (Cdx2) is an intestine-specific transcription factor highly expressed in multistage tissues of dysplasia and cancer. One specific target of Cdx2, Claudin-2, is involved in the regulation of tight junction (TJ) permeability. In this study, our findings showed that the activity of Cdx2 binding to Cdx binding sites of CdxA (GTTTATG) and CdxB (TTTTAGG) of probes corresponding to claudin-2 flanking region increased in AGS cells, infected with CagA positive wild-type strain of H. pylori, compared to CagA negative isogenic mutant-type strain. Moreover, Cdx2 upregulated claudin-2 expression at transcriptional level and translational level. In the meantime, we found that TJs of AGS cells, infected with CagA positive wild-type strain of H. pylori, compared to CagA negative isogenic mutant-type strain, were more severely destroyed, leading to wider cell gap, interference of contact, scattering and highly elevated migration of cells. Herein, this study is firstly demonstrated that H. pylori-encoded CagA disrupts TJs and induces invasiveness of AGS gastric carcinoma cells via Cdx2-dependent targeting of Claudin-2. This provides a new mechanism whereby CagA induced dedifferentiation of AGS cells, leading to malignant behavior of biology.
This paper reported five new cases of cardiac myxoma with glandular components, known as glandular cardiac myxoma. The goals of this study were to analyze the clinicopathological features of this disease and to explore new features for differential diagnosis. The patient series included three women and two men. All tumors were located in the left atrium without invasion of the adjacent myocardium. Patients presented with cardiac-related or embolization symptoms. Histologically, neoplasms consisted of well-formed glandular structures and typical myxoma areas. No nuclear atypia, mitosis, or necrosis was identified in the glandular structures. Glandular lining cells were strongly positive for pan-cytokeratin, epithelial membrane antigen, CAM5.2 and cytokeratin 7, but were negative for some organ-specific markers, such as thyroid transcription factor-1, calretinin, estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, gross cystic disease fluid protein, prostate-specific antigen, prostate-specific acid phosphatase, cytokeratin 20 and caudal type homeobox 2. In conclusion, glandular cardiac myxoma is a rare disease which shows characteristics similar to those of classical cardiac myxoma. Because of its rarity, glandular cardiac myxoma must be distinguished from adenocarcinoma metastatic to the heart. The combination of histopathological features and immunohistochemical profiles should improve the diagnostic accuracy of glandular cardiac myxoma. 
Here we have provided evidence that nitric oxide-cyclic GMP (NO-cGMP) signaling regulates neurite length and migration of immature neurons derived from the medial ganglionic eminence (MGE). Dlx1/2(-/-) and Lhx6(-/-) mouse mutants, which exhibit MGE interneuron migration defects, have reduced expression of the gene encoding the α subunit of a soluble guanylate cyclase (Gucy1A3). Furthermore, Dlx1/2(-/-) mouse mutants have reduced expression of NO synthase 1 (NOS1). Gucy1A3(-/-) mice have a transient reduction in cortical interneuron number. Pharmacological inhibition of soluble guanylate cyclase and NOS activity rapidly induces neurite retraction of MGE cells in vitro and in slice culture and robustly inhibits cell migration from the MGE and caudal ganglionic eminence. We provide evidence that these cellular phenotypes are mediated by activation of the Rho signaling pathway and inhibition of myosin light chain phosphatase activity. 
Recent studies have shown two distinct non-CIMP methylation clusters in colorectal cancer, raising the possibility that DNA methylation, involving non-CIMP genes, may play a role in the conventional adenoma-carcinoma pathway. A total of 135 adenomas (65 left colon and 70 right colon) were profiled for epigenome-wide DNA methylation using the Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip. A principal components analysis was performed to examine the association between variability in DNA methylation and adenoma location. Linear regression and linear mixed effects models were used to identify locus-specific differential DNA methylation in adenomas of right and left colon. A significant association was present between the first principal component and adenoma location (P=0.007), even after adjustment for subject age and gender (P=0.009). A total of 168 CpG sites were differentially methylated between right- and left-colon adenomas and these loci demonstrated enrichment of homeobox genes (P=3.0 × 10(-12)). None of the 168 probes were associated with CIMP genes. Among CpG loci with the largest difference in methylation between right- and left-colon adenomas, probes associated with PRAC (prostate cancer susceptibility candidate) gene showed hypermethylation in right-colon adenomas whereas those associated with CDX2 (caudal type homeobox transcription factor 2) showed hypermethylation in left-colon adenomas. A subgroup of left-colon adenomas enriched for current smokers (OR=6.1, P=0.004) exhibited a methylation profile similar to right-colon adenomas. In summary, our results indicate distinct patterns of DNA methylation, independent of CIMP genes, in adenomas of the right and left colon. 
Mesodiencephalic dopaminergic (mdDA) neurons control locomotion and emotion and are affected in multiple psychiatric and neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson's disease (PD). The homeodomain transcription factor Pitx3 is pivotal in mdDA neuron development and loss of Pitx3 results in programming deficits in a rostrolateral subpopulation of mdDA neurons destined to form the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc), reminiscent of the specific cell loss observed in PD. We show here that in adult mice in which the gene encoding a second homeoprotein, engrailed 1 (En1), has been deleted, dramatic loss of mdDA neurons and striatal innervation defects were observed, partially reminiscent of defects observed in Pitx3(-/-) mice. We then continue to reveal developmental crosstalk between En1 and Pitx3 through genome-wide expression analysis. During development, both En1 and Pitx3 are required to induce expression of mdDA genes in the rostrolateral subset destined to form the SNc. By contrast, Pitx3 and En1 reciprocally regulate a separate gene cluster, which includes Cck, demarcating a caudal mdDA subset in wild-type embryos. Whereas En1 is crucial for induction of this caudal phenotype, Pitx3 antagonizes it rostrolaterally. The combinatorial action of En1 and Pitx3 is potentially realized through at least three levels of molecular interaction: (1) influencing each other's expression level, (2) releasing histone deacetylase-mediated repression of Nurr1 target genes and (3) modulating En1 activity through Pitx3-driven activation of En1 modulatory proteins. These findings show how two crucial mediators of mdDA neuronal development, En1 and Pitx3, interact in dopaminergic subset specification, the importance of which is exemplified by the specific vulnerability of the SNc found in PD. 
  Human induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells were differentiated into the endoderm using activin A and were then treated with fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) for differentiation into intestinal stem cell-like cells. These immature cells were then differentiated into enterocyte-like cells using epidermal growth factor (EGF) in 2% fetal bovine serum (FBS). At the early stage of differentiation, mRNA expression of caudal type homeobox 2 (CDX2), a major transcription factor related to intestinal development and differentiation, and leucine-rich repeat-containing G-protein-coupled receptor 5 (LGR5), an intestinal stem cell marker, was markedly increased by treatment with FGF2. When cells were cultured in medium containing EGF and a low concentration of FBS, mRNAs of specific markers of intestinal epithelial cells, including sucrase-isomaltase, the intestinal oligopeptide transporter SLC15A1/peptide transporter 1 (PEPT1), and the major metabolizing enzyme CYP3A4, were expressed. In addition, sucrase-isomaltase protein expression and uptake of β-Ala-Lys-N-7-amino-4-methylcoumarin-3-acetic acid (β-Ala-Lys-AMCA), a fluorescence-labeled substrate of the oligopeptide transporter, were detected. These results demonstrate a simple and direct method for differentiating human iPS cells into functional enterocyte-like cells. 
MiR-424 plays an important role via promoting the monocytic differentiation in many human leukemia cell lines. Here, we report that miR-424 decreased miR-125b expression to 36 % by directly targeting caudal type homeobox 2. However, miR-424 also decreased expression of Fes, PU.1 and colony-stimulating factor receptor (MCSFR). As Fes, PU.1 and MCSFR were down-regulated by over-expression of miR-125b (unpublished work), a similar effect of miR-424 and Fes siRNA on CD64, Egr-1, Egr-2 and CEBPA indicates that Fes may be an important downstream target of miR-424. We hypothesize that miR-424 promotes monocytic differentiation by regulating other critical factors and miR-424 has high affinity for these factors. For the first time, the molecular mechanism of miR-424 during monocytic differentiation of U937 cells has been elucidated in this study.
Gastric cancer is one of the most common malignancies and remains the second leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide. Over 70% of new cases and deaths occur in developing countries. In the early years of the molecular biology revolution, cancer research mainly focuses on genetic alterations, including gastric cancer. Epigenetic mechanisms are essential for normal development and maintenance of tissue-specific gene expression patterns in mammals. Disruption of epigenetic processes can lead to altered gene function and malignant cellular transformation. Recent advancements in the rapidly evolving field of cancer epigenetics have shown extensive reprogramming of every component of the epigenetic machinery in cancer, including DNA methylation, histone modifications, nucleosome positioning, noncoding RNAs, and microRNAs. Aberrant DNA methylation in the promoter regions of gene, which leads to inactivation of tumor suppressor and other cancer-related genes in cancer cells, is the most well-defined epigenetic hallmark in gastric cancer. The advantages of gene methylation as a target for detection and diagnosis of cancer in biopsy specimens and non-invasive body fluids such as serum and gastric washes have led to many studies of application in gastric cancer. This review focuses on the most common and important phenomenon of epigenetics, DNA methylation, in gastric cancer and illustrates the impact epigenetics has had on this field. 
The DNA methylation inhibitor 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-aza-CdR) is widely used as an anticancer drug for the treatment of leukemia and solid tumors. Gastric cancer (GC) patients who were positive for caudal type homeobox transcription factor 2 (CDX2) expression showed a higher survival rate compared with those who were CDX2 negative, which suggests that CDX2 performs a tumor suppressor role. However, the molecular mechanisms leading to the inactivation of CDX2 remain unclear. In the present study we demonstrated that the expression levels of CDX2 and DNA methyltransferase enzyme 1 (DNMT1) mRNA were significantly higher in GC compared with distal non-cancerous tissue. The expression of CDX2 mRNA was significantly correlated with Lauren classification, TNM stage and lymph node metastasis. DNMT1 mRNA expression was significantly correlated with TNM stage, pathological differentiation and lymph node metastasis. The expression of CDX2 mRNA was inversely correlated with that of DNMT1 mRNA in GC. Hypermethylation of the CDX2 gene promoter region, extremely low expression levels of CDX2 mRNA and no expression of CDX2 protein were the characteristics observed in MKN-45 and SGC-7901 GC cell lines. Following the treatment of MKN-45 cells with 5-aza-CdR, the hypermethylated CDX2 gene promoter region was demethylated and expression of CDX2 was upregulated, while DNMT1 expression was downregulated. Furthermore, a concentration- and time-dependent growth inhibition as well as increased apoptosis were observed. Caspase-3, -8 and -9 activities increased in a concentration-dependent manner following exposure to different concentrations of 5-aza-CdR. Therefore, our data show that the overexpression of DNMT1 and methylation of the CDX2 gene promoter region is likely to be responsible for CDX2 silencing in GC. 5-Aza-CdR may effectively induce re-expression of the CDX2 gene, inhibit cell proliferation and enhance the caspase-independent apoptosis of MKN-45 cells in vitro.
Proton-coupled folate transporter (PCFT), which is responsible for the intestinal uptake of folates and analogs, is expressed only in the proximal region in the small intestine. The present study was to examine its transcriptional regulation, which may be involved in such a unique expression profile and potentially in its alteration, using dual-luciferase reporter assays in human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells. The luciferase activity derived from the reporter construct containing the 5'-flanking sequence of -1695/+96 of the human PCFT gene was enhanced most extensively by the introduction of Krüppel-like factor 4 (KLF4). The KLF4-induced luciferase activity was further enhanced by hepatocyte nuclear factor 4α (HNF4α) synergistically. To the contrary, caudal-type homeobox transcription factor 2 (CDX2) and CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein α (C/EBPα) extensively suppressed the luciferase activity induced by KLF4 alone and also that induced by KLF4 and HNF4α. Western blot analysis using the rat small intestine indicated uniform expression of KLF4 along the intestinal tract, proximal-oriented expression of HNF4α, distal-oriented expression of CDX2 and C/EBPα. These results suggest that the activity of PCFT promoter is basically induced by KLF4 and the gradiented expression profile of PCFT may be at least in part accounted for by those of HNF4α, CDX2 and C/EBPα.
ADAM2, a member of the 'a disintegrin and metalloprotease' (ADAM) family, is a key protein in mammalian fertilization that is specifically expressed in testicular germ cells. Here, we investigated the transcriptional regulation of the mouse Adam2 gene. An in silico analysis identified two conserved non-coding sequences located upstream of the mouse and human ADAM2 genes. The upstream region of the mouse Adam2 gene was found to lack typical TATA and CAAT boxes, and to have a high GC content. Our in vitro transient transfection-reporter analysis identified a promoter in this region of the mouse Adam2 gene, along with regulatory regions that inhibit the activity of this promoter in somatic cells. Site-directed mutagenesis revealed that the caudal-type homeobox 1 and CCTC-binding factor motifs are responsible for the inhibitory activities of the repressor regions. Finally, electrophoretic mobility shift assays showed putative transcription factor-promoter DNA complexes, and DNA-affinity chromatography and proteomic analyses identified myelin gene regulatory factor as a binding partner of the Adam2 promoter. This provides the first identification and characterization of promoter and repressor regions that regulate the transcription of the mouse Adam2 gene, and offers insights into the regulation of this germ-cell-specific gene.
CDX-2 is a caudal-type homeobox gene, encoding a transcription factor that plays an important role in proliferation and differentiation of intestinal epithelial cells. The utility of antibodies to CDX2 in the identification of adenocarcinomas of the gastrointestinal tract, particularly colorectal adenocarcinomas, in both primary and metastatic settings is well established. It is well-known that patients with testicular tumors may occasionally lack an obvious palpable mass. However, the expression of CDX2 in malignant germ cell tumors of the testes which have metastatic potential has not been previously studied in a large series. A tissue microarray was constructed from 52 malignant germ cell tumors of the testes including: 29 cases of classic seminoma, 8 cases of embryonal carcinoma, 8 cases of yolk sac tumor, 4 cases of malignant teratoma, 2 cases of choriocarcinoma, and 1 case of spermatocytic seminoma. Ten cases of intratubular germ cell neoplasia and seven cases of benign testicles with normal seminiferous tubules were also included in tissue microarray. Immunohistochemical stains for CDX2 was performed and analyzed. Only nuclear staining was considered positive. Positive expression of CDX2 was identified in 2/2 cases (100 %) of choriocarcinoma, 4/8 cases (50 %) of teratoma, 3/8 cases (38 %) of embryonal carcinoma, 3/8 cases (38 %) of yolk sac tumor, and 1/29 cases (3 %) of classic seminoma. CDX2 was negative in all cases of intratubular germ cell neoplasia, normal seminiferous tubules, and the only case of spermatocytic seminoma. The role of CDX-2 in the differentiation of intestinal/enteric epithelial cells may contribute to the formation of trophoblastic, glandular, villous, or cystic structures in germ cell tumors of the testes. This study suggests that the expression of CDX2 in a variety of malignant germ cell tumors of the testes may be a potential pitfall in metastatic tumors of unknown primary, which are thought to be of gastrointestinal/colorectal origin but are actually from a clinically occult testicular tumor.
The high concentration of nitric oxide (NO) around the gastro-esophageal junction (GEJ) might play an important role in the development of Barrett's esophagus (BE), a precursor of Barrett's adenocarcimona. Although previous studies revealed that the expression of caudal-type homeobox 2 (CDX2), an important marker of BE, might be induced through Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR), the roles of NO in this signal transduction remain unclear.
First, we investigated the expressions of EGFR, CDX2 and nitrotyrosine by immunohistochemical study for BE and squamous epithelium of human specimens. Second, we studied the effect of peroxynitrite, peroxynitrite stimulator, SIN-1, or NO donor, NOC7, on the expression of phosphorylated EGFR and CDX2 in KYSE30, an EGFR-rich human esophageal squamous cell carcinoma cell-line. Specific inhibitors for EGFR, AG1478 and small interfering RNA for EGFR (EGFR-siRNA) were employed to elucidate the role of EGFR in the induction of CDX2.
The immunohistochemical study revealed that the expressions of EGFR, CDX2 and nitrotyrosine in BE were stronger than those in squamous epithelium with positive correlations. Exposure to peroxynitrite, SIN-1 or NOC7 induced EGFR phosphorylation and CDX2 expression in dose- and time-dependent manners. Both EGFR phosphorylation and CDX2 induction were significantly diminished by AG 1478 and EGFR-siRNA.
We revealed for the first time that extrinsic NO might directly induce CDX2 expression through EGFR phosphorylation. We suggested that NO had an important role in the development of BE from squamous epithelium around GEJ.
To investigate the expression and significance of caudal-related homeobox transcription factor (Cdx2) in gastric carcinoma (GC) and precancerous lesions.
The expression of Cdx2 in GC, precancerous lesions and normal gastric mucosa were detected using immunohistochemical method. Hematoxylin and eosin staining, alcian blue/periodic acid-schiff and high iron diamine/alcian blue staining were used to classify intestinal metaplasia (IM) and GC.
Cdx2 was not detected in normal gastric mucosa. Cdx2 expression was detected in 87.1% (101/116) of IM, 50% (36/72) of dysplasia and 48.2% (41/85) of GC. The Cdx2-expressing cells in IM were more prevalent than in dysplasia and carcinoma (P &lt; 0.05). There was no relationship between Cdx2 expression and the classification of IM or the degree of dysplasia. Expression of Cdx2 was significantly higher in intestinal-type carcinoma than in diffuse and mixed-type carcinoma (P &lt; 0.05). Positive expression of Cdx2 was mainly found in moderately to well differentiated GC. There was a negative association between nuclear Cdx2 expression and lymph node metastasis and tumor, nodes, metastasis stage of GC (P &lt; 0.05). The patients with Cdx2-positive expression showed a higher survival rate than those with Cdx2-negative expression (P = 0.038). Multivariate analysis revealed that the expression of Cdx2 and lymph node metastasis were independent prognostic indicators of GC (P &lt; 0.05).
Cdx2 may be closely related to IM and the intestinal-type GC and implicate better biological behavior and outcome. Cdx2 is useful for predicting the prognosis of GC.
A critical cis-regulatory element for the CFTR (cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator) gene is located in intron 11, 100 kb distal to the promoter, with which it interacts. This sequence contains an intestine-selective enhancer and associates with enhancer signature proteins, such as p300, in addition to tissue-specific TFs (transcription factors). In the present study we identify critical TFs that are recruited to this element and demonstrate their importance in regulating CFTR expression. In vitro DNase I footprinting and EMSAs (electrophoretic mobility-shift assays) identified four cell-type-selective regions that bound TFs in vitro. ChIP (chromatin immunoprecipitation) identified FOXA1/A2 (forkhead box A1/A2), HNF1 (hepatocyte nuclear factor 1) and CDX2 (caudal-type homeobox 2) as in vivo trans-interacting factors. Mutation of their binding sites in the intron 11 core compromised its enhancer activity when measured by reporter gene assay. Moreover, siRNA (small interfering RNA)-mediated knockdown of CDX2 caused a significant reduction in endogenous CFTR transcription in intestinal cells, suggesting that this factor is critical for the maintenance of high levels of CFTR expression in these cells. The ChIP data also demonstrate that these TFs interact with multiple cis-regulatory elements across the CFTR locus, implicating a more global role in intestinal expression of the gene.
This study compared the expression of genes involved in pluripotency, segregation of inner cell mass (ICM) and trophectoderm (TE), and primitive endoderm (PE) formation in porcine embryos produced by in vitro fertilization (IVF), parthenogenetic activation (PA), and nuclear transfer (NT) using either fetal fibroblasts (FF-NT) or mesenchymal stem cells (MSC-NT).
Blastocyst formation and total cell number were analyzed. The expression patterns of transcripts, including SRY-related HMG-box gene 2 (SOX2), reduced expression gene 1 (REX1/ZFP42), LIN28, caudal type homeobox 2 (CDX2), TEA domain family member 4 (TEAD4), integrin beta 1 (ITGB1) and GATA6 were assessed at the 4-8 cell and blastocyst stage embryos by real-time PCR.
Developmental rates to blastocyst stage and total cell number were higher in IVF and PA embryos than in NT embryos. But MSC-NT embryos had increased blastocyst formation and higher total cell number compared to FF-NT embryos. The relative expressions of transcripts were higher in blastocysts than in 4-8 cell stage embryos. The mRNA expression levels of SOX2 and REX1 were largely similar in embryos of different origins. However, the genes such as LIN28, CDX2, TEAD4, ITGB1 and GATA6 showed the differential expression pattern in PA and NT embryos compared to IVF embryos. Importantly, the transcript levels in MSC-NT embryos were relatively less variable to IVF than those in FF-NT embryos.
MSCs seem to be better donors for porcine NT as they improved the developmental competency, and influenced the expression pattern of genes quite similar with IVF embryos than that of FFs.
The present study was designed to determine the effects of vitrification on promoter methylation and the expression levels of pluripotency and differentiation genes in mouse blastocysts. Promoter region CpG methylation patterns and the expression levels of octamer-binding transcription factor (Oct4), Nanog homeobox (Nanog), caudal-type homeobox 2 (Cdx2), and heart and neural crest derivatives-expressed transcript 1 (Hand1) were analyzed in fresh and vitrified mouse blastocysts. Methylation was measured by bisulphate mutagenesis and sequencing; gene expression was determined by real-time reverse transcription-PCR. The results showed that vitrification significantly reduced the methylation levels of the Oct4 (85% vs. 62.5%), Nanog (77.5% vs. 55%), and Cdx2 promoters (4.6% vs. 1.4%; P &lt; 0.05) in mouse blastocysts, which correlated with increased expression of Oct4 and Nanog in vitrified blastocysts. Hand1 promoter methylation was not significantly different in the fresh (17.9%) versus vitrification group (21.4%; P &gt; 0.05). The expression levels of Cdx2 and Hand1 were not significantly different in fresh and vitrified blastocysts. In conclusion, vitrification significantly decreased Oct4, Nanog, and Cdx2 promoter methylation in mouse blastocysts, which correlated with increased expression of Oct4 and Nanog.
  To analyse the expression of several mucins (MUC1, MUC2, MUC3, MUC5AC and MUC6), epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), v-erb-b2 erythroblastic leukaemia viral oncogene homologue 2 (HER2), thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF-1), caudal type homeobox 2 (CDX2) and cytokeratin 20 (CK20), and the presence of mutations of EGFR, KRAS and HER2 in congenital pulmonary airway malformations (CPAM).
  Forty-one cases of CPAM and six pulmonary sequestrations were included. TTF-1 expression was observed in all cases but was not seen in mucinogenic growths in CPAM. CDX2 expression was completely negative. MUC1 expression was noted in 12 (29%) CPAM and in 33% sequestrations. MUC5AC was noted in only five cases (26%) by immunohistochemistry and was found in the mucinogenic proliferations of type 1 CPAM. No immunolabelling was noted for the other mucins. EGFR was expressed variably in almost all cases, while HER2 and CK20 was seen exclusively in the mucinogenic proliferations. All mucinous growths were characterized by KRAS mutations. No EGFR and HER2 gene alterations were identified.
  KRAS mutations and MUC5AC, CK20 and HER2 expression was seen in all mucinogenic proliferations, supporting the neoplastic nature of these cytologically bland growths. These findings emphasize the importance of complete surgical resection of such lesions.
Although thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF-1) immunoreactivity is considered as a specific marker of lung and thyroid neoplasms, it may be positive in a proportion of extrapulmonary adenocarcinomas. This study examined the expression of TTF-1 in 555 colorectal adenocarcinomas using three commercial monoclonal antibodies: clone SPT24 (Novocastra) and 8G7G3/1 (Dako and Cell Marque), and compared the TTF-1 staining with other immunohistochemical markers, cytokeratin (CK) 7, CK 20, caudal-type homeobox transcription factor 2 (CDX2), and MUC2. The clinicopathological prognostic factors were compared with the TTF-1 expression status. Nuclear TTF-1 staining was detected in 24 cases (4.3%) with the SPT24 antibody and 18 cases (3.2%) with the 8G7G3/1 antibody. All cases positive for 8G7G3/1 were also positive for SPT24. CDX2 was expressed constantly in all 24 TTF-1-positive colorectal cancers, whereas CK7, CK20, and MUC2 were detected in 2 (8.3%), 23 (95.8%), and 8 (33.3%) cases, respectively. There was no correlation between TTF-1 expression and clinicopathological significance. To avoid potential pitfalls, TTF-1 should be interpreted in conjunction with the clinical setting, histological features, and the results of other markers, such as CK7, CK20, and CDX2. MUC2 can be used as supplementary information to confirm difficult cases.
The apical sodium-dependent bile acid transporter (ASBT) is expressed abundantly in the ileum and mediates bile acid absorption across the apical membranes. Caudal-type homeobox proteins CDX1 and CDX2 are transcription factors that regulate genes involved in intestinal epithelial differentiation and proliferation. Aberrant expression of both ASBT and CDXs in Barrett's esophagus (BE) prompted us to study, whether the expression of the ASBT gene is regulated by CDXs. Short interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of CDXs resulted in reduced ASBT mRNA expression in intestinal cells. CDXs strongly induced the activity of the ASBT promoter in reporter assays in esophageal and intestinal cells. Nine CDX binding sites were predicted in silico within the ASBT promoter, and binding of CDXs to six of them was verified in vitro and within living cells by electrophoretic mobility shift assays and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays, respectively. RNAs were extracted from esophageal biopsies from 20 BE patients and analyzed by real-time PCR. Correlation with ASBT expression was found for CDX1, CDX2, and HNF-1α in BE biopsies. In conclusion, the human ASBT promoter is activated transcriptionally by CDX1 and CDX2. Our finding provides a possible explanation for the reported observation that ASBT is aberrantly expressed in esophageal metaplasia that also expresses CDX transcription factors.
The transcription factor Atoh1/Hath1 plays crucial roles in the differentiation program of human intestinal epithelium cells (IECs). Although previous studies have indicated that the Notch signal suppresses the differentiation program of IEC, the mechanism by which it does so remains unknown. This study shows that the undifferentiated state is maintained by the suppression of the Hath1 gene in human intestine.
To assess the effect of Notch signaling, doxycycline-induced expression of Notch intracellular domain (NICD) and Hes1 cells were generated in LS174T. Hath1 gene expression was analyzed by quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Hath1 promoter region targeted by HES1 was determined by both reporter analysis and ChIP assay. Expression of Hath1 protein in ulcerative colitis (UC) was examined by immunohistochemistry.
Hath1 mRNA expression was increased by Notch signal inhibition. However, Hath1 expression was suppressed by ectopic HES1 expression alone even under Notch signal inhibition. Suppression of the Hath1 gene by Hes1, which binds to the 5' promoter region of Hath1, resulted in suppression of the phenotypic gene expression for goblet cells. In UC, the cooperation of aberrant expression of HES1 and the disappearance of caudal type homeobox 2 (CDX2) caused Hath1 suppression, resulting in goblet cell depletion.
The present study suggests that Hes1 is essential for Hath1 gene suppression via Notch signaling. Moreover, the suppression of Hath1 is associated with goblet cell depletion in UC. Understanding the regulation of goblet cell depletion may lead to the development of new therapy for UC.
Several studies performed on pancreatic-duodenal homeobox 1 (PDX1) have demonstrated a loss of expression and negative tumor modulator effect in gastric carcinoma. Relations between PDX1 and gastric metaplasia, differentiated type of gastric carcinoma, and the early stage of the disease have been exhibited in previous reports. The aim of this study was to examine expressions of PDX1, caudal type homeobox 2 (CDX2) and mucin (MUC) profiles to address the role of PDX1 in gastric carcinogenesis and its relationship with CDX2.
Seventy gastrectomy specimens were analyzed immunohistochemically for PDX1, CDX2, MUC2, MUC5AC, and MUC6 expressions. The sum of cytoplasmic and nuclear PDX1 immunostaining and PDX1 positivity were assessed. All of the antibodies were examined for a correlation with tumor type, clinicopathologic parameters, and metaplasias. The relation of Ki-67 proliferation index with the expression profiles was also investigated.
Neither PDX1 (66/70) nor CDX2 (37/70) and the mucin profiles (MUC2:11/70, MUC5AC:48/70, MUC6:41/70) showed a significant difference between differentiated and undifferentiated types of gastric carcinoma and clinicopathologic parameters. The PDX1 expression frequency was 94.3%, with an average PDX1 score of 8.8 ± 4.2. PDX1 and CDX2 expression showed a significant difference (P = 0.026 and P = 0.002, respectively) among the phenotypic classification of gastric carcinomas. All of the gastric and intestinal mixed-phenotype gastric carcinomas (GI-type) showed both PDX1 and CDX2 immunopositivity. Except for the relation of PDX1 score with MUC6 expression, no significant difference was detected between PDX1 and CDX2, MUC2, and MUC5AC expressions. A relationship between CDX2 and MUC2 and also between MUC5AC and MUC6 was found statistically. The Ki-67 proliferation index revealed a significant positive correlation with PDX1, CDX2, and MUC2 positivity.
PDX1 expression revealed a higher positivity in gastric carcinomas than the previous studies and showed no relation with tumor type, clinicopathologic parameters, CDX2 expression, or mucin profiles. However, a significant relation of PDX1 and CDX2 expressions among phenotypic classification of gastric carcinomas reveals an idea about similar functions for PDX1 and CDX2 in the evolution of gastric carcinoma.
Trophoblastic cells play a crucial role in implantation and placentogenesis. A large proportion of the failures of conception in cows occur in the peri-implantation period, which are known as early embryo losses. In exploring this critical phenomenon, trophoblastic cell lines can provide substantial information. Unfortunately, there are few cell lines for this purpose in cattle because of the difficulty of raising successive cell stock in the long term. In this study, 12 new cell lines were established using bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP4). BMP4 stimulated embryonic cells to enter the trophoblastic cell lineage but there were no significant differences between intact and BMP4-treated groups. Only one out of 49 embryos developed trophoblastic cells in the intact group. Finally, 12 cell lines were maintained for around 30 passages, and they retained trophoblastic characteristics and expressed bovine trophoblastic genes: placental lactogen, interferon-τ, pregnancy-associated glycoprotein 1, and prolactin-related protein 1. Although the gene expression patterns were different among cell lines and depended on the cells, there was no significant relationship between the expression intensities of genes and the treatment dose of BMP4. All of them expressed bovine POU domain class 5 transcription factor 1 and caudal-type homeobox 2. The expression of these genes was confirmed by quantitative RT-PCR and immunohistochemical detection. These results suggest that BMP4 is involved in the raising of trophoblast cell lines from early embryonic cells and the newly developed cell lines can provide different types of bovine trophoblastic cells with different cell lineages. This may constitute a significant new tool for the examination of trophoblastic differentiation.
Krüppel-like factor 5 (KLF5) is transcription factor that is expressed by dividing epithelial cells of the intestinal epithelium. KLF5 promotes proliferation in vitro and in vivo and is induced by mitogens and various stress stimuli. To study the role of KLF5 in intestinal epithelial homeostasis, we examined the phenotype of mice with conditional deletion of Klf5 in the gut.
Mice were generated with intestinal-specific deletion of Klf5 (Vil-Cre;Klf5fl/fl). Morphologic changes in the small intestine and colon were examined by immunohistochemistry, immunoblotting, and real-time polymerase chain reaction.
Klf5 mutant mice were born at a normal Mendelian ratio but had high mortality compared with controls. Complete deletion of Klf5 from the intestinal mucosa resulted in neonatal lethality that corresponded with an absence of epithelial proliferation. Variegated intestinal-specific deletion of Klf5 in adult mice resulted in morphologic changes that included a regenerative phenotype, impaired barrier function, and inflammation. Adult mutant mice exhibited defects in epithelial differentiation and migration. These changes were associated with reduced expression of Caudal type homeobox (Cdx) 1, Cdx2, and Eph and ephrin signaling proteins. Concomitantly, Wnt signaling to β-catenin was reduced. Proliferation in regenerative crypts was associated with increased expression of the progenitor cell marker Sox9.
Deletion of Klf5 in the gut epithelium of mice demonstrated that KLF5 maintains epithelial proliferation, differentiation, and cell positioning along the crypt radial axis. Morphologic changes that occur with deletion of Klf5 are associated with disruption of canonical Wnt signaling and increased expression of Sox9.
The intestinal expression of genes involved in carbohydrate digestion and absorption, such as sucrase-isomaltase (SI) and sodium-dependent glucose cotransporter (SGLT1), is higher in rodents fed a high-starch/low-fat (HS) diet than in those fed a low-starch/high-fat (LS) diet. In the present study, we investigated whether the HS diet-induced induction of SI and SGLT1 in the rat jejunum is coordinately regulated by nuclear transcription factors, histone acetylation, or histone acetyltransferases. HS diet intake induced jejunal expression of a histone acetyltransferase, general control of amino acid synthesis (GCN5), concurrently with the SI and SGLT1 genes; however, gene expression of nuclear transcription factors such as hepatocyte nuclear factor-1, caudal type homeobox-2, and GATA-binding protein-4 was unaffected by the HS diet. Acetylation of histones H3/H4 and binding of acetyltransferase GCN5 on the promoter/enhancer and transcribed regions of SI and SGLT1 genes were significantly higher in HS diet-fed rats than in LS diet-fed rats, but transcription factor binding was not affected by the HS diet. Our results suggest that the concomitant induction of SI and SGLT1 genes in the jejunum by the HS diet is closely associated with the binding of GCN5 and acetylation of histones H3/H4 on these genes.
In colorectal cancer, the functional impact of proteins from different signaling pathways varies between tumor center and tumor front. Our objective was to identify differential protein expression profiles between the tumor center and the tumor front of colorectal cancer. Twenty proteins from different signaling pathways (epidermal growth factor receptor [EGFR], phosphorylated extracellular signal regulated kinase [pERK], receptor for hyalouronic acid mediated motility [RHAMM], Raf-1 kinase inhibitor protein [RKIP], β-catenin, E-cadherin, phosphorylated AK transforming [pAKT], p16, p21, Ki-67, B-cell Lymphoma-2 [BCL2], vascular endothelial growth factor, apoptosis protease activating factor 1 [APAF-1], mucin1 [MUC1], ephrin B2 receptor [EphB2], matrix metalloproteinase 7 [MMP7], phosphorylated mothers against decapentaplegic 2 [pSMAD2], caudal type homeobox transcription factor 2 [CDX2], Laminin5γ2, and mammalian sterile 20-like kinase 1 [MST1]) involved in colorectal cancer progression were studied immunohistochemically on 220 well-characterized patients using a multiple-punch tissue microarray including 437 and 430 samples from the tumor center and the invasive front, respectively. Mean expression between the tumor center and the tumor front varied statistically significantly for pSMAD2, pERK, Raf-1 kinase inhibitor protein, E-cadherin, pAKT, BCL2, vascular endothelial growth factor, EphB2, matrix metalloproteinase 7, CDX2, Laminin5γ2, MST1, and APAF-1. Overexpression of pAKT, BCL2, vascular endothelial growth factor, APAF-1, pERK, EphB2, Raf-1 kinase inhibitor protein, CDX2, E-cadherin, MST1 (P &lt; .001 each), and pSMAD2 (P = .002) was more frequently observed in the tumor center, whereas matrix metalloproteinase 7 and Laminin5γ2 (P &lt; .001 each) overexpression was associated with the invasive front. In multivariate analysis, vascular endothelial growth factor (P &lt; .001), Raf-1 kinase inhibitor protein (P = .009), and Laminin5γ2 (P &lt; .001) were the most relevant proteins with the multimarker phenotypes positive/positive/negative and negative/negative/positive being most discriminating between the tumor center and the tumor front. Moreover, the combination negative/negative/positive vascular endothelial growth factor/Raf-1 kinase inhibitor protein/Laminin5γ2 at the tumor front was associated with vascular/lymphatic invasion (P = .014), distant metastasis (P = .019), higher tumor grade (P &lt; .001), and poorer survival (P = .05). Our findings show that, in colorectal cancer progression, vascular endothelial growth factor overexpression seems to play a role in the tumor center, whereas Laminin5γ2-positivity combined with Raf-1 kinase inhibitor protein loss is associated with tumor invasion at the front.
The hypothalamus comprises alar, basal, and floor plate developmental compartments. Recent molecular data support a rostrocaudal subdivision into rostral (terminal) and caudal (peduncular) halves. In this context, the distribution of neuronal populations expressing somatostatin (Sst) mRNA was analyzed in the developing mouse hypothalamus, comparing with the expression pattern of the genes Orthopedia (Otp), Distal-less 5 (Dlx5), Sonic Hedgehog (Shh), and Nk2 homeobox 1 (Nkx2.1). At embryonic day 10.5 (E10.5), Sst mRNA was first detectable in the anterobasal nucleus, a Nkx2.1-, Shh-, and Otp-positive basal domain. By E13.5, nascent Sst expression was also related to two additional Otp-positive domains within the alar plate and one in the basal plate. In the alar plate, Sst-positive cells were observed in rostral and caudal ventral subdomains of the Otp-positive paraventricular complex. An additional basal Sst-expressing cell group was found within a longitudinal Otp-positive periretromamillary band that separates the retromamillary area from tuberal areas. Apart of subsequent growth of these initial populations, at E13.5 and E15.5 some Sst-positive derivatives migrate tangentially into neighboring regions. A subset of cells produced at the anterobasal nucleus disperses ventralward into the shell of the ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus and the arcuate nucleus. Cells from the rostroventral paraventricular subdomain reach the suboptic nucleus, whereas a caudal contingent migrates radially into lateral paraventricular, perifornical, and entopeduncular nuclei. Our data provide a topologic map of molecularly defined progenitor areas originating a specific neuron type during early hypothalamic development. Identification of four main separate sources helps to understand causally its complex adult organization.
A 74-year-old male was admitted to Departments of Surgery, Toyonaka Municipal Hospital (Osaka, Japan) for treatment of a pancreatic tumor. Contrast enhanced computed tomography (CT) revealed a mass with small cystic lesions in the pancreatic head and body. Fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography/CT revealed an abnormal uptake of fluorodeoxyglucose, corresponding to the mass lesions. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy revealed rough mucosa near the opening of the accessory pancreatic duct, and the mucosa biopsy exhibited adenocarcinoma with no mucin observed. The preoperative diagnosis was pancreatic intraductal tubulopapillary neoplasm (ITPN) with cancerous lesions, and a total pancreatectomy with splenectomy was performed. The resected tissue specimen revealed a solid tumor occupying the entire pancreas with intraductal growth into the main pancreatic duct. Histological examination revealed high-grade dysplastic cells in a tubulopapillary growth pattern without overt mucin production beyond the pancreatic duct. Immunohistochemical staining analysis of the tumor was positive for cytokeratin (CK)7, CK19 and mucin (MUC)1, and negative for MUC2, MUC5AC, MUC6 and caudal type homeobox 2. The tumor was finally diagnosed as pancreatic ITPN with associated invasive cancer. The patient remains well without evident recurrence nine months post-surgery. ITPN is a rare type of epithelial neoplasm of the pancreas, and is characterized by intraductal tubulo-papillary growth, ductal differentiation, limited intracellular mucin production, and cellular dysplasia. The present case report may contribute to improved understanding of how to effectively treat patients with ITPN.
Loss of caudal type homeobox 2 (CDX2) is associated with the development of human colorectal cancer, while human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) frequently occurs in variety of human cancers. We investigated the effects of restoration of CDX2 expression using a hypoxia-inducible hTERT promoter-driven vector (pLVX-5HRE-hTERTp-CDX2-3FLAG) on colon cancer cell viability, cell cycle distribution, apoptosis, colony formation, invasion ability and xenograft tumor growth in nude mice. CDX2 overexpression significantly inhibited viability, colony formation, and the invasion and migration ability of LoVo cells, and induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in vitro, especially under hypoxic culture conditions. Overexpression of CDX2 under normoxic conditions significantly suppressed the expression of TGF-β, cyclin D1, uPA, MMP-9, MMP-2, and Bcl-2, and stimulated the expression of collagen IV, laminin-1, and Bax. Overexpression of CDX2 reduced colon cancer xenograft tumor formation in nude mice which was associated with downregulation of Ki-67. In conclusion, overexpression of CDX2 using a hypoxia-inducible hTERT promoter-driven vector suppressed malignant progression of colon cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. These results suggest that pLVX-5HRE-hTERTp-CDX2-3FLAG gene therapy may be a promising novel approach to treat colon cancer.
Esophageal metastasis from colorectal carcinoma is uncommon, and diagnosis of esophageal metastasis is difficult. We report a case of a 54-year-old woman with postoperative recurrence of rectal cancer metastasizing to the esophagus. She underwent rectectomy and adjuvant chemotherapy with fluorouracil, leucovorin plus oxaliplatin for stage IIIB rectal cancer. Three years later, she presented with dysphagia and cough. Computed tomography showed thickening of the esophagus wall, enlargement of the lymph nodes in the mediastinum and abdomen, and ground-glass opacities in the right lung. Endoscopy revealed a submucosal tumor of the midthoracic esophagus. Histopathological analysis of the tumor biopsy showed infiltration of adenocarcinoma cells into the stroma of the esophagus; tumor cells were positive for caudal type homeobox 2 and negative for thyroid transcription factor 1. A transbronchial biopsy indicated pulmonary lymphangitic carcinomatosis of rectal adenocarcinoma. Based on those findings, she was diagnosed with recurrent rectal cancer. She received fluorouracil-based chemotherapy plus bevacizumab, which ameliorated her symptoms and induced a durable response without severe adverse events. Diagnosis of esophageal metastasis from rectal cancer can thus be made by repeated biopsy. Furthermore, aggressive systemic treatment with fluorouracil-containing chemotherapy and bevacizumab is a treatment option for colorectal cancer patients with esophageal metastasis.
Pulmonary enteric adenocarcinoma is a markedly rare pathological type of lung adenocarcinoma. As the pancreas is a relatively uncommon site for metastasis, the present case is even more unusual. A 62-year-old male was admitted to hospital following the identification of masses in the left chest wall, right abdominal wall and right upper limb, but with no respiratory symptoms. Computed tomography (CT) of the chest revealed a lump in the lung and a mass in the left chest wall, and 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) uptake by the lumps was increased. An enhanced abdominal CT revealed a hypodense and homogeneous mass on the head of the pancreas, which was slightly enhanced compared with normal pancreatic tissue. In addition, the 18F-FDG uptake of the lesion was increased and the standardized uptake value (SUV) delayed was not evidently decreased compared with SUVearly. A number of other abnormal metabolic lesions were also identified using positron emission tomography/CT, whereas no abnormal 18F-FDG uptake was identified in the gastrointestinal organ. Furthermore, rectocolonoscopy was performed to exclude diagnosis of metastatic colorectal adenocarcinoma. The hematoxylin- and eosin-stained smears of the masses in the right lung and left chest demonstrated an enteric pattern, which shared morphological and immunohistochemical (IHC) features with those of colorectal adenocarcinoma. The IHC detection revealed that the lesions in the right lung were positive for cytokeratin 7 (CK7), and negative for CK20 and thyroid transcription factor 1 (TTF-1), and the expression of caudal type homeobox 2 (CDX2) was weakly positive; the masses in the left chest wall were positive for CK7, negative for TTF-1, and CK20 and CDX2 were weakly expressed.
Impairment in gut epithelial integrity and barrier function is associated with many diseases. The homeostasis of intestinal barrier is based on a delicate regulation of epithelial proliferation and differentiation. AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a master regulator of energy metabolism, and cellular metabolites are intrinsically involved in epigenetic modifications governing cell differentiation. We aimed to evaluate the regulatory role of AMPK on intestinal epithelial development and barrier function. In this study, AMPK activator (AICAR) improved the barrier function of Caco-2 cells as indicated by increased transepithelial electrical resistance and reduced paracellular FITC-dextran permeability; consistently, AICAR enhanced epithelial differentiation and tight junction formation. Transfection of Caco-2 cells with AMPK WT plasmid, which enhances AMPK activity, improved epithelial barrier function and epithelial differentiation, while K45R (AMPK dominant negative mutant) impaired; these changes were correlated with the expression of caudal type homeobox 2 (CDX2), the key transcription factor committing cells to intestinal epithelial lineage. CDX2 deficiency abolished intestinal differentiation promoted by AMPK activation. Mechanistically, AMPK inactivation was associated with polycomb repressive complex 2 regulated enrichment of H3K27me3, the inhibitory histone modification, and lysine-specific histone demethylase-1-mediated reduction of H3K4me3, a permissive histone modification. Those histone modifications provide a mechanistic link between AMPK and CDX2 expression. Consistently, epithelial AMPK knockout in vivo reduced CDX2 expression, impaired intestinal barrier function, integrity and ultrastructure of tight junction, and epithelial cell migration, promoted intestinal proliferation and exaggerated dextran sulfate sodium-induced colitis. In summary, AMPK enhances intestinal barrier function and epithelial differentiation via promoting CDX2 expression, which is partially mediated by altered histone modifications in the Cdx2 promoter.
Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disease of the colon with an intractable, recurrent course. Although the goal of UC therapy has recently been to target mucosal healing, the molecular mechanism of mucosal healing remains unknown. In this study, we aimed to elucidate the molecular dynamics related to the proliferation and differentiation of intestinal epithelial cells during cytapheresis therapy in a short duration.
Endoscopy was performed in 26 patients with UC in multicentre hospitals, and biopsy specimens were collected from the rectum before and within two weeks after leukocytapheresis (LCAP). The expression of representative proteins in intestinal epithelial cells and pathological findings was compared before and after LCAP.
The expression of caudal type homeobox 2 (CDX2) and a hes family bHLH transcription factor 1(HES1) markedly increased after LCAP. Patients with endoscopic improvement after LCAP showed the expression of CDX2 before LCAP. Moreover, the number of goblet cells significantly increased after LCAP. Patients without endoscopic improvement after LCAP did not show the expression of CDX2 before LCAP. However, the expression of CDX2 markedly increased after LCAP.
This study suggests that cytapheresis might induce CDX2 expression without affecting the cell proliferation, thus resulting in mucosal healing with goblet cell restoration.
Although the lack of CDX2 expression has recently been proposed as a potential biomarker for a high risk of relapse in patients with stage II and III colon cancer after complete surgical resection, its prognostic role in metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC) remains unclear and warrants investigation.
We identified 145 patients treated at our institution from 2006 to 2016, including 66 patients with CDX2-negative metastatic CRC and a comparison cohort of 79 patients with CDX2-positive metastatic CRC. Overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) for first-line systemic therapy were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. The associations of CDX2 expression with survival were evaluated using Cox proportional hazards regression models.
The prevalence of absent CDX2 expression in our cohort was 5.6%. Patients with CDX2-negative metastatic CRC were significantly more likely to be female, and to have right-sided primary tumors, poorly differentiated histologic features, and distant lymph node metastasis. The median OS for patients with CDX2-negative and -positive metastatic CRC was 8 and 39 months, respectively (hazard ratio [HR], 4.04; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.49-6.54; P &lt; .0001). After adjusting for covariates in a multivariate model, the association of a lack of CDX2 expression and OS remained statistically significant (HR, 4.52; 95% CI, 2.50-8.17; P &lt; .0001). In addition, the median PFS (3 vs. 10 months; HR, 2.23; 95% CI, 1.52-3.27; P &lt; .0001) for first-line chemotherapy was significantly decreased in patients with CDX2-negative metastatic CRC.
The results of the present study show that a lack of CDX2 expression in metastatic CRC is an adverse prognostic feature and a potential negative predictor of the response to chemotherapy.
Neurenteric cysts are rare central nervous system lesions derived from an endodermal origin. There is no consensus concerning pathogenesis because of the paucity of occurrences. We report an immunohistochemical study of 10 cases with neurenteric cysts and postulate its pathogenesis.
Ten patients underwent surgical treatment for neurenteric cysts from 1995 to 2015. We retrospectively reviewed clinical, radiologic, operative, and pathologic findings for these patients. Immunohistochemical stains were completed in all cases to distinguish cell type and origin.
Three cell types were identified: pseudostratified-ciliated, goblet-columnar, and simple cuboidal cells. All cases were positive for cytokeratin 7, and negative for cytokeratin 20, caudal-type homeobox 2, mucin 2, thyroid transcription factor 1, human chorionic gonadotropin, placental alkaline phosphatase, and cluster of differentiation 31. Four of them had positive staining for mucin 5AC, with expression only in goblet-columnar cells. According to the immunohistochemical results, the cells resembled the respiratory tract (pseudostratified-ciliated), stomach (goblet-columnar), and respiratory bronchioles (simple cuboidal). Seventy-five percent of cases with recurrence had a goblet-columnar component, emphasizing the importance of total resection of the cyst and complete pathologic examination.
We postulate that the cystic tumor was derived from multipotent endodermal cells that migrated and traveled along the neuroectoderm, with incomplete differentiation into various cell types as a result of an unsuitable microenvironment. Because the neurenteric canal was only the channel of migration rather than a component of the cysts, the term neuroendodermal cysts is more precise in presenting the embryopathogenesis.
The functions of POU class 5 transcription factor 1 (Oct-4) and caudal-type homeobox 2 (Cdx2) in the differentiation of the murine inner cell mass (ICM) and trophectoderm (TE) have been described in detail. However, little is known about the roles of OCT-4 and CDX2 in preimplantation bovine embryos. To elucidate their functions during early development in bovine embryos, we performed OCT-4 and CDX2 downregulation using RNA interference. We injected OCT-4- or CDX2-specific short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) into bovine zygotes. The rate of blastocyst development of OCT-4-downregulated embryos was lower compared with uninjected or control siRNA-injected embryos. Gene expression analysis revealed decreased CDX2 and fibroblast growth factor 4 expression in OCT-4-downregulated embryos. CDX2-downregulated embryos developed to the blastocyst stage; however, in most cases, blastocoel formation was delayed. Gene expression analysis revealed decreased GATA3 expression and elevated NANOG expression in CDX2-downregulated embryos. In conclusion, OCT-4 and CDX2 are essential for early development and gene expression involved in differentiation of ICM and TE lineages in bovine embryos.
Ovarian metastasis of colorectal cancer is relatively rare. The present study reports two cases of synchronous ovarian metastasis from colorectal cancer, which were managed by cytoreductive surgery. In case one, a 60-year-old female patient presented with a multilocular pelvic tumor and ascites. Virtual colonoscopy revealed a mass in the sigmoid colon; however, no tumor cells were identified on histological examination. Ovarian metastasis from sigmoid colon cancer was suspected and adnexectomy was subsequently performed. Histological examination of the excised tumor revealed adenocarcinoma. Immunohistochemical analysis of the resected tumor revealed positive staining for cytokeratin (CK)20 and caudal-type homeobox 2 (CDX2), and negative staining for CK7, estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor and inhibin. The immunohistological results supported the diagnosis of ovarian metastasis from sigmoid colon cancer. In case two, a 56-year-old female patient presented with a multilocular pelvic tumor and ascites. Colonoscopy identified a rectal tumor, and histological examination revealed moderately-differentiated adenocarcinoma, which was confirmed by cytological analysis of ascites. Subsequently, ovarian metastasis from rectal cancer with peritoneal dissemination was diagnosed, and left ovariectomy and transverse colostomy were performed. Histological examination of the excised tumor revealed moderately-differentiated adenocarcinoma, and immunohistochemical investigation revealed positive staining for CK20 and CDX2, but negative staining for CK7. These immunohistological results indicated ovarian metastasis from rectal cancer. Both patients recovered well and are currently undergoing regular follow-up examinations. The observations from the two cases indicate that ovarian metastases of primary colorectal cancer may present as pelvic tumors and, thus, preoperative examination of the gastrointestinal tract is required. Furthermore, even in cases of widespread colorectal cancer metastases, excision of the ovarian tumor is required to establish a histological diagnosis for the selection of appropriate treatments.
Mixed adenoneuroendocrine carcinomas (MANECs) are rare biphasic tumour types, which are morphologically recognisable as both gland-forming and neuroendocrine neoplasms. Within the gastrointestinal tract, MANECs occur predominantly in the stomach or colorectum. The present study described a case of a MANEC originating from the ampullary region. The patient presented with widespread metastatic disease. Biopsy samples obtained from the ampullary primary tumour disclosed a complex lesion with adenocarcinoma and neuroendocrine small cell carcinoma components, positive for the intestinal transcription factor caudal type homeobox-2 and for neuroendocrine markers, including chromogranin A, synaptophysin, cluster of differentiation 56/neural cell adhesion molecule. By contrast, biopsy samples obtained from metastatic tissue revealed pure neuroendocrine carcinoma. As exemplified by this true mixed tumour, tumour heterogeneity evolves as the major challenge in oncology today, with potentially severe implications for the choice of chemotherapy. The assessment of metastatic sites may render valuable diagnostic information that is crucial for clinical decision-making and patient management.
The most common pattern of recurrence of gastric cancer (GC) is peritoneal dissemination. However, rectal metastasis via hematogenous or lymphatic spread is exceedingly rare. We present a case of a 65-year-old man with an intramucosal GC who developed a rectal recurrence, possibly via a hematogenous route.
A 65-year-old man underwent curative endoscopic submucosal dissections for the intramucosal GCs at the anterior wall of the fornix twice. The third GC at the similar location was treated by radical laparoscopic proximal gastrectomy; microscopic examination revealed well-differentiated tubular adenocarcinoma confined to the lamina propria mucosae (T1aN0M0, stage IA). Follow-up colonoscopy revealed a 30-mm submucosal mass in the rectal wall 2 years later, and a metastasis of gastric origin was suspected histopathologically. After a staging laparoscopy confirmed the absence of findings suggestive of serosal involvement or peritoneal dissemination, including negative peritoneal washing cytology, a laparoscopic low anterior resection with lymph node dissection was performed. Microscopically, the tumor was found to mainly be located in the submucosal layer and showed features of moderately differentiated tubular adenocarcinoma. The serosal surface was free of disseminated tumor. Lymph node metastases were identified. Immunohistochemically, there were foci of carcinoma cells that were positive for cytokeratin 20; however, they were negative for cytokeratin 7. Negative staining for caudal-type homeobox 2, a transcription factor indicating goblet cell differentiation, combined with absence of intramucosal carcinoma in the rectal mucosa, suggested a diagnosis of metastatic adenocarcinoma of gastric origin. The absence of evidence of peritoneal dissemination suggested hematogenous or lymphatic spread.
Although rectal metastasis from GC, particularly when attributable to hematologic or lymphatic metastasis, is very rare, metastatic gastric adenocarcinoma should be considered as a differential diagnosis for patients who present with a rectal tumor and a past history of GC, even if it is an early GC.
We present a rare case of colorectal T1 carcinoma with metastasis of previous lung carcinoma found at the deepest invasive portion. A 61-year-old man presented with cervical lymphadenopathy 18 years after undergoing surgery for right lung carcinoma [poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma stage IIb (T3N0M0)]. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography showed enlarged lymph nodes (LNs) in the neck and mediastinal regions. Combined hybrid-F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission-computerized tomography showed increased radionuclide uptake in multiple cervical LNs and mediastinal LNs. LN biopsy revealed a poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma, suspected to be a metastatic tumor of the lung. Subsequent colonoscopy revealed a pedunculated-type lesion with a depressed area in the ascending colon. We performed polypectomy as total excisional biopsy; this tumor was composed mainly of moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma, partially mixed with mucinous adenocarcinoma. The pathological findings of the invasive front of the colorectal carcinoma showed poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma with a morphological pattern similar to that of the previous lung carcinoma. Furthermore, immunohistochemical results for the histological type of the deepest invasive portion of the tissue specimen were positive for thyroid transcription factor-1 but negative for Caudal-type homeobox 2. From these morphological and immunohistochemical findings, the final diagnosis was moderately differentiated lung carcinoma, pTX N3 M1b (LN, colon) Stage IV. 
Nutrient absorption mediated by nutrient transporters expressed in the intestinal epithelium supplies substrates to support intestinal processes, including epithelial cell proliferation. We evaluated the role of Caudal type homeobox 2 (CDX2), an intestine-specific transcription factor, in the proliferation of pig intestinal epithelial cells (IPEC-1) and searched for novel intestinal nutrient transporter genes activated by CDX2. Our cloned pig CDX2 cDNA contains a "homeobox" DNA binding motif, suggesting it is a transcriptional activator. CDX2 overexpression in IPEC-1 cells increased cell proliferation, the percentage of cells in S/G2 phase, and the abundance of transcripts of the cell cycle-related genes Cyclin A2; Cyclin B; Cyclin D2; proliferating cell nuclear antigen; and cell cycle cyclin-dependent kinases 1, 2 and 4, as well as the predicted CDX2 target genes SLC1A1, SLC5A1 and SLC7A7. In addition, luciferase reporter and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays revealed that CDX2 binds directly to the SLC7A7 promoter. This is the first report of CDX2 function in pig intestinal epithelial cells and identifies SLC7A7 as a novel CDX2 target gene. Our findings show that nutrient transporters are activated during CDX2-induced proliferation of normal intestinal epithelial cells. 
Barrett's esophagus (BE), a premalignant condition to Barrett's adenocarcinoma (BAC), is closely associated with chronic inflammation due to gastro-esophageal reflux. Caudal type homeobox 2 (CDX2), a representative marker of BE, is increased during the metaplastic and neoplastic transformation of BE. Nitric oxide (NO) has been proposed to be a crucial mediator of Barrett's carcinogenesis. We previously demonstrated that CDX2 might be induced directly under stimulation of large amounts of NO generated around the gastro-esophageal junction (GEJ) by activating epithelial growth factor receptor in a ligand-independent manner. Thus, we reviewed recent developments on the role of NO in Barrett's carcinogenesis. Notably, recent studies have reported that microbial communities in the distal esophagus are significantly different among groups with a normal esophagus, reflux esophagitis, BE or BAC, despite there being no difference in the bacterial quantity. Considering that microorganism components can be one of the major sources of large amounts of NO, these studies suggest that the bacterial composition in the distal esophagus might play an important role in regulating NO production during the carcinogenic process. Controlling an inflammatory reaction due to gastro-esophageal reflux or bacterial composition around the GEJ might help prevent the progression of Barrett's carcinogenesis by inhibiting NO production. 
Primary lung enteric adenocarcinoma is a rare type of invasive lung carcinoma. Its morphology and immunohistochemistry are those of colorectal carcinoma, but there is no associated primary colorectal carcinoma. The present study describes the case of a 53-year-old female who presented with an irritating cough and a mass around the right sternoclavicular joint. Comprehensive evaluation revealed involvement of the mediastinum, lungs, right sternoclavicular joint and right kidney. Biopsies from the mediastinal and right sternoclavicular joint tumors showed features of adenocarcinoma. Immunohistochemistry was positive for cytokeratin (CK)20 and caudal type homeobox transcription factor 2, and negative for CK7, thyroid transcription factor-1 and napsin A. Genotypic analysis identified the expression of wild-type epidermal growth factor receptor, Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog, serine/threonine-protein kinase B-Raf and UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 1-1. There was no expression of echinoderm microtubule-associated protein-like 4-anaplastic lymphoma kinase and a moderate expression of excision repair cross-complementation group 1, ribonucleoside-diphosphate reductase large subunit and tubulin β-3 chain. A strong expression of thymidylate synthase and 677TC genotype expression of methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase was observed. Gastroscopy, enteroscopy, colorectal colonoscopy and positron emission tomography-computed tomography failed to find evidence of a gastrointestinal malignancy and primary lung enteric adenocarcinoma was diagnosed. The presence of multiple metastases did not permit curative surgery. The patient was treated with 3 monthly cycles of the XELOX chemotherapy regimen; the response was poor with progression of supraclavicular lesions. Treatment was switched to the TP regimen for 4 monthly cycles, which resulted in a significant reduction in the size of the lung lesions; however, the supraclavicular lesion responded poorly to the treatment. The patient then received 2 cycles of the FOLFIRI regimen; however, the lung and right supraclavicular lesions progressed, causing increased right upper limb pain. The pain was alleviated by palliative surgery. Following surgery, the DP regimen was employed. Follow-up of the patient remains ongoing. The present findings suggest that the early diagnosis and treatment of primary lung enteric adenocarcinoma is likely to improve patient outcome.
Primary gastric squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is a very rare disease. The origin of this tumor remains unclear, although there are some hypotheses. A 60-year-old man consulted a previous physician complaining of upper abdominal pain. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy revealed type 2 gastric cancer, and the patient was referred to our hospital. After close examination, the patient was diagnosed as cStage IIA gastric adenocarcinoma, and distal gastrectomy was performed. Histochemical studies showed typical findings of SCC, and the tumor was surrounded by intestinal metaplasia. Immunohistochemical examination was positive for cytokeratin (CK) 5/6 and caudal-type homeobox protein 2 (CDX2) and negative for p63/p40.
The results of immunostaining for CK5/6 supported that this tumor was SCC, but the question why p63/p40 were negative and CDX2 was positive still remained. Concerning about the origin of p63/p40 and CDX2, it was suggested that the tumor cells were not derived from ectopic squamous epithelium but from intestinal metaplasia. And tumor cells looked like homogeneous and squamous metaplasia was not observed. These findings supported the idea that these tumor cells arose from stem cells in the intestinal metaplasia of the stomach.
Metastatic mucinous tumors present a diagnostic challenge for pathologists as tumor histomorphology is often nonspecific and optimal immunoprofiles are still under investigation.
To present a head-to-head comparison of special AT-rich sequence-binding protein 2 (SATB2) and caudal type homeobox 2 (CDX2) expression in a diverse array of primary mucinous tumors.
SATB2 and CDX2 immunohistochemical stains were performed on whole sections from 44 mucinous colorectal carcinomas and 175 noncolorectal mucinous tumors. A nuclear scoring system measuring intensity (0-3+) and percentage staining (0 = &lt;5%, 1 = 5%-49%, 2 = ≥50%) was implemented, producing an additive histologic score (H-score).
SATB2 demonstrated acceptable accuracy at low to moderate expression levels (H-scores of 1-4). With these H-score cutoffs, overall accuracy was greater than 90%. In contrast, CDX2's accuracy rivaled that of SATB2 only at an H-score of 5 (89.0%), as its specificity suffered at lower expression levels (&lt;70.0% at H-scores of 1-4). Using a moderate H-score cutoff of 3 or higher, significant differences for both sensitivity and specificity were identified between SATB2 and CDX2 ( P = .01 for sensitivity and P &lt; .001 for specificity), though these stains were near equivalent when each was interpreted as positive at its respective optimal H-score (SATB2 ≥ 3 and CDX2 = 5).
SATB2 is a more accurate marker of colorectal origin across a variety of expression levels compared with CDX2 when applied to mucinous tumors from a host of primary sites. However, these stains are near equivalent when each is interpreted at its optimal expression level.
Liver is a common location of colorectal metastasis, but intrabiliary growth of liver metastasis is not well recognized. Furthermore, intrabiliary metastasis that discovered over 10 years after excision has rarely been described.
An 80-year-old man was admitted due to the presence of a liver mass in segment 5 (S5) concomitant with elevated carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), and carbohydrate antigen (CA) 19-9. He underwent right hemicolectomy for colon cancer 12 years prior. Enhanced computed tomography (CT) showed dilated bile ducts with periductal enhancement in S5; hence, cholangiocarcinoma was suspected. Upon anterior segmentectomy, we observed that the cut surface of the specimen exhibited a yellowish-white tumor within the bile ducts. Histologically, the tumor formed within the papillary process, extended along the lumen, and replaced the normal bile duct epithelium. Immunohistochemical studies showed that the liver tumor and primary colon cancer were negative for cytokeratin (CK) 7 and positive for CK20 and Caudal-type homeobox transcription factor 2 (CDX-2). In addition, both tumors showed a same KRAS mutation. We diagnosed the liver tumor as liver metastasis recurrence from colon cancer.
Intrabiliary growth type of metastasis (IGM) is difficult to distinguish from cholangiocarcinoma, and sometimes develops long after surgery; thus, careful examination of a patient's history is needed in such cases.
Prognostic prediction of colorectal cancer (CRC) remains challenging because of its heterogeneity. Aberrant expression of caudal-type homeobox transcription factor 2 (CDX2) is strongly correlated with the prognosis of CRC.
Tissue samples of patients with CRC who underwent surgery in Xinhua Hospital (Shanghai, China) from January 2010 to January 2013 were collected. CDX2 expression was semiquantitatively evaluated via immunohistochemistry.
In total, 138 patients were enrolled in this study from a prospectively maintained institutional cancer database. The median follow-up duration was 57.5 months (interquartile range, 17.0-71.0 months). In the Cox proportional hazards model, low CDX2 expression combined with stage T4 CRC was significantly the worst prognostic factor for disease-free survival (hazard ratio = 7.020, 95% confidence interval = 3.922-12.564) and overall survival (hazard ratio = 5.176, 95% CI = 3.237-10.091). In the Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, patients with low CDX2 expression and stage T4 CRC showed significantly worse disease-free survival and overall survival than those with low CDX2 expression alone.
CDX2 expression combined with the T stage was more accurate for predicting the prognosis of CRC. Determining the prognosis of CRC using more than one variable is valuable in developing appropriate treatment and follow-up strategies.
The present study assessed the expression of solute carrier 6 member 1 (SLC6A1) in ovarian cancer (OC) tissues and evaluated the effect of silencing SLC6A1 or caudal type homeobox 2 (CDX2) on the proliferation, migration, and invasion of SK-OV-3 OC cells. The levels of caudal type homeobox 2 (CDX2) and SLC6A1 mRNA were also examined in OC SK-OV-3, OVCAR3 and A2780 cell lines. The mRNA levels of CDX2 and SLC6A1 in SK-OV-3 OC cells were assessed following transection with microRNA (miR) 133a mimics; the mRNA and protein levels of SLC6A1 were determined following the silencing of CDX2, and the mRNA expression of CDX2 was gauged following the silencing of SLC6A1. A luciferase reporter assay was performed to assess the effect of miR133a on the CDX2 and SLC6A1 3'-untranslated regions (3'UTRs). The proliferation, migration and invasion rate of SK-OV-3 cells were then examined following the silencing of CDX2 or SLC6A1. The expression of SLC6A1 was increased in OC compared with adjacent tissue. The expression of CDX2 and SLC6A1 in SK-OV-3 and OVCAR3 cells was increased compared with A2780 cells (P&lt;0.05). The level of CDX2 and SLC6A1 mRNA in SK-OV-3 cells decreased when the cells were transected with the miR133a mimics, compared with a negative control (P&lt;0.05). Transfection with the miR133a mimics significantly reduced the luciferase activity of reporter plasmids with the SLC6A1 or CDX2 3'UTRs (P&lt;0.05). The mRNA level of CDX2 was decreased subsequent to the silencing of SLC6A1; the mRNA and protein level of SLC6A1 were decreased when CDX2 was silenced (P&lt;0.05). The proliferation, migration, and invasion of SK-OV-3 cells were significantly reduced following the silencing of CDX2 or SLC6A1 (P&lt;0.05). CDX2 may therefore be inferred to promote the proliferation, migration and invasion in SK-OV-3 OC cells, acting as a competing endogenous RNA.
Signet ring cell carcinoma (SRCC) of the ovary is most commonly metastatic from a primary lesion. Primary ovarian SRCC is rare, and the distinction between primary and metastatic SRCC of the ovary may be difficult. We herein present a case of primary SRCC of the ovary in a 54-year-old woman presenting with a right ovarian mass sized 20.5×16.5×11.5 cm. Total abdominal hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, partial omentectomy and incidental appendectomy were performed. Upon histological examination, mucinous carcinoma composed predominantly of signet ring cells was observed in the right ovary. The results of immunohistochemical examination included diffuse positivity for cytokeratin (CK)7 and CK20, but the tumor was negative for estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, caudal type homeobox 2 and Wilms' tumor gene 1. A preoperative computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen and a postoperative positron emission tomography-CT scan did not reveal any suspicious extraovarian lesions. Based on the histological and clinicoradiological examinations, this case was diagnosed as a primary ovarian SRCC.
The aim of this study was to investigate the expression and significance of liver-intestine cadherin (LI-cadherin) and CDX2 (caudal-type homeobox transcription factor 2) in cytology specimens of metastatic gastrointestinal adenocarcinoma in serous cavity effusion.
The serous cavity effusion samples that were suspected of tumor metastasis in the last 5 years were made into paraffin-imbedded cell blocks, a total of 180 cases, including 97 cases of pleural effusion, 78 cases of ascites, and 5 cases of pericardial effusion. The expressions of LI-cadherin and CDX2 were detected by immunohistochemical staining in cell blocks and primary tumor tissues; thereafter, the specificity and sensitivity were analyzed.
The positive expressions of LI-cadherin and CDX2 in 63 cases of gastrointestinal adenocarcinoma cells were 65.1% (41/63), 61.9% (39/63), respectively. Of 11 cases of pancreaticobiliary duct cancers, only one case (9.09%) was weakly positive for LI-cadherin and CDX2 expressions, and 107 cases of non-digestive tract cancers were all negative. In 57 matched-pair samples of cell blocks and primary gastrointestinal adenocarcinoma tissues, the positive expressions of LI-cadherin and CDX2 were 64.9% (37/57), 61.4% (35/57), respectively, in cells, and 82.5% (47/57), and 77.2% (44/57), respectively, in tissues. Positive correlation was observed between the expressions of LI-cadherin and CDX2 in metastatic gastrointestinal adenocarcinoma cells (P&lt;0.05). Both LI-cadherin and CDX2 expressions demonstrated positive correlation in cells with paired cancer tissues (P&lt;0.05). The positive expression reached 80.7% with at least one positive marker in the total cell samples through combined detection of LI-cadherin and CDX2, increased by 15.8% and 19.3% compared with using either of the markers alone.
Combined use of LI-cadherin and CDX2 can improve the accuracy in the diagnosis of metastatic adenocarcinoma cells in serous cavity effusion and provide some bases of histologic origin because of their high sensitivity and specificity.
The type II membrane-anchored serine protease, matriptase, encoded by suppression of tumorgenicity-14 (ST14) regulates the integrity of the intestinal epithelial barrier in concert with its inhibitor, HAI-1 encoded by serine peptidase inhibitor, Kunitz type -1 (SPINT1). The balance of the protease/inhibitor gene expression ratio is vital in preventing the oncogenic potential of matriptase. The intestinal cell lineage is regulated by a transcriptional regulatory network where the tumor suppressor, Caudal homeobox 2 (CDX2) is considered to be an intestinal master transcription factor. In this study, we show that CDX2 has a dual function in regulating both ST14 and SPINT1, gene expression in intestinal cells. We find that CDX2 is not required for the basal ST14 and SPINT1 gene expression; however changes in CDX2 expression affects the ST14/SPINT1 mRNA ratio. Exploring CDX2 ChIP-seq data from intestinal cell lines, we identified genomic CDX2-enriched enhancer elements for both ST14 and SPINT1, which regulate their corresponding gene promoter activity. We show that CDX2 displays both repressive and enhancing regulatory abilities in a cell specific manner. Together, these data reveal new insight into transcriptional mechanisms controlling the intestinal matriptase/inhibitor balance.
Structural maintenance of chromosome flexible domain containing 1 (Smchd1) is a chromatin regulatory gene for which mutations are associated with facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy and arhinia. The contribution of oocyte- and zygote-expressed SMCHD1 to early development was examined in mice ( Mus musculus) using a small interfering RNA knockdown approach. Smchd1 knockdown compromised long-term embryo viability, with reduced embryo nuclear volumes at the morula stage, reduced blastocyst cell number, formation and hatching, and reduced viability to term. RNA sequencing analysis of Smchd1 knockdown morulae revealed aberrant increases in expression of a small number of trophectoderm (TE)-related genes and reduced expression of cell proliferation genes, including S-phase kinase-associated protein 2 ( Skp2). Smchd1 expression was elevated in embryos deficient for Caudal-type homeobox transcription factor 2 ( Cdx2, a key regulator of TE specification), indicating that Smchd1 is normally repressed by CDX2. These results indicate that Smchd1 plays an important role in the preimplantation embryo, regulating early gene expression and contributing to long-term embryo viability. These results extend the known functions of SMCHD1 to the preimplantation period and highlight important function for maternally expressed Smchd1 messenger RNA and protein.
Caudal-type homeobox 2 (CDX2) transcription factor is an important marker for early trophoblast lineages and intestinal epithelium. Due to its nuclear expression the immunostaining and sorting of viable CDX2pos cells is not possible. In this paper we report the generation and describe key characteristics of a CDX2Venus knock-in reporter hiPSC-cell line (MHHi007-A-1) which can serve as an in vitro tool to study human trophoblast and intestinal differentiation.
Caudal-type homeobox protein 2 (CDX-2) is an intestine-specific transcription factor (TF), with a polymorphic binding site (Cdx-2, rs11568820, A/G) in the vitamin D receptor gene (VDR). The molecular mechanism underlying Cdx-2 association with conditions like osteoporosis, which depends on intestinal VDR expression and calcium absorption, is believed to be due to higher affinity of CDX-2 for the ancestral A allele compared to the G allele. However, it is unclear why the polymorphism is associated with diseases like tuberculosis, which is dependent on VDR expression in immune cells that do not express CDX-2. This study aimed to explain Cdx-2 variant association with immune-related conditions. We hypothesised that the effect of Cdx-2 polymorphism on VDR expression in monocytes/macrophages, devoid of the CDX-2 TF, is indirect and dependent on circulating 25(OH)D3 and VDR methylation. Primary monocyte/macrophages from healthy donors (n = 100) were activated though TLR2/1 elicitation. VDR mRNA and 25(OH)D3 were quantified by RT-qPCR and LC-MS/MS, respectively. Genotyping and methylation analysis were done by pyrosequencing. AA vs. AG/GG showed reduced levels of 25(OH)D3 (P &lt; 0.010), higher VDR promoter methylation (P &lt; 0.050) and lower VDR mRNA induction (P &lt; 0.050). Analysis of covariance confirmed that the effect of Cdx-2 variants depends primarily on VDR methylation. Thus, VDR methylation may confound association studies linking VDR polymorphisms to disease.
Computational analysis and bioinformatics have significantly advanced the ability of researchers to process and analyze biological data. Molecular data from human and model organisms may facilitate drug target validation and identification of biomarkers with increased predictive accuracy. The aim of the present study was to investigate the function of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) using online databases, and to predict their regulatory mechanism. HCC-associated lncRNAs, their downstream transcription factors and microRNAs (miRNAs/miRs), as well as the HCC-associated target genes, were identified using online databases. HCC-associated lncRNAs, including HOX antisense intergenic RNA (HOTAIR) and metastasis-associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1 (MALAT1) were selected based on established databases of lncRNAs. The interaction between the HCC-associated lncRNAs and miRNAs (hsa-miR-1, hsa-miR-20a-5p) was predicted using starBase2.0. Signal transducer and activator of transcription 1, hepatocyte nuclear factor 4α (HNF4A), octamer-binding transcription factor 4, Nanog homeobox (NANOG), caudal type homeobox 2 (CDX2), DEAD-box helicase 5, brahma-related gene 1, MYC-associated factor X and MYC proto-oncogene, bHLH transcription factor have been identified as the transcription factors for HOTAIR and MALAT1 using ChIPBase. Additionally, CDX2, HNF4A, NANOG, ETS transcription factor, Jun proto-oncogene and forkhead box protein A1 were identified as the transcription factors for hsa-miR-1 and hsa-miR-20a-5p. CDX2, HNF4A and NANOG were the transcriptional factors in common between the lncRNAs and miRNAs. Cyclin D1, E2F transcription factor 1, epithelial growth factor receptor, MYC, MET proto-oncogene, receptor tyrosine kinase and vascular endothelial growth factor A were identified as target genes for the HCC progression, two of which were also the target genes of hsa-miR-1 and hsa-miR-20a-5p using the miRwalk and OncoDN. HCC databases. Additionally, these target genes may be involved in biological functions, including the regulation of cell growth, cell cycle progression and mitosis, and in disease progression, as demonstrated using DAVID clustering analysis. The present study aimed to predict a regulatory network of lncRNAs in HCC progression using bioinformatics analysis.
Approximately 15% of colorectal cancer (CRC) cases exhibit microsatellite instability (MSI), which appears to be associated with unique biological behavior. The present study presents a case of appendiceal carcinoma associated with MSI that responded well to adjuvant chemotherapy. Clinical, pathological and immunohistochemical (IHC) characteristics have been described. The 60-year-old male patient had suffered from recurrent lower abdominal pain associated with abdominal distention for 6 months; then, following an acute attack, he was subjected to laparoscopic appendectomy. The histopathological examination revealed moderately differentiated appendiceal adenocarcinoma with mucinous areas, without lymphovascular or perineural invasion. The IHC examination was positive for keratin-20 and caudal type homeobox 2, and negative for MutL Homolog 1, MutS Homolog (MSH) 2 and MSH-6. A postoperative colonoscopy revealed diverticulosis, without the presence of polyps or tumors. However, an abdominal axial computerized tomography scan revealed thickening of the distal portion of the appendix, increased density of the greater omentum, and metastases to the liver capsule, spleen and peritoneum. The treatment of choice was right hemicolectomy with peritoneal debulking, followed by 10 cycles of chemotherapy with 5-fluorouracil, leucovorin and oxaliplatin (FOLFOX regimen). After 5 years of follow-up, the patient remains in good condition, without clinical or radiological signs of recurrence. The good response to chemotherapy corresponds with the observations made in other colon cancers with MSI. Therefore, testing for MSI in appendiceal carcinomas may provide useful information on prognosis and predict response to chemotherapy.
Caudal type homeobox 2 (CDX2) has been well-established as a diagnostic marker for colorectal cancer (CRC); however, less is known about its regulation, particularly its potential interactions with the DNA repair proteins, adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) and β-catenin, in a non-transcriptional manner. In the present study, the protein expression of CDX2 was analyzed, depending on the expression of the DNA repair proteins, mismatch repair (MMR), O6-methylguanine DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) and excision repair cross-complementing 1 (ERCC1), and its importance in Wnt signaling was also determined. A total of 101 liver metastases were punched into tissue microarray (TMA) blocks and serial sections were cut for immunohistochemistry. For each protein, an immunoreactive score was generated according to literature data and the scores were fitted to TMA. Subsequently, statistical analysis was performed to compare the levels of expression with each other and with clinical data. CDX2 loss of expression was observed in 38.5% of the CRC liver metastasis cases. A statistically significant association between CDX2 and each of the investigated MMRs was observed: MutL Homolog 1 (P&lt;0.01), MutS protein Homolog (MSH) 2 (P&lt;0.01), MSH6 (P&lt;0.01), and postmeiotic segregation increased 2 (P=0.040). Furthermore, loss of MGMT and ERCC1 was also associated with CDX2 loss (P=0.039 and P&lt;0.01, respectively). In addition, CDX2 and ERCC1 were inversely associated with metastatic tumor size (P=0.038 and P=0.027, respectively). Sustained CDX2 expression was associated with a higher expression of cytoplasmic/membranous β-catenin and with nuclear APC expression (P=0.042 and P&lt;0.01, respectively). In conclusion, CDX2 loss of expression was not a rare event in liver metastasis of CRC and the results suggested that CDX2 may be involved in mechanisms resulting in the loss of DNA repair protein expression, and in turn methylation; however, its exact function in this context remains to be elucidated.
In 2014 World Health Organization criteria, seromucinous carcinoma was defined as a new histological subtype in ovarian carcinomas, but "seromucinous carcinoma" was not defined in endometrial carcinomas. The aim of this study was to identify seromucinous carcinoma resembling ovarian seromucinous carcinoma in endometrial carcinomas, and to evaluate the clinical significance for prognoses of the patients.
Central pathological review was conducted for patients with endometrioid carcinoma of the endometrium treated by primary surgery at our hospital between 1990 and 2013.
Among 340 cases included in the study, no case had all tumor cells resembling ovarian seromucinous carcinoma in all specimens, and 31 cases (9.1%) had seromucinous component in combination with endometrioid carcinomas. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed seromucinous component had positive reactivity for cytokeratin (CK) 7, and negative reactivity for CK20 and caudal type homeobox 2 (CDX2) in all cases. Seromucinous component showed lower immunoreactivity of estrogen receptor and progesterone receptor, compared with endometrioid carcinoma component. Progression-free survival of the cases with seromucinous component was better than those without seromucinous component (p=0.049).
Seromucinous component was identified in approximately 10% of endometrioid carcinoma, and could be a histological predictor for prognosis.
A 78-year-old man underwent a detailed examination by upper gastrointestinal endoscopy for the complaint of epigastric pain. The examination revealed a hemicircumferential type 2 tumor in the descending duodenum. A subsequent biopsy led to a diagnosis of neuroendocrine carcinoma. Subtotal stomach-preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy was performed. The lesion was composed of small- and large-cell neuroendocrine carcinomas. The large-cell type component was positive for both caudal homeobox protein 2 and the cluster of differentiation 138, whereas the small-cell type component was negative for both. Our report may provide valuable information regarding the pathogenesis of neuroendocrine carcinoma.
Caudal type homeobox 2 (CDX2) is expressed in intestinal epithelial cells and plays a role in gut development and homeostasis by regulating cell proliferation. However, whether CDX2 cooperates with the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) and Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathways to stimulate cell proliferation remains unknown. The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of CDX2 on the proliferation of porcine jejunum epithelial cells (IPEC-J2) and the correlation between CDX2, the mTORC1 and Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathways. CDX2 overexpression and knockdown cell culture models were established to explore the regulation of CDX2 on both pathways. Pathway-specific antagonists were used to verify the effects. The results showed that CDX2 overexpression increased IPEC-J2 cell proliferation and activated both the mTORC1 and Wnt/β-catenin pathways, and that CDX2 knockdown decreased cell proliferation and inhibited both pathways. Furthermore, the mTORC1 and Wnt/β-catenin pathway-specific antagonist rapamycin and XAV939 (3,5,7,8-tetrahydro-2-[4-(trifluoromethyl)]-4H -thiopyrano[4,3-d]pyrimidin-4-one) both suppressed the proliferation of IPEC-J2 cells overexpressing CDX2, and that the combination of rapamycin and XAV939 had an additive effect. Regardless of whether the cells were treated with rapamycin or XAV939 alone or in combination, both mTORC1 and Wnt/β-catenin pathways were down-regulated, accompanied by a decrease in CDX2 expression. Taken together, our data indicate that CDX2 stimulates porcine intestinal epithelial cell proliferation by activating the mTORC1 and Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathways.
Although the intestine plays the major role in 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1,25(OH)2D3] action on calcium homeostasis, the mechanisms involved remain incompletely understood. The established model of 1,25(OH)2D3-regulated intestinal calcium absorption postulates a critical role for the duodenum. However, the distal intestine is where 70% to 80% of ingested calcium is absorbed. To test directly the role of 1,25(OH)2D3 and the vitamin D receptor (VDR) in the distal intestine, three independent knockout (KO)/transgenic (TG) lines expressing VDR exclusively in the ileum, cecum, and colon were generated by breeding VDR KO mice with TG mice expressing human VDR (hVDR) under the control of the 9.5-kb caudal type homeobox 2 promoter. Mice from one TG line (KO/TG3) showed low VDR expression in the distal intestine (&lt;50% of the levels observed in KO/TG1, KO/TG2, and wild-type mice). In the KO/TG mice, hVDR was not expressed in the duodenum, jejunum, kidney, or other tissues. Growth arrest, elevated parathyroid hormone level, and hypocalcemia of the VDR KO mice were prevented in mice from KO/TG lines 1 and 2. Microcomputed tomography analysis revealed that the expression of hVDR in the distal intestine of KO/TG1 and KO/TG2 mice rescued the bone defects associated with systemic VDR deficiency, including growth plate abnormalities and altered trabecular and cortical parameters. KO/TG3 mice showed rickets, but less severely than VDR KO mice. These findings show that expression of VDR exclusively in the distal intestine can prevent abnormalities in calcium homeostasis and bone mineralization associated with systemic VDR deficiency.
To investigate the effects and possible mechanisms of action of Curcuma wenyujin Y. H. Chen et C. Ling n-Butyl alcohol extract (CWNAE) on repression of human gastric cancer (GC) AGS cell invasion induced by co-culturing with Helicobacter pylori (HP).
AGS cells were cultured with HP of positive or negative cytotoxin-associated gene A (CagA) and vacuolating cytotoxin gene A (VacA) expression (CagA+/- or VacA+/-) and divided into 5 group. Group A was cultured without HP as a control, Group B with HPCagA+VacA+, Group C with HPCagA-VacA-, Group D with HPCagA+VacA+ and CWNAE, and Group E with HPCagA-VacA- and CWNAE. Methylthiazolyldiphenyl-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) and tumor invasion assays, examinations of morphology and ultramicroscopic structures, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and Western blots were performed to measure the effects and uncover the mechanisms behind these effects of HPCagA+VacA+ and CWNAE on the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of AGS cells.
The 10% inhibitory concentration of CWNAE against AGS cells after a 48 h incubation was 19.73±1.30 μg/mL. More AGS cells were elongated after co-culturing with HPCagA+VacA+ than after culturing with HPCagA-VacA-. In tumor invasion assays, HPCagA+VacA+ significantly enhanced the invasiveness of AGS cells compared to the other experimental groups (all P value &lt;0.05), and this effect was inhibited by CWNAE. Treatment with CWNAE normalized tight junctions and reduced the number of pseudopodia of AGS cells co-cultured with HPCagA+VacA+. HPCagA+VacA+ up-regulated zincfinger ebox binding homeobox 1 (ZEB1) in AGS cells after co-culturing for 24 h. Expression of caudal type homeobox transcription factor (CDX-2) and claudin-2 was significantly increased by HPCagA+VacA+ (P&lt;0.05), but not by HPCagA-VacA-.
HPCagA+VacA+ promoted the invasiveness of AGS cells through up-regulation of ZEB1 transcription and claudin-2 and CDX-2 expression. CWNAE inhibited these effects of HPCagA+VacA+ on AGS cells by down-regulating ZEB1 transcription, and CDX-2 and claudin-2 expression.
The marine bacterium Microbulbifer degradans strain 2-40 produces at least 10 enzyme systems for degrading insoluble complex polysaccharides (ICP). The draft sequence of the 2-40 genome allowed a genome-wide analysis of the chitinolytic system of strain 2-40. The chitinolytic system includes three secreted chitin depolymerases (ChiA, ChiB, and ChiC), a secreted chitin-binding protein (CbpA), periplasmic chitooligosaccharide-modifying enzymes, putative sugar transporters, and a cluster of genes encoding cytoplasmic proteins involved in N-acetyl-D-glucosamine (GlcNAc) metabolism. Each chitin depolymerase was detected in culture supernatants of chitin-grown strain 2-40 and was active against chitin and glycol chitin. The chitin depolymerases also had a specific pattern of activity toward the chitin analogs 4-methylumbelliferyl-beta-D-N,N'-diacetylchitobioside (MUF-diNAG) and 4-methylumbelliferyl-beta-D-N,N',N"-triacetylchitotrioside (MUF-triNAG). The depolymerases were modular in nature and contained glycosyl hydrolase family 18 domains, chitin-binding domains, and polycystic kidney disease domains. ChiA and ChiB each possessed polyserine linkers of up to 32 consecutive serine residues. In addition, ChiB and CbpA contained glutamic acid-rich domains. At 1,271 amino acids, ChiB is the largest bacterial chitinase reported to date. A chitodextrinase (CdxA) with activity against chitooligosaccharides (degree of polymerization of 5 to 7) was identified. The activities of two apparent periplasmic (HexA and HexB) N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidases and one cytoplasmic (HexC) N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase were demonstrated. Genes involved in GlcNAc metabolism, similar to those of the Escherichia coli K-12 NAG utilization operon, were identified. NagA from strain 2-40, a GlcNAc deacetylase, was shown to complement a nagA mutation in E. coli K-12. Except for the GlcNAc utilization cluster, genes for all other components of the chitinolytic system were dispersed throughout the genome. Further examination of this system may provide additional insight into the mechanisms by which marine bacteria degrade chitin and provide a basis for future research on the ICP-degrading systems of strain 2-40.
Mitotic checkpoint impairment is present in human lung cancers with chromosomal instability (CIN). Spindle-checkpoint genes have been reported to be mutated in several human cancers, but these mutations are infrequent. Recent reports suggest that the hBUBR1 gene may play an important role in mitotic checkpoint control and in mitotic checkpoint impairment in human cancers. We analyzed the expression of hBUBR1 in lung cancer cell lines using real time quantitative RT-PCR. The expression of BUBR1 was found to be up-regulated in all of these cell lines. In addition, we cloned and characterized the promotor region of hBUBR1 and determined its genomic structure, which includes 23 exons. The open reading frame (ORF) of the hBUBR1 gene comprises exons 1 through 23. There are GC-rich regions located at the flanking region and about 150 bp upstream from exon 1. The promoter region (424 bp upstream from exon 1) showed promoter activity and includes multiple transcription factor consensus binding motifs, including those for Sp1, Nkx-2, CdxA, SRY, MyoD, Ik-2, HNF-3b, Staf, Oct-1, Nkx-2, v-Myb, and AML 1a. Multiple pathways leading to activation of those binding factors may contribute to hBUBR1 gene transcription. Knowledge of the genomic structure and the promoter region of the hBUBR1 gene will facilitate investigation of its role in mitotic checkpoint control and tumor progression in human cancers.
Initiation of Hox genes requires interactions between numerous factors and signaling pathways in order to establish their precise domain boundaries in the developing nervous system. There are distinct differences in the expression and regulation of members of Hox genes within a complex suggesting that multiple competing mechanisms are used to initiate their expression domains in early embryogenesis. In this study, by analyzing the response of HoxB genes to both RA and FGF signaling in neural tissue during early chick embryogenesis (HH stages 7-15), we have defined two distinct groups of Hox genes based on their reciprocal sensitivity to RA or FGF during this developmental period. We found that the expression domain of 5' members from the HoxB complex (Hoxb6-Hoxb9) can be expanded anteriorly in the chick neural tube up to the level of the otic vesicle following FGF treatment and that these same genes are refractory to RA treatment at these stages. Furthermore, we showed that the chick caudal-related genes, cdxA and cdxB, are also responsive to FGF signaling in neural tissue and that their anterior expansion is also limited to the level of the otic vesicle. Using a dominant negative form of a Xenopus Cdx gene (XcadEnR) we found that the effect of FGF treatment on 5' HoxB genes is mediated in part through the activation and function of CDX activity. Conversely, the 3' HoxB genes (Hoxb1 and Hoxb3-Hoxb5) are sensitive to RA but not FGF treatments at these stages. We demonstrated by in ovo electroporation of a dominant negative retinoid receptor construct (dnRAR) that retinoid signaling is required to initiate expression. Elevating CDX activity by ectopic expression of an activated form of a Xenopus Cdx gene (XcadVP16) in the hindbrain ectopically activates and anteriorly expands Hoxb4 expression. In a similar manner, when ectopic expression of XcadVP16 is combined with FGF treatment, we found that Hoxb9 expression expands anteriorly into the hindbrain region. Our findings suggest a model whereby, over the window of early development we examined, all HoxB genes are actually competent to interpret an FGF signal via a CDX-dependent pathway. However, mechanisms that axially restrict the Cdx domains of expression, serve to prevent 3' genes from responding to FGF signaling in the hindbrain. FGF may have a dual role in both modulating the accessibility of the HoxB complex along the axis and in activating the expression of Cdx genes. The position of the shift in RA or FGF responsiveness of Hox genes may be time dependent. Hence, the specific Hox genes in each of these complementary groups may vary in later stages of development or other tissues. These results highlight the key role of Cdx genes in integrating the input of multiple signaling pathways, such as FGFs and RA, in controlling initiation of Hox expression during development and the importance of understanding regulatory events/mechanisms that modulate Cdx expression.
Mouse GLUT5 cDNA and a 7.7-kb genomic fragment have been isolated and characterized. The cDNA sequence suggests mouse GLUT5 is composed of 501 amino acids, and has 69-88% amino acid identity with human, rat, and rabbit GLUT5. Expression of mouse GLUT5 cRNA in Xenopus laevis oocytes showed that GLUT5 mediated fructose transport, with a K(t) of 13 mM. Northern blot studies detected GLUT5 mRNA expression in mouse small intestine, kidney, and testis, with transcript sizes of approximately 2.1, 2.1, and 2.8 kb, respectively. 5'Rapid Amplification of cDNA Ends (5'RACE) determined that the differences in transcript sizes occurred because GLUT5 possessed alternative transcriptional initiation sites in somatic and germ cells. In agreement with studies in rats and rabbits, mouse small intestinal GLUT5 mRNA expression levels were increased following exposure to a 65% fructose-enriched diet. In addition, developmental studies showed a significant increase in GLUT5 mRNA expression levels in adult mouse testis when compared to prepubertal mouse testis. To begin to identify the cis-acting domains responsible for GLUT5 expression characteristics, a 7.7-kb GLUT5 genomic fragment was isolated from a mouse lambda fix11 library and sequenced. The clone contained exons 1-4 and 5' flanking regions. Moreover, caudal homeobox gene (CdxA), upstream stimulatory factor (USF), and sex-determining region of Y (SRY) binding sites were identified in the 5' flanking region that may be responsible for GLUT5's expression characteristics: tissue distribution, sensitivity to dietary fructose in the small intestine, and developmental expression in the testis.
The small intestine of the chicken undergoes intensive changes in the immediate posthatch period, increasing in size and developing crypts, villi and mature enterocytes. During this time, chicks are also transferring from nutrition based on the lipid-rich yolk to exogenous carbohydrate-rich feeds. The cdx homeobox genes participate in axial patterning and in definition of cell identity in embryos, and some cdx genes remain active postpartum in organs such as the intestine. In this study, the transcription patterns of two of these genes, cdxA and cdxB, were examined in the small intestine of the embryo and posthatch chick; in addition, the effects on these genes of starving for 48 h at hatch were examined. Both cdx transcription factors were upregulated toward the time of hatch and were observed in proliferating enterocytes; this enhanced expression continued posthatch. Distribution of cdxA changed with age and was found at higher concentrations in mature enterocytes. Starving from 0 to 48 h posthatch retarded growth and decreased enterocyte proliferation and expression of cdxA and cdxB. After access to feed, expression of cdx genes was enhanced. Chicken homeobox genes cdxA and cdxB are expressed in all enterocytes during embryonic and posthatch development; however, cdxA may have a role in enterocyte maturation posthatch. CdxB was expressed later in development then previously reported.
Na(+)/H(+) exchanger (NHE) isoforms NHE2 and NHE3, colocalized to the brush border membrane of the epithelial cells, exhibit differences in their pattern of tissue expression and regulation by various molecular signals. To investigate the mechanisms involved in regulation of NHE3 gene expression, the human NHE3 promoter region was cloned and characterized. Primer extension experiments located the transcription start site to a position 116 nucleotides upstream from the translation start codon. The 5'-flanking region lacked a CCAAT box but contained a TATA-like sequence. Nucleotide sequencing of the 5'-flanking region revealed the presence of a number of cis elements including Sp1, AP-2, MZF-1, CdxA, Cdx-2, steroid and nonsteroid hormone receptor half sites, and a phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-response element. Transient transfection experiments using C2/bbe cell line defined a maximal promoter activity in -95/+5 region. The regulatory response elements clustered within this region include a potential transcription factor IID (TF IID), a CACCC, two Sp1, and two AP-2 motifs. Deletion of a fragment containing the AP-2 and Sp1 motifs resulted in a drastic decrease in promoter activity. In gel mobility shift assays, an oligonucleotide spanning from -78 to -56 bp bound a recombinant AP-2, and the corresponding binding activity in nuclear extracts was supershifted with anti-AP2alpha antibody. Our studies suggest that the NHE3 expression is regulated by a combination of cis elements and their cognate transcription factors that include the AP-2 and Sp1 family members.
In this study, we set out to test the ability of endoderm from 1.5-day-old chick embryos (just before digestive tube formation) to develop region-specific characteristics when cultured heterotopically. Various parts of the 1.5-day endoderm were cultured in combination with the flank somatic mesoderm of 3- to 3.5-day chick embryos, and these cultures were analyzed for the expression of several transcription factors and the differentiation of the endoderm. By 1.5 days of normal development, the transcription factors, which are expressed in specific digestive organs, cSox2, CdxA, and cHoxb9/a13 were already expressed in the endodermal cells of the presumptive areas of their later expression domains. When 1.5-day pre-gut endoderm was cultured for 14-15 days, it showed specific differentiation into appropriate organ structures. In general, the more anterior part of the pre-gut endoderm formed the more rostral digestive organ structures while the posterior part became the caudal gut. The differentiation of these regions of endoderm matches their normal fate as recently elucidated (Matsushita [1996a] Rouxs Arch. Dev. Biol. 205:225-231; Matsushita [1999] Dev. Growth Differ. 41:313-319). Expression of cSox2, CdxA, and cHoxb9/a13 in endoderm cultured for 4-5 days is also consistent with their normal fate. Thus, each part of the pre-gut endoderm appears to be already regionally committed to some extent, in accordance with its fate by 1.5 days of development.
Quantitative ultrasound (QUS) devices provide portable, easy-to-operate, low-cost options for point-of-care screening of bone mineral density (BMD). Community pharmacists should be aware of the precision, sensitivity, and specificity of these devices prior to their purchase.
To determine the precision, sensitivity, and specificity of the Achilles Express ultrasonometer compared with central dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (cDXA) as well as its utility as a bone density screening device in the community pharmacy setting.
A prospective study in a community pharmacy and outpatient ambulatory clinic was conducted with 2 groups of white women. Group 1 participants were 25-35 years of age (young, healthy), and those in Group 2 were 45 years of age or older (postmenopausal). BMD assessments of the spine and the nondominant wrist and hip were performed using cDXA. Assessments of the heel were performed using the Achilles Express, a QUS device. The main outcome measures were correlation of t-scores between cDXA and QUS measurements using the Pearson correlation test.
Twenty-two (30 +/- 4 years of age) and 31 (55 +/- 17 years of age) women were enrolled into Groups 1 and 2, respectively. Significant correlations between QUS and hip and spine cDXA t-scores were found in both groups. Correlation coefficients for QUS versus hip cDXA were 0.51 (95% CI 0.11 to 0.77) and 0.70 (95% CI 0.46 to 0.85) in Groups 1 and 2, respectively. Correlation coefficients for the QUS versus spine cDXA were 0.64 (95% CI 0.31 to 0.84) and 0.60 (95% CI 0.31 to 0.79) in Groups 1 and 2, respectively. The QUS device has a sensitivity level of 88% and specificity of 71% to detect a hip cDXA t-score of less than-1.
The Achilles Express ultrasonometer is a reasonable screening tool to detect low BMD in postmenopausal women.
Determination of the developmental fate in the small intestinal epithelium of the chicken embryo has not been fully analyzed up to the present. This study was carried out to analyze the determination time of the developmental fate of the small intestinal epithelium under the influence of other mesenchymes. The small intestinal epithelium reassociated and cultivated with the proventricular or gizzard mesenchyme or the dermis expressed chicken intestinal fatty acid binding protein, sucrase and CdxA as occurs during the normal development of the small intestinal epithelium. The presumptive intestinal endoderm taken from an earlier stage embryo and associated and cultivated with the proventricular or gizzard mesenchyme, showed gene expression patterns which were the same as those found in normal development. However, when the dermis was associated, the epithelium expressed sonic hedgehog, but never expressed intestinal epithelial- or stomach epithelial-markers. These results indicate that the determination of the developmental fate in the small intestinal epithelium and acquisition of autodifferentiation potency occur at the early stage of the gut development. Moreover the presumptive intestinal endoderm needs the supportive influence of the gut mesenchyme in order to differentiate fully into the intestinal epithelium.
We analyzed an extended core promoter regions covering [-70,+60] segment relative to the transcription start site of human promoters contained in the Eukaryotic Promoter Database. The analysis was made by using the Match program ver. 1.9 with an optimized setting and the TRANSFAC Professional database ver. 7.2. This analysis revealed that the most common transcription factor binding site in the examined collection of core promoters appears to be initiator (characterized by GEN_INI), which is expected. The other less obvious sites found were Spz1, E2F-1, ZF5, and C/EBP. The 'cap' site was also in this most common group. Over-representation of these sites relative to the non-promoter background data ranged from 0.3167 to 32.1645. These sites were characterized by being present in more than 60% of promoter sequences. Interestingly, the TATA-box has been found in only 11.63% of all examined promoters. The study is complemented by separate analyses of promoter groups having different GC content. These additional analyses revealed that the most common promoter elements found also include AP-2, CdxA, Pax-2, SRY, STAT1 and STAT5A. It was also observed that a number of promoter elements show strong preference either for the GC-rich or the GC-poor core promoters.
To review the literature concerning the utility of point-of-care (POC) testing devices for the diagnosis and management of osteoporosis.
Articles were identified from a MEDLINE search (1993-June 2003). Additional references were obtained from cross-referencing the bibliographies of selected articles.
After evaluation of clinical trials and select review articles, articles comparing peripheral dual-energy absorptiometry (pDXA) or quantitative ultrasound (QUS) with central DXA (cDXA) measurements were emphasized in this analysis.
Sensitivity for detecting osteoporosis by QUS or pDXA varies widely (range 35-75%). Using adjusted T-score cutoffs increases sensitivity to 85-95%, at the price of reducing device specificity to 23-49%. Many states require a radiology technician to perform pDXA tests.
POC testing with peripheral devices should only be considered in areas with limited access to cDXA or for women who initially refuse cDXA testing. T scores of-1.0 or less with POC testing typically require further evaluation via cDXA. Many states require pDXAs to be performed by certified radiology technologists, making QUS use more feasible for pharmacists. POC testing should not be used for assessing response to osteoporosis therapy.
The genomic structure of Tetraodon fluviatilis L29 gene was determined and its promoter activity was analyzed in COS-1 cells and zebrafish embryos. The TfL29 gene comprises four exons and three introns, spanning approximately 1.7kb. The 5(')-upstream 2.2-kb of the first exon contains 10 E-boxes and many putative binding motifs for transcription factors GATA-1, AML-1a, c-Myb, Oct-1, CdxA, and NRF-2. Promoter activity assay showed that the distal 2.2-kb fragment not only had high luciferase activity in COS-1 cells, but also strong and ubiquitous GFP expression in a variety of tissues in zebrafish embryos. On the other hand, there are no TATA or CAAT boxes within a 300-bp region upstream from the transcription initiation site. Although this region has high luciferase activity in COS-1 cells, it is not sufficient to drive GFP expression in zebrafish embryos. In this proximal 300-bp region, there are two E-boxes, two CdxA sites, and one NRF-2 site that is immediately downstream of the transcription start site.
Ingestion of carbohydrates from the small intestine is the major route of energy supply in animals. In mammals these functions develop both pre- and postnatally and are coordinated for the sucking period. In birds, the physiological requirements are different and hatchlings ingest diets rich in complex carbohydrates soon after hatching. The present study examined the ontogeny of intestinal carbohydrate uptake in the chicken. The expression of mRNA for a brush border enzyme, sucrase-isomaltase (SI), which is critical in disaccharide digestion, was determined, together with that of the Na-glucose transporter (SGLT)-1, which is the major apical glucose transporter, In addition, the homeobox gene cdx, which is involved in inducing SI expression in mammals was examined. It was found that the expression of cdxA mRNA and cdxA protein increased from day 15 of incubation until hatch, after which further changes were small. CdxA protein was shown to bind to the promoter region of SI in the chick indicating that cdxA is similar to the mammalian cdx2. The mRNA of SI was observed at 15 d incubation, increased from 17 d of incubation to a peak on day 19, decreased at hatch and had a further peak of expression 2 d post-hatch. In contrast, the mRNA of SGLT-1 was not detected until 19 d of incubation when a major peak of expression was observed followed by a decrease to low levels at hatch and small increases post-hatch. It appears that both SI and SGLT-1 mRNA are expressed before hatch in the chick, but the ontogeny of expression is controlled by different mechanisms.
Expression of the Xenopus Xcad-1 and Xcad-2 genes initiates during early gastrulation exhibiting a dorsoventral asymmetry in their domains of transcription. At mid-gastrulation the ventral preference becomes stronger and the caudal genes take up a posterior localization in their expression, which they will maintain until their downregulation along the dorsal midline. Comparison of the three Xenopus caudal genes revealed a temporal and spatial nested set of expression patterns. The transcription of the caudal genes is sequentially downregulated with the one expressed most caudally (Xcad-2) being shut down first, this sequence is most evident along the dorsal midline. This pattern of expression suggests a role for the caudal genes as posterior determinants along the anteroposterior axis. In chicken, mouse, man and Xenopus three members of the caudal family have been identified in the genome. Even though in Xenopus the Xcad-3 gene has been previously described, in order to obtain a better insight on the role of the caudal genes a comparative study of all three frog genes was performed.
CdxA, a chicken homeobox-containing gene related to caudal in Drosophila, has been implicated in the regionalization of endoderm. It is reported here that, in the development of the chicken embryo, CdxA expression appears in the endoderm at day 1.5 of development as bilateral bands on either side of the splanchnopleure which later contribute to intestinal epithelium. The CdxA-expressing area extends medially and caudally as formation of the gut tube progresses. It is also shown that the rostral limit of CdxA expression demarcates the boundary between stomach and duodenum after day 3 of development. CdxA is not expressed in digestive tract appendages which open into the intestine, such as pancreas, liver and allantois. Early restriction of CdxA expression in intestinal lineage suggests that the intestinal specification involving CdxA expression commences before the gut tube is formed. The expression of CdxA in epithelial-mesenchymal tissue recombinants suggests that mesenchymal influence regulating CdxA expression plays an important role in confirming the boundary between the stomach and intestine. Chronological change in the spatial distribution of CdxA transcripts and the results of tissue recombination experiments, together with precise fate maps of early endoderm and splanchnic mesoderm, lead to a model of mechanisms by which intestinal specification is brought about.
Prevotella ruminicola B(1)4 is a gram-negative, anaerobic gastrointestinal bacterium. A 2.4-kbp chromosomal fragment from P. ruminicola encoding an 87-kDa aryl-glucosidase (CdxA) with cellodextrinase activity was cloned into Escherichia coli DH5 alpha and sequenced. CdxA activity was found predominantly in the membrane fraction of both P. ruminicola and E. coli, but P. ruminicola localized the protein extracellularly while E. coli did not. The hydrolase had the highest activity on cellodextrins (3.43 to 4.13 mumol of glucose released min-1 mg of protein-1) and p-nitrophenyl-beta-D-glucoside (3.54 mumol min-1 mg of protein-1). Significant activity (70% of p-nitrophenyl-beta-D-glucoside activity) was also detected on arbutin and prunasin. Less activity was obtained with cellobiose, amygdalin, or gentiobiose. CdxA attacks cellodextrins from the nonreducing end, releasing glucose units, and appears to be an exo-1,4-beta-glucosidase (EC 3.2.1.74) which also is able to attack beta-1,6 linkages. Comparison of the deduced amino acid sequence with other glycosyl-hydrolases suggests that this enzyme belongs to family 3 (B. Henrissat, Biochem. J. 280:309-316, 1991). On the basis of this sequence alignment, the catalytic residues are believed to be Asp-275 and Glu-265. This is the first report of a cloned ruminal bacterial enzyme which can cleave cyanogenic plant compounds and which may therefore contribute to cyanide toxicity in ruminants.
CdxA is a homeobox gene of the caudal type that was previously shown to be expressed in the endoderm-derived gut epithelium during early embryogenesis. Expression of the CDXA protein was studied during intestine morphogenesis from stage 11 (13 somites) to adulthood in the chicken. The CDXA protein can be detected during all stages of gut closure, from stage 11 to 5 days of incubation, and is mainly localized to the intestinal portals, the region where the splanchnopleure is undergoing closure. In this region, which represents the transition between the open and closed gut, the CDXA protein is restricted to the endoderm-derived epithelium. At about day 5 of incubation, the process of formation of the previllous ridges begins, which marks the beginning of the morphogenesis of the villi. From this stage to day 11 expression of CDXA is localized to the epithelial lining of the intestine. In parallel, a gradual increase in CDXA protein expression begins in the mesenchyme that is close in proximity to the CDXA-positive endoderm. Maximal CDXA levels in the mesenchyme are observed at day 9 of incubation. During days 10 and 11 CDXA levels in the mesenchyme remain constant, and by day 12 CDXA becomes undetectable in these cells and the epithelium again becomes the main site of expression. From day 12 of incubation until adulthood the CDXA protein is present in the intestinal epithelium. Until day 18 of incubation expression can be detected along the whole length of the villus with a stronger signal at the tip. With hatching the distribution along the villi changes so that the main site of CDXA protein expression is at the base of the villi and in the crypts. The transient expression of CDXA in the mesenchyme between days 5 and 11 may be related to the interactions taking place between the mesenchyme and the epithelium that ultimately result in the axial specification of the alimentary canal and the differentiation of its various epithelia. The main CDXA spatial distribution during morphogenesis suggests a tight linkage to the formation and differentiation of the intestinal epithelium itself. CDXA appears to play a role in the morphogenetic events leading to closure of the alimentary canal. During previllous ridge formation the CDXA protein is transiently expressed in the mesenchymal cells thought to provide instructive interactions for the regionalization and differentiation of the gut epithelium.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
The DNA binding specificity of the chicken homeodomain protein CDXA was studied. Using a CDXA-glutathione-S-transferase fusion protein, DNA fragments containing the binding site for this protein were isolated. The sources of DNA were oligonucleotides with random sequence and chicken genomic DNA. The DNA fragments isolated were sequenced and tested in DNA binding assays. Sequencing revealed that most DNA fragments are AT rich which is a common feature of homeodomain binding sites. By electrophoretic mobility shift assays it was shown that the different target sequences isolated bind to the CDXA protein with different affinities. The specific sequences bound by the CDXA protein in the genomic fragments isolated, were determined by DNase I footprinting. From the footprinted sequences, the CDXA consensus binding site was determined. The CDXA protein binds the consensus sequence A, A/T, T, A/T, A, T, A/G. The CAUDAL binding site in the ftz promoter is also included in this consensus sequence. When tested, some of the genomic target sequences were capable of enhancing the transcriptional activity of reporter plasmids when introduced into CDXA expressing cells. This study determined the DNA sequence specificity of the CDXA protein and it also shows that this protein can further activate transcription in cells in culture.
The chicken homebox containing gene, CdxA (formerly CHox-cad), was previously shown to be expressed during gastrulation. Localization of CdxA transcripts by in situ hybridization to tissue sections revealed that, during gastrulation, expression of this gene exhibits a posterior localization along the primitive streak. The transcripts are localized to epiblast cells in the vicinity of the primitive streak, to cells of the primitive streak itself and in the definitive endoderm as it replaces the hypoblast. In order to study in greater detail the pattern of expression of the CdxA gene during gastrulation, we expressed the full-length CdxA protein as a fusion protein in E. coli and generated monoclonal antibodies against it. Chicken embryos at different stages of gastrulation were processed for whole-mount immunohistochemical localization of the protein using anti-CdxA antibodies. Once the pattern of expression in the whole embryo was determined, the same embryos were sectioned to determine the identity of the cells expressing the CdxA protein. Detailed analysis of the CdxA protein in embryos, from the onset of primitive streak formation to the beginning of the tail bud stage (stages 2 to 10), has shown different patterns of expression during primitive streak elongation and regression. The CdxA protein is initially detected at the posterior marginal zone and the expression moves rostrally into the primitive streak during mid-streak stages. As the primitive streak elongates, the CdxA stripe of expression moves anteriorly. By definitive streak stages, the CdxA stripe of expression delineates a position along the anterior-posterior axis in the primitive streak. CdxA, like its Drosophila homologue cad, is expressed during gastrulation in a stripe localized to the posterior region of the embryo. These observations suggest that CdxA as a homebox gene may be part of a regulatory network coupled to axial determination during gastrulation in the early chick embryo.
Acyl-CoA synthetases (ACSs) play an essential role in fatty acid metabolism. ACS3 is an arachidonate-preferring enzyme expressed in a wide range of human tissues including brain, heart, placenta, prostate, skeletal muscle, testis and thymus. As an initial step to understanding the transcriptional regulation of the human ACS3 gene, we analyzed the genomic organization and transcription units of the human ACS3 gene. Sequence analysis of genomic clones demonstrates that the human ACS3 gene spans at least 80.6 kb and contains 17 exons. The human ACS3 gene was mapped between the sequence-tagged site markers D2S360 and WI-21901. Sequence inspection of the 5'-flanking region revealed potential DNA elements including CCAAT, AP-1, Oct-1, GATAs, SRY, CdxA, Nkx-2.5, c-Myb, HSF2, NF-AT, AP-2, NF-Y, and p300. A minimal promoter region required for the expression of the human ACS3 gene in melanoma G361 cells was determined.
Pax4 encodes a paired-box transcription factor and is essential for the differentiation of islet cells since the Pax4 homozygous mutant mice lack mature beta and delta cells. However, little is known about the transcriptional regulation of the Pax4 gene. We isolated and sequenced a 2.4-kb mouse genomic DNA fragment containing the 5' flanking sequence of Pax4 and identified a previously unrecognized intron. Primer extension revealed that this TATA-less promoter had only one transcription start site. The promoter activity of this fragment with various deletion mutants when tested in beta and non-beta cell lines indicated the presence of a beta-cell specific enhancer in the region, -1858 to -1954 bp. DNase 1 footprinting and gel retardation assays indicated that nuclear proteins from betaHC3 cells interacted with two sequences which contained putative CdxA/Nkx.2 and GATA-1,-2 binding sites. Site-directed mutagenesis indicated that both of these regions were necessary for beta-cell specific enhancer activity.
The human cDNA for cartilage intermediate layer protein (CILP) codes for a larger precursor protein that consists of CILP and a homologue to porcine Nucleotide pyrophosphohydrolase (NTPPHase) [Lorenzo et al. 1998a. J. Biol. Chem. 273, 23469-23475]. The human gene has now been isolated and characterized. Southern blot analysis indicated a single copy of the CILP gene in the human genome. The gene spans approximately 15.3 kbp of genomic DNA, and is organized in nine exons. The 5' flanking region contains a putative promoter region with a TATA-like box localized from -29 to -23 bp upstream of the transcription start site. Analysis of the putative promoter region revealed potentially cis-regulatory eukaryotic elements such as GATA-1, MyoD, MZF1, and CdxA. The protein coding region begins in exon 2 with the putative signal peptide. CILP is encoded from exon 3 to exon 9. In addition, exon 9 also codes for the entire NTPPHase homologue and contains the 3' untranslated region of the gene. All the introns follow the 'gt-ag' rule, except the last intron, intron 8, that belongs to the minor class of pre-mRNA introns that contain 'at-ac' at their 5' and 3' ends, respectively. The CILP gene was mapped to human chromosome 15q22.
The mucosubstances in the epithelium lining the segment from gizzard to duodenum during development of the chick embryo was studied histochemically using monoclonal antibodies against gizzard mucus and lectins, with attention to the regional differentiation of the epithelium in this segment. The anterior limit of epithelial CdxA mRNA expression detected by in situ hybridisation, which served as the position of the gizzard-duodenal boundary, was clearly found from d 3. Granules positive for some antibodies or lectins were found in the region ranging from the posterior part of the gizzard to the duodenum at d 3, which was followed by an increase in the number of granules and a gradual enlargement of the granule-positive area to the anterior part of the gizzard over 4-6 d. From d 4, the epithelia of the gizzard body and of the pyloric or duodenal region came to be differently stained with some antibodies or lectins. From d 10, each region showed a specific pattern of staining. The epithelia of the gizzard body and pyloric region contained abundant mucus granules with a different staining pattern. In the duodenum the number of stained granules was low except in occasional goblet cells. Thus the epithelia of the gizzard body, pyloric region and duodenum may produce different mucosubstances and the regional differentiation in these epithelia may start at rather early stages soon after the formation of digestive tube.
In situ analysis of the chicken cSox2 gene, a member of the transcription factor family containing an Sry-like high-mobility group (HMG) box, demonstrated localized expression in the embryonic endoderm. Transcripts of cSox2 appeared before commencement of morphogenesis and cytodifferentiation in the rostral gut epithelium from the pharynx to the stomach. The caudal limit of cSox2 expression coincided with that of the region competent for proventricular differentiation and to the rostral limit of the domain of CdxA, a homologue of Drosophila caudal. During morphogenesis, the level of transcripts of cSox2 decreased in epithelia invaginating into surrounding mesenchyme to form glandular or tubular structures, such as the primordia of the thyroid and lung, glandular epithelium of the proventriculus, and secondary bronchus of the lung. Tissue recombination experiments demonstrated that cSox2 expression is regulated by the underlying mesenchyme as well as morphogenesis and cytodifferentiation. The results suggest that cSox2 plays pivotal roles in generating morphologically and physiologically distinct types of epithelial cells in the gut.
To examine whether PARK16, which was recently identified as a protective locus for Parkinson disease (PD) in Asian, white, and South American populations, is also associated with PD in the genetically homogeneous Ashkenazi Jewish population.
Case-control study.
A medical center affiliated with a university. Subjects  Five single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) located between RAB7L1 and SLC41A1 were analyzed in 720 patients with PD and 642 controls, all of Ashkenazi Jewish origin.
Haplotypes were defined and risk estimates were determined for each SNP and haplotype. Bioinformatic analysis defined the putative promoter region of RAB7L1 and the transcription factor binding sites that are potentially affected by 2 of the tested SNPs.
All tested SNPs were significantly associated with PD (odds ratios = 0.64-0.76; P = .0002-.014). Two of them, rs1572931 and rs823144, were localized to the putative promoter region of RAB7L1 and their sequence variations altered the predicted transcription factor binding sites of CdxA, p300, GATA-1, Sp1, and c-Ets-1. Only 0.4% of patients were homozygous for the protective rs1572931 genotype (T/T), compared with 3.0% among controls (P = 5 × 10(-5)). This SNP was included in a haplotype that reduced the risk for PD by 10- to 12-fold (P = .002-.01) in all patients with PD and in a subgroup of patients who do not carry the Ashkenazi founder mutations in the GBA or LRRK2 genes.
Our data demonstrate that specific SNP variations and haplotypes in the PARK16 locus are associated with reduced risk for PD in Ashkenazim. Although it is possible that alterations in the putative promoter of RAB7L1 are associated with this effect, the role of other genes in this locus cannot be ruled out.
Cyclin-dependent kinase 6 (CDK6) is a key element of D-type cyclin holoenzymes. It is involved in the regulation of the G1-phase of the cell cycle and is considered to be an important candidate gene for selection of body measurement traits through marker-assisted selection. We cloned the promoter sequence of this gene in bovines and found it to share high similarity with that of the human CDK6 promoter. A 2271-bp sequence upstream of the start codon in the bovine CDK6 5'-flanking sequence is rich in GC; it lacks consensus TATA or CAAT box, but it contains several MZF1 binding sites. Other potential cis-regulatory elements were found in the 5'-flanking region, including CdxA, SRY, p300, GATA-1, and deltaE. Allele frequencies were also analyzed in various cattle breeds (Qinchuan, Qinchuan improvement steers, Nanyang, Jiaxian red, Xia'nan, Luxi, Simmental and Luxi crossbred steers, and Xuelong) and association with a selected single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) was calculated. The T-1075C SNP in the promoter was found to be significantly associated with body length and heart girth. This SNP marker was found to be significantly associated with body length and the heart girth in 737 individuals. We conclude that this SNP of the CDK6 gene has potential as a genetic marker for important body traits in bovine reproduction and breeding.
Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) is the standard method to assess bone mineral density (BMD). The International Society for Clinical Densitometry recommends the measurement of BMD at lumbar spine, total hip and femoral neck, but in certain circumstances the 33% radius may be the recommended area to measure BMD. The aim of this study has been to analyze whether 33% radius should be considered the recommended area to assess BMD in prostate cancer patients.
This is a retrospective study where BMD was assessed by DXA at 33% radius, lumbar spine, total hip, and femoral neck (cDXA) in 141 prostate cancer patients. Twenty-eight patients were hormone naïve while 113 were subjected to androgen suppression (AS) during the mean period of 29 months. Osteoporosis was diagnosed when T-score was lower than -2.5 and osteopenia when it ranged between -1 and -2.5.
The osteoporosis rate was 29.8% at 33% radius, 23.4% at femoral neck, 19.9% at lumbar spine, and 12.8% at total hip. The overall osteoporosis rate at cDXA was 29.1%. Osteoporosis was detected in 52.2% at 33% radius and 36.2% at cDXA. Normal BMD was found in 17.7% at 33% radius and 34.8% at cDXA. The 33% radius was the only site where a significant increase in the osteoporosis rate was detected in patients subjected to AS compared to those hormone naïve (33 and 13.8%).
The 33% radius seems more sensible than the central skeleton areas to detect bone mass loss in patients with prostate cancer.
Alkaline phosphatases are ubiquitous enzymes involved in many important biological processes. Mammalian tissue-nonspecific alkaline phosphatase has long been thought to feature in embryonic development and bone formation. In this study, an alkaline phosphatase (ALP) gene from Paralichthys olivaceus was identified by rapid amplification of cDNA ends and genome-walking PCR. The ALP gene extends 10,141 bp and contains 11 exons and 10 introns. The open reading frame of the ALP transcript consists of 1,431 bp, which encodes 476 amino acids products named as POALP. An analysis of its secondary and tertiary structure revealed that the POALP was conserved in different species, but one disulfide linkage made it possible to adapt to low-temperature environment. The ALP activity was found to be first detectable in the embryo before hatching. The POALP was distributed ubiquitously in the body of P. olivaceus and was particularly high in the digestive tract. These findings suggest the potential role of POALP in nutrient absorption and transportation. During the pre-metamorphosis (F stage), ALP gene expression is 2.5-folds of that in the pro-metamorphosis (E stage); but in the post-metamorphosis (I stage), it was 1.8-folds of that of pro-metamorphosis. Exogenetic thyroxine (T4) and thiourea (TU) influenced the ALP gene expression significantly during the metamorphosis. Bioinformatics analysis showed that Japanese flounder ALP promoter region contained promoter sequence and putative recognition site for several transcriptional factors, including SREBP-1, SYR, and CdxA. In vitro promoter assays employing EGFP reporter system demonstrated that the promoter of ALP was active.
Prevotella bryantii B(1)4 is a member of the phylum Bacteroidetes and contributes to the degradation of hemicellulose in the rumen. The genome of P. bryantii harbors four genes predicted to encode glycoside hydrolase (GH) family 3 (GH3) enzymes. To evaluate whether these genes encode enzymes with redundant biological functions, each gene was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. Biochemical analysis of the recombinant proteins revealed that the enzymes exhibit different substrate specificities. One gene encoded a cellodextrinase (CdxA), and three genes encoded beta-xylosidase enzymes (Xyl3A, Xyl3B, and Xyl3C) with different specificities for either para-nitrophenyl (pNP)-linked substrates or substituted xylooligosaccharides. To identify the amino acid residues that contribute to catalysis and substrate specificity within this family of enzymes, the roles of conserved residues (R177, K214, H215, M251, and D286) in Xyl3B were probed by site-directed mutagenesis. Each mutation led to a severely decreased catalytic efficiency without a change in the overall structure of the mutant enzymes. Through amino acid sequence alignments, an amino acid residue (E115) that, when mutated to aspartic acid, resulted in a 14-fold decrease in the k(cat)/K(m) for pNP-beta-d-xylopyranoside (pNPX) with a concurrent 1.1-fold increase in the k(cat)/K(m) for pNP-beta-d-glucopyranoside (pNPG) was identified. Amino acid residue E115 may therefore contribute to the discrimination between beta-xylosides and beta-glucosides. Our results demonstrate that each of the four GH3 enzymes has evolved to perform a specific role in lignopolysaccharide hydrolysis and provide insight into the role of active-site residues in catalysis and substrate specificity for GH3 enzymes.
Interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF-3), an essential transcriptional regulator of the interferon genes, has been implicated in virus and double-stranded RNA mediated induction of IFN-α, IFN-β and RANTES, in virus-induced apoptosis and in tumor suppression. Promoter plays an important role in the regulation of gene expression, but the characterization of the human IRF-3 promoter has not been systematically analyzed in HEK 293 cells. To characterize the human IRF-3 promoter, we have isolated a genomic clone of the human IRF-3 gene promoter region containing 1,000 nucleotides of the 5'- flanking region. Transient transfection of 5'-deleted promoter-reporter constructs and luciferase assay illustrated the region -149/-93 relative to the transcription start site (TSS) is sufficient for full promoter activity. This region contains HSF, E2F, CdxA and c-Myb transcription factor binding sites. The E2F sites are highly conserved among IRF-3 promoter regions of mouse, rat and human. Therefore, it was suggested that this E2F site may be essential for basal promoter activity. Surprisingly, mutation of this E2F site increased the promoter activity by 2-fold. Furthermore, overexpression of E2F1 reduced the transcription activity by 80%. These results indicated that human IRF-3 gene core promoter was located within the region -149/-93 relative to the TSS. E2F1 transcription factor negatively regulates human IRF-3 gene promoter.
Endoderm organ primordia become specified between gastrulation and gut tube folding in Amniotes. Although the requirement for RA signaling for the development of a few individual endoderm organs has been established a systematic assessment of its activity along the entire antero-posterior axis has not been performed in this germ layer.
RA is synthesized from gastrulation to somitogenesis in the mesoderm that is close to the developing gut tube. In the branchial arch region specific levels of RA signaling control organ boundaries. The most anterior endoderm forming the thyroid gland is specified in the absence of RA signaling. Increasing RA in anterior branchial arches results in thyroid primordium repression and the induction of more posterior markers such as branchial arch Hox genes. Conversely reducing RA signaling shifts Hox genes posteriorly in endoderm. These results imply that RA acts as a caudalizing factor in a graded manner in pharyngeal endoderm. Posterior foregut and midgut organ primordia also require RA, but exposing endoderm to additional RA is not sufficient to expand these primordia anteriorly. We show that in chick, in contrast to non-Amniotes, RA signaling is not only necessary during gastrulation, but also throughout gut tube folding during somitogenesis. Our results show that the induction of CdxA, a midgut marker, and pancreas induction require direct RA signaling in endoderm. Moreover, communication between CdxA(+) cells is necessary to maintain CdxA expression, therefore synchronizing the cells of the midgut primordium. We further show that the RA pathway acts synergistically with FGF4 in endoderm patterning rather than mediating FGF4 activity.
Our work establishes that retinoic acid (RA) signaling coordinates the position of different endoderm organs along the antero-posterior axis in chick embryos and could serve as a basis for the differentiation of specific endodermal organs from ES cells.
Gene regulation during development is an important biological activity that leads to synthesis of biomolecules at specific locations and specific times. The single tropomyosin gene of Caenorhabditis elegans, tmy-1/lev-11, produces four isoforms of protein: two from the external promoter and two from the internal promoter. We investigated the internal promoter of tropomyosin to identify sequences that regulate expression of tmy-1 in the pharynx and intestine. By promoter deletion of tmy-1 reporters as well as by database analyses, a 100-bp fragment that contained binding sequences for a GATA factor, for a chicken CdxA homolog, and for a forkhead factor was identified. Both the forkhead and CdxA binding sequences contributed to pharyngeal and intestinal expression. In addition, the GATA site also influenced intestinal expression of tmy-1 reporter. We showed that ELT-2 and PHA-4 proteins interact directly with the GATA and forkhead binding sequences, respectively, in gel mobility shift assays. RNA interference knockdown of elt-2 diminished tmy-1::gfp expression in the intestine. In contrast to RNA interference knockdown of pha-4, expression of tmy-1::gfp in pha-4;smg-1 mutants was slightly weaker than that of the wild type. Ectopic expression of PHA-4 and ELT-2 by heat shock was sufficient to elicit widespread expression of tmy-1::lacZ reporter in embryos. We found no indication of a synergistic relation between ELT-2 and PHA-4. Based on our data, PHA-4 and CdxA function as general transcription factors for pharyngeal and intestinal regulation of tmy-1. We present models by which ELT-2, PHA-4, and CdxA orchestrate expression from the internal promoter of tmy-1.
Senescence marker protein-30 (SMP30), whose expression declines during aging in rat liver, has been proposed as an important aging marker. Besides apoptosis, SMP30 also protects cells against various other injuries by enhancement of membrane calcium-pump activity. The mechanism of this differential gene expression mechanism is not known. DNA-protein interactions, mutation analysis and luciferase reporter assay studies have been performed to elucidate the mechanism of transcriptional regulation of SMP30 gene.
We have characterized up to -2750 bp of the promoter by DNA-protein interactions studies. Twenty eight transcription factor binding sites have been identified by DNase I footprinting and electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA). Transient transfection of 5' and 3' -deleted promoter-reporter constructs and luciferase assay illustrated the region between -128/+157 bp is sufficient to drive promoter activity. We have mapped an essential regulatory region between -513 to -352 bp which causes a drastic decline of reporter activity. This region contains CdxA, GATA2 and SRY transcription factor binding sites. Individual mutation of these three sites showed increase in reporter activity. Mutation in SRY site (-403/-368) showed maximum increase in reporter activity among these three sites. Therefore, we suggest that SRY like protein may be acting as a strong repressor of SMP30 gene along with CdxA and GATA-2. We also report that mutation of both Sp1 (172/-148 bp) and a C/EBPbeta (-190/-177 bp) transcription binding site located adjacent to each other on SMP30 gene promoter, causes a significant enhancement in reporter activity than individual mutation, thus may be causing the repression of SMP30 promoter activity.
These studies provide novel insights into the mechanism that regulate SMP30 gene expression.
In the avian embryo, the endoderm, which forms a simple flat-sheet structure after gastrulation, is regionally specified in a gradual manner along the antero-posterior and dorso-ventral axes, and eventually differentiates into specific organs with defined morphologies and gene expression profiles. In our study, we carried out transplantation experiments using early chick embryos to elucidate the timing of fate establishment in the endoderm. We showed that at stage 5, posteriorly grafted presumptive foregut endoderm expressed CdxA, a posterior endoderm marker, but not cSox2, an anterior endoderm marker. Conversely, anteriorly grafted presumptive mid-hindgut endoderm expressed cSox2 but not CdxA. At stage 8, posteriorly grafted presumptive foregut endoderm also expressed CdxA and not cSox2, but anteriorly grafted presumptive mid-hindgut endoderm showed no changes in its posterior-specific gene expression pattern. At stage 10, both posteriorly grafted foregut endoderm and anteriorly grafted mid-hindgut endoderm maintain their original gene expression patterns. These results suggest that the regional specification of the endoderm occurs between stages 8 and 10 in the foregut, and between stages 5 and 8 in the mid-hindgut.
Transcriptional regulation of podocyte gene expression in primary glomerular disease is poorly understood. In this study, we demonstrate a prominent role of members of the ZHX (zinc fingers and homeoboxes) family of proteins in regulating podocyte gene expression during the development of nephrotic syndrome. While studying mechanisms of glomerular disease, rat ZHX3 was cloned from a down-regulated gene fragment; its cellular localization, DNA binding, and transcriptional repressor properties were characterized; and its ability to influence podocyte gene expression directly or via ZHX1 and ZHX2 was studied. In eukaryotic promoters, ZHX3 bound to the CdxA binding motif. ZHX proteins were mostly sequestered in the non-nuclear compartment in the normal in vivo podocyte by virtue of heterodimer formation, and loss of heterodimerization was associated with entry into the nucleus. In experimental minimal change disease, ZHX3 was transiently down-regulated prior to the onset of proteinuria, and recovery of expression was associated with migration of ZHX3 protein into the nucleus and the development of proteinuria. This expression pattern mirrored the increased nuclear ZHX3 expression noted in vivo in the podocytes in human minimal change disease biopsies. In vitro, migration of ZHX3 protein into the nucleus during recovery from transient ZHX3 knockdown reproduced the gene expression profile of in vivo minimal change disease. Severe sustained knockdown of ZHX3 caused down-regulation of genes involved in focal sclerosis, including WT1, mediated mostly by increased nuclear entry of ZHX2 and ZHX1. In summary, ZHX proteins are major transcriptional mediators of podocyte disease.
During mouse embryogenesis, CTGF/CCN2 is expressed in zones containing hypertrophic chondroctyes and calcifying cartilage such as long bones, ribs, vertebral column, and phalanges. But in fish, its expression is yet unclear. Development of the vertebrae is morphologically similar among vertebrates, indicating that the underlying mechanism regulating the process is highly conserved during evolution. Analysis of 3.2kb of the CTGF/CCN2 proximal promoter sequence revealed a consensus TATAA box, putative AP1, Brn-2, CdxA, C/EBP alpha, C/EBP beta, C-Ets-, delta E, HFH-2, and HSF2 binding sites. Transient expression experiments with a 5'-deletion revealed at least 4 regulatory regions in the zebrafish CTGF/CCN2 gene, 2 with a stimulatory effect on transcription and 2 with an apparent inhibitory effect after IGF-I treatment in the ZFL cell line. To study the promoter-specific expression, we constructed a series of CTGF/CCN2 (3.0-, 2.5-, 2.0-, 1.5-, 1.0-, and 0.4-kb) promoter-driven green fluorescent protein (GFP) fragments encoding the GFP cDNA transgene which was microinjected into zebrafish embryos. Morphological studies of transgenic zebrafish indicated that the CTGF/CCN2 promoter-driven GFP transcripts appeared in the notochord. Targeted knockdown of the CTGF/CCN2 gene by two antisense morpholino oligonucleotides resulted in disruptions to notochord development. From a comparative point of view, this study of the CTGF/CCN2 gene in zebrafish may correlate well with those previously published on the mouse. These molecular results suggest that CTGF/CCN2 plays an important role in notochord development and is required for general embryonic development.
Claudin-6 (CLDN6) is an integral component of the tight junction proteins in polarized epithelial and endothelial cells and plays a crucial role in maintaining cell integrity. Deregulation of CLDN6 expression and distribution in tumor tissues have been widely documented and correlated with cancer progression and metastasis. However, a complete mechanistic understanding of CLDN6 regulation and function remains to be studied. Herein, we show new potential properties of CLDN6 regulation and functions from bioinformatics analysis. Using numerous algorithms to characterize the CLDN6 gene promoter elements and the CLDN6 protein structure, physio-chemical and localization properties, and its evolutionary relationships. CLDN6 is regulated by a diverse set of transcription factors (SP1, SPR, AML-1a, CdxA, CRE-BP and CREB) and associated with the levels of methylation of CpG islands in promoters. The structural properties of CLDN6 indicate that it promotes cancer cell behavior via the ASK1-p38/JNK MAPK secretory signaling pathway. In conclusion, this information from bioinformatics analysis will help future attempts to better understand CLDN6 regulation and functions.
Phenoloxidases (POs) play key roles in various physiological functions in insects, e.g., cuticular sclerotization, wound healing, egg tanning, cuticle formation and melanotic encapsulaction of pathogens. Previously, we identified five POs, designated As-pro-PO I-V, from the mosquito Armigeres subalbatus and demonstrated that the functions of As-pro-PO I, II and III, were associated with filarial parasite melanization, blood feeding and cuticle formation, respectively. In the present study, we delineate the dual functions of As-pro-PO V. We found that the level of As-pro-PO V mRNA in mosquitoes was significantly increased after microfilaria challenge or blood feeding, and decreased to normal level after oviposition. Knockdown of As-pro-PO V by dsRNA resulted in significant decreases in the degree of microfilaria melanization, egg chronic melanization rates and egg hatching rates in Ar. subalbatus. Further transfection and electrophoretic mobility-shift assays verified the As-pro-PO V gene might regulated by both AP-1, a putative immune-related regulatory element and CdxA, a developmental regulatory element. The binding of AP-1 and CdxA motif with mosquito nuclear extracts was significantly enhanced after microfilaria challenge and blood-feeding in Ar. subalbatus, respectively. These results indicate that As-pro-PO V is a critical enzyme that is required for both an effective melanization immune response and egg chorion melanization in this mosquito. 
Our recent genome-wide association study (GWAS) had discovered a new locus at 8p23 (rs2738048) associated with IgA nephropathy (IgAN) in Chinese Han patients, implicating the DEFA gene family within this locus as susceptibility genes. However, it is still unknown whether there are additional variations within these genes associated with the disease susceptibility. The aim of this study is to investigate the polymorphisms of DEFA genes in the susceptibility to IgAN and explore possible disease mechanisms. Sixteen tag single-nucleotide polymorphisms (tag SNPs) were selected for association study in 1,000 IgAN cases and 1,000 controls by using Sequenom MassArray system or TaqMan SNP genotyping assays. We found seven SNPs within DEFA genes that were significantly associated with IgAN, including rs2738048 discovered in our previous GWAS (p = 0.0007, OR = 0.77) and additional 6 SNPs (rs2615787, p = 0.0001, OR = 0.74; rs2738081, p = 0.0003, OR = 0.72; rs2738058, p = 0.0001, OR = 0.73; rs4288398, p = 0.0008, OR = 0.78; rs6984215, p = 0.002, OR = 0.63; rs12716641, p = 0.00002, OR = 0.71). Electrophoretic mobility shift assays and luciferase assays demonstrated that fragments containing rs2738048, rs2738081 and rs6984215 were transcription factor binding sites for CTF, SP1 and CdxA, respectively, and the allele status of rs2738048 and rs6984215 could significantly change the luciferase activity. These results suggest that polymorphisms within DEFA genes are involved in gene transcriptional regulation, and this may have some effect in mediating susceptibility to IgAN in southern Chinese. 
This study examined the associations between vitamin D status, bone mineral content (BMC), areal bone mineral density (aBMD), and markers of calcium homeostasis in preschool-aged children. Children (n=488; age range: 1.8-6.0 y) were randomly recruited from Montreal. The distal forearm was scanned using a peripheral dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry scanner (Lunar PIXI; GE Healthcare, Fairfield, CT). A subset (n=81) had clinical dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (cDXA) scans (Hologic 4500A Discovery Series) of lumbar spine (LS) 1-4, whole body, and ultradistal forearm. All were assessed for plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] and parathyroid hormone concentrations (Liaison; Diasorin), ionized calcium (ABL80 FLEX; Radiometer Medical A/S), and dietary vitamin D and calcium intakes by survey. Age (p&lt;0.001) and weight-for-age Z-score (p&lt;0.001) were positively associated with BMC and aBMD in all regression models, whereas male sex contributed positively to forearm BMC and aBMD. Having a 25(OH)D concentration of &gt;75 nmol/L positively associated with forearm and whole body BMC and aBMD (p&lt;0.036). Sun index related to (p&lt;0.029) cDXA forearm and LS 1-4 BMC and whole-body aBMD. Nutrient intakes did not relate to BMC or aBMD. In conclusion, higher vitamin D status is linked to higher BMC and aBMD of forearm and whole body in preschool-aged children.
There are few large-scale studies on the utility of peripheral dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (pDXA) in children. As central dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (cDXA) equipment is not commonly available in the developing world, we assessed the correlation of bone mineral density (BMD) with cDXA and pDXA in children to determine the optimal Z-score thresholds of pDXA for predicting two predefined Z-score cutoffs (≤-1, ≤-2) of cDXA in 844 subjects (441 boys, 403 girls) aged 10-18 years. The BMD of antero-posterior lumbar spine (L1-L4), proximal femur and forearm was measured by cDXA, while the peripheral BMD of forearm and calcaneus was estimated using pDXA. The correlation was statistically significant at all sites (p&lt;0.01). The coefficients ranged from 0.56 to 0.79 in boys and 0.17 to 0.32 in girls. A significant positive correlation was observed between BMD by pDXA and cDXA in Indian children, with a strong gender difference in both the extent of correlation and the ability of peripheral BMD to predict central BMD.
The high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) protein is a multifunctional cytokine-like molecule that plays an important role in the pathogenesis of tumors. In this study, real-time polymerase chain reactions and Western blot assays indicated that HMGB1 transcriptional activity and protein level are increased in Tax+-T cells (TaxP). To clarify the mechanisms, a series of HMGB1 deletion reporter plasmids (pHLuc1 to pHLuc6) were transfected into Tax--T cells (TaxN, Jurkat) and Tax+-T cells (TaxP). We found that promoter activity in Tax+-T cells to be higher than that in Tax--T cells, indicating a significant increase in pHLuc6. Bay11-7082 (NF-κB inhibitor) treatment did not block the enhancing effect. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays revealed that Tax was retained on a HMGB1 promoter fragment encompassing -1163 to -975. Bioinformatics analysis showed six characteristic cis-elements for CdxA, AP-1, AML-1a, USF, v-Myb, and C/EBP in the fragment in question. Mutation of cis- elements for C/EBP reduced significant HMGB1 promoter activity induced by Tax. These findings indicate that Tax enhances the expression of HMGB1 gene at the transcriptional level, possibly by interacting with C/EBP.
Interferon regulatory factor 2 (IRF-2) is a multi-functional transcription factor in the IRF family exhibiting both transcriptional activating and repressing activities. In this study, an IRF-2 gene (HcIRF-2) from Hyriopsis cumingii was identified and characterized. The cDNA sequence consisted of 2688 bp, encoding a 329 amino acid-protein. The amino acid sequence had a highly conserved N-terminal DBD structure, containing characteristic repeats of six tryptophan residues. The 5'-flanking region contained several transcription regulation elements such as AP1, CdxA, HSF, NIT2 and HNF-3b. Nine SNPs were obtained through direct sequencing of HcIRF-2 from resistant and susceptible stock. Only +2365T/C SNP was significantly associated with resistance/susceptibility of H. cumingii to Aeromonas hydrophila both in genotype (P = 0.021) and allele (P = 0.006) analysis. The SNPs +2248T/C and +2365T/C were in high linkage disequilibrium, and haplotype analysis revealed that haplotype TT frequency in the resistant group was significantly higher than in the susceptible group. The mortality in +2248CC genotype individuals was significantly higher than in CT and TT genotype individuals. These results indicated that haplotype TT and genotype +2248CT and +2248GT individuals were resistant to A. hydrophila, which could make them potential markers in selective breeding of H. cumingii.
Based on the cDNA sequence of GPX in Hyriopsis cumingii, the complete genomic DNA of GPX gene and it's 5'-flanking region were identified from H. cumingii using PCR and genome walking technique. The length of the complete genomic sequence was 6 708 bp including the 5'-flanking region, two exons, and one intron. Sequence analysis of the 992 bp 5'-flanking region revealed that it contained a core promoter element (TATA-box) and other transcription regulation elements such as AP1, C/EBP, and CdxA. The sequence lengths of the two exons were 273 bp and 991 bp, respectively, and the intron was 4 491 bp in length. Sixteen single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were detected in the GPX gene from resistant stock (RS) and susceptible stock (SS) of H. cumingii. These polymorphisms were analyzed with regard to resistance to Aeromonas hydrophila. Among them, three SNPs including A-99G, A-86C, and A-49C in GPX promoter and five SNPs including A2841T, C2847T, G3146C, A3150G, and G4645T in GPX introns were associated with resistance/susceptibility of H. cumingii to A. hydrophila, both in genotype and allele frequency. Linkage disequilibrium analysis revealed that A-86C, A-49C, C2847T, A3150G, G4645T, A2841T, and G3146C were in high linkage disequilibrium, and haplotype analysis revealed that the frequency of two major predominant haplotypes (ACTGT and TG) in the resistant group was significantly higher than that in the susceptible group. The results suggest that the polymorphic loci in the GPX gene could be potential genetic markers for future molecular selection of strains resistant to diseases.
Investigating intestinal physiology in vitro remains challenging due to the lack of an effective primary enterocyte culture system. Recently developed protocols for growing organoids containing crypts and villus from adult mouse intestinal epithelium in Matrigel present an attractive alternative to the classical techniques. However, these approaches require the use of sophisticated and expensive serum-free medium supplemented with epithelial growth factor (EGF), Wnt agonist (R-spondin 1), and bone morphogenetic protein inhibitor (Noggin) in high concentrations. Here we demonstrate that is possible to use an isolated chicken embryonic intestinal epithelium to create such an organoid culture. Structures formed in Matrigel matrix in the first two days following isolation survive and enlarge during ensuing weeks. They have the appearance of empty spheres and comprise cells expressing cytokeratin (an epithelial cell marker), villin (a marker of enterocytes), and Sox-9 (a transcription factor characteristic of progenitors and stem cells of intestinal crypts). With chicken embryonic tissue as a source of organoids, prostaglandin E2 is as effective as R-spondin 1 and Noggin in promoting sustained growth and survival of epithelial spheroids.
The production of therapeutic proteins from transgenic animals is one of the most important successes of animal biotechnology. Milk is presently the most mature system for production of therapeutic proteins from a transgenic animal. Specifically, β-casein is a major component of cow, goat and sheep milk, and its promoter has been used to regulate the expression of transgenic genes in the mammary gland of transgenic animals. Here, we cloned the porcine β-casein gene and analyzed the transcriptional activity of the promoter and intron 1 region of the porcine β-casein gene. Sequence inspection of the 5'-flanking region revealed potential DNA elements including SRY, CdxA, AML-a, GATA-3, GATA-1 and C/EBP β. In addition, the first intron of the porcine β-casein gene contained the transcriptional enhancers Oct-1, SRY, YY1, C/EBP β, and AP-1, as well as the retroviral TATA box. We estimated the transcriptional activity for the 5'-proximal region with or without intron 1 of the porcine β-casein gene in HC11 cells stimulated with lactogenic hormones. High transcriptional activity was obtained for the 5'-proximal region with intron 1 of the porcine β-casein gene. The β-casein gene containing the mutant TATA box (CATAAAA) was also cloned from another individual pig. Promoter activity of the luciferase vector containing the mutant TATA box was weaker than the same vector containing the normal TATA box. Taken together, these findings suggest that the transcription of porcine β-casein gene is regulated by lactogenic hormone via intron 1 and promoter containing a mutant TATA box (CATAAAA) has poor porcine β-casein gene activity. 
Fascin, an actin-bundling protein forming actin bundles including filopodia and stress fibers, is overexpressed in multiple human epithelial cancers including esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). Previously we conducted a microarray experiment to analyze fascin knockdown by RNAi in ESCC.
In this study, the differentially expressed genes from mRNA expression profilomg of fascin knockdown were analyzed by multiple bioinformatics methods for a comprehensive understanding of the role of fascin.
Gene Ontology enrichment found terms associated with cytoskeleton organization, including cell adhesion, actin filament binding and actin cytoskeleton, which might be related to fascin function. Except GO categories, the differentially expressed genes were annotated by 45 functional categories from the Functional Annotation Chart of DAVID. Subpathway analysis showed thirty-nine pathways were disturbed by the differentially expressed genes, providing more detailed information than traditional pathway enrichment analysis. Two subpathways derivated from regulation of the actin cytoskeleton were shown. Promoter analysis results indicated distinguishing sequence patterns and transcription factors in response to the co-expression of downregulated or upregulated differentially expressed genes. MNB1A, c-ETS, GATA2 and Prrx2 potentially regulate the transcription of the downregulated gene set, while Arnt-Ahr, ZNF42, Ubx and TCF11-MafG might co-regulate the upregulated genes.
This multiple bioinformatic analysis helps provide a comprehensive understanding of the roles of fascin after its knockdown in ESCC.
Murine embryonic stem (ES) cells constitute a versatile biological system that has facilitated major advances in the fields of cell and developmental biology. Although melatonin has a wide variety of biological functions, its effect on ES cells is still unknown. In this study, we examined the effects of melatonin on transcription factors of ES cells (ES-E14TG2a cells) using an in vitro culture system. We found that melatonin affected cellular proliferation and Akt phosphorylation. Melatonin treatment also increased Bcl-2 expression and suppressed Bax expression and decreased phosphorylation of GSK α/β. The transcription factor Oct4, which contains the POU (N-terminal to homeobox) domain, and the transcription factor Sox2, the zinc finger transcription factor Zfp206, and the zinc finger gene REX-1 (Znf42), which contain the high mobility group (HMG) domain, are all important for cellular pluripotency and pre-implantation development. In this study, melatonin treatment influenced Oct4 and REX-1 expression at day 1 but not significantly at days 2 and 3. In addition, Sox2 and Zfp206 expressions did not change over the course of melatonin treatment. Taken together, melatonin may affect Akt activation but does not influence the mRNA expressions of Oct4, REX-1, Sox2, or Zfp206, suggesting that melatonin may stimulate proliferation of ES-E14TG2a cells via Akt phosphorylation.
Neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) is a member of the lipocalin superfamily; dysregulated expression of NGAL has been observed in several benign and malignant diseases. In the present study, differentially expressed genes, in comparison with those of control cells, in the mRNA expression profile of EC109 esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) cells following NGAL overexpression were analyzed by multiple bioinformatic tools for a comprehensive understanding. A total of 29 gene ontology (GO) terms associated with immune function, chromatin structure and gene transcription were identified among the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in NGAL overexpressing cells. In addition to the detected GO categories, the results from the functional annotation chart revealed that the differentially expressed genes were also associated with 101 functional annotation category terms. A total of 59 subpathways associated locally with the differentially expressed genes were identified by subpathway analysis, a markedly greater total that detected by traditional pathway enrichment analysis only. Promoter analysis indicated that the potential transcription factors Snail, deltaEF1, Mycn, Arnt, MNB1A, PBF, E74A, Ubx, SPI1 and GATA2 were unique to the downregulated DEG promoters, while bZIP910, ZNF42 and SOX9 were unique for the upregulated DEG promoters. In conclusion, the understanding of the role of NGAL overexpression in ESCC has been improved through the present bioinformatic analysis.
Drug-induced liver injury is an important reason for drug candidate failure. Alterations in the hepatobiliary disposition of bile acids are a proposed mechanism of cholestatic hepatotoxicity. Bile acids are synthesized in the hepatocyte, and excreted into the bile primarily by the bile salt export pump. Therefore, inhibition of the bile salt export pump by drugs has been postulated as a risk factor in the development of cholestatic hepatotoxicity. However, recent publications have shown a lack of correlation between bile salt export pump inhibition potency and drug-induced liver injury incidence. Following inhibition of the bile salt export pump mediated efflux of bile acids, the liver compensates through various mechanisms (adaptive response) including upregulation of basolateral bile acid efflux mediated by the farnesoid X receptor, the master regulator of bile acid homeostasis. The C-DILI™ assay integrates the effects of bile salt export pump inhibition, farnesoid X receptor antagonism, and basolateral efflux inhibition of bile acids to more accurately predict a drug's potential to cause cholestatic hepatotoxicity and drug-induced liver injury.
Twenty-epi analogs of 1alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25D3) are 100-1000 times more potent transcriptionally than the natural hormone. To determine whether this enhanced activity is mediated through modulation of the dimerization process or through interaction with coactivators, we performed quantitative protein-protein interaction assays with in vitro translated vitamin D receptor (ivtVDR) and fusion proteins containing glutathione-S-transferase (GST) and either the ligand-binding domain of retinoid X receptor (RXRalpha), or the nuclear receptor-interacting domain of the steroid receptor coactivator 1 (SRC-1), or the glucocorticoid receptor-interacting protein 1 (GRIP-1). We found that heterodimerization of the ligand-binding domains of RXRalpha and VDR was primarily deltanoid dependent as was the interaction of VDR with the SRC-1 or with GRIP-1. The ED50 for induction of heterodimerization was 2 nM for 1,25D3 and 0.05 nM for 20-epi-1,25D3. However, the ED50 for induction of VDR interaction with SRC-1 was similar for both 1,25D3 and the 20-epi analog (ED50 = 0.7-1.0 nM) as was the ED50 for ligand-mediated interaction of VDR with GRIP-1 (ED50 = 0.1-0.3 nM). Mutations in heptad 9 diminished both 1,25D3 and the 20-epi analog-mediated dimerization, without changing binding of these ligands to VDR. Mutations in VDR's activation function 2 (AF-2) domain/helix 12 residues diminished the ability of 1,25D3 to induce heterodimerization and interaction with SRC-1. These mutations did not change the ability of 20-epi-1,25D3 to induce dimerization but did diminish its ability to induce interaction with SRC-1. We hypothesize that both the hormone and the analog stabilize receptor conformations that expose VDR's functional interfaces. The mechanisms by which the two ligands expose these functional interfaces differ with respect to participation of the AF-2 domain.
Cognate cDNAs are described for 2 of the 10 thyroid hormone receptor-associated proteins (TRAPs) that are immunopurified with thyroid hormone receptor alpha (TRalpha) from ligand-treated HeLa (alpha-2) cells. Both TRAP220 and TRAP100 contain LXXLL domains found in other nuclear receptor-interacting proteins and both appear to reside in a single complex with other TRAPs (in the absence of TR). However, only TRAP220 shows a direct ligand-dependent interaction with TRalpha, and these interactions are mediated through the C terminus of TRalpha and (at least in part) the LXXLL domains of TRAP220. TRAP220 also interacts with other nuclear receptors [vitamin D receptor, retinoic acid receptor alpha, retinoid X receptor alpha, peroxisome proliferation-activated receptor (PPAR) alpha, PPARgamma and, to a lesser extent, estrogen receptor] in a ligand-dependent manner, whereas TRAP100 shows only marginal interactions with estrogen receptor, retinoid X receptor alpha, PPARalpha, and PPARgamma. Consistent with these results, TRAP220 moderately stimulates human TRalpha-mediated transcription in transfected cells, whereas a fragment containing the LXXLL motifs acts as a dominant negative inhibitor of nuclear receptor-mediated transcription both in transfected cells (TRalpha) and in cell free transcription systems (TRalpha and vitamin D receptor). These studies indicate that TRAP220 plays a major role in anchoring other TRAPs to TRalpha during the function of the TRalpha-TRAP complex and, further, that TRAP220 (possibly along with other TRAPs) may be a global coactivator for the nuclear receptor superfamily.
The thyroid hormone receptor (TR) and retinoic acid receptor (RAR) isoforms have the capacity to silence gene expression in the absence of their ligands on target response elements. This active repression is mediated by the ability of the corepressors, nuclear receptor corepressor (NCoR) and silencing mediator of retinoid and thyroid hormone receptors (SMRT), to recruit a complex containing histone deacetylase activity. Interestingly, NCoR and SMRT share significant differences in the their two nuclear receptor-interacting domains (IDs), suggesting that they may recruit receptors with different affinities. In addition, the role of the receptor complex bound to a response element has not been fully evaluated in its ability to recruit separate corepressors. We demonstrate in this report that the proximal ID in NCoR and SMRT, which share only 23% homology, allows preferential recognition of nuclear receptors, such that TR prefers to recruit NCoR, and RAR prefers to recruit SMRT, to DNA response elements. However, mutations in the TR found in the syndromes of resistance to thyroid hormone can change the corepressor recruited by changing the complex (homodimer or heterodimer) formed on the TRE. These results demonstrate that the corepressor complex recruited can be both nuclear receptor- and receptor complex-specific.
Proteins belonging to the 14--3-3 family interact with various regulatory proteins involved in cellular signaling, cell cycle regulation, or apoptosis. 14--3-3 proteins have been suggested to act by regulating the cytoplasmic/nuclear localization of their target proteins or by acting as molecular scaffolds or chaperones. We have previously shown that overexpression of 14--3-3 enhances the transcriptional activity of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), which is a member of the nuclear receptor family. In this study, we show that 14--3-3 interacts with the nuclear receptor corepressor RIP140. In transfection assays, RIP140 antagonizes 14--3-3- enhanced GR transactivation. Using colocalization studies we demonstrate that 14--3-3 can export RIP140 out of the nucleus and, interestingly, can also change its intranuclear localization. Moreover, we also observed that 14--3-3 can bind various other nuclear receptors and cofactors. In summary, our findings suggest that 14--3-3-mediated intracellular relocalization of the GR corepressor RIP140 might be a novel mechanism to enhance glucocorticoid responsiveness of target genes. They furthermore indicate a more general role for 14--3-3 protein by influencing the nuclear availability of nuclear receptor-associated cofactors.
Fructose intake is being discussed as a key dietary factor in the development of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Bile acids have been shown to modulate energy metabolism. We tested the effects of bile acids on fructose-induced hepatic steatosis. In C57BL/6J mice treated with a combination of chenodeoxycholic acid and cholic acid (100 mg/kg body weight each) while drinking water or a 30% fructose solution for eight weeks and appropriate controls, markers of hepatic steatosis, portal endotoxin levels, and markers of hepatic lipogenesis were determined. In mice concomitantly treated with bile acids, the onset of fructose-induced hepatic steatosis was markedly attenuated compared to mice only fed fructose. The protective effects of the bile acid treatment were associated with a downregulation of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)α, sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP)1, FAS mRNA expression, and lipid peroxidation in the liver, whereas hepatic farnesoid X receptor (FXR) or short heterodimer partner (SHP) protein concentration did not differ between groups fed fructose. Rather, bile acid treatment normalized occludin protein concentration in the duodenum, portal endotoxin levels, and markers of Kupffer cell activation to the level of water controls. Taken together, these data suggest that bile acids prevent fructose-induced hepatic steatosis in mice through mechanisms involving protection against the fructose-induced translocation of intestinal bacterial endotoxin.
Mitochondria are involved in the toxicity of several compounds, retro-control of gene expression and apoptosis activation. The effect of mitochondrial genome (mtDNA) depletion on changes in ABC transporter protein expression in response to bile acids and paracetamol was investigated.
Hepa 1-6 mouse hepatoma cells with 70% decrease in 16S/18S rRNA ratio (Rho cells) were obtained by long-term treatment with ethidium bromide.
Spontaneous apoptosis and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation were decreased in Rho cells. Following glycochenodeoxycholic acid (GCDCA) or paracetamol, Rho cells generated less ROS and were more resistant to cell death. Apoptosis induced by GCDCA and Fas was also reduced. The basal expression of Mdr1 was significantly enhanced, but this was not further stimulated by GCDCA or paracetamol, as observed in wild-type (WT) cells. Basal expression of Mrp1 and Mrp4 was similar in WT and Rho cells, whereas they were up-regulated only in WT cells after GCDCA or paracetamol, along with the transcription factors Shp and Nrf2, but not Fxr or Pxr. Increased expression of Nrf2 was accompanied by its enhanced nuclear translocation. Glycoursodeoxycholic acid failed to cause any of the effects observed for GCDCA or paracetamol.
The Nrf2-mediated pathway is partly independent of ROS production. Nuclear translocation of Nrf2 is insufficient to up-regulate Mdr1, Mrp1 and Mrp4, which requires the participation of other regulatory element(s) whose activation in response to GCDCA and paracetamol is impaired in Rho cells and hence probably sensitive to ROS.
There is increasing evidence that Nrf2 participates in hepatic fatty acid metabolism in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease; however, the mechanism remains unclear. We investigated the role of Nrf2 in hepatic fatty acid metabolism disorder induced by high-fat diet (HFD). Mice fed HFD developed hepatic steatosis and exhibited Nrf2 deficiency. Change of fatty acid composition mediated by Nrf2 deletion was observed predominantly in the liver and not the serum. HFD-induced variations in hepatic 18-carbon and 22-carbon fatty acids were enhanced by Nrf2 deficiency. In the HFD group, Nrf2 deficiency led to increases in the mRNA expression of PPARα, FXR, FAS, LXR and ACC-1, while levels of PGC-1α and Srebp-1c mRNA were decreased. Nrf2 mRNA expression was enhanced in the liver of HFD-induced wild type mice, whereas it was undetectable in Nrf2-null mice. These results suggest that Nrf2 deficiency induced by HFD promoted hepatic fatty acid metabolism disorder by altering 18-carbon and 22-carbon fatty acid composition. Changes in fatty acid content were also associated with alteration of the transcription of genes involved in hepatic fatty acid metabolism. 
Farnesoid X receptor (FXR) and related pathways are involved in the therapeutic effect of sleeve gastrectomy for overweight or obese patients with diabetes mellitus. This study aimed to investigate the mechanism of FXR expression regulation during the surgical treatment of obese diabetes mellitus by sleeve gastrectomy. Diabetic rats were established by combined streptozotocin and high-fat diet induction. Data collection included body weight, chemical indexes of glucose and lipid metabolism, liver function, and the expression levels of musculoaponeurotic fibrosarcoma oncogene family B (MAFB), FXR, and related genes induced by sleeve gastrectomy. Chang liver cells overexpressing MAFB gene were established to confirm the expression of related genes. The binding and activation of FXR gene by MAFB were tested by Chip and luciferase reporter gene assays. Vertical sleeve gastrectomy induced significant weight loss and decreased blood glucose and lipids in diabetic rat livers, as well as decreased lipid deposition and recovered lipid function. The expression of MAFB, FXR, and FXR-regulated genes in diabetic rat livers were also restored by sleeve gastrectomy. Overexpression of MAFB in Chang liver cells led to FXR gene expression activation and the alteration of multiple FXR-regulated genes. Chip assay showed that MAFB could directly bind with FXR promoter, and the activation of FXR expression was confirmed by luciferase reporter gene analysis. The therapeutic effect of sleeve gastrectomy for overweight or obese patients with diabetes mellitus was mediated by activation of FXR expression through the binding of MAFB transcription factor.
Atherosclerosis, the leading cause of cardiovascular diseases in the world, is a chronic inflammatory disorder characterized by the dysfunction of arteries. Oleanolic acid (OA) is a bioactive nature product which exists in various plants and herbs. Previous studies have demonstrated that OA was involved in numerous of biological processes, including atherosclerosis. However, the exact mechanisms of the anti-atherosclerosis effects of OA remain unknown. Here, in our study, we analyzed the effects and possible underlying mechanisms of OA in atherosclerosis depending a cell model and an animal model of atherosclerosis. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were treated with oxidized low-density lipoprotein (ox-LDL, 100 μg/mL) for 24 h to establish an atherosclerotic cell model. New Zealand white (NZW) rabbits were fed with high-fat (HF) diets for three months to establish an atherosclerotic animal model. Then, cell viability and expression of cytokines (ANG, NO, eNOS, IL-1β, TNF-α, and IL-6) were measured with CCK-8 assay and ELISA kits, cell apoptosis and cell cycle distribution were analyzed by flow cytometry in the atherosclerotic cell model. Results showed that ox-LDL induced effects of anti-proliferation, cytokines alterations, and cell apoptosis were abolished by the application of OA or Ang (1-7). Further study indicated that OA increased the expression of ANG by upregulating the FXR expression in the ox-LDL induced HUVECs arthrosclerosis model. And the in vivo experiment in the HF diet induced animal model suggested that OA may inhibit the development of atherosclerosis. The atherosclerosis of aortas was assessed by Hematoxylin Eosin (HE), Oil Red O and Picrosirius Red staining; the expression levels of total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) were determined by the fully automatic biochemical analyzer, in the atherosclerotic animal model. All the results showed that OA treatment improved the cell viability in the cell model, inhibited the atherosclerosis development in the animal model. OA play as an anti-atherosclerosis agent in both the cell model and animal model by upregulating the production of Angiotensin (Ang)-(1-7) through FXR.
Inflammation has a recognized role in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) progression. In the present work, we studied the effect of high-fat diet (HFD) on arachidonic acid metabolism in the liver and investigated the role of the farnesoid X receptor (FXR, NR1H4) in eicosanoid biosynthetic pathways and nuclear factor κ light-chain enhancer of activated B cells (NF-kB) signaling, major modulators of the inflammatory cascade. Mice were fed an HFD to induce NAFLD and then treated with the FXR ligand obeticholic acid (OCA). Histology and gene expression analyses were performed on liver tissue. Eicosanoid levels were measured from serum and urine samples. The molecular mechanism underlying the effect of FXR activation on arachidonic acid metabolism and NF-kB signaling was studied in human liver Huh7 cells and primary cultured hepatocytes. NAFLD was characterized by higher (∼25%) proinflammatory [leukotrienes (LTB4)] and lower (∼3-fold) anti-inflammatory [epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs)] eicosanoid levels than in chow mice. OCA induced the expression of several hepatic cytochrome P450 (P450) epoxygenases, the enzymes responsible for EET synthesis, and mitigated HFD-induced hepatic injury. In vitro, induction of CYP450 epoxygenases was sufficient to inhibit NF-kB signaling and cell migration. The CYP450 epoxygenase pan-inhibitor gemfibrozil fully abolished the protective effect of OCA, indicating that OCA-mediated inhibition of NF-kB signaling was EET-dependent. In summary, NAFLD was characterized by an imbalance in arachidonate metabolism. FXR activation reprogramed arachidonate metabolism by inducing P450 epoxygenase expression and EET production. In vitro, FXR-mediated NF-kB inhibition required active P450 epoxygenases.
Hypertonicity in renal medulla is critical for the kidney to produce concentrated urine. Renal medullary cells have to survive high medullary osmolarity during antidiuresis. Previous study reported that farnesoid X receptor (FXR), a nuclear receptor transcription factor activated by endogenous bile acids, increases urine concentrating ability by up-regulating aquaporin 2 expression in medullary collecting duct cells (MCDs). However, whether FXR is also involved in the maintenance of cell survival of MCDs under dehydration condition and hypertonic stress remains largely unknown. In the present study, we demonstrate that 24-hours water restriction selectively up-regulated renal medullary expression of FXR with little MCD apoptosis in wild-type mice. In contrast, water deprivation caused a massive apoptosis of MCDs in both global FXR gene-deficient mice and collecting duct-specific FXR knockout mice. In vitro studies showed that hypertonicity significantly increased FXR and tonicity response enhancer binding protein (TonEBP) expression in mIMCD3 cell line and primary cultured MCDs. Activation and overexpression of FXR markedly increased cell viability and decreased cell apoptosis under hyperosmotic conditions. In addition, FXR can increase gene expression and nuclear translocation of TonEBP. We conclude that FXR protects MCDs from hypertonicity-induced cell injury very likely via increasing TonEBP expression and nuclear translocation. This study provides insights into the molecular mechanism by which FXR enhances urine concentration via maintaining cell viability of MCDs under hyperosmotic condition.
MAF bZIP transcription factor G (MAFG) is activated by the farnesoid X receptor to repress bile acid synthesis. However, expression of MAFG increases during cholestatic liver injury in mice and in cholangiocarcinomas. MAFG interacts directly with methionine adenosyltransferase α1 (MATα1) and other transcription factors at the E-box element to repress transcription. We studied mechanisms of MAFG up-regulation in cholestatic tissues and the pathways by which S-adenosylmethionine (SAMe) and ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) prevent the increase in MAFG expression. We also investigated whether obeticholic acid (OCA), an farnesoid X receptor agonist, affects MAFG expression and how it contributes to tumor growth in mice.
We obtained 7 human cholangiocarcinoma specimens and adjacent non-tumor tissues from patients that underwent surgical resection in California and 113 hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) specimens and adjacent non-tumor tissues from China, along with clinical data from patients. Tissues were analyzed by immunohistochemistry. MAT1A, MAT2A, c-MYC, and MAFG were overexpressed or knocked down with small interfering RNAs in MzChA-1, KMCH, Hep3B, and HepG2 cells; some cells were incubated with lithocholic acid (LCA, which causes the same changes in gene expression observed during chronic cholestatic liver injury in mice), SAMe, UDCA (100 μM), or farnesoid X receptor agonists. MAFG expression and promoter activity were measured using real-time polymerase chain reaction, immunoblot, and transient transfection. We performed electrophoretic mobility shift, and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays to study proteins that occupy promoter regions. We studied mice with bile-duct ligation, orthotopic cholangiocarcinomas, cholestasis-induced cholangiocarcinoma, diethylnitrosamine-induced liver tumors, and xenograft tumors.
LCA activated expression of MAFG in HepG2 and MzChA-1 cells, which required the activator protein-1, nuclear factor-κB, and E-box sites in the MAFG promoter. LCA reduced expression of MAT1A but increased expression of MAT2A in cells. Overexpression of MAT2A increased activity of the MAFG promoter, whereas knockdown of MAT2A reduced it. MAT1A and MAT2A had opposite effects on the activator protein-1, nuclear factor-κB, and E-box-mediated promoter activity. Expression of MAFG and MAT2A increased, and expression of MAT1A decreased, in diethylnitrosamine-induced liver tumors in mice. SAMe and UDCA had shared and distinct mechanisms of preventing LCA-mediated increased expression of MAFG. OCA increased expression of MAFG, MAT2A, and c-MYC, but reduced expression of MAT1A. Incubation of human liver and biliary cancer cells lines with OCA promoted their proliferation; in nude mice given OCA, xenograft tumors were larger than in mice given vehicle. Levels of MAFG were increased in human HCC and cholangiocarcinoma tissues compared with non-tumor tissues. High levels of MAFG in HCC samples correlated with hepatitis B, vascular invasion, and shorter survival times of patients.
Expression of MAFG increases in cells and tissues with cholestasis, as well as in human cholangiocarcinoma and HCC specimens; high expression levels correlate with tumor progression and reduced survival time. SAMe and UDCA reduce expression of MAFG in response to cholestasis, by shared and distinct mechanisms. OCA induces MAFG expression, cancer cell proliferation, and growth of xenograft tumors in mice.
Hepatic fibrosis is a pathological process that eventually leads to the development of cirrhosis and liver cancer by various types of chronic liver disease. To date, there is no standard treatment for the progression of liver fibrosis. This study aims to investigate the hepatoprotection of auraptene (AUR), a simple coumarin contained in the peels of citrus fruits such as grapefruit, against thioacetamide (TAA)-induced hepatic fibrosis in mice. The involvement of farnesoid X receptor (FXR) in the anti-fibrotic effect of AUR was further elucidated using in vivo and in vitro experiments. AUR was found to remarkably protect against liver injury induced by TAA in mice and maintain the homeostasis of bile acids via the regulation of FXR-target genes including Bsep, Mrp2, Ntcp, Cyp7a1 and Cyp8b1. Masson and Sirius red staining indicated a reduction of the collagen content in the liver of AUR treated mice. Furthermore, AUR inhibited the activation of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) by down-regulating the expression of TGF-β1 and α-SMA and expressed anti-inflammatory effects by reducing the expression of NF-κB, TNF-α and IL-1β. However, the changes in these genes and protein as well as ameliorative liver histology induced by AUR were abrogated by FXR antagonist guggulsterone in vivo and FXR siRNA in vitro. Overall, AUR protects against TAA-induced hepatic fibrosis due to the reduction of toxic bile acids and inhibition of hepatic stellate cell (HSC) activation and inflammation, which were all in association with FXR activation. AUR might be efficacious for the prevention and treatment of hepatic fibrosis in mice.
The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of administering particulate matter (PM2.5) to the lungs on the sensitivity to myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury (MI/RI) and the role of farnesoid-X-receptor (FXR)-induced autophagy in this process.
Male Sprague Dawley (SD) rats were subjected to 45 min of ischemia, and the lungs were exposed to 2.0 mg of PM2.5 in 0.3 mL of normal saline 5 min before reperfusion. After 24 h of reperfusion, the blood and myocardium were collected, and the myocardial infarct sizes, activities of serum creatine kinase (CK) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and levels of serum high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), interleukin-4 (IL-4), interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), cardiac troponin T (cTnT), P-selectin and D-dimer were measured via biochemical analysis. Additionally, the myeloperoxidase (MDA) content and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity were measured in myocardial tissues via biochemical analysis, and the levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), autophagosomes, microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC-I and II), macrophage inflammatory protein-2 (MIP-2) and farnesoid-X-receptor (FXR) were determined in myocardial tissues via biochemical analysis, immunohistochemical and biochemical techniques and western blot. In addition, the myocardial infarct sizes, LC-I and II expressions were determined in myocardial tissues through FXR-/- and WT mice.
Levels of CK, LDH, hsCRP, IL-6, TNF-α, cTnT, P-selectin and D-dimer, MDA and infarct sizes were higher in I/R group than that in Sham group, and Levels of IL-4 and SOD were lower in I/R group than that in Sham group; ROS, autophagosomes, LC-3I, LC-3II, MIP-2 and FXR expressions were higher in I/R group than that in Sham group. Levels of CK, LDH, hsCRP, IL-6, TNF-α, cTnT, P-selectin and D-dimer, MDA and infarct sizes were higher in PM2.5 group than that in I/R group, and Levels of IL-4 and SOD were lower in PM2.5 group than that in I/R group; ROS, autophagosomes, LC-3I, LC-3II, MIP-2 and FXR expressions were higher in PM2.5 group than that in I/R group.
PM2.5 post-treatment exacerbated myocardial injury partly through upregulation of FXR to induce autophagy compared to MI/RI.
As a well-known bile acid receptor, the role of Farnesoid X receptor (FXR) in the digestive system and cardiovascular system has been widely explored. However, there are very few studies involving FXR in the central nervous system. In this study, we explored the role of FXR in the pathogenesis of depression, a serious and worldwide neuropsychiatric disease. It was found that chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) fully enhanced the protein and mRNA expressions of FXR in hippocampus, but not medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). Overexpression of hippocampal FXR induced notable depressive-like behaviors and decreased expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in naïve rats, while knockdown of hippocampal FXR fully prevented the effects of CUMS on rat behaviors and hippocampal BDNF expression. Taken together, our research extends the knowledge of FXR's role in the central nervous system, and may provide a potential and novel therapeutic target for treating depression.
Cholestasis is a clinical syndrome with systemic and intrahepatic accumulation of excessive toxic bile acids that ultimately cause hepatobiliary injury. Recently obeticholic acid (OCA) which is a farnesoid X receptor (FXR) agonist was approved by FDA to treat cholestatic liver diseases, which provided us a newly therapeutic strategy against cholestasis. The purpose of the current study is to screen novel FXR agonists and verify the anti-cholestasis effect of yangonin in vivo and in vitro. The computational strategy of two-dimensional virtual screening was used to search for new FXR agonists, and dual-luciferase reporter gene assay was used to further demonstrate FXR activation by yangonin. Then, the hepatoprotective effect of yangonin via FXR activation against cholestasis and hepatotoxity was evaluated in mice and was investigated using FXR silence in cells. Yangonin was found to activate FXR to exert hepatoprotective effect against cholestatic liver injury. Dynamic change analysis of bile acids and gene analysis revealed that yangonin promoted bile acid efflux into bile and reduced hepatic uptake via the regulation of FXR-target genes Bsep, Mrp2 and Ntcp expression. Furthermore, yangonin modulated enzymes involved in bile acid synthesis and metabolism including Cyp7a1 Cyp8b1 and Sult2a1. In addition, yangonin promoted liver repair and suppressed liver inflammation. However, the changes in these genes and protein, as well as ameliorative liver histology induced by yangonin were abrogated by FXR antagonist guggulsterone in vivo and FXR siRNA in vitro. Yangonin produces protective effect against cholestasis via FXR activation. Yangonin may be an effective approach for the prevention and treatment for cholestatic liver diseases.
Cholestasis is a clinical syndrome of liver damage that is caused by accumulation of bile acids in the liver and systemic circulation. Farnesoid X receptor (FXR) can regulate synthesis, metabolism, and excretion of bile acids. The rhizomes of Alisma orientale is a well-known traditional Chinese medicine to treat edema, obesity, gonorrhea, leukorrhea, diarrhea, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes in China.
We hypothesized Alisma orientale extract (AOE) to exert hepatoprotective effect against α-naphthylisothiocyanate (ANIT) induced cholestasis in rat. We aimed to investigate the mechanism of AOE.
Male Sprague Dawley rats with intrahepatic cholestasis induced by ANIT were treated with AOE (150, 300, or 600 mg/kg). Rats receiving vehicle (0.5% CMC-Na) served as control.
48 h after ANIT administration, rats were sacrificed. Blood was collected to obtain serum and livers were removed for histopathology and protein preparation. Biochemical indicators in serum were determined using commercial kits and triterpenoids were determined by liquid chromatography tandem Qtrap mass spectrometry. Proteomics was analyzed by liquid chromatography tandem ion-trap mass spectrometry. The differently expressed proteins were analyzed via the network database and verified by western blotting. The interaction between triterpenoids and FXR were evaluated by luciferase assay and molecular docking.
AOE treatment significantly decreased the serum AST, ALT, TBIL, and intrahepatic TBA and improved the liver pathologic change induced by ANIT. Proteomics analysis indicated that AOE regulated proteins related to bile acid homeostasis via activating farnesoid X receptor (FXR) signaling pathway. Luciferase assay and molecular docking results indicated that triterpenoids could activate FXR, which resulting in ameliorative accumulation of bile acids in the liver by increase of metabolism and transportation for bile acids, and decrease of synthesis for bile acids.
AOE protected against rat liver injury and cholestasis induced by ANIT by activation of farnesoid X receptor, suggesting that A. orientale could be regarded as a potential hepatoprotective drug.
The nuclear receptor FXR regulates the expression of genes involved in bile acids, glucose and lipid homeostasis. For its role as guardian of metabolism, FXR has been identified a promising pharmacological target in liver bile acid and lipid accumulation, such as cholestasis and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). The field of FXR research is extremely competitive with a large number of patents and articles published in the last decades identifying promising hit compounds.
The present review summarizes recent patent activity (2014-to date) filing for synthetic and natural FXR ligands, including bile acid derivatives and non-steroidal compounds, alongside their in vitro and in vivo efficacy as well as their therapeutic applications.
While the first FXR agonist, obeticholic acid, has gained approval, significant safety issues have been emerged. Today is unclear whether these safety issues are class related or restricted to the bile acid scaffold of this agent. Despite the significant number of patent applications claiming steroidal and non-steroidal FXR agonists, several questions on their therapeutic potential in cholestasis and NASH remain open leaving a space for the development of novel compounds.
In infants intolerant of enteral feeding because of intestinal disease, parenteral nutrition may be associated with cholestasis, which can progress to end-stage liver disease. Here we show the function of hepatic macrophages and phytosterols in parenteral nutrition-associated cholestasis (PNAC) pathogenesis using a mouse model that recapitulates the human pathophysiology and combines intestinal injury with parenteral nutrition. We combine genetic, molecular, and pharmacological approaches to identify an essential function of hepatic macrophages and IL-1β in PNAC. Pharmacological antagonism of  IL-1 signaling or genetic deficiency in CCR2, caspase-1 and caspase-11, or IL-1 receptor (which binds both IL-1α and IL-1β) prevents PNAC in mice. IL-1β increases hepatocyte NF-κB signaling, which interferes with farnesoid X receptor and liver X receptor bonding to respective promoters of canalicular bile and sterol transporter genes (Abcc2, Abcb11, and Abcg5/8), resulting in transcriptional suppression and subsequent cholestasis. Thus, hepatic macrophages, IL-1β, or NF-κB may be targets for restoring bile and sterol transport to treat PNAC.
Liver regeneration after simple resection represents a unique process in which the organ returns to its original size and histologic structure. Over the past 30 years, there has been significant progress in elucidating the mechanisms associated with regeneration after loss of hepatic mass. Liver regeneration after acute liver failure shares several of these classical pathways. It differs, however, in key processes, including the role of both differentiated and stemlike cells. This article outlines these differences in addition to new molecular mechanisms, including immunomodulation, microRNAs, and the gut-liver axis. In addition, applications to the patient population, including prognostication and stem cell therapies, are explored.
To provide an update on the prevalence, pathophysiology, disease associations, and treatment options for bile acid malabsorption (BAM).
•Molecular mechanisms-BAs prevent water reabsorption and increase water secretion by intracellular mediators, increasing aquaporin channels and intracellular permeability. •Inflammatory bowel disease-new molecular mechanisms of BAM are identified in patients without ileal disease, including changes in expression of ileal BA transporter and nuclear receptors involved in BA homeostasis. •Microscopic colitis-BAM is one of the mechanisms leading to microscopic colitis. •Diagnostic testing-new diagnostic tests have been launched in the USA (serum C4 and fecal 48-h BA excretion); stimulated FGF19 has higher detection of BAM compared to fasting sample alone. •Treatment-investigational FXR agonists may provide a daily, oral option for treatment of BAM instead of BA sequestrants. There is a greater appreciation of the biological role of bile acids across multiple fields of medicine, including gastrointestinal indications.
Farnesoid X receptor (FXR) as a member of nuclear receptor is tightly associated with glucose metabolism. Accumulated evidence has addressed the potential of FXR antagonist in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), although the related mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we determined a specific FXR antagonist HS218 (N-benzyl-N-(3-(tert-butyl)-4-hydroxyphenyl)-2,4-dichlorobenzamide), which exhibited high activities in suppressing gluconeogenesis and ameliorating glucose homeostasis in db/db and HFD/STZ-induced T2DM mice. We would like to investigate the mechanisms underlying FXR antagonism in the regulation of gluconeogenesis by using HS218 as a probe.
HS218 was evaluated by glucose output assay. Binding affinity of HS218 to the ligand binding domain of FXR (FXR-LBD) was detected by Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) technology-based Biacore and fluorescence quenching assays. Mammalian one-hybrid and transactivation assays were carried out to detect the antagonistic effect of HS218 on FXR. Real-time PCR assay was performed to measure the expressions of FXR-target and gluconeogenic genes. Anti-diabetic efficiencies of HS218 were determined in db/db and HFD/STZ-induced T2DM mice. Assays by promoter 5'-deletion analysis and Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) were performed to detect the binding of FXR to peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator-1α (PGC-1α) promoter. Western blot assay was used to determine the protein level in either cells or the liver tissues of mice.
We determined that HS218 as a new FXR specific antagonist could FXR-dependently suppress gluconeogenesis in mouse primary hepatocytes, and effectively improve glucose homeostasis in db/db and HFD/STZ-induced T2DM mice. HS218 decreased gluconeogenesis by inhibiting the FXR-induced increase in the promoter activity of the key gluconeogenic gene PGC-1α, leading to the repression of PGC-1α and its target gene peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα).
To our knowledge, our work might be the first report on the mechanism underlying FXR antagonist in the regulation of gluconeogenesis, and all results have also highlighted the potential of HS218 in the treatment of T2DM.
We attempted to clarify the therapeutic capability of antagonists of the farnesoid X receptor (FXR), a nuclear receptor that regulates lipid and bile acid metabolism. Herein, we report the antidyslipidemic effects of a novel synthesized FXR antagonist, compound-T1, utilizing a dyslipidemic hamster model. Compound-T1 selectively inhibited chenodeoxycholic acid-induced FXR activation (IC 50, 2.1 nmol·L-1). A hamster model of diet-induced hyperlipidemia was prepared to investigate the antidyslipidemic effects of compound-T1 through comparative studies of the nonstatin lipid-modulating agents ezetimibe, cholestyramine, and torcetrapib. In the hamster model, compound-T1 (6 mg·kg-1·day-1, p.o.) increased the level of plasma high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol (+22.2%) and decreased the levels of plasma non-HDL-cholesterol (-43.6%) and triglycerides (-31.1%). Compound-T1 also increased hepatic cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase expression and fecal bile acid excretion, and decreased hepatic cholesterol content. Moreover, the hamster model could reflect clinical results of other nonstatin agents. Torcetrapib especially increased large HDL particles compared with compound-T1. Additionally, in the human hepatoma Huh-7 cells, compound-T1 enhanced apolipoprotein A-I secretion at a concentration close to its IC 50 value for FXR. Our results indicated the usefulness of the hamster model in evaluating FXR antagonists and nonstatin agents. Notably, compound-T1 exhibited beneficial effects on both blood non-HDL-cholesterol and HDL-cholesterol, which are thought to involve enhancement of cholesterol catabolism and apolipoprotein A-I production. These findings aid the understanding of the antidyslipidemic potential of FXR antagonists with a unique lipid and bile acid modulation.
The name of chronic liver disease: primary biliary cirrhosis, has been changed to: primary biliary cholangitis, primarily because of the stigma associated with the word "cirrhosis", as only a minority of the patients develop cirrhosis. In this review we present data on epidemiology and discuss the current treatments with focus on ursodeoxycholic acid and the newly described effects of the farnesoid receptor agonist obeticholic acid.
Liver fibrosis, a major health concern worldwide, results from abnormal collagen deposition by activated hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) in an injured liver. The farnesoid-x-receptor (FXR) is a bile acid sensor that counteracts HSCs transdifferentiation. While targeting FXR holds promise, 6-ethyl-CDCA known as obeticholic acid, the first in class of FXR ligands, causes side effects, partially because the lack of selectivity toward GPBAR1, a putative itching receptor. Here, we describe the 3-deoxy-6-ethyl derivative of CDCA, BAR704, as a highly selective steroidal FXR agonist.
Liver Fibrosis was induced in mice by carbon tetrachloride (CCl4).
In transactivation assay BAR704 activated FXR with and EC50 of 967 nM while exerted no agonistic activity on other receptors including GPBAR1. In naïve mice, BAR704 modulated the expression of FXR target genes in the liver of wild type mice but not in FXR-/- mice. In cirrhotic mice, administration of BAR704, 15 mg/kg for 9 weeks, spared the liver biosynthetic activity (bilirubin and albumin plasma levels), reduced liver fibrosis score (Sirius red staining), expression of pro-fibrogenetic (Colα1α, TGFβ and αSMA) and inflammatory genes (IL-1β, TNFα) and portal pressure. From mechanistic stand point, we have found that exposure of LX2 cells, a human HSCs line, to BAR704 increased the transcription of the short heterodimer partner (SHP) and induced the binding of this nuclear receptor to SMAD3, thus abrogating the binding of phosho-SMAD3 to the TGFβ promoter.
BAR704 is a selective FXR agonist that reduces liver fibrosis by interfering with the TGFβ-SMAD3 pathway in HSCs. Selective FXR agonists may represent an attractive strategy for the treatment of liver fibrosis.
Bile acids activate farnesoid X receptor (FXR) and G protein-coupled bile acid receptor-1 (aka Takeda G protein-coupled receptor-5 [TGR5]) to regulate bile acid metabolism and glucose and insulin sensitivity. FXR and TGR5 are coexpressed in the enteroendocrine L cells, but their roles in integrated regulation of metabolism are not completely understood. We reported recently that activation of FXR induces TGR5 to stimulate glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) secretion to improve insulin sensitivity and hepatic metabolism. In this study, we used the intestine-restricted FXR agonist fexaramine (FEX) to study the effect of activation of intestinal FXR on the gut microbiome, bile acid metabolism, and FXR and TGR5 signaling. The current study revealed that FEX markedly increased taurolithocholic acid, increased secretion of fibroblast growth factors 15 and 21 and GLP-1, improved insulin and glucose tolerance, and promoted white adipose tissue browning in mice. Analysis of 16S ribosomal RNA sequences of the gut microbiome identified the FEX-induced and lithocholic acid-producing bacteria Acetatifactor and Bacteroides. Antibiotic treatment completely reversed the FEX-induced metabolic phenotypes and inhibited taurolithocholic acid synthesis, adipose tissue browning, and liver bile acid synthesis gene expression but further increased intestinal FXR target gene expression. FEX treatment effectively improved lipid profiles, increased GLP-1 secretion, improved glucose and insulin tolerance, and promoted adipose tissue browning, while antibiotic treatment reversed the beneficial metabolic effects of FEX in obese and diabetic mice.
This study uncovered a mechanism in which activation of intestinal FXR shaped the gut microbiota to activate TGR5/GLP-1 signaling to improve hepatic glucose and insulin sensitivity and increase adipose tissue browning; the gut microbiota plays a critical role in bile acid metabolism and signaling to regulate metabolic homeostasis in health and disease. (Hepatology 2018).
Accumulation of toxic bile acids in liver could cause cholestasis and liver injury. The purpose of the current study is to evaluate the hepatoprotective effect of yangonin, a product isolated from an edible botanical Kava against lithocholic acid (LCA)-induced cholestasis, and further to elucidate the involvement of farnesoid X receptor (FXR) in the anticholestatic effect using in vivo and in vitro experiments. The cholestatic liver injury model was established by intraperitoneal injections of LCA in C57BL/6 mice. Serum biomarkers and H&amp;E staining were used to identify the amelioration of cholestasis after yangonin treatment. Mice hepatocytes culture, gene silencing experiment, real-time PCR and Western blot assay were used to elucidate the mechanisms underlying yangonin hepatoprotection. The results indicated that yangonin promoted bile acid efflux and reduced hepatic uptake via an induction in FXR-target genes Bsep, Mrp2 expression and an inhibition in Ntcp, all of which are responsible for bile acid transport. Furthermore, yangonin reduced bile acid synthesis through repressing FXR-target genes Cyp7a1 and Cyp8b1, and increased bile acid metabolism through an induction in gene expression of Sult2a1, which are involved in bile acid synthesis and metabolism. In addition, yangonin suppressed liver inflammation through repressing inflammation-related gene NF-κB, TNF-α and IL-1β. In vitro evidences showed that the changes in transporters and enzymes induced by yangonin were abrogated when FXR was silenced. In conclusions, yangonin produces protective effect against LCA-induced hepatotoxity and cholestasis due to FXR-mediated regulation. Yangonin may be an effective approach for the prevention against cholestatic liver diseases.
The goal of this study was to identify the intrinsic links that explain the effect of a Western diet (WD) on cognitive dysfunction. Specific pathogen-free, wild-type mice were fed either a control diet (CD) or a high-fat, high-sucrose WD after weaning and were euthanized at 10 mo of age to study the pathways that affect cognitive health. The results showed that long-term WD intake reduced hippocampal synaptic plasticity and the level of brain-derived neurotrophic factor mRNA in the brain and isolated microglia. A WD also activated ERK1/2 and reduced postsynaptic density-95 in the brain, suggesting postsynaptic damage. Moreover, WD-fed mice had increased inflammatory signaling in the brain, ileum, liver, adipose tissue, and spleen, which was accompanied by microglia activation. In the brain, as well as in the digestive tract, a WD reduced signaling regulated by retinoic acid and bile acids (BAs), whose receptors form heterodimers to control metabolism and inflammation. Furthermore, a WD intake caused dysbiosis and dysregulated BA synthesis with reduced endogenous ligands for BA receptors, i.e., farnesoid X receptor and G-protein-coupled bile acid receptor in the liver and brain. Together, dysregulated BA synthesis and dysbiosis were accompanied by systemic inflammation, microglial activation, and reduced neuroplasticity induced by WD.-Jena, P. K., Sheng, L., Di Lucente, J., Jin, L.-W., Maezawa, I., Wan, Y.-J. Y. Dysregulated bile acid synthesis and dysbiosis are implicated in Western diet-induced systemic inflammation, microglial activation, and reduced neuroplasticity.
Impaired regulation of bile acid (BA) homeostasis has been suggested to be associated with adverse metabolic consequences. However, whether BA homeostasis is altered in diabetes-induced cognitive dysfunction (DCD) remains unknown. In the present study, mice were divided into four groups, namely normal control (NC) group, high-fat diet (HFD) group, diabetes without cognitive dysfunction (unDCD) group, and DCD group. Compared to HFD mice, the concentration of total BAs in liver was higher in unDCD and DCD mice, due to increased intestinal BA absorption. DCD mice tended to have higher BA concentrations in both liver and ileum than unDCD mice. Consequently, DCD mice had increased basolateral BA efflux (Ostα, Ostβ, and Mrp4) and decreased BA synthesis (Cyp7a1, Cyp8b1, and Cyp7b1) in the liver as well as activated Fxr-Fgf15 signaling in the ileum. DCD mice also had increased BA hydroxylation (Cyp3a11) and BA sulfation (Sult2a1) in the liver compared to HFD mice. Furthermore, the bacterial community composition was altered in the cecum of DCD mice, characterized with a marked increase in Defferribacteres and Candidatus Saccharibacteria. In summary, the present study provides the first comprehensive analysis of BA homeostasis in DCD mice, and revealed a potential role of BAs in DCD development.
To characterize the efficacy of the dual FXR/TGR5 receptor agonist INT-767 upon histological endpoints in a rodent model of diet-induced and biopsy-confirmed non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH).
The effects of INT-767 on histological features of NASH were assessed in two studies using Lepob/ob (ob/ob) NASH mice fed the AMLN diet (high fat with trans-fat, cholesterol and fructose). In a proof-of-concept study, Lepob/ob (ob/ob) NASH mice were first dosed with INT-767 (3 or 10 mg/kg for 8 wk). A second ob/ob NASH study compared INT-767 (3 and 10 mg/kg) to obeticholic acid (OCA) (10 or 30 mg/kg; 16 wk). Primary histological endpoints included qualitative and quantitative assessments of NASH. Other metabolic and plasma endpoints were also assessed. A comparative assessment of INT-767 and OCA effects on drug distribution and hepatic gene expression was performed in C57Bl/6 mice on standard chow. C57Bl/6 mice were orally dosed with INT-767 or OCA (1-30 mg/kg) for 2 wk, and expression levels of candidate genes were assessed by RNA sequencing and tissue drug levels were measured by liquid chromatography tandem-mass spectrometry.
INT-767 dose-dependently (3 and 10 mg/kg, PO, QD, 8 wk) improved qualitative morphometric scores on steatohepatitis severity, inflammatory infiltrates and fibrosis stage. Quantitative morphometric analyses revealed that INT-767 reduced parenchymal collagen area, collagen fiber density, inflammation (assessed by Galectin-3 immunohistochemistry) and hepatocyte lipid droplet area following INT-767 treatment. In a comparative study (16 wk), the FXR agonists OCA (10 and 30 mg/kg) and INT-767 (3 and 10 mg/kg) both improved NASH histopathology, with INT-767 exerting greater therapeutic potency and efficacy than OCA. Mechanistic studies suggest that both drugs accumulate similarly within the liver and ileum, however, the effects of INT-767 may be driven by enhanced hepatic, but not ileal, FXR function.
These findings confirm the potential utility of FXR and dual FXR/TGR5 activation as disease intervention strategies in NASH.
The effects of farnesoid X receptor (FXR) antagonists on plasma lipid profile in mice have not been investigated thus far. The aim of this study was to investigate the antidyslipidemic effects of an FXR antagonist in dyslipidemic mice, and to clarify the mechanisms underlying the lipid modulatory effect.
Compound-T0 (1-100 mg/kg) was orally administered to C57BL/6J mice fed a Western-type diet or low-density lipoprotein receptor knockout (LDLR-/-) mice fed a Western-type diet for a week, and plasma lipid levels were investigated. Effects on lipid clearance, hepatic triglyceride secretion after Triton WR-1339 challenge, and intestinal lipid absorption were investigated after multiple dosing.
Compound-T0 significantly increased plasma level of non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in both C57BL/6 and LDLR-/- mice; in addition, it significantly increased plasma triglyceride level in LDLR-/- mice. Compound-T0 failed to enhance the clearance of 3,3'-dioctadecylindocarbocyanine (DiI)-labeled LDL in C57BL/6J mice. Although compound-T0 did not affect triglyceride clearance and hepatic triglyceride secretion, it significantly increased intestinal [3H]cholesterol absorption in LDLR-/- mice.
It was found that the FXR antagonist, compound-T0 exacerbated dyslipidemia in mice because it enhanced intestinal lipid absorption via acceleration of bile acid excretion.
The purpose of the present study was to investigate the effect and potential mechanism of chlorogenic acid (CA) on liver injury induced by cholestasis in a rat model of bile duct ligation (BDL).
Rats received vehicle or CA (20, 50, or 100 mg/kg per day) orally for 3 days. On the 4th day, the rats underwent sham or BDL surgery, and were orally administrated vehicle or CA for 3 or 7 days. mRNA and protein expression levels were evaluated by qRT-PCR and western blot.
After BDL, plasma levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), total bilirubin (TBIL), and total bile acids (TBA) were increased and typical pathological changes were observed in liver morphology. Hepatic uptake transporters (Ntcp, Oatp 1a4, and Oatp 1b2) were downregulated, while efflux transporters (Bsep and Mrp 2/3/4) were upregulated. BDL inhibited the expressions of Cyp7a1, Cyp8b1, and Cyp27a1 and induced Ugt1a1. CA treatment decreased ALT, AST, TBIL, and TBA (P &lt; 0.05) and alleviated the liver pathological changes. The degree of expression changes in the transporters and enzymes was extended by CA (P &lt; 0.05). SIRT1 protein was induced after CA treatment in BDL rats.
Chlorogenic acid attenuated hepatotoxicity and cholestasis by decreasing the uptake and synthesis of bilirubin and bile acids and accelerating the metabolism and efflux of bilirubin and bile acids.
The intestinal epithelium constitutes an innate barrier which, upon injury, undergoes self-repair processes known as restitution. Although bile acids are known as important regulators of epithelial function in health and disease, their effects on wound healing processes are not yet clear. Here we set out to investigate the effects of the colonic bile acids, deoxycholic acid (DCA) and ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA), on epithelial restitution. Wound healing in T84 cell monolayers grown on transparent, permeable supports was assessed over 48 h with or without bile acids. Cell migration was measured in Boyden chambers. mRNA and protein expression were measured by RT-PCR and Western blotting. DCA (50-150 µM) significantly inhibited wound closure in cultured epithelial monolayers and attenuated cell migration in Boyden chamber assays. DCA also induced nuclear accumulation of the farnesoid X receptor (FXR), whereas an FXR agonist, GW4064 (10 µM), inhibited wound closure. Both DCA and GW4064 attenuated the expression of CFTR Cl- channels, whereas inhibition of CFTR activity with either CFTR-inh-172 (10 µM) or GlyH-101 (25 µM) also prevented wound healing. Promoter/reporter assays revealed that FXR-induced downregulation of CFTR is mediated at the transcriptional level. In contrast, UDCA (50-150 µM) enhanced wound healing in vitro and prevented the effects of DCA. Finally, DCA inhibited and UDCA promoted mucosal healing in an in vivo mouse model. In conclusion, these studies suggest bile acids are important regulators of epithelial wound healing and are therefore good targets for development of new drugs to modulate intestinal barrier function in disease treatment. NEW &amp; NOTEWORTHY The secondary bile acid, deoxycholic acid, inhibits colonic epithelial wound healing, an effect which appears to be mediated by activation of the nuclear bile acid receptor, FXR, with subsequent downregulation of CFTR expression and activity. In contrast, ursodeoxycholic acid promotes wound healing, suggesting it may provide an alternative approach to prevent the losses of barrier function that are associated with mucosal inflammation in IBD patients.
We previously showed that increased asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) biliary excretion occurs during hepatic ischemia/reperfusion (I/R), prompting us to study the effects of the farnesoid X receptor (FXR) agonist obeticholic acid (OCA) on bile, serum and tissue levels of ADMA after I/R.
Male Wistar rats were orally administered 10mg/kg/day of OCA or vehicle for 5 days and were subjected to 60 min partial hepatic ischemia or sham-operated. After a 60 min reperfusion, serum, tissue and bile ADMA levels, liver mRNA and protein expression of ADMA transporters (CAT-1, CAT-2A, CAT-2B, OCT-1, MATE-1), and enzymes involved in ADMA synthesis (protein-arginine-N-methyltransferase-1, PRMT-1) and metabolism (dimethylarginine-dimethylaminohydrolase-1, DDAH-1) were measured.
OCA administration induced a further increase in biliary ADMA levels both in sham and I/R groups, with no significant changes in hepatic ADMA content. A reduction in CAT-1, CAT-2A or CAT-2B transcripts was found in OCA-treated sham-operated rats compared with vehicle. Conversely, OCA administration did not change CAT-1, CAT-2A or CAT-2B expression, already reduced by I/R. However, a marked decrease in OCT-1 and increase in MATE-1 expression was observed. A similar trend occurred with protein expression.
The reduced mRNA expression of hepatic CAT transporters suggests that the increase in serum ADMA levels is probably due to decreased liver uptake of ADMA from the systemic circulation. Conversely, the mechanism involved in further increasing biliary ADMA levels in sham and I/R groups treated with OCA appears to be MATE-1-dependent.
Bile acids (BAs) are cholesterol-derived metabolites that facilitate the intestinal absorption and transport of dietary lipids. Recently, BAs also emerged as pivotal signaling molecules controlling glucose, lipid, and energy metabolism by binding to the nuclear hormone farnesoid X receptor (FXR) and Takeda G protein receptor 5 (TGR5) in multiple organs, leading to regulation of intestinal incretin secretion, hepatic gluconeogenesis, glycogen synthesis, energy expenditure, inflammation, and gut microbiome configuration. Alterations in BA metabolism and signaling are associated with obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), whereas treatment of T2DM patients with BA sequestrants, or bariatric surgery in morbidly obese patients, results in a significant improvement in glycemic response that is associated with changes in the BA profile and signaling. Herein, we review the roles of BAs in glucose metabolism in health and disease; highlight the limitations, unknowns, and challenges in understanding the impact of BAs on the glycemic response; and discuss how this knowledge may be harnessed to develop innovative therapeutic approaches for the treatment of hyperglycemia and diabetes.
In recent decades, our knowledge of bile salts has undergone a vast development, and bile salts are now known not only for their detergent properties that aid in the absorption of dietary lipids but also for their interaction with specific nuclear and membrane receptors. In particular, it has been realized that the response of the farnesoid X receptor (FXR) to bile acids provides a signal bridge between the liver and small intestine, controlling the intracellular levels, biosynthesis, and enterohepatic circulation of bile acids. Therefore, FXR and bile acid signaling has become an attractive target for treatment of, for example, cholestatic liver diseases, diabetes, and colorectal cancer. Previously, interest in the structure and chemistry of bile salts has focused on their cellular toxicity and involvement in digestion. However, insight into the extensive variation in the structure of bile salts in vertebrates and the concurrent evolution of the FXR has become increasingly important as their role as signal molecules has become clearer. In this review, we therefore focus on common structural features of bile salts as well as evolutionary aspects of bile salts and the FXR in vertebrates. Ultimately, a better understanding of the evolution of bile salts and the FXR may expand our knowledge of their function in health and disease, including their function outside the gastrointestinal tract, and aid in the development of new strategies for treatment.
In most cholestatic liver diseases the primary cholestasis-causing lesions are located in the biliary tree and may be of (auto)immune origin. Bile salts are responsible for the secondary toxic consequences. Bile salt and nuclear hormone directed therapies primarily aim at improving this secondary toxic injury. In primary biliary cholangitis, trials show statistically significant responses on biochemical endpoints. Preclinical studies suggest that FXR- and PPAR-agonists, inhibitors of the apical sodium-dependent bile salt transporter (ASBT-inhibitors) and the C23 UDCA derivative nor-UDCA are promising agents for the treatment of primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC). Area covered: Pharmaceuticals that interfere with bile salt signaling in humans for the treatment of chronic cholestatic liver disease are reviewed. Expert commentary: Nuclear hormone receptors, bile salt transport proteins and receptors provide targets for novel therapies of cholestatic liver disease. These drugs show positive results on biochemical endpoints. For histological endpoints, survival and transplant-free survival, long-term trials are needed. For relief of symptoms, such as fatigue and pruritus, these drugs have yet to prove their value.
Date palm fruit (Phoenix dactylifera) consumption reduces serum triglyceride levels in human subjects. The objective of this study was to prepare an extract from dates and determine whether it acts as a ligand for the farnesoid x receptor (FXR), a nuclear receptor important for maintaining triglyceride and cholesterol homeostasis. Freeze-dried extracts were isolated from California-grown dates (Deglet Noor and Medjool) from the 2014 and 2015 harvests, by means of liquid extraction and solid phase separation. Each date palm extract (DPE) was characterized via HPLC and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry, and the procyanidin content was qualitatively determined. Extracts were tested to determine their ability to modulate nuclear receptor-mediated transactivation using transient transfection. The effect of DPE on FXR-target genes regulating bile acid absorption and transport was then assessed in vitro, in Caco-2 cells. Characterization reveals that DPE is a rich source of polyphenols including hydroxycinnamic acids, proanthocyanidins, and lipohilic polyphenols, and comprises 13% proanthocyanidins. Transactivation results show that DPE acts as a co-agonist ligand for both mouse and human FXR, wherein it activates bile acid-bound FXR greater than that seen with bile acid alone. Additionally, DPE alone activated a peroxisome proliferator activated receptor alpha (PPARα) chimera in a dose-dependent manner. Consistent with DPE as a co-agonist ligand for FXR, studies in Caco-2 cells reveal that co-incubation with bile acid, dose-dependently enhances the expression of fibroblast growth factor 19 (FGF19), compared to treatment with bile acid alone. In contrast, DPE inhibited bile acid-induced expression of ileal bile acid binding protein (IBABP). Our results demonstrate that DPE acts as a potent co-agonist ligand for FXR, and that it differentially regulates FXR-target gene expression in vitro in human intestinal cells. This study provides novel insight into a potential mechanism by which dates may exert a hypotriglyceridemic effect via FXR and modulation of bile acid homeostasis.
Glucuronidation is considered an important detoxification pathway of bile acids especially in cholestatic conditions. Glucuronides are less toxic than the parent free forms and are more easily excreted in urine. However, the pathophysiological significance of bile acid glucuronidation is still controversial and debated among the scientific community. Progress in this field has been strongly limited by the lack of appropriate methods for the preparation of pure glucuronides in the amount needed for biological and pharmacological studies. In this work, we have developed a new synthesis of bile acid C3-glucuronides enabling the convenient preparation of gram-scale quantities. The synthesized compounds have been characterized in terms of physicochemical properties and abilities to modulate key nuclear receptors including the farnesoid X receptor (FXR). In particular, we found that C3-glucuronides of chenodeoxycholic acid and lithocholic acid, respectively the most abundant and potentially cytotoxic species formed in patients affected by cholestasis, behave as FXR agonists and positively regulate the gene expression of transporter proteins, the function of which is critical in human conditions related to imbalances of bile acid homeostasis.
Accurate in silico prediction of protein-ligand binding affinities has been a primary objective of structure-based drug design for decades due to the putative value it would bring to the drug discovery process. However, computational methods have historically failed to deliver value in real-world drug discovery applications due to a variety of scientific, technical, and practical challenges. Recently, a family of approaches commonly referred to as relative binding free energy (RBFE) calculations, which rely on physics-based molecular simulations and statistical mechanics, have shown promise in reliably generating accurate predictions in the context of drug discovery projects. This advance arises from accumulating developments in the underlying scientific methods (decades of research on force fields and sampling algorithms) coupled with vast increases in computational resources (graphics processing units and cloud infrastructures). Mounting evidence from retrospective validation studies, blind challenge predictions, and prospective applications suggests that RBFE simulations can now predict the affinity differences for congeneric ligands with sufficient accuracy and throughput to deliver considerable value in hit-to-lead and lead optimization efforts. Here, we present an overview of current RBFE implementations, highlighting recent advances and remaining challenges, along with examples that emphasize practical considerations for obtaining reliable RBFE results. We focus specifically on relative binding free energies because the calculations are less computationally intensive than absolute binding free energy (ABFE) calculations and map directly onto the hit-to-lead and lead optimization processes, where the prediction of relative binding energies between a reference molecule and new ideas (virtual molecules) can be used to prioritize molecules for synthesis. We describe the critical aspects of running RBFE calculations, from both theoretical and applied perspectives, using a combination of retrospective literature examples and prospective studies from drug discovery projects. This work is intended to provide a contemporary overview of the scientific, technical, and practical issues associated with running relative binding free energy simulations, with a focus on real-world drug discovery applications. We offer guidelines for improving the accuracy of RBFE simulations, especially for challenging cases, and emphasize unresolved issues that could be improved by further research in the field.
Intestinal bacteria are known to regulate bile acid (BA) homeostasis via intestinal biotransformation of BAs and stimulation of the expression of fibroblast growth factor 19 through intestinal nuclear farnesoid X receptor (FXR). On the other hand, BAs directly regulate the gut microbiota with their strong antimicrobial activities. It remains unclear, however, how mammalian BAs cross-talk with gut microbiome and shape microbial composition in a dynamic and interactive way.
We quantitatively profiled small molecule metabolites derived from host-microbial co-metabolism in mice, demonstrating that BAs were the most significant factor correlated with microbial alterations among all types of endogenous metabolites. A high-fat diet (HFD) intervention resulted in a rapid and significant increase in the intestinal BA pool within 12 h, followed by an alteration in microbial composition at 24 h, providing supporting evidence that BAs are major dietary factors regulating gut microbiota. Feeding mice with BAs along with a normal diet induced an obese phenotype and obesity-associated gut microbial composition, similar to HFD-fed mice. Inhibition of hepatic BA biosynthesis under HFD conditions attenuated the HFD-induced gut microbiome alterations. Both inhibition of BAs and direct suppression of microbiota improved obese phenotypes.
Our study highlights a liver-BA-gut microbiome metabolic axis that drives significant modifications of BA and microbiota compositions capable of triggering metabolic disorders, suggesting new therapeutic strategies targeting BA metabolism for metabolic diseases.
The aim of this study was to investigate the ameliorative effects of corilagin on intrahepatic cholestasis induced by regulating liver farnesoid X receptor (FXR)-associated pathways in vitro and in vivo.
Cellular and animal models were treated with different concentrations of corilagin. In the cellular experiments, FXR expression was up-regulated by either lentiviral transduction or GW4064 treatment and down-regulated by either siRNA technology or treatment with guggulsterones. Real-time PCR and Western blotting were employed to detect the mRNA and protein levels of FXR, SHP1, SHP2, UGT2B4, BSEP, CYP7A1, CYP7B1, NTCP, MRP2 and SULT2A1. Immunohistochemistry was used to examine the expression of BSEP in liver tissues. Rat liver function and pathological changes in hepatic tissue were assessed using biochemical tests and haematoxylin and eosin staining.
Corilagin increased the mRNA and protein levels of FXR, SHP1, SHP2, UGT2B4, BSEP, MRP2 and SULT2A1, and decreased those of CYP7A1, CYP7B1 and NTCP. After either up- or down-regulating FXR using different methods, corilagin could still increase the mRNA and protein levels of FXR, SHP1, SHP2, UGT2B4, BSEP, MRP2 and SULT2A1 and decrease the protein levels of CYP7A1, CYP7B1 and NTCP, especially when administered at a high concentration. Corilagin also exerted a notable effect on the pathological manifestations of intrahepatic cholestasis, BSEP staining in liver tissues and liver function.
Corilagin exerts a protective effect in hepatocytes and can prevent the deleterious activities of intrahepatic cholestasis by stimulating FXR-associated pathways.
Obeticholic acid (OCA) is a semisynthetic farnesoid X receptor (FXR) agonist, an analogue of chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) which is indicated for the treatment of primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) in combination with ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA). OCA efficiently inhibits bile acid synthesis and promotes bile acid efflux via activating FXR-mediated mechanisms in a physiologically relevant in vitro cell system, Sandwich-cultured Transporter Certified ™ human primary hepatocytes (SCHH). The study herein evaluated the effects of UDCA alone or in combination with OCA in SCHH. UDCA (≤100 μmol/L) alone did not inhibit CYP7A1 mRNA, and thus, no reduction in the endogenous bile acid pool observed. UDCA ≤100 μmol/L concomitantly administered with 0.1 μmol/L OCA had no effect on bile acid synthesis beyond what was observed with OCA alone. Furthermore, this study evaluated human Caco-2 cells (clone C2BBe1) as in vitro intestinal models. Glycine conjugate of OCA increased mRNA levels of FXR target genes in Caco-2 cells, FGF-19, SHP, OSTα/β, and IBABP, but not ASBT, in a concentration-dependent manner, while glycine conjugate of UDCA had no effect on the expression of these genes. The results suggested that UDCA ≤100 μmol/L did not activate FXR in human primary hepatocytes or intestinal cell line Caco-2. Thus, co-administration of UDCA with OCA did not affect OCA-dependent pharmacological effects.
The Drug Design Data Resource (D3R) ran Grand Challenge 2 (GC2) from September 2016 through February 2017. This challenge was based on a dataset of structures and affinities for the nuclear receptor farnesoid X receptor (FXR), contributed by F. Hoffmann-La Roche. The dataset contained 102 IC50 values, spanning six orders of magnitude, and 36 high-resolution co-crystal structures with representatives of four major ligand classes. Strong global participation was evident, with 49 participants submitting 262 prediction submission packages in total. Procedurally, GC2 mimicked Grand Challenge 2015 (GC2015), with a Stage 1 subchallenge testing ligand pose prediction methods and ranking and scoring methods, and a Stage 2 subchallenge testing only ligand ranking and scoring methods after the release of all blinded co-crystal structures. Two smaller curated sets of 18 and 15 ligands were developed to test alchemical free energy methods. This overview summarizes all aspects of GC2, including the dataset details, challenge procedures, and participant results. We also consider implications for progress in the field, while highlighting methodological areas that merit continued development. Similar to GC2015, the outcome of GC2 underscores the pressing need for methods development in pose prediction, particularly for ligand scaffolds not currently represented in the Protein Data Bank ( http://www.pdb.org ), and in affinity ranking and scoring of bound ligands.
Bile acids (BAs) circulate between the liver and intestine, and regulate the homeostasis of glucose, lipid, and energy. Recent studies demonstrated an essential role of BAs in neurological diseases, suggesting an interaction between BAs and the nervous system. In the present study, we showed that impaired vagus function in rats induced by vagotomy resulted in an increase in bile flow without causing liver injury. The concentrations of unconjugated and glycine-conjugated BAs were increased in both serum and bile of rats after vagotomy, which was due to impaired tight junctions and thus increased passive absorption of BAs in the intestine. Vagotomy markedly suppressed the expression of the rate-limiting BA synthetic enzyme Cyp7a1, which was not due to activation of Fxr-Shp signaling in the liver, but due to activation of Fxr-Fgf15 signaling in the intestine. Furthermore, vagotomy produced a BA profile in the bile favorable for Fxr activation by decreasing tauro-β-muricholic acid, a natural Fxr antagonist, and increasing glyco-chenodeoxycholic acid, a natural Fxr agonist. In summary, the present study provides the first comprehensive analysis of the critical role of the vagus nerve in regulating BA metabolism and signaling pathway.
Bile acids are endocrine molecules that in addition to facilitating the absorption of fat-soluble nutrients regulate numerous metabolic processes, including glucose, lipid, and energy homeostasis. The signaling actions of bile acids are mediated through specific bile-acid-activated nuclear and membrane-bound receptors. These receptors are not only expressed by tissues within the enterohepatic circulation such as the liver and the intestine, but also in other organs where bile acids mediate their systemic actions. In this review, we discuss bile acid signaling and the interplay with the gut microbiota in the pathophysiology of obesity, type 2 diabetes, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, and the role of surgical and pharmacological interventions on bile acid profiles and metabolism.
Cholestasis, as a main manifestation, induces liver injury during sepsis. The farnesoid X receptor (FXR) plays an important role in regulating bile acid homeostasis. Whether FXR activation by its agonist obeticholic acid (OCA) is contributed to improve sepsis-induced liver injury remains unknown.
The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of OCA on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced acute liver injury in mice.
8-week old male C57BL/6J mice were randomly divided into control group, LPS group, oral OCA group and LPS plus oral OCA (LPS + OCA) group. The serum and livers were collected for further analysis. Serum levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), total bile acid (TBA) and total bilirubin (TBIL) were measured at indicated time after LPS administration. Liver sections were stained with hematoxylin &amp; eosin (H&amp;E). Orally OCA pretreatment stimulated the expression of FXR and BSEP in livers and protected mice from LPS-induced hepatocyte apoptosis and inflammatory infiltration. Consistently, LPS-induced higher serum levels of ALT, AST, TBA and TBIL were significantly reversed by OCA administration. Meanwhile, the mRNA levels of interleukin 1β (IL-1β), tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) and IL-6 were decreased in livers of mice in LPS + OCA group compared with LPS group. Further investigation indicated that the higher expression of ATF4 and LC3II/I were associated with the protective effect of OCA on LPS-induced liver injury.
Orally OCA pretreatment protects mice from LPS-induced liver injury possibly contributed by improved bile acid homeostasis, decreased inflammatory factors and ATF4-mediated autophagy activity in hepatocytes.
Farnesoid X receptor (FXR) and G-protein-coupled bile acid receptor 1 (GPBAR1) are two important bile acid (BA) receptors. As non-BAs drug template for GPBAR1, none of the natural oleanane-type triterpenes have been reported as FXR ligands, despite FXR and GPBAR1 having similar binding pockets for BAs. Here, we report the natural triterpene hedragonic acid that has been isolated from the stem and root of Celastrus orbiculatus Thunb. (COT) as an effective agonist for FXR. Both biochemical amplified luminescent proximity homogeneous assay and cell-based reporter assays showed that hedragonic acid regulated the transcriptional activity of FXR. Circular dichroism spectroscopy further suggested the conformational changes of FXR upon the binding of hedragonic acid. Interestingly, the crystal structure of hedragonic acid-bound FXR revealed a unique binding mode with hedragonic acid occupying a novel binding pocket different from the classic binding position. The structural comparison between hedragonic acid-bound FXR and oleanolic acid-bound GPBAR1 explained the molecular basis for the selectivity of oleanane-type triterpenes for FXR. Moreover, hedragonic acid treatment protected mice from liver injury induced by acetaminophen overdose and decreased hepatic inflammatory responses in an FXR-dependent manner, suggesting that hedragonic acid might be one of the major components of COT for its multifunctional pharmaceutical uses. In conclusion, our results provide novel structure templates for drug design based on natural triterpenes by targeting FXR and/or GPBAR1 with pharmaceutical values.
Alcoholic liver disease (ALD) is associated with changes in the intestinal microbiota. Functional consequences of alcohol-associated dysbiosis are largely unknown. The aim of this study was to identify a mechanism of how changes in the intestinal microbiota contribute to ALD. Metagenomic sequencing of intestinal contents demonstrated that chronic ethanol feeding in mice is associated with an over-representation of bacterial genomic DNA encoding choloylglycine hydrolase, which deconjugates bile acids in the intestine. Bile acid analysis confirmed an increased amount of unconjugated bile acids in the small intestine after ethanol administration. Mediated by a lower farnesoid X receptor (FXR) activity in enterocytes, lower fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-15 protein secretion was associated with increased hepatic cytochrome P450 enzyme (Cyp)-7a1 protein expression and circulating bile acid levels. Depletion of the commensal microbiota with nonabsorbable antibiotics attenuated hepatic Cyp7a1 expression and reduced ALD in mice, suggesting that increased bile acid synthesis is dependent on gut bacteria. To restore intestinal FXR activity, we used a pharmacological intervention with the intestine-restricted FXR agonist fexaramine, which protected mice from ethanol-induced liver injury. Whereas bile acid metabolism was only minimally altered, fexaramine treatment stabilized the gut barrier and significantly modulated hepatic genes involved in lipid metabolism. To link the beneficial metabolic effect to FGF15, a nontumorigenic FGF19 variant-a human FGF15 ortholog-was overexpressed in mice using adeno-associated viruses. FGF19 treatment showed similarly beneficial metabolic effects and ameliorated alcoholic steatohepatitis.
Taken together, alcohol-associated metagenomic changes result in alterations of bile acid profiles. Targeted interventions improve bile acid-FXR-FGF15 signaling by modulation of hepatic Cyp7a1 and lipid metabolism, and reduce ethanol-induced liver disease in mice. (Hepatology 2018;67:2150-2166).
The farnesoid X receptor (FXR) is a nuclear receptor that acts as a master regulator of bile acid metabolism and signaling. Activation of FXR inhibits bile acid synthesis and increases bile acid conjugation, transport, and excretion, thereby protecting the liver from the harmful effects of bile accumulation, leading to considerable interest in FXR as a therapeutic target for the treatment of cholestasis and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. We identified a novel series of highly potent non-bile acid FXR agonists that introduce a bicyclic nortropine-substituted benzothiazole carboxylic acid moiety onto a trisubstituted isoxazole scaffold. Herein, we report the discovery of 1 (tropifexor, LJN452), a novel and highly potent agonist of FXR. Potent in vivo activity was demonstrated in rodent PD models by measuring the induction of FXR target genes in various tissues. Tropifexor has advanced into phase 2 human clinical trials in patients with NASH and PBC.
Mice lacking farnesoid X receptor (FXR) are used as a model for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease because their livers exhibit hepatomegaly, hepatic steatosis, and hepatic inflammation. The influence of fish oil feeding on hepatomegaly and disrupted hepatic function was investigated using female Fxr-null mice and wild-type mice fed a fish oil diet (2% fish oil and 2% corn oil) or a control diet (4% corn oil) for 4 weeks. Hepatic n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) levels, including 22:6 n-3 docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and 20:5 n-3 eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) were significantly higher in the fish oil group than those in the control group of Fxr-null mice and wild-type mice. Fxr-null mouse livers of the control group showed a whitish brown coloration, whereas Fxr-null mouse livers of the fish oil group showed a dark brown coloration similar to that of wild-type mice. The liver in Fxr-null mice of the fish oil group was smaller than that of the control group. There was a significant decrease in the levels of hepatic damage-associated diagnostic markers, hepatic and serum bile acids, triglycerides, free fatty acids, and total cholesterol levels in Fxr-null mice because of fish oil feeding. It also reversed elevated mRNA levels of oxidative stress-related genes (Hmox1, Gsta1, and Gsta2) and reduced mRNA levels of transcriptional factors (Pparα and Shp) in Fxr-null mice. These results suggest that fish oil feeding reverses hepatomegaly and disrupted hepatic function due to the lack of FXR signaling.
Colorectal cancer (CRC) is among the most common malignancies of the digestive system. Dysregulation of miRNAs and the farnesoid X receptor (FXR) are involved in the progression of CRC. In the present study, the effects of FXR and miR‑135A1 in CRC were evaluated. Reverse transcription quantitative‑polymerase chain reaction (RT‑qPCR) was used to examine the expression of miR‑135A1 in patient CRC tissues and adjacent non‑tumor tissues, as well as cell lines. The association between miR‑135A1 and clinical characteristics of patients with CRC was also investigated. RT‑qPCR and western blotting were used to evaluate the expression of miR‑135A1 targets. Regulation of cyclin G2 (CCNG2) by miR‑135A1was confirmed using luciferase assays. The biological effects of miR‑135A1 were assessed in transfected and untransfected CRC cell lines using colony formation assays, cell‑cycle analysis by flow cytometry, and CCK‑8 assays. miR‑135A1 was upregulated in CRC specimens and cell lines. miR‑135A1 expression was strongly associated with poor cell differentiation, high expression of carbohydrate antigen (CA)125, CA199, carcinoembryonic antigen and survival rate of patients with CRC. Expression of CCNG2 was downregulated in CRC patients and cell lines, and was further demonstrated to be among the downstream targets of miR‑135A1. The present study indicated that inhibition of miR‑135A1 expression leads to cell cycle arrest and inhibition of proliferation of CRC cells via increasing CCNG2 expression. In the present study, activation of FXR by GW4064 increased CCNG2 expression via suppression of miR‑135A1 expression, and the FXR/miR‑135A1/CCNG2 axis was demonstrated to be involved in mediating cell proliferation. In conclusion, activation of FXR by GW4064 suppresses cell proliferation and causes cell cycle arrest in CRC, and the miR‑135A1/CCNG2 pathway was suggested to be involved in this step.
To explore the role of the abnormal expression of the bile salt export pump (BSEP) and multidrug resistance protein 2 (MRP2) in isoniazid (INH)-induced liver injury, we assessed the liver injury induced by INH in rats and HepG2 cells in vitro. The regulatory pathways via Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) and farnesoid X receptor (FXR) were also determined. Rat liver injury was assessed by histopathological and biochemical analysis and HepG2 cytotoxicity was assessed by a 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) test. The levels of protein were determined by Western blot. The results indicated that INH could induce hepatotoxicity in vivo and in vitro in a dose dependent manner. The liver index and serum biochemical analysis, especially the levels of total bile acids (TBA), total bilirubin (TBIL), and direct bilirubin (DBIL), were significantly increased in rats. The INH hepatotoxicity was severe in the high dose group, and occurred alongside the down-regulation of BSEP and MRP2 in vivo and in vitro, leading to the accumulation of toxic substrates in the hepatocytes. The SIRT1/FXR pathway was identified as being important for the down-regulation of transporters. In summary, our study indicated that the down-regulation of BSEP and MRP2 represents one mechanism of INH-induced liver injury and the down-regulation of SIRT1/FXR may be a key regulator. This will inform the development of novel therapies and enable the prevention of INH-induced liver injury.
Cholestasis is a common feature of liver injury, which manifests as bile acid excretion and/or enterohepatic circulation disorders. However, very few effective therapies exist for cholestasis. Recently, 18β-Glycyrrhetinic acid (18b-GA), a major metabolic component of glycyrrhizin, which is the main ingredient of licorice, was reported to protect against alpha-naphthylisothiocyanate (ANIT)-induced cholestasis. However, its protective mechanism remains unclear. We hypothesized that 18b-GA may stimulate the signaling pathway of bile acid (BA) transportation in hepatocytes, resulting its hepatoprotective effect. According to the results, 18b-GA markedly attenuated ANIT-induced liver injury as indicated the hepatic plasma chemistry index and histopathology examination. In addition, the expression levels of nuclear factors, including Sirt1, FXR and Nrf2, and their target efflux transporters in the liver, which mainly mediate bile acid homeostasis in hepatocytes, significantly increased. Furthermore, we first revealed that 18b-GA treatment significantly activated FXR, and which can be significantly reduced by EX-527 (a potent and selective Sirt1 inhibitor), indicating that 18b-GA activates FXR through Sirt1. Taken together, 18b-GA confers hepatoprotection against ANIT-induced cholestasis by activating FXR through Sirt1, which promotes gene expression of the efflux transporter, and consequently attenuates dysregulation of bile acid homeostasis in hepatocyte compartments.
Liver homeostasis requires the presence of both parenchymal and non-parenchymal cells (NPCs). However, systems biology studies of the liver have primarily focused on hepatocytes. Using an organotypic three-dimensional (3D) hepatic culture, we report the first transcriptomic study of liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) and Kupffer cells (KCs) cultured with hepatocytes. Through computational pathway and interaction network analyses, we demonstrate that hepatocytes, LSECs and KCs have distinct expression profiles and functional characteristics. Our results show that LSECs in the presence of KCs exhibit decreased expression of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) signaling, a pathway linked to LSEC dedifferentiation. We report the novel result that peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARα) is transcribed in LSECs. The expression of downstream processes corroborates active PPARα signaling in LSECs. We uncover transcriptional evidence in LSECs for a feedback mechanism between PPARα and farnesoid X-activated receptor (FXR) that maintains bile acid homeostasis; previously, this feedback was known occur only in HepG2 cells. We demonstrate that KCs in 3D liver models display expression patterns consistent with an anti-inflammatory phenotype when compared to monocultures. These results highlight the distinct roles of LSECs and KCs in maintaining liver function and emphasize the need for additional mechanistic studies of NPCs in addition to hepatocytes in liver-mimetic microenvironments.
With 49 members identified thus far, the superfamily of nuclear receptors offers a large number of targets to be pharmacologically exploited. Some nuclear receptors already look back to a successful history as drug targets, while others still lack any identified ligand. The development of small molecules targeting nuclear receptor is a challenging task and has to consider not only high affinity binding but also aspects as the nuclear localization of the target protein or transactivation efficacy. In this chapter, we summarize characteristics of nuclear receptors as target family, strategies of hit and lead identification, and the variety of methods for in vitro characterization of nuclear receptor modulators. A detailed method chapter describes an example optimization of a nuclear receptor modulator as well as hybrid reporter gene assays as a very flexible method of choice for in vitro characterization. Thereby, the chapter provides an introduction to nuclear receptor ligand development.
Activation of the nuclear farnesoid X receptor (FXR) which acts as cellular bile acid sensor has been validated as therapeutic strategy to counter liver disorders such as non-alcoholic steatohepatitis by the clinical efficacy of obeticholic acid. FXR antagonism, in contrast, is less well studied and potent small molecule FXR antagonists are rare. Here we report the systematic optimization of a novel class of FXR antagonists towards low nanomolar potency. The most optimized compound antagonizes baseline and agonist induced FXR activity in a full length FXR reporter gene assay and represses intrinsic expression of FXR regulated genes in hepatoma cells. With this activity and a favorable toxicity-, stability- and selectivity-profile it appears suitable to further study FXR antagonism in vitro and in vivo.
Farnesoid X receptor (FXR), a metabolic nuclear receptor, plays critical roles in the maintenance of systemic energy homeostasis and the integrity of many organs, including liver and intestine. It regulates bile acid, lipid, and glucose metabolism, and contributes to inter-organ communication, in particular the enterohepatic signaling pathway, through bile acids and fibroblast growth factor-15/19 (FGF-15/19). The metabolic effects of FXR are also involved in gut microbiota. In addition, FXR has various functions in the kidney, adipose tissue, pancreas, cardiovascular system, and tumorigenesis. Consequently, the deregulation of FXR may lead to abnormalities of specific organs and metabolic dysfunction, allowing the protein as an attractive therapeutic target for the management of liver and/or metabolic diseases. Indeed, many FXR agonists have been being developed and are under pre-clinical and clinical investigations. Although obeticholic acid (OCA) is one of the promising candidates, significant safety issues have remained. The effects of FXR modulation might be multifaceted according to tissue specificity, disease type, and/or energy status, suggesting the careful use of FXR agonists. This review summarizes the current knowledge of systemic FXR biology in various organs and the gut⁻liver axis, particularly regarding the recent advancement in these fields, and also provides pharmacological aspects of FXR modulation for rational therapeutic strategies and novel drug development.
Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) is a complicated condition, with difficult diagnosis and poor prognosis. The expression and clinical significance of the farnesoid X receptor (FXR), an endogenous receptor of bile acids, in ICC is not well understood.
Western blotting and immunochemical analyses were used to determine the levels of FXR in 4 cholangiocarcinoma cell lines, a human intrahepatic biliary epithelial cell line (HIBEpic) and 322 ICC specimens, respectively, while quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction was used to detect the mRNA levels of FXR in cholangiocarcinoma cell lines. We evaluated the prognostic value of FXR expression and its association with clinical parameters. We determined the biological significance of FXR in ICC cell lines by agonist-mediated activation and lentivirus-mediated silence. IL-6 expression was tested by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and flow cytometry. In vitro, cell proliferation was examined by Cell Counting Kit-8, migration and invasion were examined by wound healing and transwell assays; in vivo, tumor migration and invasion were explored in NOD-SCID mice.
FXR was downregulated in ICC cell lines and clinical ICC specimens. Loss of FXR was markedly correlated with aggressive tumor phenotypes and poor prognosis in patients with ICC. Moreover, FXR expression also had significant prognostic value in carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA19-9) negative patients. The expression of FXR was negatively correlated with IL-6 levels in clinical ICC tissues. FXR inhibited the proliferation, migration, invasion and epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) of ICC cells via suppression of IL-6 in vitro. Obeticholic acid, an agonist of FXR, inhibited IL-6 production, tumor growth and lung metastasis of ICC in vivo.
FXR could be a promising ICC prognostic biomarker, especially in CA19-9 negative patients with ICC. FXR inhibits the tumor growth and metastasis of ICC via IL-6 suppression.
Most of reported steroidal FXR antagonists are restricted due to low potency. We described the design and synthesis of novel nonsteroidal scaffold SIPI-7623 derivatives as FXR antagonists. The most potent compound A-11 (IC50 = 7.8 ± 1.1 μM) showed better activity compared to SIPI-7623 (IC50 = 40.8 ± 1.7 μM) and guggulsterone (IC50 = 45.9 ± 1.1 μM). Docking of A-11 in FXR's ligand-binding domain was also studied.
Farnesoid-X-Receptor (FXR) plays a central role in maintaining bile acid (BA) homeostasis by transcriptional control of numerous enterohepatic genes, including intestinal FGF19, a hormone that strongly represses hepatic BA synthesis. How activation of the FGF19 receptor at the membrane is transmitted to the nucleus for transcriptional regulation of BA levels and whether FGF19 signaling posttranslationally modulates FXR function remain largely unknown. Here we show that FXR is phosphorylated at Y67 by non-receptor tyrosine kinase, Src, in response to postprandial FGF19, which is critical for its nuclear localization and transcriptional regulation of BA levels. Liver-specific expression of phospho-defective Y67F-FXR or Src downregulation in mice results in impaired homeostatic responses to acute BA feeding, and exacerbates cholestatic pathologies upon drug-induced hepatobiliary insults. Also, the hepatic FGF19-Src-FXR pathway is defective in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) patients. This study identifies Src-mediated FXR phosphorylation as a potential therapeutic target and biomarker for BA-related enterohepatic diseases.
Farnesoid X receptor (FXR) is a receptor for bile acids and plays an important role in the regulation of bile acid metabolism in the liver. Although FXR has been shown to affect hepatocarcinogenesis through both direct and indirect mechanisms, potential roles of FXR in epithelial⁻mesenchymal transition (EMT) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remain unclear. We examined the effect of several FXR ligands on EMT-related morphological changes in HCC cell lines, such as HuH-7 and Hep3B cells. FXR agonists (chenodeoxycholic acid, GW4064, and obeticholic acid)&amp;mdash;but not an antagonist (guggulsterone)&amp;mdash;induced actin polymerization and expression of N-cadherin and phosphorylated focal adhesion kinase, although they were less effective than transforming growth factor &amp;beta; (TGF-&amp;beta;). FXR agonist treatment enhanced TGF-&amp;beta;-induced EMT morphologic changes and FXR antagonist inhibited the effect of TGF-&amp;beta;. Thus, FXR activation enhances EMT in HCC and FXR antagonists may be EMT-suppressing drug candidates.
Type II diabetes is a complex, chronic, and progressive disease. Glucagon-like peptide-1 (7-6) amide (GLP-1) is a gut hormone released from the L cells which stimulates insulin secretion, and promotes insulin gene expression and β-cell growth and differentiation. Elevated levels of hormone secreted by L cells are an important reason for diabetes improvement. GLP-1 secretion has been reported to be regulated by farnesoid X receptor (FXR), a transcriptional sensor for bile acids which also acts on glucose metabolism. Herein, we attempted to evaluate the effect of FXR on GLP-1 secretion in mouse enteroendocrine L cell lines, STC-1 and GLUTag, and to investigate the underlying mechanism.
ELISA and Western blot assays were employed to examine the levels of GLP-1 and FXR, and the effect of FXR on GLP-1 secretion; online database, including BioGRID and KEGG were used to identify the potential interactions between FXR and proteins and involved pathways; GST pull-down and Co-Immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) assays were performed to validate FXR-CREB interaction; Luciferase reporter gene assays were used for CREB transcriptional activity determination.
FXR inversely regulated GLP-1 secretion in the mouse enteroendocrine L cell lines, GLUTag and STC-1. A total of 24 nonredundant human proteins were shown to be related to FXR by BioGRID; KEGG pathway analysis showed that FXR was related to glucagon signaling pathway, particularly with the transcriptional activators CREB, PGC1α, Sirt1 and CBP. CREB could positively regulate GLP-1 secretion in GLUTag and STC-1 cells. FXR combined with CREB to inhibit its transcriptional activity, thus inhibiting proprotein convertase subtilisin/ kexin type 1 (PCSK1) protein level and GLP-1 secretion.
In the present study, we demonstrated a negative regulation of GLP-1 secretion by FXR in L cell lines, GLUTag and STC-1; FXR exerts its function in L cells through interacting with CREB, a crucial transcriptional regulator of cAMP-CREB signaling pathway, to inhibit its transcriptional activity. Targeting FXR to rescue GLP-1 secretion may be a promising strategy for type II diabetes.
The liver is the main site of estrogen metabolism, and liver disease is usually associated with an abnormal estrogen status. However, little is known about the mechanism underlying this connection. Here, we investigated the effects of bile acid (BA)-activated farnesoid X receptor (FXR) on the metabolism of 17β-estradiol (E2) during blockage of bile flow (cholestasis). Correlations between BA levels and E2 concentrations were established in patients with cholestasis, and hepatic expression profiles of key genes involved in estrogen metabolism were investigated in both WT and FXR-/- mice. We found that the elevated E2 level positively correlated with BA concentrations in the patients with cholestasis. We further observed that bile duct ligation (BDL) increases E2 levels in mouse serum, and this elevation effect was alleviated by deleting the FXR gene. Of note, FXR down-regulated the expression of hepatic sulfotransferase SULT1E1, the primary enzyme responsible for metabolic estrogen inactivation. At the molecular level, we found that FXR competes with the protein acetylase CREB-binding protein (CBP) for binding to the transcription factor hepatocyte nuclear factor 4α (HNF4α). This competition decreased HNF4α acetylation and nuclear retention, which, in turn, repressed HNF4α-dependent SULT1E1 gene transcription. These findings suggest that cholestasis induces BA-activated FXR activity, leading to downstream inhibition of SULT1E1 and hence impeding hepatic degradation of estrogen.
Bile acid (BA) synthesis is regulated through suppression of hepatic cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase via farnesoid X receptor (FXR) activation in hepatocytes and/or enterocytes; in enterocytes, this process requires FGF19 signaling. To study these pathways, we quantified markers of BA synthesis (7α-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one [C4]) and cholesterol production (lathosterol), fibroblast growth factor (FGF)19, and BAs in serum from healthy male volunteers given 1 oral dose of the nonsteroidal FXR agonist Px-102 (0.15 mg/kg, 0.3 mg/kg, 0.6 mg/kg, 1.12 mg/kg, 2.25 mg/kg, 3.38 mg/kg, or 4.5 mg/kg). After 8 hours, serum levels of C4 decreased by 80% in volunteers given 0.15 mg/kg, whereas serum levels of FGF19 were unchanged. Serum levels of FGF19 increased significantly, in a dose-dependent manner, in volunteers given &gt;0.3 mg/kg Px-102, up to as much as 1600%, whereas C4 levels remained significantly reduced (by &gt;80%). For all doses, FGF19 levels returned to normal 24 hours after administration of Px-102. Serum levels of C4 decreased before levels of FGF19 levels increased, and were still reduced by 95% 24 hours after the highest dose (4.5 mg/kg) of Px-102, even though levels of FGF19 had returned to baseline. Our findings indicate that activation of hepatic FXR is able to suppress BA synthesis, independent of FGF19.
Glucagon, an essential regulator of glucose and lipid metabolism, also promotes weight loss, in part through potentiation of fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) secretion. However, FGF21 is only a partial mediator of metabolic actions ensuing from glucagon receptor (GCGR) activation, prompting us to search for additional pathways. Intriguingly, chronic GCGR agonism increases plasma bile acid levels. We hypothesized that GCGR agonism regulates energy metabolism, at least in part, through farnesoid X receptor (FXR). To test this hypothesis, we studied whole-body and liver-specific FXR-knockout (Fxr∆liver) mice. Chronic GCGR agonist (IUB288) administration in diet-induced obese (DIO) Gcgr, Fgf21, and Fxr whole-body or liver-specific knockout (∆liver) mice failed to reduce body weight when compared with wild-type (WT) mice. IUB288 increased energy expenditure and respiration in DIO WT mice, but not Fxr∆liver mice. GCGR agonism increased [14C]palmitate oxidation in hepatocytes isolated from WT mice in a dose-dependent manner, an effect blunted in hepatocytes from Fxr∆liver mice. Our data clearly demonstrate that control of whole-body energy expenditure by GCGR agonism requires intact FXR signaling in the liver. This heretofore-unappreciated aspect of glucagon biology has implications for the use of GCGR agonism in the therapy of metabolic disorders.
The farnesoid X receptor alpha (FXR) is a bile acid sensor activated by binding to endogenous bile acids including chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA). Although, FXR is expressed in male reproductive tissue, the relevance of the receptor on reproduction is scarcely known. Here, we demonstrated the FXR presence and its action on several human sperm features. Western blot and immunofluorescence assays evidenced the FXR expression in human spermatozoa and the localisation in the middle piece. CDCA increasing concentrations and GW4064, synthetic ligand of FXR, were used to study the FXR influence on sperm motility, survival, capacitation, acrosome reaction and on glucose as well as lipid metabolism. Interestingly, our data showed that increasing concentrations of CDCA negatively affected sperm parameters, while the receptor blockage by (Z)-Guggulsterone and by the anti-FXR Ab reversed the effects. Intriguingly, elevated CDCA levels increased triglyceride content, while lipase and G6PDH activities were reduced with respect to untreated samples, thus impeding the metabolic reprogramming typical of the capacitated sperm. In conclusion, in this study, we demonstrated for the first time a novel target for FXR and that the activated receptor alters the acquisition of sperm fertilising ability. We showed that sperm itself express the FXR and it is responsive to specific ligands of the receptor; therefore, bile acids influence this cell both in male and in female genital tracts. It might be hypothesized that bile acid levels could be involved in infertility with idiopathic origin as these compounds are not systematically measured in men undergoing medically assisted procreation.
Nuclear receptors, such as the farnesoid X receptor (FXR) and the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors gamma and alpha (PPAR-&amp;gamma;, -&amp;alpha;), are major metabolic regulators in adipose tissue and the liver, where they govern lipid, glucose, and bile acid homeostasis, as well as inflammatory cascades. Glycerol and free fatty acids are the end products of lipid droplet catabolism driven by PPARs. Aquaporins (AQPs), a family of 13 small transmembrane proteins, facilitate the shuttling of water, urea, and/or glycerol. The peculiar role of AQPs in glycerol transport makes them pivotal targets in lipid metabolism, especially considering their tissue-specific regulation by the nuclear receptors PPAR&amp;gamma; and PPAR&amp;alpha;. Here, we review the role of nuclear receptors in the regulation of glycerol shuttling in liver and adipose tissue through the function and expression of AQPs.
Functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs), such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and chronic constipation (CC), are commonly diagnosed conditions in clinical practice which create a substantial global burden. Since the farnesoid X receptor (FXR) and bile acids (BAs) are responsible for maintaining homeostasis in the GI tract, any disturbances in the expression of FXR or the composition of BAs may contribute to the development of the GI symptoms. Alterations in the mechanism of action of FXR directly affect the BAs pool and account for increased intestinal permeability and changes in abundance and diversity of gut microbiota leading to intestinal dysmotility. Current review focuses on the correlation between the FXR, BAs and the composition of gut microbiota and its influence on the occurrence of GI symptoms in FGIDs.
At high doses, glucocorticoids (GC) have been associated with enhanced serum bile acids and liver injury. We have evaluated the effect of GC, in the absence of hepatotoxicity, on FXR/FGF91(Fgf15)/FGF21-mediated ileum-liver crosstalk. Rats and mice (wild type and Fxr-/-, Fgf15-/- and int-Gr-/- strains; the latter with GC receptor (Gr) knockout selective for intestinal epithelial cells), were treated (i.p.) with dexamethasone, prednisolone or budesonide. In both species, high doses of GC caused hepatotoxicity. At a non-hepatotoxic dose, GC induced ileal Fgf15 down-regulation and liver Fgf21 up-regulation, without affecting Fxr expression. Fgf21 mRNA levels correlated with those of several genes involved in glucose and bile acid metabolism. Surprisingly, liver Cyp7a1 was not up-regulated. The expression of factors involved in transcriptional modulation by Fxr and Gr (p300, Drip205, CBP and Smrt) was not affected. Pxr target genes Cyp3a11 and Mrp2 were not up-regulated in liver or intestine. In contrast, the expression of some Pparα target genes in liver (Fgf21, Cyp4a14 and Vanin-1) and intestine (Vanin-1 and Cyp3a11) was altered. In mice with experimental colitis, liver Fgf21 was up-regulated (4.4-fold). HepG2 cells transfection with FGF21 inhibited CYP7A1 promoter (prCYP7A1-Luc2). This was mimicked by pure human FGF21 protein or culture in medium previously conditioned by cells over-expressing FGF21. This response was not abolished by deletion of a putative response element for phosphorylated FGF21 effectors present in prCYP7A1. In conclusion, GC interfere with FXR/FGF19-mediated intestinal control of CYP7A1 expression by the liver and stimulate hepatic secretion of FGF21, which inhibits CYP7A1 promoter through an autocrine mechanism.
Bile acid diarrhea results from excessive amounts of bile acids entering the colon due to hepatic overexcretion of bile acids or bile acid malabsorption in the terminal ileum. The main therapies include bile acid sequestrants, such as colestyramine and colesevelam, which may be given in combination with the opioid receptor agonist loperamide. Some patients are refractory to conventional treatments. We report the use of the farnesoid X receptor agonist obeticholic acid in a patient with refractory bile acid diarrhea and subsequent intestinal failure. A 32-year-old woman with quiescent colonic Crohn's disease and a normal terminal ileum had been diagnosed with severe bile acid malabsorption and complained of watery diarrhea and fatigue. The diarrhea resulted in hypokalemia and sodium depletion that made her dependent on twice weekly intravenous fluid and electrolyte infusions. Conventional therapies with colestyramine, colesevelam, and loperamide had no effect. Second-line antisecretory therapies with pantoprazole, liraglutide, and octreotide also failed. Third-line treatment with obeticholic acid reduced the number of stools from an average of 13 to an average of 7 per 24 h and improved the patient's quality of life. The fluid and electrolyte balances normalized. The effect was sustained during follow-up for 6 mo with treatment at a daily dosage of 25 mg. The diarrhea worsened shortly after cessation of obeticholic acid. This case report supports the initial report that obeticholic acid may reduce bile acid production and improve symptoms in patients with bile acid diarrhea.
Intensive study on the chemical components of a Korean marine sponge, Spongia sp., has led to the isolation of four new scalarane sesterterpenes, scalalactams A⁻D (1⁻4). Their chemical structures were elucidated from the analysis of spectroscopic data including 1D-and 2D-NMR as well as MS data. Scalalactams A⁻D (1⁻4) possess a scalarane carbon skeleton with a rare structural feature of a γ-lactam moiety within the molecules. Scalalactams A and B (1 and 2) have an extended isopropanyl chain at the lactam ring, and scalalactams C and D (3 and 4) possess a phenethyl group at the lactam ring moiety. Scalalactams A⁻D (1⁻4) did not show FXR antagonistic activity nor cytotoxicity up to 100 μM.
Sodium taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide (NTCP) is a functional receptor for hepatitis B virus (HBV) entry. However, little is known regarding whether NTCP is involved in regulating the postentry steps of the HBV life cycle. Here, we found that NTCP expression upregulated HBV transcription at the postentry step and that the NTCP-targeting entry inhibitor Myrcludex B (MyrB) effectively suppressed HBV transcription both in an HBV in vitro infection system and in mice hydrodynamically injected with an HBV expression plasmid. Mechanistically, NTCP upregulated HBV transcription via farnesoid X receptor α (FxRα)-mediated activation of the HBV EN2/core promoter at the postentry step in a manner that was dependent on the bile acid (BA)-transport function of NTCP, which was blocked by MyrB. Our findings uncover a novel role for NTCP in the HBV life cycle and provide a reference for the use of novel NTCP-targeting entry inhibitors to suppress HBV infection and replication.
Ficus is an important commercial crop not only for its nutritive value but also, for its medicinal value. Several Ficus species have been traditionally used in the Egypt, Indian and Chinese as carminative, astringent, antibacterial, hepatoprotective, and hypolipidemic agents.
To standardize and compare the possible hepatoprotective potential of the ethanolic extract of leaves of five tested Ficus species namely: Ficus mysorensis Roth ex Roem. &amp; Schult, Ficus pyriformis Hook. &amp; Arn., Ficus auriculata Lour., Ficus trigonata L., and Ficus spragueana Mildbr. &amp; Burret in the intrahepatic cholestasis rat model induced by 17α-Ethinylestradiol (EE) and to explore the mechanism of action with respect to their phytochemical constituents.
Determination of the total phenolic and flavonoid contents, chromatographic examination and acute oral toxicity test were performed on the tested Ficus extracts. Animals were divided into 8 groups. Group 1, served as control for 2 weeks. Group 2, untreated cholestatic rats. Groups 3-8, pretreated with Ficus extracts (100 mg/Kg/day, p.o) or ursodeoxycholic acid (as reference drug) for 2 weeks and injected by EE in the last 5 days. Serum liver function test, 5'-nucleotidase (5'-N), total bile acids (TBA), total cholesterol (T.C) and phospholipids were assayed. Also, hepatic Na+/K+-ATPase, nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), hemeoxygenase-1 (HO-1), and markers of oxidative stress were investigated. Furthermore, molecular docking study was performed to explore the ability of the major constituents of Ficus to interact with Farnesoid X receptor (FXR).
Four phenolic compounds (gallic, chlorogenic acid, caffeic acids and rutin) were identified. Chlorogenic acid and rutin represented the major constituents of Ficus extracts. Simultaneous administration of Ficus extracts with EE effectively: i- preserved liver function, TBA, T.C and phospholipids, ii- suppressed the pro-inflammatory cytokines (NF-κB and TNF-α), iii- enhanced hepatic regeneration (HGF) and antioxidant defense system. Furthermore, molecular docking reveals that rutin and chlorogenic acid effectively act as FXR agonists.
Among the tested extracts, Ficus spragueana Mildbr. &amp; Burret enriched with phenolics exhibited a pronounced hepatoprotective activity and may provide a new therapeutic approach for estrogen-induced cholestasis.
Bile diversion to the ileum (GB-IL) has strikingly similar metabolic and satiating effects to Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) in rodent obesity models. The metabolic benefits of these procedures are thought to be mediated by increased bile acids, although parallel changes in body weight and other confounding variables limit this interpretation.
Global G protein-coupled bile acid receptor-1 null (Tgr5-/-) and intestinal-specific farnesoid X receptor null (FxrΔ/E) mice on high-fat diet as well as wild-type C57BL/6 and glucagon-like polypeptide 1 receptor deficient (Glp-1r-/-) mice on chow diet were characterized following GB-IL.
GB-IL induced weight loss and improved oral glucose tolerance in Tgr5-/-, but not FxrΔ/E mice fed a high-fat diet, suggesting a role for intestinal Fxr. GB-IL in wild-type, chow-fed mice prompted weight-independent improvements in glycemia and glucose tolerance secondary to augmented insulin responsiveness. Improvements were concomitant with increased levels of lymphatic GLP-1 in the fasted state and increased levels of intestinal Akkermansia muciniphila. Improvements in fasting glycemia after GB-IL were mitigated with exendin-9, a GLP-1 receptor antagonist, or cholestyramine, a bile acid sequestrant. The glucoregulatory effects of GB-IL were lost in whole-body Glp-1r-/- mice.
Bile diversion to the ileum improves glucose homeostasis via an intestinal Fxr-Glp-1 axis. Altered intestinal bile acid availability, independent of weight loss, and intestinal Akkermansia muciniphila appear to mediate the metabolic changes observed after bariatric surgery and might be manipulated for treatment of obesity and diabetes.
Cholestasis is defined as a reduction of bile secretion caused by a dysfunction of bile formation. Insufficient bile secretion into the intestine undermines the formation of micelles, which may result in the reduced absorption of lipids and fat-soluble vitamins. Here, we investigated the retinol homeostasis and the alterations of retinol metabolism-related genes, including β-carotene 15,15' monooxygenase (BCMO), lecithin:retinol acyltransferase (LRAT), aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH), cytochrome P450 26A1 (CYP26A1), and retinoic acid receptors (RAR) β, in a α-naphthyl isothiocyanate (ANIT)-induced cholestasis rat model. Moreover, we examined the expression of the farnesoid X receptor (FXR) target genes. Our results showed that plasma retinol levels were decreased in ANIT rats compared to control rats. On the contrary, hepatic retinol levels were not different between the two groups. The expression of FXR target genes in the liver and intestine of cholestasis model rats was repressed. The BCMO expression was decreased in the liver and increased in the intestine of ANIT rats compared to control rats. Finally, the hepatic expression of LRAT, RARβ, and ALDH1A1 in cholestatic rats was decreased compared to the control rats, while the CYP26A1 expression of the liver was not altered. The increased expression of intestinal BCMO in cholestasis model rats might compensate for decreased circulatory retinol levels. The BCMO expression might be regulated in a tissue-specific manner to maintain the homeostasis of retinol.
Hepatocyte is particularly vulnerable to apoptosis, a hallmark of many liver diseases. Although pro-apoptotic mechanisms have been extensively explored, less is known about the hepatocyte-specific anti-apoptotic molecular events and it lacks effective approach to combat hepatocyte apoptosis. We investigated the anti-apoptotic effect and mechanism of farnesoid X receptor (FXR), and strategies of how to target FXR for inhibiting apoptosis implicated in liver fibrosis.
Sensitivity to apoptosis was compared between wild type and Fxr-/- mice and in cultured cells. Cell-based and cell-free assays were employed to identify the binding protein of FXR and to uncover the mechanism of its anti-apoptotic effect. Overexpression of FXR by adenovirus-FXR was employed to determine its anti-fibrotic effect in CCl4-treated mice. Specimens from fibrotic patients were collected to validate the relevance of FXR on apoptosis/fibrosis.
FXR deficiency sensitizes hepatocytes to death receptors (DRs)-engaged apoptosis. FXR overexpression, but not FXR ligands, inhibits apoptosis both in vitro and in vivo. Apoptotic stimuli lead to drastic reduction of FXR protein levels, a prerequisite for DRs-engaged apoptosis. Mechanistically, FXR interacts with caspase 8 (CASP8) in the cytoplasm, thus preventing the formation of death-inducing signaling complex (DISC) and activation of CASP8. Adenovirus-FXR transfection impedes liver fibrosis in CCl4-treated mice. Specimens from fibrotic patients are characterized with reduced FXR expression and compromised FXR/CASP8 colocalization.
FXR represents an intrinsic apoptosis inhibitor in hepatocytes and can be targeted via restoring its expression or strengthening FXR/CASP8 interaction for inhibiting hepatocytes apoptosis in liver fibrosis. FUND: National Natural Science Foundation of China.
The repression of renal Farnesoid X Receptor (FXR) had been shown to result from lack of bile acid production from cirrhotic liver. We hypothesized that silymarin and rosuvastatin (Rvs) could have a hepatorenal therapeutic effects in hepatic nephropathy through induction of FXR.
Forty two male Wistar rats were used; naïve (n = 12); six of them were sacrificed after 4 weeks and six continued till the end of the experiment. Thirty rats were treated as follows: Rvs, silymarin, thioacetamide (TAA), TAA + Rvs and TAA + silymarin. Liver and kidney function tests as well as the renal and hepatic expression of transforming growth factor β1 (TGFβ1), FXR, dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase-1 (DDAH-1) and eNOS were performed. Histological and immuno-histochemical studies of liver and kidney were also done.
TAA-inducted liver cirrhosis was associated with significant deterioration of liver and renal functions together with increasing expression of hepatic and renal TGFβ1 and decreasing expression of hepatic and renal FXR, DDAH-1 and eNOS. Giving silymarin or Rvs induced hepatic and renal improvement which was evidenced biochemically and histologically. Significant positive correlation was detected between all the investigated biomarkers except for the correlation between FXR and TGFβ1 which was negative.
In conclusion, liver cirrhosis is associated with deterioration of renal functions. Silymarin and Rvs have a potential hepatorenal therapeutic benefit through simultaneous enhancement of FXR/DDAH-1/eNOS pathway in both organs.
Diabetes is a widespread, rapidly increasing metabolic disease that is driven by hyperglycemia. Early glycemic control is of primary importance to avoid vascular complications including development of retinal disorders leading to blindness, end-stage renal disease, and accelerated atherosclerosis with a higher risk of myocardial infarction, stroke and limb amputations. Even after hyperglycemia has been brought under control, "metabolic memory," a cluster of irreversible metabolic changes that allow diabetes to progress, may persist depending on the duration of hyperglycemia. Manipulation of bile acid (BA) receptors and the BA pool have been shown to be useful in establishing glycemic control in diabetes due to their ability to regulate energy metabolism by binding and activating nuclear transcription factors such as farnesoid X receptor (FXR) in liver and intestine as well as the G-protein coupled receptor, TGR5, in enteroendocrine cells and pancreatic β-cells. The downstream targets of BA activated FXR, FGF15/21, are also important for glucose/insulin homeostasis. In this review we will discuss the effect of BAs on glucose and lipid metabolism and explore recent research on establishing glycemic control in diabetes through the manipulation of BAs and their receptors in the liver, intestine and pancreas, alteration of the enterohepatic circulation, bariatric surgery and alignment of circadian rhythms.
Primary biliary cholangitis is an archetypal autoimmune disease that causes cholestasis, fibrosis, and liver failure. Ursodeoxycholic acid and obeticholic acid are approved for its treatment. Not all patients respond, some are intolerant, many have ongoing symptoms, and new therapies are required. Herein we describe drugs in development and potential future biological targets. We consider compounds acting on the farnesoid X receptor/fibroblast growth factor 19 pathway, fibrates and other agonists of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor family, transmembrane-G-protein-receptor-5 agonists, and several immunological agents. We also consider the roles of bile acid reuptake inhibitors, nalfurafine, and fibrates in pruritus management.
Primary biliary cholangitis is a progressive, autoimmune disease of the interlobular bile ducts, leading to secondary damage of hepatocytes that may progress to cirrhosis and liver failure. Until recently, the only approved treatment was ursodeoxycholic acid. However, 40% of patients do not have an adequate response. Obeticholic acid was approved for treatment as add-on therapy in this group of patients. Off-label use of fibrates has also been reported to be effective. Several new therapies are in development and may further add to the treatment options available to patients with primary biliary cholangitis.
Farnesoid X receptor (FXR), a nuclear receptor mainly expressed in enterohepatic tissues, is a master for bile acid, lipid and glucose homeostasis. Additionally, it acts as a cell protector with unclear mechanism but may be implicated in combating against inflammation, fibrosis and cancers. FXR is thus accepted as a promising target particularly for the enterohepatic diseases, and numerous FXR modulators have been patented and developed.
This review provides an update on the development of FXR modulators for enterohepatic diseases and offers an in-depth perspective on new strategies for the development of novel FXR modulators.
Despite the development of numerous FXR modulators, which culminated in the successful launch of obeticholic acid (OCA), it remains a matter of debate on how the function of FXR should be exploited for therapeutic purposes. The improvement for obesity achieved by either FXR agonists or antagonists is still in confusion. Whether the side effect of pruritus induced by OCA could be exempted for non-steroidal FXR agonists needs further validation. Apart from the development of conventional FXR ligands, emerging evidence support that restoration of FXR protein level may represent a new strategy in targeting FXR for enterohepatic and metabolic diseases.
The prevalence of Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) is increasing globally. Terminalia arjuna W. &amp; Arn. (Combretaceae) is an endemic tree found in India and Sri Lanka and used traditionally for its cardioprotective and hepatoprotective effects. Arjunolic acid (AA) is an oleanane triterpenoid found mainly in the heartwood of T. arjuna. This study was aimed to evaluate the hepatoprotective effect of AA using cellular and rodent models of NAFLD. AA was isolated from the ethyl acetate extract of the heartwood of T. arjuna. The structure of AA was confirmed by physical and spectroscopic data. Steatosis was induced in HepG2 cells using palmitate-oleate mixture and the effects of AA on triglyceride accumulation and lipotoxicity were assessed. In vivo effect of AA on NAFLD was assessed using HFD fed rats. The treatment with AA did not affect the cell viability upto 100 μM and showed GI25 value of 379.9 μM in HepG2 cells. The treatment with AA significantly lowered the ORO concentration by 35.98% and triglyceride accumulation by 66.36% at 50 μM concentration (P &lt; 0.005) compared to the vehicle treated group. The treatment with AA also reduced the leakage of ALT and AST by 61.11 and 48.29% in a significant manner (P &lt; 0.005). The in vivo findings clearly demonstrated that the animals treated with AA at 25 and 50 mg/kg concentrations showed a significant decrease in the levels of transaminases, phosphatase and GGT (P &lt; 0.005). In the liver, the expression of PPARα and FXRα expressions were upregulated, while PPARγ expression was downregulated by the treatment with AA. The liver histology of the animals showed reduction in steatosis and MNC infiltration. These preliminary evidences suggested that AA might be a promising lead to treat NAFLD. Future robust scientific studies on AA will lead to tailoring it for the treatment of NAFLD.
Hepatic steatosis, a reversible state of metabolic dysregulation, can promote the onset of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), and its transition is thought to be critical in disease evolution. The association between endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response and hepatocyte metabolism disorders prompted us to characterize ER stress-induced hepatic metabolic dysfunction in human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived hepatocytes (hiPSC-Hep), to explore regulatory pathways and validate a phenotypic in vitro model for progression of liver steatosis. We treated hiPSC-Hep with a ratio of unsaturated and saturated fatty acids in the presence of an inducer of ER stress to synergistically promote triglyceride accumulation and dysregulate lipid metabolism. We monitored lipid accumulation by high-content imaging and measured gene regulation by RNA sequencing and reverse transcription quantitative PCR analyses. Our results show that ER stress potentiated intracellular lipid accumulation by 5-fold in hiPSC-Hep in the absence of apoptosis. Transcriptome pathway analysis identified ER stress pathways as the most significantly dysregulated of all pathways affected. Obeticholic acid dose dependently inhibited lipid accumulation and modulated gene expression downstream of the farnesoid X receptor. We were able to identify modulation of hepatic markers and gene pathways known to be involved in steatosis and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), in support of a hiPSC-Hep disease model that is relevant to clinical data for human NASH. Our results show that the model can serve as a translational discovery platform for the understanding of molecular pathways involved in NAFLD, and can facilitate the identification of novel therapeutic molecules based on high-throughput screening strategies.
Cholestasis is the major cause of the accumulation of bile acids and results in liver damage, fibrosis, and failure. A growing number of studies have shown that gentiopicroside is a promising prospect that may protect the liver. However, its therapeutic mechanism has not yet been clarified. This study aimed to explore the effect and mechanism of gentiopicroside in cholestasis induced by alpha-naphthylisothiocyanate.
We performed isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification-based quantitative proteomics and metabolomics using liquid chromatography quadruple time-of-fight mass spectrometry and identified the expression of 73 metabolites and 84 proteins associated with cholestasis-related dysfunctions in the metabolism of bile acids, fatty acids, and glycerophospholipids.
Integrated analyses of proteomic and metabonomic studies showed altered pathways in cholestasis-induced liver injury involving increased activity of farnesoid X receptor/retinoid X receptor, bile acid biosynthesis, and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-α/retinoid X receptor-α. Gentiopicroside could reverse these metabolite, protein, and blood biochemical indices, as well as alleviate liver damage. The progressive changes in the proteins and genes may be correlated with cholestasis and were confirmed by western blot and quantitative realtime polymerase chain reaction.
Gentiopicroside could be used to protect the liver in the presence of cholestasis.
Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is a leading cause of liver transplantation, and many trials are underway to evaluate potential therapies. The farnesoid X receptor ligand obeticholic acid in the NASH treatment trial evaluated the effects of obeticholic acid vs placebo on histologic response (defined as decrease in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease activity score [NAS] by ≥2, with no worsening of fibrosis); 45% of patients had a histologic response to obeticholic acid (25 mg), and 21% had a response to placebo (P &lt; .01). We performed a secondary analysis of data from this trial to identify clinical parameters associated with a histologic response.
We used a logistic regression model with a stepwise selection procedure to identify baseline and early on-treatment factors associated with a histologic response at 72 weeks. Baseline demographics, liver histology, medical history, concomitant medications, cardiometabolic parameters, and serum biochemistry, as well as the changes over the course of the trial (at weeks 12 and 24), were evaluated as potential predictors of a histologic response. The model was cross-validated by a jackknife method, and performance was evaluated with the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve.
The logistic regression model found that obeticholic acid treatment, baseline NAS &gt; 5, baseline triglyceride level ≤ 154 mg/dL, baseline international normalized ratio ≤ 1, baseline aspartate aminotransferase level ≤ 49 U/L, and a decrease in alanine aminotransferase level at week 24 by 17 U/L or more, to be significantly associated with histologic response (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, 0.83; 95% confidence interval, 0.77-0.89; P &lt; .0001).
In a secondary analysis of data from a clinical trial of obeticholic acid in patients with NASH, we identified routine clinical and laboratory parameters during the first 24 weeks of treatment (such as baseline NAS, triglyceride levels, and a decrease in alanine aminotransferase level) to significantly associate with histologic markers of response.
Farnesoid X receptor (FXR) is a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily of ligand-activated transcription factors. As a metabolic regulator, FXR plays key roles in bile acid and cholesterol metabolism and lipid and glucose homeostasis. Therefore, FXR is a potential drug target for several metabolic syndromes, especially those related to lipidemia disorders. In the present study, we identified small molecule SIPI-7623, a derivative of an extract from Oriental wormwood (Artemisia capillaris), and found that it specifically upregulated the expression of cholesterol-7-alpha-hydroxylase (CYP7A1), downregulated the expression of sterol-regulatory element-binding protein 1c (SREBP-1c) in the liver, and inhibited the expression of ileal bile acid binding-protein (IBABP) in the ileum of rats. We found that inhibition of FXR by SIPI-7623 decreased the level of cholesterol and triglyceride. SIPI-7623 reduced the levels of cholesterol and triglyceride in in vitro HepG2 cell models, ameliorated diet-induced atherosclerosis, and decreased the serum lipid content on rats and rabbits model of atherosclerosis in vivo. Furthermore, SIPI-7623 decreased the extent of atherosclerotic lesions. Our resutls demonstrated that antagonism of the FXR pathway can be employed as a therapeutic strategy to treat metabolic diseases such as hyperlipidemia and atherosclerosis. In conclusion, SIPI-7623 could be a promising lead compound for development of drugs to treat hyperlipidemia and atherosclerosis.
It is increasingly recognized that farnesoid X receptor (FXR) has anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities. The present study investigated the effects of obeticholic acid (OCA), a novel synthetic FXR agonist, on renal inflammation and oxidative stress in a model of sepsis-induced acute kidney injury. All mice except controls were intraperitoneally injected with lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 2.0 mg/kg). In the OCA + LPS group, mice were orally pretreated with three doses of OCA (5 mg/kg) at 48, 24 and 1 h before LPS injection. Interestingly, OCA pretreatment alleviated LPS-induced renal dysfunction and pathological damage. Moreover, OCA pretreatment repressed renal inflammatory cytokines and chemokines during LPS-induced acute kidney injury. In addition, OCA blocked nuclear translocation of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) p65 and p50 subunits in tubular epithelial cells of renal cortex. Additional experiment showed that OCA pretreatment attenuated LPS-induced renal glutathione depletion, lipid peroxidation and protein nitration. Moreover, OCA pretreatment inhibited the upregulation of renal NADPH oxidase and inos genes during LPS-induced acute kidney injury. In conclusion, OCA pretreatment protects against sepsis-induced acute kidney injury through inhibiting renal inflammation and oxidative stress. These results provide evidence for roles of FXR as an important regulator of inflammation and oxidative stress in the kidney.
Cholestasis is characterised by impaired bile secretion and accumulation of bile salts in the organism. Hereditary cholestasis is a heterogeneous group of rare autosomal recessive liver disorders, which are characterised by intrahepatic cholestasis, pruritus, and jaundice and caused by defects in genes related to the secretion and transport of bile salts and lipids. Phenotypic manifestation is highly variable, ranging from progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis (PFIC)-with onset in early infancy and progression to end-stage liver disease-to a milder intermittent mostly nonprogressive form known as benign recurrent intrahepatic cholestasis (BRIC). Cases have been reported of initially benign episodic cholestasis that subsequently transitions to a persistent progressive form of the disease. Therefore, BRIC and PFIC seem to represent two extremes of a continuous spectrum of phenotypes that comprise one disease. Thus far, five representatives of PFIC (named PFIC1-5) caused by pathogenic mutations present in both alleles of ATP8B1, ABCB11, ABCB4, TJP2, and NR1H4 have been described. In addition to familial intrahepatic cholestasis, partial defects in ATP8B1, ABCB11, and ABCB4 predispose patients to drug-induced cholestasis and intrahepatic cholestasis in pregnancy. This review summarises the current knowledge of the clinical manifestations, genetics, and molecular mechanisms of these diseases and briefly outlines the therapeutic options, both conservative and invasive, with an outlook for future personalised therapeutic strategies.
Intestinal bacteria can modify the composition of bile acids and bile acids, which are regulated by the farnesoid X receptor, affect the survival and growth of gut bacteria. We studied the effects of obeticholic acid (OCA), a bile acid analogue and farnesoid X receptor agonist, on the intestinal microbiomes of humans and mice.
We performed a phase I study in 24 healthy volunteers given OCA (5, 10, or 25 mg/d for 17 days). Fecal and plasma specimens were collected at baseline (day 0) and on days 17 (end of dosing) and 37 (end of study). The fecal specimens were analyzed by shotgun meta-genomic sequencing. A Uniref90 high-stringency genomic analysis was used to assign specific genes to the taxonomic signature of bacteria whose abundance was associated with OCA. Male C57BL/6 mice were gavage fed daily with water, vehicle, or OCA (10 mg/kg) for 2 weeks. Small intestine luminal contents were collected by flushing with saline and fecal pellets were collected at baseline and day 14. Mouse samples were analyzed by 16S-tagged sequencing. Culture experiments were performed to determine the taxonomic-specific effects of bile acids and OCA on bacterial growth.
Suppression of endogenous bile acid synthesis by OCA in subjects led to a reversible induction of gram-positive bacteria that are found in the small intestine and are components of the diet and oral microbiota. We found that bile acids decreased proliferation of these bacteria in minimum inhibitory concentration assays. In these organisms, there was an increase in the representation of microbial genomic pathways involved in DNA synthesis and amino acid metabolism with OCA treatment of subjects. Consistent with these findings, mice fed OCA had lower endogenous bile acid levels and an increased proportion of Firmicutes, specifically in the small intestine, compared with mice fed water or vehicle.
In studying the effects of OCA in humans and mice, we found evidence for interactions between bile acids and features of the small intestinal microbiome. These findings indicate that farnesoid X receptor activation alters the intestinal microbiota and could provide opportunities for microbiome biomarker discovery or new approaches to engineering the human microbiome.

Bariatric surgery procedures, such as Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) and vertical sleeve gastrectomy (VSG), are the most effective interventions available for sustained weight loss and improved glucose metabolism. Bariatric surgery alters the enterohepatic bile acid circulation, resulting in increased plasma bile levels as well as altered bile acid composition. While it remains unclear why both VSG and RYGB can alter bile acids, it is possible that these changes are important mediators of the effects of surgery. Moreover, a molecular target of bile acid synthesis, the bile acid-activated transcription factor FXR, is essential for the positive effects of VSG on weight loss and glycemic control. This Perspective examines the relationship and sequence of events between altered bile acid levels and composition, FXR signaling, and gut microbiota after bariatric surgery. We hypothesize that although bile acids and FXR signaling are potent mediators of metabolic function, unidentified downstream targets are the main mediators behind the benefits of weight-loss surgery. One of these targets, the gut-derived peptide FGF15/19, is a potential molecular and therapeutic marker to explain the positive metabolic effects of bariatric surgery. Focusing research efforts on identifying these complex molecular mechanisms will provide new opportunities for therapeutic strategies to treat obesity and metabolic dysfunction.
Autophagy is an evolutionarily conserved catabolic process that recycles nutrients upon starvation and maintains cellular energy homeostasis. Its acute regulation by nutrient-sensing signalling pathways is well described, but its longer-term transcriptional regulation is not. The nuclear receptors peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-α (PPARα) and farnesoid X receptor (FXR) are activated in the fasted and fed liver, respectively. Here we show that both PPARα and FXR regulate hepatic autophagy in mice. Pharmacological activation of PPARα reverses the normal suppression of autophagy in the fed state, inducing autophagic lipid degradation, or lipophagy. This response is lost in PPARα knockout (Ppara(-/-), also known as Nr1c1(-/-)) mice, which are partially defective in the induction of autophagy by fasting. Pharmacological activation of the bile acid receptor FXR strongly suppresses the induction of autophagy in the fasting state, and this response is absent in FXR knockout (Fxr(-/-), also known as Nr1h4(-/-)) mice, which show a partial defect in suppression of hepatic autophagy in the fed state. PPARα and FXR compete for binding to shared sites in autophagic gene promoters, with opposite transcriptional outputs. These results reveal complementary, interlocking mechanisms for regulation of autophagy by nutrient status. 
Farnesoid X receptor (FXR, NR1H4) is a ligand-activated transcription factor, belonging to the nuclear receptor superfamily. FXR is highly expressed in the liver and is essential in regulating bile acid homeostasis. FXR deficiency is implicated in numerous liver diseases and mice with modulation of FXR have been used as animal models to study liver physiology and pathology. We have reported genome-wide binding of FXR in mice by chromatin immunoprecipitation - deep sequencing (ChIP-seq), with results indicating that FXR may be involved in regulating diverse pathways in liver. However, limited information exists for the functions of human FXR and the suitability of using murine models to study human FXR functions.
In the current study, we performed ChIP-seq in primary human hepatocytes (PHHs) treated with a synthetic FXR agonist, GW4064 or DMSO control. In parallel, RNA deep sequencing (RNA-seq) and RNA microarray were performed for GW4064 or control treated PHHs and wild type mouse livers, respectively.
ChIP-seq showed similar profiles of genome-wide FXR binding in humans and mice in terms of motif analysis and pathway prediction. However, RNA-seq and microarray showed more different transcriptome profiles between PHHs and mouse livers upon GW4064 treatment.
In summary, we have established genome-wide human FXR binding and transcriptome profiles. These results will aid in determining the human FXR functions, as well as judging to what level the mouse models could be used to study human FXR functions.
Farnesoid X receptor (FXR, NR1H4) is a bile acid-activated transcription factor that belongs to the nuclear receptor superfamily. It is highly expressed in the enterohepatic system, where it senses bile acid levels to consequently reduce their synthesis while inducing their detoxification. Bile acids are intestinal tumor promoters and their concentrations have to be tightly regulated. Indeed, reduced expression of FXR in the intestine increases colorectal cancer susceptibility in mice, whereas its activation can promote apoptosis in genetically modified cells. Notably, despite the broad knowledge of the FXR enterohepatic transcriptional activity, the molecular mechanisms regulating FXR expression in the intestine are still unknown. Herein, by combining both gain and loss of function approaches and FXR promoter activity studies, we identified caudal-related homeobox 2 (CDX2) transcription factor as a positive regulator of FXR expression in the enterocytes. Our results provide a putative novel tool for modulating FXR expression against bile acid-related colorectal cancer progression. 
Nuclear Receptor subfamily 1, group H, member 4 (NR1H4) is a receptor for bile acids and has an important role in regulating energy metabolism in liver, muscle and adipose tissues in humans and animals. In this study, we cloned the full coding region of NR1H4 gene from porcine Longissimus dorsi by Rapid amplification of cDNA end (RACE). Results indicated that the open reading frame of NR1H4 covered 1461 bp encoding 486 amino acid residues and the deduced amino acid sequence was 91-94 % identical to that of Homo sapiens, Bos taurus, Macaca mulatta, Gorilla gorilla, and Ovis aries. Bioinformatic analysis indicated that NR1H4 contained 31 phosphorylation sites with 14 serine, 6 threonine and 11 tyrosine. One single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) was detected by PCR-RFLP in 3' untranslated region of exon 9 (NR1H4) and the allele frequency analysis showed that A allele frequency was low among 396 pigs from five breeds. The NR1H4 mRNA expression pattern showed that NR1H4 gene was expressed highly in live and Longissimus dorsi. This work provided an important experimental basis for further research on mechanism of lipid metabolism and fat deposition in pigs.
To examine hepatic expression of cholesterol-trafficking proteins, mitochondrial StarD1 and endosomal StarD3, and their relationship with dyslipidaemia and steatosis in Zucker (fa/fa) genetically obese rats, and to explore their functional role in lipid metabolism in rat McArdle RH-7777 hepatoma cells.
Expression of StarD1 and StarD3 in rat liver and hepatoma samples were determined by Q-PCR and/or immunoblotting; lipid mass by colorimetric assays; radiolabelled precursors were utilised to measure lipid synthesis and secretion, and lipidation of exogenous apolipoprotein A-I.
Hepatic expression of StarD3 protein was repressed by genetic obesity in (fa/fa) Zucker rats, compared with lean (Fa/?) controls, suggesting a link with storage or export of lipids from the liver. Overexpression of StarD1 and StarD3, and knockdown of StarD3, in rat hepatoma cells, revealed differential effects on lipid metabolism. Overexpression of StarD1 increased utilisation of exogenous (preformed) fatty acids for triacylglycerol synthesis and secretion, but impacted minimally on cholesterol homeostasis. By contrast, overexpression of StarD3 increased lipidation of exogenous apoA-I, and facilitated de novo biosynthetic pathways for neutral lipids, potentiating triacylglycerol accumulation but possibly offering protection against lipotoxicity. Finally, StarD3 overexpression altered expression of genes which impact variously on hepatic insulin resistance, inducing Ppargcla, Cyp2e1, Nr1h4, G6pc and Irs1, and repressing expression of Scl2a1, Igfbp1, Casp3 and Serpine 1.
Targeting StarD3 may increase circulating levels of HDL and protect the liver against lipotoxicity; loss of hepatic expression of this protein, induced by genetic obesity, may contribute to the pathogenesis of dyslipidaemia and steatosis.
Despite the mortality associated with liver disease observed in patients with short bowel syndrome (SBS), mechanisms underlying the development of SBS-associated liver disease (SBS-ALD) are poorly understood. This study examines the impact of bacterially-mediated bile acid (BA) dysmetabolism on farnesoid X receptor (FXR) signalling pathways and clinical outcome in a piglet model of SBS-ALD.
4-week old piglets underwent 75% small bowel resection (SBR) or sham operation. Liver histology and hepatic inflammatory gene expression were examined. Abundance of BA biotransforming bacteria was determined and metabolomic studies detailed the alterations in BA composition of stool, portal serum and bile samples. Gene expression of intestinal and hepatic FXR target genes and small heterodimer partner (SHP) transrepression targets were assessed.
Histological evidence of SBS-ALD included liver bile duct proliferation, hepatocyte ballooning and fibrosis. Inflammatory gene expression was increased. Microbiota changes included a 10-fold decrease in Clostridium and a two-fold decrease in Bacteroides in SBS-ALD piglets. BA composition was altered and reflected a primary BA dominant composition. Intestinal and hepatic regulation of BA synthesis was characterised by a blunted intestinal FXR activation response and a failure of SHP to repress key hepatic targets.
We propose a pathological scenario in which microbial dysbiosis following SBR results in significant BA dysmetabolism and consequent outcomes including steatorrhoea, persistent diarrhoea and liver damage. Furthermore alterations in BA composition may have contributed to the observed disturbance in FXR-mediated signalling pathways. These findings provide an insight into the complex mechanisms mediating the development of liver disease in patients with SBS.
Bariatric surgical procedures, such as vertical sleeve gastrectomy (VSG), are at present the most effective therapy for the treatment of obesity, and are associated with considerable improvements in co-morbidities, including type-2 diabetes mellitus. The underlying molecular mechanisms contributing to these benefits remain largely undetermined, despite offering the potential to reveal new targets for therapeutic intervention. Substantial changes in circulating total bile acids are known to occur after VSG. Moreover, bile acids are known to regulate metabolism by binding to the nuclear receptor FXR (farsenoid-X receptor, also known as NR1H4). We therefore examined the results of VSG surgery applied to mice with diet-induced obesity and targeted genetic disruption of FXR. Here we demonstrate that the therapeutic value of VSG does not result from mechanical restriction imposed by a smaller stomach. Rather, VSG is associated with increased circulating bile acids, and associated changes to gut microbial communities. Moreover, in the absence of FXR, the ability of VSG to reduce body weight and improve glucose tolerance is substantially reduced. These results point to bile acids and FXR signalling as an important molecular underpinning for the beneficial effects of this weight-loss surgery. 
The intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP) is a multifactorial liver disorder which pathogenesis involves the interplay among abnormal bile acid (BA) levels, sex hormones, environmental factors, and genetic susceptibility. The dynamic nature of ICP that usually resolves soon after delivery suggests the possibility that its pathobiology is under epigenetic modulation. We explored the status of white blood peripheral cells-DNA methylation of CpG-enriched sites at the promoter of targeted genes (FXR/NR1H4, PXR/NR1I2, NR1I3, ESR1, and ABCC2) in a sample of 88 ICP patients and 173 healthy pregnant women in the third trimester of their pregnancies. CpG dinucleotides at the gene promoter of nuclear receptors subfamily 1 members and ABCC2 transporter were highly methylated during healthy pregnancy. We observed significant differences at the distal (-1890) and proximal promoter (-358) CpG sites of the FXR/NR1H4 and at the distal PXR/NR1I2 (-1224) promoter, which were consistently less methylated in ICP cases when compared with controls. In addition, we observed that methylation at FXR/NR1H4-1890 and PXR/NR1I2-1224 promoter sites was highly and positively correlated with BA profiling, particularly, conjugated BAs. Conversely, methylation level at the proximal FXR/NR1H4-358 CpG site was significantly and negatively correlated with the primary cholic and secondary deoxycholic acid. In vitro exploration showed that epiallopregnanolone sulfate, a reported FXR inhibitor, regulates the transcriptional activity of FXR/NR1H4 but seems to be not involved in the methylation changes. In conclusion, the identification of epigenetic marks in target genes provides a basis for the understanding of adverse liver-related pregnancy outcomes, including ICP. 
Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP) has a complex etiology with a significant genetic component. Heterozygous mutations of canalicular transporters occur in a subset of ICP cases and a population susceptibility allele (p.444A) has been identified in ABCB11. We sought to expand our knowledge of the detailed genetic contribution to ICP by investigation of common variation around candidate loci with biological plausibility for a role in ICP (ABCB4, ABCB11, ABCC2, ATP8B1, NR1H4, and FGF19).
ICP patients (n=563) of white western European origin and controls (n=642) were analyzed in a case-control design. Single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers (n=83) were selected from the HapMap data set (Tagger, Haploview 4.1 (build 22)). Genotyping was performed by allelic discrimination assay on a robotic platform. Following quality control, SNP data were analyzed by Armitage's trend test.
Cochran-Armitage trend testing identified six SNPs in ABCB11 together with six SNPs in ABCB4 that showed significant evidence of association. The minimum Bonferroni corrected P value for trend testing ABCB11 was 5.81×10(-4) (rs3815676) and for ABCB4 it was 4.6×10(-7)(rs2109505). Conditional analysis of the two clusters of association signals suggested a single signal in ABCB4 but evidence for two independent signals in ABCB11. To confirm these findings, a second study was performed in a further 227 cases, which confirmed and strengthened the original findings.
Our analysis of a large cohort of ICP cases has identified a key role for common variation around the ABCB4 and ABCB11 loci, identified the core associations, and expanded our knowledge of ICP susceptibility.
Farnesoid X receptor (FXR) is a bile acid nuclear receptor described through mouse knockout studies as a tumor suppressor for the development of colon adenocarcinomas. This study investigates the regulation of FXR in the development of human colon cancer. We used immunohistochemistry of FXR in normal tissue (n = 238), polyps (n = 32), and adenocarcinomas, staged I-IV (n = 43, 39, 68, and 9), of the colon; RT-quantitative PCR, reverse-phase protein array, and Western blot analysis in 15 colon cancer cell lines; NR1H4 promoter methylation and mRNA expression in colon cancer samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas; DNA methyltransferase inhibition; methyl-DNA immunoprecipitation (MeDIP); bisulfite sequencing; and V-Ki-ras2 Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (KRAS) knockdown assessment to investigate FXR regulation in colon cancer development. Immunohistochemistry and quantitative RT-PCR revealed that expression and function of FXR was reduced in precancerous lesions and silenced in a majority of stage I-IV tumors. FXR expression negatively correlated with phosphatidylinositol-4, 5-bisphosphate 3 kinase signaling and the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. The NR1H4 promoter is methylated in ~12% colon cancer The Cancer Genome Atlas samples, and methylation patterns segregate with tumor subtypes. Inhibition of DNA methylation and KRAS silencing both increased FXR expression. FXR expression is decreased early in human colon cancer progression, and both DNA methylation and KRAS signaling may be contributing factors to FXR silencing. FXR potentially suppresses epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and other oncogenic signaling cascades, and restoration of FXR activity, by blocking silencing mechanisms or increasing residual FXR activity, represents promising therapeutic options for the treatment of colon cancer.
An understanding of early genetic/epigenetic changes in colorectal cancer would aid in diagnosis and prognosis. To identify these changes in human preneoplastic tissue, we first studied our mouse model in which Mthfr⁺/⁻ BALB/c mice fed folate-deficient diets develop intestinal tumors in contrast to Mthfr⁺/⁺ BALB/c mice fed control diets. Transcriptome profiling was performed in normal intestine from mice with low or high tumor susceptibility. We identified 12 upregulated and 51 downregulated genes in tumor-prone mice. Affected pathways included retinoid acid synthesis, lipid and glucose metabolism, apoptosis and inflammation. We compared murine candidates from this microarray analysis, and murine candidates from an earlier strain-based comparison, with a set of human genes that we had identified in previous methylome profiling of normal human colonic mucosa, from colorectal cancer patients and controls. From the extensive list of human methylome candidates, our approach uncovered five orthologous genes that had shown changes in murine expression profiles (PDK4, SPRR1A, SPRR2A, NR1H4, and PYCARD). The human orthologs were assayed by bisulfite-pyrosequencing for methylation at 14 CpGs. All CpGs exhibited significant methylation differences in normal mucosa between colorectal cancer patients and controls; expression differences for these genes were also observed. PYCARD and NR1H4 methylation differences showed promise as markers for presence of polyps in controls. We conclude that common pathways are disturbed in preneoplastic intestine in our animal model and morphologically normal mucosa of patients with colorectal cancer, and present an initial version of a DNA methylation-based signature for human preneoplastic colon.
Farnesoid X receptor (FXR, Nr1h4) is a ligand-activated transcription factor belonging to the nuclear receptor superfamily. FXR is essential in maintaining bile acid (BA) homeostasis, and FXR(-/-) mice develop cholestasis, inflammation, and spontaneous liver tumors. The signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) is well known to regulate liver growth, and STAT3 is feedback inhibited by its target gene, the suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3). Strong activation of STAT3 was detected in FXR(-/-) mouse livers. However, the mechanism of STAT3 activation with FXR deficiency remains elusive. Wild-type (WT) and FXR(-/-) mice were used to detect STAT3 pathway activation in the liver. In vivo BA feeding or deprivation was used to determine the role of BAs in STAT3 activation, and in vitro molecular approaches were used to determine the direct transcriptional regulation of SOCS3 by FXR. STAT3 was activated in FXR(-/-) but not WT mice. BA feeding increased, but deprivation by cholestyramine reduced, serum inflammatory markers and STAT3 activation. Furthermore, the Socs3 gene was determined as a direct FXR target gene. The elevated BAs and inflammation, along with reduced SOCS3, collectively contribute to the activation of the STAT3 signaling pathway in the liver of FXR(-/-) mice. This study suggests that the constitutive activation of STAT3 may be a mechanism of liver carcinogenesis in FXR(-/-) mice. 
This study aimed to investigate whether genetic polymorphisms of the organic anion transporting polypeptides influence hepatic enhancement in gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI.
We analyzed the genotypes of SLCO1B1 388A&gt;G, SLCO1B1 521T&gt;C, SLCO1B3 334T&gt;G and NR1H4 -1G&gt;T and calculated the mean quantitative liver-spleen contrast ratio, as an index of liver parenchymal enhancement, in 226 patients with liver disease.
Multiple linear regression analysis using the mean quantitative liver-spleen contrast ratio as the dependent variable revealed that not only Child-Pugh score, but also SLCO1B1*1b haplotype (β = 0.12; p = 0.04), were significant predictors of liver parenchymal enhancement. In addition, SLCO1B3 334T&gt;G (β = -0.18; p = 0.03) was a significant predictor when the data were analyzed in a subgroup of 117 patients, excluding the carriers of NR1H4 -1G&gt;T, who reportedly exhibit reduced transcriptional activity of SLCO1B3.
These genetic variants, as well as hepatic function, may contribute to individual differences in hepatic enhancement with gadoxetic acid.
Activation of xenobiotic metabolism pathways has been linked to lifespan extension in different models of aging. However, the mechanisms underlying activation of xenobiotic genes remain largely unknown. Here we showed that although farnesoid X receptor (FXR, Nr1h4) mRNA levels do not change significantly, FXR protein levels are elevated in the livers of the long-lived Little mice, leading to increased DNA binding activity of FXR. Hepatic FXR expression is sex-dependent in wild-type mice but not in Little mice, implying that up-regulation of FXR might be dependent on the reduction of growth hormone in Little mice. Growth hormone treatment decreased hepatic expression of FXR and xenobiotic genes Abcb1a, Fmo3 and Gsta2 in both wild-type and Little mice, suggesting an association between FXR and xenobiotic gene expression. We found that Abcb1a is transactivated by FXR via direct binding of FXR/retinoid X receptor α (RXRα) heterodimer to a response element at the proximal promoter. FXR also positively controls Fmo3 and Gsta2 expression through direct interaction with the response elements in these genes. Our study demonstrates that xenobiotic genes are direct transcriptional targets of FXR and suggests that FXR signaling may play a critical role in the lifespan extension observed in Little mice. 
Nuclear receptor subfamily 1, group H, member 4 (Nr1h4, FXR) is a bile acid activated nuclear receptor mainly expressed in the liver, intestine, kidney and adrenal glands. Upon activation, the primary function is to suppress cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase (Cyp7a1), the rate-limiting enzyme in the classic or neutral bile acid synthesis pathway. In the present study, a novel Fxr deficient mouse line was created and studied with respect to metabolism and liver function in ageing mice fed chow diet. The Fxr deficient mice were similar to wild type mice in terms of body weight, body composition, energy intake and expenditure as well as behaviours at a young age. However, from 15 weeks of age and onwards, the Fxr deficient mice had almost no body weight increase up to 39 weeks of age mainly because of lower body fat mass. The lower body weight gain was associated with increased energy expenditure that was not compensated by increased food intake. Fasting levels of glucose and insulin were lower and glucose tolerance was improved in old and lean Fxr deficient mice. However, the Fxr deficient mice displayed significantly increased liver weight, steatosis, hepatocyte ballooning degeneration and lobular inflammation together with elevated plasma levels of ALT, bilirubin and bile acids, findings compatible with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and cholestasis. In conclusion, ageing Fxr deficient mice display late onset leanness associated with elevated energy expenditure and improved glucose control but develop severe NASH-like liver pathology.
Bile acid signaling via farnesoid X receptor (FXR) regulates glucose and lipid levels, fat mass, and hepatic steatosis in animal models.
To understand the role of FXR in human metabolism, we investigated associations of common single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the FXR-encoding gene NR1H4 with glucose and lipid metabolism, body fat mass, and liver fat content.
We genotyped 2166 healthy German subjects for 7 tagging SNPs within NR1H4 (rs35735, rs1030454, rs11110415, rs11610264, rs17030285, rs4764980, and rs11110390) covering 100% of common genetic variation (minor allele frequency &gt; 10%).
Subjects were metabolically characterized by an oral glucose tolerance test. In subgroups, hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp and liver fat quantification by (1)H-magnetic resonance spectroscopy were performed.
SNP rs4764980 was significantly associated with fasting glycemia (P = .0043) and nominally associated with fasting and postglucose load free fatty acid (FFA) levels (P = .01). Upon interrogation of publicly available Meta-Analyses of Glucose and Insulin-related traits Consortium data, the association of rs4764980 with fasting glycemia was replicated (Meta-Analyses of Glucose and Insulin-related traits Consortium, P = .005). Additionally, SNP rs11110390 showed significant associations with fasting (P = .0054) and postload (P = .0051) FFA levels. For none of the investigated SNPs, associations with insulin secretion or sensitivity, body fat mass, or liver fat content were detected.
We conclude that FXR contributes to fasting glucose and FFA levels in humans independent of unhealthy body fat accumulation. The receptor represents an interesting target to influence lipid and glucose metabolism.
Adenocarcinoma (AC) and squamous cell carcinoma (SqCC) are two major histological subtypes of lung cancer. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have made considerable advances in the understanding of lung cancer susceptibility. Obvious heterogeneity has been observed between different histological subtypes of lung cancer, but genetic determinants in specific to lung SqCC have not been systematically investigated. Here, we performed the GWAS analysis specifically for lung SqCC in 833 SqCC cases and 3,094 controls followed by a two-stage replication in additional 2,223 lung SqCC cases and 6,409 controls from Chinese populations. We found that rs12296850 in SLC17A8-NR1H4 gene region at12q23.1 was significantly associated with risk of lung SqCC at genome-wide significance level [additive model: odds ratio (OR) = 0.78, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.72-0.84, P = 1.19×10(-10)]. Subjects carrying AG or GG genotype had a 26% (OR = 0.74, 95% CI = 0.67-0.81) or 32% (OR = 0.68, 95% CI = 0.56-0.83) decreased risk of lung SqCC, respectively, as compared with AA genotype. However, we did not observe significant association between rs12296850 and risk of lung AC in a total of 4,368 cases with lung AC and 9,486 controls (OR = 0.96, 95% CI = 0.90-1.02, P = 0.173). These results indicate that genetic variations on chromosome 12q23.1 may specifically contribute to lung SqCC susceptibility in Chinese population.
Adverse drug events (ADEs) are a common cause of patient morbidity and mortality and are classically thought to result, in part, from variation in expression and activity of hepatic enzymes of drug metabolism. It is now known that alterations in the expression of genes that encode drug- and bile-acid-transporter proteins in both the gut and liver play a previously unrecognized role in determining patient drug response and eventual clinical outcome. Four nuclear receptor (NR) superfamily members, including pregnane X receptor (PXR, NR1I2), constitutive androstane receptor (NR1I3), farnesoid X receptor (NR1H4), and vitamin D receptor (NR1I1), play pivotal roles in drug- and bile-acid-activated programs of gene expression to coordinately regulate drug- and bile-acid transport activity in the intestine and liver. This review focuses on the NR-mediated gene activation of drug and bile-acid transporters in these tissues as well as the possible underlying molecular mechanisms.
Farnesoid X receptor (FXR, NR1H4) controls bile acid homeostasis. NR1H4 variants may predispose to intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP). We report on NR1H4 analysis in eight patients with progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis (PFIC) and in eight women with either ICP and/or drug-induced cholestasis (DIC) in whom no disease causing mutation in ATP8B1, ABCB11 and/or ABCB4 were found. No NR1H4 mutation was found in PFIC patients. In one woman with ICP/DIC, a NR1H4 heterozygous variant (c.-1G&gt;T) was found. This suggests that a NR1H4 mutation is not or rarely involved in hepatocellular cholestasis of unknown cause.
Parasitic worms express host-like glycans to attenuate the immune response of human hosts. The therapeutic potential of this immunomodulatory mechanism in controlling the metabolic dysfunction that is associated with chronic inflammation remains unexplored. We demonstrate here that administration of lacto-N-fucopentaose III (LNFPIII), a Lewis(X)-containing immunomodulatory glycan found in human milk and on parasitic helminths, improves glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity in diet-induced obese mice. This effect is mediated partly through increased interleukin-10 (Il-10) production by LNFPIII-activated macrophages and dendritic cells, which reduces white adipose tissue inflammation and sensitizes the insulin response of adipocytes. Concurrently, LNFPIII treatment upregulates nuclear receptor subfamily 1, group H, member 4 (Fxr-α, also known as Nr1h4) to suppress lipogenesis in the liver, conferring protection against hepatosteatosis. At the signaling level, the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (Erk)-activator protein 1 (Ap1) pathway seems to mediate the effects of LNFPIII on both inflammatory and metabolic pathways. Our results suggest that LNFPIII may provide new therapeutic approaches to treat metabolic diseases.
Farnesoid X receptor (FXR, NR1H4) is a member of a nuclear receptor superfamily, which plays important roles in bile acid homeostasis, lipoprotein and glucose metabolism, and hepatic regeneration. GW4064 is a potent and selective FXR agonist and has become a tool compound to probe the physiological functions of FXR. Until now, the mechanism of GW4064 entering and leaving the FXR pocket is still poorly understood. Here, we report a computational study of GW4064 unbinding pathways from FXR by using several molecular dynamics (MD) simulation techniques. Based on the crystal structure of FXR in complex with GW4064, conventional MD was first used to refine the binding and check the stability of GW4064 in the FXR pocket. Random acceleration MD simulations were then performed to explore the possible unbinding pathways of GW4064 from FXR. Four main pathway clusters were found, among which three subpathways, namely Paths 2A, 2B, and 1B, were observed most frequently. Multiple steered MD simulations were further employed to estimate the maximum rupture force and the sum of the forces and to characterize the intermediate states of the ligand unbinding process. By comparing the average force profiles and structural changes, Paths 2A and 2B were identified to be the most favorable unbinding pathways. The former is located between the H1-H2 loop and the H5-H6 loop, and the latter is located in the cleft formed by the H5-H6 loop, H6, and H7. Moreover, the residues lining the pathways were analyzed for their roles in ligand unbinding. Based on our results, the possible structural modification strategies on GW4064 were also proposed.
Pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD), involves interaction between environmental factors and inappropriate immune responses in the intestine of genetically predisposed individuals. Bile acids and their nuclear receptor, FXR, regulate inflammatory responses and barrier function in the intestinal tract.
We studied the association of five variants (rs3863377, rs7138843, rs56163822, rs35724, rs10860603) of the NR1H4 gene encoding FXR with IBD. 1138 individuals (591 non-IBD, 203 UC, 344 CD) were genotyped for five NR1H4 genetic variants with TaqMan SNP Genotyping Assays.
We observed that the NR1H4 SNP rs3863377 is significantly less frequent in IBD cases than in non-IBD controls (allele frequencies: P = 0.004; wild-type vs. SNP carrier genotype frequencies: P = 0.008), whereas the variant rs56163822 is less prevalent in non-IBD controls (allele frequencies: P = 0.027; wild-type vs. SNP carrier genotype frequencies: P = 0.035). The global haplotype distribution between IBD and control patients was significantly different (P = 0.003). This also held true for the comparison between non-IBD and UC groups (P = 0.004), but not for the comparison between non-IBD and CD groups (P = 0.079).
We show that genetic variation in FXR is associated with IBD, further emphasizing the link between bile acid signaling and intestinal inflammation.
Enterohepatic circulation serves to capture bile acids and other steroid metabolites produced in the liver and secreted to the intestine, for reabsorption back into the circulation and reuptake to the liver. This process is under tight regulation by nuclear receptor signaling. Bile acids, produced from cholesterol, can alter gene expression in the liver and small intestine via activating the nuclear receptors farnesoid X receptor (FXR; NR1H4), pregnane X receptor (PXR; NR1I2), vitamin D receptor (VDR; NR1I1), G protein coupled receptor TGR5, and other cell signaling pathways (JNK1/2, AKT and ERK1/2). Among these controls, FXR is known to be a major bile acid-responsive ligand-activated transcription factor and a crucial control element for maintaining bile acid homeostasis. FXR has a high affinity for several major endogenous bile acids, notably cholic acid, deoxycholic acid, chenodeoxycholic acid, and lithocholic acid. By responding to excess bile acids, FXR is a bridge between the liver and small intestine to control bile acid levels and regulate bile acid synthesis and enterohepatic flow. FXR is highly expressed in the liver and gut, relative to other tissues, and contributes to the maintenance of cholesterol/bile acid homeostasis by regulating a variety of metabolic enzymes and transporters. FXR activation also affects lipid and glucose metabolism, and can influence drug metabolism.
Wilson's disease (WD) is an inherited disorder of copper metabolism characterized by liver disease and/or neurologic and psychiatric pathology. The disease is a result of mutation in ATP7B, which encodes the ATP7B copper transporting ATPase. Loss of copper transport function by ATP7B results in copper accumulation primarily in the liver, but also in other organs including the brain. Studies in the Atp7b(-/-) mouse model of WD revealed specific transcript and metabolic changes that precede development of liver pathology, most notably downregulation of transcripts in the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway. In order to gain insight into the molecular mechanisms of transcriptomic and metabolic changes, we used a systems approach analysing the pre-symptomatic hepatic nuclear proteome and liver metabolites. We found that ligand-activated nuclear receptors FXR/NR1H4 and GR/NR3C1 and nuclear receptor interacting partners are less abundant in Atp7b(-/-) hepatocyte nuclei, while DNA repair machinery and the nucleus-localized glutathione peroxidase, SelH, are more abundant. Analysis of metabolites revealed an increase in polyol sugar alcohols, indicating a change in osmotic potential that precedes hepatocyte swelling observed later in disease. This work is the first application of quantitative Multidimensional Protein Identification Technology (MuDPIT) to a model of WD to investigate protein-level mechanisms of WD pathology. The systems approach using "shotgun" proteomics and metabolomics in the context of previous transcriptomic data reveals molecular-level mechanisms of WD development and facilitates targeted analysis of hepatocellular copper toxicity.
Bone tissue contains bile acids which accumulate from serum and which can be released in large amounts in the bone microenvironment during bone resorption. However, the direct effects of bile acids on bone cells remain largely unexplored. Bile acids have been identified as physiological ligands of the farnesoid X receptor (FXR, NR1H4). In the present study, we have examined the effects of FXR activation/inhibition on the osteoblastic differentiation of human bone marrow stromal cells (BMSC). We first demonstrated the expression of FXR in BMSC and SaOS2 osteoblast-like cells, and observed that FXR activation by chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) or by farnesol (FOH) increases the activity of alkaline phosphatase and the calcification of the extracellular matrix. In addition, we observed that FXR agonists are able to stimulate the expression of osteoblast marker genes [bone sialoprotein (BSP), osteocalcin (OC), osteopontin (OPN) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP)] (FXR involvement validated by shRNA-induced gene silencing), as well as the DNA binding activity of the bone transcription factor RUNX2 (EMSA and ChIP assay). Importantly, we observed that nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates (BPs) inhibit the basal osteoblastic differentiation of BMSC, possibly through suppression of endogenous FOH production, independently of their effects on protein prenylation. Likewise, we found that the FXR antagonist guggulsterone (GGS) inhibits ALP activity, calcium deposition, DNA binding of RUNX2, and bone marker expression, indicating that GGS interferes with osteoblastic differentiation. Furthermore, GGS induced the appearance of lipid vesicles in BMSC and stimulated the expression of adipose tissue markers (peroxisome proliferator activated receptor-gamma (PPARγ), adipoQ, leptin and CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein-alpha (C/EBPα)). In conclusion, our data support a new role for FXR in the modulation of osteoblast/adipocyte balance: its activation stimulates RUNX2-mediated osteoblastic differentiation of BMSC, whereas its inhibition leads to an adipocyte-like phenotype.
Intestinal barrier integrity may be disrupted in many conditions allowing for bacterial invasion and ensuing systemic illness. We investigated the efficacy and mechanism of bile salts in protecting the intestinal mucosa integrity after injury through stimulation of cell proliferation and an increased resistance to apoptosis.
Over 7 days, wild-type C57Bl/6J and Nr1h4(tm1Gonz)/J (farnesoid X receptor [FXR] knockout) male mice received either liquid rodent chow alone (for control animals) or with added 50 mg/kg per day of taurodeoxycholic acid (TDCA; for experimental animals). On day 6, all mice received 10 mL/kg of lipopolysaccharide intraperitoneally. On day 7, small intestines were harvested. After immunohistochemistry with hematoxylin and eosin, activated caspase-3, and 5-bromo2'-deoxy-uridine (BrdU), mean proliferating and apoptotic cells were determined with light microscopy. In vitro, FXR proteins were immunoblotted from cultured cells after exposure to TDCA. FXR expression was then inhibited in the presence and absence of TDCA. Intestinal epithelial proliferation along with c-Myc and FXR protein expressions were determined.
C57Bl/6J mice exhibited significant mucosal enterocyte proliferation and decreased mucosal enterocyte apoptosis when provided with supplemental TDCA in their diet. Inhibition of FXR, both in vivo and in vitro, prevented the bile salt-induced enterocyte proliferation and resistance to apoptosis. TDCA exposure stimulated nuclear translocation of FXR resulting in increased expression of c-Myc.
A diet supplemented with bile salts, especially in patients who have decreased luminal bile salt, may prove beneficial and therapeutic in critical illness where intestinal injury is part of the spectrum.
The nuclear bile acid receptor/farnesoid X receptor (FXR; NR1H4) is involved in bile acid homeostasis, cell proliferation and apoptosis and has been linked to intestinal carcinogenesis in mice. Aim of this study was to analyze FXR expression in human normal intestinal mucosa and colon carcinoma. We achieved systematic mapping of FXR expression of human intestinal mucosa and analysis of 75 human colon carcinomas using FXR immunohistochemistry on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue. FXR expression gradually decreased from terminal ileum to the sigmoid colon with strongest expression in the terminal ileum (p &lt; 0.001). FXR expression in carcinomas was reduced compared to peritumoral nonneoplastic mucosa (p &lt; 0.000). Loss of FXR expression was significantly correlated with grading in tumors of the right colon (p = 0.008). FXR expression in tumor and normal tissue showed an inverse correlation with stage. FXR expression in tumor was inversely correlated with clinical outcome. No association was found with patients' age and sex. In nonneoplastic mucosa FXR expression concurred with low expression of Ki-67. In carcinomas, no association was found between FXR expression and Ki-67 and cyclin D1, respectively. Development of colon carcinoma in humans is associated with reduced FXR expression independent of site and may reflect an impaired defense against potentially carcinogenic bile acids along their intestinal gradient. In contrast to normal colon mucosa, FXR expression in carcinomas is not associated with low proliferation. Colon carcinomas with FXR expression seem to be associated with lower stage and a more favourable outcome compared to FXR negative carcinomas.
