First, male and female apoE(-/-) mice were fed an atherogenic diet for 16 weeks from 10 weeks of age. Second, female apoE(-/-) mice were ovariectomized (ovx) or sham operated at 8 weeks of age, and 2-weeks afterwards, one-third of each ovx-group received conjugated equine estrogens (CEE) (0, 2.5 or 5.0 μg/day) for 16 weeks. Atherosclerotic lesions were examined after experimental periods. To clarify anti-atherogenic effect of 17β-estradiol (E2) on artery, neutral cholesteryl ester hydrolase (N-CEase) activity in aorta and peritoneal macrophages, and E2-treated J774A.1 cells were measured.
First, atherosclerotic lesion in female mice was significantly less than male mice without any changes in serum lipids and lipoprotein profile. N-CEase activity in aorta and peritoneal macrophages in female mice was significantly higher than male mice. Second, atherosclerotic lesion in ovx-group was significantly greater than sham-group. CEE-replacement to ovx-group decreased atherosclerotic lesion in a dose-dependent manner. N-CEase activity in aorta and peritoneal macrophages was decreased in ovx-group compared to sham-group, and restored by CEE-replacement in macrophages. To study detailed mechanisms, J774A.1 cells were treated with E2. E2 significantly increased N-CEase activity, and cAMP-dependent protein kinase (A-kinase) type II activity and the protein in cytosol fraction without any changes of total protein of A-kinase type II.
These results suggest that gender difference of atherogenesis is partly accounted for activation of N-CEase through estrogen-dependent translocation of A-kinase type II in macrophages.
Cholesterol ester-laden macrophage foam cells are a hallmark of atherosclerosis. The cycle of esterification and hydrolysis of cholesterol esters is one of the key steps in macrophage cholesterol trafficking. In the process of foam cell formation, excess free cholesterol undergoes esterification by acyl coenzyme A: acylcholesterol transferase 1 (ACAT-1), and fatty acid sterol esters are stored in cytoplasmic lipid droplets. The actions of ACAT-1 are opposed by neutral cholesterol ester hydrolase (nCEH), which generates free cholesterol and fatty acids. The resulting free cholesterol is a preferential source for cholesterol efflux into the extracellular space. Despite the important role of nCEH in protection against foam cell formation and atherosclerosis, the molecular identity of nCEH has long been debated. Although hormone-sensitive lipase (LIPE) has been proposed to be the nCEH in macrophages, recent evidence suggested the existence of other nCEH(s). We have recently identified a novel nCEH, neutral cholesterol ester hydrolase 1 (NCEH1), and demonstrated that NCEH1, in addition to LIPE, primarily mediates the hydrolysis of CE in macrophages. This review focuses on the protective roles of nCEHs in atherosclerosis, with special emphasis on the role of NCEH1.
We have previously demonstrated that neutral cholesterol ester hydrolase 1 (Nceh1) regulates foam cell formation and atherogenesis through the catalytic activity of cholesterol ester hydrolysis, and that Nceh1 and hormone-sensitive lipase (Lipe) are responsible for the majority of neutral cholesterol ester hydrolase activity in macrophages. There are several cholesterol ester-metabolizing tissues and cells other than macrophages, among which adrenocortical cells are also known to utilize the intracellular cholesterol for steroidogenesis. It has been believed that the mobilization of intracellular cholesterol ester in adrenal glands was facilitated solely by Lipe. We herein demonstrate that Nceh1 is also involved in cholesterol ester hydrolysis in adrenal glands. While Lipe deficiency remarkably reduced the neutral cholesterol ester hydrolase activity in adrenal glands as previously reported, additional inactivation of Nceh1 gene completely abrogated the activity. Adrenal glands were enlarged in proportion to the degree of reduced neutral cholesterol ester hydrolase activity, and the enlargement of adrenal glands and the accumulation of cholesterol esters were most pronounced in the Nceh1/Lipe double-deficient mice. Thus Nceh1 is involved in the adrenal cholesterol metabolism, and the cholesterol ester hydrolytic activity in adrenal glands is associated with the organ enlargement.
Hydrolysis of intracellular cholesterol ester (CE) is the key step in the reverse cholesterol transport in macrophage foam cells. We have recently shown that neutral cholesterol ester hydrolase (Nceh)1 and hormone-sensitive lipase (Lipe) are key regulators of this process in mouse macrophages. However, it remains unknown which enzyme is critical in human macrophages and atherosclerosis.
We aimed to identify the enzyme responsible for the CE hydrolysis in human macrophages and to determine its expression in human atherosclerosis.
We compared the expression of NCEH1, LIPE, and cholesterol ester hydrolase (CES1) in human monocyte-derived macrophages (HMMs) and examined the effects of inhibition or overexpression of each enzyme in the cholesterol trafficking. The pattern of expression of NCEH1 was similar to that of neutral CE hydrolase activity during the differentiation of HMMs. Overexpression of human NCEH1 increased the hydrolysis of CE, thereby stimulating cholesterol mobilization from THP-1 macrophages. Knockdown of NCEH1 specifically reduced the neutral CE hydrolase activity. Pharmacological inhibition of NCEH1 also increased the cellular CE in HMMs. In contrast, LIPE was barely detectable in HMMs, and its inhibition did not decrease neutral CE hydrolase activity. Neither overexpression nor knockdown of CES1 affected the neutral CE hydrolase activity. NCEH1 was expressed in CD68-positive macrophage foam cells of human atherosclerotic lesions.
NCEH1 is expressed in human atheromatous lesions, where it plays a critical role in the hydrolysis of CE in human macrophage foam cells, thereby contributing to the initial part of reverse cholesterol transport in human atherosclerosis.
A comprehensive knowledge of the platelet proteome is necessary for understanding thrombosis and for envisioning antiplatelet therapies. To discover other biochemical pathways in human platelets, we screened platelets with a carbamate library designed to interrogate the serine hydrolase subproteome and used competitive activity-based protein profiling to map the targets of active carbamates. We identified an inhibitor that targets arylacetamide deacetylase-like 1 (AADACL1), a lipid deacetylase originally identified in invasive cancers. Using this compound, along with highly selective second-generation inhibitors of AADACL1, metabolomics, and RNA interference, we show that AADACL1 regulates platelet aggregation, thrombus growth, RAP1 and PKC activation, lipid metabolism, and fibrinogen binding to platelets and megakaryocytes. These data provide evidence that AADACL1 regulates platelet and megakaryocyte activation and highlight the value of this chemoproteomic strategy for target discovery in platelets. 
Lipid droplets are universal intracellular organelles composed of a triglyceride, cholesteryl ester and retinyl ester core, surrounded by a monolayer of phospholipids and free (unesterified) cholesterol and lipid droplet-associated proteins. Core lipids are hydrolyzed by lipases to provide fatty acids, cholesterol and retinol for various cellular functions. In addition to cytosolic adipose triglyceride lipase and hormone-sensitive lipase, recent studies show the existence of other neutral lipid hydrolases that reside in the endoplasmic reticulum. In this review we highlight the role of these novel lipases including several members of the carboxylesterase family and enzymes termed arylacetamide deacetylase and KIAA1363/neutral cholesteryl ester hydrolase1/arylacetamide deacetylase-like 1. Some of these enzymes might be attractive targets for the treatment of dyslipidemias, viral infection and atherosclerosis.
Crusted or Norwegian scabies is an infectious skin dermatopathology usually associated with an underlying immunodeficiency condition. It is caused when the mite Sarcoptes scabiei infects the skin, and the immune system is unable to control its spread, leading to a massive hyperinfestation with a simultaneous inflammatory and hyperkeratotic reaction. This is the first report of a novel 1p36 duplication associated with a recurrent infection of crusted scabies.
We describe a 34-year-old patient with a cutaneous immunodeficiency characterized by recurrent crusted scabies infestation, diffuse tinea, and recurrent staphylococcal cellulitis, who we suspected had an undiagnosed syndrome. The patient also suffered from mental retardation, renal failure, and premature senescence. A cytogenetic fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis revealed a 9.34 Mb duplication within the short (p) arm of chromosome 1, precisely from 1p36.11 to 1p36.21, with an adjacent 193 kb copy gain entirely within 1p36.11. In addition, chromosome 4 had a 906 kb gain in 4p16.1 and chromosome 9 had a 81 kb copy gain in 9p24.3. Over 100 genes localized within these duplicated regions. Gene expression array revealed 82 genes whose expression changed &gt;1.5-fold compared to a healthy age-matched skin control, but among them only the lipolytic enzyme arylacetamide deacetylase-like 3 was found within the duplicated 1p36 region of chromosome 1.
Although genetic duplications in the 1p36 region have been previously described, our report describes a novel duplicative variant within the 1p36 region. The patient did not have a past history of immunosuppression but was afflicted by a recurrent case of crusted scabies, raising the possibility that the recurrent infection was associated with the 1p36 genetic duplication.
To our knowledge, the specific duplicated sequence between 1p36.11 and p36.21 found in our patient has never been previously reported. We reviewed and compared the clinical, genotyping, and gene microarray results of our patient in order to characterize this novel 1p36 duplication syndrome, which might have contributed to the recurrent scabies infection in this patient.
The worldwide prevalence of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is increasing rapidly. Although this condition is generally benign, accumulating evidence now suggests that patients with NAFLD are also at increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD); the leading cause of death in developed nations. Despite the well-established role of the liver as a central regulator of circulating low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels, a known driver of CVD, the mechanism(s) by which hepatic steatosis contributes to CVD remains elusive. Interestingly, a recent study has shown that circulating proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) levels correlate positively with liver steatosis grade. Given that PCSK9 degrades the LDL receptor (LDLR) and prevents the removal of LDL from the blood into the liver, in the present study we examined the effect of hepatic steatosis on LDLR expression and circulating LDL cholesterol levels. We now report that in a manner consistent with findings in human patients, diet-induced steatosis increases circulating PCSK9 levels as a result of de novo expression in mice. We also report the novel finding that steatosis abrogates hepatic LDLR expression and increases circulating LDL levels in a PCSK9-dependent manner. These findings provide important mechanistic insights as to how hepatic steatosis modulates lipid regulatory genes like PCSK9 and the LDLR, and also highlights a novel mechanism by which liver disease may contribute to CVD.
Familial apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I) deficiency (FAID) involving low levels of both apoA-I and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol is associated with accelerated atherosclerosis.
The objective of this study was to define distinctive patterns in the lipidome of HDL subpopulations in FAID in relationship to antiatherogenic activities.
Five HDL subfractions were isolated by ultracentrifugation from plasma of FAID Caucasian patients (n = 5) and age-matched healthy normolipidemic Caucasian controls (n = 8), and the HDL lipidome (160 molecular species of 9 classes of phospholipids and sphingolipids) was quantitatively evaluated.
Increased concentrations of numerous molecular species of lysophosphatidylcholine (up to 12-fold), ceramides (up to 3-fold), phosphatidylserine (up to 34-fold), phosphatidic acid (up to 71-fold), and phosphatidylglycerol (up to 20-fold) were detected throughout all five HDL subpopulations as compared with their counterparts from controls, whereas concentrations of phosphatidylethanolamine species were decreased (up to 5-fold). Moderately to highly abundant, within their lipid class, species of phosphatidylcholine, sphingomyelin, phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylserine, and ceramide featuring multiple unsaturations were primarily affected by apoA-I deficiency; their HDL content, particularly that of phosphatidylcholine (34:2), was strongly correlated with HDL function, impaired in FAID. Metabolic pathway analysis revealed that sphingolipid, glycerophospholipid, and linoleic acid metabolism was significantly affected by FAID.
These data reveal that altered content of specific phospholipid and sphingolipid species is linked to deficient antiatherogenic properties of HDL in FAID.
National objectives recommend healthcare professionals provide physical activity advice. This study examined health and demographic characteristics associated with receipt of medical advice to increase physical activity among U.S. health care-utilizing adults and differences in associations by age group.
Analyses included 8,410 health care-utilizing adults aged ≥20 years from the 2013-2016 National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (analyzed in 2018). Logistic regression was used to examine associations between receipt of medical advice to increase physical activity in the past year and measured health conditions, reported health behaviors, and demographic characteristics. Models were stratified by age group (20-39, 40-59, and ≥60 years).
Physical activity medical advice was received by 42.9% (95% CI=40.8, 44.9) of adults overall. By age group, 32.7% of younger adults, 46.7% of middle-aged adults, and 48.9% of older adults received advice. Among all adults and across all age groups, receipt of advice was higher among adults with chronic health conditions: obesity (63.0%, 95% CI=60.3, 65.7), hypertension (56.5%, 95%=CI 53.8, 59.2), diabetes (69.8%, 95% CI=66.5, 72.8), hypercholesterolemia (55.6%, 95% CI=52.3, 59.0), and low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (53.8%, 95% CI=50.1, 57.4). Among all adults, those with obesity, hypertension, and diabetes had significantly greater odds of receipt of advice after adjustment. Stronger associations between diabetes and hypercholesterolemia and receiving physical activity advice were observed among younger adults.
Receipt of physical activity medical advice was highest among adults with specific chronic health conditions, and this pattern was stronger among younger adults with diabetes and hypercholesterolemia. However, most health care-utilizing adults did not receive physical activity medical advice.
Many parameters can affect the level of inflammation during acute coronary syndromes (ACS). We aimed to assess the one-year risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) and bleeding associated with elevated hsCRP levels during ACS, taking into account the severity of myocardial infarction, the timing of blood sampling and established long-term prognostic factors.
We studied 1864 consecutive patients with ACS enrolled in a contemporary multicenter prospective cohort study in Switzerland. HsCRP levels were determined at hospital admission. One year after discharge MACE and bleeding events were assessed. Multivariable adjusted Cox proportional hazards were computed with age, sex, time from symptom onset to blood draw, body mass index, current smoking, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, pre-existing cardiovascular disease, history of inflammatory disease, LDL-cholesterol levels, type of ACS, left ventricular ejection fraction and GRACE 1.0 risk score.
At one-year follow-up, 151 (8.1%) patients suffered MACE. Compared to patients with hsCRP below 2 mg/l, the risk of MACE was higher in patients with hsCRP levels between 2 and 5 mg/l, with a multivariate adjusted hazard ratio (HR) of 1.63 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.93-2.84), in those with levels between 5 and 10 mg/l, with a HR of 2.80 (95% CI 1.58-4.96), and in those with levels above 10 mg/l, with a HR of 2.23 (95% CI 1.28-3.88). There was no difference in bleeding risk between the four groups.
Systemic inflammation in the acute phase of myocardial infarction is an independent predictor for cardiovascular events, but not for bleeding.
and purpose: Adolescent obesity has been increasing globally, and intervention is important. This study examined the effects of auricular acupressure on reducing obesity in adolescents.
Participants were 58 obese adolescents, divided into an experimental (n = 32) and a control group (n = 26). The study design was a randomized controlled trial. Auricular acupressure using vaccaria seeds was administered to the experimental group, while placebo auricular acupressure using vaccaria seeds was administered to the control group. Sessions continued for 8 weeks. Outcome measures included body weight, abdominal circumference, hip circumference, waist-hip ratio, body-mass index, body-fat mass, body-fat percentage, triglycerides, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, serum glucose, and leptin.
Adolescents in the experimental group showed significant improvement in total cholesterol levels and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels after 8 weeks compared with those in the control group (p &lt; 0.001).
Auricular acupressure using vaccaria seeds was effective in decreasing total cholesterol levels and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels in adolescents with obesity.
Background: The improvement of living standards has led to increases in the prevalence of hypokinetic diseases. In particular, multifactorial complex diseases, such as metabolic syndrome, are becoming more prevalent. Currently, developing effective methods to combat or prevent metabolic syndrome is of critical public health importance. Thus, we conducted a systematic review to evaluate the existing literature regarding the effects of Wuqinxi exercise on reducing risk factors related to metabolic syndrome. Methods: Both English- and Chinese-language databases were searched for randomized controlled trials investigating the effects of Wuqinxi on these outcomes. Meanwhile, we extracted usable data for computing pooled effect size estimates, along with the random-effects model. Results: The synthesized results showed positive effects of Wuqinxi exercise on systolic blood pressure (SBP, SMD = 0.62, 95% CI 0.38 to 0.85, p &lt; 0.001, I2 = 24.06%), diastolic blood pressure (DBP, SMD = 0.62, 95% CI 0.22 to 1.00, p &lt; 0.001, I2 = 61.28%), total plasma cholesterol (TC, SMD = 0.88, 95% CI 0.41 to 1.36, p &lt; 0.001, I2 = 78.71%), triglyceride (TG, SMD = 0.87, 95% CI 0.49 to 1.24, p &lt; 0.001, I2 = 67.22%), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C, SMD = 1.24, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.72, p &lt; 0.001, I2 = 78.27%), and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL, SMD = 0.95, 95% CI 0.43 to 1.46, p &lt; 0.001, I2 = 82.27%). In addition, regression results showed that longer-duration Wuqinxi intervention significantly improved DBP (β = 0.00016, Q = 5.72, df = 1, p = 0.02), TC (β = -0.00010, Q = 9.03, df = 1, p = 0.01), TG (β = 0.00012, Q = 6.23, df = 1, p = 0.01), and LDL (β = 0.00011, Q = 5.52, df = 1, p = 0.02). Conclusions: Wuqinxi may be an effective intervention to alleviate the cardiovascular disease risk factors of metabolic syndrome.
High plasma cholesterol levels are able to trigger several pathophysiological events, including inflammation, cell damage and especially oxidative stress. Previously, studies have shown that sildenafil exhibited antioxidant effects in several experimental models. Here we evaluate the role of sildenafil in liver redox equilibrium of apolipoprotein E knockout (apoE-KO) mice.
ApoE-KO mice were divided in two groups: one group received the PDE5 inhibitor sildenafil (40 mg/kg/day) for 3 weeks (apoE-KO + Sil) and was compared to a second group of apoE-KO mice, which received only the vehicle (water) for 3 weeks (apoE-KO). Control group (C57 mice) received only a standard chow diet. At the age of 18 weeks, mice livers were collected for the measurement of intracellular ROS levels and apoptotic cells by flow cytometry analysis, and mitochondria isolation for proteomic analysis.
Compared to the control group, liver cells from apoE-KO presented some typical redox imbalance features: higher levels of intracellular ROS (global oxidative stress ˜60%, superoxide anion ˜82%, and peroxynitrite/hydroxyl radical ˜53%), higher amounts of apoptotic cells (up to ˜19%) and higher mitochondrial intensity of catalase (+339%) and transferrin spots (+914%). After treatment with sildenafil, apoE-KO presented ROS levels and the number of apoptotic cells similar to those observed in C57. In addition, when compared to apoE-KO, apoE-KO + Sil showed lower spots volumes of catalase (-23%) and transferrin (-71%) and up-regulation of urate oxidase (+94%).
The treatment with sildenafil is able to induce beneficial changes in liver mitochondrial protein dynamics, which restores the redox homeostasis contributing to a potential hepatoprotection.
Target and intensity of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) lowering therapy should be tailored according to the individual global cardiovascular (CV) risk. We aimed at retrospectively evaluating real-life LDL-C goal attainment and predictive factors for predefined LDL-C therapeutic goals both in primary and secondary prevention.
We collected data from a large cohort of outpatients aged 40-65 years, followed by general practitioners, cardiologists and diabetologists in Italy. All data were centrally analysed for global CV risk assessment and rates of control of major CV risk factors, including LDL-C. Study population was stratified according to the presence or absence of previous CV events, including coronary artery disease (CAD), peripheral artery disease (PAD) or stroke/TIA. CV risk profile characterization was based on the European SCORE. Predefined therapeutic goals were set according to the European guidelines on dyslipidaemia: LDL-C levels &lt;70 mg/dl for very high CV risk patients in primary prevention and for those in secondary prevention; &lt;100 mg/dl LDL-C levels for high CV risk patients in primary prevention. Logistic regression analysis with clinical covariates was used to identify predictive factors for achieving these goals; lipid lowering therapy entered in the analysis as continuous (model 1) or categorical variable (model 2).
We included 4,142 outpatients (43,7% female, age 58.0 ± 5.2 years, BMI 28.5 ± 5.0 kg/m2) among whom 2,964 (71.6%) in primary and 1,178 (28.4%) in secondary prevention. In primary prevention, none of the patients at very high CV risk had LDL-C &lt;70 mg/dl and 8.9% of patients at high CV risk showed LDL-C &lt;100 mg/dl. Only 5.8% of patients in secondary prevention had LDL-C levels &lt;70 mg/dl, specifically 6.5% of patients with CAD, 2.6% of patients with PAD and 4.7% of patients with CVD (p &lt; 0.001). Beyond diabetes and lipid lowering therapy, high risk SCORE estimation resulted a strong and independent predictor for the lack of achieving all predefined therapeutic targets, including LDL-C &lt;100 mg/dl [OR: 0.806 (0.751-0.865)); p &lt; 0.001], and LDL-C &lt;70 mg/dl [OR: 0.712 (0-576-0.880); p = 0.002], in primary prevention.
Despite high or very high SCORE risk and use of lipid lowering therapies, we observed poor achievement of LDL-C targets in this large cohort of outpatients followed in a setting of real practice in Italy.
Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have proven to be involved in the progression of atherosclerosis and dyslipidemia. In addition, vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) phenotype switching, including VSMCs-derived foam cells formation, plays a key role in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. LncRNA ENST00000602558.1, one of the differentially expressed lncRNAs between coronary artery disease (CAD) patients and healthy controls identified by our previous study, was located to TG and HDL susceptibility loci, but its role and underlying mechanism in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis remain unclear. The present study aims to explore the role and underlying mechanism of ENST00000602558.1 in the regulation of cholesterol efflux from VSMCs.
ABCG1 mRNA and protein expression in VSMCs was detected using qRT-PCR and Western blot, respectively. ABCG1-mediated cholesterol efflux to HDL from VSMCs was measured by means of NBD-cholesterol fluorescence intensity. The binding of ENST00000602558.1 to p65 and p65 to ABCG1 promoter region was detected by RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) assay and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay, respectively.
Overexpression of ENST00000602558.1 downregulated ABCG1 mRNA and protein expression, while knockdown of ENST00000602558.1 upregulated ABCG1 mRNA and protein expression. Consistently, ENST00000602558.1 overexpression decreased ABCG1-mediated cholesterol efflux to HDL from VSMCs by 30.38% (p &lt; 0.001), and knockdown of ENST00000602558.1 increased ABCG1-mediated cholesterol efflux to HDL from VSMCs by 30.41% (p = 0.001). In addition to cholesterol efflux, overexpression of ENST00000602558.1 increased lipid accumulation and TC/TG levels, while knockdown of ENST00000602558.1 decreased lipid accumulation and TC/TG levels in VSMCs. Furthermore, we confirmed that ENST00000602558.1 regulated ABCG1 expression and ABCG1-mediated cholesterol efflux from VSMCs through binding to p65.
In conclusion, ENST00000602558.1 played an important role in mediating cholesterol efflux to HDL from VSMCs by regulating ABCG1 expression through binding to p65.
Type II diabetes mellitus (T2DM) affects an estimate of 450 million individuals. Hence, there remains an urgent need to explore the use of novel biomarkers with the aim of preventing and managing cardiovascular risk among these individuals. Hallmarks of this condition are lipid and glucose dyshomeostasis which are accompanied by a prothrombotic phenotype; these pose as eminent links between T2DM and cardiovascular disease. Diabetic dyslipidemia affects not only plasma lipid profiles but extends further into the haematological system, modulating the cholesterol concentration of erythrocyte membranes. Elevations in this biomarker implicate cell biophysics and contribute to an increased cardiovascular risk. Here we investigate the variation of membrane cholesterol levels in RBCs, as well as the degree of hypercoagubility between healthy and type II diabetic subjects. Furthermore, we provide an adapted method to assess erythrocyte membrane cholesterol levels using a quantitative and qualitative approach. In conclusion, individuals with type II diabetes exhibit elevated erythrocyte membrane cholesterol levels which may act as a prominent link between the diabetic state and subsequent cardiovascular complications. Ultimately, this erythrocyte parameter exhibits applicative biomarker potential and may provide clinical utility in terms of disease monitoring and prognostics.
Niemann-Pick type C (NP-C) disease is a rare and fatal neurodegenerative disease typified by aberrations in intracellular lipid transport. Cholesterol and other lipids accumulate in the late endosome/lysosome of all diseased cells thereby causing neuronal and visceral atrophy. A cure for NP-C remains elusive despite the extensive molecular advances emanating from the identification of the primary genetic defect in 1997. Penetration of the blood-brain barrier and efficacy in the viscera are prerequisites for effective therapy, however the rarity of NP-C disease is the major impediment to progress. Disease diagnosis is challenging and establishment of appropriate test populations for clinical trials difficult. Fortunately, disease models that span the diversity of microbial and metazoan life have been utilized to advance the quest for a therapy. The complexity of lipid storage in this disorder and in the model systems, has led to multiple theories on the primary disease mechanism and consequently numerous and varied proposed interventions. Here, we conduct an evaluation of these studies.
This study, for the first time in fish, compared the transcriptome of fresh and frozen-thawed sperm, and would help to better understand the effect of cryopreservation on fish sperm and then better preserve the aquatic germplasm resources. Here, we employed high-throughput sequencing technology to obtain the transcriptome of yellow catfish from fresh sperm, cryopreserved sperm with and without cryoprotectant. When cryoprotectant (Me2SO) was excluded, down-regulated genes were significantly enriched into calcium ion binding, cytoskeletal protein binding, microfilament motor activity and carnitine O-acyltransferase activity, which affected Ca2+ regulation, cellular morphology, motility and metabolism. Moreover, heat shock proteins and genes associated with regulation of cholesterol, HCO3- and protein tyrosine phosphorylation (PTP) were down-regulated, and thus would impair ability against stress, membrane rigidity, pH regulation and signal transduction of cryopreserved sperm. After Me2SO was added, the amounts of DEGs decreased significantly and down-regulation of genes were found mainly in cytoskeleton and heat shock proteins, thereby suggesting that Me2SO effectively reduced the impact caused by low temperature on gene expression. Whether adding Me2SO or not, the up-regulated genes were mainly found in ribosomal proteins genes. However, when Me2SO was added, over-expression of some genes might contribute to maintain normal function of cryopreserved sperm.
Myelin regeneration by myelinating oligodendrocytes is key to neuronal damage repair for treatment of neurological disorders such as multiple sclerosis. In this issue of Cell Chemical Biology, Allimuthu et al. (2019) report new small molecule inhibitors of cholesterol biosynthesis enzymes that enhance oligodendrocyte formation and subsequent remyelination.
High PCSK9 concentrations are associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). We investigated PCSK9 concentrations and their association with metabolic parameters in Thai subjects and to compare PCSK9 concentrations in pre- and postmenopausal women with and without metabolic syndrome (MetS).
Anthropometric data, serum lipids, fasting blood glucose (FBG), and PCSK9 concentrations were measured in 436 Thai subjects (152 men, 143 premenopausal, and 141 postmenopausal women).
PCSK9 concentrations were significantly higher in women than in men (p = .002) and increased in subjects with an increasing number of MetS components (p for trend = .011). PCSK9 concentrations were significantly higher in postmenopausal women than in premenopausal women (p &lt; .001), in the MetS group than in the non-MetS group (p = .037), and in postmenopausal women with MetS than in premenopausal women without MetS (p &lt; .001). Serum PCSK9 concentrations were positively correlated with several metabolic parameters, including age, BMI, systolic blood pressure (SBP), total cholesterol, triglyceride, LDL-C, and FBG.
PCSK9 concentrations are influenced by age, gender, MetS status, and menopausal status among Thai subjects. These findings suggest that an elevation in PCSK9 concentrations may increase cardiovascular risk in postmenopausal women with MetS.
Ginsenoside Rg1 is the active ingredient of Chinese herbal medicine ginseng and sanqi, which has remarkable effects on anti-inflammation and anti-diabetes. In this study, we explored the molecular mechanism of ginsenoside Rg1 against diabetes in rat subjected to insulin resistance induced by high-fat and high-sugar (HFHS). Biochemical analysis revealed that ginsenoside Rg1 significantly decreased the serum levels of alanine transaminase, aspartate transaminase, alkaline phosphatase, total cholesterol, triglyceride, low-density lipoprotein and increased the serum levels of high-density lipoprotein, which indicated ginsenoside Rg1 improved the extent of hepatic steatosis. Furthermore, ginsenoside Rg1 suppressed the expression of IL-1β, IL-6,TNF-α,NF-κB and G6Pase, however, p-Akt was up-regulated. These results suggested that ginsenosideRg1 improved insulin resistance through suppressing inflammatory response and glucose output, which may be a potential therapeutic strategy in protecting hepatic steatosis.
Low birth weight (LBW, &lt;2500 g) may predict an increased risk of an adverse cardiometabolic profile later in life, but long-term effects in different populations and birth weight strata are still unclear. We explored laboratory markers of cardiometabolic risk in children born with marginally LBW (2000-2500 g).
This was a prospective longitudinal cohort study including 285 Swedish marginally LBW children and 95 normal birth weight (NBW, 2501-4500 g) controls. At 3.5 and 7 years of age, blood samples for glucose, insulin, homeostatic model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), cholesterol, triglycerides, high- and low density lipoprotein (HDL and LDL), apolipoprotein B (ApoB) and apolipoprotein A1 (ApoA1) were assessed and compared between the groups.
No significant differences in levels of insulin, HOMA-IR, hs-CRP or blood lipids were observed between marginally LBW and NBW children. At 7 years there was a higher proportion of marginally LBW children with elevated levels of insulin, defined as above the 90th percentile of the control group (21% vs 8.6%, p = 0.038). This association was, however, confounded by maternal ethnicity. In marginally LBW children born small for gestational age (SGA), mean fasting glucose was significantly higher compared to controls (4.7 vs 4.5 mmol/L, p = 0.020).
There were no significant differences in insulin, insulin resistance, hs-CRP or blood lipids between the marginally LBW children and controls. The subgroup of marginally LBW children born SGA may present early signs of glucose imbalance already at school age.
Osteoarthritis (OA) is a multifactorial joint disease and a common disabling condition in the elderly population. The associated pain and pathohistological changes in cartilage are common features of OA in both humans and animal models. Shea nut oil extract (SheaFlex75) contains a high triterpenoid concentration and has demonstrated anti-inflammatory and antiarthritic effects in both human and animal studies. In this study, we aim to investigate the potential of SheaFlex75 to prevent articular cartilage deterioration in a rat model of chronic OA progression. By employing anterior cruciate ligament transection (ACLT) with medial meniscectomy (MMx)-induced OA, we found attenuation of both early and chronic onset OA pain and cartilage degeneration in ACLT+MMx rats receiving SheaFlex75 dietary supplementation. Under long-term oral administration, the rats with induced OA presented sustained protection of both pain and OA cartilage integrity compared to the OA-control rats. Moreover, rats subjected to long-term SheaFlex75 ingestion showed normal biochemical profiles (AST, BUN and total cholesterol) and presented relatively lower triglycerides (TGs) and body weights than the OA-control rats, which suggested the safety of prolonged use of this oil extract. Based on the present evidence, preventive management is advised to delay/prevent onset and progression in OA patients. Therefore, we suggest that SheaFlex75 may be an effective management strategy for symptom relief and cartilage protection in patients with both acute and chronic OA.
Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is associated with metabolic syndromes spanning a wide spectrum of diseases, from simple steatosis to the more complex nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. To identify the deregulation that occurs in metabolic processes at the molecular level that give rise to these various NAFLD phenotypes, algorithms such as pathway enrichment analysis (PEA) can be used. These analyses require the use of predefined pathway maps, which are composed of reactions describing metabolic processes/subsystems. Unfortunately, the annotation of the metabolic subsystems can differ depending on the pathway database used, making these approaches subject to biases associated with different pathway annotations, and these methods cannot capture the balancing of cofactors and byproducts through the complex nature and interactions of genome-scale metabolic networks (GEMs). Here, we introduce a framework entitled Minimum Network Enrichment Analysis (MiNEA) that is applied to GEMs to generate all possible alternative minimal networks (MiNs), which are possible and feasible networks composed of all the reactions pertaining to various metabolic subsystems that can synthesize a target metabolite. We applied MiNEA to investigate deregulated MiNs and to identify key regulators in different NAFLD phenotypes, such as a fatty liver and liver inflammation, in both humans and mice by integrating condition-specific transcriptomics data from liver samples. We identified key deregulations in the synthesis of cholesteryl esters, cholesterol, and hexadecanoate in both humans and mice, and we found that key regulators of the hydrogen peroxide synthesis network were regulated differently in humans and mice. We further identified which MiNs demonstrate the general and specific characteristics of the different NAFLD phenotypes. MiNEA is applicable to any GEM and to any desired target metabolite, making MiNEA flexible enough to study condition-specific metabolism for any given disease or organism.
Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis is characterized by filling of the alveolar spaces by lipoprotein rich material of ill-defined composition, and which is caused by molecularly different and often rare diseases occurring from birth to old age.
Quantitative lipidomic analysis of lipids and surfactant proteins A, B and C from lavage fluids of patients with different causes of proteinosis in comparison to healthy contols.
During the last decades we collected alveolar lavage samples from patients with PAP due to autoantibodies against GMCSF, genetic mutations in CSF2RA, MARS, FARSB, NPC2 and secondary to myeloid leukemia. Their lipid composition was quantified.
Free cholesterol was largely increased by 60-fold and cholesterol esters by 24-fold. There was an excessive more than 130-fold increase in ceramide and other sphingolipids. Particularly long chain ceramide d18:1/20:0 or d18:1/24:0 were elevated, likely contributing to the pro-apoptotic environment observed in pulmonary alveolar proteinosis. Cellular debris lipids like phosphatidylethanolamine or phosphatidylserine were only moderately increased by 4 to 7-fold. The surfactant lipid class phosphatidylcholine expanded 17-fold, lyso- phosphatidylcholine 54-fold, and the surfactant proteins A, B, C 144-, 4- and 17-fold. All these changes did not differ between the various diseases causing pulmonary alveolar proteinosis.
This insight into the alveolar lipidome may provide monitoring tools and may open new therapeutic strategies for pulmonary alveolar proteinosis.
Statins are the mainstay of therapy for cardiovascular risk reduction in patients with diabetes mellitus. It is estimated that there are more than half a billion patients with diabetes mellitus worldwide and the numbers of prevalent cases of diabetes are expected to increase in both developed and developing countries in the next decade. Statins reduce risk of mortality and morbidity mainly by reducing blood low density cholesterol. Statins, along with other medical treatments, are responsible for about half of the decrease in cardiovascular mortality over the past several decades. Multiple clinical trials have found evidence for statin use in patients with diabetes, for both primary prevention and secondary prevention. The benefit of statins in patients with coronary heart disease and diabetes in terms of absolute risk reduction is twice as much as compared to the risk in patients with coronary heart disease but no diabetes. The proportion of patients with diabetes treated with statins has increased steadily over the past few decades with concurrent decrease in cardiovascular deaths in this high-risk population. However, there are significant unmet needs in cardiovascular risk reduction, due to underutilization of statins and due to residual cardiovascular risk despite maximal statin therapy. Future strategies in population risk reduction in diabetics should include maximal statin therapy, additional treatment with nonstatin therapy and new paradigms of prevention with early intervention with shorter, more intensive therapy to potentially "reverse" atherosclerosis with goals of reducing clinical cardiovascular disease later in life.
Diabetic dyslipidaemia, characterized by quantitative, qualitative and kinetic changes in all major circulating lipids, contributes to the increased cardiovascular risk in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). A promising therapeutic avenue is the inhibition of the proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin 9 (PCSK9) with human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that potently reduce plasma low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels on top of statin treatment. The aim of this review is to evaluate the efficacy of PCSK9 inhibitors to lower the residual cardiovascular risk of T2DM patients and to discuss the safety of PCSK9 inhibition in these patients. PCSK9 inhibitors potently lower plasma LDL-C levels in T2DM patients and reduce risk for the development of cardiovascular disease. Anti-PCSK9 mAbs are generally not more or less effective in T2DM patients compared to a general high-risk population. Nevertheless, due to their higher cardiovascular risk, the absolute risk reduction of major cardiovascular events is more significant in T2DM patients. This suggests that treatment of T2DM patients with anti-PCSK9 mAbs could be attractive from a cost-effectiveness perspective. Treatment with anti-PCSK9 mAbs did not result in significant treatment-emergent adverse effects. While genetic studies suggest a potential link between PCSK9 inhibition and glucose homeostasis, anti-PCSK9 mAbs did not worsen glycaemic control in T2DM patients, but their safety should be verified after a longer-term follow-up.
There is now significant evidence for the benefits of lowering low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c) to reduce the risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). Although statins are the most widely prescribed lipid-lowering therapy that effectively lower LDL-c, especially in combination with ezetimibe, some patients require adjunctive therapy to further lower LDL-c and mitigate attendant risk of ASCVD. The gap can be filled by proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) monoclonal antibodies whose use is currently supported by two recent cardiovascular outcome studies and new treatment guidelines. We provide an overview of extant studies investigating PCSK9 monoclonal antibodies in various patient populations, an update of the guidelines regarding their use and a case-based discussion.
The relevance of endogenous 4β-hydroxycholesterol (4β-OHC) plasma concentrations or of the 4β-OHC/total cholesterol concentration ratio (4β-OHC ratio) as surrogate markers of CYP3A activity was evaluated in individuals with (n=38) or without (n=35) type 2 diabetes (T2D). Midazolam was used as a comparator to validate exploratory measures of phenotypic CYP3A activity. Metabolic ratios (MR) of orally administered midazolam in the non-diabetic and diabetic populations correlated significantly with 4β-OHC (rs =0.64 and 0.48: p≤0.003) and 4β-OHC ratio (rs =0.69 and 0.46; p≤0.003), respectively. Activity of CYP3A was lower in the T2D population compared to non-diabetic subjects: this decrease was reflected in 4β-OHC concentrations (24.33 vs 12.58 ng/ml; p&lt;0.0001) and 4β-OHC ratio (0.13 vs 0.09 (x104 ); p&lt;0.0002). These results suggest that 4β-OHC should be considered as a valid, convenient and easy to use endogenous biomarker of CYP3A activity in patients. This article is protected by copyright.

Carotid atherosclerosis, especially rupture of plaques is related to cerebrovascular diseases (CVDs). Non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C) is relevant with CVDs and may be a potential risk factor. We designed this study to investigate the association between non-HDL-C and prevalence of asymptomatic vulnerable carotid atherosclerotic plaques.
We enrolled 2888 participants who underwent carotid atherosclerotic plaques detection and non-HDL-C measurement, with no history of taking lipid-lowering agents from the Asymptomatic Polyvascular Abnormalities Community (APAC) study. We used multivariable logistic regression to estimate the association between non-HDL-C levels and the presence of asymptomatic vulnerable carotid atherosclerotic plaques.
In our study, 1505 subjects had asymptomatic vulnerable carotid atherosclerotic plaques, and 1383 subjects had stable plaques. After adjustment for confounding factors, the odds ratios (95% confidence interval) for vulnerable plaques of non-HDL-C levels in middle tertile group and highest tertile group were: 1.02 (0.84-1.23), 1.50 (1.23-1.82), respectively (p trend&lt;0.01).
In our community-based, observational, and cross-sectional study, non-HDL-C level is a significant risk factor for the occurrence of asymptomatic vulnerable carotid plaques. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
Some adiponectin gene (ADIPOQ) and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been related to adiponectin levels and metabolic parameters. Few studies of interaction gene-nutrient have been realized in this topic area. The aim of our study was to analyze the effect of the rs1501299 ADIPOQ gene polymorphism, and the dietary intake on total adiponectin levels and the insulin resistance changes after an enriched-monounsaturated fat (Diet M) vs. an enriched-polyunsaturated fat hypocaloric diet (Diet P).
A Caucasian population of 363 obese patients was enrolled in a randomized clinical trial with two hypocaloric diets. Before and after 12 weeks on each hypocaloric diet, an anthropometric evaluation, an assessment of nutritional intake and a biochemical analysis were realized. The statistical analysis was performed for the combined GT and TT as a group (mutant) and GG as second group (wild).
With both caloric restriction strategies, body weight, body mass index (BMI), fat mass, waist circumference, systolic blood pressure and leptin levels decreased. After Diet P, only subjects with GG genotype showed a significant improvement in the insulin levels (GG vs. GT±TT) (-3.2±1.0 mU/L vs. -0.6±0.4 mU/L: p=0.01) and in the homeostasis model assessment (HOMA-IR) (-1.1±0.2 units vs. -0.3±0.4 units: p=0.02). The same improvement in both parameters was reported after Diet M: insulin levels (-3.7±0.9 mU/L vs. -0.4±0.5 mU/L: p=0.01) and HOMA-IR (-1.0±0.2 units vs. -0.4±0.3 units: p=0.03). After weight loss with diet M, both genotypes (GG vs. GT±TT) showed similar decrease in total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol. Only subjects with GG genotype showed a significant increase of the adiponectin levels after both diets: (Diet P: 9.3±3.0 ng/dl vs. Diet M: 8.2±2.9 ng/dl: p=0.38).
The GG genotype of ADIPOQ gene variant (rs1501299) is associated to a significant improvement in the adiponectin levels and a decrease of insulin and HOMA-IR after two different hypocaloric diets with different profile of unsaturated dietary fats.
Cholesterol 24-hydroxylation is the major mechanism for cholesterol removal from the brain and the reaction catalyzed by cytochrome P450 46A1 (CYP46A1), a CNS-specific enzyme. This review describes CYP46A1 in the context of cholesterol homeostasis in the brain and summarizes available experimental data on CYP46A1 association with different neurologic diseases, including the mechanisms by which changes in the CYP46A1 activity in the brain could be beneficial for these diseases. The modulation of CYP46A1 activity by genetic and pharmacologic means is also presented along with a brief synopsis of the two clinical trials that evaluate CYP46A1 as a therapeutic target for Alzheimer's disease as well as Dravet and Lennox-Gastaut syndromes.
This study aimed to investigate premature mortality and the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in Chinese adults with diabetes diagnosed before the age of 45 years.
A total of 519 participants with normal glucose tolerance (NGT) and 630 with newly diagnosed diabetes mellitus (DM) were recruited in 1986 in the Da Qing Diabetes Study. In 2009, the participants were followed up to assess mortality and CVD events. The subjects were stratified into four subgroups according to age and diabetes status: age &lt;45 years with NGT (NGT&lt;45y), age &lt;45 years with DM (DM&lt;45y), age ≥45 years with NGT (NGT≥45y), and age ≥45 years with DM (DM≥45y). The risk of death and CVD events in patients with young-onset DM and elder subjects with NGT were compared to show the extent of premature death and CVD in the DM participants.
During the 23-year follow-up, 26 (10.40%) participants in NGT&lt;45y, 72 (34.12%) in DM&lt;45y, 74 (30.58%) in NGT≥45y, and 266 (68.73%) in DM≥45y died, including 13 (5.20%), 36 (17.06%), 24 (9.92%), and 128 (33.07%) death attributed to CVD. The corresponding rates of CVD events were 56 (22.40%), 90 (42.65%), 89 (36.78), and 213 (55.04%). It also showed that the risk of all-cause death (HR 1.23, 95% CI 0.88-1.71) or CVD events (HR 1.25, 95% CI 0.93-1.69) did not differ significantly between the DM&lt;45y and NGT≥45y groups after adjusting for sex, smoking, body mass index, systolic blood pressure, total cholesterol and previous history of CVD. Of note, participants in the DM&lt;45y group had an higher risk of CVD mortality compared with that in the NGT≥45y group (HR 1.76, 95% CI 1.04-2.98), although the mean age in the former group was 12 years lesser than that in the latter group (39.01 ± 5.00 vs 51.45 ± 5.14).
Young-onset diabetes is a risk factor for the premature death and cardiovascular disease. Early prevention and intensive treatment are warrented in patients with young-onset diabetes.
This study aimed to investigate the effect of ginger (Zingiber officinale, Rosc.) essential oil on growth and laying performances, egg yolk antioxidant and cholesterol status, and serum metabolites in Japanese quail. Eighty 3-week-old Japanese quails weighing between 120 and 130 g were equally and randomly assigned to four groups receiving daily and orally, respectively, 100 µl/kg body weight (bw) distilled water and 50, 100, and 150 µl/kg bw of ginger rhizomes essential oil, respectively. The entire feeding trial for all groups lasted for 9 weeks and the Z. officinale essential oil effects were studied on growth and laying performances, serum metabolites, and egg yolk antioxidant and cholesterol status. Results revealed that feed intake, live and body weights gain, feed conversion ratio, egg production, and weekly mass of eggs were not significantly (P&gt;0.05) influenced by oral administration of ginger rhizomes essential oil. Unlike the abdominal fat weight which decreased significantly (p&lt;0.05) in all treated quails, the oral administration of ginger rhizomes essential oil had no significant effects (p&gt; 0.05) on liver, intestine, heart, and gizzard relative weights as compared to the control. Egg weight markedly (P&lt;0.05) increased in Japanese quails treated with ginger rhizomes essential oil whatever the dose with reference to the control. The serum content in total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, and transaminases (AST and ALT) decreased significantly (P&lt;0.05) with 100 and 150 µl/kg bw of ginger rhizomes essential oil compared to control group. In conclusion, oral administration of 100 to 150 µl/kg bw of ginger rhizomes essential oil to laying Japanese quails positively influences egg weight and decreased serum and egg cholesterols without any adverse effect on feed intake and body weight gain.
In addition to the "gold standard" of therapy-steroids and gene therapy-there are experimental trials using granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) for patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). The aim of this study was to present the biochemical changes in blood after repeating cycles of granulocyte-colony stimulating factor G-CSF therapy in children with DMD.
Nineteen patients, aged 5 to 15 years, with diagnosed DMD confirmed by genetic tests, participated; nine were in wheelchairs, and ten were mobile and independent. Patients had a clinical assessment and laboratory tests to evaluate hematological parameters and biochemistry. G-CSF (5μg/kg/day) was given subcutaneously for five days during five nonconsecutive months over the course of a year.
We found a significant elevation of white blood cells, and the level of leucocytes returned to norm after each cycle. No signs of any inflammatory process were found by monitoring C-reactive protein. We did not detect significant changes in red blood cells, hemoglobin, and platelet levels or coagulation parameters. We found a significant elevation of uric acid, with normalization after finishing each treatment cycle. A significant decrease of the mean value activity of aspartate transaminase (AST) and alanine transaminase (ALT) of the G-CSF treatment was noted. After each five days of therapy, the level of cholesterol was significantly lowered. Also, glucose concentration significantly decreased after the fourth cycle.
G-SCF decreased the aminotransferases activity, cholesterol level, and glucose level in patients with DMD, which may be important for patients with DMD and metabolic syndrome.
The use of statins in non-selected type 1 diabetes (T1D) populations is low. We assessed the prevalence and factors associated with statin treatment in patients meeting criteria for this therapy for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD).
From 2015 to 2018, T1D patients from a tertiary hospital were selected. Inclusion criteria were: ≥40 years-old, diabetic nephropathy, or T1D duration ≥10 years with ≥1 cardiovascular risk factor (CVRF). A standardized cardiovascular risk evaluation protocol was performed. Prevalence of statin treatment was evaluated according to presence of several CVRFs, and multivariable models were constructed to assess independent determinants of statin use.
We included 241 patients (50% women, age 48.2±9.9 years, T1D duration 26.6±9.0 years). Diabetic retinopathy and nephropathy, active smoking, and hypertension were present in 38%, 12%, 28%, and 27%, respectively. Overall, 43% of patients were on statins and 27% had LDL-cholesterol &lt;100mg/dl. Statin users were older, and had higher body mass index (BMI), prevalence of kidney dysfunction, and hypertension (p&lt;0.05 for all). However, among both T1D-related and classical CVRFs, only hypertension (odds ratio [OR], 2.96; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.48-5.91) and BMI (OR, 1.08; CI, 1.01-1.16) were independently associated with statin use in multiple regression analysis.
Less than half of T1D patients from a tertiary hospital who met criteria for statin use were on treatment. Hypertension and BMI emerged as the only CVRFs independently associated with statin therapy. New strategies are needed to better address CVD prevention in this very high-risk population.
To investigate whether high total cholesterol (TC) levels are associated with lateral epicondylitis (LE).
We retrospectively reviewed all patients with LE who presented to our institution between 2011 and 2015. The inclusion criteria were a diagnosis of LE based on clinical history and physical examination findings and age between 40 and 55 years. For healthy controls, we obtained data from a national cohort (sixth Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey) aged between 40 and 55 years. We compared TC levels between the groups, determined the incidence of hypercholesterolemia (TC level ≥ 240 mg/dL) according to the occurrence of LE, and calculated odds ratios for the occurrence of LE. We also evaluated whether cholesterol levels were associated with clinical findings of LE, such as pain level, onset age, symptom duration, and number of corticosteroid injections.
The study comprised 289 patients with LE (mean age, 47.9 years) and 1,077 healthy individuals (mean age, 47.7 years). TC levels were significantly higher in patients with LE than in healthy individuals (205.0 mg/dL vs 194.6 mg/dL, P &lt; .001). The mean difference of 10.4 mg/dL was clinically meaningful because a change of 10 mg/dL with medical intervention is considered significant. The incidence of hypercholesterolemia was higher in LE patients than in healthy controls (16.6% vs 9.0%, P &lt; .001). After adjustment for age, sex, body mass index, and glucose level, patients with hypercholesterolemia (TC level ≥ 240 mg/dL) were 2.47 (95% confidence interval, 1.65-3.70) times more likely to experience LE than those with normal cholesterol levels (&lt;200 mg/dL). TC levels correlated with pain level, onset age, and number of corticosteroid injections.
A clinically meaningful difference in TC levels was found between LE patients and healthy controls. In addition, the incidence of hypercholesterolemia was higher in LE patients than in controls. The present findings suggest a potential association between high TC levels and LE.
Level III, case-control study.
Short bowel syndrome patients (SBS) receiving parenteral nutrition (PN) often have dyslipidaemia and can develop intestinal failure-associated liver disease (IFALD). These patients demonstrate increased cholesterol synthesis and hepatic lipogenesis. These lipid disturbances may be due to a decreased concentration of the bile acid pool or malabsorption. The aim of this pilot study was to evaluate the effect of bile acid administration on lipid synthesis in patients with SBS.
The 24 h fractional synthesis rate (FSR) of cholesterol and triglycerides was measured by the isotopic method (deuterated water) before and after 4 months of ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) treatment (20 mg/kg/day). Five short bowel patients (age: 53.4 ± 19.2 years) who had normal liver function and lipid plasmatic profiles received 1920 ± 300 ml of PN for 151 ± 74 days (mean PN energy intake was 27.0 ± 6.0 kcal/kg body weight, composed with 3.87 ± 1.38 g/kg of carbohydrate, 0.72 ± 0.25 g/kg of fat and 1.10 ± 0.23 g/kg of amino acids). Plasma metabolites, liver enzymes, 7-α-OH-cholesterol and steatosis levels were also evaluated before and after treatment. Student's t-tests were performed, and the results were expressed in means (±SD).
After treatment, decreases in the absolute values of cholesterol synthesis (0.31 ± 0.12 mmol L-1 to 0.24 ± 0.11 mmol L-1; p &lt; 0.05), FSR of cholesterol (31.6 ± 4.7% to 26.4 ± 4.7%; p = 0.06) and FSR of triglycerides (12.8 ± 5.8% to 9.2 ± 5.5%; p &lt; 0.01) were observed. Cholesterol and alanine aminotransferase concentrations also decreased (ALT) (p &lt; 0.05). The absolute values of triglyceride synthesis and triglyceride concentrations remained unchanged.
In SBS patients, UDCA decreases the hepatic synthesis of triglycerides and cholesterol. These results suggest that UDCA could prevent the onset of the IFALD.
This study investigated the effects of freeze-dried jaboticaba peel (FJP) and jaboticaba tea (JE) on obesity parameters of diet-induced obese rats. Thirty-six male Wistar rats were distributed into six groups: AIN-93 M feed a normal control diet; HFF (obese control) feed a high-fat and fructose diet; Prevention FJP (P. FJP) and Treatment FJP (T. FJP) feed HFF diet with 2% of FJP powder, for 12 and 6 weeks respectively; Prevention JE (P. JE) and Treatment JE (T. JE) were feed with HFF diet and the water was substituted by JE, for 12 and 6 weeks, respectively. Lipid profile, glucose, adiponectin and leptin were measured. Glucose and insulin tolerance, also pancreatic islet insulin secretion were determined. Liver morphology and fat liver accumulation were evaluated. Results showed that HFF-diet induced weight gain, dyslipidemia, glucose intolerance, insulin resistance and hepatic steatosis. All FJP and JE treatments reduced weight gain, adiposity and improved insulin sensitivity. Twelve weeks supplementation increased HDL-cholesterol and prevented hepatic steatosis. Our results suggest that FJP and JE act as functional foods, being a dietary strategy to prevent or control obesity. FJP and JE 12 weeks supplementation can modulate important parameters of obesity and insulin metabolism, preventing liver steatosis in obese rats.
Diacylglycerols (DAGs) are interesting oil structuring molecules as they are structurally similar to triacylglycerols (TAGs), but are metabolized differently which results in weight loss and improved blood cholesterol levels upon dietary replacement of TAGs with DAGs. Many commercial products consist of a mixture of monoacylglycerols (MAGs) and DAGs, yet the effect of MAGs on the crystallization behavior of DAGs is still to be unraveled. Two types of commercial MAGs, one originating from hydrogenated palm stearin and one of hydrogenated rapeseed oil, were added in concentrations 1, 2 and 4% to 20% DAGs derived from hydrogenated soybean oil. Using differential scanning calorimetry, it was shown that the presence of MAGs delayed the onset of DAG crystallization. Rheological analysis revealed that MAGs also hindered crystal network development. Synchrotron X-ray diffraction analysis demonstrated that the addition of MAGs suppressed the formation of the β form and stimulated the development of the β' form. Likely, MAGs mainly hindered the crystallization of 1,3-DAGs, which are responsible for the development of the β form, and stimulated the crystallization of the 1,2-DAGs, which can crystallize in the α and β' forms. The presence of two polymorphic forms resulted in a decrease of the crystal network strength, as was derived from oscillatory rheological measurements. This research implies a different effect of monoacylglycerols on both the nucleation and crystal growth of 1,2- and 1,3-DAG isomers. This insight is not only relevant for oleogelation research, but also for emulsifying agents which often contain blends of MAGs, 1,2-DAGs and 1,3-DAGs.
This study presents the effect of raspberry pomace and its grinding level on microbial activity in the gastrointestinal tract as well as on the parameters involved in the regulation of lipid and glucose metabolism in Wistar rats. The nutritional experiment was performed using 24 male Wistar rats, which were divided into 3 groups of 8 animals each. The animals were fed a standard diet (C) or a modified diet containing 7% raspberry pomace subjected to standard (SG) or fine (FG) grinding. Finer grinding increased the concentration of polyphenols and altered the composition of the dietary fibre, thereby affecting the intestinal microbial activity and related mechanisms that regulate systemic parameters. The FG diet considerably increased the level of total ellagitannin metabolites in the colon (23.56 μg/g for SG and 79.54 μg/g for FG) and plasma (0.029 μg/mL for SG and 0.041 μg/mL for FG) and reduced β-glucuronidase and α-glucosidase activity (19.2 and 19.7 for SG and 13.3 and 8.7 μmol/h/g for FG, respectively) and short-chain fatty acid production (55.84 μmol/g for SG and 48.60 μmol/g for FG) in the caecum. Compared to the SG, the FG diet improved the antioxidant capacity of water-soluble substances in plasma (4.34 μg/mL for SG and 4.92 μg/mL for FG). Both diets with raspberry pomaces increased the plasma HDL cholesterol (0.48 mmol/L for C, 0.56 mmol/L for SG, 0.57 mmol/L for FG) and decreased the atherogenic index (AI = (TC-HDL)/HDL: 2.57 for C, 1.98 for SG, 2.00 for FG). The FG diet resulted in the lowest plasma glucose level (10.8 mmol/L for C, 8.2 mmol/L for SG, 7.3 mmol/L for FG). In conclusion, both diets with raspberry pomaces modulated intestinal microbial activity and related systemic parameters; however, FG pomace exhibited greater inhibitory effects than SG pomace in the lower gut environment and glucose metabolism.
The cytochrome P-450 2J2 (CYP2J2) is known to be one of the major enzymes of epoxygenase pathway of arachidonic acid in extrahepatic tissues, which produces series of regioisomeric cis-epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs) such as 5,6-, 8,9-, 11,12-, and 14,15-EETs. In the present study, we analyzed the impact of a genetic variant in CYP2J2 on coronary artery disease (CAD) in the Telangana region of Indian population.
The case-control study consisted of 100 CAD cases and 110 healthy controls. The deoxyribonucleic acid was extracted using the salting out method. Genotyping and gene expression was performed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-restriction fragment length polymorphism and real-time-PCR methods.
In the present study, the percentage of smokers, alcoholics, hypertensive patients, and diabetics was high. Increase in fasting glucose, urea, creatinine, fasting triglycerides, total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C), total cholesterol/high-density lipoprotein (TC/HDL), LDL/HDL, homocysteine, and C-reactive protein levels were significantly higher in patients with CAD than in controls (p &lt; 0.001). CYP2J2 G-50T was associated with CAD (p = 0.04). The mRNA expression of CYP2J2 showed altered gene expression in this study among CAD patients in comparison with control (p = 0.01).
A functionally relevant polymorphism of the CYP2J2 gene was independently associated with an increased risk of CAD.
Raltegravir (RAL) is an HIV-1 integrase strand transfer inhibitor that is well established as a component of highly active antiretroviral therapy regimens for the treatment of adults living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), due to its high virological efficacy and good tolerability profile. To date, limited data are available on the use of RAL with abacavir/lamivudine (ABC/3TC). We investigated retrospectively 62 HIV-1 infected patients managed by three Italian Infectious Diseases Outpatient Departments, including 57 treatment-experienced patients and 5 treatment-naïve patients, treated with ABC/3TC plus RAL. In all five naïve patients (100%), virological suppression was achieved and maintained , while 55 experienced patients (96.5%) maintained viral suppression at the most recent review. In the treatment-experienced patients, we observed a significant decrease in triglyceride levels (p &lt; 0.01), while liver transaminases, renal function and cholesterol levels remained substantially stable. In the 34 treatment-experienced patients who switched from a protease inhibitor (PI)-based regimen, we observed a significant improvement of total cholesterol (p=0.03) and triglyceride (p &lt; 0.01) levels. No significant alterations were found on renal and liver function and serum lipid profile of treatment-naïve patients. Despite the small number of participants, results support the efficacy and safety of ABC/3TC plus RAL, either in treatment-naïve or treatment-experienced patients.
To our knowledge, only a few studies have explored the relationship between the inflammatory potential of diet and serum inflammatory markers in Korean adults. The likely novel aim of this study was to examine the association between the dietary inflammatory index (DII) and serum high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) in a Korean adult population.
A cross-sectional study was conducted using the data set from the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES) 2015. Korean adults ≥19 y of age with hs-CRP values were included in this study. After excluding individuals with missing variables for covariates, the final analytic sample for the study was 3014 adults (1295 men and 1719 women). DII scores were calculated from a 1-d 24-h dietary recall, and hs-CRP was measured using the immunoturbidimetric method. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to calculate adjusted odds ratios (AORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) to test the effect of the DII score on serum hs-CRP as dichotomous (&gt;2 versus ≤2 mg/L).
A significant association was observed between increasing DII scores and elevated hs-CRP. Korean adults in the highest quintile of the DII (indicating the most proinflammatory diet), compared with the lowest quintile of the DII (indicating the most anti-inflammatory diet), had increased odds of having elevated hs-CRP concentrations (&gt;2 mg/L; AOR, 1.70; 95% CI, 1.07-2.69; Ptrend &lt; 0.0001) after controlling for age, sex, education, marital status, alcohol consumption, smoking status, body mass index, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and physical activity.
Higher DII scores were positively associated with elevated hs-CRP levels in Korean adults. Because inflammation affects the risk for cancer, cardiovascular disease, and other inflammation-related conditions, future studies are warranted to examine the effect of the DII on other inflammatory biomarkers and chronic disease outcomes among the Korean population.
Steroidal saponins, one of the most diverse groups of plant-derived natural products, elicit biological and pharmacological activities; however, the genes involved in their biosynthesis and the corresponding biosynthetic pathway in monocotyledon plants remain unclear. This study aimed to identify genes involved in the biosynthesis of steroidal saponins by performing a comparative analysis among transcriptomes of Paris polyphylla var. chinensis (PPC), Ypsilandra thibetica (YT), and Polygonatum kingianum (PK). De novo transcriptome assemblies generated 57,537, 140,420, and 151,773 unigenes from PPC, YT, and PK, respectively, of which 56.54, 47.81, and 44.30% were successfully annotated, respectively. Among the transcriptomes for PPC, YT, and PK, we identified 194, 169, and 131; 17, 14, and 26; and, 80, 122, and 113 unigenes corresponding to terpenoid backbone biosynthesis; sesquiterpenoid and triterpenoid biosynthesis; and, steroid biosynthesis pathways, respectively. These genes are putatively involved in the biosynthesis of cholesterol that is the primary precursor of steroidal saponins. Phylogenetic analyses indicated that lanosterol synthase may be exclusive to dicotyledon plant species, and the cytochrome P450 unigenes were closely related to clusters CYP90B1 and CYP734A1, which are UDP-glycosyltransferases unigenes homologous with the UGT73 family. Thus, unigenes of β-glucosidase may be candidate genes for catalysis of later period modifications of the steroidal saponin skeleton. Our data provide evidence to support the hypothesis that monocotyledons biosynthesize steroidal saponins from cholesterol via the cycloartenol pathway.
Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is characterized by progressive extracellular matrix deposition in the lung parenchyma leading to the destruction of lung structure, respiratory failure and premature death. Recent studies revealed that the pathogenesis of IPF is associated with alterations in the synthesis and the activity of lipids, lipid regulating proteins and cell membrane lipid transporters and receptors in different lung cells. Furthermore, deregulated lipid metabolism was found to contribute to the profibrotic phenotypes of lung fibroblasts and alveolar epithelial cells. Consequently, several pharmacological agents, targeting lipids, lipid mediators, and lipoprotein receptors, was successfully tested in the animal models of lung fibrosis and entered early phase clinical trials. In this review, we highlight new therapeutic options to counteract disturbed lipid hemostasis in the maladaptive lung remodeling.
HIV infection is known to be associated with cardiometabolic abnormalities; here we investigated the progression and causes of these abnormalities. Three groups of participants were recruited: HIV-negative subjects and two groups of treatment-naïve HIV-positive subjects, one group initiating antiretroviral treatment, the other remaining untreated. Intima-media thickness (cIMT) increased in HIV-positive untreated group compared to HIV-negative group, but treatment mitigated the difference. We found no increase in diabetes-related metabolic markers or in the level of inflammation in any of the groups. Total cholesterol, low density lipoprotein cholesterol and apoB levels were lower in HIV-positive groups, while triglyceride and Lp(a) levels did not differ between the groups. We found a statistically significant negative association between viral load and plasma levels of total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, apoA-I and apoB. HIV-positive patients had hypoalphalipoproteinemia at baseline, and we found a redistribution of sub-populations of high density lipoprotein (HDL) particles with increased proportion of smaller HDL in HIV-positive untreated patients, which may result from increased levels of plasma cholesteryl ester transfer protein in this group. HDL functionality declined in the HIV-negative and HIV-positive untreated groups, but not in HIV-positive treated group. We also found differences between HIV-positive and negative groups in plasma abundance of several microRNAs involved in lipid metabolism. Our data support a hypothesis that cardiometabolic abnormalities in HIV infection are caused by HIV and that antiretroviral treatment itself does not influence key cardiometabolic parameters, but mitigates those affected by HIV.
Type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) is a major risk factor for developing tuberculosis (TB). TB-DM comorbidity is expected to pose a serious future health problem due to the alarming rise in global DM incidence. At present, the causal underlying mechanisms linking DM and TB remain unclear. DM is associated with elevated levels of oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL), a pathologically modified lipoprotein which plays a key role during atherosclerosis development through the formation of lipid-loaded foamy macrophages, an event which also occurs during progression of the TB granuloma. We therefore hypothesized that oxLDL could be a common factor connecting DM to TB. To study this, we measured oxLDL levels in plasma samples of healthy controls, TB, DM and TB-DM patients, and subsequently investigated the effect of oxLDL treatment on human macrophage infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). Plasma oxLDL levels were significantly elevated in DM patients and associated with high triglyceride levels in TB-DM. Strikingly, incubation with oxLDL strongly increased macrophage Mtb load compared to native or acetylated LDL (acLDL). Mechanistically, oxLDL -but not acLDL- treatment induced macrophage lysosomal cholesterol accumulation and increased protein levels of lysosomal and autophagy markers, while reducing Mtb colocalization with lysosomes. Importantly, combined treatment of acLDL and intracellular cholesterol transport inhibitor (U18666A) mimicked the oxLDL-induced lysosomal phenotype and impaired macrophage Mtb control, illustrating that the localization of lipid accumulation is critical. Collectively, these results demonstrate that oxLDL could be an important DM-associated TB-risk factor by causing lysosomal dysfunction and impaired control of Mtb infection in human macrophages.

Apolipoprotein L1 (APOL1) genetic variants G1 and G2, compared to the common allele G0, are major risk factors for non-diabetic kidney disease in African descent populations. APOL1 is a minor protein component of HDL, as well as being expressed in podocytes and vascular cells. Reverse cholesterol transport involves the transport of cholesterol to HDL by cellular ATP-binding cassette; ABCA1 and ABCG1 with subsequent delivery from peripheral tissues to the liver. With impaired reverse cholesterol transport, lipid accumulation occurs and macrophages morphologically transform into foam cells, releasing inflammatory factors. We asked whether the APOL1 risk variants alter peripheral cholesterol metabolism and specifically affect macrophage cholesterol efflux. Tissues and bone marrow (BM)-derived monocytes were isolated from wild-type mice (WT) and from BAC/APOL1 transgenic (APOL1-G0, APOL1-G1, and APOL1-G2) mice, which carry a bacterial artificial chromosome that contains the human APOL1 genomic region. Monocytes were differentiated into macrophages using M-CSF, and then polarized into M1 and M2 macrophages. Cholesterol content, cholesterol efflux, and ABCA1 and ABCG1 mRNA expression were measured. Kidney, spleen, and bone marrow-derived macrophages from APOL1-G1 and -G2 mice showed increased cholesterol accumulation and decreased ABCA1 and ABCG1 mRNA levels. BM-derived macrophages from APOL1-G1 and -G2 mice showed significantly reduced cholesterol efflux compared to WT or APOL1-G0 macrophages. Taken together, the evidence suggests that APOL1-G1 and -G2 risk variants impaired reverse cholesterol transport through decreased expression of cholesterol efflux transporters suggesting a possible mechanism to promote macrophage foam cell formation, driving inflammation in the glomerulus and renal interstitium.
Mobile health technologies are low cost, scalable interventions with the potential to promote patient engagement and behavior change. We aimed to test whether a culturally sensitive text messaging intervention supporting secondary prevention improves the control of risk factors in patients with coronary heart disease in China.
In this multicenter, single-blinded randomized controlled trial, 822 patients (mean age, 56.4 [SD, 9.5] years; 14.1% women) with coronary heart disease and without diabetes mellitus from 37 hospitals in China were enrolled between August 2016 and March 2017. In addition to usual care, the control group (n=411) received 2 thank you messages/month; the intervention group (n=411) received 6 text messages/week for 6 months delivered by an automated computerized system. The messages provided educational and motivational information related to disease-specific knowledge, risk factor control, physical activity, and medication adherence. The primary end point was change in systolic blood pressure from baseline to 6 months. Secondary end points included the proportion with systolic blood pressure &lt;140 mm Hg, smoking status, and change in body mass index, LDL-C (low-density lipoprotein cholesterol), and physical activity (assessed using the International Physical Activity Questionnaire). The end points were assessed using analyses of covariance. Follow-up was 99.6%. At 6 months, systolic blood pressure was not significantly lower in the intervention group compared with the control group, with a mean change (SD) of 3.2 (14.3) mm Hg and 2.0 (15.0) mm Hg ( P&gt;0.05) from baseline, respectively (mean net change, -1.3 mm Hg [95% CI, -3.3 to 0.8]; P=0.221). There were no significant differences in the change in LDL-C level, physical activity, body mass index, or smoking status between the 2 groups. Nearly all patients in the intervention group reported the text messages to be useful (96.1%), easy to understand (98.8%), appropriate in frequency (93.8%), and reported being willing to receive future text messages (94.8%).
Text messages supporting secondary prevention among patients with coronary heart disease did not lead to a greater reduction in blood pressure at 6 months. Mobile phone text messaging for secondary prevention was feasible and highly acceptable to patients.

Lipid disturbances following treatment with second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs) represent a major health concern. A previous study determined that early changes of plasma lipid levels ≥ 5% during the first month of treatment with SGAs predicts further lipid worsening and development of dyslipidemia. This current study aimed to determine the proportion of adolescents with early lipid changes ≥ 5% and who develop dyslipidemia during SGA treatment.
Data were obtained from a 1-year longitudinal study ongoing since 2007 including 53 adolescent psychiatric (ICD-10) patients (median age 16.5 years; interquartile range [IQR], 14.8-17.5 years) whose metabolic parameters were monitored prospectively during treatment. Plasma lipid levels (total, low-density lipoprotein, high-density lipoprotein [HDL-C], and non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and fasting triglycerides ) were measured at baseline and after 1, 3, and/or 12 months of SGA treatment.
Half (n = 26; 49%) the adolescents had an early increase of total cholesterol levels by 5% or more during the first month of treatment, and one-third (n = 8/24; 33%) developed new-onset hypercholesterolemia during the first year of treatment. Hypercholesterolemia developed more frequently in female patients (P = .01) and in patients with an early increase of total cholesterol ≥ 5% (P = .02). Finally, patients whose HDL-C levels decreased by ≥ 5% during the first month of treatment had a larger HDL-C worsening after 3 months of treatment as compared with patients with early decrease of HDL-C by &lt; 5% (P = .02).
This study underlines the importance of prospectively monitoring metabolic parameters in adolescents after the introduction of SGAs.
Previous clinical studies have suggested that high polyphenol extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) provides a superior cardioprotective effect compared to low polyphenol olive oil. However, further studies are required to replicate these results in non-Mediterranean populations.
To investigate the effect of high polyphenol EVOO versus low polyphenol olive oil with known polyphenol composition on markers of cardiovascular disease risk in a healthy non-Mediterranean cohort.
In a double-blind randomised cross-over trial, the present study will examine the effect of high polyphenol EVOO versus low polyphenol olive oil in 50 healthy participants. Each intervention phase will be 3 weeks long with a 2-week washout period between each phase. Outcomes to be assessed include HDL cholesterol efflux, oxidised LDL, blood lipids, C-reactive protein, arterial stiffness, blood pressure and cognitive function. Dietary intake, physical activity levels and anthropometry will also be collected.
Because of the rigorous trial design, novel and clinically relevant outcomes, the use of a well-characterised EVOO, and, in contrast to the current literature, the non-Mediterranean study population, the present study will provide a significant contribution to the understanding of the clinical importance of polyphenol intake in the Australian sociocultural context.
We aimed to investigate the comparative cardiovascular benefits of high-dose statin, ezetimibe-statin, and PCSK9 inhibitor-statin treatments in secondary prevention patients.Methods and Results:We selected 12 randomized controlled trials (n=131,978 patients) using PubMed and Embase (inception-June 1, 2018). Subgroup differences were explored by meta-regression and Cochran Q test. The relative effects of high-dose statin, ezetimibe-statin, and PCSK9 inhibitor-statin on major cardiovascular events (MACE), and revascularization were varied and decreased gradually, of which high-dose statin resulted in lower risk of MACE and revascularization than PCSK9 inhibitor-statin per 1 mmol/L reduction of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C): risk ratio (RR) for MACE, 0.86 (95% confidence interval (CI), 0.81-0.90) for high-dose statin, 0.90 (95% CI, 0.83-0.96) for ezetimibe-statin, and 0.94 (95% CI, 0.92-0.96) for PCSK9 inhibitor-statin; RR for revascularization, 0.84 (95% CI, 0.77-0.90) for high-dose statin, 0.91 (95% CI, 0.81-1.00) for ezetimibe-statin, and 0.94 (95% CI, 0.90-0.97) for PCSK9 inhibitor-statin. Similar relative effects of intensive lipid-lowering treatment were also observed in analyses of myocardial infarction and stroke, although no significant difference between groups was identified.
In secondary prevention patients, the relative benefits of high-dose statin, ezetimibe-statin, and PCSK9 inhibitor-statin treatments were varied and decreased gradually, of which high-dose statin was significantly superior to PCSK9 inhibitor-statin for improving MACE and revascularization per 1 mmol/L reduction of LDL-C.
Numerous studies have demonstrated a reduction in cardiovascular events when the low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL) level is decreased by statin therapy. However, despite good control of LDL, cardiovascular events may increase if the triglyceride (TG) level is high. We conducted a long-term comparison of treatment of hypertriglyceridemia with ethyl icosapentate (EPA) vs. omega-3-acid ethyl (EPA+docosahexaenoic acid [DHA]).Methods and Results:Cardiac surgery patients with hypertriglyceridemia were randomized to an EPA group (1.8 g t.i.d.) or an EPA+DHA group (2 g s.i.d.) and observed for 3 years. The primary endpoints were the serum TG level and its percent change. Secondary endpoints included lipid markers, fatty acid parameters, serum creatinine, cystatin-C, oxidized LDL, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, and MACCE. An interview to assess study drug adherence was conducted 6 months after completing the study. TG levels were significantly lower in the EPA+DHA group than in the EPA group. Levels of remnant-like particles-cholesterol, oxidized LDL, and cystatin-C were also significantly lower in the EPA+DHA group than in the EPA group. Compliance with treatment was significantly worse in the EPA group.
Better results were obtained in the EPA+DHA group, but more patients showed poor compliance with treatment in the EPA group, making detailed comparison of the 2 groups difficult. Even so, TG were reduced while EPA and DHA levels were increased in the EPA+DHA group, together with a reduction in oxidative stress and remnant-like particles-cholesterol. Decreased compliance with medication in the EPA group significantly affected the results of this study, clearly indicating the importance of good compliance.
To assess sex-related differences in forearm skin microvascular reactivity to vascular occlusion and cardiovascular health in young healthy women and men.
203 young healthy individuals (67 men/136 women) participated in this study. Post-occlusive reactive hyperemia (PORH) in skin microcirculation following 1', 2' and 3' vascular occlusion period was assessed using laser Doppler flowmetry. Anthropometric parameters, body composition, blood pressure, heart rate and biochemical parameters were measured in all participants. Correlations between PORH and measured parameters were determined by using corresponding tests.
Women had significantly higher forearm PORH following 1', 2' and 3' vascular occlusion than men. Women had lower body mass index and waist-to-hip ratio, but higher fat mass than men. Men had significantly higher blood pressure and lower heart rate than women. Also, women had lower hemoglobin, urea, creatinine and serum uric acid, but higher HDL cholesterol level than men. PORH was negatively associated with waist-to-hip ratio and systolic blood pressure only in women.
Young healthy women exhibit higher skin microvascular reactivity to vascular occlusion compared to age-matched men. Increased systolic blood pressure or central obesity (waist-to-hip ratio) may pose greater risk to young healthy women than men by adversely affecting peripheral microvascular function.
Patients suffering an acute coronary syndrome (ACS) are at increased risk for future cardiovascular events. Effective management of hyperlipidaemia in such patients is essential. We aimed to document the use of lipid-lowering therapy (LLT) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) target achievement in patients hospitalised with an ACS in Thailand.
The Dyslipidemia International Study (DYSIS) II was a multinational, observational study that enrolled patients over 18 years of age who were hospitalised with an ACS in 2013-2014 and survived until discharge. Patients were analysed according to whether or not they were treated with LLT prior to hospital admission. A lipid profile was carried forward from blood taken within the first 24 hours after admission, and attainment of the LDL-C target of &lt;70 mg/dL (1.8 mmol/L) for very high-risk subjects was reported. Details of LLTs were collected. Lipid levels, LLT use and cardiovascular events since discharge were collected at a follow-up interview 4 months later.
A total of 320 ACS patients were enrolled from seven sites across Thailand, 188 (58.8%) of whom were being treated with LLT prior to the acute event. The mean LDL-C levels of the LLT and no LLT patients were 106.2 ± 39.4 mg/dL (2.75 ± 1.02 mmol/L) and 139.8 ± 46.6 mg/dL (3.62 ± 1.21), respectively, with 15.4% and 4.5% having an LDL-C level below 70 mg/dL (1.8 mmol/L). Lipid-lowering therapy consisted mainly of statins, with an atorvastatin-equivalent daily dosage of 17 ± 13 mg/day. At the 4-month follow-up, LDL-C target attainment remained low at 26.7% for the initial LLT group and 24.1% for the no LLT group. Although most patients were being treated with LLT at this point, the dosage was still low (28 ± 16 mg/day) and there was little use of combination therapy.
In this cohort of Thai ACS patients, LDL-C levels were highly elevated, placing them at extreme risk of recurrent adverse cardiovascular events. Lipid-lowering therapy was widely used after the ACS; however, treatment was rarely optimised. Huge improvements are required in the management of hyperlipidaemia in Thailand.
Low serum HDL cholesterol (HDL-C) concentration is a risk factor for cardiovascular diseases and it is influenced by genetic and environmental factors. We hypothesized that genetic variants that decrease serum HDL-C concentrations may interact with nutrient intakes in ways that increase or decrease the risk of cardiovascular disease.
Candidate genetic variants that can lower serum HDL-C concentrations were explored by genome-wide association studies (GWAS), after adjusting for covariates, in the Ansan/Ansung cohort (n = 8842) from KoGES. The best genetic variants were selected and used to form a haplotype. According to the haplotype frequencies of SNPs, they were divided into major allele, heterozygote allele, and minor allele. The association of haplotype with serum HDL-C levels was determined using logistic regression after adjusting for confounding factors. Interaction of the haplotype with nutrient intake was also determined.
PTPN11_rs11066325, RPH3A_rs886477 and OAS3_rs2072134 were selected to modulate serum HDL-C levels from GWAS(P = 1.09E-09, 7.04E-10, and 1.27E-09, respectively). The adjusted odds ratios (ORs) for a decrease in serum HDL-C concentration in the minor-allele group of the haplotype were elevated by 1.534 fold, compared to the major-allele group of the haplotype. Furthermore, the adjusted ORs for serum LDL cholesterol and levels increased by 1.645 in the minor-alleles compared to the major-alleles of the haplotype without a significant change of serum cholesterol levels. Interestingly, the adjusted ORs for serum triglyceride were lower in the minor-alleles than in the major-alleles. The haplotype had a significant interaction with the intake of protein, fat, saturated fatty acids (SAF) and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA; P &lt; 0.05). In particular, the minor alleles of the haplotype decreased serum HDL-C levels compared to the major-alleles in the high intake of protein, fat, SFA, and PUFA, not in the low intake.
People carrying the minor-allele of haplotypes should avoid diets that are high in protein and fat, especially rich in SFA and PUFA.
ABSTRACTIndia has the second largest number of people with type 2 diabetes (T2D) globally. Epidemiological evidence indicates that consumption of white rice is positively associated with T2D risk, while intake of brown rice is inversely associated. Thus, we explored the effect of substituting brown rice for white rice on T2D risk factors among adults in urban South India. A total of 166 overweight (BMI ≥ 23kg/m2) adults aged 25-65 years were enrolled in a randomized cross-over trial in Chennai, India. Interventions were a parboiled brown rice or white rice regimen providing 2 ad libitum meals/day, 6 days/week for 3 months with a 2-week wash-out. Primary outcomes were blood glucose, insulin, HbA1c, insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) and lipids. High-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) was a secondary outcome. We did not observe significant between-group differences for primary outcomes among all participants. However, a significant reduction in HbA1c was observed in the brown rice group among participants with metabolic syndrome (-0.18 (0.08) %) relative to those without metabolic syndrome (0.05 (0.05) %) (p-for-heterogeneity = 0.02). Improvements in HbA1c, total and LDL cholesterol were observed in the brown rice group among participants with a BMI ≥ 25 compared to those with a BMI &amp;lt; 25 (p-for- heterogeneity &amp;lt; 0.05). We observed a smaller increase in hs-CRP in the brown (0.03 (2.12) mg/L) compared to white rice group (0.63 (2.35) mg/L) (p = 0.04). In conclusion, substituting brown rice for white rice showed a potential benefit on HbA1c among participants with metabolic syndrome and an elevated BMI. A small benefit on inflammation was also observed.
There is uncertainty about the relevance of animal foods to the etiology of ischemic heart disease (IHD). We examined meat, fish, dairy products and eggs and risk for IHD in the pan-European EPIC cohort.
A prospective study of 409,885 men and women in nine European countries. Diet was assessed using validated questionnaires, calibrated using 24-hour recalls. Lipids and blood pressure were measured in a subsample. During 12.6 years mean follow up, 7198 participants had a myocardial infarction or died from IHD. The relationships of animal foods with risk were examined using Cox regression with adjustment for other animal foods and relevant covariates.
The hazard ratio (HR) for IHD was 1.19 (95% CI 1.06-1.33) for a 100 g/d increment in intake of red and processed meat, and this remained significant after excluding the first 4 years of follow-up (HR 1.25 [1.09-1.42]). Risk was inversely associated with intakes of yogurt (HR 0.93 [0.89-0.98] per 100 g/d increment), cheese (HR 0.92 [0.86-0.98] per 30 g/d increment) and eggs (HR 0.93 [0.88-0.99] per 20 g/d increment); the associations with yogurt and eggs were attenuated and non-significant after excluding the first 4 years of follow-up. Risk was not significantly associated with intakes of poultry, fish or milk. In analyses modelling dietary substitutions, replacement of 100 kcal/d from red and processed meat with 100 kcal/d from fatty fish, yogurt, cheese or eggs was associated with approximately 20% lower risk of IHD. Consumption of red and processed meat was positively associated with serum non-HDL cholesterol concentration and systolic blood pressure, and consumption of cheese was inversely associated with serum non-HDL cholesterol.
Risk for IHD was positively associated with consumption of red and processed meat, and inversely associated with consumption of yogurt, cheese and eggs, although the associations with yogurt and eggs may be influenced by reverse causation bias. It is not clear whether the associations with red and processed meat and cheese reflect causality, but they were consistent with the associations of these foods with plasma non-HDL cholesterol, and for red and processed meat with systolic blood pressure, which could mediate such effects.
Objective: To elucidate whether metformin could regulate the mRNA expression level of estrogen synthetase and ER in human uterine leiomyoma tissues. Methods: (1) Seventeen pairs of uterine leiomyoma tissues and adjacent myometrium (&gt;2 cm) were collected from patients underwent hysterectomy in Peking University First Hospital between December 2016 and January 2017. Real-time PCR was used to measure the mRNA expression level of estrogen synthetase [including cytochrome P450 cholesterol side chain cleavage enzyme (P450scc), cytochrome P450 17α-hydroxylase (P450c17), 3-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 (3β-HSD-2), 17-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (17β-HSD-1) and aromatase cytochrome P450 (P450arom)] and ER (including ERα and ERβ) in the uterine leiomyoma tissues and adjacent myometrium. (2) Uterine leiomyoma cells derived from uterine leiomyoma tissues were identified by immunocytochemistry method and cultured to the third generation. The treatment groups were cultured with different concentrations of metformin (10, 50 and 100 μmol/L) for 48 hours, and the control group was cultured with deionized water for 48 hours. The mRNA expression level of estrogen synthetase and estrogen receptor subtypes were measured by real-time PCR. Results: (1) P450scc, P450c17, 3β-HSD-2, 17β-HSD-1, P450arom mRNA median expression levels were 112, 4, 13, 42 and 194 in the uterine leiomyoma tissues, and were respectively 114, 5, 11, 32 and 6 in the myometrium. Compared to those of the myometrium, 3β-HSD-2 and P450arom mRNA expression levels in the uterine leiomyoma tissue were significantly higher (P&lt;0.05), while there were no significant change of mRNA expression levels among P450scc, P450c17 and 17β-HSD-1 (P&gt;0.05). ERα and ERβ mRNA median expression levels were 208 and 116 in the uterine leiomyoma tissues, and were 24 and 95 in the myometrium. Compared to that of the myometrium, ERα mRNA level in the uterine leiomyoma tissue was significantly higher (P=0.001), while there were no significant change of ERβ mRNA level (P=0.193). (2) After cultured with different concentrations of metformin (10, 50 and 100 μmol/L), the P450arom mRNA levels in the uterine leiomyoma tissues were 9±4, 8±5 and 8±3 respectively in the treatment groups and was 16±5 in the control group. Compared to that of the control group, P450arom mRNA expression levels in the treatment groups were significantly declined (P&lt;0.05). There were no significant different change of mRNA expression levels among 3β-HSD-2, ERα and ERβ between the treatment groups and the control group (P&gt;0.05). Conclusions: Metformin could down-regulate the mRNA expression level of aromatase in the uterine leiomyoma cells. These results indicate that metformin may inhibit the local estrogen synthesis and therefore suppress the development of uterine leiomyoma.

Statin drugs reduce low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol (LDL-C) and cardiovascular risk. Ezetimibe may be used to supplement statin therapy, or used alone in cases of statin intolerance. Statin-associated side effects do occur, especially muscle symptoms and new onset diabetes, but they do not detract from the benefits of statin therapy. Inhibitors of proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) reduce LDL-C and cardiovascular risk. Evolocumab is subsidised in Australia for patients with familial hypercholesterolaemia when LDL-C is not adequately controlled with maximum doses of statin or ezetimibe or when statin therapy is contraindicated. Fenofibrate reduces triglycerides and cardiovascular risk in patients with type 2 diabetes when triglycerides are elevated and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) is low. A role for dietary omega-3 fatty acids and esters in reducing cardiovascular risk remains controversial. All cases of secondary cardiovascular disease prevention merit intensive lipid therapy, unless a contraindication exists. Lipid therapy is justified in cases of primary prevention when absolute risk is high, especially when lipids are highly elevated or when multiple risk factors are present. Clinical management requires a focus on the predominant lipid disorder present, namely hypercholesterolaemia, hypertriglyceridaemia or combined hyperlipidaemia. There is an ongoing problem of poor long term persistence on lipid therapy, as well as reduced awareness by practitioners of poor risk factor control.
Stage B heart failure (HF) is defined as an asymptomatic abnormality of the heart structure or function. The circulating level of N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) is elevated in symptomatic patients with left ventricular (LV) dysfunction caused by a structural or functional abnormality. This study investigated the association of the NT-proBNP level with echocardiography-detected cardiac structural or diastolic abnormalities in asymptomatic subjects with preserved LV systolic function (ejection fraction &gt;50%).
We retrospectively studied 652 health examinees who underwent echocardiography and an NT-proBNP test at a health-promotion centre in Seoul, between January 2016 and September 2018. The left ventricular mass index (LVMI) and the left atrial dimension (LAD) were used as markers for structural abnormalities, and the mean e' velocity and mitral early flow velocity/early diastolic tissue velocity (E/e') ratio were used as markers for diastolic dysfunction. The plasma NT-proBNP level was measured using electrochemiluminescence immunoassay (DPC Immulite 2000 XPi, Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics, Tarrytown, New York, USA).
Subjects with preclinical structural abnormalities were older and had a higher body mass index (BMI), higher blood pressure, lower high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level, higher NT-proBNP level, and higher E/e' (p&lt;0.05). Multivariate regression analysis indicated that the factors associated with a higher NT-proBNP level were older age, female sex, lower BMI, higher creatinine level, higher LVMI and higher LAD (p&lt;0.01).
Diastolic dysfunction is not associated with higher NT-proBNP levels, whereas preclinical cardiac structural abnormalities, as well as older age, female sex, lower BMI, and higher creatinine level, are associated with higher NT-proBNP levels.
Diatoms are abundant unicellular marine photosynthetic algae that have genetically diversified their physiology and metabolism while adapting to numerous environments. The metabolic repertoire of diatoms presents opportunities to characterise the biosynthesis and production of new and potentially valuable microalgal compounds, including sterols. Sterols of plant origin, known as phytosterols, have been studied for health benefits including demonstrated cholesterol-lowering properties. In this review we summarise sterol diversity, the unique metabolic features of sterol biosynthesis in diatoms, and prospects for the extraction of diatom phytosterols in comparison to existing sources. We also review biotechnological efforts to manipulate diatom biosynthesis, including culture conditions and avenues for the rational engineering of metabolism and cellular regulation.
Studies trying to find the association between vitamin D status and metabolic syndrome (MetS) have led to inconsistent results, and community-based data for individuals living in the Middle East are limited.
To find out if MetS and its components are associated with vitamin D status among female teachers residing in Yazd city during winter 2015.
A total of 276 female teachers (case group, n=124 and control group, n=152) aged 20-60 years were included. Weight, height, waist circumference, blood pressure, daily energy intake, physical activity, serum 25 hydroxy vitamin D (25(OH)D3), fasting blood glucose, triglycerides and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels were assessed. Logistic regression was used to examine the odds ratio of MetS according to vitamin D status.
Mean serum 25(OH)D3 was 32.79±18.62ng/ml and 33.73±20.20, in females with and without MetS, respectively (P&gt;0.142). Compared to those with 25(OH)D3of &lt;20ng/ml, the odds ratio for MetS was 1.01 (95% CI: 0.48-2.13) and 0.95 (95% CI: 0.56-1.60) for those with serum 25(OH)D3 levels of 20-29ng/ml and ≥30ng/ml, respectively (P trend=0.84). The association remained insignificant after adjusting for potential confounders. Furthermore, vitamin D status was not associated with MetS components (P&gt;0.05).
Although several studies have claimed the association between vitamin D status and MetS, we could not find a similar connection in a sample of Iranian female teachers. Prospective studies are needed to determine the possible effect of vitamin D in the development of MetS, particularly in the Yazd province.
Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome (SLOS) is an autosomal recessive disorder. It is due to a deficiency of 7-dehydrocholesterol reductase (DHCR7) that catalyses the reduction of 7-dehydrocholesterol (7-DHC) to cholesterol. The aim of this review is to gather all information, concerning diagnostic characteristics of this syndrome, with an emphasis on intraoral symptom presentation.
We conducted a review of the literature, including articles between 1964 and 2017. Data was collected regarding the clinical diagnosis, pathophysiology and treatment of SLOS patients. Moreover, two clinical cases are described, illustrating the oral and facial anomalies of SLOS patients, at the regional university hospital of Lille, France.
Low cholesterol levels provoke a broad spectrum of clinical presentations, from mild to lethal forms. They can cause mental retardation, growth deficiency and congenital malformations. The SLOS features are often present at birth. Moreover, all the patients have facial anomalies. The dento-maxillofacial symptoms consist of crowded teeth, widely spaced incisors, oligodontia, polydontia, premature tooth eruption, enamel hypoplasia, a bifid uvula, broad alveolar ridges, bifid tongue, and Pierre-Robin syndrome symptoms (glossoptosis, retrognathia and cleft palate). These symptoms are warning signs and should increase the awareness of clinicians.
All healthcare professionals can contribute to the SLOS patient diagnostics. The dento-maxillofacial anomalies, illustrated by two case reports, could help to detect undiagnosed patients. An early detection might improve the outcome of these patients, as cholesterol supplementation can improve symptoms. This study can benefit orthodontists by enabling them to recognize the clinical signs of SLOS in order to refer these young patients to a specialist if the diagnosis has not been established.
Pediatric hypertension has increased in the last decade, and it is thus crucial to identify the factors associated with the development of high blood pressure (BP) and other cardiovascular disorders. The aim of this study was to determine whether there is an association between high BP and sociodemographic and biochemical factors in schoolchildren.
This cross-sectional study included 1201 children and adolescents, between seven and 17 years old, of both sexes. The sociodemographic data analyzed were gender, age, school system and socioeconomic status. Among biochemical indicators, blood glucose, triglycerides, total cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol (HDL-C) and LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C) were assessed. In the analysis of BP, schoolchildren were classified as normal, borderline or hypertensive. Associations were tested using Poisson regression through prevalence ratios (PR).
High BP was identified in 16.2% of the students. In females, the prevalence of high BP was 7% lower than in males (p=0.001), but was higher among adolescents (PR: 1.11, p&lt;0.001) and schoolchildren in the state school system (PR: 1.05; p=0.013). Concerning biochemical indicators, BP change was associated with pre-diabetes (PR: 1.09; p=0.001) and borderline HDL-C (PR: 1.09; p=0.007).
Among the sociodemographic factors associated with high BP are male gender, adolescence and attending the state education system. This condition was also associated with pre-diabetes and borderline HDL-C.
Statin-based treatments reduce cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk in patients with non-dialysis chronic kidney disease (CKD), but it is unclear which regimen is the most cost-effective. We used the Study of Heart and Renal Protection (SHARP) CKD-CVD policy model to evaluate the effect of statins and ezetimibe on quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and health care costs in the United States (US) and the United Kingdom (UK). Net costs below $100,000/QALY (US) or £20,000/QALY (UK) were considered cost-effective. We investigated statin regimens with or without ezetimibe 10 mg. Treatment effects on cardiovascular risk were estimated per 1-mmol/L reduction in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol as reported in the Cholesterol Treatment Trialists' Collaboration meta-analysis, and reductions in LDL cholesterol were estimated for each statin/ezetimibe regimen. In the US, atorvastatin 40 mg ($0.103/day as of January 2019) increased life expectancy by 0.23 to 0.31 QALYs in non-dialysis patients with stages 3B to 5 CKD, at a net cost of $20,300 to $78,200/QALY. Adding ezetimibe 10 mg ($0.203/day) increased life expectancy by an additional 0.05 to 0.07 QALYs, at a net cost of $43,600 to $91,500/QALY. The cost-effectiveness findings and policy implications in the UK were similar. In summary, in patients with non-dialysis-dependent CKD, the evidence suggests that statin/ezetimibe combination therapy is a cost-effective treatment to reduce the risk of CVD.
The advantage of combining molecular and morphological imaging, e.g. positron emission tomography and magnetic resonance imaging (PET/MRI), is reflected in the increased use of these modalities as surrogate end-points in clinical trials. This study aimed at evaluating plaque inflammation using 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG)-PET/MRI, and gene expression in a minipig model of atherosclerosis.
Göttingen Minipigs were fed for 60 weeks with fat/fructose/cholesterol-rich diet (FFC), chow (Control) or FFC-diet changed to chow midway (diet normalization group; DNO). In all groups, 18F-FDG-PET/MRI of the abdominal aorta was assessed midway and at study-end. The aorta was analyzed using histology and gene expression.
At study-end, FFC had significantly higher FDG-uptake compared to Control (target-to-background maximal uptake, TBRMax (95% confidence interval) CITBRMax: 0.092; 7.32) and DNO showed significantly decreased uptake compared to FFC (CITBRMax: -5.94;-0.07). No difference was observed between DNO and Control (CITBRMax: -2.71; 4.11). FFC displayed increased atherosclerosis and gene expression of inflammatory markers, including vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1), cluster of differentiation 68 (CD68), matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9), cathepsin K (CTSK) and secreted phosphoprotein 1 (SPP1) compared to Control and DNO (all, p &lt; 0.05). FDG-uptake correlated with gene expression of inflammatory markers, including CD68, ρs = 0.58; MMP9, ρs = 0.46; SPP1, ρs = 0.44 and CTSK, ρs = 0.49; (p ≤ 0.01 for all).
In a model of atherosclerosis, 18F-FDG-PET/MRI technology allows for detection of inflammation in atherosclerotic plaques, consistent with increased inflammatory gene expression. Our findings corroborate clinical data and are important in pre-clinical drug development targeting plaque inflammation.
Lysosomal acid lipase deficiency (LALD) leads to the accumulation of cholesteryl esters and/or triglycerides (TG) in lysosomes due to the lack of the enzyme codified by the LIPA gene. The most common symptoms are dyslipidaemia and hypertransaminasemia, together with manifestations common to other lysosomal storage disorders (LSDs), including visceromegalies and elevated plasma biomarkers. Alteration of the lipid-liver profile (LLP) has been widely applied as a criterion for LALD screening, but the usefulness of biomarkers has not yet been explored. Our purpose was to explore the utility of plasma chitotriosidase activity (ChT) and CCL18/PARC concentration in addition to LLP to identify LALD patients in an observational retrospective study of two different sample collections.
Biological samples refining: Collection 1 (primary hypercholesterolemia suspected) included unrelated individuals with hyperlipidaemia and without LDLR, APOB and PCSK9 gene mutations (Set 1), and Collection 2 (LSD suspected) included individuals without definitive LSD diagnosis (Set 2). We assessed plasma LLP (total cholesterol and its fractions, TG concentration and transaminases activities), as well as plasma ChT and CCL18/PARC. All subjects with anomalous LLP and/or biomarker levels were LIPA sequenced.
Twenty-four subjects showed altered LLP and/or biomarkers. We identified two LALD patients (one homozygous and one compound heterozygous) and one carrier of a novel LIPA variant.
The measurement of plasma ChT and CCL18/PARC combined with LLP will be a useful approach to identifying LALD patients in retrospective LALD patient studies.
This study investigated the carcass characteristics, physico-chemical properties, storage stability and cholesterol content of meat from goats fed with different levels of naturally-produced lovastatin used to mitigate enteric methane production. Twenty intact Saanen male goats of 5-6 months old with initial live weight of 25.8 ± 4.0 kg were randomly allotted into four dietary treatments containing 0 (Control), 2 (Low), 4 (Medium) and 6 mg (High) per kg live weight (LW) of naturally-produced lovastatin for 12 consecutive weeks. No differences were found in all the parameters measured except for full LW, hot and cold carcass weight, shear force, color and cholesterol content among the treatment groups. Aging had significant effects on all the parameters measured in this study except a* (redness) of meat. Meat samples in the Medium and High treatments were of higher lightness and yellowness, more tender and lower cholesterol levels. We conclude that, in addition to mitigate enteric methane emissions, dietary supplementation of naturally-produced lovastatin at 4 mg/kg LW could be a feasible feeding strategy to produce tender meat containing lower cholesterol.
The replacement of fish oil (FO) with other lipid sources (e.g. animal fats, AF) in aquafeeds improves the sustainability of aquaculture, even though alternatives have different fatty acid (FA) profiles. FO contains a higher proportion of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFAs) than AF. LC-PUFAs have key physiological roles, despite limited biosynthetic capacity in marine fish. Therefore, replacing FO in feeds may limit physiological responses when fish face environmental challenges such as an acute change in salinity. To test this hypothesis, juvenile seabass (62.6 ± 1.6 g, 50 fish/ 500 L tank) were fed three different isoproteic and isolipidic diets in which the replacement levels of FO by AF varied (0%, 75% or 100% AF). Fish were fed the experimental diets at 2% their body weight (BW) daily for 85 days (20.0 ± 1.0 °C; 35‰). Thereafter, half of the fish were transferred to tanks at 15‰ or 35‰ salinity and sampled at 24 h and 72 h. Plasma osmolality, Na+, glucose, cholesterol and lactate levels were altered by the changing salinity, although cortisol remained unchanged. Standard metabolic rate was similar irrespective of the experimental factors. However, maximal metabolic rate decreased by 4-10% in fish subjected to a 15‰ salinity. Intestinal chymotrypsin activity was modified by the diet, with this digestive enzyme along with trypsin showing a two-fold increase in activity at 15‰ salinity. Hepatic lipid peroxidation (LPO) showed a ~1.4-fold increase at 15‰ salinity. Additionally, LPO and glutathione reductase activity were ~1.6-fold higher in fish fed the FO diet. Citrate synthase activity in gills was increased in fish fed the 100% AF diet. Therefore, both dietary replacement of FO by AF and environmental salinity have an impact on the metabolic response of seabass, although interactions between both factors (diet and salinity) are negligible in the metabolic parameters investigated. The results are relevant to the aquaculture industry considering the potential usage of AF to replace FO in aquafeeds and because of the variations in salinity experienced by fish cultured in transitional waters.
Fungal keratitis (FK) is treated by topical natamycin (Nat) which is an effective antifungal agent. However, it has numerous therapeutic limitations i.e. toxicity, tolerance, need of frequent dosing and patient incompliance. The aim of the present study was to develop Nat loaded trimethyl chitosan (TMC) coated mucoadhesive cationic niosomes (Muc-Cat-Nios) for prolonged and effective delivery to eyes. Niosomes were prepared using thin film hydration method and optimized using a Box-Behnken design (BBD) with the help of Design-Expert® Software. Three independent variables were considered: amount of Span 60 (X1), amount of Cholesterol [Chol(X2)] and TMC concentration (X3). The encapsulation efficiency (R1: EE%), vesicle size (R2: VS) and Zeta potential (R3: ZP) were selected as dependent variables or responses. The optimized Nios displayed spherical shape, 1034.14 nm vesicle size and 81.76% EE. Nat loaded niosomes were incubated with TMC to get mucoadhesive cationic vesicular system. Uncoated and TMC coated niosomes were characterized for mucoadhesive properties, in vitro drug release, rheological behaviour, and ex vivo permeation studies. Cationic Nios showed greater mucoadhesive potential that provided drug release for a long period of time. The promising outcomes suggest that natamycin delivery using cationic mucoadhesive niosomes could be employed for improved treatment of fungal keratitis.
This study aimed to investigate how visceral adipose tissue (VAT) and subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) volumes were associated with metabolic risk factors in 7-year-old children.
A total of 81 children (52% girls) from a Swedish birth cohort were studied. At 6 years of age, anthropometric data, fasting insulin, glucose, cholesterol, and blood pressure were collected on 53 children with normal weight and 28 children with overweight or obesity, and insulin resistance was estimated. At 7 years of age, magnetic resonance imaging quantified VAT and SAT. Sex and regression analyses were conducted.
SAT was more strongly associated with metabolic risk factors than VAT. The associations between VAT and metabolic risk factors were stronger in girls (P &lt; 0.05). When VAT was adjusted for birth weight and maternal BMI and education, it accounted for 51% of insulin variance (β = 11.72; P = 0.001) but only in girls. The key finding of this study was that adjusted SAT accounted for 63% of the fasting insulin variance in girls (β = 2.76; P &lt; 0.001). Waist circumference was the best anthropometric marker for insulin resistance.
Insulin resistance was associated with abdominal adipose tissue and its associated metabolic risk factors in children as young as 7 years old.
Stroke is associated with topological disruptions of large-scale functional brain networks. However, whether these disruptions occur in transient ischemic attack (TIA), an important risk factor for stroke, remains largely unknown. Combining multimodal MRI techniques, we systematically examined TIA-related topological alterations of functional brain networks, and tested their reproducibility, structural, and metabolic substrates, associations with clinical risk factors and abilities as diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers. We found that functional networks in patients with TIA exhibited decreased whole-brain network efficiency, reduced nodal centralities in the bilateral insula and basal ganglia, and impaired connectivity of inter-hemispheric communication. These alterations remained largely unchanged when using different brain parcellation schemes or correcting for micro head motion or for regional gray matter volume, cerebral blood flow or hemodynamic lag of BOLD signals in the patients. Moreover, some alterations correlated with the levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (an index related to ischemic attacks via modulation of atherosclerosis) in the patients, distinguished the patients from healthy individuals, and predicted future ischemic attacks in the patients. Collectively, these findings highlight the emergence of characteristic network dysfunctions in TIA, which may aid in elucidating pathological mechanisms and establishing diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers for the disease.
This trial evaluated the individual and interactional effects of diet and type of pregnancy (twin or single) on plasma metabolic response in ewes and their lambs from late pre-partum to late post-partum. Thus, a flock of 18 Ile de France breed sheep, consisting of 8 twin-bearing and 10 single-bearing ewes, were allocated to one of two groups according to their diet, either based on ad libitum naturalized pasture hay (NPH) or red clover hay (RCH), from d 45 pre-partum to d 60 post-partum. Plasma samples were collected at different times to determine albumin, cholesterol, total protein and urea, plus glucose and β-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) concentration in ewes. The data was processed using the lme4 package for R, and SPSS Statistics 23.0 for Windows. The results showed that both diet and type of pregnancy influenced the metabolic profile in ewes, showing an inverse relationship between single- and twin-bearing ewes regarding glucose and especially BHB proportions from pre-partum to birth. During post-partum, higher urea concentrations were observed in twin- and single-bearing ewes fed RCH in contrast to those fed NPH, as a result of the higher-quality forage offered to ewes. Regarding lambs, the diet and type of pregnancy influenced the total protein and urea levels, where an inverse relationship at birth and early post-partum between albumin and cholesterol vs. total protein and urea was detected, reflecting a trend (P value between 0.06 and 0.07) to a better performance by groups of single lambs, especially those from single-bearing ewes fed RCH. Finally, under the conditions of this study, the maternal diet and type of pregnancy influenced the plasma metabolic response in ewes and their lambs, affecting the lamb performance especially at birth.
Undergoing Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) is expected to affect orally administered drug absorption. Statins are commonly prescribed to patients with obesity for the prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases by lowering cholesterol. This is the first longitudinal prospective study on impacts of RYGB on weight loss, pharmacodynamics, and pharmacokinetics of atorvastatin, rosuvastatin, and simvastatin, and their active metabolites, up to 1-year post-surgery.
Forty-six patients were recruited, five patients on atorvastatin, twelve on rosuvastatin, nine on simvastatin, and twenty on no statin. The concentrations of atorvastatin, rosuvastatin, and simvastatin with their active metabolites were monitored.
Mean plasma concentrations of atorvastatin and metabolites and rosuvastatin normalized by the unit dose [(nM)/(mg/kg)] decreased by 3- to 6-month post-surgery. Conversely, simvastatin and its metabolite concentrations increased up to 6-month post-surgery, then declined to preoperative levels by 1-year post-surgery. The metabolisms of atorvastatin to hydroxyl-metabolites and simvastatin to simvastatin acid were decreased after RYGB. The weight loss and PD outcomes were comparable between statin and non-statin groups suggesting the key impacts were from RYGB. The discontinuation or reduction of dose of atorvastatin or rosuvastatin post-RYGB exhibited rebounds of LDL levels in some subjects, but the rebound was not apparent with patients on simvastatin pre-surgery.
Discontinuations of statin dosing post-RYGB require LDL monitoring and reducing the dose to half seems to have better results. Patients on statin treatment post-RYGB should be followed-up closely based on our pharmacokinetic findings, to ensure therapeutic effects of the treatment with minimal adverse effects.
Previous epidemiological studies have suggested a link between high-cholesterol intake and liver disease progression, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the precise mechanism of hepatotoxicity and hepatocarcinogenesis caused by excessive cholesterol consumption remains unclear. We aimed to investigate the impact of dietary cholesterol using hepatitis C virus core gene transgenic (HCVcpTg) mice, which spontaneously developed HCC with age. Male HCVcpTg mice were treated for 15 months with either a control diet or an isocaloric diet containing 1.5% cholesterol, and liver phenotypes and tumor-associated signaling pathways were evaluated. The high-cholesterol diet-fed HCVcpTg mice exhibited a significantly higher incidence of liver tumors compared with the control diet mice (100% vs. 41%, P &lt; 0.001). The diet induced steatohepatitis with pericellular fibrosis and evoked higher mRNA expression of pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic mediators along with enhanced hepatocyte proliferation and greater oxidative and endoplasmic reticulum stress in the liver. Moreover, long-term consumption of cholesterol-rich diet activated nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) and p62/sequestosome 1 (Sqstm1)-nuclear factor erythroid 2 (NRF2) axis, enhanced fibrogenesis, and consequently accelerated hepatic tumorigenesis. In conclusion, these results demonstrate that a high-cholesterol diet facilitates liver tumorigenesis by inducing steatohepatitis, promoting hepatocyte division, and up-regulating cellular stress and pro-inflammatory NF-κB and detoxifying p62/Sqstm1-NRF2 signals. Therefore, high dietary cholesterol should be avoided in HCV-infected patients to prevent development of steatohepatitis, liver fibrosis, and HCC.
We aimed to analyze whether a diet supplemented with a standard dose of copper (Cu) in the form of nanoparticles, as an alternative to carbonate, exerts beneficial effects within the vasculature and improves the blood antioxidant status.
Male Wistar rats were fed for 8 weeks with a diet supplemented with Cu (6.5 mg Cu/kg in the diet) either as nanoparticles (40 nm diameter) or carbonate - the control group. Moreover, a negative control was not supplemented with Cu. At 12 weeks of age, blood samples, internal organs and thoracic aorta were taken for further analysis. Blood antioxidant mechanism was measured together with Cu and Zn.
Diet with Cu as nanoparticles resulted in an elevated catalase activity and ferric reducing ability of plasma, however decreased Cu (plasma), and ceruloplasmin (Cp) compared to carbonate. The participation of vasoconstrictor prostanoid was increased, as indomethacin did not modify the acetylcholine (ACh)-induced response. Arteries from Cu nanoparticle and carbonate rats exhibited a reduced maximal contraction to potassium chloride and an increased response to noradrenaline. The endothelium-dependent vasodilation to ACh was enhanced while exogenous NO donor, sodium nitroprusside, did not modify the vascular response. Down-regulation of BKCa channels influenced hyperpolarizing mechanism. The superoxide dismutase and HDL-cholesterol were decreased opposite to an increased lipid hydroperoxides, malondialdehyde, Cu (plasma and liver) and Cp.
Despite the increased antioxidant capacity in blood of Cu nanoparticle fed rats, vasoconstrictor prostanoids and NO are involved in vascular regulation.
Red blood cell distribution width (RDW) is a parameter measured in blood sample tests that reflects the variation in the volume of erythrocytes and used to differentiate an anemic state. The RDW has been used to predict a poor survival in various types of cancer; however, the prognostic impact of the RDW in resected pathological stage I non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients remains to be elucidated.
A total of 273 patients with resected pathological stage I NSCLC were included in this study. The cut-off value of RDW was set at 14.5, which was the upper limit of the normal range of the RDW. The controlling nutritional status (CONUT) score, which was calculated by the albumin, cholesterol and the lymphocyte count, was also investigated.
Among 273 patients, 34 (12.5%) were RDW-high, while 239 (87.5%) were RDW-low. RDW-high was significantly associated with a lower body mass index (P&lt;0.01), a lower level of hemoglobin (P&lt;0.01), a higher level of C-reactive protein (P&lt;0.01), and a high CONUT score (P=0.03) than RDW-low. Patients with RDW-high exhibited significantly shorter recurrence-free and overall survivals (RFS and OS, respectively) than those with RDW-low (P&lt;0.01 and P&lt;0.01, respectively). Multivariate analyses showed that the RDW was an independent prognostic factor for both the RFS and OS (RFS, hazard ratio [HR]: 2.16, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.14-3.95, P=0.02; OS, HR: 2.44, 95% CI: 1.28-4.49, P&lt;0.01).
The RDW was shown to be associated with a worse long-term prognosis in resected pathological stage I NSCLC patients.
Zinc depletion during diabetes postulates a role for zinc nutrition in the management of associated complications. The present study evaluated zinc supplementation for countering the compromised intestinal integrity through moderation of oxidative stress and suppression of stress-stimulated inflammatory proliferation in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats. Diabetic rats were provided with supplemental zinc for six weeks (5 and 10-times of normal level). Supplemental zinc nurtured diabetic groups evidenced a significant reversal of the disruption of intestinal ultra structure. While the brush border membrane (BBM) of diabetic animals showed decreased fluidity with increased cholesterol: phospholipid ratio and altered polyunsaturated to saturated fatty acid ratio, the same was countered in zinc supplementation. A stimulated activity of BBM-bound enzymes suggested a modulation in membrane dynamics in diabetic condition which was moderated in zinc treatment. Higher expression of the lipid oxidative markers, oxidative stress markers, concomitant inflammatory markers, cytokines, fibrosis factors and apoptotic regulatory proteins in the intestines were curbed by zinc supplementation. The pathological aberrations of the intestinal architecture in diabetic animals were similarly reverted. Thus, supplemental zinc has a favourable consequence in restricting the compromised intestinal health in diabetes which was exerted through a defensive stimulus on oxidative stress induced cytokines, inflammatory propagation, and subsequent injury.
The eukaryotic plasma membrane has an asymmetric distribution of its component lipids. Rafts that result from liquid-liquid phase separation are a feature of its exoplasmic leaflet, but how these exoplasmic leaflet domains are coupled to the cytoplasmic leaflet is not understood. These rafts can be studied in model membranes of three-component mixtures that produce coexisting liquid ordered (Lo) and liquid disordered (Ld) domains. We conducted all-atom molecular dynamics simulations of compositionally asymmetric lipid bilayers that reflect a more realistic model of the plasma membrane. One leaflet contained phase-separated domains with phosphatidylcholine and cholesterol, representing the exoplasmic leaflet, whereas the other contained phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylserine, and cholesterol, which are the predominant components of the cytoplasmic leaflet. Inspired by findings of domain alignment across the two leaflets in compositionally symmetric model membranes, we examined the coupling between the two leaflets to see how the single-phase cytoplasmic leaflet would respond to phase separation in the other leaflet and if information could be communicated across the membrane. We found the region of the single-phase leaflet apposing the Lo domain to be slightly more ordered and thicker than the region apposing the Ld domain. The region across from the Lo domain is somewhat enriched in cholesterol and significantly depleted of polyunsaturated lipids.
The underlying molecular mechanisms associated with alcohol use disorder (AUD) risk have only been partially revealed using traditional approaches such as univariate GWAS and linkage-based analyses. We therefore aimed to identify gene clusters related to EEG neurobiological phenotypes distinctive to individuals with AUD using a multivariate approach.
The current project adopted a bi-multivariate data-driven approach, parallel independent component analysis (para-ICA) to derive and explore significant genotype-phenotype associations in a case-control subset of the Collaborative Study on the Genetics of Alcoholism (COGA) dataset. Para-ICA subjects comprised N=799 self-reported European-Americans (367 controls and 432 AUD cases), recruited from COGA, who had undergone resting EEG and genotyping. Both EEG and genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data were preprocessed prior to being subjected to para-ICA in order to derive genotype-phenotype relationships.
From the data, 4 EEG frequency and 4 SNP components were estimated, with 2 significantly correlated EEG-genetic relationship pairs. The first such pair primarily represented theta activity, negatively correlated to a genetic cluster enriched for (but not limited to) ontologies/disease processes representing cell signaling, neurogenesis, transmembrane drug transportation, alcoholism, and lipid/cholesterol metabolism. The second component pair represented mainly alpha activity, positively correlated with a genetic cluster with ontologies similarly enriched as the first component. Disease-related enrichments for this component revealed heart and autoimmune disorders as top hits. Loading coefficients for both the alpha and theta components were significantly reduced in cases compared to controls.
Our data suggest plausible multifactorial genetic components, primarily enriched for neuronal/synaptic signaling/transmission, immunity and neurogenesis, mediating low-frequency alpha and theta abnormalities in alcohol addiction. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
To determine the longitude lipid profiles in women with and without gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), and to investigate the relationship between lipid disturbances in the 1st trimester and GDM.Blood samples were collected from 1283 normal pregnant women and 300 women with GDM. Serum lipids which include total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TGs), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) were measured and the TG/HDL-C ratio was calculated in the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd trimesters of pregnancy and then we got the longitudinal lipid profiles. We compared the differences of lipid profiles between patients with GDM and normal pregnant women using 2-way repeated measures analysis of variance. Also additional propensity-based subgroup analyses were performed. The logistic regression analysis was used to determine the relationship between the lipid disturbances in the 1st trimester and GDM.TG, TC, LDL-C concentrations, and TG/HDL-C ratio increased progressively throughout pregnancy; while HDL-C amounts increased from the 1st to the 2nd trimester with a slight decrease in the 3rd trimester. The GDM group showed higher TG concentrations, higher TG/HDL-C ratio, and lower HDL-C concentrations throughout pregnancy. There were no significant differences in TC and LDL-C concentrations in the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd trimesters (P &gt; .05), between the GDM group and the control group. Logistic regression analysis showed that maternal age, prepregnancy body mass index (BMI), and TG/HDL ratio in the 1st trimester were associated with an increased risk of GDM.The lipid profile alters significantly in patients with GDM, and maternal age, prepregnancy BMI, and TG/HDL ratio in the 1st trimester were associated with an increased risk of GDM.
Angiopoietin-like 3 protein (ANGPTL3) is an inhibitor of both lipoprotein lipase and endothelial lipase in humans. Population studies indicate a relationship between loss of function mutations in ANGPTL3 and favorable reductions in triglycerides and non-HDL cholesterol. In addition, loss of function mutations are associated with a reduced risk of coronary artery disease. While ANGPTL3's role in human lipid metabolism has yet to be fully clarified, it is unlikely that ANGPTL3 impacts cholesterol uptake via the LDL-receptor, unlike the proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin9 inhibitors. In contrast to other forms of lipid-lowering therapy, ANGPTL3 inhibition may improve insulin sensitivity. The promise of this new therapy, particularly its independence from the LDL-receptor, has prompted the creation of a monoclonal antibody inhibitor; evinacumab. Evinacumab has shown favorable lipid-lowering action in both human and mouse models. Efficacy trials are currently ongoing and will be completed in the near future. In addition, ANGPTL3 inhibition via an antisense oligonucleotide was performed in healthy human subjects, which resulted in a dose-dependent reduction in circulating ANGPTL3 levels and an anti-atherogenic lipid profile. When tested in mouse models, administration of the antisense oligonucleotide caused a reduction in progression of atherosclerosis. Further investigation is required to evaluate the efficacy, safety and net benefit of clinical ANGPTL3 inhibition before it can be accepted into clinical practice.
Anthracycline (doxorubicin) and trastuzumab treatments for cancer patients have been known to cause cardiotoxicity. The current recommendations for prevention of cardiac events from cancer chemotherapies are largely based on opinion. The American Society of Clinical Oncology recommends active screening and prevention of modifiable cardiovascular risk factors. The risk factors are defined as tobacco use, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, alcohol use, obesity and physical inactivity. Beta-adrenergic blockers and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) have been the mainstay of treatment for heart failure patients with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction for many years. This review analyzed the use of beta-adrenergic blockers and ACE inhibitors/ARBs as protection against cardiomyopathy caused by anthracyclines and trastuzumab. Although many more studies are warranted, it was concluded that the addition of a beta-blocker early in the treatment of cancer patients who are undergoing anthracycline or trastuzumab treatment can have beneficial effects in preserving left ventricular ejection fraction and preventing chemotherapy-induced cardiotoxicity. The effects are more apparent in the short term. More studies of the long-term effects are warranted, as are the additive effects of using a beta-blocker and ACE inhibitor/ARB together to prevent chemotherapy-induced cardiotoxicity.
Prior research has demonstrated that the daily experience of negative affect is associated with increased levels of proinflammatory activity as evidenced by higher interleukin-6 among Americans but not among Japanese. This cultural difference may be driven by culturally divergent beliefs about negative affect as a source of threat to self-image versus as natural and integral to life. Here, we examined whether culture may moderate the relationship between negative affect and biological stress responses, with a focus on the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis activity. By using culturally matched surveys of Americans (N = 761) and Japanese (N = 328), we found that negative affect was associated with a flattening of the diurnal cortisol slope among Americans after controlling for demographic variables, personality traits, sleep patterns, and health behaviors. In contrast, the association between negative affect and the HPA axis activity was negligible among Japanese. Moreover, we assessed biological health risk with biomarkers of both inflammation (interleukin-6 and C-reactive protein levels) and cardiovascular function (higher systolic blood pressure and total-to-HDL cholesterol ratio) and found that the relationship between negative affect and increased biological health risk, which was observed only among Americans, was mediated by the flattening of the diurnal cortisol rhythm. These findings suggest that cultural differences in how emotions are construed may make the experience of negative affect more or less stressful and differentially consequential for health.

The nutritional and metabolic status alters the peripheral taste perception and food intake by participating in the modulation of taste information integration. The taste receptors and neuropeptides in the taste buds are the important targets of this modulation process. To explore the effects of nutritional status on the expressions of galanin and its receptors in the taste buds, we compared the mRNA levels of galanin and its specific receptor GalR2 in the taste buds among the high-fat diet induced obese rats (HF), chronically restricted diet rats (CR) and control rats. The high-fat diet, half of chow diet, and normal chow diet were given to HF, CR and control groups for 6 weeks, respectively. The body weight and some metabolic indexes, including blood glucose, triglyceride and cholesterol levels were detected. The mRNA expressions of galanin and its receptors in taste buds were determined using real-time PCR. Results showed that compared with control rats, the body weights, levels of blood glucose and triglyceride were significantly elevated in HF rats; while the mRNA expressions of galanin and GalR2 were dramatically decreased. However, galanin mRNA expression in CR rats was increased to 2.3 times of that in control group. Considering the results obtained from our previous studies, we conclude that the behavioral changes in tasting choice of HF rats may be related to the expressions of galanin and GalR2 in the taste buds. The changes of galanin and GalR2 in taste buds are involved in the peripheral mechanism of nutritional status regulating taste perception and feeding behavior in rats.
Bay leaf, one of the plants in Indonesia that has been shown to have activities to reduce cholesterol in the blood. HMG-CoA Reductase inhibition is one of many mechanisms in lowering the level of cholesterol in the blood. Here, we reported the inhibitory activity of HMG-CoA Reductase of bay leaves ethanol extracts that we suspected to be the mechanism of action of bay leaves in reducing cholesterol in the blood. In this research we also investigated the correlation between the inhibitory activities, the total phenol content and antioxidant activities of bay leaves (Syzygium polianthum) ethanol extracts.
The inhibitory activity of HMG-CoA Reductase was determined kinetically at 340 nm using simvastatin as positive control. In vitro scavenging assays of 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), ferric ion reducing antioxidant power (FRAP), and beta-carotene method were used to determine the antioxidant activities. The total phenolic content was determined by Folin-Ciocalteu's method.
The IC50 of bay leaves ethanolic extract obtained by percolation and soxhlet extraction method towards HMG-CoA Reductase enzyme activity were 49.50 ± 0.700 μg/mL and 15.50 ± 0.707 μg/mL, respectively, while the IC50 of simvastatin was 0.00238 ± 0.00004 μg/mL. The antioxidant activity and total phenolic content of bay leaves ethanolic extract obtained by Soxhlet extraction method was higher compared to the percolation method (DPPH and beta-carotene assay results). The 3D linear analysis showed that there was a high correlation between the inhibition activities of HMG-CoA Reductase pattern of both extract types and the total phenol pattern and also the antioxidant pattern of these extracts.
The result showed that the bay leaves ethanolic extract have a potent activity to reduce the cholesterol serum level by inhibition of HMG-CoA Reductase activity. The activity was due to the phenolic compounds in the extracts as well as the antioxidant activity of the extracts.
The present study aims to assess the effects of zinc supplementation on metabolic parameters in patients with type 2 diabetes. A literature search was conducted in PubMedTM, Google ScholarTM, and ScopusTM up to March 2018. Twenty randomized controlled trials met the predefined inclusion criteria and were included in the meta-analysis. Weighted mean difference (WMD) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated for net changes in glycemic indices including fasting blood glucose (FBG) and hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), and in lipid markers including total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c), and high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-c). Subgroup analyses were performed based on intervention and study quality. Compared to controls, zinc supplementation significantly reduced the concentrations of both FBG and HbA1c (FBG WMD: -19.66 mg/dL, 95% CI: -33.71, -5.62; HbA1c WMD: -0.43 mg/dL, 95% CI: -0.80, -0.07). The pooled estimate showed a significant decrease in serum TC and LDL-c, and increase in serum HDL-c levels in treatment group compared with the control group (TC WMD: -18.51 mg/dL, 95% CI: -21.36, -15.66; LDL-c WMD: -4.80 mg/dL, 95% CI: -6.07, -3.53; HDL-c WMD: 1.45 mg/dL, 95% CI: 1.40, 1.51). Subgroup analysis of "no co-supplement" intervention demonstrated significant differences for mean changes in HDL-c and FBG levels, whereas subgroup analysis of high quality studies showed significant differences for mean changes of LDL-c, HDL-c, and FBG levels. Results suggested that zinc supplementation reduces FBG, HbA1c and LDL-c levels and increases HDL-C levels; however, these changes were related to intervention and quality of studies.
Despite several studies examining single dietary fats on type 2 diabetes (T2D) incidence, little is known about the effects of multiple fatty acids on the risk of T2D. We aimed to address this question in the Tehran Lipid and Glucose Study (TLGS) population. Dietary intakes of participants without T2D (n=2,139) were assessed using the validated food frequency questionnaire. To assess the risk of T2D after 6 years of follow-up, we used multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression models. Three major dietary fat patterns were: (1) high amounts of dietary cholesterol, saturated fats, oleic acid, linoleic acid, linolenic acid, and trans fats; (2) high amounts of long-chain polyunsaturated fats; and (3) high amounts of dietary cholesterol and saturated fats. Dietary total fat intake hazard ratio [HR=1.31, 95% confidence interval (CI)=0.77~2.23 and HR=0.69, 95% CI=0.27~1.76, in the second and third tertile, respectively] was not related to the development of T2D. Animal- and plant-based dietary fat intakes were additionally not related to the risk of T2D. After adjustment for confounding variables, there was no significant association between dietary fat pattern score and T2D incidence. Whereas, the third pattern had a borderline negative association with diabetes development (HR=0.56, 95% CI=0.29~1.07). These novel data suggest that dietary fat composition may modify the risk of T2D incidence.
Previous studies indicated that a high proportion of adults with diabetes do not receive recommended preventive care in the United States. Nevertheless, a comprehensive evaluation of the factors associated with the receipt of most recommended preventive care measures collectively is lacking. Therefore, this study describes the utilization of multiple preventive care measures collectively. Moreover, this paper aims to identify factors associated with receiving the recommended preventive care. A cross-sectional study design was implemented using data from multiple panels (2009-2015) of the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey. The sample included adults aged 21 years or older with diabetes (n = 8415). The outcome for this study was either receiving five selected preventive care measures (HbA1c tests, cholesterol tests, foot examinations, dilated eye examinations, and influenza vaccines) collectively or not. Multivariable logistic regressions were performed among all adults with diabetes, those with multimorbidity, chronic kidney disease (CKD) or eye complications. Adults with diabetes were poorly adherent to receiving the five preventive care measures collectively (15.6%). Among all adults with diabetes, factors associated with receiving all the selected preventive practices included age, education, health insurance, prescription drug coverage, duration of diabetes, number of chronic conditions and smoking status. Similar results were observed among adults with multimorbidity. Among adults with CKD, those with private insurance and drug prescription coverage were more likely to receive the recommended practices. The findings suggest low adherence to receiving all five recommended practices. It is crucial to increase the awareness about the need for all the recommended practices among adults with diabetes.
Gene-diet interaction studies have reported that individual variations in phenotypic traits may be due to variations in individual diet. Our study aimed to evaluate (i) the association of ADRB2 rs1042713 with obesity and obesity-related metabolic parameters and (ii) the effect of dietary nutrients on these associations in Malaysian adults. ADRB2 genotyping, dietary, physical activity, anthropometric, and biochemical data were collected from 79 obese and 99 nonobese individuals. Logistic regression revealed no association between ADRB2 rs1042713 and obesity (p=0.725). However, the carriers of G allele (AG + GG genotypes) of rs1042713 were associated with increased odds of insulin resistance, 2.83 (CI = 1.04-7.70, adjusted p=0.042), in the dominant model, even after adjusting for potential confounders. Obese individuals carrying the G allele were associated with higher total cholesterol (p=0.011), LDL cholesterol levels (p=0.008), and total cholesterol/HDL cholesterol ratio (p=0.048), compared to the noncarriers (AA), even after adjusting for potential confounders. Irrespective of obesity, the carriers of GG genotype had significantly lower fasting glucose levels with low saturated fatty acid intake (&lt;7.3% of TE/day) (4.92 ± 0.1 mmol/L vs 5.80 ± 0.3 mmol/L, p=0.011) and high intake of polyunsaturated fatty acid:saturated fatty acid ratio (≥0.8/day) (4.83 ± 0.1 mmol/L vs 5.93 ± 0.4 mmol/L, p=0.006). Moreover, the carriers of GG genotype with high polyunsaturated fatty acid intake (≥6% of TE/day) had significantly lower HOMA-IR (1.5 ± 0.3 vs 3.0 ± 0.7, p=0.026) and fasting insulin levels (6.8 ± 1.6 µU/mL vs 11.4 ± 2.1 µU/mL, p=0.036). These effects were not found in the noncarriers (AA). In conclusion, G allele carriers of ADRB2 rs1042713 were associated with increased odds of insulin resistance. Obese individuals carrying G allele were compromised with higher blood lipid levels. Although it is premature to report gene-diet interaction on the regulation of glucose and insulin levels in Malaysians, we suggest that higher quantity of PUFA-rich food sources in regular diet may benefit overweight and obese Malaysian adults metabolically. Large-scale studies are required to replicate and confirm the current findings in the Malaysian population.
Weight loss is the cornerstone of NAFLD management, but weight maintenance is difficult. Some studies have suggested that n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (n-3 PUFA) might have beneficial effects in NAFLD. We aim to compare the effects of a low-energy diet with n-3 PUFA supplementation on liver enzymes, body composition, and cardiometabolic risk factors in NAFLD.
The study was a randomized controlled trial conducted in Urmia in Iran from October 2016 to May 2017. One hundred and fourteen eligible patients were randomly assigned to one of the three following groups: low-energy diet group, n-3 PUFA supplementation (fish oil) group (1500 mg/d), or control group for 12 weeks. Liver enzymes, lipid profile, insulin resistance, and body composition were assessed before and after the intervention.
One hundred and four patients completed the study. All groups lost weight, but the reductions were greater in the diet group (-2.97 ± 2.79 kg, P = 0.001). The diet group had significant decreases in fat mass compared to other groups. Insulin resistance, total cholesterol, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol significantly decreased only in the diet group, and patients who lost weight ≥4% showed significantly larger decreases in serum liver enzymes. N-3 PUFA had no beneficial effects on the study outcomes.
We found that 1500 mg/d n-3 PUFA supplied for 12 weeks, in contrast to 3.40 ± 2.98% weight loss, does not improve liver enzymes, body composition, and cardiometabolic risk factors in NAFLD patients.
This study determined impacts of dietary methionine concentrations at two temperatures on growth, feeding efficiency and N-metabolites in juvenile cobia. Methionine concentrations of the experimental diets were deficient (M9; 9 g/kg), sufficient (M12; 12 g/kg) and surplus (M16, 16 g/kg). Water temperature was normal (30°C) or elevated (34°C). Twenty cobia in triplicate tanks were fed the experimental diets for 6 weeks. Both methionine and temperature affected cobia's growth and feeding efficiency. Cobia fed M9 performed lower than the fish fed M12 and M16 diets. Additionally, cobia reared at 34°C performed poorer than at 30°C, probably due to lower voluntary feed intake in the fish reared at 34°C. Protein efficiency ratio and protein productive value in cobia fed M9 diet were less than M12 or M16 diets. This was confirmed with the improved retentions of indispensable amino acids (AAs). No interactions between methionine and temperature were observed in growth and protein accretion. At 30°C, CF improved, while HSI and VSI declined upon methionine supplementation levels. Of which an interaction between temperature and methionine was present. Plasma, muscle and liver free AA and N-metabolites were affected by methionine and temperature. Furthermore, temperature affected cobia's lipid class composition, resulting in increased phospholipids and cholesterol at 34°C.
Bauhinia L. species, including Bauhinia holophylla (Bong.) Steud. (Fabaceae), have traditionally been used to treat diabetes. Bauhinia is a complex botanical genus, and the indiscriminate use of the diverse Bauhinia species is reflected in the experimental divergence of their medicinal potential.
The hypoglycaemic and hypolipidaemic effects, molecular mechanism of action and phytochemical properties of an authentic extract of B. holophylla leaves were evaluated.
A phytochemical study of a 70% EtOH extract was performed using FIA-ESI-IT-MS/MSn and HPLC-PAD-ESI-IT-MS. The extract (200 or 400 mg/kg b.w.) was administered for 14 days to streptozotocin-induced diabetic Swiss mice. Glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity, blood parameters, gene and protein expression, and the in vivo and in vitro inhibition of intestinal glucosidases were assessed.
HPLC-PAD-ESI-IT-MS analysis identified flavonoid derivatives of quercetin, myricetin, luteolin and kaempferol. Treatment with 400 mg/kg of the extract reduced blood glucose (269.0 ± 32.4 mg/dL vs. 468.0 ± 32.2 mg/dL for diabetic animals), improved glucose tolerance, decreased cholesterol and triglyceride levels, and increased the mRNA expression of proteins involved in glucogenesis in the liver and muscle, such as PI3-K/Akt, GS, GSK3-β (ser-9), AMPK and Glut4. The activity of intestinal maltase was inhibited in vitro (IC50: 43.0 µg/mL for the extract compared to 516.4 µg/mL for acarbose) and in vivo.
Treatment with B. holophylla was associated with a marked hypoglycaemic effect through the stimulation of glycogenesis and inhibition of gluconeogenesis and intestinal glucose absorption, without increasing basal insulinaemia.
Recent studies have highlighted the correlation between diabetes and pancreatic fat infiltration. However, pancreatic fat content (PFC) is rarely confirmed by pathological results, and a change of PFC during progression of type 2 diabetes (T2DM) is currently controversial.
To evaluate the relationship of MRI-pancreatic proton density fat fraction to serologic changes and histology in an experimental model of diabetes.
Prospective animal study.
Thirteen Bama pigs were randomly assigned to diabetes (n = 7) or control (n = 6) groups. Pigs in the diabetic group received high-fat/high-sugar feed, combined with three doses of streptozotocin injections.
3.0T, IDEAL-IQ sequence.
Starting in the fifth month, biochemical changes were evaluated; all pigs underwent axial MRI with the IDEAL-IQ sequence to measured pancreatic fat fraction (PFF). PFC was measured by the Soxhlet extraction method. Pancreatic fat distribution and pancreas islet morphology were observed by histopathology.
A Mann-Whitney U-test, independent-samples t-test, Pearson correlation, Spearman correlation, single-measure intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) were performed.
During the development of T2DM, the PFF, weight, fasting blood glucose (FBG), triglyceride (TG), total cholesterol (TCHO), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), and HOMA-IR (insulin resistance) of the experimental group showed an upward trend; fasting insulin (INS), high-density lipoprotein (HDL), and HOMA-β showed decreasing trends. At the end of the fifteenth month, FBG (mmol/L) was 18.06 ± 6.03 and 5.06 ± 1.41 (P &lt; 0.001), PFF (%) was 36.52 ± 4.07 and 27.75 ± 3.73 (P = 0.002), INS (mU/L) was 21.59 ± 2.93 and 29.32 ± 3.27 (P = 0.001), HOMA-IR was 16.83 ± 4.22 and 6.70 ± 2.45 (P &lt; 0.001), HOMA-β was 1.50 ± 0.24 and 2.77 ± 0.45 (P &lt; 0.001), between the experimental and control groups. There were strong and moderate positive correlations between PFF and PFC (r = 0.968, P &lt; 0.001), and FBG (r = 0.657, P = 0.015), and HOMA-IR (r = 0.608, P = 0.028).
MRI-proton density fat fraction can measure the fat content of the pancreas with great accuracy and repeatability; PFF is a potential biomarker that can reflect the different stages of diabetes development.

Breast cancer is a leading cause of cancer mortality in developed countries. We performed a meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials to investigate the effect of metformin on biomarkers associated with breast cancer outcomes and to explore the dose-response relationship.
A systematic search was performed from onset of the database to January 2019 in MEDLINE/PubMed, SCOPUS, and Cochrane library to identify randomized clinical trials investigating the impact of metformin on insulin, glucose, CRP, leptin, body mass indices (BMI), cholesterol, Ki-67, and Homeostatic Model Assessment for Insulin-Resistance (HOMA-IR). Effect sizes were expressed as weighted mean difference (WMD) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) using a random-effects models.
Nine studies providing 1,363 participants were included in the meta-analysis. Pooled results showed a significant reduction in insulin (WMD: - 0.99 U/ml, 95% CI - 1.66, - 0.33), glucose (WMD: - 1.78 ml/dl, 95% CI - 2.96, - 0.60), CRP (WMD: - 0.60 mg/l, 95% CI - 0.88, - 0.33), HOMA-IR (WMD: - 0.45, 95% CI - 0.77, - 0.11), leptin (WMD: - 2.44 ng/ml, 95% CI - 3.28, - 1.61), BMI (WMD: - 0.55 kg/m2, 95% CI - 1.00, - 0.11), and Ki-67 (WMD: - 4.06, 95% CI - 7.59, - 0.54). Results of the subgroup analyses showed that insulin, glucose, and BMI decreased more significantly when the duration of administering metformin intervention was above 4 weeks. We did not observe non-linear changes in the dose-response relationship between metformin and biomarkers as outcomes.
Breast cancer patients receiving metformin as treatment for diabetes showed significant reduction in levels of insulin, fasting glucose, CRP, HOMA, leptin, BMI, and Ki-67.
Certain plant foods (nuts and soy protein) and food components (viscous fibers and plant sterols) have been permitted by the FDA to carry a heart health claim based on their cholesterol-lowering ability. The FDA is currently considering revoking the heart health claim for soy protein due to a perceived lack of consistent LDL cholesterol reduction in randomized controlled trials.
We performed a meta-analysis of the 46 controlled trials on which the FDA will base its decision to revoke the heart health claim for soy protein.
We included the 46 trials on adult men and women, with baseline circulating LDL cholesterol concentrations ranging from 110 to 201 mg/dL, as identified by the FDA, that studied the effects of soy protein on LDL cholesterol and total cholesterol (TC) compared with non-soy protein. Two independent reviewers extracted relevant data. Data were pooled by the generic inverse variance method with a random effects model and expressed as mean differences with 95% CI. Heterogeneity was assessed and quantified.
Of the 46 trials identified by the FDA, 43 provided data for meta-analyses. Of these, 41 provided data for LDL cholesterol, and all 43 provided data for TC. Soy protein at a median dose of 25 g/d during a median follow-up of 6 wk decreased LDL cholesterol by 4.76 mg/dL (95% CI: -6.71, -2.80 mg/dL, P &lt; 0.0001; I2 = 55%, P &lt; 0.0001) and decreased TC by 6.41 mg/dL (95% CI: -9.30, -3.52 mg/dL, P &lt; 0.0001; I2 = 74%, P &lt; 0.0001) compared with non-soy protein controls. There was no dose-response effect or evidence of publication bias for either outcome. Inspection of the individual trial estimates indicated most trials (∼75%) showed a reduction in LDL cholesterol (range: -0.77 to -58.60 mg/dL), although only a minority of these were individually statistically significant.
Soy protein significantly reduced LDL cholesterol by approximately 3-4% in adults. Our data support the advice given to the general public internationally to increase plant protein intake. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT03468127.
Household food insecurity (HFI) is a stressor that is associated with type 2 diabetes (T2D). However, little is known about HFI and the insulin resistance (IR) underlying T2D, and the mechanisms involved.
We examined the cross-sectional association between HFI and IR among low-income Latinos with T2D and tested whether inflammation and stress hormones mediated this association.
HFI was measured with the 6-item US Household Food Security Survey module. IR was calculated from fasting plasma blood glucose and serum insulin. Inflammation was indicated by high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), and stress hormones included urinary cortisol, metanephrine, and normetanephrine. To test for an indirect effect of HFI on homeostasis model assessment of IR, a parallel multiple mediation model was run with biological markers that significantly differed between food security status-entered as mediators in the model. We used 95% bias-corrected bootstrap CIs, with 10,000 bootstrap samples, to assess the significance of the indirect effects.
The 121 participants with T2D were primarily Puerto Rican (85.8%), aged mean = 60.7 y, and 74% were female. Eighty-two (68%) were classified as food insecure. Compared with food-secure individuals, food-insecure individuals had a significantly higher IR [mean difference (Δ) = 7.21, P = 0.001], insulin (Δ = 9.7, P = 0.019), glucose (Δ = 41, P &lt; 0.001), hsCRP (Δ = 0.8, P = 0.008), cortisol (Δ = 21, P = 0.045), and total cholesterol (Δ = 29, P = 0.004). Groups did not differ on other lipids, metanephrine, normetanephrine, or A1c. The mediation model showed a significant direct effect of HFI on hsCRP (P = 0.020) and on cortisol (P = 0.011). There was a direct effect of cortisol (P = 0.013), hsCRP (P = 0.044), and HFI on IR (P = 0.015). The total combined indirect effect of HFI through cortisol and hsCRP indicated partial mediation.
Among Latinos with T2D, HFI is associated with IR partially through inflammation and stress hormones. Interventions to ameliorate HFI and mitigate its effects on inflammation, stress, and IR are warranted. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT01578096.
Pinto beans contain multiple active agents such as polyphenols, flavonoids, and saponins, and have been shown to lower cholesterol, but the mechanisms involved in this effect have not been explored.
This study was to investigate the changes in cholesterol metabolism in response to whole pinto beans (wPB) and their hulls (hPB) supplemented into a diet rich in saturated fat and the molecular mechanisms potentially responsible for these effects in hamsters.
Forty-four 9-wk-old male Golden Syrian hamsters were randomly assigned to 4 diet groups (n = 11), including a 5% (wt:wt) fat diet [normal-fat diet (NF)], a 15% (wt:wt) fat diet [diet rich in saturated fat (HSF), saturated fatty acids accounted for 70% of total fatty acids], or HSF supplemented with 5% (wt:wt) wPB or 0.5% (wt:wt) hPB for 4 wk. Plasma, liver, intestinal, and fecal samples were collected to evaluate multiple cholesterol markers and gene targets.
The plasma non-high-density lipoprotein (non-HDL) concentration was significantly reduced in the wPB- and hPB-supplemented groups by 31.9 ± 3.5% and 53.6 ± 3.2%, respectively, compared with the HSF group (P &lt; 0.01), to concentrations comparable with the NF group. The wPB-supplemented hamsters had significantly lower liver cholesterol (45.1%, P &lt; 0.001) and higher fecal cholesterol concentrations (94.8%, P = 0.001) than those fed the HSF. The expressions of hepatic 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA reductase (Hmgcr) and small intestinal acyl-coenzyme A: cholesterol acyltransferase 2 (Acat2) were significantly decreased in animals administered wPB (by 89.1% and 63.8%, respectively) and hPB (by 72.9% and 47.7%, respectively) compared with their HSF-fed counterparts (P &lt; 0.05). The wPB normalized the expression of Acat2 to the level of the NF group.
Pinto beans remediated high cholesterol induced by HSF in male hamsters by decreasing hepatic cholesterol synthesis and intestinal cholesterol absorption, effects which were partially exerted by the hulls.
Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a positive-strand RNA virus that primarily infects human hepatocytes. Infections with HCV constitute a global health problem, with 180 million people currently chronically infected. Recent studies have reported that cholesterol 25-hydroxylase (CH25H) is expressed as an interferon-stimulated gene and mediates antiviral activities against different enveloped viruses through the production of 25-hydroxycholesterol (25HC). However, the intrinsic regulation of human CH25H (hCH25H) expression within the liver as well as its mechanistic effects on HCV infectivity remain elusive. In this study, we characterized the expression of hCH25H using liver biopsies and primary human hepatocytes. In addition, the antiviral properties of this protein and its enzymatic product, 25HC, were further characterized against HCV in tissue culture. Levels of hCH25H messenger RNA were significantly up-regulated both in HCV-positive liver biopsies and in HCV-infected primary human hepatocytes. The expression of hCH25H in primary human hepatocytes was primarily and transiently induced by type I interferon. Transient expression of hCH25H in human hepatoma cells restricted HCV infection in a genotype-independent manner. This inhibition required the enzymatic activity of CH25H. We observed an inhibition of viral membrane fusion during the entry process by 25HC, which was not due to a virucidal effect. Yet the primary effect by 25HC on HCV was at the level of RNA replication, which was observed using subgenomic replicons of two different genotypes. Further analysis using electron microscopy revealed that 25HC inhibited formation of the membranous web, the HCV replication factory, independent of RNA replication.
Infection with HCV causes up-regulation of interferon-inducible CH25H in vivo, and its product, 25HC, restricts HCV primarily at the level of RNA replication by preventing formation of the viral replication factory.
Hepatitis C virus (HCV), a single-stranded positive-sense RNA virus of the Flaviviridae family, causes chronic liver diseases, including hepatitis, cirrhosis, and cancer. HCV infection is critically dependent on host lipid metabolism, which contributes to all stages of the viral life cycle, including virus entry, replication, assembly, and release. 25-Hydroxycholesterol (25HC) plays a critical role in regulating lipid metabolism, modulating immune responses, and suppressing viral pathogens. In this study, we showed that 25HC and its synthesizing enzyme cholesterol 25-hydroxylase (CH25H) efficiently inhibit HCV infection at a postentry stage. CH25H inhibits HCV infection by suppressing the maturation of SREBPs, critical transcription factors for host lipid biosynthesis. Interestingly, CH25H is upregulated upon poly(I · C) treatment or HCV infection in hepatocytes, which triggers type I and III interferon responses, suggesting that the CH25H induction constitutes a part of host innate immune response. To our surprise, in contrast to studies in mice, CH25H is not induced by interferons in human cells and knockdown of STAT-1 has no effect on the induction of CH25H, suggesting CH25H is not an interferon-stimulated gene in humans but rather represents a primary and direct host response to viral infection. Finally, knockdown of CH25H in human hepatocytes significantly increases HCV infection. In summary, our results demonstrate that CH25H constitutes a primary innate response against HCV infection through regulating host lipid metabolism. Manipulation of CH25H expression and function should provide a new strategy for anti-HCV therapeutics.
Recent studies have expanded the critical roles of oxysterols in regulating immune response and antagonizing viral pathogens. Here, we showed that one of the oxysterols, 25HC and its synthesizing enzyme CH25H efficiently inhibit HCV infection at a postentry stage via suppressing the maturation of transcription factor SREBPs that regulate lipid biosynthesis. Furthermore, we found that CH25H expression is upregulated upon poly(I·C) stimulation or HCV infection, suggesting CH25H induction constitutes a part of host innate immune response. Interestingly, in contrast to studies in mice showing that ch25h is an interferon-stimulated gene, CH25H cannot be induced by interferons in human cells but rather represents a primary and direct host response to viral infection. Our studies demonstrate that the induction of CH25H represents an important host innate response against virus infection and highlight the role of lipid effectors in host antiviral strategy.
Interferons (IFNs) play a central role in immunity and emerging evidence suggests that IFN-signalling coordinately regulates sterol biosynthesis in macrophages, via Sterol Regulatory Element-Binding Protein (SREBP) dependent and independent pathways. However, the precise mechanisms and kinetic steps by which IFN controls sterol biosynthesis are as yet not fully understood. Here, we elucidate the molecular circuitry governing how IFN controls the first regulated step in the mevalonate-sterol pathway, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase (HMGCR), through the synthesis of 25-Hydroxycholesterol (25-HC) from cholesterol by the IFN-inducible Cholesterol-25-Hydroxylase (CH25H). We show for the first 30-min of IFN stimulation of macrophages the rate of de novo synthesis of the Ch25h transcript is markedly increased but by 120-min becomes transcriptionally curtailed, coincident with induction of the Activating Transcription Factor 3 (ATF3) repressor. We demonstrate ATF3 induction by Toll-like receptors is strictly dependent on IFN-signalling. While the SREBP-pathway dependent rates of de novo transcription of Hmgcr are relatively unchanged in the first 90-min of IFN treatment, we find HMGCR enzyme levels undergo a rapid proteasomal-mediated degradation, defining a previously unappreciated SREBP-independent mechanism for IFN-action. These events precede a sustained marked reduction in Hmgcr RNA levels involving SREBP-dependent mechanisms. We demonstrate that HMGCR proteasomal-degradation by IFN strictly requires the synthesis of endogenous 25-HC and functionally couples HMGCR to CH25H to coordinately suppress sterol biosynthesis. In conclusion, we quantitatively delineate proteomic and transcriptional levels of IFN-mediated control of HMGCR, the primary enzymatic step of the mevalonate-sterol biosynthesis pathway, providing a foundational framework for mathematically modelling the therapeutic outcome of immune-metabolic pathways. 
Cholesterol 25-hydroxylase (CH25H) as an interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) has recently been shown to exert broad antiviral activity through the production of 25-hydroxycholesterol (25HC), which is believed to inhibit the virus-cell membrane fusion during viral entry. However, little is known about the function of CH25H on HCV infection and replication and whether antiviral function of CH25H is exclusively mediated by 25HC. In the present study, we have found that although 25HC produced by CH25H can inhibit HCV replication, CH25H mutants lacking the hydroxylase activity still carry the antiviral activity against HCV but not other viruses such as MHV-68. Further studies have revealed that CH25H can interact with the NS5A protein of HCV and inhibit its dimer formation, which is essential for HCV replication. Thus, our work has uncovered a novel mechanism by which CH25H restricts HCV replication, suggesting that CH25H inhibits viral infection through both 25HC-dependent and independent events. 
Perturbation of steroids pathways is linked to inflammation and chronic diseases, however the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Oxysterols, oxidized forms of cholesterol, are not only essential for bile synthesis and sterol transportation but have recently been shown to contribute to the immune response. In addition, serum oxysterols levels have been proposed as suitable candidate biomarkers for neurological diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS). However how oxysterols modulate adaptive immunity is unknown and their functions in autoimmunity have not been investigated. The enzyme cholesterol 25 hydroxylase (Ch25h) is the rate limiting step to synthesize the oxysterol 7α,25-dihydroxycholesterol (7α,25-OHC) from cholesterol. We here report, using the MS murine model experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), that Ch25h deletion significantly attenuated EAE disease course by limiting trafficking of pathogenic CD4(+) T lymphocytes to the central nervous system (CNS). Mechanistically, we show a critical involvement for oxysterols in recruiting leukocytes into inflamed tissues and propose that 7α,25-OHC preferentially promotes the migration of activated CD44(+)CD4(+) T cells by binding the G protein-coupled receptor called Epstein-Barr virus induced gene 2 (EBI2). Collectively, our results support a pro-inflammatory role for oxysterols during EAE and identify oxysterols as a potential therapeutic target to treat autoimmune diseases. 
A study in mice implicates a cholesterol derivative in damping down the inflammatory response mediated by interleukin-1β and explaining, at least in part, the immunosuppressive effect of type I interferon, which is used in the treatment of multiple sclerosis. 
Type I interferon (IFN) protects against viruses, yet it also has a poorly understood suppressive influence on inflammation. Here, we report that activated mouse macrophages lacking the IFN-stimulated gene cholesterol 25-hydroxylase (Ch25h) and that are unable to produce the oxysterol 25-hydroxycholesterol (25-HC) overproduce inflammatory interleukin-1 (IL-1) family cytokines. 25-HC acts by antagonizing sterol response element-binding protein (SREBP) processing to reduce Il1b transcription and to broadly repress IL-1-activating inflammasomes. In accord with these dual actions of 25-HC, Ch25h-deficient mice exhibit increased sensitivity to septic shock, exacerbated experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, and a stronger ability to repress bacterial growth. These findings identify an oxysterol, 25-HC, as a critical mediator in the negative-feedback pathway of IFN signaling on IL-1 family cytokine production and inflammasome activity. 
Iso-octyl chain-hydroxylated oxysterols were determined in attomoles per 10,000 cells concentrations in 10,000-80,000 cultured pancreatic adenocarcinoma cells, using a sensitive, highly automated nano-LC-ESI-MS-based method. Identified oxysterols included 24S hydroxycholesterol (24S-OHC), 25 hydroxycholesterol (25-OHC), and 27 hydroxycholesterol (27-OHC), while 20S hydroxycholesterol and 22S hydroxycholesterol were not detected. Lower mass limit of quantification was 23 fg (65 amol) for 25-OHC and 27-OHC (100 times lower than our previous method) and 54 fg (135 amol) for 24S-OHC, after derivatization into Girard T hydrazones and online sample cleanup using simplified and robust automatic filtration and filter back flushing solid phase extraction LC/MS/MS. The instrument configuration was easily installed using a commercial nano-LC/MS system. Recoveries in spiked sample were 96, 97, and 77% for 24S-OHC, 25-OHC, and 27-OHC, with within- and between-day repeatabilities of 1-21% and 2-20% relative SD, respectively. The study demonstrates the potential of nano-LC in lipidomics/sterolomics.
Gammaherpesviruses are ubiquitous pathogens that establish a lifelong infection and are associated with cancer. In spite of the high seroprevalence of infection, the risk factors that predispose the host toward gammaherpesvirus-induced malignancies are still poorly understood. Interferon (IFN) regulatory factor 1 (IRF-1) is a tumor suppressor that is also involved in the regulation of innate and adaptive immune responses. On the basis of its biology, IRF-1 represents a plausible host factor to attenuate gammaherpesvirus infection and tumorigenesis. In this study, we show that IRF-1 restricts gammaherpesvirus replication in primary macrophages, a physiologically relevant immune cell type. In spite of the known role of IRF-1 in stimulating type I IFN expression, induction of a global type I IFN response was similar in IRF-1-deficient and -proficient macrophages during gammaherpesvirus infection. However, IRF-1 was required for optimal expression of cholesterol-25-hydroxylase, a host enzyme that restricted gammaherpesvirus replication in primary macrophages and contributed to the antiviral effects of IRF-1. In summary, the current study provides an insight into the mechanism by which IRF-1 attenuates gammaherpesvirus replication in primary immune cells, a mechanism that is likely to contribute to the antiviral effects of IRF-1 in other virus systems.
Interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF-1) is a transcription factor that regulates innate and adaptive immune responses and functions as a tumor suppressor. IRF-1 restricts the replication of diverse viruses; however, the mechanisms responsible for the antiviral effects of IRF-1 are still poorly understood. Gammaherpesviruses are ubiquitous pathogens that are associated with the induction of several malignancies. Here we show that IRF-1 expression attenuates gammaherpesvirus replication in primary macrophages, in part by increasing expression of cholesterol-25-hydroxylase (CH25H). CH25H and its product, 25-hydroxycholesterol, restrict replication of diverse virus families. Thus, our findings offer an insight into the mechanism by which IRF-1 attenuates the replication of gammaherpesviruses, a mechanism that is likely to be applicable to other virus systems.
Aging is accompanied by increasing vulnerability to pathologies such as atherosclerosis (ATH) and Alzheimer disease (AD). Are these different pathologies, or different presentations with a similar underlying pathoetiology?
Both ATH and AD involve inflammation, macrophage infiltration, and occlusion of the vasculature. Allelic variants in common genes including APOE predispose to both diseases. In both there is strong evidence of disease association with viral and bacterial pathogens including herpes simplex and Chlamydophila. Furthermore, ablation of components of the immune system (or of bone marrow-derived macrophages alone) in animal models restricts disease development in both cases, arguing that both are accentuated by inflammatory/immune pathways. We discuss that amyloid β, a distinguishing feature of AD, also plays a key role in ATH. Several drugs, at least in mouse models, are effective in preventing the development of both ATH and AD. Given similar age-dependence, genetic underpinnings, involvement of the vasculature, association with infection, Aβ involvement, the central role of macrophages, and drug overlap, we conclude that the two conditions reflect different manifestations of a common pathoetiology.
Infection and inflammation selectively induce the expression of cholesterol 25-hydroxylase (CH25H). Acutely, the production of 'immunosterol' 25-hydroxycholesterol (25OHC) defends against enveloped viruses. We present evidence that chronic macrophage CH25H upregulation leads to catalyzed esterification of sterols via 25OHC-driven allosteric activation of ACAT (acyl-CoA cholesterol acyltransferase/SOAT), intracellular accumulation of cholesteryl esters and lipid droplets, vascular occlusion, and overt disease.
We postulate that AD and ATH are both caused by chronic immunologic challenge that induces CH25H expression and protection against particular infectious agents, but at the expense of longer-term pathology.
Oxysterols such as 7 alpha, 25-dihydroxycholesterol (7α,25-OHC) are natural ligands for the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-induced gene 2 (EBI2, aka GPR183), a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) highly expressed in immune cells and required for adaptive immune responses. Activation of EBI2 by specific oxysterols leads to chemotaxis of B cells in lymphoid tissues. While the ligand gradient necessary for this critical process of the adaptive immune response is established by a stromal cells subset here we investigate the involvement of the oxysterol/EBI2 system in the innate immune response. First, we show that primary human macrophages express EBI2 and the enzymes needed for ligand production such as cholesterol 25-hydroxylase (CH25H), sterol 27-hydroxylase (CYP27A1), and oxysterol 7α-hydroxylase (CYP7B1). Furthermore, challenge of monocyte-derived macrophages with lipopolysaccharides (LPS) triggers a strong up-regulation of CH25H and CYP7B1 in comparison to a transient increase in EBI2 expression. Stimulation of EBI2 expressed on macrophages leads to calcium mobilization and to directed cell migration. Supernatants of LPS-stimulated macrophages are able to stimulate EBI2 signaling indicating that an induction of CH25H, CYP27A1, and CYP7B1 results in an enhanced production and release of oxysterols into the cellular environment. This is a study characterizing the oxysterol/EBI2 pathway in primary monocyte-derived macrophages. Given the crucial functional role of macrophages in the innate immune response these results encourage further exploration of a possible link to systemic autoimmunity. 
Sterol metabolites are known to be associated with immune responses. 25-Hydroxycholesterol (25HC) is a cholesterol metabolite that is produced by macrophages. The production of 25HC was reported to be TLR-dependent, indicating the involvement of 25HC in innate immunity. Now Blanc et al. show that macrophages synthesize 25HC to exert an antiviral effect. STAT1 was shown to be the most essential transcriptional factor involved in the induction of cholesterol 25-hydroxylase (Ch25h), the enzyme required to produce 25HC, indicating the importance of STAT1 in oxysterol-mediated innate immunity. 
Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most common malignant primary brain tumor and is invariably fatal to affected patients. Oxysterols belong to a class of bioactive lipids that are implicated in neurological disease and are associated with various types of cancer. Here, we investigated expression and transcriptional regulation of cholesterol 25-hydroxylase (CH25H) in human U87MG and GM133 glioblastoma cell lines. We demonstrate that in both cell lines transcription and translation of CH25H are increased in response to TNFα and IL1β. In parallel, both cell lines upregulate 25-hydroxycholesterol (25-OHC) synthesis and secretion to levels comparable to bone marrow-derived mouse macrophages under inflammatory conditions. To determine whether 25-OHC acts as chemoattractant for tumor-associated macrophages, the human THP-1 monoblastic leukemia cell line was treated with varying amounts of the oxysterol. Experiments revealed that 25-OHC and lipid extracts isolated from GM133-conditioned medium (containing 7-fold higher 25-OHC concentrations than U87MG medium) induce chemotactic migration of THP-1 cells. Of note, 25-OHC also induced the migration of primary human peripheral blood monocytes. In response to exogenously added 25-OHC, THP-1 cells reorganized intermediate filament-associated vimentin to more cortical and polarized structures. Chemotactic migration of monocytes in response to 25-OHC was pertussis toxin-sensitive, indicating the involvement of G protein-coupled receptors. Using RNA interference we demonstrated that G protein-coupled receptor 183 (EBI2) contributes to 25-OHC-mediated chemotactic migration of THP-1 cells. These in vitro data indicate that GBM-derived and secreted 25-OHC may be involved in the recruitment of immune-competent cells to a tumor via EBI2. 
In this issue of Immunity, studies by Blanc et al. (2013) and Liu et al. (2013) reveal how interferon induction of cholesterol-25-hydroxylase mediates innate immunity against multiple diverse viruses.
Aberrant oxysterol biosynthesis is implicated in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases. During the present study we have investigated the effects of exogenously added 25-hydroxycholesterol (25-HC) on transcription of cholesterol biosynthetic genes, sterol-regulatory element binding protein (SREBP) processing and cholesterol biosynthesis in the murine CATH.a neuronal cell line. A single i.p. injection of lipopolysaccharide resulted in robust induction of cholesterol 25-hydroxylase mRNA and protein levels in brains of treated mice. In vitro, 25-HC upregulated the transcription of ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) and (to a lesser extent) apolipoprotein E (apoE) in CATH.a neurons. Cholesterol biosynthetic gene expression (squalene synthase, HMG-CoA synthase, HMG-CoA reductase, and SREBP2) was downregulated by 25-HC. 25-HC also significantly attenuated proteolytic processing of SREBP2. Finally, 25-HC downregulated cholesterol biosynthesis in CATH.a neurons. Our results demonstrate that 25-HC is a potent effector oxysterol of neuronal cholesterol homeostasis.
Interferons (IFN) are essential antiviral cytokines that establish the cellular antiviral state through upregulation of hundreds of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), most of which have uncharacterized functions and mechanisms. We identified cholesterol-25-hydroxylase (CH25H) as a broadly antiviral ISG. CH25H converts cholesterol to a soluble antiviral factor, 25-hydroxycholesterol (25HC). 25HC treatment in cultured cells broadly inhibited growth of enveloped viruses including VSV, HSV, HIV, and MHV68 and acutely pathogenic EBOV, RVFV, RSSEV, and Nipah viruses under BSL4 conditions. It suppressed viral growth by blocking membrane fusion between virus and cell. In animal models, Ch25h-deficient mice were more susceptible to MHV68 lytic infection. Moreover, administration of 25HC in humanized mice suppressed HIV replication and reversed T cell depletion. Thus, our studies demonstrate a unique mechanism by which IFN achieves its antiviral state through the production of a natural oxysterol to inhibit viral entry and implicate membrane-modifying oxysterols as potential antiviral therapeutics.
Recent studies suggest that the sterol metabolic network participates in the interferon (IFN) antiviral response. However, the molecular mechanisms linking IFN with the sterol network and the identity of sterol mediators remain unknown. Here we report a cellular antiviral role for macrophage production of 25-hydroxycholesterol (cholest-5-en-3β,25-diol, 25HC) as a component of the sterol metabolic network linked to the IFN response via Stat1. By utilizing quantitative metabolome profiling of all naturally occurring oxysterols upon infection or IFN-stimulation, we reveal 25HC as the only macrophage-synthesized and -secreted oxysterol. We show that 25HC can act at multiple levels as a potent paracrine inhibitor of viral infection for a broad range of viruses. We also demonstrate, using transcriptional regulatory-network analyses, genetic interventions and chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments that Stat1 directly coupled Ch25h regulation to IFN in macrophages. Our studies describe a physiological role for 25HC as a sterol-lipid effector of an innate immune pathway.
The oxysterol-producing enzyme CH25H plays an important role in regulating lipid metabolism, gene expression, and immune activation. In vitro experiments using a panel of TLR agonists to activate BMDCs and macrophages demonstrated that Ch25h expression is induced rapidly, selectively, and robustly by the TLR ligands poly I:C and LPS. The mechanism of TLR3- and TLR4-induced transcription levels of Ch25h relies on the TRIF-mediated production of type I IFNs and requires signaling through the IFNαR and JAK/STAT1 pathway. Treatment of BMDCs and macrophages with IFN-α or IFN-β induces Ch25h in a STAT1-dependent manner. IFN-γ also up-regulated Ch25h expression by signaling through STAT1, suggesting that multiple pathways regulate the production of this enzyme. In addition, we demonstrated that regulation of Ch25h expression in vivo in lung-derived DCs and macrophages is dependent on signaling through the IFNαR and STAT1. The results suggest that the rapid induction of Ch25h and subsequent oxysterol synthesis may represent a component of the regulatory network that modulates the magnitude of innate immune reactions and possibly the nature and intensity of subsequent adaptive responses.
25-Hydroxycholesterol is produced in mammalian tissues. The function of this oxysterol is unknown. Here we describe a central role for 25-hydroxycholesterol in regulating the immune system. In initial experiments, we found that stimulation of macrophage Toll-like receptors (TLR) induced expression of cholesterol 25-hydroxylase and the synthesis of 25-hydroxycholesterol. Treatment of naïve B cells with nanomolar concentrations of 25-hydroxycholesterol suppressed IL-2-mediated stimulation of B cell proliferation, repressed activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) expression, and blocked class switch recombination, leading to markedly decreased IgA production. Consistent with these findings, deletion of the mouse cholesterol 25-hydroxylase gene caused an increase in serum IgA. Conversely, inactivation of the CYP7B1 oxysterol 7alpha-hydroxylase, which degrades 25-hydroxycholesterol, decreased serum IgA. The suppression of IgA class switching in B cells by a macrophage-derived sterol in response to TLR activation provides a mechanism for local and systemic negative regulation of the adaptive immune response by the innate immune system.
During screening of genes upregulated by lipopolysaccharide (LPS; endotoxin) treatment of bone marrow-derived mouse macrophages, it was unexpectedly found that cholesterol 25-hydroxylase (Ch25h) was strongly upregulated. Treatment of macrophages with 10 ng/ml of LPS for 2 h resulted in a 35-fold increase in the expression of Ch25h. In contrast, LPS treatment did not increase the expression of Cyp27a1 or Cyp7b1. The increased Ch25h expression was found to be independent of Myeloid differentiation protein 88 signaling but dependent on Toll-like receptor 4 signaling. LPS treatment of macrophages caused a 6- to 7-fold increase in cellular 25-hydroxycholesterol concentration. When macrophages were treated with increasing concentrations of 25-hydroxycholesterol, a dose-dependent release of CCL5 into the culture medium was observed. Intravenous injection of LPS in eight healthy volunteers resulted in an increase in plasma 25-hydroxycholesterol concentration. The possibility is discussed that 25-hydroxycholesterol may have a role in the inflammatory response, in addition to its more established role in the regulation of cholesterol homeostasis.
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia. It is characterized by beta-amyloid (A beta) plaques, neurofibrillary tangles and the degeneration of specifically vulnerable brain neurons. We observed high expression of the cholesterol 25-hydroxylase (CH25H) gene in specifically vulnerable brain regions of AD patients. CH25H maps to a region within 10q23 that has been previously linked to sporadic AD. Sequencing of the 5' region of CH25H revealed three common haplotypes, CH25Hchi2, CH25Hchi3 and CH25Hchi4; CSF levels of the cholesterol precursor lathosterol were higher in carriers of the CH25Hchi4 haplotype. In 1,282 patients with AD and 1,312 healthy control subjects from five independent populations, a common variation in the vicinity of CH25H was significantly associated with the risk for sporadic AD (p = 0.006). Quantitative neuropathology of brains from elderly non-demented subjects showed brain A beta deposits in carriers of CH25Hchi4 and CH25Hchi3 haplotypes, whereas no A beta deposits were present in CH25Hchi2 carriers. Together, these results are compatible with a role of CH25Hchi4 as a putative susceptibility factor for sporadic AD; they may explain part of the linkage of chromosome 10 markers with sporadic AD, and they suggest the possibility that CH25H polymorphisms are associated with different rates of brain A beta deposition.
Vitamin D3 plays an important role in the control of cell proliferation and differentiation. Cholesterol 25-hydroxylase (CH25H) is an enzyme converting cholesterol into 25-hydroxycholesterol. Vitamin D3 as well as 25-hydroxycholesterol has been shown to inhibit cell growth and induce cell apoptosis. Here we show that 10 nM 1alpha,25(OH)2D3 and 500 nM 25OHD3 upregulate CH25H mRNA expression in human primary prostate stromal cells (P29SN). Protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide does not block 1alpha,25(OH)2D3 mediated upregulation of CH25H mRNA. Transcription inhibitor actinomycin D blocks basal level as well as 1alpha,25(OH)2D3 induced CH25H mRNA expression. 1alpha,25(OH)2D3 has no effect on CH25H mRNA stability. 25-Hydroxycholesterol significantly decreased the P29SN cell number. A CH25H enzyme inhibitor, desmosterol, increases basal cell number but has no significant effect on vitamin D3 treated cells. Our data suggest that ch25h could be a vitamin D3 target gene and may partly mediate anti-proliferative action of vitamin D3 in human primary prostate stromal cells.
Recent studies have demonstrated that cholesterol metabolism has an important role in Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis, suggesting that cholesterol-related genes may be significant genetic risk factors for AD. Based on the results of genome-wide screens, along with biological studies, we selected three genes as candidates for AD risk factors: ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1), cholesterol 25-hydroxylase (CH25H) and cholesterol 24-hydroxylase (CH24H). Case-control of North American Caucasians and AD families of Caribbean Hispanic origin were examined. Although excellent biological candidates, the case-control dataset did not support the hypothesis that these three genes were associated with susceptibility to AD. Similarly, no association was found in the Caribbean Hispanic families for CH25H. However, we did observe a possible interaction between ABCA1 and APOE in the Hispanics.
Epidemiological studies identified a higher risk of developing Alzheimer's disease (AD) among subjects with elevated cholesterol levels. This association may be caused by a modulation of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing in response to the cellular cholesterol content. High cholesterol levels may favor the amyloidogenic pathway by inhibition of the alpha-secretase probably leading to elevated beta-Amyloid (Abeta) production. The identification of a linkage peak on chromosome 10q using high Abeta as quantitative trait led us to examine polymorphisms of genes located on chromosome 10 involved in cholesterol metabolism, like Lipase A (LIPA), Cholesterol 25 hydroxylase (CH25H), and FLJ22476, a high density lipoprotein binding related protein. Using 286 patients with AD and 162 controls we analyzed several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within LIPA, CH25H, and FLJ22476. None of the polymorphisms showed significant association with AD which contradicts recent findings on CH25H. From our results we conclude that the investigated genetic variations do not contribute to the genetic risk of AD.
Testicular macrophages secrete 25-hydroxycholesterol, which can be converted to testosterone by neighboring Leydig cells. The purposes of the present studies were to determine the mode of production of this oxysterol and its long-term effects on Leydig cells. Because oxysterols are produced both enzymatically and by auto-oxidation, we first determined if testicular macrophages possess cholesterol 25-hydroxylase mRNA and/or if macrophage-secreted products oxidize cholesterol extracellularly. Rat testicular macrophages had 25-hydroxylase mRNA and converted 14C-cholesterol to 14C-25-hydroxycholesterol; however, radiolabeled cholesterol was not converted to 25-hydroxycholesterol when incubated with medium previously exposed to testicular macrophages. Exposure of Leydig cells to 10 microg/ml of 25-hydroxycholesterol, a dose within the range known to result in high basal production of testosterone when tested from 1 to 6 h, completely abolished LH responsiveness after 2 days of treatment. Because 25-hydroxycholesterol is toxic to many cell types at 1-5 microg/ml, we also studied its influence on Leydig cells during 4 days in culture using a wide range of doses. Leydig cells were highly resistant to the cytotoxic effects of 25-hydroxycholesterol, with no cells dying at 10 microg/ml and only 50% of cells affected at 100 microg/ml after 2 days of treatment. Similar conditions resulted in 100% death of a control lymphocyte cell line. These results demonstrate that 1) testicular macrophages have mRNA for cholesterol 25-hydroxylase and can convert cholesterol into 25-hydroxycholesterol, 2) macrophage-conditioned medium is not capable of auto-oxidation of cholesterol, 3) Leydig cells are highly resistant to the cytotoxic influences of 25-hydroxycholesterol, and 4) long-term treatment with high doses of 25-hydroxycholesterol results in loss of LH responsiveness. These results support the concept that testicular macrophages enzymatically produce 25-hydroxycholesterol that not only is metabolized to testosterone by Leydig cells when present at putative physiological levels but also may exert inhibitory influences on Leydig cells when present for extended periods at very high concentrations that may occur under pathological conditions.
Oxysterols regulate the expression of genes involved in cholesterol and lipid metabolism and serve as intermediates in cholesterol catabolism. Among the most potent of regulatory oxysterols is 25-hydroxycholesterol, whose biosynthetic enzyme has not yet been isolated. Here, we report the cloning of cholesterol 25-hydroxylase cDNAs from the mouse and human. The encoded enzymes are polytopic membrane proteins of 298 and 272 amino acids, respectively, which contain clusters of histidine residues that are essential for catalytic activity. Unlike most other sterol hydroxylases, cholesterol 25-hydroxylase is not a cytochrome P450, but rather it is a member of a small family of enzymes that utilize diiron cofactors to catalyze the hydroxylation of hydrophobic substrates. The cholesterol 25-hydroxylase gene lacks introns, and in the human it is located on chromosome 10q23. The murine gene is expressed at low levels in multiple tissues. Expression of cholesterol 25-hydroxylase in transfected cells reduces the biosynthesis of cholesterol from acetate and suppresses the cleavage of sterol regulatory element binding protein-1 and -2. The data suggest that cholesterol 25-hydroxylase has the capacity to play an important role in regulating lipid metabolism by synthesizing a co-repressor that blocks sterol regulatory element binding protein processing and ultimately leads to inhibition of gene transcription.
We and others have previously demonstrated that congenital deficiency of the nuclear hormone receptor, Rorα1, in staggerer (sg/sg) mice results in resistance to diet-induced obesity and increased insulin sensitivity. Paradoxically, the sg/sg mice are susceptible to atherosclerosis and display impaired innate immunity, underscoring the regulatory links between metabolic disease, inflammation, and susceptibility to infection. Here, we present novel evidence that Rorα1 regulates innate immune function by demonstrating impaired phagocytosis in sg/sg mice. The early stages of Fc-γ receptor-mediated phagocytosis in lipopolysaccharide-activated sg/sg bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMMs) were significantly impaired compared with wild-type cells. Moreover, in sg/sg BMMs, the phagocytic cup membranes had reduced levels of cholesterol. Expression profiling revealed dysregulated expression of genes involved in inflammation and lipid metabolism in sg/sg BMMs. Notably, we identified decreased expression of the mRNA encoding cholesterol 25-hydroxylase (Ch25h), an enzyme that converts cholesterol to 25-hydroxycholesterol (25HC), an oxysterol with emerging roles in immunity. Treatment of sg/sg BMMs with 25HC rescued phagocytosis in a dose-dependent manner, whereas small interfering RNA knockdown of Ch25h mRNA expression in wild-type cells attenuated phagocytosis. Hence, we propose that 25HC is essential for optimizing membrane internalization during phagocytosis and that aberrant Ch25h expression in Rorα1-deficient sg/sg macrophages disrupts phagocytosis. Our studies reveal new roles for Rorα1, Ch25h, and 25HC in phagocytosis. Aberrant 25HC underpins the paradoxical association between insulin sensitivity and impaired innate immunity in Rorα1-deficient mice, heralding a wider and essential role for this oxysterol at the nexus of metabolism and immunity.
7α,25-dihydroxycholesterol (7α,25-OHC) is a ligand for the G protein-coupled receptor EBI2; however, the cellular sources of this oxysterol are undefined. 7α,25-OHC is synthesized from cholesterol by the stepwise actions of two enzymes, CH25H and CYP7B1, and is metabolized to a 3-oxo derivative by HSD3B7. We showed that all three enzymes control EBI2 ligand concentration in lymphoid tissues. Lymphoid stromal cells were the main CH25H- and CYP7B1-expressing cells required for positioning of B cells, and they also mediated 7α,25-OHC inactivation. CH25H and CYP7B1 were abundant at the follicle perimeter, whereas CH25H expression by follicular dendritic cells was repressed. CYP7B1, CH25H, and HSD3B7 deficiencies each resulted in defective T cell-dependent plasma cell responses. These findings establish that CYP7B1 and HSD3B7, as well as CH25H, have essential roles in controlling oxysterol production in lymphoid tissues, and they suggest that differential enzyme expression in stromal cell subsets establishes 7α,25-OHC gradients required for B cell responses.
The oxysterol 25-hydroxycholesterol is a widely used compound displaying an array of pharmacological actions in in vitro systems and cell based experimental systems. In spite of the frequent use of this compound over the last few decades and a large number of studies in vitro and in vivo, its mechanism of formation in vivo is still not well understood. Cholesterol autoxidation does not seem to be an important contributor to in vivo formation of 25-hydroxycholesterol. A number of different cytochrome P450 enzymes such as CYP27A1 and CYP3A4 have been reported to catalyze the conversion of cholesterol to 25-hydroxycholesterol in vitro, but the importance of these reactions in vivo remains unclear. The dioxygenase enzyme cholesterol 25-hydroxylase has been shown to generate 25-hydroxycholesterol, but in cholesterol 25-hydroxylase knockout mice there are still significant levels of 25-hydroxycholesterol in several tissues. This suggests that cholesterol 25-hydroxylase is not the sole producer of 25-hydroxycholesterol. The relative importance of different mechanisms of formation of 25-hydroxycholesterol in vivo have still to be elucidated. The maintenance of cholesterol homeostasis is of great importance to supply tissues with the appropriate amount of cholesterol and prevent accumulation that may affect health. Numerous articles mention 25-hydroxycholesterol as an important regulator of cholesterol metabolism. However, mice with a disruption of the cholesterol 25-hydroxylase gene regulate cholesterol metabolism normally and patients with highly elevated levels of 25-hydroxycholesterol also display normal cholesterol and bile acid levels. These reports challenge the hypothesis that 25-hydroxycholesterol is an important regulator of cholesterol metabolism. Recent reports suggest that 25-hydroxycholesterol and one of its metabolites may have functions in regulation of humoral immunity. Thus, 25-hydroxycholesterol may be more important as a regulator of immunity than as a regulator of cholesterol metabolism.
Cholesterol ester lipase (LIPA; EC 3.1.1.13) and cholesterol 25-hydroxylase (CH25H; EC 1.14.99.48) play essential role in cholesterol metabolism in the body by hydrolysing cholesteryl esters and triglycerides within lysosomes (LIPA) and catalysing the formation of 25-hydroxycholesterol from cholesterol (CH25H) which acts to repress cholesterol biosynthesis. Bioinformatic methods were used to predict the amino acid sequences, structures and genomic features of several vertebrate LIPA and CH25H genes and proteins, and to examine the phylogeny of vertebrate LIPA. Amino acid sequence alignments and predicted subunit structures enabled the identification of key sequences previously reported for human LIPA and CH25H and transmembrane structures for vertebrate CH25H sequences. Vertebrate LIPA and CH25H genes were located in tandem on all vertebrate genomes examined and showed several predicted transcription factor binding sites and CpG islands located within the 5' regions of the human genes. Vertebrate LIPA genes contained nine coding exons, while all vertebrate CH25H genes were without introns. Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated the distinct nature of the vertebrate LIPA gene and protein family in comparison with other vertebrate acid lipases and has apparently evolved from an ancestral LIPA gene which predated the appearance of vertebrates.

Atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory disease characterized by the accumulation of lipid-loaded macrophages in the arterial wall. We demonstrate that macrophage lipid body formation can be induced by modified lipoproteins or by inflammatory Toll-like receptor agonists. We used an unbiased approach to study the overlap in these pathways to identify regulators that control foam cell formation and atherogenesis. An analysis method integrating epigenomic and transcriptomic datasets with a transcription factor (TF) binding site prediction algorithm suggested that the TF ATF3 may regulate macrophage foam cell formation. Indeed, we found that deletion of this TF results in increased lipid body accumulation, and that ATF3 directly regulates transcription of the gene encoding cholesterol 25-hydroxylase. We further showed that production of 25-hydroxycholesterol (25-HC) promotes macrophage foam cell formation. Finally, deletion of ATF3 in Apoe(-/-) mice led to in vivo increases in foam cell formation, aortic 25-HC levels, and disease progression. These results define a previously unknown role for ATF3 in controlling macrophage lipid metabolism and demonstrate that ATF3 is a key intersection point for lipid metabolic and inflammatory pathways in these cells.
25-Hydroxycholesterol (25-HC) is produced from cholesterol by the enzyme cholesterol 25-hydroxylase and is associated with atherosclerosis of vessels. Recently, 25-HC was reported to cause inflammation in various types of tissues. The aim of this study was to assess the production of 25-HC in the airways and to elucidate the role of 25-HC in neutrophil infiltration in the airways of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
Eleven control never-smokers, six control ex-smokers without COPD and 13 COPD patients participated in the lung tissue study. The expression of cholesterol 25-hydroxylase in the lung was investigated. Twelve control subjects and 17 patients with COPD also participated in the sputum study. The concentrations of 25-HC in sputum were quantified by liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry analysis. To elucidate the role of 25-HC in neutrophilic inflammation of the airways, the correlation between 25-HC levels and neutrophil counts in sputum was investigated.
The expression of cholesterol 25-hydroxylase was significantly enhanced in lung tissue from COPD patients compared with that from control subjects. Cholesterol 25-hydroxylase was localized in alveolar macrophages and pneumocytes of COPD patients. The concentration of 25-HC in sputum was significantly increased in COPD patients and was inversely correlated with percent of predicted forced vital capacity, forced expiratory volume in 1 s and diffusing capacity of carbon monoxide. The concentrations of 25-HC in sputum were significantly correlated with sputum interleukin-8 levels and neutrophil counts.
25-HC production was enhanced in the airways of COPD patients and may play a role in neutrophilic inflammation.
Epstein-Barr virus-induced gene 2 (EBI2, also known as GPR183) is a G-protein-coupled receptor that is required for humoral immune responses; polymorphisms in the receptor have been associated with inflammatory autoimmune diseases. The natural ligand for EBI2 has been unknown. Here we describe the identification of 7α,25-dihydroxycholesterol (also called 7α,25-OHC or 5-cholesten-3β,7α,25-triol) as a potent and selective agonist of EBI2. Functional activation of human EBI2 by 7α,25-OHC and closely related oxysterols was verified by monitoring second messenger readouts and saturable, high-affinity radioligand binding. Furthermore, we find that 7α,25-OHC and closely related oxysterols act as chemoattractants for immune cells expressing EBI2 by directing cell migration in vitro and in vivo. A critical enzyme required for the generation of 7α,25-OHC is cholesterol 25-hydroxylase (CH25H). Similar to EBI2 receptor knockout mice, mice deficient in CH25H fail to position activated B cells within the spleen to the outer follicle and mount a reduced plasma cell response after an immune challenge. This demonstrates that CH25H generates EBI2 biological activity in vivo and indicates that the EBI2-oxysterol signalling pathway has an important role in the adaptive immune response.
To date, many studies have been conducted using 25-hydroxycholesterol, which is a potent regulator of lipid metabolism. However, the origins of this oxysterol have not been entirely elucidated. Cholesterol 25-hydroxylase is one of the enzymes responsible for the metabolism of 25-hydroxycholesterol, but the expression of this enzyme is very low in humans. This oxysterol is also synthesized by sterol 27-hydroxylase (CYP27A1) and cholesterol 24-hydroxylase(CYP46A1), but it is only a minor product of these enzymes. We now report that CYP3A synthesizes a significant amount of 25-hydroxycholesterol and may participate in the regulation of lipid metabolism. Induction of CYP3A by pregnenolone-16α-carbonitrile caused the accumulation of 25-hydroxycholesterol in a cell line derived from mouse liver. Furthermore, treatment of the cells with troleandomycin, a specific inhibitor of CYP3A, significantly reduced cellular 25-hydroxycholesterol concentrations. In cells that overexpressed human recombinant CYP3A4, the activity of cholesterol 25-hydroxylation was found to be higher than that of cholesterol 4β-hydroxylation, a known marker activity of CYP3A4. In addition, 25-hydroxycholesterol concentrations in normal human sera correlated positively with the levels of 4β-hydroxycholesterol (r = 0.650, P &lt; 0.0001, n = 78), but did not significantly correlate with the levels of 27-hydroxycholesterol or 24S-hydroxycholesterol. These results demonstrate the significance of CYP3A on the production of 25-hydroxycholesterol.
Activation of the complement cascade, a powerful effector mechanism of the innate immune system, is associated with neuroinflammation but also with elimination of inappropriate synapses during development. Synthesis of C1q, a recognition component of the complement system, occurs in brain during ischemia/reperfusion and Alzheimer's disease, suggesting that C1q may be a response to injury. In vitro, C1q, in the absence of other complement proteins, improves neuronal viability and neurite outgrowth and prevents β-amyloid-induced neuronal death, suggesting that C1q may have a direct neuroprotective role. Here, investigating the molecular basis for this neuroprotection in vitro, addition of C1q to rat primary cortical neurons significantly upregulated expression of genes associated with cholesterol metabolism, such as cholesterol-25-hydroxylase and insulin induced gene 2, and transiently decreased cholesterol levels in neurons, known to facilitate neurite outgrowth. In addition, the expression of syntaxin-3 and its functional association with synaptosomal-associated protein 25 was increased. C1q also increased the nuclear translocation of cAMP response element-binding protein and CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein-δ (C/EBP-δ), two transcription factors involved in nerve growth factor (NGF) expression and downregulated specific microRNAs, including let-7c that is predicted to target (and thus inhibit) NGF and neurotrophin-3 (NT-3) mRNA. Accordingly, C1q increased expression of NGF and NT-3, and small interfering RNA inhibition of C/EBP-δ, NGF, or NT-3 expression prevented the C1q-dependent neurite outgrowth. No such neuroprotective effect is seen in the presence of C3a or C5a. Finally, the induced neuronal gene expression required conformationally intact C1q. These results show that C1q can directly promote neuronal survival, thereby demonstrating new interactions between immune proteins and neuronal cells that may facilitate neuroprotection.
Host cells use metabolic signaling through the LXRα nuclear receptor to defend against Listeria monocytogenes infection. 25-Hydroxycholesterol is a natural ligand of LXRs that is produced by the enzyme cholesterol 25-hydroxylase (CH25H). We found that expression of Ch25h is upregulated following L. monocytogenes infection in a beta interferon (IFN-β)-dependent fashion. Moreover, increased Ch25h expression promotes survival of L. monocytogenes-infected cells and increases sensitivity of the host to infection. We determined that expression of Cd5l, a prosurvival gene, is controlled by CH25H. In addition, we found that CD5L inhibits activation of caspase-1, promoting survival of infected macrophages. Our results reveal a mechanism by which an intracellular pathogen can prolong survival of infected cells, thus providing itself with a protected environment in which to replicate.
Cholesterol 25-hydroxylase (CH25H) has recently been identified as a host restriction factor that exerts antiviral effects by catalyzing the production of 25-hydroxycholesterol (25HC). CH25H can be rapidly induced upon infection with some viruses. Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), an arterivirus, has ranked among the most important swine pathogens since it was discovered in the late 1980s. In this study, we found that PRRSV infection significantly downregulated the expression of CH25H in cells by a so-far unknown mechanism, suggesting that CH25H exerts antiviral activity against PRRSV. Indeed, overexpression of CH25H inhibited PRRSV replication, whereas knockdown of CH25H by short interfering RNA (siRNA) promoted PRRSV infection. The anti-PRRSV effect of 25HC operates via inhibition of viral penetration. Interestingly, a CH25H mutant (CH25H-M) lacking hydroxylase activity still inhibited PRRSV infection. Screening using a yeast two-hybrid system followed by coimmunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence colocalization analyses confirmed that both CH25H and CH25H-M interact with the nonstructural protein 1 alpha (nsp1α) of PRRSV. Unexpectedly, the expression of nsp1α decreased following coexpression with CH25H or CH25H-M. Detailed analyses demonstrated that CH25H/CH25H-M could degrade nsp1α through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway and that site K169 in the nsp1α protein is the key site of ubiquitination. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that CH25H restricts PRRSV replication by targeting viral penetration as well as degrading nsp1α, revealing a novel antiviral mechanism used by CH25H.IMPORTANCE PRRSV has been a continuous threat to the global swine industry, and current vaccines are insufficient to provide sustainable control. CH25H has been found to exert a broad antiviral effect; thus, it is an attractive target for the development of anti-PRRSV drugs. Here, we demonstrate that CH25H is an interferon-stimulated gene that is highly expressed in porcine alveolar macrophages. CH25H exerts its anti-PRRSV effect not only via the production of 25HC to inhibit viral penetration but also by degrading viral protein through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, suggesting that CH25H is a candidate for the development of antiviral therapeutics. However, PRRSV infection appears to actively decrease CH25H expression to promote viral replication, highlighting the complex game between PRRSV and its host.
From various screens, we found that Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) viral microRNAs (miRNAs) target several enzymes in the mevalonate/cholesterol pathway. 3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (CoA) synthase 1 (HMGCS1), 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase (HMGCR [a rate-limiting step in the mevalonate pathway]), and farnesyl-diphosphate farnesyltransferase 1 (FDFT1 [a committed step in the cholesterol branch]) are repressed by multiple KSHV miRNAs. Transfection of viral miRNA mimics in primary endothelial cells (human umbilical vein endothelial cells [HUVECs]) is sufficient to reduce intracellular cholesterol levels; however, small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) targeting only HMGCS1 did not reduce cholesterol levels. This suggests that multiple targets are needed to perturb this tightly regulated pathway. We also report here that cholesterol levels were decreased in de novo-infected HUVECs after 7 days. This reduction is at least partially due to viral miRNAs, since the mutant form of KSHV lacking 10 of the 12 miRNA genes had increased cholesterol compared to wild-type infections. We hypothesized that KSHV is downregulating cholesterol to suppress the antiviral response by a modified form of cholesterol, 25-hydroxycholesterol (25HC). We found that the cholesterol 25-hydroxylase (CH25H) gene, which is responsible for generating 25HC, had increased expression in de novo-infected HUVECs but was strongly suppressed in long-term latently infected cell lines. We found that 25HC inhibits KSHV infection when added exogenously prior to de novo infection. In conclusion, we found that multiple KSHV viral miRNAs target enzymes in the mevalonate pathway to modulate cholesterol in infected cells during latency. This repression of cholesterol levels could potentially be beneficial to viral infection by decreasing the levels of 25HC.IMPORTANCE A subset of viruses express unique microRNAs (miRNAs), which act like cellular miRNAs to generally repress host gene expression. A cancer virus, Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV, or human herpesvirus 8 [HHV-8]), encodes multiple miRNAs that repress gene expression of multiple enzymes that are important for cholesterol synthesis. In cells with these viral miRNAs or with natural infection, cholesterol levels are reduced, indicating these viral miRNAs decrease cholesterol levels. A modified form of cholesterol, 25-hydroxycholesterol, is generated directly from cholesterol. Addition of 25-hydroxycholesterol to primary cells inhibited KSHV infection of cells, suggesting that viral miRNAs may decrease cholesterol levels to decrease the concentration of 25-hydroxycholesterol and to promote infection. These results suggest a new virus-host relationship and indicate a previously unidentified viral strategy to lower cholesterol levels.
Cholesterol 25-hydroxylase (CH25H) catalyses the production of 25-hydroxycholesterol (25HC) from cholesterol by adding a second hydroxyl group at position 25. The aim of this study was to examine the antiviral effect of CH25H on pseudorabies virus (PRV), a swine pathogen that can cause devastating disease and economic losses worldwide. The results showed that porcine ch25h was induced by either interferon or PRV infection. PRV infection of porcine alveolar macrophages (3D4/21 cells) was attenuated by CH25H overexpression and enhanced by silencing of CH25H. Furthermore, treatment of 3D4/21 cells with 25HC inhibited the growth of PRV in vitro, suggesting that CH25H may restrict PRV replication by 25HC production. We further identified that the anti-PRV role of CH25H and 25HC was subject to their inhibitory effect on PRV attachment and entry. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that CH25H is an intrinsic host restriction factor in PRV infection of porcine alveolar macrophages.
Feeding LDL receptor (LDLR)-null mice a Western diet (WD) increased the expression of IFN-β in jejunum as determined by quantitative RT-PCR (RT-qPCR), immunohistochemistry (IHC), and ELISA (all P &lt; 0.0001). WD also increased the expression of cholesterol 25-hydroxylase (CH25H) as measured by RT-qPCR (P &lt; 0.0001), IHC (P = 0.0019), and ELISA (P &lt; 0.0001), resulting in increased levels of 25-hydroxycholesterol (25-OHC) in jejunum as determined by LC-MS/MS (P &lt; 0.0001). Adding ezetimibe at 10 mg/kg/day or adding a concentrate of transgenic tomatoes expressing the 6F peptide (Tg6F) at 0.06% by weight of diet substantially ameliorated these changes. Adding either ezetimibe or Tg6F to WD also ameliorated WD-induced changes in plasma lipids, serum amyloid A, and HDL cholesterol. Adding the same doses of ezetimibe and Tg6F together to WD (combined formulation) was generally more efficacious compared with adding either agent alone. Surprisingly, adding ezetimibe during the preparation of Tg6F, but before addition to WD, was more effective than the combined formulation for all parameters measured in jejunum (P = 0.0329 to P &lt; 0.0001). We conclude the following: i) WD induces IFN-β, CH25H, and 25-OHC in jejunum; and ii) Tg6F and ezetimibe partially ameliorate WD-induced inflammation by preventing WD-induced increases in IFN-β, CH25H, and 25-OHC.
Cholesterol 25-hydroxylase (Ch25h) is an interferon-inducible protein, and recent studies have demonstrated that it inhibited the replication of many enveloped viruses. However, in this study, we found that cells infected with wild-type (WT) HSV-1 reduced the expression of Ch25h, and ectopic expression of Ch25h could not inhibit the replication of WT-HSV-1. By screening assay, HSV-1 UL41 protein was found to down-regulate the expression of Ch25h. In addition, UL41 abrogated the antiviral activity of Ch25h via degrading its mRNA. Furthermore, ectopic expression of Ch25h inhibited the replication of UL41-null mutant HSV-1 (R2621), but not WT-HSV-1, and knockdown of Ch25h did not affect the replication of WT-HSV-1, but promoted the replication of the R2621. For the first time, HSV-1 UL41 was demonstrated to evade the antiviral function of Ch25h via its endonuclease activity.
Zika virus (ZIKV) has become a public health threat due to its global transmission and link to severe congenital disorders. The host immune responses to ZIKV infection have not been fully elucidated, and effective therapeutics are not currently available. Herein, we demonstrated that cholesterol-25-hydroxylase (CH25H) was induced in response to ZIKV infection and that its enzymatic product, 25-hydroxycholesterol (25HC), was a critical mediator of host protection against ZIKV. Synthetic 25HC addition inhibited ZIKV infection in vitro by blocking viral entry, and treatment with 25HC reduced viremia and conferred protection against ZIKV in mice and rhesus macaques. 25HC suppressed ZIKV infection and reduced tissue damage in human cortical organoids and the embryonic brain of the ZIKV-induced mouse microcephaly model. Our findings highlight the protective role of CH25H during ZIKV infection and the potential use of 25HC as a natural antiviral agent to combat ZIKV infection and prevent ZIKV-associated outcomes, such as microcephaly.
Obesity is a major risk factor for several diseases including diabetes, heart disease, and some forms of cancer and due to its rapidly increasing prevalence it has become one of the biggest problems medicine is facing today. All the more surprising, a substantial percentage of obese patients are metabolically healthy when classified based on insulin resistance and systemic inflammation. Oxysterols are naturally occurring molecules that play important role in various metabolic and inflammatory processes and their levels are elevated in patients suffering from obesity and diabetes. 25-Hydroxycholesterol (25-OHC) is produced in cells from cholesterol by the enzyme cholesterol 25-hydroxylase (Ch25h) and is involved in lipid metabolism, inflammatory processes, and cell proliferation. Here, we investigated the role of hepatic Ch25h in the transition from metabolically healthy obesity to insulin resistance and diabetes. Using several different experimental approaches, we demonstrated the significance of Ch25h on the border of "healthy" and "diseased" states of obesity. Adenovirus-mediated Ch25h overexpression in mice improved glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity and lowered HOMA-IR. Our data suggest that low hepatic Ch25h levels could be considered a risk marker for unhealthy obesity.
While angiotensin II (ang II) has been implicated in the pathogenesis of cardiac cachexia (CC), the molecules that mediate ang II's wasting effect have not been identified. It is known TNF-α level is increased in patients with CC, and TNF-α release is triggered by ang II. We therefore hypothesized that ang II induced muscle wasting is mediated by TNF-α. Ang II infusion led to skeletal muscle wasting in wild type (WT) but not in TNF alpha type 1 receptor knockout (TNFR1KO) mice, suggesting that ang II induced muscle loss is mediated by TNF-α through its type 1 receptor. Microarray analysis identified cholesterol 25-hydroxylase (Ch25h) as the down stream target of TNF-α. Intraperitoneal injection of 25-hydroxycholesterol (25-OHC), the product of Ch25h, resulted in muscle loss in C57BL/6 mice, accompanied by increased expression of atrogin-1, MuRF1 and suppression of IGF-1/Akt signaling pathway. The identification of 25-OHC as an inducer of muscle wasting has implications for the development of specific treatment strategies in preventing muscle loss.
Lassa virus (LASV) infection is a major public health concern due to high fatality rates and limited effective treatment. The interferon-stimulated gene cholesterol 25-hydroxylase (CH25H) encodes an enzyme that catalyzes the production of 25-hydroxycholesterol (25HC). 25HC is involved in regulating cholesterol biosynthesis and has recently been identified as a potent antiviral targeting enveloped virus entry. Here, we show a previously unrecognized role of CH25H in inhibiting LASV glycoprotein glycosylation and the production of infectious virus. Overexpression of CH25H or treatment with 25HC decreased LASV G1 glycoprotein N-glycan maturation and reduced the production of infectious LASV. Depletion of endogenous CH25H using small interfering RNA (siRNA) enhanced the levels of fully glycosylated G1 and increased infectious LASV production. Finally, LASV particles produced from 25HC-treated cells were found to be less infectious, to incorporate aberrantly glycosylated GP1 species, and to be defective in binding alpha-dystroglycan, an attachment and entry receptor. Our findings identify a novel role for CH25H in controlling LASV propagation and indicate that manipulation of the expression of CH25H or the administration of 25HC may be a useful anti-LASV therapy.
Lassa fever is an acute viral hemorrhagic fever in humans caused by Lassa virus (LASV). No vaccine for LASV is currently available. Treatment is limited to the administration of ribavirin, which is only effective when given early in the course of illness. Cholesterol 25-hydroxylase (CH25H) is a recently identified interferon-stimulated gene (ISG); it encodes an enzyme that catalyzes the production of 25-hydroxycholesterol (25HC), which inhibits several viruses. Here, we identify a novel antiviral mechanism of 25HC that is dependent on inhibiting the glycosylation of Lassa virus (LASV) glycoprotein and reducing the infectivity of LASV as a means of suppressing viral replication. Since N-linked glycosylation is a critical feature of other enveloped-virus glycoproteins, 25HC may be a broad inhibitor of virus infectivity.
Astrocytes, the major glial cell population of the central nervous system (CNS), play important physiological roles related to CNS homeostasis. Growing evidence demonstrates that astrocytes trigger innate immune responses under challenge of a variety of proinflammatory cytokines. Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF), a proinflammatory cytokine mainly secreted from monocytes/macrophages, is involved in inflammation-associated pathophysiology. Here, we displayed that expression of MIF significantly increased following spinal cord injury, in colocalization with microglia and astrocytes. MIF elicited inflammatory responses of astrocytes via activation of CD74 receptor and extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK) pathway. Transcriptome analysis revealed that inflammation-related factors cholesterol 25-hydroxylase (Ch25h) and phospholipase A2-IIA (Pla2g2a), downstream of MIF/CD74 axis, were potentially implicated in the mediating inflammatory response of astrocytes. Our results provided a new target for interference of CNS inflammation after insults.
Cholesterol is a main lipid component of sperm cell that is essential for sperm membrane fluidity, capacitation, and acrosomal reaction. Recent data obtained in bovine sperm showed that sperm capacitation is associated to the formation of oxysterols, oxidized products of cholesterol. The aim of this study was to profile oxysterol content in human semen, and to investigate their potential role in sperm pathophysiology. Among the 12 oxysterols analyzed, 25-hydroxycholesterol (25-HC) resulted the most represented in normozoospermic samples, and its concentration positively correlated with spermatozoa number. We detected Cholesterol 25-hydroxylase, the enzyme responsible for 25-HC production, in human spermatozoa at the level of the neck and the post acrosomal area. Upon incubation with spermatozoa, 25-HC induced calcium and cholesterol transients in connection with the acrosomal reaction. Our results support a role for 25-HC in sperm function.
Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune, inflammatory disease of the central nervous system (CNS). We have measured the levels of over 20 non-esterified sterols in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from patients suffering from MS, inflammatory CNS disease, neurodegenerative disease and control patients. Analysis was performed following enzyme-assisted derivatisation by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) exploiting multistage fragmentation (MS n ). We found increased concentrations of bile acid precursors in CSF from each of the disease states and that patients with inflammatory CNS disease classified as suspected autoimmune disease or of unknown aetiology also showed elevated concentrations of 25-hydroxycholestertol (25-HC, P &lt; 0.05) in CSF. Cholesterol concentrations in CSF were not changed except for patients diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (P &lt; 0.01) or pathogen-based infections of the CNS (P &lt; 0.05) where they were elevated. In plasma, we found that 25-HC (P &lt; 0.01), (25R)26-hydroxycholesterol ((25R)26-HC, P &lt; 0.05) and 7α-hydroxy-3-oxocholest-4-enoic acid (7αH,3O-CA, P &lt; 0.05) were reduced in relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) patients compared to controls. The pattern of reduced plasma levels of 25-HC, (25R)26-HC and 7αH,3O-CA was unique to RRMS. In summary, in plasma, we find that the concentration of 25-HC in RRMS patients is significantly lower than in controls. This is consistent with the hypothesis that a lower propensity of macrophages to synthesise 25-HC will result in reduced negative feedback by 25-HC on IL-1 family cytokine production and exacerbated MS. In CSF, we find that the dominating metabolites reflect the acidic pathway of bile acid biosynthesis and the elevated levels of these in CNS disease is likely to reflect cholesterol release as a result of demyelination or neuronal death. 25-HC is elevated in patients with inflammatory CNS disease probably as a consequence of up-regulation of the type 1 interferon-stimulated gene cholesterol 25-hydroxylase in macrophages.
Knockout technology has proven useful for delineating functional roles of specific genes. Here we describe and provide an explanation for striking pathology that occurs in a subset of genetically engineered mice expressing a rat CaVβ2a transgene under control of the cardiac α-myosin heavy chain promoter. Lesions were limited to mice homozygous for transgene and independent of native Cacnb2 genomic copy number. Gross findings included an atrophied pancreas; decreased adipose tissue; thickened, orange intestines; and enlarged liver, spleen, and abdominal lymph nodes. Immune cell infiltration and cell engulfment by macrophages were associated with loss of pancreatic acinar cells. Foamy macrophages diffusely infiltrated the small intestine's lamina propria, while similar macrophage aggregates packed liver and splenic red pulp sinusoids. Periodic acid-Schiff-positive, diastase-resistant, iron-negative, Oil Red O-positive, and autofluorescent cytoplasm was indicative of a lipid storage disorder. Electron microscopic analysis revealed liver sinusoids distended by clusters of macrophages containing intracellular myelin "swirls" and hepatocytes with enlarged lysosomes. Additionally, build up of cholesterol, cholesterol esters, and triglycerides, along with changes in liver metabolic enzyme levels, were consistent with a lipid processing defect. Because of this complex pathology, we examined the transgene insertion site. Multiple transgene copies inserted into chromosome 19; at this same site, an approximate 180,000 base pair deletion occurred, ablating cholesterol 25-hydroxylase and partially deleting lysosomal acid lipase and CD95 Loss of gene function can account for the altered lipid processing, along with hypertrophy of the immune system, which define this phenotype, and serendipitously provides a novel mouse model of lysosomal storage disorder.
Nitazoxanide (Alinia(®), NTZ) and tizoxanide (TIZ), its active circulating metabolite, belong to a class of agents known as thiazolides (TZD) endowed with broad anti-infective activities. TIZ and RM-4848, the active metabolite of RM-5038, were shown to stimulate innate immunity in vitro. Because natural resistance to HIV-1 infection in HIV-exposed seronegative (HESN) individuals is suggested to be associated with strong innate immune responses, we verified whether TIZ and RM-4848 could reduce the in vitro infectiousness of HIV-1. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from 20 healthy donors were infected in vitro with HIV-1BaL in the presence/absence of TIZ or RM4848. HIV-1 p24 were measured at different timepoints. The immunomodulatory abilities of TZD were evaluated by the expression of type I IFN pathway genes and the production of cytokines and chemokines. TZD drastically inhibited in vitro HIV-1 replication (&gt;87%). This was associated with the activation of innate immune responses and with the up-regulation of several interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), including those involved in cholesterol pathway, particularly the cholesterol-25 hydroxylase (CH25H). TZD inhibition of HIV-1 replication in vitro could be due to their ability to stimulate potent and multifaceted antiviral immune responses. These data warrant the exploration of TZD as preventive/therapeutic agent in HIV infection.
Nuclear hormone receptors have important roles in the regulation of metabolic and inflammatory pathways. The retinoid-related orphan receptor alpha (Rorα)-deficient staggerer (sg/sg) mice display several phenotypes indicative of aberrant lipid metabolism, including dyslipidemia, and increased susceptibility to atherosclerosis. In this study we demonstrate that macrophages from sg/sg mice have increased ability to accumulate lipids and accordingly exhibit larger lipid droplets (LD). We have previously shown that BMMs from sg/sg mice have significantly decreased expression of cholesterol 25-hydroxylase (Ch25h) mRNA, the enzyme that produces the oxysterol, 25-hydroxycholesterol (25HC), and now confirm this at the protein level. 25HC functions as an inverse agonist for RORα. siRNA knockdown of Ch25h in macrophages up-regulates Vldlr mRNA expression and causes increased accumulation of LDs. Treatment with physiological concentrations of 25HC in sg/sg macrophages restored lipid accumulation back to normal levels. Thus, 25HC and RORα signify a new pathway involved in the regulation of lipid homeostasis in macrophages, potentially via increased uptake of lipid which is suggested by mRNA expression changes in Vldlr and other related genes. 
DNA methyltransferase inhibitors (DNMT inhibitors) are administered for high-risk MDS, but their action mechanisms are not fully understood. Hence, we performed a genome-wide DNA methylation assay and focused on cholesterol 25-hydroxylase (CH25H) among the genes whose expression was up-regulated and whose promoter region was hypomethylated after decitabine (DAC) treatment in vitro. CH25H catalyzes hydroxylation of cholesterol and produces 25-hydroxycholesterol (25-OHC). Although CH25H mRNA expression level was originally low in MDS/leukemia cell lines, exposure to DNMT inhibitors enhanced CH25H mRNA expression. The promoter region of CH25H was originally hypermethylated in HL-60 and MDS-L cells, but DAC treatment induced their hypomethylation together with increased CH25H mRNA expression, activation of CH25H-oxysterol pathway, 25-OHC production and apoptotic cell death. We further confirmed that normal CD34-positive cells revealed hypomethylated status of the promoter region of CH25H gene. CH25H-knockdown by transfection of shRNA lentiviral vector into the cell lines partially protected the cells from DAC-induced cell death. Exogenous addition of 25-OHC suppressed leukemic cell growth. The present study raises a possibility that DNMT inhibitors activate CH25H-oxysterol pathway by their hypomethylating mechanism and induce leukemic cell death. Further investigations of the promoter analysis of CH25H gene and therapeutic effects of DNMT inhibitors on MDS/leukemia will be warranted. 
Understanding the genetic basis of phenotypic diversity is a challenge in contemporary biology. Domestication provides a model for unravelling aspects of the genetic basis of stress sensitivity. The ancestral Red Junglefowl (RJF) exhibits greater fear-related behaviour and a more pronounced HPA-axis reactivity than its domesticated counterpart, the White Leghorn (WL). By comparing hormones (plasmatic) and adrenal global gene transcription profiles between WL and RJF in response to an acute stress event, we investigated the molecular basis for the altered physiological stress responsiveness in domesticated chickens. Basal levels of pregnenolone and dehydroepiandrosterone as well as corticosterone response were lower in WL. Microarray analysis of gene expression in adrenal glands showed a significant breed effect in a large number of transcripts with over-representation of genes in the channel activity pathway. The expression of the best-known steroidogenesis genes were similar across the breeds used. Transcription levels of acute stress response genes such as StAR, CH25 and POMC were upregulated in response to acute stress. Dampened HPA reactivity in domesticated chickens was associated with changes in the expression of several genes that presents potentially minor regulatory effects rather than by means of change in expression of critical steroidogenic genes in the adrenal. 
During first merogony Eimeria bovis forms large macromeronts in endothelial host cells containing &gt;120 000 merozoites I. During multiplication, large amounts of cholesterol are indispensable for the enormous offspring membrane production. Cholesterol auxotrophy was proven for other apicomplexan parasites. Consequently they scavenge cholesterol from their host cell apparently in a parasite-specific manner. We here analyzed the influence of E. bovis infection on endothelial host cell cholesterol metabolism and found considerable differences to other coccidian parasites. Overall, free cholesterol significantly accumulated in E. bovis infected host cells. Furthermore, a striking increase of lipid droplet formation was observed within immature macromeronts. Artificial host cell lipid droplet enrichment significantly improved E. bovis merozoite I production confirming the key role of lipid droplet contents for optimal parasite proliferation. The transcription of several genes being involved in both, cholesterol de novo biosynthesis and low density lipoprotein-(LDL) mediated uptake, was significantly up-regulated at a time in infected cells suggesting a simultaneous exploitation of these two cholesterol acquisition pathways. E. bovis scavenges LDL-derived cholesterol apparently through significantly increased levels of surface LDL receptor abundance and LDL binding to infected cells. Consequently, LDL supplementation significantly improved parasite replication. The up-regulation of the oxidized LDL receptor 1 furthermore identified this scavenger receptor as a key molecule in parasite-triggered LDL uptake. Moreover, cellular cholesterol processing was altered in infected cells as indicated by up-regulation of cholesterol-25-hydroxylase and sterol O-acyltransferase. Overall, these results show that E. bovis considerably exploits the host cell cholesterol metabolism to guarantee its massive intracellular growth and replication. 
The metabolic interplay between hosts and viruses plays a crucial role in determining the outcome of viral infection. Viruses reorchestrate the host's primary metabolic gene networks, including genes associated with mevalonate and isoprenoid synthesis, to acquire the necessary energy and structural components for their viral life cycles. Recent work has demonstrated that the interferon-mediated antiviral response suppresses the sterol pathway through production of a signalling molecule, 25-hydroxycholesterol (25HC). This oxysterol has been shown to exert multiple effects, both through incorporation into host cellular membranes as well as through transcriptional control. Herein, we summarize our current understanding of the multifunctional roles of 25HC in the mammalian innate antiviral response.
Cholesterol 25-hydroxylase (CH25H) has been shown lately to be a host restriction factor that encodes an enzyme, which catalyzes the oxidized form of cholesterol to 25-hydroxycholesterol (25HC). A series of studies have shown that 25HC activity in hosts plays a vital role in inhibiting viral infection. In this study, we explored the antiviral effect of CH25H and 25HC on porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), which causes high mortality rates in newborn piglets with severe diarrhea, and considerable financial loss in the swine industry worldwide. Our results showed that PEDV infection downregulated the expression of CH25H in Vero cells. An overexpression and knockdown assay indicated that CH25H has significant antiviral action against PEDV, and a CH25H mutant (CH25H-M) that lacks hydroxylase activity also retains antiviral activity to a lesser extent. Furthermore, 25HC had a broad-spectrum antiviral effect against different PEDV strains by blocking viral entry. In addition, CH25H and 25HC inhibited the replication of porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV). Taken together, CH25H as a natural host restriction factor could inhibit PEDV and TGEV infection.
Cholesterol 25-hydroxylase (CH25H) is an interferon (IFN)-induced gene that catalyzes the oxidation of cholesterol to 25-hydroxycholesterol (25HC), which exerts broad-spectrum antiviral function. To investigate the roles of fish CH25H in Singapore grouper iridovirus (SGIV) and red-spotted grouper nervous necrosis virus (RGNNV) infection, we cloned and characterized a CH25H homolog from orange-spotted grouper (Epinephelus coioides) (EcCH25H). EcCH25H encoded a 271-amino-acid polypeptide, with 86 and 59% homology with yellow croaker (Larimichthys crocea) and humans, respectively. EcCH25H contained a conserved fatty acid (FA) hydroxylase domain and an ERG3 domain. EcCH25H expression was induced by RGNNV or SGIV infection, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or poly (I:C) treatment in vitro. Subcellular localization showed that EcCH25H and mutant EcCH25H-M were distributed in the cytoplasm and partly colocalized with the endoplasmic reticulum. SGIV and RGNNV replication was decreased by EcCH25H overexpression, which was reflected in the reduced severity of the cytopathic effect and a decrease in viral gene transcription, but replication of both viruses was increased by knockdown of EcCH25H. Besides, the antiviral activity was dependent on its enzymatic activity. Treatment with 25HC significantly inhibited replication of SGIV and RGNNV. EcCH25H overexpression positively regulated the IFN-related molecules and proinflammatory cytokines, and increased both IFN and ISRE promoter activities. Moreover, 25HC treatment significantly suppressed SGIV and RGNNV entry into host cells. The similar inhibitory effect on SGIV entry was observed in EcCH25H overexpression cells. Taken together, our findings demonstrated that EcCH25H inhibited SGIV and RGNNV infection by regulating IFN signaling molecules, and might also influence viral entry via an effect on cholesterol.
Cholesterol, an essential component of mammalian cells, is also an important factor in the replicative-cycles of several human and animal viruses. The oxysterol, 25-hydroxycholesterol, is produced from cholesterol by the enzyme, cholesterol 25-hydroxylase. 25-hydroxycholesterol (25-HC) has been shown to have anti-viral activities against a wide range of viruses, including a range of positive-sense RNA viruses. In this study, we have investigated the role of 25-HC in norovirus replication using murine norovirus (MNV) as a model system. As a control, we employed herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1), a pathogen previously shown to be inhibited by 25-HC. Consistent with previous studies, 25-HC inhibited HSV-1 replication in the MNV-susceptible cell line, RAW264.7. Treating RAW264.7 cells with sub-cytotoxic concentrations of 25-HC reduced the MNV titers. However, other sterols such as cholesterol or the oxysterol, 22-S-hydroxycholesterol (22-S-HC), did not inhibit MNV replication. Moreover, treating MNV-infected RAW264.7 cells with 25-HC-stimulated caspase 3/7 activity, which leads to enhanced apoptosis and increased cell death. Our study adds noroviruses to the list of viruses inhibited by 25-HC and begins to offer insights into the mechanism behind this inhibition.
Tumor-derived extracellular vesicles (TEV) "educate" healthy cells to promote metastases. We found that melanoma TEV downregulated type I interferon (IFN) receptor and expression of IFN-inducible cholesterol 25-hydroxylase (CH25H). CH25H produces 25-hydroxycholesterol, which inhibited TEV uptake. Low CH25H levels in leukocytes from melanoma patients correlated with poor prognosis. Mice incapable of downregulating the IFN receptor and Ch25h were resistant to TEV uptake, TEV-induced pre-metastatic niche, and melanoma lung metastases; however, ablation of Ch25h reversed these phenotypes. An anti-hypertensive drug, reserpine, suppressed TEV uptake and disrupted TEV-induced formation of the pre-metastatic niche and melanoma lung metastases. These results suggest the importance of CH25H in defense against education of normal cells by TEV and argue for the use of reserpine in adjuvant melanoma therapy.
Persistent inflammation and extensive immune activation have been associated with HIV-1/SIV pathogenesis. Previously, we reported that cholesterol-25-hydroxylase (CH25H) and its metabolite 25-hydroxycholesterol (25-HC) had a broad antiviral activity in inhibiting Zika, Ebola, and HIV-1 infection. However, the underlying immunological mechanism of CH25H and 25-HC in inhibiting viral infection remains poorly understood. We report here that 25-HC effectively regulates immune responses for controlling viral infection. CH25H expression was interferon-dependent and induced by SIV infection in monkey-derived macrophages and PBMC cells, and 25-HC inhibited SIV infection both in permissive cell lines and primary monkey lymphocytes. 25-HC also strongly inhibited bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated inflammation and restricted mitogen-stimulated proliferation in primary monkey lymphocytes. Strikingly, 25-HC promoted SIV-specific IFN-γ-producing cellular responses, but selectively suppressed proinflammatory CD4+ T lymphocytes secreting IL-2 and TNF-α cytokines in vaccinated mice. In addition, 25-HC had no significant immunosuppressive effects on cytotoxic CD8+ T lymphocytes or antibody-producing B lymphocytes. Collectively, 25-HC modulated both innate and adaptive immune responses toward inhibiting HIV/SIV infection. This study provides insights into improving vaccination and immunotherapy regimes against HIV-1 infection.
Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) is an immunosuppressive pathogen which has been recognized to modulate the host interferon (IFN) systems. Cholesterol-25-hydroxylase (CH25 H) is an important interferon-stimulated gene (ISG)-encoded polytopic membrane protein that significantly inhibits the replication of many viruses. In the current study, we showed that PRRSV infection induced the down-regulation of the endogenous CH25H in porcine alveolar macrophages (PAMs), and then discovered that the nonstructural protein (nsp) 1β and nsp11 of PRRSV could mediate the reduction of porcine CH25H d in HEK 293FT cells. Next, the amino acids including His-159 in nsp1β, and His-129, His-144 and Lys-173 in nsp11 were determined to play crucial roles in the reduction of CH25H. Furthermore, we confirmed that the nsp1β and nsp11 mediated the degradation of CH25H by lysosomal pathway in HEK 293FT cells. Finally, it was demonstrated that the anti-PRRSV activity of CH25H could be antagonized by nsp1β and nsp11 in MARC-145 cells. Our findings suggest a manner of antagonizing the antiviral activity of CH25H by PRRSV, and provide novel insight into the understanding of PRRSV's ability of escaping the innate immunity of host.
Eimeria zuernii and E. bovis are host-specific apicomplexan parasites of cattle causing haemorrhagic typhlocolitis in young animals worldwide. During first merogony, both Eimeria species form giant macromeronts (&gt;300 μm) in host endothelial cells containing &gt;120,000 merozoites I in vivo. During the massive intracellular replication of macromeronts, large amounts of cholesterol and fatty acids are indispensable for enormous merozoite I-derived membrane production. From a metabolic perspective, host endothelial cells might be of advantage to the parasite, as transcription of several genes involved in both, cholesterol de novo biosynthesis and low density lipoprotein (LDL)-mediated uptake, are up-regulated in Eimeria macromeront-carrying host endothelial cells. In order to analyse further influence of E. zuernii/E. bovis infections on the metabolism of cholesterol, fatty acids, and glycolysis of the host endothelial cells, suitable in vitro cell culture systems are necessary. So far, in vitro cell culture systems based on primary bovine umbilical vein endothelial cells (BUVEC) are available for E. bovis-macromeront I formation, but have not been evaluated for E. zuernii. A novel E. zuernii (strain A), initially isolated from naturally infected calves in Antioquia, Colombia, was used for sporozoite isolation. Primary BUVEC monolayers were concomitantly infected with E. zuernii- and E. bovis-sporozoites, resulting in large sized macromeronts whose morphological/morphometric characteristics were compared. BUVEC carrying E. zuernii-macromeronts resulted in the release of viable and highly motile merozoites I. Overall, E. zuernii-merozoites I differed morphologically from those of E. bovis. The new E. zuernii (strain A) will allow detailed in vitro investigations not only on the modulation of cellular cholesterol processing (i. e. cholesterol-25-hydroxylase and sterol O-acyltransferase) but also on the surface expression of LDL receptors during macromeront formation.
Stromal cells (SCs) establish the compartmentalization of lymphoid tissues critical to the immune response. However, the full diversity of lymph node (LN) SCs remains undefined. Using droplet-based single-cell RNA sequencing, we identified nine peripheral LN non-endothelial SC clusters. Included are the established subsets, Ccl19hi T-zone reticular cells (TRCs), marginal reticular cells, follicular dendritic cells (FDCs), and perivascular cells. We also identified Ccl19lo TRCs, likely including cholesterol-25-hydroxylase+ cells located at the T-zone perimeter, Cxcl9+ TRCs in the T-zone and interfollicular region, CD34+ SCs in the capsule and medullary vessel adventitia, indolethylamine N-methyltransferase+ SCs in the medullary cords, and Nr4a1+ SCs in several niches. These data help define how transcriptionally distinct LN SCs support niche-restricted immune functions and provide evidence that many SCs are in an activated state.
This review focuses on research in the areas of epidemiology, neuropathology, molecular biology and genetics that implicates herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) as a causative agent in the pathogenesis of sporadic Alzheimer's disease (AD). Molecular mechanisms whereby HSV-1 induces AD-related pathophysiology and pathology, including neuronal production and accumulation of amyloid beta (Aβ), hyperphosphorylation of tau proteins, dysregulation of calcium homeostasis, and impaired autophagy, are discussed. HSV-1 causes additional AD pathologies through mechanisms that promote neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, mitochondrial damage, synaptic dysfunction, and neuronal apoptosis. The AD susceptibility genes apolipoprotein E (APOE), phosphatidylinositol binding clathrin assembly protein (PICALM), complement receptor 1 (CR1) and clusterin (CLU) are involved in the HSV lifecycle. Polymorphisms in these genes may affect brain susceptibility to HSV-1 infection. APOE, for example, influences susceptibility to certain viral infections, HSV-1 viral load in the brain, and the innate immune response. The AD susceptibility gene cholesterol 25-hydroxylase (CH25H) is upregulated in the AD brain and is involved in the antiviral immune response. HSV-1 interacts with additional genes to affect cognition-related pathways and key enzymes involved in Aβ production, Aβ clearance, and hyperphosphorylation of tau proteins. Aβ itself functions as an antimicrobial peptide (AMP) against various pathogens including HSV-1. Evidence is presented supporting the hypothesis that Aβ is produced as an AMP in response to HSV-1 and other brain infections, leading to Aβ deposition and plaque formation in AD. Epidemiologic studies associating HSV-1 infection with AD and cognitive impairment are discussed. Studies are reviewed supporting subclinical chronic reactivation of latent HSV-1 in the brain as significant in the pathogenesis of AD. Finally, the rationale for and importance of clinical trials treating HSV-1-infected MCI and AD patients with antiviral medication is discussed.
Viruses exploit the host and induce drastic metabolic changes to ensure an optimal environment for replication and the production of viral progenies. In response, the host has developed diverse countermeasures to sense and limit these alterations to combat viral infection. One such host mechanism is through interferon signaling. Interferons are cytokines that enhances the transcription of hundreds of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) whose products are key players in the innate immune response to viral infection. In addition to their direct targeting of viral components, interferons and ISGs exert profound effects on cellular metabolism. Recent studies have started to illuminate on the specific role of interferon in rewiring cellular metabolism to activate immune cells and limit viral infection. This review reflects on our current understanding of the complex networking that occurs between the virus and host at the interface of cellular metabolism, with a focus on the ISGs in particular, cholesterol-25-hydroxylase (CH25H), spermidine/spermine acetyltransferase 1 (SAT1), indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase (IDO1) and sterile alpha motif and histidine/aspartic acid domain-containing protein 1 (SAMHD1), which were recently discovered to modulate specific metabolic events and consequently deter viral infection.
Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA virus of the Arteriviridae family, has become a global health threat for swine. Cholesterol 25-hydroxylase (CH25H) is an enzyme that catalyzes oxidation of cholesterol to 25-hydroxycholesterol (25HC). The purpose of this study was to explore the antiviral activity of CH25H against PRRSV infection. We found that CH25H was induced by interferon-α and PRRSV in Marc-145 monkey kidney cells. In addition, CH25H and 25HC significantly inhibited PRRSV infection by preventing virus entry. A CH25H mutant that exhibited decreased catalytic activity had an antiviral effect against PRRSV. Treatment with 25HC pre-infection or post-infection significantly inhibited PRRSV infection in primary porcine alveolar macrophages. Our results reveal that CH25H is an interferon-stimulated gene and its production of 25HC can be used as a natural antiviral agent to combat PRRSV infection.
Type I interferon restrains interleukin-1β (IL-1β)-driven inflammation in macrophages by upregulating cholesterol-25-hydroxylase (Ch25h) and repressing SREBP transcription factors. However, the molecular links between lipid metabolism and IL-1β production remain obscure. Here, we demonstrate that production of 25-hydroxycholesterol (25-HC) by macrophages is required to prevent inflammasome activation by the DNA sensor protein absent in melanoma 2 (AIM2). We find that in response to bacterial infection or lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation, macrophages upregulate Ch25h to maintain repression of SREBP2 activation and cholesterol synthesis. Increasing macrophage cholesterol content is sufficient to trigger IL-1β release in a crystal-independent but AIM2-dependent manner. Ch25h deficiency results in cholesterol-dependent reduced mitochondrial respiratory capacity and release of mitochondrial DNA into the cytosol. AIM2 deficiency rescues the increased inflammasome activity observed in Ch25h-/-. Therefore, activated macrophages utilize 25-HC in an anti-inflammatory circuit that maintains mitochondrial integrity and prevents spurious AIM2 inflammasome activation.
The behaviors of lymphocytes, including CD4+ T helper cells, are controlled on many levels by internal metabolic properties. Lipid metabolites have recently been ascribed a novel function as immune response modulators and perturbation of steroids pathways modulates inflammation and potentially promotes a variety of diseases. However, the impact of lipid metabolism on autoimmune disease development and lymphocyte biology is still largely unraveled. In this line, oxysterols, oxidized forms of cholesterol, have pleiotropic roles on the immune response aside from their involvements in lipid metabolism. The oxysterols 25-hydroxycholesterol (25-OHC) and 7α,25-dihydroxycholesterol (7α,25-OHC) regulate antiviral immunity and immune cell chemotaxis. However, their physiological effects on adaptive immune response in particular on various subset CD4+ T lymphocytes are largely unknown. Here, we assessed oxysterol levels in subset of CD4+ T cells and demonstrated that 25-OHC and transcript levels of its synthesizing enzyme, cholesterol 25-hydroxylase, were specifically increased in IL-27-induced type 1 regulatory T (TR1) cells. We further showed that 25-OHC acts as a negative regulator of TR1 cells in particular of IL-10 secretion via liver X receptor signaling. Not only do these findings unravel molecular mechanisms accounting for IL-27 signaling but also they highlight oxysterols as pro-inflammatory mediators that dampens regulatory T cell responses and thus unleash a pro-inflammatory response.
Oxysterols are a family of cholesterol oxygenated derivatives with diverse roles in many biological activities and have recently been linked with the induction of a cellular antiviral state. The antiviral effects of 25-hydroxycholesterol (25HC) extend to several mammalian enveloped and non-enveloped viruses. It has been reported that the expression of the gene encoding cholesterol 25-hydroxylase (CH25H) is induced by interferons (IFNs). In this work, five ch25h genes were identified in the zebrafish (Danio rerio) genome. The ch25h genes showed different tissue expression patterns and differed in their expression after immune stimulation with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (PolyI:C) and Spring Viremia Carp Virus (SVCV). Only one of the 5 genes, ch25hb, was overexpressed after the administration of the treatments. Synteny and phylogenetic analyses revealed that ch25hb is the putative homolog of mammalian Ch25h in zebrafish, while the remaining zebrafish ch25h genes are products of duplications within the teleost lineage. Interestingly, its modulation was not mediated by type I IFNs, contrasting previous reports on mammalian orthologs. Nevertheless, in vivo overexpression of ch25hb in zebrafish larvae significantly reduced mortality after SVCV challenge. Viral replication was also negatively affected by 25HC administration to the zebrafish cell line ZF4. In conclusion, the interferon-independent antiviral role of 25HC was extended to a non-mammalian species for the first time, and dual activity that both protects the cells and interacts with the virus cannot be discarded.
Liver X receptor (LXR) is a member of a nuclear receptor family regulating the expression of several key proteins involved in lipid metabolism and inflammation. In contrast to several other nuclear receptors, very little is known about the coactivators needed for the agonist-mediated transactivation by LXR. In this study, we have investigated the role of p160 coactivator complex in the regulation of ATP-binding transporter A1 (ABCA1), a clinically important gene transcriptionally upregulated by LXR/RXR (retinoid X receptor) heterodimer.
Overexpression of LXRalpha, SRC-1, and p300, either alone or in combination, increased the luciferase activity driven by the wild-type ABCA1 promoter. The same coactivators bound to the ABCA1 promoter on oxysterol induction in chromatin immunoprecipitation assays. To the contrary, CARM-1 and P/CAF had no effect on ABCA1 transactivation, nor do they bind the promoter. When the DR-4 element was mutated from the ABCA1 promoter, only p300 was able to activate ABCA1 transcription in a ligand-independent manner.
The p160 coactivator complex members SRC-1 and p300, but not CARM-1 and P/CAF, coactivate LXR-mediated transcription of ABCA1 gene. In addition, p300 activates ABCA1 transcription independently of DR-4 element and LXR/RXR.
The nuclear receptor heterodimers of liver X receptor (LXR) and retinoid X receptor (RXR) are key transcriptional regulators of genes involved in lipid homeostasis and inflammation. We report the crystal structure of the ligand-binding domains (LBDs) of LXRalpha and RXRbeta complexed to the synthetic LXR agonist T-0901317 and the RXR agonist methoprene acid (Protein Data Base entry 1UHL). Both LBDs are in agonist conformation with GRIP-1 peptides bound at the coactivator binding sites. T-0901317 occupies the center of the LXR ligand-binding pocket and its hydroxyl head group interacts with H421 and W443, residues identified by mutational analysis as critical for ligand-induced transcriptional activation by T-0901317 and various endogenous oxysterols. The topography of the pocket suggests a common anchoring of these oxysterols via their 22-, 24- or 27-hydroxyl group to H421 and W443. Polyunsaturated fatty acids act as LXR antagonists and an E267A mutation was found to enhance their transcriptional inhibition. The present structure provides a powerful tool for the design of novel modulators that can be used to characterize further the physiological functions of the LXR-RXR heterodimer.
Fatty acid metabolism is transcriptionally regulated by two reciprocal systems: peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) alpha controls fatty acid degradation, whereas sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c activated by liver X receptor (LXR) regulates fatty acid synthesis. To explore potential interactions between LXR and PPAR, the effect of LXR activation on PPARalpha signaling was investigated. In luciferase reporter gene assays, overexpression of LXRalpha or beta suppressed PPARalpha-induced peroxisome proliferator response element-luciferase activity in a dose-dependent manner. LXR agonists, T0901317 and 22(R)-hydroxycholesterol, dose dependently enhanced the suppressive effects of LXRs. Gel shift assays demonstrated that LXR reduced binding of PPARalpha/retinoid X receptor (RXR) alpha to peroxisome proliferator response element. Addition of increasing amounts of RXRalpha restored these inhibitory effects in both luciferase and gel shift assays, suggesting the presence of RXRalpha competition. In vitro protein binding assays demonstrated that activation of LXR by an LXR agonist promoted formation of LXR/RXRalpha and, more importantly, LXR/PPARalpha heterodimers, leading to a reduction of PPARalpha/RXRalpha formation. Supportively, in vivo administration of the LXR ligand to mice and rat primary hepatocytes substantially decreased hepatic mRNA levels of PPARalpha-targeted genes in both basal and PPARalpha agonist-induced conditions. The amount of nuclear PPARalpha/RXR heterodimers in the mouse livers was induced by treatment with PPARalpha ligand, and was suppressed by superimposed LXR ligand. Taken together with data from the accompanying paper (Yoshikawa, T., T. Ide, H. Shimano, N. Yahagi, M. Amemiya-Kudo, T. Matsuzaka, S. Yatoh, T. Kitamine, H. Okazaki, Y. Tamura, M. Sekiya, A. Takahashi, A. H. Hasty, R. Sato, H. Sone, J. Osuga, S. Ishibashi, and N. Yamada, Endocrinology 144:1240-1254) describing PPARalpha suppression of the LXR-sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c pathway, we propose the presence of an intricate network of nutritional transcription factors with mutual interactions, resulting in efficient reciprocal regulation of lipid degradation and lipogenesis.
The liver X receptors (LXRs) are members of the nuclear receptor superfamily that are activated by oxysterols. In response to ligand binding, LXRs regulate a variety of genes involved in the catabolism, transport, and uptake of cholesterol and its metabolites. Here we demonstrate that LXRs also regulate plasma lipoprotein metabolism through control of the phospholipid transfer protein (PLTP) gene. LXR ligands induce the expression of PLTP in cultured HepG2 cells and mouse liver in vivo in a coordinate manner with known LXR target genes. Moreover, plasma phospholipid transfer activity is increased in mice treated with the synthetic LXR ligand GW3965. Unexpectedly, PLTP expression was also highly inducible by LXR in macrophages, a cell type not previously recognized to express this enzyme. The ability of synthetic and oxysterol ligands to regulate PLTP mRNA in macrophages and liver is lost in animals lacking both LXRalpha and LXRbeta, confirming the critical role of these receptors. We further demonstrate that the PLTP promoter contains a high-affinity LXR response element that is bound by LXR/RXR heterodimers in vitro and is activated by LXR/RXR in transient-transfection studies. Finally, immunohistochemistry studies reveal that PLTP is highly expressed by macrophages within human atherosclerotic lesions, suggesting a potential role for this enzyme in lipid-loaded macrophages. These studies outline a novel pathway whereby LXR and its ligands may modulate lipoprotein metabolism.
SR-BI mediates exchange of cholesterol between HDL and cells, and is a crucial factor in the transport of excessive cellular cholesterol from extrahepatic tissues to the liver ("reverse cholesterol transport") and, therefore, also for cholesterol homeostasis. Hepatic SR-BI mediates transfer of HDL-cholesterol to the hepatocytes where cholesterol may be metabolised to bile acids. LXR and SREBP are key factors in the regulation of cholesterol metabolism. The purpose of the present study was to determine whether these transcription factors are involved in the regulation of SR-BI. Here we show that LXRalpha/RXR and LXRbeta/RXR induce SR-BI transcription in human and murine hepatoma cell lines, and in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes independently of SREBP-1. The LXR/RXR response was mapped within -1,200 to -937 of the promoter region. Gel mobility shift analysis confirmed that the putative LXR response element bound LXRalpha/RXR and LXRbeta/RXR heterodimers.
Dietary cholesterol has been shown to have a stimulatory effect on the murine cholesterol 7alpha-hydroxylase gene (Cyp7a1), but its effect on human cholesterol 7alpha-hydroxylase gene (CYP7A1) expression in vivo is not known. A transgenic mouse strain harboring the human CYP7A1 gene and homozygous for the disrupted murine Cyp7a1 gene was created. Cholesterol feeding increased the expression of the endogenous modified Cyp7a1 allele but failed to stimulate the human CYP7A1 transgene. In transfected hepatoma cells, 25-hydroxycholesterol increased murine Cyp7a1 gene promoter activity, whereas the human CYP7A1 gene promoter was unresponsive. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays demonstrated the interaction of the liver X receptor alpha (LXRalpha): retinoid X receptor (RXR) heterodimer, a transcription factor complex that is activated by oxysterols, with the murine Cyp7a1 gene promoter, whereas no binding to the human CYP7A1 gene promoter was detected. The results demonstrate that the human CYP7A1 gene is not stimulated by dietary cholesterol in the intact animal, and this is attributable to the inability of the CYP7A1 gene promoter to interact with LXRalpha:RXR.
Cholesterol efflux from peritoneal macrophages of mice C57BL/6 susceptible and C3H resistant to atherosclerosis was compared, using apoprotein A-I as acceptor. The elicited macrophages were labeled with 3H-cholesterol and cholesterol enriched by incubation for 24 h with acetylated LDL. After incubation for 6 or 24 h, 3H-cholesterol efflux to free apoA-I (10 microg/ml) was significantly higher with macrophages derived from C3H mice compared to C57BL/6 mice. The cells were also pretreated with 0.3-0.45 mM cyclic AMP, 10 microM 9-cis-retinoic acid or 10 microM 22(R)-hydroxycholesterol, RXR and LXR ligands. Treatment with cyclic AMP, RXR, or LXR ligands, resulted in enhancement of 3H-cholesterol efflux in both strains. Under all conditions, 3H-cholesterol efflux was significantly higher in C3H compared to C57BL/6 macrophages. In conclusion, the higher cholesterol efflux from C3H macrophages could contribute toward the resistance of this strain to diet-induced atherosclerosis despite hypercholesterolemia.
Liver X receptor alpha (LXRalpha), is a nuclear hormone receptor that is activated by oxysterols and plays a crucial role in regulating cholesterol and lipid metabolism in liver and cholesterol efflux from lipid-loaded macrophages. Here we show that treatment of human peripheral blood monocytes or monocytic THP-1 cells with the LXR ligand 22(R)-hydroxycholesterol (22(R)-HC), in combination with 9-cis-retinoic acid (9cRA), a ligand for the LXR heterodimerization partner retinoid X receptor (RXR), results in the specific induction of the potent pro-apoptotic and pro-inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha). Promoter analysis, inhibitor studies, and order-of-addition experiments demonstrated that TNF-alpha induction by 22(R)-HC and 9cRA occurs by a novel two-step process. The initial step involves 22(R)-HC-dependent induction of TNF-alpha mRNA, and intracellular accumulation of TNF-alpha protein, mediated by binding of LXRalpha/RXRalpha to an LXR response element at position -879 of the TNF-alpha promoter. Subsequent cell release of TNF-alpha protein occurs via a separable 9cRA-dependent, LXRalpha-independent step that requires de novo transcription and protein synthesis. Our findings reveal a potentially new dimension of the physiological role of LXRalpha and identify a unique multistep pathway of TNF-alpha production that may be of consequence to the normal function of LXR in monocyte/macrophages and in disease conditions such as atherosclerosis.
Here we report the induction of gene expression of ABCG4, a member of the ABC transporter subfamily G, from human macrophages by oxysterols and retinoids, agonists of the nuclear receptors LXR and RXR. The cloned ABCG4 transcript has a size of 3.5 kb and contains an open reading frame which encodes a polypeptide of 646 amino acids. Structurally, the putative ABC transporter protein consists of a nucleotide binding fold followed by a cluster of six transmembrane-spanning domains and thus conforms to the group of half-size ABC transporters. Among the human ABC transporter subfamily G members the novel transporter shows highest protein sequence homology and identity to ABCG1 (84 and 72%, respectively). Analysis of the genomic organization demonstrates that the ABCG4 gene is composed of at least 14 exons which extend across a region of 12.6 kb in size on chromosome 11q23.3. Based on its structural features and an LXR/RXR-responsive regulation similar to the cellular lipid export protein ABCA1, we conclude that ABCG4 may be involved in macrophage lipid homeostasis.
In an attempt to identify transcription factors which activate sterol-regulatory element-binding protein 1c (SREBP-1c) transcription, we screened an expression cDNA library from adipose tissue of SREBP-1 knockout mice using a reporter gene containing the 2.6-kb mouse SREBP-1 gene promoter. We cloned and identified the oxysterol receptors liver X receptor (LXRalpha) and LXRbeta as strong activators of the mouse SREBP-1c promoter. In the transfection studies, expression of either LXRalpha or -beta activated the SREBP-1c promoter-luciferase gene in a dose-dependent manner. Deletion and mutation studies, as well as gel mobility shift assays, located an LXR response element complex consisting of two new LXR-binding motifs which showed high similarity to an LXR response element recently found in the ABC1 gene promoter, a reverse cholesterol transporter. Addition of an LXR ligand, 22(R)-hydroxycholesterol, increased the promoter activity. Coexpression of retinoid X receptor (RXR), a heterodimeric partner, and its ligand 9-cis-retinoic acid also synergistically activated the SREBP-1c promoter. In HepG2 cells, SREBP-1c mRNA and precursor protein levels were induced by treatment with 22(R)-hydroxycholesterol and 9-cis-retinoic acid, confirming that endogenous LXR-RXR activation can induce endogenous SREBP-1c expression. The activation of SREBP-1c by LXR is associated with a slight increase in nuclear SREBP-1c, resulting in activation of the gene for fatty acid synthase, one of its downstream genes, as measured by the luciferase assay. These data demonstrate that LXR-RXR can modify the expression of genes for lipogenic enzymes by regulating SREBP-1c expression, providing a novel link between fatty acid and cholesterol metabolism.
The human ATP-binding cassette half transporter G1 (hABCG1) may play a role in cholesterol transport in macrophages. Using RACE assays we determined the structure of this gene. The hABCG1 gene spans more than 97 kb comprising 20 exons, 20 kb and 5 exons more than hitherto described. Four of the novel exons are upstream and one is downstream of previous exon 1, and they are predicted to encode at least five novel transcripts. We also detected two separate promoters, upstream of exons 1 and 5, respectively. The region 650 bp upstream of exon 1 was predicted to contain putative binding sites for SP1 and nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB), but no sterol response elements (SREs) or retinoid X receptor (RXR) binding sites. The region 650 bp upstream of exon 5 contained 19 possible SP1 binding sites, one possible SRE, two possible NF-kappaB, and two putative RXR binding sites. Nevertheless, both promoters responded in macrophages to stimulation by hydroxycholesterol and retinoic acid.
Apolipoprotein E (apoE) secreted by macrophages in the artery wall exerts an important protective effect against the development of atherosclerosis, presumably through its ability to promote lipid efflux. Previous studies have shown that increases in cellular free cholesterol levels stimulate apoE transcription in macrophages and adipocytes; however, the molecular basis for this regulation is unknown. Recently, Taylor and colleagues [Shih, S. J., Allan, C., Grehan, S., Tse, E., Moran, C. &amp; Taylor, J. M. (2000) J. Biol. Chem. 275, 31567-31572] identified two enhancers from the human apoE gene, termed multienhancer 1 (ME.1) and multienhancer 2 (ME.2), that direct macrophage- and adipose-specific expression in transgenic mice. We demonstrate here that the nuclear receptors LXRalpha and LXRbeta and their oxysterol ligands are key regulators of apoE expression in both macrophages and adipose tissue. We show that LXR/RXR heterodimers regulate apoE transcription directly, through interaction with a conserved LXR response element present in both ME.1 and ME.2. Moreover, we demonstrate that the ability of oxysterols and synthetic ligands to regulate apoE expression in adipose tissue and peritoneal macrophages is reduced in Lxralpha-/- or Lxrbeta-/- mice and abolished in double knockouts. Basal expression of apoE is not compromised in Lxr null mice, however, indicating that LXRs mediate lipid-inducible rather than tissue-specific expression of this gene. Together with our previous work, these findings support a central role for LXR signaling pathways in the control of macrophage cholesterol efflux through the coordinate regulation of apoE, ABCA1, and ABCG1 expression.
The liver X receptors (LXRs) are members of the nuclear hormone receptor superfamily that are bound and activated by oxysterols. These receptors serve as sterol sensors to regulate the transcription of gene products that control intracellular cholesterol homeostasis through catabolism and transport. In this report, we describe a novel LXR target, the sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c gene (SREBP-1c), which encodes a membrane-bound transcription factor of the basic helix-loop-helix-leucine zipper family. SREBP-1c expression was markedly increased in mouse tissues in an LXR-dependent manner by dietary cholesterol and synthetic agonists for both LXR and its heterodimer partner, the retinoid X receptor (RXR). Expression of the related gene products, SREBP-1a and SREBP-2, were not increased. Analysis of the mouse SREBP-1c gene promoter revealed an RXR/LXR DNA-binding site that is essential for this regulation. The transcriptional increase in SREBP-1c mRNA by RXR/LXR was accompanied by a similar increase in the level of the nuclear, active form of the SREBP-1c protein and an increase in fatty acid synthesis. Because this active form of SREBP-1c controls the transcription of genes involved in fatty acid biosynthesis, our results reveal a unique regulatory interplay between cholesterol and fatty acid metabolism.
Tangier disease, a condition characterized by low levels of high density lipoprotein and cholesterol accumulation in macrophages, is caused by mutations in the ATP-binding cassette transporter ABC1. In cultured macrophages, ABC1 mRNA was induced in an additive fashion by 22(R)-hydroxycholesterol and 9-cis-retinoic acid (9CRA), suggesting induction by nuclear hormone receptors of the liver X receptor (LXR) and retinoid X receptor (RXR) family. We cloned the 5'-end of the human ABC1 transcript from cholesterol-loaded THP1 macrophages. When transfected into RAW macrophages, the upstream promoter was induced 7-fold by 22(R)-hydroxycholesterol, 8-fold by 9CRA, and 37-fold by 9CRA and 22(R)-hydroxycholesterol. Furthermore, promoter activity was increased in a sterol-responsive fashion when cotransfected with LXRalpha/RXR or LXRbeta/RXR. Further experiments identified a direct repeat spaced by four nucleotides (from -70 to -55 base pairs) as a binding site for LXRalpha/RXR or LXRbeta/RXR. Mutations in this element abolished the sterol-mediated activation of the promoter. The results show sterol-dependent transactivation of the ABC1 promoter by LXR/RXR and suggest that small molecule agonists of LXR could be useful drugs to reverse foam cell formation and atherogenesis.
The biochemistry of foreign compound metabolism and the roles played by individual cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes in drug metabolism and in the toxification and detoxification of xenochemicals prevalent in the environment are important areas of molecular pharmacology and toxicology that have been widely studied over the past decade. Important advances in our understanding of the mechanisms through which foreign chemicals impact on these P450-dependent metabolic processes have been made during the past 2 years with several key discoveries relating to the mechanisms through which xenochemicals induce the expression of hepatic P450 enzymes. Roles for three "orphan" nuclear receptor superfamily members, designated CAR, PXR, and PPAR, in respectively mediating the induction of hepatic P450s belonging to families CYP2, CYP3, and CYP4 in response to the prototypical inducers phenobarbital (CAR), pregnenolone 16alpha-carbonitrile and rifampicin (PXR), and clofibric acid (PPAR) have now been established. Two other nuclear receptors, designated LXR and FXR, which are respectively activated by oxysterols and bile acids, also play a role in liver P450 expression, in this case regulation of P450 cholesterol 7alpha-hydroxylase, a key enzyme of bile acid biosynthesis. All five P450-regulatory nuclear receptors belong to the same nuclear receptor gene family (family NR1), share a common heterodimerization partner, retinoid X-receptor (RXR), and are subject to cross-talk interactions with other nuclear receptors and with a broad range of other intracellular signaling pathways, including those activated by certain cytokines and growth factors. Endogenous ligands of each of those nuclear receptors have been identified and physiological receptor functions are emerging, leading to the proposal that these receptors may primarily serve to modulate hepatic P450 activity in response to endogenous dietary or hormonal stimuli. Accordingly, P450 induction by xenobiotics may in some cases lead to a perturbation of endogenous regulatory circuits with associated pathophysiological consequences.
OR1 is a member of the superfamily of steroid/thyroid hormone nuclear receptors and recognizes DNA as a heterodimer with the 9-cis-retinoic acid receptor RXR (retinoid X receptor). The heterodimeric complex has been shown to be transcriptionally activatable by the RXR ligand as well as certain oxysterols via OR1, but to date uniquely also by heterodimerization itself. Recent studies on other members of the superfamily of nuclear receptors have led to the identification of a number of nuclear receptor-interacting proteins that mediate their regulatory effects on transcription. Here, we address the question of involvement of some of these cofactors in the three modes of activation by the OR1/RXRalpha complex. We show that in vitro the steroid receptor coactivator SRC-1 can be recruited by RXRalpha upon addition of its ligand, and to OR1 upon addition of 22(R)-OH-cholesterol, demonstrating that the latter can act as a direct ligand to OR1. Additionally, heterodimerization is sufficient to recruit SRC-1 to OR1/RXRalpha, indicating SRC-1 as a molecular mediator of dimerization-induced activation. In transfection experiments, coexpression of a nuclear receptor-interacting fragment of SRC-1 abolishes constitutive activation by OR1/RXRalpha, which can be restored by over-expression of full-length SRC-1. This constitutes evidence for an in vivo role of SRC-1 in dimerization-induced activation by OR1/RXRalpha. Additionally, we show that the nuclear receptor-interacting protein RIP140 binds in vitro to OR1 and RXRalpha with requirements distinct from those of SRC-1, and that binding of the two cofactors is competitive. Taken together, our results suggest a complex modulation of differentially induced transactivation by OR1/RXR coregulatory molecules.
OR1 is a member of the steroid/thyroid hormone nuclear receptor superfamily which has been described to mediate transcriptional responses to retinoids and oxysterols. On a DR4 response element, an OR1 heterodimer with the nuclear receptor retinoid X receptor alpha (RXR alpha) has been described to convey transcriptional activation in both the absence and presence of the RXR ligand 9-cis retinoic acid, the mechanisms of which have remained unclear. Here, we dissect the effects of RXR alpha and OR1 ligand-binding domain interaction on transcriptional regulation and the role of the respective carboxy-terminal activation domains (AF-2s) in the absence and presence of the RXR ligand, employing chimeras of the nuclear receptors containing the heterologous GAL4 DNA-binding domain as well as natural receptors. The results show that the interaction of the RXR and OR1 ligand-binding domains unleashes a transcription activation potential that is mainly dependent on the AF-2 of OR1, indicating that interaction with RXR activates OR1. This defines dimerization-induced activation as a novel function of heterodimeric interaction and mechanism of receptor activation not previously described for nuclear receptors. Moreover, we present evidence that activation of OR1 occurs by a conformational change induced upon heterodimerization with RXR.
Liver X receptors (LXR) alpha and beta belong to a family of nuclear receptors which form heterodimers with the retinoid X receptor (RXR) and, upon ligand binding, stimulate the expression of target genes. LXR were initially described as orphan receptors and later oxidized cholesterol derivatives (oxysterols) were identified as their natural ligands. In addition, several synthetic LXR agonists such as T0901317 and GW3965 were synthesized. Oxysterols are formed in amounts proportional to cholesterol content in the cell and therefore LXR operate as cholesterol sensors which protect from cholesterol overload by inhibiting intestinal cholesterol absorption, stimulating cholesterol efflux from cells to high-density lipoproteins (HDL), its transport to the liver, conversion to bile acids, and biliary excretion. In addition, LXR agonists activate fatty acid synthesis by stimulating the expression of a lipogenic transcription factor, sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c), leading to the elevation of plasma triglycerides and liver steatosis. Lipogenic effect seems is the most important negative feature of LXR agonists considered as potential hypolipidemic drugs. Some of currently used drugs also affect LXR signaling. For example, statins may impair LXR signaling by inhibiting oxysterol synthesis, whereas fibrates and thiazolidinediones increase LXR expression and activity.
Cholesterol is an essential component of eukaryotic cells; at the same time, however, hyperaccumulation of cholesterol is harmful. Therefore, the ABCA1 gene, the product of which mediates secretion of cholesterol, is highly regulated at both the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels. The transcription of ABCA1 is regulated by intracellular oxysterol concentration via the nuclear liver X receptor (LXR)/retinoid X receptor (RXR); once synthesized, ABCA1 protein turns over rapidly with a half-life of 1-2 h. Here, we show that the LXRbeta/RXR complex binds directly to ABCA1 on the plasma membrane of macrophages and modulates cholesterol secretion. When cholesterol does not accumulate, ABCA1-LXRbeta/RXR localizes on the plasma membrane, but is inert. When cholesterol accumulates, oxysterols bind to LXRbeta, and the LXRbeta/RXR complex dissociates from ABCA1, restoring ABCA1 activity and allowing apoA-I-dependent cholesterol secretion. LXRbeta can exert an immediate post-translational response, as well as a rather slow transcriptional response, to changes in cellular cholesterol accumulation. Thus, we provide the first demonstration that protein-protein interaction suppresses ABCA1 function. Furthermore, we show that LXRbeta is involved in both the transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of the ABCA1 transporter.
The lipid transporter ATP binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) promotes the efflux of cellular phospholipids and cholesterol to lipid-free apolipoprotein A-I and thus initiates the biogenesis of high-density lipoprotein (HDL). The expression of the ABCA1 gene is controlled, coordinately with other genes of HDL metabolism, by liver X receptor/retinoid X receptor (LXR/RXR) heterodimers and their ligands oxysterols and retinoids. In the present study, we show that the oxysterol/retinoid-induced transcription of the ABCA1 gene is modulated by the ubiquitous transcription factor Sp1 that binds to the proximal ABCA1 promoter, adjacently to the LXR/RXR responsive element. The response of the ABCA1 gene to oxysterols/retinoids as well as the ligand-inducible recruitment of Sp1 and RXRalpha/LXRalpha heterodimers to the ABCA1 promoter was blocked by mithramycin A, a well-known Sp1 inhibitor. Using SL2 cells which lack endogenous Sp1, we showed that activation of the ABCA1 promoter by LXRalpha/RXRalpha heterodimers and their ligands requires Sp1. Functional interactions between these factors were demonstrated using the GAL4 transactivation system. Using both in vitro and in vivo assays, we show that physical interactions between Sp1 and LXRalpha require the N-terminal region of LXRalpha, which includes the AF1 and DNA binding domains and two different domains of Sp1: the transactivation domain B and the DNA binding domain. Overall, the present study revealed a novel mechanism of regulation of the human ABCA1 transporter which involves synergistic interactions between oxysterol/retinoid-inducible hormone nuclear receptors and the transcription factor Sp1.
Specific oxysterols have been shown to be pro-osteogenic and anti-adipogenic. However, the molecular mechanism(s) by which oxysterols inhibit adipogenic differentiation is unknown. We show that the anti-adipogenic effects of osteogenic oxysterol, 20(S)-hydroxycholesterol, are mediated through a hedgehog-dependent mechanism(s) and are associated with inhibition of PPARgamma expression.
Multipotent bone marrow stromal cells (MSCs) are common progenitors of osteoblasts and adipocytes. A reciprocal relationship between osteogenic and adipogenic differentiation may explain the increased adipocyte and decreased osteoblast formation in aging and osteoporosis. We have previously reported that specific oxysterols stimulate osteogenic differentiation of MSCs while inhibiting their adipogenic differentiation.
The M2-10B4 (M2) murine pluripotent bone MSC line was used to assess the inhibitory effects of 20(S)-hydroxycholesterol (20S) and sonic hedgehog (Shh) on peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma) and adipogenic differentiation. All results were analyzed for statistical significance using ANOVA.
Treatment of M2 cells with the osteogenic oxysterol 20S completely inhibited adipocyte formation induced by troglitazone after 10 days. PPARgamma mRNA expression assessed by RT-qPCR was significantly induced by Tro after 48 (5-fold) and 96 h (130-fold), and this induction was completely inhibited by 20S. In contrast, 20S did not inhibit PPARgamma transcriptional activity in M2 cells overexpressing PPARgamma and retinoid X receptor (RXR). To elucidate the molecular mechanism(s) by which 20S inhibits PPARgamma expression and adipogenic differentiation, we focused on the hedgehog signaling pathway, which we previously showed to be the mediator of osteogenic responses to oxysterols. The hedgehog signaling inhibitor, cyclopamine, reversed the inhibitory effects of 20S and Shh on troglitazone-induced adipocyte formation in 10-day cultures of M2 cells by 70% and 100%, respectively, and the inhibitory effect of 20S and Shh on troglitazone-induced PPARgamma expression was fully reversed at 48 h by cyclopamine. Furthermore, 20S and Shh greatly inhibited PPARgamma2 promoter activity induced by CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein alpha overexpression. These studies show that, similar to the induction of osteogenesis, the inhibition of adipogenesis in murine MSCs by the osteogenic oxysterol, 20S, is mediated through a hedgehog-dependent mechanism(s).
ATP-binding cassette transporters (ABC) G1 and ABCA1 are membrane cholesterol transporters and have been implicated to mediate cholesterol efflux from cells in the presence of high density lipoproteins and its major protein constituent apolipoprotein A-I, respectively. We previously demonstrated that unsaturated fatty acids suppress the stimulatory effects of oxysterols and retinoids on ABCA1 gene transcription. We here demonstrate that unsaturated fatty acids significantly suppress the stimulatory effects of oxysterols and retinoids on the expression of ABCG1 mRNA and protein and the activity of the wild-type human ABCG1 promoter as well as ABCA1. Mutation or deletion of the DR4 element within the ABCG1 or ABCA1 promoters, to which the transcriptional inducers LXR and RXR bind, abolished the suppressive effects of unsaturated fatty acids. Our observations provide the first evidence that unsaturated fatty acids suppress ABCG1 gene expression by a mechanism which involves the binding of LXR/RXR to the promoters. Suppression of both the ABCA1 and ABCG1 genes may indicate that unsaturated fatty acids suppress not only cholesterol efflux to apoA-I and thereby nascent HDL formation but also HDL-dependent cholesterol efflux from vascular cells.
The cooperation of liver X receptors (LXRs) alpha and beta, and retinoic X receptor (RXR) modulate the expression of several genes involved in lipid metabolism in hepatocyte and macrophages. Using cDNA microarray technology, we have shown previously that several of these genes are also expressed in endothelial cells. In the present study, we investigated whether the activation of LXR and RXR affects the expression of genes involved in lipid metabolism in human endothelial cells. Relative expression of ABCA-1, CETP, SR-B1, EL, LPL, PLTP, ApoE and LDLR was investigated in HUVECs, human fibroblasts (hFB) and HepG2 cells by quantitative real-time PCR. For CETP and EL mRNA expression, the results were HUVECs &gt; hFB &gt; HEPG2; for PLTP, LDLR and LPL: hFB &gt; HUVECs &gt; HEPG2; for SR-B1 and ApoE: HEPG2 &gt; HUVECs &gt; hFB; and for ABCA-1 HEPG2: &gt; hFB &gt; HUVECs. Incubation of HUVECs with LXR agonists as 22-(R)-hydroxycholesterol (22-(R)-HC) or T0901317-induced ABCA1 (20.1- and 17.8-fold), LPL (3.46- and 7.03-fold) and CETP (6.34- and 3.98-fold) expression; EL, LDLR and SR-B1 expression was induced only upon incubation with T0901317 (2.40-, 2.83- and 2.19-fold, respectively) while 22-(R)-HC had no effect on EL and SR-B1 expression (0.8- and 0.9-fold) and decreased LDLR expression (0.4-fold). No effect of either 22-(R)-HC or T0901317 on PLTP and ApoE expression was observed. The RXR agonist, 9-cis retinoic acid (9CRA) alone induced the expression of CETP, LPL and SR-B1 (2.8-, 8.2- and 2.4-fold). No effect of 9CRA on ABCA-1, EL, PLTP, ApoE, and LDLR expression was observed. Association of 9CRA with 22-(R)-HC or T0901317 increased the expression of CETP and LPL while no effect on ABCA-1 or LDLR was observed. Activation of LXRs and RXRs in endothelial cells represents a new target of LXR and RXR agonist in the arterial wall. Modulation of gene expression in the endothelium should be taken into account when studying the effects of LXR and RXR agonists on lipid metabolism in the arterial wall.
The ABC transporter ABCG1 (ATP binding cassette transporter G1), expressed in macrophages, liver, and other tissues, has been implicated in the efflux of cholesterol to high density lipoprotein. The ABCG1 gene is transcriptionally activated by cholesterol loading and activators of liver X receptors (LXRs) and retinoid X receptors (RXRs) through genomic sequences that have not been fully characterized. Here we show that ABCG1 mRNA is induced by LXR agonists in RAW264.7 macrophage cells, HepG2 hepatoma cells, and primary mouse hepatocytes. We identify two evolutionarily highly conserved LXR response elements (LXREs), LXRE-A and LXRE-B, located in the first and second introns of the human ABCG1 gene. Each element conferred robust LXR-agonist responsiveness to ABCG1 promoter-directed luciferase gene constructs in RAW264.7 and HepG2 cells. Overexpression of LXR/RXR activated the ABCG1 promoter in the presence of LXRE-A or LXRE-B sequences. In gel-shift assays, LXR/RXR heterodimers bound to wild-type but not to mutated LXRE-A and LXRE-B sequences. In chromatin immunoprecipitation assays, LXR and RXR were detected at LXRE-A and -B regions of DNA of human THP-1 macrophages. These studies clarify the mechanism of transcriptional upregulation of the ABCG1 gene by oxysterols in macrophages and liver, two key tissues where ABCG1 expression may affect cholesterol balance and atherogenesis.
To study the effect of oxidized low density lipoprotein (ox-LDL) on ATP binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) in THP-1 macrophages.
After exposing the cultured THP-1 macrophages to ox-LDL for different periods, cholesterol efflux was determined by FJ-2107P type liquid scintillator. ABCA1 mRNA and protein level were determined by reverse trancriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Western blot, respectively. The cholesterol level in THP-1 macrophage foam cells was detected by high performance liquid chromatography.
ox-LDL elevated ABCA1 in both protein and mRNA levels and increased apolipoprotein (apo) A-I-mediated cholesterol efflux in a time- and dose-dependent manner. 22(R)-hydroxycholesterol and 9-cis-retinoic acid did significantly increase cholesterol efflux in THP-1 macrophage foam cells (P&lt;0.05), respectively. Both of them further promoted cholesterol efflux (P&lt;0.01). As expected, liver X receptor (LXR) agonist decreased content of esterified cholesterol in the macrophage foam cells compared with control, whereas only a slight decrease of free cholesterol was observed. LXR activity was slightly increased by oxidized LDL by 12 % at 12 h compared with 6 h. However, LXR activity was increased about 1.8 times at 24 h, and oxidized LDL further increased LXR activity by about 2.6 times at 48 h.
ABCA1 gene expression was markedly increased in cholesterol-loaded cells as a result of activation of LXR/RXR. ABCA1 plays an important role in the homeostasis of cholesterol in the macrophages.
The infection and inflammation process is associated with disturbances in lipid and lipoprotein metabolism. The apolipoprotein E (apo E) plays an important role in the lipoprotein metabolism and has been linked to inflammatory disease such as atherosclerosis and Alzheimer disease. An anti-inflammatory effect has also been suggested. The heterodimer nuclear receptor Liver-X-Receptor(alpha)/Retinoid-X-Receptor (LXR(alpha)/RXR) is considered to be a transcription factor for apo E. The aim of this study was to determine whether lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (principal component of the outer membrane Gram-negative bacteria) has an effect on apo E secretion by intestinal mucosa cells, using the Caco-2 cell line. Differentiated Caco-2 cells grown on filter inserts were incubated apically with LPS and/or 25-hydroxycholesterol (25-OH chol) and 9 cis retinoic acid (9cRA), ligands of LXR and RXR, respectively. The apical and basolateral media were separately collected. Apo E was detected by specific antibodies after protein separation by Two-dimensional nondenaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and apo E secreted in the cell culture media was measured by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Apo E mRNA was analyzed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). LXR(alpha) and RXR mass was analyzed by Western Blot. We demonstrate here that CaCo-2 cells secrete apo E, by either apical or basolateral sides, associated with a high-density like lipoprotein, with a stoke's diameter comprised between 7.10 and 8.16 nm. We show that only apical secretion is decreased by LPS in a dose and time dependent manner. This is associated with a decrease in apo E gene expression contrasting with an increase of Il-8, a chemokine factor. Moreover, we demonstrate that only basolateral apo E secretion by CaCo-2 is significantly increased by 25-OH chol and 9cRA while apical secretion remains unchanged. LPS does not decrease the 25-OH chol and 9cRA mediated apo E secretion in basolateral compartment, while apical secretion is diminished under these circumstances. Our results provide evidence for the polarized secretion of apo E by intestinal epithelium. They also demonstrate that apo E secretion by CaCo-2 cell line is decreased by LPS through an LXR(alpha)/RXR independent signaling pathway.
Transcriptional regulation of the ATP-binding cassette transporter (ABCA1) gene is complex. It involves multiple transcription start sites and the binding of several different transcription factors to the ABCA1 promoter region. Cholesterol- and oxysterol-mediated up-regulation of ABCA1 transcription includes the binding of the liver X receptor and retinoid X receptor (LXR/RXR) heterodimer to the DR-4 element of the ABCA1 promoter. In this study we show that another nuclear hormone receptor, thyroid hormone receptor (TR), can suppress ABCA1 transcription. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays using both purified proteins and isolated nuclear extracts from primary human fibroblasts and 293T cells demonstrate that the TR/RXR heterodimer is able to bind to the DR-4 element of the ABCA1 promoter. This binding is also demonstrated in vivo by chromatin immunoprecipitation studies. Luciferase assays from 293T cells transfected with TRbeta or LXRalpha expression plasmids show that TR, together with its ligand T3, suppresses ABCA1 transcriptional activity, even in the presence of LXR-activating oxysterols. Finally, competition between TR/RXR and LXR/RXR heterodimers to suppress or activate ABCA1 transcription is shown to be dynamic and dependent on the amount of nuclear receptor present in the cells. These data identify a novel regulatory mechanism for ABCA1 and suggest new strategies to modify its expression.
The stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHRSP) showed an exaggerated response to a high-fat, high-cholesterol (HFC) diet, and the resulting reactive hypercholesterolemia was suggested to exacerbate the atherogenic process in this rat. We thus performed a quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis on the serum cholesterol level of SHRSP before and after the HFC diet, with the final goal being the identification of the genetic mechanisms of its reactive hypercholesterolemia. Three hundred fifty-eight F2 rats between SHRSP and Wistar-Kyoto rat were employed in the study. The serum cholesterol and apoprotein E were measured before and after 2 wk of feeding with the HFC diet. Multiple QTLs for the basal cholesterol level were identified on chromosomes 1 and 5, whereas those for the postdietary cholesterol level were on chromosomes 7, 15, and 16. The cholesterol QTLs before and after HFC diet did not overlap with one another, implying that the involved metabolic processes were considerably different between the two conditions. Supporting this, VLDL and LDL cholesterol were the major components of the postdietary serum cholesterol, whereas the basal cholesterol level consisted mainly of HDL cholesterol. A substantial difference of the QTLs between males and females was observed, especially after the HFC diet. The QTL on chromosome 15 had an inverse effect on the cholesterol level, suggesting that the congenic substitution of the SHRSP fragment with that of Wistar-Kyoto rats could induce a greater cholesterol level in SHRSP. This observation is significant in establishing a new model for atherosclerosis with hypertension in rats.
Atherosclerosis is a complex disease resulting from the interaction of multiple genes, including those causing dyslipidemia. Relatively few of the causative genes have been identified. Previously, we identified Apoa2 as a major determinant of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels in the mouse model. To identify additional HDL-C level quantitative trait loci (QTLs), while controlling for the effect of the Apoa2 locus, we performed linkage analysis in 179 standard diet-fed F(2) mice derived from strains BALB/cJ and B6.C-H25(c) (a congenic strain carrying the BALB/c Apoa2 allele). Three significant QTLs and one suggestive locus were identified. A female-specific locus mapping to chromosome 6 (Chr 6) also exhibited effects on plasma non-HDL-C, apolipoprotein AII (apoAII), apoB, and apoE levels. A Chr 6 QTL was independently isolated in a related congenic strain (C57BL/6J vs. B6.NODc6: P = 0.003 and P = 0.0001 for HDL-C and non-HDL-C levels, respectively). These data are consistent with polygenic inheritance of HDL-C levels in the mouse model and provide candidate loci for HDL-C and non-HDL-C level determination in humans.
High-density lipoproteins (HDLs) are anti-atherogenic lipoproteins that have a major role in transporting cholesterol from peripheral tissues to the liver, where it is removed. Epidemiologic studies have shown that low levels of high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C) are associated with an increased incidence of coronary heart disease and an increased mortality rate, indicating a protective role of high concentrations of HDL-C against atherogenesis and the development of coronary heart disease. HDL-C level is influenced by several genetic and nongenetic factors. Nongenetic factors include smoking, which has been shown to decrease the HDL-C level. Exercise and alcohol have been shown to increase HDL-C levels. Decreased HDL-C is often associated with other coronary heart disease risk factors such as obesity, hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance, hypertriglyceridemia and hypertension. Although several genes have been identified for rare forms of dyslipidemia, the genes accounting for major variation in HDL-C levels have yet to be identified. Using a multipoint variance components linkage approach, we found strong evidence of linkage (lod score=3.4; P=0.00004) of a quantitative trait locus (QTL) for HDL-C level to a genetic location between markers D9S925 and D9S741 on chromosome 9p in Mexican Americans. A replication study in an independent set of Mexican American families confirmed the existence of a QTL on chromosome 9p.
The amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) technique is a DNA technology that generates the so-called AFLP markers. These markers are genomic restriction fragments detected after two rounds of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) without prior knowledge of nucleotide sequence. Here we describe the first application of the AFLP technique in the rabbit. We have tested two primer combinations. The results obtained with the DNA from rabbits of different breeds justify the conclusion that AFLP analysis is an effective tool for genetic studies in the rabbit. In addition, we contribute to the linkage map of the rabbit by localizing two AFLP markers on rabbit linkage group VI (LG VI). For this purpose the progeny of a IIIVO/JU x [IIIVO/JU x AX/JU]F(1) backcross were genotyped for 12 AFLP markers and 3 LG VI classical markers [one coat color marker (e) and two biochemical markers (Es-1 and Est-2)]. AX/JU is a dietary cholesterol-susceptible (hyperresponding) inbred strain and IIIVO/JU is a dietary cholesterol resistant (hyporesponding) inbred strain. Moreover, it is possible to evoke dietary cholesterol-induced aorta atherosclerosis in a relatively short time period in AX/JU rabbits, in contrast to IIIVO/JU rabbits. A significant cosegregation was found between basal serum HDL cholesterol level (i.e., the level on a low-cholesterol, control diet) and an AFLP marker on LG VI. It is concluded that one or more genes of LG VI are regulating the basal serum HDL cholesterol level in rabbits. Thus the present study with rabbits clearly illustrates the value of AFLP markers for the construction of linkage maps and mapping of quantitative trait loci (QTL).
Serum lipids are associated with many serious cardiovascular diseases and obesity problems. Many quantitative trait loci (QTL) have been reported in the pig mostly for performance traits but very few for the serum lipid traits. In contrast, remarkable numbers of QTL are mapped for serum lipids in humans and mice. Therefore, the objective of this research was to investigate the chromosomal regions influencing the serum level of the total cholesterol (CT), triglyceride (TG), high density protein cholesterol (HDL) and low density protein cholesterol (LDL) in pigs. For this purpose, a total of 330 animals from a Duroc × Pietrain F2 resource population were phenotyped for serum lipids using ELISA and were genotyped by using 122 microsatellite markers covering all porcine autosomes for QTL study in QTL Express. Blood sampling was performed at approximately 175 days before slaughter of the pig.
Most of the traits were correlated with each other and were influenced by average daily gain, slaughter date and age. A total of 18 QTL including three QTL with imprinting effect were identified on 11 different porcine autosomes. Most of the QTL reached to 5% chromosome-wide (CW) level significance including a QTL at 5% experiment-wide (GW) and a QTL at 1% GW level significance. Of these QTL four were identified for both the CT and LDL and two QTL were identified for both the TG and LDL. Moreover, three chromosomal regions were detected for the HDL/LDL ratio in this study. One QTL for HDL on SSC2 and two QTL for TG on SSC11 and 17 were detected with imprinting effect. The highly significant QTL (1% GW) was detected for LDL at 82 cM on SSC1, whereas significant QTL (5% GW) was identified for HDL/LDL on SSC1 at 87 cM. Chromosomal regions with pleiotropic effects were detected for correlated traits on SSC1, 7 and 12. Most of the QTL identified for serum lipid traits correspond with the previously reported QTL for similar traits in other mammals. Two novel QTL on SSC16 for HDL and HDL/LDL ratio and an imprinted QTL on SSS17 for TG were detected in the pig for the first time.
The newly identified QTL are potentially involved in lipid metabolism. The results of this work shed new light on the genetic background of serum lipid concentrations and these findings will be helpful to identify candidate genes in these QTL regions related to lipid metabolism and serum lipid concentrations in pigs.
Plasma HDL cholesterol levels (HDL-C) are an independent predictor of coronary artery disease (CAD). We have completed a genome-wide linkage scan for HDL-C in a US cohort consisting of 388 multiplex families with premature CAD (GeneQuest). The heritability of HDL-C in GeneQuest was 0.37 with gender and age as covariates (P = 5.1 x 10(-4)). Two major quantitative trait loci (QTL) for log-transformed HDL-C adjusted for age and gender were identified onto chromosomes 7p22 and 15q25 with maximum multipoint logarithm of odds (LOD) scores of 3.76 and 6.69, respectively. Fine mapping decreased the 7p22 LOD score to a nonsignificant level of 3.09 and split the 15q25 QTL into two loci, one minor QTL on 15q22 (LOD = 2.73) that spanned the LIPC gene, and the other at 15q25 (LOD = 5.63). A family-based quantitative transmission disequilibrium test (QTDT) revealed significant association between variant rs1800588 in LIPC and HDL-C in the GeneQuest population (P = 0.0067), which may account for the minor QTL on 15q22. The 15q25 QTL is the most significant locus identified for HDL-C to date, and these results provide a framework for the ultimate identification of the underlying HDL-C variant and gene on chromosomes 15q25, which will provide insights into novel regulatory mechanisms of HDL-C metabolism.
A higher incidence of coronary artery disease is associated with a lower level of HDL-cholesterol. We searched for genetic loci influencing HDL-cholesterol in F2 mice from a cross between MRL/MpJ and SM/J mice. Quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping revealed one significant HDL QTL (Apoa2 locus), four suggestive QTL on chromosomes 10, 11, 13, and 18 and four additional QTL on chromosomes 1 proximal, 3, 4, and 7 after adjusting HDL for the strong Apoa2 locus. A novel nonsynonymous polymorphism supports Lipg as the QTL gene for the chromosome 18 QTL, and a difference in Abca1 expression in liver tissue supports it as the QTL gene for the chromosome 4 QTL. Using weighted gene co-expression network analysis, we identified a module that after adjustment for Apoa2, correlated with HDL, was genetically determined by a QTL on chromosome 11, and overlapped with the HDL QTL. A combination of bioinformatics tools and systems genetics helped identify several candidate genes for both the chromosome 11 HDL and module QTL based on differential expression between the parental strains, cis regulation of expression, and causality modeling. We conclude that integrating systems genetics to a more-traditional genetics approach improves the power of complex trait gene identification.
A combined quantitative trait loci (QTL) and microarray-based approach is commonly used to find differentially expressed genes which are then identified based on the known function of a gene in the biological process governing the trait of interest. However, a low cutoff value in individual gene analyses may result in many genes with moderate but meaningful changes in expression being missed.
We modified a gene set analysis to identify intersection sets with significantly affected expression for which the changes in the individual gene sets are less significant. The gene expression profiles in liver tissues of four strains of mice from publicly available microarray sources were analyzed to detect trait-associated pathways using information on the QTL regions of blood concentrations of high density lipoproteins (HDL) cholesterol and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1). Several metabolic pathways related to HDL levels, including lipid metabolism, ABC transporters and cytochrome P450 pathways were detected for HDL QTL regions. Most of the pathways identified for the IGF-1 phenotype were signal transduction pathways associated with biological processes for IGF-1's regulation.
We have developed a method of identifying pathways associated with a quantitative trait using information on QTL. Our approach provides insights into genotype-phenotype relations at the level of biological pathways which may help to elucidate the genetic architecture underlying variation in phenotypic traits.
Global rating of change (GROC) scores provide a means of measuring patients' self-perceived change in health status over time.
The purposes of the study were to examine agreement of GROC ratings between the patient (GROCp) and the treating therapist (GROCt), the impact on the minimal clinically important difference (MCID) estimates by reporting resources, and the relationships between the subjective GROC scores and objective outcome measures.
Data from 52,767 patients with orthopedic lumbar spine impairments treated in 623 outpatient rehabilitation clinics in 34 states (United States) were analyzed. Patient's functional status (FS) before and after the treatment was measured using the Lumbar Computerized Adaptive Testing (LCAT) survey (0-100 scale). The GROC ratings were obtained from both the patients and their caring therapists at discharge.
On average, GROCp (mean [(SD] = 3.1 [4.1]) was 1.9 points lower than GROCt (mean [SD] = 5.0 [1.9]). There were negligible differences between MCID estimates derived from the patients' GROC ratings (MCID cutoff = 9.2) and from the therapists' GROC ratings (MCID cutoff = 9.5). While only analyzing patient data whose GROCp ≥ 0, the intraclass correlation coefficient between GROCp and GROCt was 0.61, the GROCp correlated with FS at intake at r = 0.12, with FS at discharge at r = 0.56, and with FS change scores at r = 0.47.
Therapists tended to report higher GROC ratings than their patients did but there were negligible differences between MCID estimates derived from GROCp and that derived from GROCt.
Plant-based natural extracts cure several diseases in human. However, the extract of Psidium guajava leaf is not yet evaluated on changes of lipid profile in hepatic disease affected rats.
The present study was aimed to evaluate the mitigation effect of the ethanolic extract of P. guajava leaf and its isolated quercetin fraction on hepatotoxic rats.
Carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) was injected to rats for hepatic disease induction and silymarin drug was used as positive control to compare plant ethanolic extract. The lipid profiles were assessed in both plasma and liver tissue of diseased and control rats.
Levels of total cholesterol, triglycerides, free fatty acids, phospholipids, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol were increased and the level of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) was decreased in CCl4-induced hepatotoxic rats. The treatment of P. guajava (100, 200, and 300 mg/kg, bw) and isolated quercetin fraction (20 mg/kg, bw) doses decreased the elevated levels of all these parameters in diseased rats and restored the normal concentration of HDL-C.
The results of the present study concluded that the P. guajava leaf and its isolated quercetin fraction can significantly regulate lipid metabolism in CCl4-induced hepatotoxic rats and decrease the disease rate.
Psidium guajava leaf extract reduces the hepatotoxicity and disease rate in ratsQuercetin fraction of leaf extract significantly regulates lipid profile in hepatic diseased rats. Abbreviations used: CCl4: Carbon tetrachloride; FFA: Free fatty acids; HDL-C: High-density lipoprotein cholesterol; LCAT: Lecithin cholesterol acyltransferase; LDL-C: Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol; PL: Phospholipids; TC: Total cholesterol; TG: Triglycerides; VLDL-C: Very low-density lipoprotein cholesterol.
We evaluated whether CETP and LCAT gene polymorphisms are statistically associated with the high-density lipoprotein (HDL) size distribution, the cholesterol level of HDL subclasses, and the acute coronary syndrome (ACS) susceptibility. Two CETP gene polymorphisms (rs4783961 and rs708272) and one LCAT polymorphism (rs2292318) were genotyped by 5' exonuclease TaqMan assays in 619 patients with ACS and 607 control individuals. For HDL analysis, a subgroup of 100 healthy individuals was recruited; the HDL subclasses were separated via ultracentrifugation and polyacrylamide gradient gel electrophoresis under native conditions. Under a dominant model, the G allele of the rs708272 polymorphism was associated with an increased risk of ACS (odds ratios [OR] = 1.45, corrected p-value [pCDom ] = 0.036). The linkage disequilibrium analysis showed that one of the eight possible combinations was associated with the risk of developing ACS (OR = 1.52, pC = 0.02), which suggests that it may contribute to coronary atherosclerosis. The rs708272 G allele carriers had a lower concentration of cholesterol associated with the HDL2a and HDL3a subclasses when compared with subjects carrying the A allele. Carriers of LCAT rs2292318 A allele showed a lower concentration of high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C) in comparison to the GG genotype; the cholesterol associated with the each one of the five HDL subclasses was significantly lower in rs2292318 A than in GG subjects. In summary, this study demonstrates that the rs708272 polymorphism is associated with a heightened risk of developing ACS. In addition, we report the association of the rs708272 and rs2292318 polymorphisms with HDL-C levels and HDL subclasses.
The "HDL hypothesis" supporting that an elevation in HDL cholesterol (HDL-C) levels by drugs or by life style changes should be paralleled by a decrease in the risk for Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) has been challenged by recent epidemiological and clinical studies using HDL-raising drugs. HDL components such as proteins, lipids or small RNA molecules, but not cholesterol itself, possess various atheroprotective functions in different cell types and accumulating evidence supports the new hypothesis that HDL functionality is more important than HDL-C levels for CVD risk prediction. Thus, the detailed characterization of changes in HDL composition and functions in various pathogenic conditions is critically important in order to identify new biomarkers for diagnosis, prognosis and therapy monitoring of CVD. Here we provide an overview of how HDL composition, size and functionality are affected in patients with monogenic disorders of HDL metabolism due to mutations in genes that participate in the biogenesis and the remodeling of HDL. We also review the findings from various mouse models with genetic disturbances in the HDL biogenesis pathway that have been generated for the validation of the data obtained in human patients and how these models could be utilized for the evaluation of novel therapeutic strategies such as the use of adenovirus-mediated gene transfer technology that aim to correct HDL abnormalities.
Egress is a crucial phase of the Toxoplasma gondii intracellular lytic cycle. This is a process that drives inflammation and is strongly associated with the pathogenesis observed during toxoplasmosis. Despite the link between this process and virulence, little is known about egress on a mechanistic or descriptive level. Previously published work has suggested that a phospholipase, lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT), secreted from the parasite's dense granules contributes to parasite growth, virulence, and egress. Here we present evidence from several independent mutant parasite lines confirming a role for LCAT in efficient egress, although no defects in growth or virulence were apparent. We also show via genetic complementation that the catalytic activity of LCAT is required for its role in parasite egress. This work solidifies the contribution of LCAT to egress of T. gondii tachyzoites. IMPORTANCEToxoplasma gondii is one of the most successful human pathogens, infecting an estimated 2.5 billion people across the globe. Pathogenesis seen during acute or reactivated toxoplasmosis has been closely tied to the parasite's intracellular lytic life cycle, which culminates in an event called egress that results in the release of freshly replicated parasites from the infected host cell. Despite the highly destructive, cytolytic nature of this event and its downstream consequences, very little is known about how the parasite accomplishes this step. Previous work has suggested a role for a secreted phospholipase, LCAT, in Toxoplasma egress and roles in cell traversal and egress in the Plasmodium species orthologue. We confirm here that LCAT-deficient tachyzoites are unable to efficiently egress from infected monolayers, and we provide evidence that LCAT catalytic activity is required for its role in egress.
Fish by-products valorization on account of their richness in bioactive compounds may represent a better alternative to marine products with a view to economic profitability and sustainable development. In this study, we compared the effect of sardine by-product proteins (SBy-P), with those of the fillets (SF-P) or casein (Cas), on growth parameters, serum leptin level, lipids disorders, lipid peroxidation and reverse cholesterol transport, in diet-induced obese rats.
Obesity was induced by feeding rats a high-fat diet (20% sheep fat), during 12 weeks. At body weight (BW) of 400 ± 20 g, eighteen obese rats were divided into three homogenous groups and continue to consume the high-fat diet for 4 weeks containing either, 20% SBy-P, SF-P or Cas.
The results showed that SBy-P, compared to SF-P and Cas, efficiently reduced food intake (FI), BW gain and serum leptin level, and improved blood lipids levels and reverse cholesterol transport by reducing total cholesterol (TC), triacylglycerols (TG) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-HDL1-C) serum levels, increasing the level of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL2-C and HDL3-C), and enhancing lecithin: cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) activity. Furthermore, they attenuated lipid peroxidation by increasing atheroprotective activity of the paraoxonase-1 (PON-1).
Sardine by-product proteins due to their richness in certain essential amino acids, highlight weight-loss, lipid-lowering, antioxidant and anti-atherogenic potentials, contributing to the improvement of the complications associated with obesity.
Naringin, a citrus-derived flavonoid with antihyperglycemic, antihyperlipidemic, and antioxidant properties, is reported to be a useful nutraceutical in the management of diabetes and its complications. This study investigated the mechanism of antiatherogenic properties of naringin in type 2 diabetes (T2DM) using high fat-low streptozocin rat model of T2DM. Rats were treated daily with 50, 100 and 200 mg/kg naringin orally for 21days. Levels of biomarkers of T2DM, lipid profile and activity of paraoxonase (PON) were assayed spectrophotometrically. The levels of expression of hepatic 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA reductase (Hmgcr), scavenger receptor class B member 1 (Scarb1), aryl hydrocarbon receptor (Ahr), hepatic Lipase (Lipc), and lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase (Lcat) were assessed using relative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction technique. Naringin treatment resulted in a dose-dependent significant (p &lt; 0.05) decrease in the levels of plasma cholesterol and triglyceride from 84.84 ± 1.62 to 55.59 ± 1.50 mg/dL and 123.03 ± 15.11 to 55.00 ± 0.86 mg/dL, respectively, at 200 mg/kg naringin. In the liver, Scarb1 and Ahr were significantly (p &lt; 0.05) upregulated at 200 mg/kg naringin while Lipc and Lcat were significantly (p &lt; 0.05) upregulated by 50 mg/kg naringin. T2DM-induced decrease in PON activities in the plasma, liver and HDL was significantly (p &lt; 0.05) reversed by 200 mg/kg naringin treatment. These genes play critical roles in reverse cholesterol transport and hence our results showed that the antiatherogenic property of naringin in T2DM involves enhancement of reverse cholesterol transport and PON activity.
Lecithin cholesterol acyltyransferase (LCAT) deficiency is a rare monogenic disorder causing lipoprotein dysregulation and multiple organ dysfunctions, including renal impairment. LCAT knockout mice have been shown informative in elucidating mechanisms of many major clinical morbid phenotypes. Extended characterization of the LDL receptor/LCAT double knockout (Ldlr/Lcat-DKO or DKO) mice had led to the discovery of a number of novel protective metabolic phenotypes, including resistance to obesity, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and insulin resistance. We seek to integrate the findings to explore novel pathogenic pathways.
The chow fed DKO mice were found more insulin sensitive than their Ldlr-KO controls. Joint analyses of the three strains (DKO, Ldlr-KO and wild-type) revealed differential metabolic responses to a high cholesterol diet (HCD) vs. high-fat diet (HFD). DKO mice are protected from HFD-induced obesity, hepatic endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, insulin resistance, ER cholesterol and NASH markers (steatosis and inflammasomes). Joint analysis revealed the HFD-induced NASH is dependent on de-novo hepatic cholesterol biosynthesis. DKO mice are protected from HCD-induced hepatic ER stress, ER cholesterol, but not NASH, the latter likely due to cholesterol crystal accumulation. DKO mice were found to develop ectopic brown adipose tissue (BAT) in skeletal muscle. Ectopic BAT derived in part from myoblast in utero and from adult satellite cells. Primed expression of PRDM16 and UCP in quiescent satellite cell caused by LCAT deficiency synergizes with cell cholesterol depletion to induce satellite cell-to-BAT transdifferentiation.
Metabolic phenotyping of selective LCAT null mice led to the discovery of novel metabolically protective pathways.
Kenaf is one of the important commercial fiber crops worldwide and defatted kenaf seed meal (DKSM) is a secondary by-product from the kenaf industry. Thus, efforts to turn this low-cost agricultural waste into value-added functional food ingredients will definitely bring advantageous impacts to the community health, environment and economy. The present study was aimed to investigate the cardioprotective properties of DKSM and its phenolics-saponins rich extract (PSRE) in diet-induced hypercholesterolemic rat model. Hypercholesterolemia was induced in Sprague-Dawley rats via atherogenic diet feeding and dietary interventions were conducted by incorporating DKSM (15% and 30%) and equivalent levels of PSRE (2.3% and 4.6%, respectively, equivalent to the total content of phenolics and saponins in DKSM groups) into the atherogenic diets. After 10 weeks of DKSM and PSRE supplementation, the hepatosomatic index, hepatosteatosis, serum lipid profile, Castelli risk indexes as well as hepatic and renal functions of hypercholesterolemic rats were significantly improved (p &lt; 0.05). Besides, the levels of hepatic Hmgcr and serum Pcsk9 were lowered, along with transcriptional upregulations of hepatic Cyp7a1, Abca1, Lcat, ApoA2 and ApoE (p &lt; 0.05). The gene expression of hepatic Ldlr was marginally enhanced by DKSM supplementation (p &gt; 0.05), but superiorly upregulated by PSRE (p &lt; 0.05). The combined results showed that hypercholesterolemia and the atherogenic risk in rats were effectively attenuated by DKSM and PSRE supplementation, possibly via modulations of multiple vital processes in hepatic cholesterol metabolism. Furthermore, phenolics and saponins may be the bioactives conferring DKSM and PSRE with their anti-hypercholesterolemic properties. In conclusion, DKSM and PSRE are prospective cardioprotective functional food ingredients for hypercholesterolemic individuals.
In adult liver transplant recipients, coronary artery disease and congestive heart failure are significant cause of morbidity and mortality. This may be attributed to the long-term immunosuppressive treatment, mostly with calcineurin inhibitors and steroids, which in long-term may be associated with hyperlipidemia, oxidative stress and cardiovascular complications. Since such data for children is sparse, the aim of this study was to assess the lipid and oxidative stress markers after pediatric liver transplantation (LTx).
We performed prospective analysis of 74 children, at the median age of 7.9 (2.8-11.6) years, 3.2 (1.2-4.3) years after LTx. We assessed the BMI Z-scores, cholesterol fractions (LDLc, HDLc, VLDLc), triglicerides, apolipoproteins (ApoAI, ApoB, ApoE), LCAT, insulin resistance by HOMA-IR and markers of oxidative stress and atherosclerosis: glutathione (GSH), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), asymmetrical dimethyl arginine (ADMA) and oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxyLDL). At baseline, the results were compared with a healthy age-and-sex matched control group. After 3.1±0.3 year follow-up we repeated all investigations and compared them with the baseline results.
At the baseline, we investigated 74 patients 3.2 (1.2-4.3) years after LTx, at the median age of 7.9 (2.8-11.6) years. The prevalence of overweight or obesity (BMI &gt;85th percentile) was 23% and was more common in girls (24% vs 20%). Fourteen patients had TCH &gt;200 mg%, 9 patients had LDLc &gt;130 mg% and TG were at normal levels in all patients. Compared to the controls, there were no significant differences in lipid profiles but we found decreased GSH (p&lt;0.001) and GPx (p&lt;0.001) which play role as an antioxidant defense. OS markers were higher in the study group: ADMA (p&lt;0.001), and oxyLDL (p&lt;0.0001). Insulin resistance by HOMA-IR was increased in the study group (p=0.0002) but fasting glucose remained within normal ranges in all patients. After 3.1-year follow-up, the BMI &gt;95th and &gt;85Th percentile was present in 8% and 14% respectively. ADMA and oxyLDL decreased, whilst GSH and GPx increased when compared to the baseline. There was also significant decrease in apoB and Lp(a).
Children after LTx had normal lipid profiles when compared to controls, however there is a tendency for hypercholesterolemia and obesity, which may play a role in cardiovascular complications in the future. Some markers of oxidative stress were increased after LTx, however further investigations are required to establish its clinical significance.
In this review, we focus on the pathway of biogenesis of HDL, the essential role of apoA-I, ATP binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1), and lecithin: cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) in the formation of plasma HDL; the generation of aberrant forms of HDL containing mutant apoA-I forms and the role of apoA-IV and apoE in the formation of distinct HDL subpopulations. The biogenesis of HDL requires functional interactions of the ABCA1 with apoA-I (and to a lesser extent with apoE and apoA-IV) and subsequent interactions of the nascent HDL species thus formed with LCAT. Mutations in apoA-I, ABCA1 and LCAT either prevent or impair the formation of HDL and may also affect the functionality of the HDL species formed. Emphasis is placed on three categories of apoA-I mutations. The first category describes a unique bio-engineered apoA-I mutation that disrupts interactions between apoA-I and ABCA1 and generates aberrant preβ HDL subpopulations that cannot be converted efficiently to α subpopulations by LCAT. The second category describes natural and bio-engineered apoA-I mutations that generate preβ and small size α4 HDL subpopulations, and are associated with low plasma HDL levels. These phenotypes can be corrected by excess LCAT. The third category describes bio-engineered apoA-I mutations that induce hypertriglyceridemia that can be corrected by excess lipoprotein lipase and also have defective maturation of HDL. The HDL phenotypes described here may serve in the future for diagnosis, prognoses and potential treatment of abnormalities that affect the biogenesis and functionality of HDL.
Elevated high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels in the blood (HDL-C) represent one of the strongest epidemiological surrogates for protection against coronary heart disease (CHD), but recent human genetic and pharmacological intervention studies have raised controversy about the causality of this relationship. Here, we review recent discoveries from human genome studies using new analytic tools as well as relevant animal studies that have both addressed, and in some cases, fueled this controversy.
Methodologic developments in genotyping and sequencing, such as genome-wide association studies (GWAS), exome sequencing, and exome array genotyping, have been applied to the study of HDL-C and risk of CHD in large, multi-ethnic populations. Some of these efforts focused on population-wide variation in common variants have uncovered new polymorphisms at novel loci associated with HDL-C and, in some cases, CHD risk. Other efforts have discovered loss-of-function variants for the first time in genes previously implicated in HDL metabolism through common variant studies or animal models. These studies have allowed the genetic relationship between these pathways, HDL-C and CHD to be explored in humans for the first time through analysis tools such as Mendelian randomization. We explore these discoveries for selected key HDL-C genes CETP, LCAT, LIPG, SCARB1, and novel loci implicated from GWAS including GALNT2, KLF14, and TTC39B. Recent human genetics findings have identified new nodes regulating HDL metabolism while reshaping our current understanding of known candidate genes to HDL and CHD risk through the study of critical variants across model systems. Despite their effect on HDL-C, variants in many of the reviewed genes were found to lack any association with CHD. These data collectively indicate that HDL-C concentration, which represents a static picture of a very dynamic and heterogeneous metabolic milieu, is unlikely to be itself causally protective against CHD. In this context, human genetics represent an extremely valuable tool to further explore the biological mechanisms regulating HDL metabolism and investigate what role, if any, HDL plays in the pathogenesis of CHD.
Lipid and lipoprotein subclasses are associated with metabolic and cardiovascular diseases, yet the genetic contributions to variability in subclass traits are not fully understood. We conducted single-variant and gene-based association tests between 15.1M variants from genome-wide and exome array and imputed genotypes and 72 lipid and lipoprotein traits in 8,372 Finns. After accounting for 885 variants at 157 previously identified lipid loci, we identified five novel signals near established loci at HIF3A, ADAMTS3, PLTP, LCAT, and LIPG. Four of the signals were identified with a low-frequency (0.005&lt;minor allele frequency [MAF]&lt;0.05) or rare (MAF&lt;0.005) variant, including Arg123His in LCAT. Gene-based associations (P&lt;10-10) support a role for coding variants in LIPC and LIPG with lipoprotein subclass traits. 30 established lipid-associated loci had a stronger association for a subclass trait than any conventional trait. These novel association signals provide further insight into the molecular basis of dyslipidemia and the etiology of metabolic disorders.
Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is a growing concern for health workers. The two major components of dyslipidemia in HIV infected patients are hypertriglyceridemia and decreased levels of high density lipoprotein (HDL) which contribute to increased atherosclerotic risk. The study included 150 newly diagnosed HIV patients and 150 healthy controls. In all these cases Lecithin cholesterol acyl transferase (LCAT) activity was assessed by measuring the difference between esterified and free cholesterol by digitonin precipitation method and levels of Apolipoprotein A-I (apo A-I) were measured by immunoturbidimetric method. There was a significantly decreased LCAT activity (p &lt; 0.05) as well as reduced levels of apo A-I (p &lt; 0.05) in newly diagnosed HIV patients (54.98 ± 3.44 IU/L and 131.85 ± 8.49 mg/dl) when compared with healthy controls (88.17 ± 14.36 IU/L and 187.05 ± 35.25 mg/dL). A significant positive correlation (r = 0.7406) was found between LCAT activity and apo A-I levels. In conclusion decreased LCAT activity and decreased levels of apo A-I reduce the reverse cholesterol transport in newly diagnosed HIV patients which may lead to atherosclerosis in the future.
Familial lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase deficiency (FLD) is a rare recessive disorder of cholesterol metabolism, caused by loss-of-function mutations in the human LCAT gene, leading to alterations in the lipid/lipoprotein profile, with extremely low HDL levels.The classical FLD phenotype is characterized by diffuse corneal opacification, haemolytic anaemia and proteinuric chronic kidney disease (CKD); an incomplete form, only affecting the corneas, has been reported in a few families worldwide.We describe an intermediate phenotype of LCAT deficiency, with CKD preceding the development of corneal clouding, in two Portuguese brothers apparently homozygous for a novel missense LCAT gene mutation. The atypical phenotype, the diagnosis of membranous nephropathy in the proband's native kidney biopsy, the late-onset and delayed recognition of the corneal opacification, the co-segregation with Gilbert syndrome and the late recurrence of the primary disease in kidney allograft all contributed to obscure the diagnosis of an LCAT deficiency syndrome for many years.A major teaching point is that on standard light microscopy examination the kidney biopsies of patients with LCAT deficiency with residual enzyme activity may not show significant vacuolization and may be misdiagnosed as membranous nephropathy. The cases of these two patients also illustrate the importance of performing detailed physical examination in young adults presenting with proteinuric CKD, as the most important clue to the diagnosis of FLD is in the eyes.
In this study, alterations in lipid metabolism associated with acute aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) induced hepatotoxicity and gene expression changes underlying these effects were investigated. Rats were orally administered three doses (0.25 mg/kg, 0.5 mg/kg and 1.0 mg/kg) of AFB1 for seven days; after which blood was collected and liver excised. Lipid profiles of plasma and liver were determined spectrophotometrically while the expression of genes associated with lipid and lipoprotein metabolism was assayed by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. Acute exposure to AFB1 increased the levels of plasma and liver cholesterol, triglycerides and phospholipids. AFB1 at 0.5 mg/kg and 1.0 mg/kg resulted in a dose-dependent (1.2 and 1.5 fold, respectively) downregulation of hepatic Cpt1a with a concomitant 1.2 and 1.5 fold increase in the level of plasma FFA, respectively. A similar observation of 1.2 and 1.3 fold increase was also observed in plasma triglyceride concentration, at both respective doses. AFB1 also decreased the relative expression of Ahr, Lipc and Lcat whereas, it upregulated Scarb1 in a dose dependent manner. AFB1-induced dysregulation of the expression of lipid and lipoprotein metabolizing genes may be one mechanism linking AFB1 to altered lipid metabolism and ultimately risk for coronary heart disease.
A patient from Romania with extraordinarily high total cholesterol levels and clinical and biochemical features consistent with familial lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase deficiency is reported. The genetic analysis performed on our proband showed a novel homozygous mutation on codon 119 of lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase gene that causes the substitution of glycine by aspartate. The same mutation, also in homozygosis, was observed in her older sister, whereas his brother presented it in heterozygosis.
Nephrotic syndrome is defined by nephrotic-range proteinuria (≥40 mg/m2/hour or urine protein/creatinine ratio ≥200 mg/mL or 3+ protein on urine dipstick), hypoalbuminaemia (&lt;25 g/L) and oedema. This review focuses on the classification, epidemiology, pathophysiology, management strategies and prognosis of idiopathic nephrotic syndrome of childhood, and includes a brief overview of the congenital forms.
Dyslipidemias are common disorders that predispose individuals to severe diseases. It is known that healthy living habits can prevent dyslipidemias if they are diagnosed properly. Therefore, biomarkers that assist in diagnosis are essential. The aim of this study was to identify biomarkers of dyslipidemia progression, which in turn disclose its etiology. These findings will pave the way for examinations of the regulatory mechanisms involved in dyslipidemias. Hamsters were fed either a normal-fat diet (NFD) or a high-fat diet. Some of the NFD-fed animals were further treated with the hyperlipidemic agent Poloxamer 407. Non-targeted metabolomics was used to investigate progressive changes in unknown serum metabolites. The hepatic expression of putative biomarker-related genes was also analyzed. The serum levels of lysophospholipids (Lyso-PLs) and their related enzymes lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT), secreted phospholipase A2 (sPLA2) and paraoxonase-1 were altered in dyslipidemic hamsters. Lysophosphatidylcholine levels were increased in diet-induced dyslipidemic groups, whereas lysophosphatidylethanolamine levels increased in response to the chemical treatment. The liver was significantly involved in regulating the levels of these molecules, based on the modified expression of endothelial lipase (Lipg), sPLA2 (Pla2g2a) and acyltransferases (Lcat and Lpcat3). We concluded that Lyso-PL evaluation could aid in the comprehensive diagnosis and management of lipid disorders.
Familial hypercholesterolemia, represents one of the most extreme clinical entities associated with premature coronary artery disease (CAD). However, clinical manifestation of CAD varies across cohorts and individual patients suggesting the existence of additional non-LDL factors potentially contributing to their cardiovascular burden.
Changes in HDL-associated proteins appear as one of the potential additional factors contributing to the cardiovascular risk in familial hypercholesterolemia. Specifically, the content of Apo M-SP1 in HDL3 has been directly associated with cholesterol efflux capacity. In addition, a coordinated decrease in the content of Apo L1 and LCAT in HDL3 has been related to the presence of corneal arcus and to bad prognosis in familial hypercholesterolemia patients after an acute ischemic event. In fact, HDL3 particles of familial hypercholesterolemia patients have diminished antioxidant and anti-inflammatory function.
The identification of the specific changes in HDL-associated proteins that contribute to the increased cardiovascular risk of familial hypercholesterolemia patients could be useful for the development of novel therapeutic targets. These novel strategies, in combination with current lipid-lowering therapies, may help to reduce the residual risk found in these patients.
Plasma lipids have been extensively studied in sedentary and in subjects practicing exercise training, but not in extreme inactivity as occurs in bedridden patients. This is important for the care of bedridden patients and understanding the overall plasma lipid regulation. Here, we investigated plasma lipids, lipid transfers to HDL and inflammatory markers in bedridden patients. Fasting blood samples were collected from 23 clinically stable bedridden patients under long-term care (&gt;90 days) and 26 normolipidemic sedentary subjects, paired for age and gender. In vitro transfer of four lipids to HDL was performed by incubating plasma with donor nanoparticles containing radioactive lipids. Total (193 ± 36 vs 160 ± 43, p = 0.005), LDL (124 ± 3 vs 96 ± 33 p = 0.003) and HDL-cholesterol (45 ± 10 vs 36 ± 13, p = 0.008), apolipoprotein A-I (134 ± 20 vs 111 ± 24, p = 0.001) and oxidized LDL (53 ± 13 vs 43 ± 12, p = 0.011) were lower in bedridden patients, whereas triglycerides, apolipoprotein B, CETP and LCAT were equal in both groups. Transfers of all lipids, namely unesterified cholesterol, cholesterol esters, triglycerides and phospholipids, to HDL were lower in bedridden patients, probably due to their lower HDL-cholesterol levels. Concentrations of IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, HGF and NGF were higher in bedridden patients compared to sedentary subjects. In conclusion, inactivity had great impact on HDL, by lowering HDL-cholesterol, apolipoprotein A-I and thereby cholesterol transfers to the lipoprotein, which suggests that inactivity may deteriorate HDL protection beyond the ordinary sedentary condition.
Numerous applications in biology and medicine require the efficient and reliable separation of cells for disease diagnosis, genetic analysis, drug screening, and therapeutics. In this work, we demonstrate a novel technology that integrates a passive and an active device to separate, enrich and release cells on-demand from a complex blood sample, or cancer cells derived from a tissue biopsy. We exploit the high throughput (&gt;1 mL min-1), size-based sorting capability of the passive spiral inertial microfluidic (iMF) device to focus particles/cells towards an active lateral cavity acoustic transducer (LCAT) device for size-selective enrichment. We demonstrate that this platform is capable of efficiently (&gt;90%) removing smaller cells, such as RBCs in a blood sample or smaller cancer cells in a heterogeneous cell line, and providing 44 000× enrichment from the remaining sample within 5 min of device operation. Finally, we use this platform for two applications: selective enrichment of the side-population of DU-145 cells from tissue biopsy and isolation of larger monocytes from blood. Our platform integrates the high throughput (processing rate) capacity of spiral iMF with the high selectivity of LCAT, thereby offering a unique route for highly-selective, label-free particle/cell sorting, with potential application in lab-on-chip platforms for liquid biopsy and diagnostics applications.
HDL plays crucial roles at multiple stages of the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a therapeutic candidate for the treatment of cardiovascular disease. However, the effect of AMPK activation on HDL functionality has not been established in vivo. We assessed the effects of pharmacological AMPK activation using A-769662, AICAR, metformin, and IMM-H007 on the atheroprotective functions of HDL in apoE-deficient (apoE-/-) mice fed with a high-fat diet. After administration, there were no changes in serum lipid levels among the groups. However, mice treated with AMPK activators showed significantly enhanced reverse cholesterol transport in vivo and in vitro. AMPK activation also increased the expression of ABCA1 and ABCG1 in macrophages and scavenger receptor class B type I and LCAT in the liver. HDL from AMPK activation mice exhibited lower HDL inflammatory index and myeloperoxidase activity and higher paraoxonase 1 activity than HDL from untreated mice, implying superior antioxidant and anti-inflammatory capacities. Pharmacological AMPK activation also induced polarization of macrophages to the M2 state and reduced plasma lipid peroxidation, inflammatory cytokine production, and atherosclerotic plaque formation in apoE-/- mice. These observations suggest that pharmacological AMPK activation enhances the anti-atherogenic properties of HDL in vivo. This likely represents a key mechanism by which AMPK activation attenuates atherosclerosis.
Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains one of the major causes of death and disability worldwide. In addition to drug treatment, nutritional interventions or supplementations are becoming a health strategy for CVD prevention. Phytosterols (PhyS) are natural components that have been shown to reduce cholesterol levels; while poly-unsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), mainly omega-3 (ω3) fatty acids, have shown to reduce triglyceride levels. Here we aimed to investigate whether the proteins in the main lipoproteins (low density lipoproteins (LDL) and high density lipoproteins (HDL)) as well as proteins in the lipid free plasma fraction (LPDP) were regulated by the intake of PhyS-milk or ω3-milk, in overweight healthy volunteers by a proteomic based systems biology approach. The study was a longitudinal crossover trial, including thirty-two healthy volunteers with body mass index (BMI) 25-35 kg/m² (Clinical Trial: ISRCTN78753338). Basal samples before any intervention and after 4 weeks of intake of PhyS or ω3-milk were analyzed. Proteomic profiling by two dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE) followed by mass spectrometry-(MALDI/TOF), ELISA, Western blot, conventional biochemical analysis, and in-silico bioinformatics were performed. The intake of PhyS-milk did not induce changes in the lipid associated plasma protein fraction, whereas ω3-milk significantly increased apolipoprotein (Apo)- E LDL content (p = 0.043) and induced a coordinated increase in several HDL-associated proteins, Apo A-I, lecitin cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT), paraoxonase-1 (PON-1), Apo D, and Apo L1 (p &lt; 0.05 for all). Interestingly, PhyS-milk intake induced a reduction in inflammatory molecules not seen after ω3-milk intake. Serum amyloid P component (SAP) was reduced in the LPDP protein fraction (p = 0.001) of subjects taking PhyS-milk and C-C motif chemokine 2 (CCL2)expression detected by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis in white blood cells was significantly reduced (p = 0.013). No changes were observed in the lipid-free plasma proteome with ω3-milk. Our study provides novel results and highlights that the PhyS-milk induces attenuation of the pro-inflammatory pathways, whereas ω3-milk induces improvement in lipid metabolic pathways.
Familial lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) deficiency is a rare inherited disorder that causes an extremely low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentration in serum. Recently, acquired LCAT deficiency caused by IgG antibodies to LCAT, without any LCAT gene mutation, was reported. Here we describe a case of acquired LCAT deficiency occurring in association with sarcoidosis. The patient was a Japanese female aged 70 years, had no mutation in the LCAT gene exon sequence, but had an LCAT inhibitor factor in her serum, detected using lipoprotein-deficient serum. She was diagnosed with acquired LCAT deficiency. Her abnormalities of serum lipoproteins improved spontaneously during three and a half years. Because they require different treatment strategies, distinction between familial lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase deficiency (FLD) and acquired LCAT deficiency by gene sequencing is warranted, especially in cases without corneal clouding.
High-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C) is generally measured using several homogeneous assays. We aimed to clarify whether apolipoprotein E-containing HDL (apoE-HDL) subfractions are altered during storage, and if so, whether such changes affect the HDL-C concentration measured using homogeneous assays.
We stored serum from normolipidemic (n=32) and dyslipidemic (n=17) subjects at 4°C for up to 7days. ApoE-HDL subfractions were analyzed using native 2-dimensional gel (native 2D-gel) electrophoresis. HDL-C concentrations were determined using 2 precipitation and 4homogeneous assays.
Native 2D-gel electrophoresis revealed variously sized apoE-HDL subfractions. After 4h incubation at 37°C, subfractions of smaller particles were converted into larger particles by lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) activity. After 7days storage at 4°C, the smaller subfractions were decreased in the normolipidemic group, accompanying increases in larger subfractions, whereas changes in the respective subfractions varied among individuals in the dyslipidemic group. HDL-C concentrations were significantly lower after storage at 4°C in all assays, except that using Sekisui Medical's reagent. Therefore, changes in HDL-C concentration and apoE-HDL subfractions were independent of each other.
ApoE-HDL subfractions change during storage, but these changes are not linked to those in HDL-C concentration measured using homogeneous assays.
In sickle cell disease (SCD), alterations of cholesterol metabolism is in part related to abnormal levels and activity of plasma proteins such as lecithin cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT), and apolipoprotein A-I (ApoA-I). In addition, the size distribution of ApoA-I high density lipoproteins (HDL) differs from normal blood. The ratio of the amount of HDL2 particle relative to the smaller higher density pre-β HDL (HDL3) particle was shifted toward HDL2. This lipoprotein imbalance is exacerbated during acute vaso-occlusive episodes (VOE) as the relative levels of HDL3 decrease. HDL3 deficiency in SCD plasma was found to relate to a slower ApoA-I exchange rate, which suggests an impaired ABCA1-mediated cholesterol efflux in SCD. HDL2 isolated from SCD plasma displayed an antioxidant capacity normally associated with HDL3, providing evidence for a change in function of HDL2 in SCD as compared to HDL2 in normal plasma. Although SCD plasma is depleted in HDL3, this altered capacity of HDL2 could account for the lack of difference in pro-inflammatory HDL levels in SCD as compared to normal. Exposure of human umbilical vein endothelial cells to HDL2 isolated from SCD plasma resulted in higher mRNA levels of the acute phase protein long pentraxin 3 (PTX3) as compared to incubation with HDL2 from control plasma. Addition of the heme-scavenger hemopexin protein prevented increased expression of PTX3 in sickle HDL2-treated cells. These findings suggest that ApoA-I lipoprotein composition and functions are altered in SCD plasma, and that whole blood transfusion may be considered as a blood replacement therapy in SCD. Impact statement Our study adds to the growing evidence that the dysfunctional red blood cell (RBC) in sickle cell disease (SCD) affects the plasma environment, which contributes significantly in the vasculopathy that defines the disease. Remodeling of anti-inflammatory high density lipoprotein (HDL) to pro-inflammatory entities can occur during the acute phase response. SCD plasma is depleted of the pre-β particle (HDL3), which is essential for stimulation of reverse cholesterol from macrophages, and the function of the larger HDL2 particle is altered. These dysfunctions are exacerbated during vaso-occlusive episodes. Interaction of lipoproteins with endothelium increases formation of inflammatory mediators, a process counteracted by the heme-scavenger hemopexin. This links hemolysis to lipoprotein-mediated inflammation in SCD, and hemopexin treatment could be considered. The use of RBC concentrates in transfusion therapy of SCD patients underestimates the importance of the dysfunctional plasma compartment, and transfusion of whole blood or plasma may be warranted.
Advanced stages of liver cirrhosis lead to a dramatically increased mortality. For valid identification of these patients suitable biomarkers are essential. The most important biomarkers for liver function are bilirubin and prothrombin time expressed as International Normalized Ratio (INR). However, the influence of several anticoagulants on the prothrombin time limits its diagnostic value. Aim of this study was the evaluation of cholesterol esterification (CE) fraction (esterified cholesterol vs. total cholesterol) as an alternative biomarker for liver synthesis and mortality prediction. Under physiological conditions the CE fraction in blood is closely regulated by lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) which is produced in the liver.
One hundred forty-two patients with liver disease clinically considered for orthotopic liver transplant for different indications were enrolled in the study. One patient was excluded because of the intake of a direct oral factor Xa inhibitor which has a strong impact on prothrombin time.
Results of CE fraction were in good agreement with INR (R2 = 0.73; p &lt; 0.001). In patients who died or survived within three months mean CE fraction was 56% vs. 74% (p &lt; 0.001) and mean INR was 2.0 vs. 1.3 (p &lt; 0.001), respectively. The predictive value of CE fraction for three-month mortality risk was higher compared to INR (p = 0.04). Results for one-year mortality were comparable.
The cholesterol esterification fraction is a valid biomarker for liver synthesis and allows reliable prediction of mortality. In contrast to INR, it is independent of anticoagulation and other analytical limitations of coagulation tests.
Genome-wide association studies have identified over 150 loci associated with lipid traits, however, no large-scale studies exist for Hispanics and other minority populations. Additionally, the genetic architecture of lipid-influencing loci remains largely unknown. We performed one of the most racially/ethnically diverse fine-mapping genetic studies of HDL-C, LDL-C, and triglycerides to-date using SNPs on the MetaboChip array on 54,119 individuals: 21,304 African Americans, 19,829 Hispanic Americans, 12,456 Asians, and 530 American Indians. The majority of signals found in these groups generalize to European Americans. While we uncovered signals unique to racial/ethnic populations, we also observed systematically consistent lipid associations across these groups. In African Americans, we identified three novel signals associated with HDL-C (LPL, APOA5, LCAT) and two associated with LDL-C (ABCG8, DHODH). In addition, using this population, we refined the location for 16 out of the 58 known MetaboChip lipid loci. These results can guide tailored screening efforts, reveal population-specific responses to lipid-lowering medications, and aid in the development of new targeted drug therapies.
The aim of this study was to evaluate the vasoprotective effects of HDL isolated from carriers of LCAT deficiency, which are characterized by a selective depletion of LpA-I:A-II particles and predominance of preβ migrating HDL. HDLs were isolated from LCAT-deficient carriers and tested in vitro for their capacity to promote NO production and to inhibit vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) expression in cultured endothelial cells. HDLs from carriers were more effective than control HDLs in promoting eNOS activation with a gene-dose-dependent effect (PTrend = 0.048). As a consequence, NO production induced by HDL from carriers was significantly higher than that promoted by control HDL (1.63 ± 0.24-fold vs. 1.34 ± 0.07-fold, P = 0.031). HDLs from carriers were also more effective than control HDLs in inhibiting the expression of VCAM-1 (homozygotes, 65.0 ± 8.6%; heterozygotes, 53.1 ± 7.2%; controls, 44.4 ± 4.1%; PTrend = 0.0003). The increased efficiency of carrier HDL was likely due to the depletion in LpA-I:A-II particles. The in vitro findings might explain why carriers of LCAT deficiency showed flow-mediated vasodilation and plasma-soluble cell adhesion molecule concentrations comparable to controls, despite low HDL-cholesterol levels. These results indicate that selective depletion of apoA-II-containing HDL, as observed in carriers of LCAT deficiency, leads to an increased capacity of HDL to stimulate endothelial NO production, suggesting that changes in HDL apolipoprotein composition may be the target of therapeutic interventions designed to improve HDL functionality.
The polymorphisms/mutations of genes encoding proteins and enzymes involved in lipoprotein metabolism play important roles in the development of diabetic dyslipidemia. The aim of our study was to investigate the effects of LPL (rs320), LIPC (rs2070895), SCARB1 (rs5888), LCAT (rs2292318), CETP (rs708272), ADIPOQ (rs1501299), RETN (rs3745367), PON1 (rs662), and MNSOD (rs4880) gene polymorphisms on lipid metabolism and diabetic dyslipidemia.
This case-control study included 217 patients with diabetic dyslipidemia and 212 healthy age- and gender-matched individuals. Genomic DNA isolation was performed from blood samples, and genotype analysis was performed using melting curve analysis on a LightCycler® 480 Instrument. The chi-square test was used to compare genotype distribution and allele frequencies between the groups.
Significant associations were observed between LPL (rs320) (p&lt;0.001), LIPC (rs2070895) (p&lt;0.001), SCARB1 (rs5888) (p&lt;0.001), LCAT (rs2292318) (p&lt;0.001), CETP (rs708272) (p&lt;0.001), ADIPOQ (rs1501299) (p=0.01), RETN (rs3745367) (p&lt;0.001), and MNSOD (rs4880) (p&lt;0.001) polymorphisms and diabetic dyslipidemia. However, no association was observed between PON1 (rs662) polymorphisms and diabetic dyslipidemia (p=0.611).
LPL (rs320), LIPC (rs2070895), SCARB1 (rs5888), LCAT (rs2292318), CETP (rs708272), ADIPOQ (rs1501299), RETN (rs3745367), and MNSOD (rs4880) polymorphisms play an important role in basic molecular metabolism in diabetic dyslipidemia. Therefore, these polymorphisms may be used as a predictive marker for diabetic dyslipidemia in high-risk patients.
Apolipoprotein M (apoM) is a recently identified apolipoprotein associated with high-density lipoprotein (HDL) in coronary artery disease (CAD), but the association between apoM polymorphism and obesity has not been reported.
To investigate the association between apoM polymorphism and obesity prevalence in 584 Korean adults.
A total of 584 individuals aged between 30 and 80 years were recruited from Yonsei Medical Center in Seoul, Korea, and divided into obese (OB; body mass index, BMI ≥25) and nonobese (non-OB; BMI &lt;25) groups. Anthropometric variables, lipid profiles, insulin-resistant profiles, reverse cholesterol transport (RCT) enzymes, HDL subfraction, and apoM polymorphism were determined.
In OB with T-855C polymorphism, TT genotype carriers significantly showed 6.2% higher diastolic blood pressure (DBP), 1.3% lower amount of HDL2b subfraction, and 19.7% higher lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) mass than TC+CC carriers. OB subjects with the T allele of T-778C polymorphism significantly demonstrated 43% higher plasma insulin, 17.7% higher total cholesterol, 26.7% higher triglyceride, 40.7% higher leptin, 1.6% lower HDL2b, and 12.6% higher LCAT mass than those with the C allele. These results were reversed in non-OB with T-778C polymorphism regarding HDL subfractions and RCT enzymes.
apoM T-855C and T-778C polymorphisms were found to be associated with obesity by regulating HDL metabolism, and the T alleles of apoM T-778C were shown to be more strongly correlated.
We assessed secondary and genetic causes of severe HDL deficiency in 258,252 subjects, of whom 370 men (0.33%) and 144 women (0.099%) had HDL cholesterol levels &lt;20 mg/dl. We excluded 206 subjects (40.1%) with significant elevations of triglycerides, C-reactive protein, glycosylated hemoglobin, myeloperoxidase, or liver enzymes and men receiving testosterone. We sequenced 23 lipid-related genes in 201 (65.3%) of 308 eligible subjects. Mutations (23 novel) and selected variants were found at the following gene loci: 1) ABCA1 (26.9%): 2 homozygotes, 7 compound or double heterozygotes, 30 heterozygotes, and 2 homozygotes and 13 heterozygotes with variants rs9282541/p.R230C or rs111292742/c.-279C&gt;G; 2) LCAT (12.4%): 1 homozygote, 3 compound heterozygotes, 13 heterozygotes, and 8 heterozygotes with variant rs4986970/p.S232T; 3) APOA1 (5.0%): 1 homozygote and 9 heterozygotes; and 4) LPL (4.5%): 1 heterozygote and 8 heterozygotes with variant rs268/p.N318S. In addition, 4.5% had other mutations, and 46.8% had no mutations. Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) prevalence rates in the ABCA1, LCAT, APOA1, LPL, and mutation-negative groups were 37.0%, 4.0%, 40.0%, 11.1%, and 6.4%, respectively. Severe HDL deficiency is uncommon, with 40.1% having secondary causes and 48.8% of the subjects sequenced having ABCA1, LCAT, APOA1, or LPL mutations or variants, with the highest ASCVD prevalence rates being observed in the ABCA1 and APOA1 groups.
Dysregulated synthesis of hepatic cholesterol is a critical determinant of atherosclerosis. The combination of cholesterol and cholic acid (CC) diet supplementation to animal models is associated with hepatic dysfunction-mediated atherosclerosis. The current study was designed to investigate the hepatic cholesterol-lowering effects of oligomeric proanthocyanidins (OPC) in CC diet fed rats. CC diet-induced group exhibited significant increase in the hepatic lipid profile, activities of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase (HMGR), PON-1, LCAT, LPL, and LPO levels, and messenger RNA expression of HMGR, low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLr), and HNF-4α. Administration of OPC (100 mg/kg/bwt) resulted in the significant reduction of lipid profile and HMGR levels, with concomitant increase in the levels of cholesterol-regulating enzymes and upregulated expression of LDLr and HNF-4α, which was similar to atorvastatin. Molecular docking studies also revealed that proanthocyanidins had a strong binding affinity to HMGR, similar to atorvastatin. Our findings suggest that OPC regulate the impaired cholesterol metabolism-associated atherosclerosis through hepatic cholesterol-lowering effect.
Multicompartmentalized microreactors are considered as cell mimics with hierarchical structures inspired by mammalian cells. We report the successful assembly and encapsulation of purified nuclei from RAW 264.7 cells (pNuc) into alginate-based microreactors. We demonstrate the preserved function of nuclei within the microreactors for mRNA production. Further, we load catalase-loaded liposomes (Lcat) into the microreactors to break down hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) into oxygen and water. Assemblies containing both natural pNuc and synthetic Lcat show significantly higher mRNA production in the presence of H2O2 compared to microreactors without Lcat or no H2O2 present, suggesting a beneficial effect of the locally enzymatically produced oxygen for transcription. This novel type of microreactors, containing both natural and synthetic compartments, presents a substantial advancement from assemblies equipped with solely synthetic units and offers opportunities as hypoxia models or for cell-free protein synthesis.
A 29-year-old lady was diagnosed with lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) deficiency having presented with bilateral corneal clouding, severely reduced high density lipoproteins cholesterol, and proteinuria. She is a compound heterozygote with two LCAT gene mutations, one of which is novel, c.321C&gt;A in exon 3. Surprisingly, the level of proteinuria significantly improved during pregnancy, despite stopping the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor. However, LCAT concentration and activity remained identical during pregnancy and postpartum. Her pregnancy was complicated by rising triglyceride levels from the second trimester requiring treatment with omega-3 fatty acid and fenofibrate. In the last trimester, a further complication arose when she became hypertensive and proteinuria worsened. She was diagnosed with pre-eclampsia and had an emergency cesarean section at 39 weeks delivering a healthy baby. This case adds to the knowledge of the pathophysiology of LCAT deficiency during pregnancy and will be useful in future patient management.
Cholesterol is essential for cell membrane stability, permeability, and fluidity. Cholesterol is present in seminal plasma, but whether a relationship between the level of cholesterol in seminal plasma and semen quality exists remains to be elucidated.
To explore the association between cholesterol levels in seminal plasma and serum cholesterols, semen quality, and serum reproductive hormones. Secondly, to explore whether the associations are biologically plausible.
An association study between cholesterol levels in seminal plasma and semen quality in 403 men, median age 19 years, from the general population. Additionally, an immunohistochemical evaluation of proteins involved in cholesterol metabolism and transport in tissues from the male reproductive tract (testis, epididymis, prostate, and seminal vesicle). Tissue specimens were investigated by immunohistochemistry for markers of cholesterol metabolism and transport (ABCA1, ABCG1, CYP11A1, CYP51A1, HMGCR, LAL, LCAT, LDLR, and SOAT1).
Trend analyses showed that total amount of total cholesterol in seminal plasma was positively associated with sperm concentration, total sperm count, sperm motility, and morphology (all p &lt; 0.008, adjusted). Cholesterol concentrations in seminal plasma were neither associated with serum cholesterol and lipid levels nor serum reproductive hormone (FSH, LH, testosterone, estradiol, sex-hormone-binding globulin, inhibin b) levels. All investigated markers of cholesterol metabolism and transport were expressed in the investigated tissue specimens to varying degrees.
Seminal plasma level of cholesterol was positively associated with semen parameters. The presence of proteins and enzymes involved in cholesterol metabolism in Leydig cells, Sertoli cells, and maturing germ cells in the seminiferous tubules supports the view that cholesterol may be important for spermatogenesis.
Cholesterol level in seminal plasma may be an indicator of semen quality. Investigations are needed to corroborate or refute our findings and to clarify the exact role of cholesterols for semen quality.
Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is associated with a substantial increased risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), which is partly related to dyslipidemia and low HDL-C level. The cardioprotective activity of HDL in the body is closely connected to its role in promoting cholesterol efflux, which is determined by cholesterol efflux capacity (CEC). Hitherto, the role of HDL, as defined by CEC has not been assessed in NAFLD patients. In this research study, we present the results of a study of cAMP-treated J774 CEC and THP-1 macrophage CEC in ApoB-depleted plasma of 55 newly diagnosed NAFLD patients and 30 controls. Circulating levels of ApoA-I, ApoB, preβ-HDL, plasma activity of CETP, PLTP, LCAT and carotid intima-media thickness (cIMT) were estimated. cAMP-treated J774 and THP-1 macrophage CEC were found to be significantly lower in NAFLD patients compared to controls (P &lt; 0.001 and P = 0.003, respectively). In addition, it was discovered that both ApoA-I and preβ1-HDL were significantly lower in NAFLD patients (P &lt; 0.001). Furthermore, cAMP-treated J774 CEC showed independent negative correlation with cIMT, as well as the presence of atherosclerotic plaque in NAFLD patients. In conclusion, our findings showed that HDL CEC was suppressed in NAFLD patients, and impaired cAMP-treated J774 CEC was an independent risk factor for subclinical atherosclerosis in NAFLD patients, suggesting that impaired HDL functions as an independent risk factor for atherosclerosis in NAFLD.
Lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT), a key enzyme in high-density lipoprotein (HDL) metabolism and reverse cholesterol transport (RCT), has been associated with atheroprotection. However, its relation to plaque characteristics has not been confirmed to date. We aimed to determine the relationship between plasma LCAT mass concentration and plaque burden in a multi-center imaging study.
Two hundred sixty-seven patients with angiographically proven coronary artery disease (CAD) underwent intravascular ultrasonography (IVUS) imaging. Ninety-six patients without CAD served as controls for biochemistry assessments.
Plasma LCAT mass concentration was higher in CAD patients as compared to controls (8.94 ± 2.51 μg/mL vs. 7.89 ± 2.99 μg/mL, p = 0.003), while cholesterol esterification rate (CER) was downregulated (253.6 ± 83.9 μM/2 h vs. 315.3 ± 115.0 μM/2 h, p&lt;0.0001). Both parameters correlated inversely with total atheroma volume (r = -0.14, p = 0.027 and r = -0.14, p = 0.024, respectively), while only LCAT mass was found to be a significant predictor of atheroma volume (β-coefficient -0.18, p = 0.0047) when tested in a stepwise linear regression model against known CAD risk factors as predictor variables. Accordingly, patients with LCAT mass in the highest quartile had significantly less atheroma burden than those in the lower quartiles (39.7 ± 10.7% vs. 45.4 ± 10.4%, p = 0.0014 for highest vs. lowest quartile of LCAT mass).
Plasma LCAT mass concentration is upregulated in CAD patients and inversely related to plaque volume, suggesting atheroprotective effects. LCAT mass concentration outperformed LCAT activity in risk prediction models for atheroma burden, suggesting that LCAT mass is a key variable in atheroprotection. Further studies assessing LCAT as a therapeutic target in cardiovascular disease are warranted.
Recessive inherited disorder lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) deficiency causes severe hypocholesterolemia and nephrotic syndrome. Characteristic lipoprotein subfractions have been observed in familial LCAT deficiency (FLD) with renal damage.
We described a case of acquired LCAT deficiencies with literature review.
The lipoprotein profiles examined by gel permeation-high-performance liquid chromatography (GP-HPLC) and native 2-dimensional electrophoresis before and after prednisolone (PSL) treatment.
Here we describe the case of a 67-year-old man with severely low levels of cholesterol. The serum LCAT activity was undetectable, and autoantibodies against it were detected. The patient developed nephrotic syndrome at the age of 70 years. Renal biopsy revealed not only membranous glomerulonephritis but also lesions similar to those seen in FLD. We initiated PSL treatment, which resulted in remission of the nephrotic syndrome. In GP-HPLC analysis, lipoprotein profile was similar to that of FLD although lipoprotein X level was low. Acquired LCAT deficiencies are extremely rare with only 7 known cases including ours. Patients with undetectable LCAT activity levels develop nephrotic syndrome that requires PSL treatment; cases whose LCAT activity levels can be determined may also develop nephrotic syndrome, but spontaneously recover.
Lipoprotein X may play a role in the development of renal impairment in individuals with FLD. However, the effect might be less significant in individuals with acquired LCAT deficiency.
Copy-number variations (CNVs) have been studied in the context of familial hypercholesterolemia but have not yet been evaluated in patients with extreme levels of HDL cholesterol. We evaluated targeted, next-generation sequencing data from patients with very low levels of HDL cholesterol (i.e., hypoalphalipoproteinemia) with the VarSeq-CNV® caller algorithm to screen for CNVs that disrupted the ABCA1, LCAT, or APOA1 genes. In four individuals, we found three unique deletions in ABCA1: a heterozygous deletion of exon 4, a heterozygous deletion that spanned exons 8 to 31, and a heterozygous deletion of the entire ABCA1 gene. Breakpoints were identified with Sanger sequencing, and the full-gene deletion was confirmed by using exome sequencing and the Affymetrix CytoScan HD array. Previously, large-scale deletions in candidate HDL genes had not been associated with hypoalphalipoproteinemia; our findings indicate that CNVs in ABCA1 may be a previously unappreciated genetic determinant of low levels of HDL cholesterol. By coupling bioinformatic analyses with next-generation sequencing data, we can successfully assess the spectrum of genetic determinants of many dyslipidemias, including hypoalphalipoproteinemia.
To highlight the benefits of green alga Ulva lactuca polysaccharides supplementation on blood pressure and atherogenic risk factors in rats fed a high fat diet.
Wistar male rats were fed a high fat diet (30% sheep fat) for 3 months. At an average body weight (BW) of 360g, the rats (n=18) were divided into 3 groups and consumed, for 28 days, either a high fat diet (HFD) or a high fat diet enriched with 1% of whole green algae (WGA) powder or with 1% of its polysaccharides (PLS).
In HFD, WGA and PLS supplementation reduced BW and food intake. WGA and PLS compared to HFD reduced systolic (PAS) (-17% and -19%) and diastolic (PAD) blood pressure (-38% and -39%), serum glucose (-37% and -30%, respectively), insulinemia (-55% and -74%, respectively), serum and hepatic total lipids, triglycerides, total cholesterol levels, as well as the total cholesterol concentration of low and very low density lipoproteins. The same, atherogenicity ratios and membrane fluidity decreased in the WGA and PLS vs HFD while lecithin: cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) activity increased (51 and 41% respectively).
Ulva lactuca and its polysaccharides, one of the bioactive compounds of this macroalga, seem to have hypotensive, hypoglycemic, hypolipaemic and antiatherogenic properties that can correct or prevent certain cardiovascular complications linked to a high fat diet.
APOA1 is the most abundant protein in HDL. It modulates interactions that affect HDL's cardioprotective functions, in part via its activation of the enzyme, LCAT. On nascent discoidal HDL, APOA1 comprises 10 α-helical repeats arranged in an anti-parallel stacked-ring structure that encapsulates a lipid bilayer. Previous chemical cross-linking studies suggested that these APOA1 rings can adopt at least two different orientations, or registries, with respect to each other; however, the functional impact of these structural changes is unknown. Here, we placed cysteine residues at locations predicted to form disulfide bonds in each orientation and then measured APOA1's ability to adopt the two registries during HDL particle formation. We found that most APOA1 oriented with the fifth helix of one molecule across from fifth helix of the other (5/5 helical registry), but a fraction adopted a 5/2 registry. Engineered HDLs that were locked in 5/5 or 5/2 registries by disulfide bonds equally promoted cholesterol efflux from macrophages, indicating functional particles. However, unlike the 5/5 registry or the WT, the 5/2 registry impaired LCAT cholesteryl esterification activity (P &lt; 0.001), despite LCAT binding equally to all particles. Chemical cross-linking studies suggest that full LCAT activity requires a hybrid epitope composed of helices 5-7 on one APOA1 molecule and helices 3-4 on the other. Thus, APOA1 may use a reciprocating thumbwheel-like mechanism to activate HDL-remodeling proteins.
The effects of sardine by-products (SBy-P) and fillet proteins (SF-P) were compared to casein (Cas) ; these effects were assessed on blood pressure, glycemic control, reverse cholesterol transport, lipid peroxidation and total antioxidant capacity in obese rats.
Eighteen male Wistar rats were subjected for three months, to a high-fat diet. The obese rats were divided into three groups and consumed the same high-fat diet for 28 days after addition of either, 20% SBy-P, SF-P or Cas.
The sardine proteins (SBy-P and SF-P) compared respectively to Cas, reduced diastolic (-14%, -11% P&lt;0.05) and systolic pressures (-12%, -8% P&lt;0.05), blood glucose (-24%, -21% P&lt;0.05), glycated hemoglobin (-28%, -21% P&lt;0.05), insulinemia (-29%, -18% P&lt;0.05) and HOMA-IR index (-29%, -18% P&lt;0.05). They improve the reverse cholesterol transport by increasing the lecithin: cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) activity (+43%, +30% P&lt;0.05) and high-density lipoproteins in cholesterol esters (+108%, +88% P&lt;0.05), and decreasing the atherogenicity ratios and membrane fluidity (P&lt;0.05). Furthermore, SBy-P and SF-P induced a reduction of reactive thiobarbituric acid substances concentrations in heart (-45%, -25% P&lt;0.05), aorta (-62%, -41% P&lt;0.05), liver (-40%, -21% P&lt;0.05) and adipose tissue (-50%, -37% P&lt;0.05) with an improvement in antioxidant capacity.
Sardine proteins, in particular those extracted from by-products, because of their hypotensive, hypoglycemic, anti-atherogenic and antioxidant properties, may have protective effects against the cardiovascular risk associated with obesity.
Lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) is the sole enzyme that esterifies cholesterol in plasma. Its role in the supposed protection from atherogenesis remains unclear because mutations in LCAT causing fish-eye disease (FED) or familial LCAT deficiency (FLD) have been reported to be associated with more or instead less carotid atherosclerosis, respectively. This discrepancy may be associated with the loss of cholesterol esterification on only apolipoprotein AI (FED) or on both apolipoprotein AI- and apolipoprotein B-containing lipoproteins (FLD), an aspect that has thus far not been investigated.
Seventy-four heterozygotes for LCAT mutations recruited from Italy and the Netherlands were assigned to FLD (n=33) or FED (n=41) groups and compared with 280 control subjects. Subclinical atherosclerosis was assessed with carotid intima-media thickness.
Compared with control subjects, total cholesterol was lower by 16% (-32.9 mg/dL) and 7% (-14.9 mg/dL) and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol was lower by 29% (-16.7 mg/dL) and 36% (-20.7 mg/dL) in the FLD and FED groups, respectively. Subjects with FLD displayed a significant 18% lower low-density lipoprotein cholesterol compared with subjects with FED (101.9±35.0 versus 123.6±47.4 mg/dL; P=0.047) and control subjects (122.6±35.0 mg/dL; P=0.003). Remarkably, all 3 intima-media thickness parameters were lower in subjects with FLD compared with FED and control subjects (accounting for age, sex, body mass index, smoking, hypertension, family history of cardiovascular disease, and plasma lipids). After additional correction for nationality and ultrasonographic methods, average and maximum intima-media thickness remained significantly lower when subjects with FLD were compared with those with FED (0.59 versus 0.73 mm, P=0.003; and 0.87 versus 1.24 mm, P&lt;0.001, respectively). In contrast, the common carotid intima-media thickness (corrected for age, sex, body mass index, smoking, hypertension, family history of cardiovascular disease, and plasma lipids) was higher in subjects with FED compared with control subjects (0.69 versus 0.65 mm; P=0.05), but this significance was lost after adjustment for nationality and ultrasonographic machine.
In this head-to-head comparison, FLD and FED mutations were shown to be associated with decreased and increased atherosclerosis, respectively. We propose that this discrepancy is related to the capacity of LCAT to generate cholesterol esters on apolipoprotein B-containing lipoproteins. Although this capacity is lost in FLD, it is unaffected in FED. These results are important when considering LCAT as a target to decrease atherosclerosis.
Shiitake (Lentinula edodes) extract, eritadenine, has been shown to reduce cholesterol levels, and its hypocholesterolemic actions are involved in the metabolism of methionine. However, the mechanisms by which eritadenine affects cholesterol metabolism in animals fed a high-fat diet containing different sources of lipids have not yet been elucidated in detail. This study was conducted to investigate the effects of shiitake supplementation on serum lipid concentrations in rats fed a diet including a high amount of a plant oil (HO [high oil] and HOS [high oil with shiitake] groups), animal fat (HF [high fat] and HFS [high fat with shiitake] groups), or MCT- (medium-chain triglyceride-) rich plant oil (HM [high MCT] and HMS [high MCT with shiitake] groups). Rats in the HOS, HFS, and HMS groups were fed shiitake. When rats were fed a diet containing shiitake, serum triglyceride, cholesterol levels, and LCAT (lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase) activities were lower in rats given MCT-rich plant oil than in those that consumed lard. The lipid type in the diet with shiitake also affected serum cholesterol levels and LCAT activities. The diet containing MCT-rich plant oil showed the greatest rates of decrease in all serum lipid profiles and LCAT activities. These results suggest that shiitake and MCT-rich plant oil work together to reduce lipid profiles and LCAT activity in serum.
The mammalian adipose tissue plays a central role in energy-balance control, whereas the avian visceral fat hardly expresses leptin, the key adipokine in mammals. Therefore, to assess the endocrine role of adipose tissue in birds, we compared the transcriptome and proteome between two metabolically different types of chickens, broilers and layers, bred towards efficient meat and egg production, respectively.
Broilers and layer hens, grown up to sexual maturation under free-feeding conditions, differed 4.0-fold in weight and 1.6-fold in ovarian-follicle counts, yet the relative accumulation of visceral fat was comparable. RNA-seq and mass-spectrometry (MS) analyses of visceral fat revealed differentially expressed genes between broilers and layers, 1106 at the mRNA level (FDR ≤ 0.05), and 203 at the protein level (P ≤ 0.05). In broilers, Ingenuity Pathway Analysis revealed activation of the PTEN-pathway, and in layers increased response to external signals. The expression pattern of genes encoding fat-secreted proteins in broilers and layers was characterized in the RNA-seq and MS data, as well as by qPCR on visceral fat under free feeding and 24 h-feed deprivation. This characterization was expanded using available RNA-seq data of tissues from red junglefowl, and of visceral fat from broilers of different types. These comparisons revealed expression of new adipokines and secreted proteins (LCAT, LECT2, SERPINE2, SFTP1, ZP1, ZP3, APOV1, VTG1 and VTG2) at the mRNA and/or protein levels, with dynamic gene expression patterns in the selected chicken lines (except for ZP1; FDR/P ≤ 0.05) and feed deprivation (NAMPT, SFTPA1 and ZP3) (P ≤ 0.05). In contrast, some of the most prominent adipokines in mammals, leptin, TNF, IFNG, and IL6 were expressed at a low level (FPKM/RPKM&lt; 1) and did not show differential mRNA expression neither between broiler and layer lines nor between fed vs. feed-deprived chickens.
Our study revealed that RNA and protein expression in visceral fat changes with selective breeding, suggesting endocrine roles of visceral fat in the selected phenotypes. In comparison to gene expression in visceral fat of mammals, our findings points to a more direct cross talk of the chicken visceral fat with the reproductive system and lower involvement in the regulation of appetite, inflammation and insulin resistance.
The primary objective of this study was to assess the causality of ADRs using World Health Organization-Uppsala Monitoring Centre (WHO-UMC), Naranjo and Liverpool ADR Causality Assessment Tool (LCAT). Other primary objective was to assess the agreement between the WHO-UMC criterion, Naranjo algorithm and LCAT. The secondary objective was to assess the reported adverse drug reactions in a tertiary care hospital in South India.
This was a cross-sectional retrospective study. All the ADRs which were reported by the Pharmacovigilance Unit between July 2016 and March 2017 were assessed. Causality assessment was performed by two well-trained independent pharmacologists by applying the three methods-WHO, Naranjo and LCAT. Concurrence between the two algorithms was compared using the Cohen's weighted kappa statistic.
Causality assessment of adverse reactions according to Naranjo criteria shows that 81% cases were of probable type, 9.5% cases were possible and 9.5% cases were unlikely. Causality assessment of adverse reactions according to WHO-UMC criteria shows that 85.7% cases were of probable type, 4.8% cases were possible, 4.8% cases were unlikely and 4.8% cases were definite. Causality assessment of adverse reactions according to Liverpool criteria shows that 61.9% cases were of probable type, 4.8% cases were possible and 33.3% cases were definite. Cohen's kappa test shows that negative and poor concurrence was seen between WHO and Naranjo causality comparison (κ = -0.161). Positive but poor concurrence based on kappa values was seen between Liverpool and Naranjo's causality comparison (κ = 0.133). Negative and poor concurrence based on kappa values was seen between WHO and Liverpool causality comparison (κ = -0.161).
The most frequent causality category observed by the WHO-UMC criteria, Naranjo as well as the Liverpool algorithm was "Probable." Full concurrence was not found between any of two scales of causality assessment.
Single-domain antibodies, also known as nanobodies, are small antigen-binding fragments (~15kDa) that are derived from heavy chain only antibodies present in camelids (VHH, from camels and llamas), and cartilaginous fishes (VNAR, from sharks). Nanobody V-like domains are useful alternatives to conventional antibodies due to their small size, and high solubility and stability across many applications. In addition, phage display, ribosome display, and mRNA/cDNA display methods can be used for the efficient generation and optimization of binders in vitro. The resulting nanobodies can be genetically encoded, tagged, and expressed in cells for in vivo localization and functional studies of target proteins. Collectively, these properties make nanobodies ideal for use within echinoderm embryos. This chapter describes the optimization and imaging of genetically encoded nanobodies in the sea urchin embryo. Examples of live-cell antigen tagging (LCAT) and the manipulation of green fluorescent protein (GFP) are shown. We discuss the potentially transformative applications of nanobody technology for probing membrane protein trafficking, cytoskeleton re-organization, receptor signaling events, and gene regulation during echinoderm development.
In chronic kidney disease (CKD), the level of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) decreases markedly, but there is no strong inverse relationship between HDL-cholesterol (HDL-C) and cardiovascular diseases. This indicates that not only the HDL-C level, but also the other quantitative changes in the HDL particles can influence the protective functionality of these particles, and can play a key role in the increase of cardiovascular risk in CKD patients. The aim of the present study was the evaluation of the parameters that may give additional information about the HDL particles in the course of progressing CKD. For this purpose, we analyzed the concentrations of HDL containing apolipoprotein A-I without apolipoprotein A-II (LpA-I), preβ1-HDL, and myeloperoxidase (MPO), and the activity of paraoxonase-1 (PON-1) in 68 patients at various stages of CKD. The concentration of HDL cholesterol, MPO, PON-1, and lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) activity were similar in all of the analyzed stages of CKD. We did not notice significant changes in the LpA-I concentrations in the following stages of CKD (3a CKD stage: 57 ± 19; 3b CKD stage: 54 ± 15; 4 CKD stage: 52 ± 14; p = 0.49). We found, however, that the preβ1-HDL concentration and preβ1-HDL/LpA-I ratio increased along with the progress of CKD, and were inversely correlated with the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), even after adjusting for age, gender, triacylglycerols (TAG), HDL cholesterol, and statin therapy (β = -0.41, p &lt; 0.001; β = -0.33, p = 0.001, respectively). Our results support the earlier hypothesis that kidney disease leads to the modification of HDL particles, and show that the preβ1-HDL concentration is significantly elevated in non-dialyzed patients with advanced stages of CKD.
Familial LCAT deficiency (FLD) patients accumulate lipoprotein-X (LP-X), an abnormal nephrotoxic lipoprotein enriched in free cholesterol (FC). The low neutral lipid content of LP-X limits the ability to detect it after separation by lipoprotein electrophoresis and staining with Sudan Black or other neutral lipid stains. A sensitive and accurate method for quantitating LP-X would be useful to examine the relationship between plasma LP-X and renal disease progression in FLD patients and could also serve as a biomarker for monitoring recombinant human LCAT (rhLCAT) therapy. Plasma lipoproteins were separated by agarose gel electrophoresis and cathodal migrating bands corresponding to LP-X were quantified after staining with filipin, which fluoresces with FC, but not with neutral lipids. rhLCAT was incubated with FLD plasma and lipoproteins and LP-X changes were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis. Filipin detects synthetic LP-X quantitatively (linearity 20-200 mg/dl FC; coefficient of variation &lt;20%) and sensitively (lower limit of quantitation &lt;1 mg/ml FC), enabling LP-X detection in FLD, cholestatic, and even fish-eye disease patients. rhLCAT incubation with FLD plasma ex vivo reduced LP-X dose dependently, generated HDL, and decreased lipoprotein FC content. Filipin staining after agarose gel electrophoresis sensitively detects LP-X in human plasma and accurately quantifies LP-X reduction after rhLCAT incubation ex vivo.
High density lipoprotein (HDL) has attracted the attention of biomedical community due to its well-documented role in atheroprotection. HDL has also been recently implicated in the regulation of islets of Langerhans secretory function and in the etiology of peripheral insulin sensitivity. Indeed, data from numerous studies strongly indicate that the functions of pancreatic β-cells, skeletal muscles and adipose tissue could benefit from improved HDL functionality. To better understand how changes in HDL structure may affect diet-induced obesity and type 2 diabetes we aimed at investigating the impact of Apoa1 or Lcat deficiency, two key proteins of peripheral HDL metabolic pathway, on these pathological conditions in mouse models. We report that universal deletion of apoa1 or lcat expression in mice fed western-type diet results in increased sensitivity to body-weight gain compared to control C57BL/6 group. These changes in mouse genome correlate with discrete effects on white adipose tissue (WAT) metabolic activation and plasma glucose homeostasis. Apoa1-deficiency results in reduced WAT mitochondrial non-shivering thermogenesis. Lcat-deficiency causes a concerted reduction in both WAT oxidative phosphorylation and non-shivering thermogenesis, rendering lcat-/- mice the most sensitive to weight gain out of the three strains tested, followed by apoa1-/- mice. Nevertheless, only apoa1-/- mice show disturbed plasma glucose homeostasis due to dysfunctional glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in pancreatic β-islets and insulin resistant skeletal muscles. Our analyses show that both apoa1-/- and lcat-/- mice fed high-fat diet have no measurable Apoa1 levels in their plasma, suggesting no direct involvement of Apoa1 in the observed phenotypic differences among groups.
Limbal Conjunctival Autograft Transplantation (LCAT) is considered to be the most effective treatment option for pterygium with the least recurrence rate and rapid restoration of normal epithelial morphology. Of the many available methods for securing Limbal Conjunctival Autograft (LCAG), sutures and autogenous serum in-situ are cost-effective and offers better outcomes.
To compare the outcome of surgeries between the two groups: Group I - LCAG secured with autogenous serum in-situ versus Group II - LCAG secured with sutures.
A prospective randomized control trial conducted on 60 patients who were equally divided into two groups. Post-operative follow-up visits were scheduled at 1st week, 3rd week and 6th week. They were examined for pain, foreign body sensation, subconjunctival hemorrhage, tearing, hyperemia, graft edema, graft displacement, graft retraction, recurrence and/or any other complications and were graded depending on the severity. Mean surgical time was compared between the two groups.
Average duration of surgery was significantly less in Group I than in Group II. Postoperatively, symptoms like pain, foreign body sensation, tearing and hyperemia were less common in Group I, furthermore subconjunctival hemorrhage and graft edema were more in Group II.
Though both the procedures are safe and effective, the use of autogenous serum in-situ significantly shortens the duration of surgery and is accompanied by lesser postoperative discomfort and inflammation. However, long-term studies are needed to assess the risk of recurrence. Graft displacement remains a severe, but infrequent complication.
To examine recent advances in our knowledge on the diagnosis of lipid disorders.
Fasting values above the 99th percentile for direct LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C), lipoprotein(a), and triglycerides are greater than 225 mg/dl, greater than 160 mg/dl, and greater than 500 mg/dl (&gt;5.82, &gt;394, and &gt;5.65 mmol/l), respectively, whereas such values for plasma lathosterol, β-sitosterol, and cholestanol are greater than 8.0, 8.0, and 5.0 mg/l (&gt;0.021, 0.019, and 0.013 mmol/l), respectively. Values below the first percentile for LDL-C are less than 40 mg/dl (&lt;1.03 mmol/l) and for HDL-cholesterol (HDL-C) less than 25 mg/dl (&lt;0.65 mmol/l) in men and less than 30 mg/dl (&lt;0.78 mmol/l) in women, respectively. The above values can predispose to premature CVD, pancreatitis, neurologic disease, and kidney failure, and may be associated with monogenic lipid disorders. In the absence of secondary causes including diabetes or kidney, liver, or thyroid disease, consideration should be given to sequencing the following genes: ABCA1, ABCG5, ABCG8, APOA1, APOA5, APOB, APOC2, APOE, CETP, CYP27A1, GPIHBP1, LCAT, LDLR, LDLRAP1, LIPA, LIPC, LMF1, LPL, MTTP, PCSK9, SCARB1, and STAP1.
Recent data indicate that secondary causes and a wider range of conditions need to be considered in identifying the underlying causes of hypercholesterolemia, hypertriglyceridemia, hyperalphalipoproteinemia, hypobetalipoproteinemia, and HDL deficiency. Identifying such disorders allows for a more precise assessment of prognosis and the formulation of optimal therapy.
We have previously shown that protein biomarkers associated with circulating microparticles proteins (CMPs) obtained at the end of the first trimester may detect physiologic changes in maternal-fetal interaction such that the risk of spontaneous preterm delivery ≤35 weeks can be stratified.
We present here a study extension and validation of the CMP protein multiplex concept using a larger sample set from a multicenter population that allows for model derivation in a training set and characterization in a separate testing set.
Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) plasma was obtained from 3 established biobanks (Seattle, Boston, and Pittsburgh). Samples were from patients at a median of 10-12 weeks' gestation, and the CMPs were isolated via size-exclusion chromatography followed by protein identification via targeted protein analysis using liquid chromatography-multiple reaction monitoring-mass (LC-MRM) spectrometry. A total of 87 women delivered at ≤35 weeks, and 174 women who delivered at term were matched by maternal age (±2 years) and gestational age at sample draw (±2 weeks). From our prior work, the CMP protein multiplex comprising F13A, FBLN1, IC1, ITIH2, and LCAT was selected for validation.
For delivery at ≤35 weeks, the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve for a panel of CMP proteins (F13A, FBLN1, IC1, ITIH2, and LCAT) revealed an associated area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.74 (95% CI, 0.63-0.81). A separate panel of markers (IC1, LCAT, TRFE, and ITIH4), which stratified risk among mothers with a parity of 0, showed an AUC of 0.77 (95% CI, 0.61-0.90).
We have identified a set of CMP proteins that provide, at 10-12 weeks gestation, a clinically useful AUC in an independent test population. Furthermore, we determined that parity is pertinent to the diagnostic testing performance of the biomarkers for risk stratification.
Given that there are few reported cases of lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) deficiency, recognition of the condition with proper management is notable. Long-term follow-up and contact lens fitting after penetrating keratoplasty provide best possible outcomes.
The purpose of this study was to report a case of LCAT deficiency successfully treated with penetrating keratoplasty and longer-term follow-up with contact lens fitting.
A 43-year-old white woman of Italian descent presented with corneal clouding and trouble with night vision. The patient had a history of LCAT deficiency, irritable bowel syndrome, gastroesophageal reflux disease, osteoporosis, and hemolytic anemia. Slit-lamp examination demonstrated corneal haze throughout the corneal layers. The corneas had normal pachymetry. Given the opacity of each cornea (right greater than left) and decreased night vision, penetrating keratoplasty was performed on the right eye. At post-operative month 16, the corneal graft remained clear. The patient was able to achieve a best-corrected visual acuity of 20/30+ with a scleral lens.
Penetrating keratoplasty may be necessary to provide better quality of vision in LCAT deficiency patients, specifically to enhance one's contrast sensitivity, despite relatively good Snellen visual acuity.
Familial LCAT deficiency (FLD) is due to mutations in lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT), a plasma enzyme that esterifies cholesterol on lipoproteins. FLD is associated with markedly reduced levels of plasma high-density lipoprotein and cholesteryl ester and the formation of a nephrotoxic lipoprotein called LpX. We used a mouse model in which the LCAT gene is deleted and a truncated version of the SREBP1a gene is expressed in the liver under the control of a protein-rich/carbohydrate-low (PRCL) diet-regulated PEPCK promoter. This mouse was found to form abundant amounts of LpX in the plasma and was used to determine whether treatment with recombinant human LCAT (rhLCAT) could prevent LpX formation and renal injury. After 9 days on the PRCL diet, plasma total and free cholesterol, as well as phospholipids, increased 6.1 ± 0.6-, 9.6 ± 0.9-, and 6.7 ± 0.7-fold, respectively, and liver cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations increased 1.7 ± 0.4- and 2.8 ±0.9-fold, respectively, compared with chow-fed animals. Transmission electron microscopy revealed robust accumulation of lipid droplets in hepatocytes and the appearance of multilamellar LpX particles in liver sinusoids and bile canaliculi. In the kidney, LpX was found in glomerular endothelial cells, podocytes, the glomerular basement membrane, and the mesangium. The urine albumin/creatinine ratio increased 30-fold on the PRCL diet compared with chow-fed controls. Treatment of these mice with intravenous rhLCAT restored the normal lipoprotein profile, eliminated LpX in plasma and kidneys, and markedly decreased proteinuria. The combined results suggest that rhLCAT infusion could be an effective therapy for the prevention of renal disease in patients with FLD.
Glomerulopathy associated with lecithin-cholesterol-acyltransferase deficiency (LCAT) is a rare automosal recessive disease. Acquired LCAT deficiency due to inhibitory autoantibodies against LCAT are also described. This disease is induced by systemic deposits related to a lipid metabolism disorder and lead to multi-organ involvement including renal involvement. Lipid profile usually shows variable cholesterol levels but very low HDL levels. Here we describe the case of a 33-year-old man presenting a nephrotic syndrome associated with moderate renal insufficiency for which the pathological analysis allowed to guide towards the diagnosis of LCAT deficiency. Laboratory and genetic data confirmed this diagnosis. Familial history and lipid profile abnormalities are important in the identification of this disease.
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a major cause of cancer mortality and an increasing incidence worldwide; however, there are very few effective diagnostic approaches and prognostic biomarkers.
One hundred forty-nine pairs of HCC samples from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) were obtained to screen differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between HCC and normal samples. The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway, Gene ontology enrichment analyses, and protein-protein interaction network were used. Cox proportional hazards regression analysis was used to identify significant prognostic DEGs, with which a gene expression signature prognostic prediction model was identified in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project discovery cohort. The robustness of this panel was assessed in the GSE14520 cohort. We verified details of the gene expression level of the key molecules through TCGA, GEO, and qPCR and used immunohistochemistry for substantiation in HCC tissues. The methylation states of these genes were also explored.
Ninety-eight genes, consisting of 13 upregulated and 85 downregulated genes, were screened out in three datasets. KEGG and Gene ontology analysis for the DEGs revealed important biological features of each subtype. Protein-protein interaction network analysis was constructed, consisting of 64 nodes and 115 edges. A subset of four genes (SPINK1, TXNRD1, LCAT, and PZP) that formed a prognostic gene expression signature was established from TCGA and validated in GSE14520. Next, the expression details of the four genes were validated with TCGA, GEO, and clinical samples. The expression panels of the four genes were closely related to methylation states.
This study identified a novel four-gene signature biomarker for predicting the prognosis of HCC. The biomarkers may also reveal molecular mechanisms underlying development of the disease and provide new insights into interventional strategies.
Genetic LCAT deficiency is a rare recessive autosomal disease due to loss-of-function mutations in the gene coding for the enzyme lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT). Homozygous carriers are characterized by corneal opacity, haemolytic anaemia and renal disease, which represent the first cause of morbidity and mortality in these subjects. Diagnostic and prognostic markers capable of early detecting declining kidney function in these subjects are not available, and the specific serum or urine proteomic signature of LCAT deficient carriers has never been assessed. Taking advantage of a proteomic approach, we performed 2-DE analysis of carriers' plasma and identified proteins present at different concentration in samples from homozygous carriers. Our data confirm the well-known alterations in the concentration of circulating apolipoproteins, with a statistically significant decrease of both apoA-I and apoA-II and a statistically significant increase of apoC-III. Furthermore, we observed increased level of alpha-1-antitrypsin, zinc-alpha-2-glycoprotein and retinol-binding protein 4, and reduced level of clusterin and haptoglobin. Interestingly, only beta but not alpha subunit of haptoglobin is significant reduced in homozygous subjects. Despite the limited sample size, our findings set the basis for assessing the identified protein in a larger population and for correlating their levels with clinical markers of renal function and anaemia. SIGNIFICANCE: This investigation defines the effects of LCAT deficiency on the level of the major plasma proteins in homozygous and heterozygous carriers. Increase for some proteins, with different function, together with a drop for haptoglobin, and specifically for haptoglobin beta chains, are reported for the first time as part of a coherent signature. We are glad to have the opportunity to report our findings on this subject, which is one of the main interests for our research group, when Journal of Proteomics celebrates its 10th anniversary. With its various sections devoted to different areas of research, this journal is a privileged forum for publishing proteomic investigations without restrictions either in sample type or in technical approach. It is as well a privileged forum for reviewing literature data on various topics related to proteomics investigation, as colleagues in our research group have done over the years; by the way, a good share of the reviewed papers were as well reports published in Journal of Proteomics itself. The journal also offers opportunities for focused surveys through thematic issues devoted to a variety of subjects, timely selected for their current relevance in research; it was an honour for colleagues in our group to recently act as editors of one of those. Out of this diverse experience, we express our appreciation for the endeavour of Journal of Proteomics in its first 10 years of life - and wish identical and possibly greater success for the time to come.
Lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) is believed to be involved in reverse cholesterol transport, which is known to play a key role in suppression of atherosclerosis. However, recent investigations have demonstrated that higher LCAT activity, measured in terms of the serum cholesterol esterification rate by an endogenous substrate method, is associated with increased formation of triglyceride (TG)-rich lipoproteins (TRLs), leading to a decrease in the low-density lipoprotein (LDL) particle size. The purpose of this hospital-based longitudinal study was to clarify the causal relationship between changes in the LCAT activity and changes in the LDL-particle size.
The subjects were a total of 335 patients, derived from our previous study cohort, with one or more risk factors for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). For this study, we measured the LDL-particle size (relative LDL migration [LDL-Rm value]) by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the subjects, along with the changes in the LCAT activity, at the end of a follow-up period of at least 1 year.
The results revealed that the absolute change (Δ) in the LDL-particle size increased significantly as the quartile of Δ LCAT activity increased (p = 0.01). A multi-logistic regression adjusted-analysis revealed that Δ LCAT activity in the fourth quartile as compared to that in the first quartile was independently predictive of an increased LDL-particle size (odds ratio [95% confidence interval]: 2.03 [1.02/4.04], p = 0.04). Moreover, the ∆ LCAT activity was also positively correlated with ∆ TRL-related markers (i.e., TG, remnant particle-like cholesterol [RLP-C], apolipoprotein B, apolipoprotein C-2, and apolipoprotein C-3).
The results lend support to the hypothesis that increased LCAT activity may be associated with increased formation of TRLs, leading to a reduction in the LDL-particle size in patients at a high risk for ASCVD. To reduce the risk of ASCVD, it may be important to focus not only on the quantitative changes in the serum LDL-cholesterol levels, but also on the LCAT activity.

Lecithin cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) deficiency is an autosomal recessive disorder occurred by different mutations in the LCAT gene that cause two extremely rare syndromes including familial LCAT deficiency (FLD) and fish-eye disease (FED). Unlike FED in FLD renal failure is the most important defect due to deposition of abnormal lipoproteins in the renal stroma. In this study, FLD patients from the North of Iran were investigated for mutations in the LCAT gene.
Eight patients with corneal opacification and renal defect were analyzed for mutations in the LCAT gene by PCR sequencing.
Sequencing analysis revealed a missense pathogenic variation c.301 G&gt;A in exon 2 of LCAT gene in all patients changing the amino acid aspartate to asparagine at the conserved position of amino acid 101 of LCAT protein.
In this study, a very rare variation was reported for the first time in this part of the world. Investigation of a larger number of LCAT patients in different parts of Iran can provide availability of mutations panel that is useful for phenotype prediction and also prenatal diagnosis programming in families with a previous history of the disease.
Various fungi and bacteria can colonize in the brain and produce physical alterations seen in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Environmental and genetic factors affect the occurrence of fungal colonization, and how fungi can grow, enter the brain, and interact with the innate immune system. The essence of AD development is the defeat of the innate immune system, whether through vulnerable patient health status or treatment that suppresses inflammation by suppressing the innate immune system. External and mechanical factors that lead to inflammation are a door for pathogenic opportunity. Current research associates the presence of fungi in the etiology of AD and is shown in cerebral tissue at autopsy. From the time of the discovery of AD, much speculation exists for an infective cause. Identifying any AD disease organism is obscured by processes that can take place over years. Amyloid protein deposits are generally considered to be evidence of an intrinsic response to stress or imbalance, but instead amyloid may be evidence of the innate immune response which exists to destroy fungal colonization through structural interference and cytotoxicity. Fungi can remain ensconced for a long time in niches or inside cells, and it is the harboring of fungi that leads to repeated reinfection and slow wider colonization that eventually leads to a grave outcome. Although many fungi and bacteria are associated with AD affected tissues, discussion here focuses on Candida albicans as the archetype of human fungal pathology because of its wide proliferation as a commensal fungus, extensive published research, numerous fungal morphologies, and majority proliferation in AD tissues.
The heterogeneity and content of human plasma high-density lipoprotein (HDL) related to their atheroprotective properties determined by various molecular and cellular mechanisms still remain to be completely clarified. For 29 atherosclerosis-free male subjects, we studied the relationship of plasma lipid levels and the content of apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I)-containing HDL with preβ-electrophoretic mobility, the efficiency of BODIPY-cholesterol efflux from RAW 264.7 macrophages to apolipoprotein B (apoB)-deficient plasma, and the expression level of 22 genes related to HDL metabolism in mononuclear cells. A significant decrease in the absolute content of apoA-I in preβ-HDL was found in subjects with hypoalphalipoproteinemia compared with the subjects with hyperalphalipoproteinemia. The preβ-to-α-ratio of the apoA-I content was constant within the HDL-cholesterol (HDL-C) range 0.59 to 2.24 mM. However, this ratio was significantly increased with an increase in the plasma triacylglycerol (TAG) content from 0.59 to 3.42 mM. A correlation of the level of preβ-HDL with the basal and ABCA1-mediated efflux of cholesterol is shown. The transcript levels for six HDL-metabolizing genes (LDLR, LCAT, ABCA1, SCARB1, ZDHHC8, and BMP1) were decreased, while the transcript level of APOA1 gene was increased in mononuclear cells of subjects with hyperalphalipoproteinemia as compared with subjects with hypoalphalipoproteinemia. A reduction of the intracellular cholesterol level and inhibition of the expression of cholesterol transporters by nascent HDL in mononuclear cells from subjects with hyperalphalipoproteinemia are suggested. Hyperalphalipoproteinemia can be a driving force of the decreased flux of cholesteryl ester to the liver and the increased TAG hydrolysis. The atheroprotective effect of preβ-HDL in hypertriglyceridemia is proposed.
Elevation of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol is the hallmark of the dyslipidemia observed in hypothyroidism, but alterations on high-density lipoprotein (HDL) plasma levels and metabolism are less understood. The aim of this study was to explore aspects of HDL metabolism and enzymes that act on HDL after a short period of overt hypothyroidism.
Eighteen women (age 44 ± 11 years; body mass index 27.9 ± 5.2 kg/m2) were studied before total thyroidectomy for thyroid cancer, when they were euthyroid, and after thyroidectomy, in overt hypothyroidism for three weeks, following levothyroxine withdrawal for performance of a whole-body scan.
Thyrotropin and free thyroxine confirmed hypothyroidism; low thyroglobulin and radioiodine uptake indicated near absence of thyroid tissue. LDL cholesterol (125 ± 35 vs. 167 ± 40 mg/dL; p = 0.0002), HDL cholesterol (HDL-C; 39 ± 8 vs. 46 ± 10 mg/dL; p = 0.0025), non-HDL-C (149 ± 38 vs. 201 ± 46 mg/dL; p &lt; 0.0001), unesterified cholesterol (53 ± 10 vs. 70 ± 16 mg/dL; p = 0.0003), apolipoprotein (apo) A-I (1.32 ± 0.19 vs. 1.44 ± 0.22 g/L; p &lt; 0.04), and apo B (0.97 ± 0.25 vs. 1.31 ± 0.28 g/L; p &lt; 0.0001) plasma concentrations were all higher in hypothyroidism compared to values in the euthyroid state, but triglycerides and Lp(a) were unchanged. There were no changes in HDL particle size and lipid composition, cholesteryl ester transfer protein and lecithin cholesterol acyltransferase concentrations and in paraoxonase-1 activity. Regarding the in vitro assay to estimate lipid transfer to HDL, there were no changes when comparing the euthyroid to the hypothyroid state, but when adjusted for HDL-C, the unesterified cholesterol (0.14 ± 0.03 vs. 0.11 ± 0.02; p &lt; 0.0001), triglycerides (0.11 ± 0.02 vs. 0.09 ± 0.02; p &lt; 0.0001), phospholipids (0.44 ± 0.09 vs. 0.40 ± 0.07; p = 0.0205), and esterified cholesterol (0.14 ± 0.03 vs. 0.13 ± 0.03; p = 0.0043) transfer to HDL were all diminished in hypothyroidism.
In short-term hypothyroidism, HDL-C increased, but this did not increase the capacity of the HDL fraction to receive lipids or the activity of paraoxonase-1, the anti-oxidation enzyme associated to HDL.
Despite the critical need for lifelong treatment of inherited and genetic diseases, there are no developmental efforts for most such diseases due to their rarity. Recent progress in gene therapy, including the approvals of two products (Glybera and Strimvelis) that may provide patients with sustained effects, has shed light on the development of gene therapy products. Most gene therapy products are based on either adeno-associated virus-mediated in vivo gene transfer to target tissues or administration of ex vivo gene-transduced hematopoietic cells. In such circumstances, there is room for different approaches to provide clinicians with other therapeutic options through a variety of principles based on studies not only to gain an understanding of the pathological mechanisms of diseases, but also to understand the physiological functions of target tissues and cells. In this review, we summarize recent progress in gene therapy-mediated enzyme replacement and introduce a different approach using adipocytes to enable lifelong treatment for intractable plasma protein deficiencies.
24-hydroxycholesterol (24OH-C) is synthesized almost exclusively in neurons. This oxysterol is mostly present as ester form in both cerebrospinal fluid and plasma. The enzyme lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase esterifies 24OH-C in the brain, and the level of 24OH-C esters in cerebrospinal fluid was found to be correlated with the level of 24OH-C esters in plasma. Decreased levels of 24OH-C esters levels were previously found in Alzheimer's disease and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis. This finding was attributed to the inhibitory effect of oxidative stress on lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase activity in neurodegenerative conditions. Data reported here show that the plasma level of 24OH-C esters is decreased also in Parkinson's disease. ROC analysis identified 69.0% of 24OH-C esterification as the threshold (AUC = 0.98) discriminating patients (N = 19) from healthy subjects (N = 19) with 100% specificity vs controls, 89.5% sensitivity, 94.7% accuracy, and 100% precision. The level of 24OH-C esters was not correlated with UPDRS I or UPDRS III when evaluated at the time of blood sampling. By contrast, it was negatively correlated with UPDRS I (r = -0.4984, p = 0.0299) after one year of follow up. Therefore, this level might represent a novel biomarker of neurodegeneration in Parkinson's disease. The biomarker level is here proposed as a measure to evaluate the severity of disease, as well as to monitor the progression of this pathology.
Statin therapy is recommended in type 2 diabetes (T2DM) although views on treatment intensity and therapeutic targets remain divided.
Our objectives were to compare the effects of high-intensity and moderate-intensity atorvastatin treatment on lipoprotein metabolism and inflammatory markers and how frequently treatment goals are met in high-risk T2DM patients.
Patients with T2DM and albuminuria (urinary albumin:creatinine ratio &gt;5 mg/mmol, total cholesterol &lt;7 mmol/L, proteinuria &lt;2 g/d, creatinine &lt;200 μmol/L) were randomized to receive atorvastatin 10 mg (n = 59) or 80 mg (n = 60) daily. Baseline and 1-year follow-up data are reported.
Patients were at high cardiovascular disease risk (observed combined mortality and nonfatal cardiovascular disease annual event rate 4.8%). The non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) goal of &lt;2.6 mmol/L was achieved in 72% of participants receiving high-dose atorvastatin, but only in 40% on low-dose atorvastatin (P &lt; .005). The proportion achieving apolipoprotein B (apoB) &lt;0.8 g/L on high-dose and low-dose atorvastatin was 82% and 70%, respectively (NS). Total cholesterol, triglycerides, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, non-HDL-C, oxidized LDL, apoB, glyc-apoB, apolipoprotein E, and lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2 decreased significantly, more so in participants on high-dose atorvastatin. Adiponectin increased and serum amyloid A decreased without dose dependency. Neither dose produced significant changes in HDL-C, cholesterol efflux, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, glycated hemoglobin, serum paraoxonase-1, lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase, or cholesteryl ester transfer protein.
High-dose atorvastatin is more effective in achieving non-HDL-C therapeutic goals and in modifying LDL-related parameters. Recommended apoB treatment targets may require revision. Despite the increase in adiponectin and the decrease in serum amyloid A, HDL showed no change in functionality.
Patients with post-cardiac arrest syndrome (PCAS) suffer from whole body ischemia/reperfusion injury similar to that experienced by newborn babies. Increased oxidative stress was confirmed in PCAS patients (n = 40) at the time of hospitalization by a significant increase in the percentage of the oxidized form of coenzyme Q10 in total coenzyme Q10 compared to age-matched healthy controls (n = 55). Tissue oxidative damage in patients was suggested by the significant increase in plasma levels of free fatty acids (FFA) and the significant decrease in polyunsaturated fatty acid contents in total FFA. A greater decrease in free cholesterol (FC) compared to cholesterol esters (CE) was observed. Therefore, the FC/CE ratio significantly increased, suggesting deficiency of lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase secreted from the liver. Time course changes of the above parameters were compared among 6 groups of patients divided according to outcome severity. Rapid declines of FC and CE were observed in patients who died within a day, while levels remained unchanged in patients discharged in a week. These data suggest that liver function is one of the key factors determining the survival of patients. Interestingly, therapeutic hypothermia treatment enhanced the increment of plasma ratio of coenzyme Q10 to total cholesterol at the end of rewarming.
Di'ao Xinxuekang (XXK) is an herbal product in China and the Netherlands that has been clinically shown to attenuate atherosclerosis; however, the underlying antiatherosclerotic mechanism remains unclear. Because of its role in cholesterol homeostasis, reverse cholesterol transport (RCT) is a potential target for these beneficial effects. This study investigated the effects of XXK on RCT and related proteins. After treating ApoE-deficient mice with XXK for 8 weeks, we observed an increase in the expression level of ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 and ATP-binding cassette transporter G1, which in turn stimulated cholesterol efflux and reduced aortic atherosclerotic lesion area. XXK also increased high-density lipoprotein (HDL) synthesis by modulating the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ/liver X receptor α/ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 pathway and promoted HDL maturity by increasing serum lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase. In addition, XXK improved the selective uptake of HDL-cholesteryl ester by increasing the expression of scavenger receptor class B type I. This is the first study to show that XXK confers a regulation of RCT, at least in part, by improving HDL synthesis, maturation, and catabolism.
Psoriasis is a systemic inflammatory disease associated with increased cardiovascular (CV) risk and altered lipid metabolism. Tofacitinib is an oral Janus kinase inhibitor.
The aim of the study was to investigate the effects of tofacitinib on traditional and nontraditional lipid parameters and CV risk markers in patients with psoriasis from a phase III study, OPT Pivotal 1.
Patients with psoriasis were randomized to tofacitinib 5 or 10 mg twice daily (BID) or placebo BID. Serum samples were collected at baseline, week 4, and week 16. Analyses included serum cholesterol levels, triglycerides, lipoproteins, lipid particles, lipid-related parameters/CV risk markers, and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) function analyses.
At week 16, small concurrent increases in mean low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and HDL cholesterol (HDL-C) levels were observed with tofacitinib; total cholesterol/HDL-C ratio did not change. There was no significant change in the number of small dense LDL particles, which are considered to be more atherogenic than large particles, and oxidized LDL did not increase. Paraoxonase 1 activity, linked to HDL antioxidant capacity, increased, and HDL-associated serum amyloid A, which reduces the anti-atherogenic potential of HDL, decreased. HDL capacity to promote cholesterol efflux from macrophages did not change. Lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase activity, which is associated with reverse cholesterol transport, increased. Markers of systemic inflammation, serum amyloid A and C-reactive protein, decreased with tofacitinib.
While small increases in lipid levels are observed with tofacitinib treatment in patients with psoriasis, effects on selected lipid-related parameters and other circulating CV risk biomarkers are not suggestive of an increased CV risk [NCT01276639].
Hypertriglyceridemia is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Apolipoprotein C-II (APOC2) is an obligatory cofactor for lipoprotein lipase (LPL), the major enzyme catalyzing plasma triglyceride hydrolysis. We have created an apoc2 knockout zebrafish model, which mimics the familial chylomicronemia syndrome (FCS) in human patients with a defect in the APOC2 or LPL gene. In this study, we measured plasma levels of free cholesterol (FC) and cholesterol esters (CE) and found that apoc2 mutant zebrafish have a significantly higher FC to CE ratio (FC/CE), when compared to the wild type. Feeding apoc2 mutant zebrafish a low-fat diet reduced triglyceride levels but not the FC/CE ratio. In situ hybridization and qPCR results demonstrated that the hepatic expression of lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase (lcat), the enzyme responsible for esterifying plasma FC to CE, and of apolipoprotein A-I, a major protein component of HDL, were dramatically decreased in apoc2 mutants. Furthermore, the FC/CE ratio was significantly increased in the whole plasma and in a chylomicron-depleted fraction of human FCS patients. The FCS plasma LCAT activity was significantly lower than that of healthy controls. In summary, this study, using a zebrafish model and human patient samples, reports for the first time the defect in plasma cholesterol esterification associated with LPL deficiency.
Background: HDL function may be more important than HDL concentration in determining risk for cardiovascular disease. In addition, HDL is a carrier of carotenoids and antioxidant enzymes, which protect HDL and LDL particles against oxidation.Objective: The goal of this study was to determine the impact of consuming 0-3 eggs/d on LDL and HDL particle size, HDL function, and plasma antioxidants in a young, healthy population.Methods: Thirty-eight healthy men and women [age 18-30 y, body mass index (in kg/m2) 18.5-29.9] participated in this 14-wk crossover intervention. Subjects underwent a 2-wk washout (0 eggs/d) followed by sequentially increasing intake of 1, 2, and 3 eggs/d for 4 wk each. After each period, fasting blood was collected for analysis of lipoprotein subfractions, plasma apolipoprotein (apo) concentration, lutein and zeaxanthin concentration, and activities of lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase, cholesteryl ester transfer protein, and paraoxonase-1.Results: Compared with intake of 0 eggs/d, consuming 1-3 eggs/d resulted in increased large-LDL (21-37%) and large-HDL (6-13%) particle concentrations, plasma apoAI (9-15%), and lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase activity (5-15%) (P &lt; 0.05 for all biomarkers). Intake of 2-3 eggs/d also promoted an 11% increase in apoAII (P &lt; 0.05) and a 20-31% increase in plasma lutein and zeaxanthin (P &lt; 0.05), whereas intake of 3 eggs/d resulted in a 9-16% increase in serum paraoxonase-1 activity compared with intake of 1-2 eggs/d (P &lt; 0.05). Egg intake did not affect cholesteryl ester transfer protein activity.Conclusions: Intake of 1 egg/d was sufficient to increase HDL function and large-LDL particle concentration; however, intake of 2-3 eggs/d supported greater improvements in HDL function as well as increased plasma carotenoids. Overall, intake of ≤3 eggs/d favored a less atherogenic LDL particle profile, improved HDL function, and increased plasma antioxidants in young, healthy adults. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT02531958.
Plasma concentration of lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) was reported to decrease in patients with sepsis. However, the mechanisms of sepsis-induced decrease in plasma LPC levels are not currently well known. In mice subjected to cecal ligation and puncture (CLP), a model of polymicrobial peritoneal sepsis, we examined alterations in LPC-related metabolic parameters in plasma, i.e., the plasma concentration of LPC-related substances (i.e., phosphatidylcholine (PC) and lysophosphatidic acid (LPA)), and activities or levels in the plasma of some enzymes that can be involved in the regulation of plasma LPC concentration (i.e., secretory phospholipase A2 (sPLA2), lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT), acyl-CoA:lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase (LPCAT), and autotaxin (ATX)), as well as plasma albumin concentration. We found that levels of LPC and albumin and enzyme activities of LCAT, ATX, and sPLA2 were decreased, whereas levels of PC, LPA, and LPCAT1-3 were increased in the plasma of mice subjected to CLP. Bacterial peritonitis led to alterations in all the measured LPC-related metabolic parameters in the plasma, which could potentially contribute to sepsis-induced decrease in plasma LPC levels. These findings could lead to the novel biomarkers of sepsis.
High-density lipoprotein (HDL) plays an important role in the transport and metabolism of cholesterol. Mimics of HDL are being explored as potentially powerful therapeutic agents for removing excess cholesterol from arterial plaques. Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) functionalized with apolipoprotein A-I and with the lipids 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine and 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-N-[3-(2-pyridyldithio)propionate] have been demonstrated to be robust acceptors of cellular cholesterol. However, detailed structural information about this functionalized HDL AuNP is still lacking. In this study, we have used X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and lecithin/cholesterol acyltransferase activation experiments together with coarse-grained and all-atom molecular dynamics simulations to model the structure and cholesterol uptake properties of the HDL AuNP construct. By simulating different apolipoprotein-loaded AuNPs, we find that lipids are oriented differently in regions with and without apoA-I. We also show that in this functionalized HDL AuNP, the distribution of cholesteryl ester maintains a reverse concentration gradient that is similar to the gradient found in native HDL.
Cholesterol (C) brain accumulation seems to play a role in the Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis. 24(S)-hydroxycholesterol (24OH-C) is the predominant metabolite of brain C and its synthesis is believed to represent a way to remove excess C from neurons. Previous studies showed that 24OH-C level is altered in patients with neurodegenerative diseases, including AD. Only one study demonstrated that 24OH-C esterification is altered in neurodegenerative diseases, i.e., amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Herein we analyzed the level of 24OH-C esters (% 24OH-CE) in i) cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and homologous serum of AD (n = 13) and controls (n = 8); ii) plasma from AD (n = 30), controls (n = 30), mild cognitive impairment (MCI) converting to AD (n = 34), and stable MCI (n = 40). The % 24OH-CE in CSF positively correlated with that in homologous serum and was lower in both CSF and blood from AD patients as compared to controls; moreover, the plasma value of % 24OH-CE was lower in MCI conv-AD than in non-converters. Kaplan Meier Survival curves revealed a significant anticipation of the disease onset in AD and MCI conv-AD subjects with the lowest % 24OH-CE values. In conclusion, the reduction of % 24OH-CE in AD and MCI conv-AD, as well as the anticipation of the disease in patients with the lowest % 24OH-CE, support a role of the cholesterol/lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase axis in AD onset/progression. Thus, targeting brain cholesterol metabolism could be a valuable strategy to prevent AD associated cognitive decline.
Lipidoses occur for an abnormal storage parenchymal deposition of lipids and products of their metabolism in large amounts or sometimes, involving only some particular tissue structures. The lipid storage is usually due to an inborn error causing an enzyme absence /deficiency in the primary lipidoses and to a complex metabolism alterations in the secondary forms. However, histologically all lipid depositions look very similar, and immunohistochemical investigation, clinical pictures knowledge and genetic tests need to make a correct diagnosis. Lipid deposition causes parenchymal structural changes especially of glomeruli resulting in renal function impairment and proteinuria and haematuria appearance. This manuscript gathers clinical and histological features present in these storage pathologies. Renal involvement is described in Anderson-Fabry disease, in hyperlipoproteinemias, in lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase deficiency, in Gaucher disease and finally in secondary lipidoses features such as nephrotic syndrome, Alagille disease, and toxic or ischemic renal damage. Recently the replacement enzymatic therapy availability is substantially modifying the clinical picture and the outcome in some lipidoses such as Anderson-Fabry and Gaucher diseases. Therefore, it is import to be aware of these disorders, not only for making a correct diagnosis but also for starting, when it is possible, an effective therapy.
LCAT synthesizes most of the plasma cholesteryl esters, and plays a major role in HDL metabolism. Mutations in the LCAT gene cause two syndromes, familial LCAT deficiency (FLD) and fish-eye disease (FED), both characterized by severe alterations in plasma lipoprotein profile. Renal disease is the major cause of morbidity and mortality in FLD cases, but an established therapy is not currently available. The present therapy of LCAT deficiency is mainly aimed at correcting the dyslipidemia associated with the disease and at delaying evolution of chronic nephropathy. LCAT deficiency represents a candidate disease for enzyme replacement therapy. In vitro and in vivo studies proved the efficacy of recombinant human LCAT (rhLCAT) in correcting dyslipidemia, and rhLCAT is presently under development.
To gain insight into the genetic regulation of lipid metabolism in tomato, we conducted metabolic trait loci (mQTL) analysis following the lipidomic profiling of fruit pericarp and leaf tissue of the Solanum pennellii introgression lines (IL). To enhance mapping resolution for selected fruit-specific mQTL, we profiled the lipids in a subset of independently derived S. pennellii backcross inbred lines, as well as in a near-isogenic sub-IL population. We identified a putative lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase that controls the levels of several lipids, and two members of the class III lipase family, LIP1 and LIP2, that were associated with decreased levels of diacylglycerols (DAGs) and triacylglycerols (TAGs). Lipases of this class cleave fatty acids from the glycerol backbone of acylglycerols. The released fatty acids serve as precursors of flavor volatiles. We show that LIP1 expression correlates with fatty acid-derived volatile levels. We further confirm the function of LIP1 in TAG and DAG breakdown and volatile synthesis using transgenic plants. Taken together, our study extensively characterized the genetic architecture of lipophilic compounds in tomato and demonstrated at molecular level that release of free fatty acids from the glycerol backbone can have a major impact on downstream volatile synthesis.
Cholesteryl esters are generated at multiple sites in the body by sterol O-acyltransferase (SOAT) 1 or SOAT2 in various cell types and lecithin cholesterol acyltransferase in plasma. Esterified cholesterol and triacylglycerol contained in lipoproteins cleared from the circulation via receptor-mediated or bulk-phase endocytosis are hydrolyzed by lysosomal acid lipase within the late endosomal/lysosomal (E/L) compartment. Then, through the successive actions of Niemann-Pick C (NPC) 2 and NPC 1, unesterified cholesterol (UC) is exported from the E/L compartment to the cytosol. Mutations in either NPC1 or NPC2 lead to continuing entrapment of UC in all organs, resulting in multisystem disease, which includes hepatic dysfunction and in some cases liver failure. These studies investigated primarily whether elimination of SOAT2 in NPC1-deficient mice impacted hepatic UC sequestration, inflammation, and transaminase activities. Measurements were made in 7-wk-old mice fed a low-cholesterol chow diet or one enriched with cholesterol starting 2 wk before study. In the chow-fed mice, NPC1:SOAT2 double knockouts, compared with their littermates lacking only NPC1, had 20% less liver mass, 28% lower hepatic UC concentrations, and plasma alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase activities that were decreased by 48% and 36%, respectively. mRNA expression levels for several markers of inflammation were all significantly lower in the NPC1 mutants lacking SOAT2. The existence of a new class of potent and selective SOAT2 inhibitors provides an opportunity for exploring if suppression of this enzyme could potentially become an adjunctive therapy for liver disease in NPC1 deficiency. NEW &amp; NOTEWORTHY In Niemann-Pick type C1 (NPC1) disease, the entrapment of unesterified cholesterol (UC) in the endosomal/lysosomal compartment of all cells causes multiorgan disease, including neurodegeneration, pulmonary dysfunction, and liver failure. Some of this sequestered UC entered cells initially in the esterified form. When sterol O-acyltransferase 2, a cholesterol esterifying enzyme present in enterocytes and hepatocytes, is eliminated in NPC1-deficient mice, there is a reduction in their hepatomegaly, hepatic UC content, and cellular injury.
Atherosclerosis is a systemic disease characterized by the deposition of cholesterol and inflammatory cells within the arterial wall. Removal of cholesterol from the vessel wall may have an impact on the size and composition of atherosclerotic lesions. Anionic phospholipids or liposome vesicles composed of a lipid bilayer such as nanoliposomes have been suggested as treatments for dyslipidemia. In this study, we investigated the effect of anionic nanoliposomes on atherosclerosis in a mouse model. Low-density lipoprotein receptor knockout mice (Ldlr-/- ) were fed with an atherosclerosis promoting high fat and cholesterol (HFC) diet for 12 weeks. Anionic nanoliposomes including hydrogenated soy phosphatidylcholine (HSPC) and distearoyl phosphatidylglycerol (DSPG) (molar ratio: 1:3) were injected intravenously into HFC-fed Ldlr-/- mice once a week for 4 weeks. Mice receiving nanoliposomes had significantly reduced atherosclerosis within the aortic arch as assessed by Sudan IV staining area (p = 0.007), and reduced intima/media ratio (p = 0.030) and greater collagen deposition within atherosclerosis plaques within the brachiocephalic artery (p = 0.007), compared to control mice. Administration of nanoliposomes enhanced markers of reverse cholesterol transport (RCT) and increased markers of plaque stability in HFC-fed Ldlr-/- mice. Reduced cholesterol accumulation was observed in the liver along with the up-regulation of the major genes involved in the efflux of cholesterol such as hepatic ATP-binding cassette transporters (ABC) including Abc-a1, Abc-g1, Abc-g5, and Abc-g8, Scavenger receptor class B, member 1 (Scarb1), and Liver X receptor alpha (Lxr)-α. Lecithin Cholesterol Acyltransferase activity within the plasma was also increased in mice receiving nanoliposomes. Anionic nanoliposome administration reduced atherosclerosis in HFC-fed Ldlr-/- mice by promoting RCT and upregulating the ABC-A1/ABC-G1 pathway.
Human plasma high-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations are a negative risk factor for atherosclerosis-linked cardiovascular disease. Pharmacological attempts to reduce atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease by increasing plasma high-density lipoprotein cholesterol have been disappointing so that recent research has shifted from HDL quantity to HDL quality, that is, functional vs dysfunctional HDL. HDL has varying degrees of dysfunction reflected in impaired reverse cholesterol transport (RCT). In the context of atheroprotection, RCT occurs by 2 mechanisms: one is the well-known trans-hepatic pathway comprising macrophage free cholesterol (FC) efflux, which produces early forms of FC-rich nascent HDL (nHDL). Lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase converts HDL-FC to HDL-cholesteryl ester while converting nHDL from a disc to a mature spherical HDL, which transfers its cholesteryl ester to the hepatic HDL receptor, scavenger receptor B1 for uptake, conversion to bile salts, or transfer to the intestine for excretion. Although widely cited, current evidence suggests that this is a minor pathway and that most HDL-FC and nHDL-FC rapidly transfer directly to the liver independent of lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase activity. A small fraction of plasma HDL-FC enters the trans-intestinal efflux pathway comprising direct FC transfer to the intestine. SR-B1-/- mice, which have impaired trans-hepatic FC transport, are characterized by high plasma levels of a dysfunctional FC-rich HDL that increases plasma FC bioavailability in a way that produces whole-body hypercholesterolemia and multiple pathologies. The design of future therapeutic strategies to improve RCT will have to be formulated in the context of these dual RCT mechanisms and the role of FC bioavailability.
We describe a case of fish-eye disease (FED) where the clinical features and visual function were investigated using anterior segment optical coherence tomography (OCT) and quantitative measurements.
A 36-year-old Japanese woman with FED presented with bilateral corneal opacities and visual complaints. Both contrast sensitivity and straylight were measured and OCT imaging was performed. Contrast sensitivity and straylight measurements revealed remarkably decreased visual function, despite good visual acuity. OCT demonstrated homogenously hyper-reflective corneal opacification, and a normal total corneal thickness.
The findings from this case suggest that OCT is useful for analyzing the clinical features of FED, and that the quantitative measurement of visual function furthers the understanding of vision-related symptoms in FED, despite good visual acuity.
We report the case of a 39-year-old West African man in whom high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) was identified as undetectable at &lt;0.08 mmol/L. Total cholesterol in the same sample was 2.85 mmol/L; triglycerides were only mildly elevated at 2.32 mmol/L. He was admitted with a 2-week history of polydipsia, polyuria, weight loss and hyperpyrexia. Dual malarial infection with Plasmodium ovale and falciparum was identified and attributed to a recent trip to Nigeria without chemoprophylaxis. Also, he was diagnosed with diabetes mellitus with random hyperglycemia of 39 mmol/L but no ketonemia. Subsequent investigation revealed a low apolipoprotein A1 of 0.38 g/L (1.04-2.02), confirming a true HDL-C deficit. On clinical examination, he had neither orange tonsils consistent with Tangier disease nor corneal opacification consistent with lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase deficiency. The patient was an avid gym goer but denied anabolic steroid abuse, a fact supported by a transient primary testosterone deficiency at presentation (testosterone 6.56 nmol/L, RR 8.6-29; follicle-stimulating hormone high at 9.2 mU/L, luteinising hormone high at 11.9 mU/L). He was treated for malaria and started on metformin for diabetes. At 8-week follow-up, his HDL-C was entirely normal at 1.38 mmol/L. We believe this severe drop in HDL-C level to be due to acute inflammation caused by malaria. As extreme drops in HDL-C have been found to be associated with the poorest prognosis, prospective identification of HDL-C and prompt clinical liaison may be of benefit.
Lipoprotein-X (Lp-X) is an abnormal lipoprotein containing abundant free cholesterol and phospholipids, as well as some apolipoprotein E (apoE). Serum Lp-X increases in patients with cholestasis and lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase deficiency, as well as in those receiving intravenous lipid emulsion. Lp-X is often associated with skin xanthomas in cholestatic patients. However, earlier studies showed that Lp-X is not taken up by murine macrophages, but exerts antiatherogenic actions. In this review, we discuss the heterogeneity of Lp-X and its potential atherogenicity.
Mass spectrometry revealed that Lp-X of cholestatic patients is similar in lipid composition to low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and high-density lipoprotein, but not to bile acids, suggesting that Lp-X is synthesized in the liver. Palmar xanthomas appear in patients with cholestasis, but regress over months after improvement of hypercholesterolemia. Lp-X isolated from cholestatic patients is rich in apoE, and causes more lipid accumulation than oxidized LDL and acetyl LDL in human monocyte-derived macrophages.
Lp-X is heterogeneous in apoE content. Lp-X is taken up in cholestatic patients by apoE-recognizing lipoprotein receptors. Further research is warranted to fully understand the atherogenicity of Lp-X and the clinical significance of elevated Lp-X concentrations, particularly in cholestatic patients.
Human apolipoprotein C1 (APOC1) is a 57 amino acid long polypeptide that, through its potent inhibition of cholesteryl ester transferase protein, helps regulate the transfer of lipids between lipid particles. We have now determined the structure of APOC1 in four crystal forms by X-ray diffraction. A molecule of APOC1 is a single, slightly bent, α-helix having 13-14 turns and a length of about 80 Å. APOC1 exists as a dimer, but the dimers are not the same in the four crystals. In two monoclinic crystals, two helices closely engage one another in an antiparallel fashion. The interactions between monomers are almost entirely hydrophobic with sparse electrostatic complements. In the third monoclinic crystal, the two monomers spread at one end of the dimer, like a scissor opening, and, by translation along the crystallographic a axis, form a continuous, contiguous sheet through the crystal. In the orthorhombic crystals, two molecules of APOC1 are related by a noncrystallographic 2-fold axis to create an arc of about 120 Å length. This symmetrical dimer utilizes interactions not present in dimers of the monoclinic crystals. Versatility of APOC1 monomer association shown by these crystals is suggestive of physiological function.
CSL112 (apolipoprotein A-I [human]) is a novel intravenous formulation of plasma-derived apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I) that enhances cholesterol efflux capacity. Renal impairment is a common comorbidity in acute myocardial infarction patients and is associated with impaired lipid metabolism. The aim of this phase 1 study was to assess the impact of moderate renal impairment on the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile of CSL112. Sixteen subjects with moderate renal impairment and 16 age-, sex-, and weight-matched subjects with normal renal function participated in the study. Within each renal function cohort, subjects were randomized 3:1 to receive a single intravenous infusion of CSL112 2 g (n = 6) or placebo (n = 2) or CSL112 6 g (n = 6) or placebo (n = 2). At baseline, subjects with moderate renal impairment versus normal renal function had higher total cholesterol efflux, ABCA1-dependent cholesterol efflux capacity, and pre-β1-high-density lipoprotein (HDL) levels. Infusing CSL112 resulted in similar, immediate, robust, dose-dependent elevations in apoA-I and cholesterol efflux capacity in both renal function cohorts and significantly greater elevations in pre-β1-HDL (P &lt; .05) in moderate renal impairment. Lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase activity, demonstrated by a time-dependent change in the ratio of unesterified to esterified cholesterol, did not differ by renal function. No meaningful changes in proatherogenic lipid levels were observed. Moderate renal impairment did not impact the ability of CSL112 to enhance cholesterol efflux capacity. CSL112 may represent a novel therapy to reduce the risk of early recurrent cardiovascular events following acute myocardial infarction in patients with or without moderate renal impairment.
β2-Glycoprotein I (β2-GPI) is a plasma protein that binds to oxidized low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and negatively charged substances, and inhibits platelet activation and blood coagulation. In this study, we investigated the interaction of β2-GPI with a negatively charged lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) in platelet aggregation and blood clotting. Two negatively charged lysophospholipids, LPA and lysophosphatidylserine, specifically inhibited the binding of β2-GPI to oxidized LDL in a concentration-dependent manner. Intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence studies demonstrated that emission intensity of β2-GPI decreases in an LPA-concentration-dependent manner without a shift in wavelength maxima. LPA specifically induced the aggregation of β2-GPI in phosphate-buffered saline, and in incubated plasma and serum, both of which are known to accumulate LPA by the action of lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase and lysophospholipase D/autotaxin. β2-GPI aggregated by LPA did not inhibit activated von Willebrand factor-induced aggregation, and did not prolong the activated partial thromboplastin time in blood plasma, in contrast to non-aggregated β2-GPI. These results suggest that β2-GPI aggregated by the binding to LPA fails to inhibit platelet aggregation and blood clotting in contrast to non-aggregated β2-GPI.
Sepsis remains one of the leading causes of death in intensive care units. The early phase of sepsis is characterized by a massive formation of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species such as superoxide and nitric oxide. However, few comprehensive studies on plasma antioxidants have been reported. Increased oxidative stress was confirmed in sepsis patients (n = 18) at the time of hospitalization by a significant decrease in plasma ascorbic acid and a significant increase in the percentage of oxidized form of coenzyme Q10 in total coenzyme Q10 compared to age-matched healthy controls (n = 62). Tissue oxidative damage in patients was suggested by a significant decrease in polyunsaturated fatty acid contents and a significant increase in oleic acid contents in total free fatty acids. Thus, it is reasonable that plasma uric acid (end product of purines) would be significantly elevated. However, uric acid levels were continuously decreased during hospitalization for 7 days, indicating a continuous formation of peroxynitrite. A greater decrease in free cholesterol (FC) compared to cholesterol esters (CE) was observed. Thus, the FC/CE ratio significantly increased, suggesting deficiency of lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase secreted from the liver. Plasma levels of prosaposin, a coenzyme Q10 binding protein, significantly decreased as compared to healthy controls. This may be correlated with renal injury in sepsis patients, since the kidney is thought to be a major secretor of prosaposin.
A simple and reproducible procedure for enrichment of a plasma protein subfraction suitable for two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (2DE) was developed, using a Triton X-114-based cloud point extraction (CPE). Appropriate conditions for such a CPE procedure were found by SDS-PAGE to be a plasma protein concentration of about 10mg/ml in 3% (w/v) Triton X-114. 2DE of proteins obtained by CPE of 400 μl of human plasma revealed about 200 spots constituting a spot pattern very different from the pattern of total plasma. The CPE procedure only had a limited contribution to the technical variation. Identification of about 60 spots, representing only 22 proteins, revealed that several proteins in the obtained subfraction were present in more isoforms or modifications. Among these were apolipoproteins (A-1, D, E, L1, and M), haptoglobin-related protein, phosphatidylcholine-sterol acyltransferase, serum amyloid A, and serum paraoxonase/arylesterase 1, which are proteins of a hydrophobic nature, as in plasma they relate to lipoprotein particles. Thus, Triton X-114-based CPE is a simple plasma prefractionation tool, attractive for detailed 2DE studies of hydrophobic plasma proteins and their isoforms or modifications.
Estradiol is a major drug used clinically to alleviate osteoporosis, partly through inhibition of the activity of osteoclasts, which play a crucial role in bone resorption. So far, little is known about the effects of estradiol on osteoclast metabolism. In this study, ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC/MS)-based metabolomics strategy was used to investigate the metabolite response to 17β-estradiol in mouse osteoclast RAW264.7, a commonly used cell model for studying osteoporosis. Our results showed that the application of estradiol altered the levels of 27 intracellular metabolites, including lysophosphatidylcholines (LysoPCs), other lipids and amino acid derivants. The changes of all the 27 metabolites were observed in the study of estradiol induced osteoclast proliferation inhibition (1 μM estradiol applied), while the changes of only 18 metabolites were observed in the study of differentiation inhibition (0.1 μM estradiol applied). Further pathway impact analysis determined glycerophospholipid metabolism as the main potential target pathway of estradiol, which was further confirmed by LCAT (phosphatidylcholine-sterol acyltransferase) activity changes and lipid peroxidative product (MDA, methane dicarboxylic aldehyde) changes caused by estradiol. Additionally, we found that estradiol significantly decreased intracellular oxidative stress during cell proliferation but not during cell differentiation. Our study suggested that estradiol generated a highly condition-dependent influence on osteoclast metabolism. 
The effects of Portulaca oleracea (Po) lyophilized aqueous extract were determined on the serum high-density lipoproteins (HDL2 and HDL3) amounts and composition, as well as on lecithin: cholesterol acyltansferase (LCAT) activity.
Male Wistar rats (n = 12) were fed on 1% cholesterol-enriched diet for 10 days. After this phase, hypercholesterolemic rats (HC) were divided into two groups fed the same diet supplemented or not with Portulaca oleracea (Po-HC) (0.5%) for four weeks.
Serum total cholesterol (TC) and triacylglycerols (TG), and liver TG values were respectively 1.6-, 1.8-, and 1.6-fold lower in Po-HC than in HC group. Cholesterol concentrations in LDL-HDL1, HDL2, and HDL3 were respectively 1.8, 1.4-, and 2.4-fold decreased in Po-HC group. HDL2 and HDL3 amounts, which were the sum of apolipoproteins (apos), TG, cholesteryl esters (CE), unesterified cholesterol (UC), and phospholipids (PL) contents, were respectively 4.5-fold higher and 1.2-fold lower with Po treatment. Indeed, enhanced LCAT activity (1.2-fold), its cofactor-activator apo A-I (2-fold) and its reaction product HDL2-CE (2.1-fold) were observed, whereas HDL3-PL (enzyme substrate) and HDL3-UC (acyl group acceptor) were 1.2- and 2.4-fold lower.
Portulaca oleracea reduces triglyceridemia, cholesterolemia, and improves reverse cholesterol transport in rat fed enriched-cholesterol diet, contributing to anti-atherogenic effects.
A mismatch between early developmental diet and adulthood may increase obesity risk. Our objective was to determine the effects of re-matching rats to their weaning diets high in protein or fiber after transient high-fat/high-sucrose challenge in adulthood. We hypothesize that a long-term high fiber diet will be associated with a gut microbiota and hepatic gene expression reflective of reduced adiposity. Wistar rat pups were fed a control (C), high prebiotic fiber (HF), or high protein (HP) diet from 3-15 weeks of age; a high-fat/high-sucrose diet from 15-21 weeks; their respective C, HF, or HP diets from 21-25 weeks. Gut microbiota of cecal contents and hepatic gene expression were measured when rats were terminated at 25 weeks of age. HF rats had higher total bacteria, bifidobacteria and Bacteroides/Prevotella spp than C and HP at 25 weeks (P &lt; 0.05). Firmicutes, especially Clostridium leptum, decreased in HF compared to C and HP (P &lt; .05). The ratio of Firmicutes:Bacteroidetes was markedly lower in HF versus C and HP at 25 weeks (P &lt; .05). HF decreased hepatic cholesterol content compared to HP and C at 25 weeks. HF and HP increased 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase mRNA and decreased lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase mRNA compared to C (P &lt; .05). In conclusion, re-matching rats to a HF but not HP diet attenuated the typical increase in Firmicutes:Bacteroidetes ratio associated with consumption of a high fat diet. Lower hepatic cholesterol with long-term HF diet intake may be related to alterations in gut microbiota and hepatic lipid metabolism. 
Lecithin cholesterol acyl transferase (LCAT) is a plasma enzyme which esterifies cholesterol, and plays a key role in the metabolism of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C). Genetic disorders of LCAT are associated with lipoprotein abnormalities including low levels of HDL-C and presence of lipoprotein X, and clinical features mainly corneal opacities, changes in erythrocyte morphology and renal failure. Recombinant LCAT is being developed for the treatment of patients with LCAT deficiency.
In order to evaluate the effects of extract by SCE (supercritical carbon dioxide extraction) from cole pollen on lipid metabolism in hyperlipidemic rats, the experimental hyperlipidemic rats were established by providing with high fat diets, and randomized into six groups. After four weeks of perfusion diets into stomach, the rats were executed, and lipid levels of serum and hepatic tissue were detected. The serum levels of TC and TG were significantly lower in the pollen extract groups and MC group than in HFC group. Hepatic TC levels were decreased in rats fed pollen extract and lovastatin compared with HFC group. A higher concentration of HDL-C and apoAI in hepatic tissue was measured after intake of the pollen extract compared to the HFC group (P &lt; 0.05). LCAT activity in serum of pollen extract groups was significantly higher than that in HFC group, and also HMG-CoA reductase showed decreasing tendency in pollen extract groups. The contents of DHA in pollen extract groups were found higher than those in HFC group. Cole pollen extract enriched in alpha-linolenic acid is likely to be a novel source of ALA which is probably responsible for favorable lipid changes through promoting transportation, excretion, and metabolism of cholesterol in hepatic tissue and serum. 
Epidemiological studies have shown a strong inverse relationship between high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (HDLc) levels and coronary artery disease (CAD), and a low concentration of plasma HDLc is considered an independent risk factor for premature atherosclerosis. Mutations in ATP-binding cassette A1 transporter (ABCA1), cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP), and lecithin: cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) reduce HDLc in humans.
To date, no study had tested the association between these polymorphisms and premature CAD (PCAD) in the Egyptian population. Here we searched for ABCA1 (rs2230806), CETP (rs708272), and LCAT (rs5923) mutations in the Egyptian population and investigated the possible association between these gene polymorphisms and PCAD. We aimed to investigate the association between ABCA1, CETP, and LCAT gene polymorphisms and PCAD in Egyptians.
A total of 235 Egyptians-116 with documented PCAD (PCAD group) and 119 controls-were enrolled in the study.
Mutation carriers with low HDLc had an elevated risk of PCAD (odds ratio [OR] = 11.38 for ABCA1 mutation carriers, P = .000; OR = 5.41 for CETP mutation carriers, P = .000; OR = 5.92 for LCAT mutation carriers, P = .000). Moreover, mutations in ABCA1, CETP, and LCAT were significantly associated with hyperlipidemia in this study.
These observations show that the R allele of ABCA1, the B1 allele of CETP, and the T allele LCAT genes are associated with PCAD in Egyptians. They have more considerable effect on patients with low HDLc.
It has been suggested that a low plasma high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) level contributes to the high cardiovascular disease risk of patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), especially those undergoing haemodialysis (HD). The present study was conducted to gain further understanding of the mechanism(s) responsible for the low HDL-C levels in patients with CKD and to separate the impact of HD from that of the underlying CKD.
Plasma lipids and lipoproteins, HDL subclasses and various cholesterol esterification parameters were measured in a total of 248 patients with CKD, 198 of whom were undergoing HD treatment and 40 healthy subjects.
Chronic kidney disease was found to be associated with highly significant reductions in plasma HDL-C, unesterified cholesterol, apolipoprotein (apo)A-I, apoA-II and LpA-I:A-II levels in both CKD cohorts (with and without HD treatment). The cholesterol esterification process was markedly impaired, as indicated by reductions in plasma lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) concentration and activity and cholesterol esterification rate, and by an increase in the plasma preβ-HDL content. HD treatment was associated with a further lowering of HDL levels and impaired plasma cholesterol esterification. The plasma HDL-C level was highly significantly correlated with LCAT concentration (R = 0.438, P &lt; 0.001), LCAT activity (R = 0.243, P &lt; 0.001) and cholesterol esterification rate (R = 0.149, P = 0.031). Highly significant correlations were also found between plasma LCAT concentration and levels of apoA-I (R = 0.432, P &lt; 0.001), apoA-II (R = 0.275, P &lt; 0.001), LpA-I (R = 0.326, P &lt; 0.001) and LpA-I:A-II (R = 0.346, P &lt; 0.001).
Acquired LCAT deficiency is a major cause of low plasma HDL levels in patients with CKD, thus LCAT is an attractive target for therapeutic intervention to reverse dyslipidaemia, and possibly lower the cardiovascular disease risk in these patients.
This study aims to evaluate the genetic basis and activity of lecithin cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) in a novel Mongolian gerbil model for hyperlipidemia. Gerbils may be susceptible to high fat and cholesterol (HF/HC) diets, which can rapidly lead to the development of hyperlipidemia. Approximately 10-30% of gerbils that are over 8months old and fed controlled diets spontaneously develop hyperlipidemia. Using the HF/HC diet model, we detected triglycerides (TG), total cholesterol (TC), HDL (high density lipoprotein)-C, LDL (low density lipoprotein)-C and LCAT in both old (&gt;8months) and young gerbils. The TC and HDL-C levels were two times higher in old gerbils compared with young gerbils (P&lt;0.01). However, in the old group the LCAT activity fell slightly compared with the normal lipidemia group. It is reasonable to hypothesize that this may be associated with single nucleotide polymorphisms of the LCAT gene. We cloned this gene to investigate the sensitivity of the gerbil to the HF/HC diet and spontaneous hyperlipidemia. The entire LCAT gene was cloned by splicing sequences of RACE (rapid amplification of cDNA ends) and nest-PCR products (AN: KC533867.1). The results showed that the 3683base pair gene consists of six exons and five introns. The LCAT protein consists of 444 amino acid (AA) residues, which are analogous to the human LCAT gene, and includes 24 signal peptide AA and 420 mature protein AA. Expression of LCAT was detected in the kidney, spleen and adrenal tissue, apart from the liver, by immunohistochemistry. The abundance of the protein was greater in the older group compared with the control group. Polymorphisms were analyzed by PCR-SSCP (PCR-single-strand conformation polymorphism) but none were found in 444 animals of the ZCLA closed population (a Chinese cultured laboratory gerbil population). 
The ability of apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I) to transport cholesterol from atherosclerotic plaque is thought to underlie its inverse correlation with cardiovascular risk. To gauge the potential of infused apoA-I to transport cholesterol, we quantified cholesterol transport markers in human subjects infused with a novel formulation of apoA-I (CSL112).
CSL112 was infused into human subjects in single (57 subjects) and multiple (36 subjects) ascending dose trials. Pharmacokinetic and biomarker assessments were conducted before and after infusions. CSL112 caused an immediate, up to 3-fold elevation of apoA-I and subsequent movement of tissue cholesterol into plasma. Cholesterol appeared first as unesterified cholesterol in the high-density lipoprotein (HDL) fraction and was promptly esterified by lecithin cholesterol acyltransferase. HDL cholesterol increased up to 81±16.5%. Underlying this movement of cholesterol was an immediate and strong rise in the ability of plasma to promote cholesterol efflux from cells ex vivo. CSL112 had its greatest impact on the fraction of efflux mediated by ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1), a cholesterol transporter induced in cholesterol-loaded tissues such as plaque. ABCA1-dependent efflux capacity increased ≤630±421% and total efflux capacity by ≤192±40%. In keeping with this finding, we observed a profound rise in very small HDL, also known as preβ1-HDL, the preferred substrate for ABCA1. Very small HDL increased ≤3596±941%. Elevations in apoA-I, cholesterol efflux, and very small HDL were dose-proportional over a wide range. No significant changes in atherogenic lipids were observed at any dose.
Infusion of CSL112 elevates the ability of plasma to withdraw cholesterol from cells. Preferential elevation of ABCA1-dependent efflux may target atherosclerotic plaque for cholesterol removal, making CSL112 a promising candidate therapy for acute coronary syndrome.
A key step in plasma HDL maturation from discoidal to spherical particles is the esterification of cholesterol to cholesteryl ester, which is catalyzed by LCAT. HDL-like lipoproteins in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) are also spherical, whereas nascent lipoprotein particles secreted from astrocytes are discoidal, suggesting that LCAT may play a similar role in the CNS. In plasma, apoA-I is the main LCAT activator, while in the CNS, it is believed to be apoE. apoE is directly involved in the pathological progression of Alzheimer's disease, including facilitating β-amyloid (Aβ) clearance from the brain, a function that requires its lipidation by ABCA1. However, whether apoE particle maturation by LCAT is also required for Aβ clearance is unknown. Here we characterized the impact of LCAT deficiency on CNS lipoprotein metabolism and amyloid pathology. Deletion of LCAT from APP/PS1 mice resulted in a pronounced decrease of apoA-I in plasma that was paralleled by decreased apoA-I levels in CSF and brain tissue, whereas apoE levels were unaffected. Furthermore, LCAT deficiency did not increase Aβ or amyloid in APP/PS1 LCAT(-/-) mice. Finally, LCAT expression and plasma activity were unaffected by age or the onset of Alzheimer's-like pathology in APP/PS1 mice. Taken together, these results suggest that apoE-containing discoidal HDLs do not require LCAT-dependent maturation to mediate efficient Aβ clearance. 
While genetic determinants strongly influence HDL cholesterol (HDLc) levels, most genetic causes underlying variation in HDLc remain unknown. We aimed to identify novel rare mutations with large effects in candidate genes contributing to extreme HDLc in humans, utilizing family-based Mendelian genetics. We performed next-generation sequencing of 456 candidate HDLc-regulating genes in 200 unrelated probands with extremely low (≤10th percentile) or high (≥90th percentile) HDLc. Probands were excluded if known mutations existed in the established HDLc-regulating genes ABCA1, APOA1, LCAT, cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP), endothelial lipase (LIPG), and UDP-N-acetyl-α-D-galactosamine:polypeptide N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase 2 (GALNT2). We identified 93 novel coding or splice-site variants in 72 candidate genes. Each variant was genotyped in the proband's family. Family-based association analyses were performed for variants with sufficient power to detect significance at P &lt; 0.05 with a total of 627 family members being assessed. Mutations in the genes glucokinase regulatory protein (GCKR), RNase L (RNASEL), leukocyte immunoglobulin-like receptor 3 (LILRA3), and dynein axonemal heavy chain 10 (DNAH10) segregated with elevated HDLc levels in families, while no mutations associated with low HDLc. Taken together, we have identified mutations in four novel genes that may play a role in regulating HDLc levels in humans. 
In familial lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) deficiency (FLD), deposition of abnormal lipoproteins in the renal stroma ultimately leads to renal failure. However, fish-eye disease (FED) does not lead to renal damage although the causative mutations for both FLD and FED lie within the same LCAT gene. This study was performed to identify the lipoproteins important for the development of renal failure in genetically diagnosed FLD in comparison with FED, using high-performance liquid chromatography with a gel filtration column.
Lipoprotein profiles of 9 patients with LCAT deficiency were examined. Four lipoprotein fractions specific to both FLD and FED were identified: (1) large lipoproteins (&gt;80 nm), (2) lipoproteins corresponding to large low-density lipoprotein (LDL), (3) lipoproteins corresponding to small LDL to large high-density lipoprotein, and (4) to small high-density lipoprotein. Contents of cholesteryl ester and triglyceride of the large LDL in FLD (below detection limit and 45.8±3.8%) and FED (20.7±6.4% and 28.0±6.5%) were significantly different, respectively. On in vitro incubation with recombinant LCAT, content of cholesteryl ester in the large LDL in FLD, but not in FED, was significantly increased (to 4.2±1.4%), whereas dysfunctional high-density lipoprotein was diminished in both FLD and FED.
Our novel analytic approach using high-performance liquid chromatography with a gel filtration column identified large LDL and high-density lipoprotein with a composition specific to FLD, but not to FED. The abnormal lipoproteins were sensitive to treatment with recombinant LCAT and thus may play a causal role in the renal pathology of FLD.
In the past 15 years, major advances have been made in understanding the role of lipids in podocyte biology. First, susceptibility to focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) and glomerular disease is associated with an APOL1 sequence variant, is expressed in podocytes and encodes apolipoprotein L1, an important component of HDL. Second, acid sphingomyelinase-like phosphodiesterase 3b encoded by SMPDL3b has a role in the conversion of sphingomyelin to ceramide and its levels are reduced in renal biopsy samples from patients with recurrent FSGS. Furthermore, decreased SMPDL3b expression is associated with increased susceptibility of podocytes to injury after exposure to sera from these patients. Third, in many individuals with membranous nephropathy, autoantibodies against the phospholipase A2 (PLA2) receptor, which is expressed in podocytes, have been identified. Whether these autoantibodies affect the activity of PLA2, which liberates arachidonic acid from glycerophospholipids and modulates podocyte function, is unknown. Fourth, clinical and experimental evidence support a role for ATP-binding cassette sub-family A member 1-dependent cholesterol efflux, free fatty acids and glycerophospolipids in the pathogenesis of diabetic kidney disease. An improved understanding of lipid biology in podocytes might provide insights to develop therapeutic targets for primary and secondary glomerulopathies. 
Since the discovery in the 1970s that plasma levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) are inversely associated with cardiovascular outcome, it has been postulated that HDL is anti-atherogenic and that increasing HDL-C levels is a promising therapeutic strategy. However, the recent failure of three orally active, HDL-C-raising agents has introduced considerable controversy, prompting the question of whether increasing the cholesterol cargo of HDL in a non-selective manner is an effective pharmacological approach for the translation of its atheroprotective and vasculoprotective activities. The interrelationships between HDL-C concentration, HDL particle number and levels of diverse HDL particle subpopulations of defined composition are complex, as are their relationships with reverse cholesterol transport and other anti-atherogenic functions. Such complexity highlights the incompleteness of our understanding of the biology of HDL particles. This article examines the HDL hypothesis in molecular and mechanistic terms, focusing on features that have been addressed, those that remain to be tested, and potential new targets for future pharmacological interventions. 
Adrenal steroidogenesis is essential for human survival and depends on the availability of the precursor cholesterol. Male subjects with low plasma levels of high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol are characterized by decreased adrenal function. Whether this is also the case in female subjects with low plasma HDL-C levels is unresolved to date.
15 female ATP binding cassette transporter AI (ABCAI) and 14 female lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) were included in the study. HDL-C levels were 38% and 41% lower in ABCA1 and LCAT mutation carriers compared to controls, respectively. Urinary steroid excretion of 17-ketogenic steroids or 17-hydroxy corticosteroids did not differ between 15 female ABCA1 mutation carriers (p = 0.27 vs 0.30 respectively) and 30 matched normolipidemic controls or between 14 female LCAT mutation carriers and 28 matched normolipidemic controls (p = 0.10 and 0.14, respectively). Cosyntropin testing in an unselected subgroup of 8 ABCA1 mutation carriers and 3 LCAT mutation carriers did not reveal differences between carriers and controls.
Adrenal function in females with molecularly defined low HDL-C levels is not different from controls. The discrepancy with the finding of impaired steroidogenesis in males with molecularly defined low HDL-C levels underscores the importance of gender specific analyses in cholesterol-related research.
Hyperlipidemia and many other metabolic diseases are related to oxidative stress. Centella asiatica is a traditional Chinese medicine whose antioxidant effect in vitro has been reported. We are interested in whether it possesses this effect in vivo and hence modulates lipid metabolism. Therefore, experiments were carried out on mice and golden hamsters regarding its antioxidant and hypolipidemic effect. We observed that a fraction (CAF3) of the ethanol extract (CAE) of Centella asiatica had a cholesterol decrease of 79% and a triglyceride decrease of 95% in acute mice model, so CAF3 was further investigated in high-fat-fed hamster model. It was shown that CAF3 increased SOD and GSH-Px activities and decreased MDA level, and it also improved TC, TG, LDL-C, HDL-C, AST, and ALT levels. L-CAT and SR-BI gene expression in hamsters were increased. Taken together, our data suggest that the CAF3 fraction of Centella asiatica has antioxidant and hypolipidemic properties. 
Among the most common lipid abnormalities, a low level of high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL‑C) is one of the first risk factors identified for coronary heart disease. Lecithin cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) has a pivotal role in the formation and maturation of HDL-C and in reverse cholesterol transport. To identify genetic loci associated with low HDL-C in a population-based cohort in Tehran, the promoter, coding regions and exon/intron boundaries of LCAT were amplified and sequenced in consecutive individuals (n=150) who had extremely low or high HDL-C levels but no other major lipid abnormalities. A total of 14 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified, of which 10 were found to be novel; the L393L, S232T and 16:67977696 C&gt;A polymorphisms have been previously reported in the SNP Database (as rs5923, rs4986970 and rs11860115, respectively) and the non-synonymous R47M mutation has been reported in the Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer (COSM972635). Three of the SNPs identified in the present study (position 6,531 in exon 5, position 6,696 in exon 5 and position 5,151 in exon 1) led to an amino acid substitution. The most common variants were L393L (4886C/T) in exon 6 and Q177E, a novel mutation, in exon 5, and the prevalence of the heterozygous genotype of these two SNPs was significantly higher in the low HDL-C groups. Univariate conditional logistic regression odds ratios (ORs) were nominally significant for Q177E (OR, 5.64; P=0.02; 95% confidence interval, 1.2‑26.2). However, this finding was attenuated following adjustment for confounders. Further studies using a larger sample size may enhance the determination of the role of these SNPs.
To examine the recent advances in our knowledge of HDL metabolism, composition, function, and coronary heart disease (CHD), as well as marked HDL deficiency states because of mutations in the apolipoprotein (apo) A-I, ATP-binding cassette transfer protein A1 and lecithin cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) gene loci.
It has been documented that apoA-I, myeloperoxidase and paraoxonase 1 (PON1) form a complex in HDL that is critical for HDL binding and function. Myeloperoxidase has a negative impact on HDL function, whereas PON1 has a beneficial effect. Patients who lack apoA-I develop markedly premature CHD. Patients who lack ATP-binding cassette transfer protein A1 transporter function have only very small discoidal preβ-1 HDL, and develop hepatosplenomegaly, intermittent neuropathy and premature CHD, although significant heterogeneity for these disorders has been reported. Patients with LCAT deficiency have abnormal small discoidal LDLs and HDL particles, and develop kidney failure. Enzyme replacement therapy is being developed for the latter disorder.
Recent data indicates that proteins other than apoA-I and apoA-II such as MPO and PON1 have important effects on HDL function. There has been considerable recent progress made in our understanding of HDL protein content and function.
The K146N/R147W substitutions in apoE3 were described in patients with a dominant form of type III hyperlipoproteinemia. The effects of these mutations on the in vivo functions of apoE were studied by adenovirus-mediated gene transfer in different mouse models. Expression of the apoE3[K146N/R147W] mutant in apoE-deficient (apoE(-/-)) or apoA-I-deficient (apoA-I(-/-))×apoE(-/-) mice exacerbated the hypercholesterolemia and increased plasma apoE and triglyceride levels. In apoE(-/-) mice, the apoE3[K146N/R147W] mutant displaced apoA-I from the VLDL/LDL/HDL region and caused the accumulation of discoidal apoE-containing HDL. The WT apoE3 cleared the cholesterol of apoE(-/-) mice without induction of hypertriglyceridemia and promoted formation of spherical HDL. A unique property of the truncated apoE3[K146N/R147W]202 mutant, compared with similarly truncated apoE forms, is that it did not correct the hypercholesterolemia. The contribution of LPL and LCAT in the induction of the dyslipidemia was studied. Treatment of apoE(-/-) mice with apoE3[K146N/R147W] and LPL corrected the hypertriglyceridemia, but did not prevent the formation of discoidal HDL. Treatment with LCAT corrected hypertriglyceridemia and generated spherical HDL. The combined data indicate that the K146N/R147W substitutions convert the full-length and the truncated apoE3[K146N/R147W] mutant into a dominant negative ligand that prevents receptor-mediated remnant clearance, exacerbates the dyslipidemia, and inhibits the biogenesis of HDL.
LCAT (lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase) catalyzes the transacylation of a fatty acid of lecithin to cholesterol, generating a cholesteryl ester and lysolecithin. The knowledge of LCAT atomic structure and the identification of the amino acids relevant in controlling its structure and function are expected to be very helpful to understand the enzyme catalytic mechanism, as involved in HDL cholesterol metabolism. However - after an early report in the late '90 s - no recent advance has been made about LCAT three-dimensional structure. In this paper, we propose an LCAT atomistic model, built following the most up-to-date molecular modeling approaches, and exploiting newly solved crystallographic structures. LCAT shows the typical folding of the α/β hydrolase superfamily, and its topology is characterized by a combination of α-helices covering a central 7-strand β-sheet. LCAT presents a Ser/Asp/His catalytic triad with a peculiar geometry, which is shared with such other enzyme classes as lipases, proteases and esterases. Our proposed model was validated through different approaches. We evaluated the impact on LCAT structure of some point mutations close to the enzyme active site (Lys218Asn, Thr274Ala, Thr274Ile) and explained, at a molecular level, their phenotypic effects. Furthermore, we devised some LCAT modulators either designed through a de novo strategy or identified through a virtual high-throughput screening pipeline. The tested compounds were proven to be potent inhibitors of the enzyme activity. 
Epidemiological and clinical studies have shown that a low plasma high‑density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) level is a strong predictor of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) is a key enzyme in the formation, maturation and function of HDL. Therefore impaired LCAT function may enhance atherosclerosis because of defective cholesterol transport. In this study, we examined a 34-year old LCAT‑deficient patient and eight first-degree family members. There was a strong family history for CVD and type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2). The proband was found homozygous for a previously reported LCAT gene mutation (Thr37Met). A sister and two sons of the proband were heterozygous for the same mutation. The proband had DM2 and showed severe multivessel coronary artery disease, corneal opacification and extremely low HDL-C levels. Large HDL particles were absent while small HDL particles were increased. The HDL of the patient had a reduced ability to promote cell cholesterol efflux, and the low‑density lipoproteins (LDL) were more susceptible to oxidation. Among his family members, two heterozygotes and one non-carrier had early carotid or coronary atherosclerosis. In conclusion, as the increased LDL oxidability and structural and functional abnormalities of HDL particles have been reported in patients with obesity and diabetes, the results suggested that the adverse coronary risk profile, and not being LCAT deficient, may be responsible for the CVD found in our proband, and for the early atherosclerosis observed in the two heterozygotes and in the wild‑type family members.
The cholesterol esterifying enzyme, lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT), plays a key role in HDL maturation and remodeling. Myeloperoxidase (MPO) may compromise LCAT enzymatic activity. We tested the extent to which plasma LCAT activity is altered in acute myocardial infarction (MI) in conjunction with abnormal MPO levels. We also assessed the impact of LCAT and MPO on newly developed major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE).
Two-hundred one consecutive patients referred for acute chest pain of whom 134 had MI (95 with ST-elevation) participated. Forty-five new MACE were ascertained during 1203 (range 13-1745) days of follow-up among 185 patients. Plasma LCAT activity was measured using an exogenous substrate assay. MPO mass was assayed by chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay.
Plasma LCAT activity was decreased by 15%, coinciding with 7-fold increased MPO levels in acute MI patients vs. patients with non-cardiac chest pain (p &lt; 0.001 for both; correlation: r = -0.343, p &lt; 0.001). MI at admission was associated independently with both lower plasma LCAT activity and higher MPO (age- and sex-adjusted odds ratio per 1 SD increment: 0.46 (95% CI, 0.31-0.68), p &lt; 0.001 and 7.58 (95% CI, 3.34-17.11), p &lt; 0.001, respectively). In an analysis with LCAT and MPO together these associations were modestly attenuated. MPO mass (hazard ratio: 1.59 (95% CI, 1.15-2.19), p = 0.004), but not LCAT activity (hazard ratio: 0.87 (95% CI, 0.65-1.19), p = 0.39), predicted newly manifest MACE.
In acute MI patients, plasma LCAT activity is decreased coinciding with increased MPO levels. Higher MPO but not lower LCAT activity prospectively predicts adverse cardiac outcome.
A kindred affected with fish eye disease (FED) from Oklahoma is reported. Two probands with corneal opacification had mean levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (C), apolipoprotein (apo) A-I, and apoA-I in very large alpha-1 HDL particles that were 9%, 17%, and 5% of normal, whereas their parents and 1 sibling had values that were 61%, 77%, and 72% of normal. The probands had no detectable lipoprotein-X, and had mean low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and triglyceride levels that were elevated. Their mean lecithin cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) activities, cholesterol esterification rates, and free cholesterol levels were 8%, 42%, and 258% of normal, whereas their parents and 1 sibling had values that were 55%, 49%, and 114% of normal. The defect was due to 1 common variant in the LCAT gene in exon 1: c101t causing a proline34leucine substitution and a novel mutation c1177t causing a threonine37methionine substitution, with the former variant being found in the father and 1 sibling, and the latter mutation being found in the mother, and both mutations being present in the 2 probands. FED is distinguished from familial LCAT deficiency (FLD) by the lack of anemia, splenomegaly, and renal insufficiency as well as normal or increased LDL-C. Both FLD and FED cases have marked HDL deficiency and corneal opacification, and FED cases may have premature coronary heart disease in contrast to FLD cases. Therapy, using presently available agents, in FED should be to optimize LDL-C levels, and 1 proband responded well to statin therapy. The investigational use of human recombinant LCAT as an enzyme source is ongoing. 
Dietary phospholipid (PL) supplementation has been shown to reduce lipid accumulation in the tissues of farmed fish; however, the mechanisms underlying this effect are largely unknown. Thus, the present study was conducted to evaluate the potential impacts of PL on hepatic lipid metabolism both in vivo and in vitro. For in vivo study, four experimental diets - low lipid and low PL diet, as control diet (LL-LP diet, containing 12 % lipid and 1·5 % PL), low-lipid and high-PL diet (containing 12 % lipid and 8 % PL), high-lipid and low-PL diet (HL-LP diet, containing 20 % lipid and 1·5 % PL) and high-lipid and high-PL diet (HL-HP diet, containing 20 % lipid and 8 % PL) - were randomly allocated to four groups of large yellow croaker (Larimichthys crocea) (three cages per group) with similar initial body weight (approximately 8 g). For in vitro study, primary hepatocytes isolated from large yellow croaker were incubated either with graded levels of phosphatidylcholine (PC) (0-250 μm) or small interfering RNA (siRNA) for CTP: choline phosphate cytidylyltranferase α (CCTα) (siRNA-CCTα). Results showed that survival was independent of dietary treatments (P&gt;0·05). Weight gain and feed efficiency in the HL-HP group were significantly higher than in the LL-LP and HL-LP groups (P&lt;0·05). High level of dietary PL could markedly reduce abnormal hepatic lipid accumulation induced by the HL-LP diet (P&lt;0·05). Similarly, compared with the corresponding controls, a significant decrease/increase in lipid content was observed in primary hepatocytes incubated with PC/siRNA-CCTα (P&lt;0·05). High level of dietary PL reversed the HL-LP diet-induced increased levels of mRNA of fatty acid uptake and lipid synthesis related genes (P&lt;0·05). In addition, High level of dietary PL markedly down-regulated the transcript levels of fatty acid oxidation-related genes and enhanced the transcript levels of VLDL assembly-related genes regardless of dietary lipid levels (P&lt;0·05). Compared with corresponding controls, primary hepatocytes treated with PC showed significantly higher mRNA expression of lipid synthesis and VLDL assembly-related genes and lower mRNA expression of fatty acid oxidation-related genes, with hepatocytes treated with siRNA-CCTα exhibiting the opposite trend (P&lt;0·05). In summary, these results demonstrated that high level of dietary PL might reverse the HL-LP diet-induced abnormal lipid accumulation in the liver through inhibiting fatty acid uptake and lipid synthesis, together with promoting the lipid export at the transcriptional level. Lipid export-promoting effect of PC was confirmed by in vitro studies. The present study showed for the first time that PL or PC could influence various metabolic pathways to regulate hepatic lipid deposition in fish at least at the transcriptional level.
In search of genes that are steadily up-regulated during the promotion stage in carcinogenesis, suppression PCR subtractive hybridization and following northern blot screening were performed using a phenobarbital (PB)-promotion model based on a medium-term liver bioassay. Two weeks after a single injection of diethylnitrosamine (DEN; 200 mg/kg body wt, i.p.), rats were given 600 p.p.m. PB in the drinking water for up to 64 weeks. For comparison, animals fed 1 p.p.m. ethinylestradiol (EE) or 3000 p.p.m. butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) in the diet at promotion stage were also included. Rats were subjected to partial hepatectomy (PH) at week 3. In addition, dose-dependence of PB at week 8 of promotion and responsiveness to representative non-genotoxic carcinogens without DEN initiation were examined. Fragments of a total of 67 different genes were isolated from the up-regulated gene population in the liver at day 10 of PB treatment by subtracting from basal expression of DEN + PH alone. Using northern blot screening for signal-detectable 48 genes, 16 genes showed up-regulation in the livers at week 8 of promotion, common to the PB and EE treatments with the levels being three times or more than the basal expression of unpromoted liver. The majority of these genes were also up-regulated at week 8 by BHT treatment, and were also constitutively expressed in the DEN(-), PH(-) untreated rat livers. Among the up-regulated genes common to the PB and EE promotion, and not responding to the non-genotoxic carcinogens in uninitiated liver, the following six genes showed overexpression in PB-promoted hepatocellular carcinomas at week 64, with the levels three times or more than untreated rat liver: ubiquitously expressed mammalian ABC half transporter, apolipoprotein A4, nuclear receptor binding factor-2, CD81, hypothetical protein (HSPC014) and one unidentified gene. These genes might be candidates for biomarkers in screening of non-genotoxic hepatocarcinogens by analysis in two-stage carcinogenesis models.
Macrophage activation by bacterial LPS leads to induction of a complex inflammatory gene program dependent on numerous transcription factor families. The transcription factor Ikaros has been shown to play a critical role in lymphoid cell development and differentiation; however, its function in myeloid cells and innate immune responses is less appreciated. Using comprehensive genomic analysis of Ikaros-dependent transcription, DNA binding, and chromatin accessibility, we describe unexpected dual repressor and activator functions for Ikaros in the LPS response of murine macrophages. Consistent with the described function of Ikaros as transcriptional repressor, Ikzf1-/- macrophages showed enhanced induction for select responses. In contrast, we observed a dramatic defect in expression of many delayed LPS response genes, and chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing analyses support a key role for Ikaros in sustained NF-κB chromatin binding. Decreased Ikaros expression in Ikzf1+/- mice and human cells dampens these Ikaros-enhanced inflammatory responses, highlighting the importance of quantitative control of Ikaros protein level for its activator function. In the absence of Ikaros, a constitutively open chromatin state was coincident with dysregulation of LPS-induced chromatin remodeling, gene expression, and cytokine responses. Together, our data suggest a central role for Ikaros in coordinating the complex macrophage transcriptional program in response to pathogen challenge.
Ikaros/IKZF1 is an essential transcription factor expressed throughout hematopoiesis. IKZF1 is implicated in lymphocyte and myeloid differentiation and negative regulation of cell proliferation. In humans, somatic mutations in IKZF1 have been linked to the development of B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in children and adults. Recently, heterozygous germline IKZF1 mutations have been identified in patients with a B cell immune deficiency mimicking common variable immunodeficiency. These mutations demonstrated incomplete penetrance and led to haploinsufficiency. Herein, we report 7 unrelated patients with a novel early-onset combined immunodeficiency associated with de novo germline IKZF1 heterozygous mutations affecting amino acid N159 located in the DNA-binding domain of IKZF1. Different bacterial and viral infections were diagnosed, but Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia was reported in all patients. One patient developed a T cell ALL. This immunodeficiency was characterized by innate and adaptive immune defects, including low numbers of B cells, neutrophils, eosinophils, and myeloid dendritic cells, as well as T cell and monocyte dysfunctions. Notably, most T cells exhibited a naive phenotype and were unable to evolve into effector memory cells. Functional studies indicated these mutations act as dominant negative. This defect expands the clinical spectrum of human IKZF1-associated diseases from somatic to germline, from haploinsufficient to dominant negative.
The control of auto-reactive cells is defective in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Regulatory T (Treg) cells which play a key role in the modulation of immune responses have an impaired function in RA. Foxp3 is a master regulator of Treg cells which its expression is under the tight control of epigenetic mechanisms. In the current study, we analyzed the epigenetic modulation of the Foxp3 Treg-specific demethylated region (TSDR) and Helios gene expression to determine Treg cells alteration in RA patients.
We have recruited 20 newly diagnosed patients with RA and 41 healthy controls in our study. The measurement of Foxp3 and Helios gene expression was performed by the real-time PCR technique and the methylation level of TSDR was analyzed by bisulfite treatment and quantitative methylation-specific PCR (Q-MSP).
We found that RA patients had significantly lower level of Foxp3 gene expression and TSDR demethylation compared to healthy subjects (P &lt; 0.001 and P = 0.006, respectively). Inversely, the Helios gene expression was elevated significantly in RA patients group (P = 0.048). We also observed a significant correlation between Foxp3 and Helios gene expression (P = 0.016) as well as a significant correlation between FoxP3 expression and demethylation rate of TSDR (P = 0.010).
Our results suggested that both epigenetic modifications and Helios gene expression may have important roles in the pathogenesis of RA through their effects on Foxp3 gene expression.
T- and NK-cell lymphomas (TCL) are a heterogenous group of lymphoid malignancies with poor prognosis. In contrast to B-cell and myeloid malignancies, there are few preclinical models of TCLs, which has hampered the development of effective therapeutics. Here we establish and characterize preclinical models of TCL. We identify multiple vulnerabilities that are targetable with currently available agents (e.g., inhibitors of JAK2 or IKZF1) and demonstrate proof-of-principle for biomarker-driven therapies using patient-derived xenografts (PDXs). We show that MDM2 and MDMX are targetable vulnerabilities within TP53-wild-type TCLs. ALRN-6924, a stapled peptide that blocks interactions between p53 and both MDM2 and MDMX has potent in vitro activity and superior in vivo activity across 8 different PDX models compared to the standard-of-care agent romidepsin. ALRN-6924 induced a complete remission in a patient with TP53-wild-type angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma, demonstrating the potential for rapid translation of discoveries from subtype-specific preclinical models.
Thalidomide and its derivatives (lenalidomide, pomalidomide, avadomide, iberdomide hydrochoride, CC-885 and CC-90009) form the family of immunomodulatory drugs (IMiDs). Lenalidomide (CC5013, Revlimid®) was approved by the US FDA and the EMA for the treatment of multiple myeloma (MM) patients, low or intermediate-1 risk transfusion-dependent myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) with chromosome 5q deletion [del(5q)] and relapsed and/or refractory mantle cell lymphoma following bortezomib. Lenalidomide has also been studied in clinical trials and has shown promising activity in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). Lenalidomide has anti-inflammatory effects and inhibits angiogenesis. Pomalidomide (CC4047, Imnovid® [EU], Pomalyst® [USA]) was approved for advanced MM insensitive to bortezomib and lenalidomide. Other IMiDs are in phases 1 and 2 of clinical trials. Cereblon (CRBN) seems to have an important role in IMiDs action in both lymphoid and myeloid hematological malignancies. Cereblon acts as the substrate receptor of a cullin-4 really interesting new gene (RING) E3 ubiquitin ligase CRL4CRBN. This E3 ubiquitin ligase in the absence of lenalidomide ubiquitinates CRBN itself and the other components of CRL4CRBN complex. Presence of lenalidomide changes specificity of CRL4CRBN which ubiquitinates two transcription factors, IKZF1 (Ikaros) and IKZF3 (Aiolos), and casein kinase 1α (CK1α) and marks them for degradation in proteasomes. Both these transcription factors (IKZF1 and IKZF3) stimulate proliferation of MM cells and inhibit T cells. Low CRBN level was connected with insensitivity of MM cells to lenalidomide. Lenalidomide decreases expression of protein argonaute-2, which binds to cereblon. Argonaute-2 seems to be an important drug target against IMiDs resistance in MM cells. Lenalidomide decreases also basigin and monocarboxylate transporter 1 in MM cells. MM cells with low expression of Ikaros, Aiolos and basigin are more sensitive to lenalidomide treatment. The CK1α gene (CSNK1A1) is located on 5q32 in commonly deleted region (CDR) in del(5q) MDS. Inhibition of CK1α sensitizes del(5q) MDS cells to lenalidomide. CK1α mediates also survival of malignant plasma cells in MM. Though, inhibition of CK1α is a potential novel therapy not only in del(5q) MDS but also in MM. High level of full length CRBN mRNA in mononuclear cells of bone marrow and of peripheral blood seems to be necessary for successful therapy of del(5q) MDS with lenalidomide. While transfusion independence (TI) after lenalidomide treatment is more than 60% in MDS patients with del(5q), only 25% TI and substantially shorter duration of response with occurrence of neutropenia and thrombocytopenia were achieved in lower risk MDS patients with normal karyotype treated with lenalidomide. Shortage of the biomarkers for lenalidomide response in these MDS patients is the main problem up to now.
In this study, we performed genetic analysis of 83 B cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) cell lines. First, we performed multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification analysis to identify copy number abnormalities (CNAs) in eight genes associated with B-ALL according to genetic subtype. In Ph+ B-ALL cell lines, the frequencies of IKZF1, CDKN2A/2B, BTG1, and PAX5 deletion were significantly higher than those in Ph- B-ALL cell lines. The frequency of CDKN2A/2B deletion in KMT2A rearranged cell lines was significantly lower than that in non-KMT2A rearranged cell lines. These findings suggest that CNAs are correlated with genetic subtype in B-ALL cell lines. In addition, we determined that three B-other ALL cell lines had IKZF1 deletions (YCUB-5, KOPN49, and KOPN75); we therefore performed comprehensive genetic analysis of these cell lines. YCUB-5, KOPN49, and KOPN75 had P2RY8-CRLF2, IgH-CRLF2, and PAX5-ETV6 fusions, respectively. Moreover, targeted capture sequencing revealed that YCUB-5 had JAK2 R683I and KRAS G12D, and KOPN49 had JAK2 R683G and KRAS G13D mutations. These data may contribute to progress in the field of leukemia research.
IKZF1 plays an essential role in lymphopoiesis, and somatic IKZF1 variants in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) are associated with poor prognosis. In this issue of Cancer Cell, Churchman et al. add to the list of leukemia predisposition genes with the identification and characterization of germline IKZF1 variants in childhood ALL.
BACKGROUND Baicalein can suppress the growth of multiple tumors, including multiple myeloma (MM), but the exact mechanisms remains elusive. Here, we investigated the exact mechanisms of the anti-myeloma activity of baicalein. MATERIAL AND METHODS Proliferation and rates of apoptosis of myeloma U266 cells exposed to baicalein were detected. Microarray, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay, and Western blot analysis were applied to evaluate the mRNA and protein levels of associated molecules. Survival analysis of IKZF1 and IKZF3 was conducted as well. RESULTS Baicalein suppressed the growth and stimulated apoptosis of myeloma U266 cells in a dose- and time-dependent way. Baicalein increased mRNA level of CRBN, and further studies suggested that baicalein downregulated IKZF1 and IKZF3 on a post-transcriptional level. Although the differences did not reach statistical significance, IKZF1 and IKZF3 were associated with poor overall survival. CONCLUSIONS Our results suggest that baicalein suppresses the growth and promotes apoptosis of myeloma U266 cells through downregulating IKZF1 and IKZF3. Baicalein increased the expression of CRBN, which might exert a reversion effect on resistance of IMiDs. MM patients in IKZF1 and IKZF3 low-expression groups had better overall survival than those in IKZF1 and IKZF3 high-expression groups. Thus, the present results indicate that baicalein might be a therapeutic choice for targeting IKZF1 and IKZF3.
T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia is a hematopoietic malignant disease, which arises from a genetic defect in the T-cell maturation signaling pathway. As a result, it is necessary to identify the molecules that impact T-cell development and control lymphoid-lineage malignancy. The present study utilized Jurkat T lymphoblastic cells as a well-established approach for the investigation into the function of the non-canonical alternative splice variant of Helios for the in vitro study of T-cell differentiation and leukemogenesis. In the present study, the Jurkat T-cell lines with stable overexpression of the wild-type (Helios-1) or the non-canonical short isoform (Helios-Δ326-1431), were established. RNA microarray, reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction and flow cytometry were used to assess changes in the gene expression profiles and to monitor the cell surface markers during T-cell differentiation. Multiple genes associated with T-cell differentiation and leukemogenesis were identified as being either activated or suppressed. In addition, the results indicated that the stable overexpression of the Helios isoforms stimulated the differentiation pathway of the T-lineage lymphoblastic cells. Therefore, these results suggest that full-length Helios-1 has a tumor suppressor-like and immunomodulatory role, in contrast to the oncogenic function of the non-canonical short isoform Helios-Δ326-1431.
Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a complex heterogeneous neurodevelopmental disorder in which immunological imbalance has been suggested to be a major etiological component. Helios, a transcription factor, has been studied extensively in the context of human T cell regulation in health and disease, yet the role of Helios signaling has not been examined in children with ASD. In the present study, we investigated the production of Helios in CD4+, CD8+, and TIM-3+, CXCR3+ cells in typically developing (TD) controls and children with ASD and in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). We assayed the production of IFN-γ+Helios+, IL-21+Helios+, T-bet+Helios+, and Foxp3+Helios+ cells, and determined Helios mRNA and protein expression levels in PBMCs, in TD controls and children with ASD. Our results revealed that children with ASD had lower numbers of CD4+Helios+ CD8+Helios+, TIM-3+Helios+, and CXCR3+Helios+ cells as compared to TD controls. Our results also showed that children with ASD had decreased IFN-γ+Helios+, IL-21+Helios+, T-bet+Helios+, and Helios+Foxp3+ production compared to that in TD controls. Moreover, our results indicated that children with ASD had lower Helios mRNA and protein expression levels compared to those in TD controls. These results suggest that the Helios transcription factor may be critical to immune alterations in children with ASD. Therefore, our results suggest that targeting Helios signaling might offer a strategy for developing ASD therapies.
Somatic genetic alterations of IKZF1, which encodes the lymphoid transcription factor IKAROS, are common in high-risk B-progenitor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and are associated with poor prognosis. Such alterations result in the acquisition of stem cell-like features, overexpression of adhesion molecules causing aberrant cell-cell and cell-stroma interaction, and decreased sensitivity to tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Here we report coding germline IKZF1 variation in familial childhood ALL and 0.9% of presumed sporadic B-ALL, identifying 28 unique variants in 45 children. The majority of variants adversely affected IKZF1 function and drug responsiveness of leukemic cells. These results identify IKZF1 as a leukemia predisposition gene, and emphasize the importance of germline genetic variation in the development of both familial and sporadic ALL.
The transcription factor (TF) interferon regulatory factor-4 (IRF4) promotes both germinal center (GC) reactions and plasma cell (PC) differentiation by binding to alternative DNA motifs including AP-1-IRF composite elements, Ets-IRF composite elements (EICEs), and interferon sequence response elements (ISREs). Although all of these motifs mediate transcriptional activation by IRF4, it is still unknown how some of the IRF4 target genes are downregulated upon PC differentiation. Here, we revealed a molecular mechanism of IRF4-mediated gene downregulation during PC differentiation. By combining IRF4 chromatin immunoprecipitation sequence and gene expression analysis, we identified zinc finger-IRF composite elements (ZICEs) in IRF4 binding regions aligned with genes whose expression was downregulated in PCs. The zinc finger TFs Ikaros and Aiolos were identified as IRF4 binding partners in PCs, and Ikaros but not Aiolos was essential for IRF4 binding to the ZICE sequence and for PC differentiation. The Ebf1 gene, which positively controls B-cell activation and GC reactions, was identified as one of the Ikaros/IRF4 target genes. Importantly, while the ZICE embeds the ISRE motif, IRF4 bound the ZICE motif as heterodimers with Ikaros for repression of target genes, which include Ebf1 In contrast, if the zinc finger motif is juxtaposed to the EICE motif, the Ikaros/PU.1/IRF4 complex functioned to activate target gene expression. Our findings revealed a novel mode of IRF4 activity upon PC differentiation where upon forming an Ikaros/IRF4 DNA-bound complex, a subset of genes is repressed.
Ikaros family zinc finger 1 (IKZF1) is a haematopoietic transcription factor required for mammalian B-cell development. IKZF1 deficiency also reduces plasmacytoid dendritic cell (pDC) numbers in mice, but its effects on human DC development are unknown. Here we show that heterozygous mutation of IKZF1 in human decreases pDC numbers and expands conventional DC1 (cDC1). Lenalidomide, a drug that induces proteosomal degradation of IKZF1, also decreases pDC numbers in vivo, and reduces the ratio of pDC/cDC1 differentiated from progenitor cells in vitro in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, non-classical monocytes are reduced by IKZF1 deficiency in vivo. DC and monocytes from patients with IKZF1 deficiency or lenalidomide-treated cultures secrete less IFN-α, TNF and IL-12. These results indicate that human DC development and function are regulated by IKZF1, providing further insights into the consequences of IKZF1 mutation on immune function and the mechanism of immunomodulation by lenalidomide.
Recent clinical outcomes of pediatric Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph+ALL) vastly improved owing to tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI). However, the genetic status would be different in each case with ABL1 gene mutation or copy number variants (CNVs) such as IKZF1 deletion. In particular, the TKI resistant clone with ABL1 kinase mutation remains problematic. The comprehensive assessment of genetic status including mutation, insertion and deletion (indel) and CNVs is necessary.
We evaluated a next-generation sequencing (NGS)-based customized HaloPlex target enrichment system panel to simultaneously detect coding mutations, indel and CNVs. We analysed approximately 160 known genes associated with hematological disorders in 5 pediatric Ph+ALL patients.
Mono-allelic IKZF1 deletions were found in 4 patients at diagnosis. Furthermore, the mono-allelic deletions were found in exons of RB1, EBF1, PAX5 and ETV6 genes. Bi-allelic deletions were detected in CDKN2A and CDKN2B genes in 1 patient. ABL1 mutation was also detected in 1 patient at relapse. These results were almost comparable with the results of the multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) method or Sanger sequence.
Next-generation sequencing-based custom HaloPlex target enrichment system panel allows us to detect the coding mutations, indel, and CNVs in pediatric Ph+ALL simultaneously, and its results seem comparable with those of other methods.
The multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) method was used to detect the copy number alterations (CNAs) of IKAROS family zinc finger 1 (IKZF1), paired box 5 (PAX5), ETS variant 6 (ETV6), RB transcriptional corepressor 1 (RB1), BTG anti-proliferation factor 1 (BTG1), early B-cell factor 1 (EBF1), cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor 2A/2B (CDKN2A/2B) and cytokine receptor like factor 2 (CRLF2) genes in 87 adults with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in China. The effects of CNAs on prognosis were analyzed. Gene deletions were detected in 58/87 (66.7%) ALL patients. The most common deletions were observed in the following genes: IKZF1 (40.6%), CDKN2A (31.9%), CDKN2B (29%), PAX5 (21.7%), RB1 (14.5%) and BTG1 (10.1%). B cell-ALL (B-ALL) patients with CDKN2A/2B deletions exhibited poor 2-year overall survival (OS; P=0.055) and relapse-free survival (RFS; P=0.054) rates. CDKN2A/2B deletions were associated with poor 2-year OS (P=0.045) and RFS (P=0.071) rates in Philadelphia chromosome positive (Ph+) B-ALL patients, as well as in the high risk (HR) B-ALL group (P=0.037 and P=0.047, respectively). Patients with PAX5 deletions displayed poor 2-year OS (P=0.004) and RFS (P=0.016) rates in Philadelphia chromosome negative (Ph-) B-ALL patients. Patients with ≥3 gene deletions exhibited a poorer prognosis than other patients (OS, P=0.001; RFS, 0.002).
B cell activation during normal immune responses and oncogenic transformation impose increased metabolic demands on B cells and their ability to retain redox homeostasis. While the serine/threonine-protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) was identified as a tumor suppressor in multiple types of cancer, our genetic studies revealed an essential role of PP2A in B cell tumors. Thereby, PP2A redirects glucose carbon utilization from glycolysis to the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) to salvage oxidative stress. This unique vulnerability reflects constitutively low PPP activity in B cells and transcriptional repression of G6PD and other key PPP enzymes by the B cell transcription factors PAX5 and IKZF1. Reflecting B-cell-specific transcriptional PPP-repression, glucose carbon utilization in B cells is heavily skewed in favor of glycolysis resulting in lack of PPP-dependent antioxidant protection. These findings reveal a gatekeeper function of the PPP in a broad range of B cell malignancies that can be efficiently targeted by small molecule inhibition of PP2A and G6PD.
Protein analysis in bone marrow samples from patients with multiple myeloma has been limited by the low concentration of proteins obtained after CD138+ cell selection. A novel approach based on capillary nano-immunoassay could make it possible to quantify dozens of proteins from each myeloma sample in an automated manner. Here we present a method for the accurate and robust quantification of the expression of multiple proteins extracted from CD138-purified multiple myeloma samples frozen in RLT Plus buffer, which is commonly used for nucleic acid preservation and isolation. Additionally, the biological and clinical value of this analysis for a panel of 12 proteins essential to the pathogenesis of multiple myeloma was evaluated in 63 patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma. The analysis of the prognostic impact of CRBN/Cereblon and IKZF1/Ikaros mRNA/protein showed that only the protein levels were able to predict progression-free survival of patients; mRNA levels were not associated with prognosis. Interestingly, high levels of Cereblon and Ikaros proteins were associated with longer progression-free survival only in patients who received immunomodulatory drugs and not in those treated with other drugs. In conclusion, the capillary nano-immunoassay platform provides a novel opportunity for automated quantification of the expression of more than 20 proteins in CD138+ primary multiple myeloma samples.
Transcription factor IKZF1 (IKAROS) acts as a critical regulator of lymphoid differentiation and is frequently deleted or mutated in B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia. IKZF1 gene defects are associated with inferior treatment outcome in both childhood and adult B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia and occur in more than 70% of BCR-ABL1-positive and BCR-ABL1-like cases of acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Over the past few years, much has been learned about the tumor suppressive function of IKZF1 during leukemia development and the molecular pathways that relate to its impact on treatment outcome. In this review, we provide a concise overview on the role of IKZF1 during normal lymphopoiesis and the pathways that contribute to leukemia pathogenesis as a consequence of altered IKZF1 function. Furthermore, we discuss different mechanisms by which IKZF1 alterations impose therapy resistance on leukemic cells, including enhanced cell adhesion and modulation of glucocorticoid response.
The IKZF3 gene encodes a zinc-finger protein that plays an important role in the proliferation and differentiation of B lymphocytes. Autoimmune thyroid diseases (AITDs), mainly include Graves' disease (GD) and Hashimoto's thyroiditis (HT), are probably caused by the aberrant proliferation of B cells. The objective of this study was to explore the association between IKZF3 polymorphisms and AITDs.
We examined 915 AITD patients (604 GD and 311 HT) and 814 healthy controls. IKZF3 variants (rs2941522, rs907091, rs1453559, rs12150079 and rs2872507) were tested by PCR-ligase detection reaction.
It was manifested that that the minor alleles of the five loci increased susceptibility to GD (p&lt;0.05 for rs2941522, and p&lt;0.01 for rs907091, rs1453559, rs12150079 and rs2872507) but in HT patients, these loci showed no significant difference compared with controls. Similarly, the genotype distributions of GD patients manifested obvious differences in all these loci compared with the control group, whereas no statistical differences were observed between HT patients and controls. Furthermore, bioinformatics tools were used to analyze rs1453559, rs12150079 and rs907091. These variants were believed to be the transcription regulator.
It is the first time we reported the association between the IKZF3 polymorphisms and GD, indicating that IKZF3 gene tends to bean important risk factor for the development of GD.
Recurrent chromosomal rearrangements carry prognostic significance in pediatric B-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL). Recent genome-wide analyses identified a high-risk B-ALL subtype characterized by a diverse spectrum of genetic alterations activating kinases and cytokine receptor genes. This subtype is associated with a poor prognosis when treated with conventional chemotherapy but has demonstrated sensitivity to the relevant tyrosine kinase inhibitors. We sought to determine the frequency of kinase-activating fusions among National Cancer Institute (NCI) high-risk, Ph-negative, B-ALL patients enrolled on Dana-Farber Cancer Institute ALL Consortium Protocol 05-001 and to describe their associated clinical characteristics and outcomes. Among the 105 patients screened, 16 (15%) harbored an ABL-class fusion (ETV6-ABL1: n = 1; FOXP1-ABL1: n = 1; SFPQ-ABL1: n = 1; ZC3HAV1-ABL2: n = 1) or a fusion activating the JAK-STAT pathway (P2RY8-CRLF2: n = 8; PAX5-JAK2: n = 4). Sixty-nine percent of patients with an identified fusion had a concomitant IKZF1 deletion (n = 11). In univariate analysis, fusion-positivity and IKZF1 deletion were each associated with inferior event-free survival; IKZF1 deletion retained statistical significance in multivariable analysis (hazard ratio, 2.64; P = .019). Our findings support therapy intensification for IKZF1-altered patients, irrespective of the presence of a kinase-activating fusion.
We have previously shown that immunomodulatory drug (IMiD) compounds induce a shift into immature myeloid precursors with a maturational arrest and subsequent neutropenia. The mechanism of action is unknown. Here we found that IMiD compounds cause selective ubiquitination and degradation of the transcription factor IKZF1 in CD34+ cells by the Cereblon (CRBN) E3 ubiquitin ligase. Loss of IKZF1 is associated with a decrease of the IKZF1-dependent transcription factor PU.1, critical for the development and maturation of neutrophils. Using a thalidomide analog bead pull-down assay, we showed that IMiD compounds directly bind CRBN in CD34+ cells. Knockdown of CRBN in CD34+ cells resulted in resistance to POM-induced IKZF1 downregulation and reversed the POM-induced lineage shift in colony-formation assays, suggesting that the POM-induced degradation of IKZF1 in CD34+ cells requires CRBN. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays revealed that IKZF1 binds to the promoter region of PU.1, suggesting that PU.1 is a direct downstream target of IKZF1 in CD34+ cells. POM failed to induce IKZF1 degradation in IKZF1-Q146H-OE CD34+ cells, indicating that CRBN binding to IKZF1 and subsequent IKZF1 ubiquitination is critical in this process. Using the NOD/SCID/γ-c KO mouse model, we confirmed the induction of myeloid progenitor cells by IMiD compounds at the expense of common lymphoid progenitors. These results demonstrate a novel mechanism of action of IMiD compounds in hematopoietic progenitor cells, leading to selective degradation of transcription factors critical for myeloid maturation, and explain the occurrence of neutropenia associated with treatment by IMiD compounds.
Regulatory T cells (Tregs) characterized by the transcription factor forkhead box P3 (FoxP3) are crucial for maintaining immune tolerance and preventing autoimmunity. However, FoxP3 does not function alone and Helios is considered a potential candidate for defining Treg subsets. In this study, we investigated the expression and function of Helios for identifying Tregs in childhood precursor B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (pre-B ALL). Our results demonstrated that patients with pre-B ALL had a higher percentage of Helios+ FoxP3+ CD4+ Tregs. And there was a positive correlation between the expression of Helios and the suppressive function of Tregs, the risk gradation of ALL. Helios in combination with CD4 and FoxP3 may be an effective way to detect functional Tregs in pre-B ALL by promoting the secretion of transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1. Furthermore, Helios+ Tregs could regulate angiogenesis in the BM niche of pre-B ALL via the VEGFA/VEGFR2 pathway. We also found Helios+ Tregs decreased apoptosis rate of nalm-6 cells by up-regulating the expression of anti-apoptosis protein Bcl-2. In summary, these data strongly imply the physiological importance of Helios expression in Tregs, and suggest that the manipulation of Helios may serve as a novel strategy for cancer immunotherapy.
E14a3 breakpoint cluster region (BCR)/ABL proto-oncogene 1, non-receptor tyrosine kinase (ABL) fusion transcript is rare in Philadelphia chromosome positive disease, particularly in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Recently an e14a3 fusion transcript was detected by multiple laboratory examinations, and the patient was suffering from ALL. Except for the BCR/ABL fusion gene, in the present study the patient additionally had an IKAROS family zinc finger 1 deletion which, has been confirmed as a significant adverse prognosis factor. Following 2 rounds of chemotherapy, the patient presented cytological remission; however, the patient then relapsed 2 months later. They then received chimeric antigen receptor modified (CAR-modified) T-cell therapy and achieved complete remission. CAR-modified T-cell therapy is a powerful novel therapy which, exhibited great potential for treating refractory ALL, regardless of the existence and form of the BCR/ABL fusion transcript.
Human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1) elite controllers (ELCs) represent a unique population that control viral replication in the absence of antiretroviral therapy (cART). It is well established that expression of multiple inhibitory receptors on CD8+ T cells is associated with HIV-1 disease progression. However, whether reduced co-expression of inhibitory receptors on CD4+ T cells is linked to natural viral control and slow HIV-1 disease progression remains undefined. Here, we report on the expression pattern of numerous measurable inhibitory receptors, associated with T cell exhaustion (programmed cell death-1, CTLA-4, and TIGIT), on different CD4+ T cell memory populations in ELCs and HIV-infected subjects with or without long-term cART. We found that the co-expression pattern of inhibitory receptors was significantly reduced in ELCs compared with HIV-1 cART-treated and viremic subjects, and similar to healthy controls. Markers associated with T cell exhaustion varied among different memory CD4+ T cell subsets and highest levels were found mainly on transitional memory T cells. CD4+ T cells co-expressing all inhibitory markers were positively correlated to T cell activation (CD38+ HLA-DR+) as well as the transcription factors Helios and FoxP3. Finally, clinical parameters such as CD4 count, HIV-1 viral load, and the CD4/CD8 ratio all showed significant associations with CD4+ T cell exhaustion. We demonstrate that ELCs are able to maintain lower levels of CD4+ T cell exhaustion despite years of ongoing viral replication compared with successfully cART-treated subjects. Our findings suggest that ELCs harbor a "healthy" state of inhibitory receptor expression on CD4+ T cells that might play part in maintenance of their control status.
Human embryonic stem cell-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hE-MSCs) have greater proliferative capacity than other human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs), suggesting that they may have wider applications in regenerative cellular therapy. In this study, to uncover the anti-senescence mechanism in hE-MSCs, we compared hE-MSCs with adult bone marrow (hBM-MSCs) and found that hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) was more abundantly expressed in hE-MSCs than in hBM-MSCs and that it induced the transcription of RAD51 and facilitated its SUMOylation at K70. RAD51 induction/modification by HGF not only increased telomere length but also increased mtDNA replication, leading to increased ATP generation. Moreover, HGF-treated hBM-MSCs showed significantly better therapeutic efficacy than naive hBM-MSCs. Together, the data suggest that the RAD51-mediated effects of HGF prevent hMSC senescence by promoting telomere lengthening and inducing mtDNA replication and function, which opens the prospect of developing novel therapies for liver disease.
Multiple myeloma (MM) cells acquire dormancy and drug resistance via interaction with bone marrow stroma cells (BMSC) in a hypoxic microenvironment. Elucidating the mechanisms underlying the regrowth of dormant clones may contribute to further improvement of the prognosis of MM patients. In this study, we find that the CD180/MD-1 complex, a noncanonical lipopolysaccharide (LPS) receptor, is expressed on MM cells but not on normal counterparts, and its abundance is markedly upregulated under adherent and hypoxic conditions. Bacterial LPS and anti-CD180 antibody, but not other Toll-like receptor ligands, enhanced the growth of MM cells via activation of MAP kinases ERK and JNK in positive correlation with expression levels of CD180. Administration of LPS significantly increased the number of CD180/CD138 double-positive cells in a murine xenograft model when MM cells were inoculated with direct attachment to BMSC. Knockdown of CD180 canceled the LPS response in vitro and in vivo Promoter analyses identified IKZF1 (Ikaros) as a pivotal transcriptional activator of the CD180 gene. Both cell adhesion and hypoxia activated transcription of the CD180 gene by increasing Ikaros expression and its binding to the promoter region. Pharmacological targeting of Ikaros by the immunomodulatory drug lenalidomide ameliorated the response of MM cells to LPS in a CD180-dependent manner in vitro and in vivo Thus, the CD180/MD-1 pathway may represent a novel mechanism of growth regulation of MM cells in a BM milieu and may be a therapeutic target of preventing the regrowth of dormant MM cells.Significance: This study describes a novel mechanism by which myeloma cells are regulated in the bone marrow, where drug resistance and dormancy can evolve after treatment, with potential therapeutic implications for treating this often untreatable blood cancer.

Although B cells reactive with islet autoantigens are silenced by tolerance mechanisms in healthy individuals, they can become activated and contribute to the development of type 1 diabetes. We previously demonstrated that high-affinity insulin-binding B cells (IBCs) occur exclusively in the anergic (BND) compartment in peripheral blood of healthy subjects. Consistent with their activation early in disease development, high-affinity IBCs are absent from the BND compartment of some first-degree relatives (FDRs) as well as all patients with autoantibody-positive prediabetes and new-onset type 1 diabetes, a time when they are found in pancreatic islets. Loss of BND IBCs is associated with a loss of the entire BND B-cell compartment consistent with provocation by an environmental trigger or predisposing genetic factors. To investigate potential mechanisms operative in subversion of B-cell tolerance, we explored associations between HLA and non-HLA type 1 diabetes-associated risk allele genotypes and loss of BNDs in FDRs. We found that high-risk HLA alleles and a subset of non-HLA risk alleles (i.e., PTPN2 [rs1893217], INS [rs689], and IKZF3 [rs2872507]), relevant to B- and T-cell development and function are associated with loss of anergy. Hence, the results suggest a role for risk-conferring alleles in perturbation of B-cell anergy during development of type 1 diabetes.
Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) performed mostly in populations of European and Hispanic ancestry have confirmed an inherited genetic basis for childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), but these associations are less clear in other races/ethnicities. DNA samples from ALL patients (aged 0-19 years) previously enrolled onto a Tokyo Children's Cancer Study Group trial were collected during 2013-2015, and underwent single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) microarray genotyping resulting in 527 B-cell ALL for analysis. Cases and control data for 3,882 samples from the Nagahama Study Group and Aichi Cancer Center Study were combined, and association analyses across 10 previous GWAS-identified regions were performed after targeted SNP imputation. Linkage disequilibrium (LD) patterns in Japanese and other populations were evaluated using the varLD score based on 1000 Genomes data. Risk associations for ARID5B (rs10821936, OR = 1.84, P = 6 × 10-17) and PIP4K2A (rs7088318, OR = 0.76, P = 2 × 10-4) directly transferred to Japanese, and the IKZF1 association was detected by an alternate SNP (rs1451367, OR = 1.52, P = 2 × 10-6). Marked regional LD differences between Japanese and Europeans was observed for most of the remaining loci for which associations did not transfer, including CEBPE, CDKN2A, CDKN2B, and ELK3. This study represents a first step towards characterizing the role of genetic susceptibility in childhood ALL risk in Japanese.
New therapies for Philadelphia chromosome-like acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph-like ALL) patients are urgently needed. The genetic landscape of Ph-like ALL is characterized by a diverse array of kinase-activating alterations (including rearrangements, sequence mutations, and copy number alterations), suggesting that patients with Ph-like ALL are candidates for targeted therapy, similar to BCR-ABL1 ALL. We sought to investigate the functional role and targetability of the spectrum of kinase-activating alterations identified in Ph-like ALL. We demonstrate cytokine-independent growth and activation of JAK-STAT signaling pathways in Ba/F3 cells by all alterations tested. The development of murine Arf-/- pre-B ALL expressing RCSD1-ABL2 or SSBP2-CSF1R was accelerated with the presence of IK6, a dominant negative isoform of Ikaros common in Ph-like ALL, providing evidence that these fusions are leukemogenic. In vitro screening using a panel of tyrosine kinase inhibitors against 14 different kinase alterations identified the ABL1-inhibitor, dasatinib, as a potent inhibitor of ABL-class fusions (ABL1, ABL2, CSF1R, PDGFRB), whereas the JAK1/JAK2 inhibitor ruxolitinib, was most effective against JAK-STAT-activating alterations (JAK1, JAK2, JAK3, IL7R, IL2RB), but not TYK2. Evaluation of dasatinib or ruxolitinib against patient-derived xenograft models demonstrated superior antileukemic efficacy when combined with dexamethasone compared with either agent alone. These data provide the foundation for rationally designed clinical trials that assess the efficacy of targeted therapy in patients with Ph-like ALL.
Since two genome-wide association studies identified the same susceptible region at ARID5B and IKZF1 for acute leukemia in Caucasians in the same time, several research groups have confirmed the similar results in different ethnicities and of different acute leukemia subtypes (ALL and AML). However, the causal variants of these two genes were not identified. In this study, we systematically screened 6 potentially functional SNPs in ARID5B and IKZF1 genes, and conducted a case-control study including 660 AML cases and 1034 cancer-free controls to investigate the associations between these SNPs and AML risk. We found that the variant alleles of rs4509706 and rs11761922 could significantly increase the risk of AML (rs4509706: OR=1.35, 95%CI=1.12-1.62 in additive model; rs11761922: OR=1.29, 95%CI=1.02-1.62 in recessive model). Luciferase reporter assay showed that both rs11761922-G and rs4509706-C significantly increased the luciferase levels as compared with rs11761922-C and rs4509706-T in K562 cells (P&lt;0.05 for rs11761922 and P&lt;0.001 for rs4509706). Our results indicated that rs4509706 and rs11761922 may play important roles in AML development in Chinese population.
It is now clear that previously polarized T cells possess the ability to change their phenotype and repolarize towards different fates. This intrinsic flexibility is commonly referred to as plasticity and is influenced by the cytokine milieu, microbial products and products of metabolism which, in turn, regulate transcription factors and epigenetic machinery in the intestinal lamina propria. The intestinal immune system faces a particularly difficult challenge. It serves to protect the largest mucosal surface against infection and injury while maintaining a state of tolerance towards dietary antigens and the largest population of commensal organisms in the body. This requires a delicate balance between regulatory and effector T cells; loss of this balance is thought to lead to the development of Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), collectively referred to as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). These unique immune-mediated inflammatory diseases are directed not at self-antigens but rather at the commensal microorganisms which reside within the gut lumen. However, it is thought that owing to persistence of these microbial antigens, intestinal damage and systemic inflammation ensue. New data from mouse models of IBD suggest that T cell plasticity, particularly along the Th1-Th17 and Th17-Treg axes, plays an important role in the regulation of intestinal immune responses. Furthermore, patients with IBD demonstrate increased numbers of "transdifferentiated" T cell populations suggestive of heightened plasticity. This review will consider the mechanisms and roles of Th17 plasticity in the pathogenesis of IBD.
Sequential stages of B-cell development is stringently coordinated by transcription factors (TFs) network that include B-lineage commitment TFs (Ikaros, Runx1/Cbfb, E2A, and FOXO1), B-lineage maintenance TFs (EBF1 and PAX5) and stage specific set of TFs (IRF4, IRF8, BCL6, BLIMP1). Deregulation of TFs expression and activity is often occurs in malignant B cells. The aim of this study was to evaluate TFs expression in chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells taking into consideration CD150 cell surface expression. From other side we attempted to regulate TFs expression via CD150 and CD180 cell surface receptors.
Studies were performed on normal peripheral blood B-cell subpopulations and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells isolated from peripheral blood of 67 primary untreated patients with CLL. Evaluation of TFs expression was performed on mRNA level using qRT-PCR and on protein level by western blot analysis.
Median of PAX5 and EBF1 mRNA expression was higher in cell surface CD150 positive (csCD150+) compared to csCD150- CLL cases or normal CD19+ and CD19+CD5+ B-cell subsets. Differences in mRNA expression of IRF8, IRF4 and BLIMP1 between studied groups of CLL and normal B cells were not revealed. All CLL cases were characterized by downregulated expression of PU.1 and BCL6 mRNAs in comparison to normal B cells. At the same time elevated SPIB mRNA expression level was restricted to CLL cells. Protein expression of IRF4, IRF8 and BCL6 was uniformly distributed between csCD150- and csCD150+ CLL cases. PU.1 protein and CD20 that is direct PU.1 target gene positively correlated with CD150 cell surface expression on CLL cells. Ligation of CD150 and CD180 alone or in combination upregulated IRF8 and PU.1 while downregulated the IRF4 mRNA expression. Signaling via CD150 or CD180 alone elevated the level of BCL6 mRNA. Strong downregulation of IRF4 mRNA was observed after CD150, CD180 or CD150 andCD180 coligation on CLL cells. We found that in CLL cells CD150 is a negative regulator of SPIB while CD180 is involved in upregulation of EBF1 expression level. Moreover, CD180 ligation on CLL cells caused increase of CD150 mRNA level that is a one of the EBF1 target genes.
Analysis of TFs expression profile revealed upregulated SPIB mRNA level and downregulated PU.1 in CLL cells. CD150 and CD180 receptors may modulate transcriptional program in CLL cells by regulating the TFs expression levels.
The IKZF family of transcription factors are essential regulators of lymphopoiesis. Ikaros, Helios, Aiolos and Eos function as transcriptional repressors and activators during T and B cell differentiation and in mature cell function, depending on the stage of development and/or cell type. Their potential mechanisms of action are varied. Ikaros family proteins partner with multiple complexes, including NuRD, PRC2 and transcription elongation factors, to modulate gene expression and the chromatin state. In humans, mutations in the IKZF genes are associated with B cell deficiency, leukemias and autoimmunity. In this review, we focus on the function of Ikaros family proteins in early T and B lymphocyte development, and discuss the molecular and physiological activities of this family.
Regulatory T cells (Tregs) play an essential role in acute coronary syndrome (ACS). However, there is debate about which Treg subsets are truly critical to ACS. Helios, a transcription factor, was recently reported to be a bona fide marker for natural Tregs or activated Tregs with a suppression function, but little is known about its role in ACS. We therefore examined Helios+ Tregs in patients with ACS, patients with stable angina, and control subjects. 73 patients with ACS, 30 patients with stable angina, and 48 control subjects were enrolled. The frequencies and estimated absolute numbers of different Treg subsets in peripheral blood were measured by flow cytometry. Plasma cytokine level was measured by ELISA. The mRNA expression of Foxp3 and Helios in purified CD4+ T cells was determined by RT-PCR. Helios+ Tregs was decreased significantly in patients with ACS. The frequency and estimated absolute numbers of CD4+Foxp3+Helios+ Tregs were negatively correlated with IL-6 and positively correlated with circulating level of TGF-beta1 and HDL-C. The mRNA expression of Foxp3 and Helios was decreased in CD4+ T cells from patients with ACS. In summary, Helios+ Tregs was downregulated in patients with ACS and may play a role in ACS.
The acute phase of HIV infection is characterized by massive depletion of CD4 T cells, high viral plasma levels and pronounced systemic immune activation. Regulatory T cells (Tregs) have the potential to control systemic immune activation but also to suppress antigen specific T and B cell response. The co-expression of FoxP3 and Helios transcription factors, has been described for identification of highly suppressive Tregs. The aim of this study was to characterize the phenotype of classic Tregs during early HIV infection, and to assess the correlations between the frequencies and phenotype of Tregs with the plasma viral load, CD4 counts, immune activation and the frequency of antibodies reactive to HIV-1 proteins, measured by an immunochromatographic test.
The relative frequency of classic Tregs cells in peripheral blood correlated positively with HIV viral load and immune activation of CD8 T cells, and inversely with absolute CD4 counts and development of anti-HIV antibodies in subjects with early HIV infection. However, the expression of Helios in classic Tregs was inversely correlated with viral replication and immune activation, and positively with recovery of CD4 T cell counts and appearance of antibodies reactive to HIV-1 proteins.
These results raise the hypothesis that classic Tregs are inefficient at controlling systemic immune activation in subjects with early HIV infection and may be associated with delayed production of antibodies against HIV proteins, delaying the control of viral replication. Conversely, Helios expressing Tregs might contribute to control of viral replication by mechanisms involving the limitation of systemic immune activation.
We retrospectively analyzed the samples collected from 66 patients with Ph+ALL enrolled on ChiCTR-TNRC-09000309 clinical trial. CR rate was 95.5%, and estimated 2-year OS and DFS were 51.7 ± 11.7% and 26.9 ± 11.6%, 3-year OS and DFS were 31.6 ± 12.0% and 23.4 ± 11.6%. By combining IKZF1 deletion and early molecular responses, we redefined the patients as low, intermediate, and high risk 3 groups separately. Patients with double negative in IKZF1 and early molecular response experienced significant superior survival, while patients with double positive would have the worst outcome, and patients who were one or the other with IKZF1 deletion or MRD status had intermediate outcome. Significant differences were found among 3 groups in regard to both OS (p &lt; .001) and DFS (p &lt; .001). Our findings suggest that Ph+ALL is a heterogeneous group of diseases with significantly different prognosis. Combination of IKZF1 deletion and MRD status enable better risk stratification of patients for assignment to optimal therapeutic strategies.
Latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1) is a major oncogene encoded by Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and is essential for immortalization of B cells by the virus. Previous studies suggested that several transcription factors, such as PU.1, RBP-Jκ, NFκB, EBF1, AP-2 and STAT, are involved in LMP1 induction; however, the means by which the oncogene is negatively regulated remains unclear. Here, we introduced short mutations into the proximal LMP1 promoter that includes recognition sites for the E-box and Ikaros transcription factors in the context of EBV-bacterial artificial chromosome. Upon infection, the mutant exhibited increased LMP1 expression and EBV-mediated immortalization of B cells. However, single mutations of either the E-box or Ikaros sites had limited effects on LMP1 expression and transformation. Our results suggest that this region contains a suppressive cis-regulatory element, but other transcriptional repressors (apart from the E-box and Ikaros transcription factors) may remain to be discovered.
V(D)J recombination is essential for the generation of diverse antigen receptor (AgR) repertoires. In B cells, immunoglobulin kappa (Igκ) light chain recombination follows immunoglobulin heavy chain (Igh) recombination. We recently developed the DNA-based VDJ-seq assay for the unbiased quantitation of Igh VH and DH repertoires. Integration of VDJ-seq data with genome-wide datasets revealed that two chromatin states at the recombination signal sequence (RSS) of VH genes are highly predictive of recombination in mouse pro-B cells. It is unknown whether local chromatin states contribute to Vκ gene choice during Igκ recombination. Here we adapt VDJ-seq to profile the Igκ VκJκ repertoire and present a comprehensive readout in mouse pre-B cells, revealing highly variable Vκ gene usage. Integration with genome-wide datasets for histone modifications, DNase hypersensitivity, transcription factor binding and germline transcription identified PU.1 binding at the RSS, which was unimportant for Igh, as highly predictive of whether a Vκ gene will recombine or not, suggesting that it plays a binary, all-or-nothing role, priming genes for recombination. Thereafter, the frequency with which these genes recombine was shaped both by the presence and level of enrichment of several other chromatin features, including H3K4 methylation and IKAROS binding. Moreover, in contrast to the Igh locus, the chromatin landscape of the promoter, as well as of the RSS, contributes to Vκ gene recombination. Thus, multiple facets of local chromatin features explain much of the variation in Vκ gene usage. Together, these findings reveal shared and divergent roles for epigenetic features and transcription factors in AgR V(D)J recombination and provide avenues for further investigation of chromatin signatures that may underpin V(D)J-mediated chromosomal translocations.
Resveratrol generated enormous interest as it improved functions of multiple organs and could delay aging in animal models. However, basic mechanism of action was not understood and due to poor bioavailability, it has failed to enter the market. A highly active nano-formulation of resveratrol (XAR™) with enhanced bioavailability is now available. Present study was undertaken to evaluate its effects on stem cells biology in the human peripheral blood. Twelve healthy participants were enrolled of which five received XAR™, five were age-matched placebo controls and two were 76 and 85 years old. Peripheral blood was processed to study serum profile to monitor cardiac and pancreatic functions and subjected to density gradient centrifugation to enrich pluripotent (VSELs) and adult stem cells that get enriched along with red blood cells and in the Buffy coat respectively on Day 2 and Day 15 after XAR™ treatment. The XAR™ treatment resulted in an increased expression of pluripotency transcripts specific for VSELs (Oct-4A, Nanog and Sox2) on D2; specific transcripts for differentiation in the progenitors including Oct-4, Ikaros, CD14, CD90 on D15, and anti-ageing and tumor suppressor transcripts NAD, SIRT1, SIRT6 and p53 in both stem cells and progenitors. An improvement of cardiac and pancreatic markers in serum profile was also observed on D15. The decline in VSELs numbers with age and beneficial effects of the XAR™ treatment were evident by up-regulation of specific transcripts and on serum profile. XAR™ is a promising molecule that has the potential to activate pluripotent VSELs and tissue committed adult stem cells 'progenitors' resulting in the rejuvenation of various body tissues and for improved, cancer-free health with advanced age.
Gender plays an important role in the incidence of hematological malignancies and recently hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) were found to proliferate more in females that gets further augmented during pregnancy. It was suggested that since basal numbers of HSCs remain the same in both sexes, possibly HSCs in females undergo increased self-renewal and apoptosis. Then how is self-renewal of stem cells regulated in males? More important, do HSCs undergo asymmetric cell divisions (ACD) or a more primitive population of pluripotent, very small embryonic-like stem cells (VSELs) undergo ACD to self-renew and specify into HSCs? Lot more clarity is required on the bone marrow stem cells biology. Present study was undertaken to evaluate whether similar dimorphism reported for HSCs also exists among VSELs. Bone marrow VSELs and HSCs were studied in bilaterally ovariectomized and castrated mice by flow cytometry after treating with gonadotropin (FSH) and sex steroid (estrogen &amp; progesterone) hormones and during pregnancy. Differential expression of pluripotent (Oct-4A, Sox2, Nanog) and differentiation (Oct-4, Sca1, c-Kit, Ikaros) specific transcripts was studied. Basal BrdU uptake was more in both VSELs (p &lt; 0.01) and HSCs (p &lt; 0.05) in female bone marrow. FSH exerted a more profound effect compared to estradiol in both the sexes. Flow cytometry results showed ten-fold increase in spleen VSELs by mid-gestation associated with approximately two-fold increase in HSCs. These results point to a novel yet unreported role of spleen VSELs during pregnancy. Furthermore, VSELs underwent ACD to self-renew and give rise to slightly bigger HSCs based on unequal expression of NUMB, CD45 and OCT-4.
Regulatory T cells (Tregs) are known to control immune responses by suppressing the antigen-presenting and effector T cells. Some mechanisms adopted by Tregs in combating Mycobacterium infections have been proposed. Nevertheless, in M. leprae infection, also known as leprosy or Hansen's disease, the role of Tregs has not been completely elucidated. Using multicolor flow cytometry, we evaluated the expression of different cell surface and intracellular molecules present in Tregs from peripheral blood samples of leprosy patients. Before initiating treatment, thirteen new cases of leprosy were grouped according to the Ridley-Jopling classification in to the paucibacilary (PB) or multibacilary (MB) group. Fifteen non-infected individuals (NI) were included as control subjects. Tregs were higher in the MB group than in the NI group. Tregs also co-expressed high amounts of PD1 and PDL-1, indicating that these cells could induce apoptosis of effector cells and simultaneously prevent their own apoptosis. Our data showed that compared to the NI group, Tregs from the PB group expressed higher levels of CD95L, which may be associated with other apoptotic pathways that may decrease Tregs in these patients. Correlation analysis reinforced that PD1 and CD95L are efficient apoptosis' pathway that decreased levels of Tregs in the NI and PB groups. We also observed significant differences in cytokine expression of Tregs from the PB and MB groups. Compared to the NI group, Tregs from the MB group showed higher IL-17 expression; however, compared to the PB group, the expression of IL-10 in Tregs from the MB group was lower, suggesting inefficient control of inflammation. Therefore, we concluded that different pathways were involved in Treg-induced suppression of leprosy. Moreover, Treg-mediated regulation of inflammation via IL-10 and IL-17 expression in leprosy patients was inefficient. Thus, we propose that during M. leprae infection, Tregs may impair the immune responses elicited against this bacillus, favor bacterial replication, and aid in persistence of a disseminated multibacillary disease.
Ikaros is a broad transcription factor pointed as a critical regulator of lymphocyte development. Recent reports have emphasized that distinct isoforms of Ikaros control the dichotomy of the hematopoietic system into lymphoid and myeloid lineages. In addition, expression of dominant-negative isoforms of Ikaros is linked to abnormal hematopoiesis, which could culminate in hematological disorders due to loss of function of the protein. B-1 cells are an intriguing subtype of B-lymphocytes that preserves some myeloid characteristics. These cells are able to differentiate into phagocytes (B-1CDP - B-1 cell derived phagocytes) in vitro and in vivo. During such process, reprogramming of gene expression occurs: lymphoid genes are turned off, while expression of myeloid genes is increased. This study aims to investigate whether Ikaros could be related to the control of B-1 cell plasticity. Interestingly, Ikaros expression by B-1CDP cells was found to be relatively low, and the protein is abnormally localized in the cytoplasm. Moreover, the isoforms expressed by B-1 cells are different from those expressed by other lymphocytes, with expression of active isoforms being almost absent in B-1CDP. Based on these findings, Ikaros could be an important factor driving the differentiation and proliferation of B-1 cells.
Philadelphia chromosome-like acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph-like ALL) is a recently described subtype of B-cell precursor ALL with a gene expression profile similar to Ph-positive ALL and a high frequency of IKZF1 alterations. The prevalence of Ph-like ALL increases with age, ranging from 10-15% of children to over 25% of young adults with ALL. It occurs more frequently in males and is associated with adverse clinical features including elevated minimal residual disease levels and poor survival in both children and adults. The genomic landscape of Ph-like ALL is characterized by a diverse range of genetic alterations that dysregulate cytokine receptor and kinase signaling pathways, including rearrangement of CRLF2 and other tyrosine kinases (predominantly ABL-class and Janus kinases). Compelling preclinical data suggest patients harboring ABL-class rearrangements are candidates for ABL1-inhibitors, whilst alterations activating the JAK-STAT pathway may be amenable to treatment with JAK inhibitors. The success of combinatorial treatment of tyrosine kinase inhibitors with chemotherapy in Ph-positive ALL provides a framework for testing this approach in Ph-like ALL. Ongoing prospective studies will determine if incorporation of targeted therapy with intensive chemotherapy regimens will improve the outcome of patients with Ph-like ALL.
The clinical significance of the dominant-negative Ikaros 6 (DN-IK6) in the treatment of patients with Philadelphia-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph+-ALL) with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) remains elusive. In the present study, it was demonstrated that DN-IK6 was overexpressed in B-cell (B)-ALL cases compared with T cell-ALL cases at the mRNA and protein levels. Furthermore, nucleotide sequencing revealed that DN-IK6 was due to the deletion of IKAROS family zinc finger 1 exons 4-7. The outcome of patients with Ph+-B-ALL with DN-IK6, and treated with TKIs and hyper-cyclophosphamide/vincristine/doxorubicin/dexamethasone regimen were restrospectively evaluated in a 2 year follow-up. The results demonstrated that those with the DN isoform exhibited significantly lower incidences of remission, shorter median cumulative incidence of relapse times (P&lt;0.05) and shorter median overall survival times (P&lt;0.05) compared with those without the DN isoform. In conclusion, the results of the present study demonstrated that DN-IK6 is overexpressed in the majority of patients with Ph+-ALL, and is significantly associated with resistance to TKI therapy.
Clinical significance of plant homeodomain finger 2 (PHF2) expressions is explored in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients.
mRNA level was examined by qPCR. The retroviral gene expression, shRNA knockdown and chromatin-immunoprecipitation are used to observe IKAROS regulation on PHF2 transcription.
PHF2 expression is significantly reduced in subsets of ALL patients, and PHF2 low expression correlates with leukemia cell proliferation and an elevation of several poor prognostic markers in B-cell ALL. IKAROS directly promotes PHF2 expression and patients with IKAROS deletion have significantly lower PHF2 expression. Casein kinase II (CK2) inhibitor significantly promotes PHF2 expression in an IKAROS-dependent manner, and casein kinase II inhibitor treatment also results in an increase of PHF2 expression and enrichment of IKAROS and H3K4me3 at PHF2 promoter in primary cells.
Our results demonstrate that the IKAROS promotes PHF2 expression, and suggest that PHF2 low expression works with the IKAROS gene deletion to drive oncogenesis of ALL.
The mechanisms underlying the regulation of decidual natural killer cells (dNKs) at the maternal-fetal interface are unclear.
Primary trophoblasts (TROs), decidual stromal cells (DSCs), and dNKs were cocultured, and responses to LAIR-2 (LAIR-1 inhibitor) and P4H shRNA (collagen inhibitor) were studied.
Coculture of dNKs with primary TROs/DSCs resulted in downregulation of Th1 cytokine production by dNKs. These effects were abrogated by LAIR-2 and P4H shRNA. LAIR-1 binds to SHP-1, which in turn binds to JAK1 and JAK2. Further, the phosphorylation of STAT1/STAT4 and the expression of the downstream transcription factors T-bet and Helios in dNKs were decreased by collagen treatment and primary TROs/DSCs coculture.
The JAK-STAT pathway and its downstream transcription factors T-bet and Helios are involved in the regulation of dNK function by collagen/LAIR-1 interaction, and this signaling mechanism may contribute to the maintenance of immune tolerance at the maternal-fetal interface.
Immunomodulatory drugs (IMiDs), including thalidomide derivatives such as lenalidomide and pomalidomide, offer therapeutic benefit in several hematopoietic malignancies and autoimmune/inflammatory diseases. However, it is difficult to study the IMiD mechanism of action in murine disease models because murine cereblon (CRBN), the substrate receptor for IMiD action, is resistant to some of IMiDs therapeutic effects. To overcome this difficulty, we generated humanized cereblon (CRBNI391V) mice thereby providing an animal model to unravel complex mechanisms of action in a murine physiological setup. In our current study, we investigated the degradative effect toward IKZF1 and CK-1α, a target substrate of IMiDs. Unlike WT mice which were resistant to lenalidomide and pomalidomide, T lymphocytes from CRBNI391V mice responded with a higher degree of IKZF1 and CK-1α protein degradation. Furthermore, IMiDs resulted in an increase in IL-2 among CRBNI391V mice but not in the WT group. We have also tested a thalidomide derivative, FPFT-2216, which showed an inhibitory effect toward IKZF1 protein level. As opposed to pomalidomide, FPFT-2216 and lenalidomide degrades CK-1α. Additionally, we assessed the potential therapeutic effects of IMiDs in dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced colitis. In both WT and humanized mice, lenalidomide showed a significant therapeutic effect in the DSS model of colitis, while the effect of pomalidomide was less pronounced. Thus, while IMiDs' degradative effect on IKZF1 and CK-1α, and up-regulation of IL-2, is dependent on CRBN, the therapeutic benefit of IMiDs in a mouse model of inflammatory bowel disease occurs through a CRBN-IMiD binding region independent pathway.
Philadelphia (Ph)-like or BCR-ABL like acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is defined on the basis of a gene expression profile that is similar to Ph-positive ALL. It comprises a wide spectrum of genetic lesions affecting primarily the cytokine receptor and/or kinase signalling genes. It accounts for approximately 10-15% of pediatric ALL, and is more common in patients who are high-risk according to the National Cancer Institute criteria. Presence of Ph-like mutations is an independent predictor of poor outcome. However, there is vast potential to utilize targeted therapy to improve survival in this group. The sizeable range of genetic lesions varying from translocations, fusions, point mutations and deletions make the diagnosis challenging. Hence, a practical and cost effective approach is required to enable identification in resource constrained settings. Patients with recurrent cytogenetic abnormalities such as ETV6-RUNX1, high hyperdiploidy, TCF3-PBX1, BCR-ABL1 and KMT2A (MLL) rearrangement need not be tested, as these are mutually exclusive with BCR-ABL like mutations. Detection of CRLF2 overexpression, which is the commonest abnormality, is employed as the first step. In patients lacking overexpression, testing for tyrosine kinase fusions can be performed. However, the goal should be to employ a combination of molecular diagnostic techniques such as reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (PCR), real time quantitative PCR, fluorescence in situ hybridization and Sanger sequencing to detect genetic lesions that are amenable to targeted therapy.
Ikaros, encoded by IKZF1 (Ikaros family zinc finger 1), is an important transcription factor in the control of lymphocyte specification and differentiation. Multiple functions of Ikaros have been exerted in almost all hematopoietic cell types, from stem cells to mature lymphoid and myeloid cells. Moreover, nonhematopoietic cells are also functional targets of Ikaros. Ikaros is essential for normal hematopoiesis, autoimmune and tumor suppression. Ikaros mutations were associated with lymphoblastic cells deficiency, autoimmunity and malignancies development, including hematological malignancies (leukemia) and solid tumors. This review focus on discuss the role of Ikaros in hematological malignancies, solid tumors and autoimmune diseases, and highlight the importance of Ikaros in cancer and immune diseases therapy.
We recently showed that the outcome of multiple myeloma (MM) patients treated in the REPEAT study (evaluation of lenalidomide combined with low-dose cyclophosphamide and prednisone (REP) in lenalidomide-refractory MM) was markedly better than what has been described with cyclophosphamide-prednisone alone. The outcome with REP was not associated with plasma cell Cereblon expression levels, suggesting that the effect of REP treatment may involve mechanisms independent of plasma cell Cereblon-mediated direct anti-tumor activity. We therefore hypothesized that immunomodulatory effects contribute to the anti-MM activity of REP treatment, rather than plasma cell Cereblon-mediated effects. Consequently, we now characterized the effect of REP treatment on immune cell subsets in peripheral blood samples collected on day 1 and 14 of cycle 1, as well as on day 1 of cycle 2. We observed a significant mid-cycle decrease in the Cereblon substrate proteins Ikaros and Aiolos in diverse lymphocyte subsets, which was paralleled by an increase in T-cell activation. These effects were restored to baseline at day one of the second cycle, one week after lenalidomide interruption. In vitro, lenalidomide enhanced peripheral blood mononuclear cell-mediated killing of both lenalidomide-sensitive and lenalidomide-resistant MM cells in a co-culture system. These results indicate that the Cereblon-mediated immunomodulatory properties of lenalidomide are maintained in lenalidomide-refractory MM patients and may contribute to immune-mediated killing of MM cells. Therefore, combining lenalidomide with other drugs can have potent effects through immunomodulation, even in patients considered to be lenalidomide-refractory.
Despite major improvements in the treatment landscape, most multiple myeloma (MM) patients eventually succumb to the underlying malignancy. Immunotherapy represents an attractive strategy to achieve durable remissions due to its specificity and capacity for long term memory. Activation of immune cells is controlled by a balance of agonistic and inhibitory signals via surface and intracellular receptors. Blockade of such inhibitory immune receptors (termed as "immune checkpoints") including PD-1/PD-L1 has led to impressive tumor regressions in several cancers. Preclinical studies suggest that these immune checkpoints may also play a role in regulating tumor immunity in MM. Indeed, myeloma was among the first tumors wherein therapeutic efficacy of blockade of PD-1 axis was demonstrated in preclinical models. Expression of PD-L1 on tumor and immune cells also correlates with the risk of malignant transformation. However, early clinical studies of single agent PD-1 blockade have not led to meaningful tumor regressions. Immune modulatory drugs (IMiDs) are now the mainstay of most MM therapies. Interestingly, the mechanism of immune activation by IMiDs also involves release of inhibitory checkpoints, such as Ikaros-mediated suppression of IL-2. Combination of PD-1 targeted agents with IMiDs led to promising clinical activity, including objective responses in some patients refractory to IMiD therapy. However, some of these studies were transiently halted in 2017 due to concern for a possible safety signal with IMiD-PD1 combination. The capacity of the immune system to control MM has been further reinforced by recent success of adoptive cell therapies, such as T cells redirected by chimeric-antigen receptors (CAR-Ts). There remains an unmet need to better understand the immunologic effects of checkpoint blockade, delineate mechanisms of resistance to these therapies and identify optimal combination of agonistic signaling, checkpoint inhibitors as well as other therapies including CAR-Ts, to realize the potential of the immune system to control and prevent MM.
The vast majority of polymorphisms for human dermatologic diseases fall in noncoding DNA regions, leading to difficulty interpreting their functional significance. Recent work using chromosome conformation capture technology in combination with chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) has provided a systematic means of linking noncoding variants in active enhancer loci to putative gene targets. Here, we apply H3K27ac HiChIP high-resolution contact maps, generated from primary human T-cell subsets (CD4+ naïve, T helper type 17, and regulatory T cells), to 21 dermatologic conditions associated with single nucleotide polymorphisms from 106 genome-wide association studies. This "enhancer connectome" identified 1,492 HiChIP gene targets from 542 noncoding SNPs (P ≤ 5.0 × 10-8). SNP-containing enhancers from inflammatory skin conditions were significantly enriched at the HLA locus and also targeted several key factors from the JAK-STAT signaling pathway, but nonimmune conditions were not. A focused profiling of systemic lupus erythematosus HiChIP genes identified enhancer interactions with factors important for effector CD4+ T-cell differentiation and function, including IRF8 and members of the Ikaros family of zinc-finger proteins. Our results show the ability of the enhancer connectome to nominate functionally relevant candidates from genome-wide association study-identified variants, representing a powerful tool to guide future studies into the genomic regulatory mechanisms underlying dermatologic diseases.
To date there has not been a study directly comparing relative Igκ rearrangement frequencies obtained from genomic DNA (gDNA) and cDNA and since each approach has potential biases, this is an important issue to clarify. Here we used deep sequencing to compare the unbiased gDNA and RNA Igκ repertoire from the same pre-B cell pool. We find that ~20% of Vκ genes have rearrangement frequencies ≥2-fold up or down in RNA vs. DNA libraries, including many members of the Vκ3, Vκ4, and Vκ6 families. Regression analysis indicates Ikaros and E2A binding are associated with strong promoters. Within the pre-B cell repertoire, we observed that individual Vκ genes rearranged at very different frequencies, and also displayed very different Jκ usage. Regression analysis revealed that the greatly unequal Vκ gene rearrangement frequencies are best predicted by epigenetic marks of enhancers. In particular, the levels of newly arising H3K4me1 peaks associated with many Vκ genes in pre-B cells are most predictive of rearrangement levels. Since H3K4me1 is associated with long range chromatin interactions which are created during locus contraction, our data provides mechanistic insight into unequal rearrangement levels. Comparison of Igκ rearrangements occurring in pro-B cells and pre-B cells from the same mice reveal a pro-B cell bias toward usage of Jκ-distal Vκ genes, particularly Vκ10-96 and Vκ1-135. Regression analysis indicates that PU.1 binding is the highest predictor of Vκ gene rearrangement frequency in pro-B cells. Lastly, the repertoires of iEκ-/- pre-B cells reveal that iEκ actively influences Vκ gene usage, particularly Vκ3 family genes, overlapping with a zone of iEκ-regulated germline transcription. These represent new roles for iEκ in addition to its critical function in promoting overall Igκ rearrangement. Together, this study provides insight into many aspects of Igκ repertoire formation.
The cereblon modulating agents (CMs) including lenalidomide, pomalidomide and CC-220 repurpose the Cul4-RBX1-DDB1-CRBN (CRL4CRBN) E3 ubiquitin ligase complex to induce the degradation of specific neomorphic substrates via polyubiquitination in conjunction with E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes, which have until now remained elusive. Here we show that the ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes UBE2G1 and UBE2D3 cooperatively promote the K48-linked polyubiquitination of CRL4CRBN neomorphic substrates via a sequential ubiquitination mechanism. Blockade of UBE2G1 diminishes the ubiquitination and degradation of neomorphic substrates, and consequent antitumor activities elicited by all tested CMs. For example, UBE2G1 inactivation significantly attenuated the degradation of myeloma survival factors IKZF1 and IKZF3 induced by lenalidomide and pomalidomide, hence conferring drug resistance. UBE2G1-deficient myeloma cells, however, remained sensitive to a more potent IKZF1/3 degrader CC-220. Collectively, it will be of fundamental interest to explore if loss of UBE2G1 activity is linked to clinical resistance to drugs that hijack the CRL4CRBN to eliminate disease-driving proteins.
Recent studies have demonstrated that the immunomodulatory drugs (IMiDs) lead to the degradation of the transcription factors Ikaros and Aiolos. However, why their loss subsequently leads to multiple myeloma (MM) cell death remains unclear. Using CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing, we have deleted IKZF1/Ikaros and IKZF3/Aiolos in human MM cell lines to gain further insight into their downstream gene regulatory networks. Inactivation of either factor alone recapitulates the cell intrinsic action of the IMiDs, resulting in cell cycle arrest and induction of apoptosis. Furthermore, evaluation of the transcriptional changes resulting from their loss demonstrates striking overlap with lenalidomide treatment. This was not dependent on reduction of the IRF4-MYC "axis," as neither protein was consistently downregulated, despite cell death occurring, and overexpression of either factor failed to rescue for Ikaros loss. Importantly, Ikaros and Aiolos repress the expression of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), including CD38, and their loss led to the activation of an interferon-like response, contributing to MM cell death. Ikaros/Aiolos repressed CD38 expression through interaction with the nucleosome remodeling and deacetylase complex in MM. IMiD-induced loss of Ikaros or treatment with interferon resulted in an upregulation of CD38 surface expression on MM cells, priming for daratumumab-induced NK cell-mediated antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity. These results give further insight into the mechanism of action of the IMiDs and provide mechanistic rationale for combination with anti-CD38 monoclonal antibodies.
Multiple myeloma (MM) cells acquire dormancy and drug resistance via their interaction with bone marrow stroma cells (BMSCs) in a hypoxic microenvironment. In this study, we found a positive expression of CD180/MD-1 complex (a non-canonical toll-like receptor) on MM cells, which was markedly up-regulated under adherent and/or hypoxic conditions. Bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) enhanced the growth of MM cells via the activation of MAP kinases, an effect which showed a positive correlation with the expression levels of CD180. LPS administration significantly increased CD180/CD138 double-positive cell number in a murine xenograft model after the inoculation of MM cells directly attached to BMSCs. Notably, the shRNA-mediated knockdown of CD180 terminated the LPS response in vitro and in vivo. Promoter analyses identified IKZF1 (Ikaros) as a pivotal transcriptional activator of the CD180 gene, whose transcription was activated via cell adhesion and hypoxia by increasing Ikaros expression and its binding to the promoter region. Pharmacological targeting of Ikaros with lenalidomide ameliorated the response of MM cells to LPS in a CD180-dependent manner in vitro and in vivo. CD180/MD-1 pathway may represent a novel mechanism for the regulation of the growth of MM cells in BM milieu and may serve as a therapeutic target to prevent the regrowth of dormant MM cells.
The immunomodulatory drugs (IMiDs) thalidomide, lenalidomide, and pomalidomide, all approved for the treatment of multiple myeloma, induce targeted ubiquitination and degradation of Ikaros (IKZF1) and Aiolos (IKZF3) via the cereblon (CRBN) E3 ubiquitin ligase. IMiD-based proteolysis-targeting chimeras (PROTACs) can efficiently recruit CRBN to a protein of interest, leading to its ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. By linking two pomalidomide molecules, we designed homobifunctional, so-called homo-PROTACs and investigated their ability to induce self-directed ubiquitination and degradation. The homodimerized compound 15a was characterized as a highly potent and efficient CRBN degrader with only minimal effects on IKZF1 and IKZF3. The cellular selectivity of 15a for CRBN degradation was confirmed at the proteome level by quantitative mass spectrometry. Inactivation by compound 15a did not affect proliferation of different cell lines, prevented pomalidomide-induced degradation of IKZF1 and IKZF3, and antagonized the effects of pomalidomide on multiple myeloma cells. Homobifunctional CRBN degraders will be useful tools for future biomedical investigations of CRBN-related signaling and may help to further elucidate the molecular mechanism of thalidomide analogues.
Prenatal infection is a substantial risk factor for neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism in offspring. We have previously reported that influenza vaccination (VAC) during early pregnancy contributes to neurogenesis and behavioral function in offspring.
Here, we probe the efficacy of VAC pretreatment on autism-like behaviors in a lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced maternal immune activation (MIA) mouse model. We show that VAC improves abnormal fetal brain cytoarchitecture and lamination, an effect associated with promotion of intermediate progenitor cell differentiation in MIA fetal brain. These beneficial effects are sufficient to prevent social deficits in adult MIA offspring. Furthermore, whole-genome analysis suggests a strong interaction between Ikzf1 (IKAROS family zinc-finger 1) and neuronal differentiation. Intriguingly, VAC rescues excessive microglial Ikzf1 expression and attenuates microglial inflammatory responses in the MIA fetal brain.
Our study implies that a preprocessed influenza vaccination prevents maternal bacterial infection from causing neocortical lamination impairments and autism-related behaviors in offspring.
Regulatory T cells (Tregs) play a pivotal role in the pathological development of hypertension. Helios, a transcription factor from the Ikaros family, was recently reported to be a bona fide marker for natural Tregs or activated Tregs with suppression function, however, little has been known about its role in hypertension. This study was aimed to find whether Helios+ Tregs really play a vital role in hypertension. A total of 60 hypertension patients, and 46 normotension subjects were enrolled in this study. Frequencies of different Tregs subsets in peripheral blood were measured by flow cytometry. Plasma cytokine level was determined by ELISA. The mRNA expression of Foxp3 and Helios in purified CD4+ T cells was detected by RT-PCR. Proportion of CD4+Foxp3+Helios+ Tregs was decreased significantly in patients with hypertension (62.52%±1.18% vs. 71.89%±1.03%, P&lt;0.01), and it was correlated with plasma level of IL-10 positively (a=0.505, P&lt;0.05) and plasma level of IFN-gamma negatively (r=-0.551, P&lt;0.05). The mRNA expression of Foxp3 (7.23±1.00 vs. 10.58±0.54, P&lt;0.05) and Helios (8.47±0.95 vs. 15.52±2.0, P&lt;0.05) was decreased in CD4+ T cells from patients with hypertension. Helios+ Tregs were decreased in patients with hypertension and may play a protective role in hypertension progression.
Thalidomide and its derivatives, lenalidomide and pomalidomide, are clinically effective treatments for multiple myeloma and myelodysplastic syndrome with del(5q). These molecules lack activity in murine models, limiting investigation of their therapeutic activity or toxicity in vivo. Here, we report the development of a mouse model that is sensitive to thalidomide derivatives because of a single amino acid change in the direct target of thalidomide derivatives, cereblon (Crbn). In human cells, thalidomide and its analogs bind CRBN and recruit protein targets to the CRL4CRBN E3 ubiquitin ligase, resulting in their ubiquitination and subsequent degradation by the proteasome. We show that mice with a single I391V amino acid change in Crbn exhibit thalidomide-induced degradation of drug targets previously identified in human cells, including Ikaros (Ikzf1), Aiolos (Ikzf3), Zfp91, and casein kinase 1a1 (Ck1α), both in vitro and in vivo. We use the CrbnI391V model to demonstrate that the in vivo therapeutic activity of lenalidomide in del(5q) myelodysplastic syndrome can be explained by heterozygous expression of Ck1α in del(5q) cells. We found that lenalidomide acts on hematopoietic stem cells with heterozygous expression of Ck1α and inactivation of Trp53 causes lenalidomide resistance. We further demonstrate that CrbnI391V is sufficient to confer thalidomide-induced fetal loss in mice, capturing a major toxicity of this class of drugs. Further study of the CrbnI391V model will provide valuable insights into the in vivo efficacy and toxicity of this class of drugs.
Lenalidomide mediates the ubiquitination and degradation of Ikaros family zinc finger protein 1 (IKZF1), IKZF3, and casein kinase 1α (CK1α) by facilitating their interaction with cereblon (CRBN), the substrate receptor for the CRL4CRBN E3 ubiquitin ligase. Through this mechanism, lenalidomide is a clinically effective treatment of multiple myeloma and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) with deletion of chromosome 5q [del(5q) MDS]. To identify the cellular machinery required for lenalidomide-induced CRL4CRBN activity, we performed a positive selection, genome-scale clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-CRISPR-associated protein 9 (Cas9) screen in a lenalidomide-sensitive myeloma cell line. CRBN was the top-ranking gene, with all CRBN-targeting guide RNAs (gRNAs) ranking as the 6 highest-scoring gRNAs. A counterscreen using an IKZF3 degron reporter to assay lenalidomide-induced protein degradation highlighted regulators of cullin-RING ligase neddylation and 2 E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes as necessary for efficient lenalidomide-induced protein degradation. We demonstrated that loss of UBE2M or members of the constitutive photomorphogenesis 9 (COP9) signalosome results in altered neddylation of cullin 4A and impairs lenalidomide-dependent CRL4CRBN activity. Additionally, we established that UBE2D3 and UBE2G1 play distinct roles in substrate ubiquitination by CRL4CRBN, with UBE2D3 acting to prime targets via monoubiquitination and UBE2G1 functioning to extend polyubiquitin chains with lysine 48 linkages. The validation of UBE2D3 and UBE2G1 highlights the functional capacity of CRISPR-Cas9 screening to identify E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme and E3 ubiquitin ligase complex pairings. More broadly, these findings establish key proteins required for lenalidomide-dependent CRL4CRBN function in myeloma and inform potential mechanisms of drug resistance.
To study the effects of minimal residual disease (MRD) level on day 33 of remission induction and IKZF1 genotype on the survival of children with B-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL).
A total of 152 children with newly-diagnosed B-ALL who had complete remission after the first cycle of the chemotherapy and had complete follow-up information were enrolled in this study. According to the MRD detection by flow cytometry on day 33 of remission induction, they were divided into three groups: standard-risk (SR) group (MRD &lt;10-4; n=60), intermediate-risk (IR) group (10-4≤ MRD &lt;10-2; n=55), and high-risk (HR) group (MRD ≥10-2; n=37). Nested RT-PCR was used to determine the IKZF1 genotype of all children before chemotherapy. The effects of MRD level on day 33 of remission induction and IKZF1 genotype on the recurrence-free survival (RFS) of children with B-ALL were analyzed.
There were 7 common IKZF1 subtypes in all the 152 children with B-ALL: IK1, IK2/3, IK4, IK6, IK8, IK9, and IK10. Of the 152 children, 130 had functional subtypes of IKZF1 and 22 had non-functional subtypes of IKZF1. During the follow-up period, relapse occurred in 26 (17%) children, and the recurrence rate was highest in the HR group (P&lt;0.05). However, there was no significant difference in the recurrence rate between the SR group and the IR group (P&gt;0.05). The cumulative recurrence rate of the children with non-functional subtypes of IKZF1 was significantly higher than that of those with functional types of IKZF1 (P&lt;0.01). The predicted 5-year RFS rates in the SR, IR, and HR groups were (94.2±2.9)%, (86.7±3.8)%, and (56.2±4.5)% respectively (P&lt;0.05). The 5-year RFS rate of the children with functional subtypes of IKZF1 was significantly higher than that of those with non-functional subtypes of IKZF1 (P&lt;0.01). There was no significant difference in the predicted 5-year RFS rate between the children with functional subtypes of IKZF1 and those with non-functional subtypes of IKZF1 in the SR group (P&gt;0.05). However, the predicted 5-year RFS rate of the children with functional subtypes of IKZF1 was significantly higher than that of those with non-functional subtypes of IKZF1 in the IR group and the HR group (P&lt;0.05).
B-ALL children with non-functional subtypes of IKZF1 have a high recurrence rate, and the recurrence rate will be even higher in B-ALL children with non-functional subtypes of IKZF1 and MRD ≥10-4 on day 33 of chemotherapy.
Plasmacytoid and conventional dendritic cells (pDCs and cDCs) arise from monocyte and dendritic progenitors (MDPs) and common dendritic progenitors (CDPs) through gene expression changes that remain partially understood. Here we show that the Ikaros transcription factor is required for DC development at multiple stages. Ikaros cooperates with Notch pathway activation to maintain the homeostasis of MDPs and CDPs. Ikaros then antagonizes TGFβ function to promote pDC differentiation from CDPs. Strikingly, Ikaros-deficient CDPs and pDCs express a cDC-like transcriptional signature that is correlated with TGFβ activation, suggesting that Ikaros is an upstream negative regulator of the TGFβ pathway and a repressor of cDC-lineage genes in pDCs. Almost all of these phenotypes can be rescued by short-term in vitro treatment with γ-secretase inhibitors, which affects both TGFβ-dependent and -independent pathways, but is Notch-independent. We conclude that Ikaros is a crucial differentiation factor in early dendritic progenitors that is required for pDC identity.
Methylation in IKZF1 and BCAT1 are common events in colorectal cancer (CRC). They are often detected in blood as circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) at diagnosis and disappear after surgery in most CRC patients. A prospective study was conducted to determine the relationship between detection of these markers following surgery and risk for residual disease and for recurrence.
ctDNA status with methylated BCAT1 and IKZF1 was determined within 12 months of surgical resection of CRC, and was related to presence of or risk for residual disease (margins involved, metastases present or nature of node involvement), and to recurrence-free survival.
Blood was collected from 172 CRC patients after surgery and 28 (16%) were ctDNA positive. Recurrence was diagnosed in 23 of the 138 with clinical follow-up after surgery (median follow-up 23.3 months, IQR 14.3-29.5). Multivariate modeling indicated that features suggestive of residual disease were an independent predictor of post-surgery ctDNA status: cases with any of three features (close resection margins, apical node involved, or distant metastases) were 5.3 times (95% CI 1.5-18.4, p = 0.008) more likely to be ctDNA positive. Multivariate analysis showed that post-surgery ctDNA positivity was independently associated with an increased risk of recurrence (HR 3.8, 1.5-9.5, p = 0.004).
CRC cases positive for methylated ctDNA after surgery are at increased risk of residual disease and subsequently recurrence. This could have implications for guiding recommendations for adjuvant therapy and surveillance strategies. Randomized studies are now indicated to determine if monitoring cases with these biomarkers leads to survival benefit.
Primary effusion lymphoma (PEL) is an aggressive cancer with few treatment options. The immunomodulatory drugs (IMiDs) lenalidomide and pomalidomide have recently been shown to kill PEL cell lines, and lenalidomide is in clinical trials against PEL. IMiDs bind to the CRL4CRBN E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, leading to the acquisition of the Ikaros family zinc finger proteins 1 and 3 (IKZF1 and IKZF3), casein kinase 1 α (CK1α), and zinc finger protein 91 (ZFP91) as neosubstrates. IMiDs are effective against multiple myeloma because of degradation of IKZF1 and IKZF3 and the consequent loss of interferon regulatory factor 4 (IRF4) and MYC expression. Lenalidomide is also effective in chromosome 5q deletion-associated myelodysplastic syndrome as a result of degradation of CK1α. An essential IKZF1-IRF4-MYC axis has recently been proposed to underlie the toxicity of IMiDs in PEL. Here, we further investigate IMiD effectors in PEL cell lines, based on genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 screens for essential human genes. These screens and extensive validation experiments show that, of the 4 neosubstrates, only CK1α is essential for the survival of PEL cell lines. In contrast, IKZF1 and IKZF3 are dispensable, individually or in combination. IRF4 was critical in all 8 PEL cell lines tested, and surprisingly, IMiDs triggered downregulation of IRF4 expression independently of both IKZF1 and IKZF3. Reexpression of CK1α and/or IRF4 partially rescued PEL cell lines from IMiD-mediated toxicity. In conclusion, IMiD toxicity in PEL cell lines is independent of IKZF1 and IKZF3 but proceeds through degradation of the neosubstrate CK1α and downregulation of IRF4.
IKZF1 and IKZF3 (encoding transcription factors Ikaros and Aiolos) are susceptibility loci for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). The pharmacology of iberdomide (CC-220), a cereblon (CRBN) modulator targeting Ikaros and Aiolos, was studied in SLE patient cells and in a phase 1 healthy volunteer study.
CRBN, IKZF1 and IKZF3 gene expression was measured in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from patients with SLE and healthy volunteers. Ikaros and Aiolos protein levels were measured by Western blot and flow cytometry. Anti-dsDNA and anti-phospholipid autoantibodies were measured in SLE PBMC cultures treated for 7 days with iberdomide. Fifty-six healthy volunteers were randomised to a single dose of iberdomide (0.03-6 mg, n=6 across seven cohorts) or placebo (n=2/cohort). CD19+ B cells, CD3+ T cells and intracellular Aiolos were measured by flow cytometry. Interleukin (IL)-2 and IL-1β production was stimulated with anti-CD3 and lipopolysaccharide, respectively, in an ex vivo whole blood assay.
SLE patient PBMCs expressed significantly higher CRBN (1.5-fold), IKZF1 (2.1-fold) and IKZF3 (4.1-fold) mRNA levels compared with healthy volunteers. Iberdomide significantly reduced Ikaros and Aiolos protein levels in B cells, T cells and monocytes. In SLE PBMC cultures, iberdomide inhibited anti-dsDNA and anti-phospholipid autoantibody production (IC50 ≈10 nM). Single doses of iberdomide (0.3-6 mg) in healthy volunteers decreased intracellular Aiolos (minimum mean per cent of baseline: ≈12%-28% (B cells); ≈0%-33% (T cells)), decreased absolute CD19+ B cells, increased IL-2 and decreased IL-1β production ex vivo.
These findings demonstrate pharmacodynamic activity of iberdomide and support its further clinical development for the treatment of SLE.

To investigate the prognosis of patients with adult B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) with Ikaros family zinc-finger 1 (IKZF1) mutation and determine the role of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) in improving the clinical outcome, we detected the IKZF1 mutation and BCR-ABL fusion gene at diagnosis in the bone marrow of 164 adult patients with B-ALL, and analyzed the clinical data of these patients retrospectively. Our analysis showed that grade III-IV acute graft-versus-host disease and IKZF1 mutation in the transplantation group and age and IKZF1 mutation in the non-transplantation group were independent factors for poor prognosis by univariate and multivariate analyses.The 3-year overall survival (OS) and leukemia-free survival (LFS) rates were much lower in the IKZF1+/BCR-ABL+ subgroup than in the IKZF1+/BCR-ABL- and IKZF1-/BCR-ABL- subgroups in both the transplantation and non-transplantation groups. The 3-year OS and LFS rates were significantly higher in the transplantation group than in the non-transplantation group with IKZF1 mutation.The study demonstrated that IKZF1 mutation was an independent factor indicating the poor prognosis of adult B-ALL and much worse prognosis in the BCR-ABL+ subgroup in both non-transplantation and transplantation groups. However, allo-HSCT significantly improved the OS and LFS of patients and also their clinical outcomes.
Dana-Farber Cancer Institute (DFCI) ALL Consortium Protocol 05-001 tested a new risk stratification system in children and adolescents with newly diagnosed acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). At study entry, B-ALL patients were classified as standard risk (SR) or high risk (HR) based on age, white blood cell (WBC) count, and central nervous system status. After achieving complete remission (CR), patients with high end-induction minimal residual disease (MRD) (≥10-3 by polymerase chain reaction analysis of patient-specific antigen receptor rearrangements) and/or adverse cytogenetics (KMT2A rearrangement or hypodiploidy) were reclassified as very high risk (VHR) and received intensified therapy. IKZF1 deletion status was retrospectively evaluated by multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification. Between 2005 and 2011, 678 Philadelphia chromosome-negative B-ALL patients aged 1 to 18 years enrolled; 651 achieved CR and 648 received a final risk group. Among all 678 patients, 5-year event-free survival (EFS) was 87% (95% confidence interval [CI], 84-89) and overall survival 93% (95% CI, 90-94). Five-year disease-free survival of SR patients (N = 407) was 94% (95% CI, 91-96), HR (N = 176) was 84% (95% CI, 77-88), and VHR (N = 65) was 79% (95% CI, 67-87). IKZF1 deletion was present in 62 of 385 (16%) assessed patients and was associated with inferior 5-year EFS (63%; 95% CI, 49%-74% vs 88%; 95% CI, 84%-91%; P &lt; .001), and higher 5-year cumulative incidence of relapse, including among those with low MRD (24% vs 8%, P = .001). In multivariable analysis, age ≥15 years, WBC ≥50 × 109/L, IKZF1 deletion, and MRD ≥10-4 was each associated with inferior outcome. In conclusion, risk-stratified therapy on DFCI 05-001 resulted in favorable outcomes for B-ALL patients, including those with VHR features. IKZF1 deletion was an independent predictor of inferior outcome. This trial was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as #NCT00400946.
Differentiation of blood cells is one of the most complex processes in the body. It is regulated by the action of transcription factors in time and space which creates a specific signaling network. In the hematopoietic signaling system, Notch is one of the main regulators of lymphocyte development. The aim of this study was to get insight into the regulation of Notch signalization and the influence of poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase (PARP) activity on this process in three leukemia cell lines obtained from B and T cells. PARP1 is an enzyme involved in posttranslational protein modification and chromatin structure changes. B and T leukemia cells were treated with Notch and PARP inhibitors, alone or in combination, for a prolonged period. The cells did not show cell proliferation arrest or apoptosis. Analysis of gene and protein expression set involved in Notch and PARP pathways revealed increase in JAGGED1 expression after PARP1 inhibition in B cell lines and changes in Ikaros family members in both B and T cell lines after &amp;gamma;-secretase inhibition. These data indicate that Notch and PARP inhibition, although not inducing differentiation in leukemia cells, induce changes in signaling circuits and chromatin modelling factors.
We prospectively examined whether surface expression of Cytokine Receptor-Like Factor 2 (CRLF2) on leukemic blasts is associated with survival and induction treatment response in pediatric B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (BCP-ALL) patients. Flow cytometric analysis of bone marrow-derived leukemia cells revealed that 7.51% (29/286) of 386 pediatric BCP-ALL patients were CRLF2-positive (CRLF2pos) at diagnosis. The median minimal residual disease (MRD) was lower in CRLF2pos than CRLF2-negative (CRLF2neg) patients on day 15 (MRD15) after induction therapy [0.01% (0.001-0.42%) vs. 0.45% (0.05-3.50%); p=0.001]. By contrast, the MRD15 was higher in Ikaros family Zinc Finger Protein 1 (IKZF1)-deleted BCP-ALL patients than in BCP-ALL patients without IKZF1 deletions [1.18% (0.06-12.0%) vs 0.33% (0.03-2.6%); p=0.003]. Subgroup analysis showed that MRD15 levels were lower in IKZF1Δ/CRLF2pos patients than in IKZF1Δ/CRLF2neg patients [0.1% (0.02-5.06%) vs. 2.9% (0.25-12%); p=0.005]. Furthermore, MRD15 levels were higher in IKZF1WT/CRLF2neg patients than in IKZF1WT/CRLF2pos patients [0.40% (0.04-2.7%) vs. 0.001% (0.001-0.01%)]. Despite the low MRD15 levels, IKZF1Δ/CRLF2pos patients showed poorer relapse-free survival (RFS) than other patient groups (p=0.003). These findings demonstrate that surface CRLF2 expression is associated with increased risk of relapse in pediatric BCP-ALL patients harboring IKZF1 deletions.
The differentiation of self-renewing progenitor cells requires not only the regulation of lineage- and developmental stage-specific genes but also the coordinated adaptation of housekeeping functions from a metabolically active, proliferative state toward quiescence. How metabolic and cell-cycle states are coordinated with the regulation of cell type-specific genes is an important question, because dissociation between differentiation, cell cycle, and metabolic states is a hallmark of cancer. Here, we use a model system to systematically identify key transcriptional regulators of Ikaros-dependent B cell-progenitor differentiation. We find that the coordinated regulation of housekeeping functions and tissue-specific gene expression requires a feedforward circuit whereby Ikaros down-regulates the expression of Myc. Our findings show how coordination between differentiation and housekeeping states can be achieved by interconnected regulators. Similar principles likely coordinate differentiation and housekeeping functions during progenitor cell differentiation in other cell lineages.
The IKZF1 gene is formed by 8 exons and encodes IKAROS, a transcription factor that regulates the expression of genes that control cell cycle progression and cell survival. In general, 15-20% of the patients with preB acute lymphoblastic leukemia (preB ALL) harbor IKZF1 deletions, and the frequency of these deletions increases in BCR-ABL1 or Ph-like subgroups. These deletions have been associated with poor treatment response and the risk of relapse. The aim of this descriptive study was to determine the frequency of IKZF1 deletions and the success of an induction therapy response in Mexican pediatric patients diagnosed with preB ALL in 2 hospitals from 2017 to August 2018. Thirty-six bone marrow samples from patients at the Instituto Nacional de Pediatría in Mexico City and the Centro Estatal de Cancerología in Tepic were analyzed. The IKZF1 deletion was identified by MLPA using the SALSA MLPA P335 ALL-IKZF1 probemix. Deletions of at least 1 IKZF1 exon were observed in 7/34 samples (20.6%): 3 with 1 exon deleted; 1 with 2 exons, 1 with 5 exons, 1 with 6 exons, and 1 patient with a complete IKZF1 deletion. This study was descriptive in nature; we calculated the frequency of the IKZF1 gene deletion in a Mexican pediatric population with preB ALL as 20.6%.
Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation for patients with dominant-negative IKZF1/IKAROS mutations is not associated with unusually high risks of acute graft versus host disease or mortality.
Primary chest wall lymphoma is rare and typically associated with chronic pleural inflammation. Double-hit lymphoma (DHL), which is defined as aggressive mature B-cell lymphoma with MYC and BCL2 or BCL6 rearrangements, is a highly aggressive malignancy that tends to have extranodal involvement and is resistant to standard immunochemotherapy. We herein report a 55-year-old man with no history of chronic pleural inflammation, diagnosed with primary chest wall DHL with MYC/BCL6 rearrangement, and harboring a unique BCL6 translocation, t (3;7) (q27;p12). After six courses of intensive chemotherapy, he has achieved complete remission. To our knowledge, this is the first case report of primary chest wall DHL.
Objective: To analyze the prognostic impact of Ikaros family zinc finger 1(IKZF1) mutation on adult Philadelphia chromosome (Ph1) positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients. Methods: IKZF1 mutation was detected in 63 adult Ph1 positive ALL patients at diagnosis using capillary electrophoresis. Recruited patients were treated in our center and other three hospitals in Ningbo from January 2014 to January 2017. Clinical data were collected and retrospectively analyzed. Results: Thirty-nine (61.9%) patients were positive IKZF1 mutation in this cohort. The white blood cell (WBC) count in IKZF1 mutation group was significantly higher than that of mutation negative group [(64.6±11.3)×10(9)/L vs. (33.7±5.6)×10(9)/L, P&lt;0.05]. Patients with WBC count over 30×10(9)/L accounted for 56.4% in IKZF1 mutation group. Complete remission (CR) rate in the IKZF1 mutation group was also lower than that of negative group after induction chemotherapy (64.1% vs. 75.0%, P&gt;0.05). IKZF1 was a negative prognostic factor but not independent factor for survival by univariate and multivariate analyses. Patients were divided into chemotherapy and allogeneic transplantation groups. The 3-year overall survival (OS) rate and 3-year leukemia-free survival (LFS) rate in IKZF1 mutation group were significantly lower than those of negative group in both transplantation group (42.3% vs. 59.3%; 31.2% vs. 50.0%; respectively, both P&lt;0.05) and chemotherapy group (24.8% vs. 40.0%; 19.0% vs. 34.3%; respectively, both P&lt;0.05). Conclusion: IKZF1 mutation is a poor prognostic factor for adult Ph1 positive ALL patients.
目的： 观察Ikaros家族锌指蛋白1（IKZF1）基因突变对成人费城染色体（Ph）阳性急性淋巴细胞白血病（ALL）预后的影响。 方法： 2014年1月—2017年1月在宁波市4家医院接受治疗的成人Ph(+) ALL患者共63例，收集患者临床资料及初诊时骨髓或外周血标本，采用毛细管电泳法检测IKZF1突变情况，分析IKZF1突变情况与预后的关系。 结果： 63例成人Ph(+) ALL中合并IKZF1突变者39例，占61.9%。IKZF1突变组初诊时白细胞计数明显高于IKZF1无突变组[（64.6±11.3）×10(9)/L比（33.7±5.6）×10(9)/L，P&lt;0.05]，突变组白细胞计数≥30×10(9)/L者的比例高达56.4%。IKZF1突变组首次诱导化疗4周内的完全缓解率为64.1%，低于IKZF1无突变组（75.0%），但差异无统计学意义（P&gt;0.05）。单因素和多因素分析结果提示，IKZF1突变是影响Ph(+) ALL预后的因素，但不是独立影响因素。根据是否接受过异基因造血干细胞移植将全部患者分为化疗组和移植组。化疗组中IKZF1突变者的3年总生存（OS）率和无白血病生存（LFS）率明显低于IKZF1无突变者（24.8%比40.0%；19.0%比34.3%；P值均&lt;0.05）。移植组中IKZF1突变者的3年OS率和LFS率也明显低于IKZF1无突变者（42.3%比59.3%；31.2%比50.0%；P值均&lt;0.05）。 结论： IKZF1突变是成人Ph(+) ALL的一个不良预后因素。.
Aiolos/Ikaros family zinc finger 3 (IKZF3), a member of the Ikaros family of lymphocyte maturation-driving transcription factors, is highly expressed in hematopoietic malignancies. However, its role in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and cancer stem cell (CSC)-like properties in lung cancer remains unknown. Human lung cancer cell lines H1299 with overexpressing Aiolos (H1299-Aiolos) and A549 with overexpressing Aiolos (A549-Aiolos) were generated by stable transfection. Cell migration and invasion assays were done to demonstrate their invasion and migration ability. Sphere formation assay was used to determine their tumor-initiating capability. Aiolos overexpression induced EMT and increased migration/invasiveness in H1299 and A549 cells. Aiolos overexpression also increased metastatic ability in vivo. Aiolos overexpression upregulated the expression of Twist and matrix metalloproteinase 16 (MMP16). By using knockdown of Twist or an inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase, EMT, migration/invasiveness ability, and MMP16 expression were reversed in H1299-Aiolos and A549-Aiolos cells. Overexpression of Aiolos upregulated the CSC-like properties in lung cancer cells, and were also reversed by an inhibitor of PI 3-kinase. For lung cancer cells, Aiolos overexpression promotes EMT and CSC-like properties through upregulating the PI 3-kinase/Akt pathway. The information is helpful for developing therapeutic strategies targeting Aiolos expression for lung cancer treatment.
Leukemia is a heterogeneous disorder, characterized by elevated proliferation of white blood cells. Various genetic studies have assessed the contributory roles of several single nucleotide polymorphisms with the development of leukemia. The role of genetic variation in the ARID5B and IKZF1 genes has previously been identified in various population groups; however, the role of these variants in the north Indian populations of Jammu and Kashmir is unknown.
In this study, we explored the association of the newly identified genetic variants, rs10740055 of ARID5B and rs6964823 of IKZF1, with leukemic patients from Jammu and Kashmir of northern India.
The variants were genotyped using TaqMan allele discrimination assays for 616 individuals (210 leukemic cases and 406 healthy controls). The association of each SNP with the disease was evaluated using logistic regression.
It was observed that the variants rs6964823 (IKZF1) and rs10740055 (ARID5B) showed significant associations with odds ratio (OR) and p-values of 1.5 (1.0-2.3 at 95% confidence interval [CI]) and 0.04; and 2.5 (1.5-4.1 at 95% CI) and 0.0002, respectively. We also evaluated the cumulative effect for both the variants by combining the risk genotypes and obtained and OR of 4.9.
It was found that the variants rs10740055 of ARID5B and rs6964823 of IKZF1 act individually and additively as risk factors in the development of leukemia in the populations of Jammu and Kashmir in Northern India.
The zinc finger protein IKAROS (IKZF1) is an essential transcription factor in haematopoiesis that is involved primarily in lymphoid tissue differentiation. Many studies have indicated that IKZF1 alterations may be associated with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, but the results remain controversial.
We aimed to investigate the association of the rs4132601 T/G and rs10272724 T/C IKZF1 gene polymorphisms with the risk of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia and to determine whether these genetic variants affect the clinical parameters and the iron profiles of these children cohort.
This case control study was conducted on 170 Egyptian children comprising of two groups: group (I) included 90 children diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia and group (II) comprised of 80 ages and sex-matched healthy control children. The studied polymorphisms were genotyped using PCR restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP).
A higher frequency of the mutant GG genotype and G allele of rs4132601 was found in the patient group than in the control group. The results also showed a significant difference among the rs10272724 genotypes, with a higher frequency of the mutant CC genotype and C allele in the patients than in controls. The mutant GG genotype of rs4132601 and the mutant CC genotype of rs10272724 were associated with a higher serum ferritin level and transferrin saturation and an older age at diagnosis of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia than the other genotypes.
IKZF1 rs4132601 and rs10272724 could be considered significant risk contributors to childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia and may impact the iron profiles in these children.
Cyclin-dependent kinases 4 and 6 (CDK4/6) are key regulators of the cell cycle, and there are FDA-approved CDK4/6 inhibitors for treating patients with metastatic breast cancer. However, due to conservation of their ATP-binding sites, development of selective agents has remained elusive. Here, we report imide-based degrader molecules capable of degrading both CDK4/6, or selectively degrading either CDK4 or CDK6. We were also able to tune the activity of these molecules against Ikaros (IKZF1) and Aiolos (IKZF3), which are well-established targets of imide-based degraders. We found that in mantle cell lymphoma cell lines, combined IKZF1/3 degradation with dual CDK4/6 degradation produced enhanced anti-proliferative effects compared to CDK4/6 inhibition, CDK4/6 degradation, or IKZF1/3 degradation. In summary, we report here the first compounds capable of inducing selective degradation of CDK4 and CDK6 as tools to pharmacologically dissect their distinct biological functions.
Ikaros family zinc finger protein 1 and 3 (IKZF1 and IKZF3) are transcription factors that promote multiple myeloma (MM) proliferation. The immunomodulatory imide drug (IMiD) lenalidomide promotes myeloma cell death via Cereblon (CRBN)-dependent ubiquitylation and proteasome-dependent degradation of IKZF1 and IKZF3. Although IMiDs have been used as first-line drugs for MM, the overall survival of refractory MM patients remains poor and demands the identification of novel agents to potentiate the therapeutic effect of IMiDs. Using an unbiased screen based on mass spectrometry, we identified the Runt-related transcription factor 1 and 3 (RUNX1 and RUNX3) as interactors of IKZF1 and IKZF3. Interaction with RUNX1 and RUNX3 inhibits CRBN-dependent binding, ubiquitylation, and degradation of IKZF1 and IKZF3 upon lenalidomide treatment. Inhibition of RUNXs, via genetic ablation or a small molecule (AI-10-104), results in sensitization of myeloma cell lines and primary tumors to lenalidomide. Thus, RUNX inhibition represents a valuable therapeutic opportunity to potentiate IMiDs therapy for the treatment of multiple myeloma.
To explore the possible molecular mechanism of Ikaros regulation on FUT4 expression by analyzing the correlation of the functional state of Ikaros with level of FUT4 expression, so as to provide the theoretical basis for personalized treatment in children with ALL.
The subtypes of Ikaros were identified by nested PCR and sequencing. The expression level of FUT4 was detected by quantitative PCR and analyzed by ΔΔCt method in the early stage of treatment, remission and relapse of ALL.
Ik1 and Ik2 were the main functional subtypes, and the dominant negative Ikaros was Ik6; the Ik6 was detected in 23 patients with ALL. It was found that 2.73% patients expressing Ik6 alone and 18.18% patients with heterozygous expression were detected. The expression of FUT4 in the newly diagnosed ALL was higher than that in the control group, and the functional Ikaros negatively correlated with the FUT4 expression(r=-0.6329).
Dominant negative Ikaros closely correlated with the relapse of acute lymphoblastic leukemia in children. The functional Ikaros negatively correlated with FUT4 expression. Ikaros inhibit the transcriptional activity of FUT4, that may be the molecular mechanism of Ikaros regulating the expression of FUT4.
Regulatory T cells (Tregs) play a critical role in the maintenance of a pregnancy. While the kinetics of the number of peripheral blood Tregs has been satisfactorily described in mouse models, analysis of these cell populations in human pregnancy is complicated by high variability in the quantity of Tregs and inconsistencies in the markers used for detecting different types of Treg. In the light of this, we set out to investigate the kinetics of various types of Treg, including CD45RA, GARP and PD-1(+) Tregs, in the peripheral blood of pregnant women in the first, second and third trimester, and at the time of delivery. Tregs, defined as a CD4(+)CD25(++)CD127(dim)Foxp3(+) population of leucocytes, were detected using flow cytometry. Natural thymus-derived Tregs and induced Tregs in the peripheral blood were distinguished by the expression or absence of a Helios marker, respectively. Our results showed that during normal pregnancy the sizes of various Treg subpopulations varied across women and also in an individual woman did not remain constant but varied significantly, most notable being the decrease observed at the time of delivery. Helios(-) cells were significantly less frequent in the peripheral blood of healthy pregnant women than Helios(+) cells, and the majority of Tregs were Helios(+)PD-1(+) Tregs.
Most chronic viruses evade T-cell and natural killer (NK) immunity through downregulation of immune surface markers. Previously we showed that Pomalidomide (Pom) increases surface expression of major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) in Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus-infected latent and lytic cells and restores ICAM-1 and B7-2 in latent cells. We explored the ability of Pom to increase immune surface marker expression in cells infected by other chronic viruses, including human T-cell leukemia virus type-1 (HTLV-1), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), human papilloma virus (HPV), Merkel cell polyoma virus (MCV), and human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1). Pom increased MHC-1, ICAM-1, and B7-2/CD86 in immortalized T-cell lines productively infected with HTLV-1 and also significantly increased their susceptibility to NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity. Pom enhancement of MHC-I and ICAM-1 in primary cells infected with HTLV-1 was abrogated by knockout of HTLV-1 orf-1. Pom increased expression of ICAM-1, B7-2 and MHC class I polypeptide related sequence A (MICA) surface expression in the EBV-infected Daudi cells and increased their T-cell activation and susceptibility to NK cells. Moreover, Pom increased expression of certain of these surface markers on Akata, Raji, and EBV lymphoblastic cell lines. The increased expression of immune surface markers in these virus-infected lines was generally associated with a decrease in IRF4 expression. By contrast, Pom treatment of HPV, MCV and HIV-1 infected cells did not increase these immune surface markers. Pom and related drugs may be clinically beneficial for the treatment of HTLV-1 and EBV-induced tumors by rendering infected cells more susceptible to both innate and adaptive host immune responses.
Immunomodulatory drugs (IMIDs) are very effective in the treatment of multiple myeloma (MM). The description of their cereblon-mediated mechanism of action was a hallmark in MM research. Although the importance of IMID-induced degradation of cereblon-binding proteins is well described in vitro, the prognostic value of their expression levels in MM cells is less clear. Based on recently published data showing somewhat conflicting RNA levels, we analyzed the association between the levels of the Ikaros family zinc finger protein 1 (IKZF1), IKZF3, and karyopherin subunit alpha 2 (KPNA2) proteins measured by flow cytometry and prognostic parameters in 214 newly diagnosed MM patients who were randomized in the GMMG HD6 trial. No statistically significant associations between the expression levels and age, gender, light chain type, International Staging System (ISS) stage or cytogenetic high- and normal risk groups could be identified. Hyperdiploid MM cells expressed significantly higher levels of IKZF1, IKZF3 and KPNA2 than nonhyperdiploid cells. In contrast, translocation t(11;14) was associated with significantly lower expression levels. In conclusion, the observed overexpression of cereblon-binding proteins in MM cells with gain of chromosomes 5, 9, 11, 15, and 19 is consistent with the previously proposed positive regulation of MYC by IKZF1 and IKZF3, as well as MYC activation in hyperdiploid MM cells.
Unveiling the mechanism of the relapse of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the key to improve the prognosis of ALL and remains a huge challenge. Glycan-based interactions play a vital role in immune surveillance, cell-cell adhesion and cell-matrix interaction, contributing to treatment failure in tumor. However, the glycan essential for leukemia development and its upstream regulatory mechanism by oncogenic drivers were rarely reported. Here, we demonstrated that LeX, a well-characterized cancer-related glycan epitope, strengthened the cell-matrix interaction via glycosylating α5β1 integrin under the control of the driver oncogenic Ikaros isoform (IK6) in ALL. By analyzing the expression profile of Ikaros and the level of FUT4/LeX in clinical samples, we found that FUT4/LeX was positively correlated with dysfunctional Ikaros isoforms. IK1 (Full length Ikaros) regulates the level of FUT4 as a transcription repressor, while IK6 abolished the wild-type Ikaros mediated transcriptional repression and resulted in higher level of FUT4 expression. Moreover, we demonstrated that FUT4 could activate α5β1-mediated sequential signal transduction and accelerate adhesion and invasion between integrin α5β1 in leukemia cells and fibronectin in extracellular matrix (ECM) via increasing glycosylation. Together, our study provides a new insight into the mechanisms by which Ikaros mutation induced ALL cells invasion and a potential strategy for drug-resistance ALL by blocking LeX in combination with common chemotherapy.
CD4 Th cells are organizers of the immune response, directing other immune cells to initiate and maintain effective humoral and cellular immunity. CD4 T cells differentiate into distinct Th effector or regulatory subsets in response to signals delivered to them during the course of infection. Ikaros is a transcription factor that is expressed in blood cells from the level of the hematopoietic stem cell. It is required for normal thymic T cell development and serves as a tumor suppressor, as lack of Ikaros in developing lymphoid cells results in leukemia. To study the role of Ikaros in CD4 T cell differentiation and function, an Ikaros conditional knockout mouse was developed such that Ikaros expression was deleted specifically in mature T cells, thus avoiding defects observed in germline Ikaros mutant mice. Using this model system, we have shown that in the absence of Ikaros, CD4 T cells are able to attain Th1, Th2, and Th17, but not inducible regulatory T, cell fates. However, they show enhanced expression of a cohort of proinflammatory cytokines, resulting in differentiation of Th17 cells with a phenotype that has been associated with autoimmunity and pathological inflammation. In addition, we define Ikaros as a repressor of the gene program associated with the response to type I IFNs, another key pathway whose deregulation is linked to autoimmunity. Taken together, these data definitively define Ikaros as a critical regulator at the center of the inflammatory response in T cells and highlight a potential role in suppressing autoimmunity.
Identification of key stemness regulators is critical for developing more effective therapies against acute myeloid leukemia stem cells (LSCs). In this issue of Cell Stem Cell, Park et al. (2019) report that IKZF2, a member of the Ikaros family of transcription factors, drives self-renewal and suppresses differentiation in LSCs through modulation of chromatin accessibility.
Poverty is a well-known risk factor for a child's health and development. This paper aimed to establish whether poverty negatively affected both intra-uterine growth and early childhood growth, i.e., whether children facing poverty were at a double disadvantage.
For this study, we made use of routinely collected data on child development throughout early childhood from the 2006-2009 birth cohorts in Kind &amp; Gezin's Ikaros database collected during 2,605,975 consultations with 273,935 children from birth to 730 days old. Indicators for child development at birth were gestational age and height-at-birth. A standardized height-for-age indicator captured height development throughout early childhood. A multidimensional indicator measured the risk of poverty. For the analysis of development at birth, we used linear and logistic regression; for the analysis of height development during early childhood, we estimated linear and logistic growth curve models.
The risk of poverty negatively affected both gestational age and height-at-birth. Throughout early childhood, we observed a negative relation between the risk of poverty and height-for-age indicators. However, the effect varied throughout childhood. Children at risk of poverty (over)compensated for their smaller stature at birth, and between ages 6 and 18 months, approximately, the negative effects of risk of poverty decreased substantially or disappeared. However, towards the end of the period studied, children born in households at risk of poverty started to lag again in height development.
This study found that the risk of poverty indeed negatively affected a child's growth, both in utero and in early childhood. However, the results suggest that developmental lags later in childhood were not merely an extension of such lags at birth.
The aim of this study was to establish the association of two polymorphisms of the β-defensin 1 gene (DEFB1, OMIM#602056) with the risk of developing type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in a group of Mexican patients.
The 5'UTR -20 G/A, and -44 C/G polymorphisms of DEFB1 gene were genotyped by 5' exonuclease TaqMan assays in a group of 252 patients with T2DM and 522 healthy control.
Under dominant and additive models adjusted for the risk factors, the C allele of the -44 C/G polymorphism was associated with increased risk of T2DM (OR = 1.63, 95% CI = 1.07-2.48, pCdom  = 0.021 and OR = 1.42, 95% CI = 1.05-1.91, pCadd  = 0.023, respectively). In addition, the linkage disequilibrium analysis showed that AC haplotype was associated with an increased risk of developing T2DM (OR = 4.39, p = 0.04). The in-silico analysis showed that the -44 C allele produces a binding site for the transcription factor Ikaros (IK).
This study demonstrates that the C allele of -44 C/G polymorphism, as well as haplotype AC are associated with the presence of T2DM in the Mexican population. The variation in this polymorphism of the DEFB1 gene could increase the migration of the macrophages to pancreatic islets accelerate the β-cell dysfunction in T2DM.
Expression of Rag1 and Rag2 is tightly regulated in developing T cells to mediate TCR gene assembly. Here we have investigated the molecular mechanisms governing the assembly and disassembly of a transcriptionally active RAG locus chromatin hub in CD4+CD8+ thymocytes. Rag1 and Rag2 gene expression in CD4+CD8+ thymocytes depends on Rag1 and Rag2 promoter activation by a distant antisilencer element (ASE). We identify GATA3 and E2A as critical regulators of the ASE, and Runx1 and E2A as critical regulators of the Rag1 promoter. We reveal hierarchical assembly of a transcriptionally active chromatin hub containing the ASE and RAG promoters, with Rag2 recruitment and expression dependent on assembly of a functional ASE-Rag1 framework. Finally, we show that signal-dependent down-regulation of RAG gene expression in CD4+CD8+ thymocytes depends on Ikaros and occurs with disassembly of the RAG locus chromatin hub. Our results provide important new insights into the molecular mechanisms that orchestrate RAG gene expression in developing T cells.
Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) mediate signal transduction in cells. Small molecules that regulate PPIs are important tools for biology and biomedicine. Dynamic imaging of small molecule induced PPIs characterizes and verifies these molecules in living cells. It is thus important to develop cellular assays for dynamic visualization of small molecule induced protein-protein association and dissociation in living cells. Here we have applied a fluorophore phase transition based principle and designed a PPI assay named SPPIER (separation of phases-based protein interaction reporter). SPPIER utilizes the green fluorescent protein (GFP) and is thus genetically encoded. Upon small molecule induced PPI, SPPIER rapidly forms highly fluorescent GFP droplets in living cells. SPPIER detects immunomodulatory drug (IMiD) induced PPI between cereblon and the transcription factor Ikaros. It also detects IMiD analogue (e.g., CC-885) induced PPI between cereblon and GSPT1. Furthermore, SPPIER can visualize bifunctional molecules (e.g. PROTAC)-induced PPI between an E3 ubiquitin ligase and a target protein. Lastly, SPPIER can be modified to image small molecule induced protein-protein dissociation, such as nutlin-induced dissociation between HDM2 and p53. The intense brightness and rapid kinetics of SPPIER enable robust and dynamic visualization of PPIs in living cells.
Mutations and single nucleotide polymorphisms of AT-rich interactive domain-containing protein 5B (ARID5B) are involved in the oncogenesis of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and treatment outcomes. However, ARID5B expression and clinical significance in ALL remain unclear. We found ARID5B is significantly down-regulated in ALL compared to healthy bone marrow controls. ARID5B also interacts with PHD finger protein 2 (PHF2). Low expression of ARID5B (ARID5Blow) or ARID5B and PHF2 (ARID5BlowPHF2low) is correlated with the markers of cell proliferation and poor prognosis in ALL patients. Ikaros directly regulates ARID5B expression in ALL. Restoring Ikaros function by Casein Kinase II inhibition also promotes ARID5B expression through recruitment of trimethylation of lysine 4 on histone H3 (H3K4me3) at its promoter region. In summary, our data show that aberrant expression of ARID5B and PHF2 is related to leukemic cell proliferation and several poor prognostic markers. Our data indicate ARID5Blow expression, particularly ARID5BlowPHF2low expression, is linked to Ikaros dysfunction and involved in the oncogenic effect of high-risk ALL, which may represent a high-risk subgroup of ALL.
The small molecules thalidomide, lenalidomide, and pomalidomide induce the ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of the transcription factors Ikaros (IKZF1) and Aiolos (IKZF3) by recruiting a Cys2-His2 (C2H2) zinc finger domain to Cereblon (CRBN), the substrate receptor of the CRL4CRBN E3 ubiquitin ligase. We screened the human C2H2 zinc finger proteome for degradation in the presence of thalidomide analogs, identifying 11 zinc finger degrons. Structural and functional characterization of the C2H2 zinc finger degrons demonstrates how diverse zinc finger domains bind the permissive drug-CRBN interface. Computational zinc finger docking and biochemical analysis predict that more than 150 zinc fingers bind the drug-CRBN complex in vitro, and we show that selective zinc finger degradation can be achieved through compound modifications. Our results provide a rationale for therapeutically targeting transcription factors that were previously considered undruggable.
The Ikaros (Ik) gene family, which includes Ik, Aiolos (Ai), and Helios (He), is a primary regulator of lymphocyte differentiation, and is involved in the development of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). We analysed the expression of the Ik gene family isoforms in 97 ALL cases, consisting of 64 childhood and 33 infant ALL cases, using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Expression of Ik was detected in all cases, 87 of which expressed either Ik1 or Ik2, or both, five of which expressed Ik1/Ik2 and Ik6, and another five of which expressed only Ik6. Therefore, the dominant negative isoform of Ik6 was expressed in 10 of the 38 cases of childhood precursor B ALL, but was absent in other types of childhood ALL (26.3%, chi2-test, P = 0.0001). In terms of Aiolos and Helios expression, 49 (65.3%) out of the 75 and 40 (50%) out of the 80 ALL cases tested showed non-spliced Ai1 and He1 respectively. Only one case of T lineage ALL expressed a small-sized isoform of Helios (designated as He6). It was also found that the expression of Ai1 and He1 was low in Ik6-positive patients (Fisher's exact test; Ai1 P = 0.005, Hel P = 0.035).
Ikaros is a transcription factor that directs lymphoid lineage commitment and pituitary neuroendocrine cell expansion and function. Here, we show that Ikaros regulates the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDL-R) to alter metabolism in pituitary corticotroph cells. The DNA-binding Ikaros isoform Ik1 binds and enhances activity of the LDL-R promoter. Ik1 decreases methylation and increases acetylation of histone H3 (Lys(9)) at the LDL-R promoter. Confocal microscopy and quantitative fluorometry show enhanced LDL endocytosis in Ik1-transfected cells that exhibit abundant endoplasmic reticulum, large Golgi complexes, and prominent secretory granule formation, consistent with more robust cholesterol incorporation into functionally relevant membrane-rich organelles. Consistent with these data, LDL-R(-/-) mice, like Ik(-/-) mice, have decreased circulating levels of adrenocorticotropic hormone. These findings expand the repertoire of Ikaros actions to include regulation of the cholesterol uptake metabolic pathway with therapeutic implications for lipid-modifying drugs in Ikaros-associated cancers.
Renal dopamine receptors have been shown to play a critical role in ROS-dependent hypertension. D5 dopamine receptor deficient (D5-/-) mice are hypertensive and have increased systemic oxidative stress which is manifested in the kidney and the brain. To further investigate the underlying mechanisms of hypertension in D5-/- mice, we used RNA arrays to compare mRNA levels of kidneys from wildtype and D5-/- mice. Our data show, that the mRNA level of alpha/beta hydrolase 1 (ABHD1) is significantly upregulated in D5-/- mice. Additionally, overexpression of ABHD1 in a new established renal proximal tubule cell line reduced the amount of O(2)(-) produced by the NADPH oxidase. Therefore the upregulation of ABHD1 in D5-/- mice could be an answer to the increased oxidative stress. While oxidative stress is an important factor for the development of hypertension, ABHD1 could play a protective role in the pathogenesis of hypertension.
Bacterial AlkB and three human AlkB homologues (ABH1, ABH2, and ABH3) are Fe(2+)/2-oxoglutarate-dependent oxygenases that directly repair alkylation-damaged DNA. Here, we show that ABH1 unexpectedly has a second activity, cleaving DNA at abasic (AP) sites such as those arising spontaneously from alkylation-dependent depurination reactions. The DNA cleavage activity of ABH1 does not require added Fe(2+) or 2-oxoglutarate, is not inhibited by EDTA, and is unaffected by mutation of the putative metal-binding residues, indicating that this activity arises from an active site distinct from that used for demethylation. AP-specific DNA cleavage was shown to occur by a lyase mechanism, rather than by hydrolysis, with the enzyme remaining associated with the DNA product. ABH1 can cleave at closely spaced AP-sites on opposite DNA strands yielding double-strand breaks in vitro and this reaction may relate to the physiological role of this unexpected AP lyase activity.
The Escherichia coli AlkB protein was recently found to repair cytotoxic DNA lesions 1-methyladenine and 3-methylcytosine by using a novel iron-catalyzed oxidative demethylation mechanism. Three human homologs, ABH1, ABH2 and ABH3, have been identified, and two of them, ABH2 and ABH3, were shown to have similar repair activities to E.coli AlkB. However, ABH1 did not show any repair activity. It was suggested that ABH3 prefers single-stranded DNA and RNA substrates, whereas AlkB and ABH2 can repair damage in both single- and double-stranded DNA. We employed a chemical cross-linking approach to probe the structure and substrate preferences of AlkB and its three human homologs. The putative active site iron ligands in these proteins were mutated to cysteine residues. These mutant proteins were used to cross-link to different DNA probes bearing thiol-tethered bases. Disulfide-linked protein-DNA complexes can be trapped and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Our results show that ABH2 and ABH3 have structural and functional similarities to E.coli AlkB. ABH3 shows preference for the single-stranded DNA probe. ABH1 failed to cross-link to the probes tested. This protein, unlike other AlkB proteins, does not seem to interact with DNA in its E.coli expressed form.
Single-strand DNA binding proteins protect DNA from nucleolytic damage, prevent formation of secondary structures and prevent premature reannealing of DNA in DNA metabolic transactions. In eukaryotes, the nuclear single-strand DNA binding protein RPA is essential for chromosomal DNA replication and transcription and directly participates in several DNA repair processes by binding to and modulating the activity of repair factors. Much less is known about the involvement of the only mitochondrial single-strand binding protein mtSSB in the context of DNA repair. Here we demonstrate that mtSSB impedes excision of uracil and oxidative demethylation of 3meC in single-stranded DNA by UNG1 and ABH1, respectively, whereas excision by NEIL1 was partially inhibited. mtSSB also effectively inhibited nicking of single-stranded DNA by APE1 and ABH1 and partially inhibited the lyase activity of NEIL1. Finally we identified a putative surface motif in mtSSB that may recruit UNG1 to DNA-bound mtSSB. We suggest that the massive amount of mtSSB in mitochondria effectively prevents processing of uracil and other types of damaged bases to avoid introduction of nicks in single-stranded mtDNA formed during replication. Local enrichment of UNG1 at DNA-bound mtSSB may furthermore facilitate rapid access to- and processing of the damage once the dsDNA conformation is restored. This could be of potential biological importance, since mitochondria have no or limited capacity for homologous recombination to process nicks at the replication fork.
Inhibition of DNA repair mechanism through alkylating agents in tumor cells is an important method for cancer treatment. Alkylation damage repair gene AlkB was first reported in E. coli. In human and other mammals eight distinguishing homologs of AlkB were detected and are known as hABH1 to hABH8. Crystal structures of hABH2 and hABH3 elucidated the role of human AlkB homologs involved in DNA and RNA repair pathways. No crystal structure of hABH1 is available for the detailed study on the nature and function of the molecule. In the present work we performed homology modeling and different tertiary structure based study on human AlkB homolog hABH1. hABH1.B99990005.pdb, out of five models generated using the program modeler 9v7 and validated with Ramachandran plot showed that 97.9% residues were in the favored and additional allowed region and less residues in disallowed region, which is the best among all models. Functions of the selected model were studied in terms of cation binding, transition metal ion binding and metal ion binding function with oxidoreductase activity. Two functional sites and one conserved cluster were detected in the protein. Ligand binding residue prediction showed four ligand clusters with 17 ligands in cluster 1. In this cluster seven Fe(2+) heterogen counts were detected. Most significantly, predicted iron-binding motif in hABH1 was found as His231-X-Asp233-XnHis287 which corresponds to His131-XAsp133-Xn-His187 in AlkB of E. coli homologue. This shows the similar pattern of aspartic acid and histidine residues in the functional part of the protein both in human and E. coli. These results can be used further to design inhibitors aiding chemotherapy and cancer related diseases.
Mitochondrial gene expression uses a non-universal genetic code in mammals. Besides reading the conventional AUG codon, mitochondrial (mt-)tRNAMet mediates incorporation of methionine on AUA and AUU codons during translation initiation and on AUA codons during elongation. We show that the RNA methyltransferase NSUN3 localises to mitochondria and interacts with mt-tRNAMet to methylate cytosine 34 (C34) at the wobble position. NSUN3 specifically recognises the anticodon stem loop (ASL) of the tRNA, explaining why a mutation that compromises ASL basepairing leads to disease. We further identify ALKBH1/ABH1 as the dioxygenase responsible for oxidising m5C34 of mt-tRNAMet to generate an f5C34 modification. In vitro codon recognition studies with mitochondrial translation factors reveal preferential utilisation of m5C34 mt-tRNAMet in initiation. Depletion of either NSUN3 or ABH1 strongly affects mitochondrial translation in human cells, implying that modifications generated by both enzymes are necessary for mt-tRNAMet function. Together, our data reveal how modifications in mt-tRNAMet are generated by the sequential action of NSUN3 and ABH1, allowing the single mitochondrial tRNAMet to recognise the different codons encoding methionine.
Decreased lipolytic activity in adipose tissue may be one of the reasons behind excess accumulation of body fat during pregnancy. The aim of this study was to analyze the effect of progesterone on the expression of: (a) Lipe (encoding hormone-sensitive lipase, HSL), (b) Pnpla2 (encoding adipose triglyceride lipase, ATGL), (c) abhydrolase domain containing 5 (Abhd5), and (d) G0/G1 switch 2 (G0s2) genes in white adipose tissue (WAT), as potential targets for progesterone action during the course of pregnancy. Administration of progesterone to female rats, which was reflected by approximately 2.5-fold increase in circulating progesterone concentration, is associated with a decrease in Lipe gene expression in the inguinal WAT. The expression of Pnpla2 gene in all main fat depots of females and males remained unchanged after progesterone administration. Administration of progesterone resulted in an increase in the expression of Abhd5 gene (whose product increases ATGL activity) and G0s2 gene (whose product decreases ATGL activity) in the inguinal WAT of female rats. Mifepristone, a selective antagonist of progesterone receptor, abolished the effect of progesterone on Lipe, Abhd5 and G0s2 genes expression in the inguinal WAT. The decrease in Lipe and the increase in Abhd5 and G0s2 genes expression was associated with lower rate of stimulated lipolysis. Administration of progesterone exerted no effect on Lipe, Abhd5 and G0s2 genes expression and stimulated lipolysis in the retroperitoneal WAT of females, as well as in the inguinal, epididymal and retroperitoneal WAT of males. In conclusion, our findings suggest that progesterone decreases the rate of lipolysis in the inguinal WAT of female rats, inhibiting the activity of both ATGL (by stimulating synthesis of G0S2 - specific inhibitor of the enzyme) and HSL (due to inhibition of Lipe gene expression). 
The Scripps Research Institute Molecular Screening Center (SRIMSC) recently completed a fluorescence-polarization activity-based protein profiling (fluopol-ABPP) high throughput screening (HTS) campaign to identify inhibitors of protein phosphatase methylesterase-1 (PME-1). This campaign unveiled a phenomenal class of potent and selective inhibitors, the aza-beta lactams (ABLs), one of which, ML174, showed exceptional in situ and in vivo potency and selectivity for PME-1. During medicinal chemistry investigation of the ABLs for PME-1, we observed that one of the common anti-targets was the uncharacterized serine hydrolase abhydrolase domain containing protein 10 (ABHD10). This fortuitous discovery of inhibitor leads was of particular interest to us, as we had recently uncovered some exciting evidence that ABHD10 functions as a lipase in situ. A principle goal of post-genomic research is to elucidate the molecular and cellular roles of uncharacterized enzymes like ABHD10, an investigation which profits significantly from chemical tools for precise regulation of enzyme activity. Given that no selective inhibitors of ABHD10 have yet been reported in the literature, we completed a medicinal chemistry campaign to optimize an ABL probe for ABHD10, which is presented herein as ML257. This probe is highly potent against ABHD10 in vitro (IC50 = 17 nM), in situ (IC50 = 28 nM), and in vivo (active at 25 mg/kg, i.p., in mice), and exhibits remarkable selectivity among 40+ other serine hydrolases. Importantly, this probe demonstrates the potential for exploiting fortuitous inhibitor leads for orthogonal, “anti-target” enzymes, thus maximizing the benefits of a single HTS campaign, and highlights the “privileged” nature of the ABL scaffold for serine hydrolase inhibitor development.
Lung cancer is the leading cause of all cancer related deaths with a worldwide mortality of 1.2 million each year. The 5-year survival rate ranges from 80% in early stages to a dismal 5% in advanced disease. Prognosis is currently mostly determined based on the extension of disease at diagnosis. Thereby it has become evident that predicted and real outcomes can vary significantly, even for patients with the same stage of disease. Novel biomarkers with a reliable predictive significance are therefore clearly needed. In this study we implemented an activity-based, solely mass spectrometry dependent biomarker discovery platform. We investigated the role of serine hydrolase activities as potential biomarkers for human lung adenocarcinoma, the most common lung cancer subtype. Forty pairs of fresh frozen malignant and matching non-neoplastic lung tissues were analyzed and enzymatic activities linked to clinical follow-up data. We found that the activities of Abhydrolase domain-containing protein 11 and Esterase D predict the development of distant metastases and the presence of aggressive lung adenocarcinomas, respectively, in a statistically significant model. We conclude that serine hydrolase activities bear a predictive potential for human lung adenocarcinoma and that activity-based proteomics represents a powerful methodology in the search for novel disease biomarkers.
Lipolysis of stored triacylglycerols provides lipid precursors for the assembly of apolipoprotein B (apoB) lipoproteins in hepatocytes. Abhydrolase domain containing 5 (ABHD5) is expressed in liver and facilitates the lipolysis of triacylglycerols. To study the function of ABHD5 in lipoprotein secretion, we silenced the expression of ABHD5 in McA RH7777 cells using RNA interference and studied the metabolism of lipids and secretion of apoB lipoproteins. McA RH7777 cells deficient in ABHD5 secreted reduced amounts of apoB, triacylglycerols, and cholesterol esters. Detailed analysis of liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry data for the molecular species of secreted triacylglycerols revealed that deficiency of ABHD5 significantly reduced secretion of triacylglycerols containing oleate, even when oleate was supplied in the culture medium; the ABHD5-deficient cells partially compensated by secreting higher levels of triacylglycerols containing saturated fatty acids. In experiments tracking the metabolism of [(14)C]oleate, silencing of ABHD5 reduced lipolysis of cellular triacylglycerols and incorporation of intermediates derived from stored lipids into secreted triacylglycerols and cholesterol esters. In contrast, the incorporation of exogenous oleate into secreted triacylglycerols and cholesterol esters was unaffected by deficiency of ABHD5. These findings suggest that ABHD5 facilitates the use of lipid intermediates derived from lipolysis of stored triacylglycerols for the assembly of lipoproteins.
The zebrafish has served as a model organism for developmental biology. Sequencing its genome has expanded zebrafish research into physiology and drug-development testing. Several cannabinoid pharmaceuticals are in development, but expression of endocannabinoid receptors and enzymes remains unknown in this species. We conducted a bioinformatics analysis of the zebrafish genome using 17 human endocannabinoid genes as a reference set. Putative zebrafish orthologs were identified in filtered BLAST searches as reciprocal best hits. Orthology was confirmed by three in silico methods: phylogenetic testing, synteny analysis, and functional mapping. Zebrafish expressed orthologs of cannabinoid receptor 1, transient receptor potential channel vanilloid receptor 4, GPR55 receptor, fatty acid amide hydrolase 1, monoacylglycerol lipase, NAPE-selective phospholipase D, abhydrolase domain-containing protein 4, and diacylglycerol lipase alpha and beta; and paired paralogs of cannabinoid receptor 2, fatty acid amide hydrolase 2, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha, prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2, and transient receptor potential cation channel subtype A1. Functional mapping suggested the orthologs of transient receptor potential vanilloid receptor 1 and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma lack specific amino acids critical for cannabinoid ligand binding. No orthologs of N-acylethanolamine acid amidase or protein tyrosine phosphatase, non-receptor type 22 were identified. In conclusion, the zebrafish genome expresses a shifted repertoire of endocannabinoid genes. In vitro analyses are warranted before using zebrafish for cannabinoid development testing.
The papilla of the mammalian kidney must tolerate greatly varying degrees of hyperosmotic stress during urine concentration and depending on whole organism hydration state. To identify proteome adaptations supporting cell function and survival in such a harsh environment we compared the proteome of a) the hyperosmotic renal papilla with that of adjacent iso-osmotic cortex tissue and b) the renal papilla of diuretic versus that of anti-diuretic mice. Though functionally distinct the papilla is in close physical proximity to the renal cortex, an iso-osmotic region. Proteomic differences between the papilla and cortex of C57BL6 mice were identified using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and MALDI-TOF/TOF mass spectrometry. We found 37 different proteins characteristic of the cortex and 16 proteins over-represented in the papilla. Regional specificity was confirmed by Western blot and further substantiated by immunohistochemistry for selected proteins. Proteins that are characteristic of the renal papilla include αB crystallin, Hsp beta-1, Hsp90, 14-3-3 protein, glutathione S-transferase, aldose reductase, actin and tropomyosin. Gene ontology analysis confirmed a significant increase in molecular functions associated with protein chaperoning and cell stabilization. Proteins over-represented in the cortex were largely related to routine metabolism. During antidiuresis 15 different proteins changed significantly while 18 different proteins changed significantly during diuresis relative to normally hydrated controls. Changes were confirmed by Western blot for selected proteins. Proteins that are significantly altered by diuretic state are associated with cell structure (actin, tubulin), signaling (Rho GDP dissociation inhibitor, abhydrolase domain-containing protein 14B), chaperone functioning (Hsp beta-1, αB crystallin, T complex protein-1) and anti-oxidant functions (α-enolase, GAPDH and LDH). Taken together our study reveals that specific proteins involved in protein folding, cytoskeletal stabilization, antioxidant responses, and stress signaling contribute greatly to the unique hyperosmotic stress resistant phenotype of the kidney papilla.
Ankaferd® Blood Stopper (ABS) comprises a standardized mixture of the plants Thymus vulgaris, Glycyrrhiza glabra, Vitis vinifera, Alpinia officinarum, and Urtica dioica. The basic mechanism of action for ABS is the formation of an encapsulated protein network that provides focal points for vital erythrocyte aggregation. ABS-induced protein network formation with blood cells, particularly erythrocytes, covers the primary and secondary hemostatic system without disturbing individual coagulation factors.
To understand the effect mechanisms of ABS on hemostasis, a proteomic analysis using 2D gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometer was performed.
Proteins of plant origin in Ankaferd® were NADP-dependent-malic enzyme, ribulose bisphosphate-carboxylase-large chain, maturase K, ATP synthase subunit-beta, ATP synthase subunit-alpha, chalcone-flavanone isomerase-1, chalcone-flavanone isomerase-2, and actin-depolymerizing factor. Furthermore, functional proteomic studies revealed that proteins resembling human peptides have been detected within Ankaferd®, including ATP synthase, mucin-16 (CD164 sialomucin-like 2 protein), coiled-coil domain containing 141 hypothetical protein LOC283638 isoform 1, hypothetical protein LOC283638 isoform 2, dynactin 5, complex I intermediate-associated protein 30, mitochondrial, NADH dehydrogenase (ubiquinone) 1 alpha subcomplex, TP synthase, H+ transporting, mitochondrial actin binding 1 isoform, LIM domain and actin binding 1 isoform a, LIM domain and actin binding 1 isoform b, spectrin alpha non erythrocytic 1, prolactin releasing hormone receptor, utrophin, tet oncogene family member 2 isoform b, protein phosphatase 1 regulatory subunit 12A, NIMA (never in mitosis gene a)-related kinase, ATP-binding cassette protein C12, Homo sapiens malic enzyme 1, mitochondrial NADP(+)-dependent malic enzyme 3, ME2 protein, nuclear factor 1 B-type, abhydrolase domain-containing protein 12B, E3 SUMO-protein ligase PIAS2, alpha-1, 2-glucosyltransferase ALG10-A, cofilin, non-muscle isoform, 18 kDa phosphoprotein, p18, actin-depolymerizing factor (ADF), twinfilin-1, ankyrin repeat and FYVE domain-containing protein 1, usherin precursor, urotensin II receptor, interleukin 4, and midkine.
Proteomic analysis of Ankaferd® represents a true basis for the upcoming Ankaferd® studies focusing on its wound healing, hemostatic, anti-infective, antineoplastic, and preservative biological actions.

Autophagy critically contributes to metabolic reprogramming and chromosomal stability. It has been reported that monoallelic loss of the essential autophagy gene BECN1 (encoding BECN1/Beclin 1) promotes cancer development and progression. However, the mechanism by which BECN1 is inactivated in malignancy remains largely elusive. We have previously reported a tumor suppressor role of ABHD5 (abhydrolase domain containing 5), a co-activator of PNPLA2 (patatin like phospholipase domain containing 2) in colorectal carcinoma (CRC). Here we report a noncanonical role of ABHD5 in regulating autophagy and CRC tumorigenesis. ABHD5 directly competes with CASP3 for binding to the cleavage sites of BECN1, and consequently prevents BECN1 from being cleaved by CASP3. ABHD5 deficiency provides CASP3 an advantage to cleave and inactivate BECN1, thus impairing BECN1-induced autophagic flux and augmenting genomic instability, which subsequently promotes tumorigenesis. Notably, clinical data also confirm that ABHD5 proficiency is significantly correlated with the expression levels of BECN1, LC3-II and CASP3 in human CRC tissues. Our findings suggest that ABHD5 possesses a PNPLA2-independent function in regulating autophagy and tumorigenesis, further establishing the tumor suppressor role of ABHD5, and offering an opportunity to develop new approaches aimed at preventing CRC carcinogenesis.
Elevated concentrations of circulating non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA) were reported in (a) humans with lipodystrophy, (b) humans following bariatric surgery, and (c) transgenic mice with reduced amounts of adipose tissue. Paradoxically, these findings suggest that the reduction of adipose tissue mass is associated with elevated circulating NEFA concentrations. To explain a molecular background of this phenomenon, we analyzed the effects of surgical removal of inguinal, epididymal, and retroperitoneal white adipose tissue (WAT) on (a) circulating NEFA concentrations, (b) expression of Pnpla2, a gene that encodes adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL), genes encoding abhydrolase domain containing 5 (ABHD5) and G0/G1 switch 2 (G0S2), i.e., a coactivator and inhibitor of ATGL, respectively, and (c) expression of Lipe gene coding hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) in mesenteric WAT. Reduction of adipose tissue mass resulted in an increase in circulating NEFA concentration, which was associated with (a) an increase in the expressions of Pnpla2 and Abhd5, (b) decrease in G0s2 expression, and (c) upregulation of Lipe expression, all measured on both mRNA and protein levels in mesenteric WAT of male rats. The rate of lipolysis in mesenteric WAT explants and isolated adipocytes from lipectomized rats was significantly higher than that from the controls. In conclusion, upregulation of Pnpla2 expression and activation of ATGL (due to an increase in ABHD5 and decrease in G0S2 levels), as well as a coordinated interplay of these genes with Lipe in mesenteric WAT, contribute, at least in part, to an increase in the concentration of circulating NEFA in rats with reduced fat mass.
Abhydrolase domain containing 5 (ABHD5) functions as a tumor suppressor in colorectal and prostate cancers. The aim of this study was to investigate the roles of ABHD5 in endometrial cancer.
ABHD5 expression was detected in clinical samples by immunohistochemical staining. Cell proliferation and invasion were evaluated with the Cell Counting Kit-8 and Transwell assay, respectively. Western blotting was performed to analyze protein expression. Glucose uptake was assessed by 2-[N-(7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl)amino]-2-deoxyglucose. Lactate production was detected by a lactate assay kit.
In the present study, ABHD5 was overexpressed in endometrial cancer tissues, and its expression was closely correlated with the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage and lymph node metastasis. In addition, we observed that the knockdown of ABHD5 inhibited cell proliferation, invasion, glucose uptake and lactate production in HEC-1A cells, which expressed high levels of ABHD5. Conversely, the opposite effects were observed when ABHD5 was ectopically expressed in Ishikawa cells, which had low levels of ABHD5. Furthermore, the changes in glycolysis regulators (enolase 1 [ENO1], glucose transporter 1 [GLUT1] and lactate dehydrogenase A [LDHA]) and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition-related proteins (E-cadherin and Snail) in HEC-1A cells with ABHD5 knockdown were consistent with the effects of ABHD5 on glycolysis and cell invasion. Phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN) was increased, while the phosphorylated AKT (p-AKT) was decreased when ABHD5 was downregulated. Notably, treatment with the allosteric AKT inhibitor MK-2206 completely abolished the effects caused by ABHD5 overexpression in Ishikawa cells. Finally, ABHD5 knockdown potently suppressed tumor growth in vivo.
Overall, these results suggest that ABHD5 may play an oncogenic role in endometrial cancer via the AKT pathway.
Some lipid digestion pathways in fish deviate from those in mammals, and many differences may also be species dependent. This report describes a pathway for monoacylglycerol (MAG) and lysophospholipid absorption by intestinal enterocytes in brown trout that may be of significance in salmonids. When culturing primary cells in a medium containing 1- and 2-MAG, we observed a massive hydrolysis of unesterified fatty acids. The hydrolysis activity was retained in the medium even after the removal of the cells. To further characterize these activities, both extracellular and isolated membrane proteins were tested for lipase activity toward triacylglycerol (TAG), diacylglycerol (DAG), MAG, phosphatidylcholine (PtdCho), and lysoPtdCho. In both cases, the main hydrolyzing activity was toward MAG followed by lysoPtdCho with very little activity toward DAG, TAG, or PtdCho. The extracellular and membrane proteins were partially purified by fast protein liquid chromatography and identified by proteomics (liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry) focusing on lipase/hydrolase enzymes. In the membrane protein fraction, the data suggested that MAG was produced as an intermediate in the hydrolysis of lysoPtdCho by either lysophospholipase C or lysophospholipase D activity. Both abhydrolase-domain-containing protein 6 and abhydrolase-domain-containing protein 12 were identified in the membrane protein and they could be responsible for the hydrolysis of MAG. In the culture medium, low-peptide matches were found for ABHD6 and phospholipases and further studies are needed. In summary, trout enterocytes are capable of hydrolyzing MAG and lysoPtdCho. The enzymes are both extracellular and membrane bound. The pathways may be of significance during lipid absorption in fish lacking a 1,3 specific pancreatic lipase.
The present study attempted to identify the potential key genes and pathways of hyperlipidemia, and to investigate the possible mechanisms associated with them.
The array data of GSE3059 were downloaded, including thirteen samples of hyperlipidemia from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. The weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) was performed with WGCNA package, and the salmon and midnight blue modules were found as the highest correlation. Gene Ontology annotation and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analyses for these two modules were performed by cluster Profiler and DOSE package. A protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was established using Cytoscape software, and significant modules were analyzed using Molecular Complex Detection.
Five genes (histone deacetylase 4, HDAC4; F2R like trypsin receptor 1, F2RL1; abhydrolase domain containing 2, ABHD2; transmembrane 4 L six family member 1, TM4SF1; and family with sequence similarity 13-member A, FAM13A) were found with a significant meaning. When their expression levels were validated with RT-qPCR, the relative expression levels were lower (HDAC4) and higher (F2RL1, ABHD2, TM4SF1 and FAM13A) in hyperlipidemia than in normal controls (P &lt; 0.05-0.01). Subgroup analysis showed that the relative expression levels of HDAC4 were lower, whereas those of F2RL1 and ABHD2 were higher in Maonan than in Han ethnic groups (P &lt; 0.05).
Except for genetic factors and environmental exposures, epigenetic influence was another mechanism of hyperlipidemia in our study populations, which needed to further confirm.
Chromatin remodeling at specific genomic loci controls lymphoid differentiation. Here, we investigated the role played in this process by Kruppel-associated box (KRAB)-associated protein 1 (KAP1), the universal cofactor of KRAB-zinc finger proteins (ZFPs), a tetrapod-restricted family of transcriptional repressors. T-cell-specific Kap1-deleted mice displayed a significant expansion of immature thymocytes, imbalances in CD4(+)/CD8(+) cell ratios, and altered responses to TCR and TGFβ stimulation when compared to littermate KAP1 control mice. Transcriptome and chromatin studies revealed that KAP1 binds T-cell-specific cis-acting regulatory elements marked by the H3K9me3 repressive mark and enriched in Ikaros/NuRD complexes. Also, KAP1 directly controls the expression of several genes involved in TCR and cytokine signaling. Among these, regulation of FoxO1 seems to play a major role in this system. Likely responsible for tethering KAP1 to at least part of its genomic targets, a small number of KRAB-ZFPs are selectively expressed in T-lymphoid cells. These results reveal the so far unsuspected yet important role of KAP1-mediated epigenetic regulation in T-lymphocyte differentiation and activation.
Ikaros family zinc finger 1, encoded by IKZF1, are lymphoid-restricted zinc finger transcription factors that share common N-terminal Kruppel-like zinc finger DNA-binding domain. IKZF1 play multiple important roles on regulators of lymphocyte differentiation and hematological tumor suppressor. Our genome-wide association (GWA) studies in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) independently identified genetic variants in IKZF1 associated with SLE, which are supported by other studies. Previous studies found that lower expression of IKZF1 may play critical roles in activating some signal pathways involved in SLE, such as signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT)4 and interferon pathways. In addition, IKZF1 has been implicated in roles involved in some hematologic traits or abnormalities, such as erythrocyte measures, myelofibrosis, and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), which may be common clinical manifestations or co-occurrence hematological diseases of patients with SLE. All these findings suggest that IKZF1 may play a critical role in the pathogenesis of SLE. In this article, we discuss the existing understanding of the role of IKZF1 on the physiological and pathological functions associated with SLE, providing insights that may assist in the development of new therapeutic strategies based on IKZF1 for patients with SLE.
Regulatory T (Treg) cells, driven by the Foxp3 transcription factor, are responsible for limiting autoimmunity and chronic inflammation. We showed that a well-characterized Foxp3(gfp) reporter mouse, which expresses an N-terminal GFP-Foxp3 fusion protein, is a hypomorph that causes profoundly accelerated autoimmune diabetes on a NOD background. Although natural Treg cell development and in vitro function are not markedly altered in Foxp3(gfp) NOD and C57BL/6 mice, Treg cell function in inflammatory environments was perturbed and TGF-β-induced Treg cell development was reduced. Foxp3(gfp) was unable to interact with the histone acetyltransferase Tip60, the histone deacetylase HDAC7, and the Ikaros family zinc finger 4, Eos, which led to reduced Foxp3 acetylation and enhanced K48-linked polyubiquitylation. Collectively this results in an altered transcriptional landscape and reduced Foxp3-mediated gene repression, notably at the hallmark IL-2 promoter. Loss of controlled Foxp3-driven epigenetic modification leads to Treg cell insufficiency that enables autoimmunity in susceptible environments.
Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic heterogeneous autoimmune disorder characterized by the loss of tolerance to self-antigens and dysregulated interferon responses. The etiology of SLE is complex, involving both heritable and environmental factors. Candidate-gene studies and genome-wide association (GWA) scans have been successful in identifying new loci that contribute to disease susceptibility; however, much of the heritable risk has yet to be identified. In this study, we sought to replicate 1,580 variants showing suggestive association with SLE in a previously published GWA scan of European Americans; we tested a multiethnic population consisting of 7,998 SLE cases and 7,492 controls of European, African American, Asian, Hispanic, Gullah, and Amerindian ancestry to find association with the disease. Several genes relevant to immunological pathways showed association with SLE. Three loci exceeded the genome-wide significance threshold: interferon regulatory factor 8 (IRF8; rs11644034; p(meta-Euro) = 2.08 × 10(-10)), transmembrane protein 39A (TMEM39A; rs1132200; p(meta-all) = 8.62 × 10(-9)), and 17q21 (rs1453560; p(meta-all) = 3.48 × 10(-10)) between IKAROS family of zinc finger 3 (AIOLOS; IKZF3) and zona pellucida binding protein 2 (ZPBP2). Fine mapping, resequencing, imputation, and haplotype analysis of IRF8 indicated that three independent effects tagged by rs8046526, rs450443, and rs4843869, respectively, were required for risk in individuals of European ancestry. Eleven additional replicated effects (5 × 10(-8) &lt; p(meta-Euro) &lt; 9.99 × 10(-5)) were observed with CFHR1, CADM2, LOC730109/IL12A, LPP, LOC63920, SLU7, ADAMTSL1, C10orf64, OR8D4, FAM19A2, and STXBP6. The results of this study increase the number of confirmed SLE risk loci and identify others warranting further investigation.
In a genome-wide association study, genetic variants on chromosome 17q21 were strongly associated with childhood asthma and orosomucoid 1-like 3 (ORMDL3) gene expression. Regulation of the 17q21 locus and its immunologic relevance early in life have not been well characterized.
We investigated the relation between polymorphisms and mRNA expression of 17q21 locus genes and their influence on T-cell subsets in cord blood.
In 200 children of our cord blood study, 17q21 polymorphisms were genotyped by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Gene expression was assessed for ORMDL3; gasdermin A (GSDMA, alias GSDM1); gasdermin B (GSDMB, alias GSDML); Ikaros family zinc finger 3 (ZNFN1A3), zona pellucida binding protein 2 (ZPBP2); and proteasome (prosome, macropain) 26S subunit, non-ATPase, 3 (PSMD3), in cord blood mononuclear cells (CBMCs) and for ORMDL3 in peripheral blood (real-time RT-PCR). Mononuclear cells were assessed before and after microbial (lipid A/peptidoglycan), phytohemagglutinin, or allergen (Der p 1) stimulation. Regulatory T-associated markers (forkhead box protein 3, glucocorticoid-induced TNF receptor, lymphocyte activation gene 3 mRNA expression) and T(h)2/T(h)1/T(h)17 cytokines were examined.
In CBMCs, single genetic risk variants within 17q21 were associated with increased ORMDL3 (Der p 1 stimulation; P ≤ .01) and GSDMA expression (phytohemagglutinin/Der p 1 stimulation; P ≤ .05). Children homozygous for all 4 risk alleles for 17q21 tagging single nucleotide polymorphisms showed increased expression for ORMDL3 (Der p 1; P = .002) and GSDMA (phytohemagglutinin; P = .0009/Der p 1; P = .004). CBMC ORMDL3 expression was lower compared with PBMCs (P ≤ .0003) and increased in both CBMC and PBMC after stimulation (phytohemagglutinin/lipid A/peptidoglycan/Der p 1; P ≤ .006 and phytohemagglutinin/peptidoglycan; P &lt; .05, respectively). No correlation between 17q21 polymorphisms and regulatory T/T(h)2/T(h)1 lineages was detectable. However, 17q21 risk allele carriers showed significantly increased IL-17 secretion (unstimulated, phytohemagglutinin-stimulated).
Our results suggest an association of 17q21 polymorphisms with ORMDL3, GSDMA expression, and IL-17 secretion early in life. These observations may imply a functional role of the 17q21 locus affecting T-cell development during immune maturation.
Philadelphia chromosome-negative myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) are clonal myeloid disorders with increased production of terminally differentiated cells. The disease course is generally chronic, but some patients show disease progression (secondary myelofibrosis or accelerated phase) and/or leukemic transformation. We investigated chromosomal aberrations in 408 MPN samples using high-resolution single-nucleotide polymorphism microarrays to identify disease-associated somatic lesions. Of 408 samples, 37.5% had a wild-type karyotype and 62.5% harbored at least 1 chromosomal aberration. We identified 25 recurrent aberrations that were found in 3 or more samples. An increased number of chromosomal lesions was significantly associated with patient age, as well as with disease progression and leukemic transformation, but no association was observed with MPN subtypes, Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) mutational status, or disease duration. Aberrations of chromosomes 1q and 9p were positively associated with disease progression to secondary myelofibrosis or accelerated phase. Changes of chromosomes 1q, 7q, 5q, 6p, 7p, 19q, 22q, and 3q were positively associated with post-MPN acute myeloid leukemia. We mapped commonly affected regions to single target genes on chromosomes 3p (forkhead box P1 [FOXP1]), 4q (tet oncogene family member 2 [TET2]), 7p (IKAROS family zinc finger 1 [IKZF1]), 7q (cut-like homeobox 1 [CUX1]), 12p (ets variant 6 [ETV6]), and 21q (runt-related transcription factor 1 [RUNX1]). Our data provide insight into the genetic complexity of MPNs and implicate new genes involved in disease progression.
The transcription factor Ikaros family consists of five zinc-finger proteins: Ikaros, Aiolos, Helios, Eos and Pegasus; these proteins except Pegasus are essential for development and differentiation of lymphocytes. However, in B lymphocytes, the physiological role of Helios remains to be elucidated yet, because its expression level is very low. Here, we generated the Helios-deficient DT40 cells, Helios (-/-), and showed that the Helios-deficiency caused significant increases in transcriptions of four protein kinase Cs (PKCs); PKC-δ, PKC-ε, PKC-η and PKC-ζ, whereas their expressions were drastically down-regulated in the Aiolos-deficient DT40 cells, Aiolos (-/-). In addition, Helios (-/-) was remarkably resistant against phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA)/ionomycin treatment, which mimics the B cell receptor (BCR)-mediated stimulation. In the presence of PMA/ionomycin, their viability was remarkably higher than that of DT40, and their DNA fragmentation was less severe than that of DT40 in the opposite manner for the Aiolos-deficiency. The resistance against the PMA/ionomycin-induced apoptosis of Helios (-/-) was sensitive to Rottlerin but not to Go6976. In addition, the Helios-deficiency caused remarkable up-regulation of the Rottlerin-sensitive superoxide (O2 (-))-generating activity. These data suggest that Helios may contribute to the regulation of the BCR-mediated apoptosis and O2 (-)-generating activity, via transcriptional regulation of these four PKCs (especially PKC-δ) in immature B lymphocytes. Together with previous data, our findings may significantly help in the understanding of the B lymphocyte-specific expressions of PKC genes and molecular mechanisms of both the BCR-mediated apoptosis involved in negative selection and the O2 (-)-generating system in immature B lymphocytes. 
Ikaros, an important transcription factor plays a role in the development of hemato-lymphoid system, yet its functional importance in fish macrophages remains unknown. In this study, an Ikaros cDNA was cloned from the half-smooth tongue sole Cynoglossus semilaevis. The cDNA contained an open reading frame of 1,290 nucleotides that encoded a 430 amino acid protein. The deduced protein is structurally similar to dul from other species, for example human, axolotl, and possesses 3-zinc finger and 2-zinc finger domains at its N- and C-termini, respectively. Phylogenetic analysis revealed C. semilaevis Ikaros to be grouped with all the fish Ikaros, but branching from other Ikaros family members. Both semi-quantitative PCR and quantitative real-time PCR indicated Ikaros to be predominantly expressed in the immune-relevant tissues such as kidney, thymus, spleen and liver. In the macrophages cultured from C. semilaevis head kidney and challenged with lipopolysaccharide and lipoteichoic acid not only induced expression of the proinflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin 1-beta but also caused up-regulation of Ikaros in a dose- and time-dependent fashions. All these data suggest that Ikaros might be a useful marker for inflammatory responses in C. semilaevis.
Ikaros is a member of the Kruppel family of zinc finger DNA-binding proteins. The Ikaros protein contains two separate regions of zinc-finger domains: 4 DNA-binding zinc fingers near the N-terminus and 2 zinc fingers for protein-protein interactions near the C-terminus. Here, we identified the Ikaros gene from 14 vertebrate genomes and found Ikaros existed in all kinds of vertebrate including fish, amphibians, birds and mammals. Moreover, except rat and Xenopus tropicalis Ikaros proteins, which lack the first C2H2-type 1 Zinc finger region, all identified Ikaros proteins contain six C2H2-type 1 Zinc finger regions. We found human Ikaros gene showed a predominant expression in the liver, lymph node, thymus, intestine, lung, mammary gland, bone marrow, brain, heart, placenta and prostate. Moreover, four available SNPs disrupted an existing exonic splicing enhancer were identified in Ikaros. Besides the reported acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), the expression of Ikaros was related to the prognosis of 13 cases of cancers including blood cancers, breast, lung, ovarian and skin cancer. Moreover, the relationship between the expression of Ikaros and prognosis varied in different cancers, even in the same cancer from different database. Two tumor-related transcriptional factor (c-Fos and Elk-1) binding sites were identified within the 1.5-kb regions upstream of the transcriptional start site of human Ikaros, which may be involved in the effect of Ikaros in tumors.
Alopecia areata (AA) is among the most highly prevalent human autoimmune diseases, leading to disfiguring hair loss due to the collapse of immune privilege of the hair follicle and subsequent autoimmune attack. The genetic basis of AA is largely unknown. We undertook a genome-wide association study (GWAS) in a sample of 1,054 cases and 3,278 controls and identified 139 single nucleotide polymorphisms that are significantly associated with AA (P &lt;or= 5 x 10(-7)). Here we show an association with genomic regions containing several genes controlling the activation and proliferation of regulatory T cells (T(reg) cells), cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA4), interleukin (IL)-2/IL-21, IL-2 receptor A (IL-2RA; CD25) and Eos (also known as Ikaros family zinc finger 4; IKZF4), as well as the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) region. We also find association evidence for regions containing genes expressed in the hair follicle itself (PRDX5 and STX17). A region of strong association resides within the ULBP (cytomegalovirus UL16-binding protein) gene cluster on chromosome 6q25.1, encoding activating ligands of the natural killer cell receptor NKG2D that have not previously been implicated in an autoimmune disease. By probing the role of ULBP3 in disease pathogenesis, we also show that its expression in lesional scalp from patients with AA is markedly upregulated in the hair follicle dermal sheath during active disease. This study provides evidence for the involvement of both innate and acquired immunity in the pathogenesis of AA. We have defined the genetic underpinnings of AA, placing it within the context of shared pathways among autoimmune diseases, and implicating a novel disease mechanism, the upregulation of ULBP ligands, in triggering autoimmunity.
Myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) originate from genetically transformed hematopoietic stem cells that retain the capacity for multilineage differentiation and effective myelopoiesis. Beginning in early 2005, a number of novel mutations involving Janus kinase 2 (JAK2), Myeloproliferative Leukemia Virus (MPL), TET oncogene family member 2 (TET2), Additional Sex Combs-Like 1 (ASXL1), Casitas B-lineage lymphoma proto-oncogene (CBL), Isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) and IKAROS family zinc finger 1 (IKZF1) have been described in BCR-ABL1-negative MPNs. However, none of these mutations were MPN specific, displayed mutual exclusivity or could be traced back to a common ancestral clone. JAK2 and MPL mutations appear to exert a phenotype-modifying effect and are distinctly associated with polycythemia vera, essential thrombocythemia and primary myelofibrosis; the corresponding mutational frequencies are approximately 99, 55 and 65% for JAK2 and 0, 3 and 10% for MPL mutations. The incidence of TET2, ASXL1, CBL, IDH or IKZF1 mutations in these disorders ranges from 0 to 17%; these latter mutations are more common in chronic (TET2, ASXL1, CBL) or juvenile (CBL) myelomonocytic leukemias, mastocytosis (TET2), myelodysplastic syndromes (TET2, ASXL1) and secondary acute myeloid leukemia, including blast-phase MPN (IDH, ASXL1, IKZF1). The functional consequences of MPN-associated mutations include unregulated JAK-STAT (Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription) signaling, epigenetic modulation of transcription and abnormal accumulation of oncoproteins. However, it is not clear as to whether and how these abnormalities contribute to disease initiation, clonal evolution or blastic transformation.
Here we provide evidence for a C2H2 zinc finger gene family with similarity to Ikaros and hunchback. The founding member of this family is Caenorhabditis elegans ehn-3, which has important and poorly understood functions in somatic gonad development. We examined the expression and function of four additional hunchback/Ikaros-like (HIL) genes in C. elegans reproductive system development. Two genes, ehn-3 and R08E3.4, are expressed in somatic gonadal precursors (SGPs) and have overlapping functions in their development. In ehn-3; R08E3.4 double mutants, we find defects in the generation of distal tip cells, anchor cells, and spermatheca; three of the five tissues derived from the SGPs. We provide in vivo evidence that C. elegans HIL proteins have functionally distinct zinc finger domains, with specificity residing in the N-terminal set of four zinc fingers and a likely protein-protein interaction domain provided by the C-terminal pair of zinc fingers. In addition, we find that a chimeric human Ikaros protein containing the N-terminal zinc fingers of EHN-3 functions in C. elegans. Together, these results lend support to the idea that the C. elegans HIL genes and Ikaros have similar functional domains. We propose that hunchback, Ikaros, and the HIL genes arose from a common ancestor that was present prior to the divergence of protostomes and deuterostomes.
We characterized intrinsic and extrinsic specification of progenitors in the lateral and medial ganglionic eminences (LGE and MGE). We identified seven genes whose expression is enriched or restricted in either the LGE [biregional cell adhesion molecule-related/downregulated by oncogenes binding protein (Boc), Frizzled homolog 8 (Fzd8), Ankrd43 (ankyrin repeat domain-containing protein 43), and Ikzf1 (Ikaros family zinc finger 1)] or MGE [Map3k12 binding inhibitory protein 1 (Mbip); zinc-finger, SWIM domain containing 5 (Zswim5); and Adamts5 [a disintegrin-like and metallopeptidase (reprolysin type) with thrombospondin type 1 motif, 5]]. Boc, Fzd8, Mbip, and Zswim5 are apparently expressed in LGE or MGE progenitors, whereas the remaining three are seen in the postmitotic mantle zone. Relative expression levels are altered and regional distinctions are lost for each gene in LGE or MGE cells propagated as neurospheres, indicating that these newly identified molecular characteristics of LGE or MGE progenitors depend on forebrain signals not available in the neurosphere assay. Analyses of Pax6(Sey/Sey), Shh(-/-), and Gli3(XtJ/XtJ) mutants suggests that LGE and MGE progenitor identity does not rely exclusively on previously established forebrain-intrinsic patterning mechanisms. Among a limited number of additional potential patterning mechanisms, we found that extrinsic signals from the frontonasal mesenchyme are essential for Shh- and Fgf8-dependent regulation of LGE and MGE genes. Thus, extrinsic and intrinsic forebrain patterning mechanisms cooperate to establish LGE and MGE progenitor identity, and presumably their capacities to generate distinct classes of neuronal progeny.
The Ikaros (Ik) family of transcription factors has critical functions in immune regulation, lymphohematopoiesis and the hypothalamic-pituitary axis. Ik influences cell fate decisions through transcriptional activation of target genes and its interaction with chromatin remodeling complexes. While Ik is well-described in the lymphoid system and pituitary, its presence and function in the brain has received limited attention to date. This study describes the transient spatio-temporal expression of Ik in striatal medium spiny neurons of the developing murine CNS. To determine the impact of Ik deficiency, standardized behavioral tests were performed. In the elevated plus-maze and contextual fear conditioning tests, homozygous Ik-deficient mice performed similarly to wild-type or heterozygote mice. However, significant differences were observed in Ik-null mice in several behavioral tests. Pinch-induced catalepsy was markedly extended. In the Porsolt forced swim test, Ik-null mice showed reduced immobility, consistent with an anti-depressive effect. The acoustic startle response of Ik-null mice was also markedly diminished. Our findings extend the role of the Ikaros zinc-finger protein to the maturation and differentiation of striatal medium spiny neurons and indicate important actions for Ik in the development of neurocognitive functions and affecting depressive behaviors.
Transcription factors MITF and PU.1 collaborate to increase expression of target genes like cathepsin K (Ctsk) and acid phosphatase 5 (Acp5) during osteoclast differentiation. We show that these factors can also repress transcription of target genes in committed myeloid precursors capable of forming either macrophages or osteoclasts. The direct interaction of MITF and PU.1 with the zinc finger protein Eos, an Ikaros family member, was necessary for repression of Ctsk and Acp5. Eos formed a complex with MITF and PU.1 at target gene promoters and suppressed transcription through recruitment of corepressors CtBP (C-terminal binding protein) and Sin3A, but during osteoclast differentiation, Eos association with Ctsk and Acp5 promoters was significantly decreased. Subsequently, MITF and PU.1 recruited coactivators to these target genes, resulting in robust expression of target genes. Overexpression of Eos in bone marrow-derived precursors disrupted osteoclast differentiation and selectively repressed transcription of MITF/PU.1 targets, while small interfering RNA knockdown of Eos resulted in increased basal expression of Ctsk and Acp5. This work provides a mechanism to account for the modulation of MITF and PU.1 activity in committed myeloid progenitors prior to the initiation of osteoclast differentiation in response to the appropriate extracellular signals.
In an earlier report, we demonstrated overexpression of a short isoform of Helios, Hel-5, which lacks three of four N-terminal zinc fingers, in patients with adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma. Here, we characterized Hel-5 using immunoprecipitation, and gel shift and luciferase promoter assays, and found that Hel-5 lacks the repressor function observed with a full-length isoform of Helios. Moreover, Hel-5 associates with the full-length isoforms of the Ikaros gene family, Ikaros, Aiolos and Helios, and inhibits their DNA binding activity when present in excess, leading to dominant-negative effects on the full-length isoforms of the Ikaros gene family. Our results suggest a critical role for Helios in the mechanism of leukemogenesis.
The Ikaros transcription factors perform critical functions in the control of lymphohematopoiesis and immune regulation. Family members contain multiple zinc fingers that mediate DNA binding but have also been implicated as part of a complex chromatin-remodeling network. We show here that Ikaros is expressed in pituitary mammosomatotrophs where it regulates the GH and prolactin (PRL) genes. Ikaros was detected by Northern and Western blotting in GH4 pituitary mammosomatotroph cells. Wild-type Ikaros (Ik1) inhibits GH mRNA and protein expression but stimulates PRL mRNA and protein levels. Ikaros does not bind directly to the proximal GH promoter but abrogates the effect of the histone deacetylation inhibitor trichostatin A on this region. Ikaros selectively deacetylates histone 3 residues on the proximal transfected or endogenous GH promoter and limits access of the Pit1 activator. In contrast, Ikaros acetylates histone 3 on the proximal PRL promoter and facilitates Pit1 binding to this region in the same cells. These data provide evidence for Ikaros-mediated histone acetylation and chromatin remodeling in the selective regulation of pituitary GH and PRL hormone gene expression.
The oligomerization domain that is present at the C terminus of Ikaros-family proteins and the protein Trps-1 is important for the proper regulation of developmental processes such as hematopoiesis. Remarkably, this domain is predicted to contain two classical zinc fingers (ZnFs), domains normally associated with the recognition of nucleic acids. The preference for protein binding by these predicted ZnFs is not well-understood. We have used a range of methods to gain insight into the structure of this domain. Circular dichroism, UV-vis, and NMR experiments carried out on the C-terminal domain of Eos (EosC) revealed that the two putative ZnFs (C1 and C2) are separable, i.e., capable of folding independently in the presence of Zn(II). We next determined the structure of EosC2 using NMR spectroscopy, revealing that, although the overall fold of EosC2 is similar to other classical ZnFs, a number of differences exist. For example, the conformation of the C terminus of EosC2 appears to be flexible and may result in a major rearrangement of the zinc ligands. Finally, alanine-scanning mutagenesis was used to identify the residues that are involved in the homo- and hetero-oligomerization of Eos, and these results are discussed in the context of the structure of EosC. These studies provide the first structural insights into how EosC mediates protein-protein interactions and contributes to our understanding of why it does not exhibit high-affinity DNA binding.
Greig cephalopolysyndactyly (GCPS; OMIM 175700) is an autosomal dominant condition caused by mutations of the gene GLI3, located on 7p13. To date, several cases of deletions and/or translocations involving this locus have been reported in patients with GCPS. GLI3 is a transcription factor from the GLI-Kruppel gene family that has been implicated in three distinct entities: GCPS, Pallister-Hall syndrome, and postaxial polydactyly type A. The zinc finger protein, subfamily 1, member 1 gene (ZNFN1A1; OMIM 603023), on 7p12, codes for a lymphoid-restricted zinc finger transcription factor, ZNFN1A1, also called IKAROS, that regulates lymphocyte differentiation and has been associated with the development of childhood leukemia. We present the case of a 9-year-old Latin-American boy who was referred for stem cell transplantation because of recurrent acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). On evaluation, he was found to have dysmorphic features consistent with GCPS, including a prominent forehead, down-slanting palpebral fissures, 1-2-3 toe syndactyly, broad thumbs and first toes, and mild developmental delay. He had developed ALL at 5 years of age. Chromosome analysis of bone marrow and fibroblastic cells showed an interstitial deletion of chromosome arm 7p, del(7)(p11.2p14), in 74% and 44% of the cells, respectively. We performed FISH analysis with a BAC clone containing the ZNFN1A1 gene and demonstrated that it is contained in the deleted segment. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a patient with GCPS and leukemia. We hypothesize that constitutional deletion of the ZNFN1A1 gene in this patient may have resulted in an increased risk of lymphoid malignancy.
The C2H2 zinc finger is the most prevalent protein motif in the mammalian proteome. Two C2H2 fingers in Ikaros are dedicated to homotypic interactions between family members. We show here that these fingers comprise a bona fide dimerization domain. Dimerization is highly selective, however, as homologous domains from the TRPS-1 and Drosophila Hunchback proteins support homodimerization, but not heterodimerization with Ikaros. Ikaros-Hunchback selectivity is determined by 11 residues concentrated within the alpha-helical regions typically involved in base recognition. Preferential homodimerization of one chimeric protein predicts a parallel dimer interface and establishes the feasibility of creating novel dimer specificities. These results demonstrate that the C2H2 motif provides a versatile platform for both sequence-specific protein-nucleic acid interactions and highly specific dimerization.
Ikaros family members are important regulatory factors in lymphocyte development. Here we show that Ikaros may play an important role in CD4 versus CD8 lineage commitment decisions by demonstrating: (1) that it binds to regulatory elements in the endogenous CD8alpha locus in vivo using thymocyte chromatin immunoprecipitations, (2) that Ikaros suppresses position effect variegation of transgenes driven by CD8 regulatory elements, and (3) that mice with reduced levels of Ikaros and Aiolos show an apparent increase in CD4 populations with immature phenotype, i.e., cells that failed to activate the CD8alpha gene locus. We propose that Ikaros family members function as activators of the CD8alpha gene locus and that their associated activities are critical for appropriate chromatin remodeling transitions during thymocyte differentiation and lineage commitment.
The purpose of the present study was to characterize the human Helios gene products expressed in leukemia cells. A 3.5 kb human Helios cDNA clone was isolated from a human T-cell cDNA library derived from the human T-acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cell line JURKAT. This cDNA clone had a unique open reading frame (ORF) encoding a novel 304 amino acid (AA) peptide, which was designated as Helios 3. The sequence of the 289 AA C-terminal portion of Helios 3 downstream of V-16 is identical to the corresponding sequence found in Helios 1 and 2 and contains two zinc fingers. By contrast, the 15 AA N-terminal portion of Helios 3 is unique and does not contain the N-terminal zinc finger motifs that are conserved in Helios 1 and 2 as well as other previously identified members of the Ikaros family. Southern blot analysis of genomic DNA fragments of the human Helios gene locus showed that Helios 3 is encoded by the same genomic locus as Helios 1 and 2. The expression of Helios 3 mRNA was not restricted to T-lineage ALL cells or another immunophenotypically distinct subset of leukemias. Helios 3 mRNA was expressed in freshly obtained primary leukemic cells from six of 15 children with newly diagnosed ALL. Helios 3 exhibited a unique protein interaction profile via its N-terminal portion, which may have biological significance in pathogenesis of human leukemias.
The Ikaros gene encodes a family of transcription factors which plays a crucial role in hematopoiesis. To improve our knowledge about the immune system of Pleurodeles waltl, we sequenced the cDNA coding for the Ik-1 isoform of that salamander and analyzed its tissue expression by semi-quantitative RT-PCR. Ikaros transcripts are abundant in the thymus and the spleen, thereby confirming that these organs are, respectively, the primary and secondary lymphoid tissues of Pleurodeles. Analysis of the isoforms produced by this animal revealed two isoforms characteristic of amphibians in which an alternative internal splicing site deletes the 3' half of exon 3 which interestingly comprises the first Zn finger of Ikaros. Ikaros transcripts were found at the earliest stages of development of Pleurodeles indicating that Ikaros has a function at the very early lymphopoietic stages. Moreover, the presence of Ikaros transcripts in spermatozoa suggests that this protein could have another and yet unknown function.
Ikaros is a key regulator of the hemo-lymphoid system in which it is presumed to function by both potentiating and repressing gene expression. Repression is mediated through two independent domains at the N and C terminus of the protein, both of which can independently recruit the corepressors Mi-2beta, Sin3A, and Sin3B and the Class I histone deacetylases 1 and 2; the N-terminal domain can also associate with the corepressor CtBP. Here we describe a detailed dissection of these two domains and identify the minimal repression modules and the corepressor requirements for their activity. Based on these studies, we describe mutations in a full-length Ikaros protein that abrogate interactions with each of the identified corepressors and abolish the protein's function as a repressor. Finally, we show that, barring CtBP, the Ikaros family members Aiolos, Helios, and Eos can associate with all of the identified corepressors of Ikaros including its newly identified interactors, Class II HDACs.
The zinc-finger protein Ikaros plays an important role in lymphoid homeostasis, and loss of Ikaros expression through germline disruption impairs lymphoid development. However, the role played by Ikaros after commitment to the T-cell lineage is unclear. To address this question, this study used the lck proximal promoter to drive the expression in T-cell progenitors of a naturally occurring short Ikaros isoform (IK5), which lacks the DNA-binding domain, reasoning that IK5 will form heterodimers with long isoforms and perturb their function. The IK5 transgene led to a selective and dramatic decrease in extrathymic intestinal intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs) and natural killer 1.1+ T (NK T) cells with little effect on conventional alphabeta T cells, which resembles the T-cell phenotype of interleukin-15 receptor alpha chain (IL-15Ralpha) and IL-2/IL-15 receptor beta chain (IL-2Rbeta) knockout mice. The expression of IL-2Rbeta on double-negative T-cell progenitors of bi-5 was reduced, but enforced expression of IL-2Rbeta did not rescue IELs or NK T cells in bi-5 transgenic mice, suggesting that Ikaros or Ikaros family members regulate the expression of additional genes that are essential for the development of IELs and NK T cells. The study concludes that modest changes in the ratio of short to long Ikaros isoforms can substantially perturb T-cell development, and the development of IELs and NK T cells is particularly sensitive to such changes.
Human Tid-1, the human homologue of the Drosophila tumor suppressor lethal (2) tumorous imaginal discs, l(2) tid gene product, is a member of the DNAJ family of proteins which serve as co-chaperones to Hsp70 proteins. Here we report the cloning and characterization of the genomic structure of the human TID1 gene (hTID1), which is located on chromosome 16p13.3. hTID1 is approximately 34 kb and is composed of 12 exons. Exon sizes vary from 64 to 232 nucleotides, with the exception of exon 12 corresponding to the 3' untranslated region of hTID1, which extends over 1.1 kb. S1 nuclease protection assays and primer extension experiments indicate a putative transcriptional start site 21 nucleotides upstream of the initiating methionine. The presumptive promoter is characterized by the lack of TATA and CAAT motifs, and a high G+C content. The 5' flanking region contains several consensus binding sites for transcription factors that regulate gene expression during tissue and organ development, such as myeloid zinc finger (MZF1), Ikaros 2 and homeodomain proteins, as well as factors implicated in cell growth and survival responses, including AP-1, PEA3, E2F and NF-kB. Three alternatively spliced variants of hTID1 are expressed in a tissue and cell-type specific manner in many of the human tissues examined. The existence of these forms needs to be considered in efforts aimed at identifying mutations in the hTID1 gene.
Members of the Ikaros multigene family of zinc finger proteins are expressed in a tissue-specific manner and most are critical determinants in the development of both the B and T lymphocytes as well as NK and dendritic APC lineages. A PCR amplification strategy that is based on regions of shared sequence identity in Ikaros multigene family members found in mammals and several other vertebrates has led to the recovery of cDNAs that represent the orthologues of Ikaros, Aiolos, Helios, and Eos in Raja eglanteria (clearnose skate), a cartilaginous fish that is representative of an early divergence event in the phylogenetic diversification of the vertebrates. The tissue-specific patterns of expression for at least two of the four Ikaros family members in skate resemble the patterns observed in mammals, i.e., in hematopoietic tissues. Prominent expression of Ikaros in skate also is found in the lymphoid Leydig organ and epigonal tissues, which are unique to cartilaginous fish. An Ikaros-related gene has been identified in Petromyzon marinus (sea lamprey), a jawless vertebrate species, in which neither Ig nor TCRs have been identified. In addition to establishing a high degree of evolutionary conservation of the Ikaros multigene family from cartilaginous fish through mammals, these studies define a possible link between factors that regulate the differentiation of immune-type cells in the jawed vertebrates and related factors of unknown function in jawless vertebrates.
We identified a novel member of the Ikaros gene family, which has critical roles in the development of lymphoid lineages. This gene, which we named Eos, was expressed predominantly in the developing central and peripheral nervous system. Eos protein could interact with itself and Ikaros protein through its C-terminal portion in the yeast two hybrid assay. These findings suggested that Eos may have important roles in neural development similarly to the Ikaros family in the development of hemolymphoid tissue.
We previously described the lymphocyte-restricted Ikaros gene encoding a zinc finger DNA-binding protein as a potential regulator of lymphocyte commitment and differentiation. Here, we report the isolation of four additional Ikaros transcripts, products of alternate splicing that encode functionally diverse proteins. The Ikaros proteins contain unique combinations of zinc finger modules that dictate their overall sequence specificity and affinity. The Ik-1 and Ik-2 proteins can both bind, albeit with different affinities, to the same recognition sequences present in a number of lymphocyte-specific regulatory elements. The Ik-3 and the Ik-4 proteins interact only with a subset of these motifs. The Ik-1 and Ik-2 proteins can strongly stimulate transcription, whereas Ik-3 and Ik-4 are weak activators. Significantly, the transcription activation potential of the Ikaros proteins correlates with their subcellular localization. Upon ectopic expression of the Ikaros isoforms in nonlymphoid cells, Ik-1 and Ik-2 localize to the nucleus, whereas Ik-3 and Ik-4 are predominantly found in the cytoplasm. The Ikaros isoforms are expressed differentially in lymphocytes: Ik-1 and Ik-2 mRNAs are the predominating forms, and Ik-4 is present in significant amounts only in early T-cell progenitors, whereas Ik-3 and Ik-5 transcripts are expressed at relatively low levels throughout lymphocyte development. The ability of the Ikaros gene to generate functionally diverse proteins that may participate in distinct regulatory pathways substantiates its role as a master regulator during lymphocyte development.
The IKAROS family zinc finger 1 (IKZF1) gene is frequently altered in adults with B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Although many studies have indicated that IKZF1 alterations might be associated with poor outcomes in adults with ALL, the results remain controversial. A previous meta-analysis demonstrated the negative prognostic significance of IKZF1 deletion in ALL. However, most of the included studies (14 out of 15) were conducted in pediatric patients with ALL, and age was identified as a significant source of heterogeneity. Thus, performing the present meta-analysis provides valuable information to further elucidate the prognostic value of IKZF1 deletion in adults with ALL. Eight studies were identified that had been published prior to August 1, 2016. The studies included a total of 1008 patients. Hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS)/relapse-free survival (RFS)/progression-free survival (PFS)/event-free survival (EFS) were pooled to estimate the prognostic power of IKZF1 deletion. Pooled HRs suggested that IKZF1 deletion had a negative impact on both OS (HR = 1.40, 95% CI 1.13-1.73) and DFS/RFS/PFS/EFS (HR = 1.67, 95% CI 1.28-2.17) in the overall population. Subgroup analyses indicated that IKZF1 deletion could independently predict unfavorable OS (HR = 1.60, 95% CI 1.25-2.06) and DFS/RFS/PFS/EFS (HR = 1.67, 95% CI 1.28-2.17) in BCR-ABL1-negative but not in BCR-ABL1-positive B cell ALL patients. Our meta-analysis suggests that IKZF1 deletion is a poor prognostic factor for adults with B cell ALL and may be more valuable in BCR-ABL1-negative B cell ALL patients.
Polymorphisms of IKAROS family zinc finger 1 (IKZF1) have been found to be associated with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) by genome-wide association studies (GWAS). The aim of the current study was to investigate the association between IKZF1 functional variants and lupus nephritis (LN) in a northern Han Chinese population and analyse their relationship with clinical and pathological phenotypes in LN.
The association between IKZF1 functional variants and LN was analysed for the lead variant rs1456896 with both GWAS and expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) top hits in 500 LN patients and 500 healthy controls. Replication was conducted in an independent cohort comprising 798 LN patients and 704 healthy controls. Using the ENCODE (Encyclopedia of DNA Elements) databases, functional annotations and differential gene expression data were evaluated.
A significant association between the single nuclear polymorphism (SNP) rs1456896 and susceptibility to LN was observed in the two different cohorts (p = 9.32 × 10-3 and p = 3.00 × 10-2) and reinforced in combination (p = 1.36 × 10-3). In silico analysis indicates that rs1456896 is a regulatory variant and lower mRNA expressions of IKZF1 were observed in both peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and renal biopsies from SLE patients compared to normal controls. Although patients with the protective genotype AA of rs1456896 seemed to have more pronounced clinical manifestations and a lower ratio of histological classes III and IV, no significant associations between rs1456896 genotypes and sub-phenotypes of LN were detected.
Our results suggest that the rs1456896 A allele is associated with protective susceptibility to LN. However, this association did not seem to be implicated in the disease and histopathological severity of LN in the current population.
Despite the high response rates of individuals with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) with deletion of chromosome 5q (del(5q)) to treatment with lenalidomide (LEN) and the recent identification of cereblon (CRBN) as the molecular target of LEN, the cellular mechanism by which LEN eliminates MDS clones remains elusive. Here we performed an RNA interference screen to delineate gene regulatory networks that mediate LEN responsiveness in an MDS cell line, MDSL. We identified GPR68, which encodes a G-protein-coupled receptor that has been implicated in calcium metabolism, as the top candidate gene for modulating sensitivity to LEN. LEN induced GPR68 expression via IKAROS family zinc finger 1 (IKZF1), resulting in increased cytosolic calcium levels and activation of a calcium-dependent calpain, CAPN1, which were requisite steps for induction of apoptosis in MDS cells and in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells. In contrast, deletion of GPR68 or inhibition of calcium and calpain activation suppressed LEN-induced cytotoxicity. Moreover, expression of calpastatin (CAST), an endogenous CAPN1 inhibitor that is encoded by a gene (CAST) deleted in del(5q) MDS, correlated with LEN responsiveness in patients with del(5q) MDS. Depletion of CAST restored responsiveness of LEN-resistant non-del(5q) MDS cells and AML cells, providing an explanation for the superior responses of patients with del(5q) MDS to LEN treatment. Our study describes a cellular mechanism by which LEN, acting through CRBN and IKZF1, has cytotoxic effects in MDS and AML that depend on a calcium- and calpain-dependent pathway.
To identify ikaros family zinc finger1 (IKZF1) deletion in patients with pediatric B cells-acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) without reproducible chromosomal abnomalities and further investigate its value in this part of patients' pathogenesis and prognosis.
The study was approved by the institutional review board of the authors' hospital and informed consent was obtained from the patients and/or their legal guardians. Data of 96 children with B-ALL patients without reproducible cytogenetic abnormalities whose bone marrows specimens were enough for DNA extraction for the detection were retrospectively selected. All the patients were diagnosed and systematically treated according to CCLG-ALL2008 in our hospital from April 2008 to April 2013. The 96 patients were divided into two groups according to the result of IKZF1's detection by multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA): The cases that with any of eight exons of IKZF1 deleted were entered into"Group with IKZF1 deletion"otherwise entered"Group without IKZF1 deletion". Disease free survival (DFS), event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) were compared between the two groups.
Nineteen out of 96 B-ALL patients without reproducible cytogenetic abnormalities had IKZF1 deletion (20%). Three of 19 patients with IKZF1 deletions of the whole gene; ten of 19 patients with IKZF1 deletions of exon 1; 4 of 19 patients with IKZF1 deletions of exons 4-7; one of 19 patients with IKZF1 deletions of exons 2-7 and one of 19 patients with IKZF1 deletions of exons 1-6. Whose white blood cell (WBC) ≥ 50 × 10(9)/L inIKZF1 diletion group was more than whthout IKZF1 deletion group(42% vs. 13%, P=0.004). Patients with IKZF1 deletions had a lower 3-year DFS (0.67 ± 0.13 vs. 0.93 ± 0.04, P=0.001); EFS (0.67 ± 0.13 vs. 0.90 ± 0.04, P = 0.012) and OS(0.79 ± 0.09 vs. 0.96 ± 0.02, P=0.010) compared to those without IKZF1 deletions. Excluding the influence of sex, age, WBC count at diagnosis, cerebrospinal fluid state and prednisone response IKZF1 deletion still affected the patients' DFS, EFS and OS ( P&lt;0.05 for all comparisons).
Some of pediatric B-cell precursor ALL without reproducible cytogenetic abnormalities had been detected to have IKZF1 deletion; IKZF1 deletion is an independent poor prognostic factor in these patients.
Myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) are clonal disorders characterized by increased production of mature blood cells. Philadelphia chromosome-negative MPNs (Ph-MPNs) consist of polycythemia vera (PV), essential thrombocythemia (ET), and primary myelofibrosis (PMF). A number of stem cell derived mutations have been identified in the past 10 years. These findings showed that JAK2V617F, as a diagnostic marker involving JAK2 exon 14 with a high frequency, is the best molecular characterization of Ph-MPNs. Somatic mutations in an endoplasmic reticulum chaperone, named calreticulin (CALR), is the second most common mutation in patients with ET and PMF after JAK2 V617F mutation. Discovery of CALR mutations led to the increased molecular diagnostic of ET and PMF up to 90%. It has been shown that JAK2V617F is not the unique event in disease pathogenesis. Some other genes' location such as TET oncogene family member 2 (TET2), additional sex combs-like 1 (ASXL1), casitas B-lineage lymphoma proto-oncogene (CBL), isocitrate dehydrogenase 1/2 (IDH1/IDH2), IKAROS family zinc finger 1 (IKZF1), DNA methyltransferase 3A (DNMT3A), suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS), enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2), tumor protein p53 (TP53), runt-related transcription factor 1 (RUNX1) and high mobility group AT-hook 2 (HMGA2) have also identified to be involved in MPNs phenotypes. Here, current molecular biology and genetic mechanisms involved in MNPs with a focus on the aforementioned factors is presented. 
Some copy number alterations (CNAs) have independent prognostic significance for adults with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).
This study analyzed via multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification the frequency and prognostic impact of CNAs of 12 genetic regions in 142 adolescents and adults with de novo precursor B-cell ALL.
The cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A/B (CDKN2A/B) deletion (59 of 142 or 42%) was the most frequent CNA, and it was followed by Ikaros family zinc finger 1 (IKZF1) losses (49 of 142 or 35%). IKZF1 deletions were more prevalent in Philadelphia chromosome (Ph)-positive ALL and were associated with advanced age and high white blood cell (WBC) counts. The multivariate analysis showed that advanced age and early B-cell factor 1 (EBF1) deletions were associated with chemotherapy resistance in both the whole series (hazard ratios, 0.949 and 0.135, respectively) and the Ph-negative subgroup (hazard ratios, 0.946 and 0.118, respectively). High WBC counts and focal IKZF1 deletions correlated with disease recurrence (hazard ratios, 1.005 and 1.869, respectively), whereas advanced age and CDKN2A/B losses influenced overall survival in both the whole series (hazard ratios, 1.038 and 2.545, respectively) and the Ph-negative subgroup (hazard ratios, 1.044 and 2.105, respectively).
Deletions of EBF1, IKZF1, and CDKN2A/B have an independent adverse prognosis for adolescents and adults with B-precursor ALL, and this suggests that these CNAs should be included in the initial risk assessment of ALL.
IKAROS family zinc finger 1/IKZF1 is a transcription factor important in lymphoid differentiation, and a known tumor suppressor in acute lymphoid leukemia. Recent studies suggest that IKZF1 is also involved in myeloid differentiation. To investigate whether IKZF1 deletions also play a role in pediatric acute myeloid leukemia, we screened a panel of pediatric acute myeloid leukemia samples for deletions of the IKZF1 locus using multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification and for mutations using direct sequencing. Three patients were identified with a single amino acid variant without change of IKZF1 length. No frame-shift mutations were found. Out of 11 patients with an IKZF1 deletion, 8 samples revealed a complete loss of chromosome 7, and 3 cases a focal deletion of 0.1-0.9Mb. These deletions included the complete IKZF1 gene (n=2) or exons 1-4 (n=1), all leading to a loss of IKZF1 function. Interestingly, differentially expressed genes in monosomy 7 cases (n=8) when compared to non-deleted samples (n=247) significantly correlated with gene expression changes in focal IKZF1-deleted cases (n=3). Genes with increased expression included genes involved in myeloid cell self-renewal and cell cycle, and a significant portion of GATA target genes and GATA factors. Together, these results suggest that loss of IKZF1 is recurrent in pediatric acute myeloid leukemia and might be a determinant of oncogenesis in acute myeloid leukemia with monosomy 7. 
EPAS1 involves in the hypoxic response and is suggested to be responsible for the genetic adaptation of high-altitude hypoxia in Tibetans. However, the detailed molecular mechanism remains unknown. In this study, a single nucleotide polymorphism rs56721780:G&gt;C and an insertion/deletion (indel) polymorphism -742 indel in the promoter region showed divergence between Tibetans and non-Tibetan lowlanders. rs56721780:G&gt;C regulated the transcription of EPAS1 by IKAROS family zinc finger 1 (IKZF1), which was identified as a new transcriptional repressor for EPAS1 gene. It demonstrated that the C allele of rs56721780:G&gt;C decreased the binding of IKZF1, leading to the attenuated transcriptional repression of EPAS1 gene. The insertion at -742 indel provided a new binding site for Sp1 and was related to the activation of EPAS1 promoter. Further functional analysis revealed that lysyl oxidase (LOX) gene, which was reported to be responsible for extracellular matrix protein cross-linking of amnion previously, was a direct target of EPAS1. The CC genotype at rs56721780:G&gt;C and the insertion genotype at -742 indel were found associated with higher EPAS1 and LOX expression levels in amnion, as well as higher birth weight of Tibetan newborns, suggesting that EPAS1 gene might play important roles in the development of amnion, fetus growth and high-altitude adaptation of Tibetans. 
Lenalidomide has demonstrated clinical activity in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), even though it is not cytotoxic for primary CLL cells in vitro. We examined the direct effect of lenalidomide on CLL-cell proliferation induced by CD154-expressing accessory cells in media containing interleukin-4 and -10. Treatment with lenalidomide significantly inhibited CLL-cell proliferation, an effect that was associated with the p53-independent upregulation of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, p21(WAF1/Cip1) (p21). Silencing p21 with small interfering RNA impaired the capacity of lenalidomide to inhibit CLL-cell proliferation. Silencing cereblon, a known molecular target of lenalidomide, impaired the capacity of lenalidomide to induce expression of p21, inhibit CD154-induced CLL-cell proliferation, or enhance the degradation of Ikaros family zinc finger proteins 1 and 3. We isolated CLL cells from the blood of patients before and after short-term treatment with low-dose lenalidomide (5 mg per day) and found the leukemia cells were also induced to express p21 in vivo. These results indicate that lenalidomide can directly inhibit proliferation of CLL cells in a cereblon/p21-dependent but p53-independent manner, at concentrations achievable in vivo, potentially contributing to the capacity of this drug to inhibit disease-progression in patients with CLL. 
Change in transcription start site (TSS) usage is an important mechanism for the control of transcription process, and has a significant effect on the isoforms being transcribed. One of the goals in the study of TSS is the understanding of how and why their usage differs in different tissues or under different conditions. In light of recent efforts in the mapping of transcription start site landscape using high-throughput sequencing approaches, a quantitative and automated method is needed to process all the data that are being produced. In this work we propose a statistical approach that will classify changes in TSS distribution between different samples into several categories of changes that may have biological significance. Genes selected by the classifiers can then be analyzed together with additional supporting data to determine their biological significance. We use a set of time-course TSS data from mouse dendritic cells stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to demonstrate the usefulness of our method. 
Thalidomide-like drugs such as lenalidomide are clinically important treatments for multiple myeloma and show promise for other B cell malignancies. The biochemical mechanisms underlying their antitumor activity are unknown. Thalidomide was recently shown to bind to, and inhibit, the cereblon ubiquitin ligase. Cereblon loss in zebrafish causes fin defects reminiscent of the limb defects seen in children exposed to thalidomide in utero. Here we show that lenalidomide-bound cereblon acquires the ability to target for proteasomal degradation two specific B cell transcription factors, Ikaros family zinc finger proteins 1 and 3 (IKZF1 and IKZF3). Analysis of myeloma cell lines revealed that loss of IKZF1 and IKZF3 is both necessary and sufficient for lenalidomide's therapeutic effect, suggesting that the antitumor and teratogenic activities of thalidomide-like drugs are dissociable. 
The Ikaros gene (Ikzf1) encodes a family of zinc-finger transcription factors implicated in hematopoietic cell differentiation. Here we show that Ikaros suppresses the development of basophils, which are proinflammatory cells of the myeloid lineage. In the absence of extrinsic basophil-inducing signals, Ikaros(-/-) (Ik(-/-)) mice exhibit increases in basophil numbers in blood and bone marrow and in their direct precursors in bone marrow and the spleen, as well as decreased numbers of intestinal mast cells. In vitro culture of Ik(-/-) bone marrow under mast cell differentiation conditions also results in predominance of basophils. Basophil expansion is associated with an increase in basophil progenitors, increased expression of Cebpa and decreased expression of mast cell-specifying genes Hes1 and microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (Mitf). Ikaros directly associates with regulatory sites within Cebpa and Hes1 and regulates the acquisition of permissive H3K4 tri-methylation marks at the Cebpa locus and reduces H3K4 tri-methylation at the Hes1 promoter. Ikaros blockade in cultured cells or transfer of Ik(-/-) bone marrow into irradiated Ik(+/+) recipients also results in increased basophils confirming a cell-intrinsic effect of Ikaros on basophil development. We conclude that Ikaros is a suppressor of basophil differentiation under steady-state conditions and that it acts by regulating permissive chromatin modifications of Cebpa. 
Genetic alterations of Ikaros family zinc finger protein 1 (IKZF1), point mutations in Janus kinase 2 (JAK2), and overexpression of cytokine receptor-like factor 2 (CRLF2) were recently reported to be associated with poor outcomes in pediatric B-cell precursor (BCP)-ALL. Herein, we conducted genetic analyses of IKZF1 deletion, point mutation of JAK2 exon 16, 17, and 21, CRLF2 expression, the presence of P2RY8-CRLF2 fusion and F232C mutation in CRLF2 in 202 pediatric BCP-ALL patients newly diagnosed and registered in Japan Childhood Leukemia Study ALL02 protocol to find out if alterations in these genes are determinants of poor outcome. All patients showed good response to initial prednisolone (PSL) treatment. Ph⁺, infantile, and Down syndrome-associated ALL were excluded. Deletion of IKZF1 occurred in 19/202 patients (9.4%) and CRLF2 overexpression occurred in 16/107 (15.0%), which are similar to previous reports. Patients with IKZF1 deletion had reduced event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) compared to those in patients without IKZF1 deletion (5-year EFS, 62.7% vs. 88.8%, 5-year OS, 71.8% vs. 90.2%). Our data also showed significantly inferior 5-year EFS (48.6% vs. 84.7%, log rank P = 0.0003) and 5-year OS (62.3% vs. 85.4%, log rank P = 0.009) in NCI-HR patients (n = 97). JAK2 mutations and P2RY8-CRLF2 fusion were rarely detected. IKZF1 deletion was identified as adverse prognostic factor even in pediatric BCP-ALL in NCI-HR showing good response to PSL.
Members of the Ikaros family of zinc-finger transcription factors have been shown to be critical for immune and blood cell development. However, the role of the most divergent family member, Pegasus, has remained elusive, although it shows conservation to invertebrate Hunchback proteins that influence embryonic patterning through regulation of homeodomain genes. Zebrafish was employed as a relevant model to investigate the function of Pegasus since it possesses a single pegasus orthologue with high homology to its mammalian counterparts. During zebrafish embryogenesis pegasus transcripts were initially maternally-derived and later replaced by zygotic expression in the diencephalon, tectum, hindbrain, thymus, eye, and ultimately the exocrine pancreas and intestine. Morpholino-mediated knockdown of the zebrafish pegasus gene resulted in disrupted left-right asymmetry of the gut and pancreas. Molecular analysis indicated that zebrafish Pegasus localised to the nucleus in discrete non-nucleolar structures and bound the 'atypical' DNA sequence GN3GN2G, confirming its presumed role as a transcriptional regulator. In vivo transcriptome analysis identified candidate target genes, several of which encoded homeodomain transcription factors. One of these, pitx2, implicated in left-right asymmetry, possessed appropriate 'atypical' Pegasus binding sites in its promoter. Knockdown of Pegasus affected both the level and asymmetry of pitx2 expression, as well as disrupting the asymmetry of the lefty2 and spaw genes, explaining the perturbed left-right patterning in pegasus morphants. Collectively these results provide the first definitive insights into the in vivo role of Pegasus, supporting the notion that it acts as a broader regulator of development, with potential parallels to the related invertebrate Hunchback proteins.
The clinical outcome of children with high-risk relapsed B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (BCP-ALL) is poor. The present study assessed the utility and prognostic value of selected microRNA (miRNA/miR) in BCP-ALL. The changes in the expression levels of these miRNAs regarding known gene lesions affecting lymphoid development [early B-cell factor 1 (EBF1), ETS variant 6 (ETV6), IKAROS family zinc finger 1 (IKZF1), paired box 5 (PAX5), cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor (CDKN) 2A/CDKN2B, retinoblastoma 1 (RB1), pseudoautosomal region 1 (PAR1), B-cell translocation gene 1 protein (BTG1)] were analyzed. The following miRNAs were analyzed: miR-24, miR-31, miR-128, miR-542, and miR-708. The present study focused on patients with deletions of the IKAROS transcriptional factor gene IKZF1, which is currently considered to be an independent negative prognostic factor for ALL outcome. It was demonstrated that the expression level of miR-128 was significantly lower in patients with IKZF1 deletion compared with patients without IKZF1 deletion. Additionally, low expression of miR-542 was associated with CDKN2A/B and miR-31deletions, and low expression of miR-24 was associated with miR-31 deletion. Low expression of miR-31, miR-24, miR-708 and miR-128 was associated with PAX5 deletion, high expression of miR-24 and miR-542 was associated with PAR1 deletion and high expression of miR-708 was associated with ETV6 deletion. The expression of the selected miRNAs was not associated with deletions of BTG1, EBF1 and RB1. These data, by emphasizing the association of miRNAs expression level with microdeletions, may assist to elucidate ALL biology and contribute to future studies on the possible applications of the miRNA profile for diagnosis.
The mechanism of the anti-myeloma effect of the immunomodulatory drug lenalidomide relies upon the binding of lenalidomide or an analogue to cereblon (CRBN) ubiquitin ligase, which inhibits it and results in the degradation of Ikaros-family zinc finger proteins 1 and 3 (IKZF1 and IKZF3). To determine whether the traditional Chinese medicine arsenic trioxide, could potentiate sensitivity of multiple myeloma (MM) cells to lenalidomide and identify the mechanism by which this happens, the present study investigated how arsenic trioxide affected CRBN on MM cell lines and examined the anti-myeloma effect and mechanism in the combination of arsenic trioxide and lenalidomide. The present study revealed that arsenic trioxide upregulates the transcription and protein levels of CRBN, the anti-myeloma target of lenalidomide, thus potentiating the sensitivity of multiple myeloma cells to lenalidomide and enhancing the lenalidomide-dependent degradation of IKZF1 and IKZF3. The results of the present study indicate that clinical trials of this combination therapy could take place within the near future, with the aim of improving MM patient outcome.
Neuregulin-1 (NRG-1) includes an extracellular epidermal growth factor-like domain and an intracellular domain (NRG-1-ICD). In response to transforming growth factor-β1, its cleavage by proteolytic enzymes releases a bioactive fragment, which suppresses the vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) proliferation by activating ErbB (erythroblastic leukemia viral oncogene homolog) receptor. However, NRG-1-ICD function in VSMCs remains unknown.
Here, we characterize the function of NRG-1-ICD and underlying mechanisms in VSMCs.
Immunofluorescence staining, Western blotting, and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction showed that NRG-1 was expressed in rat, mouse, and human VSMCs and was upregulated and cleaved in response to transforming growth factor-β1. In the cytoplasm of HASMCs (human aortic smooth muscle cells), the NRG-1-ICD participated in filamentous actin formation by interacting with α-SMA (smooth muscle α-actin). In the nucleus, the Nrg-1-ICD induced circular ACTA2 (alpha-actin-2; circACTA2) formation by recruitment of the zinc-finger transcription factor IKZF1 (IKAROS family zinc finger 1) to the first intron of α-SMA gene. We further confirmed that circACTA2, acting as a sponge binding microRNA (miR)-548f-5p, interacted with miR-548f-5p targeting 3' untranslated region of α-SMA mRNA, which in turn relieves miR-548f-5p repression of the α-SMA expression and thus upregulates α-SMA expression, thereby facilitating stress fiber formation and cell contraction in HASMCs. Accordingly, in vivo studies demonstrated that the localization of the interaction of circACTA2 with miR-548f-5p is significantly decreased in human intimal hyperplastic arteries compared with normal arteries, implicating that dysregulation of circACTA2 and miR-548f-5p expression is involved in intimal hyperplasia.
These results suggest that circACTA2 mediates NRG-1-ICD regulation of α-SMA expression in HASMCs via the NRG-1-ICD/circACTA2/miR-548f-5p axis. Our data provide a molecular basis for fine-tuning α-SMA expression and VSMC contraction by transcription factor, circular RNA, and microRNA.
Primary Sjögren's syndrome (pSS) is a systematic autoimmune disease with evidence of genetic predisposition. The IKZF1 (IKAROS family zinc finger 1 (Ikaros)) gene is located at 7p12.2, encodes a transcription factor related to chromatin remodeling, regulates lymphocyte differentiation, and has been reported to be associated with some autoimmune diseases. However, there have been no reports of an association between IKZF1 and pSS. To investigate the possibility of an association between the IKZF1 locus and pSS, we selected two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the IKZF1 locus, rs4917129 and rs4917014, based on a detailed analysis of genome-wide association study (GWAS) data and performed genotyping in 665 Han Chinese pSS patients and 863 healthy controls. The results of an association test showed significant association signals (rs4917129: P-value = 5.5e-4, OR (odds ratio) = 0.72, 95% CI (confidence interval) = 0.60-0.87; rs4917014: P-value = 1.2e-3, OR = 0.76, 95% CI = 0.64-0.89). A meta-analysis that combined the above results with data from previous GWAS, further confirmed these associations (rs4917129: Pmeta = 4.24e-8, ORmeta = 0.70, 95% CI = 0.61-0.79; rs4917014: Pmeta = 6.0e-8, ORmeta = 0.72, 95% CI = 0.64-0.81). A bioinformatics analysis indicated that both SNPs were located in a putative enhancer area in immune-related cell lines and tissues. A protein-protein interaction analysis found that IKZF1, together with GTF2I (an SS susceptibility gene newly identified through GWAS), could interact with histone deacetylase family proteins. In summary, this is the first study to report an association between IKZF1 and SS in Han Chinese.
Glutamine synthetase (GS) plays an essential role in metabolism by catalyzing the synthesis of glutamine from glutamate and ammonia. Our recent study showed that CRBN, a direct protein target for the teratogenic and antitumor activities of immunomodulatory drugs such as thalidomide, lenalidomide, and pomalidomide, recognizes an acetyl degron of GS, resulting in ubiquitylation and degradation of GS in response to glutamine. Here, we report that valosin-containing protein (VCP)/p97 promotes the degradation of ubiquitylated GS, resulting in its accumulation in cells with compromised p97 function. Notably, p97 is also required for the degradation of all four known CRBN neo-substrates [Ikaros family zinc finger proteins 1 (IKZF1) and 3 (IKZF3), casein kinase 1α (CK1α), and the translation termination factor GSPT1] whose ubiquitylation is induced by immunomodulatory drugs. Together, these data point to an unexpectedly intimate relationship between the E3 ubiquitin ligase CRL4CRBN and p97 pathways.
Chromosomal region 17q12-q21 is associated with asthma and harbors regulatory polymorphisms that influence expression levels of all five protein-coding genes in the region: IKAROS family zinc finger 3 (Aiolos) (IKZF3), zona pellucida binding protein 2 (ZPBP2), ORMDL sphingolipid biosynthesis regulator 3 (ORMDL3), and gasdermins A and B (GSDMA, GSDMB). Furthermore, DNA methylation in this region has been implicated as a potential modifier of the genetic risk of asthma development. To further characterize the effect of DNA methylation, we examined the impact of treatment with DNA methyltransferase inhibitor 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-aza-dC) that causes DNA demethylation, on expression and promoter methylation of the five 17q12-q21 genes in the human airway epithelium cell line NuLi-1, embryonic kidney epithelium cell line 293T and human adenocarcinoma cell line MCF-7. 5-aza-dC treatment led to upregulation of expression of GSDMA in all three cell lines. ZPBP2 was upregulated in NuLi-1, but remained repressed in 293T and MCF-7 cells, whereas ORMDL3 was upregulated in 293T and MCF-7 cells, but not NuLi-1. Upregulation of ZPBP2 and GSDMA was accompanied by a decrease in promoter methylation. Moreover, 5-aza-dC treatment modified allelic expression of ZPBP2 and ORMDL3 suggesting that different alleles may respond differently to treatment. We also identified a polymorphic CTCF-binding site in intron 1 of ORMDL3 carrying a CG SNP rs4065275 and determined its methylation level. The site's methylation was unaffected by 5-aza-dC treatment in NuLi-1 cells. We conclude that modest changes (8-13%) in promoter methylation levels of ZPBP2 and GSDMA may cause substantial changes in RNA levels and that allelic expression of ZPBP2 and ORMDL3 is mediated by DNA methylation.
Dmrt1 (doublesex and mab-3 related transcription factor (1) is a regulator of testis development in vertebrates that has been implicated in testicular germ cell tumors of mouse and human. In the fetal mouse testis Dmrt1 regulates germ cell pluripotency in a strain-dependent manner. Loss of Dmrt1 in 129Sv strain mice results in a &gt;90% incidence of testicular teratomas, tumors consisting cells of multiple germ layers; by contrast, these tumors have never been observed in Dmrt1 mutants of C57BL/6J (B6) or mixed genetic backgrounds. To further investigate the interaction between Dmrt1 and genetic background we compared mRNA expression in wild type and Dmrt1 mutant fetal testes of 129Sv and B6 mice at embryonic day 15.5 (E15.5), prior to overt tumorigenesis. Loss of Dmrt1 caused misexpression of overlapping but distinct sets of mRNAs in the two strains. The mRNAs that were selectively affected included some that changed expression only in one strain or the other and some that changed in both strains but to a greater degree in one versus the other. In particular, loss of Dmrt1 in 129Sv testes caused a more severe failure to silence regulators of pluripotency than in B6 testes. A number of genes misregulated in 129Sv mutant testes also are misregulated in human testicular germ cell tumors (TGCTs), suggesting similar etiology between germ cell tumors in mouse and man. Expression profiling showed that DMRT1 also regulates pluripotency genes in the fetal ovary, although Dmrt1 mutant females do not develop teratomas. Pathway analysis indicated disruption of several signaling pathways in Dmrt1 mutant fetal testes, including Nodal, Notch, and GDNF. We used a Nanos3-cre knock-in allele to perform conditional gene targeting, testing the GDNF coreceptors Gfra1 and Ret for effects on teratoma susceptibility. Conditional deletion of Gfra1 but not Ret in fetal germ cells of animals outcrossed to 129Sv caused a modest but significant elevation in tumor incidence. Despite some variability in genetic background in these crosses, this result is consistent with previous genetic mapping of teratoma susceptibility loci to the region containing Gfra1. Using Nanos3-cre we also uncovered a strong genetic interaction between Dmrt1 and Nanos3, suggesting parallel functions for these two genes in fetal germ cells. Finally, we used chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP-seq) analysis to identify a number of potentially direct DMRT1 targets. This analysis suggested that DMRT1 controls pluripotency via transcriptional repression of Esrrb, Nr5a2/Lrh1, and Sox2. Given the strong evidence for involvement of DMRT1 in human TGCT, the downstream genes and pathways identified in this study provide potentially useful candidates for roles in the human disease.
To identify biologically relevant groupings or clusters of nuclear receptors (NR) that are associated with breast neoplasia, with potentially diagnostic, discriminant or prognostic value, we quantitated mRNA expression levels of all 48 members of the human NR superfamily by TaqMan low-density array analysis in 116 curated breast tissue samples, including pre- and postmenopausal normal breast and both ERα(+) and ERα(-) tumor tissue. In addition, we have determined NR levels in independent cohorts of tamoxifen-treated ERα(+) and ERα(-) tissue samples. There were differences in relative NR mRNA expression between neoplastic and normal breast, and between ER(+) and ER(-) tumors. First, there is overexpression of the NUR77 subgroup and EAR2 in neoplastic breast. Second, we identify a signature of five NR (ERα, EAR2, NUR77, TRα, and RARγ) that classifies breast samples with more than 97% cross-validated accuracy into normal or cancer classes. Third, we find a novel negative association between five NR (TRβ, NUR77, RORγ, COUP-TFII, and LRH1) and histological grade. Finally, four NR (COUP-TFII, TRβ, PPARγ, and MR) are significant predictors of metastasis-free survival in tamoxifen-treated breast cancers, independent of ER expression. The present study highlights the discriminant and prognostic value of NR in breast cancer; identifies novel, clinically relevant, NR signatures; and highlights NR signaling pathways with potential roles in breast cancer pathophysiology and as new therapeutic targets.
NR5A2 (Liver receptor homologue-1; LRH1) belongs to the four-member NR5A, or Ftz-F1,
subfamily V of nuclear receptors. Murine LRH1 was originally identified due to its
sequence homology to Drosophila Fushi tarazu factor-1. Orthologs were subsequently
identified in other species including rat, chicken, horse, zebrafish and human.
LRH1, and its closest family member steroidogenic factor-1 (SF-1, NR5A1), bind to
identical DNA consensus sequences (response elements; REs) and both are able to bind
phospholipids in their ligand binding domains (LBDs). LRH1 was shown to regulate
expression of Cyp19 (aromatase), suggesting LRH1 as a target for inverse agonists
for the treatment of ER-positive breast cancers. Interestingly, recently it was
shown that LRH1 promotes motility and invasiveness in both ER-positive and
ER-negative breast cancer cells (MDA-MB-231), with remodeling of the actin
cytoskeleton and E-cadherin processing observed with LRH1 over-expression. These
findings suggest that inhibition of LRH1 activity should be useful in attenuating
both migration and invasion in ER-positive and ER-negative breast cancers. In
addition to LRH1’s role in cholesterol metabolism and bile acid homeostasis,
the receptor can impact expression of markers of acute phase response (APR) to
tissue injury. Thus, we endeavored to identify potent and selective LRH1 inverse
agonists which may provide new approaches for the treatment of cancer and to blunt
APR. We pursued a Center-based Initiative with transfection studies testing the
ability of various chemical scaffolds to inhibit LRH-1-mediated activation of the
Cyp19-Aromatase-luciferase and the StAR-luciferase reporter, followed by
counterscreening against SF-1 and VP16, as well as studies examining the effect of
compounds on LRH-1 modulation of the APR markers haptoglobin and serum amyloid A1
and A4 (SAA1 and SAA4). Combined, the studies led to identification of two novel
LRH-1 inverse agonist probe compounds ML179 (PubChem CID 45100448)
and ML180 (PubChem CID 3238389) with potent activity in breast cancer
cells. In reporter assays ML179 and ML180 had potency
IC50 values of 320nM and 3.7 μM and maximum efficacy of
40% and 64% repression, respectively. It is unclear at this stage if
maximum repression is more important than potency; thus two probes were declared
that differ from each other in terms of potency and efficacy. Further optimization
is focused on improving both potency and efficacy. Also, it is likely that the
selectivity of these probe compounds versus SF1 is cell context-and
promoter-dependent. The mechanism of action of these probes will require much more
detailed studies which are currently underway.
Kaposi sarcoma, the most common cancer in HIV-positive individuals, is caused by endothelial transformation mediated by the Kaposi sarcoma herpes virus (KSHV)-encoded G-protein-coupled receptor (vGPCR). Infection of blood vascular endothelial cells (BEC) by KSHV reactivates an otherwise silenced embryonic program of lymphatic differentiation. Thus, Kaposi sarcoma tumors express numerous lymphatic endothelial cell (LEC) signature genes. A key unanswered question is how lymphatic reprogramming by the virus promotes tumorigenesis leading to Kaposi sarcoma formation. In this study, we present evidence that this process creates an environment needed to license the oncogenic activity of vGPCR. We found that the G-protein regulator RGS4 is an inhibitor of vGPCR that is expressed in BECs, but not in LECs. RGS4 was downregulated by the master regulator of LEC differentiation PROX1, which is upregulated by KSHV and directs KSHV-induced lymphatic reprogramming. Moreover, we found that KSHV upregulates the nuclear receptor LRH1, which physically interacts with PROX1 and synergizes with it to mediate repression of RGS4 expression. Mechanistic investigations revealed that RGS4 reduced vGPCR-enhanced cell proliferation, migration, VEGF expression, and Akt activation and suppressed tumor formation induced by vGPCR. Our findings resolve long-standing questions about the pathologic impact of KSHV-induced reprogramming of host cell identity, and they offer biologic and mechanistic insights supporting the hypothesis that a lymphatic microenvironment is more favorable for Kaposi sarcoma tumorigenesis.
Liver receptor homolog 1 (LRH-1), an established regulator of cholesterol and bile acid homeostasis, has recently emerged as a potential drug target for liver disease. Although LRH-1 activation may protect the liver against diet-induced steatosis and insulin resistance, little is known about how LRH-1 controls hepatic glucose and fatty acid metabolism under physiological conditions. We therefore assessed the role of LRH-1 in hepatic intermediary metabolism. In mice with conditional deletion of Lrh1 in liver, analysis of hepatic glucose fluxes revealed reduced glucokinase (GCK) and glycogen synthase fluxes as compared with those of wild-type littermates. These changes were attributed to direct transcriptional regulation of Gck by LRH-1. Impaired glucokinase-mediated glucose phosphorylation in LRH-1-deficient livers was also associated with reduced glycogen synthesis, glycolysis, and de novo lipogenesis in response to acute and prolonged glucose exposure. Accordingly, hepatic carbohydrate response element-binding protein activity was reduced in these animals. Cumulatively, these data identify LRH-1 as a key regulatory component of the hepatic glucose-sensing system required for proper integration of postprandial glucose and lipid metabolism.
Multiple nuclear receptors, including hepatocyte nuclear factor 4α (HNF4α), retinoid X receptor α (RXRα) plus peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα), RXRα plus farnesoid X receptor α (FXRα), liver receptor homolog 1 (LRH1), and estrogen-related receptors (ERRs), have been shown to support efficient viral biosynthesis in nonhepatoma cells in the absence of additional liver-enriched transcription factors. Although HNF4α has been shown to be critical for the developmental expression of hepatitis B virus (HBV) biosynthesis in the liver, the relative importance of the various nuclear receptors capable of supporting viral transcription and replication in the adult in vivo has not been clearly established. To investigate the role of the nuclear receptor FXR and the corepressor small heterodimer partner (SHP) in viral biosynthesis in vivo, SHP-expressing and SHP-null HBV transgenic mice were fed a bile acid-supplemented diet. The increased FXR activity and SHP expression levels resulting from bile acid treatment did not greatly modulate HBV RNA and DNA synthesis. Therefore, FXR and SHP appear to play a limited role in modulating HBV biosynthesis, suggesting that alternative nuclear receptors are more critical determinants of viral transcription in the HBV transgenic mouse model of chronic viral infection. These observations suggest that hepatic bile acid levels or therapeutic agents targeting FXR may not greatly modulate viremia during natural infection.
