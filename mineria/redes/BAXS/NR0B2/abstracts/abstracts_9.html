genetic and environmental factors. Vitamin D has been hypothesized to lower the risk of breast cancer via the nuclear
vitamin D receptor (VDR). Genetic variants of these vitamin D metabolizing genes may alter the bioavailability of
vitamin D, and hence modulate the risk of breast cancer. Materials and Methods: The distribution of Fok1 VDR gene
(rs2228570) polymorphism and its association with breast cancer was analysed in a case–control study based on 125
breast cancer patients and 125 healthy females from North Indian population, using PCR-RFLP. An In silico exploration
of the probable mechanism of increased risk of breast cancer was performed to investigate the role of single nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNPs) in cancer susceptibility. Results: The Fok1 ff genotype was significantly associated with an
increased risk of breast cancer (p=0.001; χ2=13.09; OR=16.909; %95 CI=2.20 - 130.11). In silico analysis indicated
that SNPs may lead to a loss in affinity of VDR to calcitriol, and may also cause the impairment of normal interaction
of liganded VDR with its heterodimeric partner, the retinoid X receptor (RXR), at protein level, thereby affecting target
gene transcription. Conclusion: Breast cancer risk and pathogenesis in females can be influenced by SNPs. SNPs in
VDR may cause alterations in the major molecular actions of VDR, namely ligand binding, heterodimerization and
transactivation. VDRE binding and co-activator recruitment by VDR appear to be functionally inseparable events that
affect vitamin D-elicited gene transcription. This indicates that breast cancer risk and pathogenesis in females may be
influenced by SNPs.
Carbamazepine (CBZ), one of the most frequently detected pharmaceutical compounds in aquatic environments, has recently been shown to cause chronic toxicity and endocrine disruption in a variety of non-target aquatic organisms. However, neither the effects nor the specific mechanism of CBZ action on the molting of crustaceans is well understood. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of CBZ on the molting and growth of the Chinese mitten crab Eriocheir sinensis, a native and economically important species in China, and to elucidate the specific mechanisms through which molt inhibition occurs. Juvenile E. sinensis were treated with four nominal environmentally relevant concentrations (0.01, 0.1, 1, or 10 μg/L) of CBZ for acute (4 days) and chronic (40 days) exposures. After acute exposure, chitinase activity in the epidermis and 20-hydroxyecdysone (20-HE) concentration in the hemolymph were significantly decreased (p &lt; 0.05) following treatment with 10 μg/L CBZ, whereas epidermal chitobiase activity significantly decreased (p &lt; 0.05) in response to both 1 and 10 μg/L CBZ treatments. Transcript levels of the genes encoding crustacean hyperglycemic hormone (chh) and molt-inhibiting hormone (mih) in the eyestalks were also markedly induced after 1 or 10 μg/L CBZ treatment (p &lt;  0.05), whereas the expression of genes encoding ecdysone receptor (ecr) and crustacean retinoid X receptor (rxr) in the hepatopancreas were significantly suppressed (p &lt; 0.05) after acute exposure. Moreover, under chronic exposure, CBZ inhibited the molting and growth of E. sinensis, resulting in a longer time before molting was completed (TBM), as well as a lower molting increment (MI) with 1 or 10 μg/L treatment (p &lt; 0.05). Collectively, these data indicate that CBZ can inhibit the molting process of E. sinensis by interfering with the activity of chitinolytic enzymes and molting hormone signaling, suggestive that carbamazepine may have long-term effects on crab development. We also confirmed that CBZ may function as an endocrine disruptor in decapod crustaceans, a phenomenon that has previously been reported in vertebrates.
Vitamin D3 and its receptor are responsible for controlling energy expenditure in adipocytes and have direct roles in the transcriptional regulation of energy metabolic pathways. This phenomenon also has a significant impact on the etiology of prostate cancer (PCa). Using several in vitro models, the roles of vitamin D3 on energy metabolism and its implication in primary, early, and late invasive PCa were investigated. BODIPY staining and qPCR analyses show that 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25(OH)2D3) up-regulates de novo lipogenesis in PCa cells by orchestrating transcriptional regulation that affects cholesterol and lipid metabolic pathways. This lipogenic effect is highly dependent on the interaction of several nuclear receptors and their corresponding ligands, including androgen receptor (AR), vitamin D receptor (VDR), and retinoid X receptor (RXR). In contrast, inhibition of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARα) signaling blocks the induction of the lipogenic phenotype induced by these receptors. Furthermore, 1,25(OH)2D3, T, and 9 cis-retinoic acid (9-cis RA) together redirect cytosolic citrate metabolism toward fatty acid synthesis by restoring normal prostatic zinc homeostasis that functions to truncate TCA cycle metabolism. 1,25(OH)2D3, T, and 9-cis RA also exert additional control of TCA cycle metabolism by down-regulating SLC25A19, which limits the availability of the co-factor thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP) that is required for enzymatic catalyzation of citrate oxidation. This extensive metabolic reprogramming mediated by 1,25(OH)2D3, T, and 9-cis RA is preserved in all in vitro cell lines investigated. These data suggest that 1,25(OH)2D3 and T are important regulators of normal prostatic energy metabolism. Based on the close association between energy metabolism and cancer progression, supplementation of vitamin D3 and testosterone can restrict the energy production that is required to drive PCa progression by maintaining proper zinc homeostasis and inhibiting TCA cycle activity in PCa cells.
It is widely accepted that neuroinflammation in the spinal cord contribute to the development of central sensitization in neuropathic pain. MAPKs activation plays an vital role in the development of neuroinflammation in the spinal cord. In this study, we investigated the effect of bexarotene, a RXR agonist, on MAPKs activation in CCI-induced neuropathic pain. The data showed that daily treatment with bexarotene 50mg/kg significantly alleviated CCI-induced nociceptive hypersensitivity in rats. Bexarotene 50mg/kg/day inhibited CCI-induced MAPKs (p38MAPK, ERK1/2, and JNK) activation and upregulation of proinflammatory factors(IL-1β, TNF-α and IL-6). Bexarotene also reversed CCI-induced microglia activation in the ipsilateral spinal cord. Furthermore, bexarotene treatment significantly upregulated MKP-1 in the spinal cord. These effects were completely abrogated by MKP-1 inhibitor BCI. These results indicated that bexarotene relieved CCI-induced neuroinflammation and neuropathic pain by targeting MKP-1. Therefore, bexarotene might be a potential agent for the treatment of neuropathic pain.
Multidrug-resistant (MDR) Acinetobacter baumannii is a difficult pathogen due to its propensity to develop resistance to antibiotics. Antisense nucleic acid analogs have been proposed as a potential alternative anti-infective approach. We developed a peptide nucleic acid (PNA) compound that targets the essential Acinetobacter gene carA. The PNA oligomer was conjugated to the cell-penetrating peptide (RXR)4XB. In vitro testing of the PNA conjugate against four clinical strains of MDR-A. baumannii in minimal medium demonstrated that all four strains were inhibited at a concentration of 1.25 μM. In vivo testing of the PNA conjugate was done using a Galleria mellonella model of sepsis caused by one of the clinical strains. Preliminary testing of a variety of inocula demonstrated that an inoculum of 1 × 106 cfu was lethal to the majority of caterpillars by day 3, but not within 24 hours. The PNA compound was administered 30 minutes after an inoculum of 1 × 106 cfu at doses estimated to produce concentrations of ∼5 and 20 μM. The PNA compound had no effect at the lower dose. However, the higher dose reduced mortality from 5/28 (18%) to 0/28 (0%) at day 1 (p = 0.051) and from 19/28 (68%) to 9/28 (32%) at day 6 (p = 0.015). Antisense therapy is a novel approach to dealing with difficult MDR pathogens that could circumvent the problem of progressive resistance to available antibiotics. Further studies need to be done with additional strains and more complex in vivo model systems.
As a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily, the pregnane X receptor (PXR) is a ligand-activated transcription factor. PXR is highly expressed in liver and intestinal tissues, and also found in other tissues and organs, such as stomach and kidney. After heterodimerization with retinoid X receptor (RXR), PXR recruits numerous co-activating factors, and binds to specific DNA response elements to perform transcriptional regulation of the downstream target genes. As an acknowledged receptor for xenobiotics, PXR was initially considered as a nuclear receptor regulating drug metabolizing enzymes and transporters. However, nowadays, PXR has also been recognized as an important endobiotic receptor. Recent studies have shown that PXR activation can regulate glucose metabolism, lipid metabolism, steroid endocrine homeostasis, detoxification of cholic acid and bilirubin, bone mineral balance, and immune inflammation in vivo. This review focuses on the role of PXR in metabolism of endogenous substances.
The aim of this study was to investigate the regulatory role of retinoid X receptor (RXR)-mediated oxidative stress pathway in rat pulmonary ischemia/reperfusion injury (PIRI) and the underlying mechanism. Seventy-seven male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were randomly divided into 7 groups (n = 11): control group, sham group, sham+9-cis-retinoid acid (9-cRA, RXR agonist) group, sham+HX531 (RXR inhibitor) group, ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) group, I/R+9-cRA group, and I/R+HX531 group. The unilateral lung I/R model was established by obstruction of left lung hilus for 30 min and reperfusion for 180 min in vivo. The rats in I/R+9-cRA and I/R+HX531 groups were given intraperitoneal injection of 9-cRA and HX531 before thoracotomy. After reperfusion, the left lung tissue was taken to evaluate the lung tissue injury, and the oxidative stress-related indexes of the lung tissue were detected by the corresponding kits. The lung tissue morphology and the ultrastructure of the alveolar epithelial cells were observed by HE staining and transmission electron microscope, respectively. The protein expression of RXR in lung tissue was observed by immunofluorescence labeling method, and the expression level of nuclear factor E2-related factor (Nrf2) protein was detected by Western blot. The results showed that, compared with the sham group, the I/R group exhibited obviously injured lung tissue, decreased SOD activity, increased MDA content and MPO activity, and down-regulated expression level of Nrf2 protein. Compared with the I/R group, the I/R+9-cRA group showed alleviated lung tissue injury, increased activity of SOD, decreased MDA content and MPO activity, and up-regulated expression levels of RXR and Nrf2 protein. The above-mentioned improvement effects of 9-cRA were reversed by HX531 treatment. These results suggest that RXR activation can effectively protect the lung tissue against I/R injury, and the mechanism may involve the activation of Nrf2 signaling pathway, the enhancement of antioxidant level and the reduction of oxidative stress response.
Tributyltin (TBT), an organotin chemical used as a catalyst and biocide, can stimulate cholesterol efflux in non-steroidogenic cells. Since cholesterol is the first limiting step for sex hormone production, we hypothesized that TBT disrupts intracellular cholesterol transport and impairs steroidogenesis in ovarian theca cells. We investigated TBT's effect on cholesterol trafficking, luteinization, and steroidogenesis in theca cells of five species (human, sheep, cow, pig, and mice). Primary theca cells were exposed to an environmentally relevant dose of TBT (1 or 10 ng/ml) and/or retinoid X receptor (RXR) antagonist. The expression of RXRα in sheep theca cells was knocked down using shRNA. Steroidogenic enzymes, cholesterol transport factors, and nuclear receptors were measured by RT-qPCR and Western blotting, and intracellular cholesterol, progesterone, and testosterone secretion by ELISA. TBT upregulated StAR and ABCA1 in ovine cells, and SREBF1 mRNA in theca cells. TBT also reduced intracellular cholesterol and upregulated ABCA1 protein expression but did not alter testosterone or progesterone production. RXR antagonist and RXRα knockdown demonstrates that TBT's effect is partially through RXR. TBT's effect on ABCA1 and StAR expression was recapitulated in all five species. TBT, at an environmentally relevant dose, stimulates theca cell cholesterol extracellular efflux via the RXR pathway, triggers a compensatory upregulation of StAR that regulates cholesterol transfer into the mitochondria and SREBF1 for de novo cholesterol synthesis. Similar results were obtained in all five species evaluated (human, sheep, cow, pig, and mice) and are supportive of TBT's conserved mechanism of action across mammalian species.
To gain a greater understanding of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) we investigated the actions of all-trans-retinoic acid (RA; a retinoid), bexarotene (a pan-RXR agonist), and forkhead box (FOX) transcription factors in human OSCC-derived cell lines. RA and bexarotene have been shown to limit several oncogenic pathways in many cell types. FOXO proteins typically are associated with tumor suppressive activities, whereas FOXM1 acts as an oncogene when overexpressed in several cancers. RA and/or bexarotene increased the transcript levels of FOXO1, FOXO3A, and TRAIL receptors; reduced the transcript levels of FOXM1, Aurora kinase B (AURKB), and vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA); and decreased the proliferation of OSCC-derived cell lines. Also, RA and/or bexarotene influenced the recruitment of FOXO3A and FOXM1 to target genes. Additionally, FOXM1 depletion reduced cell proliferation, decreased transcript levels of downstream targets of FOXM1, and increased transcript levels of TRAIL receptors. Overexpression of FOXO3A decreased proliferation and increased binding of histone deacetylases (HDACs) 1 and 2 at the FOXM1, AURKB, and VEGFA promoters. This research suggests novel influences of the drugs RA and bexarotene on the expression of FOXM1 and FOXO3A in transcriptional regulatory pathways of human OSCC.
Retinoic acid (RA) regulates numerous aspects of central nervous system function through modulation of gene transcription via retinoic acid receptors (RARs). However, RA has important roles independent of gene transcription (non-genomic actions) and in the brain a crucial regulator of homeostatic plasticity is RAR control of glutamate receptor subunit 1 (GluR1) translation. An assay to quantify RAR regulation of GluR1 translation would be beneficial both to study the molecular components regulating this system and screen drugs that influence this critical mechanism for learning and memory in the brain. A bioluminescence reporter assay was developed that expresses firefly luciferase under the control of the GluR1 5' untranslated region bound by RAR. This assay was introduced into SH-SY5Y cells and used to demonstrate the role of RARα in RA regulation of GluR1 translation. A screen of synthetic RAR and RXR ligands indicated that only a subset of these ligands activated GluR1 translation. The results demonstrate the practicality of this assay to explore the contribution of RARα to this pathway and that the capacity of RAR ligands to activate translation is a quality restricted to a limited number of compounds, with implications for their RAR selectivity and potentially their specificity in drug use.

The farnesoid X receptor (FXR) is a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily of bile acid-activated transcription factors and an important regulator of cell proliferation, apoptosis, and Wnt signaling. Down-regulated expression of FXR plays an important role in some malignancies such as colon cancer, and in rodent models of intestinal neoplasia, FXR knockout increases the size and number of colon tumors. These previous observations implicate FXR as a tumor suppressor, but the underlying molecular mechanisms are unclear. Employing complementary experimental approaches and using human colon cancer specimens, human and murine colon cancer cell lines, and FXR transgenic mice, here we identified an additional, potentially important role for FXR. We observed an inverse relationship between the expression of FXR and matrix metalloproteinase-7 (MMP7), a collagenase and signaling molecule consistently associated with colon cancer progression. We noted that FXR gene ablation increases MMP7 expression. Consistent with this finding, FXR overexpression and a dominant-negative FXR mutation reduced and augmented, respectively, MMP7 expression. Of note, MMP7 was the only MMP gene family member whose expression was down-regulated after FXR activation. FXR-mediated regulation of MMP7 transcription did not require heterodimerization with the retinoid X receptor (RXR), indicating that FXR represses MMP7 expression independently of RXR. Lastly, we uncovered that FXR suppresses MMP7 transcription by binding to a negative FXR-responsive element in the 5' MMP7 promoter, an event that inhibited colon cancer cell proliferation and invasion. These findings identify the FXR-MMP7 axis as a potential therapeutic target for managing colon cancer.
The major challenge in treating cancers with ATRA is the limited availability inside the cell and resistance developed in prolonged treatment. We made an attempt for co-treatment of human NSCLC cell lines (A549) with ATRA and its isomeric precursor (9cisRA). In this study, the growth inhibitory effect of ATRA, 9cisRA and combination of both were tested in A549 cells by MTT and Trypan blue assays. As the effects of retinoid are mediated through their receptors, their gene expression levels were analyzed by RT-PCR. The target gene receptor, RAR-β protein expression, was analyzed by immunocytochemistry. The cancer cell (A549) growth inhibitory effect was significantly (p ≤ 0.001) enhanced in combination treatment when compared with the result of individual treatments. The mRNA expression levels of both RAR-β and RXR-β were found to be increased in co-treatment (band density of 0.75 and 0.806, respectively) when compared with 9cisRA treatment (0.25 and 0.112) and ATRA treatment (0.01 and 0.081). A concomitant enhancement in the target RAR-β protein expression was observed in co-treated cells when compared with individual treatments. We thus conclude that the co-treatment had increased the availability of ATRA, by isomerization of the 9cisRA which then resulted in an increased expression of both RAR-β and RXR-β receptors and the target protein RAR-β which in turn inhibited lung cancer cell growth. Our study results have explored the mechanism of synergistic effect of co-treatment with ATRA and 9cisRA and further preclinical studies are necessary to validate the application of co-treatment of retinoid in clinical use.
An attractive approach to combat disease is to target theregulation of cell function. At the heart of this task are nuclear receptors (NRs); which control functions such as gene transcription. Arguably, the key player in this regulatory machinery is the retinoid X receptor (RXR). This NR associates with a third of the NRs found in humans. Scientists have hypothesized that controlling the activity of RXR is an attractive approach to control cellular functions that modulate diseases such as cancer, diabetes, Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. In this review, we will describe the key features of the RXR, present a historic perspective of the first RXR agonists, and discuss various templates that have been reported to activate RXR with a focus on their molecular structure, biological activity, and limitations. Finally, we will present an outlook of the field and future directions and considerations to synthesize or modulate RXR agonists to make these compounds a clinical reality.
Strobilation is a key stage for polyp-to-jellyfish transition. Knowledge about the strobilation-induced factors and the underlying molecular regulation mechanism could help control jellyfish bloom in nature, improve jellyfish artificial breeding, as well as get insight about the ancestral molecular origin of metamorphosis of amphibians, insect and cnidarians. Natural factors, including temperature, illumination, salinity, and symbiotic zooxanthellae, could induce strobilation. The mode of strobilation and how these natural factors irritate strobilation are distinct in different jellyfish species. Chemicals including indole derivates, 9-cis retinoic acid, elemental iodine, hydrogen peroxide, could also induce strobilation in laboratory. Indole derivates are effective inducers to most scyphozoan species. The molecular mechanism of strobilation is unclear. Results from moon jelly reveal that RxR signaling pathway plays an important role during strobilation. A secreted moon jelly-special protein named CL390 may serve as a strobilation-induced hormone precursor. These results imply that morphological differences in medusa production may mask similarities at the cellular level in different jellyfish species. The molecular mechanism of metamorphosis in jellyfish may share some consistency with amphibians and insects.
横裂是水螅体世代向水母体世代转变的重要阶段.对水螅体横裂诱发条件及调控分子机制的研究不仅对水母爆发生态学和水母人工繁育具有重要意义,而且对比较研究两栖类、昆虫以及刺胞动物等具有复杂生活史生物的变态分子机制起源也具有很好的理论价值.现有研究表明,诱发水螅体横裂的自然环境因素有温度、光照、盐度和共生虫黄藻等,不同门类水母的横裂方式以及环境诱导因素各不相同.能够诱导水螅体横裂的化学因素有吲哚类化合物、9-顺式维甲酸、碘元素和过氧化氢等,其中吲哚类化合物对绝大多数水母水螅体都有诱导作用.尽管水螅体横裂的分子机制尚未明晰,但对海月水母的研究表明,RxR信号通路以及一种横裂诱导激素前体假定蛋白CL390在水母横裂过程中起着重要的作用,提示水母变态分子机制与两栖类和昆虫在分子水平上存在一定程度的共性.
Central hypothyroidism (CH) is a well-known adverse effect of bexarotene treatment for cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL). While concomitant levothyroxine therapy is recommended in these cases, associations between ethnic variation or susceptibility and bexarotene-induced CH have not yet been reported. This study aimed to characterize the kinetics and dose dependency of bexarotene-induced CH in Japanese patients.
Sixty-six Japanese patients with CTCL were retrospectively investigated by evaluating thyroid function during the early phase of bexarotene therapy.
At one week after bexarotene initiation, TSH and FT4 values significantly declined. However, this effect was not bexarotene dose-dependent at least at the dose of 96-320 mg/m2 . Approximately 1 month later, 61 patients exhibited hypothyroidism at a relatively low dose of bexarotene (average 251 mg/m2 /day). Forty-five study cases showed this effect at 1 week. Simple regression analyses indicated that higher pretreatment TSH values (at a cut-off value of 1.30:73% sensitivity, 57% specificity) or lower normal (within the lower half of the reference range) pretreatment FT4 values (84% sensitivity, 57% specificity) were predictive of hypothyroidism at 1 week. The remaining 21 cases showed euthyroidism at 1 week, at which TSH values may roughly predict their thyroid function at 1 month (at a cut-off value of 0.05:100% sensitivity, 80% specificity).
Preventive treatment with levothyroxine is recommended for Japanese CTCL patients prior to bexarotene therapy. Minimally, it should be considered for patients with a pretreatment TSH above 1.30, a lower normal pretreatment FT4, or a TSH below 0.05 at 1 week.
Vitamin D (VD) deficiency has been associated with multiple sclerosis (MS) and other autoimmune diseases (AIDs). However, the effect of the genetics of VD on the risk of MS is subject to debate. This study focuses on genes linked to the VD signaling pathway in families with MS. The evaluation of gene variants in all the members of families could contribute to an additional knowledge on the information obtained from case-control studies that use nonrelated healthy people.
We studied 94 individuals from 15 families including at least two patients with MS. We performed whole-exome next generation sequencing on all individuals and analyzed variants of the DHCR7, CYP2R1, CYP3A4, CYP27A1, GC, CYP27B1, LRP2, CUBN, DAB2, FCGR, RXR, VDR, CYP24A1, and PDIA3 genes. We also studied PTH, FGF23, METTL1, METTL21B, and the role of the linkage disequilibrium block on the long arm of chromosome 12, through analysis of the CDK4, TSFM, AGAP2, and AVIL genes. We compared patients with MS, other AIDs and unaffected members from different family types.
The study described the variants in the VD signaling pathway that appear in families with at least two patients with MS. Some infrequent variants were detected in these families, but no significant difference was observed between patients with MS and/or other AIDs and unaffected family members in the frequency of these variants. Variants previously associated with MS in the literature were not observed in these families or were distributed similarly in patients and unaffected family members.
The study of genes involved in the VD signaling pathway in families that include more than one patient with MS did not identify any variants that could explain the presence of the disease, suggesting that VD metabolism could probably play a role in MS more as an environmental factor rather than as a genetic factor. Our study also supports the analysis of cases and unaffected individuals within families in order to determine the influence of genetic factors.
Mechanisms driving cognitive improvements following nuclear receptor activation are poorly understood. The peroxisome proliferator-activated nuclear receptor alpha (PPARα) forms heterodimers with the nuclear retinoid X receptor (RXR). We report that PPARα mediates the improvement of hippocampal synaptic plasticity upon RXR activation in a transgenic mouse model with cognitive deficits. This improvement results from an increase in GluA1 subunit expression of the alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptor, eliciting an AMPA response at the excitatory synapses. Associated with a two times higher PPARα expression in males than in females, we show that male, but not female, PPARα null mutants display impaired hippocampal long-term potentiation. Moreover, PPARα knockdown in the hippocampus of cognition-impaired mice compromises the beneficial effects of RXR activation on synaptic plasticity only in males. Furthermore, selective PPARα activation with pemafibrate improves synaptic plasticity in male cognition-impaired mice, but not in females. We conclude that striking sex differences in hippocampal synaptic plasticity are observed in mice, related to differences in PPARα expression levels.
Five new ergostanes, penicisteroids D-H (1-5), were isolated from the liquid culture of the deep-sea-derived fungus Penicillium granulatum MCCC 3A00475, along with 27 known compounds. The structures of the new steroids were established mainly on the basis of extensive analysis of 1D and 2D NMR as well as HRESIMS data. Moreover, the absolute configurations of 1 were confirmed unambiguously by the single-crystal X-ray crystallography. Compounds 2 and 4⁻7 showed moderate antiproliferative effects selectively against 12 different cancer cell lines with IC50 values of around 5 μM. Compounds 2 and 6, potent RXRα binders with Kd values of 13.8 and 12.9 μM, respectively, could induce apoptosis by a Retinoid X Receptor (RXR)-α-dependent mechanism by regulating RXRα transcriptional expression and promoting the poly-ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) cleavage. Moreover, they could inhibit proliferation by cell cycle arrest at the G0/G1 phase.
Hepatic stellate cells are liver-specific perivascular cells, identified as the major source of collagen in liver fibrosis, following their activation and conversion to myofibroblast-like cells. Lycopene is a carotenoid with biological activities and protective effects described in different pathologies, but little is known about its role in liver protection. We evaluated the influence of lycopene on the cell cycle and lipid metabolism and monitored the possible pathways involved in lycopene inhibition of stellate cell activation. Lycopene induced expression of the lipocyte phenotype, with an accumulation of fat droplets in cytoplasm, with high synthesis and turnover of phospholipids and triglycerides. Cell proliferation analysis showed that lycopene reduced the growth of GRX cells. Lycopene induced an arrest in the G0/G1 phase, followed by a decrease of cells in the G2/M phase, regardless of the concentration of lycopene used. Lycopene modulated relevant signaling pathways related to cholesterol metabolism, cellular proliferation, and lipid metabolism. Also, lycopene treatment increased the expression of RXR-α, RXR-β, and PPARγ, important biomarkers of liver regeneration. These results show that lycopene was able to negatively modulate events related to the activation of hepatic stellate cells through mechanisms that involve changes in expression of cellular lipid metabolism factors, and suggest that this compound might provide a novel pharmacological approach for the prevention and treatment of fibrotic liver diseases.
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia and it is characterized by the deposition of amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques and neurofibrillary tangles in the brain. However, the complete pathogenesis of the disease is still unknown. High level of serum cholesterol has been found to positively correlate with an increased risk of dementia and some studies have reported a decreased prevalence of AD in patients taking cholesterol-lowering drugs. Years of research have shown a strong correlation between blood hypercholesterolemia and AD, however cholesterol is not able to cross the Blood Brain Barrier (BBB) into the brain. Cholesterol lowering therapies have shown mixed results in cognitive performance in AD patients, raising questions of whether brain cholesterol metabolism in the brain should be studied separately from peripheral cholesterol metabolism and what their relationship is. Unlike cholesterol, oxidized cholesterol metabolites known as oxysterols are able to cross the BBB from the circulation into the brain and vice-versa. The main oxysterols present in the circulation are 24S-hydroxycholesterol and 27-hydroxycholesterol. These oxysterols and their catalysing enzymes have been found to be altered in AD brains and there is evidence indicating their influence in the progression of the disease. This review gives a broad perspective on the relationship between hypercholesterolemia and AD, cholesterol lowering therapies for AD patients and the role of oxysterols in pathological and non-pathological conditions. Also, we propose cholesterol metabolites as valuable targets for prevention and alternative AD treatments.
Macrophages play important and diverse roles during cancer progression. However, cancer therapies based on macrophage modulation are lacking in tools that can recognize and deliver therapeutic payloads to macrophages in a tumor-specific manner. As a result, treatments tend to interfere with normal macrophage functions in healthy organs. We previously identified a macrophage-binding peptide, termed CRV. Here, we show that upon systemic administration into tumor-bearing mice, CRV selectively homes to tumors, extravasates, and preferentially binds to macrophages within. CRV exhibits a higher affinity for tumor macrophages than for other cells in tumors or for other macrophage types elsewhere in the body. We further identified and validated retinoid X receptor beta (RXRB) as the CRV receptor. Intriguingly, although it is known as a nuclear receptor, RXRB shows a prominent cell surface localization that is largely restricted to tumor macrophages. Systemic administration of anti-RXRB antibodies also results in tumor-selective binding to macrophages similar to CRV. Lastly, we demonstrate the ability of CRV to improve the delivery of nano-carriers into solid tumors and macrophages within. In summary, we describe here a novel cell surface marker and targeting tools for tumor macrophages that may aid in future development of macrophage-modulatory cancer therapies.
The cytotoxicity of two recently synthesized triorganotin isothiocyanate derivatives, nuclear retinoid X receptor ligands, was tested and compared in estrogen-receptor-positive MCF 7 and -negative MDA-MB-231 human breast carcinoma cell lines. A 48 h MTT assay indicated that tributyltin isothiocyanate (TBT-ITC) is more cytotoxic than triphenyltin isothiocyanate (TPT-ITC) in MCF 7 cells, and the same trend was observed in the MDA-MB-231 cell line. A comet assay revealed the presence of both crosslinks and increasing DNA damage levels after the 17 h treatment with both derivatives. Differences in cytotoxicity of TBT-ITC and TPT-ITC detected by FDA staining correspond to the MTT data, communicating more pronounced effects in MCF 7 than in the MDA-MB-231 cell line. Both derivatives were found to cause apoptosis, as shown by the mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) depolarization and caspase-3/7 activation. The onset of caspase activation correlated with MMP dissipation and the total cytotoxicity more than with the amount of active caspases. In conclusion, our data suggest that the DNA damage induced by TBT-ITC and TPT-ITC treatment could underlie their cytotoxicity in the cell lines studied.
Organotin anticancer agent di-n-butyl-di-(4-chlorobenzohydroxamato)tin(iv) (DBDCT) exerted an inhibitory effect on its major metabolic enzyme cytochrome CYP3A. But whether hepatic drug-metabolizing enzymes and their regulatory nuclear receptors including pregnane PXR and constitutive androstane CAR binding with retinoid receptor RXR as a heterodimer are involved in the DBDCT-mediated regulation of CYP3A remains unclear. This study was undertaken to determine the mechanisms responsible for the effects of DBDCT on CYP3A suppression, focusing on the PXR-mediated and NF-κB pathways. The results indicated DBDCT suppressed CYP3A expression by inhibiting CAR expression. But what's interesting is, both protein and mRNA of PXR increased with increasing DBDCT. A further exploration, dual luciferase reporter gene analysis, clarified that DBDCT induced CYP3A expression elevation via the PXR-mediated pathway and this induction was countered by activation of NF-κB, which played a pivotal role in suppression of CYP3A through disrupting the association of the PXR-RXRα complex with DNA sequences by EMSA. PXR-mediated CYP3A expression was similarly demonstrated by RNAi. As expected, expression of CYP3A and its mRNA levels were reduced by DBDCT only in NF-κB(+/+) but not in NF-κB(-/-) cells. The inductive effect of DBDCT on CYP3A4 mRNA was enhanced in PXR shRNA-transfected cells but weakened in the ip65 group, which showed both PXR up-regulated CYP3A expression and NF-κB p65 activation directly contributed to CYP3A inhibition. In conclusion, activated NF-κB by DBDCT interacts directly with the DNA-binding domain of PXR, and disrupts the binding between the PXR-RXR dimer, thereby affecting the regulatory process for CYP3A transcription and, therefore, leading to a decrease of the expression of the PXR-regulated CYP3A.
Periodontitis is a complex multifactorial disease and is typically polygenic in origin. Genes play a fundamental part in each biologic process forming complex networks of interactions. However, only some genes have a high number of interactions with other genes in the network and may, therefore, be considered to play an important role. In a preliminary bioinformatic analysis, five genes that showed a higher number of interactions were identified and termed leader genes. In the present study, we use real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technology to evaluate the expression levels of leader genes in the leukocytes of 10 patients with refractory chronic periodontitis and compare the expression levels with those of the same genes in 24 healthy patients.
Blood was collected from 24 healthy human subjects and 10 patients with refractory chronic periodontitis and placed into heparinized blood collection tubes by personnel trained in phlebotomy using a sterile technique. Blood leukocyte cells were immediately lysed by using a kit for total RNA purification from human whole blood. Complementary DNA (cDNA) synthesis was obtained from total RNA and then real-time quantitative PCR was performed. PCR efficiencies were calculated with a relative standard curve derived from a five cDNA dilution series in triplicate that gave regression coefficients &gt;0.98 and efficiencies &gt;96%. The standard curves were obtained using glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) and growth factor receptor binding protein 2 (GRB2), casitas B-lineage lymphoma (CBL), nuclear factor-KB1 (NFKB1), and REL-A (gene for transcription factor p65) gene primers and amplified with 1.6, 8, 40, 200, and 1,000 ng/μL total cDNA. Curves obtained for each sample showed a linear relationship between RNA concentrations and the cycle threshold value of real-time quantitative PCR for all genes. Data were expressed as mean ± SE (SEM). The groups were compared to the analysis of variance. A probability value &lt;0.01 was considered statistically significant.
The present study agrees with the preliminary bioinformatics analysis. In our experiments, the association of pathology with the genes was statistically significant for GRB2 and CBL (P &lt;0.01), and it was not statistically significant for REL-A and NFKB1.
This article lends support to our preliminary hypothesis that assigned an important role in refractory aggressive periodontitis to leader genes.
Meta-analysis has shown that bacillus Calmette-Guérin is less effective in females undergoing treatment for urothelial carcinoma. Urothelial carcinoma cells express immune regulatory proteins as a consequence of bacillus Calmette-Guérin induced, nuclear factor κB signaling. Nuclear factor κB is influenced by estrogen receptor binding. We evaluated the effect of the physiological estradiol concentration on the expression of bacillus Calmette-Guérin induced, nuclear factor κB regulated immune proteins.
We determined the estrogen receptor expression status of human urothelial carcinoma cell lines by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. The functional status of estrogen receptor signaling was established using estrogen receptor reporter constructs. We used gene expression profiling of urothelial carcinoma cells combined with reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction to identify the nuclear factor κB dependent immune regulatory proteins expressed in response to bacillus Calmette-Guérin. We determined the influence of the estradiol concentration on bacillus Calmette-Guérin dependent interleukin-6 and 8, chemokine (c-x-c motif) ligands 1 and 2, and chemokine (c-c motif) ligand 20 gene expression by quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction.
Urothelial carcinoma cell lines expressed functional estrogen receptor. Nuclear factor κB signaling was inhibited by estradiol in a dose and estrogen receptor dependent manner. Urothelial carcinoma cell expression of interleukin-6 and 8, chemokine (c-x-c motif) ligands 1 and 2, and chemokine (c-c motif) ligand 20 was up-regulated in response to bacillus Calmette-Guérin in a nuclear factor κB dependent manner. There was a significant dose dependent effect of estradiol on the expression of these genes in bacillus Calmette-Guérin treated urothelial carcinoma cells.
The physiological concentration of estrogen influences nuclear factor κB signaling and bacillus Calmette-Guérin dependent gene expression. Serum estradiol fluctuations in women may influence the response of urothelial carcinoma to intravesical bacillus Calmette-Guérin treatment.
Epididymal function depends on androgen signaling through the androgen receptor (AR), although most of the direct AR target genes in epididymis remain unknown. Here we globally mapped the AR binding regions in mouse caput epididymis in which AR is highly expressed. Chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing indicated that AR bound selectively to 19,377 DNA regions, the majority of which were intergenic and intronic. Motif analysis showed that 94% of the AR binding regions harbored consensus androgen response elements enriched with multiple binding motifs that included nuclear factor 1 and activator protein 2 sites consistent with combinatorial regulation. Unexpectedly, AR binding regions showed limited conservation across species, regardless of whether the metric for conservation was based on local sequence similarity or the presence of consensus androgen response elements. Further analysis suggested the AR target genes are involved in diverse biological themes that include lipid metabolism and sperm maturation. Potential novel mechanisms of AR regulation were revealed at individual genes such as cysteine-rich secretory protein 1. The composite studies provide new insights into AR regulation under physiological conditions and a global resource of AR binding sites in a normal androgen-responsive tissue.
The NSD (nuclear receptor-binding SET domain protein) family encodes methyltransferases that are important in multiple aspects of development and disease. Perturbations in NSD family members can lead to Sotos syndrome and Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome as well as cancers such as acute myeloid leukemia. Previous studies have implicated NSD1 (KMT3B) in transcription and methylation of histone H3 at lysine 36 (H3-K36), but its molecular mechanism in these processes remains largely unknown. Here we describe an NSD1 regulatory network in human cells. We show that NSD1 binds near various promoter elements and regulates multiple genes that appear to have a concerted role in various processes, such as cell growth/cancer, keratin biology, and bone morphogenesis. In particular, we show that NSD1 binding is concentrated upstream of gene targets such as the bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP4) and zinc finger protein 36 C3H type-like 1 (ZFP36L1/TPP). NSD1 regulates the levels of the various forms of methylation at H3-K36 primarily, but not exclusively, within the promoter proximal region occupied by NSD1. At BMP4 we find that this reduces the levels of RNAP II recruited to the promoter, suggesting a role for NSD1-dependent methylation in initiation. Interestingly, we also observe that the RNAP II molecules that lie within BMP4 have inappropriate persistence of serine-5 phosphorylation and reduced levels of serine-2 phosphorylation within the C-terminal domain (CTD) of the large subunit of RNAP II. Our findings indicate that NSD1 regulates RNAP II recruitment to BMP4, and failure to do so leads to reduced gene expression and abrogated levels of H3K36Me and CTD phosphorylation.
Pyrrole-imidazole polyamides are a class of small molecules that can be programmed to bind a broad repertoire of DNA sequences, disrupt transcription factor-DNA interfaces, and modulate gene expression pathways in cell culture experiments. In this paper we describe a high-resolution X-ray crystal structure of a β-amino turn-linked eight-ring cyclic Py-Im polyamide bound to the central six base pairs of the sequence d(5'-CCAGTACTGG-3')(2), revealing significant modulation of DNA shape. We compare the DNA structural perturbations induced by DNA-binding transcripton factors, androgen receptor and glucocorticoid receptor, in the major groove to those induced by cyclic polyamide binding in the minor groove. The cyclic polyamide is an allosteric modulator that perturbs the DNA structure in such a way that nuclear receptor protein binding is no longer compatible. This allosteric perturbation of the DNA helix provides a molecular basis for disruption of transcription factor-DNA interfaces by small molecules, a minimum step in chemical control of gene networks.
Initially thought to play a restricted role in calcium homeostasis, the pleiotropic actions of vitamin D in biology and their clinical significance are only now becoming apparent. However, the mode of action of vitamin D, through its cognate nuclear vitamin D receptor (VDR), and its contribution to diverse disorders, remain poorly understood. We determined VDR binding throughout the human genome using chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by massively parallel DNA sequencing (ChIP-seq). After calcitriol stimulation, we identified 2776 genomic positions occupied by the VDR and 229 genes with significant changes in expression in response to vitamin D. VDR binding sites were significantly enriched near autoimmune and cancer associated genes identified from genome-wide association (GWA) studies. Notable genes with VDR binding included IRF8, associated with MS, and PTPN2 associated with Crohn's disease and T1D. Furthermore, a number of single nucleotide polymorphism associations from GWA were located directly within VDR binding intervals, for example, rs13385731 associated with SLE and rs947474 associated with T1D. We also observed significant enrichment of VDR intervals within regions of positive selection among individuals of Asian and European descent. ChIP-seq determination of transcription factor binding, in combination with GWA data, provides a powerful approach to further understanding the molecular bases of complex diseases.
The human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) is specifically overexpressed in tumors of several cancers, including an aggressive form of breast cancer. It is therefore a target for both cancer diagnostics and therapy. The 58 amino acid residue Zher2 affibody molecule was previously engineered as a high-affinity binder of HER2. Here we determined the structure of Zher2 in solution and the crystal structure of Zher2 in complex with the HER2 extracellular domain. Zher2 binds to a conformational epitope on HER2 that is distant from those recognized by the therapeutic antibodies trastuzumab and pertuzumab. Its small size and lack of interference may provide Zher2 with advantages for diagnostic use or even for delivery of therapeutic agents to HER2-expressing tumors when trastuzumab or pertuzumab are already employed. Biophysical characterization shows that Zher2 is thermodynamically stable in the folded state yet undergoing conformational interconversion on a submillisecond time scale. The data suggest that it is the HER2-binding conformation that is formed transiently prior to binding. Still, binding is very strong with a dissociation constant K(D) = 22 pM, and perfect conformational homogeneity is therefore not necessarily required in engineered binding proteins. A comparison of the original Z domain scaffold to free and bound Zher2 structures reveals how high-affinity binding has evolved during selection and affinity maturation and suggests how a compromise between binding surface optimization and stability and dynamics of the unbound state has been reached.
Optical fluorescence imaging is increasingly being used to obtain images of biological functions of specific targets in vitro and in small animals (1, 2). Near-infrared (NIR) fluorescence (700–900 nm) detection avoids the background fluorescence interference of natural biomolecules, providing a high contrast between target and background tissues. NIR fluorescence imaging is becoming a non-invasive alternative to radionuclide imaging in vitro and in small animals. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) maps information about tissues spatially and functionally. Protons (hydrogen nuclei) are widely used to create images because of their abundance in water molecules, which comprise &gt;80% of most soft tissues. The contrast of proton MRI images depends mainly on the density of nuclei (proton spins), the relaxation times of the nuclear magnetization (T1, longitudinal; T2, transverse), the magnetic environment of the tissues, and the blood flow to the tissues. However, insufficient contrast between normal and diseased tissues requires the use of contrast agents. Most contrast agents affect the T1 and T2 relaxation times of the surrounding nuclei, mainly the protons of water. T2* is the spin–spin relaxation time composed of variations from molecular interactions and intrinsic magnetic heterogeneities of tissues in the magnetic field (3). Cross-linked iron oxide (CLIO) nanoparticles and other iron oxide formulations affect T2 primarily and lead to a decreased signal. A multimodal nanoparticle probe that consists of a contrast agent and a NIR fluorochrome may provide consistent information. CLIO nanoparticles can be internalized by cells of the reticuloendothelial system and have long circulating times within an animal body. The blood half-life of CLIO is ~10 h in mice (4). The accumulation of nanoparticles in cells causes a reduction in signal intensity with T2-weighted (T2*W) spin-echo pulse sequences. NIR fluorochromes (e.g., Cy5.5) provide an improved optical (NIR) signal from tissue. CLIO-Cy5.5 has been developed as a multimodal probe for imaging. Endothelial cells are important in inflammatory responses (5, 6). Bacterial lipopolysaccharide, virus, inflammation, and tissue injury increase tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα), interleukin-1 (IL-1), and other cytokine and chemokine secretion. Emigration of leukocytes from blood is dependent on their ability to roll along endothelial cell surfaces and subsequently adhere to endothelial cell surfaces. Inflammatory mediators and cytokines induce chemokine secretion from endothelial cells and other vascular cells and increase their expression of cell-surface adhesion molecules, such as intracellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), integrins, and selectins. Chemokines are chemotactic toward leukocytes and toward sites of inflammation and tissue injury. The movement of leukocytes through endothelial junctions into the extravascular space is highly orchestrated through various interactions with different adhesion molecules on endothelial cells (7). VCAM-1 is found in very low amounts on the cell surface of resting endothelial cells and other vascular cells, such as smooth muscle cells and fibroblasts (8-12). VCAM-1 binds to very late antigen-4 (VLA-4) integrin on the cell surface of leukocytes. IL-1 and TNFα increase expression of VCAM-1 and other cell adhesion molecules on the vascular endothelial cells, which leads to leukocyte adhesion to the activated endothelium. Furthermore, VCAM-1 expression is also induced by oxidized low-density lipoproteins under atherogenic conditions (13). Overexpression of VCAM-1 by atherosclerotic lesions plays an important role in their progression toward vulnerable plaques, which may erode and rupture. CLIO nanoparticle targeted with anti–VCAM-1 antibody is being developed as a non-invasive agent for VCAM-1 expression in vascular endothelial cells during different stages of inflammation in atherosclerosis (14). A linear peptide (VHPKQHR) homologous to VLA-4 bound to and was internalized by cells expressing VCAM-1 (15, 16). VHPKQHRGGSK(FITC)GC (VINP-28) with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) was synthesized and conjugated to CLIO-Cy5.5 nanoparticle to form a multimodal imaging agent (VINP-28-CLIO-Cy5.5) that consists of CLIO nanoparticle with attachment of VINP-28 and Cy5.5.
High mobility group box-1 (HMGB-1) is a nuclear protein that can bind to and condense plasmid DNA. In this study, we developed a recombinant VEGF receptor binding peptide (VRBP) linked to HMGB-1 box A (VRBP-HMGB1A) as a targeting gene carrier to hypoxic endothelial cells. Hypoxic endothelial cells in ischemic tissues of solid tumors are important targets for gene therapy. A recombinant VRBP-HMGB1A expression vector, pET21a-VRBP-HMGB1A was constructed. VRBP-HMGB1A was over-expressed in BL21 strain and purified by nickel-chelate affinity chromatography. Complex formation between VRBP-HMGB1A and pCMV-Luc was confirmed by gel retardation assay. pCMV-Luc was retarded completely at a 2/1 weight ratio (peptide/plasmid). For transfection assays, calf pulmonary artery endothelial (CPAE) cells were incubated under hypoxia for 24 h, prior to transfection to induce the VEGF receptors on the cells. VRBP-HMGB1A/pCMV-Luc complexes were transfected to hypoxic CPAE cells. The highest transfection efficiency was at a 30/1 weight ratio (peptide/plasmid). In addition, VRBP-HMGB1A had higher efficiency than poly-L-lysine (PLL) specifically in hypoxic CPAE cells, However, VRBP-HMGB1A had lower efficiency than PLL in 293, H9C2, and normoxic CPAE cells. In MTT assay, VRBP-HMGB1A was less toxic than PLL to cells. In conclusion, VRBP-HMGB1A is a potential gene carrier for targeting hypoxic endothelial cells and thus, may be useful for cancer gene therapy.
The insertion of amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid (AMPA) receptors into the plasma membrane and removal via internalization are essential for regulating synaptic strength, which underlies the basic mechanism of learning and memory. The retinocollicular pathway undergoes synaptic refinement during development and shows a wide variety of long-term synaptic changes; however, still little is known about its underlying molecular regulation. Here we report a rapid developmental long-term potentiation (LTP)/long-term depression (LTD) switch and its intracellular mechanism at the rat retinocollicular pathway from postnatal day 5 (P5) to P14. Before P9, neurons always exhibited LTP, whereas LTD was observed only after P10. Blockade of GluR2/3-glutamate receptor-interacting protein (GRIP)/AMPA-receptor-binding protein (ABP)/protein interacting with C kinase 1 (PICK1) interactions with pep2-SVKI could sustain the LTP after P10. This suggests that the LTP/LTD switch relied on PDZ protein activities. Selective interruption of GluR2/3-PICK1 binding by pep2-EVKI blocked the long-lasting effects of both LTP and LTD, suggesting a role for PICK1 in the maintenance of long-term synaptic plasticity. Interestingly, synaptic expression of GRIP increased more than twofold from P7 to P11, whereas ABP and PICK1 expression levels remained stable. Blockade of spontaneous retinal input suppressed this increase and abolished the LTP/LTD switch. These results suggest that the increased GRIP synaptic expression may be a key regulatory factor in mediating the activity-dependent developmental LTP/LTD switch, whereas PICK1 may be required for both LTP and LTD to maintain their long-term effects.
Fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFR) are cell surface tyrosine kinases that function in cell proliferation and differentiation. Aberrant FGFR signaling occurs in diverse cancers due to gene amplification, but the associated oncogenic mechanisms are poorly understood. Using a proteomics approach, we identified signal transducers and activators of transcription-3 (STAT3) as a receptor-binding partner that is mediated by Tyr(677) phosphorylation on FGFR. Binding to activated FGFR was essential for subsequent tyrosine phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of STAT3, along with activation of its downstream target genes. Tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3 was also dependent on concomitant FGFR-dependent activity of SRC and JAK kinases. Lastly, tyrosine (but not serine) phosphorylation of STAT3 required amplified FGFR protein expression, generated either by enforced overexpression or as associated with gene amplification in cancer cells. Our findings show that amplified FGFR expression engages the STAT3 pathway, and they suggest therapeutic strategies to attack FGFR-overexpressing cancers.
Luminal-like breast tumor cells express estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha), a member of the nuclear receptor family of ligand-activated transcription factors that controls their proliferation, survival, and functional status. To identify the molecular determinants of this hormone-responsive tumor phenotype, a comprehensive genome-wide analysis was performed in estrogen stimulated MCF-7 and ZR-75.1 cells by integrating time-course mRNA expression profiling with global mapping of genomic ERalpha binding sites by chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled to massively parallel sequencing, microRNA expression profiling, and in silico analysis of transcription units and receptor binding regions identified. All 1270 genes that were found to respond to 17beta-estradiol in both cell lines cluster in 33 highly concordant groups, each of which showed defined kinetics of RNA changes. This hormone-responsive gene set includes several direct targets of ERalpha and is organized in a gene regulation cascade, stemming from ligand-activated receptor and reaching a large number of downstream targets via AP-2gamma, B-cell activating transcription factor, E2F1 and 2, E74-like factor 3, GTF2IRD1, hairy and enhancer of split homologue-1, MYB, SMAD3, RARalpha, and RXRalpha transcription factors. MicroRNAs are also integral components of this gene regulation network because miR-107, miR-424, miR-570, miR-618, and miR-760 are regulated by 17beta-estradiol along with other microRNAs that can target a significant number of transcripts belonging to one or more estrogen-responsive gene clusters.
B-cell activation factor belonging to the tumor necrosis factor family (BAFF) is a major contributor to survival of B lymphocytes during development and maturation. A relationship between circulating BAFF levels and disease activity has been reported in patients with the autoimmune disease Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE). Clinical trials targeting BAFF or its receptors are currently in progress. In order to further characterize a rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) model of SLE, we investigated the expression of BAFF and its receptors in non-inbred, pedigreed rabbits derived from breeding and selection based on autoantibody responses. We immunized rabbits related to previous groups that developed autoantibodies and inflammatory responses after immunizations with peptides synthesized on multiple antigen-branched polylysine backbones. Blood and sera collected before immunization and after boosts were used for health monitoring, analyses of serum autoantibody responses by ELISA and immunofluorescence. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were studied by flow cytometry and were the source of mRNA for quantitative PCR analyses. We hypothesized that BAFF mRNA expression and serum BAFF levels measured indirectly through BAFF receptor binding might increase in autoantibody-producing rabbits. Immunized rabbits developed elevated levels of leucocyte populations, anti-nuclear, anti-dsDNA and other autoantibodies. BR3 mRNA levels in total PBMC decreased and BAFF levels remained low and unchanged in most immunized rabbits. By flow cytometry, percentages of BAFF positive cells decreased. Percentages of transmembrane activator and CAML interactor (TACI) decreased in most rabbits from all the immunized groups. The rabbit is an important model for human autoimmune and infectious diseases, and a high quality draft rabbit genome assembly was recently completed. Human disease models developed in non-inbred pedigreed animals are better able to reflect the complexities of diseases such as SLE with familial patterns of inheritance. Although no consistent pattern of elevated expression of BAFF mRNA or protein was found in the rabbits studied, the data collected and reported here build upon previous data to refine understanding of a rabbit model of SLE.
Mitogenic effect of augmenter of liver regeneration (ALR), a protein produced and released by hepatocytes, on hepatocytes in vivo but not in vitro suggests that the effect is mediated by nonparenchymal cells. Since mediators produced by Kupffer cells are implicated in hepatic regeneration, we investigated receptor for ALR and its functions in rat Kupffer cells. Kupffer cells were isolated from rat liver by enzymatic digestion and centrifugal elutriation. Radioligand ([(125)I] ALR) receptor binding, ALR-induced GTP/G-protein association, and nitric oxide (NO), tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, and interleukin-6 (IL-6) synthesis were determined. High-affinity receptor for ALR, belonging to the G-protein family, with K(d) of 1.25 +/- 0.18 nM and B(max) of 0.26 +/- 0.02 fmol/microg DNA was identified. ALR stimulated NO, TNF-alpha, and IL-6 synthesis via cholera toxin-sensitive G-protein, as well as p38-MAPK activity and nuclear translocation of NFkappaB. While inhibitor of NFkappaB (MG132) inhibited ALR-induced NO synthesis, MG132 and p38-MAPK inhibitor (SB203580) abrogated ALR-induced TNF-alpha and IL-6 synthesis. ALR also prevented the release of mediator(s) from Kupffer cells that cause inhibition of DNA synthesis in hepatocytes. Administration of ALR to 40% partially hepatectomized rats increased expression of TNF-alpha, IL-6, and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and caused augmentation of hepatic regeneration. These results demonstrate specific G-protein coupled binding of ALR and its function in Kupffer cells and suggest that mediators produced by ALR-stimulated Kupffer cells may elicit physiologically important effects on hepatocytes.
The mTOR kinase inhibitor rapamycin (sirolimus) is a drug with potent immunosuppressive and antiproliferative properties. We found that rapamycin induces the TGFbeta/Smad signaling cascade in rat mesangial cells (MC) as depicted by the nuclear translocation of phospho-Smads 2, -3 and Smad-4, respectively. Concomitantly, rapamycin increases the nuclear DNA binding of receptor (R)- and co-Smad proteins to a cognate Smad-binding element (SBE) which in turn causes an increase in profibrotic gene expression as exemplified by the connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) and plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1). Using small interfering (si)RNA we demonstrate that Smad 2/3 activation by rapamycin depends on its endogenous receptor FK binding protein 12 (FKBP12). Mechanistically, Smad induction by rapamycin is initiated by an increase in active TGFbeta(1) as shown by ELISA and by the inhibitory effects of a neutralizing TGFbeta antibody. Using an activin receptor-like kinase (ALK)-5 inhibitor and by siRNA against the TGFbeta type II receptor (TGFbeta-RII) we furthermore demonstrate a functional involvement of both types of TGFbeta receptors. However, rapamycin did not compete with TGFbeta for TGFbeta-receptor binding as found in radioligand-binding assay. Besides SB203580, a specific inhibitor of the p38 MAPK, the reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenger N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC) and a cell-permeable superoxide dismutase (SOD) mimetic strongly abrogated the stimulatory effects of rapamycin on Smad 2 and 3 phosphorylation. Furthermore, the rapid increase in dichlorofluorescein (DCF) formation implies that rapamycin mainly acts through ROS. In conclusion, activation of the profibrotic TGFbeta/Smad signaling cascade accompanies the immunosuppressive and antiproliferative actions of rapamycin.
Somatostatin receptor subtype 2 (SSTR2) is the principal mediator of somatostatin's (SST) antiproliferative effects on normal and cancer cells. Therefore, we investigated whether the enhanced expression of SSTR2 could inhibit the proliferation of tumor cells, and, if so, the mechanisms that might be involved.
SSTR2 expression levels were determined by qRT-PCR in several tumor cell lines. Then, a plasmid pIRES2-EGFP-SSTR2 (pSIG) was constructed and stably transfected into MCF-7 cells (MCF-7/pSIG). After SSTR2 overexpression was identified by qRT-PCR, immunofluorescence staining and a receptor binding assay, the MCF-7/pSIG cells were analyzed by PI staining for apoptosis and cell cycle arrest was tested by flow cytometry for epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) expression. The EGF-stimulated proliferation of MCF-7 cells was assayed by MTT.
The human breast cancer cell line MCF-7 expresses a lower level of SSTR2, thereby partly accounting for the decreased response to SST. The overexpression of SSTR2 in MCF-7 cells resulted in apoptosis, cytostasis and G(1)/S cell cycle arrest. Furthermore, the expression of EGFR, together with EGF-stimulated proliferation, was markedly decreased in the MCF-7/pSIG cells.
Enhanced SSTR2 expression played an antiproliferative role in MCF-7 cells through inducing apoptosis and G(1)/S cell cycle arrest, and also by decreasing EGFR expression, thereby counteracting the growth-stimulating effect of EGF. Our data seem to indicate that developing a new therapeutic agent capable of upregulating SSTR expression could potentially be a way to block tumor progression.Acta Pharmacologica Sinica (2009) 30: 1053-1059; doi: 10.1038/aps.2009.59.
Planar imaging of (188)Re-labeled vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)(189) exon 6-encoded peptide (QKRKRKKSRYKS) with single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) in tumor-bearing nude mice and effects of the transfecting truncated KDR gene on its imaging were investigated, so as to provide a basis for further applying the peptide to tumor-targeted radionuclide treatment.
QKRKRKKSRYKS, coupling with mercaptoacetyltriglycine (MAG(3)) chelator was labeled with (188)Re; then in vivo distribution, planar imaging with SPECT and blocking experiment in tumor-bearing nude mice were analyzed. Recombinant adenovirus vectors carrying the truncated KDR gene were constructed to transfect tumor tissues to evaluate the effects of truncated KDR on the in vivo distribution and tumor planar imaging of (188)Re-MAG(3)-QKRKRKKSRYKS in tumor-bearing nude mice.
The labeled peptide exhibited a sound receptor binding activity. Planar imaging with SPECT demonstrated significant radioactivity accumulation in tumor 1 h after injection of the labeled peptide and disappearance of radioactivity 3 h later. Significant radioactivity accumulation was also observed in the liver, intestines and kidneys but was not obvious in other tissues. An hour after injection of the labeled peptide, the percentage of the injected radioactive dose per gram (%ID/g) of tumor and tumor/contralateral muscle tissues ratio were 1.98+/-0.38 and 2.53+/-0.33, respectively, and increased to 3.08+/-0.84 and 3.61+/-0.59 in the group transfected with the truncated KDR gene, respectively, and radioactivity accumulation in tumor with planar imaging also increased significantly in the transfection group.
(188)Re-MAG(3)-QKRKRKKSRYKS can accumulate in tumor tissues, which could be increased by the transfection of truncated KDR gene. This study provides a basis for further applying the peptide to tumor targeted radionuclide imaging and treatment.
Previous findings in rodents used as a model of diabetes suggest that insulin activation of atypical protein kinase C (aPKC) is impaired in muscle, but, unexpectedly, conserved in liver, despite impaired hepatic protein kinase B (PKB/Akt) activation. Moreover, aPKC at least partly regulates two major transactivators: (1) hepatic sterol receptor binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c), which controls lipid synthesis; and (2) nuclear factor kappa B (NFkappaB), which promotes inflammation and systemic insulin resistance.
In Goto-Kakizaki rats used as a model of type 2 diabetes, we examined: (1) whether differences in hepatic aPKC and PKB activation reflect differences in activation of IRS-1- and IRS-2-dependent phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K); (2) whether hepatic SREBP-1c and NFkappaB are excessively activated by aPKC; and (3) metabolic consequences of excessive activation of hepatic aPKC, SREBP-1c and NFkappaB.
In liver, as well as in muscle, IRS-2/PI3K activation by insulin was intact, whereas IRS-1/PI3K activation by insulin was impaired. Moreover, hepatic IRS-2 is known to control hepatic aPKC during insulin activation. Against this background, selective inhibition of hepatic aPKC by adenoviral-mediated expression of mRNA encoding kinase-inactive aPKC or short hairpin RNA targeting Irs2 mRNA and partially depleting hepatic IRS-2 diminished hepatic SREBP-1c production and NFkappaB activities, concomitantly improving serum lipids and insulin signalling in muscle and liver. Similar improvements in SREBP-1c, NFkappaB and insulin signalling were seen in ob/ob mice following inhibition of hepatic aPKC.
In diabetic rodent liver, diminished PKB activation may largely reflect impaired IRS-1/PI3K activation, while conserved aPKC activation reflects retained IRS-2/PI3K activity. Hepatic aPKC may also contribute importantly to excessive SREPB-1c and NFkappaB activities. Excessive hepatic aPKC-dependent activation of SREBP-1c and NFkappaB may contribute importantly to hyperlipidaemia and systemic insulin resistance.
IRBIT is a recently identified protein that modulates the activities of both inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate receptor and pancreas-type Na(+)/HCO(3)(-) cotransporter 1, and the multisite phosphorylation of IRBIT is required for achieving this modulatory action. Here, we report the identification of the cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor (CPSF), which is a multi-protein complex involved in 3' processing of mRNA precursors, as an additional binding partner for IRBIT. We found that IRBIT interacted with CPSF and was recruited to an exogenous polyadenylation signal-containing RNA. The main target for IRBIT in CPSF was Fip1 subunit, and the phosphorylation of the serine-rich region of IRBIT was required both for direct association with Fip1 in vitro and for redistribution of Fip1 into the cytoplasm of intact cells. Furthermore, tert-butylhydroquinone (tBHQ), an agent that induces oxidative stress, increased the phosphorylation level of IRBIT in vivo and in parallel enhanced the interaction between IRBIT and CPSF and promoted the cytoplasmic distribution of endogenous Fip1. In addition to CPSF, IRBIT interacted in vitro with poly(A) polymerase (PAP), which is the enzyme recruited by CPSF to elongate the poly(A) tail, and inhibited PAP activity in a phosphorylation-dependent manner. These findings raise the possibility that IRBIT modulates the polyadenylation state of specific mRNAs, both by controlling the cytoplasmic/nuclear partitioning of Fip1 and by inhibiting PAP activity, in response to a stimulus that alters its phosphorylation state.
The compound 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) is the major aldehyde formed during lipid peroxidation of omega-6-polyunsaturated fatty acids and has been suggested to regulate inflammatory responses because it inhibits tumor necrosis factor (TNF) mRNA production in the human monocytic cell line THP-1. Here we demonstrate that 4-HNE inhibits TNF and interleukin-1beta production in human monocytes in response to lipopolysaccharide. The main action of 4-HNE occurred at the pretranscriptional level; there was no effect on TNF mRNA production or stability when 4-HNE was added after stimulation. The mechanism of action of 4-HNE appears to be downstream of lipopolysaccharide-receptor binding. In the human monocytic MonoMac 6 cell line, 4-HNE caused selective inhibition of the activity of the mitogen-activated protein kinases p38 and ERK1/ERK2, but not JNK. However, in monocytes, the activities of all three kinases were inhibited, suggesting that the effects of 4-HNE were exerted at points upstream of ERK1/ERK2 and JNK as the levels of the phosphorylated kinases were reduced. In contrast, p38 phosphorylation was not inhibited, suggesting that 4-HNE affects kinase activity. 4-HNE also inhibited nuclear factor-kappaB activation in monocytes. In view of the roles of p38, ERK1/ERK2, JNK, and nuclear factor-kappaB in inflammation, the data suggest that 4-HNE, at nontoxic concentrations, has anti-inflammatory properties, most likely through an effect on these signaling molecules, and could lead to the development of novel treatments for inflammatory diseases.
Intestinal epithelial cells play an important role in the mucosal immune reaction in inflammatory bowel diseases via the production and expression of chemokines and adhesion molecules, such as interleukin-8 (IL-8) and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), which are involved in the neutrophil infiltration and tissue damage in the inflamed colon. Notably, glucosamine, a naturally-occurring amino monosaccharide, has been shown to exhibit an anti-inflammatory action by inhibiting neutrophil functions. In the present study, to evaluate the anti-inflammatory action of glucosamine on intestinal epithelial cells, we examined the effects of glucosamine on the activation of a human colonic epithelial cell line HT-29. The results revealed that glucosamine suppressed the IL-8 production and ICAM-1 expression by TNF-alpha-activated HT-29 cells. Furthermore, glucosamine inhibited the TNF-alpha-induced phosphorylation of p38MAPK and NF-kappaB p65, and the nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB in the cells. Thus, glucosamine demonstrates inhibitory actions on the inflammatory and signaling molecules (IL-8, ICAM-1, p38MAPK and NF-kappaB) in intestinal epithelial cells. However, glucosamine did not essentially affect the binding of TNF-alpha to its receptor on HT-29 cells. Together, these observations suggest that glucosamine may have the potential to exhibit an anti-inflammatory action on intestinal epithelial cells, by possibly interfering with the activation signaling downstream of the ligand/receptor binding.
Glucocorticoid receptors (GRs) affect both gene induction and gene repression. The disparities of receptor binding to DNA and increased vs. decreased gene expression have suggested significant mechanistic differences between GR-mediated induction and repression. Numerous transcription factors are known to modulate three parameters of gene induction: the total activity (Vmax) and position of the dose-response curve with glucocorticoids (EC50) and the percent partial agonist activity with antiglucocorticoids. We have examined the effects on GR-mediated repression of five modulators (coactivators TIF2 [GRIP1, SRC-2] and SRC-1, corepressor SMRT, and comodulators STAMP and Ubc9), a glucocorticoid steroid (deacylcortivazol [DAC]) of very different structure, and an inhibitor of histone deacetylation (trichostatin A [TSA]). These factors interact with different domains of GR and thus are sensitive topological probes of GR action. These agents altered the Vmax, EC50, and percent partial agonist activity of endogenous and exogenous repressed genes similarly to that previously observed for GR-regulated gene induction. Collectively, these results suggest that GR-mediated induction and repression share many of the same molecular interactions and that the causes for different levels of gene transcription arise from more distal downstream steps.
A variety of studies have documented alterations in 5-HT1A receptor binding sites in the brain of subjects with major depressive disorder (MDD). The recently identified transcription factor, nuclear deformed epidermal autoregulatory factor (NUDR/Deaf-1) has been shown to function as a transcriptional modulator of the human 5-HT1A receptor gene. The present study was undertaken to document the regional and cellular localization of NUDR in the human prefrontal cortex and to examine the levels of NUDR and 5-HT1A receptor protein in prefrontal cortex of female and male depressed and control subjects. NUDR immunoreactivity was present in neurons and glia across cortical layers and was co-localized with 5-HT1A receptor immunoreactive neurons. NUDR immunoreactivity as measured by Western blot was significantly decreased in the prefrontal cortex of female depressed subjects (42%, p=0.02) and unchanged in male depressed subjects relative to gender-matched control subjects. Similarly, 5-HT1A receptor protein level was significantly reduced in the prefrontal cortex of female depressed subjects (46%, p=0.03) and unchanged in male depressed subjects compared to gender-matched control subjects. Reduced protein expression of NUDR in the prefrontal cortex of female subjects with MDD may reflect a functional alteration in this transcription factor, which may contribute to the decrease in 5-HT1A receptors observed in the same female subjects with MDD. In addition, the gender-specific alterations in cortical NUDR and 5-HT1A receptor proteins could represent an underlying biological mechanism associated with the higher incidence of depression in women.
Interleukin (IL)-1 is a major contributor to inflammation and apoptosis during ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury. Its deleterious effects are primarily mediated by the activation of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB). Receptor-binding and signaling of IL-1 can be blocked by the IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra). The aim of our study was to characterize effects and mechanisms of IL-1ra administration on inflammation, apoptosis, and infiltration in renal I/R injury. Renal ischemia was induced in Lewis rats by clamping of the left renal artery for 45 min. Kidneys were removed for histological and molecular analysis 24 h or 5 days after reperfusion. IL-1ra ameliorated I/R induced renal injury and inflammation. Furthermore, the number of apoptotic tubular cells was lower in IL-1ra-treated animals 24 h after ischemia, which was paralleled by a Bax/Bcl-2 mRNA ratio towards anti-apoptotic effects. IL-1ra reduced the expression of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) mRNA at 24 h and 5 days and that of intracellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) expression at 24 h in the ischemic reperfused kidneys. Our results indicate that IL-1ra treatment ameliorates renal I/R injury and this protective effect might be mediated by reduced induction of NF-kappaB mediated MCP-1, ICAM-1, and a decreased ratio between Bax and Bcl-2 mRNA expression.
The vitamin D hormone, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) [1,25(OH)(2)D(3)], binds with high affinity to the nuclear vitamin D receptor (VDR), which recruits its retinoid X receptor (RXR) heterodimeric partner to recognize vitamin D responsive elements (VDREs) in target genes. 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) is known primarily as a regulator of calcium, but it also controls phosphate (re)absorption at the intestine and kidney. Fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) is a phosphaturic hormone produced in osteoblasts that, like PTH, lowers serum phosphate by inhibiting renal reabsorption through Npt2a/Npt2c. Real-time PCR and reporter gene transfection assays were used to probe VDR-mediated transcriptional control by 1,25(OH)(2)D(3). Reporter gene and mammalian two-hybrid transfections, plus competitive receptor binding assays, were used to discover novel VDR ligands. 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) induces FGF23 78-fold in osteoblasts, and because FGF23 in turn represses 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) synthesis, a reciprocal relationship is established, with FGF23 indirectly curtailing 1,25(OH)(2)D(3)-mediated intestinal absorption and counterbalancing renal reabsorption of phosphate, thereby reversing hyperphosphatemia and preventing ectopic calcification. Therefore, a 1,25(OH)(2)D(3)-FGF23 axis regulating phosphate is comparable in importance to the 1,25(OH)(2)D(3)-PTH axis that regulates calcium. 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) also elicits regulation of LRP5, Runx2, PHEX, TRPV6, and Npt2c, all anabolic toward bone, and RANKL, which is catabolic. Regulation of mouse RANKL by 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) supports a cloverleaf model, whereby VDR-RXR heterodimers bound to multiple VDREs are juxtapositioned through chromatin looping to form a supercomplex, potentially allowing simultaneous interactions with multiple co-modulators and chromatin remodeling enzymes. VDR also selectively binds certain omega3/omega6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) with low affinity, leading to transcriptionally active VDR-RXR complexes. Moreover, the turmeric-derived polyphenol, curcumin, activates transcription of a VDRE reporter construct in human colon cancer cells. Activation of VDR by PUFAs and curcumin may elicit unique, 1,25(OH)(2)D(3)-independent signaling pathways to orchestrate the bioeffects of these lipids in intestine, bone, skin/hair follicle, and other VDR-containing tissues.
Members of the corticoliberin family include the corticotropin releasing factors (CRFs), sauvagine, the urotensins, and urocortin 1 (Ucn1), which bind to both the CRF receptors CRF-R1 and CRF-R2, and the urocortins 2 (Ucn2) and 3 (Ucn3), which are selective agonists of CRF-R2. Structure activity relationship studies led to several potent and long-acting analogues with selective binding to either one of the receptors. NMR structures of six ligands of this family (the antagonists astressin B and astressin2-B, the agonists stressin1, and the natural ligands human Ucn1, Ucn2, and Ucn3) were determined in DMSO. These six peptides show differences in binding affinities, receptor-selectivity, and NMR structure. Overall, their backbones are alpha-helical, with a small kink or a turn around residues 25-27, resulting in a helix-loop-helix motif. The C-terminal helices are of amphipathic nature, whereas the N-terminal helices vary in their amphipathicity. The C-terminal helices thereby assume a conformation very similar to that of astressin bound to the ECD1 of CRF-R2 recently reported by our group.1 On the basis of an analysis of the observed 3D structures and relative potencies of [Ala]-substituted analogues, it is proposed that both helices could play a crucial role in receptor binding and selectivity. In conclusion, the C-terminal helices may interact along their hydrophobic faces with the ECD1, whereas the entire N-terminal helical surface may be involved in receptor activation. On the basis of the common and divergent features observed in the 3D structures of these ligands, multiple binding models are proposed that may explain their plurality of actions.
Glucocorticoids (GCs) are well-known anti-inflammatory drugs inhibiting prostaglandin production. Paradoxically, GCs are reported to stimulate cytosolic phosphoplipase A2 group IVA (PLA2G4A) and prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2 (PTGS2) expression in human amnion fibroblasts. This study was designed to examine the molecular mechanisms underlying glucocorticoid-induced PLA2G4A expression in human amnion fibroblasts. Our data showed that cortisol (0.01 approximately 1 microM) increased PLA2G4A mRNA level in a dose-dependent manner in human amnion fibroblasts, which was blocked by glucocorticoid receptor antagonist RU486 (1 microM) as well as by the mRNA transcription inhibitor 5,6-dichlorobenzimidazole riboside (DRB; 75 microM). Concurrently, cortisol (0.01 approximately 1 microM) decreased rather than increased proinflammatory cytokine mRNA levels, including interleukin 1 beta (IL1B), interleukin 6 (IL6), and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF), in a dose-dependent manner in human amnion fibroblasts. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay revealed that glucocorticoid receptor was bound to PLA2G4A promoter in human amnion fibroblasts upon cortisol stimulation. This was confirmed by electrophoretic mobility shift assay showing that nuclear protein extracted from human amnion fibroblasts upon cortisol stimulation could bind the synthesized oligonucleotide sequence corresponding to PLA2G4A promoter region from -95 bp to -65 bp bearing the putative glucocorticoid response element. This binding was super shifted by glucocorticoid receptor antibody. In conclusion, we demonstrated in this study that cortisol increased PLA2G4A mRNA level via GR-dependent ongoing transcription in human amnion fibroblasts by activating the binding of GR to PLA2G4A promoter directly, and this effect appeared unlikely to be secondary to the effect of cortisol on the expression of proinflammatory cytokines in human amnion fibroblasts.
The cellular binding and processing of an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) targeting affibody molecule, (Z(EGFR:955))(2), was studied. This new and small molecule is aimed for applications in nuclear medicine. The natural ligand epidermal growth factor (EGF) and the antibody cetuximab were studied for comparison.
All experiments were made with cultured A431 squamous carcinoma cells. Receptor specificity, binding time patterns, retention and preliminary receptor binding site localization studies were all made after (125)I labeling. Internalization was studied using Oregon Green 488, Alexa Fluor 488 and CypHer5E markers.
[(125)I](Z(EGFR:955))(2) and [(125)I]cetuximab gave a maximum cellular uptake of (125)I within 4 to 8 h of incubation, while [(125)I]EGF gave a maximum uptake already after 2 h. The retention studies showed that the cell-associated fraction of (125)I after 48 h of incubation was approximately 20% when delivered as [(125)I](Z(EGFR:955))(2) and approximately 25% when delivered as [(125)I]cetuximab. [(125)I]EGF-mediated delivery gave a faster (125)I release, where almost all cell-associated radioactivity had disappeared within 24 h. All three substances were internalized as demonstrated with confocal microscopy. Competitive binding studies showed that both EGF and cetuximab inhibited binding of (Z(EGFR:955))(2) and indicated that the three substances competed for an overlapping binding site.
The results gave information on cellular processing of radionuclides when delivered with (Z(EGFR:955))(2) in comparison to delivery with EGF and cetuximab. Competition assays suggested that [(125)I](Z(EGFR:955))(2) bind to Domain III of EGFR. The affibody molecule (Z(EGFR:955))(2) can be a candidate for EGFR imaging applications in nuclear medicine.
The genetic predisposition of the host and the virus is the most important determinant for prediction of the course of human immunodeficiency virus type I (HIV-1) viral infection and acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) progression. Transcription from the HIV-1 long terminal repeat (LTR) is a crucial step for viral replication. Here, we describe a stimulatory role of the vitamin D receptor (VDR) on HIV-1 LTR transactivation. Transient transfections reveal that VDR activates the LTR in HeLa, U937, and Cos-1 cells in a ligand-dependent manner. 1alpha,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D3 (vitD3) promotes activation of a minimal LTR construct (from nucleotides -35 to +89), lacking a previously described hormone response element that binds several nuclear receptors. NF-kappaB (nuclear factor-kappa B) and Sp1-binding sites, which are responsible for most basal LTR activity in HeLa cells, are also dispensable for vitD3-dependent HIV-1 transcription. Although the tat response element element is not required for VDR-mediated HIV-1 gene expression, the viral protein Tat acts in a synergistic manner with the receptor to stimulate LTR activity. Furthermore, our data also show cooperation of the receptor with various cellular coactivators for HIV-1 transactivation by vitD3. Paradoxically, mutations in the VDR ligand-dependent transcriptional activation function-2 that abrogate vitD3-dependent stimulation through classical vitamin D response elements, do not reduce vitD3-mediated LTR transactivation. Furthermore, point mutations in the DNA-binding domain that abolish receptor binding to consensus DNA sequences do not affect ligand-dependent HIV-1 stimulation. These results show that VDR activates the HIV-1 LTR through different mechanisms, including non-classical nuclear receptor transcriptional actions that may ensure viral transcription under different physiological scenarios.
Nuclear receptor coregulator (NRC) is a 250-kDa nuclear protein involved in transcriptional activation of nuclear hormone receptors, nuclear factor-kappaB, c-Jun, c-Fos, and cAMP response element-binding protein. NRC is organized into a modular structure consisting of two activation domains (AD1 and AD2), two nuclear hormone receptor-interacting motifs, LxxLL-1 and LxxLL-2, and a C-terminal regulatory region rich in serines, threonines, and leucines. The LxxLL-1 motif of NRC binds to a broad spectrum of nuclear hormone receptors with high affinity whereas LxxLL-2 interacts with a very limited number of receptors. In this study we present further evidence that NRC can act as a dimer and have identified a dimerization region of 146 amino acids including LxxLL-1. Mutation of the core LxxLL-1 motif, however, indicates that it is not involved in the dimerization of NRC. AD2, just C-terminal of LxxLL-1, was found to play a central role in ligand-dependent activation by nuclear receptors even though AD1 exhibits more potent intrinsic activity. Thus, a short region of approximately 300 amino acids including and flanking LxxLL-1 plays an important role in NRC dimerization and nuclear receptor binding and transcriptional activation. In addition, consistent with its role as a cointegrator for transcriptional activation, NRC also functions as a coactivator for signal transducer and activator of transcription 2 (STAT-2) and p53. Activation of p53 by NRC appears to involve a novel mechanism where NRC interacts indirectly with p53 through Trap80, a member of the mediator complex, which binds NRC interacting factor-1 (NIF-1), which interacts with and potentiates the effect of NRC.
The understanding and analysis of protein associations in living cells is a major goal of molecular biology. Here, we describe an assay for the analysis of protein-protein interactions based on the co-localization of a fused site-specific protease with a cleavable reporter in close proximity to the interaction partner under examination. We exemplified this scheme in the temperature-sensitive Saccharomyces cerevisiae cdc25-2 mutant strain using the nuclear inclusion protease of tobacco etch virus fused to the adaptor protein growth factor receptor binding protein 2 (Grb2). The growth-defective phenotype of cdc25-2 was complemented by expression of a membrane-targeted constitutively active Ras protein, which contained a TEV protease substrate sequence allowing for release from the membrane upon proteolysis. Interaction of Grb2 with the membrane-targeted intracellular domain of the oncogene vErbB resulted in co-localization of the TEV protease with its substrate, release of Ras from the membrane and restoration of the temperature-sensitive phenotype of cdc25-2. The flexibility of the general scheme of this approach may allow for its application in many different assay scenarios and may represent a suitable alternative in cases where other approaches fail.
It has been shown that the balance between vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), a major angiogenic stimulator, and pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF), a potent angiogenic inhibitor, is critical for the regulation of vascular permeability and angiogenesis. However, the regulation of the balance is largely unclear. The present study demonstrated that there is a reciprocal interaction between VEGF and PEDF in the retina. PEDF significantly decreased VEGF expression in both retinal capillary endothelial cells (RCEC) and Müller cells. This PEDF effect was confirmed in the retina of rats with oxygen-induced retinopathy. Silencing of the PEDF gene by siRNA in Müller cells resulted in a significant upregulation of VEGF expression at both the RNA and protein levels, suggesting that PEDF is an endogenous negative regulator of VEGF. The further study of the mechanism showed that PEDF inhibited hypoxia-induced increases in VEGF promoter activity, HIF-1 nuclear translocation and mitogen activated protein kinase phosphorylation. These results suggest that PEDF inhibits VEGF expression at the transcriptional level. In addition, PEDF effectively inhibited VEGF binding to RCEC. Moreover, in vitro receptor-binding assay demonstrated that PEDF competed with VEGF for binding to VEGF receptor 2, which may represent a new mechanism for PEDF activity. On the other hand, VEGF significantly downregulated PEDF expression in RCEC, but not in retinal Müller cells, suggesting a VEGF receptor-mediated process. These results suggest that the reciprocal regulation between VEGF and PEDF may play a role in angiogenic control. The decrease in PEDF levels in the retina is at least partially responsible for the increase in VEGF expression and subsequent vascular leakage and neovascularization in diabetes.
The Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase is the causative factor in most chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) patients. We have shown that Bcr-Abl is associated with a cluster of signaling proteins, including Janus kinase (Jak) 2, growth factor receptor binding protein 2-associated binder (Gab) 2, Akt, and glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)-3beta. Treatment of CML cell lines and mouse Bcr-Abl+ 32D cells with either Jak2 short interfering RNA or Jak2 kinase inhibitor AG490 inhibited pTyr Gab2 and pSer Akt formation, inhibited the activation of nuclear factor-kappaB, and caused the activation of GSK-3beta, leading to the reduction of c-Myc. Importantly, BaF3 cells expressing T315I and E255K imatinib-resistant mutants of Bcr-Abl underwent apoptosis on exposure to AG490 yet were resistant to imatinib. Similar to wild-type Bcr-Abl+ cells, inhibition of Jak2 by Ag490 treatment resulted in decrease of pSer Akt and c-Myc in imatinib-resistant cells. These results identify Jak2 as a potentially important therapeutic target for CML.
The H19/Igf2 imprinting control region (ICR) is a DNA methylation-dependent chromatin insulator in somatic cells. The hypomethylated maternally inherited ICR binds the insulator protein CTCF at four sites, and blocks activity of the proximal Igf2 promoter by insulating it from the shared distal enhancers. The hypermethylated paternally inherited ICR lacks CTCF binding and insulator activity, but induces methylation-silencing of the paternal H19 promoter. The paternal-specific methylation of the ICR is established in the male germ cells, while the ICR emerges from the female germ line in an unmethylated form. Despite several attempts to find cis-regulatory elements, it is still unknown what determines these male and female germ cell-specific epigenetic modifications. We recently proposed that five in vivo footprints spanning fifteen half nuclear hormone receptor (NHR) binding sites within the ICR might be involved, and here we report on the effects of mutagenizing all of these half sites in mice. No effect was obtained--in the female and male germ lines the mutant ICR remained hypomethylated and hypermethylated, respectively. The ICR imprinting mechanism remains undefined.
Beta-1--&gt;3-D-glucans represent a pathogen-associated molecular pattern and are able to modify biological responses. Employing a comprehensive methodological approach, the aim of our in vitro study was to elucidate novel molecular and cellular mechanisms of human peripheral blood immune cells mediated by a fungal beta-1--&gt;3-D-glucan, i.e. glucan phosphate, in the presence of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or toxic shock syndrome toxin 1 (TSST-1).
Despite an activation of nuclear factor (NF) kappaB, NFinterleukin(IL)-6 and NFAT similar to LPS or TSST-1, we observed no significant production of IL-1beta, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor alpha or interferon gamma induced by glucan phosphate. Glucan phosphate-treated leukocytes induced a substantial amount of IL-8 (peak at 18 h: 5000 pg/ml), likely due to binding of NFkappaB to a consensus site in the IL-8 promoter. An increase in IL-1receptor antagonist (RA) production (peak at 24 h: 12000 pg/ml) by glucan phosphate-treated cells positively correlated with IL-8 levels. Glucan phosphate induced significant binding to a known NFIL-6 site and a new NFAT site within the IL-1RA promoter, which was confirmed by inhibition experiments. When applied in combination with either LPS or TSST-1 at the same time points, we detected that glucan phosphate elevated the LPS- and the TSST-1-induced DNA binding of NFkappaB, NFIL-6 and NFAT, leading to a synergistic increase of IL-1RA. Further, glucan phosphate modulated the TSST-1-induced inflammatory response via reduction of IL-1beta and IL-6. As a consequence, glucan phosphate shifted the TSST-1-induced IL-1beta/IL-1RA ratio towards an anti-inflammatory phenotype. Subsequently, glucan phosphate decreased the TSST-1-induced, IL-1-dependent production of IL-2.
Thus, beta-1--&gt;3-D-glucans may induce beneficial effects in the presence of pro-inflammatory responses, downstream of receptor binding and signaling by switching a pro- to an anti-inflammatory IL-1RA-mediated reaction. Our results also offer new insights into the complex regulation of the IL-1RA gene, which can be modulated by a beta-1--&gt;3-D-glucan.
We tested the effects of several combinations of bait and fish components of the yeast two-hybrid detection system for estrogenic activity. A combination of the full-length human estrogen receptor alpha with the nuclear receptor-binding domain of co-activator steroid receptor co-activator-1 (SRC-1) or transcriptional intermediate factor-2 (TIF-2) was most effective for estrogen-dependent induction of the chromosome-integrated UAS(GAL)-CYC1(p)-lacZ reporter construct among the two-hybrid systems so far tested.
To search for novel transcriptional pathways that are activated in skeletal muscle after endurance exercise, we used cDNA microarrays to measure global mRNA expression after an exhaustive bout of high-intensity cycling (approximately 75 min). Healthy, young, sedentary males performed the cycling bout, and skeletal muscle biopsies were taken from the vastus lateralis before, and at 3 and 48 h after exercise. We examined mRNA expression in individual muscle samples from four subjects using cDNA microarrays, used repeated-measures significance analysis of microarray (SAM) to determine statistically significant expression changes, and confirmed selected results using real-time RT-PCR. In total, the expression of 118 genes significantly increased 3 h postcycling and 8 decreased. At 48 h, the expression of 29 genes significantly increased and 5 decreased. Many of these are potentially important novel genes involved in exercise recovery and adaptation, including several involved in 1) metabolism and mitochondrial biogenesis (FOXO1, PPARdelta, PPARgamma, nuclear receptor binding protein 2, IL-6 receptor, ribosomal protein L2, aminolevulinate delta-synthase 2); 2) the oxidant stress response (metalothioneins 1B, 1F, 1G, 1H, 1L, 2A, 3, interferon regulatory factor 1); and 3) electrolyte transport across membranes [Na+-K+-ATPase (beta3), SERCA3, chloride channel 4]. Others include genes involved in cell stress, proteolysis, apoptosis, growth, differentiation, and transcriptional activation, as well as all three nuclear receptor subfamily 4A family members (Nur77, Nurr1, and Nor1). This study is the first to characterize global mRNA expression during recovery from endurance exercise, and the results provide potential insight into 1) the transcriptional contributions to homeostatic recovery in human skeletal muscle after endurance exercise, and 2) the transcriptional contributions from a single bout of endurance exercise to the adaptive processes that occur after a period of endurance exercise training.
Transcriptional activation of the gene coding for the neuropeptide hormone oxytocin by oestrogens does not follow the classical model of oestrogen receptor action. The oxytocin promoter does not contain an oestrogen response element (ERE), but instead a high-affinity binding site for nuclear orphan receptors. In the present study, the oestrogen-dependent up-regulation of the bovine oxytocin promoter is investigated in MDA-MB 231 cells. Control by oestrogen is shown to be dependent on the integrity of the nuclear orphan receptor binding site and the presence of ligand-activated oestrogen receptor, but independent of oestrogen receptor binding to DNA. Partial agonists tamoxifen and raloxifen and the pure antagonist ICI 182 780 all show agonistic activities on transcription, while exhibiting normal binding affinities to oestrogen receptor (ER)alpha. Nuclear orphan receptors oestrogen receptor-related receptor alpha (ERRalpha) and germ cell nuclear factor (GCNF) are expressed to significant levels in MDA-MB 231 cells. Binding of ERRalpha to the oxytocin promoter binding site can be demonstrated, suggesting the involvement of this nuclear orphan receptor in oestrogen-dependent up-regulation. The oestrogenic stimulation of the oxytocin promoter apparently is dependent on the stimulation of the transcriptional activity of this nuclear orphan receptor by ERK-1/ERK-2 mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAP kinases). This novel nonclassical mechanism of oestrogen action most probably is not restricted to the regulation of neuropeptide hormone expression, but may further contribute to the multitude of tissue-specific effects of oestrogenic substances.
We previously reported that tumor necrosis factor alpha receptor- and Fas-associated FLASH interacts with one of the p160 nuclear receptor coactivators, glucocorticoid receptor-interacting protein (GRIP) 1, at its nuclear receptor-binding (NRB) domain, and that inhibits the transcriptional activity of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) by interfering with association of GR and GRIP1. Here, we further examined the specificity of FLASH suppressive effect and the physical/functional interactions between this protein and two other p160 family subtypes. The suppressive effect of FLASH on GR transactivation was observed in several cell lines and on the chromatin-integrated mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) promoter. FLASH strongly interacted with the NRB domain of the thyroid hormone receptor activator molecule (TRAM) 1, a member of the steroid hormone receptor coactivator (SRC) 3/nuclear receptor coactivator (N-CoA) 3 subtypes, as well as with SRC2/N-CoA2 p160 coactivator GRIP1, while its interaction with SRC1a, one of the SRC1/N-CoA1 proteins, was faint in yeast two-hybrid assays. Accordingly, FLASH strongly suppressed TRAM1- and GRIP1-induced enhancement of GR-stimulated transactivation of the MMTV promoter in HCT116 cells, while it did not affect SRC1a-induced potentiation of transcription. Furthermore, FLASH suppressed androgen- and progesterone receptor-induced transcriptional activity, but did not influence estrogen receptor-induced transactivation, possibly due to their preferential use of p160 coactivators in HCT116 and HeLa cells. Thus, FLASH differentially suppresses steroid hormone receptor-induced transcriptional activity by interfering with their association with SRC2/N-CoA2 and SRC3/N-CoA3 but not with SRC1/N-CoA1.
To protect the hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) from apoptosis induced by chemotherapy and promote HSC proliferation, bi-functional gene delivery systems are increasingly investigated in gene therapy. In the present study, we constructed a bicistronic vector, pWISG, expressing the anti-apoptotic protein human WEE1 (WEE1Hu) and the fusion protein of the proliferation-stimulating stem cell factor (SCF) and enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) separately with internal ribosome entry site (IRES). We first examined the expression and location of WEE1Hu in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells and showed that WEE1Hu was located in the nucleus, which was confirmed by immunohistochemistry and Western blot. We determined the expression and receptor-binding ability of the SCF-EGFP fusion protein on CD34+ cells, which were proved by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and flow cytometry, respectively. Furthermore, inhibition of cisplatin-induced apoptosis was observed in CD34+ cells transfected with pWISG, which implies that protection for CD34+ cells was achieved via WEE1Hu and SCF-EGFP. Our study suggests that the introduction of two functional genes via bicistronic vector is more powerful and efficient than single gene therapy.
The human ovarian surface epithelium (HOSE) is a common site of gynaecological disease including endometriosis and ovarian cancer, probably due to serial injury-repair events associated with successive ovulations. To comprehend the importance of steroid signalling in the regulation of the HOSE, we used a custom microarray to catalogue the expression of over 250 genes involved in the synthesis and reception of steroid hormones, sterols and retinoids. The array included a subset of non-steroidogenic genes commonly involved in pro-/anti-inflammatory signalling. HOSE cells donated by five patients undergoing surgery for non-malignant gynaecological conditions were cultured for 48 h in the presence and absence of 500 pg/ml interleukin-1alpha (IL-1alpha). Total RNA was reverse-transcribed into biotin-labelled cDNA, which was hybridised to the array and visualised by gold-particle resonance light scattering and charge-coupled device (CCD) camera detection. Results for selected genes were verified by quantitative reverse-transcription PCR. In five out of five cases, untreated HOSE cells expressed genes encoding enzymes required for de novo biosynthesis of cholesterol from acetate and subsequent formation of C21-pregnane and C19-androstane steroids. Consistent with the inability of HOSE cells to synthesise glucocorticoids, oestrogens or 5alpha-reduced androgens de novo, CYP21, CYP19 and 5alpha-reductase were not detected. The only steroidogenic gene significantly up-regulated by IL-1alpha was 11beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11betaHSD1). Other cytokine-induced genes were IL-6, IL-8, nuclear factor kappaB (NFkappaB) inhibitor alpha, metallothionein-IIA and lysyl oxidase: inflammation-associated genes that respond to glucocorticoids. The only steroidogenic gene significantly suppressed by IL-1alpha was 3betaHSD1. Other genes suppressed by IL-1alpha were aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) 1, ALDH 10, gonadotrophin hormone-releasing hormone receptor, peroxisome proliferation-activated receptor-binding protein (PPAR-bp) and nuclear receptor subfamily 2 group F member 2. These results define a steroidogenic phenotype of cultured HOSE cells and provide a limited expression profile for genes with associated signalling functions. IL-1alpha co-ordinately induces 11betaHSD1 and a panel of glucocorticoid-regulated, inflammation-associated genes in HOSE cells, providing further evidence that cortisol generated by 11betaHSD1 could participate in the local resolution of inflammation associated with ovulation.
Mitochondrial glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (mGPDH) is an essential component of the glycerol phosphate shuttle that transfers reduction equivalents from the cytosol into the mitochondrion. Within the testis, immunohistological analysis localized human mGPDH to late spermatids and to the midpiece of spermatozoa. The expression of human mGPDH is regulated by two somatic promoters, and here, we describe a third testis-specific promoter of human mGPDH. The usage of this testis-specific promoter correlates with the expression of a shortened mGPDH transcript of approximately 2.4 kb in length, which is solely detectable from testicular RNA. Within the testis-specific promoter, we detected a cAMP-response element (CRE) site at -51, which binds the testis-specific transcriptional activator CRE modulator tau (CREMtau) in electrophoretic mobility shift assays. This recognition site overlaps with a nuclear receptor binding half-site at -49, which binds the testis-specific transcriptional repressor germ cell nuclear factor (GCNF). Both factors compete for binding to the same DNA response element. Ectopic expression of CREMtau in HepG2 cells activated a promoter-driven luciferase construct in transient transfection experiments. Additional cotransfection of GCNF relieved this activity, suggesting a down-regulation of CREMtau-mediated activation by GCNF. This effect was preserved by introducing the CRE/nuclear receptor-binding element into a heterologous promoter context. Our data suggest a down-regulation of CREMtau-mediated gene expression by GCNF, which might be a general regulation mechanism for several postmeiotically expressed genes with a temporal expression peak during early spermatid development.
Liver X receptor beta (LXRbeta) is a ligand dependent transcription factor that is a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily. LXRbeta and its isoform LXRalpha have recently been recognized as important regulators of lipid homeostasis in vertebrates. N-terminally hexahistidine-tagged rat LXRbeta was expressed in Escherichia coli as a full-length protein and purified in two chromatographic steps, immobilized metal affinity chromatography and gel filtration. From 10g of bacterial cells, 2.5mg of protein was recovered. The purified LXRbeta is functional with respect to ligand-, DNA-, and coactivator-binding. The synthetic ligand T0901317 bound to LXRbeta with high affinity yielding a K(d) of 2.7nM. Specific interaction with DR4 response elements, in the presence of RXR, was demonstrated with electrophoretic mobility shift assay. Furthermore, surface plasmon resonance analysis of LXRbeta binding to coactivator peptides revealed a ligand dependent interaction with the C-terminal nuclear receptor binding site of the coactivator RAP250. The purified LXRbeta constitutes an important tool for further functional and structural studies.
Our goal was to design and manufacture a kit under good manufacturing practices (GMP) for the preparation of (111)In-DTPA-hEGF Injection, a novel targeted radiotherapeutic agent for advanced epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-positive breast cancer.
Human EGF (hEGF) was derivatized with diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA) and then purified by size-exclusion chromatography and ultrafiltration. Kits were prepared by dispensing 0.25 mg (1 mL) of DTPA-hEGF in 1 mol/L sodium acetate buffer [pH 6.0] into single-dose glass vials. Raw materials were pharmacopoieal or reagent grade according to the American Chemical Society and were tested for identity and purity. Kits were tested for protein concentration, purity and homogeneity (sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and size-exclusion high-performance liquid chromatography), pH, clarity and color, volume, DTPA substitution, labeling efficiency, receptor binding to MDA-MB-468 human breast cancer cells, and sterility and apyrogenicity. (111)In-DTPA-hEGF Injection was tested for pH, radionuclidic and radiochemical purity, clarity and color, and sterility and apyrogenicity.
Four lots of kits and 8 lots of (111)In-DTPA-hEGF Injection passed all quality specifications. The labeling efficiency was 94%-99% with 115-773 MBq (111)In chloride added to a single kit. (111)In-DTPA-hEGF exhibited preserved receptor binding against MDA-MB-468 cells (affinity constant [K(a)], 0.9-1.1 x 10(7) L/mol; maximum number of binding sites per cell [B(max)], 1.1-2.2 x 10(6) sites per cell). In addition, labeling of aliquots of the kit suggested that a single vial could be labeled with up to 3,083 MBq (111)In while maintaining a radiochemical purity of &gt;90%. Kits were stable for &gt;90 d and (111)In-DTPA-hEGF Injection was stable for &gt;24 h stored at 4 degrees C.
The kit formulation is suitable for preparing (111)In-DTPA-hEGF Injection for a phase I clinical trial in patients with advanced EGFR-positive breast cancer. Establishment of the GMP processes for (111)In-DTPA-hEGF Injection provides a useful example of manufacturing biotechnology-based investigational radiopharmaceuticals in an academic environment for early phase I clinical trials.
TRIF [TIR (Toll/interleukin-1 receptor) domain-containing adaptor protein inducing interferon beta; also known as TICAM-1 (TIR-containing adaptor molecule-1)] is a key adaptor for TLR3 (Toll-like receptor 3)- and TLR4-mediated signalling. We have performed a detailed annotation of the human TRIF gene and fine analysis of the basal and inducible promoter elements lying 5' to the site of initiation of transcription. Human TRIF maps to chromosome 19p13.3 and is flanked upstream by TIP47, which encodes the mannose 6-phosphate receptor binding protein, and downstream by a gene encoding FEM1a, a human homologue of the Caenorhabditis elegans Feminisation-1 gene. Using promoter-reporter deletion constructs, we identified a distal region with the ability to negatively regulate basal transcription and a proximal region containing an Sp1 (stimulating protein 1) site that confers approx. 75% of basal transcriptional activity. TRIF expression can be induced by multiple stimuli, such as the ligands for TLR2, TLR3 and TLR4, and by the pro-inflammatory cytokines tumour necrosis factor alpha and interleukin-1alpha. All of these stimuli act via an NF-kappaB (nuclear factor-kappaB) motif at position -127. In spite of the presence of a STAT1 (signal transduction and activators of transcription 1) motif at position -330, the addition of type I or type II interferon had no effect on TRIF activity. The human TRIF gene would therefore appear to be regulated primarily by NF-kappaB.
Ricin induced apoptotic nuclear morphological changes in mouse macrophage cell line RAW264.7 cells at concentrations sufficient to cause severe protein synthesis inhibition. Ricin also induced the release of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) from this cell line in a dose-dependent manner but the profile was bell-shaped. However, the isolated galactose-specific ricin B-chain had no such effects. These results suggest that the receptor-binding of ricin through the B-chain is not enough, and subsequent attack on the intracellular target, i.e., the 28S ribosomal RNA (rRNA), by the A-chain of internalized ricin is required for the effects of ricin. Z-D-CH2-DCB, a caspase family inhibitor, showed potent inhibition of the release of TNF-alpha from RAW264.7 cells as well as blockage of the induction of apoptosis by ricin. Furthermore, SB202190, a specific P38 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase inhibitor that strongly inhibits the release of TNF-alpha, also showed significant inhibition of ricin-induced apoptosis. These results suggest that there may be cross-talk between the pathways leading to the release of TNF-alpha and apoptosis. Time course analysis revealed that the activation of p38 MAP kinase started prior to the induction of TNF-alpha release and apoptosis. Since the activation of p38 MAP kinase in ricin-treated RAW264.7 cells was not prevented by Z-D-CH2-DCB, the activation of p38 MAP kinase may occur upstream of the caspase cascade. Among the other protein synthesis inhibitors examined, modeccin and anisomycin, which can trigger a ribotoxic stress response similar to ricin, induced the release of TNF-alpha, but emetine and cycloheximide did not. These results suggest that the specific attack on the 28S ribosomal RNA and the resulting ribotoxic stress response may trigger the multiple signal transduction pathways through the activation of p38 MAP kinase, which in turn leads to TNF-alpha release and apoptosis.
This study presents data suggesting that both human mesothelioma (cell lines and human mesothelioma biopsies) and human normal mesothelial cells express receptors for acetylcholine and that stimulation of these receptors by nicotine prompted cell growth via activation of nicotinic cholinergic receptors. Thus, these data demonstrate that: (a) human mesothelioma cells and human biopsies of mesothelioma as well as of normal pleural mesothelial cells express functionally alpha-7 nicotinic acethlycholine receptors, evaluated by alpha-bungarotoxin-FITC binding, receptor binding assay, Western blot, and reverse transcription-PCR; (b) choline acetyltransferase immunostaining is present in mesothelioma cells; (c) mesothelioma cell growth is modulated by the cholinergic system in which agonists (i.e., nicotine) has a proliferative effect, and antagonists (i.e., curare) has an inhibitory effect, evaluated by cell cloning, DNA synthesis and cell cycle; (d) nicotine induces Ca(+2) influx, evaluated by [(45)Ca(2+)] uptake, and consequently activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway (extracellular signal-regulated kinase and p90(RSK) phosphorylation), evaluated by Western blot; and (e) apoptosis mechanisms in mesothelioma cells are under the control of the cholinergic system (nicotine antiapoptotic via induction of nuclear factor-kappaB complexes and phosphorylation of Bad at Ser(112); curare proapoptotic via G(0)-G(1) arrest p21(waf-1) dependent but p53 independent). The involvement of the nonneuronal cholinergic system in mesothelioma appears reasonable and open up new therapeutic strategies.
This study was designed to examine the presence and role of the opioid growth factor (OGF, [Met(5)]-enkephalin) and the OGF receptor (OGFr) in COS-7 cells; these cells lack classical opioid receptors. Preproenkephalin mRNA, which encodes OGF, was detected by Northern blot analysis, and OGFr mRNA was recorded by RT-PCR. Receptor binding analysis showed specific and saturable binding (K(d)=3.5nm, B(max)=44fmol/mg protein) for OGFr in the nuclear fraction. Both OGF and OGFr were recorded in COS-7 cells by immunocytochemistry. Addition of OGF to log-phase COS-7 cultures depressed growth by 41.6% from control levels, whereas opioid-receptor blockade by the opioid antagonist, naltrexone, increased the number of cells by 29.8% from control values. The effect of OGF was receptor mediated. Exposure to a wide variety of synthetic and natural opioid peptides, including those selective for micro, delta, and kappa opioid receptors, showed that only OGF had an effect. Treatment with antisense OGFr oligonucleotides increased the number of cells by over 2-fold compared to wild-type cultures of COS-7 cells and preparations receiving scrambled oligonucleotides. These results indicate that the OGF-OGFr axis is present and functions in COS-7 cells, and in the absence of classical opioid receptors.
Autocrine expression of interleukin (IL)-6 by transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) in response to bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) may have an important role in promoting BCG adherence to TCC and consequently in BCG treatment efficacy. IL-6 expression in response to BCG requires nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB mediated signal transduction. We evaluated the influence of androgens on BCG induced, NF-kappaB mediated IL-6 expression.
Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction was used to confirm androgen receptor expression in the human TCC lines 253J and T24. A reporter construct containing an androgen response element was used to establish the integrity of androgen mediated signal transduction. Subsequently the dose dependent effect of dihydrotestosterone (DHT) on BCG induced IL-6 expression and NF-kappaB signaling was evaluated. Two pharmacological androgen receptor blockers were used to determine if receptor blockade inhibited the effect of DHT on activation of the androgen response element, NF-kappaB signaling and BCG induced IL-6 expression.
The 2 human TCC lines expressed androgen receptor and demonstrated intact androgen stimulated signaling pathways. DHT suppressed BCG induced, NF-kappaB mediated signaling and IL-6 expression in a dose dependent manner. DHT decreased mRNA levels of IL-6, expression of the full-length IL-6 promoter construct and expression of an NF-kappaB specific reporter construct in response to BCG relative to controls. Competitive pharmacological blockade of androgen receptor inhibited the effect of DHT on BCG induced signaling in dose dependent fashion.
DHT down-regulates NF-kappaB mediated IL-6 expression by human TCC lines in response to BCG. This effect depends on a functional androgen receptor signaling pathway and it can be blocked by the inhibition of androgen/androgen receptor binding.
The conformational requirements of suramin for its binding to basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) were examined by molecular modeling and docking simulations using the conformational features of suramin determined by the present proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H-NMR) studies and the crystal structures of growth factors reported previously. The assignment of resonances of suramin to individual protons was accomplished by the combined analysis of the coupling constants, two-dimensional correlated spectroscopy (COSY) and nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy (NOESY). The NOESY data obtained for suramin were utilized in a conformational search algorithm with constraints to generate a family of conformers which were further refined by restrained energy minimization. A family of nine conformers generated by restrained modeling falls primarily into one of two categories, either the conformer's two naphthyl rings are far apart, approximately 28-30 A, from one another or the conformer's two naphthyl rings are relatively close, approximately 16-18 A. The NMR data provide evidence for the presence of more than one conformer in solution. The modeling and docking simulation studies suggest that suramin binds efficiently to bFGF and PDGF by an induced-fit mechanism, wherein suramin complements bFGF or PDGF by adjusting its conformational freedom around the two pairs of single bonds that link the middle phenyl rings to the secondary amide backbone. The interaction of suramin with bFGF or PDGF primarily involves ion-pair, hydrophobic and hydrogen bonding interactions, in addition to van der Waals' contacts. The results indicate that suramin not only sterically blocks the receptor binding loop of the growth factors, but also competes for the binding sites of agonists such as heparin. The results suggest that suramin's propensity to bind to several polypeptides of varying size and structure is due to its conformational flexibility. Collectively, the data emphasize that conformationally constrained suramin analogs that selectively and competitively target angiogenic growth factors could be designed to reduce non-specific binding and, accordingly, toxicity.
Huntington's disease (HD) is caused due to expansion of CAG repeats in the gene huntingtin (Htt). Adaptor protein Grb2, involved in Ras-MAP kinase pathway, is a known interactor of Htt. Mutant Htt-Grb2 interaction reduces Ras-MAPK signaling in HD models. In normal cells Grb2 forms Grb2-Sos1-Gab1 complex through its N-SH3 and C-SH3 domains respectively, essential for sustained activation of Ras. We found that C-SH3 of Grb2 mediates the interaction with mutant Htt and this interaction being stronger could replace Gab1, with mutant Htt becoming the preferred partner. This would have immense effect on downstream signaling events. 
Mitochondrial trans-2-enoyl-CoA reductase (MECR) is involved in mitochondrial synthesis of fatty acids and is highly expressed in mitochondria. MECR is also known as nuclear receptor binding factor-1, which was originally reported with yeast two-hybrid screening as a binding protein of the nuclear hormone receptor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα). However, MECR and PPARα are localized at different compartment, mitochondria, and the nucleus, respectively. Therefore, the presence of a cytosolic or nuclear isoform of MECR is necessary for functional interaction between MECR and PPARα.
To identify the expression pattern of MECR and the cytosolic form of MECR (cMECR), we performed reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) with various tissue samples from Sprague-Dawley rats. To confirm the interaction between cMECR and PPARα, we performed several binding assays such as yeast two-hybrid, coimmunoprecipitation, and bimolecular fluorescence complementation. To observe subcellular localization of these proteins, immunocytochemistry was performed. A luciferase assay was used to measure PPARα activity.
We provide evidence of an alternatively spliced variant of the rat MECR gene that yields cMECR. The cMECR lacks the N-terminal 76 amino acids of MECR and shows uniform distribution in the cytoplasm and nucleus of HeLa cells. cMECR directly bound PPARα in the nucleus and increased PPARα-dependent luciferase activity in HeLa cells.
We found the cytosolic form of MECR (cMECR) was expressed in the cytosolic and/or nuclear region, directly binds with PPARα, and enhances PPARα activity.
The cytokine interleukin-10 (IL-10) is an important regulator of the host immune system with both pro- and anti-inflammatory functions. Glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) play a decisive role in the biology of many growth factors, e.g., for receptor binding or protection from proteolytic degradation. GAGs of the extracellular matrix inhibit IL-10 signaling, however, the molecular mechanism is so far unknown. Here, we studied the interaction between GAGs and IL-10 using a combination of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and computer simulations. The binding region of a set of heparin and chondroitin sulfate GAG disaccharides with varying sulfation pattern were determined by saturation transfer difference (STD) NMR spectroscopy. From the initial growth rate of the STD amplification factor binding affinities were determined and KD values in the low millimolar to micromolar range were obtained. We observed the highest binding affinity to IL-10 with fully sulfated heparin; however, a hyaluronan hexasaccharide did not exhibit binding, which suggests that GAG sulfation is necessary for interaction with IL-10. For octasaccharides or longer GAGs, a cooperative binding behavior was observed, which could indicate simultaneous interaction with both dimer subunits of IL-10. Finally, structural information about the bound GAG was exemplarily obtained for a heparin tetrasaccharide fragment (ΔUA,2S-GlcNS,6S-IdoA,2S-GlcNS,6S) using transferred NOESY experiments, proton-proton scalar couplings and molecular dynamics simulations. The overall backbone conformation is only slightly changed in the presence of IL-10 and the conformational equilibrium between (1)C4 chair and (2)So skew-boat structure of the internal iduronic acid residue is preserved. 
Antisense peptide technology is a valuable tool for deriving new biologically active molecules and performing peptide-receptor modulation. It is based on the fact that peptides specified by the complementary (antisense) nucleotide sequences often bind to each other with a higher specificity and efficacy. We tested the validity of this concept on the example of human erythropoietin, a well-characterized and pharmacologically relevant hematopoietic growth factor. The purpose of the work was to present and test simple and efficient three-step procedure for the design of an antisense peptide targeting receptor-binding site of human erythropoietin. Firstly, we selected the carboxyl-terminal receptor binding region of the molecule (epitope) as a template for the antisense peptide modeling; Secondly, we designed an antisense peptide using mRNA transcription of the epitope sequence in the 3'→5' direction and computational screening of potential paratope structures with BLAST; Thirdly, we evaluated sense-antisense (epitope-paratope) peptide binding and affinity by means of fluorescence spectroscopy and microscale thermophoresis. Both methods showed similar Kd values of 850 and 816 µM, respectively. The advantages of the methods were: fast screening with a small quantity of the sample needed, and measurements done within the range of physicochemical parameters resembling physiological conditions. Antisense peptides targeting specific erythropoietin region(s) could be used for the development of new immunochemical methods. Selected antisense peptides with optimal affinity are potential lead compounds for the development of novel diagnostic substances, biopharmaceuticals and vaccines. 
The effect of commercially available green tea (GT) and black tea (BT) drinks on drug metabolizing enzymes (DME) and oxidative stress in rats was investigated. Male Wistar rats were fed a laboratory chow diet and GT or BT drink for 5 weeks. Control rats received de-ionized water instead of the tea drinks. Rats received the GT and BT drinks treatment for 5 weeks showed a significant increase in hepatic microsomal cytochrome P450 (CYP) 1A1 and CYP1A2, and a significant decrease in CYP2C, CYP2E1 and CYP3A enzyme activities. Results of immunoblot analyses of enzyme protein contents showed the same trend with enzyme activity. Significant increase in UDP-glucuronosyltransferase activity and reduced glutathione content in liver and lungs were observed in rats treated with both tea drinks. A lower lipid peroxide level in lungs was observed in rats treated with GT drink. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay revealed that both tea drinks decreased pregnane X receptor binding to DNA and increased nuclear factor-erythroid 2 p45-related factor 2 binding to DNA. These results suggest that feeding of both tea drinks to rats modulated DME activities and reduced oxidative stress in liver and lungs. GT drink is more effective on reducing oxidative stress than BT drink.
The androgen receptor (AR) is a ligand-activated transcription factor that is essential for prostate cancer development. It is activated by androgens through its ligand-binding domain (LBD), which consists predominantly of 11 α-helices. Upon ligand binding, the last helix is reorganized to an agonist conformation termed activator function-2 (AF-2) for coactivator binding. Several coactivators bind to the AF-2 pocket through conserved LXXLL or FXXLF sequences to enhance the activity of the receptor. Recently, a small compound-binding surface adjacent to AF-2 has been identified as an allosteric modulator of the AF-2 activity and is termed binding function-3 (BF-3). However, the role of BF-3 in vivo is currently unknown, and little is understood about what proteins can bind to it. Here we demonstrate that a duplicated GARRPR motif at the N terminus of the cochaperone Bag-1L functions through the BF-3 pocket. These findings are supported by the fact that a selective BF-3 inhibitor or mutations within the BF-3 pocket abolish the interaction between the GARRPR motif(s) and the BF-3. Conversely, amino acid exchanges in the two GARRPR motifs of Bag-1L can impair the interaction between Bag-1L and AR without altering the ability of Bag-1L to bind to chromatin. Furthermore, the mutant Bag-1L increases androgen-dependent activation of a subset of AR targets in a genome-wide transcriptome analysis, demonstrating a repressive function of the GARRPR/BF-3 interaction. We have therefore identified GARRPR as a novel BF-3 regulatory sequence important for fine-tuning the activity of the AR. 
Lymphangiogenesis and angiogenesis are processes that are, in part, regulated by vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-D. The formation of lymphatic structures has been implicated in multiple lung diseases, including pulmonary fibrosis. VEGF-D is a secreted protein produced by fibroblasts and macrophages, which induces lymphangiogenesis by signaling via VEGF receptor-3, and angiogenesis through VEGF receptor-2. VEGF-D contains a central VEGF homology domain, which is the biologically active domain, with flanking N- and C-terminal propeptides. Full-length VEGF-D (∼ 50 kD) is proteolytically processed in the extracellular space, to generate VEGF homology domain that contains the VEGF-D receptor-binding sites. Here, we report that, independent of its cell surface receptors, full-length VEGF-D accumulated in nuclei of fibroblasts, and that this process appears to increase with cell density. In nuclei, full-length VEGF-D associated with RNA polymerase II and c-Myc. In cells depleted of VEGF-D, the transcriptionally regulated genes appear to be modulated by c-Myc. These findings have potential clinical implications, as VEGF-D was found in fibroblast nuclei in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, a disease characterized by fibroblast proliferation. These findings are consistent with actions of full-length VEGF-D in cellular homeostasis in health and disease, independent of its receptors. 
Mammals and plants share pathogen-sensing systems named nod-like receptors (NLRs). Some NLRs form the inflammasome, a protein scaffold that regulates the secretion of interleukin (IL)-1β and IL-18 by cleaving catalytically inactive substrates into mature cytokines. Here, we show an immune conservation between plant and mammalian NLRs and demonstrate that the murine nuclear receptor binding SET domain protein 1 (NSD1), a protein that bears similarity to the NLR regulator enhanced downy mildew 2 (EDM2) in Arabidopsis, diminishes caspase-1 activity during extracellular stimulation with Listeria monocytogenes listeriolysin O (LLO). EDM2 is known to regulate plant developmental processes, whereas NSD1 is associated with developmental disorders. We observed that NSD1 neither affects nuclear factor (NF)-κB signaling nor regulates NLRP3 inflammasome gene expression at the chromatin, transcriptional or translational level during LLO stimulation of macrophages. Silencing of Nsd1 followed by LLO stimulation led to increased caspase-1 activation, enhanced post-translational maturation of IL-1β and IL-18 and elevated pyroptosis, a form of cell death associated with inflammation. Furthermore, treatment of macrophages with LLO(W492A), which lacks hemolytic activity due to a tryptophan to alanine substitution in the undecapeptide motif, indicates the importance of functional LLO for NSD1 regulation of the NLRP3 inflammasome. Taken together, our results indicate that NLR signaling in plants may be used for gene discovery in mammals. 
The MED1 subunit of the Mediator transcriptional coregulator complex is a nuclear receptor-specific coactivator. A negative feedback mechanism of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH, or thyrotropin) expression in the thyrotroph in the presence of triiodothyronine (T3) is employed by liganded thyroid hormone receptor β (TRβ) on the TSHβ gene promoter, where conventional histone-modifying coactivators act as corepressors. We now provide evidence that MED1 is a ligand-dependent positive cofactor on this promoter. TSHβ gene transcription was attenuated in MED1 mutant mice in which the nuclear receptor-binding ability of MED1 was specifically disrupted. MED1 stimulated GATA2- and Pit1-mediated TSHβ gene promoter activity in a ligand-independent manner in cultured cells. MED1 also stimulated transcription from the TSHβ gene promoter in a T3-dependent manner. The transcription was further enhanced when the T3-dependent corepressors SRC1, SRC2, and HDAC2 were downregulated. Hence, MED1 is a T3-dependent and -independent coactivator on the TSHβ gene promoter.
Metabolic activation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) is mediated mainly by cytochrome P₄₅₀ monooxygenases (CYP) CYP1A1, 1A2 and 1B1. Several PAH are known to induce these CYP via aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) signaling. Recently, it was shown that the PAH benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) can induce CYP3A4 as well. The induction was suggested to be mediated by the pregnane X receptor (PXR) rather than AhR. Metabolism by CYP3A4 is only known for dihydrodiol metabolites of PAH but not for their parent compounds. In the present study, a CYP3A4 reporter gene assay, requiring the overexpression of PXR, was used to investigate whether the PAH parent compounds BaP, benzo[c]phenanthrene (BcP) and dibenzo[a,l]pyrene (DBalP) as well as their corresponding phase I metabolites, the respective dihydrodiols and diol epoxides, can induce CYP3A4 promoter activity. BaP, BcP and their dihydrodiols were found to significantly activate the CYP3A4 promoter. Moreover, activation of PXR by all four compounds was detected by using a PXR transactivation assay, supporting that PXR mediates CYP3A4 induction by PAH. Taken together, these results show that both PAH parent compounds as well as their phase I metabolites induce CYP3A4 promoter via the transcription factor PXR.

This study evaluates the potential utility of a modular nanotransporter (MNT) for enhancing the nuclear delivery and cytotoxicity of the Auger electron emitter 125I in cancer cells that overexpress the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR).
MNTs are recombinant multifunctional polypeptides that we have developed for achieving selective delivery of short-range therapeutics into cancer cells. MNTs contain functional modules for receptor binding, internalization, endosomal escape and nuclear translocation, thereby facilitating the transport of drugs from the cell surface to the nucleus. The MNT described herein utilized EGF as the targeting ligand and was labeled with 125I using N-succinimidyl-4-guanidinomethyl-3-[125I]iodobenzoate (SGMIB). Membrane binding, intracellular and nuclear accumulation kinetics, and clonogenic survival assays were performed using the EGFR-expressing A431 epidermoid carcinoma and D247 MG glioma cell lines.
[125I]SGMIB-MNT bound to A431 and D247 MG cells with an affinity comparable to that of native EGF. More than 60% of internalized [125I]SGMIB-MNT radioactivity accumulated in the cell nuclei after a 1-h incubation. The cytotoxic effectiveness of [125I]SGMIB-MNT compared with 125I-labeled bovine serum albumin control was enhanced by a factor of 60 for D247 MG cells and more than 1,000-fold for A431 cells, which express higher levels of EGFR.
MNT can be utilized to deliver 125I into the nuclei of cancer cells overexpressing EGFR, significantly enhancing cytotoxicity. Further evaluation of [125I]SGMIB-MNT as a targeted radiotherapeutic for EGFR-expressing cancer cells appears warranted.
The nuclear hormone 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) (1α,25(OH)(2)D(3) or 1,25D) regulates its target genes via activation of the transcription factor vitamin D receptor (VDR) far more specifically than the chromatin modifier trichostatin A (TsA) via its inhibitory action on histone deacetylases. We selected the thrombomodulin gene locus with its complex pattern of five VDR binding sites and multiple histone acetylation and open chromatin regions as an example to investigate together with a number of reference genes, the primary transcriptional responses to 1α,25(OH)(2)D(3) and TsA. Transcriptome-wide, 18.4% of all expressed genes are either up-or down-regulated already after a 90 min TsA treatment; their response pattern to 1α,25(OH)(2)D(3) and TsA sorts them into at least six classes. TsA stimulates a far higher number of genes than 1α,25(OH)(2)D(3) and dominates the outcome of combined treatments. However, 200 TsA target genes can be modulated by 1α,25(OH)(2)D(3) and more than 1000 genes respond only when treated with both compounds. The genomic view on the genes suggests that the degree of acetylation at transcription start sites and VDR binding regions may determine the effect of TsA on mRNA expression and its interference with 1α,25(OH)(2)D(3). Our findings hold true also for other HDAC inhibitors and may have implications on dual therapies using chromatin modifiers and nuclear receptor ligands.
Recent decades have been filled with groundbreaking research in the field of endocrine hormone signaling. Pivotal events like the isolation and purification of the estrogen receptor, the cloning of glucocorticoid receptor cDNA, or dissemination of nuclear hormone receptor (NHR) DNA binding sequences are well recognized for their contributions. However, the novel genome-wide and gene-specific information obtained over the last decade describing NHR association with chromatin, cofactors, and epigenetic modifications, as well as their role in gene regulation, has been largely facilitated by the adaptation of the chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) technique. Use of ChIP-based technologies has taken the field of hormone signaling from speculating about the transcription-enabling properties of acetylated chromatin and putative transcription (co-)factor genomic occupancy to demonstrating the detailed, stepwise mechanisms of factor binding and transcriptional initiation; from treating hormone-induced transcription as a steady-state event to understanding its dynamic and cyclic nature; from looking at the DNA sequences recognized by various DNA-binding domains in vitro to analyzing the cell-specific genome-wide pattern of nuclear receptor binding and interpreting its physiological implications. Not only have these events propelled hormone research, but, as some of the pioneering studies, have also contributed tremendously to the field of molecular endocrinology as a whole. In this review, we give a brief summary of some of the most important discoveries in hormone signaling using ChIP and other derivative techniques and speculate on what the future may hold.
The present study directly addresses the roles of the P2X(7) receptor (P2X(7)R), an ionotropic adenosine triphosphate (ATP) receptor, and cytokines in the induction of orofacial pain following chronic constriction injury (CCI) of the infraorbital nerve (IoN).
Rats were anesthetized, and ligatures of 4-0 chromic gut were tied around the IoN. A438079, a P2X(7)R antagonist or SB203580, a phosphorylated (p)-p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) inhibitor, was infused intrathecally into CCI-treated rats. In another group of rats, 3'-O-(4-benzoylbenzoyl) adenosine 5'-triphosphate (BzATP), a P2X(7) R agonist, was infused intrathecally with A438079, SB203580 or etanercept, a tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α receptor-binding recombinant drug.
CCI of the IoN induced tactile allodynia/hyperalgesia and up-regulation of P2X(7)R, membrane-bound TNF-α (mTNF-α) and soluble TNF-α (sTNF-α) in the trigeminal sensory nuclear complex (TNC). Tactile allodynia/hyperalgesia or up-regulation of mTNF-α and sTNF-α in the TNC following CCI of the IoN was inhibited by A438079. SB203580 also attenuated tactile allodynia/hyperalgesia or up-regulation of mTNF-α, but not the up-regulation of sTNF-α in the TNC. Treatment of rats with BzATP induced tactile allodynia/hyperalgesia and up-regulation of sTNF-α and p-p38 in the TNC. Tactile allodynia/hyperalgesia or up-regulation of sTNF-α following BzATP treatment was inhibited by SB203580 and etanercept.
Based on these findings, phosphorylation of p38 MAPK via P2X(7)R may induce tactile allodynia/hyperalgesia, which is most likely mediated by sTNF-α released by microglia.
APP intracellular C-terminal domain (AICD-47), generated upon γ-secretase cleavage of amyloid precursor's protein (APP), bears the signature of a classical intrinsically unstructured domain (IUD). Comparing the recent crystal structures of AICD-47 peptides bound to its different adaptors such as protein-tyrosine-binding domain-2 (PTB2) of Fe65 and Src homology 2 (SH2) domain of growth factor receptor binding protein 2 (Grb2), the "conformational switching" of AICD-47 becomes evident. In order to understand different binding processes undertaken by this flexible molecule, upon recognizing different interfaces resulting in different 3D conformations, spectroscopic and calorimetric studies have been done. CD spectroscopy has revealed an overall random coil like structure in different pHs while TFE (2'-2'-2'-trifluoro ethanol) and HFIP (Hexa fluoro isopropanol) induced α-helicity to a certain extent. Binding of Tyr phosphorylated AICD-47 ((P)AICD-47) to Grb2-SH2 domain was carried out by a favorable enthalpic change (ΔH=-197.5±6.2 kcal mole(-1) at 25 °C) and an unfavorable entropic contribution (ΔS=-631 cal mol(-1) deg(-1) at 25 °C). Alternative conformation of AICD-47 in different biological contexts is another remarkable feature of IUDs which presumably has definitive roles in regulating Alzheimer's disease phenotype.
Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor mimetic peptides have interesting applications in therapeutic angiogenesis. Recently, we described the proangiogenic properties of a 15 mer peptide designed on the N-terminal helix 17-25 of VEGF. The peptide was stabilized introducing well known peptide chemical tools among which N- and C-terminal capping sequence. Here, we show that the C-terminal sequence does not affect the structural and biological properties of the full-length peptide. In fact, a C-terminal truncated analog peptide resulted in a well folded and stable helix retaining the ability to bind to VEGF receptors. This study will allow to develop smaller peptidomimetic analogs able to modulate the VEGF-dependent angiogenesis.
Major depression is nearly twice as prevalent in women compared to men. In bipolar disorder, depressive episodes have been reported to be more common amongst female patients. Furthermore, periods of depression often correlate with periods of hormonal fluctuations. A link between hormone signaling and these mood disorders has, therefore, been suggested to exist in many studies. Estrogen, one of the primary female sex hormones, mediates its effect mostly by binding to estrogen receptors (ERs). Nuclear ERs function as transcription factors and regulate gene transcription by binding to specific DNA sequences. A nucleotide change in the binding sequence might alter the binding efficiency, which could affect transcription levels of nearby genes. In order to investigate if variation in ER DNA-binding sequences may be involved in mood disorders, we conducted a genome-wide study of ER DNA-binding in patients diagnosed with major depression or bipolar disorder. Association studies were performed within each gender separately and the results were corrected for multiple testing by the Bonferroni method. In the female bipolar disorder material a significant association result was found for rs6023059 (corrected p-value = 0.023; odds ratio (OR) 0.681, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.570-0.814), a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) placed downstream of the gene coding for transglutaminase 2 (TGM2). Thus, females with a specific genotype at this SNP may be more vulnerable to fluctuating estrogen levels, which may then act as a triggering factor for bipolar disorder.
Adipose tissue is the key regulator of energy balance, playing an active role in lipid storage and metabolism and may be a dynamic buffer to control fatty acid flux. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma isoform-2 (PPARg2), an isoform of the nuclear hormone receptor superfamily, has been implicated in almost all aspects of human metabolic alterations such as obesity, insulin resistance, type-2 diabetes and dyslipidaemia. The PPARg2 isoform is highly present in adipose tissue where it functions as a thrifty phenotype, which promotes adipocyte differentiation and triglyceride storage. Thiazolidinediones, antidiabetic drugs, induce insulin sensitivity by controlling adipokines. The thiazolidinediones bind with PPARg2 in adipocytes and exert an agonist effect by enhancing adipogenesis and fatty acid uptake. Thiazolidinediones stimulate PPARg2, by which they down-regulate tumour necrosis factor-α, leptin, interleukin-6 and plasminogen and also enhance insulin sensitivity. The aim of this work is to define role of PPARg2 transcription factor in thiazolidinedione-induced insulin sensitization.
The PPARg2 alters the transcription of the target gene. This altered gene transcription results in the up-regulation of insulin-sensitizing factors and down-regulation of insulin-resistant factors. The variant Pro12Ala of the PPARg2 gene is an important modulator in metabolic control in the body. Thiazolidinediones stimulate PPARg2 transcription factor by which PPARg2 binds to responsive elements located in the promoter regions of many genes and modulates their transcriptive activity. There is a strong mutual relationship between receptor binding and agonism, which is evidence of the insulin-sensitizing target of thiazolidinediones in PPARg2. This evidently increases the biological potency of the glucose-lowering effect of thiazolidinediones in vivo as well as their antidiabetic activity.
PPARg2 transcription factor plays an important role in treatment of type-2 diabetes with thiazolidindiones. The variant Pro12Ala of the PPARg2 gene promotes the activity of thiazolidinediones in minimizing insulin resistance. Transcriptional activity of Pro12Ala variant improves the activity of insulin. Thus thiazolidinediones promote the phosphorylation of PPARg2 to induce insulin sensitivity.
The Siberian hamster, Phodopus sungorus, undergoes a striking seasonal cycle of leptin sensitivity and body weight regulation, but the molecular mechanism and relevance to human leptin insensitivity are unknown. Here we show that nuclear translocation of phospho-STAT3 in the hypothalamus is rapidly stimulated by leptin to a greater extent in hamsters held in short-day length (SD) as compared to long-day length (LD). Intriguingly, effects of leptin on STAT3 appeared to be in part limited to nuclear translocation of phospho-STAT3 associated with the cell surface rather than phosphorylation of STAT3. The number of phospho-ERK cells within the hypothalamus was unaffected by either photoperiod or leptin. However, proximal to ERK phosphorylation, hypothalamic SH2-containing tyrosine phosphatase (SHP2) and the small growth factor receptor-binding protein (GRB2), which act as competitive negative modulators on binding of SOCS3 to leptin receptor (LRb)-associated Tyr⁹⁸⁵, were increased in SD compared to LD. Our findings suggest that activation of STAT3 by leptin may be dependent on interaction of stimulatory SHP2/GRB2 as well as inhibitory SOCS3 on the level of competitive binding to LRb-associated Tyr⁹⁸⁵. This hypothetical mechanism may represent the molecular identity of seasonally induced adjustments in leptin sensitivity and may be applied to investigating leptin sensitivity in other rodent models.
It has been hypothesized previously that synergistic effect of both amyloid precursor protein intracellular C-terminal domain (AICD) and Aβ aggregation could contribute to Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis. Structural studies of AICD have found no stable globular fold over a broad range of pH. Present work is based on the premises that a conformational switch involving the flipping of C-terminal helix of AICD would be essential for effective binding with the Src homology 2 (SH2) domain of growth factor receptor binding protein-2 (Grb2) and subsequent initiation of Grb2-mediated endo-lysosomal pathway. High-resolution crystal structures of Grb2-SH2 domain bound to AICD peptides reveal a unique mode of binding where the peptides assume a noncanonical conformation that is unlike other structures of AICD peptides bound to protein-tyrosine-binding domains or that of its free state; rather, a flipping of the C-terminal helix of AICD is evident. The involvement of different AICD residues in Grb2-SH2 interaction is further elucidated through fluorescence-based assays. Our results reveal the significance of a specific interaction of the two molecules to optimize the rapid transport of AICD inside endosomal vesicles presumably to reduce the cytotoxic load.
Genome-wide, promoter-focused ChIP-chip analysis of hepatic aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) binding sites was conducted in 8-week old female C57BL/6 treated with 30 μg/kg/body weight 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) for 2 h and 24 h. These studies identified 1642 and 508 AHR-bound regions at 2h and 24h, respectively. A total of 430 AHR-bound regions were common between the two time points, corresponding to 403 unique genes. Comparison with previous AHR ChIP-chip studies in mouse hepatoma cells revealed that only 62 of the putative target genes overlapped with the 2 h AHR-bound regions in vivo. Transcription factor binding site analysis revealed an over-representation of aryl hydrocarbon response elements (AHREs) in AHR-bound regions with 53% (2 h) and 68% (24 h) of them containing at least one AHRE. In addition to AHREs, E2f-Myc activator motifs previously implicated in AHR function, as well as a number of other motifs, including Sp1, nuclear receptor subfamily 2 factor, and early growth response factor motifs were also identified. Expression microarray studies identified 133 unique genes differentially regulated after 4 h treatment with TCDD. Of which, 39 were identified as AHR-bound genes at 2 h. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis on the 39 AHR-bound TCDD responsive genes identified potential perturbation in biological processes such as lipid metabolism, drug metabolism, and endocrine system development as a result of TCDD-mediated AHR activation. Our findings identify direct AHR target genes in vivo, highlight in vitro and in vivo differences in AHR signaling and show that AHR recruitment does not necessarily result in changes in target gene expression.
The humanized monoclonal antibody Nimotuzumab (h-R3) has demonstrated an exceptional and better clinical profile than other monoclonal antibodies for immunotherapy of epidermal growth factor receptor-overexpressing tumors. This work deals with the preparation and radiolabeling optimization of (177)Lu-Nimotuzumab and their preclinical evaluation.
Nimotuzumab was conjugated with S-2-(4-isothiocyanatobenzyl)-1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane tetraacetic acid (p-SCN-Bn-DOTA), testing different molar ratios. The immunoconjugates were characterized. The radiolabeling with (177)Lu was optimized. Radioimmunoconjugates stability was tested in 2-[bis[2-[bis(carboxymethyl)amino]ethyl]amino]acetic acid (DTPA) excess and human serum. In vitro studies were performed in tumor model cell lines. Receptor-specific binding was tested by competitive inhibition. (177)Lu-Nimotuzumab in vivo studies were conducted in healthy and xenograft animals.
Nimotuzumab conjugates were obtained with high purity. Radiolabeling yield and specific activities ranged from 63.6% to 94.5% and from 748 to 1142 MBq/mg, respectively. The stability in DTPA excess and human serum was 95.9% and 93.2% after 10 days, respectively. The radioimmunoconjugate showed specific receptor binding in tumor cell lines. Biodistribution in healthy animals showed the typical behavior of the immunoconjugates based on monoclonal antibodies. The study in xenografts mice demonstrated uptake of (177)Lu-Nimotuzumab in the tumor and reticuloendothelial organs.
(177)Lu-Nimotuzumab was obtained with high purity and specific activities under optimal conditions without significant loss in immunoreactivity and might be a potential radioimmunoconjugate for radioimmunotherapy of tumors with epidermal growth factor receptor overexpression.
In our previous study, mesenchymal-epithelial transition factor (c-Met)-binding peptides (cMBP) had been readily radiolabeled with radioactive iodide for glioma imaging because of five histidine amino acids. However, iodinated cMBP showed relatively unfavorable in vivo kinetics. For this reason, we tried to design dual peptide ligands that would be advantageous in recognizing both c-Met receptor and integrin α(v) β(3) . A cMBP-click-cRGDyk (cyclic Arg-Gly-Asp-Tyr-Lys) heterodimer was synthesized from mini polyethylene glycol-conjugated cMBP-3 glycine (GGG)-a single name of amino acids (SC) (Ser-Cys) and cRGDyk through a click (1 + 3 cycloaddition), and then labeled with iodine 125 (I-125) via histidine in the cMBP and tyrosine in the cRGDyk. The receptor-binding characteristics and tumor-targeting efficacy of cMBP-click-cRGDyk were tested in vitro and in vivo. A cMBP-click-cRGDyk had comparable integrin α(v) β(3) -binding affinity with cRGDyk. The results of the biodistribution of (125) I-cMBP-click-cRGDyk at 4 h showed higher tumor-to-blood, tumor-to-liver, and tumor-to-muscle ratios: 10.07, 6.76, and 11.12, compared to 2.34, 1.99, and 5.18 of (125) I-cMBP-GGG-SC, respectively. U87MG tumor xenografts could be visualized by single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT)/CT using (125) I-cMBP-click-cRGDyk and also image contrast and overall quality were improved compared to (125) I-cMBP-GGG-SC. As the results of in vivo inhibition using free cRGDyk or cMBP-GGG-SC indicated, the tumoral uptake of (125) I-cMBP-click-cRGDyk decreased. This finding means that (125) I-cMBP-click-cRGDyk was specifically uptaken by integrin α(v) β(3) and the c-Met receptor. Although imaging quality was improved, additional experiments are needed to acquire significant image-quality improvement.
The nhr-67 nuclear receptor gene of Caenorhabditis elegans encodes the ortholog of the Drosophila tailless and vertebrate Tlx genes. In C. elegans, nhr-67 plays multiple roles in the development of the uterus during L2 and L3 larval stages. Four pre-VU cells are born in the L2 stage and form the precursor complement for the ventral surface of the mature uterus. One of the four pre-VU cells becomes the anchor cell (AC), which exits the cell cycle and differentiates, while the remaining three VU cells serve as stem cells that populate the ventral uterus. The nhr-67 gene functions in the development of both VU cell lineages and AC differentiation. Hypomorphic mutations in nhr-67 identify a 276bp region of the distal promoter that is sufficient to activate nhr-67 expression in pre-VU cells and the AC. The 276bp region includes 8 conserved potential cis-acting sites, including two E boxes and a nuclear receptor binding site. Mutational analysis demonstrates that the two E boxes are required for expression of nhr-67 in uterine precursor cells. The E/daughterless ortholog HLH-2 binds these sites as a homodimer, thus playing a central role in activating nhr-67 expression in the uterine precursors. At least two other binding activities, one of which may be the nhr-25/Ftz-F1 nuclear receptor transcription factor, also contribute to uterine precursor cell expression. The organization of the nhr-67 uterine precursor enhancer is compared to similar conserved enhancers in the egl-43, lag-2, and lin-3 genes, which contain the same HLH-2-binding E boxes and are similarly expressed in both pre-VU cells and the AC. This basic regulatory module allows the coordinated expression of at least four genes. Expression of genes in different cells that must coordinate to form a mature organ is driven by a shared set of promoter elements, which integrate multiple transcription factor inputs.
Psychiatric comorbidities are prevalent in patients with epilepsy and greatly contribute to the overall burden of disease. The availability of reliable biomarkers to diagnose epilepsy-associated comorbidities would allow for effective treatment and improved disease management. Due to their non-invasive nature, molecular imaging techniques such as positron emission tomography (PET) are ideal tools to measure pathologic changes. In the current study we investigated the potential of [18F]fluoro-2-deoxy-d-glucose ([18F]FDG) and 2'-methoxyphenyl-(N-2'-pyridinyl)-p-18F-fluoro-benzamidoethylpiperazine ([18F]MPPF) as imaging correlates of neurobehavioral comorbidities in the pilocarpine rat model of epilepsy. Findings from rats with epilepsy revealed a regional reduction in [18F]FDG uptake indicating thalamic hypometabolism. In addition, an increase in septal [18F]MPPF binding was observed in rats with spontaneous recurrent seizures. Both thalamic [18F]FDG and septal [18F]MPPF data proved to correlate with behavioral alterations including decreases in luxury behavior such as burrowing and social interaction, and changes in behavioral patterns in anxiety tests. A correlation with seizure frequency was confirmed for thalamic [18F]FDG data. Moreover, thalamic [18F]FDG and septal [18F]MPPF data exhibited a correlation with brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) serum concentrations, which were lowered in rats with epilepsy. In conclusion, μPET data from rats with pilocarpine-induced epileptogenesis indicate altered septal 5-HT1A receptor binding. Further research is necessary assessing whether septal 5-HT1A receptor binding may serve as an imaging correlate of neuropsychiatric comorbidities in epilepsy patients and for severity assessment in rodent epilepsy models. In contrast, we obtained evidence that [18F]FDG uptake also reflects the severity of epilepsy and, thus, might not constitute a biomarker with sufficient specificity for psychiatric comorbidities. Evidence has been obtained that BDNF might serve as a peripheral circulatory biomarker. Further experimental and clinical assessment is necessary for validation of the marker candidates.
2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) induces hepatic oxidative stress following activation of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR). Our recent studies showed TCDD induced pyruvate kinase muscle isoform 2 (Pkm2) as a novel antioxidant response in normal differentiated hepatocytes. To investigate cooperative regulation between nuclear factor, erythroid derived 2, like 2 (Nrf2) and the AhR in the induction of Pkm2, hepatic chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) analyses were integrated with RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) time-course data from mice treated with TCDD for 2-168 hours. ChIP-seq analysis 2 hours after TCDD treatment identified genome-wide NRF2 enrichment. Approximately 842 NRF2-enriched regions were located in the regulatory region of differentially expressed genes (DEGs), whereas 579 DEGs showed both NRF2 and AhR enrichment. Sequence analysis of regions with overlapping NRF2 and AhR enrichment showed over-representation of either antioxidant or dioxin response elements, although 18 possessed both motifs. NRF2 exhibited negligible enrichment within a closed Pkm chromatin region, whereas the AhR was enriched 29-fold. Furthermore, TCDD induced Pkm2 in primary hepatocytes from wild-type and Nrf2-null mice, indicating NRF2 is not required. Although NRF2 and AhR cooperate to regulate numerous antioxidant gene expression responses, the induction of Pkm2 by TCDD is independent of reactive oxygen species-mediated NRF2 activation.
Epigenetic modulators play critical roles in reprogramming of cellular functions, emerging as a new class of promising therapeutic targets. Nuclear receptor binding SET domain protein 3 (NSD3) is a member of the lysine methyltransferase family. Interestingly, the short isoform of NSD3 without the methyltransferase fragment, NSD3S, exhibits oncogenic activity in a wide range of cancers. We recently showed that NSD3S interacts with MYC, a central regulator of tumorigenesis, suggesting a mechanism by which NSD3S regulates cell proliferation through engaging MYC. Thus, small molecule inhibitors of the NSD3S/MYC interaction will be valuable tools for understanding the function of NSD3 in tumorigenesis for potential cancer therapeutic discovery. Here we report the development of a cell lysate-based time-resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer (TR-FRET) assay in an ultrahigh-throughput screening (uHTS) format to monitor the interaction of NSD3S with MYC. In our TR-FRET assay, anti-Flag-terbium and anti-glutathione S-transferase (GST)-d2, a paired fluorophores, were used to indirectly label Flag-tagged NSD3 and GST-MYC in HEK293T cell lysates. This TR-FRET assay is robust in a 1,536-well uHTS format, with signal-to-background &gt;8 and a Z' factor &gt;0.7. A pilot screening with the Spectrum library of 2,000 compounds identified several positive hits. One positive compound was confirmed to disrupt the NSD3/MYC interaction in an orthogonal protein-protein interaction assay. Thus, our optimized uHTS assay could be applied to future scaling up of a screening campaign to identify small molecule inhibitors targeting the NSD3/MYC interaction.
Piperazine is a promising scaffold for drug development due to its broad spectrum of biological activities. Based on this, the new piperazine-containing compound LQFM018 (2) [ethyl 4-((1-(4-chlorophenyl)-1H-pyrazol-4-yl)methyl)piperazine-1-carboxylate] was synthetized and some biological activities investigated. In this work, we described its ability to bind aminergic receptors, antiproliferative effects as well as the LQFM018 (2)-triggered cell death mechanisms, in K562 leukemic cells, by flow cytometric analyses. Furthermore, acute oral systemic toxicity and potential myelotoxicity assessments of LQFM018 (2) were carried out. LQFM018 (2) was originally obtained by molecular simplification from LASSBio579 (1), an analogue compound of clozapine, with 33% of global yield. Binding profile assay to aminergic receptors showed that LQFM018 (2) has affinity for the dopamine D4 receptor (Ki = 0.26 μM). Moreover, it showed cytotoxicity in K562 cells, in a concentration and time-dependent manner; IC50 values obtained were 399, 242 and 119 μM for trypan blue assay and 427, 259 and 50 μM for MTT method at 24, 48 or 72 h, respectively. This compound (427 μM) also promoted increase in LDH release and cell cycle arrest in G2/M phase. Furthermore, it triggered necrotic morphologies in K562 cells associated with intense cell membrane rupture as confirmed by Annexin V/propidium iodide double-staining. LQFM018 (2) also triggered mitochondrial disturb through loss of ΔΨm associated with increase of ROS production. No significant accumulation of cytosolic cytochrome c was verified in treated cells. Furthermore, it was verified an increase of expression of TNF-R1 and mRNA levels of CYLD with no involviment in caspase-3 and -8 activation and NF-κB in K562 cells. LQFM018 (2) showed in vitro myelotoxicity potential, but it was orally well tolerated and classified as UN GHS category 5 (LD50 &gt; 2000-5000 mg/Kg). Thus, LQFM018 (2) seems to have a non-selective action considering hematopoietic cells. In conclusion, it is suggested LQFM018 (2) promotes cell death in K562 cells via necroptotic signaling, probably with involvement of dopamine D4 receptor. These findings open new perspectives in cancer therapy by use of necroptosis inducing agents as a strategy of reverse cancer cell chemoresistance.
Notch signaling as a conserved cell fate regulator is involved in the regulation of cell quiescence, proliferation, differentiation and postnatal tissue regeneration. However, how Notch signaling regulates porcine satellite cells (PSCs) has not been elucidated. We stably transfected Notch1 intracellular domain (N1ICD) into PSCs to analyze the gene expression profile and miRNA-seq. The analysis of the gene expression profile identified 295 differentially-expressed genes (DEGs) in proliferating-N1ICD PSCs (P-N1ICD) and nine DEGs on differentiating-N1ICD PSCs (D-N1ICD), compared with that in control groups (P-Control and D-Control, respectively). Analyzing the underlying function of DEGs showed that most of the upregulated DEGs enriched in P-N1ICD PSCs are related to the cell cycle. Forty-four and 12 known differentially-expressed miRNAs (DEMs) were identified in the P-N1ICD PSCs and D-N1ICD PSCs group, respectively. Furthermore, we constructed the gene-miRNA network of the DEGs and DEMs. In P-N1ICD PSCs, miR-125a, miR-125b, miR-10a-5p, ssc-miR-214, miR-423 and miR-149 are downregulated hub miRNAs, whose corresponding hub genes are marker of proliferation Ki-67 (MKI67) and nuclear receptor binding SET domain protein 2 (WHSC1). By contrast, miR-27a, miR-146a-5p and miR-221-3p are upregulated hub miRNAs, whose hub genes are RUNX1 translocation partner 1 (RUNX1T1) and fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2). All the hub miRNAs and genes are associated with cell proliferation. Quantitative RT-PCR results are consistent with the gene expression profile and miRNA-seq results. The results of our study provide valuable information for understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying Notch signaling in PSCs and skeletal muscle development.
We demonstrate that OCT4 expression is regulated by germ cell nuclear factor (GCNF) via its interactions with three nuclear receptor (NR) binding sites within OCT4 promoter conserved regions (CRs) in human embryonic carcinoma (EC) NCCIT cells. OCT4 expression is gradually reduced during the retinoic acid-induced differentiation, while GCNF temporarily increased after 2 days and then significantly decreased. In addition, OCT4 expression is significantly reduced by overexpression of exogenous GCNF, but increased by GCNF shRNA-mediated knockdown. The transcriptional activity of OCT4 is significantly inhibited by dose-dependent overexpression of GCNF. While mutants at each of the NR binding sites retain the repressive effects of GCNF on OCT4 promoter activity, the repressive effect was completely eliminated in the reporter construct with all binding sites mutated even in the presence of GCNF. Furthermore, the transcriptional activity of native minimal promoter (CR1-Luc) containing the first NR binding site was significantly reduced by GCNF overexpression, while the mutant retained basal activity to some extent. Next, an exogenous minimal ti promoter-inserted CR2 reporter construct containing the second and third NR binding sites (CR2-ti-Luc) was co-transfected with GCNF expression vector. The transcriptional activity of CR2-ti-Luc was significantly decreased by GCNF overexpression, while mutation of both binding sites retained the transcriptional activity of the reporter construct. Binding assays confirmed the direct interaction of GCNF with all three NR binding sites cooperatively. Taken together, GCNF acts as a transcriptional repressor in the regulation of OCT4 gene expression through cooperative interaction with three NR binding elements in pluripotent NCCIT cells.
Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have identified dozens of loci associated with gout, but for most cases, the risk genes and the underlying molecular mechanisms contributing to these associations are unknown. This study sought to understand the molecular mechanism of a common genetic variant, rs780093, in the development of gout, both in vitro and in vivo.
Nuclear receptor binding protein 1 (NRBP1), as a gout risk gene, and its regulatory region, 72 bp upstream of the transcription start site, designated as B1, were identified through integrative analyses of genome-wide genotype and DNA methylation data. We observed elevated NRBP1 expression in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from gout patients. In vitro luciferase reporter and protein pulldown assay results showed that DNA methylation could increase the binding of the transcription factor TFAP2A to B1, leading to suppressed gene expression. There results were further confirmed by in vivo bisulfite pyrosequencing showing that hypomethylation on B1 is associated with increased NRBP1 expression in gout patients.
Hypomethylation at the promoter region of NRBP1 reduces the binding of TFAP2A and thus leads to elevated NRBP1 expression, which might contribute to the development of gout.
A growth factor, as initially defined, is a secreted biologically active molecule that can affect the growth of cells. This definition has been expanded to include secreted molecules that promote or inhibit mitosis or affect cellular differentiation. Growth factors can act on specific cell surface receptors that subsequently transmit their growth signals to other intracellular components and eventually result in altered gene expression. The general process of transmitting an external molecular signal to a cell to evoke a cellular response is called signal transduction.[1][2][3] Protein phosphorylation cascades play a key role in transmitting growth signals. Enzymes with kinase activity or phosphatase activity are important in this signaling process. Kinases put a phosphate group on a protein, and phosphatases take off a phosphate group. Many growth factors are peptides/proteins, and this type of growth factor typically binds with high affinity to a specific surface receptor which is a plasma membrane-bound protein. A peptide is defined as having between two and 50 amino acid residues, whereas a protein has more than 50 amino acid residues. The receptor binding site for peptide/protein growth factors is on the outer cell membrane surface, in other words, the extracellular domain. Most cell surface receptors for growth factors show tyrosine kinase activity, meaning they put a phosphate group on a downstream protein tyrosine residue. An exception is the surface receptors for the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) family of cytokines. When activated by the binding of TGF-beta cytokines, this receptor can phosphorylate downstream proteins on serine and threonine residues. “Downstream” here means an event triggered after TGF-beta binding to its receptor.[4] Some growth factors are small peptides called cytokines. While all cytokines affect signal transduction pathways, only those cytokines affecting cell growth/differentiation signaling pathways are considered growth factors. Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) is an example of a cytokine growth factor since it promotes the production of white blood cells by stem cells. Examples of protein growth factors are vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), epidermal growth factor (EGF) and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF). Growth factor specificity to particular cells types can be achieved by the expression of highly specific cell surface receptors. For example, some growth factors act only hematopoietic cells which are cells derived from bone marrow. Some growth factors like lipid-soluble steroid hormones, do not have a surface receptor and can directly pass through the cell's plasma membrane, bind to an intracellular protein receptor, or nuclear receptors, and then transmit a growth signal. All hormones are produced by glands and are secreted into the circulatory system. Estrogens, androgens, and progestogens are examples of steroid hormones that are growth factors. Not all hormones are growth factors, only those affecting cell growth/differentiation. Even simple small molecules such as nitric oxide or reactive oxygen species (ROS) can act as growth factors.[5]
Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors (VEGFs) are promising molecules for the treatment of ischemic diseases by pro-angiogenic therapy. Snake venom VEGFs are a novel subgroup with unique receptor binding profiles and as such are potential new therapeutic agents. We determined the ligand-receptor interactions, gene regulation and angiogenic properties of Vipera ammodytes venom VEGF, Vammin, and compared it to the canonical angiogenic factor VEGF-A to evaluate the use of Vammin for therapeutic angiogenesis. Vammin efficiently induced VEGFR-2 mediated proliferation and expression of genes associated with proliferation, migration and angiogenesis. VEGF-A165 and especially VEGF-A109 induced less pronounced effects. Vammin regulates a number of signaling pathways by inducing the expression of NR4A family nuclear receptors and regulators of calcium signaling and MAP kinase pathways. Interestingly, MARC1, which encodes an enzyme discovered to catalyze reduction of nitrate to NO, was identified as a novel VEGFR-2 regulated gene. In rabbit skeletal muscle adenoviral delivery of Vammin induced prominent angiogenic responses. Both the vector dose and the co-receptor binding of the ligand were critical parameters controlling the type of angiogenic response from sprouting angiogenesis to vessel enlargement. Vammin induced VEGFR-2/NRP-1 mediated signaling more effectively than VEGF-A, consequently it is a promising candidate for development of pro-angiogenic therapies.
Mounting evidence demonstrates that CYP2B6 plays a much larger role in human drug metabolism than was previously believed. The discovery of multiple important substrates of CYP2B6 as well as polymorphic differences has sparked increasing interest in the genetic and xenobiotic factors contributing to the expression and function of the enzyme. The expression of CYP2B6 is regulated primarily by the xenobiotic receptors constitutive androstane receptor (CAR) and pregnane X receptor (PXR) in the liver. In addition to CYP2B6, these receptors also mediate the inductive expression of CYP3A4, and a number of important phase II enzymes and drug transporters. CYP2B6 has been demonstrated to play a role in the metabolism of 2%-10% of clinically used drugs including widely used antineoplastic agents cyclophosphamide and ifosfamide, anesthetics propofol and ketamine, synthetic opioids pethidine and methadone, and the antiretrovirals nevirapine and efavirenz, among others. Significant inter-individual variability in the expression and function of the human CYP2B6 gene exists and can result in altered clinical outcomes in patients receiving treatment with CYP2B6-substrate drugs. These variances arise from a number of sources including genetic polymorphism, and xenobiotic intervention. In this review, we will provide an overview of the key players in CYP2B6 expression and function and highlight recent advances made in assessing clinical ramifications of important CYP2B6-mediated drug-drug interactions.
Many patients worldwide suffer from cardiovascular diseases for which an underlying factor is thrombosis. Devising a molecular imaging technique for early detection of thrombosis in a clinical setting is highly recommended. Because fibrin is a major constituent of clots and is present in all types of thrombi but absent in circulation, it is a highly specific and sensitive target for molecular imaging of thrombi. It is assumed that cyclization of peptides will improve the receptor binding affinity and stability of the peptide. In the present study, we have developed linear and cyclic fibrin-binding peptides for thrombus imaging and compared their biological properties.
Linear HYNIC-GPRPP and cyclic HYNIC-CGPRPPC peptides were synthesized using a standard Fmoc strategy and radiolabeled with Tc-99m. The stability of the radiolabeled peptides in human plasma and their affinity for fibrin and blood clots were determined. Blood clearance and biodistribution were evaluated in rats and mice, respectively. The peptide with the highest affinity was injected to a live rabbit femoral thrombosis model, and scintigraphic images were obtained.
In vitro studies show that peptides are stable in human plasma and have a high affinity for human fibrin. They also demonstrated fast blood clearance in rats and high thrombus uptake in the Balb/c mice femoral thrombosis model. Femoral thrombosis was visualized 30 min postinjection of cyclic peptide in a live rabbit model using single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT)/X-ray computed tomography.
The results indicate that the cyclic peptide is a promising agent for molecular imaging of fibrin using SPECT.
Human gliomas represent the most common type of intracranial tumors, with highest morbidity and mortality. They are characterized by excessive invasiveness and cell proliferation while their unclear boundaries predispose to tumor recurrence soon after conventional treatment. Elucidation of the molecular mechanisms implicated in their development and/or treatment resistance is highly demanded. The high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) protein, a highly conserved nuclear protein that functions as a chromatin-binding factor, facilitating nucleosome stabilization and regulating gene transcription, has been implicated in glioma formation and progression. Extracellular released HMGB1 binds to high-affinity receptors, including the receptor for advanced glycation end-products (RAGE) and toll-like receptor (TLR)-2, TLR-4, and TLR-9. Upon receptor binding, HMGB1 triggers the activation of key signaling pathways and immune responses, involved in the regulation of cell growth, differentiation, motility, and apoptosis. Based on the type of receptor and/or cell, HMGB1 is capable to promote oncogenesis or suppress tumor growth, thus affecting treatment efficacy. Herein, we discuss recent evidence implicating HMGB1 in glioma cell differentiation, proliferation, and metastasis with both clinical and prognostic significance. In addition, potential therapeutic approaches to target this protein in order to reduce chemoresistance of glioma cells are also addressed.
Adipose tissue remodeling occurs in obesity, characterized by adipocyte hypertrophy and increased infiltration of macrophages which also shift to a proinflammatory phenotype. Factors derived from these macrophages significantly alter adipocyte function, such as repressing adipogenesis, inducing inflammatory response and desensitizing insulin action. As macrophages produce a cocktail of inflammatory signals, identifying the key factors that mediate the detrimental effects may offer effective therapeutic targets. IL-1β, a major cytokine produced largely by macrophages, is implicated in the development of obesity-associated insulin resistance. In this article, we discuss recent advances in our understanding of the role of IL-1β in macrophage-adipocyte crosstalk in obesity. IL-1β impairs insulin sensitivity in adipose tissue by inhibition of insulin signal transduction. Blocking the activity of IL-1β, its receptor binding or production improves insulin signaling and action in human adipocytes. This is in parallel with a reduction in macrophage-stimulated proinflammatory profile and lipolysis. Targeting IL-1β may be beneficial for protecting against obesity-related insulin resistance at the tissue and systemic levels. 
This study aimed to evaluate the potential of PEGylated dimeric GX1 peptide as a radiotracer for imaging of colorectal cancer vasculature in a LoVo tumor xenografted mouse model.
The [(99m)Tc]PEG-(GX1)2 peptide was synthesized and identified. Confocal immunofluorescence analysis, receptor binding assay, and competitive inhibition assay were performed to evaluate the binding specificity and the receptor binding affinity of PEG-(GX1)2 to Co-human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Single photon emission computed tomography imaging and biodistribution were performed to evaluate the targeting ability of PEG-(GX1)2 to colorectal cancer.
The studies in vitro suggested that PEG-(GX1)2 co-localized with Factor VIII in the perinuclear cytoplasm of Co-HUVECs and bound specifically to Co-HUVECs with a high affinity. The studies in vivo demonstrated that the targeting efficacy of PEG-(GX1)2 was superior to GX1.
PEGylation improved the affinity and the targeting ability of the GX1 peptide. PEG-(GX1)2 is a more promising probe for imaging of colorectal vasculature than GX1.
PICK1 is a modular scaffold implicated in synaptic receptor trafficking. It features a PDZ domain, a BAR domain, and an acidic C-terminal tail (ACT). Analysis by small- angle x-ray scattering suggests a structural model that places the receptor-binding site of the PDZ domain and membrane-binding surfaces of the BAR and PDZ domains adjacent to each other on the concave side of the banana-shaped PICK1 dimer. In the model, the ACT of one subunit of the dimer interacts with the PDZ and BAR domains of the other subunit, possibly accounting for autoinhibition. Consistently, full-length PICK1 shows diffuse cytoplasmic localization, but it clusters on vesicle-like structures that colocalize with the trans-Golgi network marker TGN38 upon deletion of either the ACT or PDZ domain. This localization is driven by the BAR domain. Live-cell imaging further reveals that PICK1-associated vesicles undergo fast, nondirectional motility in an F-actin-dependent manner, but deleting the ACT dramatically reduces vesicle speed. Thus the ACT links PICK1-associated vesicles to a motility factor, likely myosin, but, contrary to previous reports, PICK1 neither binds nor inhibits Arp2/3 complex.
High fat (HF) diets are known to induce changes in synaptic plasticity in the forebrain leading to learning and memory impairments. Previous studies of oleanolic acid derivatives have found that these compounds can cross the blood-brain barrier to prevent neuronal cell death. We examined the hypothesis that the oleanolic acid derivative, bardoxolone methyl (BM) would prevent diet-induced cognitive deficits in mice fed a HF diet. C57BL/6J male mice were fed a lab chow (LC) (5% of energy as fat), a HF (40% of energy as fat), or a HF diet supplemented with 10mg/kg/day BM orally for 21weeks. Recognition memory was assessed by performing a novel object recognition test on the treated mice. Downstream brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) signalling molecules were examined in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and hippocampus of mice via Western blotting and N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor binding. BM treatment prevented HF diet-induced impairment in recognition memory (p&lt;0.001). In HF diet fed mice, BM administration attenuated alterations in the NMDA receptor binding density in the PFC (p&lt;0.05), however, no changes were seen in the hippocampus (p&gt;0.05). In the PFC and hippocampus of the HF diet fed mice, BM administration improved downstream BDNF signalling as indicated by increased protein levels of BDNF, phosphorylated tropomyosin related kinase B (pTrkB) and phosphorylated protein kinase B (pAkt), and increased phosphorylated AMP-activated protein kinase (pAMPK) (p&lt;0.05). BM administration also prevented the HF diet-induced increase in the protein levels of inflammatory molecules, phosphorylated c-Jun N-terminal kinase (pJNK) in the PFC, and protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) in both the PFC and hippocampus. In summary, these findings suggest that BM prevents HF diet-induced impairments in recognition memory by improving downstream BDNF signal transduction, increasing pAMPK, and reducing inflammation in the PFC and hippocampus. 
Sotos syndrome, described in 1964, was characterized by overgrowth, a distinctive craniofacial configuration, and a non-progressive neurological disorder with mental retardation. There have been many developments since then and an update should be informative. The syndrome is associated with a number of abnormalities: brain, cardiac, urogenital, musculoskeletal (scoliosis), ophthalmologic, dental and neoplastic. It is a genetic disorder due to haploinsufficiency of the NSD1 gene (Nuclear receptor-binding SET Domain protein 1) on chromosome 5q35.2-35.3 in 90% of the patients: Sotos syndrome 1. Recently, heterozygous mutations in the NFIX gene (Nuclear Factor I, X type) on chromosome 19p13.3 were identified in a few children with the Sotos syndrome phenotype: Sotos syndrome 2. Genotype-phenotype correlations have been obtained. Many studies have been conducted to find out the functional pathway and the manner that the mutated genes altered transcription of other genes and the interaction with other proteins to generate the phenotype, but the functional pathway is largely unknown.
Erythropoietin (EPO) is used to treat anaemia associated with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Hypoxia is associated with anaemia and is known to cause a decrease in cytochrome P450 (P450) expression. As EPO production is regulated by hypoxia, we investigated the role of EPO on P450 expression and function.
Male Wistar rats were subjected to a 0.7% adenine diet for 4 weeks to induce CKD. The diet continued for an additional 2 weeks while rats received EPO by i.p. injection every other day. Following euthanasia, hepatic P450 mRNA and protein expression were determined. Hepatic enzyme activity of selected P450s was determined and chromatin immunoprecipitation was used to characterize binding of nuclear receptors involved in the transcriptional regulation of CYP2C and CYP3A.
EPO administration decreased hepatic mRNA and protein expression of CYP3A2 (P &lt; 0.05), but not CYP2C11. Similarly, EPO administration decreased CYP3A2 protein expression by 81% (P &lt; 0.001). A 32% decrease (P &lt; 0.05) in hepatic CYP3A enzymatic activity (Vmax ) was observed for the formation of 6βOH-testosterone in the EPO-treated group. Decreases in RNA pol II recruitment (P &lt; 0.01), hepatocyte nuclear factor 4α binding (P &lt; 0.05) and pregnane X receptor binding (P &lt; 0.01) to the promoter region of CYP3A were also observed in EPO-treated rats.
Our data show that EPO decreases the expression and function of CYP3A, but not CYP2C in rat liver.
The brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) Val66Met polymorphism (rs6265) may impact on the in-vivo binding of important serotonergic structures such as the serotonin transporter (5-HTT) and the serotonin-1A (5-HT1A) receptor. Previous positron emission tomography (PET) studies on the association between Val66Met and 5-HTT and 5-HT1A binding potential (BPND) have demonstrated equivocal results.
We conducted an imaging genetics study investigating the effect of Val66Met genotype on 5-HTT or 5-HT1A BPND in 92 subjects. Forty-one subjects (25 healthy subjects and 16 depressive patients) underwent genotyping for Val66Met and PET imaging with the 5-HTT specific radioligand [11C]DASB. Additionally, in 51 healthy subjects Val66Met genotypes and 5-HT1A binding with the radioligand [carbonyl-11C]WAY-100635 were ascertained. Voxel-wise and region of interest-based analyses of variance were used to examine the influence of Val66Met on 5-HTT and 5-HT1A BPND.
No significant differences of 5-HTT nor 5-HT1A BPND between BDNF Val66Met genotype groups (val/val vs. met-carrier) were detected. There was no interaction between depression and Val66Met genotype status.
In line with previous data, our work confirms an absent effect of BDNF Val66Met on two major serotonergic structures. These results could suggest that altered protein expression associated with genetic variants, might be compensated in vivo by several levels of unknown feedback mechanisms. In conclusion, Val66Met genotype status is not associated with changes of in-vivo binding of 5-HTT and 5-HT1A receptors in human subjects.
Liver X receptor (LXR) activators decrease atherosclerosis in mice. LXR activators (1) directly upregulate genes involved in reverse cholesterol transport and (2) exert anti-inflammatory effects mediated by transrepression of nuclear factor-κB target genes. We investigated whether myeloid cell deficiency of ATP-binding cassette transporters A1 and G1 (ABCA1/G1), principal targets of LXR that promote macrophage cholesterol efflux and initiate reverse cholesterol transport, would abolish the beneficial effects of LXR activation on atherosclerosis.
LXR activator T0901317 substantially reduced inflammatory gene expression in macrophages lacking ABCA1/G1. Ldlr(-/-) mice were transplanted with Abca1(-/-)Abcg1(-/-) or wild-type bone marrow (BM) and fed a Western-type diet for 6 weeks with or without T0901317 supplementation. Abca1/g1 BM deficiency increased atherosclerotic lesion complexity and inflammatory cell infiltration into the adventitia and myocardium. T0901317 markedly decreased lesion area, complexity, and inflammatory cell infiltration in the Abca1(-/-)Abcg1(-/-) BM-transplanted mice. To investigate whether this was because of macrophage Abca1/g1 deficiency, Ldlr(-/-) mice were transplanted with LysmCreAbca1(fl/fl)Abcg1(fl/fl) or Abca1(fl/fl)Abcg1(fl/fl) BM and fed Western-type diet with or without the more specific LXR agonist GW3965 for 12 weeks. GW3965 decreased lesion size in both groups, and the decrease was more prominent in the LysmCreAbca1(fl/fl)Abcg1(fl/fl) group.
The results suggest that anti-inflammatory effects of LXR activators are of key importance to their antiatherosclerotic effects in vivo independent of cholesterol efflux pathways mediated by macrophage ABCA1/G1. This has implications for the development of LXR activators that lack adverse effects on lipogenic genes while maintaining the ability to transrepress inflammatory genes.
Dysregulation of cholesterol homeostasis is associated with various metabolic diseases, including atherosclerosis and type 2 diabetes. The sterol response element binding protein (SREBP)-2 transcription factor induces the expression of genes involved in de novo cholesterol biosynthesis and low density lipoprotein (LDL) uptake, thus it plays a crucial role in maintaining cholesterol homeostasis. Here, we found that overexpressing microRNA (miR)-185 in HepG2 cells repressed SREBP-2 expression and protein level. miR-185-directed inhibition caused decreased SREBP-2-dependent gene expression, LDL uptake, and HMG-CoA reductase activity. In addition, we found that miR-185 expression was tightly regulated by SREBP-1c, through its binding to a single sterol response element in the miR-185 promoter. Moreover, we found that miR-185 expression levels were elevated in mice fed a high-fat diet, and this increase correlated with an increase in total cholesterol level and a decrease in SREBP-2 expression and protein. Finally, we found that individuals with high cholesterol had a 5-fold increase in serum miR-185 expression compared with control individuals. Thus, miR-185 controls cholesterol homeostasis through regulating SREBP-2 expression and activity. In turn, SREBP-1c regulates miR-185 expression through a complex cholesterol-responsive feedback loop. Thus, a novel axis regulating cholesterol homeostasis exists that exploits miR-185-dependent regulation of SREBP-2 and requires SREBP-1c for function. 
The aim of the present study was to investigate the protective effects of T0901317 (T0), a potent agonist of liver X receptors (LXRs), on high glucose-induced oxidative stress and apoptosis in H9c2 cardiac cells. Exposure of H9c2 cells to high glucose alone, not only caused a significant increase in apoptosis and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, but also led to a decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm), release of cytochrome c, decrease in Bcl-2, increase in Bax expression and the activation of caspase-3, caspase-9, poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) and nuclear factor (NF)-κB. However, pretreatment with T0 effectively decreased apoptosis, reduced the levels of ROS, abrogated ΔΨm, inhibited cytochrome c release and NF-κB activation, increased Bcl-2 and decreased Bax expression. In conclusion, our data suggest that T0 exerts protective effects against high glucose-induced apoptosis in H9C2 cardiac muscle cells via inhibition of ROS production, mitochondrial death and NF-κB activation. 
The transient receptor potential vanilloid type 1 (TRPV1) is crucial in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis; yet its role and underlying mechanism in the formation of macrophage foam cells remain unclear. Here, we show increased TRPV1 expression in the area of foamy macrophages in atherosclerotic aortas of apolipoprotein E-deficient mice. Exposure of mouse bone-marrow-derived macrophages to oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL) upregulated the expression of TRPV1. In addition, oxLDL activated TRPV1 and elicited calcium (Ca(2+)) influx, which were abrogated by the pharmacological TRPV1 antagonist capsazepine. Furthermore, oxLDL-induced lipid accumulation in macrophages was ameliorated by TRPV1 agonists but exacerbated by TRPV1 antagonist. Treatment with TRPV1 agonists did not affect the internalization of oxLDL but promoted cholesterol efflux by upregulating the efflux ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters ABCA1 and ABCG1. Moreover, the upregulation of ABC transporters was mainly through liver X receptor α-(LXRα-) dependent regulation of transcription. Moreover, the TNF-α-induced inflammatory response was alleviated by TRPV1 agonists but aggravated by the TRPV1 antagonist and LXR α siRNA in macrophages. Our data suggest that LXR α plays a pivotal role in TRPV1-activation-conferred protection against oxLDL-induced lipid accumulation and TNF-α-induced inflammation in macrophages.
The aim of this study was to analyze the expression patterns of key genes involved in lipid metabolism in response to feeding in chicks. A total of 18 thirteen day-old male chicks were fasted for 12h. The mRNA levels of the genes in the liver and white adipose tissue were analyzed after 0, 2, and 4h of refeeding. The mRNA levels of sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP) 1, liver X receptor α, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) γ, acetyl-CoA carboxylase α and fatty acid synthase were significantly increased after 2h of refeeding. In contrast, the mRNA levels of PPARα and carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1a were significantly decreased after 2h of refeeding. The mRNA level of acyl-CoA oxidase was significantly decreased after 4h of refeeding. The mRNA levels of cholesterol metabolism-related genes such as SREBP2 and 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase were significantly increased after 2h of refeeding. In the white adipose tissue, the mRNA level of PPARγ was significantly increased after 2h of refeeding, whereas the mRNA level of adipose triglyceride lipase was significantly decreased after 4h of refeeding. These results demonstrated that expression of lipid metabolism-related genes is regulated by short-term refeeding in chicks. 
Fatty acids influence human health and diseases in various ways. In recent years, much work has been carried out to elucidate the mechanisms by which dietary fatty acids control short-term and long-term cellular functions. We have reviewed herein the most recent studies on modulation of gene expression by fatty acids. A number of genes respond to transcription factors and present a transcription factor response element in their promoter regions. Fatty acids may exert their effects on metabolism by regulating gene transcription via transcription factors. Understanding how fatty acids control expression of metabolic genes is a promising strategy to be investigated by aiming to treat metabolic diseases such as insulin resistance, obesity, and type 2 diabetes mellitus.
Fatty acids exert many of their biological effects through the modulation of the activity of transcription factors, such as sterol regulatory element-binding proteins, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors, and liver X receptors.
Fatty acid action through transcription factors controls the expression of several inflammatory and metabolic genes.
CYP3A4 is a major drug-metabolizing enzyme in humans, whose expression levels show large inter-individual variations and are associated with several factors such as genetic polymorphism, physiological and disease status, diet and xenobiotic exposure. Nuclear receptor pregnane X receptor (PXR) is a key transcription factor for the xenobiotic-mediated transcription of CYP3A4. In this study, we have investigated a possible involvement of liver X receptor α (LXRα), a critical regulator of cholesterol homeostasis, in the hepatic CYP3A4 expression since several recent reports suggest the involvement of CYP3A enzymes in the cholesterol metabolism in humans and mice. Reporter assays using wild-type and mutated CYP3A4 luciferase reporter plasmids and electrophoretic mobility shift assays revealed that LXRα up-regulated CYP3A4 through the known DNA elements critical for the PXR-dependent CYP3A4 transcription, suggesting LXRα as a positive regulator for the CYP3A4 expression and a crosstalk between PXR and LXRα in the expression. In fact, reporter assays showed that LXRα activation attenuated the PXR-dependent CYP3A4 transcription. Moreover, a PXR agonist treatment-dependent increase in CYP3A4 mRNA levels was suppressed by co-treatment with an LXRα agonist in human primary hepatocytes and HepaRG cells. The suppression was not observed when LXRα expression was knocked-down in HepaRG cells. In conclusion, the present results suggest that sterol-sensitive LXRα positively regulates the basal expression of CYP3A4 but suppresses the xenobiotic/PXR-dependent CYP3A4 expression in human hepatocytes. Therefore, nutritional, physiological and disease conditions affecting LXRα might be one of the determinants for the basal and xenobiotic-responsive expression of CYP3A4 in human livers. 
Liver X receptors (LXRs) exert key functions in lipid homeostasis and in control of inflammation. In this study we have explored the impact of LXR activation on the macrophage response to the endogenous inflammatory cytokine IFN-γ. Transcriptional profiling studies demonstrate that ∼38% of the IFN-γ-induced transcriptional response is repressed by LXR activation in macrophages. LXRs also mediated inhibitory effects on selected IFN-γ-induced genes in primary microglia and in a model of IFN-γ-induced neuroinflammation in vivo. LXR activation resulted in reduced STAT1 recruitment to the promoters tested in this study without affecting STAT1 phosphorylation. A closer look into the mechanism revealed that SUMOylation of LXRs, but not the presence of nuclear receptor corepressor 1, was required for repression of the NO synthase 2 promoter. We have also analyzed whether IFN-γ signaling exerts reciprocal effects on LXR targets. Treatment with IFN-γ inhibited, in a STAT1-dependent manner, the LXR-dependent upregulation of selective targets, including ATP-binding cassette A1 (ABCA1) and sterol response element binding protein 1c. Downregulation of ABCA1 expression correlated with decreased cholesterol efflux to apolipoprotein A1 in macrophages stimulated with IFN-γ. The inhibitory effects of IFN-γ on LXR signaling did not involve reduced binding of LXR/retinoid X receptor heterodimers to target gene promoters. However, overexpression of the coactivator CREB-binding protein/p300 reduced the inhibitory actions of IFN-γ on the Abca1 promoter, suggesting that competition for CREB-binding protein may contribute to STAT1-dependent downregulation of LXR targets. The results from this study suggest an important level of bidirectional negative cross-talk between IFN-γ/STAT1 and LXRs with implications both in the control of IFN-γ-mediated immune responses and in the regulation of lipid metabolism.
Liver X receptor-α (LXRα), a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily of ligand-activated transcription factors, regulates de novo fatty acid synthesis that leads to stimulate hepatic steatosis. Although, resveratrol has beneficial effects on metabolic disease, it is not known whether resveratrol affects LXRα-dependent lipogenic gene expression. This study investigated the effect of resveratrol in LXRα-mediated lipogenesis and the underlying molecular mechanism. Resveratrol inhibited the ability of LXRα to activate sterol regulatory element binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c) and thereby inhibited target gene expression in hepatocytes. Moreover, resveratrol decreased LXRα-RXRα DNA binding activity and LXRE-luciferase transactivation. Resveratrol is known to activate Sirtuin 1 (Sirt1) and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), although its precise mechanism of action remains controversial. We found that the ability of resveratrol to repress T0901317-induced SREBP-1c expression was not dependent on AMPK and Sirt1. It is well established that hepatic steatosis is associated with antioxidant and redox signaling. Our data showing that expression of Sestrin2 (Sesn2), which is a novel antioxidant gene, was significantly down-regulated in the livers of high-fat diet-fed mice. Moreover, resveratrol up-regulated Sesn2 expression, but not Sesn1 and Sesn3. Sesn2 overexpression repressed LXRα-activated SREBP-1c expression and LXRE-luciferase activity. Finally, Sesn2 knockdown using siRNA abolished the effect of resveratrol in LXRα-induced FAS luciferase gene transactivation. We conclude that resveratrol affects Sesn2 gene induction and contributes to the inhibition of LXRα-mediated hepatic lipogenesis. 
Two previously reported DNA polymorphisms of sterol regulatory element binding transcription factor 1 (SREBP-1) and liver X receptor alpha (LXRα) and two DNA polymorphisms of fatty acid desaturase 1 (FADS1) were evaluated for associations with fatty acids in brisket adipose tissue of Canadian crossbred beef steers. The polymorphism of 84 bp insert/deletion in intron 5 of SREBP-1 was significantly associated with the concentration of 9c C17:1 (P=0.013). The G&gt;A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the exon 4 of LXRα gene was associated with the concentration of 9c, 11t C18:2 (P=0.04), sum of conjugated linoleic acids (CLA) (P=0.025) and 11c C20:1(P=0.042). Two DNA polymorphisms in the promoter region of FADS1, deletion/insertion of →GTG in rs133053720 and SNP A&gt;G in rs42187276, were significantly associated with concentrations of C17:0 iso, C17:0 ai, total branched chain fatty acids (BFA), 12t C18:1, 13t/14t C18:1, 15t C18:1, and 13c C18:1 (P&lt;0.05). Further studies are needed to validate the associations and to delineate the roles of the gene polymorphisms in determining the fatty acid composition in beef tissues.
Liver X receptors (LXRs) are nuclear receptors that act as ligand-activated transcription factors regulating lipid metabolism and inflammation. In the skin, activation of LXRs stimulates differentiation of keratinocytes and augments lipid synthesis in sebocytes. However, the function of LXRs in melanocytes remains largely unknown. We investigated whether LXR activation would affect melanogenesis. In human primary melanocytes, MNT-1, and B16 melanoma cells, TO901317, a synthetic LXR ligand, inhibited melanogenesis. Small interfering RNA (siRNA) experiments revealed the dominant role of LXRβ in TO901317-mediated antimelanogenesis. Enzymatic activities of tyrosinase were unaffected, but the expression of tyrosinase, tyrosinase-related protein-1 (TRP-1), and TRP-2 was suppressed by TO901317. Expressions of microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF), a master transcriptional regulator of melanogenesis, and cAMP-responsive element-binding activation were not affected. It is noteworthy that the degradation of MITF was accelerated by TO901317. Extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) contributed to TO901317-induced antimelanogenesis, which was evidenced by recovery of melanogenesis with ERK inhibitor. Other LXR ligands, 22(R)-hydroxycholesterol (22(R)HC) and GW3965, also activated ERK and suppressed melanogenesis. The intermediary role of Ras was confirmed in TO901317-induced ERK phosphorylation. Finally, antimelanogenic effects of TO901317 were confirmed in vivo in UVB-tanning model in brown guinea pigs, providing a previously unreported line of evidence that LXRs may be important targets for antimelanogenesis.
Periodontal disease is suggested to increase the risk of atherothrombotic disease by inducing dyslipidemia. Recently, we demonstrated that proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9), which is known to play a critical role in the regulation of circulating low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels, is elevated in periodontitis patients. However, the underlying mechanisms of elevation of PCSK9 in periodontitis patients are largely unknown. Here, we explored whether Porphyromonas gingivalis, a representative periodontopathic bacterium, -induced inflammatory response regulates serum PCSK9 and cholesterol levels using animal models.
We infected C57BL/6 mice intraperitoneally with Porphyromonas gingivalis, a representative strain of periodontopathic bacteria, and evaluated serum PCSK9 levels and the serum lipid profile. PCSK9 and LDL receptor (LDLR) gene and protein expression, as well as liver X receptors (Lxrs), inducible degrader of the LDLR (Idol), and sterol regulatory element binding transcription factor (Srebf)2 gene expression, were examined in the liver.
P. gingivalis infection induced a significant elevation of serum PCSK9 levels and a concomitant elevation of total and LDL cholesterol compared with sham-infected mice. The LDL cholesterol levels were significantly correlated with PCSK9 levels. Expression of the Pcsk9, Ldlr, and Srebf2 genes was upregulated in the livers of the P. gingivalis-infected mice compared with the sham-infected mice. Although Pcsk9 gene expression is known to be positively regulated by sterol regulatory element binding protein (SREBP)2 (human homologue of Srebf2), whereas Srebf2 is negatively regulated by cholesterol, the elevated expression of Srebf2 found in the infected mice is thought to be mediated by P. gingivalis infection.
P. gingivalis infection upregulates PCSK9 production via upregulation of Srebf2, independent of cholesterol levels. Further studies are required to elucidate how infection regulates Srebf2 expression and subsequently influences lipid metabolism.
25-hydroxycholesterol (25-HC) is one of the oxysterols, which are oxidized derivatives of cholesterol, and has been reported to be involved in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and Alzheimer's disease. In lung, the possible involvement of 25-HC in airway diseases has been revealed. In the present study, we examined whether 25-HC affects the release of cytokines and also modulates the responses of toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) in airway epithelial cells.
The effect of 25-HC on the release of cytokines from primary human bronchial epithelial cells after stimulation with or without polyinosine-polycytidylic acid [poly(I:C)], a ligand for TLR3, and the signal transduction were examined.
25-HC significantly potentiated the release of interleukin-8 (IL-8) and IL-6 from the cells. This effect was more potent compared with that of other oxysterols, 22-HC and 27-HC. GW3965 and TO901317, synthetic agonists of liver X receptors that are receptors for oxysterols, did not augment the IL-8 release. 25-HC enhanced the nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) DNA binding activity and translocation of phosphorylated c-Jun into the nucleus. The release of IL-8 was inhibited by the NF-κB inhibitor, caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE), an inhibitor of nuclear factor kappa-B alpha (IκBα) inhibitor, BAY 11-7085, and an inhibitor of nuclear factor kappa-B kinase-2 (IKK-2) inhibitor, SC-514, but not by a c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) inhibitory peptide, L-JNKi1. 25-HC significantly potentiated IL-8 release in poly(I:C)-treated cells and the augmentation was inhibited by CAPE, BAY 11-7085, and SC-514. Furthermore, 25-HC potentiated the translocation of interferon regulatory factor 3 into the nucleus and the release of interferon-beta (IFN-β) in poly(I:C)-treated cells.
These data demonstrated that 25-HC augments the release of IL-8 and IL-6 via NF-κB signalling pathway and enhances the release of IL-8 and IFN-β after stimulation of TLR3 in airway epithelial cells. 25-HC may be involved in the neutrophilic airway inflammation through the stimulant effect of IL-8 and IL-6 release and also potentiate the TLR3-mediated innate immunity in airway diseases.
Cardioactive glycosides exert positive inotropic effects on cardiomyocytes through the inhibition of Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase. We showed previously that in human hepatoma cells, digoxin and ouabain increase the rate of the mevalonate cascade and therefore have Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase-independent effects. In the present study we found that they increase the expression and activity of 3-hydroxy-3 methylglutaryl-CoA reductase and the synthesis of cholesterol in cardiomyocytes, their main target cells. Surprisingly this did not promote intracellular cholesterol accumulation. The glycosides activated the liver X receptor transcription factor and increased the expression of ABCA1 (ATP-binding cassette protein A1) transporter, which mediates the efflux of cholesterol and its delivery to apolipoprotein A-I. By increasing the synthesis of ubiquinone, another derivative of the mevalonate cascade, digoxin and ouabain simultaneously enhanced the rate of electron transport in the mitochondrial respiratory chain and the synthesis of ATP. Mice treated with digoxin showed lower cholesterol and higher ubiquinone content in their hearts, and a small increase in their serum HDL (high-density lipoprotein) cholesterol. The results of the present study suggest that cardioactive glycosides may have a role in the reverse transport of cholesterol and in the energy metabolism of cardiomyocytes.
3β-Hydroxysterol Δ24-reductase (DHCR24) catalyzes a final step in cholesterol synthesis, and has been ascribed diverse functions, such as being anti-apoptotic and anti-inflammatory. How this enzyme is regulated transcriptionally by sterols is currently unclear. Some studies have suggested that its expression is regulated by Sterol Regulatory Element Binding Proteins (SREBPs) while another suggests it is through the Liver X Receptor (LXR). However, these transcription factors have opposing effects on cellular sterol levels, so it is likely that one predominates. Here we establish that sterol regulation of DHCR24 occurs predominantly through SREBP-2, and identify the particular region of the DHCR24 promoter to which SREBP-2 binds. We demonstrate that sterol regulation is mediated by two sterol regulatory elements (SREs) in the promoter of the gene, assisted by two nearby NF-Y binding sites. Moreover, we present evidence that the dual SREs work cooperatively to regulate DHCR24 expression by comparison to two known SREBP target genes, the LDL receptor with one SRE, and farnesyl-diphosphate farnesyltransferase 1, with two SREs.
The balance between the rate of cholesterol uptake/accumulation and the rate of cholesterol efflux is reflected in the amount of lipid accumulation in macrophages. Based upon the fact that liver X receptors (LXRs) play a role in cholesterol efflux, we studied the effects of probiotics on cholesterol efflux and anti-inflammatory action in macrophages. We confirmed changes in LXR expression by treatment of LXR-transfected CHO-K1 cells with lactic acid bacteria (LAB), and co-cultured THP-1 cells with LAB to investigate changes in cholesterol efflux and inflammation.
The experiment with CHO-K1 cells showed upregulation of LXR-β by LAB. Treatment of THP-1 cells with LAB promoted LXR expression in THP-1, which eventually led to significant upregulation of ABCA1 and ABCG1 expression. The treatment with live LAB also significantly promoted cholesterol efflux. LAB suppressed expression of interleukin (IL)-1β and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, which resulted from activation of LXR.
Our study shows that Lactobacillus rhamnosus BFE5264 and Lactobacillus plantarum NR74 activated LXR and induced cholesterol efflux by promoting expression of ABCA1 and ABCG1. Both strains also suppressed proinflammatory cytokines including IL-1β and TNF-α. This study could account for the observation that LAB may block foam cell formation by cholesterol efflux and immune modulation.
Several studies have recently shown that haemoglobin drives a novel macrophage subset that is protected from foam cell formation.
In a previously overlooked area, two centres have independently shown that heme and haemoglobin drive an atheroprotective macrophage subset. We compare and contrast the approaches and findings of the laboratories and discuss some of the underlying biology and implications, concentrating on the aspects of lipidological relevance.
Treatments based on direct heme-mimetics or other agonists of this pathway have enormous potential for linked antioxidant protection via heme oxygenase 1 and reduced foam cell formation via liver X receptor, a potent combination for treating atherosclerosis.
There is growing evidence showing that prostate cancer cells have perturbed cholesterol homoeostasis, accumulating cholesterol to promote cell growth. Consequently, cholesterol-lowering drugs such as statins are being evaluated in prostate cancer treatment. Furthermore, natural products such as betulin (from birch tree bark) and tocotrienol (a minor form of vitamin E) have been shown to lower cholesterol levels. Using these drugs and oxysterols, we have determined which aspects of cholesterol homoeostasis should be targeted in prostate cancer, e.g. cellular cholesterol levels are increased by the transcription factor SREBP-2 (sterol-regulatory-element-binding protein isoform 2), whereas LXR (liver X receptor) promotes cholesterol efflux. Whereas betulin exerted non-specific effects on cell viability, tocotrienols produced a strong direct correlation between SREBP-2 activity and cell viability. Mechanistically, tocotrienols lowered SREBP-2 activity by degrading mature SREBP-2 independently of the proteasome. In contrast, no correlation was seen between LXR activity and cell viability, implying that SREBP-2 is a better target than LXR for prostate cancer treatment. Lastly, androgen-dependent and -independent LNCaP cells were both sensitive to tocotrienols. Overall, this suggests that tocotrienols and other drugs targeting the SREBP-2 pathway are a potential therapeutic option for prostate cancer.
The liver X receptor α (LXRα) is a nuclear receptor of the transcription factor and is known to play a crucial role in lipid metabolism processes such as bile acid and fatty acid synthesis in humans and rodents. However, very little information is available on the role of LXRα in the regulation of fatty acid synthesis in the goat mammary gland. In this investigation, a cDNA was isolated from the mammary gland of Xinong Saanen dairy goats and designated as goat LXRα. RT-PCR and RACE gave rise to the full-length cDNA of LXRα, which was comprised of 1654 bp and characterized by an ORF of 1344 bp and 5'- and 3'-UTR regions of 150 and 160 bp, respectively. The deduced amino acid sequence encodes 477 amino acids with a predicted molecular weight (MW) of 50.4kDa and a theoretical isoelectric point (pI) of 6.3. Additionally, homology search and sequence multi-alignment indicated that the putative goat LXRα amino acid sequence is very similar to those of cattle, mice, rats, swine, and humans. Bioinformatic predictions demonstrated that the LXRα protein is located in the nucleus, containing characteristic signatures of a nuclear receptor with DNA-binding domain (DBD) and ligand-binding domain (LBD). Real-time quantitative PCR suggested that LXRα was predominantly expressed in the small intestine, liver, spleen and mammary gland. Treatment of goat mammary gland epithelial cells (GMEC) with different concentrations (i.e., 0.01, 0.1, 1 μM) of T0901317, a synthetic agonist of LXRα, resulted in elevated sterol regulatory element binding protein 1 (SREBP1) and fatty acid synthase (FASN) mRNA levels in response to LXRα activation. The association between different T0901317 concentrations and fatty acid composition in GMEC also was examined using gas chromatography (GC). The results showed that activation of LXRα significantly increased GMEC C18:1 and C18:2 contents, but did not affect levels of saturated fatty acids (SFA). These discoveries are consistent with the notion that LXRα plays a key role in controlling lipogenesis and regulating synthesis of unsaturated fatty acids (UFA) in the mammary gland of goats, which may prove useful in regulation of milk fat production.
Induction of lipogenesis in response to insulin is critically dependent on the transcription factor, sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c). FoxO1, a forkhead box class-O transcription factor, is an important mediator of insulin action, but its role in the regulation of lipid metabolism has not been clearly defined. We examined the effects of FoxO1 on srebp1 gene expression in vivo and in vitro. In vivo studies showed that constitutively active (CA) FoxO1 (CA-FoxO1) reduced basal expression of SREBP-1c mRNA in liver by ∼60% and blunted induction of SREBP-1c in response to feeding. In liver-specific FoxO knock-out mice, SREBP-1c expression was increased ∼2-fold. Similarly, in primary hepatocytes, CA-FoxO1 suppressed SREBP1-c expression and inhibited basal and insulin-induced SREBP-1c promoter activity. SREBP-1c gene expression is induced by the liver X receptor (LXR), but CA-FoxO1 did not block the activation of SREBP-1c by the LXR agonist TO9. Insulin stimulates SREBP-1c transcription through Sp1 and via "feed forward" regulation by newly synthesized SREBP-1c. CA-FoxO1 inhibited SREBP-1c by reducing the transactivational capacity of both Sp1 and SREBP-1c. In addition, chromatin immunoprecipitation assays indicate that FoxO1 can associate with the proximal promoter region of the srebp1 gene and disrupt the assembly of key components of the transcriptional complex of the SREBP-1c promoter. We conclude that FoxO1 inhibits SREBP-1c transcription via combined actions on multiple transcription factors and that this effect is exerted at least in part through reduced transcriptional activity of Sp1 and SREBP-1c and disrupted assembly of the transcriptional initiation complex on the SREBP-1c promoter.
Pregnancy-associated plasma protein-A (PAPP-A) has been involved in the atherosclerotic process through regulation of local expression of IGF-1 that mediates the activation of the phosphatidylinositol-3 (PI3-K) and Akt kinase (Akt) signaling cascades which lead to constitutive nitric oxide formation, with its attending vasodilator, antiplatelet and insulin-sensitizing actions. In addition, IGF-1 may decreased cholesterol efflux through reductions of expression in ABCA1 and SR-B1 by the PI3-K/Akt signaling pathway. In the current study, we examined whether PAPP-A was involved in LXRα regulation and in expression of ABCA1, ABCG1 or SR-B1 through the IGF-I-mediated signaling pathway (IGF/PI3-K/Akt). Results showed that PAPP-A significantly decreased expression of ABCA1, ABCG1 and SR-BI at both transcriptional and translational levels in a dose-dependent and time-dependent manner. Cellular cholesterol content was increased while cholesterol efflux was decreased by PAPP-A treatment. Moreover, LXRα which can regulate the expression of ABCA1, ABCG1 and SR-B1, was also down-regulated by PAPP-A treatment. LXRα-specific activation by LXRα agonist almost rescued the down-regulation of ABCA1, ABCG1 and SR-B1 expression by PAPP-A. In addition, PAPP-A can induce the IGF-1/PI3-K/Akt pathway in macrophages. Furthermore, our results indicate that the decreased levels observed in LXRα, ABCA1, ABCG1 and SR-B1 mRNA and protein levels upon treating cells with PAPP-A were strongly impaired with the PI3-K inhibitors or IGF-1R siRNA while the MAPK cascade inhibitor did not execute this effect, indicating that the process of ABCA1, ABCG1 and SR-BI degradation by PAPP-A involves the IGF-1/PI3-K/Akt pathway. In conclusion, PAPP-A may first down-regulate expression of LXRα through the IGF-1/PI3-K/Akt signaling pathway and then decrease expression of ABCA1, ABCG1, SR-B1 and cholesterol efflux in THP-1 macrophage-derived foam cells. Therefore, our study provided one of the mechanisms for understanding the critical effect of PAPP-A in pathogenesis of atherosclerosis.
To investigate the regulation of cholesterol transporters, including ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1), ABCG1 and scavenger receptor class B, type I (SR-BI), by inflammatory stimuli in macrophages.                                               MATERIALS AND TREATMENTS:                          RAW 264.7 macrophages and mouse peritoneal macrophages were treated with inflammatory stimuli with or without rosiglitazone, a peroxisome proliferator activated receptor γ (PPARγ) agonist, or T0901317, a liver X receptor (LXR) agonist.
Real-time PCR and Western blotting for cholesterol transporters as well as cellular cholesterol efflux to high-density lipoprotein 2 (HDL(2)) were determined.
In RAW 264.7 macrophages, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) significantly reduced ABCG1 and PPARγ as well as cholesterol efflux to HDL(2). Rosiglitazone and T0901317 induced ABCA1 and ABCG1 several-fold, but LPS reduced only ABCG1. ABCG1 and SR-BI proteins, but not ABCA1, were decreased by LPS. In mouse peritoneal macrophages, LPS, tumor necrosis factor α and interleukin-1β decreased ABCG1, SR-BI, LXRα and PPARγ mRNA. The agonists increased ABC transporter expression but LPS reduced mRNA of T0901317-induced ABCA1 as well as basal and agonists-induced ABCG1. SR-BI protein was increased by rosiglitazone but LPS decreased the levels.
The data suggest that inflammatory insults repress ABCG1 and SR-BI expression partly dependent on PPARγ with a minimal effect on ABCA1 expression.
Diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) is characterized by myelin abnormalities; however, the molecular mechanisms underlying such deficits remain obscure. To uncover the effects of diabetes on myelin alterations, we have analyzed myelin composition. In a streptozotocin-treated rat model of diabetic neuropathy, analysis of sciatic nerve myelin lipids revealed that diabetes alters myelin's phospholipid, FA, and cholesterol content in a pattern that can modify membrane fluidity. Reduced expression of relevant genes in the FA biosynthetic pathway and decreased levels of the transcriptionally active form of the lipogenic factor sterol-regulatory element binding factor-1c (SREBF-1c) were found in diabetic sciatic nerve. Expression of myelin's major protein, myelin protein zero (P0), was also suppressed by diabetes. In addition, we confirmed that diabetes induces sciatic nerve myelin abnormalities, primarily infoldings that have previously been associated with altered membrane fluidity. In a diabetic setting, synthetic activator of the nuclear receptor liver X receptor (LXR) increased SREBF-1c function and restored myelin lipid species and P0 expression levels to normal. These LXR-modulated improvements were associated with restored myelin structure in sciatic nerve and enhanced performance in functional tests such as thermal nociceptive threshold and nerve conduction velocity. These findings demonstrate an important role for the LXR-SREBF-1c axis in protection from diabetes-induced myelin abnormalities.
To investigate the relationship of NOR-1 with the inhibition of inflammatory reaction in mice Kupffer cells (KCs) induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) via liver X receptor alpha (LXR alpha).
KCs from male KM mice were isolated by density gradient centrifugation, incubated and then randomly assigned to three groups: control group, LPS treated group and LPS+T0901317 treated group.
The mRNA and protein expressions of LXR alpha and NOR-1 in each group were determined by RT-PCR, immunofluorescent assay and western blot, respectively. The densities of TNF alpha and IL-10 in supernatants were evaluated by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The mRNA and protein expression levels of LXR alpha in LPS + T0901317 group were the highest as compared to the other two groups (0.748+/-0.072 and 1.217+/-0.133 respectively), The mRNA and protein expression levels of NOR-1 in LPS+ T0901317 group were the highest as compared to the other two groups (2.726+/-0.065 and 0.842+/-0.058 respectively). The densities of supernatant TNF alpha in LPS group and IL-10 in LPS+T0901317 group were the highest [(450.89+/-78.52) ng/L and (537.41+/-36.41) ng/L respectively].
Promoting the expression of LXR alpha in KCs can elevate the NOR-1 expression and then inhibit inflammatory reaction.
The aim of this study was to explore the effects of 22(S)-hydroxycholesterol (22(S)-HC) on lipid and glucose metabolism in human-derived cells from metabolic active tissues. Docking of T0901317 and 22(S)-HC showed that both substances fitted into the ligand binding domain of liver X receptors (LXR). Results show that while several lipogenic genes were induced by T0901317 in myotubes, HepG2 cells and SGBS cells, effect of 22(S)-HC varied more between cell types. In myotubes, most lipogenic genes were downregulated or unchanged by 22(S)-HC, whereas a more diverse pattern was found in HepG2 and SGBS cells. Treatment with 22(S)-HC induced sterol regulatory element binding transcription factor 1 in SGBS and HepG2 cells, but not in myotubes. Fatty acid synthase was downregulated by 22(S)-HC in myotubes, upregulated in SGBS and unchanged in HepG2 cells. De novo lipogenesis was increased by T0901317 in all cell models, whereas differently affected by 22(S)-HC depending on the cell type; decreased in myotubes and HepG2 cells, whereas increased in SGBS cells. Oxidation of linoleic acid was reduced by 22(S)-HC in all cell models while glucose uptake increased and tended to increase in myotubes and SGBS cells, respectively. Cholesterol efflux was unaffected by 22(S)-HC treatment. These results show that 22(S)-HC affects LXR-regulated processes differently in various cell types. Ability of 22(S)-HC to reduce lipogenesis and lipid accumulation in myotubes and hepatocytes indicate that 22(S)-HC might reduce lipid accumulation in non-adipose tissues, suggesting a potential role for 22(S)-HC or a similar LXR modulator in the treatment of type 2 diabetes.
Glucose transporter 4 (Glut4) is an important regulator of cellular glucose uptake in adipose tissue and skeletal muscle. The estrogen receptors α and β (ERα and ERβ) have been shown to regulate Glut4. However, the regulatory mechanisms are unclear, and there are conflicting results about the effects of the two ER isoforms on Glut4 activity. In this study we investigated how the lack of either ER isoform affects Glut4 expression in differentiated mouse embryonic fibroblasts. Our results demonstrate that Glut4 transcription is markedly reduced in cells lacking ERβ, both basally and upon induction by liver X receptor. These changes in Glut4 expression could not be explained by the lack of ERβ as ligand-activated transcription factor. They were rather brought about by hypermethylation of one single CpG in the Glut4 promoter in the ERβ-deficient cells. This CpG is part of an Sp1-binding site, and Sp1 binding was reduced by its methylation. Treatment with Sp1 inhibitor diminished Glut4 expression in wild-type, but not in ERβ-deficient cells, suggesting that reduced recruitment of Sp1 to the Glut4 promoter is responsible for the differences in Glut4 expression. Reintroduction of ERβ into ERβ-deficient cells partly restored Glut4 transcription and stabilized low DNA methylation after treatment with the DNA demethylating agent 5-Aza-2'-deoxycytidine. Our findings demonstrate the involvement of DNA methylation in Glut4 regulation and imply a novel function for ERβ in mediating epigenetic events and thereby regulating gene expression.
Leptin, a key hormone in regulating energy homeostasis, is mainly produced by adipocytes. Cogent evidence indicates a unique role of leptin in the promotion of liver fibrosis. Hepatic stellate cell (HSC) activation is a pivotal step in the process of liver fibrosis. Sterol regulatory element binding protein (SREBP)-1c, a critical transcription factor for lipid synthesis and adipocyte differentiation, functions as a key transcription factor in inhibition of HSC activation. SREBP-1c is highly expressed in quiescent HSCs and downregulated upon HSC activation. The aim of this study is to examine the effect of leptin on SREBP-1c gene expression in HSCs in vitro and in vivo and elucidate the underlying mechanisms. The results of the present study demonstrated that leptin strongly inhibited SREBP-1c expression in HSCs in vivo and in vitro. p38 MAPK was involved in leptin regulation of SREBP-1c expression in cultured HSCs. Leptin-induced activation of p38 MAPK led to the decreases in liver X receptor (LXR)-α protein level, activity and its binding to the SREBP-1c promoter, which caused the downregulation of SREBP-1c expression. Moreover, leptin inhibition of SREBP-1c expression via p38 MAPK increased the expression of alpha1(I) collagen in HSCs. Our results might provide new insights into the mechanisms of the unique role of leptin in the development of liver fibrosis and might have potential implications for clarifying the molecular mechanisms underlying liver fibrosis in diseases in which circulating leptin levels are elevated such as nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, type 2 diabetes mellitus and alcoholic cirrhosis.
Metabolic side effects caused by certain antipsychotic drugs (APDs), in particular clozapine and olanzapine, are now clinically well-documented. However, the potential mechanisms implicated in the metabolic disturbances of these drugs on peripheral tissues remain obscure. Here, we investigated the effects of five frequently prescribed APDs on the Sterol Regulatory Element Binding Protein (SREBP) transcription factor pathways which control lipogenesis and cholesterogenesis, using the Immortalized Human Hepatocyte cell model (IHH). First, clozapine, haloperidol, olanzapine and risperidone activated, at different levels, SREBP-1 activity reflected by an increased expression of SREBP-1 target genes involved in fatty acid biosynthesis (SREBP-1, FAS and/or SCD1) resulting in an accumulation of intracellular lipids. Second, clozapine and haloperidol also stimulated the SREBP-2 pathway associated with an increase in HMGCoAR expression. In contrast, quetiapine did not affect either the SREBP-1 or -2 pathways, but induced a slight accumulation of intracellular lipids. Interestingly, clozapine, haloperidol and olanzapine induced Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER) stress and, more precisely, initiation of the ER stress-activated eIF2α kinase (PERK) branch of the Unfolded Protein Response (UPR). Furthermore, treatment with thapsigargin, which increases intracellular calcium release, induced both ER stress and SREBP-1 and -2 pathway activation, whereas Ca(2+) chelation by BAPTA completely reversed the lipogenic effects and ER stress induction produced by clozapine. Based on these results, we propose that certain APDs induce ER stress via changes in Ca(2+) homeostasis in hepatocytes. This phenomenon potentially underlies a part of their known undesirable hepatic metabolic side effects. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder'.
Saturated fatty acids are implicated in the development of diabetes via the impairment of pancreatic islet β-cell viability and function. Liver X receptors (LXRs) and eicosapentaenoate (EPA) are known regulators of fatty acid metabolism. However, their roles in the pathogenesis of diabetes remain incompletely understood. The aim of this study was to determine the effects of EPA and the LXR agonist T0901317 on saturated fatty acid (palmitic acid)-induced apoptosis in the insulinoma β-cell line INS-1, a model for insulin-secreting β-cells. T0901317 significantly promoted palmitic acid-induced apoptotic cell death in the INS-1 cells. Consistent with these results, caspase-3 activity and BAX and sterol regulatory element binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c) mRNA levels were markedly increased in INS-1 cells co-administered palmitic acid and T0901317. The production of reactive oxygen species was considerably higher in the cells cultured concurrently with T0901317 and palmitic acid than in the cells incubated with either agent alone. EPA treatment attenuated the cellular death promoted by palmitic acid and T0901317 in the INS-1 cells, disclosing a possible mediating mechanism involving the inhibition of SREBP-1c. Finally, T0901317 up-regulated the palmitic acid-induced expression of p27(KIP1), transforming growth factor beta 1, and SMAD3 proteins in INS-1 cells. These results demonstrate that palmitic acid-induced apoptosis in β-cells is enhanced by T0901317 via the activation of LXRs and is blocked by EPA via the inhibition of SREBP-1c, suggesting that the regulation of lipogenesis and lipotoxicity affecting pancreatic β-cell viability and insulin production may be a unique strategy for diabetes therapy.
11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11β-HSD1) catalyzes the conversion of inactive glucocorticoids to active glucocorticoids and its inhibition ameliorates obesity and metabolic syndrome. So far, no studies have reported the effect of dietary vitamin A on 11β-HSD1 activity in visceral fat and liver under normal and obese conditions. Here, we studied the effect of chronic feeding of vitamin A-enriched diet (129 mg/kg diet) on 11β-HSD1 activity in liver and visceral fat of WNIN/Ob lean and obese rats.
Male, 5-month-old, lean and obese rats of WNIN/Ob strain (n = 16 for each phenotype) were divided into two subgroups consisting of 8 rats of each phenotype. Control groups received stock diet containing 2.6 mg vitamin A/kg diet, where as experimental groups received diet containing 129 mg vitamin A/Kg diet for 20 weeks. Food and water were provided ad libitum. At the end of the experiment, tissues were collected and 11β-HSD1 activity was assayed in liver and visceral fat.
Vitamin A supplementation significantly decreased body weight, visceral fat mass and 11β-HSD1 activity in visceral fat of WNIN/Ob obese rats. Hepatic 11β-HSD1 activity and gene expression were significantly reduced by vitamin A supplementation in both the phenotypes. CCAAT/enhancer binding protein α (C/EBPα), the main transcription factor essential for the expression of 11β-HSD1, decreased in liver of vitamin A fed-obese rats, but not in lean rats. Liver × receptor α (LXRα), a nuclear transcription factor which is known to downregulate 11β-HSD1 gene expression was significantly increased by vitamin A supplementation in both the phenotypes.
This study suggests that chronic consumption of vitamin A-enriched diet decreases 11β-HSD1 activity in liver and visceral fat of WNIN/Ob obese rats. Decreased 11β-HSD1 activity by vitamin A may result in decreased levels of active glucocorticoids in adipose tissue and possibly contribute to visceral fat loss in these obese rats. Studying the role of various nutrients on the regulation of 11β-HSD1 activity and expression will help in the evolving of dietary approaches to treat obesity and insulin resistance.
Atherogenesis is a long-term process that involves inflammatory response coupled with metabolic dysfunction. Foam cell formation and macrophage inflammatory response are two key events in atherogenesis. Adipocyte enhancer-binding protein 1 (AEBP1) has been shown to impede macrophage cholesterol efflux, promoting foam cell formation, via peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-γ1 and liver X receptor α (LXRα) downregulation. Moreover, AEBP1 has been shown to promote macrophage inflammatory responsiveness by inducing nuclear factor (NF)-κB activity via IκBα downregulation. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced suppression of pivotal macrophage cholesterol efflux mediators, leading to foam cell formation, has been shown to be mediated by AEBP1. Herein, we showed that AEBP1-transgenic mice (AEBP1(TG)) with macrophage-specific AEBP1 overexpression exhibit hyperlipidemia and develop atherosclerotic lesions in their proximal aortas. Consistently, ablation of AEBP1 results in significant attenuation of atherosclerosis (males: 3.2-fold, P = 0.001 [en face]), 2.7-fold, P = 0.0004 [aortic roots]; females: 2.1-fold, P = 0.0026 [en face], 1.7-fold, P = 0.0126 [aortic roots]) in the AEBP1(-/-)/low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR )(-/-) double-knockout (KO) mice. Bone marrow (BM) transplantation experiments further revealed that LDLR (-/-) mice reconstituted with AEBP1(-/-)/LDLR (-/-) BM cells (LDLR (-/-)/KO-BM chimera) display significant reduction of atherosclerosis lesions (en face: 2.0-fold, P = 0.0268; aortic roots: 1.7-fold, P = 0.05) compared with control mice reconstituted with AEBP1(+/+)/LDLR (-/-) BM cells (LDLR (-/-)/WT-BM chimera). Furthermore, transplantation of AEBP1(TG) BM cells with the normal apolipoprotein E (ApoE) gene into ApoE (-/-) mice (ApoE (-/-)/TG-BM chimera) leads to significant development of atherosclerosis (males: 2.5-fold, P = 0.0001 [en face], 4.7-fold, P = 0.0001 [aortic roots]; females: 1.8-fold, P = 0.0001 [en face], 3.0-fold, P = 0.0001 [aortic roots]) despite the restoration of ApoE expression. Macrophages from ApoE (-/-)/TG-BM chimeric mice express reduced levels of PPARγ1, LXRα, ATP-binding cassette A1 (ABCA1) and ATP-binding cassette G1 (ABCG1) and increased levels of the inflammatory mediators interleukin (IL)-6 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α compared with macrophages of control chimeric mice (ApoE (-/-)/NT-BM ) that received AEBP1 nontransgenic (AEBP1(NT) ) BM cells. Our in vivo experimental data strongly suggest that macrophage AEBP1 plays critical regulatory roles in atherogenesis, and it may serve as a potential therapeutic target for the prevention or treatment of atherosclerosis.
The liver X receptor (LXR) has recently been described in salmonids. In mammals, this receptor is already known as a transcriptional factor that regulates diverse aspects of cholesterol, fatty acid and carbohydrate metabolism in various tissues, including muscle. Here we examined LXR in trout myocytes. For this purpose, we analyzed LXR target gene expression and gene profile during myocyte development. In addition, we studied the transcriptional regulation of LXR by hormones, a pro-inflammatory mediator and unsaturated fatty acids. Trout myocytes were incubated with LXR agonists (T091317, 22(R)-hydroxycholesterol) and unsaturated fatty acids for 24h. Furthermore, differentiated myocytes were incubated with insulin and growth hormone (GH) for 3h, 6h and 18h, and with tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα) for 24h. Samples were also obtained in various stages of cell differentiation. Our results demonstrate that lipoprotein lipase (LPL), fatty acid synthase (FAS), ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-α and β (PPARα, β) are target genes of LXR in trout muscle. LXR agonists increased LXR expression, thereby indicating that this receptor is autoregulated. Unsaturated fatty acids downregulated LXR gene expression. This observation suggests a regulatory mechanism of these molecules on LXR-mediated fatty acid synthesis and uptake. TNFα did not modulate LXR gene transcription. Expression of the LXR gene was activated by insulin and GH. These results suggest that LXR may play a lipogenic role through insulin stimulation and a tendency to promote anabolic effects through GH on trout myocytes.
Macrophages serve essential functions as regulators of immunity and homeostasis, and their proliferation contributes to pathogenesis of certain disorders. In this report, we show that induction of macrophage proliferation by the growth factor M-CSF is negatively modulated by agonists that activate the nuclear receptor liver X receptor (LXR), both in vitro and in vivo. Both isoforms LXR α and β are involved in the antiproliferative actions of LXR ligands in macrophages. In contrast, M-CSF does not exert negative effects on LXR-mediated gene expression. Treatment with LXR agonists results in the accumulation of macrophages in the G(0)/G(1) phase of the cell cycle without affecting ERK-1/2 phosphorylation. The use of small interfering RNA or genetically modified mice revealed that, in contrast to other cellular models, functional expression of either the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27KIP1 or the cholesterol transporters ATP-binding cassette A1 or ATP-binding cassette G1 was not required for the antiproliferative effects of LXR agonists in macrophages. Western blot analysis revealed that protein expression of key molecules that regulate progression through the cell cycle, such as cyclins D1 and B1 and cyclin-dependent kinases 2 and 4, was downregulated upon LXR activation. These observations suggest a role for LXR agonists in limiting macrophage proliferative responses associated to pathogenic disorders.
PPARs and LXRs are ligand-activated transcription factors that are emerging as promising therapeutic targets for limiting atherosclerosis, an inflammatory disorder orchestrated by cytokines. The potent anti-atherogenic actions of these nuclear receptors involve the regulation of glucose and lipid metabolism along with attenuation of the inflammatory response. Similarly, cholesterol-lowering drugs, statins, inhibit inflammation. Unfortunately, the mechanisms underlying such inhibitory actions of these agents in human macrophages are poorly understood and were therefore investigated in relation to IFN-γ, a key pro-atherogenic cytokine, which mediates its cellular effects mainly through STAT1. Simvastatin and PPAR agonists had no effect on the IFN-γ-induced, phosphorylation-mediated activation of STAT1 and its DNA binding but attenuated its ability to activate gene transcription. On the other hand, LXR activators attenuated both DNA binding and trans-activation potential of STAT1 induced by IFN-γ. These studies reveal differences in the mechanism of action of agonists of PPARs (and simvastatin) and LXRs on the IFN-γ-induced, STAT1-mediated gene transcription in human macrophages.
Liver X receptors (LXRs) are nuclear receptors involved in cholesterol homeostasis. Notably, they are also expressed by T cells and are involved in regulating T cell proliferation and differentiation. In this issue of the JCI, Cui et al. have elucidated the molecular mechanism underlying the effects of LXR activation on a subset of T cells known as Th17 cells in mice and humans. Specifically, they showed that LXR-induced Srebp-1 inhibits Il17 transcription by binding to the Il17 promoter through interaction with the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (Ahr), a transcription factor known to enhance Th17 cell responses.
Adaptations in the oxidative capacity of skeletal muscle cells can occur under several physiological or pathological conditions. We investigated the effect of increasing extracellular glucose concentration on the expression of markers of energy metabolism in primary skeletal muscle cells and the C2C12 muscle cell line. Growth of myotubes in 25mM glucose (high glucose, HG) compared with 5.55mM led to increases in the expression and activity of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), a marker of glycolytic energy metabolism, while oxidative markers peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator 1α and citrate synthase decreased. HG induced metabolic adaptations as are seen during a slow-to-fast fiber transformation. Furthermore, HG increased fast myosin heavy chain (MHC) IId/x but did not change slow MHCI/β expression. Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) was shown to mediate the effects of HG on GAPDH and MHCIId/x. Carbohydrate response element-binding protein (ChREBP), a glucose-dependent transcription factor downstream of PP2A, partially mediated the effects of glucose on metabolic markers. The glucose-induced increase in PP2A activity was associated with an increase in p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase activity, which presumably mediates the increase in MHCIId/x promoter activity. Liver X receptor, another possible mediator of glucose effects, induced only an incomplete metabolic shift, mainly increasing the expression of the glycolytic marker. Taken together, HG induces a partial slow-to-fast transformation comprising metabolic enzymes together with an increased expression of MHCIId/x. This work demonstrates a functional role for ChREBP in determining the metabolic type of muscle fibers and highlights the importance of glucose as a signaling molecule in muscle.
Hypertriglyceridemia and fatty liver are common in patients with type 2 diabetes, but the factors connecting alterations in glucose metabolism with plasma and liver lipid metabolism remain unclear. Apolipoprotein CIII (apoCIII), a regulator of hepatic and plasma triglyceride metabolism, is elevated in type 2 diabetes. In this study, we analyzed whether apoCIII is affected by altered glucose metabolism.
Liver-specific insulin receptor-deficient mice display lower hepatic apoCIII mRNA levels than controls, suggesting that factors other than insulin regulate apoCIII in vivo. Glucose induces apoCIII transcription in primary rat hepatocytes and immortalized human hepatocytes via a mechanism involving the transcription factors carbohydrate response element-binding protein and hepatocyte nuclear factor-4α. ApoCIII induction by glucose is blunted by treatment with agonists of farnesoid X receptor and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-α but not liver X receptor, ie, nuclear receptors controlling triglyceride metabolism. Moreover, in obese humans, plasma apoCIII protein correlates more closely with plasma fasting glucose and glucose excursion after oral glucose load than with insulin.
Glucose induces apoCIII transcription, which may represent a mechanism linking hyperglycemia, hypertriglyceridemia, and cardiovascular disease in type 2 diabetes.
There exists a general recognition of the fact that LXR-α, being a member of the nuclear receptor family, plays a crucial role in the biological process that connects inflammation, cholesterol homeostasis, and cellular decisions. In this context the present study was addressed to understand the role of LXR-α gene in the selective and specific reprogramming of cancer cells into a state of apoptosis leaving the normal cells unaffected. The results of this study revealed that LXR-α gene when activated in cancerous cells of diverse origin results in the regulation of genes coding for Bcl-2, AATF, and Par-4 in a fashion, forcing these cells to enter into the state of apoptosis leaving the normal cells unaffected. On the basis of this study we propose that in near future LXR-α agonist (Withaferin A) may definitely find its use in the therapeutic interventions directed towards the treatment of cancer.
The liver X receptors (LXR) α and β regulate lipid and carbohydrate homeostasis and inflammation. Lxrβ⁻/⁻ mice are glucose intolerant and at the same time lean. We aimed to assess the associations between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in LXRβ and risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), obesity and related traits in 3 separate cohort studies.
Twenty LXRβ SNPs were identified by sequencing and genotyped in the HUNT2 adult nested case-control study for T2DM (n = 835 cases/1986 controls). Five tag-SNPs (rs17373080, rs2695121, rs56151148, rs2303044 and rs3219281), covering 99.3% of the entire common genetic variability of the LXRβ gene were identified and genotyped in the French MONICA adult study (n = 2318) and the European adolescent HELENA cross-sectional study (n = 1144). In silico and in vitro functionality studies were performed.
We identified suggestive or significant associations between rs17373080 and the risk of (i) T2DM in HUNT2 (OR = 0.82, p = 0.03), (ii) obesity in MONICA (OR = 1.26, p = 0.05) and (iii) overweight/obesity in HELENA (OR = 1.59, p = 0.002). An intron 4 SNP (rs28514894, a perfect proxy for rs17373080) could potentially create binding sites for hepatic nuclear factor 4 alpha (HNF4α) and nuclear factor 1 (NF1). The C allele of rs28514894 was associated with ~1.25-fold higher human LXRβ basal promoter activity in vitro. However, no differences between alleles in terms of DNA binding and reporter gene transactivation by HNF4α or NF1 were observed.
Our results suggest that rs17373080 in LXRβ is associated with T2DM and obesity, maybe via altered LXRβ expression.
NAFLD (non-alcoholic fatty liver disease) is one of the most frequent chronic liver diseases worldwide. The metabolic factors associated with NAFLD are also determinants of liver disease progression in chronic HCV (hepatitis C virus) infection. It has been reported that, besides inducing hepatic fatty acid biosynthesis, LXR (liver X receptor) regulates a set of inflammatory genes. We aimed to evaluate the hepatic expression of LXRα and its lipogenic and inflammatory targets in 43 patients with NAFLD, 44 with chronic HCV infection and in 22 with histologically normal liver. Real-time PCR and Western blot analysis were used to determine hepatic expression levels of LXRα and related lipogenic and inflammatory mediators in the study population. We found that the LXRα gene and its lipogenic targets PPAR-γ (peroxisome-proliferator-activated receptor-γ), SREBP (sterol-regulatory-element-binding protein)-1c, SREBP-2 and FAS (fatty acid synthase) were overexpressed in the liver of NAFLD and HCV patients who had steatosis. Moreover, up-regulation of inflammatory genes, such as TNF (tumour necrosis factor)-α, IL (interleukin)-6, OPN (osteopontin), iNOS (inducible NO synthase), COX (cyclo-oxygenase)-2 and SOCS (suppressors of cytokine signalling)-3, was observed in NAFLD and HCV patients. Interestingly, TNF-α, IL-6 and osteopontin gene expression was lower in patients with steatohepatitis than in those with steatosis. In conclusion, hepatic expression of LXRα and its related lipogenic and inflammatory genes is abnormally increased in NAFLD and HCV patients with steatosis, suggesting a potential role of LXRα in the pathogenesis of hepatic steatosis in these chronic liver diseases.
Liver X receptor α (LXRα) is a nuclear transcription factor that regulates lipid metabolism. Recently, it has been shown that activation of LXRα with synthetic ligands has anti-inflammatory effects in atherosclerosis and chemical-induced dermatitis. We investigated the effect of the LXRα agonist, T0901317, on lung inflammation in a rodent model of hemorrhagic shock. Hemorrhagic shock was induced in male rats by withdrawing blood to a goal mean arterial blood pressure of 50 mmHg. Blood pressure was maintained at this level for 3 h, at which point rats were rapidly resuscitated with shed blood. Animals were then treated with T0901317 (50 mg · kg) or vehicle i.p. and sacrificed at 1, 2, and 3 h after resuscitation. Treatment with T0901317 significantly improved the cardiac and stroke volume indices as well as the heart rate of rats during the resuscitation period as compared with vehicle-treated rats. The T0901317-treated animals showed significant improvement in the plasma level of lactate, whereas base deficit and bicarbonate levels both trended toward improvement. The T0901317-treated animals also showed lower levels of plasma cytokines and chemokines monocyte chemoattractant protein 1, macrophage inflammatory protein 1α, TNF-α, KC, and IL-6. Lung injury and neutrophil infiltration were reduced by treatment with T0901317, as evaluated by histology and myeloperoxidase assay. At molecular analysis, treatment with T0901317 increased nuclear LXRα expression and DNA binding while also inhibiting activation of nuclear factor κB, a proinflammatory transcription factor, in the lung. Thus, our data suggest that LXRα is an important modulator of the inflammatory response and lung injury after severe hemorrhagic shock, likely through the inhibition of the nuclear factor κB pathway.
Apolipoprotein A-I (ApoA-I) is the main anti-atherogenic component of human high-density lipoproteins (HDL). ApoA-I gene expression is regulated by several nuclear receptors, which are the sensors for metabolic changes during development of cardiovascular diseases. Activation of nuclear receptor PPARγ has been shown to impact lipid metabolism as well as inflammation. Here, we have shown that synthetic PPARγ agonist GW1929 decreases both ApoA-I mRNA and protein levels in HepG2 cells and the effect of GW1929 on apoA-I gene transcription depends on PPARγ. PPARγ binds to the sites A and C within the hepatic enhancer of apoA-I gene and the negative regulation of apoA-I gene transcription by PPARγ appears to be realized via the site C (-134 to -119). Ligand activation of PPARγ leads to an increase of LXRβ and a decrease of PPARα binding to the apoA-I gene hepatic enhancer in HepG2 cells. GW1929 abolishes the TNFα-mediated decrease of ApoA-I mRNA expression in both HepG2 and Caco-2 cells but does not block TNFα-mediated inhibition of ApoA-I protein secretion by HepG2 cells. These data demonstrate that complex of PPARγ with GW1929 is a negative regulator involved in the control of ApoA-I expression and secretion in human hepatocyte- and enterocyte-like cells. J. Cell.

Sterol regulatory element binding protein-1 (SREBP-1) is a key transcription factor that regulates lipogenesis in rodent liver. Two isoforms (SREBP-1a and SREBP-1c) of SREBP-1 are transcribed by an alternative promoter on the same gene (SREBF1), and the isoforms differ only in their first exon. Although the regulatory effects of SREBP-1 on lipid and milk fat synthesis have received much attention in ruminants, SREBP-1c promoter and its regulatory mechanisms have not been characterized in the goat. In the present study, we cloned and sequenced a 2,012-bp fragment of the SREBP-1c 5'-flanking region from goat genomic DNA. A luciferase reporter assay revealed that SREBP-1c is transcriptionally activated by the liver X receptor α (LXRα) agonist T0901317, and is decreased by SREBP-1 small interfering (si)RNA. A 5' deletion analysis revealed a core promoter region located -395 to +1 bp upstream of the transcriptional start site (TSS). Site-directed mutagenesis of LXRα binding elements (LXRE1 and LXRE2) and sterol regulatory elements (SRE1 and SRE2) revealed that the full effects of T 4506585 require the presence of both LXRE and SRE. We also characterized a new SRE (SRE1) and demonstrated a direct role of SREBP-1 (auto-loop regulation) in maintaining its basal transcription activity. Results suggest that goat SREBP-1c gene is transcriptionally regulated by mature SREBP-1 (auto-loop circuit regulation) and LXRα in goat mammary epithelial cells. 
B-lymphocyte stimulator (BLyS) plays a critical role in the pathogenesis and progression of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Liver X receptor (LXR), a nuclear receptor, has an important anti-inflammatory effect. However, it is unclear whether the BLyS expression is regulated by LXR. In this study, we found that treatment with LXR agonist in collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) mice significantly attenuated arthritis progression, and markedly decreased BLyS production in serum and splenocytes as well as the production of serum IFNγ and TGFβ. Activation of LXR in B lymphocytes dramatically suppressed the basal and IFNγ/TGFβ-induced BLyS expression. Moreover, LXR agonist prominently suppressed the binding of NF-κB to BLyS promoter region, and decreased the promoter's transcriptional activity. Additionally, activation of LXR obviously repressed IFNγ-induced STAT1 activation and TGFβ-induced SMAD3 activation. These results indicated that downregulation of BLyS may be a novel mechanism by which LXR ameliorates RA, and LXR/BLyS pathway may serve as a novel target for the treatment of RA. 
High cholesterol and diabetes are major risk factors for atherosclerosis. Regression of atherosclerosis is mediated in part by the Liver X Receptor (LXR) through the induction of genes involved in cholesterol transport and efflux. In the context of diabetes, regression of atherosclerosis is impaired. We proposed that changes in glucose levels modulate LXR-dependent gene expression. Using a mouse macrophage cell line (RAW 264.7) and primary bone marrow derived macrophages (BMDMs) cultured in normal or diabetes relevant high glucose conditions we found that high glucose inhibits the LXR-dependent expression of ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1), but not ABCG1. To probe for this mechanism, we surveyed the expression of a host of chromatin-modifying enzymes and found that Protein Arginine Methyltransferase 2 (PRMT2) was reduced in high compared to normal glucose conditions. Importantly, ABCA1 expression and ABCA1-mediated cholesterol efflux were reduced in Prmt2-/- compared to wild type BMDMs. Monocytes from diabetic mice also showed decreased expression of Prmt2 compared to non-diabetic counterparts. Thus, PRMT2 represents a glucose-sensitive factor that plays a role in LXR-mediated ABCA1-dependent cholesterol efflux and lends insight to the presence of increased atherosclerosis in diabetic patients. 
Osteoarthritis (OA) development is associated with hypercholesterolemia in adults. Our previous study demonstrated that offspring with intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR) due to prenatal ethanol exposure (PEE) had a high risk of developing hypercholesterolemia and metabolic syndrome when fed a post-weaning high-fat diet (HFD). In this study, we examined the changes in articular chondrocytes of IUGR offspring induced by PEE and explored its intrauterine programming mechanisms related to cholesterol metabolism. Using the PEE/IUGR model, serum and tibias from female fetuses and adult female offspring fed a post-weaning HFD were collected and examined for cholesterol metabolism and histology. The results showed that PEE adult offspring manifested significant catch-up growth. Their serum total cholesterol (TCH) and low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol increased and high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol decreased; the osteoarthritis-like phenotype and an increased TCH content were observed in articular cartilage; and the expression of insulin-like growth factor1 (IGF1) and cholesterol efflux pathway, including ATP-binding-cassette transporter A1 and liver X receptor, was reduced. The expression of IGF1 and cholesterol efflux pathway was also lower in the PEE fetuses. This study showed PEE could induce an enhanced susceptibility to HFD-induced OA in adult female IUGR offspring. The underlying mechanism related to cholesterol accumulation in cartilage mediated by intrauterine programming. 
Sterol regulatory element binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c) is a master regulator of fatty acid synthase and controls lipogenesis. And insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) is a key insulin signaling mediator in skeletal muscle. The present study was conducted to explore the mechanism of SREBP-1c in the regulation of IRS-1 in skeletal muscle cells and elucidate the role of SREBP-1c in high fat-induced skeletal muscle insulin resistance.
L6 cells differentiated into myotubes in differentiation medium with 2%FBS. An in vitro insulin resistant model in L6 myotubes was established by 500 µmol/L of palmitate acid (PA). SREBP-1c, p-IRS-1(Tyr608/612), IRS-1, p-AKT (Ser473) and AKT were detected by Western blot after incubating L6 myobutes with 500 µmol/L of PA for 0.5, 1, 3, 6, 12, 18 or 24 h.SREBP-1c, FAS and molecules related to insulin signaling pathway were detected by Western blot when L6 myotubes over-expressed SREBP-1c or after a treatment of liver X receptor (LXR) agonist (TO901317, 5 µmol/L). The regulatory effects of transcription factor SREBP-1c on promoter region of IRS-1 were assessed by dual-luciferase reporter assay.
SREBP-1c protein expression increased significantly after 1-hour exposure to PA. The protein levels of p-IRS-1(Tyr608/612),IRS-1 and p-AKt (Ser473) decreased significantly after a 6-hour incubation of PA. However AKT protein levels were unaffected. The protein expressions of SREBP-1c and FAS were up-regulated by LXR agonist treatment versus controls. By contrast, LXR agonist treatment led to decreased expressions of IRS-1, p-IRS-1(Tyr608/612) and p-AKt (Ser473)/AKT proteins versus controls. The expressions of related proteins were similar to the observations made with LXR agonist intervention. The results of dual-luciferase reporter assay indicated that IRS-1 promoter activity was repressed significantly by SREBP-1c over-expression or TO901317 treatment whereas the dominant negative form of SREBP-1c (a mutant of Tyr320Ala lacking the ability of binding DNA) had no effect.
SREBP-1c may suppress IRS-1 expression and the subsequent insulin signaling pathway. And it plays a key role in PA-induced insulin resistance of skeletal muscle.
Osteoclasts are bone-resorbing cells that are important for maintenance of bone remodeling and mineral homeostasis. Regulation of osteoclast differentiation and activity is important for the pathogenesis and treatment of diseases associated with bone loss. Here, we demonstrate that retinoid X receptors (RXRs) are key elements of the transcriptional program of differentiating osteoclasts. Loss of RXR function in hematopoietic cells resulted in formation of giant, nonresorbing osteoclasts and increased bone mass in male mice and protected female mice from bone loss following ovariectomy, which induces osteoporosis in WT females. The increase in bone mass associated with RXR deficiency was due to lack of expression of the RXR-dependent transcription factor v-maf musculoaponeurotic fibrosarcoma oncogene family, protein B (MAFB) in osteoclast progenitors. Evaluation of osteoclast progenitor cells revealed that RXR homodimers directly target and bind to the Mafb promoter, and this interaction is required for proper osteoclast proliferation, differentiation, and activity. Pharmacological activation of RXRs inhibited osteoclast differentiation due to the formation of RXR/liver X receptor (LXR) heterodimers, which induced expression of sterol regulatory element binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c), resulting in indirect MAFB upregulation. Our study reveals that RXR signaling mediates bone homeostasis and suggests that RXRs have potential as targets for the treatment of bone pathologies such as osteoporosis. 
The desert gerbil, Psammomys obesus, is a unique polygenic animal model of metabolic syndrome (insulin resistance, obesity and type 2 diabetes), and these pathological conditions resemble to those in human beings. In this study, the animals were fed ad libitum either a natural diet (ND) which contained desertic halophile plants or a standard laboratory diet (STD) or a diet which contained eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), hence, termed as EPA diet (EPAD). In EPAD, 50% of total lipid content was replaced by EPA oil. By employing real-time PCR, we assessed liver expression of key genes involved in fatty acid metabolism such as PPAR-α, SREBP-1c, LXR-α and CHREBP. We also studied the expression of two inflammatory genes, i.e., TNF-α and IL-1β, in liver and adipose tissue of these animals. The STD, considered to be a high caloric diet for this animal, triggered insulin resistance and high lipid levels, along with high hepatic SREBP-1c, LXR-α and CHREBP mRNA expression. TNF-α and IL-1β mRNA were also high in liver of STD fed animals. Feeding EPAD improved plasma glucose, insulin and triacylglycerol levels along with hepatic lipid composition. These observations suggest that EPA exerts beneficial effects in P. obesus. 
To examine the cholesterol efflux and the expressions of ATP-binding cassette transporter G1 (ABCG1) in macrophages of diabetic patients and the roles of liver-X receptor (LXR) in regulation of ABCG1 expressions.
Blood was collected from patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and healthy controls. The peripheral blood monocytes were differentiated into macrophages with macrophage colony stimulating factor (M-CSF). The cells were radio labeled with [(3)H] cholesterol and were performed with cholesterol efflux assays. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT PCR) and Western blot were performed to measure the mRNA and protein expressions of ABCA1 and ABCG1. To test the effects of LXR on ABCG1 expressions, inhibition of LXRα and LXRβ by siRNA were performed. The DNA-protein complex of LXR and LXR element (LXRE) located in the promoter region of ABCG1 gene were detected with electrophery mobility supershift assay (EMSA).
Macrophage ABCG1 expressions and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) induced cholesterol efflux were significantly reduced (19.0%±1.2% vs. 12.8%±3.6%, t=2.532, P=0.016) in the diabetic subjects whereas ABCA1 expressions and apolipoprotein A1 (ApoA1) induced cholesterol efflux were comparable (12.0%±1.2% vs. 10.2%±2.3%, t=1.771, P=0.109) between the diabetic patients and healthy subjects. The mRNA expressions of LXRα and LXRβ had no changes between the diabetes subjects and healthy controls (t=1.025, P=0.315; t=-0.531, P=0.600). The LXR-LXRE DNA-protein complex detected by EMSA were also similar between the diabetes subjects and healthy controls (t=1.483, P=0.164). Moreover, ABCG1 expressions were not altered by inhibition of LXRα/β siRNA (t=2.143, P=0.061).
Our data indicated that expression of ABCG1 and HDL induced cholesterol efflux were reduced in type 2 diabetic patients. However, the LXR mRNA expression and binding complex of LXR and ABCG1 promoter were not changed. The impairment of cholesterol efflux and ABCG1 gene expressions might be regulated via an LXR-independent pathway.
Nuclear receptors (NRs), a family of 48 transcriptional factors, have been studied intensively for their roles in cancer development and progression. The presence of distinctive ligand binding sites capable of interacting with small molecules has made NRs attractive targets for developing cancer therapeutics. In particular, a number of drugs have been developed over the years to target human androgen- and estrogen receptors for the treatment of prostate cancer and breast cancer. In contrast, orphan nuclear receptors (ONRs), which in many cases lack known biological functions or ligands, are still largely under investigated. This review is a summary on ONRs that have been implicated in prostate and breast cancers, specifically retinoic acid-receptor-related orphan receptors (RORs), liver X receptors (LXRs), chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter transcription factors (COUP-TFs), estrogen related receptors (ERRs), nerve growth factor 1B-like receptors, and ‘‘dosage-sensitive sex reversal, adrenal hypoplasia critical region, on chromosome X, gene 1’’ (DAX1). Discovery and development of small molecules that can bind at various functional sites on these ONRs will help determine their biological functions. In addition, these molecules have the potential to act as prototypes for future drug development. Ultimately, the therapeutic value of targeting the ONRs may go well beyond prostate and breast cancers.
Brown fat activates uncoupled respiration in response to cold temperature and contributes to systemic metabolic homeostasis. To date, the metabolic action of brown fat has been primarily attributed to its role in fuel oxidation and uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1)-mediated thermogenesis. Whether brown fat engages other tissues through secreted factors remains largely unexplored. Here we show that neuregulin 4 (Nrg4), a member of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) family of extracellular ligands, is highly expressed in adipose tissues, enriched in brown fat and markedly increased during brown adipocyte differentiation. Adipose tissue Nrg4 expression was reduced in rodent and human obesity. Gain- and loss-of-function studies in mice demonstrated that Nrg4 protects against diet-induced insulin resistance and hepatic steatosis through attenuating hepatic lipogenic signaling. Mechanistically, Nrg4 activates ErbB3 and ErbB4 signaling in hepatocytes and negatively regulates de novo lipogenesis mediated by LXR and SREBP1c in a cell-autonomous manner. These results establish Nrg4 as a brown fat-enriched endocrine factor with therapeutic potential for the treatment of obesity-associated disorders, including type 2 diabetes and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). 
Although high density lipoprotein (HDL)-mediated reverse cholesterol transport is crucial to the prevention and reversal of atheroma, a recent meta-analysis makes evident that current pharmaceutical strategies for modulating HDL cholesterol levels lower cardiovascular risk only to the extent that they concurrently decrease low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol. This corresponds well with findings of a recent Mendelian randomization analysis, in which genetic polymorphisms associated with HDL cholesterol but no other known cardiovascular risk factors failed to predict risk for myocardial infarction. Although it is still seems appropriate to search for therapies that could improve the efficiency with which HDL particles induce reverse cholesterol transport, targeting HDL cholesterol levels per se with current measures appears to be futile. It may therefore be more promising to promote reverse cholesterol transport with agents that directly target foam cells. Macrophage expression of the cholesterol transport proteins adenosine triphosphate binding cassette transporter A1, adenosine triphosphate binding cassette transporter G1, and scavenger receptor class B member 1 is transcriptionally up-regulated by activated liver X receptors (LXR), whereas nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB antagonizes their expression. Taurine, which inhibits atherogenesis in rodent studies, has just been discovered to act as a weak agonist for LXRalpha. Conversely, it may be possible to oppose NF-kappaB activation in macrophages with a range of measures. Induction of heme oxygenase-1, which can be attained with phase 2 inducer phytochemicals such as lipoic acid and green tea catechins, promotes reverse cholesterol transport in macrophages and inhibits atherogenesis in rodents, likely due to, in large part, NF-kappaB antagonism. Inhibition of macrophage nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase activity with the spirulina-derived bilirubin-mimetic phycocyanobilin may also oppose NF-kappaB activation, and salicylic acid similarly should be useful for this purpose. The 5' adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase activator berberine promotes macrophage reverse cholesterol transport in cell culture; metformin probably shares this property. Many of these measures could also be expected to promote plaque stability by suppressing foam cell production of inflammatory cytokines and matrix metalloproteinases, and to reduce intimal monocyte infiltration by anti-inflammatory effects on vascular endothelium. Direct targeting of foam cells with agents such as phase 2 inducers, spirulina, salicylate, taurine, and berberine or metformin, may hence have considerable potential for preventing and reversing atheroma, and for preventing the plaque rupture that triggers vascular thrombosis. 
TG interacting factors (Tgifs) 1 and 2 are members of the TALE (three-amino-acid loop extension) superfamily of homeodomain proteins. These two proteins bind to the same DNA sequence and share a conserved C-terminal repression domain. Mutations in TGIF1 have been linked to holoprosencephaly, which is a human genetic disease that affects craniofacial development. As these proteins can interact with the ligand binding domain of retinoid X receptor α, a common heterodimeric partner of several nuclear receptors [e.g., liver X receptors (LXRs) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs)], Tgif1 and Tgif2 might repress other transcriptional pathways activated by lipids. In line with this, Tgif1 interacts with LXRα and Tgif1 null mice have increased expression of the two Lxrα target genes apolipoproteins (Apo) c2 and a4. Also, we have recently identified Tgif1 to function as a transcriptional repressor of the cholesterol esterifying enzyme acyl-coenzyme A:cholesterol acyltransferase 2 (gene name SOAT2). As no studies yet have shown involvement of Tgif2 in the lipid metabolism, this review will focus on the role of Tgif1 in lipid and cholesterol metabolism. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Linking transcription to physiology in lipodomics. 
The objective of this study was to examine the effect of trans-10,cis-12 conjugated linoleic acid (t10c12CLA) on the activation of transcription factors that potentially regulate lipid synthesis in a bovine mammary epithelial cell line (MAC-T). Cells were transfected with luciferase reporter constructs containing sterol response element (SRE and SRE complex) for sterol regulatory element binding protein-1, peroxisome proliferator response element for peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ, or liver X receptor response element for liver X receptor. Different concentrations of t10c12CLA (0, 25, 50, 75, or 100μM) were applied to cells to determine the activation of transcription factors. The influence of t10c12CLA bond structure on transcription factor activation was also investigated by treating cells with different 18:1 fatty acid isomers (trans-10 18:1 or cis-12 18:1) at 100μM. Cells were harvested for luciferase assay after 24h of treatment. Compared with linoleic acid and cis-9,trans-11 CLA controls, the SRE reporters had significantly lower activity in t10c12CLA-treated cells at 50 and 75μM for SRE complex and SRE, respectively. Lower SRE and SRE complex activation was observed in t10c12CLA treatment at 25, 50, and 75μM compared with 0μM. The peroxisome proliferator response element and liver X receptor response element reporters did not respond differently between the t10c12CLA treatment and controls. Compared with t10c12CLA, both trans-10 18:1 and cis-12 18:1 increased the activities of SRE and SRE complex reporters by 1.3- to 4.2-fold. In conclusion, t10c12CLA has an inhibitory role in lipogenic transcription factor activation of SRE, and this negative effect is due to the conjugation of trans-10 and cis-12 double bonds in the fatty acid. Furthermore, we found no support for a regulatory role of response elements for peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ or liver X receptor in the t10c12CLA inhibition of mammary lipid synthesis. 
Cyanidin-3-O-β-glucoside (C3G), a typical anthocyanin pigment that exists in the human diet, has been reported to have anti-inflammatory properties. The aim of this study was to detect the effect of C3G on LPS-induced acute lung injury and to investigate the molecular mechanisms. Acute lung injury was induced by intratracheal administration of LPS in mice. Alveolar macrophages from mice were stimulated with LPS and were treated with C3G. Our results showed that C3G attenuated lung histopathologic changes, myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity, TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6 production in LPS-induced acute lung injury model. In vitro, C3G dose-dependently inhibited TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-10 and IFN-β production, as well as NF-κB and IRF3 activation in LPS-stimulated alveolar macrophages. Furthermore, C3G disrupted the formation of lipid rafts by depleting cholesterol and inhibited TLR4 translocation into lipid rafts. Moreover, C3G activated LXRα-ABCG1-dependent cholesterol efflux. Knockout of LXRα abrogated the anti-inflammatory effects of C3G. In conclusion, C3G has a protective effect on LPS-induced acute lung injury. The promising anti-inflammatory mechanisms of C3G is associated with up-regulation of the LXRα-ABCG1 pathway which result in disrupting lipid rafts by depleting cholesterol and reducing translocation of TLR4 to lipid rafts, thereby suppressing TLR4 mediated inflammatory response. 
FGF21, a member of the fibroblast growth factor superfamily, is an important endogenous regulator of systemic glucose and lipid metabolism. Elevated serum FGF21 levels have been reported in subjects with coronary heart disease and carotid artery plaques. However, whether FGF21 is associated with atherosclerotic diseases remains unclear. In this study, the effects of FGF21 on cholesterol efflux in THP1 macrophage-derived foam cells and the underlying mechanisms were investigated. THP1 macrophage-derived foam cells were incubated with 0, 25, 50, 100, 200, and 400 ng/mL of FGF21 for varying time periods (0, 6, 12, and 24 h). Cholesterol efflux onto apoA-1 was assessed by high-performance liquid chromatography assays, while change in ABCA1 expression was analyzed by western blot and real-time quantitative PCR. Incubation was performed with the ERK1/2-specific inhibitor PD98059, PPARγ-specific inhibitor GW9662, and LXRα siRNA. Our results show that FGF21 promotes cholesterol efflux and ABCA1 expression in THP1 macrophage-derived foam cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. In addition, inhibition of ERK1/2 or PPARγ, or knockdown of LXRα attenuated FGF21-mediated promotion of ABCA1 expression and cholesterol efflux. These results demonstrate that FGF21 can promote cholesterol efflux by upregulating ABCA1 through the ERK1/2-PPARγ-LXRα pathway in THP1 macrophage-derived foam cells. 
Regulation of liver X receptors (LXRs) is essential for cholesterol homeostasis and inflammation. The present study was conducted to determine whether oleic acid (OA) could regulate mRNA expression of LXRα and LXRα-regulated genes and to assess the potential promotion of oxidative stress by OA in neutrophils.
Human neutrophils were treated with OA at different doses and LXR target gene expression, oxidative stress production, lipid efflux and inflammation state were analyzed.
We describe that mRNA synthesis of both LXRα and ABCA1 (a reverse cholesterol transporter) was induced by OA in human neutrophils. This fatty acid enhanced the effects of LXR ligands on ABCA1 and LXR expression, but it decreased the mRNA levels of sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1c (a transcription factor that regulates the synthesis of triglycerides). Although OA elicited a slight oxidative stress in the short term (15-30 min) in neutrophils, it is unlikely that this is relevant for the modulation of transcription in our experimental conditions, which involve longer incubation time (i.e., 6 h). Of physiological importance is our finding that OA depresses intracellular lipid levels and that markers of inflammation, such as ERK1/2 and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphorylation, were decreased by OA treatment. In addition, 200 μM OA reduced the migration of human neutrophils, another marker of the inflammatory state. However, OA did not affect lipid peroxidation induced by pro-oxidant agents.
This work presents for the first time evidence that human neutrophils are highly sensitive to OA and provides novel data in support of a protective role of this monounsaturated acid against the activation of neutrophils during inflammation.
Tumor necrosis factor- (TNF-) α is a proinflammatory proatherogenic cytokine. Infliximab, an anti-TNF-α monoclonal antibody, is effective in treating rheumatoid arthritis. However, its impact on cardiovascular burden and lipid transport is unclear. The present study investigates the effect of TNF-α and infliximab on reverse cholesterol transport (RCT) proteins. Uptake of modified lipoproteins by macrophages in the vasculature leads to atherogenic foam cell formation. RCT is mediated by proteins including ATP binding cassette transporters A1 (ABCA1), G1 (ABCG1), liver X receptor- (LXR-) α, and 27-hydroxylase. RCT counteracts lipid overload by ridding cells of excess cholesterol. THP-1 human monocytes were incubated with either TNF-α alone or TNF-α with infliximab. Expression of proteins involved in cholesterol efflux was analyzed. TNF-α significantly reduced both ABCA1 and LXR-α mRNA (to 68.5 ± 1.59%, P &lt; 0.05, and 41.2 ± 0.25%, P &lt; 0.01, versus control set as 100%, resp.). Infliximab nullified the TNF-α effect. Results were confirmed by Western blot. Infliximab abolished the increase in foam cells induced by TNF-α. TNF-α treatment significantly reduces ABCA1 and LXR-α expression in monocytes, thus bringing about a proatherogenic state. The anti-TNF drug infliximab, commonly used in rheumatology, restored RCT proteins. This is the first report of an atheroprotective effect of infliximab on RCT in monocytes.
LXR (liver X receptor) is a ligand-activated transcription factor and plays an important role in regulation of lipid homoeostasis and inflammation. Several studies indicate that LXR inhibits IFN-γ (interferon γ)-induced biological responses; however, the influence of LXR on IFN-γ expression has not been fully elucidated. In the present study, we investigated the effects of LXR activation on IFN-γ expression at different levels. At the molecular level, we surprisingly observed that LXR ligand (T0901317) induced macrophage and T-cell IFN-γ protein expression which was associated with increased mRNA and secreted protein levels in culture medium. In contrast, selective inhibition of LXRα and/or LXRβ expression by siRNA reduced IFN-γ expression. Promoter analysis defined the multiple LXREs (LXR-responsive elements) in the proximal region of the IFN-γ promoter. EMSAs and ChIP indicated that LXR activation enhanced the binding of LXR protein to these LXREs. In vivo, T0901317 increased wild-type mouse serum IFN-γ levels and IFN-γ expression in the lung and lymph nodes. Functionally, we observed that administration of T0901317 to wild-type mice increased rates of survival and being tumour-free, and inhibited tumour growth when the animals were inoculated with LLC1 carcinoma. In contrast, these protective effects were substantially attenuated in IFN-γ-knockout (IFN-γ-/-) mice, suggesting that the induction of IFN-γ production plays a critical role in T0901317-inhibited tumour growth. Taken together, the results of the present study show that IFN-γ is another molecular target of LXR activation, and it suggests a new mechanism by which LXR inhibits tumour growth. 
Sam-Hwang-Sa-Sim-Tang (SHSST) is a traditional Oriental medication that has been commonly used in Korea for the treatment of hypertension, insomnia, and chest pain. In addition, some studies reported that administration of SHSST results suppression of hyperlipidemia in rats or lowering lipid plasma level such as total cholesterol (TC). Those results made us find and demonstrate positive effect of SHSST much more. The aim of the current study was to examine whether SHSST exerts an effect against hepatic steatosis and two type of SHSST has different efficacy on liver steatosis.
Total 40 mice were divided randomly and equally into 4 groups: a normal diet (CON) group, high-cholesterol diet (HC) group, and treatment groups fed a high-cholesterol diet (HCD) with a 30% or 80% ethanol extract of SHSST (SHSST-L and SHSST-H, respectively). The HCD was given for 9 weeks. The SHSST-treated groups were orally administered SHSST at a dose of 150 mg/kg, whereas the other groups received physiological saline.
SHSST administration to mice resulted in a decline in serum levels of total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein. Histological examination showed that lipid droplets were smaller in the SHSST-treated group than in the HC group. At the protein level, expression of sterol regulatory element-binding protein 2 (SREBP-2) was suppressed by SHSST. In addition, the mRNA expression of cholesterol metabolism-related molecules such as SREBP-2, liver X receptor (LXR), low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR), and 3-hydroxy-3methylglutary-CoA (HMG-CoA) was also suppressed in SHSST-treated groups in the liver. In the aorta tissue, SHSST decreased the expression of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6), intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), vascular cell adhesion molecule-1(VCAM-1), transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1, and fibronectin.
The present study indicates that SHSST protects against liver steatosis and protects vessels against inflammation arising from excessive ingestion of cholesterol. These findings may also suggest that SHSST could be used as an adjuvant remedy for protection against liver steatosis.
Cadmium is a transition metal that is classified as human carcinogen by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) with multiple target sites. Many studies using various model systems provide evidence of cadmium-induced malignancy formation in vivo or malignant cell transformation in vitro. Nonetheless, further studies are needed to completely understand the mechanisms of cadmium carcinogenicity. Our prior studies have utilized a rat liver epithelial cell line (TRL 1215) as a model for cadmium-induced malignant transformation. In the present study, we focused on the molecular mechanisms of this malignant transformation, especially with regard to hyper-invasiveness stimulated by cadmium transformation. By performing a series of biochemical analyses on cadmium transformed cells, it was determined that cadmium had significantly down-regulated the expression of apolipoprotein E (ApoE). ApoE was recently established as a suppressor of cell invasion. A key factor in the suppression of ApoE by cadmium appeared to be that the metal evoked a 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine-sensitive hypermethylation of the regulatory region of ApoE, coupled with interference of the action of liver X receptor α (LXRα), a transcriptional regulator for ApoE. Furthermore, the expression of LXRα itself was suppressed by cadmium-mediated epigenetic modification. Re-expression of ApoE clearly abrogated the cell invasion stimulated by cadmium-induced malignant transformation. Together, the current results suggest that the cadmium-mediated enhanced cell invasion is linked to down-regulation of ApoE during malignant transformation these liver cells.
There is an accumulation of evidence indicating that the risk of Alzheimer's disease is associated with diabetes mellitus, an indicator of high glucose concentrations in blood plasma. This study investigated the effect of high glucose on BACE1 expression and amyloidogenesis in vivo, and we present details of the mechanism associated with those effects. Our results, using ZLC and ZDF rat models, showed that ZDF rats have high levels of amyloid-beta (Aβ), phosphorylated tau, BACE1, and APP-C99. In vitro result with mouse hippocampal neuron and SK-N-MC, high glucose stimulated Aβ secretion and apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, high glucose increased BACE1 and APP-C99 expressions, which were reversed by a reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenger. Indeed, high glucose increased intracellular ROS levels and HIF-1α expression, associated with regulation of BACE1 and Liver X Receptor α (LXRα). In addition, high glucose induced ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) down-regulation, was associated with LXR-induced lipid raft reorganization and BACE1 localization on the lipid raft. Furthermore, silencing of BACE1 expression was shown to regulate Aβ secretion and apoptosis of SK-N-MC. In conclusion, high glucose upregulates BACE1 expression and activity through HIF-1α and LXRα/ABCA1-regulated lipid raft reorganization, leading to Aβ production and apoptosis of SK-N-MC.
Paraquat (PQT), a redox-active herbicide, is a free radical-producing molecule, causing damage particularly to the nervous system; thus, it is employed as an animal model for Parkinson's disease. However, its impact on peripheral nerve demyelination is still unknown. Our aim is to decipher the influence of PQT-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) production on peripheral myelin.
We report that PQT provokes severe locomotor and sensory defects in mice. PQT elicited an oxidative stress in the nerve, resulting in an increase of lipid peroxidation and protein carbonylation, despite the induction of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2)-dependent antioxidant defenses. We observed a dramatic disorganization of myelin sheaths in the sciatic nerves, dysregulation of myelin gene expression, and aggregation of myelin proteins, a hallmark of demyelination. PQT altered myelin gene expression via liver X receptor (LXR) signaling, a negative regulator of peripheral myelin gene expression through its dialog with the Wnt/β-catenin pathway. PQT prevented β-catenin binding on myelin gene promoters, resulting in the inhibition of Wnt/β-catenin-dependent myelin gene expression. Wnt pathway activation by LiCl dampened the deleterious effects of PQT. LiCl blocked PQT-induced oxidative stress and reduced Schwann cell death. LiCl+PQT-treated mice had normal sensorimotor behaviors and a usual nerve structure.
We reveal that PQT damages the sciatic nerve by generating an oxidative stress, dysregulating LXR and Wnt/β-catenin pathways. The activation of Wnt signaling by LiCl reduced the deleterious effects of PQT on the nerve.
We demonstrate that PQT instigates peripheral nerve demyelinating neuropathies by enhancing ROS production and deregulating LXR and Wnt pathways. Stimulating Wnt pathway could be a therapeutic strategy for neuropathy treatment. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 27, 168-183.
Liver X receptors (LXRs) are ligand-activated nuclear receptors involved mainly in the regulation of cholesterol metabolism in many organs, including liver and intestine, as well as in macrophages and neutrophils. Besides, both anti-inflammatory and pro-inflammatory properties have been ascribed to LXRs. The effect of the inflammatory condition on the expression of LXRα and its target genes has not been previously addressed in human neutrophils. We have described that platelet-activating factor (PAF) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) are potent pro-inflammatory mediators that link the haemostatic and innate immune systems. In this work we report that H2O2 at low doses (1 pM-1μM) exerts an inhibitory effect on TO901317-induced mRNA expression of LXRα and of its target genes encoding the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters ABCA1 and ABCG1, and the sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1c (SREBP1c). However, an opposite behaviour, i.e., a transcription-enhancing effect, was found at higher H2O2 doses (100-500μM) on most of these genes. A similar dual effect was observed when the pro-inflammatory molecule PAF was used. Interestingly, H2O2 production separately elicited by 10nM PAF or 1μM H2O2 was similarly low, and analogously, H2O2 production levels elicited by 5μM PAF or 100μM H2O2 were similarly high when they were compared. On the other hand, low doses of PAF or H2O2 induced phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK 1/2) and NF-κB activation, However, PAF or H2O2 at high doses did not produce changes in NF-κB activation levels. In summary, our results show that H2O2, either exogenous or PAF-induced, exerts a dual regulation on mRNA expression of LXRα and its target genes. 
The intracellular concentration of the mitogen phosphatidic acid (PA) must be maintained at low levels until the need arises for cell proliferation. How temporal and spatial trafficking of PA affects its target proteins in the different cellular compartments is not fully understood. We report that in cancer cells, PA cycles back and forth from the cellular membrane to the nucleus, affecting the function of epidermal growth factor (EGF), in a process that involves PPARα/LXRα signaling. Upon binding to its ligand, EGF receptor (EGFR)-initiated activation of phospholipase D (PLD) causes a spike in intracellular PA production that forms vesicles transporting EGFR from early endosomes (EEA1 marker) and prolonged internalization in late endosomes and Golgi (RCAS marker). Cells incubated with fluorescent-labeled PA (NBD-PA) show PA in "diffuse" locations throughout the cytoplasm, punctae (small, &lt;0.1 μm) vesicles) and large (&gt;0.5 μm) vesicles that co-localize with EGFR. We also report that PPARα/LXRα form heterodimers that bind to new Responsive Elements (RE) in the EGFR promoter. Nuclear PA enhances EGFR expression, a role compatible with the mitogenic ability of the phospholipid. Newly made EGFR is packaged into PA recycling vesicles (Rab11 marker) and transported back to the cytoplasm and plasma membrane. However, a PLD+PA combination impedes binding of PPARα/LXRα to the EGFR promoter. Thus, if PA levels inside the nucleus reach a certain threshold (&gt;100 nM) PA outcompetes the nuclear receptors and transcription is inhibited. This new signaling function of PLD-PA targeting EGFR trafficking and biphasically modulating its transcription, could explain cell proliferation initiation and its maintenance in cancer cells.
Stearoyl-coenzyme A desaturase 1 (SCD1) is a pivotal enzyme in the biosynthesis of monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA). It is tightly regulated by transcription factors that control lipogenesis. In nonruminants, liver X receptor α (LXRα) is a nuclear receptor and transcription factor that acts as a key sensor of cholesterol and lipid homeostasis. However, the mechanism whereby LXRα regulates the expression and transcriptional activity of SCD1 in ruminant mammary cells remains unknown. In this study with goat mammary epithelial cells (GMEC), the LXRα agonist T 4506585 (T09) markedly enhanced the mRNA expression of SCD1 and sterol regulatory element binding factor 1 (SREBF1). The concentrations of C16:1 and C18:1 and their desaturation indices also were increased by LXRα activation. However, knockdown of LXRα did not alter the mRNA expression of SCD1. Although SCD1 was repressed by SREBF1 knockdown, T09 significantly increased SCD1 expression. Further analysis revealed that the SCD1 promoter activity was activated by LXRα overexpression. The goat SCD1 promoter contains 2 LXR response elements (LXRE), 1 sterol response element (SRE), and 1 nuclear factor Y (NF-Y) binding site. Site-directed mutagenesis of LXRE1, LXRE2, or SRE alone did not eliminate the upregulation of SCD1 when LXRα was overexpressed. In contrast, when NF-Y alone or in combination with SRE was mutated simultaneously, the basal transcriptional activity of the SCD1 promoter was markedly decreased and did not respond to LXRα overexpression. Furthermore, when SREBF1 was knocked down, overexpression of LXRα did not affect the promoter activity of SCD1. Together, these data suggest that LXRα regulates the expression of SCD1 through increasing SREBP-1 abundance to promote interaction with SRE and NF-Y binding sites. The present study provides evidence that LXRα is involved in the synthesis of MUFA in the goat mammary gland through an indirect mechanism. 
The Constitutive Androstane Receptor (CAR, NR1I3) has been newly described as a regulator of energy metabolism. A relevant number of studies using animal models of obesity suggest that CAR activation could be beneficial on the metabolic balance. However, this remains controversial and the underlying mechanisms are still unknown. This work aimed to investigate the effect of CAR activation on hepatic energy metabolism during physiological conditions, i.e. in mouse models not subjected to metabolic/nutritional stress. Gene expression profiling in the liver of CAR knockout and control mice on chow diet and treated with a CAR agonist highlighted CAR-mediated up-regulations of lipogenic genes, concomitant with neutral lipid accumulation. A strong CAR-mediated up-regulation of the patatin-like phospholipase domain-containing protein 3 (Pnpla3) was demonstrated. Pnpla3 is a gene whose polymorphism is associated with the pathogenesis of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) development. This observation was confirmed in human hepatocytes treated with the antiepileptic drug and CAR activator, phenobarbital and in immortalized human hepatocytes treated with CITCO. Studying the molecular mechanisms controlling Pnpla3 gene expression, we demonstrated that CAR does not act by a direct regulation of Pnpla3 transcription or via the Liver X Receptor but may rather involve the transcription factor Carbohydrate Responsive Element-binding protein. These data provide new insights into the regulation by CAR of glycolytic and lipogenic genes and on pathogenesis of steatosis. This also raises the question concerning the impact of drugs and environmental contaminants in lipid-associated metabolic diseases.
Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) induces a series of inflammatory processes that contribute to neuronal damage and neurological deterioration. Liver X receptors (LXRs) are nuclear receptors that negatively regulate transcriptional processes involved in inflammatory responses, but their role in the pathology following ICH remains unclear. The present study investigated the neuroprotective effects and anti-inflammatory actions of TO901317, a synthetic LXR agonist, in a model of collagenase-induced ICH and in microglial cultures.
Mice subjected to collagenase-induced ICH injury were injected with either TO901317 (30 mg/kg) or vehicle 10 min after ICH and subsequently daily for 2 days. Behavioral studies, histology analysis, and assessments of hematoma volumes, brain water content, and blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability were performed. The protein expression of LXR-α, LXR-β, ATP binding cassette transporter-1 (ABCA-1), and inflammatory molecules was analyzed. The anti-inflammatory mechanism of TO901317 was investigated in cultured microglia that were stimulated with either lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or thrombin.
ICH induced an increase in LXR-α protein levels in the hemorrhagic hemisphere at 6 h whereas LXR-β expression remained unaffected. Both LXR-α and LXR-β were expressed in neurons and microglia in the peri-ICH region and but rarely in astrocytes. TO901317 significantly attenuated functional deficits and brain damage up to 28 days post-ICH. TO901317 also reduced neuronal death, BBB disruption, and brain edema at day 4 post-ICH. These changes were associated with marked reductions in microglial activation, neutrophil infiltration, and expression levels of inflammatory mediators at 4 and 7 days. However, TO901317 had no effect on matrix metalloproteinase-9 activity. In BV2 microglial cultures, TO901317 attenuated LPS- and thrombin-stimulated nitric oxide production and reduced LPS-induced p38, JNK, MAPK, and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) signaling. Moreover, delaying administration of TO901317 to 3 h post-ICH reduced brain tissue damage and neuronal death.
Our results suggest that enhancing LXR activation may provide a potential therapy for ICH by modulating the cytotoxic functions of microglia.
To examine the expression of liver X receptor-β (LXR-β) in human gastric cancer tissue, and to explore the effect of GW3965, an agonist of LXRs, on proliferation of gastric cancer cell line SGC-7901. 
The immunohistochemical assay was used to detect the expression of LXR-β, activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4) in gastric cancer tissues and the corresponding pericarcinoma tissues in 114 patients. Real-time quantitative PCR and Western blot were used to determine mRNA and protein levels of ATF4 and ATP-binding cassette 1 (ABCA1), one of the downstream target genes of LXRs, in SGC-7901 cells with or without GW3965 treatment. Cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) assay was performed to detect cell proliferation. The expression of ATF4 was silenced by short hairpin RNA (shRNA). 
The expressions of LXR-β and ATF-4 were obviously down-regulated in the gastric cancer tissues than that in the corresponding pericarcinoma tissues (both P&lt;0.05). Compared with the control cells, GW3965 treatment inhibited proliferation of SGC-7901 cells and up-regulated ATF4 and ABCA1 expressions (both P&lt;0.05). Knockdown of ATF4 can reverse the antiproliferative effect of GW3965 on SGC-7901 cells. 
The expression of LXR-β is decreased in human gastric cancer tissues, and activation of LXRs by GW3965 could inhibit the proliferation of SGC-7901 cells via ATF4.
目的：探讨肝X受体-β(liver X receptor-β，LXR-β)在胃癌组织中的表达及其激动剂GW3965对胃癌细胞SGC-7901增殖的影响。方法：应用免疫组织化学法检测114例胃癌及其对应的114例癌旁组织中增殖相关基因LXR-β和转录活化因子4(activating transcription factor 4，ATF4)的表达；培养胃癌细胞SGC-7901，待GW3965激活LXR-β后，应用qRT-PCR和Western印迹检测LXR-β下游基因三磷酸腺苷结合盒A1(ATP-binding cassette A1，ABCA1)和ATF4的表达，采用细胞增殖-毒性检测试剂盒检测细胞增殖情况；GW3965激活LXR-β后，利用ATF4短发夹RNA(short hairpin RNA，shRNA)靶向沉默ATF4，检测细胞增殖情况。结果：LXR-β和ATF4在胃癌组织中的表达均显著低于其相应的癌旁组织(均P&lt;0.05)；GW3965激活LXR-β后，SGC7901细胞增殖明显受抑制，ABCA1和ATF4的表达明显上调(均P&lt;0.05)；shRNA能显著抑制ATF4的表达，并阻断LXR-β激活后抑制细胞增殖的作用。结论：LXR-β在胃癌组织中呈低表达，活化的LXR-β可能通过ATF4抑制胃癌细胞的增殖。.
Two forms of estrogen receptor (ER) that exist in the mammalian uterus have been examined in this review. (1) ERalpha, or the classical estrogen receptor that is considered to influence the transcriptional process; (2) the non-activated estrogen receptor (naER), an alternative form of ER with no DNA binding function, localized in the plasma membrane. An integrated model is being proposed to highlight the functional roles of both receptors in transcriptional regulation. The proteins with which ER interacts during various stages of its existence are being examined. These stages include: (1) transport from the cytoplasm to the nucleus; (2) interaction with the nuclear transcription machinery; (3) involvement in post-transcriptional control mechanisms; and (4) degradation through ubiquitination. The proteins with which naER interacts during its plasma membrane-to-nucleus movement have also been identified; the results have not yet been published. Within the nucleus it dimerizes with a DNA-binding protein, the estrogen receptor activation factor (E-RAF). It is being proposed that the purpose behind the dimerization between naER and E-RAF is to transport E-RAF to the transcription initiation site as the naER in the heterodimer is a RNA-polymerase binding protein. Deglycosylated naER fails to dimerize with the E-RAF. Deglycosylation of the naER therefore dissociates the heterodimer and this transformed naER is now identified as nuclear estrogen receptor II (nER II). The dissociated E-RAF is free either to destabilize (E-RAF II) or stabilize (E-RAF I) the DNA while the naER remains bound to the RNA polymerase II. nER II phosphorylates certain subunits in RNA polymerase; the functional significance of this phosphorylation remains to be known.
Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFr) and cytosolic (cER) and nuclear (nER) estradiol receptors were quantified in 220 primary breast cancers. The EGFr was significantly more frequent (chi 2 = 5.9; P less than 0.025) and its concentration was significantly higher (P less than 0.001) among ER- tumors than in ER+ tumors. There was a significantly greater proportion (chi 2 = 6.4; P less than 0.05) of node involvement in EGFr+/ER+ tumors than in EFGr-/ER+. Increases in the proportion of EGFr+ in ER- tumors are parallel to Scarff-Bloom scores (chi 2 = 6.1; P less than 0.05) and there is a significant trend (Spearman rs = 0.25; P less than 0.05) towards increased EGFr concentrations with histologic dedifferentiation. In ER+ tumors the median concentrations of EGFr in the different age groups show a linear correlation (LCC = 0.89; P less than 0.05) and follow a parallel profile with the medians of nER. These findings support the hypothesis that EGFr is a bad prognosis factor and suggest that EGFr expression and concentration in ER+ tumors might be considered an estrogenic action mediated through the binding of ER to their nuclear acceptors.
Mutations in genes encoding the ERCC3 (XPB), ERCC2 (XPD), and GTF2H5 (p8 or TTD-A) subunits of the transcription and DNA-repair factor TFIIH lead to three autosomal-recessive disorders: xeroderma pigmentosum (XP), XP associated with Cockayne syndrome (XP/CS), and trichothiodystrophy (TTD). Although these diseases were originally associated with defects in DNA repair, transcription deficiencies might be also implicated. By using retinoic acid receptor beta isoform 2 (RARB2) as a model in several cells bearing mutations in genes encoding TFIIH subunits, we observed that (1) the recruitment of the TFIIH complex was altered at the activated RARB2 promoter, (2) TFIIH participated in the recruitment of nucleotide excision repair (NER) factors during transcription in a manner different from that observed during NER, and (3) the different TFIIH variants disturbed transcription by having distinct consequences on post-translational modifications of histones, DNA-break induction, DNA demethylation, and gene-loop formation. The transition from heterochromatin to euchromatin was disrupted depending on the variant, illustrating the fact that TFIIH, by contributing to NER factor recruitment, orchestrates chromatin remodeling. The subtle transcriptional differences found between various TFIIH variants thus participate in the phenotypic variability observed among XP, XP/CS, and TTD individuals. 
Mutations in the human XPG gene give rise to an inherited photosensitive disorder, xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) associated with Cockayne syndrome (XP-G/CS). The clinical features of CS in XP-G/CS patients are difficult to explain on the basis of a defect in nucleotide excision repair (NER). We found that XPG forms a stable complex with TFIIH, which is active in transcription and NER. Mutations in XPG found in XP-G/CS patient cells that prevent the association with TFIIH also resulted in the dissociation of CAK and XPD from the core TFIIH. As a consequence, the phosphorylation and transactivation of nuclear receptors were disturbed in XP-G/CS as well as xpg(-/-) MEF cells and could be restored by expression of wild-type XPG. These results provide an insight into the role of XPG in the stabilization of TFIIH and the regulation of gene expression and provide an explanation of some of the clinical features of XP-G/CS.
Polymorphisms in nucleotide excision repair (NER) pathway genes are associated with the risk of breast cancer, but the relevance of these associations appeared to vary according to the ethnicity of the subjects. To systemically evaluate the potential associations between NER polymorphisms and breast cancer risk in a Chinese population, we carried out a case-control study on 450 breast cancer patients and 430 healthy controls. Sequenom MassARRAY was used for genotyping, and immunohistochemistry was performed to detect estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER-2) expression in tumor tissue. Our results showed that ERCC1 rs11615 (additive model: ORadjusted: 1.36, 95% CI: 1.08-1.71, p = 0.009), XPC rs2228000 (additive model: ORadjusted: 1.39, 95% CI: 1.13-1.72, p = 0.002) and ERCC2/XPD rs50872 (additive model: ORadjusted: 1.32, 95% CI: 1.04-1.67, p = 0.021) were associated with an increased risk of breast cancer. Stratified analysis revealed three polymorphisms (rs11615, rs1800975, and rs50872) to be associated with breast cancer in menopausal females. Three polymorphisms were associated with specific breast cancer grades (rs11615 with grade 3, rs2228000 and rs50872 with grade 1-2). Two polymorphisms (rs2228001 and rs50872) were associated with the risk of breast cancer with negative lymph node involvement. rs1800975 and rs50872 were associated with the risk of ER- and PR- breast cancer, whereas rs11615 was associated with the risk of ER+ and PR+ breast cancer. We found that carriers of the T allele of ERCC1 rs11615, XPC rs2228000 and rs50872, particularly in postmenopausal females, have an increased risk of breast cancer.
Genotoxic agents produce numerous cellular responses that are principally dedicated to maintain or restore DNA integrity. In human cells, nucleotide excision repair (NER) is one of the major pathways for the repair of DNA damage such as ultraviolet (UV) radiation-induced lesions. Endocrine disrupting compounds are environmental contaminants that interfere with the function of the endocrine system. Among them, the natural estrogen 17beta-estradiol (E(2)) exhibits the most potent activity. Some proteins directly or indirectly involved in NER also fulfill other functions such as transcription, DNA damage checkpoints or cell cycle. Moreover, steroids such as E(2) are believed to interact with a large number of proteins including some involved in NER and DNA damage checkpoint control. We therefore investigated the potential modulation of genotoxic stress-cells responses by E(2) treatment. Estrogen receptor (ER)-positive human breast cancer cells were submitted to E(2) before and/or after UVB irradiation and thereafter the repair kinetics of UV-induced DNA damage were evaluated. We report here that the repair rate of UVB-induced DNA damage is enhanced when cells are submitted to an estrogenic stimulation. Moreover, our results suggest that this response could be mediated by cell cycle regulatory proteins in a p53-independent manner.
The localization and abundance of the estrogen receptor activation factor (E-RAF) and a small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) complex containing three proteins, p32, p55 and p60, which interact with the nuclear estrogen receptor II (nER II), have been studied in rat endometrial epithelial cells by means of immunofluorescence and high resolution quantitative immunocytochemistry. In the cytoplasm E-RAF is associated with the rough endoplasmic reticulum. In the nucleus it is mainly localized at the interchromatin space, and surrounding the clumps of compact or semi-condensed chromatin. Quantitative analyses show that the abundance of E-RAF in the nucleus increases after ovariectomy and decreases 3 minutes after estradiol administration. These results are in agreement with the currently available biochemical data. Double immunolocalizations demonstrate that p32, p55, p60 co-localize with other splicing-related protein. High resolution immunolocalization shows that p32, p55, p60 are associated with perichromatin fibrils (co-transcriptional splicing) and with clusters of interchromatin granules (storage of splicing-related molecules). The nuclear abundance of the snRNP complex decreases with ovariectomy, increases within 3 minutes after estradiol administration and remains higher than that in ovariectomized animals for 27 minutes. These results strongly support the previous data on the role of nER-II in the regulation of mRNA transcription and its export from the nucleus to the cytoplasm.
Bonus, a Drosophila TIF1 homolog, is a nuclear receptor cofactor required for viability, molting, and numerous morphological events. Here we establish a role for Bonus in the modulation of chromatin structure. We show that weak loss-of-function alleles of bonus have a more deleterious effect on males than on females. This male-enhanced lethality is not due to a defect in dosage compensation or somatic sex differentiation, but to the presence of the Y chromosome. Additionally, we show that bonus acts as both an enhancer and a suppressor of position-effect variegation. By immunostaining, we demonstrate that Bonus is associated with both interphase and prophase chromosomes and through chromatin immunoprecipitation show that two of these sites correspond to the histone gene cluster and the Stellate locus.
There is a wealth of information regarding the import and export of nuclear proteins in general. Nevertheless, the available data that deals with the nucleocytoplasmic movement of steroid hormone receptors remains highly limited. Some research findings reported during the past five years have succeeded in identifying proteins related to the movement of estrogen receptor alpha from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. What is striking in these findings is the facilitatory role of estradiol in the transport process. A similar conclusion has been drawn from the studies on the plasma membrane-to nucleus movement of the alternative form of estrogen receptor, the non-activated estrogen receptor (naER). The internalization of naER from the plasma membrane takes place only in the presence of estradiol. While the gene regulatory functions of ER alpha appear to get terminated following its ubiquitinization within the nucleus, the naER, through its deglycosylated form, the nuclear estrogen receptor II (nER II) continues to remain functional even beyond its existence within the nucleus. Recent studies have indicated the possibility that the estrogen receptor that regulates the nucleo cytoplasmic transport of m RNP is the nERII. This appears to be the result of the interaction between nERII and three proteins belonging to a group of small nuclear ribonucleo proteins (snRNP). The interaction of nERII with two of this protein appears to activate the inherent Mg2+ ATPase activity of the complex, which leads to the exit of the RNP through the nuclear pore complex.
To counteract the deleterious effects of genotoxic injury, cells have set up a sophisticated network of DNA repair pathways. We show that Gal4-VP16 and RAR transcriptional activators stimulate nucleotide excision repair (NER). This DNA repair activation is not coupled to transcription since it occurs in Cockayne syndrome cells (which are transcription-coupled repair deficient) and is observed in vitro in the presence of alpha-amanitin and in the absence of the basal transcription factors. Using a reconstituted dual incision assay, we also show that binding of activators to their cognate sequences induces a local chromatin remodeling mediated by ATP-driven chromatin remodeling and acetyltransferase activities to facilitate DNA repair.
UV light targets both membrane receptors and nuclear DNA, thus evoking signals triggering apoptosis. Although receptor-mediated apoptosis has been extensively investigated, the role of DNA damage in apoptosis is less clear. To analyze the importance of DNA damage induced by UV-C light in apoptosis, we compared nucleotide excision repair (NER)-deficient Chinese hamster ovary cells (lines 27-1 and 43-3B mutated for the repair genes ERCC3 and ERCC1, respectively) with the corresponding DNA repair-proficient fibroblasts (CHO-9 and ERCC1 complemented 43-3B cells). NER-deficient cells were hypersensitive as to the induction of apoptosis, indicating that apoptosis induced by UV-C light is due to unrepaired DNA base damage. Unrepaired lesions, however, do not activate the apoptotic pathway directly because apoptosis upon UV-C irradiation requires DNA replication and cell proliferation. It is also shown that in NER-deficient cells unrepaired lesions are converted into DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) and chromosomal aberrations by a replication-dependent process that precedes apoptosis. We therefore propose that DSBs arising from replication of DNA containing nonrepaired lesions act as an ultimate trigger of UV-C-induced apoptosis. Induction of apoptosis by UV-C light was related to decline in the expression level of Bcl-2 and activation of caspases. Decline of Bcl-2 and subsequent apoptosis might also be caused, at least in part, by UV-C-induced blockage of transcription, which was more pronounced in NER-deficient than in wild-type cells. This is in line with experiments with actinomycin D, which provoked Bcl-2 decline and apoptosis. UV-C-induced apoptosis due to nonrepaired DNA lesions, replication-dependent formation of DSBs, and activation of the mitochondrial damage pathway is independent of functional p53 for which the cells are mutated.
Three proteins of a goat uterine small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) fraction, which bind to nuclear estrogen receptor-II (nER-II) have been isolated and purified. These are the p32, p55, and p60 of which p32 is the major nER-II binding protein. Indirect evidence reveals that p32 binds to the nuclear export signal (NES) on the nER-II. nER-II is a snRNA binding protein while p32 does not bind to the RNA. nER-II along with p32 and p55 form an effective Mg(++)ATPase complex, the activation of which appears to be the immediate reason behind the RNP exit from the nuclei following estradiol exposure. The three nER-II binding proteins bind to the nuclear pore complex; nER-II does not possess this property.
Exposure of goat uterine nuclei to estradiol in vitro results in an immediate exit of ribonucleoproteins (RNP) from the nuclei to the medium. This RNP exit appears to be mediated by an estrogen receptor localized in small nuclear ribonucleoproteins containing U1 and U2 snRNA. Available evidence indicates that the estrogen receptor involved is not the ERalpha, but an alternative form, which is also a 66 kDa protein. This is the nuclear estrogen receptor II (nER-II) that has no DNA-binding capacity. The transport is estrogen-specific since non-estrogenic steroids do not stimulate the transport of the RNP where the receptor is localized.
A 62-kDa nuclear protein that transforms the goat uterine nonactivated estrogen receptor (naER) to nuclear estrogen receptor II (nER II) has been isolated and purified. This is being identified as the naER-transforming factor (naER-TF). The transformation is achieved through deglycosylation of the naER. It is observed that the naER-TF action on the naER introduces significant changes in the structural and functional features of the naER. The capacity of the naER to bind estradiol increases 8- to 10-fold, while its hormone binding affinity reduces to a considerable extent following its exposure to naER TF. There is a critical ratio in the concentration of the two proteins, the TF and the naER, that would ensure an optimum transformation process. The transformed naER is incapable of dimerization with the estrogen receptor activation factor (E-RAF).
Early studies have suggested the presence in the central nervous system of possible estrogen binding sites/proteins other than classical nuclear estrogen receptors (nER). We report here the isolation and identification of a 23 kDa membrane protein from digitonin-solubilized rat brain mitochondrial fractions that binds 17beta-estradiol conjugated to bovine serum albumin at C-6 position (17beta-E-6-BSA), a ligand that also specifically binds nER. This protein was partially purified using affinity columns coupled with 17beta-E-6-BSA and was recognized by the iodinated 17beta-E-6-BSA (17beta-E-6-[125I]BSA) in a ligand blotting assay. The binding of 17beta-E-6-BSA to this protein was specific for the 17beta-estradiol portion of the conjugate, not BSA. Using N-terminal sequencing and immunoblotting, this 23 kDa protein was identified as the oligomycin-sensitivity conferring protein (OSCP). This protein is a subunit of the FOF1 (F-type) mitochondrial ATP synthase/ATPase required for the coupling of a proton gradient across the F0 sector of the enzyme in the mitochondrial membrane to ATP synthesis in the F1 sector of the enzyme. Studies using recombinant bovine OSCP (rbOSCP) in ligand blotting revealed that rbOSCP bound 17beta-E-6-[125I]BSA with the same specificity as the purified 23 kDa protein. Further, in a ligand binding assay, 17beta-E-6-[125I]BSA also bound rbOSCP and it was displaced by both 17beta-E-6-BSA and 17alpha-E-6-BSA as well as partially by 17beta-estradiol and diethylstilbestrol (DES), but not by BSA. This finding opens up the possibility that estradiol, and probably other compounds with similar structures, in addition to their classical genomic mechanism, may interact with ATP synthase/ATPase by binding to OSCP, and thereby modulating cellular energy metabolism. Current experiments are addressing such an issue.
Meiotic recombination and DNA repair are mediated by overlapping sets of genes. In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, many genes required to repair DNA double-strand breaks are also required for meiotic recombination. In contrast, mutations in genes required for nucleotide excision repair (NER) have no detectable effects on meiotic recombination in S. cerevisiae. The Drosophila melanogaster mei-9 gene is unique among known recombination genes in that it is required for both meiotic recombination and NER. We have analyzed the mei-9 gene at the molecular level and found that it encodes a homologue of the S. cerevisiae excision repair protein Rad1, the probable homologue of mammalian XPF/ERCC4. Hence, the predominant process of meiotic recombination in Drosophila proceeds through a pathway that is at least partially distinct from that of S. cerevisiae, in that it requires an NER protein. The biochemical properties of the Rad1 protein allow us to explain the observation that mei-9 mutants suppress reciprocal exchange without suppressing the frequency of gene conversion.
Serial changes in the endometrial levels of estrogen and progesterone receptors (ER and PR) were measured in 50 women from days 2 to 14 of missed menses and correlated with the plasma concentrations of hCG, progesterone and 17 beta-estradiol. Both ER and PR of nuclei were higher than cytosolic proteins, with a shift in the ratio of nER/nPR to nPR from 4th day after missed menses. On Scatchard analysis of the cytosolic and nuclear binding proteins, two classes of proteins, corresponding to Type I and II, were found. While the increasing levels of hCG maintained luteal secretion of progesterone and 17 beta-estradiol at normal mid-luteal phase levels, a gradual increase in 17 beta estradiol from 9th day of missed menses was noted. This delicate balance between circulating levels of progesterone and 17 beta-estradiol and their nuclear receptors at early stages of pregnancy may be of significance.
Estrogen receptor (ER) levels were evaluated in thyroid tumors induced by N-methyl-N-nitrosourea (MNU) and low iodine diet (LID) or propylthiouracil (PTU) in intact and estrogen (E2) loaded Long-Evans (LE) rats. MNU at 40 mg/kg body wt was injected in 50 day-old LE rats of both sexes. The animals were killed 17-22 weeks later and the thyroid tissues were subjected to ER assay. In LID-treated groups, cytosolic ER (cER) levels were 6.7 +/- 5.8 (fmol/mg protein, mean +/- SE) in females and 0.7 +/- 1.4 in males, E2 increased the ER levels. In E2-loaded LID groups, cER levels were 12.9 +/- 3.7 in females and 1.7 +/- 1.7 in males. PTU treatment produced almost comparable ER levels as LID treatment. PTU treatment as well as LID treatment increased the serum TSH levels with E2 treatment producing additional elevation. In evaluating ER levels by histological type of thyroid tumors, the level in cER plus nER showed the lowest value of 6 +/- 6.4 (fmol/mg DNA, mean +/- SE) in hyperplasia, followed by 129 +/- 52.3 in adenoma and 289 +/- 51.7 in carcinoma. The rates of BrdU incorporation in thyroid follicles indicated higher proliferation activity in the area of adenoma and carcinoma rather than in the hyperplastic area. These data suggested that E2 treatment increases the ER levels in MNU and LID/PTU-induced thyroid tumors. The level of ER was correlated to the histological type of thyroid tumors.
Alterations of estrogen-inducible hepatic proteins and estrogen receptor proteins were studied in female rats after daily oral administration of vehicle control (0.5% carboxymethylcellulose), the nonsteroidal antiestrogens tamoxifen (TAM; 3, 11, or 45 mg/kg body weight), toremifene (TOR; 3, 12, or 48 mg/kg body weight), or the potent synthetic estrogen diethylstilbestrol (DES; 10 mg/kg body weight) for 1 and 3 months. Serum corticosterone levels were significantly reduced by TAM 11, TOR 12, and DES at 1 month and by TOR 48 and DES at 3 months. Serum ceruloplasmin levels were unchanged at 1 month except for a significant reduction with TOR 48 and a significant increase in the DES-treated group. After 3 months, all doses of TAM and TOR had significant reductions whereas DES had elevations even greater than those at 1 month. The activity of the enzyme alanine aminotransferase in the liver was increased by TAM, TOR, and DES at 1 and 3 months of treatment. Both TAM and TOR caused a slight reduction in cytosolic estrogen receptor protein after 1 month and significant reductions at 3 months. The nuclear estrogen receptor (nER) protein levels were significantly increased at 1 and 3 months for TAM and TOR; whereas DES treatment resulted in nER levels no different than controls. In summary, chronic (up to 3 months) administration of TAM and TOR results in qualitatively and quantitatively similar hormone-related effects on the female rat liver. Thus, other mechanisms must be investigated to ascertain the hepatoproliferative differences seen with TAM administration but not with TOR.
We previously reported that supplementary dietary wheat bran significantly reduced the incidence of N-nitrosomethylurea (NMU) induced mammary tumors in rats fed a high fat (HF) diet and reduced to a lesser extent the incidence in rats fed a low fat (LF) diet compared to their unsupplemented controls. Using the same cohort of experimental animals, we here report the results of biochemical analyses designed to investigate the effect of supplemental dietary fiber on estrogen metabolism and lipid excretion. Serum, hepatic tissue, urine, and feces were obtained from rats which had been fed a HF (23.5% corn oil) diet, a HF plus fiber (HF + F, 10% soft white wheat bran, SWWB) diet, a LF (5.0% corn oil) diet, or a LF plus fiber (LF + F) diet for 15 weeks beginning 3 days after a single dose of NMU. Our working hypotheses to explain how dietary fiber protects against mammary tumorigenesis were that fiber may: 1) act as an antiestrogen; 2) decrease circulating estrogens; 3) alter the enterohepatic recirculation of estrogens; and 4) physically bind to lipid and remove it in the feces. Therefore, various indices of estrogen metabolism were assessed including: 1) circulating estradiol (E2) and progesterone; 2) hepatic estrogen receptor (ER) protein; 3) excretion of estrogen in the urine and feces; 4) the in vitro estrogen binding properties of SWWB; 5) fecal lipid content; and 6) the in vitro lipid binding capacity of SWWB. Serum 17 beta-estradiol and progesterone remained unchanged as did hepatic cytosolic (cER) and nuclear (nER) estrogen receptor protein content, in the fiber supplemented groups compared to their respective controls.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
The quantitative biochemical analysis of tissue specimens from 76 human breast carcinomas consisted of examination for cytosolic estrogen receptors (cER), nuclear estrogen receptors (nER), progesterone receptors (PgR), 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol receptors (DR), carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), alpha-lactalbumin (aLA), and gamma-glutamyl transferase (gGT). The highest incidence was found in CEA (76%), DR (70%), and aLA (62%). There was a high percentage of tumors containing only DR, in contrast to the tumors containing only cER or PgR. The simultaneous occurrence of DR and CEA was considerably high (61%). No statistically significant differences were observed in these biochemical parameters in relation to the grade of differentiation of the tumors. The values of aLA in tumors that invaded lymphatic or blood vessels were lower as compared to those tumors that invaded adipose or connective tissues. The level of statistical significance of this difference was close to 5%, the differences in other parameters were statistically insignificant. For prognosis assessed at the time of surgery, after a 2-3-year follow-up of 36 patients the level of gGT in the tumor seems to be the most promising prognostic factor. The values of gGT were significantly lower in those patients whose tumors were in progression during this time. The significance of nER and aLA was also taken into consideration.
The levels of oxytocin receptor (OTR), cytosolic progestin receptor (cPR), cytosolic and nuclear estrogen receptor (cER, nER) were measured in the endometrium of 28 heifers that had been slaughtered on a defined day of the estrous cycle. In an additional, trial endometrial tissue obtained from 78 heifers or cows at the abattoir was analysed for OTR. OTR was absent during the luteal phase (after day 6), but a minor elevation was observed after day 15. OTR increased rapidly after luteolysis on days 17-18 reaching a maximum during estrous on day 21, and decreased again during days 1-6. cER and cPR were different to OTR but followed a similar pattern with maximal levels during days 1-8 of the estrous cycle. At day 12 both receptors were minimal and increased again towards day 21. nER was maximal at day 19-21 coinciding with maximal estradiol levels and estrous. Our data indicate that owing to an increasing sensitivity of the endometrium to progesterone and estradiol after day 12, these steroids may be mainly responsible for the initiation of first PGF2 alpha surges and luteolysis. Oxytocin seems to be of minor importance at this stage owing to low sensitivity of the endometrium for oxytocin.
Normal endometrial cells and endometrial adenocarcinoma cells were doubly stained with 1-(N)-fluoresceinyl estrone thiosemicarbazone (17-FE) and propidium iodide and the contents of estrogen receptor (ER) and nucleic acids in a single cell were measured by flow cytometry to clarify the changes in ER levels in the cell cycle. In HHUA cells, established from a well differentiated endometrial adenocarcinoma, used as the ER positive tumor model, the cytoplasmic ER (cER) level increased 1.40 times in the S phase and nuclear ER (nER) level increased 1.65 times in the G2/M phase compared with the levels in the G1 phase. In normal endometrial cells, nER content gradually increased from the early proliferative phase to the ovulatory phase with 2.86 +/- 1.12 times higher levels in the G2/M phase than those in the G0G1 phase and remained high until the mid-secretory phase. Human endometrial adenocarcinoma could be classified into 3 types based on nER levels in G1 and G2/M phases; 1) adenocarcinoma with nER accumulation in G2/M phase as in normal proliferative endometrial cells, 2) adenocarcinoma with nER but with failure of nER accumulation in G2/M phase, suggesting acceptor deficiency, and 3) adenocarcinoma with no nER, suggesting a lack of cER and/or acceptor. These results suggest that cell cycle specific nuclear accumulation of ER, especially in the G2/M phase, is principally related to estrogen dependent proliferation of normal and neoplastic cells.
Follow-up studies on 466 patients over a 5-year period showed Whites to have an overall significantly longer disease-free interval and survival than Blacks and Asians. No racial differences in prognosis were seen in patients with Stage II disease (p greater than 0.2) but in Stage III, White patients had significantly longer disease-free periods than Blacks or Asians; the same was not true of survival. Whites had a 67% incidence of cytoplasmic estrogen receptor (CER) positive tumors compared with only 49% in Blacks and 41% in Asians. When tumors were assayed for CER, nuclear estrogen receptor (NER), and cytoplasmic progesterone receptor (CPR), there were no racial differences in the proportions of tumors containing all 3 receptors, but significant variations were found in neoplasms with no receptors and in those with apparently defective receptors. In White patients receptor status had no influence on prognosis (p greater than 0.3). Black patients whose tumors contained both CER and NER had a significantly better time to recurrence than those whose tumors lacked these receptors, while in Asian women the presence of CER alone, or CER together with NER, or CER, NER, and CPR, was indicative of a significantly longer disease-free period.
These experiments examined the effects of a high and a low dose of estradiol benzoate (EB) in enhancing lordosis behavior and correlated these effects with the retention of hypothalamic nuclear estrogen receptors (NER) in female hamsters. Ten micrograms EB was significantly more effective in facilitating sexual receptivity in hamsters when it was followed 36 or 48 hr later by 0.5 mg progesterone (P), but not when P was given 24 hr after EB. Low levels of behavioral responses were observed in animals that received P at 24, 36 or 48 hr after 2 micrograms EB. Correspondingly, although the hypothalamic NER levels were equally elevated 24 hr after either a low or a high dose of EB, these receptor concentrations remained high at 36 and 48 hr post EB, only in those animals that received the high estrogen dose. The results of these experiments suggest that the long-term retention of NERs (which is maintained by a single high EB dose) may play an important role in the enhancement of sexual receptivity in hamsters.
A sex difference in the LH rise after gonadectomy is clearly observable in the rat. While male rats respond with an early (10-12 h) increase in LH after orchidectomy, a delayed response (2-3 days) is recorded after ovariectomy. In this study we tested the hypothesis that the delayed response to gonadectomy in the E2-treated males is due to a more prolonged retention of E2 (when compared with the corresponding male feedback signal, testosterone) within specific central nuclear receptor sites. Orchidectomized (ORDX) animals implanted with either empty or E2-filled Silastic capsules were sacrificed at 0, 24, 48 and 72 h after ORDX or E2-capsule removal. LH levels in ORDX rats rose several-fold by 24 h, whereas E2-treated, ORDX rats, showed no changes in peripheral LH levels until 72 h after E2-capsule removal. At the time of E2-capsule removal (0 h) large increases in nuclear estradiol receptor (NER) levels were seen in anterior pituitary, preoptic area, and hypothalamus (HYP). Twenty-four hours after E2-capsule removal, NER levels were still high in the 3 areas, and by 48 h NER values had returned to control (ORDX) levels, with the exception of HYP where they were slightly but significantly elevated. The increase in NER, as well as the subsequent decline after E2-capsule removal was paralleled by similar changes in cytosolic progestin receptor (CPR) levels in all three regions. Cytosolic testosterone levels were not changed by the E2-treatment. The results indicate that the feminized response to orchidectomy observed in E2-implanted males is related to a prolonged retention of the E2-receptor in nuclear sites. Further, they indicate that E2-treatment in males, as is the case in females, can induce a marked increase in progestin receptor levels within specific brain regions as well as in the pituitary. The reduction in NER and CPR levels to castrate values precedes the first detectable increase in peripheral LH levels. In conclusion, the pattern of LH rise after gonadectomy in the rat is dependent upon the steroidal milieu at the time of removal of the gonads.
In order to examine the cellular mechanisms by which estradiol (E2) exerts its acute negative feedback upon luteinizing hormone (LH) secretion, a temporal correlation was made among serum LH concentrations, pituitary responsiveness to luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH), and the translocation of E2 to nuclear (NER) receptors of the pituitary (PIT), preoptic hypothalamic area (POA), and the caudal hypothalamic area (HYP). Rats on diestrous day 1 were ovariectomized (OVX) and killed 10 days later. LH and LHRH were measured by RIA. NER was measured by an exchange assay. Serum LH increased 10-12-fold 10 days following OVX as compared to diestrous controls. The injection of estradiol benzoate (Eb, 20 microgram in corn oil/rat, sc) did not affect LH concentrations at 30 min but decreased serum LH at both 60 and 180 min following its administration. Pituitary responsiveness to LHRH (measured as the increase in LH 10 min after iv injections of 100 ng LHRH/rat) was not altered at 60 min but was significantly decreased 180 min following Eb injection. Thus, serum LH decreased prior to a detectable alteration in pituitary responsiveness to LHRH. Translocation of E2 receptors to NER of the HYP and PIT began 60 min following Eb injection and was maximal at 180 min. In contrast, translocation of E2 receptors in the POA was maximal at 60 min, and had recovered to control values 180 min following Eb administration.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
Cytoplasmic estrogen receptor (CER) activation and nuclear estrogen receptor (NER) forms have been examined in normal virgin and lactating mammary gland by 1) measuring [3H]estradiol-receptor dissociation kinetics, and by 2) sucrose density gradient analysis of sedimentation behavior on high salt gradients. The data show two forms of CER in both virgin and lactating mammary gland: 1) a fast dissociating-nonactivated form which sediments at 4 S, and 2) a slow dissociating-activated form which sediments at 5 S. The 5 S slow dissociating estrogen receptor (ER) is the predominant form found in the nucleus. CER are activated by exposure to elevated temperature, high salt concentration, dilution, or ammonium sulfate fractionation. This is demonstrated by an increase in the proportion of the slow dissociating, 5 S ER form. Sodium molybdate inhibits activation and prevents heat- or ammonium sulfate-induced increase in the amount of the slow-dissociating CER as well as the 4 S to 5 S increase in sedimentation coefficient. We also found that cytoplasmic and nuclear 5 S ER forms were susceptible to 1) cold-induced dissociation, and to 2) degradation by nuclear protease activity. Thus, whereas mammary gland CER activation and NER forms described herein are very similar to those reported for other estrogen target tissues, the experimental conditions required to demonstrate the activated-nuclear form of ER differ substantially from those reported for uterine tissue. These findings may be important for assessing differences in ER forms in certain disease states such as mammary neoplasia. Previously we have shown that lactating mammary gland, in contrast to virgin mammary gland, is not responsive to estrogen. Having compared CER and NER forms and receptor activation in virgin vs. lactating mammary gland, we find no differences between ER in these two tissue states that can explain the absence of responsiveness to estrogen during lactation.
Nuclear estradiol receptors (NER) were measured in human breast carcinomas by extracting nuclei with 0.6 mol/l KCl and adsorption to hydroxylapatite. NER were found in 34/58 tumors containing cytoplasmic estradiol receptors (CER) and in only 8/34 tumours without CER. NER correlated with CER but not with cytosol total estrogens or progesterone. NER levels also showed no significant correlation with either tumor stage, grade, cellularity, size, or presence or absence of axillary node metastases.
Methods for the measurement of cytoplasmic and nuclear oestrogen receptors (CER and NER) are described. CERs and NERs were found to be labile at ambient temperatures; the receptors are stable for up to 1 year when stored in liquid nitrogen. Over a period of 5 years, 51% of the breast adenocarcinomas examined in women proved to be positive for CER; four adenocarcinomas of the breast obtained from men were all positive for CER; in those tumours examined for both CER and NER, 46% proved positive for CER and 30% positive for NER; no tumour was found to be positive for NER and negative for CER. In older female patients, the percentage of patients positive for oestrogen receptors increased and they were present in higher concentrations; in younger Indian women the same tendency was observed. The percentages of receptor-positive tumours in Indians, Blacks and Whites are similar. Neither the stage of the tumour nor the presence of nodal metastases influenced receptor positivity; there was no significant difference in the time to recurrence between receptor-positive and receptor-negative patients in the small number with reliable follow-up data.
The aim of our research was the usability of immunoenzymatic assay for the determination of estrogen and progesterone receptors. We tested 59 women with breast tumours. 20 of these women have had carcinoma ductal, 10 carcinoma lobular and 3 women another histopathological type. 26 women have had benign tumours: 15 mastopathia fibrosocystica, 11 fibroadenoma. It was found that mean concentration of cER, nER and cPgR, nPgR were higher in malignant tumours as compared with benign tumours. Mean concentration of cER in carcinoma ductale (mean = 45.96 fmol/mg protein) and carcinoma lobular (mean = 130.38 fmol/mg protein) were of higher statistical significance than the levels of these receptors in mastopathia fibroso-cystica (mean = 16.82 fmol/mg protein). Mean concentrations nER and nPgR in benign and malignant tumours were not statistically significant. On the basis of our own investigations we can suggest that immunoenzymatic method supplied by Abbott is a simple test to perform and useful to evaluate hormonal dependence of cancer tissue.
Previously, we showed that changes in nuclear estrogen receptor (NER) concentrations within large dissections of the preoptic area and hypothalamus of pregnant rats might underlie changes in both maternal and sexual behaviors. To more precisely localize these biochemical changes, NER concentrations were measured in microdissected nuclei within the preoptic area and hypothalamus of pregnant rats on days 8, 16 and 22. Results indicated that NER levels changed significantly throughout pregnancy and that the magnitude and direction of change was site specific. Although a different pattern of change was found in each nucleus, NER levels in most preoptic area nuclei were significantly higher by the 16th day of pregnancy compared to those on day 8, while receptor levels in most hypothalamic nuclei did not increase until day 22 of pregnancy. The higher NER levels found in preoptic area nuclei of female rats as pregnancy advances can be correlated with growing maternal responsiveness during pregnancy, while elevated concentrations of NER in hypothalamic nuclei at the end of pregnancy may indicate preparation for postpartum estrus.
Biopsies from 131 women with squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix diagnosed between May 1983 and July 1986 were assayed for nuclear and "cytoplasmic" estrogen receptors (NER and CER). Progesterone receptors (PR) were also assayed in 45 of these tumors. About a third of the tumors contained both CER and NER. One or the other fraction contained ER in 76.9% of cases and PR in 66.6%. Although there was a trend for those women whose tumors contained CER or NER to have a better prognosis, this was not significant. There was no evidence that PR status affected the prognosis.
Breast cancer tissue from 95 women was simultaneously assayed for three receptors: cytosolic estrogen (CER), cytosolic progesterone (CPR), and nuclear estrogen (NER). The main objective was to determine whether the addition of NER assay to the currently accepted practice with only CER and CPR could improve the predictive capacity of receptors. Forty-two patients were studied for response to hormone therapy and 95 patients were studied for survival; the median follow-up period was 73 months (range, 8 to 300 months). The incidence of CER+, CPR+, and NER+ was 74%, 70%, and 52%, respectively. Each receptor appeared more frequently, although not significantly so, in higher age groups. Forty percent of tumors had all three receptors positive and 14% had all negative; the remaining tumors showed all possible combinations of receptors. Both the rate of response and survival curves among 70 patients with CER+ did not show any significant difference whether NER was positive or negative. Also, among 38 patients with CER+, CPR+, and NER+, there was no significant difference in the clinical outcome as compared to 17 patients with CER+, CPR+, and NER-. Among 25 patients with CER- the rare occurrence of NER+ in only three patients did not suggest any clinical implication. It is concluded, therefore, that on overall clinical grounds the current series does not support the addition of NER assay whenever data is available on both CER and CPR.
Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFr) and cytosolic (cER) and nuclear (nER) estradiol receptors were quantified in 220 primary breast cancers. The EGFr was significantly more frequent (X2 = 5.9; P less than 0.025) and its concentration was significantly higher (P less than 0.001) among ER- tumors than in ER+ tumors. There was a significantly greater proportion (X2 = 6.4; P less than 0.05) of node involvement in EGFr+/ER+ tumors than in EFGr/ER+. Increases in the proportion of EGFr+ in ER- tumors are parallel to Scarff-Bloom scores (X2 = 6.1; P less than 0.05) and there is a significant trend towards increased EGFr concentrations with histologic dedifferentiation. In ER+ tumors the median concentrations of EGFr in the different age groups show linear correlation and follow a parallel profile with the medians of nER. These findings support the hypothesis that considers EGFr as a bad prognosis factor and suggest that EGFr expression and concentration in ER+ tumors might be considered an estrogenic action mediated through the binding of ER to their nuclear acceptors.
The direct effect of estradiol (E2) on the hepatocytes of mature male rats has been examined by measuring the changes in the unusual estrogen-binding protein (UEBP) content and parallel measuring the level of liver estrogen receptors (ER). The content of UEBP (NUEBP) and ER (NER) in the liver were determined using the quantitative methods for differential specific determination of the E2-binding sites of these proteins. It has been shown that the administration of E2 in vivo induced a considerable decrease in hepatic NUEBP not only in intact males, but also in hypophysectomized males during the initial period after the operation (when the content of hepatic ER was still high) and produced no effect in hypophysectomized males during the later period (when liver ER were depleted). Repeated administration of human growth hormone (hGH) (twice a day) resulted in a considerable increase in NER in hypophysectomized males and restored the sensitivity to the subsequent inhibitory effect of E2 on UEBP. We also used rat hepatocytes after a 4-day primary culturing. These cells had a stable morpho-functional status, high ER level, and sex-differentiated UEBP content. Culturing of mature male rat hepatocytes in the medium containing E2 at concentrations close to physiological levels (10(-10)-10(-7) M) decreased NUEBP in a dose-dependent manner. Hexestrol (10(-7) M) but not cholesterol (10(-5) M) also exhibited a direct effect on NUEBP in cultured rat hepatocytes. The effect of E2 was reversible: statistically significant increase in NUEBP was observed 3 days after 10(-9) M E2 had been removed from the culturing medium. It was concluded that hepatocytes may be a primary target for E2 under physiological conditions and that GH may modulate the direct effect of E2 at the hepatic level by modifying the content of liver ER.
Progesterone withdrawal as a mechanism for parturition in primates is controversial. The progesterone antagonist RU486, given in late pregnancy to rhesus monkeys at a dose of 47 mmol/kg.day (20 mg/kg.day), causes an increase in uterine activity, but not the expected increase in amniotic fluid prostaglandins or cervical dilatation. We, therefore, studied the effect of RU486 on estrogen receptor (ER) localization and concentration in reproductive tract tissues in rhesus monkeys during late gestation and after spontaneous labor at term. Distribution of ER in pregnant uterine tissues was studied by immunocytochemical techniques and quantified by a biochemical assay, both of which employed a monoclonal antibody specific for ER. ER was not present in amnion and chorion by immunocytochemical investigation; however, a significant increase in receptor staining was seen in decidua and myometrium after RU486 treatment compared to that in both pregnant control tissues and parturient tissues. Sucrose gradient assay of nuclear (n) and cytosolic (c) ER revealed a low level of ER (expressed as fmol of estradiol bound/mg of DNA) in pregnant and parturient decidua (pregnant: nER = 7.3 +/- 2.4, cER = 17.1 +/- 6.4; parturient, nER = 7.7 +/- 3.1, cER = 16.4 +/- 8.8) and myometrium (pregnant: nER = 21.7 +/- 4.1, cER = 20.8 +/- 5.3; parturient: nER = 30.0 +/- 2.8, cER = 10.7 +/- 6.7). In contrast, tissues collected from RU486-treated animals contained high levels of ER in decidua (nER = 52.3 +/- 16.8, cER = 240.5 +/- 145.3) and myometrium (nER = 77.0 +/- 19.2; cER = 66.5 +/- 31.6). We conclude that 1) the increase in ER in decidua and myometrium after RU486 treatment is the result of a decrease in the inhibitory action of progesterone on ER and documents the progesterone receptor antagonism by RU486 during induced myometrial contractility in late pregnant rhesus monkeys; 2) the absence of ER from amnion and chorion indicates that the normally observed increase in prostaglandin production by rhesus fetal membranes during labor is not mediated by ER; and 3) the absence of a change in the concentration of ER in decidua and myometrium from pregnant control monkeys and those in spontaneous labor indicates that an increase in ER (and, by inference, a withdrawal of receptor-mediated progesterone inhibition) is not part of the normal events in preparation for parturition in primates.
This series of experiments investigated the relationship between various treatments consisting of estradiol benzoate (EB) and progesterone (P) on sexual receptivity and on concentrations of nuclear estrogen receptors (NER) and cytosolic progestin receptors (CPR) in the hypothalamus-preoptic area in female hamsters. The injection of 1 microgram EB at 0 and 24 hr resulted in higher levels of receptivity (after 0.25 or 0.5 mg P), NER and CPR compared to those obtained after a single injection of 2 micrograms EB. Animals treated with 5 micrograms EB at 0 and 24 hr displayed greater levels of receptivity (after 0.5 mg P) and had higher NER concentrations than animals given a single injection of 10 micrograms EB. Groups treated with either 1 microgram EB at 0 hr or 0.5 microgram EB at 0 and 24 hr did not differ and showed low levels of receptivity, NER and CPR, NER and CPR were also measured on each day of the estrous cycle. NER levels rose between Days 1 and 2, again between Days 2 and 3, and remained elevated on Day 4. CPR levels increased between Days 2 and 3, and there was no difference between Days 3 and 4. Taken together, these data suggest that receptivity in hamsters after estrogen exposure is correlated with the accumulation and maintenance of relatively high NER levels and on the induction of CPR. This can be accomplished by a single large injection of EB or by smaller split doses.
Several genes in human cells are activated by physical genotoxic agents in order to regenerate cell homeostasis. Among the pathways contributing to this response, nucleotide excision repair (NER) is unique in restoring the nucleotide sequence of the DNA molecule without generating mutations. The first step of NER is mediated by a protein complex composed of XPC, RAD23B, an ubiquitin receptor and CENTRIN 2, an EF-hand calcium binding protein. These three proteins are multifunctional and participate in other important biochemical pathways. We silenced the XPC, RAD23A or RAD23B genes in HeLa cells for a long period of time by using Epstein Barr Virus-derived plasmids carrying sequences coding for small interfering RNA. XPC silencing confirms an essential role for XPC in DNA repair and cell survival after ultraviolet light irradiation. RAD23A and RAD23B participate in DNA repair and cell survival with diverging functions. Our data also indicate that CENTRIN 2 is recruited onto nuclear damaged areas quickly after irradiation and that XPC plays an important role during its internalization into the nucleus of human cells. Furthermore, the inhibition of XPC expression correlates with a decreased amount of CENTRIN 2 transcript and protein, indicating that XPC is required for the fine tuning of CENTRIN 2 gene expression. Moreover, XPC-silenced cells present a reduced concentration of CENTRIN 2 that affects both its centrosomal and nuclear localization suggesting that XPC deficiency may indirectly slow down cell division.
Upon gene activation, we found that RNA polymerase II transcription machinery assembles sequentially with the nucleotide excision repair (NER) factors at the promoter. This recruitment occurs in absence of exogenous genotoxic attack, is sensitive to transcription inhibitors, and depends on the XPC protein. The presence of these repair proteins at the promoter of activated genes is necessary in order to achieve optimal DNA demethylation and histone posttranslational modifications (H3K4/H3K9 methylation, H3K9/14 acetylation) and thus efficient RNA synthesis. Deficiencies in some NER factors impede the recruitment of others and affect nuclear receptor transactivation. Our data suggest that there is a functional difference between the presence of the NER factors at the promoters (which requires XPC) and the NER factors at the distal regions of the gene (which requires CSB). While the latter may be a repair function, the former is a function with respect to transcription unveiled in the current study.
An expedient method has been developed by which goat uterine Hsp-90 could be isolated and purified to homogeneity in less than 1day. The yield is roughly 1mg from 60g tissue. This method takes into advantage three of our earlier observation that (a) Hsp-90 gets linked to the non-activated estrogen receptor (naER) in the presence of 10mM sodium molybdate; (b) naER, but not Hsp-90 binds to phosphocellulose and (c) exposure to estradiol facilitates dissociation of Hsp-90 from naER through estradiol binding to naER and the possible change in naER conformation. Intracellular movement of Hsp-90 and naER was monitored in goat endometrial cells in culture following exposure of the cells to estradiol. Confocal microscopic analysis revealed a clear presence of both proteins within the nucleus within 3h after exposure to estradiol. Whether Hsp-90 has its own nuclear-transport machinery is debatable. Being an actin-binding protein, there is a distinct possibility that the nuclear entry of Hsp-90 is actin dependent. The functional significance of the nuclear entry of Hsp-90, along with naER, remains to be determined; it may, however, be speculated that the Hsp-90 might be directly involved in the naER to nER II transformation by functioning as a molecular chaperone and helping the protein in re-orienting its structural organization.
The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) mediates toxicity of a variety of environmental pollutants such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and dioxins. However, the underlying mechanisms and genetic programmes regulated by AhR to cause adverse effects but also to counteract poisoning are still poorly understood. Here we analysed the effects of two AhR ligands, benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P), a DNA damaging tumour initiator and promotor and 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD), a pure tumour promoter, on cell survival and on nucleotide excision repair (NER) gene expression. NER deals with so called "bulky" DNA adducts including those generated by enzymatically activated B[a]P. Therefore, the hypothesis that AhR may enhance NER gene expression to trigger DNA repair in the presence of genotoxic AhR ligands was tested. Furthermore, we investigated a potential cytoprotective effect of AhR activation by the non-genotoxic ligand TCDD against cell death induced by various genotoxins. Finally, the actions of genotoxins themselves on NER gene expression were studied. As a cell culture model we used mouse hepatoma cells (Hepa-c7) proficient for AhR and its partner protein ARNT as well as subclones deficient in AhR (Hepa-c12) or ARNT (Hepa-c4) to study involvement of AhR and ARNT in response to B[a]P and TCDD. Indeed, the mRNA levels of the two NER genes XP-C and DNA polymerase kappa were increased by B[a]P and TCDD, however, this was not accompanied by an increase in the amount of the respective proteins. Pretreatment of cells with TCDD did not reduce cytotoxicity induced by various genotoxins. Thus, in Hepa-c7 cells AhR has no major effects on the expression of these crucial NER proteins and does not prevent genotoxin-provoked cell death. As expected, the genotoxins B[a]P and cis-platin led to p53 accumulation and induction of its target p21. Interestingly, however, NER gene expression was not enhanced but rather decreased. As two NER genes, XP-C and DNA damage binding protein ddb2, are up-regulated by p53 and ultraviolet radiation in human cells these findings suggest cell type, species or lesion specific actions of p53 on DNA repair gene expression. Importantly, in cells with damaged DNA up-regulation of p53 may not suffice to enhance DNA repair gene expression.
Nucleotide excision repair (NER) is the primary mechanism that removes bulky DNA adducts such as those caused by ubiquitous environmental mutagens including benzo(a)pyrene and other polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. Recent data suggest that exposure to environmentally relevant concentrations of estrogen decreases hepatic mRNA abundance of several key NER genes in adult zebrafish (Danio rerio). However, the impact of decreased hepatic NER expression on NER function was not investigated in the previous study. The goal of this study was to examine the effect of the potent estrogen receptor agonist 17alpha-ethinylestradiol (EE(2)) on rate and magnitude of bulky DNA adduct repair. Here we show that exposure of zebrafish liver (ZFL) cells to physiologically relevant concentrations of EE(2) resulted in reduced ability of ZFL cells to repair damaged DNA in comparison to control cells. Co-exposure to EE(2) and a complete estrogen receptor antagonist (ICI 182,780) also resulted in reduced NER capacity, whereas ICI 182,780 alone did not affect the ability of ZFL cells to repair UV damage. These results indicate that estrogen exposure can decrease cellular NER capacity and that this effect can occur in the presence of an estrogen receptor antagonist, suggesting that EE(2) can affect NER processes through mechanisms other than nuclear estrogen receptor activation.
Cadmium (Cd) has been shown to bind to the human estrogen receptor (ER), yet studies on Cd's estrogenic effects have yielded inconsistent results. In this study, we investigated the effects of Cd on DNA synthesis and its simultaneous effects on both genomic (mediated by nuclear ER (nER)) and non-genomic (mediated by membrane-bound ER (mER)) signaling in human breast cancer derived T47D cells. No effects on DNA synthesis were observed for non-cytotoxic concentrations of CdCl(2) (0.1-1000 nM), and Cd did not increase progesterone receptor (PgR) or pS2 mRNA levels. However, Cd stimulated phosphorylation of ERK1/2 MAPK, detectable following 10 min and 18 h of treatment. The sustained Cd-induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation was inhibited by the ER antagonist ICI 182,780, suggesting the involvement of ER. In addition, Cd enhanced DNA synthesis and pS2 mRNA levels in estrogen (10 pM estradiol) treated T47D cells. The MEK1/2 specific inhibitor U0126 blocked DNA synthesis stimulated by estradiol (E2) and the E2-Cd mixtures. These findings indicate that the ERK1/2 signaling is critical in E2-related DNA synthesis. The sustained ERK1/2 phosphorylation may contribute to the Cd-induced enhancement of DNA synthesis and pS2 mRNA in mixture with low-concentration E2.
We investigated the effect of beta-estradiol (E2) on synaptogenesis in the hippocampus using organotypic hippocampal slice cultures and subregional hippocampal neuron cultures. E2 increased the expression of PSD95, a postsynaptic marker, specifically in stratum lucidum of Cornu Ammonis 3 (CA3SL) in cultured hippocampal slices. E2 also increased the spine density at the proximal site of CA3 apical dendrites in CA3SL and PSD95 was clustered on these spine heads. The effects of E2 on the expression of PSD95 and the spine density disappeared when the dentate gyrus (DG) had been excised at 1 day in vitro (DIV). FM1-43 analysis of subregional hippocampal neuron cultures which were comprised of Ammon's horn neurons, DG neurons, or a mixture of these neurons, revealed that E2 increased the number of presynaptic sites in the cultures that contained DG neurons. K252a, a potent inhibitor of the high affinity receptor of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and function-blocking antibody to BDNF (BDNFAB) completely inhibited the effects of E2 in hippocampal slice cultures and subregional neuron cultures, whereas ICI182,780 (ICI), a strong antagonist of nuclear estrogen receptors (nERs), did not. Expression of BDNF in DG neurons was markedly higher than that in Ammon's horn neurons and E2 did not affect these expression levels. E2 significantly increased the BDNF release from DG neurons. KT5720, a specific inhibitor of 3'-5'-cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)-dependent protein kinase A (PKA), and Rp-adenosine 3', 5'-cyclic monophosphorothioate triethylammonium salt (Rp-cAMP), a non-hydrolyzable diastereoisomer and a potent inhibitor of PKA, completely suppressed the E2-induced increase in BDNF release, whereas ICI and U0126, a potent inhibitor of MAP kinase kinase (MEK), did not. These results suggest that E2 induces synaptogenesis between mossy fibers and CA3 neurons by enhancing BDNF release from DG granule cells in a nER-independent and PKA-dependent manner.
The roles of beta-NER (beta-noradrenergic receptor), GR (glucocorticoid) and mineral corticoid receptors (MR) in the consolidation of anxiogenic effects of predator stress were studied. One minute after predator stress, different groups of rats were injected (ip) with vehicle, propranolol (beta-NER blocker, 5 and 10 mg/kg), mifepristone (RU486, GR blocker, 20 mg/kg), spironolactone (MR blocker, 50 mg/kg), propranolol (5 mg/kg) plus RU486 (20 mg/kg) or the anxiolytic, chloradiazepoxide (CPZ, 10 mg/kg). One week later, rodent anxiety was assessed in elevated plus maze, hole board, light/dark box, social interaction and acoustic startle. Considering all tests except startle, propranolol dose dependently blocked consolidation of lasting anxiogenic effects of predator stress in all tests. GR receptor block alone was ineffective. However, GR block in combination with an ineffective dose of propranolol did blocked consolidation of predator stress effects in all tests, suggesting a synergism between beta-NER and GR. Surprisingly, MR block prevented consolidation of anxiogenic effects in all tests except the light/dark box. CPZ post stress was ineffective against the anxiogenic impact of predator stress. Study of startle was complicated by the fact that anxiogenic effects of stress on startle amplitude manifested as both an increase and a decrease in startle amplitude. Suppression of startle occurred in stressed plus vehicle injected groups handled three times prior to predator stress. In contrast, stressed plus vehicle rats handled five times prior to predator stress showed increases in startle, as did all predator stressed only groups. Mechanisms of consolidation of the different startle responses appear to differ. CPZ post stress blocked startle suppression but not enhancement of startle. Propranolol post stress had no effect on either suppression or enhancement of startle. GR block alone post stress prevented suppression of startle, but not enhancement. In contrast blocking GR and beta-NER together prevented startle enhancement. MR block also prevented startle enhancement. Effects of MR block on startle suppression were not tested. Delay of habituation to startle was found in all stressed rats. Consolidation of delay of habituation was blocked or attenuated by post stress MR block, GR plus beta-NER block and CPZ but not by post stress GR or beta-NER block alone. Taken together, present findings suggest consolidation of lasting anxiogenic effects of predator stress may share some of the same neurochemical mechanisms implicated in some forms of fear memory consolidation. Implications of these findings for the study of stress-induced changes in affect including posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are discussed.
The incidence of cutaneous melanoma is rising rapidly in a number of countries. The key environmental risk factor is exposure to the ultraviolet (UV) component in sunlight. The nucleotide excision repair (NER) pathway deals with the main forms of UV-induced DNA damage. We have investigated the hypothesis that polymorphisms in NER genes constitute genetic susceptibility factors for melanoma. However, not all melanomas arise on sun-exposed sites and so we investigated the hypothesis that genes involved in other pathways for the repair of oxidative DNA damage may also be involved in susceptibility to melanoma. Scotland, with its high incidence of melanoma and stable homogeneous population, was ideal for this case-control study, involving 596 Scottish melanoma patients and 441 population-based controls. Significant associations were found for the NER genes ERCC1 and XPF, with the strongest associations for melanoma cases aged 50 and under [ERCC1 odds ratio (OR) 1.59, P = 0.008; XPF OR 1.69, P = 0.003]. Although an XPD haplotype was associated with melanoma, it did not contain the variant 751 Gln allele, which has been associated with melanoma in some previous studies. No associations were found for the base excision repair and DNA damage response genes investigated. An association was also found for a polymorphism in the promoter of the vitamin D receptor gene, VDR (OR 1.88, P = 0.005). The products of the two NER genes, ERCC1 and XPF, where associations with melanoma were found, act together in a rate-limiting step in the repair pathway.
The classical mechanism of estradiol (E2) action is mediated by the nuclear estrogen receptors ERalpha and ERbeta, which function as ligand-dependent transcription factors that regulate transcription of target genes containing the consensus estrogen response element (ERE) in their promoter regions. However, accumulating evidence indicates that E2 can also exert its actions through a unique membrane estrogen receptor (mER). Upon activation of the mER, various signaling pathways (i.e. Ca(2+), cAMP, protein kinase cascades) are rapidly activated and ultimately influence downstream transcription factors. Some target genes of the mER pathway may be activated independently of the nuclear estrogen receptor (nER). Additionally, it has been shown that classical nER action can be modulated by mER-initiated signaling through phosphorylation of nER and its coactivators, and by induction of third messengers (i.e. cyclin D1 and c-fos). Based on current evidence, we propose a model for E2 action integrating distinct membrane receptor and nuclear receptor signaling. This membrane receptor-nuclear receptor interaction is likely to exist for other hormones. Steroid hormones and other hormones acting through hormone receptors in the steroid receptor superfamily (i.e. thyroid hormones) also activate many of the same intracellular signaling cascades, which provides the basis for extensive crosstalk networks between hormones. The model proposed serves as a framework to investigate the diverse actions of hormones and endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs).
The primary cellular location of the nuclear estrogen receptor II (nER II) is the plasma membrane. A number of reports that have appeared in the recent past indicate that plasma membrane localized estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha) also exists. Whether the membrane localized ERalpha represents the receptor that binds to the estrogen responsive element (ERE) remains to be known. The mechanisms that underlie the internalization of nER II (non-activated estrogen receptor, deglycosylated) have been identified to a certain extent. The question remains: is the primary location of the ERalpha also the plasma membrane? If that is the case, it will be a challenging task to identify the molecular events that underlie the plasma membrane-to-nucleus movement of ERalpha. The internalization mechanisms for the two 66kDa plasma membrane ERs, following hormone binding, appear to be distinct and without any overlaps. Interestingly, while the major gene regulatory role for ERalpha appears to be at the level of transcription, the nER II has its major functional role in post transcriptional mechanisms. The endoplasmic reticulum associated anchor protein-55 (ap55) that was recently reported from the author's laboratory needs a closer look. It is a high affinity estrogen binding protein that anchors the estrogen receptor activation factor (E-RAF) in an estrogen-mediated event. It will be interesting to examine whether ap55 bears any structural similarity with either ERalpha or ERbeta.
Estrogens play pivotal roles in hippocampal synaptic plasticity through nuclear receptors (nERs; including ERα and ERβ) and the membrane receptor (mER; also called GPR30), but the underlying mechanism and the contributions of nERs and mER remain unclear. Mammalian target of rapamycin complex 2 (mTORC2) is involved in actin cytoskeleton polymerization and long-term memory, but whether mTORC2 is involved in the regulation of hippocampal synaptic plasticity by ERs is unclear.
We treated animals with nER antagonists (MPP/PHTPP) or the mER antagonist (G15) alone or in combination with A-443654, an activator of mTORC2. Then, we examined the changes in hippocampal SRC-1 expression, mTORC2 signaling (rictor and phospho-AKTSer473), actin polymerization (phospho-cofilin and profilin-1), synaptic protein expression (GluR1, PSD95, spinophilin, and synaptophysin), CA1 spine density, and synapse density.
All of the examined parameters except synaptophysin expression were significantly decreased by MPP/PHTPP and G15 treatment. MPP/PHTPP and G15 induced a similar decrease in most parameters except p-cofilin, GluR1, and spinophilin expression. The ER antagonist-induced decreases in these parameters were significantly reversed by mTORC2 activation, except for the change in SRC-1, rictor, and synaptophysin expression.
nERs and mER contribute similarly to the changes in proteins and structures associated with synaptic plasticity, and mTORC2 may be a novel target of hippocampal-dependent dementia such as Alzheimer's disease as proposed by previous studies.
Estrogens signal through both nuclear and membrane receptors with most reported effects being mediated via the nuclear estrogen receptors (nERs). Although much work has been reported on nERs in the zebrafish, there is a lack of direct genetic evidence for their functional roles and importance in reproduction. To address this issue, we undertook this study to disrupt all three nERs in the zebrafish, namely esr1 (ERα), esr2a (ERβII), and esr2b (ERβI), by the genome-editing technology clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats and its associated nuclease (CRISPR/Cas9). Using this loss-of-function genetic approach, we successfully created three mutant zebrafish lines with each nER knocked out. In addition, we also generated all possible double and triple knockouts of the three nERs. The phenotypes of these mutants in reproduction were analyzed in all single, double, and triple nER knockouts in both females and males. Surprisingly, all three single nER mutant fish lines display normal reproductive development and function in both females and males, suggesting functional redundancy among these nERs. Further analysis of double and triple knockouts showed that nERs, especially Esr2a and Esr2b, were essential for female reproduction, and loss of these two nERs led to an arrest of folliculogenesis at previtellogenic stage II followed by sex reversal from female to male. In addition, the current study also revealed a unique role for Esr2a in follicle cell proliferation and transdifferentiation, follicle growth, and chorion formation. Taken together, this study provides the most comprehensive genetic analysis for differential functions of esr1, esr2a, and esr2b in fish reproduction.
Estradiol (E2) stimulates luteinizing hormone receptor (lhcgr) expression via nuclear estrogen receptors (nERs) in the zebrafish ovary. We have demonstrated that endocrine hormones such as gonadotropin (hCG) and paracrine factors such as epidermal growth factor (EGF) and pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating peptide (PACAP) can modulate E2-induced lhcgr expression in vitro. These observations raised a question on whether these hormones and factors exert their effects via regulating the expression of nERs. In this study, we first characterized the spatiotemporal expression profiles of three nER subtypes in the zebrafish ovary, including esr1 (ERα), esr2a (ERβ2) and esr2b (ERβ1). All three nERs increased their expression at the pre-vitellogenic stage and peaked at mid- (esr1 and esr2a) or late vitellogenic (esr2b) stage, followed by a significant decline at the full-grown stage. RT-PCR analysis showed that esr1 and esr2b were exclusively expressed in the follicle layer while esr2a was expressed in both compartments. We then examined how E2, hCG, PACAP and EGF regulated the expression of nERs in cultured zebrafish follicle cells. E2 quickly increased esr1 but reduced esr2a and esr2b expression from 1.5 to 12h of treatment. Similarly, EGF down-regulated esr2a significantly at 1.5h and this effect was further intensified at 24h. hCG decreased the expression of all three nER subtypes with similar potency throughout the 24-h time-course. Interestingly, PACAP exerted a biphasic regulation on esr2a. Our present study suggests that nERs, especially esr2a, provide potential target points for other hormones and factors to modulate E2 activity during folliculogenesis in the zebrafish.
Loss-of-function in melanocortin 1 receptor (MC1R), a GS protein-coupled receptor that regulates signal transduction through cAMP and protein kinase A (PKA) in melanocytes, is a major inherited melanoma risk factor. Herein, we report a novel cAMP-mediated response for sensing and responding to UV-induced DNA damage regulated by A-kinase-anchoring protein 12 (AKAP12). AKAP12 is identified as a necessary participant in PKA-mediated phosphorylation of ataxia telangiectasia mutated and Rad3-related (ATR) at S435, a post-translational event required for cAMP-enhanced nucleotide excision repair (NER). Moreover, UV exposure promotes ATR-directed phosphorylation of AKAP12 at S732, which promotes nuclear translocation of AKAP12-ATR-pS435. This complex subsequently recruits XPA to UV DNA damage and enhances 5' strand incision. Preventing AKAP12's interaction with PKA or with ATR abrogates ATR-pS435 accumulation, delays recruitment of XPA to UV-damaged DNA, impairs NER and increases UV-induced mutagenesis. Our results define a critical role for AKAP12 as an UV-inducible scaffold for PKA-mediated ATR phosphorylation, and identify a repair complex consisting of AKAP12-ATR-pS435-XPA at photodamage, which is essential for cAMP-enhanced NER.
Peripheral neuropathy is one of the major side effects of treatment with the anticancer drug, cisplatin. One proposed mechanism for this neurotoxicity is the formation of platinum adducts in sensory neurons that could contribute to DNA damage. Although this damage is largely repaired by nuclear excision repair (NER), our previous findings suggest that augmenting the base excision repair pathway (BER) by overexpressing the repair protein APE1 protects sensory neurons from cisplatin-induced neurotoxicity. The question remains whether APE1 contributes to the ability of the NER pathway to repair platinum-damage in neuronal cells. To examine this, we manipulated APE1 expression in sensory neuronal cultures and measured Pt-removal after exposure to cisplatin. When neuronal cultures were treated with increasing concentrations of cisplatin for two or three hours, there was a concentration-dependent increase in Pt-damage that peaked at four hours and returned to near baseline levels after 24h. In cultures where APE1 expression was reduced by ∼ 80% using siRNA directed at APE1, there was a significant inhibition of Pt-removal over eight hours which was reversed by overexpressing APE1 using a lentiviral construct for human wtAPE1. Overexpressing a mutant APE1 (C65 APE1), which only has DNA repair activity, but not its other significant redox-signaling function, mimicked the effects of wtAPE1. Overexpressing DNA repair activity mutant APE1 (226 + 177APE1), with only redox activity was ineffective suggesting it is the DNA repair function of APE1 and not its redox-signaling, that restores the Pt-damage removal. Together, these data provide the first evidence that a critical BER enzyme, APE1, helps regulate the NER pathway in the repair of cisplatin damage in sensory neurons.
Mutations in the XPD subunit of the DNA repair/transcription factor TFIIH result in distinct clinical entities, including the cancer-prone xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) and the multisystem disorder trichothiodystrophy (TTD), which share only cutaneous photosensitivity. Gene-expression profiles of primary dermal fibroblasts revealed overexpression of matrix metalloproteinase 1 (MMP-1), the gene encoding the metalloproteinase that degrades the interstitial collagens of the extracellular matrix (ECM), in TTD patients mutated in XPD compared with their healthy parents. The defect is observed in TTD and not in XP and is specific for fibroblasts, which are the main producers of dermal ECM. MMP-1 transcriptional up-regulation in TTD is caused by an erroneous signaling mediated by retinoic acid receptors on the MMP-1 promoter and leads to hypersecretion of active MMP-1 enzyme and degradation of collagen type I in the ECM of cell/tissue systems and TTD patient skin. In agreement with the well-known role of ECM in eliciting signaling events controlling cell behavior and tissue homeostasis, ECM alterations in TTD were shown to impact on the migration and wound-healing properties of patient dermal fibroblasts. The presence of a specific inhibitor of MMP activity was sufficient to restore normal cell migration, thus providing a potential approach for therapeutic strategies. This study highlights the relevance of ECM anomalies in TTD pathogenesis and in the phenotypic differences between TTD and XP. 
Histone methylation changes and formation of chromatin loops involving enhancers, promoters and 3' end regions of genes have been variously associated with active transcription in eukaryotes. We have studied the effect of activation of the retinoic A receptor, at the RARE-promoter chromatin of CASP9 and CYP26A1 genes, 15 and 45 min following RA exposure, and we found that histone H3 lysines 4 and 9 are demethylated by the lysine-specific demethylase, LSD1 and by the JMJ-domain containing demethylase, D2A. The action of the oxidase (LSD1) and a dioxygenase (JMJD2A) in the presence of Fe++ elicits an oxidation wave that locally modifies the DNA and recruits the enzymes involved in base and nucleotide excision repair (BER and NER). These events are essential for the formation of chromatin loop(s) that juxtapose the RARE element with the 5' transcription start site and the 3' end of the genes. The RARE bound-receptor governs the 5' and 3' end selection and directs the productive transcription cycle of RNA polymerase. These data mechanistically link chromatin loops, histone methylation changes and localized DNA repair with transcription. 
Skin exposure with UV radiation (UV) is the main cause of skin cancer development. Epidemiological data indicate that excessive or cumulative UV exposure takes place years and decades before the resulting malignancies arise. The most important defense mechanisms that protect human skin against UV radiation involve melanin synthesis and active repair mechanisms. DNA is the major target of direct or indirect UV-induced cellular damage. Low pigmentation capacity in white Caucasians and rare congenital defects in DNA repair are mainly responsible for protection failures. The important function of nucleotide excision DNA repair (NER) to protect against skin cancer becomes obvious by the rare genetic disease xeroderma pigmentosum, in which diverse NER genes are mutated. In animal models, it has been demonstrated that UVB is more effective to induce skin cancer than UVA. UV-induced DNA photoproducts are able to cause specific mutations (UV-signature) in susceptible genes for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and basal cell carcinoma (BCC). In SCC development, UV-signature mutations in the p53 tumor suppressor gene are the most common event, as precancerous lesions reveal -80% and SCCs &gt; 90% UV-specific p53 mutations. Mutations in Hedgehog pathway related genes, especially PTCH1, are well known to represent the most significant pathogenic event in BCC. However, specific UV-induced mutations can be found only in -50% of sporadic BCCs. Thus, cumulative UVB radiation cannot be considered to represent the only etiologic risk factor for BCC development. During the last decades, experimental animal models, including genetically engineered mice, the Xiphophorus hybrid fish, the South American oppossum and human skin xenografts, have further elucidated the important role of the DNA repair system in the multi-step process of UV-induced melanomagenesis. An increasing body of evidence now indicates that nucleotide excision repair is not the only DNA repair pathway that is involved in UV-induced tumorigenesis of melanoma and nonmelanoma skin cancer. An interesting new perspective in DNA damage and repair research lies in the participation of mammalian mismatch repair (MMR) in UV damage correction. As MMR enzyme hMSH2 displays a p53 target gene, is induced by UVB radiation and is involved in NER pathways, studies have now been initiated to elucidate the physiological and pathophysiological role of MMR in malignant melanoma and nonmelanoma skin cancer development. Interestingly, increasing evidence now demonstrates an important function of the vitamin D endocrine system (VDES) for prevention of BCC, SCC and melanoma, identifying the vitamin D receptor as a tumor suppressor in the skin.
The melanocortin 1 receptor (MC1R), which signals through cAMP, is a melanocytic transmembrane receptor involved in pigmentation, adaptive tanning, and melanoma resistance. We report MC1R-mediated or pharmacologically-induced cAMP signaling promotes nucleotide excision repair (NER) in a cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA)-dependent manner. PKA directly phosphorylates ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related protein (ATR) at Ser435, which actively recruits the key NER protein xeroderma pigmentosum complementation group A (XPA) to sites of nuclear UV photodamage, accelerating clearance of UV-induced photolesions and reducing mutagenesis. Loss of Ser435 within ATR prevents PKA-mediated ATR phosphorylation, disrupts ATR-XPA binding, delays recruitment of XPA to UV-damaged DNA, and elevates UV-induced mutagenesis. This study mechanistically links cAMP-PKA signaling to NER and illustrates potential benefits of cAMP pharmacological rescue to reduce UV mutagenesis in MC1R-defective, melanoma-susceptible individuals. 
Lipodystrophies represent a group of heterogeneous disorders characterized by loss of fat tissue. However, the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Using mice carrying an ERCC1-XPF DNA repair defect systematically or in adipocytes, we show that DNA damage signaling triggers a chronic autoinflammatory response leading to fat depletion. Ercc1-/- and aP2-Ercc1F/- fat depots show extensive gene expression similarities to lipodystrophic Pparγ(ldi/+) animals, focal areas of ruptured basement membrane, the reappearance of primary cilia, necrosis, fibrosis, and a marked decrease in adiposity. We find that persistent DNA damage in aP2-Ercc1F/- fat depots and in adipocytes ex vivo triggers the induction of proinflammatory factors by promoting transcriptionally active histone marks and the dissociation of nuclear receptor corepressor complexes from promoters; the response is cell autonomous and requires ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM). Thus, persistent DNA damage-driven autoinflammation plays a causative role in adipose tissue degeneration, with important ramifications for progressive lipodystrophies and natural aging.
Nucleotide excision repair (NER) is a major DNA repair pathway that ensures that the genome remains functionally intact and is faithfully transmitted to progeny. However, defects in NER lead, in addition to cancer and aging, to developmental abnormalities whose clinical heterogeneity and varying severity cannot be fully explained by the DNA repair deficiencies. Recent work has revealed that proteins in NER play distinct roles, including some that go well beyond DNA repair. NER factors are components of protein complexes known to be involved in nucleosome remodeling, histone ubiquitination, and transcriptional activation of genes involved in nuclear receptor signaling, stem cell reprogramming, and postnatal mammalian growth. Together, these findings add new pieces to the puzzle for understanding NER and the relevance of NER defects in development and disease.
Nucleotide excision repair factors, initially characterized as part of DNA repair, have been shown to participate in the transcriptional process in the absence of genotoxic attack. However, their molecular function when recruited at the promoters of activated genes together with the transcription machinery remained obscure. Here we show that the NER factors XPG and XPF are essential for establishing CTCF-dependent chromatin looping between the promoter and terminator of the activated RARβ2 gene. Silencing XPG and/or XPF endonucleases, or mutations in their catalytic sites, prevents CTCF recruitment, chromatin loop formation, and optimal transcription of RARβ2. We demonstrated that XPG endonuclease promotes DNA breaks and DNA demethylation at promoters allowing the recruitment of CTCF and gene looping, which is further stabilized by XPF. Our results highlight a timely orchestrated activity of the NER factors XPG and XPF in the formation of the active chromatin hub that controls gene expression.
Excision repair cross-complementation group 1 (ERCC1), which is a component of nucleotide excision repair (NER) pathway, removes platinum-induced DNA adducts. Overexpression of ERCC1 has been associated with resistance to platinum-based chemotherapy in ovarian and lung cancers. Detecting ERCC1 overexpression is important in considering treatment options for triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), and in conducting and interpreting trials that search to find specific chemotherapy regimens for TNBC. In this study we aimed to study ERCC1 overexpression in patients with TNBC.
A monoclonal antibody against ERCC1 was used for immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis of tumor samples. Tumor samples from 45 patients were evaluated by two experienced pathologists who were blinded to clinical data. A semi-quantitative H score (intensity staining scale ranging from no staining/0 to very intense staining/3+) was calculated by multiplying staining intensity with extent score. Tumors with H score ≥ 1 were classified as ERCC1-positive.
ERCC1 expression was positive in 73.3% of the tumor samples with an H score ≥ 1 and 26.7% of the tumor samples stained negative with an H score lt; 1. Of the tumor samples 15.5% stained diffusely and intensively.
Our study demonstrated that about two thirds of the TNBC showed positive expression of ERCC1, which may be predictive of a poor response to platinum-based chemotherapy.
UV irradiation is one of the major external insults to cells and can cause skin aging and cancer. In response to UV light-induced DNA damage, the nucleotide excision repair (NER) pathways are activated to remove DNA lesions. We report here that testicular nuclear receptor 4 (TR4), a member of the nuclear receptor family, modulates DNA repair specifically through the transcription-coupled (TC) NER pathway but not the global genomic NER pathway. The level of Cockayne syndrome B protein (CSB), a member of the TC-NER pathway, is 10-fold reduced in TR4-deficient mouse tissues, and TR4 directly regulates CSB at the transcriptional level. Moreover, restored CSB expression rescues UV hypersensitivity of TR4-deficient cells. Together, these results indicate that TR4 modulates UV sensitivity by promoting the TC-NER DNA repair pathway through transcriptional regulation of CSB. These results may lead to the development of new treatments for UV light-sensitive syndromes, skin cancer, and aging.
The aim of the study was to investigate how the dietary sterol composition, including cholesterol, phytosterol:cholesterol ratio and phytosterols, affect the absorption, biliary excretion, retention, tissue storage and distribution of cholesterol and individual phytosterols in Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.). A feeding trial was conducted at two different temperatures (6 and 12°C), using nine different diets with varying contents of phytosterols, cholesterol and phytosterol:cholesterol ratio. Cholesterol retention values were clearly dependent on dietary cholesterol, and showed that fish fed cholesterol levels &lt;1000 mg/kg feed produced considerable quantities of cholesterol de novo. Despite this production, cholesterol content increased with increasing dietary cholesterol in liver, plasma, bile, muscle, adipose tissue and whole fish at 12°C, and in plasma, bile and whole fish at 6°C. The tissue sterol composition generally depended on the dietary cholesterol content and on the dietary phytosterol:cholesterol ratio, but not on the dietary phytosterol content in itself. Campesterol and brassicasterol appeared to be the phytosterols with the highest intestinal absorption in Atlantic salmon. There was a high biliary excretion of campesterol, but not of brassicasterol, which accumulated in tissues and particularly in adipose tissue, with 2-fold-higher retention at 12°C compared with 6°C. Campesterol had the second highest retention of the phytosterols in the fish, but with no difference between the two temperatures. Other phytosterols had very low retention. Although brassicasterol retention decreased with increasing dietary phytosterols, campesterol retention decreased with increasing dietary cholesterol, indicating differences in the uptake mechanisms for these two sterols.
Lysosomal acid lipase deficiency is an autosomal recessive metabolic disease with a wide range of severity from Wolman Disease to Cholesterol Ester Storage Disease. Recently enzyme replacement therapy with sebelipase alpha has been approved by drug agencies for treatment of this lysosomal disease. Ezetimibe is an azetidine derivative which blocks Niemann Pick C1-Like 1 Protein; as its consequence, plasmatic concentration of low density lipoproteins and other apoB-containing lipoproteins, that are the substrate of lysosomal acid lipase, are decreased. Furthermore, ezetimibe acts by blocking inflammasome activation which is the cause of liver fibrosis in steatohepatitis and in lysosomal storage diseases.
Two patients with Cholesterol Ester Storage Disease were treated with ezetimibe for 9 years and a third patients for 10 years. Treatment was supplemented with low dose of atorvastatin in the first two patients during the last 6 years. All patients showed a significant reduction of alanine aminotransferase, cholesterol and triglyceride. Furthermore, no progression of liver fibrosis was demonstrated.
In this observational case series, ezetimibe is effective, safe, and sustainable treatment for lysosomal acid lipase deficiency. Further studies are warranted to demonstrate that ezetimibe is an alternative therapy to enzyme replacement therapy.
Increasing evidence implicates lysosomal dysfunction in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases, including the rare inherited lysosomal storage disorders (LSDs) and the most common neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease (AD and PD). Although the triggers of the lysosomal impairment may involve the accumulated macromolecules or dysfunction of the lysosomal enzymes, the role of the lysosomal glycocalyx in the lysosomal (dys)function has not been studied. The goal of this work was to analyze whether there are changes in the lysosomal glycocalyx in a cellular model of a LSD Niemann-Pick type C disease (NPC). Using the ferrofluid nanoparticles we isolated lysosomal organelles from NPC1-null and CHOwt cells. The magnetically isolated lysosomal fractions were enriched with the lysosomal marker protein LAMP1 and showed the key features of NPC disease: 3-fold higher cholesterol content and 4-5 fold enlarged size of the particles compared with the lysosomal fractions of wt cells. These lysosomal fractions were further processed to isolate lysosomal membrane proteins using Triton X-114 and their N-glycome was analyzed by HILIC-UPLC. N-glycans presented in each chromatographic peak were elucidated using MALDI-TOF/TOF-MS. We detected changes in the N-glycosylation pattern of the lysosomal glycocalyx of NPC1-null versus wt cells which involved high-mannose and sialylated N-glycans. To the best of our knowledge this study is the first to report N-glycome profiling of the lysosomal glycocalyx in NPC disease cellular model and the first to report the specific changes in the lysosomal glycocalyx in NPC1-null cells. We speculate that changes in the lysosomal glycocalyx may contribute to lysosomal (dys)function. Further glycome profiling of the lysosomal glycocalyx in other LSDs as well as the most common neurodegenerative diseases, such as AD and PD, is necessary to better understand the role of the lysosomal glycocalyx and to reveal its potential contribution in lysosomal dysfunction leading to neurodegeneration.
The feline model of Niemann-Pick disease, type C1 (NPC1) recapitulates the clinical, neuropathological, and biochemical abnormalities present in children with NPC1. The hallmarks of disease are the lysosomal storage of unesterified cholesterol and multiple sphingolipids in neurons, and the spatial and temporal distribution of Purkinje cell death. In feline NPC1 brain, microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3) accumulations, indicating autophagosomes, were found within axons and presynaptic terminals. High densities of accumulated LC3 were seen in subdivisions of the inferior olive, which project to cerebellar regions that show the most Purkinje cell loss, suggesting that autophagic abnormalities in specific climbing fibers may contribute to the spatial pattern of Purkinje cell loss seen. Biweekly intrathecal administration of 2-hydroxypropyl-beta cyclodextrin (HPβCD) ameliorated neurological dysfunction, reduced cholesterol and sphingolipid accumulation, and increased lifespan in NPC1 cats. LC3 pathology was reduced in treated animals suggesting that HPβCD administration also ameliorates autophagic abnormalities. This study is the first to (i) identify specific brain regions exhibiting autophagic abnormalities in any species with NPC1, (ii) provide evidence of differential vulnerability among discrete brain nuclei and pathways, and (iii) show the amelioration of these abnormalities in NPC1 cats treated with HPβCD.
The Niemann-Pick type C1 (NPC1) protein regulates the transport of cholesterol and fatty acids from late endosomes/lysosomes and has a central role in maintaining lipid homeostasis. NPC1 loss-of-function mutations in humans cause NPC1 disease, a rare autosomal-recessive lipid-storage disorder characterized by progressive and lethal neurodegeneration, as well as liver and lung failure, due to cholesterol infiltration. In humans, genome-wide association studies and post-genome-wide association studies highlight the implication of common variants in NPC1 in adult-onset obesity, body fat mass, and type 2 diabetes. Heterozygous human carriers of rare loss-of-function coding variants in NPC1 display an increased risk of morbid adult obesity. These associations have been confirmed in mice models, showing an important interaction with high-fat diet. In this review, we describe the current state of knowledge for NPC1 variants in relationship to pleiotropic effects on metabolism. We provide evidence that NPC1 gene variations may predispose to common metabolic diseases by modulating steroid hormone synthesis and/or lipid homeostasis. We also propose several important directions of research to further define the complex roles of NPC1 in metabolism. This review emphasizes the contribution of NPC1 to obesity and its metabolic complications.
Since their first identification 50 years ago, marburgviruses have emerged several times, with 83%-90% lethality in the largest outbreaks. Although no vaccines or therapeutics are available for human use, the human antibody MR191 provides complete protection in non-human primates when delivered several days after inoculation of a lethal marburgvirus dose. The detailed neutralization mechanism of MR191 remains outstanding. Here we present a 3.2 Å crystal structure of MR191 complexed with a trimeric marburgvirus surface glycoprotein (GP). MR191 neutralizes by occupying the conserved receptor-binding site and competing with the host receptor Niemann-Pick C1. The structure illuminates previously disordered regions of GP including the stalk, fusion loop, CX6CC switch, and an N-terminal region of GP2 that wraps about the outside of GP1 to anchor a marburgvirus-specific "wing" antibody epitope. Virus escape mutations mapped far outside the MR191 receptor-binding site footprint suggest a role for these other regions in the GP quaternary structure.
Westernization of dietary habits leads to an increase in lipid intake and is thought to be responsible for an increase in patients with dyslipidemia. It is a well-known fact that the impaired cholesterol homeostasis is closely related to the development of various lifestyle-related diseases such as fatty liver, diabetes, and gallstone as well as dyslipidemia leading to atherosclerosis and cardiovascular diseases such as heart attack and stroke. Therefore, appropriate management of cholesterol levels in the body is considered important in prevention and treatments of these lifestyle-related diseases and in addition, molecular mechanisms controlling plasma (and/or hepatic) cholesterol levels have been intensively studied. Due to its hydrophobicity, cholesterol was long believed to pass through cell membranes by passive diffusion. However, recent studies have identified a number of plasma membrane transporters that are responsible for the cellular uptake or efflux of cholesterol and involved in developments of lifestyle-related diseases. In this review, we focus on Niemann-Pick C1 Like 1 (NPC1L1) and a heterodimer of ATP-binding cassette transporter G5 and G8 (ABCG5/G8), both of which are responsible for intestinal cholesterol absorption and biliary cholesterol secretion, and discuss the relationship between these cholesterol transporters and lifestyle-related diseases. In addition, we also discuss the related uncertainties that need to be explored in future studies.
Ebola virus (EBOV), which belongs to the genus Ebolavirus, causes a severe and often fatal infection in primates, including humans, whereas Reston virus (RESTV) only causes lethal disease in non-human primates. Two amino acids (aa) at positions 82 and 544 of the EBOV glycoprotein (GP) are involved in determining viral infectivity. However, it remains unclear how these two aa residues affect the infectivity of Ebolavirus species in various hosts. Here we performed viral pseudotyping experiments with EBOV and RESTV GP derivatives in 10 cell lines from 9 mammalian species. We demonstrated that isoleucine at position 544/545 increases viral infectivity in all host species, whereas valine at position 82/83 modulates viral infectivity, depending on the viral and host species. Structural modelling suggested that the former residue affects viral fusion, whereas the latter residue influences the interaction with the viral entry receptor, Niemann-Pick C1.
The Npc1nmf164 allele of Npc1 provides a mouse model for Niemann-Pick disease type C1 (NPC1), a genetic disease known to have a widely variable phenotype. The transfer of the Npc1nmf164 mutation from the C57BL/6J inbred strain to the BALB/cJ inbred strain increased the mean lifespan from 117.8days to 153.1days, confirming that the severity of the NPC1 phenotype is strongly influenced by genetic background. The transfer of another Npc1 allele, Npc1nih, to this background also extended survival of the homozygotes indicating that the modifying effect of BALB/cJ is not limited to a single allele of Npc1. The increased longevity due to the BALB/cJ background did not map to a previously mapped modifier on chromosome 19, indicating the presence of additional genes impacting disease severity. The previously studied Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein promoter-Npc1 cDNA transgene (GFAP-Npc1) which only expresses NPC1 in astrocytes further extended the lifespan of Npc1nmf164 homozygotes on a BALB/cJ background (up to 600days). Hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin (HPβCD) treatment, not previously tested in the Npc1nmf164 mutant, extended life in the Npc1nmf164 homozygotes but not the transgenic, Npc1nmf164 mice on the BALB/cJ background. In all cases, lack of weight gain and early cerebellar symptoms of loss of motor control were found. At termination, the one mouse sacrificed for histological studies showed severe, diffuse pulmonary alveolar proteinosis suggesting that pulmonary abnormalities in NPC1 mouse models are not unique to the Npc1nih allele.
We have produced a new Ebola virus pseudotype, E-S-FLU, that can be handled in biosafety level 1/2 containment for laboratory analysis. The E-S-FLU virus is a single-cycle influenza virus coated with Ebolavirus glycoprotein, and it encodes enhanced green fluorescence protein as a reporter that replaces the influenza virus hemagglutinin. MDCK-SIAT1 cells were transduced to express Ebolavirus glycoprotein as a stable transmembrane protein for E-S-FLU virus production. Infection of cells with the E-S-FLU virus was dependent on the Niemann-Pick C1 protein, which is the well-characterized receptor for Ebola virus entry at the late endosome/lysosome membrane. The E-S-FLU virus was neutralized specifically by an anti-Ebolavirus glycoprotein antibody and a variety of small drug molecules that are known to inhibit the entry of wild-type Ebola virus. To demonstrate the application of this new Ebola virus pseudotype, we show that a single laboratory batch was sufficient to screen a library (LOPAC1280; Sigma) of 1,280 pharmacologically active compounds for inhibition of virus entry. A total of 215 compounds inhibited E-S-FLU virus infection, while only 22 inhibited the control H5-S-FLU virus coated in H5 hemagglutinin. These inhibitory compounds have very dispersed targets and mechanisms of action, e.g., calcium channel blockers, estrogen receptor antagonists, antihistamines, serotonin uptake inhibitors, etc., and this correlates with inhibitor screening results obtained with other pseudotypes or wild-type Ebola virus in the literature. The E-S-FLU virus is a new tool for Ebola virus cell entry studies and is easily applied to high-throughput screening assays for small-molecule inhibitors or antibodies.IMPORTANCE Ebola virus is in the Filoviridae family and is a biosafety level 4 pathogen. There are no FDA-approved therapeutics for Ebola virus. These characteristics warrant the development of surrogates for Ebola virus that can be handled in more convenient laboratory containment to study the biology of the virus and screen for inhibitors. Here we characterized a new surrogate, named E-S-FLU virus, that is based on a disabled influenza virus core coated with the Ebola virus surface protein but does not contain any genetic information from the Ebola virus itself. We show that E-S-FLU virus uses the same cell entry pathway as wild-type Ebola virus. As an example of the ease of use of E-S-FLU virus in biosafety level 1/2 containment, we showed that a single production batch could provide enough surrogate virus to screen a standard small-molecule library of 1,280 candidates for inhibitors of viral entry.
To discuss recent insights into the measurement and cellular basis of transintestinal cholesterol excretion (TICE) in humans and to explore TICE as a therapeutic target for increasing reverse cholesterol transport.
TICE is the net effect of cholesterol excretion by the enterocyte into the intestinal lumen and is the balance between input and output fluxes through the enterocytes. These fluxes are: cholesterol excretion into the intestinal lumen mainly via ATP-binding cassette (ABC) G5/8, cholesterol absorption from the intestine by Niemann-Pick C1 like protein 1, the uptake of plasma lipoproteins by enterocytes at the basolateral membrane, and the excretion of cholesterol in chylomicrons into the lymph. Multiple studies have shown that TICE contributes to fecal neutral sterol (FNS) excretion in humans. TICE can be targeted with plant sterols, liver X receptor agonists, bile acids, ezetimibe, and proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 inhibitors.
TICE contributes significantly to FNS excretion in humans, independently of the biliary pathway. Knowledge about its underlying cellular mechanisms surges through in-vivo and in-vitro studies in mice and humans. TICE might be an interesting therapeutic target for increasing cholesterol disposal with the feces. Albeit multiple therapeutic options are available, studies showing clinical benefit are still needed.
Saponins identified from fenugreek (Trigonella foenum-graecum) seeds are reported effective on dyslipidemia. However, the definite mechanism is still not elucidated systematically. In this study, we evaluate the effects of saponin extract on cholesterol absorption, metabolism, synthesis, and reverse cholesterol transport in vivo.
Saponin extract was prepared according to a craft established in our previous study. After the establishment of dyslipidemia model, 40 male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into five groups, namely the control group (normal diet plus normal saline), HFD group (high fat diet plus normal saline), Lipitor group (high fat diet plus Lipitor (2 mg/kg)), and L, M, and H-saponin groups (high fat diet plus saponin in dosages of 6, 12, and 24 mg/kg, respectively). Rats were sacrificed at the end of the 9th week after treatment. Biochemical characteristics of rats were tested, histopathological sections of liver tissue were observed, and the protein and mRNA expression of related factors of cholesterol in the intestine and liver were determined. One-way ANOVA test (SPSS software version 11.5, Chicago, IL, USA) was used to determine statistically significant differences between the HFD and other groups.
In saponin groups, the serum lipid, bile acid efflux, anti-peroxide activities, and lipid area of liver tissue improved. Cholesterol 7alpha-hydroxylase and scavenger receptor class B type I elevated in the liver. 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase levels were suppressed in both the serum and liver. However, significant cholesterol efflux was not found and Niemann-Pick C1-Like 1 levels elevated in the intestine.
The mechanisms of saponin in Fenugreek effect on ameliorating dyslipidemia are probably related to accelerated cholesterol metabolism, inhibited cholesterol synthesis, and facilitated reverse cholesterol transport, but not cholesterol absorption.
An excessive rise in blood lipids during pregnancy may promote metabolic dysfunction in adult progeny. We characterized how maternal phytosterol (PS) supplementation affected serum lipids and the expression of lipid-regulatory genes in the intestine and liver of newly-weaned apo-E deficient offspring from dams fed a chow diet supplemented with cholesterol (0.15%, CH) or cholesterol and PS (2%) (CH/PS) throughout pregnancy and lactation.
Serum lipid concentrations and lipoprotein particle numbers were exacerbated in offspring from cholesterol-supplemented mothers but normalized to chow-fed levels in pups exposed to PS through the maternal diet during gestation and lactation. Compared with the CH pups, pups from PS-supplemented mothers demonstrated higher (p &lt; 0.05) expression of the primary intestinal cholesterol transport protein (Niemann-Pick C1-like 1) and the rate-limiting enzyme in hepatic cholesterol synthesis (HMG-CoAr), suggestive of a compensatory response to restore cholesterol balance. Furthermore, pups from PS-supplemented mothers exhibited a coordinated downregulation (p &lt; 0.05) of several genes regulating fatty acid synthesis including PGC1β, SREBP1c, FAS, and ACC compared with the CH group. These results suggest that maternal PS supplementation during hypercholesterolemic pregnancies protects against aberrant lipid responses in newly-weaned offspring and results in differential regulation of cholesterol and lipid regulatory targets within the enterohepatic loop.
Amyloid precursor protein (APP) is cleaved by a set of proteases including α-/β-/γ- and recently identified η-secretases, generating C-terminal fragments (CTFs) of varying lengths and amyloid β (Aβ) peptides, which are considered to play a pivotal role in Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis. Cellular cholesterol content/distribution can regulate the production/clearance of APP metabolites and hence modify AD pathology. To determine the functional relation between endosomal-lysosomal (EL) cholesterol sequestration and APP metabolism, we used our recently developed mouse N2a-ANPC cells that overexpress Swedish mutant human APP in the absence of cholesterol-trafficking Niemann-Pick type C1 (Npc1) protein. Here, we report that neither increased levels nor EL cholesterol sequestration altered APP holoprotein levels but caused the intracellular accumulation of APP α-/β-/η-CTFs and Aβ1-40/42 peptides. The levels of APP-cleaved products increased as a function of extracellular serum concentration in N2a-ANPC cells, which are more vulnerable to death than the control cells. Additionally, we show that pH of the lysosomal vesicles in N2a-ANPC cells shifted to a less acidic range with increasing serum concentrations, thus making them less efficient functionally. Interestingly, the addition of cholesterol to the culture media not only increased the levels of cellular cholesterol and APP-cleaved products but also rendered the cells more vulnerable to toxicity. Collectively, our results suggest that extracellular cholesterol concentration in serum under conditions of Npc1 deficiency can influence intracellular cholesterol content/distribution and lysosomal efficacy, triggering the accumulation of toxic APP-cleaved products, eventually leading to cell death.
Similar to other positive-strand RNA viruses, hepatitis C virus (HCV) causes massive rearrangements of intracellular membranes, resulting in a membranous web (MW) composed of predominantly double-membrane vesicles (DMVs), the presumed sites of RNA replication. DMVs are enriched for cholesterol, but mechanistic details on the source and recruitment of cholesterol to the viral replication organelle are only partially known. Here we focused on selected lipid transfer proteins implicated in direct lipid transfer at various endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-membrane contact sites. RNA interference (RNAi)-mediated knockdown identified several hitherto unknown HCV dependency factors, such as steroidogenic acute regulatory protein-related lipid transfer domain protein 3 (STARD3), oxysterol-binding protein-related protein 1A and -B (OSBPL1A and -B), and Niemann-Pick-type C1 (NPC1), all residing at late endosome and lysosome membranes and required for efficient HCV RNA replication but not for replication of the closely related dengue virus. Focusing on NPC1, we found that knockdown or pharmacological inhibition caused cholesterol entrapment in lysosomal vesicles concomitant with decreased cholesterol abundance at sites containing the viral replicase factor NS5A. In untreated HCV-infected cells, unesterified cholesterol accumulated at the perinuclear region, partially colocalizing with NS5A at DMVs, arguing for NPC1-mediated endosomal cholesterol transport to the viral replication organelle. Consistent with cholesterol being an important structural component of DMVs, reducing NPC1-dependent endosomal cholesterol transport impaired MW integrity. This suggests that HCV usurps lipid transfer proteins, such as NPC1, at ER-late endosome/lysosome membrane contact sites to recruit cholesterol to the viral replication organelle, where it contributes to MW functionality.IMPORTANCE A key feature of the replication of positive-strand RNA viruses is the rearrangement of the host cell endomembrane system to produce a membranous replication organelle (RO). The underlying mechanisms are far from being elucidated fully. In this report, we provide evidence that HCV RNA replication depends on functional lipid transport along the endosomal-lysosomal pathway that is mediated by several lipid transfer proteins, such as the Niemann-Pick type C1 (NPC1) protein. Pharmacological inhibition of NPC1 function reduced viral replication, impaired the transport of cholesterol to the viral replication organelle, and altered organelle morphology. Besides NPC1, our study reports the importance of additional endosomal and lysosomal lipid transfer proteins required for viral replication, thus contributing to our understanding of how HCV manipulates their function in order to generate a membranous replication organelle. These results might have implications for the biogenesis of replication organelles of other positive-strand RNA viruses.
For entry, Ebola virus (EBOV) requires the interaction of its viral glycoprotein with the cellular protein Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1) which resides in late endosomes and lysosomes. How EBOV is trafficked and delivered to NPC1 and whether this is positively regulated during entry remain unclear. Here, we show that the PIKfyve-ArPIKfyve-Sac3 cellular complex, which is involved in the metabolism of phosphatidylinositol (3,5) bisphosphate (PtdIns(3,5)P2), is critical for EBOV infection. Although the expression of all subunits of the complex was required for efficient entry, PIKfyve kinase activity was specifically critical for entry by all pathogenic filoviruses. Inhibition of PIKfyve prevented colocalization of EBOV with NPC1 and led to virus accumulation in intracellular vesicles with characteristics of early endosomes. Importantly, genetically-encoded phosphoinositide probes revealed an increase in PtdIns(3,5)P2-positive vesicles in cells during EBOV entry. Taken together, our studies suggest that EBOV requires PtdIns(3,5)P2 production in cells to promote efficient delivery to NPC1.
The Niemann-Pick type C is a rare neurodegenerative disease that results from loss-of-function point mutations in NPC1 or NPC2, which affect the homeostasis of sphingolipids and sterols in human cells. We have previously shown that yeast lacking Ncr1, the orthologue of human NPC1 protein, display a premature ageing phenotype and higher sensitivity to oxidative stress associated with mitochondrial dysfunctions and accumulation of long chain bases. In this study, a lipidomic analysis revealed specific changes in the levels of ceramide species in ncr1Δ cells, including decreases in dihydroceramides and increases in phytoceramides. Moreover, the activation of Sit4, a ceramide-activated protein phosphatase, increased in ncr1Δ cells. Deletion of SIT4 or CDC55, its regulatory subunit, increased the chronological lifespan and hydrogen peroxide resistance of ncr1Δ cells and suppressed its mitochondrial defects. Notably, Sch9 and Pkh1-mediated phosphorylation of Sch9 decreased significantly in ncr1Δsit4Δ cells. These results suggest that phytoceramide accumulation and Sit4-dependent signaling mediate the mitochondrial dysfunction and shortened lifespan in the yeast model of Niemann-Pick type C1, in part through modulation of the Pkh1-Sch9 pathway.
Cholesterol is an important modulator of membrane protein function and signaling in endothelial cells, thus making it an emerging target for anti-angiogenic agents. In this study, we employed a phenotypic screen that detects intracellular cholesterol distribution in endothelial cells (HUVEC) and identified 13 existing drugs as cholesterol trafficking inhibitors. Cepharanthine, an approved drug for anti-inflammatory and cancer management use, was amongst the candidates, which was selected for in-depth mechanistic studies to link cholesterol trafficking and angiogenesis. Cepharanthine inhibited the endolysosomal trafficking of free-cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein in HUVEC by binding to Niemann-Pick disease, type C1 (NPC1) protein and increasing the lysosomal pH. The blockade of cholesterol trafficking led to a cholesterol-dependent dissociation of mTOR from the lysosomes and inhibition of its downstream signaling. Cepharanthine inhibited angiogenesis in HUVEC and in zebrafish in a cholesterol-dependent manner. Furthermore, cepharanthine suppressed tumor growth in vivo by inhibiting angiogenesis and it enhanced the antitumor activity of the standard chemotherapy cisplatin in lung and breast cancer xenografts in mice. Altogether, these results strongly support the idea that cholesterol trafficking is a viable drug target for anti-angiogenesis and that the inhibitors identified among existing drugs, such as cepharanthine, could be potential anti-angiogenic and antitumor agents.
The aim of this work was to clarify the molecular mechanism underlying the fatty degeneration of livers infected with Muscovy duck reovirus (MDRV), which produces obvious white necrotic foci in the liver. Transcriptome data for MDRV-infected Muscovy duck livers and control livers were sequenced, assembled, and annotated with Illumina® HiSeq 2000. The differentially expressed genes were screened and their functions were analysed. We also determined and confirmed the molecular mechanism of the hepatic fat metabolism disorder caused by MDRV infection. The expression of 4190 genes was higher in the infected livers than in the control livers, and the expression of 1113 genes was reduced. A Gene Ontology analysis showed that these genes were involved in 48 biological functions, and were significantly enriched in 237 Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways. The free fatty acid content was significantly higher in the livers of infected Muscovy ducks than in the control livers (P &lt; 0.01). The KEGG analysis showed that MDRV infection inhibited the cholesterol efflux from hepatic cells and reduced the expression of key enzymes involved in fatty acid degradation (scavenger receptor class b type 1, ABCG8, and APOA4), leading to the accumulation of fatty acids and cholesterol in the liver cells. In this study, we have identified the genes differentially expressed in livers infected by MDRV, from which we inferred the genes associated with lipodystrophia, and elucidated the molecular mechanism of the hepatic steatosis induced by MDRV.

Ascorbate-induced release of heparan sulfate from S-nitrosylated heparan sulfate proteoglycan glypican-1 takes place in endosomes. Heparan sulfate penetrates the membrane and is transported to the nucleus. This process is dependent on copper and on expression and processing of the amyloid precursor protein. It remains unclear how exogenously supplied ascorbate can generate HS-anMan in endosomes and how passage through the membrane is facilitated. Here we have examined wild-type, Alzheimer Tg2576 and amyloid precursor protein (-/-) mouse fibroblasts and human fetal and Niemann-Pick C1 fibroblasts by using deconvolution immunofluorescence microscopy, siRNA technology and [S35]sulfate-labeling, vesicle isolation and gel chromatography. We found that ascorbate-induced release of heparan sulfate was dependent on expression of endosomal cytochrome b561. Formation and nuclear transport of heparan sulfate was suppressed by inhibition of β-processing of the amyloid precursor protein and formation was restored by copper (I) ions. Membrane penetration was not dependent on amyloid beta channel formation. Inhibition of endosomal exit resulted in accumulation of heparan sulfate in vesicles that exposed the C-terminal of the amyloid precursor protein externally. Endosome-to-nucleus transport was also dependent on expression of the Niemann-Pick C1 protein. We propose that ascorbate is taken up from the medium and is oxidized by cytochrome b561 which, in turn, reduces copper (II) to copper (I) present in the N-terminal, β-cleaved domain of the amyloid precursor protein. Re-oxidation of copper (I) is coupled to reductive, deaminative release of heparan sulfate from glypican-1. Passage through the membrane may be facilitated by the C-terminal, β-cleaved fragment of the amyloid precursor protein and the Niemann-Pick C1 protein.
Ebolavirus (EBOV), an enveloped filamentous RNA virus causing severe hemorrhagic fever, enters cells by macropinocytosis and membrane fusion in a late endosomal compartment. Fusion is mediated by the EBOV envelope glycoprotein GP, which consists of subunits GP1 and GP2. GP1 binds to cellular receptors, including Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1) protein, and GP2 is responsible for low pH-induced membrane fusion. Proteolytic cleavage and NPC1 binding at endosomal pH lead to conformational rearrangements of GP2 that include exposing the hydrophobic fusion loop (FL) for insertion into the cellular target membrane and forming a six-helix bundle structure. Although major portions of the GP2 structure have been solved in pre- and postfusion states and although current models place the transmembrane (TM) and FL domains of GP2 in close proximity at critical steps of membrane fusion, their structures in membrane environments, and especially interactions between them, have not yet been characterized. Here, we present the structure of the membrane proximal external region (MPER) connected to the TM domain: i.e., the missing parts of the EBOV GP2 structure. The structure, solved by solution NMR and EPR spectroscopy in membrane-mimetic environments, consists of a helix-turn-helix architecture that is independent of pH. Moreover, the MPER region is shown to interact in the membrane interface with the previously determined structure of the EBOV FL through several critical aromatic residues. Mutation of aromatic and neighboring residues in both binding partners decreases fusion and viral entry, highlighting the functional importance of the MPER/TM-FL interaction in EBOV entry and fusion.
Niemann-Pick type C (NPC) disease is an inherited, progressive neurodegenerative disorder principally caused by mutations in the NPC1 gene. NPC disease is characterized by the accumulation of unesterified cholesterol in the late endosomes (LE) and lysosomes (Ly) (LE/Ly). Vorinostat, a histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi), restores cholesterol homeostasis in fibroblasts derived from NPC patients; however, the exact mechanism by which Vorinostat restores cholesterol level is not known yet. In this study, we performed comparative proteomic profiling of the response of NPC1I1061T fibroblasts to Vorinostat. After stringent statistical criteria to filter identified proteins, we observed 202 proteins that are differentially expressed in Vorinostat-treated fibroblasts. These proteins are members of diverse cellular pathways including the endomembrane dependent protein folding-stability-degradation-trafficking axis, energy metabolism, and lipid metabolism. Our study shows that treatment of NPC1I1061T fibroblasts with Vorinostat not only enhances pathways promoting the folding, stabilization and trafficking of NPC1 (I1061T) mutant to the LE/Ly, but alters the expression of lysosomal proteins, specifically the lysosomal acid lipase (LIPA) involved in the LIPA-&gt;NPC2-&gt;NPC1 based flow of cholesterol from the LE/Ly lumen to the LE/Ly membrane. We posit that the Vorinostat may modulate numerous pathways that operate in an integrated fashion through epigenetic and post-translational modifications reflecting acetylation/deacetylation balance to help manage the defective NPC1 fold, the function of the LE/Ly system and/or additional cholesterol metabolism/distribution pathways, that could globally contribute to improved mitigation of NPC1 disease in the clinic based on as yet uncharacterized principles of cellular metabolism dictating cholesterol homeostasis.
Decreased fertility and birth rates arise from metabolic disorders. This study assesses cholesterol metabolism and Cx46, Cx50, and Cx43 expression in interstitium- and seminiferous tubule-enriched fractions of leptin-deficient ( ob/ob) and leptin receptor-deficient ( db/db) mice, two type 2 diabetes and obesity models associated with infertility. Testosterone levels decreased and glucose and free and esterified cholesterol (FC and EC) levels increased in serum, whereas FC and EC levels decreased in the interstitium, in ob/ob and db/db mice. In tubules, a decrease in EC caused FC-to-EC ratios to increase in db/db mice. In tubules, only acyl coenzyme A:cholesterol acyl transferase type 1 and 2 protein levels significantly decreased in ob/ob, but not db/db, mice compared with wild-type mice, and imbalances in the cholesterol transporters Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1), ATP-binding cassette A1 (ABCA1), scavenger receptor class B member I (SR-BI), and cluster of differentiation 36 (CD36) were observed in ob/ob and db/db mice. In tubules, 14-kDa Cx46 prevailed during development, 48- to 49- and 68- to 71-kDa Cx46 prevailed during adulthood, and total Cx46 changed little. Compared with wild-type mice, 14-kDa Cx46 increased, whereas 48- to 49- and 68- to 71-kDa Cx46 decreased, in tubules, whereas the opposite occurred in the interstitium, in db/db and ob/ob mice. Total and 51-kDa Cx50 increased in db/db and ob/ob interstitium and tubules. Cx43 levels decreased in ob/ob interstitium and tubules, whereas Cx43 decreased in db/db interstitium but increased in db/db tubules. Apoptosis levels measured by ELISA and numbers of apostain-labeled apoptotic cells significantly increased in db/db, but not ob/ob, tubules. Testicular db/db capillaries were Cx50-positive but weakly Cx43-positive with a thickened lamina, suggesting altered permeability. Our findings indicate that the db mutation-induced impairment of meiosis may arise from imbalances in cholesterol metabolism and upregulated Cx43 expression and phosphorylation in tubules.
Niemann-Pick disease Type C1 (NPC1) is a rare progressive neurodegenerative disorder caused by mutations in the NPC1 gene. The pathological mechanisms, underlying NPC1 are not yet completely understood. Especially the contribution of glial cells and gliosis to the progression of NPC1, are controversially discussed. As an analysis of affected cells is unfeasible in NPC1-patients, we recently developed an in vitro model system, based on cells derived from NPC1-patient specific iPSCs. Here, we asked if this model system recapitulates gliosis, observed in non-human model systems and NPC1 patient post mortem biopsies. We determined the amount of reactive astrocytes and the regulation of the intermediate filaments GFAP and vimentin, all indicating gliosis. Furthermore, we were interested in the assembly and phosphorylation of these intermediate filaments and finally the impact of the activation of protein kinase C (PKC), which is described to ameliorate the pathogenic phenotype of NPC1-deficient fibroblasts, including hypo-phosphorylation of vimentin and cholesterol accumulation.
We analysed glial cells derived from NPC1 patient specific induced pluripotent stem cells, carrying different NPC1 mutations. The amount of reactive astrocytes was determined by means of immuncytochemical stainings and FACS-analysis. Semi-quantitative western blot was used to determine the amount of phosphorylated GFAP and vimentin. Cholesterol accumulation was analysed by Filipin staining and quantified by Amplex Red Assay. U18666A was used to induce NPC1 phenotype in unaffected cells of the control cell line. Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) was used to activate PKC.
Immunocytochemical detection of GFAP, vimentin and Ki67 revealed that NPC1 mutant glial cells undergo gliosis. We found hypo-phosphorylation of the intermediate filaments GFAP and vimentin and alterations in the assembly of these intermediate filaments in NPC1 mutant cells. The application of U18666A induced not only NPC1 phenotypical accumulation of cholesterol, but characteristics of gliosis in glial cells derived from unaffected control cells. The application of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, an activator of protein kinase C resulted in a significantly reduced number of reactive astrocytes and further characteristics of gliosis in NPC1-deficient cells. Furthermore, it triggered a restoration of cholesterol amounts to level of control cells.
Our data demonstrate that glial cells derived from NPC1-patient specific iPSCs undergo gliosis. The application of U18666A induced comparable characteristics in un-affected control cells, suggesting that gliosis is triggered by hampered function of NPC1 protein. The activation of protein kinase C induced an amelioration of gliosis, as well as a reduction of cholesterol amount. These results provide further support for the line of evidence that gliosis might not be only a secondary reaction to the loss of neurons, but might be a direct consequence of a reduced PKC activity due to the phenotypical cholesterol accumulation observed in NPC1. In addition, our data support the involvement of PKCs in NPC1 disease pathogenesis and suggest that PKCs may be targeted in future efforts to develop therapeutics for NPC1 disease.
Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor-related protein 6 (LRP6) was originally identified as a co-receptor of the Wnt signalling pathway and has been shown to be involved in LDL transport. In polarized hepatocytes, many apical proteins are sorted to the basolateral membrane and then internalized and transported to the apical bile canalicular membrane - a process known as transcytosis. We show that LRP6 is transcytosed to the apical membrane of polarized hepatic HepG2 cells via a flotillin-dependent manner in the absence of LDL. LRP6 formed a complex with Niemann-Pick type C1-like 1 (NPC1L1), which is localized to the bile canalicular membrane of the liver and is involved in cholesterol absorption from the bile. LRP6 was required for apical membrane localization of NPC1L1 in the absence of LDL. Clathrin-dependent LRP6 internalization occurred in the presence of LDL, which resulted in trafficking of LRP6 to the lysosome, thereby reducing apical sorting of LRP6 and NPC1L1. These results suggest that LRP6 endocytosis proceeds by two routes, depending on the presence of LDL, and that LRP6 controls the intracellular destination of NPC1L1 in hepatocytes.
Niemann-Pick disease, type C1 (NPC1) is a lysosomal storage disorder characterised by progressive neurodegeneration. In preclinical testing, 2-hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrins (HPβCD) significantly delayed cerebellar Purkinje cell loss, slowed progression of neurological manifestations, and increased lifespan in mouse and cat models of NPC1. The aim of this study was to assess the safety and efficacy of lumbar intrathecal HPβCD.
In this open-label, dose-escalation phase 1-2a study, we gave monthly intrathecal HPβCD to participants with NPC1 with neurological manifestation at the National Institutes of Health (NIH), Bethesda, MD, USA. To explore the potential effect of 2-week dosing, three additional participants were enrolled in a parallel study at Rush University Medical Center (RUMC), Chicago, IL, USA. Participants from the NIH were non-randomly, sequentially assigned in cohorts of three to receive monthly initial intrathecal HPβCD at doses of 50, 200, 300, or 400 mg per month. A fifth cohort of two participants received initial doses of 900 mg. Participants from RUMC initially received 200 or 400 mg every 2 weeks. The dose was escalated based on tolerance or safety data from higher dose cohorts. Serum and CSF 24(S)-hydroxycholesterol (24[S]-HC), which serves as a biomarker of target engagement, and CSF protein biomarkers were evaluated. NPC Neurological Severity Scores (NNSS) were used to compare disease progression in HPβCD-treated participants relative to a historical comparison cohort of 21 NPC1 participants of similar age range.
Between Sept 21, 2013, and Jan 19, 2015, 32 participants with NPC1 were assessed for eligibility at the National Institutes of Health. 18 patients were excluded due to inclusion criteria not met (six patients), declined to participate (three patients), pursued independent expanded access and obtained the drug outside of the study (three patients), enrolled in the RUMC cohort (one patient), or too late for the trial enrolment (five patients). 14 patients were enrolled and sequentially assigned to receive intrathecal HPβCD at a starting dose of 50 mg per month (three patients), 200 mg per month (three patients), 300 mg per month (three patients), 400 mg per month (three patients), or 900 mg per month (two patients). During the first year, two patients had treatment interrupted for one dose, based on grade 1 ototoxicity. All 14 patients were assessed at 12 months. Between 12 and 18 months, one participant had treatment interrupted at 17 months due to hepatocellular carcinoma, one patient had dose interruption for 2 doses based on caregiver hardship and one patient had treatment interrupted for 1 dose for mastoiditis. 11 patients were assessed at 18 months. Between Dec 11, 2013, and June 25, 2014, three participants were assessed for eligibility and enrolled at RUMC, and were assigned to receive intrathecal HPβCD at a starting dose of 200 mg every 2 weeks (two patients), or 400 mg every two weeks (one patient). There were no dropouts in this group and all 3 patients were assessed at 18 months. Biomarker studies were consistent with improved neuronal cholesterol homoeostasis and decreased neuronal pathology. Post-drug plasma 24(S)-HC area under the curve (AUC8-72) values, an indicator of neuronal cholesterol homoeostasis, were significantly higher than post-saline plasma 24(S)-HC AUC8-72 after doses of 900 mg (p=0·0063) and 1200 mg (p=0·0037). CSF 24(S)-HC concentrations in three participants given either 600 or 900 mg of HPβCD were increased about two fold (p=0·0032) after drug administration. No drug-related serious adverse events were observed. Mid-frequency to high-frequency hearing loss, an expected adverse event, was documented in all participants. When managed with hearing aids, this did not have an appreciable effect on daily communication. The NNSS for the 14 participants treated monthly increased at a rate of 1·22, SEM 0·34 points per year compared with 2·92, SEM 0·27 points per year (p=0·0002) for the 21 patient comparison group. Decreased progression was observed for NNSS domains of ambulation (p=0·0622), cognition (p=0·0040) and speech (p=0·0423).
Patients with NPC1 treated with intrathecal HPβCD had slowed disease progression with an acceptable safety profile. These data support the initiation of a multinational, randomised, controlled trial of intrathecal HPβCD.

Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1) and NPC2 proteins are indispensable for the export of LDL-derived cholesterol from late endosomes. Mutations in these proteins result in Niemann-Pick type C disease, a lysosomal storage disease. Despite recent reports of the NPC1 structure depicting its overall architecture, the function of its C-terminal luminal domain (CTD) remains poorly understood even though 45% of NPC disease-causing mutations are in this domain. Here, we report a crystal structure at 3.3 Å resolution of NPC1* (residues 314-1,278), which-in contrast to previous lower resolution structures-features the entire CTD well resolved. Notably, all eight cysteines of the CTD form four disulfide bonds, one of which (C909-C914) enforces a specific loop that in turn mediates an interaction with a loop of the N-terminal domain (NTD). Importantly, this loop and its interaction with the NTD were not observed in any previous structures due to the lower resolution. Our mutagenesis experiments highlight the physiological relevance of the CTD-NTD interaction, which might function to keep the NTD in the proper orientation for receiving cholesterol from NPC2. Additionally, this structure allows us to more precisely map all of the disease-causing mutations, allowing future molecular insights into the pathogenesis of NPC disease.
Niemann-Pick disease type C1 (NPC1) is a rare progressive neurodegenerative disorder caused by mutations in the NPC1 gene, resulting mainly in the accumulation of cholesterol and the ganglioside GM2. Recently, we described accumulations of these lipids in neuronal differentiated cells derived from NPC1 patient-specific induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). As these lipids are essential for proper cell membrane composition, we were interested in the expression and function of voltage-gated ion channels and excitatory AMPA receptors (AMPARs) in neurons derived from three patient-specific iPSC lines. By means of patch clamp recordings and microfluorimetric measurements of calcium (Ca2+), we examined the expression of voltage-gated ion channels and AMPARs. Cells of the three used cell lines carrying the c.1836A&gt;C/c.1628delC, the c.1180T&gt;C or the c.3182T&gt;C mutation demonstrated a significantly reduced AMPA-induced Ca2+-influx, suggesting an altered expression profile of these receptors. RT-qPCR revealed a significant upregulation of mRNA for the AMPA receptor subunits GluA1 and GluA2 and western blot analysis showed increased protein level of GluA2. Thus, we conclude that the observed reduced Ca2+-influx is based on an increase of GluA2 containing Ca2+-impermeable AMPARs. An attenuated function of GluRs in neurons potentially contributes to the progressive neurodegeneration observed in NPC1 and might represent an objective in regard of the development of new therapeutic approaches in NPC1.
Studies of chromosomal rearrangements and fusion transcripts have elucidated mechanisms of tumorigenesis and led to targeted cancer therapies. This study was aimed at identifying novel fusion transcripts in esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC).
To identify new fusion transcripts associated with EAC, targeted RNA sequencing and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) verification were performed in 40 EACs and matched nonmalignant specimens from the same patients. Genomic PCR and Sanger sequencing were performed to find the breakpoint of fusion genes.
Five novel in-frame fusion transcripts were identified and verified in 40 EACs and in a validation cohort of 15 additional EACs (55 patients in all): fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (FGFR2)-GRB2-associated binding protein 2 (GAB2) in 2 of 55 or 3.6%, Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1)-maternal embryonic leucine zipper kinase (MELK) in 2 of 55 or 3.6%, ubiquitin-specific peptidase 54 (USP54)-calcium/calmodulin dependent protein kinase II γ (CAMK2G) in 2 of 55 or 3.6%, megakaryoblastic leukemia (translocation) 1 (MKL1)-fibulin 1 (FBLN1) in 1 of 55 or 1.8%, and CCR4-NOT transcription complex subunit 2 (CNOT2)-chromosome 12 open reading frame 49 (C12orf49) in 1 of 55 or 1.8%. A genomic analysis indicated that NPC1-MELK arose from a complex interchromosomal translocation event involving chromosomes 18, 3, and 9 with 3 rearrangement points, and this was consistent with chromoplexy.
These data indicate that fusion transcripts occur at a stable frequency in EAC. Furthermore, our results indicate that chromoplexy is an underlying mechanism that generates fusion transcripts in EAC. These and other fusion transcripts merit further study as diagnostic markers and potential therapeutic targets in EAC. Cancer 2017;123:3916-24. © 2017 American Cancer Society.
Methyl-β-cyclodextrin (MβCD) reduces lysosomal cholesterol accumulation in Niemann-Pick disease type C1 (NPC1) patient fibroblasts. However, the pharmacological activity of MβCD reported by different laboratories varies. To determine the potential causes of this variation, we analyzed the mass spectrum characteristics, pharmacological activity of three preparations of MβCDs, and the protein expression profiles of NPC1 patient fibroblasts after treatment with different sources of MβCDs. Our data revealed varied mass spectrum profiles and pharmacological activities on the reduction of lysosomal cholesterol accumulation in NPC1 fibroblasts for these three preparations of MβCDs obtained from different batches and different sources. Furthermore, a proteomic analysis showed the differences of these three MβCD preparations on amelioration of dysregulated protein expression levels in NPC1 cells. The results demonstrate the importance of prescreening of different cyclodextrin preparations before use as a therapeutic agent. A combination of mass spectrum analysis, measurement of pharmacological activity, and proteomic profiling provides an effective analytical procedure for characterization of cyclodextrins for therapeutic applications.
SREBP-2 activates transcription of all genes needed for cholesterol biosynthesis. To study SREBP-2 function in the intestine, we generated a mouse model (Vil-BP2-/- ) in which Cre recombinase ablates SREBP-2 in intestinal epithelia. Intestines of Vil-BP2-/- mice had reduced expression of genes required for sterol synthesis, in vivo sterol synthesis rates, and epithelial cholesterol contents. On a cholesterol-free diet, the mice displayed chronic enteropathy with histological abnormalities of both villi and crypts, growth restriction, and reduced survival that was prevented by supplementation of cholesterol in the diet. Likewise, SREBP-2-deficient enteroids required exogenous cholesterol for growth. Blockade of luminal cholesterol uptake into enterocytes with ezetimibe precipitated acutely lethal intestinal damage in Vil-BP2-/- mice, highlighting the critical interplay in the small intestine of sterol absorption via NPC1L1 and sterol synthesis via SREBP-2 in sustaining the intestinal mucosa. These data show that the small intestine requires SREBP-2 to drive cholesterol synthesis that sustains the intestinal epithelia when uptake of cholesterol from the gut lumen is not available, and provide a unique example of cholesterol auxotrophy expressed in an intact, adult mammal.
Niemann-Pick disease type C (NPC) is an autosomal recessive lipid storage disorder, and the majority of cases are caused by mutations in the NPC1 gene. In this study, we clarified how a single gene mutation in the NPC1 gene impacts the cellular glycome by analyzing the total glycomic expression profile of Chinese hamster ovary cell mutants defective in the Npc1 gene (Npc1 KO CHO cells). A number of glycomic alterations were identified, including increased expression of lactosylceramide, GM1, GM2, GD1, various neolacto-series glycosphingolipids, and sialyl-T (O-glycan), which was found to be the major sialylated protein-bound glycan, as well as various N-glycans, which were commonly both fucosylated and sialylated. We also observed significant increases in the total amounts of free oligosaccharides (fOSs), especially in the unique complex- and hybrid-type fOSs. Treatment of Npc1 KO CHO cells with 2-hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin (HPBCD), which can reduce cholesterol and glycosphingolipid (GSL) storage, did not affect the glycomic alterations observed in the GSL-, N-, and O-glycans of Npc1 KO CHO cells. However, HPBCD treatment corrected the glycomic alterations observed in fOSs to levels observed in wild-type cells.
The drug 2-hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin (HPβCD) reduces lysosomal cholesterol accumulation in Niemann-Pick disease, type C (NPC) and has been advanced to human clinical trials. However, its mechanism of action for reducing cholesterol accumulation in NPC cells is uncertain and its molecular target is unknown. We found that methyl-β-cyclodextrin (MβCD), a potent analog of HPβCD, restored impaired macroautophagy/autophagy flux in Niemann-Pick disease, type C1 (NPC1) cells. This effect was mediated by a direct activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), an upstream kinase in the autophagy pathway, through MβCD binding to its β-subunits. Knockdown of PRKAB1 or PRKAB2 (encoding the AMPK β1 or β2 subunit) expression and an AMPK inhibitor abolished MβCD-mediated reduction of cholesterol storage in NPC1 cells. The results demonstrate that AMPK is the molecular target of MβCD and its activation enhances autophagy flux, thereby mitigating cholesterol accumulation in NPC1 cells. The results identify AMPK as an attractive target for drug development to treat NPC.
Lipoprotein cholesterol is delivered to the limiting membrane of late endosomes/lysosomes (LELs) by Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1). However, the mechanism of cholesterol transport from LELs to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is poorly characterized. We report that oxysterol-binding protein-related protein 1L (ORP1L) is necessary for this stage of cholesterol export. CRISPR-mediated knockout of ORP1L in HeLa and HEK293 cells reduced esterification of cholesterol to the level in NPC1 knockout cells, and it increased the expression of sterol-regulated genes and de novo cholesterol synthesis, indicative of a block in cholesterol transport to the ER. In the absence of this transport pathway, cholesterol-enriched LELs accumulated in the Golgi/perinuclear region. Cholesterol delivery to the ER required the sterol-, phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate-, and vesicle-associated membrane protein-associated protein (VAP)-binding activities of ORP1L, as well as NPC1 expression. These results suggest that ORP1L-dependent membrane contacts between LELs and the ER coordinate cholesterol transfer with the retrograde movement of endo-lysosomal vesicles.
Niemann-Pick type C disease (NPC; OMIM #257220) is an inborn error of intracellular cholesterol trafficking. It is an autosomal recessive disorder caused predominantly by mutations in NPC1 Although characterized as a progressive neurological disorder, it can also cause cholestasis and liver dysfunction because of intrahepatocyte lipid accumulation. We report a 7-wk-old infant who was admitted with neonatal cholestasis, and who was diagnosed with a novel homozygous stop-gain variant in NPC1 by rapid whole-genome sequencing (WGS). WGS results were obtained 16 d before return of the standard clinical genetic test results and prompted initiation of targeted therapy.
In vivo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was used to investigate regional and global brain atrophy in the neurodegenerative Niemann Pick Type C1 (NPC1) disease mouse model. Imaging experiments were conducted with the most commonly studied mouse model of NPC1 disease at early and late disease states. High-resolution in vivo images were acquired at early and late stages of the disease and analyzed with atlas-based registration to obtain measurements of twenty brain region volumes. A two-way ANOVA analysis indicated eighteen of these regions were different due to genotype and thirteen showed a significant interaction with age and genotype. The ability to measure in vivo neurodegeneration evidenced by brain atrophy adds to the ability to monitor disease progression and treatment response in the mouse model.
A genome-wide association study (GWAS) reported that common variation in the human Niemann-Pick C1 gene (NPC1) is associated with morbid adult obesity. This study was confirmed using our BALB/cJ Npc1 mouse model, whereby heterozygous mice (Npc1+/- ) with decreased gene dosage were susceptible to weight gain when fed a high-fat diet (HFD) compared with homozygous normal mice (Npc1+/+ ) fed the same diet. The objective for our current study was to validate this Npc1 gene-diet interaction using statistical modeling with fitted growth trajectories, conduct body weight analyses for different measures, and define the physiological basis responsible for weight gain. Metabolic phenotype analysis indicated no significant difference between Npc1+/+ and Npc1+/- mice fed a HFD for food and water intake, oxygen consumption, carbon dioxide production, locomotor activity, adaptive thermogenesis, and intestinal lipid absorption. However, the livers from Npc1+/- mice had significantly increased amounts of mature sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1 (SREBP-1) and increased expression of SREBP-1 target genes that regulate glycolysis and lipogenesis with an accumulation of triacylglycerol and cholesterol. Moreover, white adipose tissue from Npc1+/- mice had significantly decreased amounts of phosphorylated hormone-sensitive lipase with decreased triacylglycerol lipolysis. Consistent with these results, cellular energy metabolism studies indicated that Npc1+/- fibroblasts had significantly increased glycolysis and lipogenesis, in addition to significantly decreased substrate (glucose and endogenous fatty acid) oxidative metabolism with an accumulation of triacylglycerol and cholesterol. In conclusion, these studies demonstrate that the Npc1 gene interacts with a HFD to promote weight gain through differential regulation of central energy metabolism pathways.
Owing to the extreme virulence and case fatality rate of ebola virus disease (EVD), there had been so much furore, panic and public health emergency about the possible pandemic from the recent West African outbreak of the disease, with attendant handful research, both in the past and most recently. The magnitude of the epidemic of ebola virus disease has prompted global interest and urgency in the discovery of measures to mitigate the impact of the disease. Researchers in the academia and the industry were pressured to only focus on the development of effective and safe ebola virus vaccines, without consideration of the other aspects to this virus, which may influence the success or otherwise of a potential vaccine. The objective of this review was to adopt the SWOT concept to elucidate the biological Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats to Ebola virus as a pathogen, with a view to understanding and devising holistic strategies at combating and overcoming the scourge of EVD.
This systematic review and narrative synthesis utilized Medline, PubMed, Google and other databases to select about 150 publications on ebola and ebola virus disease using text word searches to generate the specific terms. Relevant publications were reviewed and compared, findings were synthesized using a narrative method and summarized qualitatively.
Some of the identified strengths of ebola virus include: Ebola virus is an RNA virus with inherent capability to mutate, reassort and recombine to generate mutant or reassortant virulent strains; Ebola virus has a broad cellular tropism; Natural Reservoir of ebola virus is unconfirmed but fruit bats, arthropods, and plants are hypothesized; Ebola virus primarily targets and selectively destroys the immune system; Ebola viruses possess accessory proteins that inhibits the host' immune responses; Secreted glycoprotein (sGP), a truncated soluble protein that triggers immune activation and increased vascular permeability is uniquely associated with Ebola virus only; Ability to effectively cross the species barrier and establish productive infection in humans, non human primates, and other mammals; Ebola virus attacks every part of the human body; The Weaknesses include: Ebola virus transmission and persistence is severely limited by its virulence; Ebola virus essentially requires host encoded protein Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1) for host's cell' entry; Ebola virus essentially requires host encoded proteins (TIM-1) for cell' entry; Relative abundance of Ebolavirus Nucleoprotein than the other virion components; The Opportunities harnessed by ebola virus include: Lack of infection control practices in African health-care facilities and paucity of health infrastructures, especially in the endemic zones; Permissiveness of circulating Monocytes, Macrophages and dendritic cells in virus mobilization and dissemination; Collection, consumption and trade of wild games (bushmeats); Pertubation and drastic changes in forest ecosystems present opportunities for Ebola virus; Use of dogs in hunting predisposes man and animals to inter-species contact; Poverty, malnutrition, crowding, social disorder, mobility and political instability; Ease of travel and aviation as potentials for global spread; Possible mechanical transmission by arthropod vectors; No vaccines or therapeutics are yet approved for human treatment; The Threats to ebola virus include: Avoidance of direct contact with infected blood and other bodily fluids of infected patient; Appropriate and correct burial practices; Adoption of barrier Nursing; Improved surveillance to prevent potential spread of epidemic; Making Available Rapid laboratory equipment and procedures for prompt detection (ELISA, Western Blot, PCR); Sterilization or disinfection of equipment and safe disposal of instrument; Prompt hospitalization, isolation and quarantine of infected individual; Active contact tracing and monitoring, among others.
The identified capacities and gaps presented in this study are inexhaustive framework to combat the ebola virus. To undermine and overcome the virus, focus should be aimed at strategically decreasing the identified strengths and opportunities, while increasing on the weaknesses of, and threats to the virus.
Niemann-Pick disease type C is a fatal, progressive neurodegenerative disease mostly caused by mutations in Nieamnn-Pick type C1 (NPC1), a late endosomal membrane protein that is essential for intracellular cholesterol transport. The most prevalent mutation, I1061T (Ile to Thr), interferes with the protein folding process. Consequently, mutated but intrinsically functional NPC1 proteins are prematurely degraded via proteasome, leading to loss of NPC1 function. Previously, we reported sterol derivatives as pharmacological chaperones for NPC1, and showed that these derivatives can normalize folding-defective phenotypes of I1061T NPC1 mutant by directly binding to, and stabilizing, the protein. Here, we report a series of compounds containing a phenanthridin-6-one scaffold as the first class of non-steroidal pharmacological chaperones for NPC1. We also examined their structure-activity relationships.
A more thorough understanding of the immunological interactions between Fasciola spp. and their hosts is required if we are to develop new immunotherapies to control fasciolosis. Deeper knowledge of the antigens that are the target of the acquired immune responses of definitive hosts against both Fasciola hepatica and Fasciola gigantica will potentially identify candidate vaccine antigens. Indonesian Thin Tail sheep express a high level of acquired immunity to infection by F. gigantica within 4weeks of infection and antibodies in Indonesian Thin Tail sera can promote antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity against the surface tegument of juvenile F. gigantica in vitro. Given the high protein sequence similarity between F. hepatica and F. gigantica, we hypothesised that antibody from F. gigantica-infected sheep could be used to identify the orthologous proteins in the tegument of F. hepatica. Purified IgG from the sera of F. gigantica-infected Indonesian Thin Tail sheep collected pre-infection and 4weeks p.i. were incubated with live adult F. hepatica ex vivo and the immunosloughate (immunoprecipitate) formed was isolated and analysed via liquid chromatography-electrospray ionisation-tandem mass spectrometry to identify proteins involved in the immune response. A total of 38 proteins were identified at a significantly higher abundance in the immunosloughate using week 4 IgG, including eight predicted membrane proteins, 20 secreted proteins, nine proteins predicted to be associated with either the lysosomes, the cytoplasm or the cytoskeleton and one protein with an unknown cellular localization. Three of the membrane proteins are transporters including a multidrug resistance protein, an amino acid permease and a glucose transporter. Interestingly, a total of 21 of the 38 proteins matched with proteins recently reported to be associated with the proposed small exosome-like extracellular vesicles of adult F. hepatica, suggesting that the Indonesian Thin Tail week 4 IgG is either recognising individual proteins released from extracellular vesicles or is immunoprecipitating intact exosome-like extracellular vesicles. Five extracellular vesicle membrane proteins were identified including two proteins predicted to be associated with vesicle transport/ exocytosis (VPS4, vacuolar protein sorting-associated protein 4b and the Niemann-Pick C1 protein). RNAseq analysis of the developmental transcription of the 38 immunosloughate proteins showed that the sequences are expressed over a wide abundance range with 21/38 transcripts expressed at a relatively high level from metacercariae to the adult life cycle stage. A notable feature of the immunosloughates was the absence of cytosolic proteins which have been reported to be secreted markers for damage to adult flukes incubated in vitro, suggesting that the proteins observed are not inadvertent contaminants leaking from damaged flukes ex vivo. The identification of tegument protein antigens shared between F. gigantica and F. hepatica is beneficial in terms of the possible development of a dual purpose vaccine effective against both fluke species.
Niemann-Pick disease type C1 (NPC1) is a fatal neurovisceral lysosomal lipid storage disorder. The mutation of the NPC1 protein affects the homeostasis and transport of cholesterol and glycosphingolipids from late endosomes/lysosomes to the endoplasmic reticulum resulting in progressive neurodegeneration. Since olfactory impairment is one of the earliest symptoms in many neurodegenerative disorders, we focused on alterations of the olfactory epithelium in an NPC1 mouse model. Previous findings revealed severe morphological and immunohistochemical alterations in the olfactory system of NPC1-/- mutant mice compared with healthy controls (NPC1+/+). Based on immunohistochemical evaluation of the olfactory epithelium, we analyzed the impact of neurodegeneration in the olfactory epithelium of NPC1-/- mice and observed considerable loss of mature olfactory receptor neurons as well as an increased number of proliferating and apoptotic cells. Additionally, after administration of two different therapy approaches using either a combination of miglustat, 2-hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin (HPβCD) and allopregnanolone or a monotherapy with HPβCD, we recorded a remarkable reduction of morphological damages in NPC1-/- mice and an up to four-fold increase of proliferating cells within the olfactory epithelium. Numbers of mature olfactory receptor neurons doubled after both therapy approaches. Interestingly, we also observed therapy-induced alterations in treated NPC1+/+ controls. Thus, olfactory testing may provide useful information to monitor pharmacologic treatment approaches in human NPC1.
The Niemann-Pick type C1 (NPC1) disease is a neurodegenerative lysosomal storage disorder due to mutations in the NPC1 gene, encoding a transmembrane protein related to the Sonic hedgehog (Shh) receptor, Patched, and involved in intracellular trafficking of cholesterol. We have recently found that the proliferation of cerebellar granule neuron precursors is significantly reduced in Npc1-/- mice due to the downregulation of Shh expression. This finding prompted us to analyze the formation of the primary cilium, a non-motile organelle that is specialized for Shh signal transduction and responsible, when defective, for several human genetic disorders. In this study, we show that the expression and subcellular localization of Shh effectors and ciliary proteins are severely disturbed in Npc1-deficient mice. The dysregulation of Shh signaling is associated with a shortening of the primary cilium length and with a reduction of the fraction of ciliated cells in Npc1-deficient mouse brains and the human fibroblasts of NPC1 patients. These defects are prevented by treatment with 2-hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin, a promising therapy currently under clinical investigation. Our findings indicate that defective Shh signaling is responsible for abnormal morphogenesis of the cerebellum of Npc1-deficient mice and show, for the first time, that the formation of the primary cilium is altered in NPC1 disease.
Cardiovascular morbidity and mortality are of increasing concern, not only to patients but also to the health care profession and service providers. The preventative benefit of treatment of dyslipidaemia is unquestioned but there is a large, so far unmet need to improve clinical outcome. There are exciting new discoveries of targets that may translate into improved clinical outcome. Areas covered: This review highlights some new pathways in cholesterol and triglyceride metabolism and examines new targets, new drugs and new molecules. The review includes the results of recent trials of relatively new drugs that have shown benefit in cardiovascular endpoint outcomes, drugs that have been licenced without endpoint trials yet available and new drugs that have not yet been licenced but have produced exciting results in animal studies and some in early phase 2 human studies. Expert opinion: The new areas that have been discovered as the cause of dyslipidaemia have opened up a host of new targets for new drugs including antisense RNA's, microRNA's and human monoclonal antibodies. The plethora of new targets and new drugs has made it an extraordinarily exciting time in the development of therapeutics to combat atherosclerosis.
Leishmania spp. are protozoan parasites that are transmitted by sandfly vectors during blood sucking to vertebrate hosts and cause a spectrum of diseases called leishmaniases. It has been demonstrated that host cholesterol plays an important role during Leishmania infection. Nevertheless, little is known about the intracellular distribution of this lipid early after internalization of the parasite. Here, pulse-chase experiments with radiolabeled cholesteryl esterified to fatty acids bound to low-density lipoproteins indicated that retention of this source of cholesterol is increased in parasite-containing subcellular fractions, while uptake is unaffected. This is correlated with a reduction or absence of detectable NPC1 (Niemann-Pick disease, type C1), a protein responsible for cholesterol efflux from endocytic compartments, in the Leishmania mexicana habitat and infected cells. Filipin staining revealed a halo around parasites within parasitophorous vacuoles (PV) likely representing free cholesterol accumulation. Labeling of host cell membranous cholesterol by fluorescent cholesterol species before infection revealed that this pool is also trafficked to the PV but becomes incorporated into the parasites' membranes and seems not to contribute to the halo detected by filipin. This cholesterol sequestration happened early after infection and was functionally significant as it correlated with the upregulation of mRNA-encoding proteins required for cholesterol biosynthesis. Thus, sequestration of cholesterol by Leishmania amastigotes early after infection provides a basis to understand perturbation of cholesterol-dependent processes in macrophages that were shown previously by others to be necessary for their proper function in innate and adaptive immune responses.
The mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) protein kinase is a master growth regulator that becomes activated at the lysosome in response to nutrient cues. Here, we identify cholesterol, an essential building block for cellular growth, as a nutrient input that drives mTORC1 recruitment and activation at the lysosomal surface. The lysosomal transmembrane protein, SLC38A9, is required for mTORC1 activation by cholesterol through conserved cholesterol-responsive motifs. Moreover, SLC38A9 enables mTORC1 activation by cholesterol independently from its arginine-sensing function. Conversely, the Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1) protein, which regulates cholesterol export from the lysosome, binds to SLC38A9 and inhibits mTORC1 signaling through its sterol transport function. Thus, lysosomal cholesterol drives mTORC1 activation and growth signaling through the SLC38A9-NPC1 complex.
Both cholesterol and α-tocopherol are essential lipophilic nutrients for humans and animals. Although cholesterol in excess causes severe problems such as coronary heart disease, it is a necessary component of cell membranes and is the precursor for the biosynthesis of steroid hormones and bile acids. Niemann-Pick C1-like 1 (NPC1L1) is a cholesterol transporter that is highly expressed in the small intestine and liver in humans and plays an important role in cholesterol homeostasis. Cholesterol promotes NPC1L1 endocytosis, which is an early step in cholesterol uptake. Furthermore, α-tocopherol is the most active form of vitamin E, and sufficient amounts of vitamin E are critical for health. It has been reported that NPC1L1 mediates α-tocopherol absorption; however, the mechanisms underlying this process are unknown. In this study, we found that treatment of cells that stably express NPC1L1-GFP with α-tocopherol promotes NPC1L1 endocytosis, and the NPC1L1 inhibitor, ezetimibe, efficiently prevents the α-tocopherol-induced endocytosis of NPC1L1. Cholesterol binding to the N-terminal domain (NTD) of NPC1L1 (NPC1L1-NTD) is essential for NPC1L1-mediated cholesterol absorption. We found that α-tocopherol competitively binds NPC1L1-NTD with cholesterol. Furthermore, when cells stably expressed NPC1L1ΔNTD-GFP, α-tocopherol could not induce the endocytosis of NPC1L1ΔNTD. Taken together, these results demonstrate that NPC1L1 recognizes α-tocopherol via its NTD and mediates α-tocopherol uptake through the same mechanism as cholesterol absorption.
MLN64 is a late endosomal cholesterol-binding membrane protein that has been implicated in cholesterol transport from endosomal membranes to the plasma membrane and/or mitochondria, in toxin-induced resistance, and in mitochondrial dysfunction. Down-regulation of MLN64 in Niemann-Pick C1 deficient cells decreased mitochondrial cholesterol content, suggesting that MLN64 functions independently of NPC1. However, the role of MLN64 in the maintenance of endosomal cholesterol flow and intracellular cholesterol homeostasis remains unclear. We have previously described that hepatic MLN64 overexpression increases liver cholesterol content and induces liver damage. Here, we studied the function of MLN64 in normal and NPC1-deficient cells and we evaluated whether MLN64 overexpressing cells exhibit alterations in mitochondrial function. We used recombinant-adenovirus-mediated MLN64 gene transfer to overexpress MLN64 in mouse liver and hepatic cells; and RNA interference to down-regulate MLN64 in NPC1-deficient cells. In MLN64-overexpressing cells, we found increased mitochondrial cholesterol content and decreased glutathione (GSH) levels and ATPase activity. Furthermore, we found decreased mitochondrial membrane potential and mitochondrial fragmentation and increased mitochondrial superoxide levels in MLN64-overexpressing cells and in NPC1-deficient cells. Consequently, MLN64 expression was increased in NPC1-deficient cells and reduction of its expression restore mitochondrial membrane potential and mitochondrial superoxide levels. Our findings suggest that MLN64 overexpression induces an increase in mitochondrial cholesterol content and consequently a decrease in mitochondrial GSH content leading to mitochondrial dysfunction. In addition, we demonstrate that MLN64 expression is increased in NPC cells and plays a key role in cholesterol transport into the mitochondria.
Niemann-Pick C1 like-1 (NPC1L1) mediates cholesterol absorption at the apical membrane of enterocytes through a yet unknown mechanism. Bean, pea, and lentil proteins are naturally hydrolyzed during digestion to produce peptides. The potential for pulse peptides to have high binding affinities for NPC1L1 has not been determined. In this study , in silico binding affinities and interactions were determined between the N-terminal domain of NPC1L1 and 14 pulse peptides (5≥ amino acids) derived through pepsin-pancreatin digestion. Peptides were docked in triplicate to the N-terminal domain using docking program AutoDock Vina, and results were compared to those of ezetimibe, a prescribed NPC1L1 inhibitor. Three black bean peptides (-7.2 to -7.0kcal/mol) and the cowpea bean dipeptide Lys-Asp (-7.0kcal/mol) had higher binding affinities than ezetimibe (-6.6kcal/mol) for the N-terminal domain of NPC1L1. Lentil and pea peptides studied did not have high binding affinities. The common bean peptide Tyr-Ala-Ala-Ala-Thr (-7.2kcal/mol), which can be produced from black or navy bean proteins, had the highest binding affinity. Ezetimibe and peptides with high binding affinities for the N-terminal domain are expected to interact at different locations of the N-terminal domain. All high affinity black bean peptides are expected to have van der Waals interactions with SER130, PHE136, and LEU236 and a conventional hydrogen bond with GLU238 of NPC1L1. Due to their high affinity for the N-terminal domain of NPC1L1, black and cowpea bean peptides produced in the digestive track have the potential to disrupt interactions between NPC1L1 and membrane proteins that lead to cholesterol absorption.
Ebola virus (EBOV) infection is characterized by sporadic outbreaks caused by zoonotic transmission. Fixed changes in amino acid sequence, such as A82V in the EBOV glycoprotein (GP) that occurred early in the 2013-16 epidemic, are suspected to confer a selective advantage to the virus. We used biochemical assays of GP function to show that A82V, as well as a polymorphism in residue 544 identified in other outbreaks, enhances infection by decreasing the threshold for activation of membrane fusion activity triggered by the host factors cathepsin B and Niemann-Pick C1. Importantly, the increase in infectivity comes with the cost of decreased virus stability. Thus, emergence of a virus GP with altered properties that can affect transmission and virulence may have contributed to the severity and scope of the 2013-16 EBOV epidemic.
The Ebola virus is a zoonotic pathogen that can cause severe hemorrhagic fever in humans, with up to 90% lethality. The deadly 2014 Ebola outbreak quickly made an unprecedented impact on human lives. While several vaccines and therapeutics are under development, current approaches contain several limitations, such as virus mutational escape, need for formulation or refrigeration, poor scalability, long lead-time, and high cost. To address these challenges, we developed locked nucleic acid (LNA)-modified antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) to target critical Ebola viral proteins and the human intracellular host protein Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1), required for viral entry into infected cells. We generated noninfectious viral luciferase reporter assays to identify LNA ASOs that inhibit translation of Ebola viral proteins in vitro and in human cells. We demonstrated specific inhibition of key Ebola genes VP24 and nucleoprotein, which inhibit a proper immune response and promote Ebola virus replication, respectively. We also identified LNA ASOs targeting human host factor NPC1 and demonstrated reduced infection by chimeric vesicular stomatitis virus harboring the Ebola glycoprotein, which directly binds to NPC1 for viral infection. These results support further in vivo testing of LNA ASOs in infectious Ebola virus disease animal models as potential therapeutic modalities for treatment of Ebola.
Cholesterol plays a key role in membrane protein function and signaling in endothelial cells. Thus, disturbing cholesterol trafficking is an effective approach for inhibiting angiogenesis. We recently identified astemizole (AST), an antihistamine drug, as a cholesterol trafficking inhibitor from a phenotypic screen. In this study, we found that AST induced cholesterol accumulation in the lysosome by binding to the sterol-sensing domain of Niemann-Pick disease, type C1 (NPC1), a lysosomal surface protein responsible for cholesterol transport. Inhibition of cholesterol trafficking by AST led to the depletion of membrane cholesterol, causing SREBP1 nuclear localization. The depletion of membrane cholesterol resulted in dissociation of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) from the lysosomal surface and inactivation of mTOR signaling. These effects were effectively rescued by addition of exogenous cholesterol. AST inhibited endothelial cell proliferation, migration and tube formation in a cholesterol-dependent manner. Furthermore, AST inhibited zebrafish angiogenesis in a cholesterol-dependent manner. Together, our data suggest that AST is a new class of NPC1 antagonist that inhibits cholesterol trafficking in endothelial cells and angiogenesis.
Niemann-Pick disease type C (NPC) is a lysosomal storage disorder caused by mutations in either NPC-1 or NPC-2 genes, resulting in abnormal intracellular cholesterol trafficking. The estimated prevalence of NPC disease is 1: 120,000-150,000. Lung involvement has been described in only few patients with NPC, mostly NPC2. We describe a series of 12 patients, originating from six families all homozygotes to the p.R404Q (c.1211G &gt; A) mutation of NPC1 gene; nine of them had significant pulmonary manifestations. All patients were followed in our medical center. Nine of the patients had pulmonary involvement, with recurrent pneumonia as the first manifestation in most, followed by recurrent wheezing episodes and subsequent development of interstitial lung disease with chronic need for oxygen support. Seven patients were reported of having interstitial disease by various imaging modalities.Conclusion: Pulmonary involvement in NPC1 is more common than previously reported. It is characterized as primary obstructive and restrictive lung disease and not only as part of neurologic sequel of NPC. It can lead to respiratory insufficiency and death from respiratory failure. What is Known: • Lung involvement has been described in only few patients with NPC. • Most reported NPC cases with pulmonary involvement were of NPC2. What is New: • Pulmonary involvement in NPC1 is more common than previously reported. • Pulmonary involvement in NPC1 should be considered as part of the disease and be thoroughly assessed and managed.
Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1) is a polytopic membrane protein with 13 transmembrane helices that exports LDL-derived cholesterol from lysosomes by carrying it through the 80 Å glycocalyx and the 40 Å lipid bilayer. Transport begins when cholesterol binds to the N-terminal domain (NTD) of NPC1, which projects to the surface of the glycocalyx. Here, we reconstitute cholesterol transport by expressing the NTD as a fragment separate from the remaining portion of NPC1. When co-expressed, the two NPC1 fragments reconstitute cholesterol transport, indicating that the NTD has the flexibility to interact with the remaining parts of NPC1 even when not covalently linked. We also show that cholesterol can be transferred from the NTD of one full-length NPC1 to another NPC1 molecule that lacks the NTD. These data support the hypothesis that cholesterol is transported through interactions between two or more NPC1 molecules.
Hedgehog (HH) signalling governs embryogenesis and adult tissue homeostasis in mammals and other multicellular organisms1-3. Whereas deficient HH signalling leads to birth defects, unrestrained HH signalling is implicated in human cancers2,4-6. N-terminally palmitoylated HH releases the repression of Patched to the oncoprotein smoothened (SMO); however, the mechanism by which HH recognizes Patched is unclear. Here we report cryo-electron microscopy structures of human patched 1 (PTCH1) alone and in complex with the N-terminal domain of 'native' sonic hedgehog (native SHH-N has both a C-terminal cholesterol and an N-terminal fatty-acid modification), at resolutions of 3.5 Å and 3.8 Å, respectively. The structure of PTCH1 has internal two-fold pseudosymmetry in the transmembrane core, which features a sterol-sensing domain and two homologous extracellular domains, resembling the architecture of Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1) protein7. The palmitoylated N terminus of SHH-N inserts into a cavity between the extracellular domains of PTCH1 and dominates the PTCH1-SHH-N interface, which is distinct from that reported for SHH-N co-receptors8. Our biochemical assays show that SHH-N may use another interface, one that is required for its co-receptor binding, to recruit PTCH1 in the absence of a covalently attached palmitate. Our work provides atomic insights into the recognition of the N-terminal domain of HH (HH-N) by PTCH1, offers a structural basis for cooperative binding of HH-N to various receptors and serves as a molecular framework for HH signalling and its malfunction in disease.
Transforming growth factor β induced factor homeobox 1 (TGIF1) is a transcriptional repressor that limits the response to transforming growth factor ß signaling and also represses transcription independent of this pathway. Recently, we found higher serum cholesterol levels and more hepatic lipid accumulation in mice lacking Tgif1, and showed that TGIF1 can repress the expression of Soat2, the gene encoding the cholesterol esterifying enzyme acyl-Coenzyme A:cholesterol acyltransferase 2. Although there is evidence that TGIF1 plays a role in lipid metabolism, its role in this metabolic pathway is not fully characterized. Here we investigate whether overexpression of TGIF1 affects intestinal cholesterol absorption.
TGIF1 was found to repress human and mouse Niemann-Pick C1 like 1 (Npc1l1) promoter activity in intestinal Caco2 cells. We also found TGIF1 to be able to oppose the induction of the promoter activity by sterol regulatory element binding protein 2 and hepatocyte nuclear factor 1α and 4α. To validate these effects of TGIF1 in vivo, we generated transgenic mice specifically overexpressing TGIF1 in the intestine (Villin-Tgif1). We observed lower intestinal expression levels of Npc1l1 that was associated with lower expression of ATP-binding cassette transporter (Abc) a1, Abcg5, and Abcg8. Villin-Tgif1 mice fed regular chow or a high-fat diet had lower levels of markers of intestinal cholesterol absorption than wild types.
We suggest TGIF1 as a new player in intestinal cholesterol metabolism.
Niemann-Pick type C1 (NPC1) disease is a lysosomal storage disorder caused by mutation of Npc1 or Npc2 gene, resulting in various progressive pathological features. Myelin defection is a major pathological problem in Npc1 mutant mice; however, impairment of myelin proteins in the developing brain is still incompletely understood. In this study, we showed that the expression of myelin genes and proteins is strongly inhibited from postnatal day 35 onwards including reduced myelin basic protein (MBP) expression in the brain. Furthermore, myelination characterized by MBP immunohistochemistry was strongly perturbed in the forebrain, moderately in the midbrain and cerebellum, and slightly in the hindbrain. Our results demonstrate that mutation of the Npc1 gene is sufficient to cause severe and progressive defects in myelination in the mouse brain.
Niemann-Pick type C disease (NP-C) is a fatal neurodegenerative lysosomal storage disorder. It is caused in 95% of cases by a mutation in the NPC1 gene that encodes NPC1, an integral transmembrane protein localized to the limiting membrane of the lysosome. There is no cure for NP-C but there is a disease-modifying drug (miglustat) that slows disease progression but with associated side effects. Here, we demonstrate in a well-characterized mouse model of NP-C that a single administration of AAV-mediated gene therapy to the brain can significantly extend lifespan, improve quality of life, prevent or ameliorate neurodegeneration, reduce biochemical pathology and normalize or improve various indices of motor function. Over-expression of human NPC1 does not cause adverse effects in the brain and correctly localizes to late endosomal/lysosomal compartments. Furthermore, we directly compare gene therapy to licensed miglustat. Even at a low dose, gene therapy has all the benefits of miglustat but without adverse effects. On the basis of these findings and on-going ascendency of the field, we propose intracerebroventricular gene therapy as a potential therapeutic option for clinical use in NP-C.
Autophagy activation exerts neuroprotective effects in the ischemic stroke model. Ezetimibe (Eze), a Niemann-Pick disease type C1-Like 1 (NPC1L1) pharmacological inhibitor, has been reported to protect hepatocytes from apoptosis via autophagy activation. In this study, we explored whether Eze could attenuate neuronal apoptosis in the rat model of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO), specifically via activation of the AMPK/ULK1/autophagy pathway. Two hundred and one male Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to transient MCAO followed by reperfusion. Eze was administered 1 h after MCAO. To elucidate the underlying molecular mechanism, Dorsomorphin, a selective AMPK inhibitor, and 3-methyladenine (3-MA), an autophagy inhibitor, were injected intracerebroventricularly before MCAO. Infarct volume, neurological score, brain cholesterol levels, immunofluorescence staining, Western blot, and Fluoro-Jade C (FJC) staining were used to evaluate the effects of Eze. The endogenous NPC1L1 expression increased and mainly expressed in neurons after MCAO. Intranasal administration of Eze reduced brain infarct volume at 24 and 72 h after MCAO, with improved short and long-term neurological functions after MCAO. Eze reduced brain cholesterol levels (total cholesterol, free cholesterol and cholesteryl esters) and the number of FJC-positive neurons. The expression of phosphorylated AMPK (p-AMPK) and downstream ULK1, Beclin1, LC3BII, Bcl-2, and Bcl-xl increased, while P62 and proapoptotic Bax decreased after treatment with Eze. Pretreatment with Dorsomorphin and 3-MA reversed the beneficial effects of Eze. These findings suggest that intranasal administration of Eze plays neuroprotective role through autophagy activation after MCAO in rats. Lowered cholesterol levels and AMPK activation may act in conjunction to induce autophagy after treatment with Eze. Eze merits further investigation as a potential therapeutic agent in ischemic stroke patients.
Gallstone disease is related to hypersecretion of cholesterol in bile, and low serum phytosterol levels. We examined how genetic polymorphisms of sterol transporters affect childhood cholesterol metabolism trait predicting adult gallstone disease.
In retrospective controlled study, we determined D19H polymorphism of ABCG8 gene, genetic variation at Niemann-Pick C1-like 1 (NPC1L1) gene locus (rs41279633, rs17655652, rs2072183, rs217434 and rs2073548), and serum cholesterol, noncholesterol sterols and lipids in children affected by gallstones decades later (n = 66) and controls (n = 126).
In childhood, phytosterols were lower (9.7%-23.4%) in carriers of risk allele 19H compared to 19D homozygotes. Lowest campesterol/cholesterol tertile consisted of 1.9-times more future gallstone subjects, and 3.7-times more 19H carriers than highest one. Campesterol/cholesterol-ratio was highest in 19D homozygote controls, but ∼11% lower in gallstone 19D homozygotes and ∼25% lower among gallstone and control carriers of 19H. Gallstone subjects with alleles CC of rs41279633 and TT of rs217434 of NPC1L1 had ∼18% lower campesterol/cholesterol-ratio compared to mutation carriers.
Risk trait of cholesterol metabolism (low phytosterols) in childhood favouring cholesterol gallstone disease later in adulthood is influenced by risk variant 19H of ABCG8 and obviously also other factors. NPC1L1 variants have minor influence on noncholesterol sterols.
In the present study we aimed to evaluate the potential of in vivo inhibition of miR-486 and miR-92a to reverse hyperlipidemia, then to identify and validate their lipid metabolism-related target genes. Male Golden-Syrian hamsters fed a hyperlipidemic (HL) diet (standard chow plus 3% cholesterol and 15% butter, 10 weeks) were injected subcutaneously with lock-nucleic acid inhibitors for either miR-486 or miR-92a. Lipids and miRNAs levels in liver and plasma, and hepatic expression of miRNAs target genes were assessed in all HL hamsters. MiR-486 and miR-92a target genes were identified by miRWalk analysis and validated by 3'UTR cloning in pmirGLO vectors. HL hamsters had increased liver (2.8-fold) and plasma (twofold) miR-486 levels, and increased miR-92a (2.8-fold and 1.8-fold, respectively) compared to normolipidemic hamsters. After 2 weeks treatment, liver and plasma cholesterol levels decreased (23 and 17.5% for anti-miR-486, 16 and 22% for miR-92a inhibition). Hepatic triglycerides and non-esterified fatty acids content decreased also significantly. Bioinformatics analysis and 3'UTR cloning in pmirGLO vector showed that sterol O-acyltransferase-2 (SOAT2) and sterol-regulatory element binding transcription factor-1 (SREBF1) are targeted by miR-486, while ATP-binding cassette G4 (ABCG4) and Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1) by miR-92a. In HL livers and in cultured HepG2 cells, miR-486 inhibition restored the levels of SOAT2 and SREBF1 expression, while anti-miR-92a restored ABCG4, NPC1 and SOAT2 expression compared to scrambled-treated HL hamsters or cultured cells. In vivo inhibition of miR-486 and miR-92a could be a useful and valuable new approach to correct lipid metabolism dysregulation.
Ebola virus (EBOV) causes fatal hemorrhagic fever with high death rates in human. Currently, there are no available clinically-approved prophylactic or therapeutic treatments. The recently solved crystal structure of cleavage-primed EBOV glycoprotein (GPcl) in complex with the C domain of endosomal protein Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1) provides a new target for the development of EBOV entry inhibitors. In this work, a computational approach using docking and molecular dynamic simulations is carried out for the rational design of peptide inhibitors. A novel cyclo-peptide (Pep-3.3) was identified to target at the late stage of EBOV entry and exhibit specific inhibitory activity against EBOV-GP pseudotyped viruses, with 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 5.1 μM. In vitro binding assay and molecular simulations revealed that Pep-3.3 binds to GPcl with a KD value of 69.7 μM, through interacting with predicted residues in the hydrophobic binding pocket of GPcl. Mutation of predicted residues T83 caused resistance to Pep-3.3 inhibition in viral infectivity, providing preliminary support for the model of the peptide binding to GPcl. This study demonstrates the feasibility of inhibiting EBOV entry by targeting GPcl with peptides.
Diapause is a natural phenomenon characterized by an arrest in development that ensures the survival of organisms under extreme environmental conditions. The process has been well documented in arthropods. However, its molecular basis has been mainly studied in species from temperate zones, leaving a knowledge gap of this phenomenon in tropical species. In the present study, the Neotropical and solitary bee Tetrapedia diversipes was employed as a model for investigating diapause in species from tropical zones. Being a bivoltine insect, Tetrapedia diversipes produce two generations of offspring per year. The first generation, normally born during the wet season, develops faster than individuals from the second generation, born after the dry season. Furthermore, it has been shown that the development of the progeny, of the second generation, is halted at the 5th larval instar, and remains in larval diapause during the dry season. Towards the goal of gaining a better understanding of the diapause phenomenon we compared the global gene expression pattern, in larvae, from both reproductive generations and during diapause. The results demonstrate that there are similarities in the observed gene expression patterns to those already described for temperate climate models, and also identify diapause-related genes that have not been previously reported in the literature.
The RNA-Seq analysis identified 2275 differentially expressed transcripts, of which 1167 were annotated. Of these genes, during diapause, 352 were upregulated and 815 were downregulated. According to their biological functions, these genes were categorized into the following groups: cellular detoxification, cytoskeleton, cuticle, sterol and lipid metabolism, cell cycle, heat shock proteins, immune response, circadian clock, and epigenetic control.
Many of the identified genes have already been described as being related to diapause; however, new genes were discovered, for the first time, in this study. Among those, we highlight: Niemann-Pick type C1, NPC2 and Acyl-CoA binding protein homolog (all involved in ecdysteroid synthesis); RhoBTB2 and SASH1 (associated with cell cycle regulation) and Histone acetyltransferase KAT7 (related to epigenetic transcriptional regulation). The results presented here add important findings to the understanding of diapause in tropical species, thus increasing the comprehension of diapause-related molecular mechanisms.
Cholesterol is delivered to the limiting membrane of late endosomes by Niemann-Pick Type C1 and C2 proteins. This review summarizes recent evidence that cholesterol transfer from endosomes to the endoplasmic reticulum and other organelles is mediated by lipid-binding proteins that localize to membrane contact sites (MCS).
LDL-cholesterol in the late endosomal/lysosomes is exported to the plasma membrane, where most cholesterol resides, and the endoplasmic reticulum, which harbors the regulatory complexes and enzymes that control the synthesis and esterification of cholesterol. A major advance in dissecting these cholesterol transport pathways was identification of frequent and dynamic MCS between endosomes and the endoplasmic reticulum, peroxisomes and plasma membrane. Positioned at these MCS are members of the oxysterol-binding protein (OSBP) and steroidogenic acute regulatory protein-related lipid-transfer family of lipid transfer proteins that bridge the opposing membranes and directly or indirectly mediate cholesterol transfer. OSBP-related protein 1L (ORP1L), ORP5 and ORP6 mediate cholesterol transfer to the endoplasmic reticulum that regulates cholesterol homeostasis. ORP1L and STARD3 also move cholesterol from the endoplasmic reticulum-to-late endosomal/lysosomes under low-cholesterol conditions to facilitate intraluminal vesicle formation. Cholesterol transport also occurs at MCS with peroxisomes and possibly the plasma membrane.
Frequent contacts between organelles and the endo-lysosomal vesicles are sites for bidirectional transfer of cholesterol.
Niemann-Pick disease, type C1 (NPC1) is a neurodegenerative disorder with limited treatment options. NPC1 is associated with neuroinflammation; however, attempts to therapeutically target neuroinflammation in NPC1 have had mixed success. We show here that NPC1 neuroinflammation is characterized by an atypical microglia activation phenotype. Specifically, Npc1-/- microglia demonstrated altered morphology, reduced levels of lineage markers and a shift toward glycolytic metabolism. Treatment with 2-hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin (HPβCD), a drug currently being studied in a phase 2b/3 clinical trial, reversed all microglia-associated defects in Npc1-/- animals. In addition, impairing microglia mediated neuroinflammation by genetic deletion of IRF8 led to decreased symptoms and increased lifespan. We identified CD22 as a marker of dysregulated microglia in Npc1 mutant mice and subsequently demonstrated that elevated cerebrospinal fluid levels of CD22 in NPC1 patients responds to HPβCD administration. Collectively, these data provide the first in-depth analysis of microglia function in NPC1 and suggest possible new therapeutic approaches.
Niemann-Pick C1-like1 (NPC1L1), a crucial cholesterol absorption receptor expressed in human intestine and liver. But in mouse it is only expressed in intestine. Previous studies elucidated that expression of human NPC1L1 in mouse liver led to increase of plasma cholesterol due to activation of absorption from bile. However, hepatic NPC1L1 function was not elucidated in LDL receptor deficient mouse (LDLR-/-) in which LDL was a main lipoprotein as in human.
L1-Tg/LDLR-/- mouse was created by crossing liver-specific NPC1L1 transgenic mouse (L1-Tg) with LDLR-/-. L1-Tg/LDLR-/- mice developed hyperlipidemia when fed with atherogenic diet (AD) containing 0.2% cholesterol for 21days. Compared with control mice, biliary cholesterol level in L1-Tg/LDLR-/- mice was significantly lower, plasma cholesterol level was significantly higher in L1-Tg/LDLR-/- mice under both chow diet and AD feeding. New finding in this study is augmentations of plasma TAG L1-Tg/LDLR-/- mice fed with AD. Results were shown that very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) secretion was elevated in L1-Tg/LDLR-/- mice after AD fed. The increase of VLDL secretion was further confirmed by higher expression of hepatic triacylglycerol hydrolase (TGH) and microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP).
L1-Tg/LDLR-/- mouse is a humanized model to study cholesterol absorption and transportation. The results obtained from L1-Tg/LDLR-/- mouse indicated no feedback mechanism to inhibit NPC1L1 function in liver and hepatic expression of NPC1L1 correlated with VLDL secretion in hypercholesterolemia state.
Niemann-Pick-disease type C1 (NPC1) is an autosomal-recessive cholesterol-storage disorder. Besides other symptoms, NPC1 patients develop liver dysfunction and hepatosplenomegaly. The mechanisms of hepatomegaly and alterations of lipid metabolism-related genes in NPC1 disease are still poorly understood. Here, we used an NPC1 mouse model to study an additive hepatoprotective effect of a combination of 2-hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin (HPβCD), miglustat and allopregnanolone (combination therapy) with the previously established monotherapy using HPβCD. We examined transgene effects as well as treatment effects on liver morphology and hepatic lipid metabolism, focusing on hepatic cholesterol transporter genes. Livers of Npc1-/- mice showed hepatic cholesterol sequestration with consecutive liver injury, an increase of lipogenetic gene expression, e.g., HMG-CoA, a decrease of lipolytic gene expression, e.g., pparα and acox1, and a decrease of lipid transporter gene expression, e.g., acat1, abca1 and fatp2. Both, combination therapy and monotherapy, led to a reduction of hepatic lipids and an amelioration of NPC1 liver disease symptoms. Monotherapy effects were related to pparα- and acox1-associated lipolysis/β-oxidation and to fatp2-induced fatty acid transport, whereas the combination therapy additionally increased the cholesterol transport via abca1 and apoE. However, HPβCD monotherapy additionally increased cholesterol synthesis as indicated by a marked increase of the HMG-CoA and srebp-2 mRNA expression, probably as a result of increased hepatocellular proliferation.
Phospholipids have been shown to modulate intestinal cholesterol absorption in cells and animals, a process that is regulated by several transporter proteins. Of these proteins, Niemann-Pick C1-Like 1 (NPC1L1) is a major contributor to this process. The mechanism by which phospholipids modulate cholesterol absorption remains unknown. Here, we evaluate the effects of egg-yolk phospholipids on cholesterol absorption and transport in human colon carcinoma cell line (Caco-2 cells) and on the expression of NPC1L1 and others proteins associated with cholesterol absorption (ABCG5, ABCG8, ABCA1, ACAT2, MTP, CAV-1, ANX-2). The roles of SREBP-1 and SREBP-2 in this process were also investigated. The results show that egg-yolk sphingomyelin (CerPCho) and phosphatidylcholine (PtdCho) inhibit cholesterol transport in the Caco-2 monolayer in a dose-dependent manner. These might be due to the decrease of the cholesterol solubility in micelles as well as to the increases in the micellar sizes and the bile acid-binding capacity. Furthermore, the treatments with egg-yolk CerPCho or PtdCho at 1.2 mmol/L reduced the expression levels of NPC1L1 protein to 21 or 22%, respectively, and its mRNA to 9 or 31% of that in the control group (p &lt; 0.05). Moreover, there was a general inhibitory effect of egg-yolk PtdCho and CerPCho on the mRNA levels of SREBP-1, and SREBP-2. These results suggest that the inhibitory effect of egg-yolk CerPCho and PtdCho on cholesterol transport might be due to their interference with the physicochemical properties of micelles and their regulations on the expression of the NPC1L1 gene.
Rice bran oil (RBO) possesses a plasma cholesterol-lowering activity, while effect of wheat bran oil (WBO) on plasma cholesterol remains unknown. The present study compared the cholesterol-lowering activity of WBO with that of RBO in hamsters. Fifty-four male hamsters were divided into seven groups fed either a noncholesterol diet (NCD) or one of six high-cholesterol diets, namely HCD diet (0.2% cholesterol +9.5% lard), HCD+C diet (0.2% cholesterol +9.5% lard +0.5% cholestyramine), WL diet (0.2% cholesterol +4.8% Lard +4.8% WBO), WH diet (0.2% cholesterol +9.5% WBO), RL diet (0.2% cholesterol +4.8% Lard +4.8% RBO), and RH diet (0.2% cholesterol +9.5% RBO). Plasma total cholesterol (TC) in HCD group was 327.4 ± 31.8 mg/dL, while plasma TC in two WBO and two RBO groups was 242.2 ± 20.8, 243.1 ± 31.7, 257.1 ± 16.3, and 243.4 ± 46.0 mg/dL, respectively, leading to a decrease in plasma TC by 22-26% ( P &lt; 0.01). No significant difference in cholesterol-lowering potency was seen between WBO and RBO. Plasma cholesterol-lowering activity of WBO and RBO was accompanied by down-regulation of hepatic 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase and fatty acid synthase, while up-regulation of cholesterol-7α-hydroxylase. WL, WH, RL, and RH diets increased the fecal excretion of total neutral sterols by 72.8%, 106.9%, 5.4%, and 36.8% ( P &lt; 0.01) respectively. Results indicated WBO and RBO could inhibit cholesterol absorption via down-regulation of intestinal Niemann-Pick C1 like 1 protein, acyl CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase 2, and ATP binding cassette transporter 5. In summary, WBO was equally effective as RBO in decreasing plasma cholesterol in hypercholesterolemia hamsters.
Niemann-Pick C1-like 1 (NPC1L1) and Niemann-Pick C2 (NPC2) is a critical mediator of cholesterol absorption. The aim of the present study was to investigate the prognostic value of NPC1L1 and NPC2 in human primary hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The expression level of NPC1L1 and NPC2 were evaluated by Immunohistochemistry, Westen blot and Real-time Quantitative PCR. Protein expression level in tissue was represented by integral optic density (IOD). For prognosis analyses, outcome-based cut-point was calculated by X-tile software. Kaplan-Meier analysis, Cox regression analysis were used evaluate prognostic value of NPC1L1 and NPC2 and NPC1L1/NPC2 combination. Both of NPC1L1 and NPC2 were significantly decreased in HCC tissues than peritumoral liver tissues (61 pairs of tissue for Immunohistochemistry and 10 pairs of tissues for Western blot and Real-time Quantitative PCR), respectively. (n=61: p=0.0005 for NPC1L1 and p=0.0001 for NPC2; n=10: p=0.0002 for NPC1L1 and p=0.0489 for NPC2). Kaplan-Meier analyses in 265 HCC cases were showed that the low expression level of NPC1L1 and NPC2 and NPC1L1/NPC2 combination were significantly correlated with poor overall survival (OS) and shorter time to recurrence (TTR). In addition, univariate and multivariate Cox analyses showed that the expression level of NPC1L1/NPC2 combination in HCC was an independent prognostic factor for OS and TTR. Conclusion: NPC1L1 and NPC2 were lowly expressed in HCC compared with peritumoral liver tissues, and low expression of NPC1L1 and NPC2 in HCC tissues may indicate poor outcome of HCC patients after surgery. NPC1L1/NPC2 combination is an independent prognostic factor for OS and TTR in postoperative HCC patients.
Recent studies showed that atherosclerosis is a lysosomal storage disease (LSD) and Niemann-Pick disease type C1 (NPC1) is the most important protein of the lysosomal membrane that is involved in the removal of FC from lysosomes. Whereas several in vitro and in vivo studies have described the crosstalk between lysosomal cholesterol accumulation and increased inflammation, there is no study addressing the correlation between NPC1 gene expression and an anti-inflammatory cytokine, interleukin 10 (IL-10) serum concentration in atherosclerotic patients.
IL-10 and 25-hydroxyvitamin D serum concentrations were quantified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in atherosclerotic patients (n = 40) and a control group (n = 40). NPC1 gene expression analysis was performed by quantitative real-time PCR, and correlation between the two parameters was assessed.
Mean IL-10 serum concentration and peripheral blood mononuclear cells' (PBMCs) gene expression of NPC1, adjusted for drug consumption, age, and BMI, was not significantly different between the patient and control groups (p = 0.6 and 0.67 respectively). However, NPC1 gene expression showed positive significant correlation with IL-10 serum concentration (p = 0.04, r = 0.29). We also observed lower serum concentration of IL-10 in the subjects with lower 25-hydroxyvitamin D serum concentration (p = 0.034).
Our findings supported the previous observations showing the contribution of lysosomal lipid homeostasis of PBMCs to inflammation and pathogenesis of atherosclerosis.
Fatty acids have been shown to modulate intestinal cholesterol absorption in cells and animals, a process that is mediated by several transporter proteins. Of these proteins, Niemann-Pick C1-Like 1 (NPC1L1) is a major contributor to this process. The current study investigates the unknown mechanism by which fatty acids modulate cholesterol absorption.
We evaluated the effects of six fatty acids palmitic acid (PAM), oleic acid (OLA), linoleic acid (LNA), arachidonic acid (ARA), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) on cholesterol uptake and transport in human enterocytes Caco-2 cells, and on the mRNA expression levels of NPC1L1, others proteins (ABCG5, ABCG8, ABCA1, ACAT2, MTP, Caveolin 1, Annexin-2) involved in cholesterol absorption, and SREBP-1 and SREBP-2 that are responsible for lipid metabolism.
The polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), especially for EPA and DHA, dose-dependently inhibited cholesterol uptake and transport in Caco-2 monolayer, while saturated fatty acids (SFAs) and monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) had no inhibitory effects. EPA and DHA inhibited cholesterol absorption in Caco-2 monolayer might be caused by down-regulating NPC1L1 mRNA and protein levels, which were associated with inhibition of SREBP-1/- 2 mRNA expression levels.
Results from this study indicate that functional food containing high PUFAs may have potential therapeutic benefit to reduce cholesterol absorption. Further studies on this topic may provide approaches to control lipid metabolism and to promote health.
Interest in using herbal medicines to treat the hypercholesterolemia is increasing. Cranberry extract could decrease plasma cholesterol, however, the active ingredients and the underlying mechanisms remain largely unknown.
The present study was to test the hypothesis that cranberry anthocyanins (CrA) were at least one of the active ingredients responsible for the cholesterol-lowering activity of cranberry fruits via a mechanism of increasing fecal sterol excretion.
Forty-four hamsters were randomly divided into five groups and fed one of the five diets, namely a non-cholesterol control diet (NCD), a high-cholesterol control diet (HCD), a HCD diet supplemented with a low dose of 1% CrA (CL), a HCD diet supplemented with a high dose of 2% CrA (CH), and a HCD diet supplemented with 0.5% cholestyramine as a positive control drug (P-CTL), respectively, for six weeks. Plasma lipoprotein cholesterol was quantified using the enzymatic kits, while the gene expressions of transporters, enzymes and receptors involved in cholesterol absorption and metabolism were quantified using the quantitative RT-PCR. Fecal sterols were quantified using gas chromatography (GC).
Plasma total cholesterol and aorta atherosclerotic plaque decreased dose-dependently with the increasing amounts of CrA added into diets. This was accompanied by a dose-dependent increase in excretion of both neutral and acidic sterols. CrA had no effect on the mRNA levels of intestinal Niemann-Pick C1 like 1 protein (NPC1L1), acyl CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase2 (ACAT2), microsomal triacylglycerol transport protein (MTP), and ATP binding cassette transporter 5 (ABCG5) as well as hepatic cholesterol-7α-hydroxylase (CYP7A1), 3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl reductase (HMG-CoA-R), sterol regulatory element binding protein 2 (SREBP2), LDL receptor (LDL-R), and Liver X receptor alpha (LXRα).
CrA as an herbal medicine could favorably modify the lipoprotein profile in hamsters fed a high cholesterol diet by enhancing excretion of fecal neutral and acidic sterols, most likely not mediated by interaction with genes of transporters, enzymes and proteins involved in cholesterol absorption and metabolism.
Ezetimibe (EZE) and glucuronidated EZE (EZE-Glu) differentially target Niemann-Pick C1-like 1 (NPC1L1) and CD13 (aminopeptidase-N) to inhibit intestinal cholesterol absorption and cholesterol processing in other cells, although the precise molecular mechanisms are not fully elucidated. Cellular effects of EZE, EZE-Glu, and the low-absorbable EZE-analogue S6130 were investigated on human monocyte-derived macrophages upon loading with atherogenic lipoproteins. EZE and S6130, but not EZE-Glu disturbed the colocalization of CD13 and its coreceptor CD64 (Fcγ receptor I) in membrane microdomains, and decreased the presence of both receptors in detergent-resistant membrane fractions. Biotinylated cholesterol absorption inhibitor C-5 (i.e., derivative of EZE) was rapidly internalized to perinuclear tubular structures of cells, resembling endoplasmic reticulum (ER), but CD13 was detected on extracellular sites of the plasma membrane and endolysosomal vesicles. Administration of EZE, but not of EZE-Glu or S6130, was associated with decreased cellular cholesteryl ester content, indicating the sterol-O acyltransferase 1 (SOAT1)-inhibition by EZE. Furthermore, EZE decreased the expression of molecules involved in cholesterol uptake and synthesis, in parallel with increased apolipoprotein A-I-mediated cholesterol efflux and upregulation of efflux-effectors. However, NPC1L1 the other claimed molecular target of EZE, was not detected in macrophages, thereby excluding this protein as target for EZE in macrophages. Thus, EZE is very likely a CD13-linked microdomain-disruptor and SOAT1-inhibitor in macrophages leading to in vitro anti-atherosclerotic effects through a decrease of net cellular cholesterol content. © 2019 International Society for Advancement of Cytometry.
Niemann-Pick Type C (NP-C) is an inherited neurovisceral lysosomal storage disease characterized by a defect in the trafficking of endocytosed cholesterol. In 95% of patients the gene encoding NPC1 is affected. The correlation of the genetic background in NP-C with the clinical phenotype such as, severity and onset of liver dysfunction, ataxia, dystonia and vertical gaze palsy, has not been elucidated at the molecular level. We have designed strategies to investigate the effect of different mutations in the NPC1 gene at the protein and cellular levels. The NPC1 mutants were expressed in mammalian cells and their structural features, maturation pathways and subcellular localization elucidated. Interestingly, three classes of NPC1 mutants could be identified and further characterized. The first group comprised mutants in which the NPC1 protein revealed virtually similar structural features to the wild type species. It was trafficked to the lysosomes and colocalized with the lysosomal protein marker Lamp2. The second class of NPC1 mutants was only partially trafficked to the lysosomes, but predominantly localized to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). In the third group with the most severe phenotype, NPC1 mutants were entirely retained in the ER, colocalizing with the ER-protein marker calnexin. In conclusion, this study relates NPC1 mutations to the trafficking behavior of the NPC1 mutants along the secretory pathway. The findings are essential for a comprehensive understanding of the pathogenesis of NP-C and propose a mutation-based personalized therapeutical approach.
Reverse Cholesterol Transport (RCTr) is the mechanism by which excess cholesterol from peripheral tissues is transported to the liver for hepatobiliary excretion, thereby inhibiting foam cell formation and the development of atherosclerosis. Exercise affects RCTr, by influencing high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL) through remodeling and by promoting hepatobiliary sterol excretion. The objectives of this systematized review of animal studies is to summarize the literature and provide an overview of the effects of chronic exercise (at least two weeks) on apolipoproteins (Apo A-I, Apo-E), Paraoxonase-1 (PON1), ATP-binding cassette transporters (ABCA1, ABCG1, ABCG4, ABCG5, ABCG8), scavenger receptor class B type I (SR-BI), cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP), low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLr) and cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase (CYP7A1) and Niemann-Pick C1-like 1 (NPC1L1).
Three electronic databases (PubMed, Science Direct and Google Scholar) were searched for eligible studies conducted from the earliest available date to August 2018.
Most of studies investigate the effects of low to moderate intensity aerobic training on RCTr elements. The majority were on exercised rats undertaking moderate intensity aerobic training.
This review highlights that moderate intensity and longer-term training has a greater effect on RCTr elements than low intensity training. There a few studies examining high intensity training which warrants further investigation.
Health benefits of soybean germ oil have not yet been fully explored. The present study examined the blood cholesterol-lowering activity of soybean germ oil and the underlying mechanisms in hypercholesterolemic hamsters. Forty hamsters were randomly assigned into five groups and fed a non-cholesterol diet, a high cholesterol diet and one of three high cholesterol diets containing 0.50% cholestyramine, 4.75% soybean germ oil, and 9.50% soybean germ oil, respectively, for 6 weeks. The result showed that soybean germ oil significantly decreased plasma cholesterol by 18.5-31.5%, which was accompanied by 28.3-62.7% increase in excretion of fecal neutral sterols and bile acids. The effect was mediated by down-regulation of intestinal Niemann-Pick C1-like 1 protein (NPC1L1) and up-regulation of liver cholesterol-7α-hydroxylase (CYP7A1). We concluded that soybean germ oil favorably modulated the blood cholesterol concentration by inhibiting cholesterol absorption through inhibiting gene expression of NPC1L1 and by enhancing bile acid excretion via promoting gene expression of CYP7A1.
Plasmodium parasites possess a protein with homology to Niemann-Pick Type C1 proteins (Niemann-Pick Type C1-Related protein, NCR1). We isolated parasites with resistance-conferring mutations in Plasmodium falciparum NCR1 (PfNCR1) during selections with three diverse small-molecule antimalarial compounds and show that the mutations are causative for compound resistance. PfNCR1 protein knockdown results in severely attenuated growth and confers hypersensitivity to the compounds. Compound treatment or protein knockdown leads to increased sensitivity of the parasite plasma membrane (PPM) to the amphipathic glycoside saponin and engenders digestive vacuoles (DVs) that are small and malformed. Immuno-electron microscopy and split-GFP experiments localize PfNCR1 to the PPM. Our experiments show that PfNCR1 activity is critically important for the composition of the PPM and is required for DV biogenesis, suggesting PfNCR1 as a novel antimalarial drug target.
This article has been through an editorial process in which the authors decide how to respond to the issues raised during peer review. The Reviewing Editor's assessment is that all the issues have been addressed (see decision letter).
Niemann-Pick disease, type C1 (NPC1) is a fatal, autosomal recessive, neurodegenerative disorder caused by mutations in the NPC1 gene. As a result, there is accumulation of unesterified cholesterol and sphingolipids in the late endosomal/lysosomal system. This abnormal accumulation results in a cascade of pathophysiological events including progressive, cerebellar neurodegeneration, among others. While significant progress has been made to better understand NPC1, the downstream effects of cholesterol storage and the major mechanisms that drive neurodegeneration remain unclear. In the current study, a) the use of a commercial, highly efficient standard flow-ESI platform for protein biomarker identification is implemented and b) protein biomarkers are identified and evaluated at a terminal time point in the NPC1 null mouse model. In this study, alterations are observed in proteins related to fatty acid homeostasis, calcium binding and regulation, lysosomal regulation, and inositol biosynthesis and metabolism, as well as signaling by Rho family GTPases. New observations from this study include altered expression of Pcp2 and Limp2 in Npc1 mutant mice relative to control, with Pcp2 exhibiting multiple isoforms and specific to the cerebella. This study provides valuable insight into pathways altered in the late-stage pathophysiology of NPC1.
Niemann-Pick disease, type C1 (NPC1) is a rare, autosomal recessive, lipid storage disorder caused by mutations in NPC1. As a result, there is accumulation of unesterified cholesterol and sphingolipids in the late endosomal/lysosomal system. Clinically, patients can present with splenomegaly and hepatomegaly. In the current study, we analyzed the differential proteome of the spleen in symptomatic Npc1-/- mice to complement previous studies focused on the differential proteome of the liver, and then evaluated biomolecules that may serve as tissue biomarkers. The proteomic analysis revealed altered pathways in NPC1 representing different functional categories including heme synthesis, cellular regulation and phosphoinositide metabolism in both tissues. Differential proteins included several activators of the ubiquitous and critical protein, Akt, a major kinase involved in multiple cellular processes. Evaluation of Akt revealed decreased expression in both the liver and spleen tissues of symptomatic Npc1-/- mice. Upstream regulation analysis also suggested that miR-155 may modulate the differences of known downstream protein targets observed in our dataset. Upon evaluation of miR-155, we observed an increased expression in the liver and decreased expression in the spleen of symptomatic Npc1-/- mice. Here, we propose that miR-155 may be a novel indicator of spleen and liver pathology in NPC1.
Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1) is a membrane protein required for the transport of low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-derived cholesterol from endosomes and lysosomes to the other organelles. Here, we describe the recombinant protein expression, purification, and characterization of the human NPC1. The protein is transiently expressed in human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells. Our purification protocol describes the steps to obtain a pure and homogeneous NPC1 protein. Niemann-Pick C2 (NPC2) is a small soluble protein, which mediates cholesterol transport in tandem with NPC1. Finally, we also describe two biochemical approaches to characterize NPC1 function in vitro-a cholesterol transfer assay from purified NPC2 to NPC1 and a binding assay between NPC1 and NPC2.
Intestinal Niemann-Pick C1 Like 1 (NPC1L1) protein plays a key role in cholesterol absorption. A decrease in NPC1L1 expression has been implicated in lowering plasma cholesterol and mitigating the risk for coronary heart disease. Little is known about the mechanisms responsible for NPC1L1 protein degradation that upon activation may lead to a reduction in NPC1L1 protein levels in intestinal epithelial cells (IECs). In current studies, the human intestinal Caco-2 and HuTu-80 cell lines expressing NPC1L1-hemagglutinin fusion protein were used to investigate the mechanisms of NPC1L1 protein degradation. Incubation with the proteasome inhibitors MG-132 and lactacystin (10 μM, 24 h) significantly increased NPC1L1 protein levels in IECs. Also, the inhibition of the lysosomal pathway with bafilomycin A1 (80 nM, 24 h) resulted in a significant increase in NPC1L1 protein levels. Immunoprecipitation studies showed that NPC1L1 protein is both a poly- and monoubiquinated polypeptide and that the inhibition of the proteasomal pathway remarkably increased the level of the polyubiquinated NPC1L1. The surface expression of NPC1L1 was increased by the inhibition of both proteasomal and lysosomal pathways. Furthermore, the pharmacological inhibition of mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway (PD-98059, 15 μM, 24 h) and siRNA silencing of ERK1/2 resulted in a significant decrease in NPC1L1 protein levels in IECs. In conclusion, our results showed that basal level of intestinal cholesterol transporter NPC1L1 protein is modulated by both ubiquitin proteasome- and lysosome-dependent degradation as well as by ERK1/2-dependent pathway. The modulation of these pathways may provide novel clues for therapeutic intervention to inhibit cholesterol absorption and lower plasma cholesterol.
Quetiapine, one of the most prescribed atypical antipsychotics, has been associated with hyperlipidemia and an increased risk for cardiovascular disease in patients, but the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. Here, we identified quetiapine as a potent and selective agonist for pregnane X receptor (PXR), a key nuclear receptor that regulates xenobiotic metabolism in the liver and intestine. Recent studies have indicated that PXR also plays an important role in lipid homeostasis. We generated potentially novel tissue-specific PXR-KO mice and demonstrated that quetiapine induced hyperlipidemia by activating intestinal PXR signaling. Quetiapine-mediated PXR activation stimulated the intestinal expression of cholesterol transporter Niemann-Pick C1-Like 1 (NPC1L1) and microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP), leading to increased intestinal lipid absorption. While NPC1L1 is a known PXR target gene, we identified a DR-1-type PXR-response element in the MTP promoter and established MTP as a potentially novel transcriptional target of PXR. Quetiapine's effects on PXR-mediated gene expression and cholesterol uptake were also confirmed in cultured murine enteroids and human intestinal cells. Our findings suggest a potential role of PXR in mediating adverse effects of quetiapine in humans and provide mechanistic insights for certain atypical antipsychotic-associated dyslipidemia.
Lipid homeostasis is essential to the maintenance of life. We previously reported that disruptions of the parasite Na+ homeostasis via inhibition of PfATP4 resulted in elevated cholesterol within the parasite plasma membrane as assessed by saponin sensitivity. A large number of compounds have been shown to target the parasite Na+ homeostasis. We screened 800 compounds from the Malaria and Pathogen Boxes to identify chemotypes that disrupted the parasite plasma membrane lipid homeostasis. Here, we show that the compounds disrupting parasite Na+ homeostasis also induced saponin sensitivity, an indication of parasite lipid homeostasis disruption. Remarkably, 13 compounds were identified that altered the plasma membrane lipid composition independently of the Na+ homeostasis disruption. Further studies suggest that these compounds target the Plasmodium falciparum Niemann-Pick type C1-related (PfNCR1) protein, which is hypothesized to be involved in maintaining plasma membrane lipid composition. PfNCR1, like PfATP4, appears to be targeted by multiple chemotypes with the potential for drug discovery.
Inherited ataxias are a group of highly heterogeneous, complex neurological disorders representing a significant diagnostic challenge in clinical practice. We performed a next-generation sequencing (NGS) analysis in 10 index cases with unexplained progressive cerebellar ataxia of suspected autosomal recessive inheritance. A definite molecular diagnosis was obtained in 5/10 families and included the following diseases: autosomal recessive spastic ataxia of Charlevoix-Saguenay, POLR3B-related hypomyelinating leukodystrophy, primary coenzyme Q10 deficiency type 4, Niemann-Pick disease type C1 and SYNE1-related ataxia. In addition, we found a novel homozygous MTCL1 loss of function variant p.(Lys407fs) in a 23-year-old patient with slowly progressive cerebellar ataxia, mild intellectual disability, seizures in childhood and episodic pain in the lower limbs. The identified variant is predicted to truncate the protein after first 444 of 1586 amino acids. MTCL1 encodes a microtubule-associated protein highly expressed in cerebellar Purkinje cells; its knockout in a mouse model causes ataxia. We propose MTCL1 as a candidate gene for autosomal recessive cerebellar ataxia in humans. In addition, our study confirms the high diagnostic yield of NGS in early-onset cerebellar ataxias, with at least 50% detection rate in our ataxia cohort.
Obesity is one of the main causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide. More than 120 genes have been shown to be associated with obesity related phenotypes. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of selected genetic polymorphisms in Uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) and Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1) genes in an obese population in Saudi Arabia.
The genotypes of rs1800592, rs10011540 and rs3811791 (UCP1 gene) and rs1805081 and rs1805082 (NPC1 gene) were determined in a total of 492 subjects using TaqMan chemistry by Real-time PCR. In addition, capillary sequencing assay was performed to identify two specific polymorphisms viz., rs45539933 (exon 2) and rs2270565 (exon 5) of UCP1 gene.
A significant association of UCP1 polymorphisms rs1800592 [OR, 1.52 (1.10-2.08); p = 0.009] was observed in the obese cohort after adjusting with age, sex and type 2 diabetes. Further BMI based stratification revealed that this association was inconsistent with both moderate and extreme obese cohort. A significant association of UCP1 polymorphisms rs3811791 was observed only in the moderate-obese cohort [OR = 2.89 (1.33-6.25); p = 0.007] but not in the extreme-obese cohort indicating an overlying genetic complexity between moderate-obesity and extreme-obesity. The risk allele frequencies, which were higher in moderate-obese cohort, had abnormal HDL, LDL and triglyceride levels.
The rs1800592 and rs3811791 of UCP1 gene are associated with obesity in general and in the moderate-obese group in particular. The associated UCP1 polymorphisms in the moderate-obese group may regulate the impaired energy metabolism which plays a significant role in the initial stages of obesity.
Olfactory impairment is one of the earliest symptoms in neurodegenerative disorders that has also been documented in Niemann-Pick disease type C1 (NPC1). NPC1 is a very rare, neurovisceral lipid storage disorder, characterized by a deficiency of Npc1 gene function that leads to progressive neurodegeneration. Here, we compared the pathologic effect of defective Npc1 gene on the vomeronasal neuroepithelium (VNE) with that of the olfactory epithelium (OE) in an NPC1 mouse model.
Proliferation in the VNE and OE was assessed by applying a bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) protocol. We further compared the immunoreactivities of anti-olfactory marker protein (OMP), and the lysosomal marker cathepsin-D in both epithelia. To investigate if degenerative effects of both olfactory systems can be prevented or reversed, some animals were treated with a combination of miglustat/allopregnanolone/2-hydroxypropyl-cyclodextrin (HPβCD), or a monotherapy with HPβCD alone.
Using BrdU to label dividing cells of the VNE, we detected a proliferation increase of 215% ± 12% in Npc1-/- mice, and 270% ± 10% in combination- treated Npc1-/- animals. The monotherapy with HPβCD led to an increase of 261% ± 10.5% compared to sham-treated Npc1-/- mice. Similar to the OE, we assessed the high regenerative potential of vomeronasal progenitor cells. OMP reactivity in the VNE of Npc1-/- mice was not affected, in contrast to that observed in the OE. Concomitantly, cathepsin-D reactivity in the VNE was virtually absent. Conclusion: Vomeronasal receptor neurons are less susceptible against NPC1 pathology than olfactory receptor neurons. Compared to control mice, however, the VNE of Npc1-/- mice displays an increased neuroregenerative potential, indicating compensatory cell renewal.
Niemann-Pick disease, type C1 (NPC1) is an inborn error of metabolism that results in endolysosomal accumulation of unesterified cholesterol. Clinically, NPC1 manifests as cholestatic liver disease in the newborn or as a progressive neurogenerative condition characterized by cerebellar ataxia and cognitive decline. Currently there are no FDA approved therapies for NPC1. Thus, understanding the pathological processes that contribute to neurodegeneration will be important in both developing and testing potential therapeutic interventions. Neuroinflammation and necroptosis contribute to the NPC1 pathological cascade. Receptor Interacting Protein Kinase 1 and 3 (RIPK1 and RIPK3), are protein kinases that play a central role in mediating neuronal necroptosis. Our prior work suggested that pharmacological inhibition of RIPK1 had a significant but modest beneficial effect; however, the inhibitors used in that study had suboptimal pharmacokinetic properties. In this work we evaluated both pharmacological and genetic inhibition of RIPK1 kinase activity. Lifespan in both Npc1-/- mice treated with GSK'547, a RIPK1 inhibitor with better pharmacokinetic properties, and Npc1-/-:Ripk1kd/kd double mutant mice was significantly increased. In both cases the increase in lifespan was modest, suggesting that the therapeutic potential of RIPK1 inhibition, as a monotherapy, is limited. We thus investigated the potential of combining RIPK1 inhibition with 2-hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin (HPβCD) therapy HPβCD has been shown to slow neurological disease progression in NPC1 mice, cats and patients. HPβCD appeared to have an additive positive effect on the pathology and survival of Npc1-/-:Ripk1kd/kd mice. RIPK1 and RIPK3 are both critical components of the necrosome, thus we were surprised to observe no increase survival in Npc1-/-;Ripk3-/- mice compared to Npc1-/- mice. These data suggest that although necroptosis is occurring in NPC1, the observed effects of RIPK1 inhibition may be related to its RIPK3-independent role in neuroinflammation and cytokine production.
Despite the importance of Dengue virus (DENV) infection in human health, there is not a fully effective vaccine or antiviral treatment against the infection. Since lipids such as cholesterol are required during DENV infection, its uptake and synthesis are increased in infected cells. Ezetimibe is an FDA-approved drug that reduces cholesterol uptake by inhibiting the endocytosis through Niemman-Pick C1-Like 1 (NPC1L1) receptor, expressed on the membrane of enterocytes and hepatocytes. Our results indicate that an increase in the amount of NPC1L1 occurs on the surface of Huh-7 cells during DENV infection, which correlates with an increase in cholesterol levels. Blockage of NPC1L1 with ezetimibe in concentrations up to 50 μM does not reduce cell viability but diminished total cellular cholesterol, the percentage of infected cells, viral yield, viral RNA and protein synthesis without affecting DENV binding and/or entry to Huh-7 cells. Moreover, ezetimibe inhibited DENV replicative complex formation and lipid droplets accumulation. All these results indicate that ezetimibe is an excellent drug to inhibit DENV infection and confirm that cholesterol is a key target to inhibit viral infection.
Niemann-Pick type C (NPC) disease is a fatal hereditary neurodegenerative disorder characterized by a massive accumulation of cholesterol in lysosomes and late endosomes due to a defect in intracellular cholesterol trafficking. Dysfunction in intracellular cholesterol trafficking is responsible for about 50 rare inherited lysosomal storage disorders including NPC. The lysosomal proteins NPC1 and NPC2 play a crucial role in trafficking of cholesterol from late endosomes and lysosomes to other cellular compartments. However, the detailed mechanisms of cholesterol trafficking at the late endosomes/lysosomes (LE/LY) are poorly understood. Studies showed that 2-hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin (HPβCD) alleviates the cholesterol accumulation defect in animal model and has been approved for a phase 2b/3 clinical trial for NPC. HPβCD is known to bind cholesterol; however, the mechanisms how HPβCD mediates the exit of cholesterol from the LE/LY compartments are still unknown. Further, another cyclodextrin (CD) derivative, 2-hydroxypropyl-γ-cyclodextrin (HPγCD), was shown to reduce intracellular cholesterol accumulation in NPC patient cells and NPC mice model. Herein, we identified a number of candidate proteins differentially expressed in NPC patient-derived cells compared to cells derived from a healthy donor using a proteomic approach. Interestingly, both HPβCD and HPγCD treatments modulated the expression of most of these NPC-specific proteins. Data showed that treatment with both CDs induces the expression of the lysosome-associated membrane protein 1 (LAMP-1) in NPC patient-derived cells. Remarkably, LAMP-1 overexpression in HeLa cells rescued U18666A-induced cholesterol accumulation suggesting a role of LAMP-1 in cholesterol trafficking. We propose that HPβCD and HPγCD facilitate cholesterol export from the LE/LY compartments via the LAMP-1 protein, which may play a crucial role in cholesterol trafficking at the LE/LY compartments when there is no functional NPC1 protein. Together, this study uncovers new cellular mechanisms for cholesterol trafficking, which will contribute to development of novel therapeutic approaches for lysosomal storage diseases.
Niemann-Pick Type C1 (NPC1) disease is a fatal neurovisceral disorder caused by dysfunction of NPC1 protein, which plays a role in intracellular cholesterol trafficking. The cholesterol-chelating agent, 2-hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin (HPβCD), is currently undergoing clinical trials for treatment of this disease. Though promising in alleviating neurological symptoms, HPβCD causes irreversible hearing loss in NPC1 patients and outer hair cell (OHC) death in animal models. We recently found that HPβCD-induced OHC death can be significantly alleviated in a mouse model lacking prestin, an OHC-specific motor protein required for the high sensitivity and sharp frequency selectivity of mammalian hearing. Since cholesterol status is known to influence prestin's electromotility, we examined how prestin contributes to HPβCD-induced OHC death in the disease context using the NPC1 knockout (KO) mouse model (NPC1-KO). We found normal expression and localization of prestin in NPC1-KO OHCs. Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings revealed a significant depolarization of the voltage-operating point of prestin in NPC1-KO mice, suggesting reduced levels of cholesterol in the lateral membrane of OHCs that lack NPC1. OHC loss and elevated thresholds were found for high frequency regions in NPC1-KO mice, whose OHCs retained their sensitivity to HPβCD. To investigate whether prestin's electromotile function contributes to HPβCD-induced OHC death, the prestin inhibitor salicylate was co-administered with HPβCD to WT and NPC1-KO mice. Neither oral nor intraperitoneal administration of salicylate mitigated HPβCD-induced OHC loss. To further determine the contribution of prestin's electromotile function, a mouse model expressing a virtually nonelectromotile prestin protein (499-prestin) was subjected to HPβCD treatment. 499-prestin knockin mice showed no resistance to HPβCD-induced OHC loss. As 499-prestin maintains its ability to bind cholesterol, our data imply that HPβCD-induced OHC death is ascribed to the structural role of prestin in maintaining the OHC's lateral membrane, rather than its motor function.
Intestinal cholesterol absorption is a key regulator of systemic cholesterol homeostasis. Excessive dietary cholesterol and its intestinal uptake lead to hypercholesterolemia, a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Intestinal cholesterol uptake is mediated by Niemann-Pick C1-like 1 (NPC1L1), a transmembrane protein localized in membrane microdomains (lipid rafts) enriched in gangliosides and cholesterol. The roles of gangliosides, such as monosialodihexosylganglioside (GM3) and its synthesizing enzyme GM3 synthase (GM3S), in NPC1L1-dependent cholesterol uptake have not been examined previously. Here, we examined NPC1L1-dependent cholesterol uptake in a cell model as well as in wild-type and apoE-deficient mice fed normal or high-cholesterol diets. We showed that NPC1L1-dependent cholesterol uptake was impaired in GM3S-deficient cells and that GM3S deficiency promoted resistance to hypercholesterolemia in both wild-type and apoE-deficient mice fed the high-cholesterol but not the normal diet. Our findings suggest that GM3 and related gangliosides are essential for NPC1L1-mediated intestinal cholesterol absorption and are potential targets for hypercholesterolemia therapy.
The Niemann-Pick type C1 (NPC1) protein is a large transmembrane protein located in lysosomes/endosomes. NPC1 binds cholesterol (CLR) and transports it to cellular membrane and endoplasmic reticulum. Mutations in NPC1 cause Niemann-Pick type C (NPC) disease, a rare autosomal disorder characterized by intracellular accumulations of CLR and subsequent neurodegeneration leading to premature death. Among known disease-causing mutations in NPC1, Q92R is the one that is located in the N-terminal cholesterol-binding domain [NTD]. Here we study the effect of the mutation on the ability of NPC1 (NTD) to bind and retain CLR in the binding pocket using structural analysis. We compare characteristics of the Q92R and Q92S mutant type (MT) protein, which is predicted to be benign. We provide detailed investigation of the CLR-NPC1 (NTD) binding process; and propose the mechanism, by which Q92R mutation causes NPC disease. We show that although Q92 residue neither directly participates in catalytic activity of the NPC1 (NTD), nor defines its CLR-binding specificity - it is important for the overall protein structure as well as for providing favorable electrostatic environment for CLR transfer. Our results suggest that a negative electrostatic potential of the CLR binding site (the S-opening) might promote NPC2 interaction with NPC1 (NTD) and/or proper CLR orientation and its enforced transfer. We show that in contrast to the benign Q92S mutation, Q92R significantly reduces electrostatic potential around S-opening, and thus likely affects NPC1 (NTD)-NPC2 interaction and/or CLR transfer from NPC2 to NPC1.
Background: Neurodegenerative diseases are often accompanied by olfactory deficits. Here we use a rare neurovisceral lipid storage disorder, Niemann-Pick disease C1 (NPC1), to illustrate disease-specific dynamics of olfactory dysfunction and its reaction upon therapy. Previous findings in a transgenic mouse model (NPC1-/-) showed severe morphological and electrophysiological alterations of the olfactory epithelium (OE) and the olfactory bulb (OB) that ameliorated under therapy with combined 2-hydroxypropyl-ß-cyclodextrin (HPßCD)/allopregnanolone/miglustat or HPßCD alone. Methods: A buried pellet test was conducted to assess olfactory performance. qPCR for olfactory key markers and several olfactory receptors was applied to determine if their expression was changed under treatment conditions. In order to investigate the cell dynamics of the OB, we determined proliferative and apoptotic activities using a bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) protocol and caspase-3 (cas-3) activity. Further, we performed immunohistochemistry and western blotting for microglia (Iba1), astroglia (GFAP) and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH). Results: The buried pellet test revealed a significant olfactory deterioration in NPC1-/- mice, which reverted to normal levels after treatment. At the OE level, mRNA for olfactory markers showed no changes; the mRNA level of classical olfactory receptor (ORs) was unaltered, that of unique ORs was reduced. In the OB of untreated NPC1-/- mice, BrdU and cas-3 data showed increased proliferation and apoptotic activity, respectively. At the protein level, Iba1 and GFAP in the OB indicated increased microgliosis and astrogliosis, which was prevented by treatment. Conclusion: Due to the unique plasticity especially of peripheral olfactory components the results show a successful treatment in NPC1 condition with respect to normalization of olfaction. Unchanged mRNA levels for olfactory marker protein and distinct olfactory receptors indicate no effects in the OE in NPC1-/- mice. Olfactory deficits are thus likely due to central deficits at the level of the OB. Further studies are needed to examine if olfactory performance can also be changed at a later onset and interrupted treatment of the disease. Taken together, our results demonstrate that olfactory testing in patients with NPC1 may be successfully used as a biomarker during the monitoring of the treatment.
Our understanding of infection biology is based on experiments in which pathogen or host proteins are perturbed by small compound inhibitors, mutation, or depletion. This approach has been remarkably successful, as, for example, demonstrated by the independent identification of the endosomal membrane protein Niemann-Pick C1 as an essential factor for Ebola virus infection in both small compound and insertional mutagenesis screens (Côté, Nature 477:344-348, 2011; Carette et al., Nature 477:340-343, 2011). However, many aspects of host-pathogen interactions are poorly understood because we cannot target all of the involved molecules with small molecules, or because we cannot deplete essential proteins. Single domain antibody fragments expressed in the cytosol or other organelles constitute a versatile alternative to perturb the function of any given protein by masking protein-protein interaction interfaces, by stabilizing distinct conformations, or by directly interfering with enzymatic activities. The variable domains of heavy chain-only antibodies (VHHs) from camelid species can be cloned from blood samples of animals immunized with the desired target molecules. We can thus exploit the ability of the camelid immune system to generate affinity-matured single domain antibody fragments to obtain highly specific tools. Interesting VHH candidates are typically identified based on their affinity toward immobilized antigens using techniques such as phage display.The phenotypical screening approach described here allows the direct identification of VHHs that prevent infection of cells with influenza A virus (IAV) or other pathogens. The VHH repertoire is cloned into a lentiviral vector, which is used to generate pseudo-typed lentivirus particles. Target cells are transduced with the lentivirus, so that every cell inducibly expresses a different VHH. This cell collection is then challenged with a lethal dose of virus. Only the cells which express a VHH that prevents infection by targeting virus proteins or host cell components essential for infection will survive. We can thus identify critical target molecules including vulnerable epitopes and conformations, render target molecules accessible to informative perturbation studies, and stabilize intermediates of virus entry for detailed analysis.
Niemann-Pick disease type C1 (NPC1) is a rare autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disease primarily caused by mutations in NPC1 NPC1 is characterized by abnormal accumulation of unesterified cholesterol and glycolipids in late endosomes and lysosomes. Common signs include neonatal jaundice, hepatosplenomegaly, cerebellar ataxia, seizures and cognitive decline. Both mouse and feline models of NPC1 mimic the disease progression in humans and have been used in preclinical studies of 2-hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin (2HPβCD; VTS-270), a drug that appeared to slow neurological progression in a Phase 1/2 clinical trial. However, there remains a need to identify additional therapeutic agents. High-throughput drug screens have been useful in identifying potential therapeutic compounds; however, current preclinical testing is time and labor intensive. Thus, development of a high-capacity in vivo platform suitable for screening candidate drugs/compounds would be valuable for compound optimization and prioritizing subsequent in vivo testing. Here, we generated and characterize two zebrafish npc1-null mutants using CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene targeting. The npc1 mutants model both the early liver and later neurological disease phenotypes of NPC1. LysoTracker staining of npc1 mutant larvae was notable for intense staining of lateral line neuromasts, thus providing a robust in vivo screen for lysosomal storage. As a proof of principle, we were able to show that treatment of the npc1 mutant larvae with 2HPβCD significantly reduced neuromast LysoTracker staining. These data demonstrate the potential value of using this zebrafish NPC1 model for efficient and rapid in vivo optimization and screening of potential therapeutic compounds.This article has an associated First Person interview with the first author of the paper.
This study assessed the cholesterol lowering effect of Pediococcus acidilactici LAB4 and Lactobacillus plantarum LAB12 using adult zebrafish. Animals were fed with a high cholesterol diet (HCD) with/without LAB for seven weeks. Serum and liver cholesterol was quantified using colorimetric and dye staining methods. Expressions of npc1l1 and abca1 in the liver and intestine and appa in the brain were quantified using RT-PCR. Serum and liver cholesterol was significantly lowered in LAB4- and LAB12-fed zebrafish (≤64% and ≤71%, respectively), with reduced liver cholesterol deposition. The cholesterol lowering effect was accompanied by down-regulation of npc1l1 in intestines (≤28.7%), up-regulation of abca1 in the liver (≥30.5%) and down-regulation of appa in the brain (≤24.5%). A moderately strong positive Pearson correlation (r = 0.617, p &lt; 0.01) was found between appa and serum cholesterol. LAB-fed zebrafish exhibited improved spatial learning and memory. LAB4 and LAB12 can be potentially used in preventing hypercholesterolaemia and Alzheimer's diseases.
Fat stress-induced liver disease is a hepatic manifestation of metabolic syndrome initiated by excess fat accumulation and encompasses a wide spectrum of diseases from non-alcoholic fatty liver disease to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, a precursor lesion progressing to more aggressive liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Although the incidence of these fat stress-induced liver diseases is rapidly increasing worldwide in parallel with the growing epidemics of obesity and metabolic diseases, its exact pathogenesis is not well defined. Although obesity, sedentary life-style, altered dietary pattern, insulin resistance, altered intestinal barrier function, inflammatory cytokines, and oxidative stress have been acknowledged as contributing factors because of the indefinite pathogenesis of metabolic diseases, the only reliable treatment is lifestyle intervention composed of restrictive diet and exercise. Additionally, some existing medications such as pioglitazone and antioxidants such as vitamin E were reported to be effective; in this review, several novel agents especifically targeting nonalcoholic fatty liver disease pathogenesis under clinical trial will be introduced. These include an NPC1L1 blocker (ezetimibe), which significantly improved histological and symptomatic scores associated with steatohepatitis and fibrosis; clofibrate, phentoxyfylline, ursodeoxycholic acid, and tocopherol, all of which are prescribed to relieve fat stress; and additional IgY targeted NPC1L1, tocotrienol, ursodeoxycholic acid, and ω-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, which are actively under investigation to confirm the safety of long-term use.
Homeostasis of cholesterol is regulated by absorption in the intestine and synthesis in the liver. The authors previously demonstrated that OPN (osteopontin) exhibits the ability to alter hepatic cholesterol metabolism, thus affecting cholesterol gallstone formation in mice. The present study investigated the role of OPN in cholesterol gallstone formation, focusing on its effect on intestinal absorption of cholesterol. OPN gene knockout (OPN‑/‑) mice and wild‑type mice were respectively fed with a chow or lithogenic diet (LD) for 8 weeks. Following an 8‑week LD period, the incidence of gallstone, bile composition, level of serum and fecal lipids and the expression of intestinal associated genes were analyzed. OPN‑/‑ mice were protected from gallstone formation induced by 8 weeks' LD‑feeding. This protective effect from OPN deficiency was associated with alterations in bile composition, including a reduced concentration of biliary cholesterol. Additionally, plasma cholesterol level was decreased in LD‑fed OPN‑/‑ mice. The alterations primarily resulted from the decreased expression of intestinal Niemann‑Pick C1‑like (NPC1 L) 1, which is important in the intestinal absorption of cholesterol. The present study demonstrated that OPN deficiency reduced intestinal absorption of cholesterol by suppressing the expression of NPC1L1, thus protecting mice from cholesterol gallstone formation.
Alpha-naphthyl isothiocyanate (ANIT) is a common hepatotoxicant experimentally used to reproduce the pathologies of drug-induced liver injury in humans, but the mechanism of its toxicity remains unclear. To determine the metabolic alterations following ANIT exposure, metabolomic analyses was performed by use of liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) of liver, serum, bile, ileum, and cecum of vehicle- and ANIT-treated mice revealed significant alterations of individual bile acids, including increased tauroursodeoxycholic acid, taurohydrodeoxycholic acid, taurochenodeoxycholic acid, and taurodeoxycholic acid, and decreased ω-, β- and tauro-α/β- murideoxycholic acid, cholic acid, and taurocholic acid in the ANIT-treated groups. In accordance with these changes, ANIT treatment altered the expression of mRNAs encoded by genes responsible for the metabolism and transport of bile acids and cholesterol. Pre-treatment of glycyrrhizin (GL) and glycyrrhetinic acid (GA) prevented ANIT-induced liver damage and reversed the alteration of bile acid metabolites and Cyp7a1, Npc1l1, Mttp, and Acat2 mRNAs encoding bile acid transport and metabolism proteins. These results suggested that GL/GA could prevent drug-induced liver injury and ensuing disruption of bile acid metabolism in humans.
Hepatitis C virus can lead to chronic infection, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. With more than 170 million people infected worldwide, eradication remains a challenge even with the revolutionary current direct antiviral agents (DAAs). The risk of resistance, the safety profile in some populations, the genotype specificity and the high price of current DAAs explain why there is still interest in developing host targeting agents (HTA) that may help overcome some of these difficulties. Specifically, targeting the entry of HCV to the cell seems like a promising strategy. Recently it has been shown that the cholesterol transporter NPC1L1, a protein located in the small bowel epithelium and in the canalicular membrane of the hepatocyte is also an HCV receptor. Just as this protein is key in the entero-hepatic cycle of cholesterol, we hypothesize that there is an entero-hepatic cycle of HCV that could be disrupted by blocking NPC1L1 with ezetimibe, an already approved and readily available safe drug. Ezetimibe, either alone or in combination with DAAs, could decrease relapse rates, reduce resistance and even make treatments cheaper.
In nematodes, the intestine senses and integrates early life dietary cues that lead to lifelong epigenetic adaptations to a perceived nutritional environment-it is not clear whether this process occurs in mammals. We aimed to establish a mouse model of reduced dietary cholesterol availability from maternal milk and investigate the consequences of decreased milk cholesterol availability, early in life, on the metabolism of cholesterol in adult mice. We blocked intestinal absorption of cholesterol in milk fed to newborn mice by supplementing the food of dams (for 3 weeks between birth and weaning) with ezetimibe, which is secreted into milk. Ezetimibe interacts with the intestinal cholesterol absorption transporter NPC1l1 to block cholesterol uptake into enterocytes. Characterization of these offspring at 24 weeks of age showed a 27% decrease in cholesterol absorption (P &lt; .001) and reduced levels of Npc1l1 messenger RNA and protein, but not other cholesterol transporters, in the proximal small intestine. We observed increased histone H3K9me3 methylation at positions -423 to -607 of the proximal Npc1l1 promoter in small intestine tissues from 24-week-old offspring fed ezetimibe during lactation, compared with controls. These findings show that the early postnatal mammalian intestine functions as an environmental sensor of nutritional conditions, responding to conditions such as low cholesterol levels by epigenetic modifications of genes. Further studies are needed to determine how decreased sterol absorption for a defined period might activate epigenetic regulators; the findings of our study might have implications for human infant nutrition and understanding and preventing cardiometabolic disease.
The life cycle of the hepatitis C virus (HCV) is closely associated with lipid metabolism. Recently, NPC1L1 (a cholesterol transporter) has been reported to function as an HCV receptor. This receptor is expressed in the hepatocyte canalicular membrane and in the intestine; serving as a key transporter for the cholesterol enterohepatic cycle.
We hypothesized that HCV might have a similar cycle, so we aimed to study the presence of HCV in bile and stools of infected patients.
Blood, feces, and duodenal bile samples were collected from patients infected with HCV. The biliary viral load was normalized to the bile salt concentration of each sample and the presence of HCV core protein was also evaluated. A total of 12 patients were recruited. HCV RNA was detected in the bile from ten patients.
The mean viral load was 2.5log10IU/60mg bile salt. In the stool samples, HCV RNA was detected in ten patients (mean concentration 2.7log10IU/g of feces).
HCV RNA is readily detectable and is present at relatively high concentrations in the bile and stool samples of infected patients. This may be relevant as a source of infection in men who have sex with men. Biliary HCV secretion may perhaps play a role in the persistence of viral infection via an enterohepatic cycle of the virus or intrahepatic spread.
Sitosterolemia is a rare, autosomal recessively inherited disorder of lipid metabolism caused by mutations in the "ATP-binding cassette, subfamily G" member 5 and 8 proteins (encoded by the ABCG5 and ABCG8 genes, respectively), which play critical roles in the intestinal and biliary excretion of plant sterols. We report the clinical features and treatment outcomes of an 18-month-old Japanese girl with sitosterolemia, who presented with multiple linear and intertriginous xanthomas around the joint areas. Serum lipid analyses revealed elevated levels of total cholesterol (T-Chol: 866 mg/dL), low density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C: 679 mg/dL), and plant sterols (sitosterol: 24.6 mg/dL, campesterol: 19.2 mg/dL, stigmasterol: 1.8 mg/dL). Compound heterozygous mutations (p.R419H and p.R389H) were identified in ABCG5. The patient was placed on a low cholesterol/low plant sterol diet and treated with colestimide (a bile acid sequestrant) and ezetimibe (an NPC1L1 inhibitor). Serum T-Chol and LDL-C levels decreased to normal within 2 mo, and plant sterol levels decreased by 30% within 4 mo. The xanthomas regressed gradually, and almost completely disappeared after 1.5 yr of treatment. No further reductions of plant sterol levels were observed. Long-term follow-up is important to verify appropriate therapeutic goals to prevent premature atherosclerosis and coronary artery disease.
Previous research has shown that Tartary buckwheat flour is capable of reducing plasma cholesterol. The present study was to examine the effect of rutin and Tartary buckwheat protein on plasma total cholesterol (TC) in hypercholesterolemia hamsters. In the first animal experiment, 40 male hamsters were divided into four groups fed either the control diet or one of the three experimental diets containing 8.2 mmol rutin, 8.2 mmol quercetin, or 2.5 g kg-1 cholestyramine, respectively. Results showed that only cholestyramine but not rutin and its aglycone quercetin decreased plasma TC, which suggested that rutin was not the active ingredient responsible for plasma TC-lowering activity of Tartary buckwheat flour. In the second animal experiment, 45 male hamsters were divided into five groups fed either the control diet or one of the four experimental diets containing 24% Tartary buckwheat protein, 24% rice protein, 24% wheat protein, or 5 g kg-1 cholestyramine, respectively. Tartary buckwheat protein reduced plasma TC more effectively than cholestyramine (45% versus 37%), while rice and wheat proteins only reduced plasma TC by 10-13%. Tartary buckwheat protein caused 108% increase in the fecal excretion of total neutral sterols and 263% increase in the fecal excretion of total acidic sterols. real-time polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting analyses showed that Tartary buckwheat protein affected the gene expression of intestinal Niemann-Pick C1-like protein 1 (NPC1L1), acyl CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase 2 (ACAT2), and ATP binding cassette transporters 5 and 8 (ABCG5/8) in a down trend, whereas it increased the gene expression of hepatic cholesterol-7α -hydroxylase (CYP7A1). It was concluded that Tartary buckwheat protein was at least one of the active ingredients in Tartary buckwheat flour to lower plasma TC, mainly mediated by enhancing the excretion of bile acids via up-regulation of hepatic CYP7A1 and also by inhibiting the absorption of dietary cholesterol via down-regulation on intestinal NPC1L1, ACAT2 and ABCG5/8.
Lipid nanoparticles (LNs) are widely investigated for oral drug delivery, and for achieving significant advantages in colloidal stability, biocompatibility and scaled-up possibility. However, researchers face challenge of developing methods to improve the ability of LNs in overcoming multiple barriers (i.e., mucus and epithelium barrier) in gastrointestinal (GI) tract because of the contradictory requirement of nanoparticle (NP) surface properties in the two processes. Therefore, we designed novel LNs with adjustable surface properties by coating lipid core with hydrophobic substitutes grafting N-(2-hydroxypropyl) methacrylamide copolymer (pHPMA). In the present study, different substitutes (i.e., monocyclic, polycyclic, and linear segments) were grafted on pHPMA backbone. Screening studies demonstrated that type and grafting degree of substitutes both influenced hydrophilic-hydrophobic properties of NP surface and improved penetration through mucus. When a hydrophilic-hydrophobic balance was achieved, NPs showed elevated mucus permeability compared with bare LNs; this phenomenon subsequently contributed to higher cellular uptake. Moreover, β-sitosterol (SITO)-modified pHPMA-coated (grafting degree: 5%) LNs (5% SITO-LNs) exhibited the highest mucus permeability, transepithelial transport, and in situ absorption. Interestingly, even with the highest surface hydrophilicity, 5% SITO-LNs with Caco-2 cells did not show impaired membrane affinity, which was not observed in other groups. Further investigations of mechanism demonstrated that membrane affinity was significantly enhanced by β-SITO-mediated interaction with Niemann-Pick C1-like 1 (NPC1L1) protein on cell membranes. These results proved that hydrophobic substitutes play a critical role in altering hydrophilic-hydrophobic property of particle surface and improving penetration through multiple barriers. β-SITO-induced specific interaction can provide additional benefits to efficiency of oral delivery of LNs.
Cholesterol cholelithiasis is a multifactorial hepatobiliary disease.
Interactions between genetic and environmental factors play a critical role in biliary cholesterol homeostasis and its imbalance enhances cholelithogenesis.
In patients developing symptoms or complications of gallstone disease, laparoscopic cholecystectomy is recommended for treatment of gallstones. In a subgroup of patients with small, radiolucent pure cholesterol gallstones, the hydrophilic bile acid, ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) is still considered the only pharmacological therapy able to induce oral litholysis. Identifying novel and effective pharmacological therapies is being investigated.
We propose that the specific intestinal Niemann-Pick C1-like 1 protein inhibitor ezetimibe is a potential agent for preventing gallstone formation by reducing bioavailability of intestine- derived cholesterol to the liver for biliary secretion and desaturating bile through the inhibition of intestinal absorption of cholesterol.
Ischemic heart disease is the main cause of death worldwide and it is accelerated by increased low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (LDL-C) and/or lipoprotein (a) (Lp(a)) concentrations. Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) alters both LDL-C and in part Lp(a) concentrations through its ability to induce degradation of the LDL receptor (LDLR). PCSK9, however, has additional targets which are potentially involved in lipid metabolism regulation such as the very low density lipoprotein receptor (VLDL), CD36 (cluster of differentiation 36) and the epithelial cholesterol transporter (NPC1L1) and it affects expression of apolipoprotein B48. The PCSK9 activity is tightly regulated at several levels by factors influencing its transcription, secretion, or by extracellular inactivation and clearance. Many comorbidities (kidney insufficiency, hypothyreoidism, hyperinsulinemia, inflammation) modify PCSK9 expression and release. Two humanized antibodies directed against extracellular PCSK9 received approval by the European and US authorities and additional PCSK9 directed therapeutics (such as silencing RNA) are already in clinical trials. Their results demonstrate a significant reduction in both LDL-C and Lp(a) concentrations - independent of the concomitant medication - and one of them reduced plaque size in high risk cardiovascular patients; results of two ongoing large clinical endpoints studies are awaited. In this review, we summarize and discuss the recent biological data on PCSK9, the regulation of PCSK9, and finally briefly summarize the data of recent clinical studies in the context of lipid metabolism.
Statins (HMG CoA reductase inhibitors), in addition to reducing circulating cholesterol and incidence of coronary heart disease, also have pleiotropic, anti-inflammatory effects. Patients with chronic liver diseases, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) or hepatitis C are often excluded from statin therapy because of adverse effects in a small cohort of patients despite increased cardiovascular risk cholesterol. Ezetimibe, which inhibits cholesterol absorption by inhibition of Niemann-Pick C1 like 1 (NPC1L1) protein in the brush border of intestinal cells, has been suggested as a new therapeutic option in these patients.
Effects of ezetimibe on lipoprotein metabolism, hepatic and intestinal lipid content in guinea pigs, an animal model with a lipoprotein profile and pattern similar to humans were investigated. In order to investigate a possible effect of ezetimibe on cholesterol induced inflammation NF-kappaB activation as an indicator for inflammatory processes in liver and gut tissue was measured.
Lipid enriched diet led to accumulation of lipids in hepatic tissue which caused strong hepatic NF-kappaB activation. Ezetimibe reduced lipid diet induced increase of circulating cholesterol by about 77% and prevent hepatic NF-kappaB activation almost completely. In contrast in intestinal cells Ezetimibe, though lowering diet induced cholesterol accumulation, increased triglyceride content and subsequent NF-kappaB activation.
In summary these data show, that ezetimibe effectively reduced diet induced circulating cholesterol levels, hepatic lipid accumulation and inflammatory response in our guinea pig model. However this drug elicited a local inflammatory response in intestinal tissue. Whether these diverse effects of ezetimibe on inflammatory parameters such as NF-kappaB have clinical relevance remains to be determined.
Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) plays a causal role in atherosclerosis. One way to reduce LDL-C levels is to inhibit cholesterol absorption. Plant sterols and stanols compete with cholesterol for absorption in the intestine and induce an average decrease in LDL-C by 5% to 15% in a dose-dependent manner, but not in all individuals. This review focuses on the interindividual variability in response to dietary supplementation with plant sterols and stanols. Dietary plant sterols and stanols have no significant effects on LDL-C in substantial numbers of individuals. Higher responses, in absolute value and percentage of LDL-C, are observed in individuals with higher cholesterol absorption and a lower rate of cholesterol synthesis. Some data provide evidence of the influence of genetics on the response to plant sterols and stanols. Further studies in large populations are required to extend these conclusions about genetic influences.
Carotenoid dietary intake and their endogenous levels have been associated with a decreased risk of several chronic diseases. There are indications that carotenoid bioavailability depends, in addition to the food matrix, on host factors. These include diseases (e.g. colitis), life-style habits (e.g. smoking), gender and age, as well as genetic variations including single nucleotide polymorphisms that govern carotenoid metabolism. These are expected to explain interindividual differences that contribute to carotenoid uptake, distribution, metabolism and excretion, and therefore possibly also their association with disease risk. For instance, digestion enzymes fostering micellization (PNLIP, CES), expression of uptake/efflux transporters (SR-BI, CD36, NPC1L1), cleavage enzymes (BCO1/2), intracellular transporters (FABP2), secretion into chylomicrons (APOB, MTTP), carotenoid metabolism in the blood and liver (LPL, APO C/E, LDLR), and distribution to target tissues such as adipose tissue or macula (GSTP1, StARD3) depend on the activity of these proteins. In addition, human microbiota, e.g. via altering bile-acid concentrations, may play a role in carotenoid bioavailability. In order to comprehend individual, variable responses to these compounds, an improved knowledge on intra-/interindividual factors determining carotenoid bioavailability, including tissue distribution, is required. Here, we highlight the current knowledge on factors that may explain such intra-/interindividual differences.
Bisphenol A (BPA), an commonly exposed environmental chemicals in humans, has been shown to have a hypercholesterolemic effect with molecular mechanism not clear. Since intestinal cholesterol absorption plays a major role in maintaining total body cholesterol homeostasis, the present study is to investigate whether BPA affects cholesterol absorption in the intestinal Caco-2 cells.
The Caco-2 cells were pretreated with BPA at different concentrations for 24 h and then incubated with radioactive micellar cholesterol for 2 h. The absorption of radioactive cholesterol was quantified by liquid scintillation. The expression of Niemann-Pick C1-like 1 (NPC1L1) and sterol regulatory element binding protein-2 (SREBP-2) was analyzed by Western blot and qPCR.
We found that confluent Caco-2 cells expressed NPC1L1, and the absorption of cholesterol in the cells was inhibited by ezetimibe, a specific inhibitor of NPC1L1. We then pretreated the cells with 0.1-10 nM BPA for 24 h and found that BPA at 1 and 10 nM doses promoted cholesterol absorption. In addition, we found that the BPA-induced promotion of cholesterol absorption was associated with significant increase in the levels of NPC1L1 protein and NPC1L1 mRNA. Moreover, the stimulatory effects of BPA on cholesterol absorption and NPC1L1 expression could be prevented by blockade of the SREBP-2 pathway.
This study provides the first evidence that BPA promotes cholesterol absorption in the intestinal cells and the stimulatory effect of BPA is mediated, at least in part, by SREBP-2-NPC1L1 signaling pathway.
Tocopherol is used not only as an ethical drug but also as a supplement. In 2008, it was reported that α-tocopherol is partly transported via an intestinal cholesterol transporter, Niemann-Pick C1-Like 1 (NPC1L1). Ezetimibe, a selective inhibitor of NPC1L1, is administered for a long time to inhibit cholesterol absorption and there is a possibility that the absorption of α-tocopherol is also inhibited by ezetimibe. This study investigated the influence of ezetimibe on the absorption of α-tocopherol with single administration and long-term administration. An approach to avoid its undesirable consequence was also examined. α-Tocopherol (10 mg/kg) and ezetimibe (0.1 mg/kg) were administered to rats, and the plasma concentration profiles of α-tocopherol and tissue concentrations were investigated. The plasma concentration of α-tocopherol was decreased by the combination use of ezetimibe in the case of concurrent single administration. On the other hand, inhibition of the absorption of α-tocopherol was prevented by an administration interval of 4 h. In a group of rats administered for 2 months with a 4 h interval, not only the plasma concentration but also the liver concentration was increased compared with those in a group with concurrent combination intake of α-tocopherol and ezetimibe. The absorption of α-tocopherol was inhibited by ezetimibe. The inhibitory effect of ezetimibe can be prevented by an administration interval of 4 h, although ezetimibe is a medicine of enterohepatic circulation. Attention should be paid to the use of ezetimibe and components of NPC1L1 substrates such as α-tocopherol. Copyright © 2016 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.
We previously demonstrated that curcumin reduces cholesterol absorption in Caco-2 cells through down-regulating Niemann-Pick C1-like 1 (NPC1L1) expression, but the in vivo effect of curcumin on intestinal cholesterol absorption remains unknown. The present study aimed to investigate the effects and mechanisms of curcumin consumption on cholesterol absorption in hamsters. Male hamsters were fed a high-fat diet supplemented with or without curcumin (0.05% w/w) for 12 weeks. Curcumin supplementation significantly decreased serum total cholesterol (TC) (from 6.86 ± 0.27 to 3.50 ± 0.24 mmol/L), triglyceride (TG) (from 5.07 ± 0.34 to 3.72 ± 0.40 mmol/L), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (from 2.58 ± 0.19 to 1.71 ± 0.15 mmol/L) levels as well as liver TC (from 11.6 ± 0.05 to 7.2 ± 0.03 mg/g) and TG (from 30.3 ± 0.22 to 25.2 ± 0.18 mg/g) levels (P &lt; 0.05 for all). In contrast, curcumin treatment markedly enhanced fecal cholesterol output (P &lt; 0.01). Moreover, curcumin supplementation down-regulated the mRNA and protein expressions of sterol regulatory element binding protein-2 (SREBP-2) and NPC1L1 in the small intestine (P &lt; 0.05). Our current results indicate that curcumin inhibits cholesterol absorption in hamsters by suppressing SREBP-2 and subsequently down-regulating NPC1L1 expression, which may be responsible for the hypocholesterolemic effects of curcumin.
CVD affect a large proportion of the world's population, with dyslipidaemia as the major risk factor. The regular consumption of both probiotic bacteria and yeast has been associated with improvement in the serum lipid profile. Thus, the present review aims to describe and discuss the potential mechanisms responsible for the hypocholesterolaemic effect of regular consumption of probiotic bacteria and yeast. Regarding the hypocholesterolaemic effect of probiotic bacteria, the potential mechanisms responsible include: deconjugation of bile salts; modulation of lipid metabolism; and decreased absorption of intestinal cholesterol through co-precipitation of intestinal cholesterol with the deconjugated bile salts, incorporation and assimilation of cholesterol in the cell membrane of the probiotics, intestinal conversion of cholesterol in coprostanol, and inhibition of the expression of the intestinal cholesterol transporter Niemann-Pick C1 like 1 (NPC1L1) in the enterocytes. The potential mechanisms responsible for the hypocholesterolaemic effect of probiotic yeasts include: deconjugation of bile salts; co-precipitation of intestinal cholesterol with the deconjugated bile salts; incorporation and assimilation of cholesterol in the cell membrane; and inhibition of hepatic cholesterol synthesis. The regular consumption of probiotic bacteria and yeast, as a non-pharmaceutical approach to help manage cardiovascular risk, holds promise, according to the beneficial hypocholesterolaemic effects described herein. However, the hypocholesterolaemic effects vary according to the strains used, the physiological state of the host, and the type of diet to which the probiotics are added. Further studies are necessary to fill the gaps with regard to the knowledge related to this topic.
Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is characterized by the accumulation of triglycerides, cholesterol and toxic free fatty acids and is related to low vitamin D levels. In an analysis of specific gene sets we elucidate to what extent NAFLD associates to epigenetic and related transcriptional changes in gene networks regulating lipid, energy and vitamin D balance. Two gene clusters responsible for lipid homeostasis (74 genes) and vitamin D and energy balance (31 genes) were investigated with regard to average epigenetic shifts within the first 1500bp next to the transcriptional start site. Three cohorts from two published genome wide driven studies that used a microarray approach were investigated including altogether 103 NAFLD and 75 liver healthy subjects. In the first two steps associations between NAFLD abundance, strength of fibrosis and methylation were investigated in two cohorts by multiple linear regression analyses, correcting for important clinical and demographic parameters. Methylation associated strength of transcription in genes showing significant NAFLD related methylation changes were studied in a third step using a third cohort and applying Pearson's correlation and robust linear regression analyses. 41 genes in gene cluster 1 and 14 genes in cluster 2 were significantly differentially methylated in dependency of NAFLD and hepatic fibrosis. We detect new genes significantly changed in methylation, including APO family members (lipid transport), NPC1L1, STARD (cholesterol transport) and GRHL (energy homeostasis). Our results allow novel insights into the hepatic epigenetic regulation of genes important for lipid and vitamin D balance in NAFLD.
Patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) have an increased risk for progression to hepatocellular carcinoma in addition to comorbidities such as cardiovascular and serious metabolic diseases; however, the current therapeutic options are limited. Based on our previous report that omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFAs) can significantly ameliorate high fat diet (HFD)-induced NAFLD, we explored the therapeutic efficacy of n-3 PUFAs and N-IgY, which is a chicken egg yolk-derived IgY specific for the Niemann-Pick C1-Like 1 (NPC1L1) cholesterol transporter, on NAFLD in mice. We generated N-IgY and confirmed its efficient cholesterol transport-blocking activity in HepG2 and Caco-2 cells, which was comparable to the effect of ezetimibe (EZM). C57BL/6 wild type and fat-1 transgenic mice, capable of producing n-3 PUFAs, were fed a high fat diet (HFD) alone or supplemented with N-IgY. Endogenously synthesized n-3 PUFAs combined with N-IgY led to significant decreases in hepatic steatosis, fibrosis, and inflammation (p&lt;0.01). The combination of N-IgY and n-3 PUFAs resulted in significant upregulation of genes involved in cholesterol uptake (LDLR), reverse cholesterol transport (ABCG5/ABCG8), and bile acid metabolism (CYP7A1). Moreover, fat-1 transgenic mice treated with N-IgY showed significant downregulation of genes involved in cholesterol-induced hepatic stellate cell activation (Tgfb1, Tlr4, Col1a1, Col1a2, and Timp2). Collectively, these data suggest that n-3 PUFAs and N-IgY, alone or in combination, represent a promising treatment strategy to prevent HFD-induced fatty liver through the activation cholesterol catabolism to bile acids and by decreasing cholesterol-induced fibrosis.
There is growing interest in the use of probiotic lactic acid bacteria (LAB) for prevention of hypercholesterolaemia. This study assessed the cholesterol lowering ability of Pediococcus acidilactici LAB4 and Lactobacillus plantarum LAB12 in growth media. Both LAB yielded &gt;98% (39.2 μg/ml) cholesterol lowering in growth media. Nile Red staining indicated direct assimilation of cholesterol by the LAB. The LAB were then explored for their prophylactic (pre-treatment of HT29 cells with LAB prior to cholesterol exposure) and biotherapeutic (treatment of HT29 cells with LAB after exposure to cholesterol) use against short and prolonged exposure of HT29 cells to cholesterol, respectively. For HT29 cells pre-treated with LAB, cholesterol lowering was accompanied by down-regulation of ATP-binding cassette family transporter-type A1 (ABCA1), cluster of differentiation 36 (CD36) and scavenger receptor class B member 1 (SCARB1). HT29 cells treated with LAB after prolonged exposure to cholesterol source, on the other hand, was associated with up-regulation of ABCA1, restoration of CD36 to basal level and down-regulation of Neimann-Pick C1-Like 1 (NPC1L1). The present findings implied the potential use of LAB4 and LAB12 as part of the strategies in prevention and management of hypercholesterolaemia.
Increased evidences have demonstrated that gut microbiota targeted diet intervention can alleviate obesity and related metabolic disorders. The underlying mechanism of interactions among diet, microbiota, and host still remains unclear. Enterobacter cloacae B29, an endotoxin-producing strain dominated in the gut of a morbidly obese volunteer (weight 174.8 kg, BMI 58.8 kg m-2) was isolated and transplanted to germfree mice (inoculated 1010 cells of B29 per day for 1 week). Using deep mRNA sequencing technology, we compared different gene expression profiles in the colon samples of the germfree mice treated with/without B29 and/or high fat diet (HFD) for 16 weeks and identified 279 differential expressed genes in total, including up-regulated genes Apoa4 (fold change, 2.77), Ido1 (2.66), Cyp4a10 (7.01), and down-regulated genes Cyp2e1 (0.11), Cyp26b1 (0.34), Akr1b7 (0.42), Adipoq (0.36), Cyp1a1 (0.11), Apoa1 (0.44), Npc1l1 (0.37), Tff2 (0.13), Apoc1 (0.30), Ctla2a (0.34), Mttp (0.49), Lpl (0.48). Fifty-nine GO biological processes and five KEGG pathways, particularly the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors signaling pathway, were significantly enriched in response to HFD+B29, which were mainly relevant to inflammation and the metabolism of lipid, lipoprotein, and sterols. These functional changes were consistent with the developed obesity, insulin-resistance, and aggravated inflammatory conditions of the HFD+B29 mice. This work provides insight into the gene expression changes in response to HFD+B29, helping to understand the mechanism of the interactions among HFD, B29 and the germfree mice.
Intestinal cholesterol metabolism is important in influencing postprandial lipoprotein concentrations, and might be important in the development of vascular disease.
This study evaluated associations between expression of intestinal cholesterol metabolism genes, postprandial lipid metabolism, and endothelial function/early vascular disease in human subjects.
One hundred patients undergoing routine oesophago-gastro-duodenoscopy were recruited. mRNA levels of Nieman-Pick C1-like 1 protein (NPC1L1), ABC-G5, ABC-G8, ABC-A1, microsomal tissue transport protein (MTTP), and sterol-regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP)-2 were measured in duodenal biopsies using quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Postprandially, serum lipid and glycemic profiles were measured, endothelial function was assessed using fasting, and postprandial flow-mediated dilatation (FMD) and carotid intima-media thickness (IMT). Subjects were divided into those above and below the median value of relative expression of each gene, and results were compared between the groups.
There were no between-group differences in demographic variables or classical cardiovascular risks. For all genes, the postprandial triglyceride incremental area under the curve was greater (P &lt; 0.05) in the group with greater expression. Postprandial apolipoprotein B48 (ApoB48) levels were greater (P &lt; 0.05) in groups with greater expression of NPC1L1, ABC-G8, and SREBP-2. For all genes, postprandial but not fasting FMD was lower (P &lt; 0.01) in the group with greater expression. Triglyceride and ApoB48 levels correlated significantly with postprandial FMD. Carotid artery IMT was greater (P &lt; 0.05) in groups with greater expression of MTTP, ABC-A1, and SREBP-2.
Intestinal cholesterol metabolism gene expression is significantly associated with postprandial increment in triglycerides, intestinal ApoB48, and reduced postprandial FMD. Some genes were also associated with increased IMT. These findings suggest a role of intestinal cholesterol metabolism in development of early vascular disease.
CVD accounted for 27 % of all deaths in the UK in 2014, and was responsible for 1·7 million hospital admissions in 2013/2014. This condition becomes increasingly prevalent with age, affecting 34·1 and 29·8 % of males and females over 75 years of age respectively in 2011. The dysregulation of cholesterol metabolism with age, often observed as a rise in LDL-cholesterol, has been associated with the pathogenesis of CVD. To compound this problem, it is estimated by 2050, 22 % of the world's population will be over 60 years of age, in culmination with a growing resistance and intolerance to pre-existing cholesterol regulating drugs such as statins. Therefore, it is apparent research into additional therapies for hypercholesterolaemia and CVD prevention is a growing necessity. However, it is also imperative to recognise this complex biological system cannot be studied using a reductionist approach; rather its biological uniqueness necessitates a more integrated methodology, such as that offered by systems biology. In this review, we firstly discuss cholesterol metabolism and how it is affected by diet and the ageing process. Next, we describe therapeutic strategies for hypercholesterolaemia, and finally how the systems biology paradigm can be utilised to investigate how ageing interacts with complex systems such as cholesterol metabolism. We conclude by emphasising the need for nutritionists to work in parallel with the systems biology community, to develop novel approaches to studying cholesterol metabolism and its interaction with ageing.
About 2% of the world population is infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV), a leading cause of hepatic cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. The Niemann-Pick C1-like 1 cholesterol absorption receptor (NPC1L1) was recently identified to be an important factor for HCV entry into host cells. Whether genetic variations of the NPC1L1 gene are associated with HCV infection is unknown.
In this study, five single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the NPC1L1 gene were analyzed in 261 HCV-infected individuals and 265 general controls from Yunnan Province, China.
No significant differences were identified in genotypes or alleles of the SNPs between the two groups. After constructing haplotypes based on the five SNPs, a significant difference between HCV-infected individuals and general controls was shown for two haplotypes. Haplotype GCCTT appeared to be a protective factor and haplotype GCCCT was a risk factor for HCV-infected individuals. Genotypes of four SNPs correlated with biochemical characteristics of HCV-infected persons. Genotypes of SNPs rs799444 and rs2070607 were correlated with total bilirubin. Genotype TT of rs917098 was a risk factor for the gamma-glutamyltransferase level. Furthermore, HCV-infected individuals carrying genotype GG of rs41279633 showed statistically higher gamma-glutamyltransferase levels than HCV-infected persons with GT and TT.
The results of this study identified the association between genetic susceptibility of the NPC1L1 gene and HCV infection, as well as biochemical characteristics of HCV-infected persons in Yunnan, China.
Oxidative stress is important for the pathogenesis of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), a chronic disease that ranges from hepatic steatosis to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). The nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2-Kelch-like ECH associated protein 1 (Nrf2-Keap1) pathway is essential for cytoprotection against oxidative stress. In this study, we found that oxidative stress or inflammatory biomarkers and TUNEL positive cells were markedly increased in NASH patients compared to normal or simple steatosis. In addition, we identified that the hepatic mRNA levels of Nrf2 target genes such as Nqo-1 and GSTA-1 were significantly increased in NASH patients. Ezetimibe, a drug approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia, improves NAFLD and alleviates oxidative stress. However, the precise mechanism of its antioxidant function remains largely unknown. We now demonstrate that ezetimibe activates Nrf2-Keap1 pathway which was dependent of autophagy adaptor protein p62, without causing cytotoxicity. Ezetimibe activates AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), which in turn phosphorylates p62 (p-S351) via their direct interaction. Correspondingly, Ezetimibe protected liver cells from saturated fatty acid-induced apoptotic cell death through p62-dependent Nrf2 activation. Furthermore, its role as an Nrf2 activator was supported by methione- and choline- deficient (MCD) diet-induced NASH mouse model, showing that ezetimibe decreased the susceptibility of the liver to oxidative injury. These data demonstrate that the molecular mechanisms underlying ezetimibe's antioxidant role in the pathogenesis of NASH.
Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is widely considered to be the hepatic manifestation of the metabolic syndrome and is closely linked to dyslipidemia, obesity, and insulin resistance. Patients with NAFLD have increased mortality when compared to the general population, primarily related to cardiovascular disease or malignancy. The biologic mechanisms that link NAFLD to cardiovascular disease include expansion of visceral adipose tissue, atherogenic dyslipidemia, impaired insulin signaling, systemic inflammation, and endothelial dysfunction. Currently, there are no approved therapies for NAFLD. It has recently been hypothesized that reducing the delivery of dietary cholesterol using the hypolipidemic agent, ezetimibe, could benefit patients with NAFLD. By potently inhibiting the Niemann-Pick C1-Like 1 (NPC1L1) sterol receptor on intestinal enterocytes and within the liver, ezetimibe blocks exogenous cholesterol absorption and has been shown to improve biochemical markers of NAFLD, improve insulin sensitivity and decrease hepatic steatosis. This review summarizes the clinical and epidemiological evidence for the relationship between NAFLD and cardiovascular risk and examines the potential therapeutic role of ezetimibe.
Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C)-lowering alleles in or near NPC1L1 or HMGCR, encoding the respective molecular targets of ezetimibe and statins, have previously been used as proxies to study the efficacy of these lipid-lowering drugs. Alleles near HMGCR are associated with a higher risk of type 2 diabetes, similar to the increased incidence of new-onset diabetes associated with statin treatment in randomized clinical trials. It is unknown whether alleles near NPC1L1 are associated with the risk of type 2 diabetes.
To investigate whether LDL-C-lowering alleles in or near NPC1L1 and other genes encoding current or prospective molecular targets of lipid-lowering therapy (ie, HMGCR, PCSK9, ABCG5/G8, LDLR) are associated with the risk of type 2 diabetes.
The associations with type 2 diabetes and coronary artery disease of LDL-C-lowering genetic variants were investigated in meta-analyses of genetic association studies. Meta-analyses included 50 775 individuals with type 2 diabetes and 270 269 controls and 60 801 individuals with coronary artery disease and 123 504 controls. Data collection took place in Europe and the United States between 1991 and 2016.
Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol-lowering alleles in or near NPC1L1, HMGCR, PCSK9, ABCG5/G8, and LDLR.
Odds ratios (ORs) for type 2 diabetes and coronary artery disease.
Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol-lowering genetic variants at NPC1L1 were inversely associated with coronary artery disease (OR for a genetically predicted 1-mmol/L [38.7-mg/dL] reduction in LDL-C of 0.61 [95% CI, 0.42-0.88]; P = .008) and directly associated with type 2 diabetes (OR for a genetically predicted 1-mmol/L reduction in LDL-C of 2.42 [95% CI, 1.70-3.43]; P &lt; .001). For PCSK9 genetic variants, the OR for type 2 diabetes per 1-mmol/L genetically predicted reduction in LDL-C was 1.19 (95% CI, 1.02-1.38; P = .03). For a given reduction in LDL-C, genetic variants were associated with a similar reduction in coronary artery disease risk (I2 = 0% for heterogeneity in genetic associations; P = .93). However, associations with type 2 diabetes were heterogeneous (I2 = 77.2%; P = .002), indicating gene-specific associations with metabolic risk of LDL-C-lowering alleles.
In this meta-analysis, exposure to LDL-C-lowering genetic variants in or near NPC1L1 and other genes was associated with a higher risk of type 2 diabetes. These data provide insights into potential adverse effects of LDL-C-lowering therapy.
Plasma levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) are a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease and are influenced by both heredity and dietary habits. The Niemann-Pick C1 like 1 (NPC1L1) protein mediates efficient dietary cholesterol absorption and contributes to variations in human LDL-C levels.
In the present study, using high throughput sequencing we identified three non-synonymous (NS) variations and 64 synonymous variations in the NPC1L1 gene from subsets of Chinese Han, Uygur and Kazakh populations with high or low LDL-C. Subsequently, three NS variations encoding R174H, V177I and V1284L substitutions were observed only in Uygur and Kazakh individuals with limited maximal plasma LDL-C levels.
In further experiments, we investigated cholesterol-regulated recycling and glycosylation and stability of these NS NPC1L1 variants. However, no significant differences between WT and variant NPC1L1 proteins were observed using in vivo assays in mouse livers with adenovirus-mediated expression, demonstrating that none of the three NPC1L1 NS variants caused decreased uptake of biliary cholesterol.
Simultaneously, these data indicate that R174H, V177I and V1284L NPC1L1 variations in high or low LDL-C individuals may not directly influence cholesterol absorption by NPC1L1.
Besides being a critical tumor suppressor, the TP53 gene also plays a role in metabolism and recent studies in humans have implicated the codon 72 polymorphism of TP53 in this role. Using a humanized knock-in mouse model for these TP53 variants, we show that this polymorphism has a significant impact on the metabolic response to a high-fat diet. 
To utilize previously reported lead SNPs for low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c) levels to find additional loci of importance to statin response, and examine whether genetic predisposition to LDL-c levels associates with differential statin response.
We investigated effects on statin response of 59 LDL-c SNPs, by combining summary level statistics from the Global Lipids Genetics and Genomic Investigation of Statin Therapy consortia.
Lead SNPs for APOE, SORT1 and NPC1L1 were associated with a decreased LDL-c response to statin treatment, as was overall genetic predisposition for increased LDL-c levels as quantified with 59 SNPs, with a 5.4% smaller statin response per standard deviation increase in genetically raised LDL-c levels.
Genetic predisposition for increased LDL-c level may decrease efficacy of statin therapy.
We previously observed that medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs) could reduce body fat mass and improve the metabolism of cholesterol. We hypothesized that MCTs can improve atherosclerosis by promoting the reverse cholesterol transport (RCT) process. Therefore, the objective of this study was to investigate the roles of MCTs in macrophage RCT and the progression of atherosclerosis. To test this hypothesis, 30 4-week-old ApoE-deficient (ApoE(-/-)) mice were randomly divided into 2 groups and fed a diet of 2% MCTs or long-chain triglycerides (LCTs) for 16 weeks. Ten age- and sex-matched C57BL/6J mice were fed a diet of 2% LCTs as the control. Macrophage-to-feces RCT was assessed in vivo by intraperitoneal injection of RAW 264.7 macrophages containing (3)H-labeled cholesterol, and atherosclerotic plaques were measured. The mRNA and protein expressions were determined by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and Western blot analyses, respectively. There was a greater decrease in body fat mass, atherosclerotic plaques, and an improvement in serum lipid profiles. In addition, the MCT mice group showed an increase in (3)H-tracer in the feces and a decrease in the liver. Significantly higher levels of mRNA and protein expression of hepatic ATP-binding cassette transporter A1, ATP-binding cassette transporter G5, cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase, and intestinal ATP-binding cassette transporter G8, as well as lower levels of expression of intestinal Niemann-Pick C1-like 1, were found in the MCT group. These results suggest that MCTs could obviously promote macrophage RCT and improve atherosclerosis in ApoE(-/-) mice, indicating that MCTs have the potential to prevent cardiovascular disease.
Hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections remain major health problems worldwide, with 400-500 million chronically infected people worldwide. Chronic infection results in liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma, the second leading cause of cancer death. Current treatments for HBV limit viral replication without efficiently curing infection. HCV treatment has markedly progressed with the licensing of direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) for HCV cure, yet limited access for the majority of patients is a major challenge. Preventative and curative treatment strategies, aimed at novel targets, are needed for both viruses. Viral entry represents one such target, although detailed knowledge of the entry mechanisms is a prerequisite. For HBV, the recent discovery of the NTCP cell entry factor enabled the establishment of an HBV cell culture model and showed that cyclosporin A and Myrcludex B are NTCP-targeting entry inhibitors. Advances in the understanding of HCV entry revealed it to be a complex process involving many factors, offering several antiviral targets. These include viral envelope proteins E1 and E2, virion-associated lipoprotein ApoE, and cellular factors CD81, SRBI, EGFR, claudin-1, occludin, and the cholesterol transporter NPC1L1. Small molecules targeting SR-BI, EGFR, and NPC1L1 have entered clinical trials, whereas other viral- and host-targeted small molecules, peptides, and antibodies show promise in preclinical models. This review summarizes the current understanding of HBV and HCV entry and describes novel antiviral targets and compounds in different stages of clinical development. Overall, proof-of-concept studies indicate that entry inhibitors are a promising class of antivirals to prevent and treat HBV and HCV infections. 
Objective The objectives of this study were to investigate the mRNA and protein expression of biomarkers related to absorption in the small intestinal mucosa of humans and determine the relationships between small intestinal diseases and nutrition. Methods The study subjects consisted of patients scheduled to undergo double-balloon endoscopy (DBE) or total colonoscopy for suspected gastrointestinal disorder in a clinical practice. Biopsies were taken from apparently normal mucosa in the visible areas of 6 parts of the intestines from the duodenum to the colon. The mRNA expression of specific biomarkers (SGLT1, SGLT5, GIP, GLP, LAT1, LAT2, and NPC1L1) in the mucosa was compared among three patient groups: Inflammation, Tumor, and Control. Results Sixty-six patients participated in this study. Both routes of DBE were performed in 20 patients, in whom biopsy samples were obtained from the mucosa for all sections. There were no remarkable differences in the mRNA expression levels among the 3 groups. However, SGLT1, GIP, GLP, and NPC1L1 exhibited specific distribution patterns. The expression levels of GIP and NPC1L1 were highest in the upper jejunum, but were extremely low in the terminal ileum and colon. A comparison of the mRNA expression profile in each intestinal section revealed that the SGLT1 mRNA expression in the Tumor group and the GIP mRNA expression in the Inflammation group were significantly higher than the corresponding levels in the Control group in the upper jejunum. Conclusion The gastrointestinal mucosa of patients with small bowel diseases can maintain proper nutrient absorption, except in the upper jejunum. 
Intestinal absorption of dietary lipids involves their hydrolysis in the lumen of proximal intestine as well as uptake, intracellular transport and re-assembly of hydrolyzed lipids in enterocytes, leading to the formation and secretion of the lipoproteins chylomicrons and HDL. In this study, we examined the potential involvement of cytosolic lipid droplets (CLD) whose function in the process of lipid absorption is poorly understood.
Intestinal lipid absorption was studied in mouse after gavage. Three populations of CLD were purified by density ultracentrifugations, as well as the brush border membranes, which were analyzed by western-blots. Immunofluorescent localization of membranes transporters or metabolic enzymes, as well as kinetics of CLD production, were also studied in intestine or Caco-2 cells.
We isolated three populations of CLD (ranging from 15 to 1000 nm) which showed differential expression of the major lipid transporters scavenger receptor BI (SR-BI), cluster of differentiation 36 (CD-36), Niemann Pick C-like 1 (NPC1L1), and the ATP-binding cassette transporters ABCG5/G8 but also caveolin 2 and fatty acid binding proteins. The enzyme monoacylglycerol acyltransferase 2 (MGAT2) was identified in the brush border membrane (BBM) in addition to the endoplasmic reticulum, suggesting local synthesis of triglycerides and CLD at both places.
We show a very fast production of CLD by enterocytes associated with a transfer of apical constituents as lipid transporters. Our findings suggest that following their uptake by enterocytes, lipids can be partially metabolized at the BBM and packaged into CLD for their transportation to the ER.
Excitatory amino acid transporter type 3 (EAAT3, also known as SLC1A1) is a high-affinity, Na(+)-dependent glutamate carrier that localizes primarily within the cell and at the apical plasma membrane. Although previous studies have reported proteins and sequence regions involved in EAAT3 trafficking, the detailed molecular mechanism by which EAAT3 is distributed to the correct location still remains elusive. Here, we identify that the YVNGGF sequence in the C-terminus of EAAT3 is responsible for its intracellular localization and apical sorting in rat hepatoma cells CRL1601 and Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells, respectively. We further demonstrate that Numb, a clathrin adaptor protein, directly binds the YVNGGF motif and regulates the localization of EAAT3. Mutation of Y503, N505 and F508 within the YVNGGF motif to alanine residues or silencing Numb by use of small interfering RNA (siRNA) results in the aberrant localization of EAAT3. Moreover, both Numb and the YVNGGF motif mediate EAAT3 endocytosis in CRL1601 cells. In summary, our study suggests that Numb is a pivotal adaptor protein that mediates the subcellular localization of EAAT3 through binding the YxNxxF (where x stands for any amino acid) motif.
The high blood cholesterol level could be prevented by plant stanol ester (Staest) consumption. In addition, the genetic polymorphism of cholesterol transporters might be related with lipid profile and subsequently response to Staest intake.
To investigate the effect of single nucleotide polymorphism in ATP-binding cassette hetero-dimeric G5/G8 (ABCG5/G8) and Niemann-Pick C1 Like1 protein (NPC1L1) gene on LDL-C response subsequent to plant Staest intake in Thai Subjects.
The blood samples were collected from 113 subjects for genotyping. The single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of ABCG5/G8 positions; rs6720173 (Q604E), rs4148211 (C54Y), rs4148217 (T400K), rs3806471 (5’UTR-145), and NPC1L1; positon; rs2072183 (L272L) were analyzed by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) method.
After Staest intake, the subjects with QE genotype (Q604E of ABCG5) showed a 4-fold significant decrease in LDL-C level (14.17±10.67%) compared to subjects with QQ genotype (3.50±10.65%) (p = 0.003). Moreover, the pronounced effect of Q604E polymorphism was observed in subjects after intake of Staest with meal. However, no significant difference in these markers was observed in subjects carrying other mutations.
Thus, it could be suggested that non-synonymous gene polymorphism resulted substitution of uncharged glutamine (Q) with negatively charged glutamic acid (E) at position 604, thereby possibly alter the function of transporter proteins. Besides, the genetic variation in these genes might be related with serum lipid profiles. Moreover, Q604E mutation of ABCG5 in each individual with meal effect could lead to particular response towards LDL-C level after Staest intervention.
Non-cholesterol sterols have been used as markers of cholesterol intestinal absorption and hepatic synthesis, leading to a better understanding of cholesterol homeostasis in humans. This review discusses the main noncholesterol sterols that are clinically useful, different methods to quantify the factors associated with blood concentration, and the potential role of non-cholesterol sterols in the diagnosis and treatment of different types of dyslipidemia. The main indication is the use of non-cholesterol sterols for the diagnosis of rare diseases associated with defects in cholesterol synthesis or anomalies in the absorption and/or elimination of phytosterols. However, other potential uses, including the diagnosis of certain hypercholesterolemias and the individualization of lipid-lowering therapies, are promising as they could help treat a wider population. 
The most common phytosterols in the human diet are sitosterol and campesterol, which originate exclusively from plant derived food. These phytosterols are taken up by NPC1L1 transport from the intestine into the enterocytes together with cholesterol and other xenosterols. Phytosterols are selectively pumped back from the enterocytes into the intestinal lumen and on the liver site from hepatocytes into bile by heterodimeric ABCG5/G8 transporters. Like cholesterol, both phytosterols are prone to ring and side chain oxidation. It could be shown that oxyphytosterols, found in atherosclerotic tissue, are most likely of in situ oxidation (Schött et al.; Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2014 Apr 11;446(3):805-10). However, up to now, the entire mechanism of phytosterol oxidation is not clearly understood. Here, we provide further information about the oxidation of sitosterol and the transport of its oxidation products out of tissue. Our survey includes data of 104 severe aortic stenosis patients that underwent an elective aortic valve cusp replacement. We studied their phytosterol concentrations, as well as absolute and substrate corrected oxyphytosterol levels in plasma and valve cusp tissue. In addition, we also examined phytosterol and oxyphytosterol concentrations in plasma and tissues (from brain and liver) of 10 male ApoE knockout mice. The ratio of 7-oxygenated-sitosterol-to-sitosterol exceeds the ratio for 7-oxygenated-campesterol-to-campesterol in plasma and tissue of both humans and mice. This finding indicates that sitosterol is oxidized to a higher amount than campesterol and that a selective oxidative mechanism might exist which can differentiate between certain phytosterols. Secondly, the concentrations of oxyphytosterols found in plasma and tissue support the idea that oxysitosterols are preferably transported out of individual tissues. Selective oxidation of sitosterol and preferred transport of sitosterol oxidation products out of tissue seem to be a metabolic pathway of forced sitosterol clearance from tissue compartments.
Human NPC1L1 protein mediates cholesterol absorption in the intestine and liver and is the target of the drug ezetimibe, which is used to treat hypercholesterolemia. Previous studies concluded that NPC1L1-GFP protein trafficking is regulated by cholesterol binding and that ezetimibe blocks NPC1L1-GFP function by inhibiting its endocytosis. We used cell surface biotinylation to monitor NPC1L1-GFP endocytosis and show that ezetimibe does not alter the rate of NPC1L1-GFP endocytosis in cultured rat hepatocytes grown under normal growth conditions. As expected, NPC1L1-GFP endocytosis depends in part on C-terminal, cytoplasmically oriented sequences, but endocytosis does not require cholesterol binding to NPC1L1's N-terminal domain. In addition, two small- molecule inhibitors of general (and NPC1L1-GFP) endocytosis failed to inhibit the ezetimibe-sensitive uptake of [(3)H]cholesterol from taurocholate micelles. These experiments demonstrate that cholesterol uptake by NPC1L1 does not require endocytosis; moreover, ezetimibe interferes with NPC1L1's cholesterol adsorption activity without blocking NPC1L1 internalization in RH7777 cells.
Ezetimibe reduces plasma levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol by inhibiting Niemann-Pick C1-like protein 1 (NPC1L1). A recent study demonstrated that NPC1L1 plays an important role in absorption of fat-soluble vitamins including vitamin K. We evaluated whether the add-on treatment of ezetimibe affects anticoagulation in patients taking warfarin. Between October 2007 and March 2015, the administration of ezetimibe was started to a total of 101 outpatients who were already on oral anticoagulation with warfarin. We retrospectively analyzed blood lipid levels, prothrombin time international normalized ratio (PT-INR) and time in therapeutic INR range (TTR). Seventy-one patients (70 %) showed increase in PT-INR after ezetimibe treatment (1.96 ± 0.45 to 2.20 ± 0.61, p &lt; 0.001). It was necessary to reduce the warfarin dose in 9 of 101 patients for clinical indication. There was a significant positive correlation between change in PT-INR and statin usage at baseline (p = 0.03). The mean value of changes in PT-INR of patients with taking statin was significantly larger than that of patients without taking statin (0.34 ± 0.54 vs. 0.06 ± 0.36, p = 0.03). There was an increase in the TTR (52 ± 26 to 61 ± 23 %, p &lt; 0.0001) and a decrease in the frequency to change the dose of warfarin after the ezetimibe treatment [45 times of 735 examination days (6 %) to 20 times of 695 examination days (3 %), p = 0.02]. Our data suggest possible drug interaction between warfarin and ezetimibe. Ezetimibe may increase and stabilize the anticoagulant effect of warfarin, especially in patients taking statins.
Ezetimibe inhibits Niemann-Pick C1-like 1 (NPC1L1), an apical membrane cholesterol transporter of enterocytes, thereby reduces intestinal cholesterol absorption. This treatment also increases extrahepatic reverse cholesterol transport via an undefined mechanism. To explore this, we employed a trans-intestinal cholesterol efflux (TICE) assay, which directly detects circulation-to-intestinal lumen 3H-cholesterol transit in a cannulated jejunal segment, and found an increase of TICE by 45%. To examine whether such increase in efflux occurs at the intestinal brush border membrane(BBM)-level, we performed luminal perfusion assays, similar to TICE but the jejunal wall was labelled with orally-given 3H-cholesterol, and determined elevated BBM-to-lumen cholesterol efflux by 3.5-fold with ezetimibe. Such increased efflux probably promotes circulation-to-lumen cholesterol transit eventually; thus increases TICE. Next, we wondered how inhibition of NPC1L1, an influx transporter, resulted in increased efflux. When we traced orally-given 3H-cholesterol in mice, we found that lumen-to-BBM 3H-cholesterol transit was rapid and less sensitive to ezetimibe treatment. Comparison of the efflux and fractional cholesterol absorption revealed an inverse correlation, indicating the efflux as an opposite-regulatory factor for cholesterol absorption efficiency and counteracting to the naturally-occurring rapid cholesterol influx to the BBM. These suggest that the ezetimibe-stimulated increased efflux is crucial in reducing cholesterol absorption. Ezetimibe-induced increase in cholesterol efflux was approximately 2.5-fold greater in mice having endogenous ATP-binding cassette G5/G8 heterodimer, the major sterol efflux transporter of enterocytes, than the knockout counterparts, suggesting that the heterodimer confers additional rapid BBM-to-lumen cholesterol efflux in response to NPC1L1 inhibition. The observed framework for intestinal cholesterol fluxes may provide ways to modulate the flux to dispose of endogenous cholesterol efficiently for therapeutic purposes. 
Whereas LDL-derived cholesterol accumulates in atherosclerotic lesions, HDL particles are thought to facilitate removal of cholesterol from the lesions back to the liver thereby promoting its fecal excretion from the body. Because generation of cholesterol-loaded macrophages is inherent to atherogenesis, studies on the mechanisms stimulating the release of cholesterol from these cells and its ultimate excretion into feces are crucial to learn how to prevent lesion development or even induce lesion regression. Modulation of this key anti-atherogenic pathway, known as the macrophage-specific reverse cholesterol transport, has been extensively studied in several mouse models with the ultimate aim of applying the emerging knowledge to humans. The present review provides a detailed comparison and critical analysis of the various steps of reverse cholesterol transport in mouse and man. We attempt to translate this in vivo complex scenario into practical concepts, which could serve as valuable tools when developing novel HDL-targeted therapies. 
p53 is well known for its tumor suppressor role, but this protein also has a poorly understood role in the regulation of metabolism. Human studies have implicated a common polymorphism at codon 72 of p53 in diabetic and pre-diabetic phenotypes. To understand this role, we utilized a humanized mouse model of the p53 codon 72 variants and monitored these mice following challenge with a high-fat diet (HFD). Mice with the arginine 72 (R72) variant of p53 developed more-severe obesity and glucose intolerance on a HFD, compared to mice with the proline 72 variant (P72). R72 mice developed insulin resistance, islet hypertrophy, increased infiltration of immune cells, and fatty liver disease. Gene expression analyses and studies with small-molecule inhibitors indicate that the p53 target genes Tnf and Npc1l1 underlie this phenotype. These results shed light on the role of p53 in obesity, metabolism, and inflammation.
Type 2 diabetes is associated with a characteristic dyslipidemia that may exacerbate cardiovascular risk. The causes of, and the effects of new antihyperglycemia medications on, this dyslipidemia, are under investigation. In an unexpected reciprocal manner, lowering LDL-cholesterol with statins slightly increases the risk of diabetes. Here we review the latest findings.
The inverse relationship between LDL-cholesterol and diabetes has now been confirmed by multiple lines of evidence. This includes clinical trials, genetic instruments using aggregate single nucleotide polymorphisms, as well as at least eight individual genes - HMGCR, NPC1L1, HNF4A, GCKR, APOE, PCKS9, TM6SF2, and PNPLA3 - support this inverse association. Genetic and pharmacologic evidence suggest that HDL-cholesterol may also be inversely associated with diabetes risk. Regarding the effects of diabetes on lipoproteins, new evidence suggests that insulin resistance but not diabetes per se may explain impaired secretion and clearance of VLDL-triglycerides. Weight loss, bariatric surgery, and incretin-based therapies all lower triglycerides, whereas SGLT2 inhibitors may slightly increase HDL-cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol.
Diabetes and lipoproteins are highly interregulated. Further research is expected to uncover new mechanisms governing the metabolism of glucose, fat, and cholesterol. This topic has important implications for treating type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease.
Sterols are essential nutrients for eukaryotes. Insects are obligate sterol auxotrophs and must acquire this key nutrient from their diets. The digestive tract is the organ for absorbing nutrients as well as sterols from food. In mice, the Niemann-Pick type C1 Like 1 (NPC1L1) gene is highly expressed in the intestine and is critical for cholesterol absorption. In contrast, the molecular mechanisms for the absorption of dietary sterols in insects have not been well studied. We annotated NPC1 genes in 39 insects from 10 orders using available genomic and transcriptomic information and inferred phylogenetic relationships. Insect NPC1 genes were grouped into two sister-clades, NPC1a and NPC1b, suggesting a likely duplication in the ancestor of insects. The former exhibited weaker gut-biased expression or a complete lack of tissue-biased expression, depending on the species, while the latter was highly enriched in the gut of three lepidopteran species. This result is similar to previous findings in Drosophila melanogaster. In insects, NPC1a accumulated non-synonymous substitutions at a lower rate than NPC1b. This pattern was consistent across orders, indicating that NPC1a evolved under stronger molecular constraint than NPC1b.
High fat diet consumes and thyroid hormones (THs) disorders may affect nutrients metabolism, but their impact on the absorptive epithelium, the first place of nutrients access, remains unknown. Our aim was to evaluate the intestinal morphology and nutrients transporters content in mice fed standard (LFD) or high fat (HFD) diets in hypo or hyperthyroidism-induced condition.
C57BL/6 male mice fed LFD or HFD diets for 12 weeks, followed by saline, PTU (antithyroid drug) or T3 treatment up to 30 days. The mice were euthanized and proximal intestine was removed to study GLUT2, GLUT5, PEPT1, FAT-CD36, FATP4, NPC1L1 and NHE3 distribution by Western blotting. Since PPAR-a is activated by fatty acids, which is abundant in the HFD, we also evaluated whether PPAR-a affects nutrients transporters. Thus, mice were treated with fenofibrate, a PPAR-a agonist.
HFD decreased GLUT2, PEPT1, FAT-CD6 and NPC1L1, but increased NHE3, while GLUT5 and FATP4 remained unaltered. THs did not alter distribution of nutrients transporters neither in LFD nor in HFD groups, but they increased villi length and depth crypt in LFD and HFD, respectively. Fenofibrate did not affect content of nutrients transporters, excluding PPAR-a involvement on the HFD-induced changes.
We assume that chronic HFD consumption reduced most of the nutrients transporters content in the small intestine of mice, which might limit the entrance of nutrients and gain weight. Since NHE3 promotes sodium absorption, and it was increased in HFD group, this finding could contribute to explain the hypertension observed in obesity.
Bofutsushosan (fangfengtongshengsan in Chinese, BTS) is a formula in traditional Japanese Kampo medicine and Chinese medicine comprising 18 crude drugs that is used for treating obesity and metabolic syndrome.
We evaluated the promotive effects of BTS on lipid and cholesterol elimination in mice.
Mice were reared with a high-fat diet containing boiled water extract of BTS for 30 days, and their biochemical parameters as well as the weight and lipid content of feces were measured. We also measured cholesterol uptake into Caco-2 cells cultured with or without BTS extract.
The body weight and amounts of visceral fat and subcutaneous fat on day 28; the weights of epididymal, perirenal, and mesenteric fat; and the serum concentrations of triglyceride, glucose, and hemoglobin A1c on day 30 were significantly lower in the BTS extract-treated groups than in the control in a dose-dependent manner. The amounts of lipid and cholesterol in the feces collected from day 6-23 were significantly greater than in the control. When Caco-2 cells were incubated with BTS extract, the uptake of cholesterol into cells was significantly reduced in a concentration-dependent manner. Among the components of BTS, the methanol extracts of Platycodi Radix and Zingiberis Rhizoma contribute but the extracts of Ephedrae Herba and Rhei Rhizoma counteract the suppressive effect of BTS on cholesterol uptake into Caco-2 cells.
BTS has beneficial effects on obesity and metabolic syndrome, and its mechanisms of action include the promotion of lipid elimination and the inhibition of cholesterol absorption in the intestine.
The hypocholesterolemic effect of Lonicera caerulea berry extract rich in polyphenols (LCBP) on high cholesterol-induced hypercholesterolemia and lipoprotein metabolite changes was examined in Caco-2 cells and rats. Cyanidin-3-glucoside, catechin, and chlorogenic acid are the major phenolic components of LCBP. The cholesterol-reducing effect and antioxidant capacity of these components were compared in Caco-2 cells. LCBP (80 μg/mL) and cyanidin-3-glucoside, catechin, and chlorogenic acid (50 μM) were found to be effective (p &lt; 0.05). Rats were fed a high cholesterol diet (HCD) with or without LCBP supplementation (75, 150, and 300 mg/kg body weight intragastrically once daily) for 12 weeks. Compared with the HCD control group, LCBP supplementation at 150 and 300 mg/kg decreased the levels of TC, TG, and LDL-C, but increased that of HDL-C. LCBP treatment promoted greater neutral and acidic sterol excretion (p &lt; 0.05) and improved the antioxidant capacity of the colon tissue, colon contents, and blood. Moreover, trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) levels were decreased in serum (p &lt; 0.05). NPC1L1, ACAT2, and MTP mRNA and protein expression were reduced and ABCG5/8 expression was increased (p &lt; 0.05) after LCBP treatment. Our results suggest that LCBP could be used as a functional food for the prevention and treatment of diseases related to excessive cholesterol accumulation.
This work studied the cell transport of peptidase-generated peptides from cowpea bean proteins and their effects on mRNA expression of cholesterol-related genes in intestinal and liver cells. The ≤3 kDa hydrolysate was obtained and incubated with Caco-2 intestinal cells using Transwell® plates. HepG2 liver cells were incubated with synthetic analogues of peptides (MELNAVSVVHS and MELNAVSVVSH) identified by "de novo" peptide sequencing in the Caco-2 monolayer permeates. The mRNA expression of NPC1L1, ABCA1 and ABCG1 was measured in Caco-2 cells, in the presence or absence of ≤3 kDa hydrolysate and the expression of HMGCR, SREBP2, LXRα, AMPK1, was determined in the HepG2 cells in the presence or absence of synthetic peptides. Exposure of Caco-2 cells to cowpea ≤3 kDa hydrolysate (2.5 and 5 mg/mL) increased ABCG1 expression at 6 h and 12 h. SREBP2, HMGCR and LDLR mRNA levels were reduced in HepG2 cells after 24 h of treatment with MELNAVSVVHS peptide (50 μM and 100 μM). These results suggest that MELNAVSVVHS peptide is able to cross intestinal barrier and to modulate genes involved in cholesterol homeostasis.
Obesity is associated with a series of metabolic complications, including dyslipidemia and insulin resistance (IR) that lack effective therapies. In recent years, intestinal inflammation has been suggested to contribute to obesity related metabolic syndrome and targeting gut inflammation with 5-ASA improves diet induced IR, however, its role in dyslipidemia is unknown and has never been explored. In the present study, we reported for the first time that administration of 5-ASA for 12 weeks significantly improved lipid profile by repressing plasma triglycerides and free cholesterol levels in mice fed high-fat cholesterol diet (HFC). In addition, liver lipids were significantly reduced by 5-ASA treatment in HFC-fed mice. Mechanistically, anti-inflammatory genes peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (Pparγ) and M2 marker, such as Mrc1 and Ym1, were remarkably upregulated, while pro-inflammation gene monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (Mcp-1) were downregulated in small intestine of mice treated by 5-ASA. Further, 5-ASA improved gastrointestinal barrier by increasing the expression of the tight junction marker ZO-1. 5-ASA also enhanced cholesterol translocation by elevating genes expression of Npc1l1 and Abcg5/8. Moreover, mice fed HFC 5-ASA expressed increased Pparα in small intestinal and its target genes function in lipid oxidation and hydrolysis were remarkable elevated. Taken together, we reported a novel role of 5-ASA which may serve as a therapy target intestinal inflammation induced dyslipidemia.
In this work we aim to show how Genome Scale Metabolic Models (GSMMs) can be used as tools for drug design. By comparing the chemical structures of human metabolites (obtained using their KEGG indexes) and the compounds contained in the DrugBank database, we have observed that compounds showing Tanimoto scores higher than 0.9 with a metabolite, are 29.5 times more likely to bind the enzymes metabolizing the considered metabolite, than ligands chosen randomly. By using RNA-seq data to constrain a human GSMM it is possible to obtain an estimation of its distribution of metabolic fluxes and to quantify the effects of restraining the rate of chosen metabolic reactions (for example using a drug that inhibits the enzymes catalyzing the mentioned reactions). This method allowed us to predict the differential effects of lipoamide analogs on the proliferation of MCF7 (a breast cancer cell line) and ASM (airway smooth muscle) cells respectively. These differential effects were confirmed experimentally, which provides a proof of concept of how human GSMMs could be used to find therapeutic windows against cancer. By using RNA-seq data of 34 different cancer cell lines and 26 healthy tissues, we assessed the putative anticancer effects of the compounds in DrugBank which are structurally similar to human metabolites. Among other results it was predicted that the mevalonate pathway might constitute a good therapeutic window against cancer proliferation, due to the fact that most cancer cell lines do not express the cholesterol transporter NPC1L1 and the lipoprotein lipase LPL, which makes them rely on the mevalonate pathway to obtain cholesterol.
Hyperlipidemia characterized of elevated serum lipid levels is a prevalent disease frequently resulting in cardiovascular disease (CVD). Berberine and evodiamine are herbal products of traditional Chinese herb Coptis chinensis and Evodia rutaecarpa, which are indicated to exert regulation of lipid metabolism. Therefore, the objective of this study was to investigate the lipid-lowering effect of berberine and evodiamine combination in hyperlipidemic rats.
The rat model of hyperlipidemia was established by providing high-fat-diet (HFD) for 4 weeks. Berberine (BB), evodiamine (EV), and their combination (BB + EV) were orally administered to HFD induced rats for 4 weeks. Body weight, food utilization, histopathology of liver tissues, lipid profiles of serum and liver were measured. Gas chromatography (GC) analysis was applied to examine the level of plasma total cholesterol and ß- Sitosterol (BS) to estimate cholesterol absorption activity. Furthermore, intestinal NPC1L1, ACAT2, and ApoB48 protein expressions were evaluated by immunohistochemical assay.
According to the results, decreased levels of serum cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), low density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C), as well as hepatic TC were showed in hyperlipidemic rats treated by combination of berberine and evodiamine. GC analysis indicated that the elevated plasma BS was significantly ameliorated by BB, EV, and BB + EV. In addition, immunohistochemical analysis revealed that BB + EV treatment down-regulated the expressions of intestinal NPC1L1 and ACAT2, and ApoB48 in HFD induced rats.
Based on the above results, combination of berberine and evodiamine exerted a promising preventive effect on hyperlipidemia, partially through inhibiting intestinal absorption of cholesterol.
Preclinical models based on patient-derived xenografts have remarkable specificity in distinguishing transformed human tumor cells from non-transformed murine stromal cells computationally. We obtained 29 pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) xenografts from either resectable or non-resectable patients (surgery and endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspirate, respectively). Extensive multiomic profiling revealed two subtypes with distinct clinical outcomes. These subtypes uncovered specific alterations in DNA methylation and transcription as well as in signaling pathways involved in tumor-stromal cross-talk. The analysis of these pathways indicates therapeutic opportunities for targeting both compartments and their interactions. In particular, we show that inhibiting NPC1L1 with Ezetimibe, a clinically available drug, might be an efficient approach for treating pancreatic cancers. These findings uncover the complex and diverse interplay between PDAC tumors and the stroma and demonstrate the pivotal role of xenografts for drug discovery and relevance to PDAC.
Results from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have raised concern that the cholesterol-lowering drug ezetimibe might increase the risk of cancer. We tested the hypothesis that genetic variation in NPC1L1, mimicking treatment with ezetimibe, was associated with an increased risk of cancer.
We included 67 257 individuals from the general population. Of these, 8333 developed cancer and 2057 died of cancer from 1968 to 2011. To mimic the effect of ezetimibe, we calculated weighted allele scores based on the low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol-lowering(= NPC1L1-inhibitory) effect of each variant. We tested the associations of the NPC1L1 allele scores with LDL cholesterol and with risk of any cancer, death from any cancer and 27 site-specific cancers. As a positive control, we tested the association of the NPC1L1 allele scores with risk of ischaemic vascular disease (IVD).
The NPC1L1 allele scores did not associate with risk of any cancer, death from any cancer or with any of 27 site-specific cancers. Hazard ratios (HRs) for a 1-unit increase in internally weighted allele scores were 1.00 (95% confidence interval: 0.98-1.02) for any cancer, and 1.02 (0.98-1.06) for cancer death. The corresponding HR for IVD was 0.97 (0.94-0.99). Results were similar for an externally weighted allele score and for a simple allele count. Finally, the null association with cancer was robust in sensitivity analyses.
Lifelong, genetic inhibition of NPC1L1, mimicking treatment with ezetimibe, does not associate with risk of cancer. These results suggest that long-term treatment with ezetimibe is unlikely to increase the risk of cancer, in agreement with the overall evidence from ezetimibe RCTs.
In the context of the global prevalence of vitamin D insufficiency, we compared two key determinants of the bioavailability of 3 vitamin D forms with significant biopotencies: cholecalciferol, 25-hydroxycholecalciferol and 1-α-hydroxycholecalciferol. To this aim, we studied their incorporation into synthetic mixed micelles and their uptake by intestinal cells in culture. Our results show that 1-α-hydroxycholecalciferol was significantly more solubilized into mixed micelles compared to the other forms (1.6-fold and 2.9-fold improvement compared to cholecalciferol and 25-hydroxycholecalciferol, respectively). In Caco-2 TC7 cells, the hydroxylated forms were taken up more efficiently than cholecalciferol (p &lt; 0.05), and conversely to cholecalciferol, their uptake was neither SR-BI(Scavenger-Receptor class B type I)- nor NPC1L1 (NPC1 like intracellular cholesterol transporter 1)-dependent. Besides, the apical membrane sodium-bile acid transporter ASBT (Apical Sodium-dependent Bile acid Transporter) was not involved, at least in vitro, in the uptake of any of the three vitamin D forms. Further investigations are needed to identify the uptake pathways of both 1-α-hydroxycholecalciferol and 25-hydroxycholecalciferol. However, considering its high bioavailability, our results suggest the potential interest of using 1-α-hydroxycholecalciferol in the treatment of severe vitamin D deficiency.
Fasting and postprandial hypertriglyceridemia (PHTG) are caused by the accumulation of triglyceride (TG)-rich lipoproteins and their remnants, which have atherogenic effects. Fibrates can improve fasting and PHTG; however, reduction of remnants is clinically needed to improve health outcomes. In the current study, we investigated the effects of a novel selective peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α modulator (SPPARMα), K-877 (Pemafibrate), on PHTG and remnant metabolism.
Male C57BL/6J mice were fed a high-fat diet (HFD) only, or an HFD containing 0.0005% K-877 or 0.05% fenofibrate, from 8 to 12 weeks of age. After 4 weeks of feeding, we measured plasma levels of TG, free fatty acids (FFA), total cholesterol (TC), HDL-C, and apolipoprotein (apo) B-48/B-100 during fasting and after oral fat loading (OFL). Plasma lipoprotein profiles after OFL, which were assessed by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), and fasting lipoprotein lipase (LPL) activity were compared among the groups.
Both K-877 and fenofibrate suppressed body weight gain and fasting and postprandial TG levels and enhanced LPL activity in mice fed an HFD. As determined by HPLC, K-877 and fenofibrate significantly decreased the abundance of TG-rich lipoproteins, including remnants, in postprandial plasma. Both K-877 and fenofibrate decreased intestinal mRNA expression of ApoB and Npc1l1; however, hepatic expression of Srebp1c and Mttp was increased by fenofibrate but not by K-877.Hepatic mRNA expression of apoC-3 was decreased by K-877 but not by fenofibrate.
K-877 may attenuate PHTG by suppressing the postprandial increase of chylomicrons and the accumulation of chylomicron remnants more effectively than fenofibrate.
ATP citrate lyase is an enzyme in the cholesterol-biosynthesis pathway upstream of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (HMGCR), the target of statins. Whether the genetic inhibition of ATP citrate lyase is associated with deleterious outcomes and whether it has the same effect, per unit decrease in the low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol level, as the genetic inhibition of HMGCR is unclear.
We constructed genetic scores composed of independently inherited variants in the genes encoding ATP citrate lyase (ACLY) and HMGCR to create instruments that mimic the effect of ATP citrate lyase inhibitors and HMGCR inhibitors (statins), respectively. We then compared the associations of these genetic scores with plasma lipid levels, lipoprotein levels, and the risk of cardiovascular events and cancer.
A total of 654,783 participants, including 105,429 participants who had major cardiovascular events, were included in the study. The ACLY and HMGCR scores were associated with similar patterns of changes in plasma lipid and lipoprotein levels and with similar effects on the risk of cardiovascular events per decrease of 10 mg per deciliter in the LDL cholesterol level: odds ratio for cardiovascular events, 0.823 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.78 to 0.87; P = 4.0×10-14) for the ACLY score and 0.836 (95% CI, 0.81 to 0.87; P = 3.9×10-19) for the HMGCR score. Neither lifelong genetic inhibition of ATP citrate lyase nor lifelong genetic inhibition of HMGCR was associated with an increased risk of cancer.
Genetic variants that mimic the effect of ATP citrate lyase inhibitors and statins appeared to lower plasma LDL cholesterol levels by the same mechanism of action and were associated with similar effects on the risk of cardiovascular disease per unit decrease in the LDL cholesterol level.

Mustard kimchi consumption reduces cholesterol levels in rats. To identify lactic acid bacteria (LAB) in kimchi which exert this effect, 20 LAB isolates were evaluated for cholesterol reduction in an in vitro screen. The FB111 strain showed the highest cholesterol-lowering activity and was identified as Leuconostoc mesenteroides. This strain was characterized as a potential probiotic through sequential analyses for resistance to gastrointestinal digestion and bile salts, and adhesion to Caco-2 cells. The Caco-2 cells treated with L. mesenteroides FB111 (6-8 log CFU/mL) showed toxicological effect. The reduction of cholesterol uptake in these cells was inhibited by 48.6% compared to the control and significantly higher than that of the Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG) strain-treated group after 2-h incubation. The levels of NPC1L1, ABCG5, ABCG8, SREBP-1, SREBP-2, and PPARα gene expression were determined by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis. The L. mesenteroides FB111 and LGG inhibited the mRNA expression of NPC1L1 (P &lt; 0.05), whereas the expression of PPARα was increased. Moreover, the FB111 strain also inhibited the expression of SREBP-2 mRNA. Overall, we found that L. mesenteroides FB111 has efficient cholesterol-lowering effects and might be useful as a probiotic in the food industry.
Gene vectors for oral delivery encounter harsh conditions throughout the gastrointestinal tract, and the continuous peristaltic activity can quickly remove the vectors, leading to inefficient intestinal permeation. Therefore, vectors have demanding property requirements, such as stability under various pH and, more importantly, efficient uptake in different intestinal segments. In this study, a functional polymer, cholesterol-grafted poly(β-amino ester) (poly[hexamethylene diacrylate-β-(5-amino-1-pentanol)] (CH-PHP)), is synthesized and electrostatically interacted with plasmid DNA to form a CH-PHP/DNA complex (CPNC). This complex is designed to target the Niemann-Pick C1-like receptor, a cholesterol receptor, to improve oral gene delivery efficacy. With the presence of cholesterol, CH-PHP shows mitigated cytotoxicity, enhanced enzyme resistance, and improved gene condensing ability. CPNC further contributes to ≈43.1- and 2.3-fold increases in luciferase expression in Caco-2 cells compared with PNC and Lipo 2000/DNA complexes, respectively. In addition, the in vivo transfection efficacy of CPNC is ≈4.1-, 2.1-, and 1.6-fold higher than that of Lipo 2000/DNA complexes in rat duodenum, jejunum, and ileum, respectively. Therefore, CPNC may be a promising delivery vector for gene delivery, and using a cholesterol-specific endocytic pathway can be a novel approach to achieve efficient oral gene transfection.
Oxycholesterols (OCs) are produced from cholesterol by oxidation of the steroidal backbone and side-chain. OCs are present in blood and evidence suggests their involvement in disease development and progression. However, limited information is available regarding the absorption mechanisms and relative absorption rates of dietary OCs. Although ezetimibe is known to inhibit intestinal cholesterol absorption via Niemann-Pick C1-Like 1 (NPC1L1), whether it also inhibits dietary OC absorption is unclear.
We investigated the effects of ezetimibe on OC absorption in rats fed an OC-rich diet containing 10 different OCs. We collected lymphatic fluid using permanent cannulation of the thoracic duct and quantified OC levels.
Ezetimibe treatment significantly reduced the apparent absorption of 5β,6β-epoxycholesterol (5,6β-epoxy) and its levels in the proximal intestinal mucosa in OC-fed rats. Using in silico analyses, the binding energy of NPC1L1 N-terminal domain (NPC1L1-NTD) and 5,6β-epoxy was found to be similar to that of NPC1L1-NTD and cholesterol, suggesting that polar uncharged amino acids located in the steroidal part of 5,6β-epoxy were involved.
Our results indicate that ezetimibe-mediated inhibition of dietary OC absorption varies depending on the specific OC, and only the absorption of 5,6β-epoxy is significantly reduced.
Warfarin is an anticoagulant drug used to prevent thromboembolic disorders, but its pharmacological effect is affected by co-administered drugs. Therefore, careful management of warfarin-related drug-drug interactions (DDIs) is necessary for its safety and effectiveness. Recently, intestinal vitamin K1absorption through the Niemann-Pick C1-like 1 (NPC1L1)-mediated pathway was found to affect the pharmacological effect of warfarin. This study aimed to identify high-frequency warfarin-related DDIs in a clinical setting and elucidate their mechanism(s) in terms of changes in NPC1L1 expression and/or activity. Methods and Results: Prednisolone was the most frequently suspected drug in retrospective surveys of medical records of patients who experienced warfarin-related DDIs. Prednisolone significantly increased the international normalized ratio of prothrombin time (PT-INR) values in warfarin-treated patients. To demonstrate the involvement of NPC1L1 in warfarin-prednisolone DDI, we conducted an in vitro vitamin K1uptake assay using NPC1L1-overexpressing cells and found that prednisolone inhibited NPC1L1-mediated vitamin K1uptake. Additionally, we found that prednisolone downregulates NPC1L1 in a glucocorticoid receptor α-dependent manner.
Co-administration of warfarin and prednisolone frequently enhanced the anticoagulant effect of warfarin in a clinical setting. Prednisolone-mediated suppression of NPC1L1 expression and activity could be the mechanism of DDI between warfarin and prednisolone. To manage warfarin therapy, the potential of concomitant drugs to change its anticoagulant effect through NPC1L1-related mechanisms merits consideration.
Pharmacological enhancers of lipoprotein lipase (LPL) are in preclinical or early clinical development for cardiovascular prevention. Studying whether these agents will reduce cardiovascular events or diabetes risk when added to existing lipid-lowering drugs would require large outcome trials. Human genetics studies can help prioritize or deprioritize these resource-demanding endeavors.
To investigate the independent and combined associations of genetically determined differences in LPL-mediated lipolysis and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) metabolism with risk of coronary disease and diabetes.
In this genetic association study, individual-level genetic data from 392 220 participants from 2 population-based cohort studies and 1 case-cohort study conducted in Europe were included. Data were collected from January 1991 to July 2018, and data were analyzed from July 2014 to July 2018.
Six conditionally independent triglyceride-lowering alleles in LPL, the p.Glu40Lys variant in ANGPTL4, rare loss-of-function variants in ANGPTL3, and LDL-C-lowering polymorphisms at 58 independent genomic regions, including HMGCR, NPC1L1, and PCSK9.
Odds ratio for coronary artery disease and type 2 diabetes.
Of the 392 220 participants included, 211 915 (54.0%) were female, and the mean (SD) age was 57 (8) years. Triglyceride-lowering alleles in LPL were associated with protection from coronary disease (approximately 40% lower odds per SD of genetically lower triglycerides) and type 2 diabetes (approximately 30% lower odds) in people above or below the median of the population distribution of LDL-C-lowering alleles at 58 independent genomic regions, HMGCR, NPC1L1, or PCSK9. Associations with lower risk were consistent in quintiles of the distribution of LDL-C-lowering alleles and 2 × 2 factorial genetic analyses. The 40Lys variant in ANGPTL4 was associated with protection from coronary disease and type 2 diabetes in groups with genetically higher or lower LDL-C. For a genetic difference of 0.23 SDs in LDL-C, ANGPTL3 loss-of-function variants, which also have beneficial associations with LPL lipolysis, were associated with greater protection against coronary disease than other LDL-C-lowering genetic mechanisms (ANGPTL3 loss-of-function variants: odds ratio, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.52-0.83; 58 LDL-C-lowering variants: odds ratio, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.89-0.91; P for heterogeneity = .009).
Triglyceride-lowering alleles in the LPL pathway are associated with lower risk of coronary disease and type 2 diabetes independently of LDL-C-lowering genetic mechanisms. These findings provide human genetics evidence to support the development of agents that enhance LPL-mediated lipolysis for further clinical benefit in addition to LDL-C-lowering therapy.
Vitamin E is an essential molecule for our development and health. It has long been thought that it was absorbed and transported through cellular membranes by a passive diffusion process. However, data obtained during the past 15 years showed that its absorption is actually mediated, at least in part, by cholesterol membrane transporters including the scavenger receptor class B type I (SR-BI), CD36 molecule (CD36), NPC1-like transporter 1 (NPC1L1), and ATP-binding cassettes A1 and G1 (ABCA1 and ABCG1). This review focuses on the absorption process of vitamin E across the enterocyte. A special attention is given to the regulation of this process, including the possible competition with other fat-soluble micronutrients, and the modulation of transporter expressions. Overall, recent results noticeably increased the comprehension of vitamin E intestinal transport, but additional investigations are still required to fully appreciate the mechanisms governing vitamin E bioavailability. © 2018 IUBMB Life, 71(4):416-423, 2019.
Despite high-risk behaviour, 10%-20% of HCV multiple exposed individuals remain uninfected (MEU), whilst the remainder become infected (MEI). We hypothesize that host factors play a role in HCV susceptibility. We aimed to identify polymorphisms in host genes that encode for proteins involved in viral entry: CD81, Scavenger receptor 1 (SR-1), Low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDL-R), Claudin-1 (CLDN1), Occludin (OCLN) and Niemann-Pick C1-like 1 (NPC1L1).
Multiple exposed infected and MEU from two observational cohorts were selected. From the MSM study of acute infection with HCV (MOSAIC), HIV-1 infected MEU cases (n = 30) and HIV-1 infected MEI controls (n = 32) were selected based on reported high-risk behaviour. From the Amsterdam Cohorts Studies (ACS) injecting drug users (IDU) cohort, MEU cases (n = 40) and MEI controls (n = 22) were selected who injected drugs for ≥2 years, in the nineties, when HCV incidence was high. Selected single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were determined by sequencing or SNP assays.
No associations were found for SNPs within genes coding for CD81, SR-1, Claudin-1 or Occludin between the MEU and MEI individuals from either cohort. We did observe a significant association for rs688 within the LDL-R gene with HCV infection (OR: 0.41 P = 0.001), however, LDL cholesterol levels did not vary between individuals carrying the differential SNPs. Additionally, a marginal significant effect was found for rs217434 and rs2072183 (OR: 2.07 P = 0.032 and OR: 1.76 P = 0.039, respectively) within NPC1L1.
Our results demonstrate that the rs688 SNP within the LDL-R gene associates with HCV susceptibility through mucosal as well as intravenous exposure.
Cholesterol-lowering activity is an important health benefit of lactic acid bacteria (LAB). This study aimed to screen LAB strains with cholesterol-lowering activities from salted fermented shrimp and evaluate probiotic characteristics and cholesterol-lowering potentials of these LAB isolates. Among 191 lactic acid strains isolated from traditional salted-fermented shrimp food, FB003 isolate showed the highest cholesterol-lowering activity and investigated as probiotics with cholesterol-lowering ability. Biochemical analysis and 16S rRNA sequencing revealed that this LAB isolate was Lactobacillus plantarum FB003. To screen probiotic trait, L. plantarum FB003 was found to be susceptible to six antibiotics tested and broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity. It also produced various enzymes such as galactosidase, glucosidase, and mannosidase. In addition, this strain showed autoaggregation, and coaggregation capacity for various pathogens. Moreover, it could adhere to Caco-2 cells and be exerted lowering cholesterol effects in Caco-2 cells via an upregulation of PPARα to inhibit NPC1L1 mRNA expression. Strain L. plantarum FB003 might be effective as a candidate probiotic with high cholesterol-lowering activity. The results of the present study suggest that L. plantarum FB003 have an impact on preventing high cholesterol level and may be used as starter culture for shrimp fermentation.
Absorption mechanisms of phytoene (PT) and phytofluene (PTF) are poorly known. The main objectives of the study are to measure their micellization and intestinal cell uptake efficiencies and to compare them to those of commonly consumed carotenoids. Other objectives are to assess the involvement of protein(s) in their cellular uptake and whether they compete with other carotenoids for micellization and cellular uptake.
Tomato-extract-purified PT and PTF, mainly present as cis-isomers, are much better incorporated in synthetic mixed micelles than pure all-trans lycopene. PT impairs lycopene micellization (-56%, P &lt; 0.05) while PT and PTF do not significantly affect the micellization of other carotenoids, and vice versa. At low concentration, Caco-2 PTF uptake is higher (P &lt; 0.05) than that of PT and lycopene (29%, 21%, and not detectable). SR-BI, but not CD36 neither NPC1L1, is involved in PT and PTF uptake. PT and PTF impair (p &lt; 0.05) β-carotene uptake (-13 and -22%, respectively).
The high bioaccessibility of PT and PTF can be partly explained by their high micellization efficiency, which is likely due to their natural cis isomerization and/or to their high molecular flexibility. SR-BI is involved in their cellular uptake, which can explain competitions with other carotenoids.
Recent studies have highlighted the possible risk of neuropsychiatric adverse effects during treatment with lipid-lowering medications. However, there are still controversies that require a novel genetic-based approach to verify whether the impact of lipid-lowering drug treatment results in neuropsychiatric troubles including insomnia, depression, and neuroticism. Thus, we applied Mendelian randomization to assess any potential neuropsychiatric adverse effects of conventional lipid-lowering drugs such as statins, proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors, and ezetimibe.
A 2-sample Mendelian randomization study was conducted based on summary statistics from genome-wide association studies for lipids, insomnia, depression, and neuroticism. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms located in or near drug target genes of HMGCR, PCSK9, and NPC1L1 were used as proxies for statins, PCSK9 inhibitors, and ezetimibe therapy, respectively. To assess the validity of the genetic risk score, their associations with coronary artery disease were used as a positive control.
The Mendelian randomization analysis showed a statistically significant (P &lt;.004) increased risk of depression after correcting for multiple testing with both statins (odds ratio=1.15, 95% CI: 1.04-1.19) and PCSK9 inhibitor treatment (odds ratio =1.19, 95%CI: 1.1-1.29). The risk of neuroticism was slightly reduced with statin therapy (odds ratio=0.9, 95%CI: 0.83-0.97). No significant adverse effects were associated with ezetimibe treatment. As expected, the 3 medications significantly reduced the risk of coronary artery disease.
Using a genetic-based approach, this study showed an increased risk of depression during statin and PCSK9 inhibitor therapy while their association with insomnia risk was not significant.
The sorting receptor Sortilin functions in the regulation of glucose and lipid metabolism. Dysfunctional lipid uptake, storage, and metabolism contribute to several major human diseases including atherosclerosis and obesity. Sortilin associates with cardiovascular disease; however, the role of Sortilin in adipose tissue and lipid metabolism remains unclear. Here we show that in the low-density lipoprotein receptor-deficient (Ldlr-/-) atherosclerosis model, Sortilin deficiency (Sort1-/-) in female mice suppresses Niemann-Pick type C1-Like 1 (Npc1l1) mRNA levels, reduces body and white adipose tissue weight, and improves brown adipose tissue function partially via transcriptional downregulation of Krüppel-like factor 4 and Liver X receptor. Female Ldlr-/-Sort1-/- mice on a high-fat/cholesterol diet had elevated plasma Fibroblast growth factor 21 and Adiponectin, an adipokine that when reduced is associated with obesity and cardiovascular disease-related factors. Additionally, Sort1 deficiency suppressed cholesterol absorption in both female mice ex vivo intestinal tissue and human colon Caco-2 cells in a similar manner to treatment with the NPC1L1 inhibitor ezetimibe. Together our findings support a novel role of Sortilin in energy regulation and lipid homeostasis in female mice, which may be a potential therapeutic target for obesity and cardiovascular disease.
A high concentration of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Although LDL-C levels vary among humans and are heritable, the genetic factors affecting LDL-C are not fully characterized. We identified a rare frameshift variant in the LIMA1 (also known as EPLIN or SREBP3) gene from a Chinese family of Kazakh ethnicity with inherited low LDL-C and reduced cholesterol absorption. In a mouse model, LIMA1 was mainly expressed in the small intestine and localized on the brush border membrane. LIMA1 bridged NPC1L1, an essential protein for cholesterol absorption, to a transportation complex containing myosin Vb and facilitated cholesterol uptake. Similar to the human phenotype, Lima1-deficient mice displayed reduced cholesterol absorption and were resistant to diet-induced hypercholesterolemia. Through our study of both mice and humans, we identify LIMA1 as a key protein regulating intestinal cholesterol absorption.
In the last decade, over 175 genetic loci have robustly been associated to levels of major circulating blood lipids. Most loci are specific to one or two lipids, whereas some (SUGP1, ZPR1, TRIB1, HERPUD1, and FADS1) are associated to all. While exposing the polygenic architecture of circulating lipids and the underpinnings of dyslipidaemia, these genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have provided further evidence of the critical role that lipids play in coronary heart disease (CHD) risk, as indicated by the 2.7-fold enrichment for macrophage gene expression in atherosclerotic plaques and the association of 25 loci (such as PCSK9, APOB, ABCG5-G8, KCNK5, LPL, HMGCR, NPC1L1, CETP, TRIB1, ABO, PMAIP1-MC4R, and LDLR) with CHD. These GWAS also confirmed known and commonly used therapeutic targets, including HMGCR (statins), PCSK9 (antibodies), and NPC1L1 (ezetimibe). As we head into the post-GWAS era, we offer suggestions for how to move forward beyond genetic risk loci, towards refining the biology behind the associations and identifying causal genes and therapeutic targets. Deep phenotyping through lipidomics and metabolomics will refine and increase the resolution to find causal and druggable targets, and studies aimed at demonstrating gene transcriptional and regulatory effects of lipid associated loci will further aid in identifying these targets. Thus, we argue the need for deeply phenotyped, large genetic association studies to reduce costs and failures and increase the efficiency of the drug discovery pipeline. We conjecture that in the next decade a paradigm shift will tip the balance towards a data-driven approach to therapeutic target development and the application of precision medicine where human genomics takes centre stage.
The molecular events linking lipid accumulation in atherosclerotic plaques to complications such as aneurysm formation and plaque disruption are poorly understood. BALB/c-Apoe(-/-) mice bearing a null mutation in the Npc1 gene display prominent medial erosion and atherothrombosis, whereas their macrophages accumulate free cholesterol in late endosomes and show increased cathepsin K (Ctsk) expression. We now show increased cathepsin K immunostaining and increased cysteinyl proteinase activity using near infrared fluorescence imaging over proximal aortas of Apoe(-/-), Npc1(-/-) mice. In mechanistic studies, cholesterol loading of macrophage plasma membranes (cyclodextrin-cholesterol) or endosomal system (AcLDL+U18666A or Npc1 null mutation) activated Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling, leading to sustained phosphorylation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase and induction of p38 targets, including Ctsk, S100a8, Mmp8, and Mmp14. Studies in macrophages from knockout mice showed major roles for TLR4, following plasma membrane cholesterol loading, and for TLR3, after late endosomal loading. TLR signaling via p38 led to phosphorylation and activation of the transcription factor Microphthalmia transcription factor, acting at E-box elements in the Ctsk promoter. These studies suggest that free cholesterol enrichment of either plasma or endosomal membranes in macrophages leads to activation of signaling via various TLRs, prolonged p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase activation, and induction of Mmps, Ctsk, and S100a8, potentially contributing to plaque complications.
In C. elegans, steroid hormones function in conjunction with insulin/IGF-1-like signaling in promoting reproductive development over entry into the diapausal dauer stage. The NCR-1 and -2 (NPC1-related) intracellular cholesterol transporters function redundantly in preventing dauer arrest, presumably by regulating the availability of substrates for steroid hormone synthesis. We have identified hsd-1 as a new component of this cholesterol trafficking/processing pathway, using an ncr-1 enhancer screen. HSD-1 is orthologous to 3beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase/Delta(5)-Delta(4) isomerases (3beta-HSDs), which are key steroidogenic enzymes in vertebrates, and is exclusively expressed in two neuron-like XXX cells that are crucial in preventing dauer arrest, suggesting that it is involved in biosynthesis of dauer-preventing steroid hormones. The hsd-1 null mutant displays defects in inhibiting dauer arrest: it forms dauers in the deletion mutant backgrounds of ncr-1 or daf-28/insulin; as a single mutant, it is hypersensitive to dauer pheromone. We found that hsd-1 defects can be rescued by feeding mutant animals with several steroid intermediates that are either downstream of or in parallel to the 3beta-HSD function in the dafachronic acid biosynthetic pathway, suggesting that HSD-1 functions as a 3beta-HSD. Interestingly, sterols that rescued hsd-1 defects also bypassed the need for the NCR-1 and/or -2 functions, suggesting that HSD-1-mediated steroid hormone production is an important functional output of the NCR transporters. Finally, we found that the HSD-1-mediated signal activates insulin/IGF-I signaling in a cell non-autonomous fashion, suggesting a novel mechanism for how these two endocrine pathways intersect in directing development.
Niemann-Pick disease is a genetic disorder, affecting approximately 1 to 150,000 living births per year; in Poland 1-5 cases. Usually diagnosed in the childhood, Niemann-Pick disease results in death in the teenage years. Niemann-Pick disease is defined as a lysosomal storage disorder and is related to impaired transport and/or accumulation of specific lipids inside the cell. In this report, we provide evidence about potential role of annexins, calcium- and membrane-binding proteins, in the formation and stabilization of cholesterol-rich microdomains and their possible function in organizing the membranes of early and late endosomes, organelles affected in the type C Niemann-Pick disease characterized by abnormal accumulation of cholesterol and glycosphingolipids in lysosomal like organelles.
Dietary and biliary cholesterol are taken up by intestinal epithelial cells and transported to the endoplasmic reticulum. At the endoplasmic reticulum, cholesterol is esterified, packaged into chylomicrons and secreted into the lymph for delivery to the bloodstream. NPC1L1 (Niemann-Pick C1-like 1) is a protein on the enterocyte brush-border membrane that facilitates cholesterol absorption. Cholesterol's itinerary as it moves to the endoplasmic reticulum is unknown, as is the identity of any cellular proteins that facilitate the movement. Two proteins that play an important role in intracellular cholesterol transport and could potentially influence NPC1L1-mediated cholesterol uptake are NPC1 and NPC2 (Niemann-Pick type C disease proteins 1 and 2). In this issue of the Biochemical Journal, Dixit and colleagues show that the absence or presence of NPC1 and NPC2 has no effect on intestinal cholesterol absorption in the mouse. Thus neither protein fills the gap in our knowledge of intra-enterocyte cholesterol transport. Furthermore, the NPC1/NPC2 pathway would not be a good target for limiting the uptake of dietary cholesterol.
The 3beta-(2-diethylaminoethoxy)-androstenone HCl (U18666A), progesterone and several cationic amphiphilic drugs have been shown to alter the trafficking of a number of intracellular membrane proteins including CD63/Lamp-3, insulin growth factor 2/mannose 6-phosphate receptor (IGF2/MPR), and the Niemann-Pick C1 gene product (NPC1) as well as ganglioside GM1. We have examined the effects of these compounds on cultured melanocytes at concentrations that have been shown to effectively alter intracellular trafficking. Treatment of melanocytes with U18666A (2.5 micro M) or progesterone (15 micro M) for 96 h decreased melanin content an average of 67% as compared with control without lowering the total cellular tyrosinase activity. Steroidal alkaloids that preferentially act on the Sonic Hedgehog signaling pathway showed no related specificity in their ability to decrease pigmentation. In melanocytes treated with U18666A, tyrosinase accumulates in a compartment that contains both lysosome-associated membrane protein-1 (Lamp 1) and MPR, and stains with filipin, consistent with cholesterol-laden late endosomes/lysosomes. Our results suggest that tyrosinase, like the NPC1 gene product, traverses a U18666A-sensitive trafficking pathway.
To visualize the intracellular transport of plasma membrane-derived cholesterol under physiological and pathophysiological conditions, a novel fluorescent cholesterol analog, 6-dansyl cholestanol (DChol), has been synthesized. We present several lines of evidence that DChol mimics cholesterol. The cholesterol probe could be efficiently incorporated into the plasma membrane via cyclodextrin-donor complexes. The itinerary of DChol from the plasma membrane to the cell was studied to determine its dependence on the function of Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC) protein. In all cells, DChol moved from the plasma membrane to the endoplasmic reticulum. Its further transport to the Golgi complex was observed but with marked differences among various cell lines. DChol was finally transported to small (approximately 0.5 microm diameter) lipid droplets, a process that required functional acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase. In human NPC fibroblasts, NPC-like cells, or in cells mimicking the NPC phenotype, DChol was found in enlarged (&gt;1 microm diameter) droplets. When the NPC-phenotype was corrected by transfection with NPC1, DChol was again found in small-sized droplets. Our data show that NPC1 has an essential role in the distribution of plasma membrane-derived cholesterol by maintaining the small size of cholesterol-containing lipid droplets in the cell.
Niemann-Pick type C (NPC) disease is a fatal neurodegenerative disorder characterized by over-accumulation of low-density lipoprotein-derived cholesterol and glycosphingolipids in late endosomes/lysosomes (LE/L) throughout the body. Human mutations in either NPC1 or NPC2 genes have been directly associated with impaired cholesterol efflux from LE/L. Independent from its role in cholesterol homeostasis and its NPC2 partner, NPC1 was unexpectedly identified as a critical player controlling intracellular entry of filoviruses such as Ebola. In this study, a yeast three-hybrid system revealed that the NPC1 cytoplasmic tail directly interacts with the clathrin adaptor protein AP-1 via its acidic/di-leucine motif. Consequently, a nonfunctional AP-1A cytosolic complex resulted in a typical NPC-like phenotype mainly due to a direct impairment of NPC1 trafficking to LE/L and a partial secretion of NPC2. Furthermore, the mislocalization of NPC1 was not due to cholesterol accumulation in LE/L, as it was not rescued upon treatment with Mβ-cyclodextrin, which almost completely eliminated intracellular free cholesterol. Our cumulative data demonstrate that the cytosolic clathrin adaptor AP-1A is essential for the lysosomal targeting and function of NPC1 and NPC2.
While the autophagic process is mainly regulated at the post-translational level, a growing body of evidence suggests that autophagy might also be regulated at the transcriptional level. The identification of transcription factors involved in the regulation of autophagy genes has provided compelling evidence for such regulation. In this context, a powerful high throughput analysis tool to simultaneously monitor the expression level of autophagy genes is urgently needed. Here we describe setting up the first comprehensive human autophagy database (HADb, available at www.autophagy.lu) and the development of a companion Human Autophagy-dedicated cDNA Microarray which comprises 234 genes involved in or related to autophagy. The autophagy microarray tool used on breast adenocarcinoma MCF-7 cell line allowed the identification of 47 differentially expressed autophagy genes associated with the acquisition of resistance to the cytotoxic effect of TNFα. The autophagy-core machinery genes DRAM (Damage-Regulated Autophagy Modulator), BNIP3L (BCL2/adenovirus E1B 19 kDa interacting protein 3-like), BECN1 (Beclin 1), GABARAP (Gamma-AminoButyric Acid Receptor-Associated Protein) and UVRAG (UV radiation resistance associated gene) were found upregulated in TNF-resistant cells, suggesting a constitutive activation of the autophagy machinery in these cells. More interestingly, we identified NPC1 as the most upregulated genes in TNF-resistant compared to TNF-sensitive MCF-7 cells, suggesting a relation between the intracellular transport of cholesterol, the regulation of autophagy and NPC1 expression in TNF-resistant tumor cells. In conclusion, we describe here new tools that may help investigating autophagy gene regulation in various cellular models and diseases.
The transmembrane protein Niemann-Pick C1 Like 1 (NPC1L1) belongs to the Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1) family of cholesterol transporters and is mainly expressed in the liver and the small intestine. NPC1L1 is believed to be the main transporter responsible for the absorption of dietary cholesterol. Like NPC1, NPC1L1 contains a sterol sensing domain, suggesting that it might be sensitive to dietary cholesterol. To test this hypothesis, mucosal explants were cultured in the presence or absence of cholesterol. In the absence of cholesterol NPC1L1 was localized mainly in the brush border of the enterocyte, colocalizing with the brush border enzyme aminopeptidase N (APN), and only a minor part was present in intracellular compartments. In contrast, following culture in the presence of cholesterol a major part of NPC1L1 was found in intracellular compartments positive for the early endosomal marker early endosome antigen 1, whereas only a minor fraction was left in the brush border. Neither APN, lactase, nor sucrase-isomaltase was endocytosed in parallel, demonstrating that this is a selective cholesterol-induced endocytosis of NPC1L1. Conceivably either the induced internalization could be due to NPC1L1 acting as an endocytic cholesterol receptor or it could be a mechanism to reduce the cholesterol uptake. The fluorescent cholesterol analog NBD-cholesterol readily labeled the cytoplasm also under conditions nonpermissible for endocytosis, arguing against a receptor-mediated uptake. We therefore propose that cholesterol is absorbed by NPC1L1 acting as a membrane transporter and that NPC1L1 is internalized to an endosomal compartment to reduce the absorption of cholesterol.
Human adenoviruses (Ads) generally cause mild self-limiting infections but can lead to serious disease and even be fatal in high-risk individuals, underscoring the importance of understanding how the virus counteracts host defense mechanisms. This study had two goals. First, we wished to determine the molecular basis of cholesterol homeostatic responses induced by the early region 3 membrane protein RIDα via its direct interaction with the sterol-binding protein ORP1L, a member of the evolutionarily conserved family of oxysterol-binding protein (OSBP)-related proteins (ORPs). Second, we wished to determine how this interaction regulates innate immunity to adenovirus. ORP1L is known to form highly dynamic contacts with endoplasmic reticulum-resident VAP proteins that regulate late endosome function under regulation of Rab7-GTP. Our studies have demonstrated that ORP1L-VAP complexes also support transport of LDL-derived cholesterol from endosomes to the endoplasmic reticulum, where it was converted to cholesteryl esters stored in lipid droplets when ORP1L was bound to RIDα. The virally induced mechanism counteracted defects in the predominant cholesterol transport pathway regulated by the late endosomal membrane protein Niemann-Pick disease type C protein 1 (NPC1) arising during early stages of viral infection. However, unlike NPC1, RIDα did not reconstitute transport to endoplasmic reticulum pools that regulate SREBP transcription factors. RIDα-induced lipid trafficking also attenuated proinflammatory signaling by Toll-like receptor 4, which has a central role in Ad pathogenesis and is known to be tightly regulated by cholesterol-rich "lipid rafts." Collectively, these data show that RIDα utilizes ORP1L in a way that is distinct from its normal function in uninfected cells to fine-tune lipid raft cholesterol that regulates innate immunity to adenovirus in endosomes.IMPORTANCE Early region 3 proteins encoded by human adenoviruses that attenuate immune-mediated pathology have been a particularly rich source of information regarding intracellular protein trafficking. Our studies with the early region 3-encoded RIDα protein also provided fundamental new information regarding mechanisms of nonvesicular lipid transport and the flow of molecular information at membrane contacts between different organelles. We describe a new pathway that delivers cholesterol from endosomes to the endoplasmic reticulum, where it is esterified and stored in lipid droplets. Although lipid droplets are attracting renewed interest from the standpoint of normal physiology and human diseases, including those resulting from viral infections, experimental model systems for evaluating how and why they accumulate are still limited. Our studies also revealed an intriguing relationship between lipid droplets and innate immunity that may represent a new paradigm for viruses utilizing these organelles.
Bile acids, initially discovered as endogenous ligands of farnesoid X receptor (FXR), play a central role in the regulation of triglyceride and cholesterol metabolism and have recently emerged as a privileged structure for interacting with nuclear receptors relevant to a large array of metabolic processes. In this paper, phenoxy containing cholic acid derivatives with excellent drug-likeness have been designed, synthesized, and assayed as agents against cholesterol accumulation in Raw264.7 macrophages. The most active compound 14b reduced total cholesterol accumulation in Raw264.7 cells up to 30.5% at non-toxic 10 μM and dosage-dependently attenuated oxLDL-induced foam cell formation. Western blotting and qPCR results demonstrate that 14b reduced both cholesterol and lipid in Raw264.7 cells through (1) increasing the expression of cholesterol transporters ABCA1 and ABCG1, (2) accelerating ApoA1-mediated cholesterol efflux. Through a cell-based luciferase reporter assay and molecular docking analysis, LXR was identified as the potential target for 14b. Interestingly, unlike conventional LXR agonist, 14b did not increase lipogenesis gene SREBP-1c expression. Overall, these diverse properties disclosed herein highlight the potential of 14b as a promising lead for further development of multifunctional agents in the therapy of cardiovascular disease.
Estradiol-17β-D-glucuronide (E17G) induces acute endocytic internalization of canalicular transporters, including multidrug resistance-associated protein 2 (Abcc2) in rat, generating cholestasis. Several proteins organized in at least two different signaling pathways are involved in E17G cholestasis: one pathway involves estrogen receptor alpha (ERα), Ca(2+)-dependent protein kinase C and p38-mitogen activated protein kinase, and the other pathway involves GPR30, PKA, phosphoinositide 3-kinase/AKT and extracellular signal-related kinase 1/2. EGF receptor (EGFR) can potentially participate in both pathways since it interacts with GPR30 and ERα. Hence, the aim of this study was to analyze the potential role of this receptor and its downstream effectors, members of the Src family kinases in E17G-induced cholestasis. In vitro, EGFR inhibition by Tyrphostin (Tyr), Cl-387785 or its knockdown with siRNA strongly prevented E17G-induced impairment of Abcc2 function and localization. Activation of EGFR was necessary but not sufficient to impair the canalicular transporter function, whereas the simultaneous activation of EGFR and GPR30 could impair Abcc2 transport. The protection of Tyr was not additive to that produced by the ERα inhibitor ICI neither with that produced by Src kinase inhibitors, suggesting that EGFR shared the signaling pathway of ERα and Src. Further analysis of ERα, EGFR and Src activations induced by E17G, demonstrated that ERα activation precedes that of EGFR and EGFR activation precedes that of Src. In conclusion, activation of EGFR is a key factor in the alteration of canalicular transporter function and localization induced by E17G and it occurs before that of Src and after that of ERα.
Oxysterols are 27-carbon oxidation products of cholesterol metabolism. Oxysterols possess several biological actions, including the promotion of cell death. Here, we examined the ability of several oxysterols to induce short-term death in cancerous (human breast cancer and mouse skin melanoma cells) and non-cancerous (human endothelial cells and lung fibroblasts) cell lines. We determined cell viability, Ki67 expression, cell cycle regulation, and apoptosis after 24-h incubations with oxysterols. We found that different oxysterols had different effects on the studied parameters. Moreover, the effects depended on cell type and oxysterol concentration. Three cytotoxic oxysterols (7-ketocholesterol, cholestane-3β-5α-6β-triol, and 5α-cholestane-3β,6β-diol) inhibited the S phase and stimulated the G0/G1 or G2/M phases. These oxysterols promoted apoptosis, determined with Annexin V and propidium iodide assays. These results showed that different oxysterols have cytotoxic effects depending on the cell line. The findings suggest a potential pharmacological utility of cytotoxic oxysterols.
Inflammatory bowel diseases [IBD] represent a challenging health issue with a complex aetiology involving genetic and environmental parameters. Although our understanding of the pathophysiology of IBD has improved, much remains to be explored. In this context, bioactive lipids, more specifically oxysterols, i.e. oxygenated derivatives of cholesterol, represent an interesting avenue to investigate. Indeed, oxysterols or their receptors are involved in inflammation and immune regulation. Therefore, we set out to study the oxysterome in IBD.
We used both high-performance liquid chromatograph/mass spectroscopy and molecular biology tools to quantify oxysterol levels and the expression of their metabolic enzymes in several models of murine colitis [both acute and chronic], as well as in colon biopsies from patients with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis.
We found that the oxysterome is altered in IBD, in both acute and chronic murine models as well as in human IBD. Two of the oxysterols quantified, 4β-hydroxycholesterol and 25-hydroxycholesterol, were consistently altered in all our models and therefore could be of interest in this context. Hence, we administered them to mice with colitis. While 25-hydroxycholesterol had no effect, 4β-hydroxycholesterol worsened colon inflammation.
Our study addresses the potential involvement of oxysterols in colitis and clearly points towards an active role as well as a clinical relevance for these bioactive lipids.
A liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-ESI(+)-MS/MS) assay was developed and qualified for analyzing 35 analytes of the cholesterol metabolism, including free cholesterol, 17 free, non-esterified oxysterols and 17 free and conjugated bile acids in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid. As internal standards, 25 commercially available stable deuterium-labeled analogs of the analytes were used. Pre-analytical investigations included stability tests of analyte concentrations affected by different anticoagulation additives: lithium heparin-, citrate-, EDTA-K3-stabilized plasma and serum, and the stability in EDTA whole blood at RT. This LC-ESI(+)-MS/MS method was successfully applied for the analysis of paired serum/cerebrospinal fluid samples of patients with and without blood-brain barrier disturbance, as well as of 100 plasma samples of a LIFE-Adult study sub-cohort. A fast and simple sample preparation including protein precipitation and on-line solid-phase extraction was developed. As little as 55 μL of human plasma/serum or cerebrospinal fluid were needed for the analysis. It was possible to separate isomeric oxysterols and bile acids within 23 min using a C18 core-shell column. The assay is capable of quantifying in a linear range of 0.8-250 ng mL-1 for free hydroxycholesterols, 0.2-10 ng mL-1 for dihydroxycholesterols, 0.2-500 ng mL-1 for bile acids and 16-2000 μg mL-1 for cholesterol with acceptable accuracy and precision. In cerebrospinal fluid one free oxysterols, five free and five conjugated bile acids could be quantified. No significant differences between patients with and without blood-brain barrier disturbance were obtained. In the LIFE-Adult sub-cohort two free oxysterols, four free and seven conjugated bile acids could be quantified in EDTA plasma. Men showed significantly higher concentrations of 26-OHC than women (p = 0.035). Furthermore, in women lower levels of cholic acid, glycocholic acid, glycodeoxycholic acid, chenodeoxycholic acid, glycochenodeoxycholic acid, glycoursodeoxycholic acid, glycolithocholic acid and higher levels of taurocholic acid, taurochenodeoxycholic acid, ursodeoxycholic acid/hyodeoxycholic acid were quantified.
Cholesterol is a vital lipid molecule for mammalian cells, regulating fluidity of biological membranes, and serving as an essential constituent of lipid rafts. Mammalian cells acquire cholesterol from extracellular lipoproteins and from de novo synthesis. Cholesterol biosynthesis generates various precursor sterols. Cholesterol undergoes metabolic conversion into oxygenated sterols (oxysterols), bile acids, and steroid hormones. Cholesterol intermediates and metabolites have diverse and important cellular functions. A network of molecular machineries including transcription factors, protein modifiers, sterol transporters/carriers, and sterol sensors regulate sterol homeostasis in mammalian cells and tissues. Dysfunction in metabolism and transport of cholesterol, sterol intermediates, and oxysterols occurs in various pathophysiological settings such as atherosclerosis, cancers, and neurodegenerative diseases. Here we review the cholesterol, intermediate sterol, and oxysterol regulatory mechanisms and intracellular transport machineries, and discuss the roles of sterols and sterol metabolism in human diseases.
The steroid hormones progestagens, estrogens, androgens, and glucocorticoids as well as their precursor cholesterol are required for successful establishment and maintenance of pregnancy and proper development of the fetus. The human placenta forms at the interface of maternal and fetal circulation. It participates in biosynthesis and metabolism of steroids as well as their regulated exchange between maternal and fetal compartment. This review outlines the mechanisms of human placental handling of steroid compounds. Cholesterol is transported from mother to offspring involving lipoprotein receptors such as low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) and scavenger receptor class B type I (SRB1) as well as ATP-binding cassette (ABC)-transporters, ABCA1 and ABCG1. Additionally, cholesterol is also a precursor for placental progesterone and estrogen synthesis. Hormone synthesis is predominantly performed by members of the cytochrome P-450 (CYP) enzyme family including CYP11A1 or CYP19A1 and hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases (HSDs) such as 3β-HSD and 17β-HSD. Placental estrogen synthesis requires delivery of sulfate-conjugated precursor molecules from fetal and maternal serum. Placental uptake of these precursors is mediated by members of the solute carrier (SLC) family including sodium-dependent organic anion transporter (SOAT), organic anion transporter 4 (OAT4), and organic anion transporting polypeptide 2B1 (OATP2B1). Maternal-fetal glucocorticoid transport has to be tightly regulated in order to ensure healthy fetal growth and development. For that purpose, the placenta expresses the enzymes 11β-HSD 1 and 2 as well as the transporter ABCB1. This article also summarizes the impact of diverse compounds and diseases on the expression level and activity of the involved transporters, receptors, and metabolizing enzymes and concludes that the regulatory mechanisms changing the physiological to a pathophysiological state are barely explored. The structure and the cellular composition of the human placental barrier are introduced. While steroid production, metabolism and transport in the placental syncytiotrophoblast have been explored for decades, few information is available for the role of placental-fetal endothelial cells in these processes. With regard to placental structure and function, significant differences exist between species. To further decipher physiologic pathways and their pathologic alterations in placental steroid handling, proper model systems are mandatory.
24S-hydroxycholesterol (24OHC) and Tau are produced in neuronal cells and neurodegeneration leads to increased flux of both of them into cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). In the present study, CSF levels of 24OHC and 27S-hydroxycholesterol (27OHC) along with those of Tau, P-Thr181-Tau and Aβ42 were measured in patients with early Parkinson's disease (PD), Corticobasal syndrome (CBS), Corticobasal Degeneration (CBD), and controls. Using mouse models with increased or no formation of Tau protein and increased production of 24OHC, we have also tested the hypothesis that there is a direct association between neuronal turnover of 24OHC and Tau. The levels of 24OHC are increased, at a group level, in patients with PD or CBS. We found significant correlations between levels of 24OHC and Tau or P-Thr181-Tau in CSF from patients with PD, CBS or CBD. There were no similar correlations between 24OHC and Aβ42 in CSF from these patients. The neuronal levels of 24OHC were not altered in Tau knockout or Tau overexpressing mice. Vice versa, Tau species levels were not changed in Cyp46 overexpressing mice with increased neuronal levels of 24OHC. We conclude that the strongly correlative fluxes of 24OHC and Tau from neuronal cells to CSF are likely to be secondary to neurodegeneration and not due to direct interaction between the two factors. We suggest that this high correlation reflects a rapid neurodegeneration of specific neuronal subtypes with simultaneous release of 24OHC and Tau into the CSF.
Although 24(S)-hydroxycholesterol (24S-OHC) plays an important role to maintain homeostasis of cholesterol in the brain, it induces neuronal cell death at high concentrations. 24S-OHC-induced cell death was suppressed by γ-tocopherol (γ-Toc) but not by γ-tocotrienol (γ-Toc3) in a similar way to α-tocopherol (α-Toc) and α-tocotrienol (α-Toc3) in human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells. Both γ-Toc and γ-Toc3 significantly inhibited cumene hydroperoxide-induced cell death, as previously shown in the case of α-Toc and α-Toc3. Lipid droplet-like structure formation induced by 24S-OHC was suppressed by neither γ-Toc nor γ-Toc3. The phosphorylation of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) was induced by 24S-OHC, which was suppressed by CaMKII phosphorylation-site inhibitor mM3 but not by calmodulin-binding-site inhibitor KN62. A calcium chelator, BAPTA-AM, inhibited calcium ionophore A23187-induced CaMKII phosphorylation but not 24S-OHC-induced CaMKII phosphorylation. Receptor-interacting protein kinase 1 (RIPK1) phosphorylation induced by 24S-OHC was not inhibited by either mM3 or KN62, suggesting that CaMKII activation does not affect RIPK1 phosphorylation. Knockdown of RIPK1 using siRNA induced not only inhibition of CaMKII phosphorylation but also reduction of total CaMKII protein levels, suggesting that RIPK1 may regulate CaMKII signalling. 24S-OHC-induced RIPK1 phosphorylation was inhibited by neither α-Toc nor α-Toc3. In contrast, CaMKII phosphorylation induced by 24S-OHC was significantly suppressed by α-Toc but not by α-Toc3. These results suggest that CaMKII activation is involved in the mechanism of 24S-OHC-induced cell death and that Toc inhibits the cell death via inhibition of CaMKII activation through a RIPK1 phosphorylation-independent pathway.
Gastric cancer (GC) is one of the most common cancers and is the second-leading cause of cancer-associated morbidity worldwide. Oxysterols are oxidized derivatives of cholesterol that may be important in many biological processes, but the levels and roles of oxysterols in gastric tumours remain to be elucidated. The levels of cholesterol, oxysterols and sulfated oxysterols in human gastric tumour tissues, adjacent normal mucosal tissues, cancerous gastric juice and gastric juice obtained from healthy subjects were detected by LC-MS. It was found that the levels of 24(R/S),25-EC and 27HC in human gastric tumour tissues and cancerous gastric juice were significantly increased compared with those of adjacent normal mucosal tissues and gastric juice from healthy subjects. Compared with normal gastric mucosal tissue, the levels of sulfated 25-hydroxycholesterol (25HC3S) and the ratio of 25HC3S/25HC were decreased in human gastric tumour tissues, which might be related to the dramatically decreased SULT2A1 expression in gastric tumour tissue. Both 24(R/S),25-EC and 27HC suppressed gastric cancer proliferation, which was not altered by LXRα-siRNA treatment. The suppression of cell proliferation induced by 27HC was attenuated by LXRβ-siRNA, but the suppression of cell proliferation induced by 24(R/S),25-EC was intensified by LXRβ-siRNA. Both 24(R/S),25-EC and 27HC dramatically inhibited HGC-27 cell migration, which was attenuated by the co-transfection of cells with LXRα-siRNA and LXRβ-siRNA, but not LXRα-siRNA or LXRβ-siRNA alone. In conclusion, the accumulated 24(R/S),25-EC and 27HC in human gastric tumour tissues might play important roles in gastric cancer development.
Recent studies have shown that the cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A phenotype marker 4β-hydroxycholesterol/cholesterol (4βOHC/C) ratio is negatively correlated with body weight in healthy volunteers, and that obese patients have lower 4βOHC levels than healthy controls. However, 4βOHC/C ratio in underweight patients has yet to be reported. The aim of this study was to examine potential differences in CYP3A activity between underweight patients with anorexia nervosa and normal-weight volunteers by measuring plasma 4βOHC/C ratio. Furthermore, we wished to describe any association between body mass index (BMI) and 4βOHC/C ratio in underweight patients. A total of 20 underweight patients and 16 normal-weight volunteers were included in the study, all females. Underweight patients had a median 4βOHC/C ratio (molar ratio × 10-5) of 2.52 (range, 0.90-11.3) compared to 1.29 (0.56-2.09) in normal-weight subjects (Mann-Whitney P = 0.0005). 4βOHC/C ratio was negatively correlated with BMI in underweight patients (r = -0.56, P = 0.011), and in the whole study population (r = -0.67, P &lt; 0.0001). This suggests that the negative correlation between 4βOHC/C and BMI, which has previously been reported between 4βOHC/C and body weight in healthy volunteers, extends to underweight patients. The findings indicate that CYP3A activity increases with decreasing BMI, resulting in higher CYP3A activity in underweight patients compared to normal-weight subjects. The potential clinical relevance of this needs to be studied further by comparing pharmacokinetics of drugs subjected to CYP3A-mediated metabolism in underweight vs. normal-weight individuals.
A novel innate immune strategy, involving specific cholesterol oxidation products as effectors, has begun to reveal connections between cholesterol metabolism and immune response against viral infections. Indeed, 25-hydroxycholesterol (25HC) and 27-hydroxycholesterol (27HC), physiologically produced by enzymatic oxidation of cholesterol, act as inhibitors of a wide spectrum of enveloped and non-enveloped human viruses. However, the mechanisms underlying their protective effects against non-enveloped viruses are almost completely unexplored. To get insight into this field, we investigated the antiviral activity of 25HC and 27HC against a non-enveloped virus causing acute gastroenteritis in children, the human rotavirus (HRV). We found that 25HC and 27HC block the infectivity of several HRV strains at 50% inhibitory concentrations in the low micromolar range in the absence of cell toxicity. Both molecules affect the final step of virus penetration into cells by preventing the association of two cellular proteins: the oxysterol binding protein (OSBP) and the vesicle-associated membrane protein-associated protein-A (VAP-A). By altering the activity of these cellular mediators, 25HC and 27HC disturb the recycling of cholesterol between the endoplasmic reticulum and the late endosomes which are exploited by HRV to penetrate into the cell. The substantial accumulation of cholesterol in the late endosomal compartment results in sequestering viral particles inside these vesicles thereby preventing cytoplasmic virus replication. These findings suggest that cholesterol oxidation products of enzymatic origin might be primary effectors of host restriction strategies to counteract HRV infection and point to redox active lipids involvement in viral infections as a research area of focus to better focus in order to identify novel antiviral agents targets.
Arachidonate 15-lipoxygenase (ALOX15) and arachidonate 15-lipoxygenase, type B (ALOX15B) catalyze the dioxygenation of polyunsaturated fatty acids and are upregulated in human alternatively activated macrophages (AAMs) induced by Th2 cytokine interleukin-4 (IL-4) and/or interleukin-13. Known primarily for roles in bioactive lipid mediator synthesis, 15-lipoxygenases (15-LOXs) have been implicated in various macrophage functions including efferocytosis and ferroptosis. Using a combination of inhibitors and siRNAs to suppress 15-LOX isoforms, we studied the role of 15-LOXs in cellular cholesterol homeostasis and immune function in naïve and AAMs. Silencing or inhibiting the 15-LOX isoforms impaired sterol regulatory element binding protein (SREBP)-2 signaling by inhibiting SREBP-2 processing into mature transcription factor and reduced SREBP-2 binding to sterol regulatory elements and subsequent target gene expression. Silencing ALOX15B reduced cellular cholesterol and the cholesterol intermediates desmosterol, lanosterol, 24,25-dihydrolanosterol, and lathosterol as well as oxysterols in IL-4-stimulated macrophages. In addition, attenuating both 15-LOX isoforms did not generally affect IL-4 gene expression but rather uniquely impacted IL-4-induced CCL17 production in an SREBP-2-dependent manner resulting in reduced T cell migration to macrophage conditioned media. In conclusion, we identified a novel role for ALOX15B, and to a lesser extent ALOX15, in cholesterol homeostasis and CCL17 production in human macrophages.
Advanced age-related macular degeneration (AMD), the leading cause of blindness among people over 50 years of age, is characterized by atrophic neurodegeneration or pathologic angiogenesis. Early AMD is characterized by extracellular cholesterol-rich deposits underneath the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) called drusen or in the subretinal space called subretinal drusenoid deposits (SDD) that drive disease progression. However, mechanisms of drusen and SDD biogenesis remain poorly understood. Although human AMD is characterized by abnormalities in cholesterol homeostasis and shares phenotypic features with atherosclerosis, it is unclear whether systemic immunity or local tissue metabolism regulates this homeostasis. Here, we demonstrate that targeted deletion of macrophage cholesterol ABC transporters A1 (ABCA1) and -G1 (ABCG1) leads to age-associated extracellular cholesterol-rich deposits underneath the neurosensory retina similar to SDD seen in early human AMD. These mice also develop impaired dark adaptation, a cardinal feature of RPE cell dysfunction seen in human AMD patients even before central vision is affected. Subretinal deposits in these mice progressively worsen with age, with concomitant accumulation of cholesterol metabolites including several oxysterols and cholesterol esters causing lipotoxicity that manifests as photoreceptor dysfunction and neurodegeneration. These findings suggest that impaired macrophage cholesterol transport initiates several key elements of early human AMD, demonstrating the importance of systemic immunity and aging in promoting disease manifestation. Polymorphisms in genes involved with cholesterol transport and homeostasis are associated with a significantly higher risk of developing AMD, thus making these studies translationally relevant by identifying potential targets for therapy.
Invasive lobular breast carcinoma (ILC) is a histological subtype of breast cancer that is characterized by loss of E-cadherin and high expression of estrogen receptor alpha (ERα). In many cases, ILC is effectively treated with adjuvant aromatase inhibitors (AIs); however, acquired AI resistance remains a significant problem.
To identify underlying mechanisms of acquired anti-estrogen resistance in ILC, we recently developed six long-term estrogen-deprived (LTED) variant cell lines from the human ILC cell lines SUM44PE (SUM44; two lines) and MDA-MB-134VI (MM134; four lines). To better understand mechanisms of AI resistance in these models, we performed transcriptional profiling analysis by RNA-sequencing followed by candidate gene expression and functional studies.
MM134 LTED cells expressed ER at a decreased level and lost growth response to estradiol, while SUM44 LTED cells retained partial ER activity. Our transcriptional profiling analysis identified shared activation of lipid metabolism across all six independent models. However, the underlying basis of this signature was distinct between models. Oxysterols were able to promote the proliferation of SUM44 LTED cells but not MM134 LTED cells. In contrast, MM134 LTED cells displayed a high expression of the sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP1), a regulator of fatty acid and cholesterol synthesis, and were hypersensitive to genetic or pharmacological inhibition of SREBPs. Several SREBP1 downstream targets involved in fatty acid synthesis, including FASN, were induced, and MM134 LTED cells were more sensitive to etomoxir, an inhibitor of the rate-limiting enzyme in beta-oxidation, than their respective parental control cells. Finally, in silico expression analysis in clinical specimens from a neo-adjuvant endocrine trial showed a significant association between the increase of SREBP1 expression and lack of clinical response, providing further support for a role of SREBP1 in the acquisition of endocrine resistance in breast cancer.
Our characterization of a unique series of AI-resistant ILC models identifies the activation of key regulators of fatty acid and cholesterol metabolism, implicating lipid-metabolic processes driving estrogen-independent growth of ILC cells. Targeting these changes may prove a strategy for prevention and treatment of endocrine resistance for patients with ILC.
Although representing two distinct disease entities, Niemann-Pick disease type C (NP-C) disease and acid sphingomyelinase deficiency (ASMD) share several phenotypic features. The lack of biomarkers was responsible in the past of diagnostic delay. Recently, plasma oxysterols, cholestan-3β,5α,6β-triol (Triol) and 7-ketocholesterol (7-KC) and lysosphingolipids, Lyso-sphingomyelin (Lyso-SM) and Lysosphingomyelin-509 (Lyso-SM-509), have been proposed as diagnostic biomarkers. We aimed to assess the diagnostic power of the two biomarkers categories and to evaluate possible correlations with patients' age and clinical phenotypes.
We analyzed plasma oxysterols and lysosphingolipids in patients affected by NP-C and ASMD, and compared with healthy controls.
Oxysterols were always increased in both NP-C and ASMD. In NP-C, Lyso-SM and Lyso-SM-509 were increased in 70%, and 100% of patients, respectively. Biomarkers negatively correlated with patients' age, with highest levels in early-infantile, intermediate in the late-infantile and lowest in the juvenile phenotype. In ASMD, lysosphingolipids were both increased, with a greater order of magnitude than in NP-C, with highest levels in chronic-neurovisceral vs visceral phenotype.
Lysosphingolipids are useful biomarkers for a rapid and precise diagnosis, allowing clear distinction between NP-C and ASMD. They are more reliable biomarkers than oxysterols and correlate with patients' age and clinical phenotype.
Equine neuroaxonal dystrophy/equine degenerative myeloencephalopathy (eNAD/EDM) is a neurodegenerative disorder affecting genetically predisposed foals maintained on an α-tocopherol (α-TOH) deficient diet. Currently no antemortem diagnostic test for eNAD/EDM is available.
Because α-TOH deficiency is associated with increased lipid peroxidation, it was hypothesized that F2 -isoprostanes (F2 IsoP), F4 -neuroprostanes (F4 NP) and oxysterols derived from free radical oxidation would be increased in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and neural tissue of eNAD/EDM affected horses and could serve as potential biomarkers for disease.
Isoprostane Study A: 14 Quarter horse foals (10 healthy foals and 4 eNAD/EDM affected foals) at 1 and 6 months of age. Isoprostane Study B: 17 eNAD/EDM affected and 10 unaffected horses ≥ 1-4 years of age. Oxysterol study: eNAD/EDM affected (n = 14, serum; n = 11, CSF; n = 10, spinal cord [SC]) and unaffected horses 1-4 years of age (n = 12, serum; n = 10, CSF; n = 7, SC).
Cerebrospinal fluid [F2 IsoP] and [F4 NP] were assessed using gas chromatography-negative ion chemical ionization mass spectrometry. Serum, CSF, and cervical SC [oxysterols] were quantified using high performance liquid chromatography mass spectrometry. Results were compared with respective α-TOH concentrations.
Spinal cord [7-ketocholesterol], [7-hydroxycholesterol], and [7-keto-27-hydrocholesterol] were higher in eNAD/EDM horses whereas [24-ketocholesterol] was lower. No significant difference was found in CSF [F2 IsoP] and [F4 NP], serum [oxysterols] and CSF [oxysterols] between eNAD/EDM affected and unaffected horses. No correlation was found between [F2 IsoP], [F4 NP], or [oxysterols] and respective [α-TOH].
In the SC, targeted markers of cholesterol oxidation were significantly increased in horses with eNAD/EDM.
Epidemiologic studies are controversial concerning the roles played by cholesterol in cancer risk and development, possibly as it is not cholesterol per se that is pathologic in cancers. Indeed, recent data reveal that the cholesterol metabolism in cancer cells can generate endogenous oncopromoter metabolites at higher levels compared with normal tissues and/or can be deregulated in the production of endogenous oncosuppressor metabolites in an opposite way. These metabolites are oxysterols, which are cholesterol oxygenation products generated by enzymatic and/or autoxidation processes. All these oxysterols are new classes of estrogen, glucocorticoid, or liver X nuclear receptor ligands, and their protumor action on their cognate receptors could explain some drug resistance, while treatment with antitumor metabolites could complement their deficiency in cancers and restore their action on their nuclear receptor. Given that hypercholesterolemia and high intakes of cholesterol-rich foods or processed foods can generate these oxysterols, their importance in cancer risk or development in overweight and obese people is to be considered. The discovery of these cholesterol-derived metabolites and the identification of the nuclear receptors mediating their pro- or antitumor activities are important findings, which should have major implications in the diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of different cancers and open new areas of research.

Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is a chronic inflammatory cholangiopathy frequently complicated by cholangiocarcinoma (CCA). Massive proliferation of biliary tree stem/progenitor cells (BTSCs), expansion of peribiliary glands (PBGs), and dysplasia were observed in PSC. The aims of the present study were to evaluate the involvement of PBGs and BTSCs in CCA which emerged in PSC patients. Specimens from normal liver (n = 5), PSC (n = 20), and PSC-associated CCA (n = 20) were included. Samples were processed for histology, immunohistochemistry, and immunofluorescence. In vitro experiments were performed on human BTSCs, human mucinous primary CCA cell cultures, and human cholangiocyte cell lines (H69). Our results indicated that all CCAs emerging in PSC patients were mucin-producing tumors characterized by PBG involvement and a high expression of stem/progenitor cell markers. Ducts with neoplastic lesions showed higher inflammation, wall thickness, and PBG activation compared to nonneoplastic PSC-affected ducts. CCA showed higher microvascular density and higher expression of nuclear factor kappa B, interleukin-6, interleukin-8, transforming growth factor β, and vascular endothelial growth factor-1 compared to nonneoplastic ducts. CCA cells were characterized by a higher expression of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) traits and by the absence of primary cilia compared to bile ducts and PBG cells in controls and patients with PSC. Our in vitro study demonstrated that lipopolysaccharide and oxysterols (PSC-related stressors) induced the expression of EMT traits, the nuclear factor kappa B pathway, autophagy, and the loss of primary cilia in human BTSCs. Conclusion: CCA arising in patients with PSC is characterized by extensive PBG involvement and by activation of the BTSC niche in these patients, the presence of duct lesions at different stages suggests a progressive tumorigenesis.
Cholesterol homeostasis has a pivotal function in regulating immune cells. Here we show that apolipoprotein E (apoE) deficiency leads to the accumulation of cholesterol in the cell membrane of dendritic cells (DC), resulting in enhanced MHC-II-dependent antigen presentation and CD4+ T-cell activation. Results from WT and apoE KO bone marrow chimera suggest that apoE from cells of hematopoietic origin has immunomodulatory functions, regardless of the onset of hypercholesterolemia. Humans expressing apoE4 isoform (ε4/3-ε4/4) have increased circulating levels of activated T cells compared to those expressing WT apoE3 (ε3/3) or apoE2 isoform (ε2/3-ε2/2). This increase is caused by enhanced antigen-presentation by apoE4-expressing DCs, and is reversed when these DCs are incubated with serum containing WT apoE3. In summary, our study identifies myeloid-produced apoE as a key physiological modulator of DC antigen presentation function, paving the way for further explorations of apoE as a tool to improve the management of immune diseases.
The electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes, e-cigs) have become the most sought-after alternative to the traditional cigarettes, partly due to the widespread perception of safety. However, the high temperature reached by e-cig solutions can generate toxic compounds, some of which are listed as known human carcinogens. To evaluate the impact of e-cig aerosol on rat brain lipid profile, twenty male Sprague Dawley rats were exposed to 11 cycles/day (E-cig group), to consume 1 mL/day of e-liquid, for 5 days/week up to 8 weeks. Ten rats were sacrificed after 4 weeks (4w) and ten at the end of treatment (8w). The composition of total fatty acids, sterols and oxysterols of the lipid fraction of rat brains, was analyzed. The results of the E-cig group were compared with those of the control group (not exposed). After 8 weeks, the saturated fatty acids significantly raised up to 7.35 mg/g tissue, whereas polyunsaturated fatty acids decreased reaching 3.17 mg/g. The e-cig vaping increased both palmitic (3.43 mg/g) and stearic acids (3.82 mg/g), while a significant decrement of arachidonic (1.32 mg/g) and docosahexaenoic acids (1.00 mg/g) was found. Atherogenic (0.5) and thrombogenic (1.12) indices also increased in 8w treated animals. The e-cig aerosol significantly impacted the cholesterol homeostasis, since the latter at 8w (21.57 mg/g) was significantly lower than control (24.56 mg/g); moreover, a significant increase of 7-dehydrocholesterol (1.87 mg/g) was also denoted in e-cig group. The e-cig aerosol also reduced the oxysterol formation (19.55 μg/g) after 4 weeks of exposure, except for triol and 5α,6α-epoxycholesterol (α-EC). The principal component analysis (PCA) separated all E-cig from control groups, evidencing that oxysterols (except triol and 24(S)-hydroxycholesterol (24(S)-HC)) were inversely correlated to 7-DHC and TI. The present research revealed that e-cigs aerosol affected the lipid and cholesterol homeostasis in rat brain, which could contribute to the new occurrence of some neurodegenerative diseases.
Males are more susceptible than females to infections due to the differences in endocrine-immune interactions. Furthermore, it is reported that lowering cell cholesterol impairs viral replication and infection in vitro. However, the production of oxysterols in vivo by oxidation of cholesterol may result in inhibition of HIV replication. Therefore, this study was designed to determine the associations of gender and serum total cholesterol with CD4+ T cell counts and/or WHO clinical stages, and HIV ribonucleic acid (RNA) load in antiretroviral therapy (ART) naive study population with known sero-positive time of stay in Addis Ababa.  METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted from February to August 2013 on 594 HIV-1 infected ART-naïve adult study participants in four hospitals Addis Ababa. CD4+ T-cell count, HIV RNA load, hemoglobin and fasting serum total cholesterol were determined. Socio-demographic characteristics, WHO clinical stages, and height and weight were collected from patients' chart and triangulated by structured questionnaire. Pearson chi-square test, Spearman rank correlation and univariate and multivariate linear/logistic regression analyses were carried out to determine associations.
Mean HIV RNA load was found to be lower in women than in men (p &lt; 0.05). CD4+ T cell count and serum total cholesterol were found to be significantly correlated with HIV RNA load (p &lt; 0.01). Women were at lower risk of having higher HIV RNA load in comparison to men. In addition, having lower concentrations of serum total cholesterol was found to be independent predictor of higher HIV RNA load in comparison to those with higher concentrations of cholesterol in serum (p &lt; 0.05). The multivariate binomial logistic regression also showed that the immune status was better in women than men, and in the presence of higher serum total cholesterol (p &lt; 0.05).
Gender and serum total cholesterol were found to be associated and independent predictors of HIV RNA load, and CD4+ cell count and/or WHO clinical stages. There is a significant lower HIV RNA load and better CD4+ T cell count in women and those study participants with higher serum total cholesterol.
7-Ketocholesterol is a major dietary cholesterol oxidation product found in high concentrations in atherosclerotic plaques, which contribute to the development of atherosclerosis. This study aimed to investigate the effects of 7-ketocholesterol on endothelial inflammation, as well as the underlying mechanisms. Pretreatment of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) with 7-ketocholesterol significantly enhanced the total interactions between human monocytic cells (THP-1 cell line) and TNFα-activated HUVECs under physiological flow conditions, compared to pretreatment with cholesterol (TNFα+50 μM cholesterol: 13.1 ± 0.54 cells/CPF, TNFα+50 μM 7-ketocholesterol: 18.9 ± 0.35 cells/CPF, p &lt; 0.01). 7-Ketocholesterol enhanced the expression of E-selectin, ICAM-1, and VCAM-1 proteins. It also activated p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), and treatment with a p38 MAPK inhibitor inhibited both E-selectin expression via ATF-2 activation and 7-ketocholesterol-induced THP-1 adhesion to HUVECs. These findings suggest that 7-ketocholesterol enhances leukocyte-endothelial interactions by upregulating the expression of adhesion molecules, presumably via the p38 MAPK-dependent pathway.
Cardiovascular diseases have been associated with stress in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and accumulation of unfolded proteins leading to the unfolded protein response (UPR). Reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as superoxide and H2O2 derived from NADPH oxidases have been implicated in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular diseases. ROS have also been associated with ER stress. The role NADPH oxidases in the UPR is, however, not completely resolved yet.
In this study, we investigated the role of p22phox, an essential component of most NADPH oxidases, in the UPR of endothelial cells.
Induction of ER stress increased p22phox expression at the transcriptional level. p22phox was identified as novel target of the UPR transcription factor ATF4 (activator of transcription factor 4) under ER stress conditions by promoter analyses and ChIP. Depletion of ATF4 and p22phox diminished the levels of superoxide and H2O2 under ER stress conditions. On the contrary, p22phox was instrumental in increasing eIF2α phosphorylation and subsequent ATF4 expression on induction of ER stress by chemicals, oxysterols, or severe hypoxia in vitro and in vivo, leading to increased expression of CHOP and activation of effector caspases.
p22phox is a novel target of ATF4 in response to ER stress, which can promote the PERK-ATF4 branch of the UPR in vitro and in vivo.
p22phox-dependent NADPH oxidases are important mediators of ER stress driving the UPR.
The involvement of organelles in cell death is well established especially for endoplasmic reticulum, lysosomes and mitochondria. However, the role of the peroxisome is not well known, though peroxisomal dysfunction favors a rupture of redox equilibrium. To study the role of peroxisomes in cell death, 158 N murine oligodendrocytes were treated with 7-ketocholesterol (7 KC: 25-50 μM, 24 h). The highest concentration is known to induce oxiapoptophagy (OXIdative stress + APOPTOsis + autoPHAGY), whereas the lowest concentration does not induce cell death. In those conditions (with 7 KC: 50 μM) morphological, topographical and functional peroxisome alterations associated with modifications of the cytoplasmic distribution of mitochondria, with mitochondrial dysfunction (loss of transmembrane mitochondrial potential, decreased level of cardiolipins) and oxidative stress were observed: presence of peroxisomes with abnormal sizes and shapes similar to those observed in Zellweger fibroblasts, lower cellular level of ABCD3, used as a marker of peroxisomal mass, measured by flow cytometry, lower mRNA and protein levels (measured by RT-qPCR and western blotting) of ABCD1 and ABCD3 (two ATP-dependent peroxisomal transporters), and of ACOX1 and MFP2 enzymes, and lower mRNA level of DHAPAT, involved in peroxisomal β-oxidation and plasmalogen synthesis, respectively, and increased levels of very long chain fatty acids (VLCFA: C24:0, C24:1, C26:0 and C26:1, quantified by gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry) metabolized by peroxisomal β-oxidation. In the presence of 7 KC (25 μM), slight mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress were found, and no induction of apoptosis was detected; however, modifications of the cytoplasmic distribution of mitochondria and clusters of mitochondria were detected. The peroxisomal alterations observed with 7 KC (25 μM) were similar to those with 7 KC (50 μM). In addition, data obtained by transmission electron microcopy and immunofluorescence microscopy by dual staining with antibodies raised against p62, involved in autophagy, and ABCD3, support that 7 KC (25-50 μM) induces pexophagy. 7 KC (25-50 μM)-induced side effects were attenuated by α-tocopherol but not by α-tocotrienol, whereas the anti-oxidant properties of these molecules determined with the FRAP assay were in the same range. These data provide evidences that 7 KC, at concentrations inducing or not cell death, triggers morphological, topographical and functional peroxisomal alterations associated with minor or major mitochondrial changes.
Astaxanthin is a natural red carotene exerting a strong antioxidant action. The effect of this carotene on the oxidative stability of raw and cooked lamb patties was evaluated. Seven experimental treatments were included in this study depending on the antioxidants added, which are: no antioxidant added (control), 450 mg/kg of sodium metabisulphite, 500 mg/kg of sodium ascorbate, and 20 mg/kg, 40 mg/kg, 60 mg/kg and 80 mg/kg of astaxanthin. The raw patties were either refrigerated for up to 11 days or frozen for 3 months under aerobic conditions. Changes in thiobarbituric reactive substances (TBARS), instrumental colour, pH and Eh were determined in the refrigerated patties and TBARS in the frozen patties. Volatile compounds were determined in cooked patties and cholesterol oxides in both cooked and after cooking microwave reheated patties. The changes in TBARS of cooked patties during a four-day refrigerated storage were also studied. Compared to the control patties, the use of astaxanthin reduced the TBARS generation in a manner depending on the dose for both raw and cooked patties during storage (P &lt; 0.05). Astaxanthin added at levels of 60 and/or 80 mg/kg showed a greater antioxidant effect than ascorbate and metabisulphite. The presence of astaxanthin, like that of ascorbate, decreased the oxysterols levels of cooked patties with regard to controls. The amount of volatiles released from the cooked patties was also reduced by astaxanthin. This effect was not observed for ascorbate or metabisulphite. Astaxanthin in lamb patties at levels of 60-80 mg/kg could improve raw and cooked lamb patty oxidative stability during refrigerated aerobic storage, protect their lipids against thermal degradation more than ascorbate and metabisulphite, and reduce oxysterols formation during cooking in a similar way to ascorbate.
Some oxysterols resulting either from enzymatic oxidation or autoxidation of cholesterol are associated with age-related diseases including neurodegenerative diseases. Among these oxysterols, 7β-hydroxycholesterol (7β-OHC) is often found at increased levels in patients. It is therefore important to identify molecules or mixtures of molecules to prevent 7β-OHC-induced side effects. Consequently, murine oligodendrocytes (158N) were cultured in the absence or presence of 7β-OHC (20 μg/mL, 24 h) with or without a natural oil extracted from sea urchin (Paracentrotus lividus) eggs known for its biological activity. Firstly, the chemical composition of this oil was determined using 31P NMR and GC-MS. Secondly, this oil was used to reduce 7β-OHC-induced side effects. To this end, the oil (160 μg/mL) was added to the culture medium of 158N cells 2 h before 7β-OHC. The effects of 7β-OHC with or without the oil on cell viability were studied with the MTT test. Photometric methods were used to analyze antioxidant enzyme activities, superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx), as well as the generation of lipid peroxidation products (malondialdehyde (MDA), conjugated dienes (CDs)) and protein oxidation product (carbonylated proteins (CPs)). Gas chromatography was used to determine the fatty acid profile. With 7β-OHC, an induction of cell death associated with oxidative stress (alteration of GPx and SOD activities) was observed; an overproduction of lipid peroxidation products (MDA and CDs) and CPs was also revealed. Sea urchin egg oil attenuated 7β-OHC-induced cytotoxicity: 7β-OHC-induced cell death was reduced, GPx and SOD activities were normalized, and lower levels of MDA, CDs and CPs were produced. In addition, whereas a disturbed fatty acid profile was observed with 7β-OHC, similar fatty acid profiles were found in control cells and in cells cultured with 7β-OHC associated with sea urchin egg oil. These data demonstrate the protective activities of sea urchin egg oil against 7β-OHC-induced side effects on 158N cells, supporting the concept that this oil may have benefits in the prevention of neurodegenerative diseases.
Cholesterol oxidation products, also named oxysterols, can be formed either by cholesterol auto-oxidation, enzymatically or both. Among these oxysterols, 7-ketocholesterol (7KC) is mainly formed during radical attacks that take place on the carbon 7 of cholesterol. As increased levels of 7KC have been found in the tissues, plasma and/or cerebrospinal fluid of patients with major diseases, especially age-related diseases (cardiovascular diseases, eye diseases, neurodegenerative diseases), some cancers, and chronic inflammatory diseases, it is suspected that 7KC, could contribute to their development. Since 7KC, provided by the diet or endogenously formed, is not or little efficiently metabolized, except in hepatic cells, its cellular accumulation can trigger numerous side effects including oxidative stress, inflammation and cell death. To counteract 7KC-induced side effects, it is necessary to characterize the metabolic pathways activated by this oxysterol to identify potential targets for cytoprotection and geroprotection. Currently, several natural compounds (tocopherols, fatty acids, polyphenols, etc) or mixtures of compounds (oils) used in traditional medicine are able to inhibit the deleterious effects of 7KC. The different molecules identified could be valued in different ways (functional foods, recombinant molecules, theranostic) to prevent or treat diseases associated with 7KC.
Following the initial detection of viral infection, innate immune responses trigger the induction of numerous interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) to inhibit virus replication and dissemination. One such ISG encodes cholesterol-25-hydroxylase (CH25H), an enzyme that catalyzes the oxidation of cholesterol to form a soluble product, 25-hydroxycholesterol (25HC). Recent studies have found that CH25H is broadly antiviral; it inhibits infection by several viruses. For enveloped viruses, 25HC inhibits membrane fusion, likely by altering membrane characteristics such as hydrophobicity or cholesterol aggregation. However, the mechanisms by which 25HC restricts infection of nonenveloped viruses are unknown. We examined whether 25HC restricts infection by mammalian reovirus. Treatment with 25HC restricted infection by reovirus prototype strains type 1 Lang and type 3 Dearing. In contrast to reovirus virions, 25HC did not restrict infection by reovirus infectious subvirion particles (ISVPs), which can penetrate either directly at the cell surface or in early endosomal membranes. Treatment with 25HC altered trafficking of reovirus particles to late endosomes and delayed the kinetics of reovirus uncoating. These results suggest that 25HC inhibits the efficiency of cellular entry of reovirus virions, which may require specific endosomal membrane dynamics for efficient membrane penetration.IMPORTANCE The innate immune system is crucial for effective responses to viral infection. Type I interferons, central components of innate immunity, induce expression of hundreds of ISGs; however, the mechanisms of action of these antiviral proteins are not well understood. CH25H, encoded by an ISG, represents a significant constituent of these cellular antiviral strategies, as its metabolic product, 25HC, can act in both an autocrine and a paracrine fashion to protect cells from infection and has been shown to limit viral infection in animal models. Further investigation into the mechanism of action of 25HC may inform novel antiviral therapies and influence the use of mammalian reovirus in clinical trials as an oncolytic agent.
Obligate intracellular apicomplexan parasites are considered as deficient in cholesterol biosynthesis and scavenge cholesterol from their host cell in a parasite-specific manner. Compared to fast proliferating apicomplexan species producing low numbers of merozoites per host cell, (e. g. Toxoplasma gondii), the macromeront-forming protozoa Eimeria bovis is in extraordinary need for cholesterol for offspring production (≥ 170,000 merozoites I/macromeront). Interestingly, optimized in vitro E. bovis merozoite I production occurs under low foetal calf serum (FCS, 1.2%) supplementation. To analyze the impact of extensive E. bovis proliferation on host cellular sterol metabolism we here compared the sterol profiles of E. bovis-infected primary endothelial host cells grown under optimized (1.2% FCS) and non-optimized (10% FCS) cell culture conditions. Therefore, several sterols indicating endogenous de novo cholesterol synthesis, cholesterol conversion and sterol uptake (phytosterols) were analyzed via GC-MS-based approaches. Overall, significantly enhanced levels of phytosterols were detected in both FCS conditions indicating infection-triggered sterol uptake from extracellular sources as a major pathway of sterol acquisition. Interestingly, a simultaneous induction of endogenous cholesterol synthesis based on increased levels of distinct cholesterol precursors was only observed in case of optimized parasite proliferation indicating a parasite proliferation-dependent effect. Considering side-chain oxysterols, 25 hydroxycholesterol levels were selectively found increased in E. bovis-infected host cells, while 24 hydroxycholesterol and 27 hydroxycholesterol contents were not significantly altered by infection. Exogenous treatments with 25 hydroxycholesterol, 27 hydroxycholesterol, and 7 ketocholesterol revealed significant adverse effects on E. bovis intracellular development. Thus, the number and size of developing macromeronts and merozoite I production was significantly reduced indicating that these oxysterols bear direct or indirect antiparasitic properties. Overall, the current data indicate parasite-driven changes in the host cellular sterol profile reflecting the huge demand of E. bovis for cholesterol during macromeront formation and its versatility in the acquisition of cholesterol sources.
Macrophage aging is pathogenic in numerous diseases, including age-related macular degeneration (AMD), a leading cause of blindness in older adults. Although prior studies have explored the functional consequences of macrophage aging, less is known about its cellular basis or what defines the transition from physiologic aging to disease. Here, we show that despite their frequent self-renewal, macrophages from old mice exhibited numerous signs of aging, such as impaired oxidative respiration. Transcriptomic profiling of aged murine macrophages revealed dysregulation of diverse cellular pathways, especially in cholesterol homeostasis, that manifested in altered oxysterol signatures. Although the levels of numerous oxysterols in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells and plasma exhibited age-associated changes, plasma 24-hydroxycholesterol levels were specifically associated with AMD. These novel findings demonstrate that oxysterol levels can discriminate disease from physiologic aging. Furthermore, modulation of cholesterol homeostasis may be a novel strategy for treating age-associated diseases in which macrophage aging is pathogenic.
A growing bulk of evidence suggests that cholesterol oxidation products, known as oxysterols, are potentially involved in the pathogenesis of major chronic diseases, including atherosclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, and inflammatory bowel disease. Oxysterols are involved in various key steps of these complex processes, mainly thanks to their ability to act through up-regulation of oxidative stress, inflammation, and cell toxicity. This review summarizes the current knowledge of the effects induced by these compounds on cells, after their accumulation in the arterial wall, brain, and intestine. This evidence might help to develop innovative strategies to counteract the progression of these chronic inflammatory human diseases.
It is now established that cholesterol oxidation products (oxysterols) are involved in several events underlying Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis. Of note, certain oxysterols cause neuron dysfunction and degeneration but, recently, some of them have been shown also to have neuroprotective effects. The present study, which aimed to understand the potential effects of 24-hydroxycholesterol (24-OH) against the intraneuronal accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau protein, stressed these latter effects. A beneficial effect of 24-OH was demonstrated in SK-N-BE neuroblastoma cells, and is due to its ability to modulate the deacetylase sirtuin 1 (SIRT1), which contributes to preventing the neurotoxic accumulation of the hyperphosphorylated tau protein. Unlike 24-OH, 7-ketocholesterol (7-K) did not modulate the SIRT1-dependent neuroprotective pathway. To confirm the neuroprotective role of 24-OH, in vivo experiments were run on mice that express human tau without spontaneously developing tau pathology (hTau mice), by means of the intracerebroventricular injection of 24-OH. 24-OH, unlike 7-K, was found to completely prevent the hyperphosphorylation of tau induced by amyloid β monomers. These data highlight the importance of preventing the loss of 24-OH in the brain, and of maintaining high levels of the enzyme SIRT1, in order to counteract neurodegeneration.
Autophagy has been shown to be stimulated in advanced atherosclerotic plaques by metabolic stress, inflammation and oxidized lipids. The lack of published studies addressing the potential stimulation of pro-survival autophagy by oxysterols, a family of cholesterol oxidation products, has prompted our study. Thus, the goal of the current study is to elucidate the molecular mechanism of the autophagy induced by 27-hydroxycholesterol (27-OH), that is one of the most abundant oxysterols in advanced atherosclerotic lesions, and to assess whether the pro-oxidant effect of the oxysterol is involved in the given response. Here we showed that 27-OH, in a low micromolar range, activates a pro-survival autophagic response in terms of increased LC3 II/LC3 I ratio and Beclin 1, that depends on the up-regulation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathways as a potential result of an intracellular reactive oxygen species increase provoked by the oxysterol in human promonocytic U937 cells. Moreover, 27-OH induced autophagy is dependent on the relation between nuclear factor erythroid 2 p45-related factor 2 (Nrf2)-dependent antioxidant response and p62. The data obtained highlight the involvement of cholesterol oxidation products in the pathogenesis of oxidative stress related chronic diseases like atherosclerosis. Therefore, deeply understanding the complex mechanism and generating synthetic or natural molecules targeting this survival mechanism might be very promising tools in the prevention of such diseases.
OSBP binds, extracts and transfers sterols and phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate (PI(4)P between liposomes, but the sequence of steps at the membrane surface leading to ligand removal is poorly characterized. In this study, we used dual polarization interferometry (DPI), a label-free surface analytical technique, to characterize the interaction of recombinant, purified OSBP as it flows over immobilized dioleoyl-phosphatidylcholine (DOPC) bilayers containing PI(4)P, cholesterol or 25-hydroxycholesterol. Kinetics of membrane interaction were analyzed for PI(4)P-binding and phosphorylation mutants of OSBP. Wild-type OSBP demonstrated a distinctive association with immobilized DOPC bilayers containing 1-8 mol% PI(4)P that was characterized by initial saturable binding followed by desorption, indicative of PI(4)P extraction. In support of this conclusion, an OSBP mutant with impaired binding and extraction of PI(4)P was stably absorbed to PI(4)P-containing membranes, while a pleckstrin homology domain mutant did not associate with PI(4)P-containing membranes. The inclusion of &gt;2 mol% cholesterol, but not 25-hydroxycholesterol, in membranes, enhanced the absorption of the wild-type OSBP. A phosphomimetic of OSBP with enhanced in vitro sterol binding activity displayed membrane interaction properties similar to wild-type. These real-time flow studies allow us to dissect the association of OSBP with PI(4)P into discrete components; initial recruitment to PI(4)P membranes by the PH domain, detection and extraction of PI(4)P, and desorption due to ligand depletion.
Cytochrome P450 3A (CYP3A) enzymes metabolize approximately half of all drugs on the market. Since the endogenous compounds 4β-hydroxycholesterol (4β-HC) and 25-hydroxycholesterol (25-HC) are generated from cholesterol via CYP3A enzymes, we examined whether the plasma levels of 4β-HC and 25-HC reflect hepatic CYP3A4 activity by using a CYP3A-humanized mouse model, in which the function of endogenous Cyp3a was genetically replaced by human CYP3A. CYP3A-humanized mice have great advantages for evaluation of the relationship between hepatic CYP3A protein levels and plasma and hepatic levels of 4β-HC and 25-HC. Levels of CYP3A4 protein in the liver microsomes of CYP3A-humanized mice were increased by treatment with pregnenolone-16α-carbonitrile, a CYP3A inducer. Hepatic and plasma levels of 4β-HC and 25-HC normalized by cholesterol were significantly correlated with hepatic CYP3A4 protein levels. In addition, in vitro studies using human liver microsomes showed that the formation of 4β-HC was strongly inhibited by a CYP3A inhibitor, while the inhibitory effect of the CYP3A inhibition on the formation of 25-HC was weak. These results suggested that CYP3A mainly contributed to the formation of 4β-HC in human liver microsomes, whereas other factors may be involved in the formation of 25-HC. In conclusion, the in vivo studies using CYP3A-humanized mice suggest that plasma 4β-HC and 25-HC levels reflect hepatic CYP3A4 activity. Furthermore, taking the results of in vitro studies using human liver microsomes into consideration, 4β-HC is a more reliable biomarker of hepatic CYP3A activity.
Dietary habits may strongly influence intestinal homeostasis. Oxysterols, the oxidized products of cholesterol present in cholesterol-containing foodstuffs, have been shown to exert pro-oxidant and pro-inflammatory effects, altering intestinal epithelial layer and thus contributing to the pathogenesis of human inflammatory bowel diseases and colon cancer. Extra virgin olive oil polyphenols possess antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, and concentrate in the intestinal lumen, where may help in preventing intestinal diseases. In the present study we evaluated the ability of an extra virgin olive oil phenolic extract to counteract the pro-oxidant and pro-inflammatory action of a representative mixture of dietary oxysterols in the human colon adenocarcinoma cell line (Caco-2) undergoing full differentiation into enterocyte-like cells. Oxysterols treatment significantly altered differentiated Caco-2 cells redox status, leading to oxidant species production and a decrease of GSH levels, after 1 h exposure, followed by an increase of cytokines production, IL-6 and IL-8, after 24 h. Oxysterol cell treatment also induced after 48 h an increase of NO release, due to the induction of iNOS. Pretreatment with the phenolic extract counteracted oxysterols effects, at least in part by modulating one of the main pathways activated in the cellular response to the action of oxysterols, the MAPK-NF-kB pathway. We demonstrated the ability of the phenolic extract to directly modulate p38 and JNK1/2 phosphorylation and activation of NF-kB, following its inhibitor IkB phosphorylation. The phenolic extract also inhibited iNOS induction, keeping NO concentration at the control level. Our results suggest a protective effect at intestinal level of extra virgin olive oil polyphenols, able to prevent or limit redox unbalance and the onset and progression of chronic intestinal inflammation.
Rett syndrome (RS) is a pervasive neurodevelopmental disorder resulting from loss-of-function mutations in the X-linked gene methyl-Cpg-binding protein 2 (MECP2). Using a well-defined model for RS, the C57BL6/Mecp2tm1.1Bird mouse, we have previously found a moderate but persistently lower rate of cholesterol synthesis, measured in vivo, in the brains of Mecp2-/y mice, starting from about the third week after birth. There was no genotypic difference in the total cholesterol concentration throughout the brain at any age. This raised the question of whether the lower rate of cholesterol synthesis in the mutants was balanced by a fall in the rate at which cholesterol was converted via cholesterol 24-hydroxylase (Cyp46A1) to 24S-hydroxycholesterol (24S-OHC), the principal route through which cholesterol is ordinarily removed from the brain. Here, we show that while there were no genotypic differences in the concentrations in plasma and liver of three cholesterol precursors (lanosterol, lathosterol, and desmosterol), two plant sterols (sitosterol and campesterol), and two oxysterols (27-hydroxycholesterol [27-OHC] and 24S-OHC), the brains of the Mecp2 -/y mice had significantly lower concentrations of all three cholesterol precursors, campesterol, and both oxysterols, with the level of 24S-OHC being ~20% less than in their Mecp2 +/y controls. Together, these data suggest that coordinated regulation of cholesterol synthesis and catabolism in the central nervous system is maintained in this model for RS. Furthermore, we speculate that the adaptive changes in these two pathways conceivably resulted from a shift in the permeability of the blood-brain barrier as implied by the significantly lower campesterol and 27-OHC concentrations in the brains of the Mecp2-/y mice.
This study was aimed at evaluating changes in CYP3A activity following and during pregnancy by analyzing metabolic markers for CYP3A activity, which can help avoid unnecessary drug exposure and invasive sampling.
Forty-eight pregnant women and 25 non-pregnant women were enrolled in this study. Plasma and urine samples were collected from the pregnant women during each trimester and from the non-pregnant women for evaluation of metabolic markers for CYP3A activity. Metabolic markers for CYP3A activity were measured using GC-MS.
An increased 4β-hydroxycholesterol/cholesterol ratio, consistent with high CYP3A activity, was observed in pregnant women compared with that in non-pregnant women; however, no differences were observed among trimesters. No significant differences were observed in urinary markers.
We observed an increase in the activity of CYP3A following but not during pregnancy when measured using the 4β-hydroxycholesterol/cholesterol ratio. In addition, based on our results, we suggest that the plasma 4β-hydroxycholesterol/cholesterol ratio be used to measure CYP3A activity in pregnant women.
Oxysterols play important roles in development and diseases, but can be highly challenging to analyze. To ensure satisfactory measurements, oxysterols must typically be separated with chromatography prior to detection. Here, we will devote attention to the chromatography of oxysterols, focusing on gas chromatography and liquid chromatography. We will present the role of stationary phases, mobile phases, and dimensions and geometries of particles/columns. We discuss how these parameters may affect the chromatography, regarding factors such as speed and resolution. Finally, we present some less explored avenues for separation of oxysterols.
The seven transmembrane G protein-coupled receptor EBV-induced gene 2 (EBI2), also known as GPR183, is expressed in particular in immune cells. Activated by its endogenous ligands, which are a group of oxysterols, it functions as a chemo-attractant receptor, mediating cell migration. In coordination with other receptors, EBI2 plays important roles in controlling the migration of immune cells during the course of a T-dependent Ab response in the spleen. In recent years, it has become clear that EBI2 also has other roles to play in the immune system. Thus, EBI2 seems to be involved in innate immune responses, such as those mediated by TLR signaling, and it has been implicated in regional immune responses, including immune responses in the CNS. In this review, we describe the functions of EBI2 in B cells, T cells, and dendritic cells during the course of a T-dependent Ab response in the spleen. Furthermore, we review the existing evidence supporting a role for EBI2 in local immune responses and in autoimmune diseases, with a special focus on immune responses in the CNS. Finally, we discuss which type of role EBI2 may play in autoimmune diseases, and we give our opinion about the paths of future research in EBI2.
Cholesterol and its oxygenated metabolites, such as oxysterols, are intensively investigated as potential players in the pathophysiology of brain disorder. Altered oxysterol levels have been described in patients with numerous neuropsychiatric disorders, including Alzheimer's disease, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy, and Smith-Lemli-Opitz Syndrome. Recent studies have shown that Autism Spectrum Disorders are associated with disruption of cholesterol metabolism. The present study aimed at investigating the profile of oxysterols in plasma and their association with clinical parameters in patients with Autism Spectrum Disorders. Thirty-six children with Autism Spectrum Disorders and thirty-eight healthy children, from Sfax (a southern area of Tunisia) matched for age and sex, were included in the study. The severity of Autism Spectrum Disorders was evaluated using the childhood autism rating scale. Standard lipid profile (total cholesterol, triglycerides, and high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol), serum glucose, high-sensitive C-reactive protein and orosomucoid levels were measured utilizing standard techniques. Oxysterol levels were measured by isotope-dilution gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. Standard lipid profile, serum glucose, high-sensitive C-reactive protein and orosomucoid levels were similar between the two studied populations. Compared to the control group, children with Autism Spectrum Disorders showed a significant higher plasma level of 24-hydroxycholesterol, while borderline significance was observed for 7α-hydroxycholesterol, and 25-hydroxycholersterol. In patients, 24-hydroxycholesterol was inversely correlated with age. Multivariate analysis showed that high plasma levels of 24-hydroxycholesterol are independent risk factors for Autism Spectrum Disorders. On the other hand, an analysis of the receiver's operating characteristics proved that the measured parameters recorded satisfactory levels of specificity and sensitivity. The present study provides evidence that Autism Spectrum Disorders are associated with altered levels in circulating oxysterols. The finding that 24-hydroxycholesterol is an independent risk factor for the disease and suggests the use of this oxysterol as a diagnostic tool in Autism Spectrum Disorders.
Dyslipidaemia and hyperglycaemia are associated with ovarian failure and both have been related to hypothyroidism. Hypothyroidism promotes anovulation and ovarian cysts in women and reduces the size of follicles and the expression of aromatase in the ovary of rabbits. Considering that ovarian steroidogenesis and ovulation depend on lipid metabolism and signalling, the aim of the present study was to analyse the effect of hypothyroidism on the lipid content and expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) δ in the ovary. Ovaries from female rabbits belonging to the control (n=7) and hypothyroid (n=7) groups were processed to measure total cholesterol (TC), triacylglycerol (TAG) and glycogen content, as well as to determine the presence of granules containing oxidized lipids (oxysterols and lipofuscin) and the relative expression of perilipin A (PLIN-A) and PPARδ. Hypothyroidism increased TC and glycogen content, but reduced TAG content in the ovary. This was accompanied by a reduction in the expression of PLIN-A in total and cytosolic extracts, changes in the presence of granules containing oxidative lipids and low PPARδ expression. The results of the present study suggest that hypothyroidism modifies the content and signalling of lipids in the ovary, possibly affecting follicle maturation. These results could improve our understanding of the association between hypothyroidism and infertility in females.
The aim of this paper was to more completely study the mitochondrial CYP27A1 initiated acidic pathway of cholesterol metabolism. The mitochondrial CYP27A1 initiated pathway of cholesterol metabolism (acidic pathway) is known to synthesize two well-described vital regulators of cholesterol/lipid homeostasis, (25R)-26-hydroxycholesterol (26HC) and 25-hydroxycholesterol (25HC). Both 26HC and 25HC have been shown to be subsequently 7α-hydroxylated by Cyp7b1; reducing their regulatory abilities and furthering their metabolism to chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA). Cholesterol delivery into the inner mitochondria membrane, where CYP27A1 is located, is considered the pathway's only rate-limiting step. To further explore the pathway, we increased cholesterol transport into mitochondrial CYP27A1 by selectively increased expression of the gene encoding the steroidogenic acute transport protein (StarD1). StarD1 overexpression led to an unanticipated marked down-regulation of oxysterol 7α-hydroxylase (Cyp7b1), a marked increase in 26HC, and the formation of a third vital regulatory oxysterol, 24(S)-hydroxycholesterol (24HC), in B6/129 mice livers. To explore the further metabolism of 24HC, as well as, 25HC and 26HC, characterizations of oxysterols and bile acids using three murine models (StarD1 overexpression, Cyp7b1-/-, Cyp27a1-/-) and human Hep G2 cells were conducted. This report describes the discovery of a new mitochondrial-initiated pathway of oxysterol/bile acid biosynthesis. Just as importantly, it provides evidence for CYP7B1 as a key regulator of three vital intracellular regulatory oxysterol levels.
24-Hydroxycholesterol (24HC) is the main brain cholesterol metabolite, which level in the circulation is significantly changed under physiological and pathological conditions. Here, we have studied the effect of 24HC on the inotropic responses to β-adrenoceptor (AR) stimulation.
Electrical stimulation-evoked contractions were recorded in isolated atria from mice. Fluorescent dyes, Fluo-4 and DAF-FM, were used for estimation of Ca2+ transient and NO production, respectively.
We revealed that 24HC in the submicromolar range attenuated β-AR-induced positive inotropy in isolated atria. This was accompanied by a decrease in Ca2+ transient and unchanged nitric oxide (NO) production. However, β1-AR-induced positive inotropy and enhancement of Ca2+ transient were increased by 24HC due to suppression of NO production. Only β2-AR-dependent inotropy and enhancement of Ca2+ transient were decreased by 24HC in a NO-independent manner. Inhibition of phosphodiesterase (PDE) suppressed effect of 24HC on β2-AR-dependent contractility as well as on non-subtype specific β-AR activation. Moreover, 24HC counteracted positive inopropic action of PDE inhibitors, IBMX and rolipam. Thus, 24HC modulates the effects of β1- and β2-AR stimulation via different mechanisms linked with change in activity of NO synthase or PDE, respectively. Under conditions of non-selective activation of β-ARs, the depressant effect of 24HC related with β2-AR-dependent signaling dominates.
We suggest that 24HC could serve as a modulator of atrial β-AR signaling, contributing to regulation of contractility.
The mechanisms controlling CD4+ T cell switching from an effector to an anti-inflammatory (IL-10+) phenotype play an important role in the persistence of chronic inflammatory diseases. Here, we identify the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway as a key regulator of this process. Pathway analysis of cultured cytokine-producing human T cells reveals a significant association between IL-10 and cholesterol metabolism gene expression. Inhibition of the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway with atorvastatin or 25-hydroxycholesterol during switching from IFNγ+ to IL-10+ shows a specific block in immune resolution, defined as a significant decrease in IL-10 expression. Mechanistically, the master transcriptional regulator of IL10 in T cells, c-Maf, is significantly decreased by physiological levels of 25-hydroxycholesterol. Strikingly, progression to rheumatoid arthritis is associated with altered expression of cholesterol biosynthesis genes in synovial biopsies of predisposed individuals. Our data reveal a link between sterol metabolism and the regulation of the anti-inflammatory response in human CD4+ T cells.
Cholesterol is one of the most important chemical substances as a structural element in human cells, and it is very susceptible to oxidation reactions that form oxysterol. Oxysterols exhibit almost the exact structure as cholesterol and a cholesterol precursor (7-dehydrocholesterol) with an additional hydroxyl, epoxy or ketone moiety. The oxidation reaction is performed via an enzymatic or non-enzymatic mechanism. The wide array of enzymatic oxysterols encountered in the human body varies in origin and function. Oxysterols establish a concentration equilibrium in human body fluids. Disease may alter the equilibrium, and oxysterols may be used as a diagnostic tool. The current review presents the possibility of using non-enzymatic oxysterols and disturbances in enzymatic oxysterol equilibrium in the human body as a potential biomarker for diagnosing and/or monitoring of the progression of various diseases.
Circulating cholesterol levels have been linked to PD, but not directly to brain physiology.
To assess whether brain cholesterol metabolism is related to PD.
Sixty PD patients and 64 controls were recruited from an academic movement disorder clinic (2009-2012). Thirty-five PD patients and 33 controls returned approximately 36 months later. Fasting plasma (S)24-OH-cholesterol (brain-derived cholesterol metabolite) and 27-OH-cholesterol (peripheral cholesterol metabolite) were quantified. Odds ratios for PD were derived from logistic regression models, adjusting for potential confounders. Relationships between the oxysterols and clinical measurements were explored using Spearman correlation coefficients.
Mean age of PD subjects was 63.8 ± 8.3 years and disease duration was 5.0 ± 5.4 years. Plasma (S)24-OH-cholesterol levels were inversely associated with the odds of having PD, with an odds ratio of 0.92 (95% confidence interval: 0.87-0.97) for each 1-ng/mL increase (P = 0.004). Compared to the lowest tertile, the odds ratio was 0.34 (0.12-0.98) for the second tertile (P = 0.045) and 0.08 (0.02-0.31) for the highest tertile (P &lt; 0.001). Higher (S)24-OH-cholesterol levels also were correlated with better sense of smell (r = 0.35; P = 0.01). No significant associations were found between clinical measures and 27-OH-cholesterol, a peripheral cholesterol metabolite. Furthermore, (S)24-OH-cholesterol levels were stable over time, whereas 27-OH-cholesterol decreased with time in both cases and controls.
Results indicate that plasma (S)24-OH-cholesterol (possibly reflecting brain cholesterol metabolism) is inversely linked to PD, is relatively stable over time, and may serve as a new biomarker for PD. Further investigation is necessary to determine the mechanistic and clinical implications. © 2019 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.
Rare and ultra-rare diseases (URDs) are often chronic and life-threatening conditions that have a profound impact on sufferers and their families, but many are notoriously difficult to detect. Niemann-Pick disease type C (NP-C) serves to illustrate the challenges, benefits and pitfalls associated with screening for ultra-rare inborn errors of metabolism (IEMs). A comprehensive, non-systematic review of published information from NP-C screening studies was conducted, focusing on diagnostic methods and study designs that have been employed to date. As a key part of this analysis, data from both successful studies (where cases were positively identified) and unsuccessful studies (where the chosen approach failed to identify any cases) were included alongside information from our own experiences gained from the planning and execution of screening for NP-C. On this basis, best-practice recommendations for ultra-rare IEM screening are provided. Twenty-six published screening studies were identified and categorised according to study design into four groups: 1) prospective patient cohort and family-based secondary screenings (18 studies); 2) analyses of archived 'biobank' materials (one study); 3) medical chart review and bioinformatics data mining (five studies); and 4) newborn screening (two studies). NPC1/NPC2 sequencing was the most common primary screening method (Sanger sequencing in eight studies and next-generation sequencing [gene panel or exome sequencing] in five studies), followed by biomarker analyses (usually oxysterols) and clinical surveillance.
Historically, screening for NP-C has been based on single-patient studies, small case series, and targeted cohorts, but the emergence of new diagnostic methods over the last 5-10 years has provided opportunities to screen for NP-C on a larger scale. Combining clinical, biomarker and genetic diagnostic methods represents the most effective way to identify NP-C cases, while reducing the likelihood of misdiagnosis. Our recommendations are intended as a guide for planning screening protocols for ultra-rare IEMs in general.
The membrane dipole potential, ψ d, is an electrical potential difference with a value typically in the range 150-350 mV (positive in the membrane interior) which is located in the lipid headgroup region of the membrane, between the linkage of the hydrocarbon chains to the phospholipid glycerol backbone and the adjacent aqueous solution. At its physiological level in animal plasma membranes (up to 50 mol%), cholesterol makes a significant contribution to ψ d of approximately 65 mV; the rest arising from other lipid components of the membrane, in particular phospholipids. Via its effect on ψ d, cholesterol may modulate the activity of membrane proteins. This could occur through preferential stabilization of protein conformational states. Based on its effect on ψ d, cholesterol would be expected to favour protein conformations associated with a small local hydrophobic membrane thickness. Via its membrane condensing effect, which also produces an increase in ψ d, cholesterol could further modulate interactions of polybasic cytoplasmic extensions of membrane proteins, in particular P-type ATPases, with anionic lipid headgroups on the membrane surface, thus leading to enhanced conformational stabilization effects and changes to ion pumping activity.
We recently communicated that the free-radical-mediated oxidation (autoxidation) of cholesterol yields a more complex mixture of hydroperoxide products than previously appreciated. In addition to the epimers of the major product, cholesterol 7-hydroperoxide, the epimers of each of the regioisomeric 4- and 6-hydroperoxides are formed as is the 5α-hydroperoxide in the presence of a good H-atom donor. Herein, we complete the story by reporting the products resulting from competing peroxyl radical addition to cholesterol, the stereoisomeric cholesterol-5,6-epoxides, which account for 12% of the oxidation products, as well as electrophilic dehydration products of the cholesterol hydroperoxides, 4-, 6-, and 7-ketocholesterol. Moreover, we interrogate how their distribution-and abundance relative to the H-atom abstraction products-changes in the presence of good H-atom donors, which has serious implications for how these oxysterols are used as biomarkers. The resolution and quantification of all autoxidation products by LC-MS/MS was greatly enabled by the synthesis of a new isotopically labeled cholesterol standard and corresponding selected autoxidation products. The autoxidation of cholesteryl acetate was also investigated as a model for the cholesterol esters which abound in vivo. Although esterification of cholesterol imparts measurable stereoelectronic effects, most importantly reflected in the fact that it autoxidizes at 4 times the rate of unesterified cholesterol, the product distribution is largely similar to that of cholesterol. Deuteration of the allylic positions in cholesterol suppresses autoxidation by H-atom transfer (HAT) in favor of addition, such that the epoxides are the major products. The corresponding kinetic isotope effect ( kH/ kD ∼ 20) indicates that tunneling underlies the preference for the HAT pathway.
The objective of this pilot randomized controlled trial was to investigate the effect of alternate day fasting (ADF) and exercise on serum sterol signatures, which are surrogate markers of cholesterol absorption and biosynthesis.
We randomly assigned 112 overweight or obese participants to four groups: 1) ADF and exercise (E-ADF); 2) ADF; 3) exercise; and 4) control. We studied 31 completers in this exploratory analysis and measured their serum sterol signatures using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry.
After intervention, most serum sterol signatures that correspond to cholesterol metabolism were significantly different between groups (p &lt; 0.05 by analysis of covariance [ANCOVA]). We found no differences in plant sterols, which are markers of cholesterol absorption. In the exercise group, desmosterol, cholesteryl esters, and oxysterols decreased significantly. Furthermore, only changes in physical activity levels negatively correlated with changes in the metabolic ratios of desmosterol and 7-dehydrocholesterol to cholesterol, which reflect cholesterol biosynthesis (r = -0.411; p = 0.030, and r = -0.540; p = 0.003, respectively).
These findings suggest that exercise with or without ADF improves cholesterol metabolism as measured by serum sterol signatures, and increased physical activity has a greater effect on cholesterol biosynthesis than weight reduction or calorie restriction.
Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a lipid-enveloped virion particle that causes infection to the liver, and as part of its life cycle, it disrupts the host lipid metabolic machinery, particularly the cholesterol synthesis pathway. The innate immune response generated by liver resident immune cells is responsible for successful viral eradication. Unfortunately, most patients fail to eliminate HCV and progress to chronic infection. Chronic infection is associated with hepatic fat accumulation and inflammation that triggers fibrosis, cirrhosis, and eventually hepatocellular carcinoma. Despite that the current direct-acting antiviral agents have increased the cure rate of HCV infection, viral genotype and the host genetic background influence both the immune response and lipid metabolism. In this context, recent evidence has shown that cholesterol and its derivatives such as oxysterols might modulate and potentialize the hepatic innate immune response generated against HCV. The impairment of the HCV life cycle modulated by serum cholesterol could be relevant for the clinical management of HCV-infected patients before and after treatment. Alongside, cholesterol levels are modulated either by genetic variations in IL28B, ApoE, and LDLR or by dietary components. Indeed, some nutrients such as unsaturated fatty acids have demonstrated to be effective against HCV replication. Thus, cholesterol modifications may be considered as a new adjuvant strategy for HCV infection therapy by providing a biochemical tool that guides treatment decisions, an improved treatment response and favoring viral clearance. Herein, the mechanisms by which cholesterol contributes to the immune response against HCV infection and how genetic and environmental factors may affect this role are reviewed.
In contrast to cholesterol itself the side-chain oxidized metabolites 24S-hydroxycholesterol (24OH) and 27-hydroxycholesterol (27OH) are able to pass the blood-brain barrier and the blood-CSF barrier. Most 27OH in circulation is formed extracerebrally and according to catheterization experiments about 5 mg of it is taken up by the brain per 24 h. 24OH is almost exclusively produced in the brain and about 6 mg fluxes from the brain into the circulation per 24 h. In addition to these major fluxes a very minor fraction of these two oxysterols flux from the circulation into CSF. Isotope experiments have shown that almost all 27OH in CSF originates from the circulation and evidence has been presented that this is the case also with a substantial part of 24OH. The levels of both 24OH and 27OH in CSF are thus affected by the integrity of the blood-CSF barrier with higher levels when the barrier is defect. Both levels of 24OH and 27OH in CSF are increased in connection with neurodegeneration and in general the increase in 24OH levels is higher than the increase in 27OH levels. A number of observations in different type of patients including measurements of other biochemical markers support that the increase in levels of 24OH due to neurodegeneration is due to a release of this oxysterol or its precursor cholesterol from dying neuronal cells. In contrast the increase in levels of 27OH is likely to be a consequence of reduced metabolism due to loss of the neuronal enzyme CYP7B1. We discuss the driving forces behind the fluxes of oxysterols in the brain, the limitations in the flux across the barriers and the diagnostic potential for side-chain oxidized oxysterols in CSF.
Oxysterol analogs that modulate NMDA receptor function are candidates for therapeutic development to treat neuropsychiatric disorders. However, the cellular actions of these compounds are still unclear. For instance, how these compounds are compartmentalized or trafficked in neurons is unknown. In this study, we utilized a chemical biology approach combining photolabeling and click chemistry. We introduce a biologically active oxysterol analog that contains: (1) a diazirine group, allowing for the permanent labeling of cellular targets, and (2) an alkyne group, allowing for subsequent in situ visualization using Cu2+ catalyzed cycloaddition of an azide-conjugated fluorophore. The physiological properties of this analog at NMDA receptors resemble those of other oxysterols, including occlusion with other oxysterol-like compounds. Fluorescent imaging reveals that the analog accumulates diffusely in the cytoplasm of neurons through an energy-independent mechanism. Overall, this work introduces a novel chemical biology approach to investigate oxysterol actions and introduces a tool useful for further cell biological and biochemical studies of oxysterols.
Cholesterol is an essential molecule for life. It is a component of the cell membrane, and it is a precursor molecule for bile acids, vitamin D and steroid hormones. Cholesterol is actively metabolized, but the impact of endogenous cholesterol metabolites on immune function, especially in the intestine, is poorly understood. In this review, I focus on oxysterols, hydroxylated forms of cholesterol, and their specialized functions in intestinal immunity. Oxysterols act through various intracellular and extracellular receptors and serve as key metabolic signals, coordinating immune activity and inflammation. Our recent work has identified an unexpected link between cholesterol metabolism, innate lymphoid cell function and intestinal homeostasis. We discovered that oxysterol sensing through the G protein-coupled receptor 183 (GPR183) directs the migration of innate lymphoid cells, which is essential for the formation of lymphoid tissue in the colon. Moreover, we found that the interaction of GPR183 with oxysterols regulates intestinal inflammation. I will discuss the therapeutic potential of oxysterols and future possibilities of treating inflammatory bowel disease through the modulation of cholesterol metabolism.
Four new oxysterols 1⁻4 along with previously known oxygenated sterols 5⁻14 were isolated from the sponge Inflatella sp., collected from the Sea of Okhotsk. Structures of 1⁻4 were elucidated by the detailed NMR spectroscopic and mass-spectrometric analyses as well as by comparison of the corresponding experimental data with those reported in literature. The influence of compounds 1⁻14 on the viability of neuronal Neuro2a cells treated by 6-hydroxydopamine and reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation in these cells was investigated.
Throughout life, stress stimuli act upon the brain leading to morphological and functional changes in advanced age, when it is likely to develop neurodegenerative disorders. There is an increasing need to unveil the molecular mechanisms underlying aging, in a world where populations are getting older. Egr-1 (early growth response 1), a transcriptional factor involved in cell survival, proliferation and differentiation - with a role also in memory, cognition and synaptic plasticity, can be implicated in the molecular mechanism of the aging process. Moreover, Heme Oxygenase-1a (HO), a 32 kDa heat-shock protein that converts heme to iron, carbon monoxide and biliverdin, is a key enzyme with neuroprotective properties. Several in vitro and in vivo studies reported that HO-1 could regulate the metabolism of oxysterols, oxidation products of cholesterol that include markers of oxidative stress. Recently, a link between Egr-1 and HO-1 has been demonstrated in mouse lung cells exposed to cigarette smoke. In view of these data, we wanted to investigate whether Egr-1 can be implicated also in the oxysterol metabolism during brain aging. Our results show that Egr-1 expression is differently expressed in the cortex and hippocampus of old mice, as well as the oxysterol profile between these two brain areas. In particular, we show that the cortex experiences in an age-dependent fashion increasing levels of the Egr-1 protein, and that these correlate with the level of HO-1 expression and oxysterol abundance. Such a situation was not observed in the hippocampus. These results are further strenghtened by our observations made with Egr-1 KO mice, confirming our hypothesis concerning the influence of Egr-1 on oxysterol production and accumulation via regulation of the expression of HO-1 in the cortex, but not the hippocampus, of old mice. It is important to notice that most of the oxysterols involved in this process are those usually stimulated by oxidative stress, which would then represent the triggering factor for this mechanism.
Endochondral ossification is the process by which long bones are formed; the process of long bone formation is regulated by numerous factors such as transcription factors, cytokines, and extracellular matrix molecules. Human hormone Nuclear receptors (hHNR) are a family of ligand-regulated transcription factors that are activated by steroid hormones, such as estrogen and progesterone, and various lipid-soluble signals, including retinoic acid, oxysterols, and thyroid hormone. Whole genome microarray data from our previous study revealed that most hHNR's are up-regulated during osteoblast differentiation in hMSCS. NR2F1 was among the highest expressed hHNR during osteogenesis, NR2F1 belongs to the steroid/thyroid hormone nuclear receptor superfamily. NR2F1 is designated as an orphan nuclear receptor because its ligands are unknown. NR2F1 plays a wide range of roles, including cell differentiation, cancer progression, and central and peripheral neurogenesis. Identifying signaling networks involved in osteoblast differentiation is important in orchestrating new therapeutic and clinical applications in bone biology. This study aimed to identify alterations in signaling networks mediated by NR2F1 in osteoblast differentiation. siRNA-mediated down-regulation of NR2F1 leads to impairment in the differentiation of hBMSC-TERT to osteoblast; gene-expression results confirmed the down-regulation of osteoblast markers such as RUNX2, ALPL, OSC, and BSP. Global whole gene expression analysis revealed that most down-regulated genes were associated with osteoblast differentiation (DDIT3, BMP2). Pathway analysis revealed prominent signaling pathways that were down-regulated, including the TGFβ pathway and MAPK pathway. Functional studies on NR2F1 transfected cells, during osteoblast differentiation in combination with TGFβ1 and BMP-2, showed that TGFβ1 does not recover osteoblast differentiation, whereas BMP-2 rescues osteoblast differentiation in NR2F1 siRNA transfected cells. Thus, our results showed that BMP-2 could intervene in NR2F1 down-regulated signaling pathways to recover osteoblast differentiation.
Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome (SLOS) is an autosomal recessive human disease caused by mutations in the gene encoding 7-dehydrocholesterol (7DHC) reductase (DHCR7), resulting in abnormal accumulation of 7DHC and reduced levels of cholesterol in bodily tissues and fluids. A rat model of the disease has been created by treating normal rats with the DHCR7 inhibitor, AY9944, which causes progressive, irreversible retinal degeneration. Herein, we review the features of this disease model and the evidence linking 7DHC-derived oxysterols to the pathobiology of the disease, with particular emphasis on the associated retinal degeneration. A recent study has shown that treating the rat model with cholesterol plus suitable antioxidants completely prevents the retinal degeneration. These findings are discussed with regard to their translational implications for developing an improved therapeutic intervention for SLOS over the current standard of care.
Cholesterol oxidation product 4β‑hydroxycholesterol (4β‑OHC) may possibly be used as an endogenous biomarker of CYP3A enzyme activity and as CYP3A4 is involved in the metabolism of approximately 50% of the drugs in clinical use, the monitoring of CYP3A activity by 4β‑OHC plasma or serum levels, may be of clinical significance. The plasma and serum concentrations of 4α‑hydroxycholesterol (4α‑OHC), an isomer of 4β‑OHC, increase during uncontrolled storage conditions and therefore serve as an indicator of proper handling of samples. A sensitive and simple high-throughput method for the simultaneous quantification of both 4α‑OHC and 4β‑OHC in human plasma and serum was developed utilizing ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography coupled with high resolution mass spectrometry (UHPLC/ESI-HR-MS). The chromatographic analysis was carried out on a Waters HSS T3 C18 reversed phase column with a mobile phase composed of 0,1% formic acid with 200 mg/l sodium acetate, and methanol. 4β‑OHC and 4α‑OHC and also internal standard d7‑4β‑OHC were monitored using HR-MS as sodium adducts, which could not be used as a precursor ions in conventional tandem mass spectrometry methods due to their extensive stability in collision for MS/MS. The use of HR-MS detection enabled avoiding laborious sample derivatization, which is required with triple quadrupole mass spectrometer-based methods to achieve adequate analytical sensitivity for 4β‑OHC, as the underivatized molecule is otherwise poorly ionized to other molecular ions than sodium adduct. Chromatographic separation of 4α‑OHC and 4β‑OHC was obtained and confirmed with standard samples prepared in blank surrogate matrix. The lower limits of quantitation in the assay were 0.5 ng/ml for 4β‑OHC, and 2 ng/ml for 4α‑OHC. Endogenous levels of 4β‑OHC can vary between 10 and 100 ng/ml depending on the possible induction or inhibition of CYP3A4, whereas the levels of 4α‑OHC can vary between 5 and 100 ng/ml, depending on the storage conditions of the samples. Thus, the sensitivity of the assay developed allows for the simultaneous measurement of endogenous levels of 4α‑OHC and 4β‑OHC cost-effectively and with high throughput. The method was successfully used for the determination of 4β‑OHC and 4α‑OHC concentrations in clinical plasma and serum samples collected before and after treatment with a known CYP3A4 inducer rifampicin. The endogenous levels in clinical human samples before treatment varied between 13.4 and 31.9 ng/ml for 4β‑OHC, and between 3.53 and 5.65 ng/ml for 4α‑OHC, and a three-fold increase in 4β‑OHC plasma levels was observed after the rifampicin treatment, while 4α‑OHC levels remained unaffected.
Primary cilia are required for Smoothened to transduce vertebrate Hedgehog signals, but how Smoothened accumulates in cilia and is activated is incompletely understood. Here, we identify cilia-associated oxysterols that promote Smoothened accumulation in cilia and activate the Hedgehog pathway. Our data reveal that cilia-associated oxysterols bind to two distinct Smoothened domains to modulate Smoothened accumulation in cilia and tune the intensity of Hedgehog pathway activation. We find that the oxysterol synthase HSD11β2 participates in the production of Smoothened-activating oxysterols and promotes Hedgehog pathway activity. Inhibiting oxysterol biosynthesis impedes oncogenic Hedgehog pathway activation and attenuates the growth of Hedgehog pathway-associated medulloblastoma, suggesting that targeted inhibition of Smoothened-activating oxysterol production may be therapeutically useful for patients with Hedgehog-associated cancers.
Apolipoprotein E (APOE) is a component of lipid-transporting particles and a recognition ligand for receptors, which bind these particles. The APOE isoform ε2 is a risk factor for age-related macular degeneration; nevertheless, APOE absence in humans and mice does not significantly affect the retina. We found that retinal cholesterol biosynthesis and the levels of retinal cholesterol were increased in Apoe-/- mice, whereas cholesterol elimination by metabolism was decreased. No focal cholesterol deposits were observed in the Apoe-/- retina. Retinal proteomics identified the most abundant cholesterol-related proteins in WT mice and revealed that, of these cholesterol-related proteins, only APOA4 had increased expression in the Apoe-/- retina. In addition, there were changes in retinal abundance of proteins involved in proinflammatory and antiinflammatory responses, cellular cytoskeleton maintenance, vesicular traffic, and retinal iron homeostasis. The data obtained indicate that when APOE is absent, particles containing APOA1, APOA4, and APOJ still transport cholesterol in the intraretinal space, but these particles are not taken up by retinal cells. Therefore, cholesterol biosynthesis inside retinal cells increase, whereas metabolism to oxysterols decreases to prevent cells from cholesterol depletion. These and other compensatory changes underlie only a minor retinal phenotype in Apoe-/- mice.
Cholesterol and cholesterol-derived oxysterols are critical for embryonic development, synapse formation and function, and myelination, among other biological functions. Indeed, alterations in levels of cholesterol, sterol precursors, and oxysterols result in a variety of developmental disorders, emphasizing the importance of cholesterol homeostasis. The ability of xenobiotics to reproduce similar phenotypes by altering cholesterol homeostasis has increasingly become of interest. Therefore, the ability to quantitatively assess alterations in cholesterol homeostasis resulting from exposure to xenobiotics is of value. This unit describes methods for the quantitative assessment of altered post-squalene cholesterol biosynthesis and subsequent oxysterol formation in various sample types using ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS). Understanding alterations in cholesterol homeostasis resulting from xenobiotic exposure can provide key insight into the toxicant's mechanism of action and resulting phenotype. © 2018 by John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.
Cholestane-3β,5α,6β-triol (3β,5α,6β-triol) is formed from cholestan-5,6-epoxide (5,6-EC) in a reaction catalysed by cholesterol epoxide hydrolase, following formation of 5,6-EC through free radical oxidation of cholesterol. 7-Oxocholesterol (7-OC) and 7β-hydroxycholesterol (7β-HC) can also be formed by free radical oxidation of cholesterol. Here we investigate how 3β,5α,6β-triol, 7-OC and 7β-HC are metabolised to bile acids. We show, by monitoring oxysterol metabolites in plasma samples rich in 3β,5α,6β-triol, 7-OC and 7β-HC, that these three oxysterols fall into novel branches of the acidic pathway of bile acid biosynthesis becoming (25R)26-hydroxylated then carboxylated, 24-hydroxylated and side-chain shortened to give the final products 3β,5α,6β-trihydroxycholanoic, 3β-hydroxy-7-oxochol-5-enoic and 3β,7β-dihydroxychol-5-enoic acids, respectively. The intermediates in these pathways may be causative of some phenotypical features of, and/or have diagnostic value for, the lysosomal storage diseases, Niemann Pick types C and B and lysosomal acid lipase deficiency. Free radical derived oxysterols are metabolised in human to unusual bile acids via novel branches of the acidic pathway, intermediates in these pathways are observed in plasma.
Cholesterol is essential for maintaining membrane fluidity in eukaryotes. Additionally, the synthetic cascade of cholesterol results in precursor molecules important for cellular function such as lipid raft formation and protein prenylation. As such, cholesterol homeostasis is tightly regulated. Interestingly, it is now known that some cholesterol precursors and many metabolites serve as active signaling molecules, binding to different classes of receptors including the nuclear receptors. Furthermore, many cholesterol metabolites or their nuclear receptors have been implicated in the regulation of the immune system in normal physiology and disease. Therefore, in this focused review, cholesterol homeostasis and nuclear receptors involved in this regulation will be discussed, with particular emphasis on how these cascades influence the immune system.
Hematopoiesis is sustained throughout life by hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) that are capable of self-renewal and differentiation into hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs). There is accumulating evidence that cholesterol homeostasis is an important factor in the regulation of hematopoiesis. Increased cholesterol levels are known to promote proliferation and mobilization of HSCs, while hypercholesterolemia is associated with expansion of myeloid cells in the peripheral blood and links hematopoiesis with cardiovascular disease. Cholesterol is a precursor to steroid hormones, oxysterols, and bile acids. Among steroid hormones, 17β-estradiol (E2) induces HSC division and E2-estrogen receptor α (ERα) signaling causes sexual dimorphism of HSC division rate. Oxysterols are oxygenated derivatives of cholesterol and key substrates for bile acid synthesis and are considered to be bioactive lipids, and recent studies have begun to reveal their important roles in the hematopoietic and immune systems. 27-Hydroxycholesterol (27HC) acts as an endogenous selective estrogen receptor modulator and induces ERα-dependent HSC mobilization and extramedullary hematopoiesis. 7α,25-dihydroxycholesterol (7α,25HC) acts as a ligand for Epstein-Barr virus-induced gene 2 (EBI2) and directs migration of B cells in the spleen during the adaptive immune response. Bile acids serve as chemical chaperones and alleviate endoplasmic reticulum stress in HSCs. Cholesterol metabolism is dysregulated in hematologic malignancies, and statins, which inhibit de novo cholesterol synthesis, have cytotoxic effects in malignant hematopoietic cells. In this review, recent advances in our understanding of the roles of cholesterol and its metabolites as signaling molecules in the regulation of hematopoiesis and hematologic malignancies are summarized.
Oxysterols, oxidized derivatives of cholesterol found in LDL and atherosclerotic plaques, trigger several biological responses involved in the initiation and progression of atherosclerosis. Endothelial dysfunction, which occurs when vascular homeostasis is altered, plays a key role in the pathogenesis of several metabolic diseases. The contribution of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress to endothelial disfunction is a relatively recent area of investigation. There is a well-established link between LDL oxidation and ER stress but the role played by specific products of lipid oxidation into this interaction is still to be defined. The present study shows that secosterol-B (SEC-B), 3β-hydroxy-5β-hydroxy-B-norcholestane-6βcarboxaldehyde, a cholesterol autoxidation product recently identified in the atherosclerotic plaque, is able to induce ER stress in HUVEC cells, as revealed by significant expansion and change of structure. At low doses, i.e. 1 and 5 μM, cells try to cope with this stress by activating autophagy and the ubiquitin proteasome system in the attempt to restore ER function. However, at higher doses, i.e. 20 μM, cell apoptosis occurs in a pathway that involves early phosphorylation of eIF2α and NF-kB activation, suggesting that the adaptive program fails and the cell activates the apoptotic program. These findings provide additional insight about the role of oxysterols in endothelial dysfunction and its potential involvement in atherosclerotic pathophysiology.
In the present study, we discuss the recent developments in oxysterol research. Exciting results have been reported relating to the involvement of oxysterols in the fields of neurodegenerative disease, especially in Huntington's disease, Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease; in signalling and development, in particular, in relation to Hedgehog signalling; and in cancer, with a special focus on (25R)26-hydroxycholesterol. Methods for the measurement of oxysterols, essential for understanding their mechanism of action in vivo, and valuable for diagnosing rare diseases of cholesterol biosynthesis and metabolism are briefly considered.
Integrins are components of cell-matrix adhesions, and function as scaffolds for various signal transduction pathways. So far no lipid ligand for integrin has been reported. Here we show that a lipid, oxysterol 25-hydroxycholesterol (25HC), directly binds to α5β1 and αvβ3 integrins to activate integrin-focal adhesion kinase (FAK) signaling. Treatment of macrophages and epithelial cells with 25HC results in an increase in activated αvβ3 integrin in podosome and focal adhesion matrix adhesion sites. Moreover, activation of pattern recognition receptor on macrophages induces secretion of 25HC, triggering integrin signaling and the production of proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF and IL-6. Thus, the lipid molecule 25HC is a physiologically relevant activator of integrins and is involved in positively regulating proinflammatory responses. Our data suggest that extracellular 25HC links innate immune inflammatory response with integrin signaling.
So far, the investigation in cancer cell lines of the modulation of cancer growth and progression by oxysterols, in particular 27-hydroxycholesterol (27HC), has yielded controversial results. The primary aim of this study was the quantitative evaluation of possible changes in 27HC levels during the different steps of colorectal cancer (CRC) progression in humans. A consistent increase in this oxysterol in CRC mass compared to the tumor-adjacent tissue was indeed observed, but only in advanced stages of progression (TNM stage III), a phase in which cancer has spread to nearby sites. To investigate possible pro-tumor properties of 27HC, its effects were studied in vitro in differentiated CaCo-2 cells. Relatively high concentrations of this oxysterol markedly increased the release of pro-inflammatory interleukins 6 and 8, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, vascular endothelial growth factor, as well as matrix metalloproteinases 2 and 9. The up-regulation of all these molecules, which are potentially able to favor cancer progression, appeared to be dependent upon a net stimulation of Akt signaling exerted by supra-physiological amounts of 27HC.
