<!DOCTYPE html><html><head>	<meta charset="utf-8">	<title>generación de archivo html</title></head><body>Molecular characterization of 23 cytogenetically confirmed XY females was attempted by screening coding regions of SRY and androgen receptor (AR) genes. Five of the index cases showed sequence variations in various exons of the AR gene: a deletion (n.1911delG) and substitutions n.1761G&gt;A and n.1317C&gt;T in exon 1; n.3510C&gt;T transition in exon 6 and deletion mutation (n.3672delT) in exon 7. Four mutations identified here lead to the formation of truncated receptor protein, involving a substantial loss of AR functional domains which explains the phenotype in the subjects. The n.1761G&gt;A substitution has been previously reported in cases with mild androgen insensitivity. Although the ligand-binding domain was considered as the mutational hot spot in AR gene, we report here 3/5 variations in the N-terminal domain emphasizing the significance of considering the N-terminal domain of AR as well for mutation screening. Our present observation also strengthens the role of AR gene and its direct association with AIS.
Shear wave elastography (SWE) is a recent technique in the assessment of tissue elasticity. Different elastography techniques have been described over the years.Acoustic Radiation Force Impulse Imaging (ARFI) uses mechanical excitation of tissue to create detectable shear waves, a higher shear wave velocity being associated with an increased tissue stiffness.The Virtual Touch Tissue Imaging Quantification (VTIQ) method uses a mechanical push pulse as well, additionally creating a colour-coded map, in which tissue stiffness can be measured within a stored map on the ultrasound device after measurement.ARFI has been used in determining standard values in testes of a healthy study collective, VTIQ has already been used in the evaluation of unclear scrotal masses.Both techniques allow an operator-independent examination without application of mechanical pressure. The aim of this study was to determine whether there is a statistically significant difference between shear wave velocity values of both techniques in a healthy collective.
Twenty patients without known testicular pathology underwent standard B-mode sonography and additional shear wave elastography in the ARFI mode as well as the VTIQ technique of both testes using the Siemens Acuson S2000™ and S3000™ ultrasound devices (Siemens HealthCare, Erlangen, Germany).Measurements of shear wave velocity were performed in the upper pole, the central portion and the lower pole separately for each testis. Values were described in m/s.Statistical evaluation was performed using paired t-test analysis.
We measured a mean shear wave velocity of 0.81 m/s using ARFI and 1.07 m/s with VTIQ.Shear wave velocities determined by VTIQ were all significantly higher than values gained in the ARFI mode. (p &lt; 0.001 to p = 0.007). Values were between 0.22 and 0.29 m/s higher, when the examination was performed using VTIQ.
ARFI and VTIQ elastography modes both proved to be feasible techniques in the assessment of testicular tissue elasticity. Consideration of higher values for VTIQ is important, when different elastography measurement results are compared, especially for the application of devices in a clinical setting, e.g. in the work-up of scrotal masses.A calculable factor for a comparison between both devices is desirable, but to be further assessed in largerstudies.
Human sex determination (SD) involves complex mutually antagonistic genetic interactions of testis- and ovary-determining pathways. For many years, both male and female SD were considered to be regulated by a linear cascade of pro-male and pro-female genes, respectively; however, it has become clear that male and female development is achieved through the repression of the alternative state. A gene determining the formation of a testis may function by repressing the female state and vice versa. Uniquely in development, SD is achieved by suppression of the alternate fate and maintained in adulthood by a mutually antagonistic double-repressive pathway. Here, we review genetic data generated through large-scale sequencing approaches that are changing our view of how this system works, including the recently described recurrent NR5A1 p.R92W mutation associated with testis development in 46,XX children. We also review some of the unique challenges in the field to establish that mutations, such as this are pathogenic. The impending surge of new genetic data on human SD from sequencing projects will create opportunities for the development of mechanistic models that will clarify how the system operates and importantly provide data to understand how selection and developmental processes interact to direct the evolution of SD across species.
46,XX male sex reversal syndrome is one of the rarest sex chromosomal aberrations. The presence of SRY gene on one of the X chromosomes is the most frequent cause of this syndrome. Based on Y chromosome profile, there are SRY-positive and SRY-negative forms. The purpose of our study was to report first case series of Iranian patients and describe the different clinical appearances based on their genetic component. From the 8,114 azoospermic and severe oligozoospermic patients referred to Royan institute, we diagnosed 57 cases as sex reversal patients. Based on the endocrinological history, we performed karyotyping, SRY and AZF microdeletion screening. Patients had a female karyotype. According to available hormonal reports of 37 patients, 16 cases had low levels of testosterone (43.2%). On the other hand, 15 males were SRY positive (90.2%), while they lacked the spermatogenic factors encoding genes on Yq. Commencing the testicular differentiation in males, the SRY gene is considered to be very important in this process. Due to homogeneous results of karyotyping and AZF deletion, there are both positive and negative SRY cases that show similar sex reversal phenotypes. Evidences show that there could be diverse phenotypic differences that could be raised from various reasons.
The 46,XY female is characterised by a male karyotype and female phenotype arising due to any interruption in the sexual development pathways in utero. The cause is usually genetic and various genes are implicated.
Herein we describe a 46,XY woman who was first diagnosed with androgen insensitivity syndrome (testicular feminisation) at 18 years; however, this was later questioned due to the presence of intact Müllerian structures. The clinical phenotype suggested several susceptibility genes including SRY, DHH, NR5A1, NR0B1, AR, AMH, and AMHR2. To study candidate genes simultaneously, we performed whole genome sequencing. This revealed a novel and likely pathogenic missense variant (p.Arg130Pro, c.389G&gt;C) in SRY, one of the major genes implicated in complete gonadal dysgenesis, hence securing this condition over androgen insensitivity syndrome as the cause of the patient's disorder of sexual development.
This case highlights the emerging clinical utility of whole genome sequencing as a tool in differentiating disorders of sexual development.
Genetic studies in Disorders of Sex Development (DSD), representing a wide spectrum of developmental or functional conditions of the gonad, have mainly been oriented towards the coding genome. Application of genomic technologies, such as whole-exome sequencing, result in a molecular genetic diagnosis in ∼50% of cases with DSD. Many of the genes mutated in DSD encode transcription factors such as SRY, SOX9, NR5A1, and FOXL2, characterized by a strictly regulated spatiotemporal expression. Hence, it can be hypothesized that at least part of the missing genetic variation in DSD can be explained by non-coding mutations in regulatory elements that alter gene expression, either by reduced, mis- or overexpression of their target genes. In addition, structural variations such as translocations, deletions, duplications or inversions can affect the normal chromatin conformation by different mechanisms. Here, we review non-coding defects in human DSD phenotypes and in animal models. The wide variety of non-coding defects found in DSD emphasizes that the regulatory landscape of known and to be discovered DSD genes has to be taken into consideration when investigating the molecular pathogenesis of DSD.
The primary objective of this pilot study is to determine and compare the residence time in the vagina of biomarkers of semen exposure for up to 15 days post exposure. The biomarkers are prostate-specific antigen (PSA), Y chromosome DNA, the sex determining region of the Y chromosome (SRY) and testis-specific protein Y-encoded 4 (TSPY4). The secondary objectives are to determine if biomarker concentrations differed between intercourse and inoculation groups, to establish whether the sampling frequency post exposure affected biomarker concentrations and decay profile and to determine if biomarker concentrations in vaginal swabs obtained by the participant at home were similar to swabs obtained by the nurse in the clinic.
We randomized healthy women to unprotected intercourse (n=17) versus vaginal inoculation with the male partner's semen in the clinic (n=16). Women were then further randomized to have vaginal swabs obtained at either 7 or 4 time points after semen exposure, up to 15 days post exposure, either obtained at home by the participant or in the clinic by the research nurse.
PSA and SRY were markers of recent semen exposure. TSPY4 was detectable in approximately 50% of participants at 15 days post exposure. Unprotected intercourse resulted in significantly higher concentrations of select biomarkers. Sampling frequency and home versus clinic sampling had no significant effect on biomarker concentrations.
Objective biomarkers of recent or distant semen exposure may have great utility for verifying protocol compliance in a variety of clinical trials.
Sex determining region Y gene (SRY) is located on Y chromosome and encodes a protein with 229 amino acids. In this study, ORF region of SRY with a length of 690 bp was synthesized using PCR and ligated to pET28a (+), then transformed in E.coli DH5α. E.coli BL21 (DE3) strain was chosen to express recombinant bovine SRY protein. A set of optimization steps was taken including different concentrations of IPTG, glucose, and temperatures at differed incubation times after the induction. Results showed that temperature points and different concentrations of IPTG and glucose had a significant effect (p &lt; 0.01) on total protein and recombinant bovine SRY. After purification, various temperatures and concentrations of IPTG showed meaningful effects (p &lt; 0.01) on the solubility of expressed recombinant SRY. Highest soluble rSRY protein amount was achieved where 0.5 mM IPTG and 0.5% glucose was used at 20°C during induction. In the absence of glucose, the highest amount of soluble recombinant SRY levels were achieved at the concentrations of 0.8 mM of IPTG at 28°C, 20°C, and 1.5 mM IPTG at 37°C during induction for 16, 24, and 8 hours, respectively. Regarding the results obtained in this study, it could be stated that by decreasing temperature and inducer concentration, soluble bovine SRY protein expression increases.
Cardiolipin and phosphatidic acid-binding protein (CLPABP) is a pleckstrin homology domain-containing protein and is localized on the surface of mitochondria of cultured cells as a large protein-RNA complex. To analyze the physiological functions of CLPABP, we established and characterized a CLPABP knockout (KO) mouse. Although expression levels of CLPABP transcripts in the developmental organs were high, CLPABP KO mice were normal at birth and grew normally when young. However, old male mice presented a fatty phenotype, similar to that seen in metabolic syndrome, in parallel with elevated male- and age-dependent CLPABP gene expression. One of the reasons for this obesity in CLPABP KO mice is dependence on increases in leptin concentration in plasma. The leptin transcripts were also upregulated in the adipose tissue of KO mice compared with wild-type (WT) mice. To understand the difference in levels of the transcriptional product, we focused on the effect of CLPABP on the stability of mRNA involving an AU-rich element (ARE) in its 3'UTR dependence on the RNA stabilizer, human antigen R (HuR), which is one of the CLPABP-binding proteins. Increase in stability of ARE-containing mRNAs of leptin by HuR was antagonized by the expression of CLPABP in cultured cells. Depletion of CLPABP disturbed the normal subcellular localization of HuR to stress granules, and overexpression of CLPABP induced instability of leptin mRNA by inhibiting HuR function. Consequently, leptin levels in old male mice might be regulated by CLPABP expression, which might lead to body weight control.
In a 46 XY individual, the presence of the Y chromosome harboring the testis-determining factor (SRY) triggers testis determination and differentiation. In a 46 XX individual, the absence of SRY and the activation of genes associated with the female pathway lead to ovarian development. The latter process has long been considered as a default pathway. However, recent studies have cast doubts on this dogma. Here, after a brief overview of the main steps of ovarian development, we focus on three genes WNT4, RSPO1 and FOXL2 that are essential for ovarian determination, differentiation and/or maintenance. Special attention is paid to FOXL2 whose mutations are responsible for the blepharophimosis syndrome, often associated with female infertility, and for cancer. We highlight the cooperation of WNT4, RSPO1 and FOXL2 within a regulatory network and the need for further research to better understand their role in defining and maintaining ovarian identity.
A general problem is posed by analysis of transcriptional thresholds governing cell fate decisions in metazoan development. A model is provided by testis determination in therian mammals. Its key step, Sertoli cell differentiation in the embryonic gonadal ridge, is initiated by SRY, a Y-encoded architectural transcription factor. Mutations in human SRY cause gonadal dysgenesis leading to XY female development (Swyer syndrome). Here, we have characterized an inherited mutation compatible with either male or female somatic phenotypes as observed in an XY father and XY daughter, respectively. The mutation (a crevice-forming substitution at a conserved back surface of the SRY high mobility group box) markedly destabilizes the domain but preserves specific DNA affinity and induced DNA bend angle. On transient transfection of diverse human and rodent cell lines, the variant SRY exhibited accelerated proteasomal degradation (relative to wild type) associated with increased ubiquitination; in vitro susceptibility to ubiquitin-independent ("default") cleavage by the 20S core proteasome was unchanged. The variant's gene regulatory activity (as assessed in a cellular model of the rat embryonic XY gonadal ridge) was reduced by 2-fold relative to wild-type SRY at similar levels of mRNA expression. Chemical proteasome inhibition restored native-like SRY expression and transcriptional activity in association with restored occupancy of a sex-specific enhancer element in principal downstream gene Sox9, demonstrating that the variant SRY exhibits essentially native activity on a per molecule basis. Our findings define a novel mechanism of impaired organogenesis, accelerated ubiquitin-directed proteasomal degradation of a master transcription factor leading to a developmental decision poised at the edge of ambiguity.
The SRY gene (SRY) provides instructions for making a transcription factor called the sex-determining region Y protein. The sex-determining region Y protein causes a fetus to develop as a male. In this study, SRY of 15 spices included of human, chimpanzee, dog, pig, rat, cattle, buffalo, goat, sheep, horse, zebra, frog, urial, dolphin and killer whale were used for determine of bioinformatic differences.
Nucleotide sequences of SRY were retrieved from the NCBI databank. Bioinformatic analysis of SRY is done by CLC Main Workbench version 5.5 and ClustalW (http:/www.ebi.ac.uk/clustalw/) and MEGA6 softwares.
The multiple sequence alignment results indicated that SRY protein sequences from Orcinus orca (killer whale) and Tursiopsaduncus (dolphin) have least genetic distance of 0.33 in these 15 species and are 99.67% identical at the amino acid level. Homosapiens and Pantroglodytes (chimpanzee) have the next lowest genetic distance of 1.35 and are 98.65% identical at the amino acid level.
These findings indicate that the SRY proteins are conserved in the 15 species, and their evolutionary relationships are similar.
Somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) provides an excellent model for studying epigenomic reprogramming during mammalian development. We mapped the whole genome and whole methylome for potential anomalies of mutations or epimutations in SCNT-generated dogs with XY chromosomal sex but complete gonadal dysgenesis, which is classified as 78, XY disorder of sex development (DSD). Whole genome sequencing revealed no potential genomic variations that could explain the pathogenesis of DSD. However, extensive but stochastic anomalies of genome-wide DNA methylation were discovered in these SCNT DSD dogs. Persistent abnormal hypermethylation of the SRY gene was observed together with its down-regulated mRNA and protein expression. Failure of SRY expression due to hypermethylation was further correlated with silencing of a serial of testis determining genes, including SOX9, SF1, SOX8, AMH and DMRT1 in an early embryonic development stage at E34 in the XY(DSD) gonad, and high activation of the female specific genes, including FOXL2, RSPO1, CYP19A1, WNT4, ERα and ERβ, after one postnatal year in the ovotestis. Our results demonstrate that incomplete demethylation on the SRY gene is the driving cause of XY(DSD) in these XY DSD dogs, indicating a central role of epigenetic regulation in sex determination.
In humans, dysregulation of the sex determining gene SRY-box 9 (SOX9) leads to disorders of sex development (DSD). In mice, knock-out of Sox9 prior to sex determination leads to XY sex reversal, while Sox9 inactivation after sex determination leads to spermatogenesis defects. SOX9 specifies the differentiation and function of Sertoli cells from somatic cell precursors, which then orchestrate the development and maintenance of other testicular cell types, largely through unknown mechanisms. Here, we describe a novel testicular target gene of SOX9, Ets variant factor 5 (ETV5), a transcription factor responsible for maintaining the spermatogonial stem cell niche. Etv5 was highly expressed in wild-type XY but not XX mouse fetal gonads, with ETV5 protein localized in the Sertoli cells, interstitial cells and germ cells of the testis. In XY Sox9 knock-out gonads, Etv5 expression was strongly down-regulated. Similarly, knock-down of SOX9 in the human Sertoli-like cell line NT2/D1 caused a decrease in ETV5 gene expression. Transcriptomic analysis of NT2/D1 cells over-expressing SOX9 showed that ETV5 expression was increased in response to SOX9. Moreover, chromatin immunoprecipitation of these cells, as well as of embryonic mouse gonads, showed direct binding of SOX9 to ETV5 regulatory regions. We demonstrate that SOX9 was able to activate ETV5 expression via a conserved SOX site in the 5' regulatory region, mutation of which led to loss of activation. In conclusion, we present a novel target gene of SOX9 in the testis, and suggest that SOX9 regulation of ETV5 contributes to the control of male fertility.
Testis development is dependent on the key sex-determining factors SRY and SOX9, which activate the essential ligand FGF9. Although FGF9 plays a central role in testis development, it is unable to induce testis formation on its own. However, other growth factors, including activins and TGFβs, also present testis during testis formation. In this study, we investigated the potential of FGF9 combined with activin and TGFβ to induce testis development in cultured XX gonads. Our data demonstrated differing individual and combined abilities of FGF9, activin and TGFβ to promote supporting cell proliferation, Sertoli cell development and male germ line differentiation in cultured XX gonads. FGF9 promoted proliferation of supporting cells in XX foetal gonads at rates similar to those observed in vivo during testis cord formation in XY gonads but was insufficient to initiate testis development. However, when FGF9, activin and TGFβ were combined, aspects of testicular development were induced, including the expression of Sox9, morphological reorganisation of the gonad and deposition of laminin around germ cells. Enhancing β-catenin activity diminished the testis-promoting activities of the combined growth factors. The male promoting activity of FGF9 and the combined growth factors directly or indirectly extended to the germ line, in which a mixed phenotype was observed. FGF9 and the combined growth factors promoted male germ line development, including mitotic arrest, but expression of pluripotency genes was maintained, rather than being repressed. Together, our data provide evidence that combined signalling by FGF9, activin and TGFβ can induce testicular characteristics in XX gonads.
In mammals, sex determination defines the differentiation of the bipotential genital ridge into either testes or ovaries. Sry, the mammalian Y-chromosomal testis-determining gene, is a master regulator of male sex determination. It acts to switch the undifferentiated genital ridge towards testis development, triggering the adoption of a male fate. Sry initiates a cascade of gene networks through the direct regulation of Sox9 expression and promotes supporting cell differentiation, Leydig cell specification, vasculature formation and testis cord development. In the absence of Sry, alternative genetic cascades, including female sex-determining genes RSPO1, Wnt4/β-catenin and Foxl2, are involved in the formation of female genitalia and the maintenance of female ovarian development. The mutual antagonisms between male and female sex-determining pathways are crucial in not just the initiation but also the maintenance of the somatic sex of the gonad throughout the organism's lifetime. Any imbalances in above sex-determining genes can cause disorders of sex development in humans and mice. In this review, we provide a detailed summary of the expression profiles, biochemical properties and developmental functions of Sry and SoxE genes in embryonic testis development and adult gonadal development. We also briefly summarize the dedicate balances between male and female sex-determining genes in mammalian sex development, with particular highlights on the molecular actions of Sry and Sox9 transcription factors.
Face transplantation and other composite tissue transplantation (CTA) are permissive to transplantation tolerance. The real reason, that composite tissue containing bone achieves transplantation immune tolerance more easily than the composite tissue without the bone is not clear. The chimerism may be the main mechanism in the progress of inducing the transplantation tolerance by CTA. We currently have established a non-human Primate Vascularized Osteomyocutaneous Allografts Model. To test the chimerism which comes from donor after the transplantation, we developed a method which combined reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and real-time quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR) technique using primers specific for Macaca fascicularis sex determination region on the Y chromosome (SRY) gene. With the method, we estimated the level of the chimerism. 
Sertoli cells (SCs) play a crucial role in testis differentiation, development and function, determining the magnitude of sperm production in sexually mature animals. For over 40 years, it has been considered that these key testis somatic cells stop dividing during early pre-pubertal phase, between around 10 to 20 days after birth respectively in mice and rats, being after that under physiological conditions a stable and terminally differentiated population. However, evidences from the literature are challenging this dogma. In the present study, using several important functional markers (Ki-67, BrdU, p27, GATA-4, Androgen Receptor), we investigated the SC differentiation status in 36 days old and adult Wistar rats, focusing mainly in the transition region (TR) between the seminiferous tubules (ST) and the rete testis. Our results showed that SCs in TR remain undifferentiated for a longer period and, although at a lesser degree, even in adult rats proliferating SCs were observed in this region. Therefore, these findings suggest that, different from the other ST regions investigated, SCs residing in the TR exhibit a distinct functional phenotype. These undifferentiated SCs may compose a subpopulation of SC progenitors that reside in a specific microenvironment capable of growing the ST length if needed from this particular testis region. Moreover, our findings demonstrate an important aspect of testis function in mammals and opens new venues for other experimental approaches to the investigation of SC physiology, spermatogenesis progression and testis growth. Besides that, the TR may represent an important site for pathophysiological investigations and cellular interactions in the testis. 
To explore that it is necessary to routinely detect chromosomes in infertile patients, we investigated peripheral blood lymphocyte karyotype in 16,294 male infertile patients in the north-east of China and analysed the incidence and type of chromosomal anomaly and polymorphism. G-banding karyotype analysis of peripheral blood lymphocytes was performed in 16,294 cases. Semen analysis was performed three times in all the men. PCR and FISH confirmed the presence of the SRY gene. The rate of chromosomal anomaly in the 16,294 male infertile patients was 4.15% (677/16,294). The rates of chromosomal anomaly were 0.24% in normal semen group, 12.6% in light oligoasthenospermia group, 4.7% in moderate-to-severe oligoasthenospermia group and 9.59% in azoospermia group. There are two male infertile patients with 45,X chromosome karyotype. One X male patient had confirmed the presence of the SRY gene and FISH analysis demonstrated its location on the p arm of chromosome 13. The other X male patient had not found SRY gene in its whole-genome DNA. Meanwhile, sperm motility is slightly oligo-asthenozoospermic at the age of 35-39 and nearly azoospermic at the age of 40-45. As the rates of chromosomal anomaly are 0.24% and 12.6% even in normal semen group and light oligoasthenospermia group, the rates of chromosomal polymorphism are 5.36% and 25.51% in normal semen group and light oligoasthenospermia group, respectively; it is necessary to explore peripheral blood lymphocyte karyotype in all infertile couples. We mentioned that Y, 1, 2, 9 and 12 chromosomes were quite important about male infertility. These findings demonstrate that autosomal retention of SRY can be submicroscopic and emphasise the importance of PCR and FISH in the genetic workup of the monosomic X male. At the same time, it suggested that male infertility might be related to meiotic disturbances with spermatogenetic arrest in Y-autosome translocations, which could result in infertility by reduction of sperm production. Last but not least, ageing is one of the factors that could reduce sperm motility and quality.
To investigate the usefulness of preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) for the patient affected by congenital contractural arachnodactyly (CCA) and spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA).
Multiple displacement amplification (MDA) was performed for whole genome amplification (WGA) of biopsied trophectoderm (TE) cells. Direct mutation detection by sequencing and next-generation sequencing (NGS)-based single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) haplotyping were used for CCA diagnosis. Direct sequencing of the PCR products and sex determination by amplification of sex-determining region Y (SRY) gene were used for SBMA diagnosis. After PGD, the unaffected blastocyst (B4) was transferred in the following frozen embryo transfer (FET).
In this PGD cycle, sixteen MII oocytes were inseminated by ICSI with testicular spermatozoa. Four blastocysts (B4, B5, B10, B13) were utilized for TE cell biopsy on day 5 after ICSI. After PGD, B4 was unaffected by CCA and SBMA. B5 was affected by CCA and carried SBMA. B10 was unaffected by CCA and carried SBMA. B13 was affected by CCA and unaffected by SBMA. B4 was the only unaffected blastocyst and transferred into the uterus for the subsequent FET cycle. The accuracy of PGD was confirmed by amniocentesis at 21 weeks of gestation. A healthy boy weighing 2850 g was born by cesarean section at the 38th week of gestation.
PGD is a valid screening tool for patienst affected of CCA and SBMA to prevent transmission of these genetic diseases from parents to children.
Cell lineages of the early human gonad commit to one of the two mutually antagonistic organogenetic fates, the testis or the ovary. Some individuals with a 46,XX karyotype develop testes or ovotestes (testicular or ovotesticular disorder of sex development; TDSD/OTDSD), due to the presence of the testis-determining gene, SRY Other rare complex syndromic forms of TDSD/OTDSD are associated with mutations in pro-ovarian genes that repress testis development (e.g. WNT4); however, the genetic cause of the more common non-syndromic forms is unknown. Steroidogenic factor-1 (known as NR5A1) is a key regulator of reproductive development and function. Loss-of-function changes in NR5A1 in 46,XY individuals are associated with a spectrum of phenotypes in humans ranging from a lack of testis formation to male infertility. Mutations in NR5A1 in 46,XX women are associated with primary ovarian insufficiency, which includes a lack of ovary formation, primary and secondary amenorrhoea as well as early menopause. Here, we show that a specific recurrent heterozygous missense mutation (p.Arg92Trp) in the accessory DNA-binding region of NR5A1 is associated with variable degree of testis development in 46,XX children and adults from four unrelated families. Remarkably, in one family a sibling raised as a girl and carrying this NR5A1 mutation was found to have a 46,XY karyotype with partial testicular dysgenesis. These unique findings highlight how a specific variant in a developmental transcription factor can switch organ fate from the ovary to testis in mammals and represents the first missense mutation causing isolated, non-syndromic 46,XX testicular/ovotesticular DSD in humans.
Two species of the genus Tokudaia lack the Y chromosome and SRY, but several Y-linked genes have been rescued by translocation or transposition to other chromosomes. Tokudaia muenninki is the only species in the genus that maintains the Y owing to sex chromosome-autosome fusions. According to previous studies, many SRY pseudocopies and other Y-linked genes have evolved by excess duplication in this species. Using RNA-seq and RT-PCR, we found that ZFY, EIF2S3Y, TSPY, UTY, DDX3Y, USP9Y, and RBMY, but not UBA1Y, had high deduced amino acid sequence similarity and similar expression patterns with other rodents, suggesting that these genes were functional. Based on FISH and quantitative real-time PCR, all of the genes except for UTY and DDX3Y were amplified on the X and Y chromosomes with approximately 10-66 copies in the male genome. In a comparative analysis of the 372.4-kb BAC sequence and Y-linked gene transcripts from T. muenninki with the mouse Y genomic sequence, we observed that multiple-copy genes in the ancestral Y genome were nonfunctional, indicating that the gene functions were assumed by amplified copies. We also found a LTR sequence at the distal end of a SRY duplication unit, suggesting that unequal sister chromatid exchange mediated by retrotransposable elements could have been involved in SRY amplification. Our results revealed that the Y-linked genes were rescued from degeneration via translocations to other sex chromosomal regions and amplification events in T. muenninki.
A simple and fast method was established to identify the sex types of the rat-derived cell strains. The single copy X-chromosome-linked gene AR and the single copy Y-chromosome-linked gene Sry were both detected with qPCR for the rat genomic DNA sample and the AR/Sry ratio was calculated. According to the law of the AR/Sry ratio, a new method to identify the sex types of the rat-derived cell strains was developed. The new assay was proved effective. The new assay showed advantages over the traditional sex type identification PCR methods, which detected only the Sry gene. Moreover, the new method was used to identify the sex types of two rat-derived cell strains unknown for the sex types and the results were confirmed with the in situ hybridization. Finally, the problem of the cross contamination between the female and the male samples was addressed and discussed extensively. 
To investigate the phenotype-genotype association of isodicentromere Y chromosome by analysis of two female patients carrying the chromosome with sexual development disorders.
The karyotypes of the two patients were determined by application of conventional G banding of peripheral blood samples and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). PCR was applied to detect the presence of SRY gene.
Conventional karyotype analysis showed case 1 to be a mosaic: mos.45,X[38]/46,X,+mar[151]/47,XY,+mar[5]/47,X,+mar × 2[2]/46,XY[4], FISH showed that 12 different cell lines were presented in the karyotype of case 1 and partial cell lines with SRY gene, the marker is an isodicentromere Y chromosome [idic(Y)(p)]. No mutation was found in the SRY gene. The karyotype of case 2 was mos.45,X[25]/46,X,+mar[35]. FISH showed the marker to be an idic(Y)(p) without the SRY gene.
The karyotype of patients carrying idic(Y)(p) seems unstable, and female patients have the characteristics of short stature and secondary sexual hypoplasia. Karyotype analysis combined with FISH analysis can accurately determine the breakpoint of idic(Y) and identify the types of complex mosaic, which may facilitate genetic counseling and prognosis.
Transcription factor Sox9 plays a crucial role in determining the fate of several cell types and is a primary factor in regulation of gonadal development. Present study reports full-length cDNA sequence of Sox9a gene and partial coding sequence (cds) of Sox9b (two duplicate orthologs of Sox9 gene) from Clarias batrachus. The coding region of Sox9a gene encoded a peptide of 460 amino acids. The partial cds of Sox9b with the length of 558bp was amplified that codes for 186 amino acids. Quantitative Real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis revealed that Sox9a and Sox9b mRNA expression was significantly higher in gonads and brain tissues. Furthermore Sox9a and Sox9b mRNA expression levels were high during preparatory and pre-spawning phases and decreased gradually with onset of spawning and post-spawning phases of reproductive cycles in gonads. Chitosan nanoconjugated sLHRH (CsLHRH) of particle size 133.0nm and zeta potential of 34.3mV were synthesized and evaluated against naked sLHRH (salmon luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone). The entrapment efficiency of CsLHRH was 63%. CsLHRH nanoparticles increased the expression level of Sox9 transcripts in gonads and steroid hormonal levels in blood of male and female. Thus, our findings clearly indicate that Sox9 genes play essential role during seasonal variation of gonads. Besides, the current study reports that sustained release delivery-system will be helpful for proper gonadal development of fish. To the best of our knowledge, till date no study has been reported on nanodelivery of sLHRH and their effect on reproductive gene expression in fish. 
BORIS, a paralog of the multifunctional CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) gene is restricted to testis and normally not present in females. It is aberrantly activated in various human cancers including cancer breast. Using immunohistochemistry, western blot and/or RT-PCR, significantly higher levels of BORIS expression were reported in the neutrophils of cancer breast patients. We hypothesized that Flow Cytometry might be a better technique for objective quantitative evaluation of BORIS in neutrophils and we wanted to investigate if BORIS would discriminate between benign and malignant breast lesions.
The study included 85 females; 52 breast cancer, 13 benign breast lesions and 20 age-matched healthy controls. BORIS expression in the neutrophils was detected by Flow Cytometry.
High level of BORIS was detected in all malignant (64.4 ± 16.6%) and benign cases (67 ± 12.3), mean florescent intensity ratio (MFIR) of 7.2 ± 4.1 and 7 ± 3.5, median 5.8 and 6.6%; and staining index (SI) 8.3 ± 3.9 and 8.2 ± 3.4, median 7.6 and 7.9 respectively vs.13.4 ± 11.5% MFI 1.8 ± 0.7, median1.6 and SI 2.6 ± 0.69, median 2.5 for the control. BORIS level was comparable in the malignant and benign group (P = 0.934) and significantly higher than control (P = 0.0001). There was no correlation between neutrophil BORIS expression and ER/PR status, HER-2/neu expression or tumor stage or size.
Increased BORIS expression in peripheral blood neutrophils is associated with both benign and malignant breast lesions; apparently, increased proliferation of breast tissue is the determining factor. This excludes BORIS as a tumor marker but it does not jeopardize its value as a potential therapeutic target. © 2016 International Clinical Cytometry Society.
On Thursday 9 May 1991, the world awoke to front-page news of a breakthrough in biological research. From Washington to Wollongong, newspapers, radio and TV were abuzz with the story of a transgenic mouse in London called Randy. Why was this mouse so special? The mouse in question was a chromosomal female (XX) made male by the presence of a transgene containing the Y chromosome gene Sry This sex-reversal provided clear experimental proof that Sry was the elusive mammalian sex-determining gene. Twenty-five years on, we reflect on what this discovery meant for our understanding of how males and females arise and what remains to be understood.
A critical transcription factor required for mammalian male sex determination is SRY (sex determining region on the Y chromosome). The expression of SRY in precursor Sertoli cells is one of the initial events in testis development. The current study was designed to determine the impact of environmentally induced epigenetic transgenerational inheritance on SRY binding during gonadal sex determination in the male. The agricultural fungicide vinclozolin and vehicle control (DMSO) exposed gestating females (F0 generation) during gonadal sex determination promoted the transgenerational inheritance of differential DNA methylation in sperm of the F3 generation (great grand-offspring). The fetal gonads in F3 generation males were used to identify potential alterations in SRY binding sites in the developing Sertoli cells. Chromatin immunoprecipitation with an SRY antibody followed by genome-wide promoter tiling array (ChIP-Chip) was used to identify alterations in SRY binding. A total of 81 adjacent oligonucleotide sites and 173 single oligo SRY binding sites were identified to be altered transgenerationally in the Sertoli cell vinclozolin lineage F3 generation males. Observations demonstrate the majority of the previously identified normal SRY binding sites were not altered and the altered SRY binding sites were novel and new additional sites. The chromosomal locations, gene associations and potentially modified cellular pathways were investigated. In summary, environmentally induced epigenetic transgenerational inheritance of germline epimutations appears to alter the cellular differentiation and development of the precursor Sertoli cell SRY binding during gonadal sex determination that influence the developmental origins of adult onset testis disease.
The phenotypic spectrum of patients carrying NR5A1 mutations ranges from 46,XY gonadal dysgenesis to male infertility. Phenotypic variability could be due to digenic or oligogenic inheritance of pathogenic variants in other testis-determining genes. Here, exome sequencing identified 2 pathogenic de novo NR5A1 mutations in 2 patients with 46,XY gonadal dysgenesis, p.Q206Tfs*20 and p.Arg313Cys. The latter patient also carried a missense mutation in MAP3K1. Our data extend the number of NR5A1 gene mutations associated with gonadal dysgenesis. The combination of an NR5A1 mutation with a MAP3K1 variant may explain the phenotypic variability associated with NR5A1 mutations.
The current study sought to clarify the role of bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs) and adipose tissue derived mesenchymal stem cells (AD-MSCs) in repressing nephropathy in the experimental model. Moreover, the aim of this work was extended to compare between stem cells role and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor in kidney repair.
Isolation and preparation of MSCs culture, flow cytometry using CD34, CD44 and CD105 cell surface markers, biochemical analyses for determination of serum creatinine, urea, transforming growth factor β (TGF-β), cystatin C (CYS-C) and urinary N-Acetyl-ß-D-Glucosaminidase (UNAG), and histopathological investigation of kidney tissue sections were performed.
The results of the present study revealed that single intravenous infusion of MSCs either derived from bone marrow or adipose tissue was able to enhance renal reparative processes through significantly decreased serum creatinine, urea, TGF-β and CYS-C levels as well as UNAG level and significantly increase glomerular filtration rate. Additionally, the histopathological investigations of kidney tissues showed that MSCs have significant regenerative effects as evidenced by the decrease in focal inflammatory cells infiltration, focal interstitial nephritis and congested glomeruli as well as degenerated tubules.
The current data provided distinct evidence about the favourable impact of AD-MSCs and BM-MSCs in attenuation of cyclosporine-induced nephropathy in rats through their ability to promote functional and structural kidney repair via transdifferentiation.
Phosphofructokinase-1 (PFK-1), a major regulatory glycolytic enzyme, has been implicated in the functions of astrocytes and neurons. Here, we report that PFK-1 negatively regulates neurogenesis from neural stem cells (NSCs) by targeting pro-neural transcriptional factors. Using in vitro assays, we found that PFK-1 knockdown enhanced, and PFK-1 overexpression inhibited the neuronal differentiation of NSCs, which was consistent with the findings from NSCs subjected to 5 h of hypoxia. Meanwhile, the neurogenesis induced by PFK-1 knockdown was attributed to the increased proliferation of neural progenitors and the commitment of NSCs to the neuronal lineage. Similarly, in vivo knockdown of PFK-1 also increased neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus. Finally, we demonstrated that the neurogenesis mediated by PFK-1 was likely achieved by targeting mammalian achaete-scute homologue-1 (Mash 1), neuronal differentiation factor (NeuroD), and sex-determining region Y (SRY)-related HMG box 2 (Sox2). All together, our results reveal PFK-1 as an important regulator of neurogenesis. 
Devil facial tumour disease (DFTD) is an infectious tumour disease and was hypothesised to be transmitted by allograft during biting based on two cytogenetic findings of DFTD tumours in 2006. It was then believed that DFTD tumours were originally from a female devil. In this study the devil sex-determining region Y (SRY) gene was PCR amplified and sequenced, and six pairs of devil SRY PCR primers were used for detection of devil SRY gene fragments in purified DFTD tumour cell lines. Using three pairs of devil SRY PCR primers, devil SRY gene sequence was detected by PCR and sequencing in genomic DNA of DFTD tumour cell lines from six male devils, but not from six female devils. Four out of six DFTD tumour cell lines from male devils contained nucleotides 288-482 of the devil SRY gene, and another two DFTD tumour cell lines contained nucleotides 381-577 and 493-708 of the gene, respectively. These results indicate that the different portions of the SRY gene in the DFTD tumours of the male devils were originally from the male hosts, rejecting the currently believed DFTD allograft transmission theory. The reasons why DFTD transmission was incorrectly defined as allograft are discussed.
Maleness in mammals is genetically determined by the Y chromosome. On the Y chromosome SRY is known as the mammalian male-determining gene. Both placental mammals (Eutheria) and marsupial mammals (Metatheria) have SRY genes. However, only eutherian SRY genes have been empirically examined by functional analyses, and the involvement of marsupial SRY in male gonad development remains speculative.
In order to demonstrate that the marsupial SRY gene is similar to the eutherian SRY gene in function, we first examined the sequence differences between marsupial and eutherian SRY genes. Then, using a parsimony method, we identify 7 marsupial-specific ancestral substitutions, 13 eutherian-specific ancestral substitutions, and 4 substitutions that occurred at the stem lineage of therian SRY genes. A literature search and molecular dynamics computational simulations support that the lineage-specific ancestral substitutions might be involved with the functional differentiation between marsupial and eutherian SRY genes. To address the function of the marsupial SRY gene in male determination, we performed luciferase assays on the testis enhancer of Sox9 core (TESCO) using the marsupial SRY. The functional assay shows that marsupial SRY gene can weakly up-regulate the luciferase expression via TESCO.
Despite the sequence differences between the marsupial and eutherian SRY genes, our functional assay indicates that the marsupial SRY gene regulates SOX9 as a transcription factor in a similar way to the eutherian SRY gene. Our results suggest that SRY genes obtained the function of male determination in the common ancestor of Theria (placental mammals and marsupials). This suggests that the marsupial SRY gene has a function in male determination, but additional experiments are needed to be conclusive.
Discordance between sexual phenotype and the 46,XY sex chromosome complement may be found in certain disorders of sexual development (DSD). Many of these DSD patients with female external genitalia and secondary sex characteristics have undescended testes and male internal genitalia. Causative mutations involving genes of the sex determining pathway, including the androgen receptor, SRY and the 5-alpha-reductase genes, are well-known, but the origin of other cases remain unresolved. In this report, we introduce our collection of lymphoblastoid lines derived from female patients with a 46,XY karyotype. These cell lines have been deposited and registered with the JCRB Cell Bank. They are available for comparison with other DSD cases and for further characterization of genetic loci involved in the mammalian sex determining pathway.
Brain sexual differentiation is orchestrated by precise coordination of sex steroid hormones. In some species, programming of select male brain regions is dependent upon aromatization of testosterone to estrogen. In mammals, these hormones surge during the organizational and activational periods that occur during perinatal development and adulthood, respectively. In various fish and reptiles, incubation temperature during a critical embryonic period results in male or female sexual differentiation, but this can be overridden in males by early exposure to estrogenic chemicals. Testes development in mammals requires a Y chromosome and testis determining gene SRY (in humans)/Sry (all other therian mammals), although there are notable exceptions. Two species of spiny rats: Amami spiny rat (Tokudaia osimensis) and Tokunoshima spiny rat (Tokudaia tokunoshimensis) and two species of mole voles (Ellobius lutescens and Ellobius tancrei), lack a Y chromosome/Sry and possess an XO chromosome system in both sexes. Such rodent species, prototherians (monotremes, who also lack Sry), and fish and reptile species that demonstrate temperature sex determination (TSD) seemingly call into question the requirement of Sry for brain sexual differentiation. This review will consider brain regions expressing SRY/Sry in humans and rodents, respectively, and potential roles of SRY/Sry in the brain will be discussed. The evidence from various taxa disputing the requirement of Sry for brain sexual differentiation in mammals (therians and prototherians) and certain fish and reptilian species will be examined. A comparative approach to address this question may elucidate other genes, pathways, and epigenetic modifications stimulating brain sexual differentiation in vertebrate species, including humans.
Exogenous androgen supplement is an optional treatment for micropenis; however, its use in childhood is controversial due to potential side effects.
Twenty-three children (mean age: 4.07±3.4 years) with micropenis of unknown causes harboring the 46,XY karyotype were recruited in an open prospective study. Androgen receptor (AR), steroid 5α-reductase-2 (SRD5A2), and SRY genes were sequenced; 2.5% dihydrotestosterone (DHT) transdermal gel (0.1-0.3 mg/kg/day) was applied and titrated within the normal DHT serum reference ranges. Stretched penile length (SPL) was measured before therapy, and after 1, 3 and 6 months of DHT gel treatment, respectively.
Two patients were found with AR gene mutations and five patients with SRD5A2 gene mutations. Average stretched penile lengths (SPLs) were 1.68±0.6 cm at baseline and 2.2±0.66 cm, 2.6±0.59 cm and 2.9±0.55 cm (mean ± 1 SD) after 1, 3 and 6 months of treatment, respectively. Fourteen cases (61%) reached standard penile length ranges (&gt;-2.5 SD) and medication was discontinued; six cases (26%) were satisfied with the improved penile lengths despite failing to reach the aged matched standards. Three infants (13%) discontinued the medication after 3 months due to anxiety about the potential side effects. No significant side effects were found except the elevated DHT serum levels after therapy.
Short term and local application of DHT at low doses in patients with micropenis could accelerate penile growth effectively without evident side effects; however, precautions still need be taken due to the paucity of long term study and the lack of ideal DHT dosage.
Infertility is a common complication in diabetic men, mainly due to the loss of germ cells by apoptotic cell death. However, effective and safe approaches to prevent diabetic induction of testicular apoptosis for diabetic patients have not been available. Resveratrol (RSV), a group of compounds called polyphenols from plants, has been indicated its promising used clinically for cancers and cardiovascular diseases. Therefore, the present study aimed determining whether RSV attenuates type 1 diabetes (T1D)-induced testicular apoptotic cell death in a mouse model. We found that testicular apoptosis and oxidative stress levels were significantly higher in T1D mice than control mice. In addition, the phosphorylation level of metabolism-related Akt and GSK-3β was downregulated and Akt negative regulators PTEN, PTP1B and TRB3 were upregulated in the T1D group. These effects were partially prevented by RSV treatment. Nrf2 and its downstream genes, such as NQO-1, HO-1, SOD, catalase and metallothionein were significantly upregulated by RSV treatment. In addition, RSV-induced Nrf2 activation was found due to Keap1 degradation, mainly reliant on p62 that functions as an adaptor protein during autophagy. These results indicate that the attenuation of T1D-induced testicular oxidative stress and apoptosis by RSV treatment was mainly related to Akt-mediated Nrf2 activation via p62-dependent Keap1 degradation.
CREB-binding protein (CBP, CREBBP, KAT3A) and its closely related paralogue p300 (EP300, KAT3B), together termed p300/CBP, are histone/lysine acetyl-transferases that control gene expression by modifying chromatin-associated proteins. Here, we report roles for both of these chromatin-modifying enzymes in mouse sex determination, the process by which the embryonic gonad develops into a testis or an ovary. By targeting gene ablation to embryonic gonadal somatic cells using an inducible Cre line, we show that gonads lacking either gene exhibit major abnormalities of XY gonad development at 14.5 dpc, including partial sex reversal. Embryos lacking three out of four functional copies of p300/Cbp exhibit complete XY gonadal sex reversal and have greatly reduced expression of the key testis-determining genes Sry and Sox9. An analysis of histone acetylation at the Sry promoter in mutant gonads at 11.5 dpc shows a reduction in levels of the positive histone mark H3K27Ac. Our data suggest a role for CBP/p300 in testis determination mediated by control of histone acetylation at the Sry locus and reveal a novel element in the epigenetic control of Sry and mammalian sex determination. They also suggest possible novel causes of human disorders of sex development (DSD).
For most temperate and arctic fish species, photoperiod is the key abiotic factor determining the onset of the reproductive cycle, and, for many species, constant long photoperiod seems to have an inhibitory effect. Yet, there is no knowledge about the effect of photoperiod on the onset of the reproductive cycle in northern pike males. The aim of this work was to investigate the potential inhibitory effect of constant long photoperiod on pike males. Batches of fish were reared in triplicate under natural simulated photoperiod (NSP) or constant long photoperiod (CP; 16L:8D) from 14 October 2013 to 14 March 2014. Fish were sampled three times (at the beginning of the photoperiod decrease, at the beginning of the temperature decrease and at the end of the temperature decrease). Morphological parameters, sexual steroid levels and spermatogenetic stages were investigated. Our results showed that CP partially inhibited gonadal development (gonado-somatic index or GSI, %; 2.5% under NSP and 1.2% under CP at day 152), spermatic development (96.2% of spermatozoa under NSP and 69.3% under CP at day 152) and the plasmatic levels of testosterone (7.20 ng/mL under NSP and 2.37 ng/mL under CP at day 152). In conclusion, photoperiod may be one of the determinant factors that control the onset of the reproductive cycle in pike males, but temperature and endogenous rhythms also need to be investigated.
Aortic pathologies exhibit sexual dimorphism, with aneurysms in both the thoracic and abdominal aorta (ie, abdominal aortic aneurysm [AAA]) exhibiting higher male prevalence. Women have lower prevalence of aneurysms, but when they occur, aneurysms progress rapidly. To define mechanisms for these sex differences, we determined the role of sex chromosome complement and testosterone on the location and progression of angiotensin II (AngII)-induced aortic pathologies.
We used transgenic male mice expressing Sry (sex-determining region Y) on an autosome to create Ldlr (low-density lipoprotein receptor)-deficient male mice with an XY or XX sex chromosome complement. Transcriptional profiling was performed on abdominal aortas from XY or XX males, demonstrating 1746 genes influenced by sex chromosomes or sex hormones. Males (XY or XX) were either sham-operated or orchiectomized before AngII infusions. Diffuse aortic aneurysm pathology developed in XY AngII-infused males, whereas XX males developed focal AAAs. Castration reduced all AngII-induced aortic pathologies in XY and XX males. Thoracic aortas from AngII-infused XY males exhibited adventitial thickening that was not present in XX males. We infused male XY and XX mice with either saline or AngII and quantified mRNA abundance of key genes in both thoracic and abdominal aortas. Regional differences in mRNA abundance existed before AngII infusions, which were differentially influenced by AngII between genotypes. Prolonged AngII infusions resulted in aortic wall thickening of AAAs from XY males, whereas XX males had dilated focal AAAs.
An XY sex chromosome complement mediates diffuse aortic pathology, whereas an XX sex chromosome complement contributes to focal AngII-induced AAAs.
Disorders of sex development (DSDs) belong to uncommon pathologies and result from abnormalities during gonadal determination and differentiation. Various gene mutations involved in gonadal determination and differentiation have been associated with gonadal dysgenesis. Despite advances in exploration of genes and mechanisms involved in sex disorders, most children with severe 46,XY DSDs have no definitive etiological diagnoses; therefore, the possibility that other genes or loci might play important roles in these disorders needs to be explored.
Patients (37) clinically suspicious for 46,XY gonadal dysgenesis (46,XY GD) of unknown etiology were studied. SRY, encoding the sex-determining region Y protein, NR5A1, encoding a transcription factor called steroidogenic factor 1, and DHH, encoding the desert hedgehog protein, were directly sequenced. Multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) was used to detect deletions in NR0B1, encoding the DAX1 protein, and WNT4, encoding the WNT4 protein, and real-time PCR (qPCR) confirmed the MLPA data. Other potential loci have been investigated in the complete genome using Array-Comparative Genomic Hybridization, (Array CGH).
The SRY deletion was found in five patients. One each of previously described NR5A1, DHH, and AR (androgen receptor) allelic variants were identified. A pathogenic c.2522G&gt;A AR mutation was found in two affected brothers. A heterozygous partial deletion was found in NR5A1 and heterozygous partial duplications were found in WNT4. These deletions and duplications (del/dup) were confirmed by qPCR. The Array CGH result demonstrated one partial deletion in SOX2-OT, which encodes a member of the SOX family of transcription factors, and the exact region of the rearrangements.
According to our study, del/dup mutations could be checked prior to point mutations, SOX2-OT has a potential role in gonadal dysgenesis, and Array CGH has a prominent role in gonadal dysgenesis diagnosis.
Remarkable progress has been achieved in understanding the mechanisms controlling sex determination, yet the cause for many Disorders of Sex Development (DSD) remains unknown. Of particular interest is a rare XX DSD subtype in which individuals are negative for SRY, the testis determining factor on the Y chromosome, yet develop testes or ovotestes, and both of these phenotypes occur in the same family. This is a naturally occurring disorder in humans (Homo sapiens) and dogs (C. familiaris). Phenotypes in the canine XX DSD model are strikingly similar to those of the human XX DSD subtype. The purposes of this study were to identify 1) a variant associated with XX DSD in the canine model and 2) gene expression alterations in canine embryonic gonads that could be informative to causation. Using a genome wide association study (GWAS) and whole genome sequencing (WGS), we identified a variant on C. familiaris autosome 9 (CFA9) that is associated with XX DSD in the canine model and in affected purebred dogs. This is the first marker identified for inherited canine XX DSD. It lies upstream of SOX9 within the canine ortholog for the human disorder, which resides on 17q24. Inheritance of this variant indicates that XX DSD is a complex trait in which breed genetic background affects penetrance. Furthermore, the homozygous variant genotype is associated with embryonic lethality in at least one breed. Our analysis of gene expression studies (RNA-seq and PRO-seq) in embryonic gonads at risk of XX DSD from the canine model identified significant RSPO1 downregulation in comparison to XX controls, without significant upregulation of SOX9 or other known testis pathway genes. Based on these data, a novel mechanism is proposed in which molecular lesions acting upstream of RSPO1 induce epigenomic gonadal mosaicism.
Cerebral infarction, or ischemia brain stroke, is a common cerebrovascular disease. Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) are widely used to treating ischemia disease such as cardiac infarction. Ultrasonic microvesicles may help the targeting of exogenous factors via localized energy blast. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the effect of ultrasonic microvesicles on the homing of BMSCs on artery thrombosis and the associated molecular mechanisms.
Rat BMSCs were isolated and cultured. Rats were divided into sham, model, BMSCs, and microvesicles groups. Cerebral infarction model was prepared by ligation of cervical artery and middle cerebral artery. 3×106/kg BMSCs were transplanted via tail veins. Microvesicles were used for assisting BMSCs infusion. Sex-determining region Y (SRY) gene expression was measured by Real-time PCR, while 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining was employed for describing the area of cerebral infarction. The activity of caspase 3 was assayed by test kit. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) mRNA/protein levels, were quantified by Real-time PCR, and Western blotting, respectively.
Microvesicle group had significantly elevated SRY expression (p&lt;0.05 compared to BMSCs group). Transplantation of BMSCs remarkably decreased cerebral infarction area, caspase 3 activity or NF-κB expression, and increased VEGF expression (p&lt;0.05 compared to model group). Microvesicle induced BMSCs had more potent effects (p&lt;0.01).
Ultrasound microvesicle facilitated homing of BMSCs in cerebral infarction, and improved infarction disease via up-regulating VEGF expression, inhibiting NF-κB expression, and modulating apoptosis.
Histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9) methylation is a hallmark of heterochromatin. H3K9 demethylation is crucial in mouse sex determination; The H3K9 demethylase Jmjd1a deficiency leads to increased H3K9 methylation at the Sry locus in embryonic gonads, thereby compromising Sry expression and causing male-to-female sex reversal. We hypothesized that the H3K9 methylation level at the Sry locus is finely tuned by the balance in activities between the H3K9 demethylase Jmjd1a and an unidentified H3K9 methyltransferase to ensure correct Sry expression. Here we identified the GLP/G9a H3K9 methyltransferase complex as the enzyme catalyzing H3K9 methylation at the Sry locus. Based on this finding, we tried to rescue the sex-reversal phenotype of Jmjd1a-deficient mice by modulating GLP/G9a complex activity. A heterozygous GLP mutation rescued the sex-reversal phenotype of Jmjd1a-deficient mice by restoring Sry expression. The administration of a chemical inhibitor of GLP/G9a enzyme into Jmjd1a-deficient embryos also successfully rescued sex reversal. Our study not only reveals the molecular mechanism underlying the tuning of Sry expression but also provides proof on the principle of therapeutic strategies based on the pharmacological modulation of epigenetic balance.
Sex affects the risk, treatment responses and outcome of many types of cancers. The mechanism of gender disparity in development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains obscure. Sex-determining region on Y chromosome (SRY) was overexpressed in approximate 84% male patient HCC. Moreover, we are the first to generate a liver-specific transgenic (TG) murine model with overexpression of the male specific gene SRY. Subject to a single intraperitoneal injection N-nitrosodiethylamine (DEN) at day 14, TG and wildtype (WT) mice of both genders were sacrificed at different time points (6-13.5 months). Overexpression of SRY in male TG and ectopic expression of SRY in female TG livers promoted DEN-induced hepatocarcinogenesis compared to age- and sex-matched WT. This accelerated tumorigenesis in TG of both genders was a consequence of increased injury and inflammation, fibrosis, and compensatory enhancement in hepatocytes proliferation secondary to activation of downstream targets Sox9 and platelet-derived growth factor receptor α (PDGFRα)/phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt and c-myc/CyclinD1. In conclusion, activation of SRY and its downstream Sox9 and PDGFRα pathways are commonly involved in male hepatocarcinogenesis, which provides novel insights into gender disparity and sex-specific therapeutic strategies of HCC.
Male sex determination in mammals relies on sex determining region Y-mediated upregulation of sex determining region-box 9 (SOX9) expression in XY gonads, whereas Wnt family member (WNT)/R-spondin 1 signaling and forkhead box L2 (FOXL2) drive female sex determination in XX gonads. Fibroblast growth factor (FGF) 9 signaling ensures sustained SOX9 expression through repression of one of the ovarian pathways (WNT signaling), whereas the significance of FGF-mediated repression of the FOXL2 pathway has not been studied. Previously, we demonstrated that FGFR2 is the receptor for FGF9 in the XY gonad. Whether a specific isoform (FGFR2b or FGFR2c) is required was puzzling. Here, we show that FGFR2c is required for male sex determination. Initially, in developing mouse embryos at 12.5 to 13.5 days postcoitum (dpc), XY Fgfr2c-/- gonads appear as ovotestes, with SOX9 and FOXL2 expression predominantly localized to the posterior and anterior gonadal poles, respectively. However, by 15.5 dpc, XY Fgfr2c-/- gonads show complete male-to-female sex reversal, evident by the lack of SOX9 and ectopic expression of FOXL2 throughout the gonads. Furthermore, ablation of the Foxl2 gene leads to partial or complete rescue of gonadal sex reversal in XY Fgfr2c-/- mice. Together with previous findings, our data suggest that testis determination involves FGFR2c-mediated repression of both the WNT4- and FOXL2-driven ovarian-determining pathways.
The exact genetic mechanism regulating avian gonadal sex differentiation has not been completely resolved. The most likely scenario involves a dosage mechanism, whereby the Z-linked DMRT1 gene triggers testis development. However, the possibility still exists that the female-specific W chromosome may harbor an ovarian determining factor. In this study, we provide evidence that the universal gene regulating gonadal sex differentiation in birds is Z-linked DMRT1 and not a W-linked (ovarian) factor. Three candidate W-linked ovarian determinants are HINTW, female-expressed transcript 1 (FET1), and female-associated factor (FAF). To test the association of these genes with ovarian differentiation in the chicken, we examined their expression following experimentally induced female-to-male sex reversal using the aromatase inhibitor fadrozole (FAD). Administration of FAD on day 3 of embryogenesis induced a significant loss of aromatase enzyme activity in female gonads and masculinization. However, expression levels of HINTW, FAF, and FET1 were unaltered after experimental masculinization. Furthermore, comparative analysis showed that FAF and FET1 expression could not be detected in zebra finch gonads. Additionally, an antibody raised against the predicted HINTW protein failed to detect it endogenously. These data do not support a universal role for these genes or for the W sex chromosome in ovarian development in birds. We found that DMRT1 (but not the recently identified Z-linked HEMGN gene) is male upregulated in embryonic zebra finch and emu gonads, as in the chicken. As chicken, zebra finch, and emu exemplify the major evolutionary clades of birds, we propose that Z-linked DMRT1, and not the W sex chromosome, regulates gonadal sex differentiation in birds.
Sertoli and granulosa cells are two major types of somatic cells in male and female gonads, respectively. Previous studies have shown that Sertoli and granulosa cells are derived from common progenitor cells and that differentiation of these two cell types is regulated by sex differentiation genes. The signaling pathway including the adhesion and transcription factor Ctnnb1 (cadherin-associated protein, β1, also known as β-catenin) regulates differentiation of granulosa cells in the absence of the transcription factor Sry, and overactivation of β-catenin in the presence of Sry leads to granulosa prior to sex determination. Surprisingly, our previous study found that β-catenin overactivation in Sertoli cells after sex determination can also cause disruption of the testicular cord and aberrant testis development. However, the underlying molecular mechanism was unclear. In this study, we found that constitutive activation of Ctnnb1 in Sertoli cells led to ectopic expression of the granulosa cell-specific marker FOXL2 in testes. Co-staining experiments revealed that FOXL2-positive cells were derived from Sertoli cells, and Sertoli cells were transformed into granulosa-like cells after Ctnnb1 overactivation. Further studies demonstrated that CTNNB1 induced Foxl2 expression by directly binding to transcription factor Tcf/Lef-binding sites in the FOXL2 promoter region. We also found that direct overexpression of Foxl2 decreased the expression of Sertoli cell-specific genes in primary Sertoli cells. Taken together, these results demonstrate that repression of β-catenin (CTNNB1) signaling is required for lineage maintenance of Sertoli cells. Our study provides a new mechanism for Sertoli cell lineage maintenance during gonad development.
In turtles undergoing temperature sex determination (TSD), bipotential gonads express Sox9 in medullary cords at both female- (FPT) and male-producing temperatures (MPT). Subsequently, when the sex fate of medullary cords becomes dimorphic, at FPT, Sox9 is downregulated, whereas at MPT, its expression is maintained. Medullary cords in the ovary turn into ovarian lacuna, whereas in the testis they differentiate as seminiferous cords. When embryos of Lepidochelys olivacea sea turtle are incubated at MPT and treated with estradiol, Sox9 expression persists in the medullary cords in the form of tiny ovotestis-like formations. The perturbed development of the treated gonads is due to a significant decrease in the number of proliferating cells. This suggests that the disturbed effect caused by exogenous estradiol may be due to a conflict between the gene networks regulated by temperature and the increased level of endogenous estrogens, induced by the treatment. Here, we decided to use fadrozole and fulvestrant, an aromatase inhibitor and an estrogen-receptor antagonist, respectively, to provide insights into the role played by endogenous estrogens in regulating the cell proliferation of the two main gonadal compartments: the medullary cords and the cortex. Comparing cell proliferation patterns, our current results suggest that the endogenous estrogens are involved in determining the sex fate of medullary cords, by repressing proliferation. Interestingly, our results showed that endogenous estradiol levels are unnecessary for the thickening of the ovarian cortex.
In most mammals, the sex of an individual is genetically determined by the Y chromosome-specific SRY gene. The presence of at least one functional copy of this gene determines the development of the primordial gonads into testes. However, testicular tissue does develop in the absence of SRY, albeit rarely, which is the case in testicular XX (SRY-negative) disorder of sex development (DSD). This condition is very important for studying the process of sexual determination because it allows the identification of genetic factors that are able to promote the male developmental pathway in the absence of SRY and thereby enables a better understanding of this process. Until now, this condition has been identified in various animal species but has never been reported in cat. In this study, we describe the first case of an XX (SRY-negative) DSD cat. The cat possesses a tortoiseshell coat associated with male-like external genitalia, including normal scrotum with 2 palpably normal testicles. Histological analysis confirmed the presence of the testes, and cytogenetic and genetic analyses showed a female karyotype associated with the absence of the SRY gene. Finally, sequencing of the RSPO1 gene revealed no mutation, and FISH analysis of the SOX9 locus did not reveal any large abnormalities.
Failure to attain peak lung function by early adulthood is a risk factor for chronic lung diseases. Previously, we reported that C3H/HeJ mice have about twice total lung capacity (TLC) compared to JF1/MsJ mice. We identified seven lung function quantitative trait loci (QTL: Lfnq1-Lfnq7) in backcross/intercross mice derived from these inbred strains. We further demonstrated, superoxide dismutase 3, extracellular (Sod3), Kit oncogene (Kit) and secreted phosphoprotein 1 (Spp1) located on these Lfnqs as lung function determinants. Emanating from the concept of early origin of lung disease, we sought to identify novel candidate genes for pulmonary function by investigating lung transcriptome in C3H/HeJ and JF1/MsJ mice at the completion of embryonic development, bulk alveolar formation and maturity.
Design-based stereological analysis was performed to study lung structure in C3H/HeJ and JF1/MsJ mice. Microarray was used for lung transcriptomic analysis [embryonic day 18, postnatal days 28, 70]. Quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), western blot and immunohistochemical analysis were used to confirm selected differences.
Stereological analysis revealed decreased alveolar number density, elastin to collagen ratio and increased mean alveolar volume in C3H/HeJ mice compared to JF1/MsJ. Gene ontology term "extracellular region" was enriched among the decreased JF1/MsJ transcripts. Candidate genes identified using the expression-QTL strategy include: ATP-binding cassette, sub-family G (WHITE), member 1 (Abcg1), formyl peptide receptor 1 (Fpr1), gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) B receptor, 1 (Gabbr1); histocompatibility 2 genes: class II antigen E beta (H2-Eb1), D region locus 1 (H2-D1), and Q region locus 4 (H2-Q4); leucine rich repeat containing 6 (testis) (Lrrc6), radial spoke head 1 homolog (Rsph1), and surfactant associated 2 (Sfta2). Noteworthy genes selected as candidates for their consistent expression include: Wnt inhibitor factor 1 (Wif1), follistatin (Fst), chitinase-like 1 (Chil1), and Chil3.
Comparison of late embryonic, adolescent and adult lung transcript profiles between mouse strains with extreme TLCs lead to the identification of candidate genes for pulmonary function that has not been reported earlier. Further mechanistic investigations are warranted to elucidate their mode of action in determining lung function.
Complete gonadal dysgenesis (CGD) is characterized by an incomplete differentiation of the genital organs in a patient with a 46,XY karyotype. It is induced by mutations in the sex-determining region Y (SRY) gene which plays a key role in testis-determining pathways. The aim of this study was to investigate the possible pathogenic nature of a novel SRY mutation (p.Y127H) identified in a 46,XY female patient. To determine the effect of this mutation on SRY function, we studied its impact on DNA interaction by electrophoretic mobility shift assays. Since tyrosine 127 is close to the C-terminal nuclear localization signal of SRY, we conducted HA-SRY protein expression to observe the impact of the mutation on the nuclear import function in transfected cells. Our results showed that the Y127H mutation nearly abolishes the DNA-binding capacity of SRY and strongly impairs the nuclear localization of the mutated protein. Together with a previously described mutation analyzed in parallel in this paper (p.Y127C), our results highlight this tyrosine residue as a crucial structural determinant of the high mobility group box domain. This is the first report to explain the molecular mechanism of the Y127H mutation causing sex reversal and gives new insights for clinical practice to benefit patients with disorders of sex development.
Identification of Spoon as a suppressor of SCA8 associated neurodegeneration provides us a hint about its role in neuronal development and maintenance. However, a detailed molecular characterization of spoon has not yet been reported. Here, we describe spatial expression pattern of Spoon during Drosophila development. Quantitative real time-PCR and fluorescent RNA-RNA in situ hybridization indicate that Spoon is expressed at relatively high levels in larval brain and photoreceptors of eye-antennal discs. Immunostaining reveals that Spoon is subcellularly localized in the cytoplasm and is also membrane bound. Strong expression is also seen in adult ovary and testes. Spoon on immunostaining exhibits unique pattern of expression in larval brain. We observed that Spoon in the neuroblasts colocalizes with Prospero, a transcription factor regulating genes involved in neuroblast self-renewal or cell-cycle control. Co-immunoprecipitation suggests that Spoon and Prospero reside in the same protein complex. Using Drosophila model of SCA8 RNA neuropathy we have also shown that loss of Prospero hinders the suppression of SCA8 associated neurodegeneration by Spoonbill, suggesting Prospero and Spoon might genetically interact and function together. Our study presents Spoon as a novel interacting partner of Prospero and this might be critical in determining the polarized localization of cell fate determinants.
In Nile tilapia sex determination is governed by a male heterogametic system XX/XY either on LG1 or LG23. The latter carries a Y-specific duplicate of the amh gene, which is a testis-determining factor. Allelic variants in the amh gene demonstrated to be major triggers for autosomal and temperature-dependent sex reversal. Further, QTL on LG23 and LG20 show a temperature-responsiveness with influence on the phenotypic sex relative to the sex chromosomes. Here we present a ddRADseq based approach to identify genomic regions that show unusual large differentiation in terms of fixation index (FST) between temperature-treated pseudomales and non-masculinized females using a comparative genome-scan. Genome-wide associations were identified for the temperature-dependent sex using a genetically all-female population devoid of amh-ΔY.
Twenty-two thousand three hundred ninety-two SNPs were interrogated for the comparison of temperature-treated pseudomales and females, which revealed the largest differentiation on LG23. Outlier FST-values (0.35-0.44) were determined for six SNPs in the genomic interval (9,190,077-11,065,693) harbouring the amh gene (9,602,693-9,605,808), exceeding the genome-wide low FST of 0.013. Association analysis with a set of 9104 selected SNPs confirmed that the same genomic region on LG23 exerts a significant effect on the temperature-dependent sex.
This study highlights the role of LG23 in sex determination, harbouring major determinants for temperature-dependent sex reversal in Nile tilapia. Furthermore FST outlier detection proves a powerful tool for detection of sex-determining regions in fish genomes.
Sexual dimorphisms are prevalent in development, physiology and diseases in humans. Currently, the contributions of the genes on the male-specific region of the Y chromosome (MSY) in these processes are uncertain. Using a transgene activation system, the human sex-determining gene hSRY is activated in the single-cell embryos of the mouse. Pups with hSRY activated (hSRYON) are born of similar sizes as those of non-activated controls. However, they retard significantly in postnatal growth and development and all die of multi-organ failure before two weeks of age. Pathological and molecular analyses indicate that hSRYON pups lack innate suckling activities, and develop fatty liver disease, arrested alveologenesis in the lung, impaired neurogenesis in the brain and occasional myocardial fibrosis and minimized thymus development. Transcriptome analysis shows that, in addition to those unique to the respective organs, various cell growth and survival pathways and functions are differentially affected in the transgenic mice. These observations suggest that ectopic activation of a Y-located SRY gene could exert male-specific effects in development and physiology of multiple organs, thereby contributing to sexual dimorphisms in normal biological functions and disease processes in affected individuals.
It has previously been demonstrated that bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) exhibit great therapeutic potential in neuronal injuries; however, there is limited understanding of the precise underlying mechanisms that contribute to functional improvement following brain injury. The aim of the present study was to assess the effect of BMSC treatment on traumatic brain injury (TBI) in rats, and investigate if they migrate to injured areas and promote neuromotor functional recovery via upregulation of neurotrophic factors and synaptic proteins. BMSCs were cultured in vitro from female Sprague Dawley (SD) rat bone marrow and were subsequently infused into male adult SD rats via the tail vein, following induction of TBI. The results demonstrated that treatment with BMSCs significantly reduced TBI‑induced neuromotor impairment and neuronal loss, as assessed by rota rod testing, western blot analysis, modified neurological severity score and immunohistochemistry. The distribution of transplanted BMSCs was tracked by monitoring the expression of sex determining region Y (SRY) in rats. The number of cells double‑positive for SRY/neuronal nuclear antigen or SRY/glial fibrillary acidic protein was increased in the BMSC group, which demonstrated that BMSCs migrated to injured areas and differentiated into neurons and astrocytes, following TBI. Furthermore, administration of BMSCs increased expression of vascular endothelial growth factor and brain derived neurotrophic factor. Protein expression levels of synaptophysin were downregulated following TBI and this was reversed in part by treatment with BMSCs. These findings uncovered some underlying mechanisms of action of BMSCs, and may lead to their potential use as a future effective therapeutic agent for the treatment of TBI.
Previous studies, which were primarily based on the fluorescent in-situ hybridisation (FISH) technique, revealed conflicting evidence regarding male foetal microchimerism in endometriosis. FISH is a relatively less sensitive technique, as it is performed on a small portion of the sample. Additionally, the probes used in the previous studies specifically detected centromeric and telomeric regions of Y chromosome, which are gene-sparse heterochromatised regions. In the present study, a panel of molecular biology tools such as qPCR, expression microarray, RNA-seq and qRT-PCR were employed to examine the Y chromosome microchimerism in the endometrium using secretory phase samples from fertile and infertile patients with severe (stage IV) ovarian endometriosis (OE) and without endometriosis.
Microarray expression analysis followed by validation using RNA-seq and qRT-PCR experiments at the RNA levels and further validation at the DNA level by qPCR of target inserts for selected targets in eutopic endometrium samples obtained from control (CON) and stage IV ovarian endometriosis (OE), either from fertile (FCON and FOE; n = 30/each) or infertile (ICON and IOE; n = 30/each) women, were performed.
Six coding (AMELY, PCDH11, SRY, TGIF2LY, TSPY3, and USP9Y) and 10 non-coding (TTTY2, TTTY4C, TTTY5, TTTYY6, TTTY8, TTTY10, TTTY14, TTTY21, TTTY22, and TTTY23) genes exhibited a bimodal pattern of expression characterised by low expression in samples from fertile patients and high expression in samples from infertile patients. Seven coding MSY-linked genes (BAGE, CD24, EIF1AY, NLGN4Y, PRKY, VCY and ZFY) exhibited differential regulation in microarray analysis, and this change was validated by RNA-seq or qRT-PCR. DNA inserts for 7 genes in various samples were validated by qPCR. The prevalence and concentration of PCR-positive target inserts for BAGE, PRKY, TTTY9A and ZFY displayed higher values in the fertile, control (FCON) patients compared with the fertile, endometriosis patients (FOE).
Several coding and non-coding MSY-linked genes displayed microchimerism as evidenced by the presence of their respective DNA inserts, along with their differential transcript expression, in the endometrium during endometriosis and in cases of infertility.
We studied prospectively the role of FSH, testis volume, age, duration of infertility, hormonal therapy, varicocelectomy and testicular histopathology in determining the sperm retrieval rate (SRR) in fresh versus salvage micro-TESE.
Our study analysed retrospectively the prospectively maintained database of 330 NOA patients who underwent micro-TESE either 1st or 2nd or 3rd timers from January 2017 to August 2018 from the Andrology Clinic of a specialized IVF centre. They were divided equally into 3 groups, group (1) were 1st timers, group (2) were 2nd timers and group (3) were 3rd timers, respectively.
Interestingly, our study demonstrated a positive correlation between high FSH level and favourable micro-TESE outcome in 1st timers who underwent micro-TESE (p 0.015). Additionally, our study revealed a positive correlation between age and favourable micro-TESE outcome in 2nd timers who underwent micro-TESE (p 0.031). Further, our study revealed a positive correlation between right testicular volume and favourable micro-TESE outcome in 1st timers who underwent micro-TESE (p 0.023). Eventually, there was a significant positive correlation between histopathology which was mainly sertoli cell only syndrome and favourable micro-TESE outcome in 1st timers micro-TESE (p 0.001).
Our study demonstrates that sperms can be retrieved despite high FSH level, and preoperative histopathology is not essential in predicting SRR in NOA patients. Further, age can be considered a good prognostic factor in patients who undergo salvage micro-TESE for the 2nd time.
FOXD1, one of the transcription factors of the FOX family, has been shown to be important for mammalian reproduction but little is known about its function in avian species. In the present study, we identified the expression pattern and location of FOXD1 in chicken tissues and testis by performing quantitative polymerase chain reaction, immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence, and further investigated the regulatory relationship of FOXD1 with genes involved in testis development by RNA interference. Our results showed that FOXD1 is confirmed to be significantly male-biased expressed in the brain, kidney and testis of adults as well as in embryonic gonads, and it is localised in the testicular Sertoli cell in chicken, consistent with its localisation in mammals. After knock-down of FOXD1 in chicken Sertoli cells, the expression of anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH), sex-determining region Y-box 9 (SOX9) and PKA regulatory subunits type I α (RIα) was significantly downregulated, expression of androgen receptor (AR) was notably increased whereas double-sex and MAB-3-related transcription factor 1 (DMRT1) showed no obvious change in expression. These results suggest that FOXD1 is an essential marker for Sertoli cells upstream of SOX9 expression and a potential regulator of embryonic testis differentiation and development and of normal testis function in the chicken.
DEAD-box helicase 4 (DDX4; also known as vasa) is essential for the proper formation and maintenance of germ cells. Although DDX4 is conserved in a variety of vertebrates and invertebrates, its roles differ between species. This study investigated the function of DDX4 in chicken embryos by knocking down its expression using retroviral vectors that encoded DDX4-targeting microRNAs. DDX4 was effectively depleted invitro and invivo via this approach. Male and female gonads of DDX4-knockdown embryos contained a decreased number of primordial germ cells, indicating that DDX4 is essential to maintain a normal level of these cells in chicken embryos of both sexes. Expression of doublesex and mab-3 related transcription factor 1 (DMRT1) and sex determining region Y-box 9 (SOX9), which are involved in testis determination and differentiation, was normal in male gonads of DDX4-knockdown embryos. In contrast, expression of cytochrome P450 family 19 subfamily A member 1 (CYP19A1), which encodes aromatase and is essential for ovary development, was significantly decreased in female gonads of DDX4-knockdown embryos. Expression of forkhead box L2 (FOXL2), which plays an important role in ovary differentiation, was also slightly reduced in DDX4-knockdown embryos, but not significantly. Based on several pieces of evidence FOXL2 was hypothesised to regulate aromatase expression. The results of this study indicate that aromatase expression is also regulated by several additional pathways.
Disorders of sex development (DSDs) are conditions affecting development of the gonads or genitalia. Variants in two key genes, SRY and its target SOX9, are an established cause of 46,XY DSD, but the genetic basis of many DSDs remains unknown. SRY-mediated SOX9 upregulation in the early gonad is crucial for testis development, yet the regulatory elements underlying this have not been identified in humans. Here, we identified four DSD patients with overlapping duplications or deletions upstream of SOX9. Bioinformatic analysis identified three putative enhancers for SOX9 that responded to different combinations of testis-specific regulators. All three enhancers showed synergistic activity and together drive SOX9 in the testis. This is the first study to identify SOX9 enhancers that, when duplicated or deleted, result in 46,XX or 46,XY sex reversal, respectively. These enhancers provide a hitherto missing link by which SRY activates SOX9 in humans, and establish SOX9 enhancer mutations as a significant cause of DSD.
This study aimed to identify the cause of azoospermia in a 38-year-old infertile man who was referred for genetic testing. Cytogenetic evaluation was performed by G-banding, C-banding, and FISH using centromeric probes for chromosomes X and Y and showed the presence of a monocentric isochromosome Y with a complex, mosaic karyotype 45,X/46,X,i(Y)(q10)/46,XX/47,XX,i(Y)(q10). Multiplex PCR for the commonly deleted genes in the AZFa, AZFb, and AZFc regions of the Y chromosome was performed and indicated the presence of all 3 regions. Further, PCR amplification followed by DNA sequencing of the SRY gene was done, which ruled out mutations in that gene. To identify the position of the SRY gene, FISH using a locus-specific probe was used and showed that the gene had been translocated to chromosome 3. Subtelomere FISH for 3q and Yp evidenced that the subtelomeric region of the Y chromosome was found on the terminal region of 3q. The clinical symptoms of the patient can be attributed to this abnormal genotype. The importance of genetic testing in infertile patients and the need for genetic counselling to prevent the transmission of the defect are emphasized.
Evolutionary novelties require rewiring of transcriptional networks and/or the evolution of new gene functions. Sex determination (SD), one of the most plastic evolutionary processes, requires such novelties. Studies on the evolution of vertebrate SD revealed that new master SD genes are generally recruited from genes involved in the downstream SD regulatory genetic network. Only a single exception to this rule is currently known in vertebrates: the intriguing case of the salmonid master SD gene (sdY), which arose from duplication of an immune-related gene. This exception immediately posed the question of how a gene outside from the classical sex differentiation cascade could acquire its function as a male SD gene. Here we show that SdY became integrated in the classical vertebrate sex differentiation cascade by interacting with the Forkhead box domain of the female-determining transcription factor, Foxl2. In the presence of Foxl2, SdY is translocated to the nucleus where the SdY:Foxl2 complex prevents activation of the aromatase (cyp19a1a) promoter in cooperation with Nr5a1 (Sf1). Hence, by blocking a positive loop of regulation needed for the synthesis of estrogens in the early differentiating gonad, SdY disrupts a preset female differentiation pathway, consequently allowing testicular differentiation to proceed. These results also suggest that the evolution of unusual vertebrate master sex determination genes recruited from outside the classical pathway like sdY is strongly constrained by their ability to interact with the canonical gonadal differentiation pathway.
CATSPER1 gene encodes a pore-forming and pH-sensing subunit of the CatSper Ca2+- permeable channel, a protein in the flagellum essential for sperm hyperactivation. Previous studies have shown that the murine Catsper1 gene promoter is regulated by different Sox proteins. Likewise, it is acknowledged that the human CATSPER1 gene promoter sequence is enriched in potential interaction sites for the sex-determining region Y gene (SRY), which suggest a novel regulatory transcriptional mechanism for CatSper1 channel expression. Therefore, in this work, we sought to determine whether the human CATSPER1 gene expression is regulated by the SRY transcription factor. To this end, a series of deletions and mutations were introduced in the wild- type CATSPER1 gene promoter to eliminate the SRY sites, and the different constructs were tested for their ability to activate transcription in human embryonic kidney and murine spermatogonial germ cell lines (HEK-293 and GC1-spg, respectively) using luciferase assays. In addition, by using a strategy that combines electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) we investigated whether the CATSPER1 gene expression is regulated by the SRY transcription factor both in vitro and in vivo. Our results show that the transcriptional factor SRY specifically binds to different sites in the promoter sequence and has the ability to control CATSPER1 gene transcription.
When females mate with multiple partners in a reproductive cycle, the relative number of competing sperm from rival males is often the most critical factor in determining paternity. Gamete production is directly related to testis size in most species, and is associated with both mating behavior and perceived risk of competition. Deer mice, Peromyscus maniculatus, are naturally promiscuous and males invest significantly more in sperm production than males of P. polionotus, their monogamous sister-species. Here, we show that the larger testes in P. maniculatus are retained after decades of enforced monogamy in captivity. While these results suggest that differences in sperm production between species with divergent evolutionary histories can be maintained in captivity, we also show that the early rearing environment of males can strongly influence their testis size as adults. Using a second-generation hybrid population to increase variation within the population, we show that males reared in litters with more brothers develop larger testes as adults. Importantly, this difference in testis size is also associated with increased fertility. Together, our findings suggest that sperm production may be both broadly shaped by natural selection over evolutionary timescales and also finely tuned during early development.
The identity of the gonads is determined by which fate, ovarian granulosa cell or testicular Sertoli cell, the bipotential somatic cell precursors choose to follow. In most vertebrates, the conserved transcription factor FOXL2 contributes to the fate of granulosa cells. To understand FOXL2 functions during gonad differentiation, we performed genome-wide analysis of FOXL2 chromatin occupancy in fetal ovaries and established a genetic mouse model that forces Foxl2 expression in the fetal testis. When FOXL2 was ectopically expressed in the somatic cell precursors in the fetal testis, FOXL2 was sufficient to repress Sertoli cell differentiation, ultimately resulting in partial testis-to-ovary sex-reversal. Combining genome-wide analysis of FOXL2 binding in the fetal ovary with transcriptomic analyses of our Foxl2 gain-of-function and previously published Foxl2 loss-of-function models, we identified potential pathways responsible for the feminizing action of FOXL2. Finally, comparison of FOXL2 genome-wide occupancy in the fetal ovary with testis-determining factor SOX9 genome-wide occupancy in the fetal testis revealed extensive overlaps, implying that antagonistic signals between FOXL2 and SOX9 occur at the chromatin level.
To identify the etiology of chromosome abnormality in an infertile man and analyze the correlation between the genotype and phenotype.
We analyzed the karyotype of an infertile male using the routine G-banding technique and then the chromosome abnormality of the patient by Illumina Human CytoSNP-12 Beadchip array.
Negative results were found in the examination of the sex-determining region Y (SRY) gene and the STR locus in the AZF zone of the patient. The karyotype of the patient was 46, XX. SNP array showed a 1.05 Mb 19p12 duplication and a 0.93 Mb Xq27.1 duplication.
The patient was confirmed as a case of 46,XX male syndrome. The increased copies of the FGF13 gene may be the major causes of abnormal sex determination and testis development.
目的： 利用常规G显带技术和单核苷酸多态性微阵列分析（SNP array）联合的方法分析1例不育患者染色体异常，帮助患者查明病因，明确基因型和表现型的相关性。方法： 首先采用常规G显带技术分析患者核型，再应用SNP array分析患者染色体的微小异常。结果： 通过AZF区域STR位点检测和SRY基因检测发现患者都为阴性；常规G显带技术分析发现表现型为男性患者染色体核型为46,XX；SNP array结果显示患者19p12存在1.05 Mb的重复，Xq27.1存在0.93 Mb的重复。结论： 通过多技术联合的方法证明患者为46,XX男性综合征，FGF13的拷贝数增加很可能是导致患者性别决定和睾丸发育异常的重要原因。.
Nuclear receptor subfamily 5 group A member 1/Steroidogenic factor 1 (NR5A1; SF-1; Ad4BP) mutations cause 46,XY disorders of sex development (DSD), with phenotypes ranging from developmentally mild (e.g., hypospadias) to severe (e.g., complete gonadal dysgenesis). The molecular mechanism underlying this spectrum is unclear. During sex determination, SF-1 regulates SOX9 (SRY [sex determining region Y]-box 9) expression. We hypothesized that SF-1 mutations in 46,XY DSD patients affect SOX9 expression via the Testis-specific Enhancer of Sox9 core element, TESCO. Our objective was to assess the ability of 20 SF-1 mutants found in 46,XY DSD patients to activate TESCO. Patient DNA was sequenced for SF-1 mutations and mutant SF-1 proteins were examined for transcriptional activity, protein expression, sub-cellular localization and in silico structural defects. Fifteen of the 20 mutants showed reduced SF-1 activation on TESCO, 11 with atypical sub-cellular localization. Fourteen SF-1 mutants were predicted in silico to alter DNA, ligand or cofactor interactions. Our study may implicate aberrant SF-1-mediated transcriptional regulation of SOX9 in 46,XY DSDs.
This study was conducted to clarify the relationships of plasma concentrations of insulin-like peptide 3 (INSL3), testosterone, inhibin, and insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) with scrotal circumference and testicular weight in Japanese Black beef bull calves (n = 20), from birth to pre-puberty. Monthly blood sampling (0 to 7 months) and scrotal circumference measurements (0 to 7 months) were performed. Testicular weight was recorded immediately after castration at 7 months. Plasma INSL3, testosterone, inhibin, and IGF-I concentrations were measured either by enzyme immunoassay or time-resolved fluorescence immunoassay. The correlation coefficients of these hormonal concentrations with scrotal circumference were significant (P &lt; 0.0001) and it was higher for INSL3 (r = 0.647) than for testosterone (r = 0.597), IGF-I (r = 0.400), and inhibin (r = -0.453). Calves with heavier testes (&gt; 60 g) at castration (7 months) had higher (P &lt; 0.05) plasma INSL3 (from 3 to 7 months) and inhibin (from 1 to 4 months) concentrations than those with lighter testes (&lt; 60 g). The calves with heavier testes at castration had larger (P &lt; 0.05) scrotal circumference than those with lighter testes from 3 to 7 months. In conclusion, blood INSL3 concentrations may be the best functional indicator among the hormones analyzed for determining total testicular volume during pre-puberty in bull calves. In addition, inhibin and INSL3 concentrations in early calfhood may be functional predictors for testicular weight at pre-puberty.
Although endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs, including pesticides) are thought to increase the risk of hypospadias, no compounds have been formally identified in this context. Human studies may now be possible via the assessment of meconium as a marker of chronic prenatal exposure. The objective of the present study was to determine whether or not prenatal exposure to pesticides (as detected in meconium) constitutes a risk factor for isolated hypospadias. In a case-control study performed between 2011 and 2014 in northern France, male newborns with isolated hypospadias (n = 25) were matched at birth with controls (n = 58). Newborns with obvious genetic or hormonal anomalies, undescended testis, micropenis, a congenital syndrome or a family history of hypospadias were not included. Neonatal and parental data were collected. Foetal exposure was assessed by determining the meconium concentrations of the pesticides or metabolites (organophosphates, carbamates, phenylurea, and phenoxyherbicides) most commonly used in the region. Risk factors were assessed in a multivariate analysis. The pesticides most commonly detected in meconium were organophosphates (in up to 98.6% of samples, depending on the substance) and phenylurea (&gt;85.5%). A multivariate analysis revealed an association between isolated hypospadias and the presence in meconium of the phenylurea herbicide isoproturon and of the phenoxyherbicide 2-methyl-4-chlorophenoxyacetic acid (odds ratio [95% confidence interval]: 5.94 [1.03-34.11] and 4.75 [1.20-18.76]) respectively). We conclude that prenatal exposure to these two herbicides (as assessed by meconium analysis) was correlated with the occurrence of isolated hypospadias. The results of our case-control study (i) suggest that prenatal exposure to pesticides interferes with the development of the male genitalia, and (ii) emphasize the importance of preventing pregnant women from being exposed to EDCs in general and pesticides in particular.
Cell fate decisions require appropriate regulation of key genes. Sox9, a direct target of SRY, is pivotal in mammalian sex determination. In vivo high-throughput chromatin accessibility techniques, transgenic assays, and genome editing revealed several novel gonadal regulatory elements in the 2-megabase gene desert upstream of Sox9 Although others are redundant, enhancer 13 (Enh13), a 557-base pair element located 565 kilobases 5' from the transcriptional start site, is essential to initiate mouse testis development; its deletion results in XY females with Sox9 transcript levels equivalent to those in XX gonads. Our data are consistent with the time-sensitive activity of SRY and indicate a strict order of enhancer usage. Enh13 is conserved and embedded within a 32.5-kilobase region whose deletion in humans is associated with XY sex reversal, suggesting that it is also critical in humans.
In mammals, the sex of the embryo depends on the SRY gene. In the presence of at least one intact and functional copy of this genetic factor (XY embryo) undifferentiated gonads will develop as testicles that subsequently determine the male phenotype. When this factor is not present, i.e., in subjects with 2 X chromosomes, an alternative pathway induces the development of ovaries, hence a female phenotype. In this case study, we describe a female cattle affected by a disorder of sex development (DSD). The subject, despite having a chromosomal XY constitution, did not develop testicles but ovaries, although they were underdeveloped. Moreover, genetic analysis highlighted the presence of the SRY gene with a normal coding region in both blood- and tissue-derived DNA. A chimeric condition was excluded in blood by sexing more than 350 cells and by allele profile investigation of 18 microsatellite markers. Array CGH analysis showed the presence of a not yet described 99-kb duplication (BTA18), but its relationship with the phenotype remains to be demonstrated. Gonadal histology demonstrated paired ovaries: the left one containing a large corpus luteum and the right one showing an underdeveloped aspect and very few early follicles. To our knowledge, we describe the first case of XY (SRY+) DSD in cattle with a normal SRY gene coding sequence.
This study explores determining the sex of humans from blood stains taken from different surfaces and compares the time course of detection with the conventional PCR, Conventional Loop Mediated Isothermal Amplification (LAMP), and LAMP-Lateral Flow Dipstick (LFD). For the DNA templates, 7 male and 7 female blood stained samples were extracted and added to LAMP and PCR reaction solution to amplify the SRY gene. The DNA samples were extracted from the following blood stained materials: cloth, wood, clay, and tile. Then, the samples were stored at room temperature for 1, 7, 30, and 60 day(s). After the DNA amplification, the gel electrophoresis process was applied to detect LAMP product. The LFD was combined with the LAMP to detect LAMP product on the male cloth samples. For the male samples, the time course of detection on the first and seventh days indicated positive for both LAMP and PCR products on all the surfaces while no DNA amplification was found on any of the female samples. On day 30, positive LAMP product was still found on all the male samples. However, it had faded on the tiles. Moreover, all the male samples, which had tested positive for PCR product, were blurred and unclear. On day 60, LAMP product was still found on all the male samples. Conversely, the PCR method resulted in no bands showing for any of the male samples. However, the LAMP-LFD method detected product on all the male samples of cloth. The results show that the LAMP is an effective, practical, and reliable molecular-biological method. Moreover, the LFD can increase the efficiency and sensitivity of the LAMP, making it more suitable for field studies because gel electrophoresis apparatus is not required.
Mammalian sex determination is controlled by the antagonistic interactions of two genetic pathways: The SRY-SOX9-FGF9 network promotes testis determination partly by opposing proovarian pathways, while RSPO1/WNT-β-catenin/FOXL2 signals control ovary development by inhibiting SRY-SOX9-FGF9. The molecular basis of this mutual antagonism is unclear. Here we show that ZNRF3, a WNT signaling antagonist and direct target of RSPO1-mediated inhibition, is required for sex determination in mice. XY mice lacking ZNRF3 exhibit complete or partial gonadal sex reversal, or related defects. These abnormalities are associated with ectopic WNT/β-catenin activity and reduced Sox9 expression during fetal sex determination. Using exome sequencing of individuals with 46,XY disorders of sex development, we identified three human ZNRF3 variants in very rare cases of XY female presentation. We tested two missense variants and show that these disrupt ZNRF3 activity in both human cell lines and zebrafish embryo assays. Our data identify a testis-determining function for ZNRF3 and indicate a mechanism of direct molecular interaction between two mutually antagonistic organogenetic pathways.
Mammalian zygote-mediated genome editing via the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/CRISPR-associated endonuclease 9 (CRISPR/Cas9) system is widely used to generate genome-modified animals. This system allows for the production of loss-of-function mutations in various Y chromosome genes, including Sry, in mice. Here, we report the establishment of a CRISPR-Cas9-mediated knock-in line of Flag-tag sequences into the Sry locus at the C-terminal coding end of the Y chromosome (YSry-flag). In the F1 and successive generations, all male pups carrying the YSry-flag chromosome had normal testis differentiation and proper spermatogenesis at maturity, enabling complete fertility and the production of viable offspring. To our knowledge, this study is the first to produce a stable Sry knock-in line at the C-terminal region, highlighting a novel approach for examining the significance of amino acid changes at the naive Sry locus in mammals.
The Sox9 gene is important for determining sex in vertebrates, as well as for maintaining testis morphology and fertility during adult life. In the same way, Vasa is an important gene for the maintenance of the germinal lineage and has been highly conserved throughout evolution, as it is expressed in germ cells of both vertebrates and invertebrates. In the particular case of crocodiles, the expression of Sox9 during gonadal morphogenesis and in the testes of 3-month-old Alligator mississippiensis has been studied. However, it is interesting to carry out studies on other species of crocodiles in relation to their particular mechanism for sex determination influenced by temperature. In this work, we investigated the expression of the Sox9, Vasa, Foxl2, and TRPV4 genes in the ovaries and testes of 5-year-old juvenile crocodiles from Crocodylus moreletii. As expected, Sox9 expression was found in males, but surprisingly, it was also found in females. For the first time, the expression of Vasa was reported in spermatogonia, oogonia, and oocytes of 5-year-old crocodiles. Foxl2 is important for the development and maintenance of the ovary during adult life in vertebrates; moreover, Foxl2 protein and transcripts are both highly expressed in the ovaries compared to the testes. A possible upstream regulator of the Sox9 gene in reptiles has not yet been discovered; as such, the expression of the TRPV4 ion channel was evaluated. The TRPV4 ion channel was expressed in the cytoplasm of Sertoli and follicular cells and was therefore proposed as a possible regulator of SOX9.
Emerging evidence from murine studies suggests that mammalian sex determination is the outcome of an imbalance between mutually antagonistic male and female regulatory networks that canalize development down one pathway while actively repressing the other. However, in contrast to testis formation, the gene regulatory pathways governing mammalian ovary development have remained elusive. We performed exome or Sanger sequencing on 79 46,XX SRY-negative individuals with either unexplained virilization or with testicular/ovotesticular disorders/differences of sex development (TDSD/OTDSD). We identified heterozygous frameshift mutations in NR2F2, encoding COUP-TF2, in three children. One carried a c.103_109delGGCGCCC (p.Gly35Argfs∗75) mutation, while two others carried a c.97_103delCCGCCCG (p.Pro33Alafs∗77) mutation. In two of three children the mutation was de novo. All three children presented with congenital heart disease (CHD), one child with congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH), and two children with blepharophimosis-ptosis-epicanthus inversus syndrome (BPES). The three children had androgen production, virilization of external genitalia, and biochemical or histological evidence of testicular tissue. We demonstrate a highly significant association between the NR2F2 loss-of-function mutations and this syndromic form of DSD (p = 2.44 × 10-8). We show that COUP-TF2 is highly abundant in a FOXL2-negative stromal cell population of the fetal human ovary. In contrast to the mouse, these data establish COUP-TF2 as a human "pro-ovary" and "anti-testis" sex-determining factor in female gonads. Furthermore, the data presented here provide additional evidence of the emerging importance of nuclear receptors in establishing human ovarian identity and indicate that nuclear receptors may have divergent functions in mouse and human biology.
The human Y chromosome harbors genes that are responsible for testis development and also for initiation and maintenance of spermatogenesis in adulthood. The long arm of the Y chromosome (Yq) contains many ampliconic and palindromic sequences making it predisposed to self-recombination during spermatogenesis and hence susceptible to intra-chromosomal deletions. Such deletions lead to copy number variation in genes of the Y chromosome resulting in male infertility. Three common Yq deletions that recur in infertile males are termed as AZF (Azoospermia Factor) microdeletions viz. AZFa, AZFb and AZFc. As estimated from data of nearly 40,000 Y chromosomes, the global prevalence of Yq microdeletions is 7.5% in infertile males; however the European infertile men are less susceptible to Yq microdeletions, the highest prevalence is in Americans and East Asian infertile men. In addition, partial deletions of the AZFc locus have been associated with infertility but the effect seems to be ethnicity dependent. Analysis of &gt; 17,000 Y chromosomes from fertile and infertile men has revealed an association of gr/gr deletion with male infertility in Caucasians and Mongolian men, while the b2/b3 deletion is associated with male infertility in African and Dravidian men. Clinically, the screening for Yq microdeletions would aid the clinician in determining the cause of male infertility and decide a rational management strategy for the patient. As these deletions are transmitted to 100% of male offspring born through assisted reproduction, testing of Yq deletions will allow the couples to make an informed choice regarding the perpetuation of male infertility in future generations. With the emerging data on association of Yq deletions with testicular cancers and neuropsychiatric conditions long term follow-up data is urgently needed for infertile men harboring Yq deletions. If found so, the information will change the current the perspective of androgenetics from infertility and might have broad implication in men health.
Hermaphroditism is a rare disorder that affects sexual development, resulting in individuals with both male and female sexual organs. Hermaphroditism is caused by anomalies in genes regulating sex determination, gonad development, or expression of hormones and their receptors during embryonic development during sexual differentiation. SRY is a sex-determination gene on the Y chromosome that is responsible for initiating male sex determination in mammals. In this study, we introduced CRISPR/Cas9-mediated mutations in the high-mobility-group (HMG) region of the rabbit SRY As expected, SRY-mutant chimeric rabbits were diagnosed with hermaphroditism, characterized by possessing ovotestis, testis, ovary and uterus simultaneously. Histopathology analysis revealed that the testicular tissue was immature and lacked spermatogenic cells, while the ovarian portion appeared normal and displayed follicles at different stages. This is the first report of a rabbit hermaphroditism model generated by the CRISPR/Cas9 system. This novel rabbit model could advance our understanding of the pathogenesis of hermaphroditism, and identify novel therapies for human clinical treatment of hermaphroditism.
Cadmium chloride (CdCl2) is a ubiquitous environmental toxicant that causes a variety of disturbances in biological systems, including brain dysfunction and testicular tissue degeneration. On the other hand, it is supposed that beneficial properties of probiotic bacteria (Lactobacillus and Acidobacillus) are related to their capacity to adhere or bind different targets, thus leading to improved intestinal microbial balance and other benefits to the host. Bearing aforementioned in mind, the present study was undertaken to investigate the protective effect of probiotic supplementation against cadmium chloride-induced brain and testis toxicity in mice model. Animals received Lactobacillus and Acidobacillus either alone or added to folic acid for 1 week before CdCl2 intoxication in a dose of 20 mg/kg BW followed by probiotics (5 × 109) and/or folic acid (12 mg/kg) treatment for 3 weeks. The levels of malondialdehyde (MDA), butyrl choline esterase (BCHE), reduced glutathione (GSH), and total superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities were investigated. Finally, cadmium neurotoxicity was determined by estimating the gene expression of β-catenin and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), as well as estimating the alterations in testicular function by determining acid phosphatase level in addition to steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR) and 17-hydroxy steroid dehydrogenase (17-β HSD) gene expression. Based on our results, we can conclude that exposure of mice to cadmium chloride resulted in a significant elevation in MDA, BCHE levels accompanied with a significant reduction in GSH and SOD activities compared to the control value. CdCl2 also downregulated the gene expression of β-catenin and BDNF, as well as acid phosphatase level, in addition to StAR and 17-β HSD gene expression. These deviated parameters were significantly modulated in the co-treated animals with probiotics compared with the cadmium-treated group. In conclusion, Lactobacillus and folic acid in a mixture with cadmium acted beneficially to an organism, increasing the cadmium excretion in feces, and consequently increasing β-catenin and BDNF in brain tissue and StAR and 17-β HSD in testis and improving their functions. Histoarchitecture analysis confirmed these results.
Sex-determining region of the Y chromosome (SRY) gene plays a crucial role in male sexual differentiation and development. Several mutations in the SRY gene have been reported in the high mobility group (HMG) box domain and can cause gonadal dysgenesis symptoms. In this study, we report that a novel missense mutation in the SRY gene, a G to A transition within the HMG box, causes the Ala66Thr amino acid substitution in a female patient presenting 46,XY karyotype with pure gonadal dysgenesis. The G to A base transition was not found in the SRY sequence after the screening of 100 normal males. Furthermore, Ala66Thr mutation drastically reduced the binding capacity of SRY to DNA sequences, whereas wild-type SRY protein showed the normal binding capacity to DNA sequences in vitro. We also found that the mutant SRY protein was partly localized in cytoplasm, whereas wild-type SRY protein was strictly localized in cell nucleus. In addition, we analyzed the three-dimensional structure of SRY protein by homology modeling methods. In conclusion, we identified a novel SRY mutation in a 46,XY female patient with pure gonadal dysgenesis, demonstrating the importance of the Ala66Thr mutation in DNA binding activity and nuclear transport.
Genome analysis of patients with disorders of sex development, and gain- and loss-of-function studies in mice indicate that gonadal development is regulated by opposing signals. In females, the Wnt/β-catenin canonical pathway blocks testicular differentiation by repressing the expression of the Sertoli cell-specific gene Sox9 by an unknown mechanism. Using cell and embryonic gonad culture models, we show that activation of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway inhibits the expression of Sox9 and Amh, whereas mRNA and protein levels of Sry and steroidogenic factor 1 (Sf1), two key transcriptional regulators of Sox9, are not altered. Ectopic activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling in male gonads led to a loss of Sf1 binding to the Tesco enhancer and absent Sox9 expression that we also observed in wild-type ovaries. Moreover, ectopic Wnt/β-catenin signaling induced the expression of the female somatic cell markers, Bmp2 and Rspo1, as a likely consequence of Sox9 loss. Wnt/β-catenin signaling in XY gonads did not, however, affect gene expression of the steroidogenic Leydig cell Sf1 target gene, Cyp11a1, or Sf1 binding to the Cyp11a1 promoter. Our data support a model in ovary development whereby activation of β-catenin prevents Sf1 binding to the Sox9 enhancer, thereby inhibiting Sox9 expression and Sertoli cell differentiation.
In mammals, Sry expression in the bipotential, undifferentiated gonad directs the support cell precursors to differentiate as Sertoli cells, thus initiating the testis differentiation pathway. In the absence of Sry, or if Sry is expressed at insufficient levels, the support cell precursors differentiate as granulosa cells, thus initiating the ovarian pathway. The molecular mechanisms upstream and downstream of Sry are not well understood. We demonstrate that the transcription factor GATA4 and its co-factor FOG2 are required for gonadal differentiation. Mouse fetuses homozygous for a null allele of Fog2 or homozygous for a targeted mutation in Gata4 (Gata4(ki)) that abrogates the interaction of GATA4 with FOG co-factors exhibit abnormalities in gonadogenesis. We found that Sry transcript levels were significantly reduced in XY Fog2(-/-) gonads at E11.5, which is the time when Sry expression normally reaches its peak. In addition, three genes crucial for normal Sertoli cell function (Sox9, Mis and Dhh) and three Leydig cell steroid biosynthetic enzymes (p450scc, 3betaHSD and p450c17) were not expressed in XY Fog2(-/-) and Gata(ki/ki) gonads, whereas Wnt4, a gene required for normal ovarian development, was expressed ectopically. By contrast, Wt1 and Sf1, which are expressed prior to Sry and necessary for gonad development in both sexes, were expressed normally in both types of mutant XY gonads. These results indicate that GATA4 and FOG2 and their physical interaction are required for normal gonadal development.
Genes previously implicated in mammalian sexual development have either a male- or female-specific role. The signaling molecule WNT4 has been shown to be important in female sexual development. Lack of Wnt4 gives rise to masculinization of the XX gonad and we showed previously that the role of WNT4 was to inhibit endothelial and steroidogenic cell migration into the developing ovary. Here we show that Wnt4 also has a function in the male gonad. We find that Sertoli cell differentiation is compromised in Wnt4 mutant testes and that this defect occurs downstream of the testis-determining gene Sry but upstream of Sox9 and Dhh, two early Sertoli cell markers. Genetic analysis shows that this phenotype is primarily due to the action of WNT4 within the early genital ridge. Analysis of different markers identifies the most striking difference in the genital ridge at early stages of its development between wild-type and Wnt4 mutant embryos to be a significant increase of steroidogenic cells in the Wnt4 -/- gonad. These results identify WNT4 as a new factor involved in the mammalian testis determination pathway and show that genes can have a specific but distinct role in both male and female gonad development.
Testicular cell proliferation and differentiation is critical for development of normal testicular function and male reproductive maturity. The objective of the current study was to evaluate histoarchitecture and expression of genes marking specific cells and important functions as well as testosterone production of the developing goat testes. Testes were harvested from Alpine bucks at 0, 2, 4, 6, and 8 mo of age (n = 5/age group). Paired testes weight increased from 2 to 4 (P &lt; 0.001) and 4 to 6 mo (P &lt; 0.01). The greatest increases in seminiferous tubule and lumen diameters and height of the seminiferous epithelium occurred between 2 and 4 mo (P &lt; 0.001). Genes expressed in haploid germ cells (Protamine1 [PRM1], Outer Dense Fiber protein 2 [ODF2], and Stimulated by Retinoic Acid gene 8 [STRA8]) increased dramatically at the same time (P &lt; 0.001). Expression of other genes decreased (P &lt; 0.05) during testicular maturation. These genes included P450 side chain cleavage (CYP11A1), Sex determining region Y-box 9 (SOX9), Insulin-like Growth Factor 1 Receptor (IGF1R), and Heat Shock Protein A8 (HSPA8). The Glutathione S-Transferase A3 (GSTA3) gene, whose product was recently recognized as a primary enzyme involved in isomerization of androstenedione in man and livestock species including goats, sheep, cattle, pigs, and horses, uniquely peaked in expression at 2 mo (P &lt; 0.05). Follicle-Stimulating Hormone Receptor (FSHR) mRNA abundance tended to steadily decrease with age (P = 0.1), while Luteinizing Hormone Receptor (LHCGR) mRNA abundance in testes was not significantly different across the ages. Testosterone content per gram of testicular tissue varied among individuals. However, testosterone content per testis tended to increase at 6 mo (P = 0.06). In conclusion, major changes in cellular structure and gene expression in goat testes were observed at 4 mo of age, when spermatogenesis was initiated. Male goats mature rapidly and represent a good model species for the study of agents that enhance or impair development of testicular functions. 
Testis determination in mammals is initiated by expression of SRY in somatic cells of the embryonic gonad. Genetic analyses in the mouse have revealed a requirement for mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling in testis determination: targeted loss of the kinases MAP3K4 and p38 MAPK causes complete XY embryonic gonadal sex reversal. These kinases occupy positions at the top and bottom level, respectively, in the canonical three-tier MAPK-signaling cascade: MAP3K, MAP2K, MAPK. To date, no role in sex determination has been attributed to a MAP2K, although such a function is predicted to exist. Here, we report roles for the kinases MAP2K3 and MAP2K6 in testis determination. C57BL/6J (B6) embryos lacking MAP2K3 exhibited no significant abnormalities of testis development, whilst those lacking MAP2K6 exhibited a minor delay in testis determination. Compound mutants lacking three out of four functional alleles at the two loci also exhibited delayed testis determination and transient ovotestis formation as a consequence, suggestive of partially redundant roles for these kinases in testis determination. Early lethality of double-knockout embryos precludes analysis of sexual development. To reveal their roles in testis determination more clearly, we generated Map2k mutant B6 embryos using a weaker Sry allele (Sry(AKR)). Loss of Map2k3 on this highly sensitized background exacerbates ovotestis development, whilst loss of Map2k6 results in complete XY gonadal sex reversal associated with reduction of Sry expression at 11.25 days postcoitum. Our data suggest that MAP2K6 functions in mouse testis determination, via positive effects on Sry, and also indicate a minor role for MAP2K3.
46,XY complete gonadal dysgenesis (CGD) is a disorder of sexual development that can result from different mutations in genes associated with sex determination. Patients are phenotypically females, and the disease is often diagnosed in late adolescence because of delayed puberty. Here, we present the clinical and molecular data of a 46,XY female CGD patient with gonadoblastoma with dysgerminoma and incidentally found inherited thrombophilia. The clinical significance of the described de novo SRY gene mutation c.325T&gt;C (p.F109L) is discussed. This case report supports the critical role of the HGM domain in the SRY gene and the need of a multidisciplinary approach for CGD patients. 
This study was undertaken to investigate the development of immature oocytes after their fusion with male somatic cells expressing red fluorescence protein (RFP). RFP-expressing cells were fused with immature oocytes, matured in vitro and then parthenogenetically activated. Somatic nuclei showed spindle formation, 1st polar body extrusion after in vitro maturation and protruded the 2nd polar body after parthenogenetic activation. RFP was expressed in the resultant embryos; two-cell stage and blastocysts. Chromosomal analysis showed aneuploidy in 81.82% of the resulting blastocysts while 18.18% of the resulting blastocysts were diploid. Among eight RFP-expressing blastocysts, Xist mRNAs was detected in six while Sry mRNA was detected in only one blastocyst. We propose "prematuration somatic cell fusion" as an approach to generate embryos using somatic cells instead of spermatozoa. The current approach, if improved, would assist production of embryos for couples where the male partner is sterile, however, genetic and chromosomal analysis of the resultant embryos are required before transfer to the mothers. 
The mammalian Y chromosome is considered a symbol of maleness, as it encodes a gene driving male sex determination, Sry, as well as a battery of other genes important for male reproduction. We previously demonstrated in the mouse that successful assisted reproduction can be achieved when the Y gene contribution is limited to only two genes, Sry and spermatogonial proliferation factor Eif2s3y. Here, we replaced Sry by transgenic activation of its downstream target Sox9, and Eif2s3y, by transgenic overexpression of its X chromosome-encoded homolog Eif2s3x. The resulting males with no Y chromosome genes produced haploid male gametes and sired offspring after assisted reproduction. Our findings support the existence of functional redundancy between the Y chromosome genes and their homologs encoded on other chromosomes. 
Intestinal transplantation is an effective treatment for end-stage bowel failure; however, graft rejection and the toxicity associated with non-specific immunosuppression are major limitations of this procedure. Studies have shown that mixed chimerism can produce post-transplantation immune tolerance. Here, we demonstrate that in rat intestinal transplantation, PU.1-silenced dendritic cells (DCs) plus bone marrow (BM) cell transfusion results in mixed chimerism, and we investigate the mechanisms responsible for the effects of mixed chimerism rejection.
In a model of intestinal transplantation, male Brown Norway rats were the donors, and female Lewis rats were the recipients that were randomly divided into 4 groups: control, BM, BM-imDCs and BM-PU.1. The dynamic changes in graft morphology, rejection scoring and serum concentrations of Th1/Th2-related cytokines were investigated on postoperative days 0, 7, 14, 21, and 30.
The BM-PU.1 group had better graft health, milder pathologic injuries, and lower rejection grades compared with the other groups. The rates of mixed chimerism were significantly highest in the BM-PU.1 group and correlated with decreases in serum IL-2 and increases in serum IL-10.
Transfusion of PU.1-silenced DCs and BM cells induces stable mixed chimerism and has the potential to reduce pathologic injuries via a pro-Th2 shift in the Th1/Th2 balance.
In initial studies of the eutherian small Indian mongoose (Herpestes auropunctatus), the Y chromosome could not be identified in somatic cells. The male chromosome number is uniquely odd, 2n = 35, whereas that of females is 2n = 36. Previous reports indicated that this unique karyotype resulted from a translocation of the ancestral Y chromosome to an autosome. However, it has been difficult to identify the chromosomes that harbor the translocated Y chromosomal segment because it is an extremely small euchromatic region. Using a Southern blot analysis, we detected four conserved Y-linked genes, SRY, EIF2S3Y, KDM5D, and ZFY, in the male genome. We cloned homologues of these genes and determined their sequences, which showed high homology to genes in two carnivore species, cat and dog. To unambiguously identify the Y-bearing autosome, we performed immunostaining of pachytene spermatocytes using antibodies against SYCP3, γH2AX, and the centromere. We observed trivalent chromosomes, and the associations between the distal ends of the chromosomes were consistent with those of Y and X1 chromosomes. The centromere of the Y chromosome was located on the ancestral Y chromosomal segment. We mapped the complementary DNA (cDNA) clones of these genes to the male chromosomes using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), and the linear localization of all genes was confirmed by two-colored FISH. These Y-linked genes were localized to the proximal region of the long arm of a single telomeric chromosome, and we successfully identified the chromosome harboring the ancestral Y chromosomal segment.
Spermatogenesis is a key developmental process allowing for a formation of a mature male gamete. During its final phase, spermiogenesis, haploid round spermatids undergo cellular differentiation into spermatozoa, which involves extensive restructuring of cell morphology, DNA, and epigenome. Using mouse models with abrogated Y chromosome gene complements and Y-derived transgene we identified Y chromosome encoded Zfy2 as the gene responsible for sperm formation and function. In the presence of a Zfy2 transgene, mice lacking the Y chromosome and transgenic for two other Y-derived genes, Sry driving sex determination and Eif2s3y initiating spermatogenesis, are capable of producing sperm which when injected into the oocytes yield live offspring. Therefore, only three Y chromosome genes, Sry, Eif2s3y and Zfy2, constitute the minimum Y chromosome complement compatible with successful intracytoplasmic sperm injection in the mouse. 
Simple and precise methods for sex determination in animals are a pre-requisite for a number of applications in animal production and forensics. Some of the existing methods depend only on the detection of Y-chromosome specific sequences. However, the detection of Y and X-chromosome specific sequences is advantageous. In the present study the accuracy of sex determination by SRY (sex-determining region Y) and AMEL (Amelogenin) gene detection was assessed using a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of DNA extracted from free fetal cells in maternal blood, which is noninvasive for fetus and easier to collect. The PCR amplification of SRY primers produced a single band of 171bp from ewes bearing a male fetus, whereas no band was amplified from the DNA extracted from ewes pregnant to a female fetus. Moreover, two bands of 182 and 242bp in male and a single band of 242 in female fetuses were produced by AMEL gene primers in the PCR reaction. Using this technique 100% of samples were successfully sexed, excluding twins. In conclusion, we demonstrated that sex determination using DNA of free fetal cells in maternal plasma is efficient using both SRY and AMEL gene sequences. It also is evident that this method is not suitable for sex determination of twin pregnancies. 
We analyzed 34 azoospermic (AZ), 43 oligospermic (OS), and 40 infertile males with normal spermiogram (INS) together with 55 normal fertile males (NFM) from the Indian population. AZ showed more microdeletions in the AZFa and AZFb regions whereas oligospermic ones showed more microdeletions in the AZFc region. Frequency of the AZF partial deletions was higher in males with spermatogenic impairments than in INS. Significantly, SRY, DAZ and BPY2 genes showed copy number variation across different categories of the patients and much reduced copies of the DYZ1 repeat arrays compared to that in normal fertile males. Likewise, INS showed microdeletions, sequence and copy number variation of several Y linked genes and loci. In the context of infertility, STS deletions and copy number variations both were statistically significant (p = 0.001). Thus, semen samples used during in vitro fertilization (IVF) and assisted reproductive technology (ART) must be assessed for the microdeletions of AZFa, b and c regions in addition to the affected genes reported herein. Present study is envisaged to be useful for DNA based diagnosis of different categories of the infertile males lending support to genetic counseling to the couples aspiring to avail assisted reproductive technologies. 
This study was initiated to investigate the efficacy of myocardial fibrosis intervention via signal transducer and activators of transcription (STAT) signaling using bone marrow (BM) mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) in which being over-expressed with the aid of bispecific antibody (BiAb) and ultrasound-mediated microbubbles (MB). BiAb was prepared and combined with isolated MSC with CD47 overexpression from male mice and trans-fused into female mice with isoproterenol-induced myocardial fibrosis via the tail vein, followed by MB. This study included five groups. Five weeks after treatment, expression levels of the sex-determining region of Y-chromosome (SRY), matrix metalloproteinases (MMP)-9, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMP)-1 and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in myocardium were detected by fluorescent quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). The protein expression of signal transducer and activators of transcription (STAT) 1 and STAT 3 was detected by Western blot.
The highest homing number of MSC was in the CD47 + MSC + BiAb + MB group, second highest in the CD47 + MSC + BiAb group, and lowest in MSC alone. Compared with the Control group, CD47 + MSC + BiAb + MB, CD47 + MSC + BiAb, CD47 + MSC and MSC groups had decreased levels of MMP-9, TIMP-1, STAT 1 and collagen deposition, and increased levels of STAT 3. Up regulated STAT 3 and down regulated TIMP-1 were significantly different in CD47 + MSC + BiAb + MB compared with CD47 + MSC or CD47 + MSC + BiAb.
CD47 can enhance the homing rate and repairing efficacy of MSC. MSC can improve MMP-TIMP expression in injured myocardium and interfere with myocardial fibrosis after homing, a mechanism that may be related to the STAT-mediated signaling pathway.
This paper introduces a two-step cascade enrichment method for isolating nucleated red blood cells (NRBCs) in maternal blood. The two-step enrichment platform consists of a positive enrichment process based on a red blood cell (RBC) hyperaggregation method and a negative enrichment process using microfluidic technology. An analytical evaluation using blood samples from patients with leukemia showed that the while blood cell (WBC) depletion and NRBC loss rates of the positive enrichment process were 93.98 % and 6.02 %, respectively. Through the two-step cascade enrichment method, 1-396 NRBCs and only 0-6 WBCs were isolated from 1 mL of 18 maternal blood samples. Experimental results also showed that the WBC depletion rate of the proposed two-step method was more than 625,000-fold, and the purity of enriched NRBCs ranged from 20 % to 100 %. Furthermore, SRY (the sex-determining region of the Y chromosome) genes were detected in enriched NRBCs, thereby demonstrating that enriched NRBCs contain fetus-derived NRBCs. 
Gonadoblastoma (GB), a rare in situ germ cell tumor derived from sex cord and germ cells, is closely associated with gonadal dysgenesis. About 80% of GB individuals exhibit 46, XY female phenotype while the others are 45, XY and 46, XX with disorders of sex development. Moreover, 35% of GB can eventually develop into malignant tumors, such as seminoma and dysgerminoma tumors. The molecular genetic mechanism of GB remains to be fully uncovered due to phenotypic and genetic heterogeneity. Increasing studies show that the formation of GB is closely related to genes regulating sexual differentiation and determination (e.g., SRY, WT1, SOX9, Foxl2, TSPY, etc), and is affected by the interaction of genetic and epigenetic regulation. Here we describe the clinical and pathological features, diagnosis and treatment of GB, and also summarize the molecular genetic and epigenetic mechanisms underlying the gonadal abnormalities that lead to GB. We analyze and construct the common gene regulatory networks related to the development of GB, and describe some obstacles and deficiencies in current studies to provide innovative perspectives on further studying the pathological and molecular mechanisms of GB.
The Y chromosome gene Sry is responsible for sex determination in mammals and initiates a cascade of events that direct differentiation of bipotential genital ridges toward male-specific fate. Sox9 is an autosomal gene and a primary downstream target of SRY. The activation of Sox9 in the absence of Sry is sufficient for initiation of male-specific sex determination. Sry-to-Sox9 replacement has mostly been studied in the context of sex determination during early embryogenesis. Here, we tested whether Sry-to-Sox9 replacement affects male fertility in adulthood. We examined males with the Y chromosome carrying a deletion removing the endogenous Sry, with testes determination driven either by the Sox9 (XY(Tdym1)Sox9) or the Sry (XY(Tdym1)Sry) transgenes as well as wild-type males (XY). XY(Tdym1)Sox9 males had reduced testes size, altered testes shape and vasculature, and increased incidence of defects in seminiferous epithelium underlying the coelomic blood vessel region when compared to XY(Tdym1)Sry and XY. There were no differences between XY(Tdym1)Sry and XY(Tdym1)Sox9 males in respect to sperm number, motility, morphology, and ability to fertilize oocytes in vitro, but for some parameters, transgenic males were impaired when compared to XY. In fecundity trials, XY(Tdym1)Sry, XY(Tdym1)Sox9, and XY males yielded similar average numbers of pups and litters. Overall, our findings support that males lacking the testis determinant Sry can be fertile and reinforce the notion that Sry does not play a role in mature gonads. Although transgenic Sox9 overexpression in the absence of Sry results in certain testicular abnormalities, it does not translate into fertility impairment.
Sex determination in mammals requires expression of the Y-linked gene Sry in the bipotential genital ridges of the XY embryo. Even minor delay of the onset of Sry expression can result in XY sex reversal, highlighting the need for accurate gene regulation during sex determination. However, the location of critical regulatory elements remains unknown. Here, we analysed Sry flanking sequences across many species, using newly available genome sequences and computational tools, to better understand Sry's genomic context and to identify conserved regions predictive of functional roles.
Flanking sequences from 17 species were analysed using both global and local sequence alignment methods. Multiple motif searches were employed to characterise common motifs in otherwise unconserved sequence.
We identified position-specific conservation of binding motifs for multiple transcription factor families, including GATA binding factors and Oct/Sox dimers. In contrast with the landscape of extremely low sequence conservation around the Sry coding region, our analysis highlighted a strongly conserved interval of ~106 bp within the Sry promoter (which we term the Sry Proximal Conserved Interval, SPCI). We further report that inverted repeats flanking murine Sry are much larger than previously recognised.
The unusually fast pace of sequence drift on the Y chromosome sharpens the likely functional significance of both the SPCI and the identified binding motifs, providing a basis for future studies of the role(s) of these elements in Sry regulation.
A single-born, 15-month-old Holstein cattle, diagnosed as hermaphrodite, was investigated for estrous cycle, hormonal profiles, karyotype, presence of SRY, as well as anatomopathological and histological aspects. Normal continuous estrous cycles and basal testosterone levels were reported. Necropsy showed the presence of a female genital tract that mismatched a vulvar opening and a male pelvic urethra continued within a penis. Moreover, we observed islands of seminiferous tubules with the presence of germline cells, 2 pampiniform plexi, the corpus cavernosum, the penile urethra, the corpus spongiosum and the glans. Cytogenetic analyses of the blood cells showed an XX karyotype, while the molecular analyses revealed the presence of the SRY gene in several tissues, including blood. This is the first report in the scientific literature of an SRY-positive hermaphrodite Holstein cattle with continuous ovarian cycles. 
Gonadal sex in most mammals is determined based on sex differentiation of the supporting cell lineages. In mouse XY gonads, SRY induces SOX9 upregulation and subsequent FGF9 expression by embryonic day 11.5 (E11.5), leading to the differentiation of Sertoli cells. XX gonads, lacking SRY action, start on the ovarian program through the actions of WNT4 and FOXL2 from around E11.5-12.0. These 2 ovarian factors, together with retinoic acid (RA) action, promote feminization partially through the repression of the masculinizing activities of SOX9, FGF9 and DMRT1. RA initiates meiosis in female germ cell cysts, in which intercellular bridges between interconnected germ cells rapidly undergo cyst breakdown by E17.5. Ovarian morphogenesis is characterized by continuous recruitment of pre-granulosa progenitor cells from the coelomic epithelia during the embryonic stage, which results in the formation of ovigerous cords and tight packing of non-interconnected oocytes (i.e. oocyte nests) at the perinatal stages. At birth, the oocyte nests break down into single oocytes surrounded by granulosa cells, leading to the assembly of primordial follicles. This review focuses on recent advances in the molecular and cellular events of initial ovarian differentiation, meiotic initiation, germ cell nest breakdown, and primordial follicle formation based on anatomical and morphogenetic aspects. 
The increasing incidence of reproductive anomalies, described as testicular dysgenesis syndrome, is thought to be related to the exposure of the population to chemicals in the environment. Bisphenol A (BPA) and di(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate (DEHP), which have hormonal and antihormonal activity, have attracted public attention due to their presence in consumer products. The present study investigated the effects of BPA and DEHP on reproductive development. Timed-pregnant female rats were exposed to BPA and DEHP by gavage from gestational days 12 to 21. Results showed that prenatal exposures to test chemicals exerted variable effects on steroidogenic factor 1 and GATA binding protein 4 protein expression and increased (P &lt; .05) sex-determining region Y-box 9 and antimüllerian hormone protein in the infantile rat testis compared with levels in the control unexposed animals. Pituitary LHβ and FSHβ subunit protein expression was increased (P &lt; .05) in BPA- and DEHP-exposed prepubertal male rats but were decreased (P &lt; .05) in adult animals relative to control. Exposure to both BPA and DEHP in utero inhibited (P &lt; .05) global DNA hydroxymethylation in the adult testis in association with altered DNA methyltransferase protein expression. Together the present data suggest that altered developmental programming in the testes associated with chemical exposures are related to the disruption of sexual differentiation events and DNA methylation patterns. The chemical-induced effects impact the development of steroidogenic capacity in the adult testis. 
Animal researches and clinical studies have supported the relevance between phthalates exposure and testicular dysgenesis syndrome (TDS). These disorders may comprise common origin in fetal life, especially during sex determination and differentiation, where the mechanism remains unclear. The present study evaluated the disturbances in gene regulatory networks of sex determination in fetal mouse by in utero Di (2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) exposure. Temporal expression of key sex determination genes were examined during the critical narrow time window, using whole-mount in situ hybridization and quantitative-PCR. DEHP exposure resulted in significant reduction in mRNA of Sry during sex determination from gestation day (GD) 11.0 to 11.5 in male fetal mice, and the increasing of Sry expression to threshold level on GD 11.5 was delayed. Meanwhile, Gadd45g and Gata4, the upstream genes of Sry, and downstream gene Sox9 were also significantly downregulated in expression. In fetal females, the expression of Wnt4 and beta-catenin were up-regulated by DEHP exposure. Taken together, the results suggest that the potential mechanism of gonadal development disorder by DEHP may origin from repression of important male sex determination signaling pathway, involving Gadd45g → Gata4 → Sry → Sox9. The results would promote a better understanding of the association between phthalate esters (PAEs) exposure and the reductive disorder.
Mammalian sexual fate is determined by the presence or absence of sex determining region of the Y chromosome (Sry) in the "bipotential" gonads. Recent studies have demonstrated that both male and female sexual development are induced by distinct and active genetic pathways. Breeding the Y chromosome from Mus m. domesticus poschiavinus (POS) strains into C57BL/6J (B6J) mice (B6J-XY(POS)) has been shown to induce sex reversal (75%: bilateral ovary, 25%: true hermaphrodites). However, our B6N-XY(POS) mice, which were generated by backcrossing of B6J-XY(POS) on an inbred B6N-XX, develop as males (36%: bilateral testis with fertility as well as bilateral ovary (34%), and the remainder develop as true hermaphrodites. Here, we investigated in detail the expressions of essential sex-related genes and histological features in B6N-XY(POS) mice from the fetal period to adulthood. The onsets of both Sry and SRY-box 9 (Sox9) expressions as determined spatiotemporally by whole-mount immunohistochemistry in the B6N-XY(POS) gonads occurred 2-3 tail somites later than those in B6N-XY(B6) gonads, but earlier than those in B6J-XY(POS), respectively. It is possible that such a small difference in timing of the Sry expression underlies testicular development in our B6N-XY(POS). Our study is the first to histologically show the expression and ectopic localization of a female-related gene in the XY(POS) testes and a male-related gene in the XY(POS) ovaries. The results from these and previous experiments indicate that the interplay between genome variants, epigenetics and developmental gene regulation is crucial for testis development. 
The SOX gene family includes many genes that play a determinant role in several developmental pathways. The SOX9 gene has been identified as a major factor in testis development in mammals after it is activated by the SRY gene. However, duplication of the gene itself in some mammalian species, or of a well-delimited upstream 'RevSex' region in humans, has been shown to result in testis development in the absence of the SRY gene. In the current study, we present an accurate analysis of the genomic organization of the SOX9 locus in dogs by both in silico and FISH approaches. Contrary to what is observed in the current dog genome assembly, we found that the genomic organization is quite similar to that reported in humans and other mammalian species, including the position of the RevSex region in respect to SOX9. The analysis of the conserved sequences within this region in 7 mammalian species facilitated the highlighting of a consensus sequence for SRY binding. This new information could help in the identification of evolutionarily conserved elements relevant for SOX9 gene regulation, and could provide valid targets for mutation analysis in XY DSD patients.
Diagnosis of fetal gender early in pregnancy is very useful as it would prevent invasive fetal sampling in almost half the cases at risk of inheriting X-linked disorders or those affecting sexual differentiation. Noninvasive prenatal diagnosis (NIPD) using circulating cell-free fetal (cff) DNA from maternal circulation has emerged as a useful alternative to existing methods for prenatal diagnosis of gender. NIPD eliminates the risk of miscarriage from invasive prenatal diagnosis and the necessity of possessing specialized obstetric skills for fetal tissue sampling. The aim of this study was to compare two Y chromosome markers-SRY and DYS14-for their utility in the diagnosis of fetal gender.
Forty-eight plasma samples from pregnant women between 9 and 25 weeks of gestation were analyzed. Real-time polymerase chain reaction was performed on cff DNA extracted from maternal plasma to detect fetal Y chromosome with SRY (n=27) and DYS14 (n=48) markers.
We observed 100% sensitivity and 85.6% specificity in noninvasive Y chromosome detection with the combined use of DYS14 and SRY markers (n=27) compared with the results obtained on using DYS14 (n=48 sensitivity 94%; specificity 71.4%) and SRY (n=27, sensitivity 84%; specificity 92.8%) markers alone.
Our results show that the test performance improved with the employment of two Y-amplification assays.
Sex-reversal cases in humans and genetic models in mice have revealed that the fate of the bipotential gonad hinges upon the balance between pro-testis SOX9 and pro-ovary beta-catenin pathways. Our central query was: if SOX9 and beta-catenin define the gonad's identity, then what do the gonads become when both factors are absent? To answer this question, we developed mouse models that lack either Sox9, beta-catenin, or both in the somatic cells of the fetal gonads and examined the morphological outcomes and transcriptome profiles. In the absence of Sox9 and beta-catenin, both XX and XY gonads progressively lean toward the testis fate, indicating that expression of certain pro-testis genes requires the repression of the beta-catenin pathway, rather than a direct activation by SOX9. We also observed that XY double knockout gonads were more masculinized than their XX counterpart. To identify the genes responsible for the initial events of masculinization and to determine how the genetic context (XX vs. XY) affects this process, we compared the transcriptomes of Sox9/beta-catenin mutant gonads and found that early molecular changes underlying the XY-specific masculinization involve the expression of Sry and 21 SRY direct target genes, such as Sox8 and Cyp26b1. These results imply that when both Sox9 and beta-catenin are absent, Sry is capable of activating other pro-testis genes and drive testis differentiation. Our findings not only provide insight into the mechanism of sex determination, but also identify candidate genes that are potentially involved in disorders of sex development. 
This report describes a disorder of the sexual development in a beagle dog resulting in an intersex condition. A 6 mo old beagle was presented for evaluation of a protruding structure from the vulva consistent with an enlarged clitoris. Ultrasonographic examination revealed the presence of both gonadal and uterine structures. Retrograde cystourethrovaginogram showed the presence of an os clitoris and severe vaginal stenosis. Histological studies revealed the presence of bilateral ovotestes and uterus. The gonad had interstitial cells within seminiferous-like tubules lined only with Sertoli cells and abundant interstitial cells among primordial, primary, and secondary follicles. Hormone assays completed before and after gonadohysterectomy showed an elevation in the levels of progesterone and dihydrotestosterone that returned to baseline 3 mo after surgery. Testosterone levels that were within the male reference ranges before surgery decreased to basal levels postsurgically. 17-β-Estradiol levels showed little variation and values were always within the reference ranges for a male. Cytogenetic analysis showed a normal female karyotype (2n = 78, XX) and polymerase chain reaction analysis revealed the absence of the sex-determining region Y gene. In summary, the dog presented bilateral ovotestes and a 2n = 78, XX chromosomal complement lacking the sex determining region Y gene, consistent with a diagnosis of true hermaphroditism. 
The acquisition of stemness is a hallmark of aggressive human hepatocellular carcinoma (hHCC). The stem cell marker OCT4 is frequently expressed in HCCs, and its expression correlates with those of putative cancer stem cell (CSC) markers and CSC properties. Here, we describe a novel mechanism of CSC maintenance by SRY through OCT4. We previously reported that Sry is involved in tumor malignancy in rodent HCCs. However, the oncogenic function of SRY in hHCCs is poorly understood. Ectopic expression of SRY increased multiple stem cell factors, including OCT4 and CD13. The OCT4 promoter contained SRY-binding sites that were directly activated by SRY. In HCC-derived cells, SRY knockdown decreased OCT4 expression and cancer stem-like phenotypes such as self-renewal, chemoresistance, and tumorigenicity. Conversely, OCT4 and SRY overexpression promoted cancer stem-like phenotypes. OCT4 knockdown in SRY clones downregulated the self-renewal capacity and chemoresistance. These data suggest that SRY is involved in the maintenance of cancer stem-like characteristics through OCT4. Moreover, CSCs of HCC-derived cells differentiated into Tuj1-positive neuron-like cells by retinoic acid. Noteworthily, SRY was highly expressed in some hHCC patients. Taken together, our findings imply a novel therapeutic strategy against CSCs of hHCCs.
Nonsyndromic 46,XX testicular disorders of sex development (46,XX testicular DSD) are characterized by the presence of a 46,XX karyotype; male external genitalia ranging from normal to ambiguous; two testicles; azoospermia; and absence of müllerian structures. Approximately 85% of individuals with nonsyndromic 46,XX testicular DSD present after puberty with normal pubic hair and normal penile size but small testes, gynecomastia, and sterility resulting from azoospermia. Approximately 15% of individuals with nonsyndromic 46,XX testicular DSD present at birth with ambiguous genitalia. Gender role and gender identity are reported as male. If untreated, males with 46,XX testicular DSD experience the consequences of testosterone deficiency.
Diagnosis of nonsyndromic 46,XX testicular DSD is based on the combination of clinical findings, endocrine testing, and cytogenetic testing. Endocrine studies usually show hypergonadotropic hypogonadism secondary to testicular failure. Cytogenetic studies at the 550-band level demonstrate a 46,XX karyotype. SRY, the gene that encodes the sex-determining region Y protein, is the principal gene known to be associated with 46,XX testicular DSD. Approximately 80% of individuals with nonsyndromic 46,XX testicular DSD are SRY positive as shown by use of FISH or chromosomal microarray (CMA). Rearrangements in or around SOX9 and SOX3 detected by CMA, or rarely karyotype, have recently been reported in a few cases; at least one more as-yet-unknown gene at another locus is implicated.
Treatment of manifestations: Similar to that for other causes of testosterone deficiency. After age 14 years, low-dose testosterone therapy is initiated and gradually increased to reach adult levels. In affected individuals with short stature who are eligible for growth hormone therapy, testosterone therapy is either delayed or given at lower doses initially in order to maximize the growth potential. Reduction mammoplasty may need to be considered if gynecomastia remains an issue following testosterone replacement therapy. Treatment for osteopenia is by standard protocols. Providers are encouraged to anticipate the need for further psychological support. Surveillance: Monitor for testosterone effects during testosterone replacement therapy, including prostate size and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) in adults; routine monitoring of hematocrit, lipid profile, and liver function tests; bone mineral density determination by bone densitometry (DEXA) annually, if osteopenia has been diagnosed. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Contraindications to testosterone replacement therapy include prostate cancer (known or suspected) and breast cancer; oral androgens such as methyltestosterone and fluoxymesterone should not be given because of liver toxicity.
SRY-positive 46,XX testicular DSD is generally not inherited because it results from de novo abnormal interchange between the Y chromosome and the X chromosome, resulting in the presence of SRY on the X chromosome and infertility. When SRY is translocated to another chromosome or when fertility is preserved, sex-limited autosomal dominant inheritance is observed. Autosomal dominant inheritance has been documented for familial cases thought to be caused by CNV in or around SOX9. The mode of inheritance of other SRY-negative 46,XX testicular DSD is not known, but autosomal recessive inheritance has been postulated. Prenatal diagnosis for pregnancies at risk for SRY-positive 46,XX testicular DSD is possible.
Mixed gonadal dysgenesis (MGD) is a disorder of sexual development that typically has a mosaic 45,X/46,XY karyotype. A 1-year-old infant with 46,XY identified by peripheral blood karyotype demonstrated clinical manifestations and gonadal pathologic features of MGD. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) for X and Y chromosomes and immunofluorescence for SRY along with testicular and ovarian lineage markers SOX9 and FOXL2, respectively, were performed on paraffin sections from the gonad to ascertain the somatic mosaic state for 45,X monosomy and 46,XY cells. The gonad consisted of cells with X and XY signals, which were further quantified in comparison with a normal control testis by a digital image analysis program. The average percentages of 45,X cells of this patient's gonad and a control testis were 39.0% and 5.7%, respectively (χ2 test, P &lt; 0.001). SRY expression was absent in approximately 10% of precursor granulosa cells (FOXL2 positive) and precursor Sertoli/granulosa cells (both SOX9 and FOXL2 positive) within gonadoblastomas, confirming the involvement of 45,X cells. A combination of analysis of FISH and immunofluorescence for SRY in the gonadal tissue could identify 45,X cells in MGD with 46,XY.
To assess genetic mutations and associated somatic anomalies in a series of patients with 46,XY gonadal dysgenesis (GD).
Single center retrospective study.
University pediatric hospital.
Fourteen patients with 46,XY GD.
None.
Genotype-phenotype relationship.
The presenting symptom was disorders of sex development (6 patients), primary amenorrhea (2 patients), discordance between 46,XY karyotype and female external genitalia (3 patients), discovery of Müllerian structures at surgery (2 patients), or diagnosed in the evaluation of a gonadal tumor (1 patient). Müllerian structures were shown by ultrasound evaluation in 7 of 13 patients, genitography in 3 of 6 patients and/or surgery in 8 of 10 patients (3 not seen at imaging), or only by histologic examination (1 patient). Three patients had gonadoblastoma and/or seminoma. A mutation was found in 7 patients of whom 2 had family history of reproductive problems and 5 had associated somatic anomalies. The mutations were FOG2/ZFPM2 (1 patient), SRY (2 patients), WT1 (1 patient), or deletions of distal chromosome 9p (3 patients). Among the three other patients with associated anomalies and no mutation, two had ectodermal dysplasia and one had leukemia.
Mutations were observed in half of the patients with 46,XY GD with Müllerian structures. We also describe for the first time the association between GD and ectodermal dysplasia. Müllerian structures can be found in some cases only by histologic examination, which should be coupled to preventive gonadectomy because of the risk of tumor formation.
We set out to investigate whether and how SRY (sex-determining region, Y) DNAs in plasma EVs (extracellular vesicles) is involved in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. PCR and gene sequencing found the SRY gene fragment in plasma EVs from male, but not female, patients; EVs from male patients with CAD (coronary artery disease) had a higher SRY GCN (gene copy number) than healthy subjects. Additional studies found that leucocytes, the major source of plasma EVs, had higher SRY GCN and mRNA and protein expression in male CAD patients than controls. After incubation with EVs from SRY-transfected HEK (human embryonic kidney)-293 cells, monocytes (THP-1) and HUVECs (human umbilical vein endothelial cells), which do not endogenously express SRY protein, were found to express newly synthesized SRY protein. This resulted in an increase in the adherence factors CD11-a in THP-1 cells and ICAM-1 (intercellular adhesion molecule 1) in HUVECs. EMSA showed that SRY protein increased the promoter activity of CD11-a in THP-1 cells and ICAM-1 in HUVECs. There was an increase in THP-1 cells adherent to HUVECs after incubation with SRY-EVs. SRY DNAs transferred from EVs have pathophysiological significance in vivo; injection of SRY EVs into ApoE-/- (apolipoprotein-knockout) mice accelerated atherosclerosis. The SRY gene in plasma EVs transferred to vascular endothelial cells may play an important role in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis; this mechanism provides a new approach to the understanding of inheritable CAD in men. 
The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) is subject to sex-specific modulation by hormones and gene products. However, sex differences in the balance between the vasoconstrictor/proliferative ACE/ANG II/AT1 axis, and the vasodilator/antiproliferative ACE2/ANG-(1-7)/MAS axis are poorly known. Data in the rat have suggested the male-specific Y-chromosome gene Sry to contribute to balance between these two axes, but why the testis-determining gene has these functions remains unknown. A combination of in silico genetic/protein comparisons, functional luciferase assays for promoters of the human RAS, and RNA-Seq profiling in rat were used to address if regulation of Sry on the RAS is conserved in the homologous X-chromosome gene, Sox3. Both SRY and SOX3 upregulated the promoter of Angiotensinogen (AGT) and downregulated the promoters of ACE2, AT2, and MAS, likely through overlapping mechanisms. The regulation by both SRY and SOX3 on the MAS promoter indicates a cis regulation through multiple SOX binding sites. The Renin (REN) promoter is upregulated by SRY and downregulated by SOX3, likely through trans and cis mechanisms, respectively. Sry transcripts are found in all analyzed male rat tissues including the kidney, while Sox3 transcripts are found only in the brain and testis, suggesting that the primary tissue for renin production (kidney) can only be regulated by SRY and not SOX3. These results suggest that SRY regulation of the RAS is partially shared with its X-chromosome homolog SOX3, but SRY gained a sex-specific control in the kidney for the rate-limiting step of the RAS, potentially resulting in male-specific blood pressure regulation. 
We investigated the effect of the Y chromosome on testis weight in (B6.Cg-A(y) × Y-consomic mouse strain) F1 male mice. We obtained the following results: (1) Mice with the Mus musculus domesticus-type Y chromosome had significantly heavier testis than those with the M. m. musculus-type Y chromosome. (2) Variations in Usp9y and the number of CAG repeats in Sry were significantly associated with testes weight. The A(y) allele was correlated with a reduced testis weight, and the extent of this reduction was significantly associated with a CAG repeat number polymorphism in Sry. These results suggest that Y chromosome genes not only influence testis weight but also modify the effect of the A(y) allele in mediating this phenomenon. 
Prenatal diagnosis of sex-linked disorders requires invasive procedures, carrying a risk of miscarriage of up to 1%. Cell-free fetal DNA (cffDNA) present in cell-free DNA (cfDNA) from maternal plasma offers a non-invasive source of fetal genetic material for analysis. Detection of Y-chromosome sequences in cfDNA indicates presence of a male fetus; in the absence of a Y-chromosome signal a female fetus is inferred. We aimed to validate the clinical utility of insertion-deletion polymorphisms (INDELs) to confirm presence of a female fetus using cffDNA.
Quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) for the Y-chromosome-specific sequence, SRY, was performed on cfDNA from 82 samples at 6-39 gestational weeks. In samples without detectable SRY, qPCRs for eight INDELs were performed on maternal genomic DNA and cfDNA. Detection of paternally inherited fetal alleles in cfDNA negative for SRY confirmed a female fetus.
Fetal sex was correctly determined in 77/82 (93.9%) cfDNA samples. SRY was detected in all 39 samples from male-bearing pregnancies, and none of the 43 female-bearing pregnancies (sensitivity and specificity of SRY qPCR is therefore 100%; 95% CI 91%-100%). Paternally inherited fetal alleles were detected in 38/43 samples with no SRY signal, confirming the presence of a female fetus (INDEL assay sensitivity is therefore 88.4%; 95% CI 74.1%-95.6%). Since paternally inherited fetal INDELs were not used in women bearing male fetuses, the specificity of INDELs cannot be calculated. Five cfDNA samples were negative for both SRY and INDELS.
We have validated a non-invasive prenatal test to confirm fetal sex as early as 6 gestational weeks using cffDNA from maternal plasma.
Ullrich-Turner syndrome (UTS) is a common chromosomal abnormality caused by partial or complete X chromosome monosomy. One half of the patients have a 45,X karyotype, whereas the remaining patients display other X chromosome anomalies. In 6% to 11% of UTS, a normal or partly deleted Y chromosome has been found. A 10% to 30% risk of developing gonadoblastoma was found in the latter patients. The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of Y chromosome-derived material, the occurrence of gonadoblastoma, and the incidence of possible neoplasms in patients with UTS. Of 217 patients studied with UTS and chromosome analysis of peripheral-blood lymphocytes, Y chromosome material was found in 20 patients. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) testing was performed to characterize the structurally abnormal Y chromosome in 13 cases. Molecular analysis of the SRY gene could only be performed in 20 patients with 45,X karyotype. Two patients had the SRY genomes. Of the 20 patients with Y chromosome-derived material, 17 underwent gonadectomy. The incidence of gonadoblastoma development in our series was 35.5%. Furthermore, 1 patient also showed a pure dysgerminoma, and another showed a mixed dysgerminoma and embryonal carcinoma. We emphasize the importance of complete processing of the gonadectomy specimen, including step sections, molecular studies, and FISH, in addition to the classic cytogenetic searching for Y chromosome sequences, in patients who present with a nonmosaic 45,X karyotype. Finally, we propose to routinely collect a sample for storage in the tumor bank for future studies. 
Health assessment of the transplanted organ is very important due to the relationship of long-term survival of organ transplant recipients and health organ maintenance. Nowadays, the measurement of cell-free DNA from grafts in the circulation of transplant recipients has been considered a potential biomarker of organ rejection or transplant associated complications in an attempt to replace or reduce liver biopsy. However, methods developed to date are expensive and extremely time-consuming. Our approach was to measure the SRY gene, as a male organ biomarker, in a setting of sex-mismatched female recipients of male donor organs.
Cell-free DNA quantization of the SRY gene was performed by real-time quantitative PCR beforehand, at the moment of transplantation during reperfusion (day 0) and during the stay at the intensive care unit. Beta-globin cell-free DNA levels, a general cellular damage marker, were also quantified.
Beta-globin mean values of patients, who accepted the graft without any complications during the first week after surgery, diminished from day 0 until patient stabilization. This decrease was not so evident in patients who suffered some kind of post-transplantation complications. All patients showed an increase in SRY levels at day 0, which decreased during hospitalization. Different complications that did not compromise donated organs showed increased beta-globin levels but no SRY gene levels. However, when a donated organ was damaged the patients exhibited high levels of both genes.
Determination of a SRY gene in a female recipient's serum is a clear and specific biomarker of donated organs and may give us important information about graft health in a short period of time by a non-expensive technique. This approach may permit clinicians to maintain a close follow up of the transplanted patient.
Inguinal hernia is a common developmental disease in children and most cases are indirect inguinal hernia (IIH). Genetic factors have been suggested to play important roles in IIH. Although IIH has been observed in several human syndromes, genetic causes and molecular mechanisms for IIH remain unknown. TBX3 is a member of the T-box family of transcription factors that are essential to the embryonic development. Human studies and animal experiments have demonstrated that TBX3 is required for the development of the heart, limbs, mammary glands and other tissues and organs. TBX3 gene expression has been detected in human fibroblast and tissues of abdominal wall. We speculated that TBX3 may be involved in the IIH formation. Since TBX3 activity is highly dosage-sensitive, a TBX3 gene promoter was genetically and functionally analyzed in IIH patients and ethnic-matched controls in this study. One heterozygous deletion variant (g.4820_4821del) was identified in one IIH patient, but in none of controls. The variant significantly decreased TBX3 gene promoter activities, likely by creating a binding site for sex-determining region Y (SRY), mobility group transcription factor. One heterozygous insertion variant (g.3913_3914ins) was only found in one control, which did not affect TBX3 gene promoter activities. Taken together, TBX3 gene variants may contribute to IIH as a rare risk factor by reducing TBX3 levels. 
Sex determination in animals and fungi is regulated by specific sex-determining genes. The Aspergillus nidulans mating type gene matA and the human SRY (Sex-Determining Region Y) encode proteins containing a single HMG (high-mobility group) domain. Analysis of the amino-acid sequence of MatA and SRY transcription factors revealed significant structural similarity. The human SRY protein is able to functionally replace MatA and drives the sexual cycle in the fungus A. nidulans. Functional studies indicate that SRY drives early fruiting body development, and hybrid MatA protein carrying the SRY HMG box is fully capable of driving both early and late stages of sexual development, including gametogenesis. Our data suggest that SRY and MatA are both structurally and functionally related and conserved in regulating sexual processes. The fundamental mechanisms driving evolution of the genetic pathways underlying sex determination, sex chromosomes and sexual reproduction in eukaryotes appear similar. 
Epidemiologic studies have shown sex differences in ischemic stroke. The four core genotype (FCG) mouse model, in which the testes determining gene, Sry, has been moved from Y chromosome to an autosome, was used to dissociate the effects of sex hormones from sex chromosome in ischemic stroke outcome. Middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) in gonad intact FCG mice revealed that gonadal males (XXM and XYM) had significantly higher infarct volumes as compared with gonadal females (XXF and XYF). Serum testosterone levels were equivalent in adult XXM and XYM, as was serum estrogen in XXF and XYF mice. To remove the effects of gonadal hormones, gonadectomized FCG mice were subjected to MCAO. Gonadectomy significantly increased infarct volumes in females, while no change was seen in gonadectomized males, indicating that estrogen loss increases ischemic sensitivity. Estradiol supplementation in gonadectomized FCG mice rescued this phenotype. Interestingly, FCG male mice were less sensitive to effects of hormones. This may be due to enhanced expression of the transgene Sry in brains of FCG male mice. Sex differences in ischemic stroke sensitivity appear to be shaped by organizational and activational effects of sex hormones, rather than sex chromosomal complement. 
Activated bronchial epithelial cells (BEC) release various alarmins, including thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP), that drive type 2 inflammation. We hypothesize that BEC-derived factors promote in situ eosinophil differentiation and maturation, a process that is driven by an IL-5-rich microenvironment in asthmatic airways. To assess the eosinophilopoietic potential of epithelial-derived factors, eosinophil/basophil colony forming units (Eo/B-CFU) were enumerated in 14-day methylcellulose cultures of blood-derived nonadherent mononuclear cells incubated with BEC supernatants (BECSN) from healthy nonatopic controls (n = 8), mild atopic asthmatics (n = 9), and severe asthmatics (n = 5). Receptor-blocking antibodies were used to evaluate the contribution of alarmins. Modulation of the mRNA expression of transcription factors that are crucial for eosinophil differentiation was evaluated. BECSN stimulated the clonogenic expansion of eosinophil progenitors in vitro. In the presence of IL-5, Eo/B-CFU numbers were significantly greater in cocultures of BESCN from severe asthmatics compared with other groups. This was attenuated in the presence of a TSLP (but not an IL-33) receptor-blocking antibody. Recombinant human TSLP (optimal at 100 pg/ml) stimulated Eo/B-CFU growth, which was significantly enhanced in the presence of IL-5 (1 ng/ml). Overnight culture of CD34+ cells with IL-5 and TSLP synergistically increased GATA-binding factor 2 and CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein α mRNA expression. The eosinophilopoietic potential of factors derived from BEC is increased in severe asthma. Our data suggest that TSLP is a key alarmin that is produced by BECs and promotes in situ eosinophilopoiesis in a type 2-rich microenvironment.
Autism is a complex heterogeneous neurodevelopmental disorder; previous studies have identified altered immune responses among individuals diagnosed with autism. An imbalance in the production of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines and transcription factors plays a role in neurodevelopmental behavioral and autism disorders. BTBR T+ Itpr3tf/J (BTBR) mice are used as a model for autism, as they exhibit social deficits, communication deficits, and repetitive behaviors compared with C57BL/6J (B6) mice. The adenosine A2A receptor (A2AR) appears to be a potential target for the improvement of behavioral, inflammatory, immune, and neurological disorders. We investigated the effects of the A2AR antagonist SCH 5826 (SCH) and agonist CGS 21680 (CGS) on IL-21, IL-22, T-bet, T-box transcription factor (T-bet), GATA3 (GATA Binding Protein 3), and CD152 (CTLA-4) expression in BTBR mice. Our results showed that BTBR mice treated with SCH had increased CD4+IL-21+, CD4+IL-22+, CD4+GATA3+, and CD4+T-bet+ and decreased CD4+CTLA-4+ expression in spleen cells compared with BTBR control mice. Moreover, CGS efficiently decreased CD4+IL-21+, CD4+IL-22+, CD4+GATA3+, and CD4+T-bet+ and increased CD4+CTLA-4 production in spleen cells compared with SCH-treated and BTBR control mice. Additionally, SCH treatment significantly increased the mRNA and protein expression levels of IL-21, IL-22, GATA3, and T-bet in brain tissue compared with CGS-treated and BTBR control mice. The augmented levels of IL-21/IL-22 and GATA3/T-bet could be due to altered A2AR signaling. Our results indicate that A2AR agonists may represent a new class of compounds that can be developed for use in the treatment of autistic and neuroimmune dysfunctions.
Forkhead box protein A1 (FOXA1) is essential for the growth and differentiation of breast epithelium, and has a favorable outcome in breast cancer (BC). Elevated FOXA1 expression in BC also facilitates hormone responsiveness in estrogen receptor (ESR)-positive BC. However, the interaction between these two pathways is not fully understood. FOXA1 and GATA binding protein 3 (GATA3) along with ESR1 expression are responsible for maintaining a luminal phenotype, thus suggesting the existence of a strong association between them. The present study utilized the Oncomine™ microarray database to identify FOXA1:ESR1 and FOXA1:ESR1:GATA3 co-expression co-regulated genes. Oncomine™ analysis revealed 115 and 79 overlapping genes clusters in FOXA1:ESR1 and FOXA1:ESR1:GATA3 microarrays, respectively. Five ESR1 direct target genes [trefoil factor 1 (TFF1/PS2), B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL2), seven in absentia homolog 2 (SIAH2), cellular myeloblastosis viral oncogene homolog (CMYB) and progesterone receptor (PGR)] were detected in the co-expression clusters. To further investigate the role of FOXA1 in ESR1-positive cells, MCF7 cells were transfected with a FOXA1 expression plasmid, and it was observed that the direct target genes of ESR1 (PS2, BCL2, SIAH2 and PGR) were significantly regulated upon transfection. Analysis of one of these target genes, PS2, revealed the presence of two FOXA1 binding sites in the vicinity of the estrogen response element (ERE), which was confirmed by binding assays. Under estrogen stimulation, FOXA1 protein was recruited to the FOXA1 site and could also bind to the ERE site (although in minimal amounts) in the PS2 promoter. Co-transfection of FOXA1/ESR1 expression plasmids demonstrated a significantly regulation of the target genes identified in the FOXA1/ESR1 multi-arrays compared with only FOXA1 transfection, which was suggestive of a synergistic effect of ESR1 and FOXA1 on the target genes. In summary, the present study identified novel FOXA1, ESR1 and GATA3 co-expressed genes that may be involved in breast tumorigenesis.
GATA-binding protein 3 (GATA3) has been identified as a sensitive marker for breast carcinoma but its sensitivity in primary genital extramammary Paget diseases (EMPDs) has not been well studied.
Here we investigated immunohistochemical expression of GATA3 in 72 primary genital EMPDs (35 from female, 37 from male; 45 with intraepithelial disease only, 26 with both intraepithelial disease and invasive adenocarcinoma including 14 also metastasis, 1 with metastatic adenocarcinoma only for study). We also compared GATA3 to gross cystic disease fluid protein 15 (GCDFP15) for their sensitivity.
Positive GATA3 staining was seen in all 71 (100%) intraepithelial diseases, 25/26 (96%; female 10/10, male 15/16) invasive adenocarcinomas and 14/15 (93%; female 3/3, male 11/12) metastatic adenocarcinomas, respectively. Positive GCDFP15 staining was seen in 46/71 (65%; female 28/34 or 82%, male 18/37 or 49%) intraepithelial diseases, 20/26 (77%; female 9/10, male 11/16) invasive adenocarcinomas, and 12/15 (80%; female 2/3, male 10/12) metastatic adenocarcinomas, respectively (GATA3 versus GCDFP15: p &lt; 0.01 for both intraepithelial disease and invasive adenocarcinoma, p = 0.28 for metastatic adenocarcinoma). In positive-stained cases, GATA3 stained more tumor cells than GCDFP15 (79% versus 25% for intraepithelial disease, 71% vs 34% for invasive adenocarcinoma, 73% vs 50% for metastatic adenocarcinoma, p &lt; 0.01 for all 3 components).
Our findings indicate that GATA3 is a very sensitive marker for primary genital EMPDs and is more sensitive than GCDFP15.
Imbalances in effector T cell functioning have been associated with a number of autoimmune diseases, including Hashimoto's thyroiditis (HT). Differentiation of effector T helper (Th) 1, Th2, Th17 and regulatory T cell (Treg) lymphocytes is regulated by transcription factors, including Th1-specific T box (T-bet), GATA binding protein-3 (GATA3), retinoid-related orphan receptor (ROR)-α and forkhead box P3 (FOXP3). This study aimed to investigate Th1/Th2, Th1/Treg, Th2/Treg and Th17/Treg balances at the level of these transcription factors.
This study took place between October 2015 and August 2016. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were collected from a control group of 40 healthy women recruited from the Zahedan University of Medical Sciences, Zahedan, Iran, and a patient group of 40 women with HT referred to the Hazrat Ali Asghar Hospital, Zahedan. Total ribonucleic acid extraction was performed and the gene expression of transcription factors was quantitated using a real-time polymerase chain reaction technique.
Expression of T-bet and GATA3 was significantly elevated, while FOXP3 expression was significantly diminished among HT patients in comparison with the controls (P = 0.03, 0.01 and 0.05, respectively). Expression of RORα was higher among HT patients, although this difference was not significant (P = 0.15). Expression of T-bet/FOXP3, GATA3/FOXP3 and RORα/FOXP3 ratios were increased among HT patients in comparison with the controls (P &lt;0.02, &lt;0.01 and &lt;0.01, respectively).
These results indicate that HT patients have imbalances in Th1/Treg, Th2/Treg and Th17/Treg lymphocytes at the level of the transcription factors, deviating towards Th1, Th2 and Th17 cells. Correction of these imbalances may therefore be therapeutic.
Recent advances have improved our ability to generate cardiomyocytes from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) and human embryonic stem cells (hESCs). However, our understanding of the transcriptional regulatory networks underlying early stages (ie, from mesoderm to cardiac mesoderm) of cardiomyocyte differentiation remains limited.
To characterize transcriptome and chromatin accessibility during early cardiomyocyte differentiation from hiPSCs and hESCs.
We profiled the temporal changes in transcriptome and chromatin accessibility at genome-wide levels during cardiomyocyte differentiation derived from 2 hiPSC lines and 2 hESC lines at 4 stages: pluripotent stem cells, mesoderm, cardiac mesoderm, and differentiated cardiomyocytes. Overall, RNA sequencing analysis revealed that transcriptomes during early cardiomyocyte differentiation were highly concordant between hiPSCs and hESCs, and clustering of 4 cell lines within each time point demonstrated that changes in genome-wide chromatin accessibility were similar across hiPSC and hESC cell lines. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) identified several modules that were strongly correlated with different stages of cardiomyocyte differentiation. Several novel genes were identified with high weighted connectivity within modules and exhibited coexpression patterns with other genes, including noncoding RNA LINC01124 and uncharacterized RNA AK127400 in the module related to the mesoderm stage; E-box-binding homeobox 1 (ZEB1) in the module correlated with postcardiac mesoderm. We further demonstrated that ZEB1 is required for early cardiomyocyte differentiation. In addition, based on integrative analysis of both WGCNA and transcription factor motif enrichment analysis, we determined numerous transcription factors likely to play important roles at different stages during cardiomyocyte differentiation, such as T and eomesodermin (EOMES; mesoderm), lymphoid enhancer-binding factor 1 (LEF1) and mesoderm posterior BHLH transcription factor 1 (MESP1; from mesoderm to cardiac mesoderm), meis homeobox 1 (MEIS1) and GATA-binding protein 4 (GATA4) (postcardiac mesoderm), JUN and FOS families, and MEIS2 (cardiomyocyte).
Both hiPSCs and hESCs share similar transcriptional regulatory mechanisms underlying early cardiac differentiation, and our results have revealed transcriptional regulatory networks and new factors (eg, ZEB1) controlling early stages of cardiomyocyte differentiation.
The enzyme 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase/isomerase (3β-HSD) is involved in the synthesis of active steroid hormones. Two human 3β-HSD isoforms are expressed in a tissue-specific pattern. HSD3B1 (type I) expression is essential to produce progesterone for pregnancy maintenance. To understand the mechanisms of human HSD3B1 activation in the placenta, 2.2 kb of 5'-flanking sequence and 5'-deletions were fused to the luciferase reporter gene and transfected into human JEG-3 cells. The proximal -238/+337 sequence had the highest promoter activity. Two GATA elements were identified at -106/-99 and -52/-45. Mutations of either sites greatly reduced promoter activity in JEG-3 cells, demonstrating the importance of GATA sites. EMSA revealed the specific binding of GATA2 and GATA3 to the GATA sequences at -106/-99 and -52/-45. ChIP assays demonstrated the association of GATA2 but not GATA3 with the GATA-binding regions of the HSD3B1 promoter in JEG-3 cells. GATA2 knockdown significantly reduced HSD3B1 expression in JEG-3 cells; however, GATA3 knockdown increased HSD3B1 expression. Western blot analysis revealed high levels of GATA2 but not GATA3 in human placental tissues. This study identified GATA motifs as essential control elements for HSD3B1 transcription and GATA2 as a novel transcriptional regulator of HSD3B1 expression in the human placenta.
Microarrays and RNA sequencing are widely used to profile transcriptome remodeling during myocardial ischemia. However, the steady-state RNA analysis lacks in sensitivity to detect all noncoding RNA species and does not provide separation between transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulations. Here, we provide the first comprehensive analysis of nascent RNA profiles of mRNAs, primary micro-RNAs, long noncoding RNAs, and enhancer RNAs in a large animal model of acute infarction.
Acute infarction was induced by cardiac catheterization of domestic swine. Nuclei isolated from healthy, border zone, and ischemic regions of the affected heart were subjected to global run-on sequencing. Global run-on sequencing analysis indicated that half of affected genes are regulated at the level of transcriptional pausing. A gradient of induction of inflammatory mediators and repression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor signaling and oxidative phosphorylation was detected when moving from healthy toward infarcted area. In addition, we interrogated the transcriptional regulation of primary micro-RNAs and provide evidence that several arrhythmia-related target genes exhibit repression at post-transcriptional level. We identified 450 long noncoding RNAs differently regulated by ischemia, including novel conserved long noncoding RNAs expressed in antisense orientation to myocardial transcription factors GATA-binding protein 4, GATA-binding protein 6, and Krüppel-like factor 6. Finally, characterization of enhancers exhibiting differential expression of enhancer RNAs pointed a central role for Krüppel-like factor, MEF2C, ETS, NFY, ATF, E2F2, and NRF1 transcription factors in determining transcriptional responses to ischemia.
Global run-on sequencing allowed us to follow the gradient of gene expression occurring in the ischemic heart and identify novel noncoding RNAs regulated by oxygen deprivation. These findings highlight potential new targets for diagnosis and treatment of myocardial ischemia.
Paclitaxel is a first-line microtubule-stabilizing drug in treating prostate cancer. However, most patients develop resistance and experience relapse. Morin (3,5,7,20,40-pentahydroxyflavone) is an anti-tumor flavonoid in a numerous types of cancer cells including breast, ovarian and lung cancers. We therefore researched the effects of morin as an adjuvant to paclitaxel in in treating DU145 and PC-3 cells in vitro and DU145 derived prostate cancers in nude mice models. The chemosensitivities of these cells to the treatments of morin and paclitaxel were tested through viability assays utilizing cell counting kit 8 (CCK-8) and apoptosis assays through flow cytometry analyses. MicroRNA (miRNA) microarray was employed to determine the changes in miRNA profile of morin treated DU145 cells. The results from microarrays were further certified by quantitative real-time reverse transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR). The underlying targets of miR-155 were verified using luciferase assays followed by Western blot assays. In the results, morin was capable of repressing the cell viabilities in the paclitaxel-treated cells. MiR-155might be an effective target that can be down-regulated in morin-treated cells. We also discovered that GATA binding protein 3 (GATA3) was directly repressed by miR-155, and the treatment of morin reversed the expression of GATA3. In conclusion, morin might be a potential adjuvant of paclitaxel in treating prostate cancer through regulating miR-155/GATA3 axis.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and emphysema are associated with increased elastin peptides (EP) production because of excessive breakdown of lung connective tissue. We recently reported that exposure of mice to EP elicited hallmark features of emphysema. EP effects are largely mediated through a receptor complex that includes the elastin-binding protein spliced-galactosidase (S-gal). In previous studies, we established a correlation between cytokine production and S-gal protein expression in EP-treated immune cells. In this study, we investigated the S-gal-dependent EP effects on T-helper (Th) and T-cytotoxic (Tc) responses during murine EP-triggered pulmonary inflammation. C57BL/6J mice were endotracheally instilled with the valine-glycine-valine-alanine-proline-glycine (VGVAPG) elastin peptide, and, 21 days after treatment, local and systemic T-lymphocyte phenotypes were analyzed at cytokine and transcription factor expression levels by multicolor flow cytometry. Exposure of mice to the VGVAPG peptide resulted in a significant increase in the proportion of the CD4+ and CD8+ T cells expressing the cytokines IFN-γ or IL-17a and the transcription factors T-box expressed in T cells or retinoic acid-related orphan receptor-γt (RORγt) without effects on IL-4 and Gata-binding protein 3 to DNA sequence [A/T]GATA[A/G] expression. These effects were maximized when each T-cell subpopulation was challenged ex vivo with EP, and they were inhibited in vivo when an analogous peptide antagonizing the EP/S-gal interactions was instilled together with the VGVAPG peptide. This study demonstrates that, during murine emphysema, EP-S-gal interactions contribute to a Th-1 and Th-17 proinflammatory T-cell response combined with a Tc-1 response. Our study also highlights the S-gal receptor as a putative pharmacological target to modulate such an immune response.
Chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (NP) (CRSwNP) is classified into eosinophilic and noneosinophilic types based on the level of tissue eosinophilia. The immunopathologic features of Western and Asian CRSwNP differ.
The aim of this study was to investigate the immunopathologic characteristics of Korean patients with eosinophilic NP versus noneosinophilic NP and those with atopic NP versus nonatopic NP.
Tissue samples were collected from 81 patients with NP and 24 controls. The clinical characteristics of all the patients were analyzed. Tissues were investigated for expression of chemical mediators, including interleukin (IL) 5, IL-10, IL-17, interferon-γ, and tumor growth factor-β1; transcription factors, including GATA binding protein 3 (GATA-3), forkhead box P3 (Foxp3), retinoic acid-related orphan receptor C (RORC), and T-box transcription factor (T-bet), and extracellular matrix, including collagen type I, fibronectin, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 1, and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) 9.
Although the clinical characteristics differed between eosinophilic and noneosinophilic NPs, atopic status did not affect the clinical findings of CRSwNP. Both T-helper 1 and 2 cytokines increased significantly in patients with eosinophilic NP, but atopic status did not affect the expression of any of the chemical mediators. GATA-3 messenger RNA (mRNA) expression increased significantly in patients with eosinophilic NP, and RORC mRNA expression increased significantly in patients with noneosinophilic NP. T-bet, RORC, and Foxp3 mRNA expression increased significantly in patients with nonatopic NP. Fibronectin and MMP-9 mRNA expression increased significantly in patients with noneosinophilic NP, whereas only MMP-9 mRNA increased significantly in patients with eosinophilic and those with noneosinophilic NP.
The immunopathologic characteristics differed between eosinophilic NP and noneosinophilic NP and between atopic NP and nonatopic NP. The different underlying pathogenic processes may influence the development of Korean NP.
β1- and β2-adrenergic receptors (ARs) regulate cardiac contractility, calcium handling and protein phosphorylation. The present study aimed to examine the expression levels of vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF‑A) and several G proteins, and the phosphorylation of transcription factor GATA binding protein 4 (GATA4), by western blot analysis, using isolated hearts from 6 month‑old transgenic (TG) mice that overexpress β1AR or β2AR. Cardiac contractility/relaxation and heart rate was increased in both β1AR TG and β2AR TG mouse hearts compared with wild type; however, no significant differences were observed between the β1‑ and β2AR TG mouse hearts. Protein expression levels of inhibitory guanine nucleotide‑binding protein (Gi) 2, Gi3 and G‑protein‑coupled receptor kinase 2 were upregulated in both TG mice, although the upregulation of Gi2 was more prominent in the β2AR TG mice. VEGF‑A expression levels were also increased in both TG mice, and were highest in the β1AR TG mice. In addition, the levels of phosphorylated‑GATA4 expression were increased in β1‑ and β2AR TG mice. In conclusion, the present study demonstrated that cardiac contractility/relaxation and heart rate is increased in β1AR TG and β2AR TG mice, and indicated that this increase may be related to the overexpression of G proteins and G‑protein‑associated proteins.
Transcription factor GATA4 regulates cardiac and osteoblast differentiation. However, its role in tooth development is not clear. Therefore, we generated Wnt1-Cre;GATA4 fl/fl mice, with conditional inactivation of the GATA4 gene in the dental papilla mesenchymal cells. Phenotypic analysis showed short root deformity along with reduced expressions of odonto/osteogenic markers. Proliferation (but not apoptosis) of cells around the apical area of the root was attenuated. In vitro, we knocked down GATA4 expression in stem cells of dental apical papilla (SCAPs). Proliferation, migration and odonto/osteogenic differentiation of SCAPs were affected in the shGATA4 group. Overexpression of GATA4 in SCAPs increased mineralization. Based on our previous iTRAQ results, guanine nucleotide binding proteins 3 (GNAI3) is one of the distinct proteins after GATA4 deletion. G protein signaling is involved in bone development, remodeling, and disease. In this study, both GATA4 deletion in the mouse root and knock-down in human SCAPs decreased the expression of GNAI3. Dual-luciferase and ChIP assay confirmed the direct binding of GATA4 to the GNAI3 promoter, both in vitro and in vivo. GNAI3 knock-down significantly decreased the odonto/osteogenic differentiation ability of SCAPs. We thus establish the role of GATA4 as a novel regulator of root development and elucidate its downstream molecular events.
Patterning of the small intestinal epithelium along its cephalocaudal axis establishes three functionally distinct regions: duodenum, jejunum, and ileum. Efficient nutrient assimilation and growth depend on the proper spatial patterning of specialized digestive and absorptive functions performed by duodenal, jejunal, and ileal enterocytes. When enterocyte function is disrupted by disease or injury, intestinal failure can occur. One approach to alleviate intestinal failure would be to restore lost enterocyte functions. The molecular mechanisms determining regionally defined enterocyte functions, however, are poorly delineated. We previously showed that GATA binding protein 4 (GATA4) is essential to define jejunal enterocytes. The goal of this study was to test the hypothesis that GATA4 is sufficient to confer jejunal identity within the intestinal epithelium.
To test this hypothesis, we generated a novel Gata4 conditional knock-in mouse line and expressed GATA4 in the ileum, where it is absent.
We found that GATA4-expressing ileum lost ileal identity. The global gene expression profile of GATA4-expressing ileal epithelium aligned more closely with jejunum and duodenum rather than ileum. Focusing on jejunal vs ileal identity, we defined sets of jejunal and ileal genes likely to be regulated directly by GATA4 to suppress ileal identity and promote jejunal identity. Furthermore, our study implicates GATA4 as a transcriptional repressor of fibroblast growth factor 15 (Fgf15), which encodes an enterokine that has been implicated in an increasing number of human diseases.
Overall, this study refines our understanding of an important GATA4-dependent molecular mechanism to pattern the intestinal epithelium along its cephalocaudal axis by elaborating on GATA4's function as a crucial dominant molecular determinant of jejunal enterocyte identity. Microarray data from this study have been deposited into NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo) and are accessible through GEO series accession number GSE75870.
Previous studies from this group demonstrated that insulin gene enhancer binding protein ISL-1 (Islet-1) specifically induces the differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) into cardiomyocyte‑like cells through histone acetylation. However, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. In the present study, the role of the histone acetylation and DNA methylation on the regulatory mechanism of the Islet‑1 was further investigated by methylation‑specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR), chromatin immunoprecipitation quantitative PCR and western blot analysis. The results demonstrated that Islet‑1 upregulated expression of general control of amino acid biosynthesis protein 5 (Gcn5) and enhanced the binding of Gcn5 to the promoters of GATA binding protein 4 (GATA4) and NK2 homeobox 5 (Nkx2.5). In addition, Islet-1 downregulated DNA methyltransferase (DNMT)‑1 expression and reduced its binding to the GATA4 promoter. In contrast, the amount of DNMT-1 binding on Nkx2.5 did not match the expression trend. Therefore, it was concluded that Islet‑1 may influence the histone acetylation and DNA methylation of GATA4 promoter region via Gcn5 and DNMT‑1 during the MSC differentiation into cardiomyocyte-like cells, thus prompting the expression of GATA4. The Nkx2.5 was likely only affected by histone acetylation instead of DNA methylation. The present study demonstrated that Islet‑1 induces the differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells into cardiomyocyte‑like cells through a specific interaction between histone acetylation and DNA methylation on regulating GATA4.
MNS16A, a functional polymorphic tandem repeat minisatellite, is located in the promoter region of an antisense transcript of the human telomerase reverse transcriptase gene. MNS16A promoter activity depends on the variable number of tandem repeats (VNTR) presenting varying numbers of transcription factor binding sites for GATA binding protein 1. Although MNS16A has been investigated in multiple cancer epidemiology studies with incongruent findings, functional data of only two VNTRs (VNTR-243 and VNTR-302) were available thus far, linking the shorter VNTR to higher promoter activity.For the first time, we investigated promoter activity of all six VNTRs of MNS16A in cell lines of colorectal, lung and prostate cancer using Luciferase reporter assay. In all investigated cell lines shorter VNTRs showed higher promoter activity. While this anticipated indirect linear relationship was affirmed for colorectal cancer SW480 (P = 0.006), a piecewise linear regression model provided significantly better model fit in lung cancer A-427 (P = 6.9 × 10-9) and prostate cancer LNCaP (P = 0.039). In silico search for transcription factor binding sites in MNS16A core repeat element suggested a higher degree of complexity involving X-box binding protein 1, general transcription factor II-I, and glucocorticoid receptor alpha in addition to GATA binding protein 1.Further functional studies in additional cancers are requested to extend our knowledge of MNS16A functionality uncovering potential cancer type-specific differences. Risk alleles may vary in different malignancies and their determination in vitro could be relevant for interpretation of genotype data.
Transcription factors (TFs) are proteins that bind to specific DNA sequences and regulate expression of genes. The molecular and genetic mechanisms in most patients with inherited platelet defects are unknown. There is now increasing evidence that mutations in hematopoietic TFs are an important underlying cause for defects in platelet production, morphology, and function. The hematopoietic TFs implicated in patients with impaired platelet function and number include runt-related transcription factor 1, Fli-1 proto-oncogene, E-twenty-six (ETS) transcription factor (friend leukemia integration 1), GATA-binding protein 1, growth factor independent 1B transcriptional repressor, ETS variant 6, ecotropic viral integration site 1, and homeobox A11. These TFs act in a combinatorial manner to bind sequence-specific DNA within promoter regions to regulate lineage-specific gene expression, either as activators or repressors. TF mutations induce rippling downstream effects by simultaneously altering the expression of multiple genes. Mutations involving these TFs affect diverse aspects of megakaryocyte biology, and platelet production and function, culminating in thrombocytopenia and platelet dysfunction. Some are associated with predisposition to hematologic malignancies. These TF variants may occur more frequently in patients with inherited platelet defects than generally appreciated. This review focuses on alterations in hematopoietic TFs in the pathobiology of inherited platelet defects.
The potential prognostic value of GATA binding protein 3 (GATA3) in breast cancer has recently increased, although the evidence is inconclusive. This meta-analysis of 10 articles involving 5,080 breast cancer patients explored the prognostic and clinicopathological value of GATA3 in breast cancer. Time to tumor progression (TTP) and overall survival (OS) were primary endpoints. Pooled hazard ratio (HR), pooled risk ratio (RR), and 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated to evaluate the association between GATA3, prognosis, and clinicopathological parameters. High GATA3 expression predicts breast cancer, with a HR (HR = 0.671; 95% CI = 0.475-0.947; P = 0.023) of TTP, but is not associated with OS (HR = 0.889; 95% CI = 0.789-1.001; P = 0.052). GATA3 overexpression is associated with positive ER (RR = 3.155; 95% CI = 1.680-5.923; P = 0.000), positive PR (RR = 3.949; 95% CI = 1.567-9.954, P = 0.004), lower nuclear grade (RR = 0.435; 95% CI = 0.369-0.514; P = 0.000), and smaller tumor size (RR = 0.816; 95% CI = 0.709-0.940; P = 0.005). High GATA3 expression may predict TTP in breast cancer, and such patients may show better clinicopathological features.
GATA binding factor 1 (GATA1) is a transcription factor essential for erythromegakaryocytic differentiation. Given its function in lineage specification, we sought to evaluate the immunohistochemical profile of GATA1 in normal marrow and acute leukemia and assess the use of GATA1 as a specific erythromegakaryocytic immunohistochemical marker.
Immunohistochemical studies for GATA1 expression were performed on bone marrow biopsy specimens to define its role in the evaluation of acute leukemia and other hematologic disorders.
In normal marrows, intense nuclear reactivity is seen in immature erythroid precursors and megakaryocytes. Weak to moderate nuclear positivity is seen in eosinophils and mast cells. In marrows involved by acute leukemia, blasts of pure erythroleukemia and acute megakaryoblastic leukemia exhibit intense nuclear GATA1 positivity, while blasts of acute myeloid leukemia of other categories are negative. GATA1 is also absent in the blasts of acute lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma and in the neoplastic cells of metastatic carcinoma and plasma cell neoplasms.
Intense GATA1 nuclear expression is a sensitive and specific marker for cells of erythroid and megakaryocytic lineages and is an excellent marker for neoplastic cells of pure erythroleukemia and acute megakaryoblastic leukemia.
GATA-binding protein 6 (GATA6), a highly-conserved transcription factor of the GATA family plays an important role in gonadal cell proliferation, differentiation and endoderm development. In this study, the full-length cDNA of GATA6 of Paralichthys olivaceus (Japanese flounder) was obtained. Phylogenetic, gene structure and synteny analyses demonstrated that GATA6 of P. olivaceus is homologous to that of teleosts and tetrapods. The P. olivaceus GATA6 transcript showed higher expression in testis than in ovary, demonstrating a sexually dimorphic gene expression. During embryonic development, the expression of P. olivaceus GATA6 increased at the blastula stage, demonstrating that GATA6 is involved in morphogenesis. Results of in situ hybridization showed that GATA6 signals were detected in Sertoli cells, oogonia and oocytes. Moreover, 17α methyl testosterone, a male hormone, could moderately upregulate P. olivaceus GATA6 and downregulate P. olivaceus aromatase CYP19A1 in testis cells. These results suggest that GATA6 may play an important role in gonadal development in P. olivaceus. This study provides valuable information on the function of P. olivaceus GATA6, laying the foundation for further development of breeding techniques in this species.
Objective To investigate the immunological effect of glycyrrhizic acid (GA) on MRL/lpr mice and its underlying mechanism. Methods The research included 10 wild type C57BL/6 mice and 40 MRL/lpr mice. MRL/lpr mice were randomly assigned to four groups: MRL/lpr control, MRL/lpr treated with dexamethasone (1.5 mg/kg), MRL/lpr treated with GA (20 mg/kg) and GA (40 mg/kg), 10 mice in each group. The serum levels of interleukin 4 (IL-4) and interferon-γ (IFN-γ) were tested by ELISA. The ratio of Th1/Th2 cell subsets in spleen was analyzed by flow cytometry. The protein levels of GATA-binding protein 3 (GATA3), T-bet, p-JAK3, JAK3, phosphorylated signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (p-STAT3), STAT3, p-NF-κBp65, NF-κBp65, p-IκBα, IκBα in spleen were detected by Western blot analysis. Results GA decreased serum levels of IL-4 and increased IFN-γ, modulated the balance of Th1/Th2 cell subsets in spleen markedly. GA inhibited the protein levels of GATA3, p-JAK3, p-STAT3, p-NF-κB, p-IκBα and increased T-bet protein in MRL/lpr mice. Conclusion Administration of GA can ameliorate the immune function in MRL/lpr mice.
Prostate cancer is the second leading cause of death from cancer among males in Western countries. It is also the most commonly diagnosed male cancer in Japan. The progression of prostate cancer is mainly influenced by androgens and the androgen receptor (AR). Androgen deprivation therapy is an established therapy for advanced prostate cancer; however, prostate cancers frequently develop resistance to low testosterone levels and progress to the fatal stage called castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Surprisingly, AR and the AR signaling pathway are still activated in most CRPC cases. To overcome this problem, abiraterone acetate and enzalutamide were introduced for the treatment of CRPC. Despite the impact of these drugs on prolonged survival, CRPC acquires further resistance to keep the AR pathway activated. Functional molecular studies have shown that some of the AR collaborative transcription factors (TFs), including octamer transcription factor (OCT1), GATA binding protein 2 (GATA2) and forkhead box A1 (FOXA1), still stimulate AR activity in the castration-resistant state. Therefore, elucidating the crosstalk between the AR and collaborative TFs on the AR pathway is critical for developing new strategies for the treatment of CRPC. Recently, many compounds targeting this pathway have been developed for treating CRPC. In this review, we summarize the AR signaling pathway in terms of AR collaborators and focus on pyrrole-imidazole (PI) polyamide as a candidate compound for the treatment of prostate cancer.
GATA binding protein 3 (GATA3) is indispensable in development of human organs. However, the role of GATA3 in cancers remains elusive. Hypoxia inducible factor (HIF)-1 plays an important role in pathogenesis of human cancers. Regulation of HIF-1α degradation is orchestrated through collaboration of its interacting proteins. In this study, we discover that GATA3 is upregulated in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) and is an independent predictor for poor disease-free survival. GATA3 promotes invasive behaviours of HNSCC and melanoma cells in vitro and in immunodeficient mice. Mechanistically, GATA3 physically associates with HIF-1α under hypoxia to inhibit ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of HIF-1α, which is independent of HIF-1α prolyl hydroxylation. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays show that the GATA3/HIF-1α complex binds to and regulates HIF-1 target genes, which is also supported by the microarray analysis. Notably, the GATA3-mediated invasiveness can be significantly reversed by HIF-1α knockdown, suggesting a critical role of HIF-1α in the underlying mechanism of GATA3-mediated effects. Our findings suggest that GATA3 stabilizes HIF-1α to enhance cancer invasiveness under hypoxia and support the GATA3/HIF-1α axis as a potential therapeutic target for cancer treatment.
Congenital atrial septal defect (ASD) and progressive atriventricular block (AVB) are the two most common phenotypes linked to NK2 homeobox 5 (NKX2.5) mutations in animals and humans. However, the prevalence and spectrum of NKX2.5 mutation in patients with ASD and AVB remain to be elucidated. In the present study, the coding exons and flanking introns of the NKX2.5 gene, which encodes a homeobox‑containing transcription factor essential for development of the heart, were sequenced in a cohort of 62 unrelated patients with ASD and AVB, and subsequently in a mutation carrier's available family members. As controls, 300 unrelated, ethnically‑matched healthy individuals were recruited, who were also genotyped for NKX2.5. The functional consequence of the mutant NKX2.5 was evaluated in contrast to its wild‑type counterpart using a dual‑luciferase reporter assay system. As a result, a novel heterozygous NKX2.5 mutation, p.Q181X, was identified in an index patient with ASD and AVB, with a prevalence of ~1.61%. Genetic analysis of the proband's pedigree revealed that the mutation co‑segregated with ASD and AVB with complete penetrance. The nonsense mutation, which eliminated partial homeobox and the carboxyl terminus, was absent in the 600 control chromosomes. Functional evaluation showed that the NKX2.5 mutant had no transcriptional activity. Furthermore, the mutation disrupted the synergistic activation between NKX2.5 and GATA binding protein 4, another cardiac core transcription factor associated with ASD. The results of the present study expand the spectrum of NKX2.5 mutations linked to ASD and AVB, and indicated that NKX2.5 loss‑of‑function mutations are an uncommon cause of ASD and AVB in humans.
Gallic acid, a natural chemical found in plants, has been reported to show antioxidant, anticancer, and anti-inflammatory effects. We investigated the efficacy of a short-term or long-term treatment with gallic acid in N-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME)-induced hypertensive mice and the underlying regulatory mechanism.
Hypertension was sufficiently induced after 2 weeks of L-NAME administration. Cardiac remodeling was assessed by echocardiography. Hypertrophic markers, transcription factors, and fibrosis-related gene expression were evaluated by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and western blotting.
Gallic acid effectively lowered SBP, regardless of the administration route (intraperitoneal or oral). L-NAME increased the left ventricular (LV) thickness without an increase in the total heart weight. Weekly echocardiography demonstrated that gallic acid significantly reduced LV posterior wall and septum thickness in chronic L-NAME mice from 3 to 7 weeks. The administration of gallic acid to mice showed a dual preventive and therapeutic effect on the L-NAME-induced LV remodeling. The effect was associated with the suppression of the gene expression of hypertrophy markers and the GATA-binding factor 6 (GATA6) transcription factor. Short-term or long-term treatment with gallic acid attenuated cardiac fibrosis and reduced the expression of histone deacetylase 1 and 2 in H9c2 cells and in rat primary cardiac fibroblasts, as well as in vivo. Small interfering RNA knockdown confirmed the association of these enzymes with L-NAME-induced cardiac remodeling and fibrosis.
These results suggested that gallic acid may be a potential therapeutic agent for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases with hypertension and cardiac fibrosis.
The transcription factor GATA-1-interacting protein Friend of GATA-1 (FOG1) is essential for proper transcriptional activation and repression of GATA-1 target genes; yet, the mechanisms by which FOG1 exerts its activating and repressing functions remain unknown. Forced FOG1 expression in human K562 erythroleukemia cells induced the expression of erythroid genes (SLC4A1, globins) but repressed that of GATA-2 and PU.1. A quantitative chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis demonstrated increased GATA-1 chromatin occupancy at both FOG1-activated as well as FOG1-repressed gene loci. However, while TAL1 chromatin occupancy was significantly increased at FOG1-activated gene loci, it was significantly decreased at FOG1-repressed gene loci. When FOG1 was overexpressed in TAL1-knocked down K562 cells, FOG1-mediated activation of HBA, HBG, and SLC4A1 was significantly compromised by TAL1 knockdown, suggesting that FOG1 may require TAL1 to activate GATA-1 target genes. Promoter analysis and quantitative ChIP analysis demonstrated that FOG1-mediated transcriptional repression of PU.1 would be mediated through a GATA-binding element located at its promoter, accompanied by significantly decreased H3 acetylation at lysine 4 and 9 (K4 and K9) as well as H3K4 trimethylation. Our results provide important mechanistic insight into the role of FOG1 in the regulation of GATA-1-regulated genes and suggest that FOG1 has an important role in inducing cells to differentiate toward the erythroid lineage rather than the myelo-lymphoid one by repressing the expression of PU.1.
GATA-binding protein 3 (GATA3) is a well-studied transcription factor found to be essential in the development of luminal breast epithelium and has been identified in a variety of tumour types, including breast and urothelial carcinomas, making it a useful immunohistochemistry marker in the diagnosis of both primary and metastatic disease.
We investigated GATA3 protein expression in a 106 primary triple-negative breast carcinomas (100 basal-like, six non-basal-like) using Cell Marque mouse monoclonal anti-GATA3 (L50-823). Reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) was used to quantify mRNA expression in 22 triple-negative breast cancers (TNBCs) (20 primary and two cell lines), four luminal (three primary and one cell line) and five human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) (four primary and one cell line) amplified tumours. In 98 TNBCs where IHC was assessable, 47 (48%) had a 1+ or greater staining with 20 (21%) having high GATA3 expression when using a weighted scoring.
Our study has demonstrated that GATA3 expression is common in primary triple-negative breast carcinomas. It also suggests that although GATA3 is an oestrogen receptor (ER) regulated gene, it still proves useful in differentiating between primary and metastatic tumours in patients with a history of breast cancer regardless of its molecular subtype.
The discovery of the GATA binding protein (GATA factor) transcription factor family revolutionized hematology. Studies of GATA proteins have yielded vital contributions to our understanding of how hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells develop from precursors, how progenitors generate red blood cells, how hemoglobin synthesis is regulated, and the molecular underpinnings of nonmalignant and malignant hematologic disorders. This thrilling journey began with mechanistic studies on a β-globin enhancer- and promoter-binding factor, GATA-1, the founding member of the GATA family. This work ushered in the cloning of related proteins, GATA-2-6, with distinct and/or overlapping expression patterns. Herein, we discuss how the hematopoietic GATA factors (GATA-1-3) function via a battery of mechanistic permutations, which can be GATA factor subtype, cell type, and locus specific. Understanding this intriguing protein family requires consideration of how the mechanistic permutations are amalgamated into circuits to orchestrate processes of interest to the hematologist and more broadly.
A clinicopathologic study with an emphasis on tumor immunohistochemical profile is presented.
Sixty-one cases of male invasive breast cancers were studied. Median age of the cohort was 65 years.
Ninety-seven percent were estrogen receptor positive+ and 10% human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 positive. The individual diagnostic marker positivity was 98% for GATA-binding protein 3, 95% for androgen receptor, 90% for progesterone receptor, 88% for deleted in pancreatic cancer 4, 75% for gross cystic disease fluid protein 15, 72% for cytokeratin 7, 55% for mammaglobin, and 15% for vimentin and Wilms tumor protein 1. Caudal type homeobox 2 protein, cytokeratin 20, Napsin A, paired box gene 8, prostate-specific antigen, thyroid transcription factor 1, and uroplakin II were negative in all cases. Survival analyses showed tumor stage, receptor status, and Nottingham prognostic index to be prognostic. The overall survival was 70%, but the breast cancer–specific survival was 92% (mean follow-up, 59 months); 33% developed second malignancy. The immunohistochemistry profile was similar to female breast cancers.
The second malignancies in this cohort affected overall survival and suggest the possibility of other germline mutations in addition to BRCA2 in male patients with breast cancer.
Heart failure often develops after acute myocardial infarction because the injured myocardial tissue fails to recover or regenerate. Stem cell transplantation using adult cell sources, such as adipose-derived stromal vascular fraction (SVF), draws extensive attention. In this study, SVF cells were isolated from rat adipose tissue and cultivated on enzyme-crosslinked gelatin hydrogels. Morphological features of cell development and spontaneous beating behavior from these cells were observed and recorded. Cardiac phenotypes were characterized via immunofluorescence staining, and the expression of cardiac-specific genes was measured via RT-PCR. The functional assessment of SVF-derived cardiomyocyte-like cells (SVF-CMs) was performed by detecting cellular calcium transient activities and pharmacological responses. Results showed that most SVF-CMs exhibited elongated myotubule shapes and expressed cardiac troponin I strongly. SVF-CMs expressed cardiac-specific RNA (including transcription factors GATA binding protein 4) and myocyte enhancer factor 2c, as well as the structural proteins, namely, sarcomere actinin alpha 2, cardiac troponin I type 3, cardiac troponin T type 2, and cardiac gap junction protein alpha 1. Their beating mode, calcium activities, and pharmacological responses were similar to those of native CMs. Spontaneously beating SVF-CMs can be derived from adipose tissue-derived SVFs, and enzyme-crosslinked gelatin hydrogel promoted the cardiac differentiation of SVF cells.
Congenital heart defects (CHDs), a wide variety of developmental abnormalities in the structures of the heart and the great thoracic blood vessels, are the most common form of birth defect in humans worldwide. CHDs are accountable for substantial morbidity and are still the leading cause of birth defect‑related deaths. Recent studies have demonstrated the pivotal roles of genetic defects in the pathogenesis of CHDs, and a great number of genetic mutations have been associated with CHDs. Nevertheless, CHDs are a genetically heterogeneous disorder and the genetic basis underlying CHDs in an overwhelming majority of cases remains unclear. In the present study, the coding exons and flanking introns of the heart and neural crest derivatives expressed transcript 1 (HAND1) gene, which encodes a basic helix‑loop‑helix transcription factor crucial for cardiovascular development, were sequenced in 158 unrelated patients with CHDs, and a de novo heterozygous mutation, p.K132X, was identified in a patient with double outlet right ventricle (DORV), as well as ventricular septal defect. The nonsense mutation, which was predicted to produce a truncated HAND1 protein lacking 84 carboxyl‑terminal amino acids, was absent in 600 control chromosomes. Functional analyses revealed that the HAND1 K132X mutant had no transcriptional activity. Furthermore, the mutation disrupted the synergistic activation between HAND1 and GATA binding protein 4 (GATA4), another cardiac core transcription factor causally linked to CHDs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on the association of HAND1 loss‑of‑function mutation with an enhanced susceptibility to DORV in humans. These findings expand the phenotypic spectrum linked to HAND1 mutations, suggesting potential implications for the development of novelo prophylactic and therapeutic strategies for DORV.
Identification of tissue- and stage-specific gene promoters is valuable for delineating the functional roles of specific genes in genetically engineered animals. Here, through the comparison of gene expression in different tissues by analysis of a microarray database, the intestinal specificity of mucin 2 (MUC2) expression was identified in mice and humans, and further confirmed in chickens by RT-PCR (reverse transcription-PCR) analysis. An analysis of cis-acting elements in avian MUC2 gene promoters revealed conservation of binding sites, within a 2.9 kb proximal promoter region, for transcription factors such as caudal type homeobox 2 (CDX2), GATA binding protein 4 (GATA4), hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 α (HNF4A), and transcription factor 4 (TCF4) that are important for maintaining intestinal homeostasis and functional integrity. By generating transgenic quail, we demonstrated that the 2.9 kb chicken MUC2 promoter could drive green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter expression exclusively in the small intestine, large intestine, and ceca. Fluorescence image analysis further revealed GFP expression in intestine epithelial cells. The GFP expression was barely detectable in the embryonic intestine, but increased during post-hatch development. The spatiotemporal expression pattern of the reporter gene confirmed that the 2.9 kb MUC2 promoter could retain the regulatory element to drive expression of target genes in intestinal tissues after hatching. This new transgene expression system, using the MUC2 promoter, will provide a new method of overexpressing target genes to study gene function in the avian intestine.
Cell-based therapies using self-beating cardiomyocytes have been attracting great attention for use in cardiac regeneration, although an effective procedure to improve cardiac differentiation and self-beating induction is required. The purpose of this study is to clarify the effect of the culture substrate on cardiac maturation by separately evaluating the cardiac differentiation step and the beating induction step in vitro. To this end, the well-studied cardiomyocyte-like progenitor cell line P19CL6 and neonatal cardiomyocytes (NCMs) were selected and cultured on substrates coated with collagen type I (Col-I), gelatin (Gel), fibronectin (FN), or poly-l-lysine (PLL). It was found that the cardiac differentiation step, which was assessed using cardiac marker gene expression (GATA-binding protein 4 (GATA4), myocyte-specific enhancer factor 2D (MEF2D), and hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated potassium channel 4 (HCN4)) in the P19CL6 embryonal carcinoma cells, was greatly enhanced on Col-I, Gel, and PLL. In contrast, the spontaneous beating step, which was directly assessed by counting the beating colonies and measuring contractile protein gene expression (α-myosin heavy chain (α-MHC), troponin C type 1 (TnC1), and troponin T type 2 (TnT2)) in the rat NCMs, was enhanced on the FN and PLL surfaces. In the present study, for the first time, it was found that PLL enhances both the cardiac differentiation and the beating induction steps of cardiac maturation, which can aid in preparing beating cardiomyocytes for regenerative medicine. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Transcription factor TEA domain family transcription factor 4 (Tead4) is one of the key factors involved in the differentiation of the trophectoderm (TE) in murine embryos. However, knowledge on the roles of TEAD4 in preimplantation development during bovine embryos is currently limited. This study examined the transcript and protein expression patterns of TEAD4 and attempted to elucidate the functions of TEAD4 during bovine preimplantation development using RNA interference. TEAD4 mRNA was found to be upregulated between the 16-cell and morula stages, and nuclear localization of the TEAD4 protein was detected at the morula stage, as well as in subsequent developmental stages. TEAD4 downregulation did not affect embryonic development until the blastocyst stage, and TEAD4-downregulated embryos were capable of forming the TE under both 5% and 21% O2 conditions. Results of gene expression analysis showed that TEAD4 downregulation did not affect the expression levels of POU class 5 transcription factor 1 (OCT-4), NANOG, caudal-type homeobox 2 (CDX2), GATA binding protein 3 (GATA3), and interferon-tau (IFNT). In conclusion, TEAD4 might be dispensable for development until the blastocyst stage and TE differentiation in bovine embryos.
Pluripotency is an important feature of cancer stem cells (CSCs) that contributes to self-renewal and chemoresistance. The maintenance of pluripotency of CSCs under various pathophysiological conditions requires a complex interaction between various cellular pathways including those involved in homeostasis and energy metabolism. However, the exact mechanisms that maintain the CSC pluripotency remain poorly understood. In this report, using both human and murine models of CSCs, we demonstrate that basal levels of autophagy are required to maintain the pluripotency of CSCs, and that this process is differentially regulated by the rate-limiting enzyme in the NAD+ synthesis pathway NAMPT (nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase) and the transcription factor POU5F1/OCT4 (POU class 5 homeobox 1). First, our data show that the pharmacological inhibition and knockdown (KD) of NAMPT or the KD of POU5F1 in human CSCs significantly decreased the expression of pluripotency markers POU5F1, NANOG (Nanog homeobox) and SOX2 (SRY-box 2), and upregulated the differentiation markers TUBB3 (tubulin β 3 class III), CSN2 (casein β), SPP1 (secreted phosphoprotein 1), GATA6 (GATA binding protein 6), T (T brachyury transcription factor) and CDX2 (caudal type homeobox 2). Interestingly, these pluripotency-regulating effects of NAMPT and POU5F1 were accompanied by contrasting levels of autophagy, wherein NAMPT KD promoted while POU5F1 KD inhibited the autophagy machinery. Most importantly, any deviation from the basal level of autophagy, either increase (via rapamycin, serum starvation or Tat-beclin 1 [Tat-BECN1] peptide) or decrease (via ATG7 or ATG12 KD), strongly decreased the pluripotency and promoted the differentiation and/or senescence of CSCs. Collectively, these results uncover the link between the NAD+ biosynthesis pathway, CSC transcription factor POU5F1 and pluripotency, and further identify autophagy as a novel regulator of pluripotency of CSCs.
Aberrant expression of the sodium channel gene (SCN5A) has been proposed to disrupt cardiac action potential and cause human cardiac arrhythmias, but the mechanisms of SCN5A gene regulation and dysregulation still remain largely unexplored. To gain insight into the transcriptional regulatory networks of SCN5A, we surveyed the promoter and first intronic regions of the SCN5A gene, predicting the presence of several binding sites for GATA transcription factors (TFs). Consistent with this prediction, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and sequential ChIP (Re-ChIP) assays show co-occupancy of cardiac GATA TFs GATA4 and GATA5 on promoter and intron 1 SCN5A regions in fresh-frozen human left ventricle samples. Gene reporter experiments show GATA4 and GATA5 synergism in the activation of the SCN5A promoter, and its dependence on predicted GATA binding sites. GATA4 and GATA6 mRNAs are robustly expressed in fresh-frozen human left ventricle samples as measured by highly sensitive droplet digital PCR (ddPCR). GATA5 mRNA is marginally but still clearly detected in the same samples. Importantly, GATA4 mRNA levels are strongly and positively correlated with SCN5A transcript levels in the human heart. Together, our findings uncover a novel mechanism of GATA TFs in the regulation of the SCN5A gene in human heart tissue. Our studies suggest that GATA5 but especially GATA4 are main contributors to SCN5A gene expression, thus providing a new paradigm of SCN5A expression regulation that may shed new light into the understanding of cardiac disease.
Endometriosis, the hormone-dependent extrauterine dissemination of endometrial tissue outside the uterus, affects 5-15% of women of reproductive age. Pathogenesis remains poorly understood as well as the estrogen production by endometriotic tissue yielding autocrine growth. Estrogens (E2) are normally produced by the ovaries. We investigated whether aberrant "ovarian-like" differentiation occurred in endometriosis. 69 women, with (n = 38) and without (n = 31) histologically proven endometriosis were recruited. Comparative RT-qPCR was performed on 20 genes in paired eutopic and ectopic lesions, together with immunohistochemistry. Functional studies were performed in primary cultures of epithelial endometriotic cells (EEC). A broaden ovarian-like differentiation was found in half eutopic and all ectopic endometriosis with aberrant expression of transcripts and protein for the transcription factors GATA4 and GATA6 triggering ovarian differentiation, for the FSH receptor (FSHR) and the ovarian hormone INSL3. Like in ovaries the FSHR induced aromatase, the key enzyme in E2 production, and vascular factors in EEC. The LH receptor (LHR) was also aberrantly expressed in a subset of ectopic endometriosis (21%) and induced strongly androgen-synthesizing enzymes and INSL3 in EEC, as in ovaries, as well as endometriotic cell growth. The ERK pathway mediates signaling by both hormones. A positive feedback loop occurred through FSHR and LHR-dependent induction of GATA4/6 in EEC, as in ovaries, enhancing the production of the steroidogenic cascade. This work highlights a novel pathophysiological mechanism with a broadly ovarian pattern of differentiation in half eutopic and all ectopic endometriosis. This study provides new tools that might improve the diagnosis of endometriosis in the future.
Vasohibin 2 (VASH2) is identified as an angiogenic factor, and has been implicated in tumor angiogenesis, proliferation and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). To investigate the EMT role of VASH2 in breast cancer, we overexpressed or knocked down expression of VASH2 in human breast cancer cell lines. We observed that VASH2 induced EMT in vitro and in vivo. The transforming growth factor β1 (TGFβ1) pathway was activated by VASH2, and expression of a dominant negative TGFβ type II receptor could block VASH2-mediated EMT. In clinical breast cancer tissues VASH2 positively correlated with TGFβ1 expression, but negatively correlated with E-cadherin (a marker of EMT) expression. Under hypoxic conditions in vitro or in vivo, we found that down-regulation of estrogen receptor 1 (ESR1) in VASH2 overexpressing ESR1 positive cells suppressed E-cadherin. Correlation coefficient analysis indicated that VASH2 and ESR1 expression were negatively correlated in clinical human breast cancer tissues. Further study revealed that a transcription factor of ESR1, GATA-binding factor 3 (GATA3), was down-regulated by VASH2 under hypoxia or in vivo. These findings suggest that VASH2 drives breast cancer cells to undergo EMT by activation of the TGFβ1 pathway and hypoxia dependent repression GATA3-ESR1 pathway, leading to cancer metastasis.
Allergic asthma is a worldwide increasing chronic disease of the airways which affects more than 300 million people. It is associated with increased IgE, mast cell activation, airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR), mucus overproduction and remodeling of the airways. Previously, this pathological trait has been associated with T helper type 2 (Th2) cells. Recently, different CD4+ T cell subsets (Th17, Th9) as well as cells of innate immunity, like mast cells and innate lymphoid cells type 2 (ILC2s), which are all capable of producing the rediscovered cytokine IL-9, are known to contribute to this disease. Regarding Th9 cells, it is known that naïve T cells develop into IL-9-producing cells in the presence of interleukin-4 (IL-4) and transforming growth factor beta (TGFβ). Downstream of IL-4, several transcription factors like signal transducer and activator of transcription 6 (STAT6), interferon regulatory factor 4 (IRF4), GATA binding protein 3 (GATA3), basic leucine zipper transcription factor, ATF-like (BATF) and nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) are activated. Additionally, the transcription factor PU.1, which is downstream of TGFβ signaling, also seems to be crucial in the development of Th9 cells. IL-9 is a pleiotropic cytokine that influences various distinct functions of different target cells such as T cells, B cells, mast cells and airway epithelial cells by activating STAT1, STAT3 and STAT5. Because of its pleiotropic functions, IL-9 has been demonstrated to be involved in several diseases, such as cancer, autoimmunity and other pathogen-mediated immune-regulated diseases. In this review, we focus on the role of Th9 and IL-9-producing cells in allergic asthma.
Estrogen is reported to be involved in thrombopoiesis and the disruption of its signaling may cause myeloproliferative disease, yet the underlying mechanisms remain largely unknown. GATA-binding factor 1 (GATA1) is a key regulator of megakaryocyte (MK) differentiation and its deficiency will lead to megakaryoblastic leukemia. Here we show that estrogen can dose-dependently promote MK polyploidization and maturation via activation of estrogen receptor beta (ERβ), accompanied by a significant upregulation of GATA1. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and a dual luciferase assay demonstrate that ERβ can directly bind the promoter region of GATA1 and activate its transcription. Steroid receptor coactivator 3 (SRC3) is involved in ERβ-mediated GATA1 transcription. The deficiency of ERβ or SRC3, similar to the inhibition of GATA1, leads to the impediment of estrogen-induced MK polyploidization and platelet production. Further investigations reveal that signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 signaling pathway downstream of GATA1 has a crucial role in estrogen-induced MK polyploidization, and ERβ-mediated GATA1 upregulation subsequently enhances nuclear factor erythroid-derived 2 expression, thereby promoting proplatelet formation and platelet release. Our study provides a deep insight into the molecular mechanisms of estrogen signaling in regulating thrombopoiesis and the pathogenesis of ER deficiency-related leukemia.
Recently, interest in the beneficial role of probiotics in the protection and management of allergic diseases caused by immune disorders has been increasing. This study investigated the inhibitory effect of Lactobacillus plantarum L67 on induced allergic inflammatory response in bisphenol A-treated rat basophilic leukemia 2H3 (RBL-2H3) cells and mouse splenocytes. We also evaluated the applicability of L. plantarum L67 as a yogurt starter culture. We measured the ability of Lactobacillus strains to induce the production of IL-12 and IFN- γ in cultured splenocytes by ELISA. Bisphenol A (50μM)-treated RBL-2H3 cells were cotreated with a glycoprotein (18kDa) isolated from L. plantarum L67 (5-100µg/mL) for 30min. We measured the expression of mitogen-activated protein kinase (ERK and p38), AP-1 (c-Fos and c-Jun), T-bet, and GATA-binding protein 3 (GATA-3) using Western blotting to examine the differentiation of T helper cells. Furthermore, we evaluated the gene expression of IL-1β, IL-6, and IL-10 using real-time quantitative PCR. Finally, we evaluated the applicability of L. plantarum L67 as a yogurt starter by measuring pH, enumeration of bacteria, and sensory scores. Our results showed that L67 protein inhibited the phosphorylation of ERK and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase through the transcriptional activation of AP-1 in bisphenol A-treated RBL-2H3 cells. During differentiation of T helper cells, the expression of transcription factor GATA-3 was significantly suppressed by L67 protein (100µg/mL) treatment, whereas expression of transcription factor T-bet was increased. In addition, the L67 protein significantly attenuated the expression of T helper 2-linked cytokines IL-1β, IL-6, and IL-10. These results indicate that L. plantarum L67, made available as yogurt starters and dietary supplements, has the potential to prevent allergy-related immune disorders.
Current understanding of adaptive immune, particularly T cell, responses to human rhinoviruses (RV) is limited. Memory T cells are thought to be of a primarily T helper 1 type, but both T helper 1 and T helper 2 memory cells have been described, and heightened T helper 2/ lessened T helper 1 responses have been associated with increased RV-induced asthma exacerbation severity. We examined the contribution of T helper 1 cells to RV-induced airways inflammation using mice deficient in the transcription factor T-Box Expressed In T Cells (Tbet), a critical controller of T helper 1 cell differentiation. Using flow cytometry we showed that Tbet deficient mice lacked the T helper 1 response of wild type mice and instead developed mixed T helper 2/T helper 17 responses to RV infection, evidenced by increased numbers of GATA binding protein 3 (GATA-3) and RAR-related orphan receptor gamma t (RORγt), and interleukin-13 and interleukin-17A expressing CD4+ T cells in the lung. Forkhead box P3 (FOXP3) and interleukin-10 expressing T cell numbers were unaffected. Tbet deficient mice also displayed deficiencies in lung Natural Killer, Natural Killer T cell and γδT cell responses, and serum neutralising antibody responses. Tbet deficient mice exhibited pronounced airways eosinophilia and mucus production in response to RV infection that, by utilising a CD4+ cell depleting antibody, were found to be T helper cell dependent. RV induction of T helper 2 and T helper 17 responses may therefore have an important role in directly driving features of allergic airways disease such as eosinophilia and mucus hypersecretion during asthma exacerbations.
Little is known about the aminopeptidase CD13 in renal neoplasia according to the new 2016 World Health Organization renal tumor classification. We selected 175 cases, including 79 clear cell, 31 papillary, 24 chromophobe, 8 clear cell papillary renal cell carcinomas (RCCs), 21 oncoytomas, and 12 microphthalmia transcription factor family translocation RCCs: 4 t(6;11)/transcription factor EB (TFEB), 7 t(Xp11) with 2 cystic variants and 1 t(X;17). GATA binding protein 3 (GATA-3) was inserted as control. Expression of proximal antigen CD13 was observed in 63/79 (80%) clear cell, 25/31 (81%) papillary, 3/8 (37%) clear cell papillary, 1/4 (25%) t(6;11)/TFEB, 2/7 (28%) cystic t(Xp11), and in 1/1 t(X;17) RCCs. All chromophobe RCC (0/24) and all oncocytomas (0/21) resulted negative. CD10 was seen in 76/79 (96%) clear cell, 15/31 (48%) papillary, 10/24 (42%) chromophobe, 1/8 (12%) clear cell papillary RCCs, 4/21 (19%) oncocytomas, 1/4 (25%) t(6;11)/TFEB, 2/7 (29%) cystic t(Xp11), and in 1/1 t(X;17) RCCs. GATA-3 was positive in 3/7 (42%) clear cell papillary RCCs and negative in all remaining RCCs, except a single chromophobe RCC and a single oncocytoma. We concluded that: (1) CD13 and GATA-3 immunostains may serve as a diagnostic aid in differentiating subtypes of RCC; (2) CD13 is always absent in chromophobe RCC and oncocytomas, whereas CD10 can be immunoexpressed in both; (3) CD13 should be included in a panel of antibodies to distinguish "proximal renal tumors" from "distal renal tumors" and between clear cell RCC versus microphthalmia transcription factor family translocations RCCs; and (4) when present, GATA-3 is specific for clear cell papillary RCC.
It is believed that excess androgen exposure of the fetus, via altered gene expression, causes hyperandrogenism a key feature of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). The aim of this study was to evaluate expression of Cytochrome P450-17 (CYP17), GATA-binding protein (GAGT6) and Steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR), genes of adult female rats prenatally exposed to androgen excess, closely reflect endocrine and ovarian disturbances of PCOS in women, by comparing them during different phases of estrus cycle with those of non-treated rats. Both the adult prenatally testosterone exposed and control rats (n=23, each) were divided into four groups based on their observed vaginal smear (proestrus, estrus, metestrus and diestrus) and the relative expression of CYP17, GATA6 and StAR genes was measured in ovarian theca cells using Cyber-green Real-Time PCR. Serum sex steroid hormones and gonadotropins levels were measured using the ELISA method; a comparison of these two groups showed that there was an overall increase in the studied genes (CYP17; 2.39 fold change, 95% CI: 1.23-3.55; P&lt;0.05, GATA6; 2.08 fold change, 95% CI: 1.62-2.55; P&lt;0.0001, and StAR; 1.4 fold change, 95% CI: 1.02-1.78; P&lt;0.05), despite variations in different phases with maximum elevation for all genes in diestrus. The changes observed may impair the normal development of ovaries that mediate the programming of adult PCOS. 
Rabbitfish Siganus canaliculatus was the first marine teleost demonstrated to have the capability of biosynthesizing long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFA) from C18 precursors, and to possess a Δ4 fatty acyl desaturase (Δ4 Fad) which was the first report in vertebrates, and is a good model for studying the regulatory mechanisms of LC-PUFA biosynthesis in teleosts. In order to understand regulatory mechanisms of transcription of Δ4 Fad, the gene promoter was cloned and characterized in the present study. An upstream sequence of 1859 bp from the initiation codon ATG was cloned as the promoter candidate. On the basis of bioinformatic analysis, several binding sites of transcription factors (TF) including GATA binding protein 2 (GATA-2), CCAAT enhancer binding protein (C/EBP), nuclear factor 1 (NF-1), nuclear factor Y (NF-Y), hepatocyte nuclear factor 4α (HNF4α) and sterol regulatory element (SRE), were identified in the promoter by site-directed mutation and functional assays. HNF4α and NF-1 were confirmed to interact with the core promoter of Δ4 Fad by gel shift assay and mass spectrometry. Moreover, over-expression of HNF4α increased promoter activity in HEK 293T cells and mRNA level of Δ4 Fad in rabbitfish primary hepatocytes, respectively. The results indicated that HNF4α is a TF of rabbitfish Δ4 Fad. To our knowledge, this is the first report on promoter structure of a Δ4 Fad, and also the first demonstration of HNF4α as a TF of vertebrate Fad gene involved in transcription regulation of LC-PUFA biosynthesis. 
Transcription factors (TFs) are proteins that bind to specific DNA sequences and regulate expression of genes. The molecular and genetic mechanisms in most patients with inherited platelet dysfunction are unknown. There is now increasing evidence that mutations in hematopoietic TFs are an important underlying cause for the defects in platelet production, morphology, and function. The hematopoietic TFs implicated in the patients with impaired platelet function include Runt related TF 1 (RUNX1), Fli-1 proto-oncogene, ETS TF (FLI1), GATA-binding protein 1 (GATA1), and growth factor independent 1B transcriptional repressor (GFI1B). These TFs act in a combinatorial manner to bind sequence-specific DNA within a promoter region to regulate lineage-specific gene expression, either as activators or as repressors. TF mutations induce rippling downstream effects by simultaneously altering the expression of multiple genes. Mutations involving these TFs affect diverse aspects of megakaryocyte biology and platelet production and function, culminating in thrombocytopenia, platelet dysfunction, and associated clinical features. Mutations in TFs may occur more frequently in the patients with inherited platelet dysfunction than generally appreciated. This review focuses on the alterations in hematopoietic TFs in the pathobiology of inherited platelet dysfunction.
Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most lethal cancers worldwide. Mutations in KRAS occur with the frequency of 30-50% in CRC leading to decreased therapeutic response to anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) agents. Recently GATA2 was proven to be essential in the survival of KRAS mutant non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells. However, the association between KRAS mutation and GATA2 expression in CRC remains largely unknown. In the present study, dideoxy sequencing and immunohistochemistry were used to determine KRAS mutation and GATA2 expression, respectively, in a cohort of 236 patients. Cox proportional hazard regression and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis were performed to study the association between KRAS mutation or GATA2 expression and clinical outcomes. Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed that KRAS mutant patients with high expression of GATA2 had significantly worse long-term clinical outcomes than those with low expression of GATA2 (P&lt;0.001). Further analysis showed that patients with both KRAS mutation and high GATA2 expression experienced significantly more unfavorable 5-year outcomes than patients with wild- type KRAS and low GATA2 expression (P=0.001). Univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression demonstrated the GATA2 expression level was an independent risk factor for overall survival of CRC patients (HR 1.645; 95% CI 1.004-2.696; P=0.048). In conclusion, the results of this study demonstrated that high expression of GATA2 is correlated with worse survival outcomes in KRAS mutant CRC patients, suggesting that GATA2 may serve as a novel biomarker for the survival of CRC patients harboring KRAS mutation. 
Thymol and carvacrol, two main components of thyme, have several valuable effects on the immune system. This study aims to evaluate the effects of these components on T-helper (TH) cell responses and their subsets in mice immunized with ovalbumin. The effects of these components on: a specific in vivo immune response were evaluated by assessing changes in delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH); ex vivo splenocyte proliferative responses were evaluated using a BrdU assay gene expression of cytokines and key transcription factors involved in T-cells subset differentiation among the mouse splenocytes were assessed using real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR); and splenocyte cytokine formation (ex vivo) and levels of the cytokines in mouse sera were measured by ELISA. Mice treated with thymol or carvacrol had reduced DTH responses (26% and 50%, respectively) compared with control mice. Thymol and carvacrol each diminished splenocyte proliferation to nearly 65-72% of control levels (p &lt; 0.01). These agents also led to decreased TH1 [interleukin (IL)-2, interferon (IFN)-γ)], TH2 (IL-4) and TH17 (IL-17A) levels in the splenocyte cultures and in the sera of mice but increased levels of IL-10 and transforming growth factor (TGF)-β. Treated immunized mice showed significantly reduced T-box 21 (T-bet) expression from 3.8 [± 0.3]-fold in untreated ovalbumin-immunized mice to 0.9 [± 0.4]-(thymol) and 0.8 [± 0.2]-fold (carvacrol) (p &lt; 0.01). GATA binding protein 3 (GATA-3) expression declined from 3.4 [± 0.4]- to 0.5 [± 0.3]-fold (thymol) and 0.6 [± 0.4]-fold (carvacrol), whereas RORγc decreased from 13.4 [± 1.6]- to 1.5 [± 0.6]-fold (thymol) and 0.8 [± 0.4]-fold (carvacrol) (p &lt; 0.001). As carvacrol and thymol each suppressed the antigen-specific immune response by reducing TH cell-related cytokines\specific transcription factors, this indicated their potential to modulate destructive immune responses attributed to T-cells over-activation.
Gonadotrope cell identity genes emerge in a stepwise process during mouse pituitary development. Cga, encoding for the α-subunit of TSH, LH, and FSH, is initially detected at E11.5 followed by Gnrhr and steroidogenic factor Sf1 at E13.5, specifying cells engaged in a gonadotrope cell fate. Lhb and Fshb appear at E16.5 and 17.5, respectively, typifying differentiated gonadotrope cells. Using the αT1-1, αT3-1 and LβT2 cell lines recapitulating these stages of gonadotrope differentiation, DNA methylation at Gnrhr and Sf1 was investigated. Regulatory regions were found hypermethylated in progenitor αT1-1 cells and hypomethylated in differentiated LβT2 cells. Abundance of RNA polymerase II together with active histone modifications including H3K4me1, H3K4me3, and H3K27ac were strictly correlated with DNA hypomethylation. Analyses of epigenomic modifications and chromatin accessibility were further extended to Isl1, Lhx3, Gata2, and Pitx2, highlighting alternative usages of specific regulatory gene domains in progenitor αT1-1, immature αT3-1, and mature LβT2 gonadotrope cells.
Common variants in the gene GATA binding protein 4 (GATA4) show association with alcohol dependence (AD). The aim of this study was to identify rare variants in GATA4 in order to elucidate the role of this gene in AD susceptibility. Identification of rare variants may provide a more complete picture of the allelic architecture at this risk locus.
Sanger sequencing of all 6 coding exons of GATA4 was performed in 528 patients and 517 controls. Four in silico prediction tools were used to determine the effect of a DNA variant on the amino acid sequence and protein function. Five variants were included in the replication step. Of these, 4 were successfully genotyped in our replication cohort of 655 patients and 1,501 controls. All patients fulfilled DSM-IV criteria for AD, and all individuals were of German descent.
In the discovery step, 19 different heterozygous variants were identified. Four patient-specific and potentially functionally relevant variants were followed up. Only the variant S379S (c.1137C&gt;T) remained patient specific (1/1,166 patients vs. 0/1,997 controls). None of the variants showed a statistically significant association with AD.
The present study elucidated the role of GATA4 in AD susceptibility by identifying rare variants via Sanger sequencing and subsequent replication. Although novel patient-specific rare variants of GATA4 were identified, none received support in the independent replication step. However, given previous robust findings of association with common variants, GATA4 remains a promising candidate gene for AD.
The present study aimed to explore the effects of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection on the expression of transcription factor GATA binding protein 3 (GATA-3) and connexin 32 (Cx32) in cultured gastric mucosa cells, and their association with each other. GES-1 cells were co-cultured with East Asian type cytotoxin-associated gene A+ H. pylori in the H. pylori group, and without H. pylori culture in the control group. Additionally, Mongolian gerbils were gavaged with H. pylori, and later the gastric antrum tissues were collected. The GATA-3 and Cx32 mRNA and protein expression levels were detected by a reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blot analysis, respectively. The scratch labeling fluorescent dye tracer (SLDT) technique was used to detect the gap junctional intercellular communication (GJIC) function. GATA-3 small interfering RNA (siRNA) was transfected into BGC823 cells and its effect on Cx32 expression levels was detected. The impact of GATA-3 on Cx32 promoter transcriptional activity was detected using a dual luciferase reporter assay. The results revealed that H. pylori infection increased GATA-3 expression and decreased Cx32 expression in GES-1 cells and in animal gastric tissues compared with their respective controls, whilst in BGC823 cells, GATA-3 siRNA increased Cx32 expression compared with the control. In the SLDT experiment of GES-1 cells with H. pylori infection, the fluorescent dye was primarily limited to a single cell row close to the scratch, and only a limited amount of dye passing to the second cell row, indicating that the GJIC function was substantially reduced or absent compared with the control group, where the fluorescence dye transferred to the neighboring cells of 3-4 rows, indicating a stronger GJIC function comparatively. GATA-3 inhibited the expression of the luciferase reporter gene, compared with the controls, suggesting that GATA-3 inhibited the expression of Cx32 by binding to Cx32 promoter sites. These results indicated that H. pylori-increased GATA-3 expression, which downregulated Cx32 expression, may serve an important function in gastric carcinogenesis, and GATA-3 siRNA may serve a function in the prevention and treatment of gastric cancer.
Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) increases the risk of death in chronic kidney disease (CKD). The transcription factor Kruppel-like factor 15 (KLF15) is expressed in the heart and regulates cardiac remodelling through inhibition of hypertrophy and fibrosis. It is unknown if KLF15 expression is changed in CKD induced LVH, or whether expression is modulated by blood pressure reduction using angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition.
CKD was induced in Sprague-Dawley rats by subtotal nephrectomy (STNx), and rats received vehicle (n = 10) or ACE inhibition (ramipril, 1 mg/kg/day, n = 10) for 4 weeks. Control, sham-operated rats (n = 9) received vehicle. Cardiac structure and function and expression of KLF15 were assessed.
STNx caused impaired kidney function (P &lt; 0.001), hypertension (P &lt; 0.01), LVH (P &lt; 0.001) and fibrosis (P &lt; 0.05). LVH was associated with increased gene expression of hypertrophic markers, atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), brain natriuretic peptide (BNP, P &lt; 0.01) and connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) (P &lt; 0.05). Cardiac KLF15 mRNA and protein expression were reduced (P &lt; 0.05) in STNx and levels of the transcription regulator, GATA binding protein 4 were increased (P &lt; 0.05). Ramipril reduced blood pressure (P &lt; 0.001), LVH (P &lt; 0.001) and fibrosis (P &lt; 0.05), and increased cardiac KLF15 gene (P &lt; 0.05) and protein levels (P &lt; 0.01). This was associated with reduced ANP, BNP and CTGF mRNA (all P &lt; 0.05).
This is the first evidence that loss of cardiac KLF15 in CKD induced LVH is associated with unchecked trophic and fibrotic signalling, and that ACE inhibition ameliorates loss of cardiac KLF15.
Clioquinol was used in the mid-1900s as an amebicide to treat indigestion and diarrhea. However, it was withdrawn from the market in Japan because it was linked to subacute myelo-optic neuropathy (SMON). The pathogenesis of SMON has not yet been elucidated in detail. As reported previously, we performed a global analysis on human neuroblastoma cells using DNA chips. The global analysis and quantitative PCR demonstrated that the mRNA level of interleukin-8 (IL-8) was significantly increased when SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells were treated with clioquinol. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay also demonstrated that clioquinol induced the secretion of IL-8 into culture media. Promoter analyses on SH-SY5Y cells revealed that a region responsive to clioquinol exists between -152 and -144 of the human IL-8 gene, which contains a consensus GATA-binding site sequence. The introduction of mutations at this site or the activator protein (AP)-1 site sequence at -126/-120 significantly reduced clioquinol-induced transcriptional activation. Among the GATA transcription factors expressed in SH-SY5Y cells, GATA-2 and GATA-3 protein levels were significantly decreased by the addition of clioquinol. Electrophoresis mobility shift assays using a probe corresponding to -159/-113 of the human IL-8 gene revealed two major shifted bands, one of which was increased and the other was decreased by clioquinol. The introduction of mutations showed that the former corresponded to binding to the AP-1 site, and the latter to binding to the GATA site. Supershift analyses revealed that the binding of c-Jun and c-Fos was increased, whereas that of GATA-3 was decreased by clioquinol. Genome editing against GATA-2 or GATA-3, not GATA-4 significantly enhanced clioquinol-induced IL-8 mRNA expression. On the other hand, the stable expression of GATA-2 or GATA-3 attenuated clioquinol-induced IL-8 mRNA expression and IL-8 secretion. These results suggest that the clioquinol-induced suppression of GATA-2 and GATA-3 expression mediates the up-regulation of IL-8.
Recent studies suggest that the commensal microbiota affects not only host energy metabolism and development of immunity but also bone remodeling by positive regulation of osteoclast activity. However, the mechanism of regulation of bone cells by the commensal microbiota has not been elucidated. In this study, 8-week-old specific pathogen-free (SPF) and germ-free (GF) mice were compared in terms of alveolar bones and primary osteoblasts isolated from calvarias. Micro-CT analysis showed that SPF mice had larger body size associated with lower bone mineral density and bone volume fraction in alveolar bones compared with GF mice. Greater numbers of osteoclasts in alveolar bone and higher serum levels of tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase 5b were observed in SPF mice. Tissue extracts from SPF alveolar bone showed higher levels of cathepsin K, indicating higher osteoclast activity. SPF alveolar extracts also showed elevated levels of &amp;gamma;-carboxylated glutamic acid⁻osteocalcin as a marker of mature osteoblasts compared with GF mice. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) array analysis of RNA directly isolated from alveolar bone showed that in SPF mice, expression of mRNA of osteocalcin, which also acts as an inhibitor of bone mineralization, was strongly enhanced compared with GF mice. Cultured calvarial osteoblasts from SPF mice showed reduced mineralization but significantly enhanced expression of mRNAs of osteocalcin, alkaline phosphatase, insulin-like growth factor-I/II, and decreased ratio of osteoprotegerin/receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappa B ligand compared with GF mice. Furthermore, PCR array analyses of transcription factors in cultured calvarial osteoblasts showed strongly upregulated expression of Forkhead box g1. In contrast, Gata-binding protein 3 was strongly downregulated in SPF osteoblasts. These results suggest that the commensal microbiota prevents excessive mineralization possibly by stimulating osteocalcin expression in osteoblasts, and enhances both osteoblast and osteoclast activity by regulating specific transcription factors.
To explore the role of Pim-1 in the pathology of inflammatory bowel disease and the potential effect of Pim-1 inhibitor on treating such disease.  Methods: Forty-five BALB/c mice were randomly divided into 5 groups (n=9): A normal control group, a inflammatory bowel disease group, two different dose of Pim-1 inhibitor treatment groups, and steroidhormone treatment group. The model of inflammatory bowel disease was induced by intracolonic administration of 2, 4, 6-trinitrobenzenestdfonic acid (TNBS) and ethanol mixture. Mice were treated with Pim-1 inhibitor [intraperitoneal inject, 5 or 10 mg/(kg.d)] for 5 days and prednisone (intragastric administration, 0.1 mg/d) for 5 days. The DAI, colon length, gross score and pathological grade were evaluated. The expressions of T cell master transcription factors T-box expressed in T cells (T-bet), GATA binding protein 3 (GATA-3), RA orphan receptorγ (RORγt) and forkhead box P3 (Foxp3) were measured by Real-time PCR and Western blot, respectively.  Results: Pim-1 inhibitor and prednisone showed therapeutic effect on acute TNBS colitis in vivo. GATA3 and RORγt were significantly up-regulated in acute TNBS colitis (P&lt;0.05). In contrast, the expression of Foxp3 was suppressed in the inflammatory bowel disease group, whereas it did not cause any significant change in T-bet expression (P&gt;0.05). Administration of Pim-1 inhibitor and prednisone resulted in suppression of GATA3, RORγt expression, and the increase of Foxp3 expression (P&lt;0.05). Administration of Pim-1 inhibitor and prednisone resulted in inhibition of T-bet mRNA expression (P&lt;0.05), but only prednisone could inhibit T-bet protein expression (P&gt;0.05).  Conclusion: Pim-1 inhibitor significantly suppresses Th2- and Th17-type immune responses. Furthermore, Pim-1 inhibitor could induce T-cell differentiation towards a Treg phenotype. Pim-1 inhibitor has therapeutic effect on acute TNBS colitis.

PEAK1 is a newly described tyrosine kinase and scaffold protein that transmits integrin-mediated extracellular matrix (ECM) signals to facilitate cell movement and growth. While aberrant expression of PEAK1 has been linked to cancer progression, its normal physiological role in vertebrate biology is not known. Here we provide evidence that PEAK1 plays a central role in orchestrating new vessel formation in vertebrates. Deletion of the PEAK1 gene in zebrafish, mice, and human endothelial cells (ECs) induced severe defects in new blood vessel formation due to deficiencies in EC proliferation, survival, and migration. Gene transcriptional and proteomic analyses of PEAK1-deficient ECs revealed a significant loss of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2) mRNA and protein expression, as well as downstream signaling to its effectors, ERK, Akt, and Src kinase. PEAK1 regulates VEGFR2 expression by binding to and increasing the protein stability of the transcription factor GATA-binding protein 2 (GATA2), which controls VEGFR2 transcription. Importantly, PEAK1-GATA2-dependent VEGFR2 expression is mediated by EC adhesion to the ECM and is required for breast cancer-induced new vessel formation in mice. Also, elevated expression of PEAK1 and VEGFR2 mRNA are highly correlated in many human cancers including breast cancer. Together, our findings reveal a novel PEAK1-GATA2-VEGFR2 signaling axis that integrates cell adhesion and growth factor cues from the extracellular environment necessary for new vessel formation during vertebrate development and cancer.
Previous research has demonstrated that nicotine have protective role in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). However, the immunologic mechanisms of nicotine's effect have not been fully elucidated. Herein, the effects of nicotine on the differentiation of Th1, Th2, and Th17 cells were assessed. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and CD4+T cells were separated from patients with RA. PBMCs were stimulated with anti-CD3/anti-CD28 in the absence or presence of nicotine. CD4+T cells were cultured in the Th cell differentiation condition in the absence of nicotine or nicotine and alpha- bungarotoxin (αBgt) (the antagonist of nicotine) combined. Levels of T cell cytokines were detected with ELISA and flow cytometry. The expression of specific transcription factors (retinoic orphan re- ceptor c (RORc), T-box transcription factor (T-bet), and GATA Binding Protein 3 (GATA-3)) and signaling molecules (P-ERK1/2 and T-ERK1/2) were determined by Western blot. The results showed nicotine reduced IL-17A and increased IL-4 produced by stimulated PBMCs. During Th17 differentiation conditions, nicotine reduced the levels of IL-17A and RORc, induced the phosphorylation of ERK1/2. Meanwhile, nicotine increased the levels of IL-4 and GATA3 during Th2 differentiation. α-Bgt blocked the effects of nicotine on Th2 and Th17 differentiation. However, nicotine had no effect on the expression of IFN-γ and T-bet in CD4+T cells during Th1differentiation. These results demonstrate that nicotine suppresses Th17 differentiation, promotes Th2 differentiation and improves Th1/Th2 imbalance in RA patients, providing a new justification for its application in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis.
This study aimed to investigate the underlying molecular mechanisms of Parkinson's disease (PD) by bioinformatics.
Using the microarray dataset GSE72267 from the Gene Expression Omnibus database, which included 40 blood samples from PD patients and 19 matched controls, differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified after data preprocessing, followed by Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analyses. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) network, microRNA- (miRNA-) target regulatory network, and transcription factor- (TF-) target regulatory networks were constructed.
Of 819 DEGs obtained, 359 were upregulated and 460 were downregulated. Two GO terms, "rRNA processing" and "cytoplasm," and two KEGG pathways, "metabolic pathways" and "TNF signaling pathway," played roles in PD development. Intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM1) was the hub node in the PPI network; hsa-miR-7-5p, hsa-miR-433-3p, and hsa-miR-133b participated in PD pathogenesis. Six TFs, including zinc finger and BTB domain-containing 7A, ovo-like transcriptional repressor 1, GATA-binding protein 3, transcription factor dp-1, SMAD family member 1, and quiescin sulfhydryl oxidase 1, were related to PD.
"rRNA processing," "cytoplasm," "metabolic pathways," and "TNF signaling pathway" were key pathways involved in PD. ICAM1, hsa-miR-7-5p, hsa-miR-433-3p, hsa-miR-133b, and the abovementioned six TFs might play important roles in PD development.
Inflammation of the nose and paranasal sinus or rhinosinusitis (RS) is a significant global health problem that is both very common and very costly to treat. Previous reports reveal variability in histology and mechanism of inflammation in patients with chronic rhinosinusitis with and without polyp (CRScNP and CRSsNP, respectively). There are various methods and hypothesis that try to explain this variability. Accordingly, the aim of this study was to investigate the incidence of each type of sinonasal inflammation among patients diagnosed with CRScNP or CRSsNP using transcription factor analysis (TFA). This study included mucosa specimens from nose/paranasal sinuses from patients with chronic rhinitis (CR), CRSsNP, or CRScNP that were obtained at the Department of Otorhinolaryngology, Faculty of Medicine Siriraj Hospital, Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand during the June 2009 to May 2012 study period. TFA was employed to measure the following transcription factors: T-box transcription factor (T-bet) for Th1, GATA binding protein 3 (GATA-3) for Th2, retinoic acid-related orphan receptor C (RORC) for Th17, and forkhead box P3 (FOXP3) for Treg. Forty-one subjects (22 males, 19 females) were enrolled, with a mean age of 45.93 ± 13 years. Twenty-six patients were diagnosed with CRScNP, 7 with CRSsNP, and 8 with CR (controls). The majority of CRScNP specimens (76.9%) had eosinophil count greater than 100 cells/high-power field (HPF). Mean eosinophil count was 930.08 ± 1,399 cells/HPF (range: 17-5,570). Th2 transcription factor (GATA-3) was statistically significantly higher in the CRScNP group than in the CRS and control groups (p &lt; 0.001); whereas, Treg transcription factor (FOXP3) was statistically significantly lower in the CRScNP group than in the CRSsNP and control groups (p &lt; 0.001). The transcription factors for Th1 and Th17 (T-bet and RORC, respectively) were not significantly different among the three groups. The result of transcription factor analysis revealed hyperfunction of Th2 in patients with CRScNP, which might result in hypereosinophilic infliltration in the polyps. One explanation for this finding is the decreased activity of Treg. Although environment-host interaction is the most probable hypothesis, the etiology of aberrant adaptive immunity needs to be elucidated.
Cardiac progenitor cells (CPCs) being multipotent offer a promising source for cardiac repair due to their ability to proliferate and multiply into cardiac lineage cells. Here, we explored a novel strategy for human CPCs generation from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) using a cardiogenic small molecule, isoxazole (ISX-9) and their ability to grow in the scar tissue for functional improvement in the infarcted myocardium. CPCs were induced from hiPSCs with ISX-9. CPCs were characterized by immunocytochemistry and RT-PCR. The CPC survival and differentiation in the infarcted hearts were determined by in vivo transplantation in immunodeficient mice following left anterior descending artery ligation and their effects were determined on fibrosis and functional improvement. ISX-9 simultaneously induced expression of cardiac transcription factors, NK2 homeobox 5, islet-1, GATA binding protein 4, myocyte enhancer factor-2 in hiPSCs within 3 days of treatment and successfully differentiated into three cardiac lineages in vitro. Messenger RNA and microRNA-sequencing results showed that ISX-9 targeted multiple cardiac differentiation, proliferation signaling pathways and upregulated myogenesis and cardiac hypertrophy related-microRNA. ISX-9 activated multiple pathways including transforming growth factor β induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition signaling, canonical, and non-canonical Wnt signaling at different stages of cardiac differentiation. CPCs transplantation promoted myoangiogenesis, attenuated fibrosis, and led to functional improvement in treated mice.
Quercetin, a flavonoid, has been reported to ameliorate cardiovascular diseases, such as cardiac hypertrophy. However, the mechanism is not completely understood. In this study, a mechanism related to proteasome-glycogen synthesis kinase 3 (GSK-3) was elucidated in rats and primary neonatal cardiomyocytes.
Rats were subjected to sham or constriction of abdominal aorta surgery groups and treated with or without quercetin for 8 weeks. Angiotensin II (Ang II)-induced primary cardiomyocytes were cultured with quercetin treatment or not for 48 h. Echocardiography, real-time RT-PCR, histology, immunofluorescence, and Western blotting were conducted. Proteasome activities were also detected using a fluorescent peptide substrate.
Echocardiography showed that quercetin prevented constriction of abdominal aorta-induced cardiac hypertrophy and improved the cardiac diastolic function. In addition, quercetin also significantly reduced the Ang II-induced hypertrophic surface area and atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) mRNA level in primary cardiomyocytes. Proteasome activities were obviously inhibited in the quercetin-treated group both in vivo and in vitro. Quercetin also decreased the levels of proteasome subunit beta type (PSMB) 1, PSMB2, and PSMB5 of the 20S proteasome as well as the levels of proteasome regulatory particle (Rpt) 1 and Rpt4 of the 19S proteasome. In particular, the PSMB5 level in the nucleus was reduced after quercetin treatment. Furthermore, phosphorylated GSK-3α/β (inactivation of GSK-3) was decreased, which means that GSK-3 activity was increased. The phosphorylation levels of upstream AKT (PKB (protein kinase B)) and liver kinase B1/AMP activated protein kinase (LKB1/AMPKα) and those of downstream extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), histone H3, β-catenin, and GATA binding protein 4 (GATA4) were reduced after quercetin treatment, while hypertrophy was reversed after treatment with the GSK-3 inhibitor.
In summary, quercetin prevents cardiac hypertrophy, which is related to proteasome inhibition and activation of GSK-3α/β. Upstream (AKT, LKB1/AMPKα) and downstream hypertrophic factors, such as ERK, histone H3, β-catenin, and GATA4, may also be involved.
Forkhead box protein M1(FoxM1) is a member of forkhead superfamily transcription factors. Emerging evidences have progressively contributed to our understanding on a central role of FoxM1 in human cancers. However, perspectives on the function of FoxM1 in breast cancer (BC) remain conflicting, and mostly were from basic research. Here, we explored the expression profile and prognostic values of FoxM1 based on analysis of pooled clinical datasets derived from online accessible databases, including ONCOMINE, Breast Cancer Gene-Expression Miner v4.0, and Kaplan-Meier plotter. It was found that, FoxM1 mRNA expression was significantly higher in breast tumor versus normal control. FoxM1expression profile presented a distinct pattern in different molecular subtypes of BC patients. Higher expression of FoxM1 was correlated to low mRNA expression of estrogen receptor 1 (ESR1), erb-B2 receptor tyrosine kinase 2 (ERBB2), and was inversely associated with the expression of classical luminal regulators forkhead box protein A1 (FoxA1) and GATA binding protein 3 (GATA3). Elevated FoxM1 expression predicted shorter distance metastasis free survival (DMFS) in BC patients, particularly with estrogen receptor (ER) positive and Luminal A, Luminal B subtypes of BC. More interestingly, elevated FoxM1 expression predicted poor survival in breast cancer patients, especially in the ER (+), progesterone receptor (PR) (+) subgroups and BC patients received adjuvant chemotherapy only or treated with tamoxifen only. These results implied that FoxM1 is an essential prognostic factor and promising candidate target in the treatment of breast cancer.
Endometriotic stromal cells synthesize estradiol via the steroidogenic pathway. Nuclear receptor subfamily 5, group A, member 1 (NR5A1) is critical, but alone not sufficient, in activating this cascade that involves at least 5 genes. To evaluate whether another transcription factor is required for the activation of this pathway, we examined whether GATA Binding Protein 6 (GATA6) can transform a normal endometrial stromal cell (NoEM) into an endometriotic-like cell by conferring an estrogen-producing phenotype. We ectopically expressed GATA6 alone or with NR5A1 in NoEM or silenced these transcription factors in endometriotic stromal cells (OSIS) and assessed the messenger RNAs or proteins encoded by the genes in the steroidogenic cascade. Functionally, we assessed the effects of GATA6 expression or silencing on estradiol formation. In OSIS, GATA6 was necessary for catalyzing the conversion of progesterone to androstenedione (CYP17A1; P &lt; .05). In NoEM, ectopic expression of GATA6 was essential for converting pregnenolone to estrogen (HSD3B2, CYP17A1, and CYP19A1; P &lt; .05). However, simultaneous ectopic expression of both GATA6 and NR5A1 was required and sufficient to confer induction of all 5 genes and their encoded proteins that convert cholesterol to estrogen. Functionally, only simultaneous knockdown of GATA6 and NR5A1 blocked estradiol formation in OSIS ( P &lt; .05). The presence of both transcription factors was required and sufficient to transform endometrial stromal cells into endometriotic-like cells that produced estradiol in large quantities ( P &lt; .05). In summary, GATA6 alone is essential but not sufficient for estrogen formation in endometriosis. However, simultaneous addition of GATA6 and NR5A1 to an endometrial stromal cell is sufficient to transform it into an endometriotic-like cell, manifested by the activation of the estradiol biosynthetic cascade.
GATA binding protein 6 (GATA6) is a member of the GATA family of zinc-finger transcriptional regulators, whose names come from the conservative base sequence (G/A)GATA(A/T). The GATA families play key roles in cell fate determination, proliferation, migration, and organogenesis of endoderm- and mesoderm-derived organs in vertebrates. As a lineage-specific factor, a chromatin remodeling factor, a pluripotent factor and a pioneer factor, GATA6 is involved in various stages of liver development, including endoderm liver-lineage determination, liver specification, hepatic bud outgrowth and hepatoblast differentiation. In this review, we summarize recent progress in the roles and regulatory mechanisms of GATA6 in liver development.
To investigate the effects of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) on the differentiation of T lymphocyte subsets and the expression of specific transcription regulator T-bet/GATA binding protein 3 (GATA3).
A prospective double-blind study was conducted. Patients with CPB pulmonary repair of ventricular septal defect (observation group) or off-pump ligation of ductus arteriosus (control group) with 20 cases each in the 150th Military Hospital from February 2015 to February 2016 were enrolled. The blood sampled was collected on the time of before operation, at the end of CPB or operation, 4 hours after operation, and 24 hours after operation. T lymphocytes were isolated, the helper T cell 1 (Th1) specific transcription factor T-bet mRNA, helper T cell 2 (Th2) specific transcription factor GATA3 mRNA expression and cytokine γ-interferon (IFN-γ) mRNA, interleukin-4 (IL-4) mRNA expression were measured by Northern Blot.
Compared with before operation, expression levels of T-bet mRNA [integral gray values: (1.39±0.52)×105 vs. (2.92±0.88)×105], IFN-γ mRNA [integral gray values: (3.68±0.65)×105 vs. (6.10±0.93)×105] were decreased transiently at the end of CPB in the observation group (both P &lt; 0.05), returned to preoperative levels at 24 hours after operation [integral gray values: (2.77±0.74)×105, (6.22±1.25)×105, respectively, both P &gt; 0.05]; expression levels of GATA3 mRNA [integral gray values: (4.96±0.88)×105 vs. (3.21±0.68)×105], IL-4 mRNA [integral gray values: (3.52±1.13)×105 vs. (1.85±0.63)×105] were increased (both P &lt; 0.05), recovered to the preoperative levels at 24 hours after operation [integral gray values: (3.11±0.51)×105, (1.93±0.84)×105, respectively, both P &gt; 0.05]. There were no significant differences in the expressions of T-bet, GATA3, IFN-γ and IL-4 mRNA in the control group at each time points (all P &gt; 0.05).
CPB causes the imbalance of Th1, Tc1/Th2, Tc2 and pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory reactions specially, which participate the complication occurrence after CPB. The changing of T-bet/GATA3 may be the internal mechanism for these changes.
Isl1 is required for two processes during hindlimb development: initiation of the processes directing hindlimb development in the lateral plate mesoderm and configuring posterior hindlimb field in the nascent hindlimb buds. During these processes, Isl1 expression is restricted to the posterior mesenchyme of hindlimb buds. How this dynamic change in Isl1 expression is regulated remains unknown. We found that two evolutionarily conserved sequences, located 3' to the Isl1 gene, regulate LacZ transgene expression in the hindlimb-forming region in mouse embryos. Both sequences contain GATA binding motifs, and expression pattern analysis identified that Gata6 is expressed in the flank and the anterior portion of nascent hindlimb buds. Recent studies have shown that conditional inactivation of Gata6 in mice causes hindlimb-specific pre-axial polydactyly, indicating a role of Gata6 in anterior-posterior patterning of hindlimbs. We studied whether Gata6 restricts Isl1 in the nascent hindlimb bud through the cis-regulatory modules. In vitro experiments demonstrate that GATA6 binds to the conserved GATA motifs in the cis-regulatory modules. GATA6 repressed expression of a luciferase reporter that contains the cis-regulatory modules by synergizing with Zfpm2. Analyses of Gata6 mutant embryos showed that ISL1 levels are higher in the anterior of nascent hindlimb buds than in wild type. Moreover, we detected a greater number of Isl1-transcribing cells in the anterior of nascent hindlimb buds in Gata6 mutants. Our results support a model in which Gata6 contributes to repression of Isl1 expression in the anterior of nascent hindlimb buds.
Congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) and associated pulmonary hypoplasia are thought to be caused by a malformation of the underlying diaphragmatic and airway mesenchyme. GATA binding protein 6 (Gata-6) is a zinc finger-containing transcription factor that plays a crucial role during diaphragm and lung development. In the primordial diaphragm, Gata-6 expression is restricted to mesenchymal compartments of the pleuroperitoneal folds (PPFs). In addition, Gata-6 is essential for airway branching morphogenesis through upregulation of mesenchymal signaling. Recently, mutations in Gata-6 have been linked to human CDH. We hypothesized that diaphragmatic and pulmonary Gata-6 expression is decreased in the nitrofen-induced CDH model.
Time-mated rats were exposed to either nitrofen or vehicle on gestational day 9 (D9). Fetal diaphragms (n = 72) and lungs (n = 48) were microdissected on selected timepoints D13, D15 and D18, and divided into control and nitrofen-exposed specimens (n = 12 per sample, timepoint and experimental group, respectively). Diaphragmatic and pulmonary gene expression of Gata-6 was analyzed by qRT-PCR. Immunofluorescence-double staining for Gata-6 was combined with the diaphragmatic mesenchymal marker Gata-4 and the pulmonary mesenchymal marker Fgf-10 to evaluate protein expression and localization in fetal diaphragms and lungs.
Relative mRNA expression levels of Gata-6 were significantly decreased in PPFs on D13 (0.57 ± 0.21 vs. 2.27 ± 1.30; p &lt; 0.05), developing diaphragms (0.94 ± 0.59 vs. 2.28 ± 1.89; p &lt; 0.05) and lungs (0.56 ± 0.16 vs. 0.71 ± 0.39; p &lt; 0.05) on D15 and fully muscularized diaphragms (1.20 ± 1.10 vs. 2.52 ± 1.86; p &lt; 0.05) and differentiated lungs (0.56 ± 0.05 vs. 0.77 ± 0.14; p &lt; 0.05) on D18 of nitrofen-exposed fetuses compared to controls. Confocal laser scanning microscopy demonstrated markedly diminished immunofluorescence of Gata-6 mainly in diaphragmatic and pulmonary mesenchyme, which was associated with a reduction of proliferating mesenchymal cells in nitrofen-exposed fetuses on D13, D15, and D18 compared to controls.
Decreased Gata-6 expression during diaphragmatic development and lung branching morphogenesis may disrupt mesenchymal cell proliferation, causing malformed PPFs and reduced airway branching, thus leading to diaphragmatic defects and pulmonary hypoplasia in the nitrofen-induced CDH model.
Heart failure is a significant cause of mortality worldwide, and most current therapies treat only its symptoms. The results of cardiac stem cell research suggest a promising treatment option for heart failure, but there is currently an unmet demand for better research models. We have therefore, for the first time, isolated, expanded and differentiated progenitor cells obtained from juvenile pig hearts to use as a platform for cardiac stem cell research.
Progenitor cells were isolated from the left ventricles of porcine hearts using collagenase enzymatic digestion and Percoll®-gradient centrifugation. Cells were proliferated in Matrigel®-coated wells. Cell differentiation was initiated by applying 5-azacytidine and subsequently controlled by modifying the serum concentration. Western blotting and qPCR were used to determine protein and gene expression, respectively.
Cardiac-specific genes, from the following proteins: troponin I-3, and myosin-heavy-chain 7 were stably expressed during proliferation and differentiation. Connexin-43 was upregulated and Actinin alfa 2 was downregulated during differentiation. The immature-cardiomyocyte marker GATA binding protein 4 was stably expressed but with a decrease in expression at day 4 of differentiation. Smooth muscle actin decreased in expression and Von Willebrand factor were stably expressed during differentiation. Smooth muscle protein expression was documented but no expression of cardiac-specific proteins after differentiation was found.
The isolated progenitor cells had key cardiac-lineage gene expression characteristics but they did not express cardiac-specific proteins. Smooth muscle protein was expressed confirming commitment to the smooth muscle lineage.
Erythropoietin (EPO) produces cytoprotection in many tissues by activating the EPO receptor (EPOR); these effects include anti-oxidative stress and the inhibition of apoptosis in renal tubular cells. Moreover, EPO is clinically used in diabetic patients who suffer from chronic renal disease. However, the effect of hyperglycemia on renal EPOR expression remains unknown. Therefore, we determined the changes in renal EPOR expression in diabetic rats and investigated the role of potential factors using cultured cells. Streptozotocin-induced hyperglycemic rats (STZ rats) treated with insulin or phloridzin to correct hyperglycemia were used to investigate treated with insulin or phloridzin to correct hyperglycemia were used to investigate the EPOR changes. Potential factors, including the transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) and GATA binding protein 1 (GATA1), were identified in cultured NRK-49F cells after incubation with high glucose (HG) levels to mimic diabetic animals. Renal EPOR expression was reduced by insulin and phloridzin in STZ rats, and hyperglycemia recovered. An increase in EPORs was also reproduced in hyperglycemia-exposed NRK-49F cells and HK-2 cells, which showed a higher expression of STAT3 or GATA1. Furthermore, the application of siRNA specific to STAT3 or GATA1 attenuated the higher expression of EPORs in HG-incubated NRK-49F cells. Moreover, stattic administered at a dose that was sufficient to inhibit STAT3 restored the level of renal EPORs in diabetic rats. Taken together, the expression of renal EPORs is increased by hyperglycemia via the STAT3/GATA1 pathway and has been characterized in both diabetic rats and cultured cells.
Pressure overload-induced cardiac stress induces left ventricular hypertrophy driven by increased cardiomyocyte mass. The increased energetic demand and cardiomyocyte size during hypertrophy necessitate increased fuel and oxygen delivery and stimulate angiogenesis in the left ventricular wall. We have previously shown that the transcriptional regulator steroid receptor coactivator-2 (SRC-2) controls activation of several key cardiac transcription factors and that SRC-2 loss results in extensive cardiac transcriptional remodeling. Pressure overload in mice lacking SRC-2 induces an abrogated hypertrophic response and decreases sustained cardiac function, but the cardiomyocyte-specific effects of SRC-2 in these changes are unknown. Here, we report that cardiomyocyte-specific loss of SRC-2 (SRC-2 CKO) results in a blunted hypertrophy accompanied by a rapid, progressive decrease in cardiac function. We found that SRC-2 CKO mice exhibit markedly decreased left ventricular vasculature in response to transverse aortic constriction, corresponding to decreased expression of the angiogenic factor VEGF. Of note, SRC-2 knockdown in cardiomyocytes decreased VEGF expression and secretion to levels sufficient to blunt in vitro tube formation and proliferation of endothelial cells. During pressure overload, both hypertrophic and hypoxic signals can stimulate angiogenesis, both of which stimulated SRC-2 expression in vitro Furthermore, SRC-2 coactivated the transcription factors GATA-binding protein 4 (GATA-4) and hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1α and -2α in response to angiotensin II and hypoxia, respectively, which drive VEGF expression. These results suggest that SRC-2 coordinates cardiomyocyte secretion of VEGF downstream of the two major angiogenic stimuli occurring during pressure overload bridging both hypertrophic and hypoxia-stimulated paracrine signaling.
Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a major air pollutant. Epidemiologic studies have found that NO2 exposure is associated with an increased risk of asthma. Nevertheless, the potential molecular mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, we investigated the effect of NO2 inhalation on the occurrence of allergic airway inflammation and its underlying mechanisms. Firstly, male Wistar rats were exposed to 2 and 5 mg/m3 NO2 (28 days, 5 h/day). The results showed that NO2 exposure could induce pulmonary inflammatory response, mucus formation, and Th1/Th2 imbalance in the lung of normal rats, resulting in allergic asthma-like features. Secondly, male Wistar rats were exposed to 5 mg/m3 NO2 (42 days, 5 h/day), sensitized with ovalbumin (OVA), challenged with aerosolized OVA, and characterized in asthma models. Results showed that NO2 exposure aggravated lung inflammation in the OVA-sensitized rats, accompanied by the increase in inflammatory cell infiltration, mucus hypersecretion, and collagen deposition. Furthermore, NO2 exposure promoted the increase in the expression of mucin gene (MUC5AC) and pro-inflammatory factors [interleukin (IL)-1β, intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), and IL-6] as well as serum OVA-specific immunoglobulin E (IgE) production. Taken together, we established that NO2 exposure promotes allergic airway inflammation and increases the asthma susceptibility. The underlying mechanisms involve the promotion of activation of interleukin-4/signal transducer and activator of transcription-6 (IL-4/STAT6) pathway [IL-4 receptor (IL-4R) α, janus kinase (JAK) 1, JAK 3, and STAT6] and related transcription factor [T cell-specific protein-tyrosine kinase (Lck), extracellular-regulated kinase (ERK)1/2, and nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB)]. In particular, the imbalance of Th1/Th2 cell differentiation [IL-4, interferon (IFN)-γ, GATA-binding protein-3 (GATA-3), and T-box expressed in T cells (T-bet)] plays a pivotal role in NO2-induced inflammatory responses. These findings may provide a better understanding of mechanism of NO2-associated respiratory diseases.
The objective of this study was to evaluate the frequency of CD4+ T cell subsets in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), urine and renal tissue from patients with lupus nephritis (LN). PBMC and urinary cells were collected from 17 patients with active LN, 20 disease controls (DC) with primary glomerulonephritis and 10 healthy controls (HC) and were analysed by flow cytometry with markers for T helper type 1 (Th1), Th2, Th17 and regulatory T cells (Treg ) cells. T cell subsets were assessed by immunohistochemistry from LN biopsy specimens from 12 LN patients. T cell subtypes in PBMC were re-evaluated at 6 months of therapy. CD4+ T cells were decreased in PBMC in LN compared with DC and HC (P = 0·0001). No differences were observed in urinary CD4+ T cell subsets between LN and DC. The frequency of urinary Th17 cells was higher in patients with non-proliferative than in proliferative LN (P = 0·041). CD3+ and T-box 21 ( Tbet+) cells were found in glomeruli and interstitium of LN patients, while forkhead box protein 3 (FoxP3), retinoid-related orphan receptor gamma (ROR-γ) and GATA binding protein 3 (GATA-3) were present only in glomeruli. Th1 cells in PBMC were correlated negatively with urinary Th1 cells (Rho = -0·531; P = 0·028) and with Tbet in renal interstitium (Rho = -0·782; P = 0·004). At 6 months, LN patients showed an increase in Th17 cells in PBMC. In conclusion, the inverse association between Th1 cells from PBMC and urinary/renal tissue indicate a role for Th1 in LN pathophysiology. Urinary Th17 cells were associated with less severe LN, and Th17 increased in PBMC during therapy. Urinary CD4+ T cells were not different between LN and DC.
The aim was to identify cell and genetic predictors of human blastocyst hatching success in assisted reproduction programmes via a prospective case-control study. Blastocysts, donated by couples in assisted reproduction programmes were used. Hatching success assessment was performed after 144-146 h post-fertilization. The mRNA expression levels of cathepsin V (CTSV), GATA-binding protein 3 (GATA3) and human chorionic gonadotropin beta subunit 3, 5, 7 and 8 (CGB) genes were detected by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. The odds ratio (OR) of hatching due to zona pellucida (ZP) thickness, oocyte and sperm quality, embryo quality and mRNA expression of CTSV, GATA3 and CGB genes in blastocysts was determined. From 62 blastocysts included in the study, 47 (75.8%) were unable to hatch spontaneously. The ZP thickening, and oocyte and sperm quality did not affect human blastocyst ability to hatch, except the combination of cytoplasmic and extracytoplasmic oocyte dysmorphisms (OR = 1.25; 95% confidence interval = 1.08, 1.45). Hatching-capable blastocysts had higher Gardner scale grade and mRNA expression of CTSV, GATA3 and CGB genes than hatching-incapable blastocysts. The human blastocyst hatching success depends on the blastocyst Gardner grade, but not on ZP and gamete quality. Blastocyst development was regulated by CTSV, GATA3 and CGB gene expression.
The root of Peucedanum japonicum Thunberg is traditionally used to treat coughs, colds, headache and inflammatory diseases in Korea and Japan. Its effects on allergic lung inflammation have not been investigated.
To investigate the anti-asthmatic effects of Peucedanum japonicum extract (PJE) using a murine model of asthma and a lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated macrophage cell line.
Mice underwent two rounds of sensitization with ovalbumin 1 week apart followed by four intranasal ovalbumin challenges on days 13-16. The control group received saline only. Two ovalbumin-sensitized groups were orally administered vehicle or PJE (200mg/kg) 5 days a week starting 1 week before the first ovalbumin sensitization. The third group was orally administered the asthma medication Montelukast (10mg/kg) on days 12-16. All animals were sacrificed on day 17. The lungs were assessed for histological features, inflammatory cell infiltration, Th2 cell activation and GATA-binding protein-3 (GATA-3) expression. The bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) was assessed for type 2 cytokine levels. The effect of PJE on the in vitro Th2 polarization of naïve CD4+ splenocytes and the production of pro-inflammatory mediators and cytokines by LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 cells was evaluated.
PJE treatment inhibited OVA-induced inflammatory cell infiltration, eosinophilia, Th2 activation, and GATA-3 expression in the lung, reduced the interleukin (IL)-5 and IL-13 levels in BALF, down-regulated Th2 activation in vitro, and inhibited the macrophage production of inducible nitric oxide, cyclooxygenase-2, tumor necrosis factor-α, and IL-6.
PJE attenuated allergic airway inflammation by inhibiting Th2 cell activation and macrophage production of inflammatory mediators. Peucedanum japonicum may be candidate therapy for allergic lung inflammation.
Preimplantation embryos undergo zygotic genome activation and lineage specification resulting in three distinct cell types in the late blastocyst. The molecular mechanisms underlying this progress are largely unknown in bovines. Here, we sought to analyze an extensive set of regulators at the single-cell level to define the events involved in the development of the bovine blastocyst. Using a quantitative microfluidics approach in single cells, we analyzed mRNA levels of 96 genes known to function in early embryonic development and maintenance of stem cell pluripotency in parallel in 384 individual cells from bovine preimplantation embryos. The developmental transitions can be distinguished by distinctive gene expression profiles and we identified NOTCH1, expressed in early developmental stages, while T-box 3 (TBX3) and fibroblast growth factor receptor 4 (FGFR4), expressed in late developmental stages. Three lineages can be segregated in bovine expanded blastocysts based on the expression patterns of lineage-specific genes such as disabled homolog 2 (DAB2), caudal type homeobox 2 (CDX2), ATPase H+/K+ transporting non-gastric alpha2 subunit (ATP12A), keratin 8 (KRT8), and transcription factor AP-2 alpha (TFAP2A) for trophectoderm; GATA binding protein 6 (GATA6) and goosecoid homeobox (GSC) for primitive endoderm; and Nanog homeobox (NANOG), teratocarcinoma-derived growth factor 1 (TDGF1), and PR/SET domain 14 (PRDM14) for epiblast. Moreover, some lineage-specific genes were coexpressed in blastomeres from the morula. The commitment to trophectoderm and inner cell mass lineages in bovines occurs later than in the mouse, and KRT8 might be an earlier marker for bovine trophectoderm cells. We determined that TDGF1 and PRDM14 might play pivotal roles in the primitive endoderm and epiblast specification of bovine blastocysts. Our results shed light on early cell fate determination in bovine preimplantation embryos and offer theoretical support for deriving bovine embryonic stem cells.
Pelvic endometriosis is a complex syndrome characterized by an estrogen-dependent chronic inflammatory process that affects primarily pelvic tissues, including the ovaries. It is caused when shed endometrial tissue travels retrograde into the lower abdominal cavity. Endometriosis is the most common cause of chronic pelvic pain in women and is associated with infertility. The underlying pathologic mechanisms in the intracavitary endometrium and extra-uterine endometriotic tissue involve defectively programmed endometrial mesenchymal progenitor/stem cells. While endometriotic stromal cells, which compose the bulk of endometriotic lesions, do not carry somatic mutations, they demonstrate specific epigenetic abnormalities that alter expression of key transcription factors. For example, GATA-binding factor-6 overexpression transforms an endometrial stromal cell to an endometriotic phenotype, and steroidogenic factor-1 overexpression causes excessive production of estrogen, which drives inflammation via pathologically high levels of estrogen receptor-β. Progesterone receptor deficiency causes progesterone resistance. Populations of endometrial and endometriotic epithelial cells also harbor multiple cancer-driver mutations, such as KRAS, which may be associated with the establishment of pelvic endometriosis or ovarian cancer. It is not known how interactions between epigenomically defective stromal cells and the mutated genes in epithelial cells contribute to the pathogenesis of endometriosis. Endometriosis-associated pelvic pain is managed by suppression of ovulatory menses and estrogen production, cyclooxygenase inhibitors, and surgical removal of pelvic lesions, and in vitro fertilization is frequently used to overcome infertility. Although novel targeted treatments are becoming available, as endometriosis pathophysiology is better understood, preventive approaches such as long-term ovulation suppression may play a critical role in the future.
Fibroblast growth factor 11 (FGF11) is a member of the intracellular fibroblast growth factor superfamily. Here, we identified FGF11 as a novel mediator of adipogenesis. During 3T3-L1 adipocyte differentiation, the expression of FGF11 decreased at the mitotic clonal expansion stage and increased at the terminal differentiation stage. FGF11 knockdown reduced the expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ), a master regulator of adipogenesis, resulting in the inhibition of adipocyte differentiation. Treatment with the PPARγ agonist rosiglitazone restored the inhibition of adipogenesis caused by FGF11 knockdown. We also report that the expression of the PPARγ regulators CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein α, sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1, KLF9, KLF2, GATA binding factor 2, and GATA binding factor 3 was influenced by FGF11. These results suggest that FGF11 indirectly controls the expression of PPARγ through modifying the expression of multiple PPARγ regulators, thereby mediating adipogenesis.
Recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL) is a one of the most common obstetrical complications. Since, the successful pregnancy occurs in T helper 2 (Th2)-dominant situation and since, Th1 type immunity is related to pregnancy failure, we investigated the effects of cyclosporine on Th1 and Th2 cells in RPL women. Totally, 76 RPL patients (38 women as treated group and 38 as control group) were included in this study. Flow cytometry was utilized to analyze the frequency of Th1 and Th2 in blood samples. Also, real-time polymerase chain reaction was carried out to assess the messenger RNA (mRNA) expression of transcription factors and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to evaluate Th1 and Th2 related cytokines. Significant decrease in Th1 frequency (p = 0.0004), Th1/Th2 ratio (p &lt; 0.0001), T-bet mRNA expression (p &lt; 0.0001), interferon-γ (p = 0.0007), and tumor necrosis factor α (p = 0.0002) secretion level were observed in cyclosporine group. Moreover, significant increase in Th2 frequency (p &lt; 0.0001), mRNA expression of GATA binding protein 3 (p = 0.0001), and interleukin 10 secretion level (p = 0.0027) was also evident in treated group. At the end of the investigation, 31 (81.5%) patients in cyclosporine-treated group had successful childbirth when compared with 16 (42.1%) women in control group (p = 0.0001). Given this, cyclosporine treatment for RPL patients with elevated Th1/Th2 ratio can result in improved pregnancy outcome.
The Notch signalling pathway in the mammalian ovary regulates granulosa cell proliferation. However, the effects of Notch signalling on steroidogenesis are unclear. In this study we cultured mouse ovarian granulosa cells from preantral follicles invitro and observed the effect of Notch signalling on steroidogenesis through overexpression, knockdown and inhibition of Notch signalling. Activation of Notch signalling decreased progesterone and oestrogen secretion. In contrast, inhibition of Notch signalling increased the production of progesterone and oestrogen. Expression of the genes for steroidogenic-related enzymes, including 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, p450 cholesterol side-chain cleavage enzyme and aromatase, was repressed after stimulation of Notch signalling. The expression of upstream transcription factors, including steroidogenic factor 1 (SF1), Wilms' tumour 1 (Wt1), GATA-binding protein 4 (Gata4) and Gata6, was also inhibited after stimulation of Notch signalling. Production of interleukin (IL)-6 was positively correlated with Notch signalling and negatively correlated with the expression of these transcription factors and enzymes. In conclusion, Notch signalling regulated progesterone and oestrogen secretion by affecting the expression of upstream transcription factors SF1, Wt1, Gata4 and Gata6, as well as downstream steroidogenic-related enzymes. IL-6, which may be regulated directly by Notch signalling, may contribute to this process. Our findings add to the understanding of the diverse functions of Notch signalling in the mammalian ovary.
Salivary glands are a major component of the mucosal immune system that confer adaptive immunity to mucosal pathogens. As previously demonstrated, immunization of the submandibular gland with tissue culture-derived murine cytomegalovirus (tcMCMV) or replication-deficient adenoviruses expressing individual murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) genes protected mice against a lethal MCMV challenge. Here, we report that salivary gland inoculation of BALB/cByJ mice with tcMCMV or recombinant adenoviruses differentially activates T helper (Th)1, -2, and -17 cells in the salivary glands vs. the associated lymph nodes. After inoculation with tcMCMV, lymphocytes from the submandibular gland preferentially express the transcription factor T-cell-specific T-box transcription factor (T-bet), which controls the expression of the hallmark Th1 cytokine, IFN-γ. Lymphocytes from the periglandular lymph nodes (PGLNs) express both T-bet and GATA-binding protein 3 (GATA3), which promotes the secretion of IL-4, -5, and -10 from Th2 cells. In contrast, after inoculation with replication-deficient adenoviruses, lymphocytes from the submandibular gland express T-bet, GATA3, and RAR-related orphan receptor γ, thymus-specific isoform (RORγt) (required for differentiation of Th17 cells) and forkhead box P3 (Foxp3) (required for the differentiation of regulatory T cells). Lymphocytes from the PGLNs were not activated. The differential induction of Th responses in the salivary gland vs. the PGLNs after inoculation with attenuated virus vs. a nominal protein antigen supports the use of the salivary as an alternative mucosal route for administering vaccines.-Liu, G., Zhang, F., Wang, R., London, S. D., London, L. Salivary gland immunization via Wharton's duct activates differential T-cell responses within the salivary gland immune system.
GATA4 is an essential transcriptional regulator required for gonadal development, differentiation, and function. In the developing testis, proposed GATA4-regulated genes include steroidogenic factor 1 (Nr5a1), SRY-related HMG box 9 (Sox9), and anti-Müllerian hormone (Amh). Although some of these genes have been validated as genuine GATA4 targets, it remains unclear whether GATA4 is a direct regulator of endogenous Amh transcription. We used a CRISPR/Cas9-based approach to specifically inactivate or delete the sole GATA-binding motif of the proximal mouse Amh promoter. AMH mRNA and protein levels were assessed at developmental time points corresponding to elevated AMH levels: fetal and neonate testes in males and adult ovaries in females. In males, loss of GATA binding to the Amh promoter significantly reduced Amh expression. Although the loss of GATA binding did not block the initiation of Amh transcription, AMH mRNA and protein levels failed to upregulate in the developing fetal and neonate testis. Interestingly, adult male mice presented no anatomical anomalies and had no evidence of retained Müllerian duct structures, suggesting that AMH levels, although markedly reduced, were sufficient to masculinize the male embryo. In contrast to males, GATA binding to the Amh promoter was dispensable for Amh expression in the adult ovary. These results provide conclusive evidence that in males, GATA4 is a positive modulator of Amh expression that works in concert with other key transcription factors to ensure that the Amh gene is sufficiently expressed in a correct spatiotemporal manner during fetal and prepubertal testis development.
Although rare cardiomyogenesis is reported in the adult mammalian heart, whether this results from differentiation or proliferation of cardiomyogenic cells remains controversial. The tumor suppressor genes RB1 (retinoblastoma) and CDKN2a (cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2a) are critical cell-cycle regulators, but their roles in human cardiomyogenesis remains unclear.
We hypothesized that developmental activation of RB1 and CDKN2a cooperatively cause permanent cell-cycle withdrawal of human cardiac precursors (CPCs) driving terminal differentiation into mature cardiomyocytes, and that dual inactivation of these tumor suppressor genes promotes myocyte cell-cycle reentry.
Directed differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) into cardiomyocytes revealed that RB1 and CDKN2a are upregulated at the onset of cardiac precursor specification, simultaneously with GATA4 (GATA-binding protein 4) homeobox genes PBX1 (pre-B-cell leukemia transcription factor 1) and MEIS1 (myeloid ecotropic viral integration site 1 homolog), and remain so until terminal cardiomyocyte differentiation. In both GATA4+ hPSC cardiac precursors and postmitotic hPSC-cardiomyocytes, RB1 is hyperphosphorylated and inactivated. Transient, stage-specific, depletion of RB1 during hPSC differentiation enhances cardiomyogenesis at the cardiac precursors stage, but not in terminally differentiated hPSC-cardiomyocytes, by transiently upregulating GATA4 expression through a cell-cycle regulatory pathway involving CDKN2a. Importantly, cytokinesis in postmitotic hPSC-cardiomyocytes can be induced with transient, dual RB1, and CDKN2a silencing. The relevance of this pathway in vivo was suggested by findings in a porcine model of cardiac cell therapy post-MI, whereby dual RB1 and CDKN2a inactivation in adult GATA4+ cells correlates with the degree of scar size reduction and endogenous cardiomyocyte mitosis, particularly in response to combined transendocardial injection of adult human hMSCs (bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cells) and cKit+ cardiac cells.
Together these findings reveal an important and coordinated role for RB1 and CDKN2a in regulating cell-cycle progression and differentiation during human cardiomyogenesis. Moreover, transient, dual inactivation of RB1 and CDKN2a in endogenous adult GATA4+ cells and cardiomyocytes mediates, at least in part, the beneficial effects of cell-based therapy in a post-MI large mammalian model, a finding with potential clinical implications.
This study was conducted to investigate the effect of CD226 on the differentiation, activation, and polyploidization of megakaryocytes (MKs) and explore the potential mechanism. Dami (megakaryocyte line) cell maturation was induced by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate. CD226 was silenced by infection with a CD226-specific shRNA lentiviral vector. The mRNA level of CD226 was detected by qRT-PCR. The expressions of Dami cells surface CD226, MK specific markers CD41 and CD62P, and DNA ploidy in Dami cells and CD226 knockdown (KD) cells were evaluated by flow cytometry. The effect of CD226 on the expression of megakaryocyte-associated transcription factors was measured by western blot and confocal analysis. Transfection with CD226 shRNA lentivirus dramatically decreased the level of CD226 and expression of CD62 P in Dami cells. Silencing of CD226 caused morphological changes and differentiation retardation in low-ploidy MK. Furthermore, CD226 knockout (KO) mice exhibited increased 2N-4N low-ploidy MK and decreased ≥8N polyploidy. Interestingly, silencing of CD226 in megakaryocytic cells down-regulated the expression of early stage transcription factors includes GATA-binding factor 1 (GATA-1) and friend leukemia integration 1 (FLI-1), but not late-stage nuclear factor, erythroid 2 (NF-E2). CD226 is involved in MKs activation and polyploidy cell cycle control.
Objective: To investigate the regulation of IL-25 on type Ⅱ innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) activation in the pathogenesis of allergic fungal rhinosinusitis (AFRS). Methods: Nasal mucosa tissues were collected from 16 AFRS patients and 12 patients, who underwent nasal endoscopic surgery for cerebrospinal rhinorrhea or skull base benign tumor during the period from June 2016 to June 2017 in Department of Rhinology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University. Firstly, flow cytometry was used to detect ILC2s in nasal mucosa of both groups. Secondly, the expression of IL-25, IL-5 and IL-13 in nasal mucosa was detected by immunofluorescence and/or Western Blot assay. Finally, fungal extracts, IL-25 and glucocorticoids were used to stimulate nasal mucosal epithelial cells and tissues in vitro respectively to detect the regulatory effect of IL-25 on ILC2s. SPSS 16.0 software was used to analyze the data. Results: The prevalence of ILC2s in nasal tissues was higher in patients with AFRS than those of the control group ((3.85±1.52)%(Mean±SD) vs (0.32±0.10)%, U=9.00, P&lt;0.05). There was a positive correlation between the prevalence of ILC2s and the number of eosinophils in nasal mucosa of patients with ARFS (r=0.80, P&lt;0.05). The expression of IL-25, IL-5 and IL-13 in nasal mucosa epithelium of AFRS group was significantly higher than that of the control group (0.49±0.13 vs 0.23±0.09, 0.23±0.05 vs 0.10±0.04, 0.31±0.08 vs 0.14±0.07, t value was 5.90, 7.21, 5.69, respectively, all P&lt;0.05). Fungal stimulation enhanced the expression of IL-25 protein in nasal epithelial cells of both groups (0.67±0.19 vs 0.25±0.12 (AFRS group), 0.62±0.17 vs 0.27±0.16 (control group), q value was 8.65, 9.26, respectively, all P&lt;0.05). In the IL-25 stimulated nasal mucosa at a concentration of 1, 10 and 100 ng/ml, the expression level of retinoid acid-related orphan receptor α (RORα) mRNA was 2.07±1.53, 5.06±0.93, 7.38±2.30, respectively; the expression level of GATA binding protein 3 (GATA3) mRNA was 3.58±1.29, 6.14±1.55, 7.64±2.28, respectively; the expression level of IL-5 protein was 0.21±0.06, 0.32±0.06, 0.38±0.10, respectively; the expression level of IL-13 was 0.52±0.13, 0.69±0.22, 0.82±0.21, respectively, which were significantly higher than that in the unstimulated nasal mucosa (1.00±0.00, 1.00±0.00, 0.11±0.05, 0.35±0.15, F value was 63.45, 59.27, 49.35, 20.20, respectively, all P&lt;0.05). The up-regulation could be inhibited by dexamethasone (F value was 89.20, 92.47, 99.63, 49.82, respectively, all P&lt;0.05). Conclusions: Epithelial-derived IL-25 up-regulates the expression of IRC2s-dependent transcription factors RORα and GATA3 mRNA, which are positively correlated with elevated IL-13 and IL-5 expression levels in tissues, may be involved in AFRS inflammatory response, and are inhibited by glucocorticoids.
目的： 探讨白细胞介素（IL）25调控Ⅱ型固有淋巴细胞（type Ⅱ innate lymphoid cells，ILC2s）活化在变应性真菌性鼻窦炎（allergic fungal rhinosinusitis，AFRS）发病机制中的作用。 方法： 收集2016年6月至2017年6月期间，于郑州大学第一附属医院鼻科诊治的16例AFRS患者的鼻黏膜组织，并选取同期行鼻内镜脑脊液鼻漏修补术或颅底良性肿瘤切除术的12例患者的鼻黏膜组织作为对照组。首先应用流式细胞术检测两组鼻黏膜组织中的ILC2s，然后应用免疫荧光和（或）Western Blot的方法检测IL-25、IL-5和IL-13在鼻黏膜组织中的表达，最后应用真菌提取物、IL-25和糖皮质激素分别刺激体外培养的鼻黏膜上皮细胞和组织，检测IL-25对ILC2s的调控作用。以SPSS 16.0软件对数据进行统计学分析。 结果： AFRS组鼻黏膜组织中ILC2s百分比为（3.85±1.52）%（x±s，下同），明显高于对照组（0.32±0.10）%，二者差异具有统计学意义（U=9.00，P&lt;0.05）。ARFS患者鼻黏膜组织中ILC2s百分比和嗜酸粒细胞数量呈正相关（r=0.80，P&lt;0.05）。两组患者鼻黏膜上皮组织均有IL-25、IL-5和IL-13的表达，AFRS组的表达强度明显高于对照组（0.49±0.13比0.23±0.09，0.23±0.05比0.10±0.04，0.31±0.08比0.14±0.07，t值分别为5.90、7.21、5.69，P值均&lt;0.05）。真菌刺激体外原代培养的鼻黏膜上皮细胞后，两组患者鼻黏膜上皮细胞的IL-25蛋白表达强度均升高（AFRS组为0.67±0.19比0.25±0.12，对照组为0.62±0.17比0.27±0.16，q值分别为8.65、9.26，P值均&lt;0.05）。以浓度为1、10和100 ng/ml的IL-25刺激鼻黏膜组织12 h后，维甲酸相关孤儿核受体α（retinoid acid-related orphan receptor α，RORα）mRNA的表达量分别为2.07±1.53、5.06±0.93、7.38±2.30，GATA结合蛋白3（GATA binding protein 3，GATA3）mRNA的表达量分别为3.58±1.29、6.14±1.55、7.64±2.28，IL-5蛋白的表达量分别为0.21±0.06、0.32±0.06、0.38±0.10，IL-13蛋白的表达量分别为0.52±0.13、0.69±0.22、0.82±0.21，均高于刺激前（1.00±0.00、1.00±0.00、0.11±0.05、0.35±0.15），差异具有统计学意义（F值分别为63.45、59.27、49.35、20.20，P值均&lt;0.05），地塞米松可抑制四者表达的上调（F值分别为89.20、92.47、99.63、49.82，P值均&lt;0.05）。 结论： 上皮细胞衍生的IL-25上调了ILC2s依赖的转录因子RORα和GATA3 mRNA的表达，二者与组织中IL-13和IL-5表达水平升高呈正相关，可能参与了AFRS的炎性反应，并可受糖皮质激素抑制。.
High androgen levels in patients suffering from polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) can be effectively reversed if the herb Scutellaria baicalensis is included in traditional Chinese medicine prescriptions. To characterize the effects of baicalin, extracted from S. baicalensis, on androgen biosynthesis in NCI-H295R cells and on hyperandrogenism in PCOS model rats and to elucidate the underlying mechanisms. The optimum concentration and intervention time for baicalin treatment of NCI-H295R cells were determined by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. The functional genes affected by baicalin were studied by gene expression profiling (GEP), and the key genes were identified using a dual luciferase assay, RNA interference technique, and genetic mutations. Besides, hyperandrogenic PCOS model rats were induced and confirmed before and after baicalin intervention. As a result, Baicalin decreased the testosterone concentrations in a dose-and time-dependent manner in NCI-H295R cells. GEP revealed that 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type II (HSD3B2) was the key enzyme of androgen biosynthesis, and baicalin inhibited the expression of HSD3B2 by regulating the binding of transcription factor GATA-binding factor 1 (GATA1) to the HSD3B2 promoter. Hyperandrogenic PCOS model rats treated with baicalin significantly reversed the high androgen levels of serum and the abnormal ovarian status, restored the estrous cyclicity, and decreased the expression of HSD3B2 in ovarian. In summary , our data revealed that GATA1 is an important transcription factor activating the HSD3B2 promoter in steroidogenesis, and baicalin potentially be an effective therapeutic agent for hyperandrogenism in PCOS by inhibiting the recruitment of GATA1 to the HSD3B2 promoter in ovarian tissue.
Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) patients have an increased risk of developing visceral metastases and other primary nonbreast cancers, particularly lung cancer. The differential diagnosis of TNBC metastases and primary cancers from other organs can be difficult due to lack of a TNBC standard immunoprofile. We analyzed the diagnostic value of estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, human epidermal growth factor receptor, thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF1), Napsin A, mammaglobin, gross cystic disease fluid protein 15 (GCDFP15), Sry-related HMg-Box gene 10 (SOX10), GATA-binding protein 3 (GATA3), and androgen receptor in a series of 207 TNBC and 152 primary lung adenocarcinomas (LA). All tested TNBCs were TTF1 and Napsin A-negative. When comparing TNBC and TTF1-positive or negative LA, SOX10 had the best sensitivity (62.3%) and specificity (100%) as a marker in favor of TNBC compared with LA, irrespective of TTF1 status (P&lt;0.0001). GATA3 had moderate sensitivity (30.4%) and excellent specificity (98.7%) and misclassified only 2/152 LA (1.3%). GCDFP15 had a moderate sensitivity (20.8%) and excellent specificity (98%) and misclassified only 3/152 (2%) LA. Mammaglobin and androgen receptor had moderate sensitivities (38.2% and 30%), good specificities (81.6% and 86%), and misclassified 28/152 and 21/152 LAs, respectively. In multivariate analysis, the best markers, enabling the distinction between SOX10-negative TNBC and TTF1 and Napsin A-negative LA were GATA3 (odds ratio=33.5; 95% confidence interval, 7.3-153.5; P&lt;0.0001) and GCDFP15 (odds ratio=31.7; 95% confidence interval, 6.9-145.6; P&lt;0.0001). Only 13/207 (6.3%) TNBC cases did not express any aforementioned marker. On the basis of our results, the best sequential immunohistochemical analysis to differentiate TNBC from TTF1-negative LA is first SOX10 followed by GATA3, and finally GCDFP15. This order is important in the diagnostic workup of small biopsies from lung nodules in women with a previous history of TNBC.
Neonates with Down syndrome (DS) have a propensity to develop the unique myeloproliferative disorder, transient abnormal myelopoiesis (TAM). TAM usually resolves spontaneously in ≤3 months, but approximately 10% of patients with TAM die from hepatic or multi-organ failure. After remission, 20% of patients with TAM develop acute myeloid leukemia associated with Down syndrome (ML-DS). Blasts in both TAM and ML-DS have trisomy 21 and GATA binding protein 1 (GATA1) mutations. Recent studies have shown that infants with DS and no clinical signs of TAM or increases in peripheral blood blasts can have minor clones carrying GATA1 mutations, referred to as silent TAM. Low-dose cytarabine can improve the outcomes of patients with TAM and high white blood cell count. A number of studies using fetal liver cells, mouse models, or induced pluripotent stem cells have elucidated the roles of trisomy 21 and GATA1 mutations in the development of TAM. Next-generation sequencing of TAM and ML-DS patient samples identified additional mutations in genes involved in epigenetic regulation. Xenograft models of TAM demonstrate the genetic heterogeneity of TAM blasts and mimic the process of clonal selection and expansion of TAM clones that leads to ML-DS. DNA methylation analysis suggests that epigenetic dysregulation may be involved in the progression from TAM to ML-DS. Unraveling the mechanisms underlying leukemogenesis and identification of factors that predict progression to leukemia could assist in development of strategies to prevent progression to ML-DS. Investigation of TAM, a unique pre-leukemic condition, will continue to strongly influence basic and clinical research into the development of hematological malignancies.
Transcriptional repressor GATA binding 1 (TRPS1), an atypical GATA transcription factor, functions as a transcriptional repressor and is also implicated in human cancers. However, the underlying mechanism of TRPS1 contributing to malignancy remains obscure. In the current study, we report that TRPS1 recognizes both gene proximal and distal transcription start site (TSS) sequences to repress gene expression. Co-IP mass spectrometry and biochemical studies showed that TRPS1 binds to CHD4/NuRD(MTA2). Genome-wide and molecular studies revealed that CHD4/NuRD(MTA2) is required for TRPS1 transcriptional repression. Mechanically, TRPS1 and CHD4/NuRD(MTA2) form precision-guided transcriptional repression machinery in which TRPS1 guides the machinery to specific target sites by recognizing GATA elements, and CHD4/NuRD(MTA2) represses the transcription of target genes. Furthermore, TP63 was identified and validated to be a direct target of TRPS1-CHD4/NuRD(MTA2) complex, which represses TP63 expression by involving decommission of TP63 enhancer in the described precision-guided manner, leading to a reduction of the ΔNp63 level and contributing to migration and invasion of cancer cells.
This study investigated the effect of various magnetic flux densities of extremely low frequency electromagnetic fields (ELF-EMF) on expression of T-box transcription factor (T-bet) and GATA binding protein-3 (GATA-3) genes in the spleen and thymus of rats injected with human serum albumin (HSA). Moreover, serum levels of interferon (IFN)-γ and interleukin (IL)-4 were evaluated at two phases, that is, prestimulation and poststimulation with HSA. Eighty rats were separated into five groups, and four groups were exposed daily to 50 Hz EMF of 1, 100, 500, and 2000 μT magnetic flux densities for 60 days. To activate the immune system, 100 μg HSA was intraperitoneally injected into each rat on days 31, 44, and 58 of the regimen. Splenic and thymic T-bet and GATA-3 messenger RNA (mRNA) expression on day 61 was evaluated by reverse transcription quantitative PCR. Serum IFN-γ and IL-4 (in blood on day 31 before HSA and again on day 61) levels were evaluated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Expression of T-bet and GATA-3 mRNA was decreased in the spleen in hosts exposed to densities of 1 and 100 μT. Serum IFN-γ and IL-4 levels were also significantly decreased in 100 μT-exposed rats, but only at the prestimulation phase. From these findings, it appears that (30 and 60 days) ELF-EMF exposure could suppress the expression of some key genes associated with T helper (Th) cells and on some of their associated functions, that is, the ability to generate (in some cases, spontaneously) select cytokines. Whether this is attributable to effects on Th1/Th2 levels in the hosts and/or due to potential effects of the EMF on cellular functions remains to be determined.
Apoptosis induction and differentiation of promyelocytic leukemic cells into mature cells are major strategies for the drug-based treatment of leukemia. Lidamycin (LDM) which is a member of the enediyne antibiotic family exhibits extreme cytotoxicity. In the present study, the induction of apoptosis and differentiation in human chronic myeloid leukemia K562 cells by low concentrations of lidamycin were investigated. K562 cells were treated with lidamycin at various concentrations for 48 h, and accumulated in the metaphase as determined in previous experiments. Cell viability was determined using a Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay and the IC50 value of lidamycin was 0.1±3.2 nM. Induction of apoptosis was investigated morphologically by acridine orange/ethidium bromide (AO/EtBr) staining. Growth inhibition and apoptosis induction were observed in cells treated with low concentrations of lidamycin. In addition, western blot analysis revealed that treatment of the K562 cells with lidamycin at low concentrations upregulated the expression of caspase-8 and caspase-3. The induction of differentiation in human chronic myeloid leukemia K562 cells by lidamycin at low concentrations was also investigated. The nitroblue tetrazolium reduction ability of K562 cells was increased following treatment with lidamycin. Low concentrations of lidamycin triggered erythroid differentiation among K562 cells, indicated by morphological changes, increased hemoglobin content, and the expression of cell surface antigens such as CD71. Additionally the expression of GATA-binding factor 1 (GATA-1) protein in low concentration lidamycin-treated K562 cells was increased. The results of the present study suggest that a low-concentration lidamycin exerts effects on apoptosis and erythroid differentiation induction by increasing the expression of caspases and GATA-1 protein. Lidamycin may serve a positive role in relevant targeted chemotherapy and may represent a potential candidate for chronic myelogenous leukemia differentiation-inducing treatment.
The addition of a single β-d-GlcNAc sugar (O-GlcNAc) by O-GlcNAc-transferase (OGT) and O-GlcNAc removal by O-GlcNAcase (OGA) maintain homeostatic O-GlcNAc levels on cellular proteins. Changes in protein O-GlcNAcylation regulate cellular differentiation and cell fate decisions, but how these changes affect erythropoiesis, an essential process in blood cell formation, remains unclear. Here, we investigated the role of O-GlcNAcylation in erythropoiesis by using G1E-ER4 cells, which carry the erythroid-specific transcription factor GATA-binding protein 1 (GATA-1) fused to the estrogen receptor (GATA-1-ER) and therefore undergo erythropoiesis after β-estradiol (E2) addition. We observed that during G1E-ER4 differentiation, overall O-GlcNAc levels decrease, and physical interactions of GATA-1 with both OGT and OGA increase. RNA-Seq-based transcriptome analysis of G1E-ER4 cells differentiated in the presence of the OGA inhibitor Thiamet-G (TMG) revealed changes in expression of 433 GATA-1 target genes. ChIP results indicated that the TMG treatment decreases the occupancy of GATA-1, OGT, and OGA at the GATA-binding site of the lysosomal protein transmembrane 5 (Laptm5) gene promoter. TMG also reduced the expression of genes involved in differentiation of NB4 and HL60 human myeloid leukemia cells, suggesting that O-GlcNAcylation is involved in the regulation of hematopoietic differentiation. Sustained treatment of G1E-ER4 cells with TMG before differentiation reduced hemoglobin-positive cells and increased stem/progenitor cell surface markers. Our results show that alterations in O-GlcNAcylation disrupt transcriptional programs controlling erythropoietic lineage commitment, suggesting a role for O-GlcNAcylation in regulating hematopoietic cell fate.
The highly reproducible inheritance of chromosomes during mitosis in mammalian cells involves nuclear envelope breakdown, increased chromatin compaction, loss of long-range intrachromosomal interactions, loss of enhancer-promoter proximity, displacement of many transcription regulators from the chromatin and a marked decrease in RNA synthesis. Despite these dramatic changes in the mother cell, daughter cells are able to faithfully re-establish the parental chromatin and gene expression features characteristic of the cell type. Pioneering studies of mitotic chromatin signatures showed that despite global repression of transcription, the Hsp70 gene promoter retains an open chromatin conformation, which was proposed to allow the reactivation of the Hsp70 gene upon completion of mitosis - a phenomenon termed mitotic bookmarking. It was later shown that various cell-type-specific transcription factors, such as GATA-binding factor 1 (GATA1) in erythroblasts and forkhead box protein A1 (FOXA1) in hepatocytes, remain bound at a subset of their interphase binding sites in mitosis. Such bookmarking transcription factors remain on chromosomes in mitosis and have been shown to enable a subset of genes to be reactivated in a timely fashion upon mitotic exit. In addition, sensitive new methods to measure transcription revealed that mitotic cells retain residual transcription at a large number of genes. Furthermore, genes recover their interphase level of transcription in distinct waves. Thus, gene expression is precisely regulated as cells pass through mitosis to ensure faithful propagation of cell identity and function through cellular generations.
Background Stress-induced cell premature senescence participates in a variety of tissue and organ remodeling by secreting such proteins as proinflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors. However, the role of cardiomyocyte senescence in heart remodeling after acute myocardial infarction has not been thoroughly elucidated to date. Therefore, we sought to clarify the impact of premature myocardial senescence on postinfarction heart function. Methods and Results Senescence markers, including p16 INK4a, p21 CIP1/WAF1, and SA -β-gal staining, were analyzed in several heart disease models by immunostaining. Both postinfarction mouse hearts and ischemic human myocardium demonstrated increased senescence markers. Additionally, senescence-related secretory phenotype was activated after acute myocardial infarction, which upregulated senescence-related secretory phenotype factors, including CCN family member 1 ( CCN 1), interleukin-1α, tumor necrosis factor α, and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1. In vivo, a tail vein injection of AAV 9- Gata4-sh RNA significantly attenuated senescence-related secretory phenotype secretion and aggravated postinfarction heart dysfunction. Furthermore, among activated senescence-related secretory phenotype factors, CCN 1 administration reduced myofibroblast viability in vitro and rescued the deleterious effect of AAV 9- Gata4-sh RNA in vivo. Conclusions Myocardial premature senescence was observed in the ischemic hearts and improved postinfarction heart function, partly through the GATA-binding factor 4- CCN 1 pathway.
Paclitaxel is a first‑line chemotherapeutic agent for gastric cancer; however, resistance limits its effectiveness. Investigation into the underlying mechanisms of paclitaxel resistance is urgently required. In the present study, a paclitaxel‑resistant gastric cancer cell line (MGC‑803R) was generated with a morphological phenotype of epithelial‑to‑mesenchymal transition (EMT) and increased expression levels of microRNA (miR)‑155‑5p. MGC‑803R cell‑derived exosomes were effectively taken up by paclitaxel‑sensitive MGC‑803S cells, which exhibited EMT and chemoresistance phenotypes. miR‑155‑5p was enriched in MGC‑803R‑exosomes and could be delivered into MGC‑803S cells. miR‑155‑5p overexpression in MGC‑803S cells via transfection with mimics resulted in similar phenotypic effects as treatment with MGC‑803R exosome and increased miR‑155‑5p content in MGC‑803S exosomes, which then capable of inducing the malignant phenotype in the sensitive cells. GATA binding protein 3 (GATA3) and tumor protein p53‑inducible nuclear protein 1 (TP53INP1) were identified as targets of miR‑155‑5p. Exosomal miR‑155‑5p inhibited these targets by directly targeting their 3' untranslated regions. Knockdown of miR‑155‑5p was observed to reverse the EMT and chemoresistant phenotypes of MGC‑803R cells, potentially via GATA3 and TP53INP1 upregulation, which inhibited MGC‑803R‑exosomes from inducing the malignant phenotype. These results demonstrated that exosomal delivery of miR‑155‑5p may induce EMT and chemoresistant phenotypes from paclitaxel‑resistant gastric cancer cells to the sensitive cells, which may be mediated by GATA3 and TP53INP1 suppression. Targeting miR‑155‑5p may thus be a promising strategy to overcome paclitaxel resistance in gastric cancer.
Cancer stem cells (CSCs) have been reported in a variety of cancers. SRY-box 2 (SOX2) is a member of the SOX family of transcription factors and has been shown to play a critical role in maintaining the functions of CSCs and promoting tumor initiation. However, the underlying mechanisms for the transcriptional regulation of the SOX2 gene in CSCs are unclear. In this study, using in silico and experimental approaches, we identified transcriptional repressor GATA binding 1 (TRPS1), an atypical GATA-type transcription factor, as a critical transcriptional regulator that represses SOX2 expression and thereby suppresses cancer stemness and tumorigenesis. Mechanistically, TRPS1 repressed SOX2 expression by directly targeting the consensus GATA-binding element in the SOX2 promoter as elucidated by ChIP and luciferase reporter assays. Of note, in vitro mammosphere formation assays in culture and in vivo xenograft tumor initiation experiments in mouse models revealed that TRPS1-mediated repression of SOX2 expression suppresses CSC functions and tumor initiation. Taken together, our study provides detailed mechanistic insights into CSC functions and tumor initiation by the TRPS1-SOX2 axis.
Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a risk factor for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). HBV X protein (HBx) is an important carcinogen for HBV-induced HCC. When the HBx gene is integrated into the host cell genome, it is difficult to eradicate. The identification of an effective target to inhibit the oncogenic function of HBx is therefore critically important. The present study demonstrated that HBx, particularly truncated HBx, was expressed in several HBV-derived cell lines (e.g., Hep3B and SNU423). By analyzing data from The Cancer Genome Atlas, it was revealed that high expression of high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) was associated with the process and prognosis of HCC. In vitro experiments confirmed that HBx could regulate the expression of HMGB1 and knockdown of HMGB1 could decrease the ability of HBx to promote cellular proliferation. HBx could also upregulate six transcription factors (GATA binding protein 3, Erb-B2 receptor tyrosine kinase 3, heat shock transcription factor 1, nuclear factor κB subunit 1, TATA-box binding protein and Kruppel-like factor 4), which could directly regulate HMGB1. By analyzing genes that are co-expressed with HMGB1, several signaling pathways associated with the development of HCC were identified. HBx and HMGB1 were revealed to be involved in these pathways, which may be the mechanism by which HBx promotes HCC by regulating HMGB1. These findings suggested that HMGB1 may be an effective target for inhibiting HBV-induced HCC.
Fluorine is an essential trace element to which humans and animals are exposed through water, food, air and products used for dental health. Numerous studies have reported the detrimental effects of fluoride on testicular function and fertility; however, the underlying mechanisms of testosterone biosynthesis remain unclear. In this study, Leydig cells, the primary cells responsible for the production and regulation of steroid hormones in the testis, were used to elicit effects of sodium fluoride on the steroidogenic pathway. Leydig cells were treated with 0, 0.1, 1, 10 and 100 mg/L sodium fluoride for 24 h, respectively. The result of the study showed that sodium fluoride significantly decreased cell viability and cell proliferation, increased cell cytotoxicity and decreased the amounts of testosterone and 3',5'-cyclic adenosine monophosphate levels in a concentration-dependent manner. Also, these results indicated that NaF suppressed the expression of steroidogenic genes (steroidogenic acute regulatory protein, cholesterol side-chain cleavage enzyme, 3β-hydroxy dehydrogenase type I and 17β-hydroxy dehydrogenase type III) and proteins (luteinizing hormone receptor, cholesterol side-chain cleavage enzyme, 3β-hydroxy dehydrogenase), by changing the mRNA expression levels of the transcription factors (steroidogenic factor-1, GATA binding protein-4, nerve growth factor IB and nuclear receptor subfamily 0 group B member 1).
Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) induce mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET) and enhance the generation of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). However, BMPs are also signaling molecules critical for arresting reprogramming in the pre-iPSC state. In this study, using mouse embryonic fibroblasts, we found that the time- and concentration-dependent effects of BMPs on reprogramming are mediated by Msh homeobox 2 (MSX2), a homeobox-containing transcription factor. BMPs up-regulated Msx2 by activating SMAD1/5, and MSX2 then directly bound to the promoters and up-regulated the expression of the cadherin 1 (Cdh1, also known as E-cadherin), GATA-binding protein 3 (Gata3), and Nanog genes. Cdh1 contributed to BMP4- and MSX2-induced MET and subsequently promoted reprogramming. On the other hand, GATA3 promoted reprogramming, possibly by up-regulating Spalt-like transcription factor 4 (SALL4) expression. As key transcriptional factors in maintaining pluripotency, up-regulation of SALL4 and NANOG enhanced reprogramming. Moreover, the ability of MSX2 to up-regulate Cdh1, Gata3, Nanog, and Sall4 was further potentiated in the presence of Krüppel-like factor 4 (KLF4). However, MSX2 did not mediate the effects of BMP4 signaling on activation of the microRNAs miR-205 and miR-200 or the inhibitory effects that arrested reprogramming in the pre-iPSC state. In conclusion, MSX2 partially mediates the effects of BMP4 signaling during reprogramming, improving our understanding of the role of BMP signaling in MET and of the connection between cell lineage specifiers such as MSX2 and GATA3 and pluripotency.
Nuclear receptor subfamily 4 group A member 1 (NR4A1) is an orphan nuclear receptor with diverse functions. It has been reported that NR4A1, as a transcriptional activator, is implicated in glucose and lipid metabolism. The aim of this study was to investigate the regulatory role of NR4A1 in adipogenesis and explore the underlying mechanisms. Quantitative real-time PCR and Western blotting were used to analyse the expression of genes involved in synthesis and mobilization of fats in vivo and in vitro. Dual-luciferase reporter assay was conducted to study the regulatory mechanisms of NR4A1. Our data from in vivo study confirmed that NR4A1 knockout (KO) mice fed with high-fat diet were more prone to obesity, and gene expression levels of PPARγ and FAS were increased in KO mice compared to controls; our data from in vitro study showed that NR4A1 overexpression in 3T3-L1 pre-adipocytes inhibited adipogenesis. Moreover, NR4A1 enhanced GATA binding protein 2 (GATA2) expression, which in turn inhibited peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ); NR4A1 inhibited sterol regulatory element binding transcription factor 1 (SREBP1) and its downstream gene fatty acid synthase (FAS) by up-regulating p53. NR4A1 inhibits the differentiation and lipid accumulation of adipocytes by enhancing the expression of GATA2 and p53.
Objective- To identify the transcription factors that could contribute to direct reprogramming of fibroblasts toward smooth muscle cell fate. Approach and Results- We screened various combinations of transcription factors, including Myocd (myocardin), Mef2C (myocyte enhancer factor 2C), Mef2B (myocyte enhancer factor 2B), Mkl1 (MKL [megakaryoblastic leukemia]/Myocd-like 1), Gata4 (GATA-binding protein 4), Gata5 (GATA-binding protein 5), Gata6 (GATA-binding protein 6), Ets1 (E26 avian leukemia oncogene 1, 5' domain), and their corresponding carboxyterminal fusions to the transactivation domain of MyoD (myogenic differentiation 1)-indicated by *-for their effects on reprogramming mouse embryonic fibroblasts and human adult dermal fibroblasts to the smooth muscle cell fate as determined by the expression of specific markers. The combination of 3 transcription factors, Myocd (or Myocd*) with Mef2C (or Mef2C*) and Gata6, was the most efficient in enhancing the expression of smooth muscle marker genes and decreasing fibroblast gene expression. Additionally, the derived induced smooth muscle-like cells showed a contractile phenotype in response to carbachol. Conclusions- Combination of Myocd and Gata6 with Mef2C* (MG2*) could sufficiently and efficiently direct differentiation of mouse embryonic and human dermal fibroblasts into induced smooth muscle-like cells, thus opening new opportunities for disease modeling, tissue engineering, and personalized medicine.
A DNA region (site II) in the promoter of the human A gamma-globin gene (-182 to -168) is involved in transcriptional regulation. At least two nuclear proteins bind to this region: the erythroid-specific factor NF-E1/GF-1 and another factor present in many cell lines. In the present study, we demonstrate that the ubiquitous factor binding to site II has immunological identity with the octamer transcription factor OTF-1, which has been implicated in the regulation of expression of genes such as histone H2b and small nuclear RNA. In addition, we show that OTF-1 binds to site I (-291 to -267), a purine-rich region upstream of site II. Interestingly, OTF-1 binds to sites I and II with equal affinity. This was unexpected since the 14 bp site I binding site AAGAATAAATTAGA (-291 to -278), determined by methylation interference, does not show obvious similarities to the canonical octamer binding site for OTF-1 in site II (ATGCAAAT). Interaction of OTF-1 with functionally active binding sites in the gamma-globin promoter suggests that this factor has a role in gamma-globin transcription.
We show that expression in fibroblasts of a single cDNA, encoding the erythroid DNA-binding protein Eryf1 (GF-1, NF-E1), very efficiently activates transcription of a chicken alpha-globin promoter, trans-Activation in these cells occurred when Eryf1 bound to a single site within a minimal globin promoter. In contrast, efficient activation in erythroid cells required multiple Eryf1 binding sites. Our results indicate that mechanisms exist that are capable of modulating the trans-acting capabilities of Eryf1 in a cell-specific manner, without affecting DNA binding. The response of the minimal globin promoter to Eryf1 in fibroblasts was at least as great as for optimal constructions in erythroid cells. Therefore, the assay provides a very simple and sensitive system with which to study gene activation by a tissue-specific factor.
The zinc-finger transcription factor GATA-1 (previously known as GF-1, NF-E1 or Eryf 1 binds to GATA consensus elements in regulatory regions of the alpha- and beta-globin gene clusters and other erythroid cell-specific genes. Analysis of the effects of mutations in GATA-binding sites in cell culture and in binding assays in vitro, as well as transactivation studies with GATA-1 expression vectors in heterologous cells, have provided indirect evidence that this factor is involved in the activation of globin and other genes during erythroid cell maturation. GATA-1 is also expressed in megakaryocytes and mast cells, but not in other blood cell lineages or in non-haemopoietic cells. To investigate the role of this factor in haematopoiesis in vivo, we disrupted the X-linked GATA-1 gene by homologous recombination in a male (XY) murine embryonic stem cell line and tested the GATA-1-deficient cells for their ability to contribute to different tissues in chimaeric mice. The mutant embryonic stem cells contributed to all non-haemopoietic tissues tested and to a white blood cell fraction, but failed to give rise to mature red blood cells. This demonstrates that GATA-1 is required for the normal differentiation of erythroid cells, and that other GATA-binding proteins cannot compensate for its absence.
We have studied the elements involved in the tetradecanoylphorbol acetate (TPA)-mediated extinction of erythroid-specific genes. We show that transcription driven by a -714/+78-base pair DNA fragment of the erythroid promoter of the human porphobilinogen deaminase gene is down-regulated upon TPA treatment of erythroleukemic cells. Examination of the DNA binding activity of trans-acting factors involved in the expression of the porphobilinogen deaminase erythroid promoter showed (i) a constitutive expression of the CACC binding proteins and (ii) a decrease in DNA binding activity of two tissue-specific factors, NF-E1 and NF-E2. Kinetics experiments indicated that NF-E2 was down-regulated after 1 h of TPA treatment whereas NF-E1 was down-regulated at the protein and mRNA levels only after 5 h of TPA treatment. These results suggest that different pathways, acting via different transcription factors, are involved in the TPA-mediated extinction of erythroid-specific genes.
We have isolated and characterized the murine genomic and complementary DNAs encoding erythropoietin (Epo) receptor from Epo-responsive and unresponsive mouse erythroleukemia cells. Two classes of Epo receptor cDNAs were isolated from Epo-responsive cells. One is a 55,000 Mr membrane-bound Epo receptor, and the other is a 29,000 Mr soluble Epo receptor lacking the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains. As a result of alternative splicing, two insert sequences containing termination codons are produced, and the encoded polypeptide diverges four amino acids upstream from the transmembrane domain, adding 20 new amino acids before terminating. Amino acid sequence of the Epo receptor cDNA isolated from Epo-responsive cells was identical with that of Epo-unresponsive cells, indicating that Epo-responsiveness does not depend upon the primary structure of the Epo receptor (binding) protein. Analysis of 6.6 x 10(3) base-pairs (kb) genomic DNA segments covering complete Epo receptor gene and promoter regions revealed that potential regulatory elements (NF-E1, GF-1 or Eryf 1) for erythroid-specific and differentiation stage-specific gene expression are located in the promoter and 3' noncoding regions.
We used mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells to study globin gene expression and switching in vitro. We show that ES-derived embryoid bodies express the full complement of mouse embryonic globin genes in the correct temporal order and that on further differentiation, a switch occurs to the fetal/adult genes. In addition, the erythroid-specific transcription factor NF-E1 was shown to be expressed coordinately with that of globin in embryoid bodies. We conclude from these experiments that the ES cell system provides a good model to study hematopoietic development. When the human epsilon- or beta-globin genes driven by the dominant control region (DCR) are introduced into this system, the human epsilon-globin gene, in contrast to the beta-globin gene, is not deregulated by the presence of the DCR and is expressed strictly as an embryonic gene. We conclude from this that the epsilon-globin gene is not regulated by competition with other genes in the human beta-globin locus.
The murine, erythroid DNA-binding protein GF-1 (also known as NF-E1, Eryf 1), a 413-amino acid polypeptide with two novel finger domains of the Cx-Cx variety, recognizes a consensus GATA motif present in cis elements of the majority of erythroid-expressed genes. We have performed a structure-function analysis of this protein to evaluate its potential as a transcriptional activator and to examine the role of the finger domains in DNA binding. Using a cotransfection assay, we find that GF-1 is a potent transcriptional activator with several activation domains but that this is revealed only in heterologous cells and with reporters containing minimal promoters onto which either a single or multiple GATA-binding sites are placed. The two fingers of GF-1 are functionally distinct and cooperate to achieve specific, stable DNA binding. The amino finger is necessary only for full specificity and stability of binding, whereas the carboxyl finger is required for binding. The role of each finger is more pronounced with some GATA-binding sites than with others, suggesting a diversity of interactions between GF-1 and different target sites. The complex activation and DNA-binding properties of GF-1 are likely to contribute to the ability of this single protein to participate widely in gene expression throughout erythroid development.
We have previously purified four factors (alpha-IRP, alpha-CP1, alpha-CP2, and NF-E1) that interact with the promoter of the alpha-globin gene. One of these (NF-E1) is a tissue-restricted factor that has recently been cloned. The binding sites of these factors identify DNA sequence elements that might mediate the tissue-specific and inducible transcription of the alpha-globin gene. This possibility was tested in a series of in vitro transcription experiments. An examination of 5' truncated templates and synthetic promoters constituted from individual factor-binding sites apposed to the alpha-TATAA box showed that the binding elements of three factors (alpha-CP1, alpha-IRP, and NF-E1) mediate four- to sixfold activation of transcription in vitro. In contrast, one element (alpha-CP2) stimulated transcription less than twofold. The 5- to 10-fold stimulation of these latter templates upon addition of a DNA sequence affinity-purified factor suggests that alpha-CP2 is functionally limiting in nuclear extracts. Additional experiments further tested the effect of supplementing extracts with factors purified from erythroid cell nuclear extracts or, in the case of NF-E1, enriched from a bacterial cDNA expression system. Each factor tested stimulated transcription in vitro in a binding-site-dependent manner. Our results provide a comprehensive functional view of the murine alpha-globin promoter and suggest possible mechanisms for activation of alpha-globin gene transcription during induced differentiation of murine erythroleukemia cells.
The areA gene, mediating nitrogen metabolite repression in Aspergillus nidulans, encodes a positive-acting regulatory protein with a single putative DNA-binding 'zinc finger' which is remarkably similar to the two 'zinc fingers' of the major regulatory protein of vertebrate erythroid cells (GF-1/Eryf1/NF-E1). The areA-300 mutation alters the specificity of gene activation in that it elevates expression of certain structural genes whilst reducing expression of certain others. It is an 'in-frame' tandem duplication of 417 bp including the entire DNA-binding region. The consequences of areA didactyly are further explored by construction of a double mutant having an altered loop residue in the N-terminal 'finger'.
NF-E1, a DNA-binding protein that recognizes the general consensus motif WGATAR, is the first tissue-specific factor to be identified in erythroid cells. Using a probe from the murine GF-1 (NF-E1) cDNA clone, we isolated three homologous chicken cDNAs: One of these corresponds to an mRNA (NF-E1a) that is abundantly and exclusively expressed in erythroid cells; a second mRNA (NF-E1b) is also expressed in all developmental stages of erythroid cells but is additionally found in a limited subset of other chicken tissues; mRNA representative of a third gene (NF-E1c) is expressed only in definitive (adult) erythrocytes within the red cell lineage but is also abundantly expressed in T lymphocytes and brain. All NF-E1 proteins are highly conserved within the DNA-binding domain and bind to the consensus motif with similar affinities in vitro; they are also all stimulatory trans-acting factors in vivo. The factors differ quantitatively in their ability to trans-activate reporter genes in which the number and position of cognate binding sites is varied relative to the transcriptional initiation site. These data suggest that the NF-E1 consensus motif directs a broader and more complicated array of developmental transcriptional regulatory processes than has been assumed and that NF-E1c may play a unique regulatory role in the developing chicken brain and in T lymphocytes.
The protein-DNA interactions of the upstream promoter region of the human embryonic zeta-globin gene in nuclear extracts of erythroid K562 cells and nonerythroid HeLa cells were analyzed by DNase I footprinting, gel mobility shift assay, methylation interference, and oligonucleotide competition experiments. There are mainly two clusters of nuclear factor-binding sites in the zeta promoter. The proximal cluster spans the DNA sequence from -110 to -60 and consists of binding sites for CP2, Sp1, and NF-E1. NF-E1 binding is K562 specific, whereas CP2 binding is common to both types of cells. Overlapping the NF-E1- and CP2-binding sites is a hidden Sp1-binding site or CAC box, as demonstrated by binding studies of affinity-purified Sp1. In the distal promoter region at -250 to -220, another NF-E1-binding site overlaps a CAC box or Sp1-binding site. Extract-mixing experiments demonstrated that the higher affinity of NF-E1 binding excluded the binding of Sp1 in the K562 extract. NF-E1 factors could also displace prebound Sp1 molecules. Between the two clusters of multiple-factor-binding sites are sequences recognized by other factors, including zeta-globin factors 1 and 2, that are present in both HeLa and K562 extracts. We discuss the cell type-specific, competitive binding of multiple nuclear factors in terms of functional implications in transcriptional regulation of the zeta-globin gene.
Genes expressed in erythroid cells contain binding sites for a cell-specific nuclear factor, GF-1 (NF-E1, Eryf 1), believed to be an important transcriptional regulator. Previously we characterized murine GF-1 as a 413-amino acid polypeptide containing two cysteine-cysteine regions reminiscent of zinc-finger DNA-binding domains. By cross-hybridization to the finger domain of murine GF-1 we have isolated cDNA encoding the human homolog. Peptide sequencing of purified human GF-1 confirmed the authenticity of the human cDNA. The predicted primary sequence of human GF-1 is highly similar to that of murine GF-1, particularly in the DNA-binding region. Although the DNA-binding domains of human, murine, and chicken proteins are remarkably conserved, the mammalian polypeptides are strikingly divergent from the avian counterpart in other regions, most likely those responsible for transcriptional activation. By hybridization to panels of human-rodent DNAs we have assigned the human GF-1 locus to Xp21-11. The localization of the gene to the X chromosome has important implications for hereditary persistence of fetal hemoglobin syndromes unlinked to the beta-globin cluster and for genetic experiments designed to test the role of the factor in erythroid cell gene expression.
Glycophorin C (GPC) is an integral membrane protein of human erythrocytes which plays an important role in regulating the deformability and mechanical stability of red cells. Recently, the structural gene for this glycoprotein has been cloned (Colin, Y., Le Van Kim, C., Tsapis, A., Clerget, M., d'Auriol, L., London, J., Galibert, F., and Cartron, J. P. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 3773-3780), and we have now determined the sequence of the 1050 base pairs of DNA preceding the transcription initiation site mapped in erythroid cells. This region contains different potential regulatory cis-acting elements found in a variety of eukaryotic promoters (TATA box, CAAT box, Sp1-binding site) as well as sequences present in the promoter and enhancer regions of genes specific for the erythroid lineage (CACCC box and NF-E1-binding site). Northern blot analysis and immunological studies indicate that the GPC gene is expressed in a large number of cells and tissues. However, the level of transcription as well as the glycosylation of the mature GPC differ in erythroid and nonerythroid cells. Primer extension analysis and mapping of the 5' end GPC mRNA by the polymerase chain reaction indicate that different transcription sites are utilized for the expression of the GPC gene in erythroid and nonerythroid tissues and cell lines.
We have studied the erythroid-specific promoter of the human gene coding for Porphobilinogen Deaminase (PBGD) by DNaseI footprinting, gel retardation and methylation interference assays. We show that this promoter, which is inducible during MEL cell differentiation, contains three binding sites for the erythroid-specific factor NF-E1 and one site for a second erythroid-specific factor, which we name NF-E2. NF-E1 is a factor that also binds the promoter and the enhancer (present in the 3' flanking region) of the human beta-globin gene. NF-E2 has not yet been described and although it binds to a sequence containing the Ap1 consensus, it appears to be different from Ap1.
We have shown that the promoter of the human beta-globin gene contains three regions in addition to the known CAC, CAAT and TATA box regions that are important for the induction of transcription in erythroid cells. By using DNaseI footprinting and gel mobility shift assays we were able to show that two of these regions bind the erythroid specific nuclear factor NF-E1 (and ubiquitous factors). The third region binds a ubiquitous CAAT-box factor (CP1). Deletion experiments suggest that only the combination of NF-E1 and CP1 binding sites, but not each of the sites alone, are capable of mediating the induction of transcription of a minimal (CAC, CAAT, TATA box) beta-globin promoter in mouse erythroleukaemia (MEL) cells.
We have shown that the minimal enhancer fragment present in the 3'-flanking region of the human beta-globin gene contains four regions that bind nuclear proteins in vitro. By using gel mobility shift and DNase I footprinting assays, we were able to show that each of these regions binds an erythroid-cell-specific nuclear factor which we name NF-E1. This factor is present in erythroid cells at different developmental stages of globin gene expression. The recognition sequence of this protein (A/C Py T/A ATC A/T Py) is also present in the intragenic enhancer and the promoter of the beta-globin gene as well as in the promoter of other erythroid-cell specific genes. In addition to NF-E1, each of the four binding regions interacts with at least one other protein factor.
The Dominant Control Region (DCR) of the human beta-globin gene locus consists of four strong hypersensitive sites (HSS) upstream of the epsilon-globin gene. Addition of these sites confers copy number dependent expression on the human beta-globin gene in murine erythroleukaemia cells and transgenic mice, at levels comparable with the endogenous mouse globin genes. We have shown previously that a 1.9 kb fragment comprising HSS 2 accounts for 40-50% of the full effect of the DCR. In this paper we describe a deletional analysis of HSS 2. We show that a 225 bp fragment is sufficient to direct high levels of expression of the human beta-globin gene which is copy number dependent and integration site independent. This 225 bp fragment overlaps the major region that is hypersensitive 'in vivo'. DNase I footprinting shows the presence of four binding sites for the erythroid specific protein NF-E1; the three other footprinted regions display a remarkable redundancy of the sequence GGTGG and bind a number of proteins including Sp1 and the CACC box protein. The significance of these results for the regulation of globin gene expression is discussed.
A 114-base-pair promoter fragment of the human porphobilinogen deaminase gene functioned in an erythroid-specific manner in transient transfection experiments. Site-directed mutagenesis of the binding site for the erythroid-specific transcription factor (NF-E1) or an adjacent CACCC motif abolished the promoter activity. Increasing the spacing between these sites progressively reduced promoter activity, but there was no evidence that a critical alignment of the two factors on the DNA helix was required.
Erythroid-specific genes contain binding sites for NF-E1 (also called GF-1 and Eryf-1; refs 1-3 respectively), the principal DNA-binding protein of the erythrocytic lineage. NF-E1 expression seems to be restricted to the erythrocytic lineage. A closely related (if not identical) protein is found in both a human megakaryocytic cell line and purified human megakaryocytes; it binds to promoter regions of two megakaryocytic-specific genes. The binding sites and partial proteolysis profile of this protein are indistinguishable from those of the erythroid protein; also, NF-E1 messenger RNA is the same size in both the megakaryocytic and erythroid cell lines. Furthermore, point mutations that abolish binding of NF-E1 result in a 70% decrease in the transcriptional activity of a megakaryocytic-specific promoter. We also find that NF-E2, another trans-acting factor of the erythrocytic lineage, is present in megakaryocytes. Transcriptional effects in both lineages might then be mediated in part by the same specific trans-acting factors. Our data strengthen the idea of a close association between the erythrocytic and the megakaryocytic lineages and could also explain the expression of markers specific to the erythrocytic and megakaryocytic lineages in most erythroblastic and megakaryoblastic permanent cell lines.
The nuclear factor GF-1 (also known as NF-E1, Eryf-1; refs 1-3 respectively) is important in regulation of the transcription of globin and other genes that are specifically expressed in erythroid cells. We have previously shown that GF-1 of both mouse and human origin is a 413-amino-acid polypeptide with two novel zinc-finger domains whose expression is restricted to erythroid cells. Using in situ hybridization of mouse bone marrow cells and northern blot analysis of purified cell populations and permanent cell lines, we show here that GF-1 is expressed in two other hematopoietic lineages, megakaryocytes and bone marrow-derived mast cells. Our findings are consistent with results from hematopoietic progenitor culture which suggest a relationship between erythroid, megakaryocytic and mast cell lineages, and imply that GF-1 is expressed in committed multipotential cells and their progeny. Hence, the mere presence of this transcription factor is unlikely to be sufficient to programme differentiation of a single haematopoietic lineage. GF-1 may regulate the transcription of not only erythroid genes, but also many genes characteristic of megakaryocytes and mast cells, or genes shared among these lineages.
Vertebrate erythroid cells contain a tissue-specific transcription factor referred to as Eryf 1 (ref. 1), GF-1 (ref. 2) or NF-E1 (ref. 3), for which binding sites are widely distributed in the promoters and enhancers of the globin gene family, and of other erythroid-specific genes. Aberrant binding of the human factor to a mutant site has been implicated in one form of hereditary persistence of fetal haemoglobin (HPFH; ref. 2). The complementary DNAs for both the chicken cEryf 1 (ref. 11) and mouse mEryf 1 (ref. 12) encoding genes have recently been cloned. We report here the cloning of the cDNA for the human Eryf 1 encoding gene. The central third of the hEryf 1 cDNA, containing two 'finger' motifs, is almost identical to that of chicken or mouse. The amino-and carboxy-terminal thirds of the human protein are similar to those of mouse, but are strikingly different from the corresponding domains in chicken. The evidence indicates that these erythroid regulatory factors evolved from a common precursor composed of two distinct kinds of repeated domains, which subsequently evolved at greatly different rates.
Murine intracisternal A-particle long terminal repeats contain an intracisternal A-particle upstream enhancer (IUE) element that binds to a 65-kDa IUE binding protein (IUEB) present in both undifferentiated F9 embryonal carcinoma cells and differentiated parietal endoderm-like PYS-2 cells. This IUE element confers a CpG methylation-sensitive IUEB binding and enhancer activity. Using gel retardation, methylation interference, CpG methylation sensitivity binding, and cotransfection assays, we have now identified the 65-kDa IUEB as YY1 (also called NF-E1, delta, or UCRBP), a zinc finger protein related to the Krüppel family. YY1 binds to a number of similar but distinct DNA motifs, and cotransfection assays indicate that these motifs have different enhancer potentials in PYS-2 cells. The relative strengths of these elements are as follows: IUE &gt; kappa E3' from the human immunoglobulin kappa light-chain 3' enhancer &gt; upstream conserved region from the Moloney murine leukemia virus promoter. Results of DNA binding assays suggest that the differences in enhancer potentials are due to the different binding affinities of YY1 to the various motifs and the binding of two other transcription factors to the IUE sequence.
The mouse gene that encodes the delta transcription factor has been cloned and characterized. This gene spans 23 kb and is composed of five exons and four introns. The first exon consists of a long (431 bp), (C+G)-rich, untranslated segment and a 679-bp coding segment, which specifies the unusual tracts of consecutive acidic residues and histidines and the long alanine-glycine stretches. The sequence that encodes the four zinc-finger motifs of this protein is interrupted by two introns. Nuclease protection experiments revealed a major transcriptional start point and several additional start points distributed over a 28-bp segment. Transfection experiments with 5' and 3' deletion mutants localized the promoter to a (C+G)-rich region that is &lt; 700 bp upstream and no more than 32 bp downstream of the major start point. An especially critical promoter element lies between -58 and -18 and contains a high-affinity Sp1 binding site, as demonstrated by electrophoretic mobility-shift experiments with nuclear extract and recombinant Sp1 proteins. Several striking similarities between the delta gene and genes encoding other transcription factors and regulatory proteins are noted and discussed with respect to their possible biological significance.
Sequence-specific DNA binding has been demonstrated for a synthetic peptide comprising only one of the two "finger"-like domains of the erythroid transcription factor GATA-1 (also termed Eryf-1, NF-E1, or GF-1). Quantitative analysis of gel-retardation assays yields a specific association constant of 1.2 x 10(8) M, compared with values of about 10(9) M for the full-length natural GATA-1 protein. By the use of peptides of various lengths, it was possible to delineate the smallest region necessary for specific binding. A single C-terminal finger of the double-finger motif is necessary but not sufficient for sequence-specific interaction. Basic amino acids located C-terminal to the finger (some more than 20 amino acids away) are also essential for tight binding. In addition to demonstrating that zinc is important for the formation of an active binding complex, we show that other ions, notably Fe2+, can fulfill this role. Our results make it clear that the GATA-1 metal binding motif is quite distinct from that found in the steroid hormone family and that GATA-1 is a member of a separate class of DNA binding proteins.
We have mapped the basal promoter activity of the mouse cytochrome c oxidase (COX) subunit Vb gene to the -17 to +20 region which contains two putative ets binding sites flanking an NF-E1 site fused to an Sp1 site. A 17-nucleotide sequence flanking the major transcription start site (-8 to +9), referred to as 17Inr (initiator sequence) was able to drive CAT activity in 3T3 cells to a level comparable to the construct containing sequences -17 to +20. This suggests that the 17Inr sequence contains the initiator activity. The 17Inr contains a pyrimidine-rich sequence, commencing with a CA that corresponds to the major transcription start site. Primer extension of RNA from transfected cells demonstrated that transcription initiation with the 17Inr template occurs at a site identical to the endogenous gene. DNA-protein binding by gel mobility shift and methylation interference analyses indicated that the pyrimidine-rich sequence immediately flanking the transcription start site consists of an NF-E1 factor binding motif with an overlapping upstream Sp1 binding site. A 13-nucleotide sequence, 13Inr (-4 to +9), which retains the NF-E1 binding activity but does not bind Sp1, was able to promote chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene expression at levels similar to the 17Inr sequence, suggesting that NF-E1 factor binding is critical for initiator function. Finally, using an in vitro transcription system from Drosophila embryos we demonstrate that NF-E1 is necessary for transcription activation of both the 17Inr and the 13Inr initiator templates. Thus NF-E1 binding appears to be important for basal promoter function of the mouse COXVb gene.
Muscle-restricted transcription of the skeletal alpha-actin gene is controlled in part by a positive regulator, serum response factor (SRF), and a negative regulator, F-ACT1, which bind competitively to the most proximal serum response element (SRE1). We show here that F-ACT1 is identical to a transcription factor recently cloned and described as YY1, NF-E1, delta, or UCRBP. We found that although the DNA-binding activity of SRF accumulates during myogenesis, that of YY1 diminishes simultaneously. Myoblasts rendered incapable of differentiation by BrdUrd treatment exhibited the highest level of YY1 and the lowest level of SRF activities. Transfected SRF could directly transactivate the skeletal alpha-actin promoter by overcoming the inhibitory effect of BrdUrd-induced YY1. The transactivation depends on intact SRE DNA elements and requires the DNA-binding/dimerization domain of SRF as well as its C-terminal half rich in serines and threonines. Since the functions of YY1 and SRF appear to be developmentally regulated, the convergence of their binding sites upon the SRE constitutes an integrated mechanism whereby temporal and spatial muscle gene expression may be accomplished.
The purpose of this investigation was to identify and characterize the regulatory elements involved in the transcriptional activation of the beta gamma (leaky-late or gamma 1) genes of herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) by using the major capsid protein (VP5 or ICP5) gene as model. Gel mobility shift assays with nuclear extracts from uninfected and infected HeLa cells enabled us to identify two major protein-DNA complexes involving the VP5 promoter. The mobilities of these two complexes remained unaltered, and no unique complexes were observed when infected cell nuclear extracts were used. DNase I and orthophenanthroline-Cu+ footprint analyses revealed that the two complexes involve a single binding site, GGCCATCTTGAA, located between -64 and -75 bp relative to the VP5 cap site. To determine the function of this leaky-late binding site (LBS) in VP5 gene activation, we tested the effect of mutations in this region by using transient expression of a cis-linked chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene. Deletion of the above sequence resulted in a seven- to eightfold reduction in the level of transactivation of the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene by superinfection with HSV-1 or by cotransfection of HSV-1 immediate-early genes. From these results, we conclude that the LBS sequence and a cellular factor(s) are involved in the transactivation of the VP5 gene. A search of published gene sequences revealed that sequences related to the LBS exist in a number of other HSV-1, cytomegalovirus, retrovirus, and cellular promoters. Sequence homologies of binding sites and results of unpublished competition binding studies suggest that this leaky-late binding factor may be related to, or the same as, a ubiquitous cellular transcriptional factor called YY1 or common factor-1 (also known as NF-E1, delta, and UCRBP).
We have determined that the developmental control of immunoglobulin kappa 3' enhancer (kappa E3') activity is the result of the combined influence of positive- and negative-acting elements. We show that a central core in the kappa E3' enhancer is active at the pre-B-cell stage but is repressed by flanking negative-acting elements. The negative-acting sequences repress enhancer activity in a position- and orientation-independent manner at the pre-B-cell stage. We have isolated a human cDNA clone encoding a zinc finger protein (NF-E1) that binds to the negative-acting segment of the kappa E3' enhancer. This protein also binds to the immunoglobulin heavy-chain enhancer mu E1 site. NF-E1 is encoded by the same gene as the YY-1 protein, which binds to the adeno-associated virus P5 promoter. NF-E1 is also the human homologue of the mouse delta protein, which binds to ribosomal protein gene promoters. The predicted amino acid sequence of this protein contains features characteristic of transcriptional activators as well as transcriptional repressors. Cotransfection studies with this cDNA indicate that it can repress basal promoter activity. The apparent dual function of this protein is discussed.
The human GATA1, hGATA1 (previously called NF-E1, GF-1 or Eryf-1), a major sequence-specific DNA-binding protein of the erythrocytic lineage, is a member of a zinc-finger family of DNA-binding proteins. We report here the cloning of a human cDNA for a new member of this family. This member, called hGATA3, has 85% amino acid homology with hGATA1 in the DNA-binding domain and no homology elsewhere in the protein. Unlike hGATA1, hGATA3 is not localized on the X chromosome and we map it to the 10p15 band of the human genome. Northern blot analysis indicates that this factor is a T-cell specific transcription factor, present before activation and up-regulated during T-cell activation. The encoded hGATA3 protein, made in an in vitro transcription-translation assay, binds the WGATAR motif present in the human T-cell receptor (TCR) delta gene enhancer and, by transfection in HeLa cells, we show that hGATA3 can transactivate this TCR delta gene enhancer. Interestingly this enhancer binds and is also transactivated by hGATA1. Conversely, the promoter of the human glycophorin B (GPB), which is erythroid-specific and contains two WGATAR motifs, binds and is transactivated by hGATA1 and, to a lesser extent, by hGATA3. These results indicate that the activation of specific genes by hGATA1 or hGATA3 is partly governed by the lineage expression of these two factors during haematopoiesis and that, in the T-cell lineage, hGATA3 binds the human TCR delta gene enhancer and is involved in its expression.
The promoter of the human gamma-globin gene confers tissue specificity as well as developmental stage specificity to gamma gene expression. Earlier work in our laboratory suggested that a fragment of the gamma-globin promoter between -300 and -137 base pairs upstream of the transcription start site contributed to the developmental specificity of the promoter. In this paper, we have mapped potential regulatory elements within this upstream region of the gamma promoter by a combination of in vitro DNA-protein binding assays and functional determinations of promoter strength in transient expression studies. Four sites between -300 and -130 bind proteins present in nuclear extracts of erythroid and non-erythroid cell lines. Mutation of these binding sites by internal base substitution determined that three of the four influence overall promoter strength in transient assays. We have focused on two protein binding sites, -246 to -212 and -195 to -170, that have been reported to bind erythroid-specific factors. The erythroid binding protein NF-E1 and a ubiquitous octamer protein footprint the -195 to -170 site. While internal mutation of this site did not significantly alter promoter strength, a point mutation at position -175 that is associated with hereditary persistence of fetal hemoglobin increased the activity of a promoter construct 20-fold in erythroid cells. A detailed mutational analysis of this site suggests that NF-E1 binding is necessary but not sufficient for activation of the promoter by the -175 mutation, and we propose that a second protein or co-activator is required. The nucleotides between -246 and -212 appear to bind a complex of at least three proteins, at the core of which is a protein binding to a string of dA:dT residues. This complex also appears to form on the 3' A gamma-globin enhancer, and homologous sites have been identified within the locus activating region of the beta-globin cluster, suggesting that this element may mediate long range interactions with distant regulatory elements.
DNA sequences 179 base pairs upstream and 23 base pairs downstream of the cap site of human embryonic epsilon globin gene exhibit promoter activity in transfected cell cultures. The nuclear factor binding in vitro of this epsilon promoter region was studied by DNase I foot-printing, methylation interference, and gel mobility shift assay. Four major nuclear factor-binding sites are detected in complexes formed with unfractionated nuclear extracts: NF-E1 at -163, epsilon F1 at -143, CACC box at -111, and CBF at -81, respectively. Of these, NF-E1 is an erythroid-specific factor. epsilon F1 is probably a ubiquitous factor because it is present in both erythroid K562 cells and nonerythroid HeLa cells. The epsilon F1-binding site exhibits sequence similarity to that of the cAMP response element-binding protein family of transcription factors. Finally, the CCAAT box-binding protein (CBF)-binding site centers around the CCAAT promoter box. Comparative binding studies with unfractionated nuclear extracts and affinity purified HeLa Sp1 demonstrated that the epsilon-globin CACC box at -111 is a binding site of Sp1. The spatial arrangements of the NF-E1-binding site, the CACC box, and CCAAT box, with respect to their mutual separations by approximately integral numbers of helical turns, is well conserved in all mammalian embryonic epsilon globin promoters. Transient expression assay, using human growth hormone gene as the receptor, demonstrated that similar to the other two human beta-like globin genes (beta and gamma), the CACC box of epsilon globin gene is an essential promoter element for epsilon globin gene expression in vivo in K562 cells. This CACC promoter box also functions in vitro in nuclear extracts prepared from K562 cells. These data, together with Sp1-binding studies of the human beta and gamma globin CACC boxes, suggest that the general transcription factor Sp1, through its differential interactions with different forms of CACC promoter boxes, is an essential component of the machinery that controls the developmental program of mammalian globin gene regulation.
We have cloned the gene for the chicken erythroid transcription factor GATA-1 (formerly Eryf1, NF-E1, or GF-1). The gene is composed of six exons, two of which encode the two finger domains of the protein. Transcription of GATA-1 in chicken embryonic erythroid cells initiates from multiple sites clustered approximately 200 base pairs upstream from the start of protein-coding sequence. A number of sequence motifs for known DNA-binding proteins are found to be protected in DNase I-footprinting experiments by either erythroid or brain nuclear extracts or by both. Notably, a cluster of three GATA-1 sites is protected by the erythroid extract, as well as by purified GATA-1. We find that the upstream region of the gene functions as a powerful promoter when transfected into embryonic erythroid cells. In primary chicken embryo fibroblasts the promoter exhibits lower activity, which is increased when the cells are cotransfected with a second plasmid expressing the GATA-1 cDNA. The results suggest that GATA-1 protein plays an autoregulatory role in its own expression.
A 1.3 kb satellite DNA from a size defined genomic library of mammal Bubalus bubalis was cloned and sequenced. The clone pSB1 is AT rich with 447 A (33.6%), 262 C (19.7%), 240 G (19.0%) and 383 T (28.8%). There were about 1400 copies of contig in the bubaline genome but it did not uncover allele length variation when used as probe in conjunction with a number of restriction enzymes. The contig pSB1 is not conserved evolutionarily and cross hybridizes only with the Bovideae family. A set of primers from 5' (nt 422 to 441) and 3' (nt 962 to 947) deduced from the clone used for PCR amplification with four members of the Bovideae family gave the expected 530 bp band of equal intensity indicating a similar number of copies in all the four species namely Bos indicus, Capra hircus, Ovis aries and Bubalus bubalis. Expression studies with pSB1 following slot-blot hybridization with total RNA isolated from ovary, testes, kidney, lung and spleen revealed varying signal intensities in all the tissues with a most prominent signal in spleen but a faint one in ovary. Further sequence analysis revealed the presence of several eukaryotic transcriptional elements such as NF-E1, Poly-A signal, lariat consensus sequences, and CTF/NF1 binding sites. Blast search showed 90% sequence similarity with the reverse transcriptase gene of Bos taurus and sequences from nt 283 to 636 within the contig showed highly conserved reverse transcriptase like signatures along with N-glycosylation and protein kinase C phosphorylation sites. From the data we conclude that the pSB1 representing satellite DNA is associated with transcribing sequences. The prospect of identifying functional genes linked with the satellite fraction in higher vertebrates is discussed.
Our recent studies demonstrated a critical role of enhanced transcriptional activity of early growth response factor-1 (Egr-1) in early stages of cysteamine-induced duodenal ulcer in rats. Since cysteamine is also a reducing agent, the aims of this study were to determine the effect of cysteamine on proximal duodenal mucosa: (a) redox status, (b) mucosal oxygenation, (c) expression of hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1alpha) and its binding to DNA, and (d) HIF-1alpha interaction with Egr-1 and other redox-sensitive transcription factors. Here we demonstrate for the first time that cysteamine treatment reduced the duodenal oxygenation by 19% (vs. baseline) and markedly increased the redox status in duodenal mucosa (p&lt;0.05). Cysteamine increased HIF-1alpha expression, its binding to DNA, and enhanced the HIF-1alpha interactions with Egr-1 and other transcription factors (e.g., AP-1, AP-2, L-III BP, NF-E1, NF-E2, STAT4, and MRE), their binding to DNA. Thus, these data demonstrate the involvement of the redox-dependent regulatory mechanisms in the early stages of duodenal ulceration.
Bone sialoprotein (BSP) is a noncollagenous matrix glycoprotein localized predominantly in mineralized tissues but also detected in extraskeletal sites undergoing focal mineralization. We have previously characterized the human BSP gene and have shown that the upstream sequence contains inverted TATA and CCAAT motifs at the expected locations from the transcriptional start site (J. M. Kerr et al. [13]) and a potential YY1 binding motif located within the first 30 bp of intron 1 of the human gene. Deletion analyses of the human BSP promoter/exon 1 sequence fused to a CAT reporter gene indicate that CCAAT enhances basal transcription of BSP in transiently transfected rat UMR106-01 BSP osteosarcoma and rat skin fibroblasts. Though this enhancing activity was lost with inclusion of 68 bp of intron containing a YY1 motif in these constructs, reporter activity in the UMR106-01-BSP cells was elevated four- to seven-fold relative to that of rat fibroblasts. Gel electrophoretic mobility shift, UV-crosslinking, and south-western experiments indicate that YY1 is present only in the extracts of nuclei isolated from the UMR cells and may contribute to the elevated transcriptional activity of the human BSP promoter construct in UMR106-01-BSP.
A genomic clone comprising the entire cDNA sequence encoding a mouse kappa3-related opioid receptor (KOR-3) was isolated by screening a mouse genomic library with a radiolabeled mouse KOR-3 cDNA probe. Sequence analysis of the genomic clone indicates that the KOR-3 gene contains five exons separated by four introns. The transcription start point (tsp) of KOR-3 was mapped by primer extension analysis of RNAs synthesized either in vivo or in vitro. A TATA-box and several potential regulatory elements, including five GRE sites, four NF-E1 binding sites and one MRE site, are present in the 2 kb of 5'-flanking region. A putative poly(A) signal (AATAAA) is found in the 3'-flanking region.
Transcription of the mouse immunoglobulin kappa gene is controlled by two enhancers: the intronic enhancer (Ei) that occurs between the joining (J kappa) and constant (C kappa) exons and the 3' enhancer (E3') located 8.5 kb downstream of the gene. To understand the role of E3' in the activation of the mouse immunoglobulin kappa gene, we studied its chromatin structure in cultured B-cell lines arrested at various stages of differentiation. We found that 120 bp of the enhancer's transcriptional core becomes DNase I hypersensitive early in B-cell development. Genomic footprinting of pro-B and pre-B cells localized this chromatin alteration to B-cell-specific protections at the region including the direct repeat (DR) and the sequence downstream of the DR (DS), the PU.1-NFEM-5 site, and the core's E-box motif, identifying bound transcription factors prior to kappa gene rearrangement. Early footprints were, however, not detected at downstream sites proposed to play a negative role in transcription. The early chromatin structure persisted through the mature B-cell stage but underwent a dramatic shift in plasma cells, correlating with the loss of guanosine protection within the DR-DS junction and the appearance of novel footprints at a GC-rich motif upstream and the NF-E1 (YY1/delta)-binding site downstream. Gel shift analysis demonstrated that the DR-DS junction is bound by a factor with properties similar to those of BSAP (B-cell-specific activator protein). These results reveal developmental-stage-specific changes in the composition of nuclear factors bound to E3', clarify the role of factors that bind constitutively in vitro, and point to the differentiation of mature B cells to plasma cells as an important transitional point in the function of this enhancer. The observed changes in nuclear factor composition were accompanied by the rearrangement of positioned nucleosomes that flank the core region, suggesting a role for both nuclear factors and chromatin structure in modulating kappa E3' function during B-cell development. The functional implications of the observed chromatin alterations are discussed in the context of recent studies on kappa E3' and the factors that bind to it.
NF-D is a ubiquitous nuclear factor that has been shown to bind specifically to a DNA element in the polyomavirus regulatory region. In this report, we demonstrate that NF-D is either identical or very similar to a transcription factor that has been variously named YY1, delta, NF-E1, UCRBP, or CF1. Moreover, we show the presence in the polyomavirus genome of a second DNA motif, located 40 bp from the first, which binds YY1/NF-D with high affinity. Both sites lie downstream of the major late transcription initiation sites. By site-directed mutagenesis, we demonstrate that both elements contribute positively to the activity of the late promoter, probably by a cooperative mechanism. We also demonstrate that the requirement of the YY1/NF-D function for late promoter activity varies with the cell line.
A previously unrecognized element, located downstream of the start site of transcription in the first exon of the DR alpha gene, has been defined that enhances promoter activity up to eightfold in a position-dependent manner. Mutations in this DNA-binding site abolished binding of a nuclear factor in human B cell nuclear extract and decreased the activity of the DR alpha promoter to a basal level. Significant sequence homology of this element was found in the DNA of the DR beta, DP alpha and -beta, and DQ alpha genes, always located downstream of the transcriptional start site. The nuclear factor binds to the DR alpha and DP alpha element but not to the element in the DQ alpha gene. It was identified as NF-E1 (YY1). This protein, previously identified by its binding to the Ig kappa 3' enhancer and the Ig heavy chain mu E1 site, thus also appears to be quite important in the regulation of MHC class II gene expression.
The murine cytochrome c oxidase (COX) subunit Vb mRNA contains heterogeneous 5' ends mapping to +1, +6, +12, +17-22, +24-29, and +32-35 positions of the gene. We have previously shown that initiation of RNA at the +1 position of the promoter depends upon a YY-1 (NF-E1) binding initiator motif. In this article we show that the GABP factor binding duplicated ets motif, GTTCCCGGAAG, at +16 to +26 position functions as an independent initiator for transcription of RNAs mapping to the +18-19 and +23-26 regions. The initiation region ets sequence repeat (ets-ets sequence) can drive the transcription of the CAT reporter gene. The upstream ets site of the ets-ets sequence exhibits a low affinity for binding to purified GABP factors, whereas the downstream site exhibits high affinity. S1 analyses of RNA from transfected COS cells demonstrate that the initiation region ets-ets sequence can accurately initiate transcription at the +18-19 and +24-25 regions. Transcriptional initiation at these two positions, but not at +1, +12, and +31-32 positions, show a selective dependence for intact downstream ets site and GABP alpha and beta factors as tested in an in vitro reconstituted system. The activities of both COX IV and COX Vb single site ets initiators are induced in vivo by coexpression with GABP alpha and beta cDNAs. These results provide evidence that the 5' heterogeneity of the COX Vb mRNA is largely due to independent transcription initiators at multiple initiator motifs that bind to various transcription factors.
The UCRBP (YY1, delta, NF-E1) protein has been isolated for its ability to bind to the UCR (upstream conserved region) site present in the conserved murine leukemia virus long terminal repeat. UCRBP carries a highly charged N-terminal domain and four C2-H2-type zinc fingers at its C-terminal end. The present study reveals the following results: (i) The UCR site is present in the upstream and/or regulatory regions of numerous mammalian cellular and viral genes to which both recombinant and cellular UCRBP bind. UCR sites are also found in the regulatory regions of repetitive sequences including human LINE-1 elements and mouse intracisternal-A particle sequences. (ii) By immunological and UV cross-linking experiments, we found that two proteins, of approx. 68 kDa and an antigenically related protein of approx. 40 kDa, account for much of the UCR-binding activity in T-lymphocytes. (iii) There is evidence that UCRBP acts as a phosphoprotein. Eight consensus phosphorylation sites are found in the deduced amino-acid sequence of human UCRBP. The cellular UCR-binding activity was abolished by phosphatase treatment, and there is an incremental increase in apparent molecular mass between the cytoplasmic and nuclear forms of the protein, suggesting phosphorylation. (iv) Although UCRBP has been previously shown to act as a transcriptional repressor, we show here that UCRBP can also act as a positive transactivator of a reporter driven by UCR elements when used in co-transfection assays. This transactivation occurred in a dose-restricted manner and was absent at high concentrations of a UCRBP expression plasmid, indicating a complex mode of function.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
Expression of the beta-casein milk protein gene in the mammary epithelial cell line HC11 is primarily regulated at the transcriptional level. A 338-bp segment of promoter sequence 5' of the transcription start site is sufficient to confer inducibility by the lactogenic hormones insulin, glucocorticoid hormone, and prolactin. Positively and negatively acting promoter elements and specific DNA binding proteins have been identified. The binding of the mammary gland factor MGF to a site between -80 and -100 is indispensable for hormonal induction of transcription. Binding of MGF activity to DNA is greatly enhanced by the action of the lactogenic hormones. Repression of transcription in the uninduced state is mediated by a promoter element located adjacent to the MGF binding site at positions -110 to -150. This repressor element consists of two interacting protein binding sites. A nuclear factor that binds specifically to the proximal site between positions -110 and -120 has been characterized and found to be identical with the nuclear factor YY1 (delta, NF-E1). YY1 does not bind to the distal site. The simultaneous mutation in the proximal and the distal sites results in high, hormone-independent transcription. This finding suggests that YY1 plays a functional role in the repression and acts in conjunction with a second DNA binding protein. Comparison of YY1 DNA binding activity in uninduced and hormone-induced cells showed that relief of repression is not mediated by changes in the concentration or binding affinity of YY1. Infection of HC11 cells with a YY1-expressing recombinant retrovirus resulted in overexpression of YY1 but did not suppress hormonal induction. The addition of purified MGF decreased YY1 binding to its DNA recognition site in vitro. This finding indicates that MGF regulates the DNA binding activity of YY1 and thereby may cause the relief of transcriptional repression.
We have previously reported that liver X receptor (LXR) agonist, TO901317, could significantly inhibit hepatic apolipoprotein M (apoM) expression. It has been reported that TO901317 could activate the ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) that mediates cholesterol efflux to the lipid-poor apoAI, which is an essential step for the high-density lipoprotein (HDL) formation. It is unknown if ABCA1 may regulate hepatic apoM expression. In the present study, HepG2 cells were cultured with the synthetic LXR agonists, TO901317 or GW3965 in the presence or absence of ABCA1 antagonist, disodium 4,4'-diisothiocyanatostilbene- 2,2'-disulfonate (DIDS). The mRNA levels of ABCA1, apoM and liver receptor homolog-1 (LRH-1) determined by the real-time RT-PCR. It demonstrated that both TO901317 and GW3965 could significantly enhance ABCA1 expression, and simultaneously, inhibit LRH1 expression. However, TO901317 alone could significantly inhibit apoM expression, while GW3965 alone did not influence apoM expression. ABCA1 antagonist, DIDS, have no effects on GW3965 induced upregulation of ABCA1 and downregulation of LRH1. However, apoM mRNA level was significantly decreased when the cells cultured with GW3965 together with DIDS. The present study demonstrated that apoM expression could be elevated by ABCA1 via the RXR/LXR pathway and LRH1 does not involve in the regulation of apoM by the activation of ABCA1, although the direct regulative pathway(s) between ABCA1 and apoM gene is still unknown yet. The detailed mechanism needs further investigation.
Adipocytes release a variety of factors which deregulation could provide the basis for complications such as insulin resistance, an early defect on the onset of type 2 diabetes. Such insulin resistance can initially be overcome by compensatory hyperinsulinemia, but the prolonged presence of the hormone can be detrimental for insulin sensitivity.
The objective of the study was to dissect the molecular mechanisms that may regulate hyperinsulinemia-induced insulin resistance in a human liposarcoma cell line and its paracrine interactions with a human rhabdomyosarcoma cell line.
We studied glucose uptake, lipolysis, insulin signaling, and secretion pattern at different days of adipocyte differentiation in the presence of insulin.
Adipocytes differentiated for 14 d gain insulin sensitivity on glucose uptake and inhibition of lipolysis, but prolonged cultures develop an insulin-resistant state characterized by an increase in phosphatase and tensin homolog-deleted on chromosome 10 expression and defects in insulin signaling at the insulin receptor substrate-1/AKT level. The secretion pattern of nonesterified fatty acids, IL-6, adiponectin, leptin, and monocyte chemotactic protein-1 was in keeping with the changes in insulin sensitivity during differentiation. An inverse biphasic response was also observed in human myocytes when they were cultured with various adipocyte-conditioned media, although insulin resistance was detected earlier than in adipocytes. This behavior mimics hyperinsulinemia because insulin action was restored when adipocytes were cultured in the absence of the hormone. Pharmacological treatment of adipocytes with a liver X receptor agonist reestablishes insulin-stimulated glucose uptake, whereas treatment with a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma agonist restored the antilipolytic action of insulin.
Hyperinsulinemia deregulates adipocyte secretion pattern, producing insulin resistance in adipocytes and myocytes, a situation that can be ameliorated with nuclear receptor agonists.
Lipocalin-type prostaglandin (PG) D synthase (L-PGDS) is expressed in adipocytes and is proposed to be involved in the regulation of glucose tolerance and atherosclerosis in type 2 diabetes, because L-PGDS gene knock-out mice show abnormalities in these functions. However, the role of L-PGDS and the regulation mechanism governing its gene expression in adipocytes remain unclear. Here, we applied small interference RNA of L-PGDS to mouse 3T3-L1 cells and found that it suppressed differentiation of these cells into adipocytes. Reporter analysis of the mouse L-PGDS promoter demonstrated that a responsive element for liver receptor homolog-1 (LRH-1) at -233 plays a critical role in preadipocytic 3T3-L1 cells. Moreover, we identified two sterol regulatory elements (SREs) at -194 to be cis-elements for activation of L-PGDS gene expression in adipocytic 3T3-L1 cells. L-PGDS mRNA was induced in response to synthetic liver X receptor agonist, T0901317, through activation of the expression of SRE-binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c) in the adipocytic 3T3-L1 cells. The results of electrophoretic mobility shift assay and chromatin immunoprecipitation assay revealed that LRH-1 and SREBP-1c bound to their respective binding elements in the promoter of L-PGDS gene. Small interference RNA-mediated suppression of LRH-1 or SREBP-1c decreased L-PGDS gene expression in preadipocytic or adipocytic 3T3-L1 cells, respectively. These results indicate that L-PGDS gene expression is activated by LRH-1 in preadipocytes and by SREBP-1c in adipocytes. Liver X receptor-mediated up-regulation of L-PGDS through activation of SREBP-1c is a novel path-way to enhance adipocyte differentiation.
During the third trimester of pregnancy, there is an increase in serum triglyceride and cholesterol levels. The mechanisms accounting for these changes in lipid metabolism during pregnancy are unknown. We hypothesized that, during pregnancy, the expression of nuclear hormone receptors involved in regulating lipid metabolism would decrease. In 19-day pregnant mice, serum triglyceride and non-HDL cholesterol levels were significantly increased, whereas total cholesterol was slightly decreased, because of a decrease in the HDL fraction. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)alpha, PPARbeta/delta, and PPARgamma, liver X receptor (LXR)alpha and LXRbeta, farnesoid X receptor (FXR), and retinoid X receptor (RXR)alpha, RXRbeta, and RXRgamma mRNA levels were significantly decreased in the livers of 19-day pregnant mice. Additionally, the expressions of thyroid receptor (TR)alpha, pregnane X receptor, sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBP)-1a, SREBP-1c, SREBP-2, and liver receptor homolog 1 were also decreased, whereas the expression of TRbeta, constitutive androstane receptor, and hepatic nuclear factor 4 showed no significant change. mRNA levels of the PPAR target genes carnitine-palmitoyl transferase 1alpha and acyl-CoA oxidase, the LXR target genes SREBP1c, ATP-binding cassettes G5 and G8, the FXR target gene SHP, and the TR target genes malic enzyme and Spot14 were all significantly decreased. Finally, the expressions of PPARgamma coactivator (PGC)-1alpha and PGC-1beta, known activators of a number of nuclear hormone receptors, were also significantly decreased. The decreases in expression of RXRs, PPARs, LXRs, FXR, TRs, SREBPs, and PGC-1s could contribute to the alterations in lipid metabolism during late pregnancy.
Cholesterol 7alpha-hydroxylase (Cyp7a1) and the bile acid pool size are increased 2 to 3-fold in lactating postpartum rats. We investigated the interaction of nuclear receptors with the Cyp7a1 proximal promoter and the expression of regulatory signaling pathways in postpartum rats at day 10 (PPd10) versus female controls to identify the mechanisms of increased expression of Cyp7a1, which is maximal at 16 hours. Liver X receptor (LXRalpha) and RNA polymerase II (RNA Pol II) recruitment to Cyp7a1 chromatin were increased 1.5- and 2.5-fold, respectively, at 16 hours on PPd10. Expression of nuclear receptors farnesoid X receptor (FXR), LXRalpha, liver receptor homolog (LRH-1), hepatocyte nuclear factor 4alpha (HNF4alpha), and short heterodimer partner (SHP) messenger RNA (mRNA) and coactivator peroxisome proliferators-activated receptor gamma coactivator-1alpha (PGC-1alpha) mRNA was unchanged in PPd10 versus controls at 16 hours, whereas chicken ovalbumin upstream transcription factor II (COUP-TFII) was decreased 40% at 16 hours. Investigation of a repressive signaling pathway, the c-Jun-N-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling pathway in PPd10 versus controls, showed decreased mRNA expression of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF; decreased 60% at 16 hours) and tyrosine kinase receptor c-Met (decreased 44%-50% at 16 hours), but these were not accompanied by decreased expression of phosphorylated c-Jun. Importantly, expression of fibroblast growth factor 15 (FGF15) mRNA in the ileum was decreased 70% in PPd10 versus controls, whereas phosphorylated mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (Erk1/2) protein expression in liver was decreased 88% at 16 hours.
The increased recruitment of LXRalpha, a Cyp7a1 stimulatory pathway, and decreased expression of FGF15 and phosphorylated Erk1/2, a Cyp7a1 repressive pathway, combined to increase Cyp7a1 expression during lactation.
Multiprotein bridging factor (MBF-1) is a cofactor that was first described for its capacity to modulate the activity of fushi tarazu factor 1, a nuclear receptor originally implicated in Drosophila development. Recently, it has been shown that human MBF-1 stimulates the transcriptional activity of steroidogenic factor 1, a human homolog of fushi tarazu factor 1, which is implicated in steroidogenesis. Here we show that this cofactor enhances the transcriptional activity of several nonsteroid nuclear receptors that are implicated in lipid metabolism, i.e. the liver receptor homolog 1, the liver X receptor alpha, and PPARgamma. MBF-1 interacts with distinct domains in these receptors, depending on whether the receptor binds DNA as a monomer or as a heterodimer with RXR. MBF-1 does not possess any of the classical histone modifying activities such as histone acetyl- or methyl transferase activities, linked to chromatin remodeling, but interacts in vitro with the transcription factor IID complex. MBF-1 seems therefore to act as a bridging factor enabling interactions of nuclear receptors with the transcription machinery.
Cholesterol-7alpha-hydroxylase (CYP7A1) regulates the pathway through which cholesterol is converted into bile acids. The unique detergent properties of bile acids are essential for the digestion and intestinal absorption of hydrophobic nutrients. Bile acids have potent toxic properties (e.g., membrane disruption) and there are a plethora of mechanisms to limit their accumulation in blood and tissues. The discovery of farnesoid X receptor (FXR), the nuclear receptor activated specifically by bile acids, has opened new insights into these mechanisms. Bile acid activation of FXR has been shown to repress the expression of CYP7A1 via increasing the expression of small heterodimer partner (SHP), a non-DNA binding protein. The increased abundance of SHP causes it to associate with liver receptor homolog (LRH)-1, an obligate factor required for transcription of CYP7A1. Recent studies show there is an "FXR/SHP-independent" mechanism that also represses CYP7A1 expression. This "FXR/SHP-independent" pathway involves the interaction of bile acids with liver macrophages (i.e., Kupffer cells), which induces the expression, and secretion of cytokines. These inflammatory cytokines, which include tumor necrosis factor alpha and interleukin-1beta, act upon liver parenchymal cells causing a rapid repression of the CYP7A1 gene.
Cholesterol and bile acid metabolism is tightly controlled by nuclear receptors. The liver X receptor, an oxysterol-activated nuclear receptor, limits cholesterol accumulation in the body both by stimulating reverse cholesterol transport and by inhibiting intestinal cholesterol absorption. The liver X receptor stimulates the adenosine triphosphate binding cassette transporter (types 1 and 8)-mediated cholesterol efflux from peripheral tissues to apolipoprotein AI and the expression of the cholesterol ester transfer protein, hence facilitating cholesterol transfer to the liver. In the liver, the liver X receptor alpha induces the cholesterol 7alpha-hydroxylase (CYP7A1) gene, which controls the rate-limiting step in bile acid synthesis, the major cholesterol excretion pathway. The liver X receptor also limits cholesterol entry in the body by promoting cholesterol efflux from enterocytes into the intestinal lumen, again via an adenosine triphosphate binding cassette transporter type-mediated process. Whereas the liver X receptor is a master controller of cholesterol metabolism, the farnesol X receptor, a bile acid-activated receptor, coordinates bile acid homeostasis. Bile acids facilitate the solubilization of dietary lipids and their subsequent absorption. Bile acids enter the enterocyte through the ileal bile acid transporter and activate the farnesol X receptor, which upregulates the ileal bile acid binding protein, a carrier protein facilitating their re-uptake by the gut. Bile acids are then delivered into the portal blood and taken up in the hepatocytes by the sodium taurocholate co-transporting polypeptide. Inside the hepatocytes, activated farnesol X receptor will decrease further bile acid uptake by reducing the levels of sodium taurocholate co-transporting polypeptide, and stimulating the export of bile acid by increasing the expression of the bile salt export pump. Furthermore, the farnesol X receptor induces the small heterodimer partner, an atypical nuclear receptor, which attenuates bile acid synthesis by inhibiting the action of the orphan nuclear receptor, liver receptor homolog-1, which is a competence factor for CYP7A1 transcription. The farnesol X receptor hence stimulates bile acid re-uptake and controls bile acid production through a regulatory circuit involving both a nuclear receptor regulatory cascade and a number of specific transporter proteins.
Nuclear receptors (NRs) play pivotal roles in the regulation of genes contributing to hepatobiliary cholesterol and bile acid homeostasis. We have previously shown that transporters involved in bile formation are developmentally regulated and are poorly developed during the fetal stage, but their expression reached gradual maturity during the postnatal period. To define the molecular mechanisms underlying this regulation and the role that class II NRs and associated members [liver receptor homolog-1 (LRH-1) and short heterodimer partner (SHP)] play, we have analyzed the ontogeny of NR expression during liver development. Real-time PCR analysis of hepatic NR expression from fetal day 17 through adult revealed that steady-state mRNA levels for all NRs were very low during the embryonic period. However, mRNA levels peaked close to that of adult rats (&gt;6 wk-old rats) by 4 wk of age for farnesoid X receptor (FXR), pregnane X receptor (PXR), liver X receptor-alpha (LXRalpha), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha (PPARalpha), retinoid acid receptor-alpha (RARalpha), LRH-1, and SHP, whereas RXRalpha mRNA lagged behind. FXR, PXR, LXRalpha, RARalpha, and PPARalpha functional activity in liver nuclear extracts assayed by gel EMSA demonstrated that the activity attained adult levels by 4 wk of age, exhibiting a strict correlation with mRNA levels. Surprisingly, PPARalpha activity was delayed as seen by EMSA assay. Protein levels for NRs also corresponded to the mRNA and functional activity except for RXRalpha. RXRalpha protein levels were higher than message levels, suggesting increased protein stability. We conclude that expression of NRs during rat liver development is primarily regulated by transcriptional mechanisms, which in turn, control the regulation of bile acid and cholesterol metabolic pathways.
The metabolic nuclear receptors act as metabolic and toxicological sensors, enabling the organism to quickly adapt to environmental changes by inducing the appropriate metabolic genes and pathways. Ligands for these metabolic receptors are compounds from dietary origin, intermediates in metabolic pathways, drugs, or other environmental factors that, unlike classical nuclear receptor ligands, are present in high concentrations. Metabolic receptors are master regulators integrating the homeostatic control of (a) energy and glucose metabolism through peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma); (b) fatty acid, triglyceride, and lipoprotein metabolism via PPARalpha, beta/delta, and gamma; (c) reverse cholesterol transport and cholesterol absorption through the liver X receptors (LXRs) and liver receptor homolog-1 (LRH-1); (d) bile acid metabolism through the farnesol X receptor (FXR), LXRs, LRH-1; and (e) the defense against xeno- and endobiotics by the pregnane X receptor/steroid and xenobiotic receptor (PXR/SXR). The transcriptional control of these metabolic circuits requires coordination between these metabolic receptors and other transcription factors and coregulators. Altered signaling by this subset of receptors, either through chronic ligand excess or genetic factors, may cause an imbalance in these homeostatic circuits and contribute to the pathogenesis of common metabolic diseases such as obesity, insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes, hyperlipidemia and atherosclerosis, and gallbladder disease. Further studies should exploit the fact that many of these nuclear receptors are designed to respond to small molecules and turn them into therapeutic targets for the treatment of these disorders.
Although many studies have demonstrated the hypocholesterolemic activity of Momordica charantia, also called bitter gourd fruit (BGF), the relative hypocholesterolemic mechanism is not fully understood. In the present study, we hypothesized that BGF alters hepatic gene expression of cholesterol- and bile acid-regulating proteins to improve blood cholesterol profiles. To clarify the mechanism, we fed 7-week-old male Wistar rats a high-cholesterol (HC) diet containing 5% BGF for 4 weeks and determined the cholesterol levels in the serum, liver and feces, concentrations of the fecal total bile acid, and the expression level of cholesterol- and bile acid-regulating genes. The HC diet with BGF supplementation showed a significant serum hypocholesterolemic activity compared with the HC diet without BGF. BGF intake also significantly increased the levels of fecal total bile acid, suggesting that BGF inhibited the reabsorption of bile acids into the intestine. Hepatic messenger RNA (mRNA) levels of small heterodimer partner (SHP) and liver receptor homolog-1, which are both involved in cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase (CYP7A1) regulation, were significantly decreased and increased, respectively, by BGF intake. In addition, BGF tended to increase the hepatic CYP7A1 mRNA level. Taken together, these results suggest that BGF not only decreases the reabsorption of bile acids into the intestine but also increases the conversion of cholesterol to bile acids by CYP7A1 up-regulation through the down-regulation of the hepatic farnesoid X receptor/SHP pathway. 
The protein, thyroid hormone-responsive SPOT 14 homolog (Thrsp), has been reported to be a lipogenic gene in cultured hepatocytes, implicating an important role of Thrsp in the pathogenesis of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Thrsp expression is known to be regulated by a variety of transcription factors, including thyroid hormone receptor, pregnane X receptor, and constitutive androstane receptor. Emerging in vitro evidence also points to a critical role of liver X receptor (LXR) in regulating Thrsp transcription in hepatocytes. In the present study, we showed that Thrsp was up-regulated in livers of db/db mice and high-fat-diet-fed mice, two models of murine NAFLD. Hepatic overexpression of Thrsp increased triglyceride accumulation with enhanced lipogenesis in livers of C57Bl/6 mice, whereas hepatic Thrsp gene silencing attenuated the fatty liver phenotype in db/db mice. LXR activator TO901317 induced Thrsp expression in livers of wild-type (WT) and LXR-β gene-deficient mice, but not in LXR-α or LXR-α/β double-knockout mice. TO901317 treatment significantly enhanced hepatic sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1c (SREBP-1c) expression and activity in WT mice, but failed to induce Thrsp expression in SREBP-1c gene-deficient mice. Sequence analysis revealed four LXR response-element-like elements and one sterol regulatory element (SRE)-binding site within a -2,468 ∼+1-base-pair region of the Thrsp promoter. TO901317 treatment and LXR-α overexpression failed to induce, whereas overexpression of SREBP-1c significantly increased Thrsp promoter activity. Moreover, deletion of the SRE site completely abolished SREBP-1c-induced Thrsp transcription.
Thrsp is a lipogenic gene in the liver that is induced by the LXR agonist through an LXR-α-mediated, SREBP-1c-dependent mechanism. Therefore, Thrsp may represent a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of NAFLD.
The link between cholesterol homeostasis and male fertility has been clearly suggested in patients who suffer from hyperlipidemia and metabolic syndrome. This has been confirmed by the generation of several transgenic mouse models or in animals fed with high cholesterol diet. Next to the alteration of the endocrine signaling pathways through steroid receptors (androgen and estrogen receptors); "orphan" and "adopted" nuclear receptors, such as the Liver X Receptors (LXRs), the Proliferating Peroxisomal Activated Receptors (PPARs) or the Liver Receptor Homolog-1 (LRH-1), have been involved in this cross-talk. These transcription factors show distinct expression patterns in the male genital tract, explaining the large panel of phenotypes observed in transgenic male mice and highlighting the importance of lipid homesostasis and the complexity of the molecular pathways involved. Increasing our knowledge of the roles of these nuclear receptors in male germ cell differentiation could help in proposing new approaches to either treat infertile men or define new strategies for contraception.
Nutritional status is known to control female reproductive physiology. Many reproductive pathologies such as anorexia nervosa, dystocia and preeclampsia, have been linked to body mass index and to metabolic syndrome. Lipid metabolism has also been associated with ovarian, uterine and placental functions. Among the regulators of lipid homeostasis, the Liver X Receptors (LXRs) and the Liver Receptor Homolog-1 (LRH-1), two members of the nuclear receptor superfamily, play a central role. LXRs are sensitive to intracellular cholesterol concentration and decrease plasma cholesterol, allowing to considering them as "cholesterol sensors". LRH-1 shares many target-genes with LXRs and has been considered for a long time as a real orphan nuclear receptor, but recent findings showed that phospholipids are ligands for this nuclear receptor. Acting in concert, LXRs and LRH-1 could thus be sensitive to slight modifications in cellular lipid balance, tightly maintaining their cellular concentrations. These last years, the use of transgenic mice clarified the roles of these nuclear receptors in many physiological functions. This review will be focused on the roles of LXRs and LRH-1 on female reproduction. Their contribution to ovarian endocrine and exocrine functions, as well as uterine and placental physiology will be discussed. The future challenge will thus be to target these nuclear receptors to prevent lipid-associated reproductive diseases in women.
Advanced prostate cancer (PCa) is a clinical challenge as no curative therapeutic is available. In this context, a better understanding of metastasis and resistance mechanisms in PCa is an important issue. As phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) loss is the most common genetic lesion in such cancer, we investigate human data sets for mechanisms that can constrain cancer evolution in this setting. Here we report a liver X receptor (LXR) signature, which tightly correlates with PTEN loss, in PCa. Accordingly, the LXR pathway is deregulated in prostate carcinomas in Pten-null mice. Genetic ablation of LXRs in Pten-null mice, exacerbates PCa invasiveness and metastatic dissemination, which involves mesenchymal transition and accumulation of matrix metalloproteinases. Mechanistically, PTEN deletion governed LXR transcriptional activity through deregulation of cholesterol de novo synthesis, resulting in accumulation of endogenous LXR ligands. Our study therefore reveals a functional circuit linking PTEN and LXR, and highlights LXRs as metabolic gatekeepers that are able to constrain PCa progression.Treatment of prostate cancer, especially in its advanced stage, is still challenging; therefore, strategies to prevent metastatic dissemination are of great interest. Here the authors reveal a crucial role for liver X receptors in suppressing prostate carcinogenesis and metastatic progression in PTEN-null tumors.
Macrophage foam cell formation plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. The protein Tribbles homolog 1 (Trib1), a member of the Tribbles protein family, functions as an adaptor or scaffold protein. Recent studies have indicated its implication in lipoprotein metabolism. In the present study, the role of Trib1 in macrophage foam cell formation was investigated. Oil red O staining was used to analyze intracellular lipid deposition, while the effects of Trib1 overexpression on cholesterol efflux were also examined. Furthermore, quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blot analysis were performed to measure the expression levels of genes involved in cholesterol efflux. The results revealed that overexpression of Trib1 inhibited lipid accumulation in oxidized low density lipoprotein-treated THP-1 macrophages and facilitated macrophage cholesterol efflux to apolipoprotein A-I. Overexpression of Trib1 also upregulated the expression levels of ATP-binding cassette A1 (ABCA1), ABCG1, liver X receptor α (LXRα) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ). In addition, silencing of LXRα or PPARγ via small interfering RNA transfection significantly reversed the Trib1-induced cholesterol efflux. In conclusion, Trib1 inhibits macrophage foam cell formation and enhances cholesterol efflux, which is associated with regulation of the PPARγ, LXRα, ABCA1 and ABCG1 expression levels.
(2E,4E,6Z,8Z)-8-(3',4'-Dihydro-1'(2H)-naphthalen-1'-ylidene)-3,7-dimethyl-2,3,6-octatrienoinic acid, 9cUAB30, is a selective rexinoid for the retinoid X nuclear receptors (RXR). 9cUAB30 displays substantial chemopreventive capacity with little toxicity and is being translated to the clinic as a novel cancer prevention agent. To improve on the potency of 9cUAB30, we synthesized 4-methyl analogs of 9cUAB30, which introduced chirality at the 4-position of the tetralone ring. The syntheses and biological evaluations of the racemic homolog and enantiomers are reported. We demonstrate that the S-enantiomer is the most potent and least toxic even though these enantiomers bind in a similar conformation in the ligand binding domain of RXR. 
The orphan receptor LRH-1 and the oxysterol receptors LXRalpha and LXRbeta are established transcriptional regulators of lipid metabolism that appear to control inflammatory processes. Here, we investigate the anti-inflammatory actions of these nuclear receptors in the hepatic acute phase response (APR). We report that selective synthetic agonists induce SUMOylation-dependent recruitment of either LRH-1 or LXR to hepatic APR promoters and prevent the clearance of the N-CoR corepressor complex upon cytokine stimulation. Investigations of the APR in vivo, using LXR knockout mice, indicate that the anti-inflammatory actions of LXR agonists are triggered selectively by the LXRbeta subtype. We further find that hepatic APR responses in small ubiquitin-like modifier-1 (SUMO-1) knockout mice are increased, which is due in part to diminished LRH-1 action at APR promoters. Finally, we provide evidence that the metabolically important coregulator GPS2 functions as a hitherto unrecognized transrepression mediator of interactions between SUMOylated nuclear receptors and the N-CoR corepressor complex. Our study extends the knowledge of anti-inflammatory mechanisms and pathways directed by metabolic nuclear receptor-corepressor networks to the control of the hepatic APR, and implies alternative pharmacological strategies for the treatment of human metabolic diseases associated with inflammation.
Apolipoprotein M (apoM) may have potential antiatherosclerotic properties. It has been reported that apoM expression could be regulated by many intracellar and extracellar factors. In the present study we further investigated regulation of apoM expression in Caco-2 cells stimulated by a liver X receptor (LXR) agonist, TO901317.
Caco-2 cells were cultured in the presence of either TO901317, farnesoid X receptor (FXR) antagonist guggulsterone or TO901317 together with guggulsterone at different concentrations for 24 hrs. The mRNA levels of ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1), apoA1, apoM, liver receptor homologue-1 (LRH-1) and short heterodimer partner 1 (SHP1) were determined by real-time RT-PCR.
When Caco-2 cell cultured with TO901317 alone, the mRNA levels of ABCA1, apoA1, apoM, LRH-1 and SHP1 were significantly increased with dose-dependent manners (p &lt; 0.05), whereas when the cells cultured with guggulsterone alone, the mRNA levels of apoM, SHP1 and LRH-1 (p &lt; 0.05) were strongly inhibited. Moreover, guggulsterone could abolish the TO901317 enhanced mRNA levels of apoA1 apoM, SHP1 and LRH-1.
The present study demonstrated that LXR agonist TO901317 induced apoM expression in Caco-2 cells might be mediated via the LXR/FXR pathway.
Liver X receptor (LXR) activates fatty acid synthase (FAS) gene expression through binding to a DR-4 element in the promoter. We show that a distinct nuclear receptor half-site 21 bases downstream of the DR-4 element is also critical for the response of FAS to LXR but is not involved in LXR binding to DNA. This half-site specifically binds liver receptor homologue-1 (LRH-1) in vitro and in vivo, and we show LRH-1 is required for maximal LXR responsiveness of the endogenous FAS gene as well as from promoter reporter constructs. We also demonstrate that LRH-1 stimulation of the FAS LXR response is blocked by the addition of small heterodimer partner (SHP) and that FAS mRNA is overexpressed in SHP knock-out animals, providing evidence that FAS is an in vivo target of SHP repression. Taken together, these findings identify the first direct lipogenic gene target of LRH-1/SHP repression and provide a mechanistic explanation for bile acid repression of FAS and lipogenesis recently reported by others.
The ATP-binding cassette transporters ABCG5 and ABCG8 form heterodimers that limit absorption of dietary sterols in the intestine and promote cholesterol elimination from the body through hepatobiliary secretion. To identify cis-regulatory elements of the two genes, we have cloned and analyzed twenty-three evolutionary conserved region (ECR) fragments using the CMV-luciferase reporter system in HepG2 cells. Two ECRs were found to be responsive to the Liver-X-Receptor (LXR). Through elaborate deletion studies, regions containing putative LXREs were identified and the binding of LXRα was demonstrated by EMSA and ChIP assay. When the LXREs were inserted upstream of the intergenic promoter, synergistic activation by LXRα/RXRα in combination with GATA4, HNF4α, and LRH-1, which had been shown to bind to the intergenic region, was observed. In conclusion, we have identified two LXREs in ABCG5/ABCG8 genes for the first time and propose that these LXREs, especially in the ECR20, play major roles in regulating these genes.
The inflammation that occurs during rheumatoid arthritis or atherosclerosis is characterized by the release of large amounts of sPLA(2) (group IIA secretory phospholipase A(2)). We have shown previously that the sPLA(2) promoter in SMC (smooth-muscle cells) is activated by interleukin-1beta and cAMP-signalling pathways, through the interplay of multiple transcription factors [Antonio, Brouillet, Janvier, Monne, Bereziat, Andreani, and Raymondjean (2002) Biochem. J. 368, 415-424]. In the present study, we have investigated the regulation of sPLA(2) gene expression in rat aortic SMCs by oxysterols. We found that oxysterol ligands that bind to the LXR (liver X receptor), including 25-HC (25-hydroxycholesterol) and 22( R )-HC, cause the accumulation of sPLA(2) mRNA and an increased enzyme activity. Transient transfection experiments demonstrated that the sPLA(2) promoter is synergistically activated by 22( R )-HC in combination with 9- cis -retinoic acid, a ligand for the LXR heterodimeric partner RXR (retinoid X receptor). Promoter activity was also increased in a sterol-responsive fashion when cells were co-transfected with LXRalpha/RXRalpha or LXRbeta/RXRalpha. Mutagenesis studies and gel mobility-shift assays revealed that LXR/RXR heterodimers regulate sPLA(2) transcription directly, by interacting with a degenerated LXRE (LXR response element) at position [-421/-406] of the sPLA(2) promoter. Chromatin immunoprecipitation revealed the in vivo occupancy of LXR on the sPLA(2) promoter. In addition, the orphan nuclear receptor LRH-1 (liver receptor homologue-1) potentiated the sterol-dependent regulation of the sPLA(2) promoter by binding to an identified promoter element (TCAAGGCTG). Finally, we have demonstrated that oxysterols act independent of interleukin-1beta and cAMP pathways to activate the sPLA(2) promoter. In the present study, we have identified a new pathway activating sPLA(2) gene expression in SMCs.
The human cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) transfers cholesteryl esters from high density lipoproteins to triglyceride-rich lipoproteins, indirectly facilitating cholesteryl esters uptake by the liver. Hepatic CETP gene expression is increased in response to dietary hypercholesterolemia, an effect that is mediated by the activity of liver X receptor/retinoid X receptor (LXR/RXR) on a direct repeat 4 element in the CETP promoter. In this study we show that the orphan nuclear receptor LRH-1 also transactivates the CETP promoter by binding to a proximal promoter element distinct from the DR4 site. LRH-1 potentiates the sterol-dependent regulation of the wild type CETP promoter by LXR/RXR. Small heterodimer partner, a repressor of LRH-1, abolishes the potentiation effect of LRH-1 but not its basal transactivation of the CETP promoter. Since this mode of regulation of CETP is very similar to that recently reported for the bile salt-mediated repression of Cyp7a (encoding the rate-limiting enzyme for conversion of cholesterol into bile acid in the liver), we examined the effects of bile salt feeding on CETP mRNA expression in human CETP transgenic mice. Hepatic CETP mRNA expression was repressed by a diet containing 1% cholic acid in male mice but was induced by the same diet in female mice. Microarray analysis of hepatic mRNA showed that about 1.5% of genes were repressed, and 2.5% were induced by the bile acid diet. However, the sexually dimorphic regulatory pattern of the CETP gene was an unusual response. Our data provide further evidence for the regulation of CETP and Cyp7a genes by similar molecular mechanisms, consistent with coordinate transcriptional regulation of sequential steps of reverse cholesterol transport. However, differential effects of the bile salt diet indicate additional complexity in the response of these two genes.
Niemann-Pick type C 1 (NPC1) disease is an autosomal recessive cholesterol transport defect resulting in a neurodegenerative process in patients mainly at an early age, although some patients may start with manifestation in adult. Since loss of myelin is considered as a main pathogenetic factor, the precise mechanism inducing dysmylination in NPC1 disease is still unclear. In the present study, a quantitative evaluation on the myelin protein and its regulatory factors of oligodendrocytes, such as SRY-related HMG-box 10 (Sox10), Yin Yang 1 factor (YY1) and myelin gene regulatory factor (MRF), in different parts of the brain and spinal cord was performed in NPC1-mutant mice. The results showed that NPC1 protein was expressed in oligodendrocytes and the amount of myelin protein was generally decreased in all parts of the brain and spinal cord in NPC1-mutant mice. Compared to wild type, the amount of Sox10 and YY1 was not different in NPC1-mutant mice, but MRF was significantly decreased, suggesting a possible mechanism perturbing differentiation of oligodendrocytes and the myelination process in the NPC1-mutant mouse.
Articular cartilage defects are considered a major clinical problem because they cannot heal by themselves. To date, bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs)-based therapy has been widely applied for cartilage repair. However, fibrocartilage was often generated after BMSC therapy; therefore, there is an urgent need to stimulate and maintain BMSCs chondrogenic differentiation. The specific role of superoxide dismutase 3 (SOD3) in chondrogenesis is unknown; therefore, the present study aimed to clarify whether SOD3 could facilitate the chondrogenic differentiation of BMSCs. We first evaluated SOD3 protein levels during chondrogenesis of BMSCs using plate cultures. We then tested whether SOD3 could facilitate chondrogenesis of BMSCs using knockdown or overexpression experiments. Increased SOD3 protein levels were observed during BMSCs chondrogenesis. SOD3 knockdown inhibited collagen type II alpha 1 chain (COL2A1), aggrecan (ACAN), and SRY-box 9 (SOX9) expression. Overexpression of SOD3 increased the levels of chondrogenesis markers (COL2A1, ACAN, and SOX9). Elevated superoxide anions were observed when SOD3 was knocked down. We concluded that SOD3 could facilitate chondrogenesis of BMSCs to improve cartilage regeneration.
Transcription of the platelet-derived growth factor receptor α (PDGFRA/Pdgfra) gene is considered to be precisely regulated. We have previously reported that the PDGFRA/Pdgfra gene is regulated by a dual promoter system in human and mouse, in which a novel PDGFRA/Pdgfra transcript has a first exon (exon 1β) different from that of the canonical PDGFRA/Pdgfra transcript (exon 1α). To elucidate the function of each transcript, we first investigated the contribution of different PDGFRA transcripts to final protein levels. Notably, knockdown experiments suggested the existence of other PDGFRA transcripts, and we identified five additional first exons (exons 1γ, 1δ, 1ε, 1ζ, and 1η) in intron 1 in both the human and mouse genes. The first exons of the mouse Pdgfra gene showed unique expression patterns: exon 1α was broadly expressed; exon 1β was highly expressed in embryos; exon 1γ was observed at relatively high levels in the adult central nervous system (CNS); and exon 1δ was expressed at relatively high levels in the developing CNS. Furthermore, in silico analysis of common putative transcription factor binding sites in the upstream regions of the first exons of both human and mouse PDGFRA/Pdgfra genes predicted common (such as Sry, Mzf1, and Cdx) and unique (such as Sox5, Lmo2, and GATA) transcription factors. Our findings show the diversity of the transcriptional regulation of the PDGFRA/Pdgfra gene.
Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are multipotent stem cells and show distinct features such as capability for self-renewal and differentiation into several lineages of cells including osteoblasts, chondrocytes, and adipocytes. In this study, the methylation status of the promoter region of zinc finger and BTB domain containing 16 (ZBTB16), twist-related protein 1(Twist1), de novo DNA methyltransferases 3A (DNMT3A), SRY-box 9 (Sox9), osteocalcin (OCN), and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ2 (PPARγ2) genes and their messenger RNA (mRNA) expression levels were evaluated during the osteoblastic differentiation of MSCs (ODMSCs). We planned two experimental groups including zoledronic acid (ZA)-treated and nontreated cells (negative control) which both were differentiated into the osteoblasts. Methylation level of DNA in the promoter regions was assayed by methylation-specific-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (MS-qPCR), and mRNA levels of the target inhibitory/stimulatory genes during osteoblastic differentiation of MSCs were measured using real-time PCR. During the experimental induction of ODMSCs, the mRNA expression of the OCN gene was upregulated and methylation level of its promoter region was decreased. Moreover, Sox9 and PPARγ2 mRNA levels were attenuated and their promoter regions methylation levels were significantly augmented. However, the mRNA expression of the DNMT3A was not affected during the ODMSCs though its methylation rate was increased. In addition, ZA could enhance the expression of the ZBTB16 and decrease its promoter regions methylation and on the opposite side, it diminished mRNA expression of Sox9, Twist1, and PPARγ2 genes and increased their methylation rates. Intriguingly, ZA did not show a significant impact on gene expression and methylation levels the OCN and DNMT3A. We found that methylation of the promoter regions of Sox9, OCN, and PPARγ2 genes might be one of the main mechanisms adjusting the genes expression during the ODMSCs. Furthermore, we noticed that ZA can accelerate the MSCs differentiation to the osteoblast cells via two regulatory processes; suppression of osteoblastic differentiation inhibitor genes including Sox9, Twist1, and PPARγ2, and through promotion of the ZBTB16 expression.
Effect and related mechanisms of miR-101 on the chondrogenic differentiation of rat bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) were investigated. The expression level of miR-101 was detected during chondrogenic differentiation. Three groups were established to study the potential function between miR-101 and chondrogenic differentiation: miR-NC group (negative control), miR-101 mimics (BMSCs transfected by miR-101 mimics) and mimics + inhibitor (BMSCs transfected by miR-101 mimics and inhibitor), after the induction of chondrogenic differentiation, the cell viability of MSCs and chondrogenic markers were determined, further, the expression level of Sox9 and Runx2 were detected. In our present research, miR-101 was found upregulated during chondrogenic differentiation of MSCs. Compared with the miR-NC group, the cell viability of MSCs was enhanced and the expression level of chondrogenic markers were respectively gained. The expression level of Sox9 was increased but the expression level of Runx2 was decreased by treatment of miR-101 mimics after induction of chondrogenic differentiation. However, these variations of the indicators were reversed by the intervention using the miR-101 inhibitor. Collectively, our research revealed promotion function of miR-101 on chondrogenic differentiation of MSCs, indicating that miR-101 could be a potential therapeutic strategy for the treatment of osteoarthritis (OA).
Vasculogenic mimicry (VM), referring to vasculogenic structures lined by tumor cells, can be distinguished from angiogenesis, and is responsible for the aggressiveness and metastatic potential of tumors. HCC1937/p53 cells were derived from triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), and used to investigate the roles of breast cancer stem cells (CSCs) in the formation of VM. HCC1937/p53 cells formed mesh-like structures on matrigel culture in which expression of VM-related genes, vascular endothelial (VE)-cadherin, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and MMP-9 was confirmed by droplet digital polymerase chain reaction (PCR). In immunofluorescence microscopy, aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH)1A3+ cells with properties of CSCs or progenitors and GATA binding protein 3 (GATA3)+ cells with more differentiated characteristics were localized in the bridging region and aggregated region of VM structures, respectively. In fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis, ALDH+ cells, considered to be a subpopulation of CSCs sorted by the aldefluor assay, exhibited marked VM formation on matrigel in 24 hr, whereas ALDH- cells did not form VM, indicating possible roles of CSCs in VM formation. The stem-like cancer cells resistant to p53-induced apoptosis, which expressed a high rate of ALDH1A3 and Sex-determining region Y (SRY)-box binding protein-2 (Sox-2), completed VM formation much faster than the control. These findings may provide clues to elucidate the significance of VM formed by treatment-resistant CSCs in the metastatic potential and poor prognosis associated with TNBC.
To report the design and effect of our proprietary hinged external fixator, used in combination with treadmill exercise for rabbits with intra-articular inflammation and cartilage degeneration.
Thirty-two white rabbits were randomly allocated into four groups: No treatment (NT), Distraction only (D), Exercise only (Ex), and Distraction plus exercise (D + Ex). Each rabbit underwent an anterior cruciate ligament transection on the right knee, with the contralateral knee used as a sham control (C).
In the D + Ex group, the levels of Interleukin (IL)-1β and Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α in synovium and TNF-α in joint effusion were significantly lower, while the expression of IL-10 in joint effusion and blood was significantly higher. The ratio of IL-10/TNF-alpha in blood was also the highest in the D + Ex group. The condition of collagen loss was examined: the D + Ex group had the lowest level of type II collagen in effusion and C-telopeptides of type II collagen (CTX-II) in blood. On the other hand, the D + Ex group had the highest expression of cartilage regeneration genes, including type II collagen, Aggrecan (AGN), and SRY-box 9 (SOX9). Finally, the histology showed an attenuation of cartilage degeneration with a lower OA score in the D + Ex group.
Our hinged external fixator combined with treadmill exercise up-regulated cartilage regeneration genes, reduced synovial and intra-articular inflammation, and reduced type II collagen and proteoglycan loss, indicating the use of the fixator in combination with treadmill exercise could prevent progression of posttraumatic osteoarthritis of knee joint in rabbits.
Sox13, a group D member of the Sry-related high-mobility group box (Sox) transcription factor family, is expressed in various tissues including the hair follicle. However, its spatiotemporal expression patterns in the hair follicle and its role in hair development remain to be elucidated. To address these questions, we generated Sox13-LacZ-knock-in mice (Sox13LacZ/+), in which the LacZ reporter gene was inserted in-frame into exon 2, which contains the translation initiation codon. X-gal staining in Sox13LacZ/+ embryos revealed that Sox13 is initially expressed in the epithelial portion of the placode, and subsequently in the hair germ and the hair peg during early hair follicle development. In postnatal catagen and anagen, Sox13 was detected in the epithelial sheath, whereas in telogen, Sox13 was localized in the bulge region, where hair follicle stem cells reside. Immunohistochemistry with an anti-β-galactosidase antibody and anti-hair keratin antibodies that specifically mark the different layers of the hair follicle revealed that Sox13 was predominantly expressed in the outer root sheath in anagen. However, the integumentary structures of Sox13LacZ/LacZ mice were grossly and histologically indistinguishable from those of wild type mice. These results suggest that although Sox13 is dispensable for epidermal and adnexal development, Sox13 is a useful marker for early hair follicle development.
Ependymal cells (EpCs) are a kind of multi-potent stem cells in the central canal of adult spinal cord, which proliferate following spinal cord injury (SCI). Although they can differentiate into functional neurons in vitro, EpC progeny differentiate mainly into astrocytes after SCI, and the mechanism remains unclear. The present study aimed to explore whether neuroinflammation induced by classically activated macrophages (M1) or alternatively activated macrophages (M2) had an effect on EpC proliferation and/or differentiation. EpCs were isolated from intact spinal cord of adult mice and co-cultured with M1 or M2, respectively, in vitro. EpC proliferation was detected using a Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK8) assay and Ki67 staining. Expression of Sox2 (SRY-box 2) in EpCs derived from different groups was detected by immunofluorescence and western blotting. Also explored was whether the mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway was involved in EpC proliferation. Immunofluorescence staining of βIII-tubulin and MAP2 were performed to assess the differentiation direction of EpCs in different culture conditions. Immunofluorescence and western blotting assays showed much more Sox2-positive EpCs in the group EpCs-M1 than the group EpCs-M2 in vitro (p &lt; 0.01). The percentage of EpCs with positive Sox2 staining was decreased after tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) antibody was added into the medium of EpCs-M1. Correspondingly, fewer Sox2-positive staining cells were observed in the central canal of TNFα-deficient mice with SCI. M1 co-culture promoted EpC proliferation significantly, which could be downregulated by Sox2 gene silencing (p &lt; 0.01). Interestingly, M1 regulated the expression of Sox2 through the MAPK signaling pathway, especially the activation of ERK and p38 kinase. Co-culture in M2 conditioned medium obviously increased the proportion of βIII-tubulin-positive cells (p &lt; 0.01). Small amounts of MAP2-positive neurons could be detected on day 7 in the M2 group and the control group. M1 conditioned medium could promote EpC proliferation in response to SCI through the TNFα-MAPK-Sox2 signaling pathway; M2 conditioned medium favors EpCs differentiating toward neurons.
To explore the clinical features and assisted reproductive technology (ART) outcomes of 46,XX disorders of sex development (DSD) males, 144 males with 46,XX DSD were recruited in this retrospective study. The baseline information, clinical characteristics and ART outcomes of the participants were collected and analysed. The mean age was 29.06 ± 4.50 years. The mean volumes (95% CI) of left and right testicles were 2.16 (1.82-2.49) ml and 2.16 (1.83-2.49) ml, respectively. Cryptorchidism and/or hypospadias appeared in 19 patients (13.19%). Elevated levels of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) were found in 136 patients (95.10%) and increased luteinising hormone (LH) values were detected in 125 patients (92.59%). Eighty subjects (62.99%) had low testosterone values. Among 86 patients with status of sex-determining region Y (SRY)-gene and azoospermia factor (AZF) region available, fifteen (17.44%) patients were SRY-negative and AZF region was absent in every patient without exception. Additionally, fertility achieved in 87 patients through ART using donor spermatozoa. In conclusion, hypergonadotropic hypogonadism appeared as the main presentation of 46,XX DSD males regardless of the SRY status. The available fertility option proved to achieve live birth was limited to ART using donor spermatozoa.
Missense mutations in the gene, MAP3K1, are a common cause of 46,XY gonadal dysgenesis, accounting for 15-20% of cases (1). Functional studies demonstrated that all of these mutations cause a protein gain-of-function that alters co-factor binding and increases phosphorylation of the downstream MAP kinase pathway targets, MAPK11, MAP3K, and MAPK1. This dysregulation of the MAP kinase pathway results in increased CTNNB1, increased expression of WNT4 and FOXL2, and decreased expression of SRY and SOX9. Unique and recurrent pathogenic mutations cluster in three semi-contiguous domains outside the kinase region of the protein, a newly identified N-terminal domain that shares homology with Guanine Exchange Factor (GEF - residues Met164 to Glu231), a Plant HomeoDomain (PHD - residues Met442 to Trp495) and an ARMadillo repeat domain (ARM - residues Met566 to Glu862). Despite the presence of the mutation clusters and clinical data, there exists a dearth of mechanistic insights behind the development imbalance. In this paper, we use structural modeling and functional data of these mutations to understand alterations of the MAP3K1 protein and the effects on protein folding, binding and downstream target phosphorylation. We show that these mutations have differential effects on protein binding depending on the domains in which they occur. These mutations increase binding of the RHOA, MAP3K4 and FRAT1 proteins and generally decrease the binding of RAC1. Thus, pathologies in MAP3K1 disrupt the balance between the pro-kinase activities of the RHOA and MAP3K4 binding partners and the inhibitory activity of RAC1.
Chromosomal abnormalities are a major cause of infertility and reproductive problems in equids. Nowadays, their detection is rising due to the use of new diagnostic tools based on molecular markers instead of karyotyping. Reports of this kind of genetic aberrations in domestic donkeys (Equus asinus) are extremely scarce, despite their importance in human activities. In the present study, we analysed the implementation of a short-tandem-repeat (STR)-based molecular method initially developed for horses, as a diagnostic tool to detect chromosomal abnormalities in donkeys. The frequency of five X-linked (LEX003, LEX026, TKY38, TKY270 and UCEDQ502) and one Y-linked (ECAYM2) molecular markers and one Y-linked gene (sex-determining region Y, SRY) was characterized in 121 donkeys from two diverse breeds, the Spanish Andalusian and the African Moroccan breeds. The molecular panel showed 100% sensitivity and 99.67% specificity in detecting 10 different chromosomal abnormalities in the species. In conclusion, this methodology is a valid, rapid and low-cost tool for the detection and characterization of chromosomal abnormalities in domestic donkeys.
The microvasculature of the central nervous system includes the blood-brain barrier (BBB), which regulates the permeability to nutrients and restricts the passage of toxic agents and inflammatory cells. Canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling is responsible for the early phases of brain vascularization and BBB differentiation. However, this signal declines after birth, and other signaling pathways able to maintain barrier integrity at postnatal stage are still unknown.
Sox17 (SRY [sex-determining region Y]-box 17) constitutes a major downstream target of Wnt/β-catenin in endothelial cells and regulates arterial differentiation. In the present article, we asked whether Sox17 may act downstream of Wnt/β-catenin in inducing BBB differentiation and maintenance.
Using reporter mice and nuclear staining of Sox17 and β-catenin, we report that although β-catenin signaling declines after birth, Sox17 activation increases and remains high in the adult. Endothelial-specific inactivation of Sox17 leads to increase of permeability of the brain microcirculation. The severity of this effect depends on the degree of BBB maturation: it is strong in the embryo and progressively declines after birth. In search of Sox17 mechanism of action, RNA sequencing analysis of gene expression of brain endothelial cells has identified members of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway as downstream targets of Sox17. Consistently, we found that Sox17 is a positive inducer of Wnt/β-catenin signaling, and it acts in concert with this pathway to induce and maintain BBB properties. In vivo, inhibition of the β-catenin destruction complex or expression of a degradation-resistant β-catenin mutant, prevent the increase in permeability and retina vascular malformations observed in the absence of Sox17.
Our data highlight a novel role for Sox17 in the induction and maintenance of the BBB, and they underline the strict reciprocal tuning of this transcription factor and Wnt/β-catenin pathway. Modulation of Sox17 activity may be relevant to control BBB permeability in pathological conditions.
Production of sperm and androgens is the main function of the testis. This depends on normal development of both testicular somatic cells and germ cells. Genetic program initiated from the Y chromosome gene SRY (sex-determining region Y) directs somatic cell specification to Sertoli cells that orchestrate further development. They first guide fetal germ cell differentiation towards spermatogenic destiny, and then take care of the full service to spermatogenic cells during spermatogenesis. The number of Sertoli cells sets the limits of sperm production. Leydig cells secrete androgens that determine masculine development. Testis development does not depend on germ cells, i.e. testicular somatic cells also develop in the absence of germ cells, and the testis can produce testosterone normally to induce full masculinization in these men. In contrast, spermatogenic cell development is totally dependent on somatic cells. Here we review germ cell differentiation from primordial germ cells to spermatogonia and development of the supporting somatic cells. Testicular descent to scrota is necessary for normal spermatogenesis, and cryptorchidism is the most common male birth defect. This is a mild form of disorder of sex differentiation (DSD). Multiple genetic reasons for more severe forms of DSD have been revealed during the last decades, and these are described along the description of molecular regulation of testis development.
Goats (Capra hircus) were domesticated in the Fertile Crescent and propagated all over the world. The Silk Road through the Eurasian Steppe belt is a possible propagation route for domestic goats to Central Asia. Kazakhstan is in close geographical proximity to domestication centers and covers the majority of the Eurasian Steppe belt. In this study, we examined the genetic diversity and phylogeographic structure of Kazakhstani goats. The mtDNA sequences of 141 Kazakhstani goats were categorized into haplogroups A, C, and D, of which haplogroup A was predominant (97%), whereas haplogroups C and D were detected at low frequencies (1.4% each). The Kazakhstani haplotypes C were thzen categorized into Asian mtDNA type. Sequence analysis of the SRY gene on the Y-chromosome in 67 male Kazakhstani goats revealed two haplotypes: Y1A (64%) and Y2A (36%). Analysis of the distribution of mtDNA haplogroups and SRY haplotypes from Eurasia and Africa demonstrated genetic similarity among animals from Kazakhstan, Mongolia, and Northwest China located on the Eurasian Steppe belt. These phylogeographic results suggested that the Eurasian Steppe belt was an important propagation route for goats to Central Asia.
Bone marrow-derived progenitor cell-mediated vasculogenesis is a key process for vascular repair and regeneration. However, the role of androgens in the mechanism of ischemia-induced vasculogenesis remains unclear. In this study, a gender-mismatch murine bone marrow transplant model was used to allow tissue tracking of transplanted cells. Bone marrow from 2-month-old male mice was transplanted into irradiated age-matched female recipients. Following the transplantation, ovariectomized female recipients were subjected to unilateral hindlimb ischemia and immediately implanted with either dihydrotestosterone (DHT) or placebo pellets. Laser Doppler perfusion imaging revealed that DHT significantly augmented blood flow recovery, with increased capillary density compared to placebo-treated female recipient controls. Flow cytometry analysis showed that DHT modulated vasculogenesis by increasing Sca1+/CXC4+ progenitor cell production in bone marrow and spleen and enhancing cell mobilization in circulating blood following hindlimb ischemia. Bone marrow cell homing was examined by detecting expression levels of male-specific SRY gene in the ischemic female tissues. DHT treatment promoted bone marrow cell homing to ischemic tissue shown by significantly higher SRY expression compared to placebo-treated females as well as reduced apoptotic features in DHT-treated females, including increased Bcl-2 expression, reduced Bax levels and decreased TUNEL staining. In conclusion, the gender-mismatched bone marrow transplant study shows that androgens directly enhance bone marrow cell-mediated vasculogenesis that contributes to ischemia-induced neovascularization.
Cancer cell metastasis has been recognized as one hallmark of malignant tumor progression; thus, measuring the motility of cells, especially tumor cell migration, is important for evaluating the therapeutic effects of anti-tumor drugs. Here, we used a paper-based cell migration platform to separate and isolate cells according to their distinct motility. A multi-layer cells-in-gels-in-paper (CiGiP) stack was assembled. Only a small portion of DU 145 prostate cancer cells seeded in the middle layer could successfully migrate into the top and bottom layers of the stack, showing heterogeneous motility. The cells with distinct migration were isolated for further analysis. Quantitative PCR assay results demonstrated that cells with higher migration potential had increased expression of the ALDH1A1, SRY (sex-determining region Y)-box 2, NANOG, and octamer-binding transcription 4. Increased doxorubicin tolerance was also observed in cells that migrated through the CiGiP layers. In summary, the separation and characterization of prostate cancer cell subtype can be achieved by using the multi-layer CiGiP cell migration platform.
Races belonging to Ug99 lineage of stem rust fungus Pucciniagraminis f. sp. tritici (Pgt) continue to pose a threat to wheat (Triticumaestivum L.) production in various African countries. Growing resistant varieties is the most economical and environmentally friendly control measure. Recombinant inbred line (RIL) populations from the crosses of susceptible parent 'Cacuke' with the resistant parents 'Huhwa' and 'Yaye' were phenotyped for resistance at the seedling stage to Pgt race TTKSK (Ug99) and in adult plants in field trials at Njoro, Kenya for two seasons in 2016. Using the Affymetrix Axiom breeders SNP array, two stem rust resistance genes, temporarily designated as SrH and SrY, were identified and mapped on chromosome arm 2BL through selective genotyping and bulked segregant analysis (BSA), respectively. Kompetitive allele specific polymorphism (KASP) markers and simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers were used to saturate chromosome arm 2BL in both RIL populations. SrH mapped between markers cim109 and cim114 at a distance of 0.9 cM proximal, and cim117 at 2.9 cM distal. SrY was flanked by markers cim109 and cim116 at 0.8 cM proximal, and IWB45932 at 1.9 cM distal. Two Ug99-effective stem rust resistance genes derived from bread wheat, Sr9h and Sr28, have been reported on chromosome arm 2BL. Infection types and map position in Huhwa and Yaye indicated that Sr28 was absent in both the parents. However, susceptible reactions produced by resistant lines from both populations against Sr9h-virulent race TTKSF+ confirmed the presence of a common resistance locus Sr9h in both lines. Test of allelism is required to establish genetic relationships between genes identified in present study and Sr9h. Marker cim117 linked to SrH was genotyped on set of wheat lines with Huhwa in the pedigree and is advised to be used for marker assisted selection for this gene, however, a combination of phenotypic and genotypic assays is desirable for both genes especially for selection of Sr9h in breeding programs.
Since colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common malignant tumors worldwide, we aimed to identify the role of sex determining region Y (SRY)-box 18 (SOX18) in CRC.
RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry were employed to detect the expression of SOX18 in CRC samples. We then identified the effect of SOX18 on cell proliferation, cell cycle, and apoptosis by cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8), flow cytometry, and annexin V/PI staining, respectively. The effect of silencing SOX18 expression in CRC development was evaluated by using a xenograft mouse model.
First, we found that SOX18 was overexpressed in CRC tissues and cell lines and that SOX18 levels in CRC tissues were positively associated with advanced clinical stages, vascular invasion, and lymph node metastasis. Furthermore, patients with higher expression of SOX18 had a lower survival rate. Overexpression of SOX18 significantly promoted cell proliferation, promoted S cell cycle progression, and inhibited cell apoptosis. Conversely, downregulation of SOX18 clearly weakened cell proliferation, induced G0/G1 cell cycle phase arrest, and gave rise to cell apoptosis. The results showed that shSOX18 significantly inhibited tumor growth and weight. Ki67 expression was also decreased by SOX18 silencing treatment.
Our study indicates that SOX18 may have a carcinogenic effect on CRC, which might provide novel insights into CRC prevention and treatment.
We aimed to survey the monogenic causes of disorders of sex development (DSD) and thereby its prevalence in India. This study revealed mutations resulting in androgen insensitivity syndrome, 5α-reductase type 2 deficiency, and gonadal dysgenesis were commonly reported. Intriguingly, AR deficits were the most prevalent (32 mutations) and of 11/26 missense mutations were in exons 4-8 (encoding ligand binding domain). The unique features of SRD5A2 defects were p.R246Q (most prevalent) and p.G196S could be mutational hotspots, dual gene defects (p.A596T in AR and p.G196S in SRD5A2) in a patient with hypospadias and novel 8 nucleotide deletion (exon 1) found in a patient with perineal hypospadias. Deficits in SRY, WT1, DHH, NR5A1, and DMRT1 caused 46,XY gonadal dysgenesis. Notably, mutations in AR, SRD5A2, MAMLD1, WT1, and MAP3K1 have led to hypospadias and only one CYP19A1 mutation caused aromatase deficiency was reported to date. Data mining from various databases has not only reinforced the role of well-established genes (e.g., SRY, WT1, DHH, NR5A1, DMRT1, AR, SRD5A2, MAMLD1) involved in DSD but also provided us 12 more potential candidate genes (ACVR1, AMHR2, CTNNB1, CYP11A1, CYP19A1, FGFR2, FGF9, PRKACA, PRKACG, SMAD9, TERT, ZFPM2), which benefit from a close association with the well-established genes involved in DSD and might be useful to screen owing to their direct gene-phenotype relationship or through direct functional interaction. As more genes have been revealed in relation to DSD, we believe ultimately it holds a better scenario for therapeutic regimen. Despite the advances in translational medicine, hospitals are yet to adopt genetic testing and counseling facilities in India that shall have potential impact on clinical diagnosis.

microRNAs (miRs) are essential in the development of heart failure. The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of microRNA-330 (miR-330) on left ventricular remodeling via the TGF-β1/Smad3 signaling pathway by targeting the sex-determining region Y (SRY) in mice with myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury (MIRI). Differentially expressed gene (DEG) in myocardial ischemia-reperfusion (IR) was screened out and the miR that targeted the DEG was also predicted and verified. A model of MIRI was established to detect the expression of miR-330, SRY, transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β1), and Sekelsky mothers against dpp3 (Smad3). To further investigate the role of miR-330 in MIRI with the involvement of SRY and TGF-β1/Smad3 signaling pathway, the modeled mice were treated with different mimic, inhibitor, or small interfering RNA (siRNA) to observe the changes of the related gene expression, as well as the myocardial infarction size and volume of myocardial collagen. SRY was screened out and verified as a target gene of miR-330. The MIRI mice showed enlarged myocardial infarction size, increased volume of myocardial collagen, increased expression of miR-330, TGF-β1 and Smad3, while decreased the expression of SRY. The MIRI mice treated with miR-330 inhibitor showed decreased myocardial infarction size, the volume of myocardial collagen, and expression of TGF-β1 and Smad3 but promoted expression of SRY. Our findings demonstrated that downregulated miR-330 could suppress left ventricular remodeling to inhibit the activation of the TGF-β1/Smad3 signaling pathway via negatively targeting of SRY in mice with MIRI. This can be a potential target in the strategy to attenuate patient suffering.
Osteosarcoma (OS) is the most common primary bone malignancy in children and adolescents, the pathogenesis of which remain largely unknown. Small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO)-Specific Protease 2 (SENP2) has been reported to serve as a tumor suppressor in hepatocellular carcinoma cells. The aim of the present study was to investigate the critical role of SENP2 in OS cells. Using reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blot assays, it was observed that SENP2 was significantly downregulated in clinical OS tissues compared with adjacent normal samples. Ectopic expression of SENP2 resulted in the suppression of proliferation, migration and invasion in OS cells, whereas SENP2 knockdown by CRISPR-Cas9-based gene editing had the opposite effect. SENP2 is associated with the proteasome-dependent ubiquitination and degradation of SRY-box-9 (SOX9). SOX9 silencing impaired SENP2-depletion-induced accelerated cell growth and migration. Together, these results suggest that SOX9 is a critical downstream effector of the tumor suppressor SENP2 in OS.
Males and females share the same genetic code, but gene expression profile often displays differences between two sexes. Mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) have been used to experiment as a useful tool to test gene function. They have also been characterized by gender-based differences in expressed genes such as Y-linked Sry or X-linked Hprt. However, there is no report on sex differences in global gene expression. Here, using the next-generation RNA sequencing, we compared the comprehensive transcriptome of MEFs derived from two sexes. In comparison with the female group, the male group up-regulated 27 differentially expressed genes (DEGs), in which a male-specific histone demethylase KDM5D gene is included, and 7 DEGs were down-regulated. Based on the results by searching the ENCODE analysis, it was shown that the expression of 15 genes identified is potentially regulated by the methylation of H3K4me1 or H3K4me3. Interestingly, we demonstrated that both of H3K4 methylation are induced by knocking down KDM5D, which causes changes in patterns of eight DEGs found in male MEFs. Collectively, these data not only suggest an importance of KDM5D-mediated demethylation of H3K4 involved in the sexually dimorphic gene expression in male MEFs, but also may provide information regarding sex-dependent changes in gene expression when MEFs are used for experiments.
The male-biased prevalence of certain neurodevelopmental disorders and the sex-biased outcomes associated with stress exposure during gestation have been previously described. Here, we hypothesized that genes distinctively targeted by only one or both homologous proteins highly conserved across therian mammals, SOX3 and SRY, could induce sexual adaptive changes that result in a differential risk for neurodevelopmental disorders. ChIP-seq/chip data showed that SOX3/SRY gene targets were expressed in different brain cell types in mice. We used orthologous human genes in rodent genomes to extend the number of SOX3/SRY set (1,721). These genes were later found to be enriched in five modules of coexpressed genes during the early and mid-gestation periods (FDR &lt; 0.05), independent of sexual hormones. Genes with differential expression (24, p &lt; 0.0001) and methylation (40, p &lt; 0.047) between sexes were overrepresented in this set. Exclusive SOX3 or SRY target genes were more associated with the late gestational and postnatal periods. Using autism as a model sex-biased disorder, the SOX3/SRY set was enriched in autism gene databases (FDR ≤ 0.05), and there were more de novo variations from the male autism spectrum disorder (ASD) samples under the SRY peaks compared to the random peaks (p &lt; 0.024). The comparison of coexpressed networks of SOX3/SRY target genes between male autism and control samples revealed low preservation in gene modules related to stress response (99 genes) and neurogenesis (78 genes). This study provides evidence that while SOX3 is a regulatory mechanism for both sexes, the male-exclusive SRY also plays a role in gene regulation, suggesting a potential mechanism for sex bias in ASD.
Spondin-2, belongs to the SOX (SRY-related HMG box) gene family, plays a vital role in the development of malignancy, however, the role of Spondin-2 in laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC) remains unknown. The aim of this study is to investigate the prognostic significance of and probable mechanism of Spondin-2 in LSCC. qRT-PCR, western blotting assays and IHC analysis demonstrated that Spondin-2 was significantly increased in LSCC tissues compared with adjacent non-tumorous tissues. In addition, high levels of Spondin-2 was associated with clinical stage, lymph node metastasis and pathology grade of LSCC patients (P ＜0.05). Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that patients with high expression of Spondin-2 had a lower overall survival rate (P＜0.05) than that with low expression of Spondin-2. Moreover, spondin-2 silencing inhibited the proliferation of LSCC cells through inhibiting the activation of PI3K/AKT signaling. In conclusion, spondin-2 might be a novel therapeutic target and prognostic biomarker for LSCC patients.
In this case study, we describe a 3-year-old boy who was referred to the Inonu University Hospital with short stature complaint. His height was 86 cm (-2.96 SDS), weight was 12 kg (-2.43 SDS), and head circumference was 46.5 cm (-2.34 SDS). Chromosomal analyses were performed on cultured peripheral blood lymphocytes of the patient and his parents and showed the patient's karyotype mos 45,X[20]/46,X,idic(Y)(p11.32)[29]/46,XY[1]. The karyotypes of the parents were normal. Subsequently, specific FISH probes were hybridized to the related regions of the sex-determining region Y (SRY), centromere X/Y (CEP X/Y), and short stature homeobox (SHOX) genes. Simultaneous SNP array-CGH was conducted. As to our knowledge, we present the first patient with mosaic isodicentric Y chromosome with 3 different cell lines and normal male external genitalia. Our results suggest that it would be beneficial to study cytogenetic and molecular cytogenetic methods together for better diagnostic accuracy and treatment.
Liver cholestasis is a chronic liver disease and a major health problem worldwide. Cholestasis is characterised by a decrease in bile flow due to impaired secretion by hepatocytes or by obstruction of bile flow through intra- or extrahepatic bile ducts. Thereby cholestasis can induce ductal proliferation, hepatocyte injury and liver fibrosis. Notch signalling promotes the formation and maturation of bile duct structures. Here we investigated the liver regeneration process in the context of cholestasis induced by disruption of the Notch signalling pathway. Liver-specific deletion of recombination signal binding protein for immunoglobulin kappa j region (Rbpj), which represents a key regulator of Notch signalling, induces severe cholestasis through impaired intra-hepatic bile duct (IHBD) maturation, severe necrosis and increased lethality. Deregulation of the biliary compartment and cholestasis are associated with the change of several signalling pathways including a Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) gene set representing the Hippo pathway, further yes-associated protein (YAP) activation and upregulation of SRY (sex determining region Y)-box 9 (SOX9), which is associated with transdifferentiation of hepatocytes. SOX9 upregulation in cholestatic liver injury in vitro is independent of Notch signalling. We could comprehensively address that in vivo Rbpj depletion is followed by YAP activation, which influences the transdifferentiation of hepatocytes and thereby contributing to liver regeneration.
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common type of liver cancer with high mortality. Identifying key molecules involved in the regulation of HCC development is of great clinical significance. SOX11 is a transcription factor belonging to group C of Sry-related high mobility group box family whose abnormal expression is frequently seen in many kinds of human cancers. Here, we noted that the expression of SOX11 was decreased in human HCC tumors compared with that in matched normal tissues. Overexpression of SOX11 promoted growth inhibition and apoptosis in HCC cell line HuH-7. Mechanistically, SOX11 enhanced the expression of nemo-like kinase and the phosphorylation of TCF4, thereby blunting the activation of oncogenic Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway in HuH-7 cells. Finally, SOX11 was also found to sensitize HuH-7 cells to chemotherapy drugs cisplatin and 5-fluorouraci. Therefore, our study identifies SOX11 as a potential tumor suppressor in HCC and may hopefully be beneficial for the clinical diagnosis or treatment of HCC.
To delineate cytogenetic and molecular abnormalities of a fetus carrying a de novo 46,X,der(X),t(X;Y)(p22.3;p11.2).
G-banded karyotyping and next-generation sequencing (NGS) were used to analyze the fetus, his father and sister. Single nucleotide polymorphism-based arrays (SNP-array), multiple PCR and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) were utilized to verify the result.
G-banded karyotyping at 320 bands showed that the fetus had a normal karyotype, while NGS has identified a 3.58 Mb microdeletion at Xp22.33 and a Y chromosomal segment of about 10 Mb at Yp11.32p11.2. With the sequencing results, high-resolution karyotyping at 550-750 bands level has determined the fetus to be 46,X,der(X)t(X;Y)(p22.3;p11.2). The result was confirmed by PCR amplification of the SRY gene, FISH and SNP-array assays. The karyotypes of his father and sister were both normal. His sister also showed no amplification of the SRY gene, and her NGS results were normal too, suggesting that the karyotype of the fetus was de novo.
Combined karyotyping, NGS, SNP-array, PCR and FISH assay can facilitate diagnosis of XX disorder of sex development.
To explore the pathogenesis of a 46,XY female with sex reversal.
Peripheral blood lymphocytes of the patient were subjected to G-banding karyotype analysis. Sex chromosomes were analyzed with fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). SRY gene was analyzed by Sanger sequencing. The whole exome of the patient was subjected to next generation sequencing. Copy number variations (CNVs) of the NR0B1, SF1, SRY, SOX9 and WNT4 genes were validated by multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA).
The patient had a 46,XY karyotype. FISH analysis showed that her sex chromosomes were X and Y. No mutation was found in the SRY gene, and no pathogenic mutation was detected in her exome. However, a duplication spanning approximately 67.31 kb encompassing the MAGEB1, MAGEB3, MAGEB4 and NR0B1 genes at Xp21, was predicted by software analysis. MLPA confirmed duplication of the NR0B1 gene in the patient and her mother.
A duplication fragment of Xp21 encompassing the NR0B1 gene in the 46,XY female with sex reversal is transmitted from her asymptomatic carrier mother. Attention should be paid towards the insidious nature and high morbidity of this duplication.
The study aimed to identify chemoradiotherapy (CRT)-sensitive biomarkers in colorectal cancer (CRC) patients. The GSE15781 dataset used in this study contains 42 samples: 22 CRC tissues (non-CRT: n = 13; CRT: n = 9) and 20 normal colorectal tissues (non-CRT: n = 10; CRT: n = 10). Following pretreatment, differentially expressed genes were selected using the limma package. Potential CRT-sensitive genes were identified with Venn analysis and then enriched in function and pathway clusters using the DAVID online tool. Moreover, protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analysis was implemented using the STRING database. The TRRUST database was used to establish a transcription factor (TF)-target transcriptional network. A miRNA-mRNA network was constructed based on relevant databases. miRNA and mRNA expression levels were analyzed using real-time quantitative PCR. A group of 259 candidate CRT-sensitive genes were identified that were mainly enriched in cell cycle regulation, adhesion-associated processes, and the p53 signaling pathway. A PPI network was established that contained striking nodes, including ITGA2, MYC, ESR1, and dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPYD), among which ESR1 was linked to MYC, and the two nodes were also highlighted in the TF-target regulation network. SRY-box 9 (SOX9) was another key TF. Hsa-miR-590-3p, hsa-miR-495, hsa-miR-320c, and hsa-miR-320d were predominant in the miRNA-mRNA network. Expression levels of SOX9, DPYD mRNA, miR-495, and miR-590-3p were clearly reduced after X-ray treatment in irradiated HT-29 cells, whereas that of miR-320d was notably enhanced. SOX9 may be a CRT-sensitive gene in CRC patients, and hsa-miR-590-3p, hsa-miR-495, and hsa-miR-320d may be CRT-sensitive microRNAs in CRC patients. Therefore, SOX9, hsa-miR-590-3p, hsa-miR-495, and hsa-miR-320d may be used as sensitive biomarkers in CRC patients.
A growing body of evidence indicates that rhomboid domain containing 1 (RHBDD1) plays an important role in a variety of physiological and pathological processes, including tumorigenesis. We aimed to determine the function of RHBDD1 in breast cancer cells.
In this study, we used the Oncomine™ database to determine the expression patterns of RHBDD1 in normal and breast cancer tissues. We performed lentiviral transfection of RHBDD1-specific small interfering RNA into the breast cancer cell lines ZR-75-30 and MDA-MB-231 in order to investigate the effects of RHBDD1 deficiency on breast cancer metastasis.
We found that knockdown of RHBDD1 inhibited breast cancer cell migration and invasion in vitro. Moreover, knockdown of RHBDD1 promoted epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) by suppressing the expression of MPP2, MPP9, fibronectin 1, vimentin, SRY-box 2, zinc finger E-box binding homeobox 1, and snail family transcriptional repressor 1, and promoting the expression of cadherin 1. Additionally, knockdown of RHBDD1 inhibited the protein expression and phosphorylation of Akt.
Our data indicate that RHBDD1 overexpression may promote breast cancer metastasis via the regulation of EMT, suggesting that RHBDD1 may be an important regulator of breast cancer metastasis.
Degenerative retinopathies are the leading causes of irreversible visual impairment in the elderly, affecting hundreds of millions of patients. Müller glia cells (MGC), the main type of glia found in the vertebrate retina, can resume proliferation in the rodent adult injured retina but contribute weakly to tissue repair when compared to zebrafish retina. However, postnatal and adult mouse MGC can be genetically reprogrammed through the expression of the transcription factor (TF) Achaete-scute homolog 1 (ASCL1) into induced neurons (iNs), displaying key hallmarks of photoreceptors, bipolar and amacrine cells, which may contribute to regenerate the damaged retina. Here, we show that the TF neurogenin 2 (NEUROG2) is also sufficient to lineage-reprogram postnatal mouse MGC into iNs. The efficiency of MGC lineage conversion by NEUROG2 is similar to that observed after expression of ASCL1 and both TFs induce the generation of functionally active iNs. Treatment of MGC cultures with EGF and FGF2 prior to Neurog2 or Ascl1 expression enhances reprogramming efficiencies, what can be at least partially explained by an increase in the frequency of MGCs expressing sex determining region Y (SRY)-box 2 (SOX2). Transduction of either Neurog2 or Ascl1 led to the upregulation of key retina neuronal genes in MGC-derived iNs, but only NEUROG2 induced a consistent increase in the expression of putative retinal ganglion cell (RGC) genes. Moreover, in vivo electroporation of Neurog2 in late progenitors from the neonatal rat retina, which are transcriptionally similar to MGCs, also induced a shift in the generation of retinal cell subtypes, favoring neuronal differentiation at the expense of MGCs and resuming the generation of RGCs. Altogether, our data indicate that NEUROG2 induces lineage conversion of postnatal rodent MGCs into RGC-like iNs in vitro and resumes the generation of this neuronal type from late progenitors of the retina in vivo.
Repeated exposure to life stressors can overwhelm the body's capacity to restore homeostasis and result in severe negative consequences. Cannabinoid CB1 receptors are highly expressed in the Central Nervous System (CNS) and regulate both glucocorticoid signalling and neurotransmitter release. In rodents, WIN55212.2 is a full agonist at the cannabinoid receptor type-1, while Rimonabant is a potent and selective cannabinoid inverse agonist at this receptor. This study aims to investigate the effect of long-term psychosocial stress following acute challenge with cannabinoid drugs on gene expression in distinct brain regions; this is done by employing digital multiplexed gene expression analysis. We found that repeated stress increased cortical mRNA levels of dopamine receptor D2, while the expression of neuregulin-1 decreased in both the prefrontal cortex and cerebellum. Further, we found that the acute injection of the agonist WIN55212.2 reduced striatal levels of dopamine receptor D2, while the use of inverse agonist Rimonabant acted in the opposite direction. The analysis of the interaction between the drugs and repeated stress revealed that defeat mice treated with WIN55212.2 showed lower expression of a set of myelin-related genes, as did the expression of SRY-box 10 and dopamine receptors-D1 and -D2 in the prefrontal cortex when compared to vehicle. In addition, in the hippocampus of stressed mice treated with WIN55212.2, we found an elevated expression of oligodendrocyte transcription factor-1, -2 and zinc finger protein 488 when compared to vehicle. In comparison to vehicle, an increase in 2',3'-Cyclic nucleotide 3'-phosphodiesterase and oligodendrocyte transcription factor-1 occurred in the cerebellum of stressed animals treated with the agonist. Moreover, treatment with Rimonabant under the influence of stress induced an overexpression of a set of myelin-related genes in the prefrontal cortex when compared to WIN-treated animals. In conclusion, repeated stress interfered with the dopaminergic system in the prefrontal cortex. We demonstrated that the expression of dopamine receptor D2 in the striatum was mediated by the CB1 receptor. Stressed mice exposed to either WIN55212.2 or Rimonabant displayed pronounced deficits in CNS myelination. In addition, the pharmacological blockage of CB1 receptor in stressed mice deregulated the expression of dopamine receptors and might lead to dysfunctions in dopamine metabolism.
Sex preselection has always generated great interest among livestock producers. Among the prevalent sperm sorting methods, there is much evidence that sex sorting has a negative effect on sperm quality with an altered pattern of sperm motility, ultimately reducing the period of cell viability. In this study, we have established a new approach for the preselected embryo production by using WholeMom®; a monoclonal antibody developed against bull sperm epitopes for simple and easy separation of X- and Y-sperm. There were no significant differences (P &gt;  0.05) in the percentage of presumptive zygotes between the control and the X-sperm sorted group, but there was a difference in early cleaving embryos with there being 81.2 ± 1.4%, 78.3 ± 1.0%, and 66.7 ± 1.1% for the control, X-sperm sorted, and Y-sperm sorted groups, respectively. Similarly, the percentage of embryos that developed to the blastocyst stage (Day 7) were also greater (P &lt;  0.05) in the control and X-sperm sorted group compared with the Y-sperm sorted group being 34.8 ± 1.0%, 32.1 ± 0.8%, and 23.7 ± 1.0% in the control, X-sperm sorted, and Y-sperm sorted groups, respectively. Furthermore, B-SRY F2 and B-SRY R2 gene expression data indicated there was a detection accuracy of 81.0% for the female embryos and 72.5% for the male embryos produced in vitro. In conclusion, in cattle in vitro derived embryo production using pre-selected sexed semen and subsequent embryo transfer can facilitate the mass production of individuals that are genetically superior.
To observe and analyse the Amelogenin allelic loss in parent-child identification cases, and to explore the type and mechanism of Amelogenin allelic loss as well as its influence on gender identification and solutions.
After the detection by SiFaSTR™ 23plex DNA identification system, samples had the characteristics of the peak area of Amelogenin X was the same as the one of adjacent heterozygote or lower than one half of adjacent homozygote in females while Amelogenin X loss was observed in males were selected. X chromosome STR （X-STR） typing and Amelogenin X sequencing were performed. The samples with Amelogenin Y loss in males were confirmed by the detection of Y chromosome STR typing and sex-determining region of Y （SRY）. The type and rate of Amelogenin allelic loss were confirmed and calculated, and the mechanism and influence of this variation were also analysed.
Amelogenin X allelic loss was observed in one male sample, the mutation in primer-binding region was confirmed by sequencing. The suspected Amelogenin X allelic loss was observed in four female samples, but the mutation in primer-binding region was confirmed by sequencing in only one sample. Amelogenin Y allelic loss was observed in seven male samples, SRY positive cases was detected in five of them, and two were SRY negative. Y-STR type was detected in four cases of the five SRY positive cases, which was not detected in the two SRY negative cases. The rate of Amelogenin allelic loss was about 0.029%.
Amelogenin X allelic loss does not affect the gender identification, but Amelogenin Y allelic loss may cause wrong gender identification. Thus, Y-STR or SRY should be detected for gender confirmation. When Y-STR genotypes are not detected in a "male" whose SRY detection is also negative, then the chromosome karyotype analysis and sex differentiation related genes test should be taken to further confirm the gender.
疑似Amelogenin等位基因丢失的检测与分析12例.
观察并分析亲权鉴定案件中Amelogenin等位基因丢失的案例，探讨Amelogenin等位基因丢失的类型、机制以及对性别鉴定的影响和应对方法。.
选择经SiFaSTR™ 23plex DNA身份鉴定系统检测，女性出现Amelogenin X的峰面积与相邻杂合子峰面积一致或低于相邻纯合子峰面积的1/2，男性出现Amelogenin X丢失的样本，进行X-STR分型及Amelogenin X测序，同时对出现Amelogenin Y丢失的男性样本，检测Y-STR分型及Y染色体性别决定区（sex-determining region of Y，SRY）进行验证。统计Amelogenin等位基因丢失的类型及丢失率，分析出现变异的机制及影响。.
1例男性Amelogenin X等位基因丢失，经测序证实为引物结合区突变；4例女性疑似Amelogenin X等位基因丢失，经测序证实出现引物结合区突变的仅为1例。7例男性出现Amelogenin Y丢失，其中SRY阳性5例，SRY阴性2例。5例SRY阳性案件中4例可检出部分Y-STR分型，1例未检出Y-STR分型，2例SRY阴性案件均未检出Y-STR分型。Amelogenin等位基因丢失率约为0.029%。.
Amelogenin X丢失不影响性别判定，Amelogenin Y丢失可能对性别造成误判，需要检测Y-STR或SRY来明确性别，对于未检出Y-STR分型且SRY检测为阴性的“男性”，建议进行染色体核型分析及性别分化相关基因检测以进一步明确性别。.

Chondrocytes in osteoarthritis undergo a phenotype shift leading to increased production of cartilage-degrading enzymes. There are similarities between the phenotype of osteoarthritic chondrocytes and those of growth plate chondrocytes. Hydroxyapatite can promote chondrocyte differentiation in the growth plate. Basic calcium phosphate (BCP) crystals (which consist of hydroxyapatite, octacalcium apatite and tricalcium phosphate) are frequently found in osteoarthritic joints. The objective of this study was to determine whether BCP crystals induce disease-associated changes in phenotypic marker expression in chondrocytes. Primary human chondrocytes isolated from macroscopically normal cartilage were treated with BCP for up to 48 h. Expression of indian hedgehog (IHH), matrix metalloproteinase 13 (MMP13), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and type X collagen (COLX) were higher, and expression of sry-box 9 (SOX9) lower, in BCP-treated chondrocytes (50 µg/mL) compared to untreated controls. COLX protein was also present in BCP-treated chondrocytes. Intracellular calcium and levels of phosphorylated and total calcium/calmodulin kinase 2 (CaMK2) were elevated following BCP treatment due to BCP-induced release of calcium from intracellular stores. CaMK2 inhibition or knockdown ameliorated the BCP-induced changes in SOX9, IHH, COLX, IL-6 and MMP13 expression. BCP crystals induce osteoarthritis-associated changes in phenotypic marker expression in chondrocytes by calcium-mediated activation of CaMK2. The presence of BCP crystals in osteoarthritic joints may contribute to disease progression.
The aim of this paper was to observe the function of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell (BMSC) transplantation in process of liver injury induced by carbon tetrachloride (CCl₄) in vivo and the intervention effect of Yiguanjian (YGJ), a compound of Chinese herbal medicine. Wistar rats were randomly divided into five groups: normal group, model group, cell transplantation (CT) group, YGJ group and cell transplantation plus Yiguanjian (CTY) group. Liver injury was induced through subcutaneous injection with CCl₄ at a dose of 3 mL·kg⁻¹ body weight for 4 weeks, twice a week. They were injected for a total of 9 times. After the first injection with CCl₄, rats in the CT group and CTY group were injected with the third-generation BMSCs at dose 1×10⁶ (suspended in 1 mL saline solution) via tail vein. Rats in the YGJ and CTY groups were also intragastrically administered with Yiguanjian once a day. Rat serum ALT and AST activities were increased significantly on the second day after injection with CCl₄, while BMSC transplantation and Yiguanjian decreased their activities. After 4 weeks of injection with CCl₄, serum ALT, AST and γ-GT activities, and serum TNF-α and IL-6 expressions were increased, while TBIL were decreased in model rats compared with normal rats. Meanwhile, liver cells edema, plasmatic loose, and numerous lipid droplets were observed in rats of the model group. BMSC transplantation aggravated liver injury compared with model rats, which was manifested by decreasing SOD activity, increased MDA, TG, TNF-α and IL-6 levels, and aggravated necrosis level of hepatocytes, fusion of lipid droplets, and collagen deposition in liver tissue. Yiguanjian decreased liver injury induced by CCl₄ alone and CCl₄ plus BMSC transplantation. SRY gene in situ hybridization method was used to detect the positive SRY expressions in heart, liver, spleen, lung and kidney, especially in liver, while Yiguangjian decreased liver SRY expression. Wnt and β-catenin showed high expressions in rats of normal group, which were decreased significantly in rats of models group, while Yiguanjian increased their expressions. In conclusion, BMSC transplantation could exacerbate liver injury, while Yiguanjian could protect liver injury induced by CCl₄ and BMSC transplantation, which was related to decreasing the homing of BMSCs to liver and up-regulating Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway.
The hippocampus is one of the sites in the mammalian brain that is capable of continuously generating controversy. Adult neurogenesis is a remarkable process, and yet an intensely debatable topic in contemporary neuroscience due to its distinctiveness and conceivable impact on neural activity. The belief that neurogenesis continues through adulthood has provoked remarkable efforts to describe how newborn neurons differentiate and incorporate into the adult brain. It has also encouraged studies that investigate the consequences of inadequate neurogenesis in neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative diseases and explore the potential role of neural progenitor cells in brain repair. The adult nervous system is not static; it is subjected to morphological and physiological alterations at various levels. This plastic mechanism guarantees that the behavioral regulation of the adult nervous system is adaptable in response to varying environmental stimuli. Three regions of the adult brain, the olfactory bulb, the hypothalamus, and the hippocampal dentate gyrus, contain new-born neurons that exhibit an essential role in the natural functional circuitry of the adult brain. Purpose/Aim: This article explores current advancements in adult hippocampal neurogenesis by presenting its history and evolution and studying its association with neural plasticity. The article also discusses the prospective roles of adult hippocampal neurogenesis and describes the intracellular, extracellular, pathological, and environmental factors involved in its regulation.

Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common chronic joint disease and leads to the degradation of the extracellular matrix by an imbalance between anabolic and catabolic processes. TGF-β3 (transforming growth factor beta-3) and epidermal growth factor (EGF) influence the osteochondrogenic potential of chondrocytes. In this study, we compared the expression of mediators and receptors in the TGF-β3 and EGF pathways, as well as biglycan (BGN), in healthy and diseased chondrocytes. Furthermore, we used chondrogenic progenitor cells (CPCs) for in vitro stimulation and knockdown experiments to elucidate the effects of TGF-β3 and EGF on the chondrogenic potential. Our results demonstrate that the expression of TGF-beta receptor type-1 (TGFBRI) and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is altered in diseased chondrocytes as well as in CPCs. Moreover, TGF-β3 and EGF stimulation influenced the expression levels of BGN, SRY (sex determining region Y)-box 9 (SOX9), and Runt-related transcription factor 2 (RUNX2) in CPCs. Therefore, changes in TGFBRI and EGFR expression likely contribute to the degenerative and regenerative effects seen in late stages of OA.
The ability of repair and regeneration of tissues or organs has been significantly improved by using biomaterials-based constructs. Our previous studies found the regeneration of both articular cartilage and subchondral bone by implantation of a poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA)/fibrin gel/bone marrow stem cells (BMSCs)/(lipofectamine/pDNA-transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1) construct in vivo, without the step of pre-induced differentiation of the laden stem cells in vitro. To substantiate the ability to regenerate multi-types of tissues by the same constructs, in this study the constructs were implanted into three types of tissues or tissue defects in vivo, including subcutaneous fascia layer, and ear cartilage and eyelid tarsal plate defects. The ear cartilage and eyelid tarsal plate defects were fully regenerated 8 w post-implantation, showing a similar morphology to the corresponding native tissues. In the neo ear cartilage, abundant chondrocytes with obvious lacunas and cartilage-specific extracellular matrices (ECMs) were found. Neo eyelid tarsal plate with mature meibomian gland acinar units was regenerated. Furthermore, expressions of the ECMs-specific genes and proteins, as well as the cell behavior modulatory factors, Sry related HMG box 9 (Sox9) and TGF-β1 were significantly up-regulated in the regenerated ear cartilages and eyelid tarsal plate than those in the subcutaneously implanted constructs, which were filled with fibrocytes, inflammatory cells, obvious vascularization and slight ECMs deposition. These results confirm firmly the ability to regenerate multi-types of tissues by a stem cells-laden construct via adapting to the microenvironments of corresponding tissues.
Sex-determining region Y-box (SRY-box) containing gene 9 (SOX9) expression confers cancer stem cell features. However, SOX9 function in intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (iCCA) is unknown. This study investigated the effects and underlying mechanisms of SOX9 in iCCA.
SOX9 expression in 59 iCCA patients was examined by immunohistochemistry. The association between SOX9 expression and clinical outcome was evaluated. Gene signature and biological functions of SOX9 in iCCA were examined in vitro.
iCCA patients with high SOX9 expression had shorter survival time than those with low SOX9. In patients receiving chemotherapy, median survival time in patients with low and high levels of SOX9 were 62 and 22 months, respectively. In vitro, gemcitabine increased SOX9 expression in iCCA cells. When SOX9 was knocked down, gemcitabine-induced apoptosis was markedly increased. Silencing SOX9 significantly inhibited gemcitabine-induced phosphorylation of checkpoint kinase 1, a key cell cycle checkpoint protein that coordinates the DNA damage response and inhibited the expression of multidrug resistance genes. Microarray analyses showed that SOX9 knockdown in CCA cells altered gene signatures associated with multidrug resistance and p53 signalling.
SOX9 governs the response of CCA cells to chemotherapy. SOX9 is a biomarker to select iCCA patients eligible for efficient chemotherapy.
Paraneoplastic neurological syndromes (PNS) are rare disorders associated with cancer and are believed to be immune mediated. Patients with autonomic PNS suffer from variable combinations of parasympathetic and sympathetic failure. Autonomic PNS are usually associated with other PNS, such as encephalomyelitis and sensory neuropathy; however, autonomic symptoms may rarely manifest as PNS symptoms. Autonomic symptoms, therefore, may be overlooked in patients with cancer.
We described a 65-year-old Japanese man who was diagnosed with autonomic PNS due to small-cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) with Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 3, who suffered from orthostatic hypotension, and urinary retention needing a urethral balloon. Laboratory studies showed decreased levels of noradrenaline, and were positive for anti-ganglionic acetylcholine receptor antibody, type 1 antineuronal nuclear antibody, and sry-like high mobility group box 1 antibody. Nerve conduction evaluations and 123I-metaiodobenzylguanidine myocardial scintigraphy showed no abnormalities. Abdominal contrast-enhanced computed tomography revealed marked colonic distention. The patient's autonomic symptoms resolved following integrated treatment (symptomatic treatment, immunotherapy, and additional chemotherapy) enabling the patient to walk, remove the urethral balloon, and endure further chemotherapy. ECOG performance status remained at 1, 10 months after admission.
Integrated treatment for autonomic PNS may improve autonomic symptoms and ECOG performance status of patients with cancer.
Long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) H19 is abundantly expressed in fetal liver. Its expression is significantly diminished in adult healthy liver but is re-induced in chronic liver diseases, including cholestasis. In this study, we developed a new method with combined 
                        in situ
                     hybridization (ISH) and immunofluorescence (IF) colabeling to establish an H19 expression profile with both parenchymal and nonparenchymal cell-specific markers in the livers of cholestatic mouse models and patients with cholestasis. H19RNA+ cells showed no colocalization with biliary epithelial cell marker cytokeratin 19 (CK19)+ cholangiocytes but were immediately adjacent to biliary structures in bile duct ligation (BDL), 3,5-diethoxycarbony1-1,4-dihydrocollidine (DDC), and multidrug-resistant gene 2 knockout ( 
                        Mdr2
                        
                            -/-
                        
                     ) mouse models and in human primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) and primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) liver specimens. In contrast, double-positive H19RNA+/sex-determining region Y (SRY)-box 9 (SOX9)+ ductal progenitor cells, H19RNA+/hepatocyte nuclear factor 4α (HNF4α)+ hepatocytes, H19RNA+/F4/80+ Kupffer cells, HNF4α+/SOX9+ hybrid hepatocytes, as well as triple-positive 
                        H19
                     RNA+/HNF4α+/SOX9+ periportal hepatocytes were identified. In addition, 
                        H19
                     RNA could not be detected in mesenchymal cell marker desmin+ cells. Furthermore, 
                        H19
                     RNA was predominately detected in cytoplasm with a small amount at the interspace with neighboring cells. 
                        Conclusion:
                    H19RNA is localized in HNF4α+ periportal hepatocytes, SOX9+ ductal progenitor cells, and F4/80+ Kupffer cells but not in CK19+ cholangiocytes and desmin+ stellate cells in cholestatic livers.
Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is the most frequent malignant tumor of the eyelid; it progresses slowly and rarely metastasizes. However, BCC of the eyelid is partially invasive and can extend to the surrounding ocular adnexa even if appropriate treatment is performed. To understand the molecular mechanism underlying its pathogenesis, global gene expression analysis of surgical tissue samples of BCC of the eyelid (n=2) and normal human epidermal keratinocytes was performed using a GeneChip® system. The histopathological examination of surgically removed eyelid tissues showed the tumor nest composed with small basaloid. In the samples from patients 1 and 2, 687 and 713 genes were identified, respectively, demonstrating ≥5.0-fold higher expression than that noted in normal human epidermal keratinocytes. For the 640 genes with upregulated expression in both patient samples, Ingenuity® pathway analysis showed that the gene network in BCC of the eyelid included many BCC-associated genes, such as the following: BCL2 apoptosis regulator; Patched-1; and SRY-box 9. In addition, unique gene networks related to cancer cell growth, tumorigenesis, and cell survival were identified. These results of integrating microarray analyses provide further insights into the molecular mechanisms involved in BCC of the eyelid and may provide a therapeutic approach for this disease.
Sertoli cells are main players in the male gonads development and their study may shed light on 46,XY disorders of sex development (DSD). Mature primary Sertoli cells are incapable of proliferating in prolonged in vitro cultures and the available Sertoli cell models have several limitations since they derive from mouse or human cancer tissues. We differentiated human fibroblasts (HFs)-derived induced pluripotent stem cells into Sertoli-like cells (SLC) and, in order to characterize this new Sertoli cell model, we performed gene expression analyses by NextGeneration Sequencing techniques. This approach revealed that our putative SLC have reduced expression of pluripotency markers and expressed Sertoli cell markers such as SRY-Related HMG-Box 9 (SOX9), vimentin (VIM), and claudin-11 (CLDN-11). More in detail, the transcriptional profile analysis suggested that these cells are in an early stage of Sertoli cells maturation. Harnessing the power of induced pluripotent stem cells, we were able to generate SLC that show genetic and functional similarities to human Sertoli cells (HSerCs). SLC could become an excellent source of patient-specific Sertoli cells that could be of paramount benefit for both basic research and personalized medicine in sex development and reproductive medicine.
Individuals with a 47,XXY karyotype usually present with a male phenotype due to the additional Y chromosome. In this paper, we describe a 47,XXY female who was pregnant with a fetus of the same karyotype based on chromosome analysis of amniotic fluid cells. Further analysis of her Y chromosome indicated that the additional Y chromosome contains no SRY gene on the short arm but carries the azoospermia factor region on the long arm, including azoospermia factor a, b and c (AZFa, AZFb, AZFc). This region may influence her female phenotype. Fertile females with a 47,XXY karyotype and loss of SRY are extremely rare. This paper is the first report of a 47,XXY pregnant woman with a normal phenotype and may enrich our knowledge on 47,XXY individuals.
The cytodiagnosis of melanoma in effusions can be challenging. Although immunohistochemical (IHC) stains such as HMB45, Melan A, and S-100 are often utilized; the role of Sry-related HMG-box gene 10 (SOX10) in the diagnosis of melanoma in effusions has not been previously reported.
A total of 14 confirmed melanoma cases diagnosed on effusion cytology (nine pleural and five peritoneal) were collected from 2000 to 2016. IHC stain for SOX10 was performed and compared with HMB45, Melan A, and S-100. To evaluate the specificity of SOX10, we stained 47 previously diagnosed nonmelanocytic malignant effusions. A cut-off of &gt;1 positively staining cells was considered positive. The intensity of staining was graded as weak, moderate, and strong.
All 14 melanoma cases were positive for SOX10 and HMB45 (100%), compared to 12 cases (86%) using Melan A and S-100. Among 47 previously diagnosed nonmelanocytic malignant effusions (4 malignant mesotheliomas, 12 müllerian tumors, 9 breast carcinomas, 9 lung adenocarcinomas, and 13 hematologic tumors), SOX10 and HMB45 showed a specificity of 98%, whereas Melan A and S100 had a specificity of 100%.
The sensitivity of SOX10 for melanoma in effusions is comparable with HMB45 with a 100% sensitivity. In terms of staining intensity, HMB45 appeared to be superior as it showed 100% moderate to strong intensity compared to 72% for SOX10. All four markers showed near-100% specificity in differentiating melanoma from nonmelanocytic malignant effusions. A combination of HMB45 and SOX10 might be useful as the initial stains of choice in diagnosing melanoma in effusion cytology.

Prognosis of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) patients is poor and the concurrent chemoradiation therapy (CCRT) provided to ESCC patients often failed due to resistance. Therefore, development of biomarkers for predicting CCRT response is immensely important. In this study, we evaluated the predicting value of SRY (sex determining region Y)-box 17 (SOX17) protein during CCRT and its dysregulation of transcriptional targets in CCRT resistance in ESCC.
Pyrosequencing methylation, RT-qPCR and immunohistochemistry assays were performed to examine the DNA methylation, mRNA expression and protein expression levels of SOX17 in endoscopic biopsy from a total of 70 ESCC patients received CCRT. Cell proliferation, clonogenic survival and xenograft growth were used to confirm the sensitization of ESCC cell line KYSE510 in response to cisplatin, radiation or CCRT treatment by SOX17 overexpression in vitro and in vivo. Luciferase activity, RT-qPCR and ChIP-qPCR assays were conducted to examine transcription regulation of SOX17 in KYSE510 parental, KYSE510 radio-resistant cells and their derived xenografts.
High DNA methylation coincided with low mRNA and protein expression levels of SOX17 in pre-treatment endoscopic biopsy from ESCC patients with poor CCRT response. SOX17 protein expression exhibited a good prediction performance in discriminating poor CCRT responders from good responder. Overexpression of SOX17 sensitized KYSE510 radio-resistant cells to cisplatin, radiation or CCRT treatment in cell and xenograft models. Importantly, SOX17 transcriptionally down-regulated DNA repair and damage response-related genes including BRCA1, BRCA2, RAD51, KU80 DNAPK, p21, SIRT1, NFAT5 and REV3L in KYSE510 radio-resistant cells to achieve the sensitization effect to anti-cancer treatment. Low expression of BRCA1, DNAPK, p21, RAD51 and SIRT1 was confirmed in SOX17 sensitized xenograft tissues derived from radio-resistant ESCC cells.
Our study reveals a novel mechanism by which SOX17 transcriptionally inactivates DNA repair and damage response-related genes to sensitize ESCC cell or xenograft to CCRT treatment. In addition, we establish a proof-of-concept CCRT prediction biomarker using SOX17 immunohistochemical staining in pre-treatment endoscopic biopsies to identify ESCC patients who are at high risk of CCRT failure and need intensive care.
The regulatory mechanism of insulin-producing cells (IPCs) differentiation from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) in vitro is very important in the phylogenetics of pancreatic islets, the molecular pathogenesis of diabetes, and the acquisition of high-quality pancreatic β-cells derived from stem cells for cell therapy.
miPSCs were induced for IPCs differentiation. miRNA microarray assays were performed by using total RNA from our iPCs-derived IPCs containing undifferentiated iPSCs and iPSCs-derived IPCSs at day 4, day 14, and day 21 during step 3 to screen the differentially expressed miRNAs (DEmiRNAs) related to IPCs differentiation, and putative target genes of DEmiRNAs were predicted by bioinformatics analysis. miR-690 was selected for further research, and MPCs were transfected by miR-690-agomir to confirm whether it was involved in the regulation of IPCs differentiation in iPSCs. Quantitative Real-Time PCR (qRT-PCR), Western blotting, and immunostaining assays were performed to examine the pancreatic function of IPCs at mRNA and protein level respectively. Flow cytometry and ELISA were performed to detect differentiation efficiency and insulin content and secretion from iPSCs-derived IPCs in response to stimulation at different concentration of glucose. The targeting of the 3'-untranslated region of Sox9 by miR-690 was examined by luciferase assay.
We found that miR-690 was expressed dynamically during IPCs differentiation according to the miRNA array results and that overexpression of miR-690 significantly impaired the maturation and insulinogenesis of IPCs derived from iPSCs both in vitro and in vivo. Bioinformatic prediction and mechanistic analysis revealed that miR-690 plays a pivotal role during the differentiation of IPCs by directly targeting the transcription factor sex-determining region Y (SRY)-box9. Furthermore, downstream experiments indicated that miR-690 is likely to act as an inactivated regulator of the Wnt signaling pathway in this process.
We discovered a previously unknown interaction between miR-690 and sox9 but also revealed a new regulatory signaling pathway of the miR-690/Sox9 axis during iPSCs-induced IPCs differentiation.
Paired cartilage and subchondral bone of subjects with no clinical history of joint disorders were analyzed to determine whether antioxidant enzymes, inflammatory cytokines and growth factors can be linked to a pre-osteoarthritis. Tissue explants were phenotyped according to Osteoarthritis Research Society International grading and micro-computed tomography, and also screened for the expression of several markers using quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The expression of these same genes was measured in SW1353 cells treated with hydrogen peroxide, to gain insight into the pathways involved with oxidative stress responses. Vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A) was up-regulated in the cartilage samples that showed early cartilage or bone degeneration. Oxidative stress in chondrocytes provoked up-regulation of interleukin-1β, interleukin-6, aggrecan, and SRY-box containing gene 9. Our results confirm the hitherto evidence of the deteriorating effects of the oxidative stress on cartilage and suggest the link between VEGF-A and pre-osteoarthritis.
Single embryo culture is essential for culturing embryos derived from few oocytes obtained from elite cows through ultrasonography guidance. Bovine in vitro fertilization (IVF) and individual embryo culture is a challenge as it generally leads to impaired embryo development. In this study, we explored the embryonic development and the sex ratio of IVF-derived bovine embryo cultured individually in chemically defined two-step culture medium. Total 63 cumulus-oocyte complexes were collected, in vitro matured, in vitro fertilized and the resultant fertilized oocytes were randomly cultured individually (4 trials, 15-16 oocytes each) in microdrops of 5 µL of a chemically defined two-step culture medium. Blastocysts were counted in every trial (n = 32, 50.79%) and all of them were used for both genomic DNA and total RNA extraction, cDNA synthesis and PCR using specific primers for GAPDH, GDP6, XIST and SRY genes. Results showed significant difference in expression of XIST (positive expression in 11 blastocysts) and SRY (positive expression in 21 blastocysts) mRNAs, P &lt; .05. This result supports the hypothesis of sexual dimorphism among the pre-implantation in vitro produced embryos and provides an efficient medium for single bovine embryos in vitro production.
Dietary polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) can influence fertility in farm animals. Some evidence in mice and sheep have suggested that PUFAs may influence offspring sex ratio, which may have significant value for cattle production. To test this hypothesis, three groups of Holstein cows were supplemented with either 0%, 3% or 5% protected fat (PF) in the form of calcium salt of fatty acids (rich in omega-6) from 14-21 days pre-partum until conception. Proven-fertile frozen semen from the same ejaculate was used for insemination. Calf sex recorded at birth was 8/19 (42.1%) male offspring in the control group, increasing to 14/20 (70%, P &gt; 0.05) and 17/20 (85%, P &lt; 0.05) in 3% and 5% PF, respectively. To test if this effect was caused by a direct influence on the oocyte, we supplemented bovine cumulus oocyte complexes during in vitro maturation with either omega-3 alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), omega-6 linoleic acid (LA) or trans-10, cis-12 conjugated linoleic acid (CLA). Sex ratio of the produced transferable embryos was determined using PCR of SRY gene. Similar to the in vivo results, sex ratio was skewed to the male side in the embryos derived from LA- and CLA-treated oocytes (79% and 71%) compared to control and ALA-treated oocytes (44% and 54%, respectively). These results indicate that both dietary and in vitro supplementation of omega-6 PUFAs can skew the sex ratio towards the male side in cattle. Further experiments are required to confirm this effect on a larger scale and to study the mechanisms of action that might be involved.
Klinefelter syndrome(KS), affecting 1 in 500-1,000 newborn males, is the most common sex chromosome aneuploidy among males with primary hypogonadism. Isochromosome Xq on the other hand is a rare variant of Klinefelter syndrome, accounting approximately 0.3% of all KS and associated with normal height and androgenisation compared to classical KS. Here, we present a case of isochromosome Xq variant of KS with similar clinical and cytogenetic findings with the few cases reported before.
A 25-year-old male patient referred to our clinic with complaint of infertility. He is the son of a consanguineous couple who are first cousins and there was no family history of reproductive difficulty. In physical examination synophrys, prominent ear and small testicles noted. The patient's spermiogram showed azoospermia and scrotal USG revealed testicular atrophy.
Karyotype analysis using G-banding resulted as 47,X,i(X)(q10),Y, and STR analysis showed no deletion in AZF and SRY loci of interest.
Although several isochromosome Xq variant of KS cases can be found in literature, it is our duty to emphasise the importance of karyotyping for patients with reproductive difficulty who may not have all features of classical Klinefelter syndrome.
SRY-negative 46,XX testicular disorders of sex development (DSD) are very rare conditions. Recently, we identified a novel heterozygous NR5A1 mutation, p.Arg92Trp (c.274C&gt;T, p.R92W), in 2 unrelated cases of 46,XX testicular/ovotesticular DSD. We report the clinical course from infancy to puberty in a Japanese male with SRY-negative 46,XX testicular DSD, carrying this p.Arg92Trp mutation in NR5A1. The patient naturally acquired the development of a penis and pubic hair during puberty. However, hypergonadotropic hypogonadism subsequently developed. More clinical cases will be needed to fully understand the effects of the p.Arg92Trp mutation on the ability to maintain testosterone secretion in 46,XX testicular DSD.
Presence of chromosomal anomalies is well known to be associated with reproductive failures where the incidence of chromosomal translocations is higher. Y:1 chromosomal translocations are reported to be rare and may have variable phenotypic effects such as infertility amongst others. The patient presented with azoospermia and dyslipidemia and coronary arterial disease. Cytogenetic tests such as karyotyping revealed the translocation, and fluorescent in situ hybridisation was performed to investigate the presence or absence of SRY gene. The SRY gene was found to be located on the p arm of the derivative Y chromosome. The test for Y chromosome microdeletions was reported to be negative for the AZF gene regions tested. Here we report the first case of Y:1 chromosomal translocation involving the break points (q11.2;p21) from India.
It has been reported that the intake of milk basic protein (MBP) increases bone density by promoting bone formation and suppressing bone resorption. However, few studies have been done on MBP in cartilage, the tissue adjacent to bone. We therefore investigated the effect of MBP on a chondrocyte cell line, ATDC5. In a proliferative assay using the WST-1 method, the addition of 10, 100, and 1,000 µg/mL of MBP to ATDC5 cells significantly increased the cell number by about 1.2-, 1.5-, and 1.7-fold, respectively, compared with the control cells. The cell cycle analysis using flow-cytometry revealed that the proportion of S- and G2/M-phase cells was increased but that of G0/G1 phase was decreased in a dose-dependent manner with MBP addition. We measured the alkaline phosphatase activity of MBP-treated ATDC5 cells to examine the differentiation stage of the cells. Alkaline phosphatase activity was suppressed in a dose-dependent manner with MBP addition and was especially drastic at higher doses of MBP (100 and 1,000 µg/mL). The Alizarin Red S staining intensity, the indicator for calcification of cells, was lower in the MBP-treated (100 µg/mL) cells than in nontreated control cells. In the reverse-transcription PCR experiment, the mRNA level of SRY-box containing gene 9 (Sox9) and type II collagen (Col2) was significantly increased in the MBP-treated cells compared with the control cells. A significant decrease of the mRNA level of runt-related transcription factor 2 (Runx2) and type X collagen (Col10) was also observed in the MBP-treated cells. These results suggested that MBP promoted the proliferation of chondrocytes by suppressing their differentiation toward calcification.
Dioxins and related compounds induce morphological abnormalities in developing animals in an aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR)-dependent manner. Here we review the studies in which 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) is used as a prototypical compound to elucidate the pathogenesis of morphological abnormalities. TCDD-induced cleft palate in fetal mice involves a delay in palatogenesis and dissociation of fused palate shelves. TCDD-induced hydronephrosis, once considered to be caused by the anatomical obstruction of the ureter, is now separated into TCDD-induced obstructive and non-obstructive hydronephrosis, which develops during fetal and neonatal periods, respectively. In the latter, a prostaglandin E₂ synthesis pathway and urine concentration system are involved. TCDD-induced abnormal development of prostate involves agenesis of the ventral lobe. A suggested mechanism is that AhR activation in the urogenital sinus mesenchyme by TCDD modulates the wingless-type MMTV integration site family (WNT)/β-catenin signaling cascade to interfere with budding from urogenital sinus epithelium. TCDD exposure to zebrafish embryos induces loss of epicardium progenitor cells and heart malformation. AHR2-dependent downregulation of Sox9b expression in cardiomyocytes is a suggested underlying mechanism. TCDD-induced craniofacial malformation in zebrafish is considered to result from the AHR2-dependent reduction in SRY-box 9b (SOX9b), probably partly via the noncoding RNA slincR, resulting in the underdevelopment of chondrocytes and cartilage.
To explore the clinical features and genetic diagnosis of two cases with rare diseases and X chromosome abnormalities.
Multiple ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) and karyotype analysis were carried out on an 8-year-old girl who was diagnosed with Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Karyotype analysis and PCR assay for SRY and AZF genes were carried out for a-2-month-old male infant with short penis.
The girl, who featured short stature and cubitus valgus, was diagnosed as Turner syndrome with a karyotype of 46,X,i(Xq). The male infant was detected with a karyotype of 45,X, with presence of SRY gene but absence of AZF gene.
Both cases may be associated with abnormalities of X chromosome. Genetic testing can facilitate early diagnosis and clinical intervention for such patients.
Females have more robust immune responses than males, well-illustrated by the degree of inflammation elicited during delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) responses. Here, we have investigated underlying sex differences that may contribute to differential footpad DTH responses using wildtype and four core genotypes (FCG) mice and popliteal lymphnode cellularity and gene expression. DTH responses in XX and XY FCG females showed no role for almost all genes expressed on sex chromosomes. After then filtering-out genes differentially expressed between XX and XY females, only one gene was sexually differentially expressed in wildtype mice, glycosylation-dependent cell adhesion molecule 1 (Glycam1), expressed 7-fold higher in females. Glycam1 facilitates leukocyte entry through high endothelial venules. Consistent with greater Glycam1 expression, female nodes contained twice as many cells. While females had more memory T cells in their nodes, males had a higher percentage of T regulatory cells. This sexual dimorphism in wildtype animals manifested pre-pubertally, was enhanced post-pubertally, and was eliminated by castration. The formation of male gonads is determined by the expression of Sry. Sry overexpression, which does not affect testosterone levels, produced an exaggerated male phenotype. We conclude that Sry expression through formation of the male gonad indirectly negatively impacts the potential for local inflammation.
Objective- Calcific aortic valve disease is a prominent finding in elderly and in patients with chronic kidney disease. We investigated the potential role of iron metabolism in the pathogenesis of calcific aortic valve disease. Approach and Results- Cultured valvular interstitial cells of stenotic aortic valve with calcification from patients undergoing valve replacement exhibited significant susceptibility to mineralization/osteoblastic transdifferentiation in response to phosphate. This process was abrogated by iron via induction of H-ferritin as reflected by lowering ALP and osteocalcin secretion and preventing extracellular calcium deposition. Cellular phosphate uptake and accumulation of lysosomal phosphate were decreased. Accordingly, expression of phosphate transporters Pit1 and Pit2 were repressed. Translocation of ferritin into lysosomes occurred with high phosphate-binding capacity. Importantly, ferritin reduced nuclear accumulation of RUNX2 (Runt-related transcription factor 2), and as a reciprocal effect, it enhanced nuclear localization of transcription factor Sox9 (SRY [sex-determining region Y]-box 9). Pyrophosphate generation was also increased via upregulation of ENPP2 (ectonucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase-2). 3H-1, 2-dithiole-3-thione mimicked these beneficial effects in valvular interstitial cell via induction of H-ferritin. Ferroxidase activity of H-ferritin was essential for this function, as ceruloplasmin exhibited similar inhibitory functions. Histological analysis of stenotic aortic valve revealed high expression of H-ferritin without iron accumulation and its relative dominance over ALP in noncalcified regions. Increased expression of H-ferritin accompanied by elevation of TNF-α (tumor necrosis factor-α) and IL-1β (interleukin-1β) levels, inducers of H-ferritin, corroborates the essential role of ferritin/ferroxidase via attenuating inflammation in calcific aortic valve disease. Conclusions- Our results indicate that H-ferritin is a stratagem in mitigating valvular mineralization/osteoblastic differentiation. Utilization of 3H-1, 2-dithiole-3-thione to induce ferritin expression may prove a novel therapeutic potential in valvular mineralization.
If turner syndrome (TS) patients have a Y-containing cell line, they have an increased risk for gonadal tumors. TS patients are therefore screened for Y-chromosome and Y-specific sequences, such as SRY, DYZ1, DYZ3, DYS132, ZFY, TSPY, etc. In addition, since the dysgenetic gonad may include the stroma and granulosa/sertoli cells, which produce androgens, virilization can seen in girls with Y-chromosomal material. Prophylactic gonadectomy may therefore be required for optimal management in such patients. Our aim is to discuss our observations in the follow-up of TS patients.
SRY was investigated in 71 out of 85 TS cases (aged 3 months-27 years) between 2005 and 2017. Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) was used until 2014, after which SRY analysis was performed using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method. SRY analysis was performed a second time using PCR in 25 cases previously investigated with FISH.
We identified no positive cases. No pathological findings in terms of virilization, clitoromegaly, or posterior labial adhesions were also determined in our TS cases. Further studies were not required since no pathological findings also were detected at ultrasonography.
If Y-chromosome material has not been detected by conventional cytogenetic methods in TS patients with masculine features, further techniques should be applied to prevent the risk of invasive tumors, such as multiple sequences beside the Y centromere. This approach will prevent overtreatment.
Brain sexual differentiation is sculpted by precise coordination of steroid hormones during development. Programming of several brain regions in males depends upon aromatase conversion of testosterone to estrogen. However, it is not clear the direct contribution that Y chromosome associated genes, especially sex-determining region Y (Sry), might exert on brain sexual differentiation in therian mammals. Two species of spiny rats: Amami spiny rat (Tokudaia osimensis) and Tokunoshima spiny rat (T. tokunoshimensis) lack a Y chromosome/Sry, and these individuals possess an XO chromosome system in both sexes. Both Tokudaia species are highly endangered. To assess the neural transcriptome profile in male and female Amami spiny rats, RNA was isolated from brain samples of adult male and female spiny rats that had died accidentally and used for RNAseq analyses.
RNAseq analyses confirmed that several genes and individual transcripts were differentially expressed between males and females. In males, seminal vesicle secretory protein 5 (Svs5) and cytochrome P450 1B1 (Cyp1b1) genes were significantly elevated compared to females, whereas serine (or cysteine) peptidase inhibitor, clade A, member 3 N (Serpina3n) was upregulated in females. Many individual transcripts elevated in males included those encoding for zinc finger proteins, e.g. zinc finger protein X-linked (Zfx).
This method successfully identified several genes and transcripts that showed expression differences in the brain of adult male and female Amami spiny rat. The functional significance of these findings, especially differential expression of transcripts encoding zinc finger proteins, in this unusual rodent species remains to be determined.
Desmoplastic malignant melanoma (DMM) is an amelanotic spindle cell proliferation that can be mistaken for a cutaneous scar. The distinction can be difficult in reexcisions because DMM is negative for conventional melanoma markers such as HMB-45 and Melan-A, and scars may be positive for S-100 protein and SOX-10. We compare a total of 12 DMM cases with 8 reexcision and 35 old non-reexcision cutaneous scars using SOX-10 immunohistochemical stains. Cell quantification was performed on captured images using ImageJ 1.51t. SOX-10 was expressed in DMM (100%, 12/12), and reexcision (75%, 6/8), atrophic (88%, 22/25), hypertrophic (100%, 8/8), and keloid-type (100%, 2/2) scars. The cellular density of SOX-10 positive cells in DMM (822.9±116.9 cells/mm, mean±SEM) was significantly higher than in any scar subgroup (hypertrophic: 188.4±20.40 cells/mm, atrophic: 83.78±11.13 cells/mm, reexcision: 96.72±30.13 cells/mm, P&lt;0.0001). Hypercellular areas in reexcision scars showed dense positivity as hypocellular areas in DMM (upper limit for scars: 258.42 positive cells/mm vs. lower limit for DMM: 292.42 positive cells/mm). SOX-10 positive cells in scars are predominantly monomorphic and small following the overall directionality of the tissue. In contrast, DMM cells exhibited enlarged atypical nuclei with a haphazard distribution, invasion as single cells or in clusters, and tropism for adnexal structures (58%) and neurovascular bundles (67%). In conclusion, cutaneous scars contain SOX-10 positive cells. The evaluation of residual DMM needs careful attention to morphologic characteristics to avoid over-interpretation of SOX-10 immunostains.
Low-intensity pulsed ultrasound (LIPUS) can induce mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) differentiation, although the mechanism of its potential effects on chondrogenic differentiation is unknown. Since autophagy is known to regulate the differentiation of MSCs, the aim of our study was to determine whether LIPUS induced chondrogenesis via autophagy regulation.
MSCs were isolated from the rat bone marrow, cultured in either standard or chondrogenic medium, and stimulated with 3 MHz of LIPUS given in 20% on-off cycles, with or without prior addition of an autophagy inhibitor or agonist. Chondrogenesis was evaluated on the basis of aggrecan (AGG) organization and the amount of type II collagen (COL2) and the mRNA expression of AGG, COL2, and SRY-related high mobility group-box gene 9 (SOX9) genes.
LIPUS promoted the chondrogenic differentiation of MSCs, as shown by the changes in the extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins and upregulation of chondrogenic genes, and these effects were respectively augmented and inhibited by the autophagy inhibitor and agonist.
Taken together, these results indicate that LIPUS promotes MSC chondrogenesis by inhibiting autophagy.
SOX4, together with SOX11 and SOX12, forms group C of SRY-related (SOX) transcription factors. They play key roles, often in redundancy, in multiple developmental pathways, including neurogenesis and skeletogenesis. De novo SOX11 heterozygous mutations have been shown to cause intellectual disability, growth deficiency, and dysmorphic features compatible with mild Coffin-Siris syndrome. Using trio-based exome sequencing, we here identify de novo SOX4 heterozygous missense variants in four children who share developmental delay, intellectual disability, and mild facial and digital morphological abnormalities. SOX4 is highly expressed in areas of active neurogenesis in human fetuses, and sox4 knockdown in Xenopus embryos diminishes brain and whole-body size. The SOX4 variants cluster in the highly conserved, SOX family-specific HMG domain, but each alters a different residue. In silico tools predict that each variant affects a distinct structural feature of this DNA-binding domain, and functional assays demonstrate that these SOX4 proteins carrying these variants are unable to bind DNA in vitro and transactivate SOX reporter genes in cultured cells. These variants are not found in the gnomAD database of individuals with presumably normal development, but 12 other SOX4 HMG-domain missense variants are recorded and all demonstrate partial to full activity in the reporter assay. Taken together, these findings point to specific SOX4 HMG-domain missense variants as the cause of a characteristic human neurodevelopmental disorder associated with mild facial and digital dysmorphism.
Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women worldwide, and approximately 70% of breast cancers are hormone receptor-positive and express estrogen receptor-α (ERα) or/and progesterone receptor. Therapies targeting ERα have been successfully used in patients with ERα+ breast cancer. However, intrinsic or acquired resistance to anti-estrogen therapy presents a major challenge. The Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway regulates various processes that are important for cancer progression, and emerging evidences have shown a close interaction between Wnt/β-catenin and ERα signaling. miR-190 is also involved in ER signaling and our previous study indicated that miR-190 suppresses breast cancer metastasis.
The effect of miR-190 on breast cancer anti-estrogen sensitivity was investigated both in vitro and in vivo. The protein expression levels and localization were analyzed by western blotting and immunofluorescence, respectively. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and dual-luciferase reporter assays were used to validate the regulation of the zinc-finger E-box binding homeobox 1/ ERα-miR-190-SRY-related high mobility group box 9 (ZEB1/ERα-miR-190-SOX9) axis.
miR-190 increased the anti-estrogen sensitivity of breast cancer cells both in vitro and in vivo. miR-190 inhibited Wnt/β-catenin signaling by targeting SOX9, and its expression inversely correlated with that of SOX9 in breast cancer samples. Furthermore, ERα and ZEB1 competitively regulated miR-190 expression.
Our data uncover the ZEB1/ERα-miR-190-SOX9 axis and suggest a mechanism by which the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway is involved in breast cancer anti-estrogen therapy.
The bipotential nature of cell types in the early developing gonad and the process of sex determination leading to either testis or ovary differentiation makes this an interesting system in which to study transcriptional regulation of gene expression and cell fate decisions. SOX9 is a transcription factor with multiple roles during development, including being a key player in mediating testis differentiation and therefore subsequent male development. Loss of Sox9 expression in both humans and mice results in XY female development, whereas its inappropriate activation in XX embryonic gonads can give male development. Multiple cases of Disorders of Sex Development in human patients or sex reversal in mice and other vertebrates can be explained by mutations affecting upstream regulators of Sox9 expression, such as the product of the Y chromosome gene Sry that triggers testis differentiation. Other cases are due to mutations in the Sox9 gene itself, including its own regulatory region. Indeed, rearrangements in and around the Sox9 genomic locus indicate the presence of multiple critical enhancers and the complex nature of its regulation. Here we summarize what is known about the role of Sox9 and its regulation during gonad development, including recently discovered critical enhancers. We also discuss higher order chromatin organization and how this might be involved. We end with some interesting future directions that have the potential to further enrich our understanding on the complex, multi-layered regulation controlling Sox9 expression in the gonads.
Mammalian sex determination is triggered by activation of the mammalian sex-determining gene, Sry, in a spatially and temporally controlled manner. Because reduced or delayed Sry expression results in male-to-female sex reversal, male development is highly dependent on the accurate transcription of Sry. SRY dysregulation is a potential cause of human disorders of sex development (DSD). In addition to changes in DNA sequences, gene expression is regulated by epigenetic mechanisms. Epigenetic regulation ensures spatial and temporal accuracy of the expression of developmentally regulated genes. Epigenetic regulation such as histone tail modification, DNA methylation, chromatin remodeling, and non-coding RNA regulation engages several biological processes in multicellular organisms. In recent years, it has been revealed that various types of epigenetic regulation are involved in accurate gonadal differentiation in mammals. In particular, histone modification plays an integral part in sex determination, which is the first step of gonadal differentiation. Here, we focus on the findings on the epigenetic modifications that regulate Sry expression. Finally, we discuss the role of metabolism that potentially alters the epigenetic state in response to environmental cues.

                        Aim:
                     The amelogenin gene is a widely used gender marker for forensic DNA profiling. Males who have the amelogenin Y (AMELY) allele deletion can be mistakenly identified as females if genotyping is performed only on the amelogenin gene. The aim of this study was to investigate the frequency of the AMELY allele deletion in the Chinese Han population and analyze the possible genetic variation on the Y chromosome. 
                        Materials and Methods:
                     The amelogenin gene of 12,735 unrelated males from the Chinese Han population were genotyped using common forensic short tandem repeat (STR) kits. The AMELY allele deletion was verified by redesigned primers and sequencing. Eighteen Y-specific sequence tagged sites (STSs) on the Yp11.2 region were selected to delineate the deletion breakpoints on the Y chromosome. 
                        Results:
                     Three males were confirmed to have no AMELY allele. The frequency rate of the AMELY-null allele was 0.236% (3/12,735) in the Chinese Han population of Central China; 2.73 Mb of sequence on the Y chromosome were absent in all the AMELY-negative samples. The deleted region was mapped using SRY, AMELY, 5 Y-STRs, and 18 STSs, which belong to the class I deleted pattern. The three unrelated males shared the same Y-STR haplotype with four males from other Chinese populations, all of whom have the AMELY-null allele. The haplogroup of these males was identified as the O3 haplogroup. 
                        Conclusion:
                     The AMELY allele deletion in the Chinese population was accompanied by the deletion of the Y-STR loci on the Yp11.2 region. Therefore, another Y-specific marker should be tested simultaneously when unknown samples are examined as part of a criminal investigation.
Liver regeneration after most forms of injury is mediated through the proliferation of hepatocytes. However, when hepatocyte proliferation is impaired, such as during chronic liver disease, liver progenitor cells (LPCs) arising from the biliary epithelial cell (BEC) compartment can give rise to hepatocytes to mediate hepatic repair. Promotion of LPC-to-hepatocyte differentiation in patients with chronic liver disease could serve as a potentially new therapeutic option, but first requires the identification of the molecular mechanisms driving this process. Notch signaling has been identified as an important signaling pathway promoting the BEC fate during development and has also been implicated in regulating LPC differentiation during regeneration. SRY-related HMG box transcription factor 9 (Sox9) is a direct target of Notch signaling in the liver, and Sox9 has also been shown to promote the BEC fate during development. We have recently shown in a zebrafish model of LPC-driven liver regeneration that inhibition of Hdac1 activity through MS-275 treatment enhances sox9b expression in LPCs and impairs LPC-to-hepatocyte differentiation. Therefore, we hypothesized that inhibition of Notch signaling would promote LPC-to-hepatocyte differentiation by repressing sox9b expression in zebrafish. We ablated the hepatocytes of Tg(fabp10a:CFP-NTR) larvae and blocked Notch activation during liver regeneration through treatment with γ-secretase inhibitor LY411575 and demonstrated enhanced induction of Hnf4a in LPCs. Alternatively, enhancing Notch signaling via Notch3 intracellular domain (N3ICD) overexpression impaired Hnf4a induction. Hepatocyte ablation in sox9b heterozygous mutant embryos enhanced Hnf4a induction, while BEC-specific Sox9b overexpression impaired LPC-to-hepatocyte differentiation. Our results establish the Notch-Sox9b signaling axis as inhibitory to LPC-to-hepatocyte differentiation in a well-established in vivo LPC-driven liver regeneration model.
The SRY (Sex Determining Region Y)-related HMG box of DNA binding proteins, referred to as SOX transcription factors, were first identified as critical regulators of male sex determination but are now known to play an important role in vascular development and disease. SOX7, 17, and 18 are essential in endothelial differentiation and SOX2 has emerged as an essential mediator of endothelial-mesenchymal transitions (EndMTs), a mechanism that enables the endothelium to contribute cells with abnormal cell differentiation to vascular disease such as calcific vasculopathy. In the following paper, we review published information on the SOX transcription factors in endothelial differentiation and hypothesize that SOX2 acts as a mediator of EndMTs that contribute to vascular calcification.
Non-invasive molecular sexing methods are useful in captive breeding programs and field studies; these methods enable sex identification without immobilisation or stressful handling of animals. We developed a method enabling fast and reliable sex identification in three species with limited external sexual dimorphism: the brown and spotted hyenas and the aardvark. We used the sex determining region Y (SRY) gene as the male-specific sequence and the c-myc gene, highly conserved among mammals, as the control sequence present in both sexes. Primers designed on the basis of the feline and human SRY gene enabled us to amplify and sequence the SRY gene fragment in hyenas and the aardvark. Subsequently, we used specific primers designed on the basis of the newly obtained sequences for sex determination in two brown hyenas, three spotted hyenas and six aardvarks. The sequences of the SRY gene fragments were further studied. Interspecies comparisons revealed high similarity in SRY sequences between both hyena species, as well as their relationships with the Felidae lineage. The aardvark, as the only species of the order Tubulidentata (Afrotheria), showed SRY gene similarities with Sirenia and Primates. Knowledge of phylogenetic relationships can be beneficial in genetic studies focused on species with limited sequence data.
Liver cancer was the fourth leading cause of cancer-related death in 2015. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common type of liver cancer. miR-1-3p plays important roles in cancer, including prostate, bladder, lung cancer, and colorectal carcinoma. The function of miR-1-3p in HCC remains poorly understood.
qRT-PCR was performed to detect the miR-1-3p expression in HCC cell lines (HCCLM3, Hep3B, Bel-7404, SMMC-7721) and the normal human hepatic cell line (LO2). HCCLM3 and Bel-7404 cells were transfected with miR-1-3p mimic or scramble control followed by water-soluble tetrazolium salt (WST-1) assay. Western bolt analysis was performed to determine the protein levels. TargetScan7.1 (http://www.targetscan.org/vert_71/) was used to predict the potential targets of miR-1-3p. SRY (sex determining region Y)-box 9 (SOX9), which has been previously shown to play an important role in HCC, was found to be a target of miR-1-3p. Luciferase reporter assay was used to explore the targeting of miR-1-3p on SOX9. For in vivo tumorigenesis assay, HCCLM3 cells with stable overexpression of miR-1-3p or control plasmid were injected subcutaneously into the flank of the SCID mice and animals were monitored for tumor growth.
miR-1-3p was significantly downregulated in HCC cell lines (HCCLM3, Hep3B, Bel-7404, and SMMC-7721) compared to normal human hepatic cell line (LO2). Overexpression of miR-1-3p significantly inhibited the proliferation and induced apoptosis in HCCLM3 and Bel-7474 cells. SOX9 was a direct target of miR-1-3p in HCC cells. Inhibition of SOX9 significantly inhibited the proliferation of HCCLM3 and Bel-7474 cells. In vivo, overexpression of miR-1-3p decreased tumor volume in a xenograft model.
These results highlight the role of miR-1-3p in HCC. Overexpression of miR-1-3P inhibited the proliferation of HCC at least partly due to the regulation of SOX9. miR-1-3p may be a promising therapeutic candidate for HCC.
IL-33, levels of which are known to be increased in patients with eosinophilic asthma and which is suggested as a therapeutic target for it, activates endothelial cells in which Sry-related high-mobility-group box (Sox) 17, an endothelium-specific transcription factor, was upregulated.
We investigated the relationship between Sox17 and IL-33 and the possible role of Sox17 in the pathogenesis of asthma using a mouse model of airway inflammation.
We used ovalbumin (OVA) to induce airway inflammation in endothelium-specific Sox17 null mutant mice and used IL-33 neutralizing antibody to evaluate the interplay between IL-33 and Sox17. We evaluated airway inflammation and measured levels of various cytokines, chemokines, and adhesion molecules. We also carried out loss- or gain-of-function experiments for Sox17 in human endothelial cells.
Levels of IL-33 and Sox17 were significantly increased in the lungs of OVA-challenged mice. Anti-IL-33 neutralizing antibody treatment attenuated not only OVA-induced airway inflammation but also Sox17 expression in pulmonary endothelial cells. Importantly, endothelium-specific deletion of Sox17 resulted in significant alleviation of various clinical features of asthma, including airway inflammation, immune cell infiltration, cytokine/chemokine production, and airway hyperresponsiveness. Sox17 deletion also resulted in decreased densities of Ly6chigh monocytes and inflammatory dendritic cells in the lungs. In IL-33-stimulated human endothelial cells, Sox17 showed positive correlation with CCL2 and intercellular adhesion molecule 1 levels. Lastly, Sox17 promoted monocyte adhesion to endothelial cells and upregulated the extracellular signal-regulated kinase-signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 pathway.
Sox17 was regulated by IL-33, and its genetic ablation in endothelial cells resulted in alleviation of asthma-related pathophysiologic features. Sox17 might be a potential target for asthma management.
Partial androgen insensitivity syndrome (PAIS) is a form of disorders of sexual development. Besides the issues of gender assignment, the fate of gonads in these patients poses a challenging problem. Debate still remains on the need and/or timing of gonadectomy in either complete or partial androgen insensitivity syndromes. In this case report, we present a 68-year-old patient who was raised as a woman, stayed married for 45 years and admitted to our endocrinology department with complaint of male type hair distribution after initial examination following move to a nursing home. Physical examination revealed no breast development, a phallus of 6 cm, labia majoras that include testes and a blind ending vagina. Chromosomal analysis confirmed 46,XY with intact SRY and AZF regions. Pelvic ultrasonography and magnetic resonance imaging results indicated testicular tissue in labia majoras in addition to a rudimentary prostate. Gonadectomy was not offered to the patient due to lacking evidence of benefit in this age group and considering possible hormonal side effects. Our patient might be the oldest patient to be diagnosed with PAIS. Treatment and follow-up protocols for adults with PAIS are not standardized and therefore these patients should be individually evaluated and treated. Risks and benefits of surgery should be kept in mind when suggesting gonadectomy.
Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a severe nervous system disease with high morbidity and disability rate. Signaling pathways play a key role in the neuronal restorative mechanism following SCI. SRY-related high mobility group (HMG)-box gene 9 (SOX9) affects glial scar formation via Transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) signaling pathway. Activation of nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) is transferred into nucleus to upregulate TGF-β-SOX9. Curcumin exhibits potent anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant properties. Curcumin can play an important role in SCI recovery by inhibiting the expression of NF-κB and TGF-β-SOX9. Herein, we review the potential mechanism of curcumin-inhibiting SOX9 signaling pathway in SCI treatment. The inhibition of NF-κB and SOX9 signaling pathway by curcumin has the potentiality of serving as neuronal regenerative mechanism following SCI.
Cancer is a heavy burden for humans across the world with high morbidity and mortality. Transcription factors including sex determining region Y (SRY)-related high-mobility group (HMG) box (SOX) proteins are thought to be involved in the regulation of specific biological processes. The deregulation of gene expression programs can lead to cancer development. Here, we review the role of the SOX family in breast cancer, prostate cancer, renal cell carcinoma, thyroid cancer, brain tumours, gastrointestinal and lung tumours as well as the entailing therapeutic implications. The SOX family consists of more than 20 members that mediate DNA binding by the HMG domain and have regulatory functions in development, cell-fate decision, and differentiation. SOX2, SOX4, SOX5, SOX8, SOX9, and SOX18 are up-regulated in different cancer types and have been found to be associated with poor prognosis, while the up-regulation of SOX11 and SOX30 appears to be favourable for the outcome in other cancer types. SOX2, SOX4, SOX5 and other SOX members are involved in tumorigenesis, e.g. SOX2 is markedly up-regulated in chemotherapy resistant cells. The SoxF family (SOX7, SOX17, SOX18) plays an important role in angio- and lymphangiogenesis, with SOX18 seemingly being an attractive target for anti-angiogenic therapy and the treatment of metastatic disease in cancer. In summary, SOX transcription factors play an important role in cancer progression, including tumorigenesis, changes in the tumour microenvironment, and metastasis. Certain SOX proteins are potential molecular markers for cancer prognosis and putative potential therapeutic targets, but further investigations are required to understand their physiological functions.
Cardiosphere-derived cells (CDCs) have been shown to reduce infarct size after myocardial infarction (MI). In the present study we investigated the safety and efficacy of global intracoronary administration (GIA) of CDCs or CDC-conditioned medium (CM) immediately after reperfusion in a rat model of ischemia-reperfusion.
CDCs were grown from myocardial biopsies obtained from male Wistar Kyoto rats (WKY). Female WKY rats underwent MI for 45minutes, followed by reperfusion for 1hour. Infarcted rats were randomized to receive GIA of CDCs (CDC group), CM (CM group) or vehicle (control group) immediately after the onset of reperfusion. Cell retention was quantified by PCR for the male specific SRY gene; area at risk (AR) and no reflow area (NR) were measured by histopathology. Cardiac function was evaluated by echocardiography at 1 and 2 months post-MI.
Cell retention at 1hour after GIA was 25.1% ±5.1. The myocardial AR and NR (measured at 1 hour post-reperfusion) were similar between groups [AR: 28.8% ±7.4 of LV mass in control vs 27.2% ±8 in CM vs 27% ±7 in CDCs group. NR: 7.0% ±3.3 in control vs 7.3% ±3.8 in CM vs 7.1% ±3.6 in CDCs]. One and 2 months post-MI, systolic function and LV volumes did not differ between control and CM groups.
Intracoronary administration of CDCs during the acute phase of MI, at the beginning of reperfusion, does not aggravate microvascular obstruction and results in high cell retention. Delivery of CM in the acute phase of MI did not confer long-term cardiac functional benefits.
An 8-month-old female Staffordshire bull terrier was clinically examined because of external sexual organs abnormality-clitoral hypertrophy. As stated by the owner, the female dog had not been in heat yet. Serum profile of testosterone (3.39 ng/ml), as well as an anti-Műllerian hormone (24.0 ng/ml), suggested the presence of testicular tissue. On the contrary, the estimated level of 17β-oestradiol (24.6 pg/ml) was approximately two times higher when compared with the normal anoestrus values (5-10 pg/ml). A midline laparotomy was performed to detect the cranial parts of the genital system. Gonads resembling testicle or ovotestis (left) and hypoplastic testicle (right) was visible. Cranial portion of gonads was attached to structures indicative of bilateral epididymidis. The next tubular structures-oviducts were resected along with adherent parts of a hypoplastic uterus. Histological evaluation confirmed that the examined gonad samples were testicles with modified interstitial testicular tissue. Hypertrophy of interstitial space was predominantly formed by Leydig cells. Examination of a cross-section through the head of suspected epididymidis confirmed their characteristic structures. In addition, the characteristic configuration of the oviducts was presented. The uterus consisted of three walls, in which the endometrium was hypoplastic with the presence of endometrial glands. No Y chromosome was detected by chromosomal analysis using CFA Y probe and the amplification of SRY-gene coding region (813 bp) indicated genotype 78, XX; SRY-negative. Sequencing of SOX9 gene exons 1-3 did not reveal any differences in exon 1 and 3. On the contrary, a few changes were determined in the SOX9 exon 2 sequences: G instead of A at position 103; C instead of reference T at position 115; GCG instead of reference CGC at position 138-140; T instead of reference C at positions 161, 164 and 167.
Increasing evidences have suggested that deregulated miRNAs may involve in drug chemoresistance in a lot of human cancers. However, the role of miR-613 in drug chemoresistance of GC cell is still unknown. The expression of miR-613 and Sex-determining region Y (SRY)-box 9 (SOX9) in GC tissues and cell lines was detected by using qRT-PCR. Cell migration and viability were measured by the wound healing assay and CCK-8 assays. Western blot and dual-luciferase reporter were done to identify the target gene of miR-613. We showed that miR-613 expression was downregulated in GC tissues and cell lines. Ectopic expression of miR-613 increased the sensitivity of GC cells to cisplatin. Overexpression of miR-613 suppressed GC cell proliferation, cycle and migration. In addition, we identified SOX9 was a direct target gene of miR-613 in GC cell. We showed that SOX9 expression was upregulated in gastric cancer samples. Moreover, the expression of SOX9 was negatively correlated with miR-613 expression in GC tissues. Furthermore, elevated expression of miR-613 increased the sensitivity of GC cells to cisplatin and suppressed GC cell proliferation and migration by targeting SOX9. These data suggested that miR-613 might function as a chemoresistant suppressor in GC.
Dioecism has always been an issue in many plant species with its numerous disadvantages, especially in woody trees such as date palms. As one of the most important crops in the Middle Eastern countries, researchers are having problems identifying of sex of the plant in its early stages of development. Hence, proper population stands in the male: female ratio for maintenance is almost impossible in the field for better production. In this study, sex determination of date palm (Phoenix dactilyfera L.) were identified in regions of the Y chromosome (Date-SRY) gene, the pivotal gene that initiates sex determination, using a new technique and thus an economically desirable objective, which will significantly impact profits in seed based cultivations. Partial sequences of the Date-SRY were taken and amplified by nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR). According to the results, the exact sex of date palm was identified in all the tested plants, while amplified regions of the Date-SRY gene closely matched with the human and papaya sequences. In addition, a primer pair was designed to amplify the sequences of the SRY-date gene with confidence that it will identify male date palms. These primer sequences include SRY-date Forward 5'- cggccctctaagtatctgtgcgcaacg-3' (SRY-date F) and the SRY-date Reverse 5'- gtttgcacttcgaagcagag-3' (SRY-date R). The complete sequence of the DNA has been registered and deposited in GenBank (BankIt1598036 DPSRY1 KC577225 thenKJ873056).
Human cells, when exposed to both real and simulated microgravity (s-µg), form 3D tissue constructs mirroring in vivo architectures (e.g., cartilage, intima constructs, cancer spheroids and others). In this study, we exposed human foetal osteoblast (hFOB 1.19) cells to a Random Positioning Machine (RPM) for 7 days and 14 days, with the purpose of investigating the effects of s-µg on biological processes and to engineer 3D bone constructs. RPM exposure of the hFOB 1.19 cells induces alterations in the cytoskeleton, cell adhesion, extra cellular matrix (ECM) and the 3D multicellular spheroid (MCS) formation. In addition, after 7 days, it influences the morphological appearance of these cells, as it forces adherent cells to detach from the surface and assemble into 3D structures. The RPM-exposed hFOB 1.19 cells exhibited a differential gene expression of the following genes: transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGFB1, bone morphogenic protein 2 (BMP2), SRY-Box 9 (SOX9), actin beta (ACTB), beta tubulin (TUBB), vimentin (VIM), laminin subunit alpha 1 (LAMA1), collagen type 1 alpha 1 (COL1A1), phosphoprotein 1 (SPP1) and fibronectin 1 (FN1). RPM exposure also induced a significantly altered release of the cytokines and bone biomarkers sclerostin (SOST), osteocalcin (OC), osteoprotegerin (OPG), osteopontin (OPN), interleukin 1 beta (IL-1β) and tumour necrosis factor 1 alpha (TNF-1α). After the two-week RPM exposure, the spheroids presented a bone-specific morphology. In conclusion, culturing cells in s-µg under gravitational unloading represents a novel technology for tissue-engineering of bone constructs and it can be used for investigating the mechanisms behind spaceflight-related bone loss as well as bone diseases such as osteonecrosis or bone injuries.
Background Ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI) is the most common complication in the mechanical ventilation in clinic. The pathogenesis of VILI has not been well understood. The SRY related High Mobility Group box group-F family member 11(Sox11) is a protein associated with lung development. The focal adhesion kinase(FAK) is a cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase and is regulated by Sox11. The present study, therefore, was undertaken to explore the potential role of Sox11 and FAK in VILI. Methods High volume mechanical ventilation(HMV) was used to establish mouse VILI model under anesthesia. The lung injury was evaluated by analyzing the lung weight, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, histopathological changes and apoptosis of the lung. The Sox11 and FAK expressions in the lung were investigated by real-time qPCR, western blot and immunohistochemistry analysis. Results HMV induced VILI simultaneously companied with decreased expressions of Sox11 and FAK in alveolar epithelial and interstitial cells either in gene and protein levels. Transfection of Sox11 plasmid significantly upregulated expressions of Sox11 and FAK in gene and protein levels in the lung and particularly effectively alleviated VILI. Furthermore, FAK antagonism by PF562271(FAK antagonist) blocked the alleviating effect of Sox11 plasmid transfection on the VILI. Conclusion The dysregulation in the Sox11 and FAK after HMV play an important role in the pathogenesis of VILI, and facilitating the activity of Sox11and FAK might be an effective target and potential option in the prevention and treatment of VILI in clinic.
Microfold (M) cells residing in the follicle-associated epithelium (FAE) of the gut-associated lymphoid tissue are specialized for antigen uptake to initiate mucosal immune responses. The molecular machinery and biological significance of M cell differentiation, however, remain to be fully elucidated. Here, we demonstrate that Sox8, a member of the SRY-related HMG box transcription factor family, is specifically expressed by M cells in the intestinal epithelium. The expression of Sox8 requires activation of RANKL-RelB signaling. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and luciferase assays revealed that Sox8 directly binds the promoter region of Gp2 to increase Gp2 expression, which is the hallmark of functionally mature M cells. Furthermore, genetic deletion of Sox8 causes a marked decrease in the number of mature M cells, resulting in reduced antigen uptake in Peyer's patches. Consequently, juvenile Sox8-deficient mice showed attenuated germinal center reactions and antigen-specific IgA responses. These findings indicate that Sox8 plays an essential role in the development of M cells to establish mucosal immune responses.
The sex-determining region Y (SRY)-box (SOX) family has a crucial role in carcinogenesis and cancer progression. However, the role of SOX12 and the mechanism by which it is dysregulated in colorectal cancer (CRC) remain unclear. Here we analyzed SOX12 expression patterns in two independent CRC cohorts (cohort I, n = 390; cohort II, n = 363) and found that SOX12 was significantly upregulated in CRC, indicating a poor prognosis in CRC patients. Overexpression of SOX12 promoted CRC cell proliferation and metastasis, whereas downregulation of SOX12 hampered CRC aggressiveness. Mechanistically, SOX12 facilitated asparagine synthesis by transactivating glutaminase (GLS), glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase 2 (GOT2), and asparagine synthetase (ASNS). Downregulation of GLS, GOT2, and ASNS blocked SOX12-mediated CRC cell proliferation and metastasis, whereas ectopic expression of GLS, GOT2, and ASNS attenuated the SOX12 knockdown-induced suppression of CRC progression. In addition, serial deletion, site-directed mutagenesis, luciferase reporter, and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays indicated that hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α) directly binds to the SOX12 promoter and induces SOX12 expression. Administration of L-asparaginase decreased SOX12-mediated tumor growth and metastasis. In human CRC samples, SOX12 expression positively correlated with GLS, GOT2, ASNS, and HIF-1α expression. Based on these results, SOX12 may serve as a prognostic biomarker and L-asparaginase represents a potential novel therapeutic agent for CRC.
During embryonic development, neural stem cells (NSCs) emerge as early as the neural plate stage and give rise to the nervous system. Early-stage NSCs express Sry-related-HMG box-1 (Sox1) and are biased towards neuronal differentiation. However, long-term maintenance of early-stage NSCs in vitro remains a challenge. Here, we report development of a defined culture condition for the long-term maintenance of Sox1-positive early-stage mouse NSCs. The proliferative ability of these Sox1-positive NSCs was confirmed by clonal propagation. Compared to the NSCs cultured using the traditional culture condition, the long-term self-renewing Sox1-positive NSCs efficiently differentiate into neurons and exhibit an identity representative of the anterior and midbrain regions. These early-stage Sox1-positive NSCs could also be switched to late-stage NSCs by being cultured with bFGF/EGF, which can then differentiate into astrocytes and oligodendrocytes. The long-term self-renewing Sox1-positive NSCs were defined as naïve NSCs, based on their high neuronal differentiation capacity and anterior regional identity. This culture condition provides a robust platform for further dissection of the NSC self-renewal mechanism and promotes potential applications of NSCs for cell-based therapy on nervous system disorders.
Embryonic Sertoli cells (eSCs) play an important role in sex determination and in male gonad development which makes them a very useful cell type for therapeutic applications. However, the deriving mechanism of Sertoli cells has been unclear and challenging to create a large number of quality eSCs. Therefore, this study aimed to create the eSCs induced from mouse embryonic stem (mES) cells by regulating defined factors and to explore the relevant regulatory mechanism.
Six inducing factors, Sry, Sox9, SF1, WT1, GATA4, and Dmrt1, were respectively transduced into mES cells by lentiviral infection according to the experimental design. The test groups were identified by development stage-specific markers, AMH, Emx2, SF1, and FasL, using flow cytometry. Induced eSCs were determined by FasL and AMH biomarkers under immunofluorescence, immunocytochemistry, and flow cytometry. Moreover, the pluripotency markers, gonad development-related markers, epithelial markers and mesenchymal markers in test groups were transcriptionally determined by qPCR.
In this study, the co-overexpression of all the six factors effectively produced a large population of eSCs from mES cells in 35 days of culturing. These eSCs were capable of forming tubular-like and ring-like structures with functional performance. The results of flow cytometry indicated that the upregulation of GATA4 and WT1 contributed to the growth of somatic cells in the coelomic epithelium regarded as the main progenitor cells of eSCs. Whereas, SF1 facilitated the development of eSC precursor cells, and Sry and Sox9 promoted the determination of male development. Moreover, the overexpression of Dmrt1 was essential for the maintenance of eSCs and some of their specific surface biomarkers such as FasL. The cellular morphology, biomarker identification, and transcriptomic analysis aided in exploring the regulatory mechanism of deriving eSCs from mES cells.
Conclusively, we have elucidated a differentiation roadmap of eSCs derived from mES cells with a relevant regulatory mechanism. Through co-overexpression of all these six factors, a large population of eSCs was successfully induced occupying 24% of the whole cell population (1 × 105 cells/cm2). By adopting this approach, a mass of embryonic Sertoli cells can be generated for the purpose of co-culture technique, organ transplantation, gonadal developmental and sex determination researches.
Thoracic endometriosis (TE) syndrome is a clinical condition known as an extrapelvic form of endometriosis with the presence of functioning endometrial tissue involving lung parenchyma, pleura, chest wall, or diaphragm. In an effort to obtain an endometriosis ex vivo model, we established the spontaneously growing TH-EM1 cell line from endometriotic implants in lung parenchyma from a woman with TE. Maintained in long-term culture, the cells grew as large mesenchymal-like cells with a doubling time between 5 and 6 days. Treatment with medroxyprogesterone acetate (10-7 mol/L) inhibited the TH-EM1 cells growth and induced morphological changes to an epithelial-like cells. Strong expression of the nuclear estrogen receptors, progesterone receptors, and erytropoietin receptors were found in both the pulmonary implant and the TH-EM1 cells by immunohistochemical analysis. Consistent immunoreactivity of TH-EM1 cells for CD9, CD13, CD73, CD90, CD105, and CD157 was revealed by flow cytometry. Likewise, the embryonic markers, SRY-box 2 (SOX-2) and the Nanog molecules, were detected in 76% and 52% of the cells, while fetal hemoglobin and α-globin were detected in 76% and 65% of TH-EM1 cells, respectively. By RHG banding, normal metaphases were observed, while the microarray chromosomal analysis showed gains of DNA sequences located on the segments 8p23.1, 11p15.5, and 12p11.23. The described in vitro cellular model can serve as a useful tool to study the pathogenesis of endometriosis and to improve the knowledge of molecular mechanisms controlling the endometriotic cell dissemination potential.
This research aimed to reveal the relationship of SRY-type HMG box 9 (SOX9) gene polymorphisms with osteoarthritis (OA) risk in a Chinese population.Polymerase chain reaction and direct sequencing were used for genotyping polymorphism in 152 OA patients and 139 controls. Firstly, the conformity of genotype distribution to Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in the control group was checked. The differences in genotype and allele frequencies of our studied polymorphism were compared between the two groups using chi-square test. Odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (95%CI) was used to appraise the strength of the relationship between the polymorphism and OA occurrence. Cross-over analysis was conducted to reveal the interaction between polymorphisms in SOX9.The AA genotype of the polymorphism rs1042667 was significantly correlated to the increased susceptibility to OA (OR = 2.075, 95%CI = 1.042-4.132). We also detected that the A allele of the polymorphism rs1042667 also obviously increased the occurrence of OA in our study (OR = 1.401, 95%CI = 1.009-1.945). Moreover, the G allele of the polymorphism rs12601701 and the A allele of the polymorphism rs1042667 could significantly elevate the risk of OA (OR = 2.075, 95%CI = 1.021-4.218).SOX9 polymorphism rs1042667 may be a risk factor for OA in Chinese Han population. The interaction between the polymorphisms rs1042667 and rs12601701 also contribute to OA risk.
Rationale: SOX10 (SRY-related HMG-box 10) and MITF-M (microphthalmia-associated transcription factor M) restrict the expression of melanogenic genes, such as TYR (tyrosinase), in melanocytes. DACE (diacetylcaffeic acid cyclohexyl ester) inhibits melanin production in α-MSH (α-melanocyte stimulating hormone)-activated B16-F0 melanoma cells. In this study, we evaluated the antimelanogenic activity of DACE in vivo and elucidated the molecular basis of its action. Methods: We employed melanocyte cultures and hyperpigmented skin samples for pigmentation assays, and applied chromatin immunoprecipitation, immunoblotting, RT-PCR or siRNA-based knockdown for mechanistic analyses. Results: Topical treatment with DACE mitigated UV-B-induced hyperpigmentation in the skin with attenuated expression of MITF-M and TYR. DACE also inhibited melanin production in α-MSH- or ET-1 (endothelin 1)-activated melanocyte cultures. As a mechanism, DACE blocked the nuclear import of CRTC1 (CREB-regulated co-activator 1) in melanocytes. DACE resultantly inhibited SOX10 induction, and suppressed the transcriptional abilities of CREB/CRTC1 heterodimer and SOX10 at MITF-M promoter, thereby ameliorating facultative melanogenesis. Furthermore, this study unveiled new issues in melanocyte biology that i) KPNA1 (Impα5) escorted CRTC1 as a cargo across the nuclear envelope, ii) SOX10 was inducible in the melanogenic process, and iii) CRTC1 could direct SOX10 induction at the transcription level. Conclusion: We propose the targeting of CRTC1 as a unique strategy in the treatment of acquired pigmentary disorders.
The aim of this study was to explore why in rabbits activation of farnesoid X receptor (FXR) is dominant over activated liver X receptor-alpha (LXRalpha) in the regulation of CYP7A1. We cloned the rabbit CYP7A1 promoter and found a fetoprotein transcription factor (FTF) binding element embedded within the LXRalpha binding site (LXRE). Gel shift assays demonstrated that FTF competes with LXRalpha for binding to LXRE. Short heterodimer partner (SHP) enhances the competitive ability of FTF. Studies in HepG2 cells showed that SHP combined with FTF had more powerful effect to offset the stimulation of CYP7A1 by LXRalpha. Gel shift and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated that SHP with FTF diminished LXRalpha binding to the CYP7A1 promoter. In vivo studies in rabbits fed cholesterol for 10 days showed that hepatic expression of SHP but not FTF rose and LXRalpha-bound LXRE decreased. We propose that the SHP/FTF heterodimer occupies LXRE via the embedded FTF binding element and blocks LXRalpha from recruiting to LXRE. Therefore, activation of FXR, which upregulates SHP expression, will eliminate the stimulatory effect of LXRalpha on the CYP7A1 promoter because increased levels of SHP combined with FTF diminish the recruitment of LXRalpha to CYP7A1 promoter.
The transcription of the cholesterol 7alpha-hydroxylase gene (CYP7A1) is greatly decreased in cholesterol-fed rabbits. To determine whether the molecular structure of the promoter is responsible for this downregulation, we cloned the rabbit CYP7A1 promoter, identified the binding sites for alpha-fetoprotein transcription factor (FTF) and liver X receptor (LXRalpha), and studied the effects of FTF, LXRalpha, and SHP on its transcription. Adding LXRalpha/retinoid X receptor together with their ligands (L/R) to the promoter/reporter construct transfected into HepG2 cells greatly increased its activity. FTF did not increase promoter activity, nor did it enhance the stimulatory effect of L/R. Mutating the FTF binding site abolished the promoter baseline activity. Increasing amounts of SHP abolished the effect of L/R, and FTF enhanced the ability of SHP to decrease promoter activity below baseline levels. Thus, downregulation of CYP7A1 in cholesterol-fed rabbits is attributable secondarily to the activation of farnesoid X receptor, which increases SHP expression to override the positive effects of LXRalpha. Although FTF is a competent factor for maintaining baseline activity, it does not further enhance and may suppress CYP7A1 transcription.
Our previous study using interleukin-1α/β-knockout (IL-1-KO) and wild-type (WT) mice demonstrated that IL-1 acts as a positive factor for constitutive gene expression of hepatic cytochrome P4507a1 (Cyp7a1). In this study, to clarify the role of IL-1 in the expression of the hepatic Cyp7a1 gene, we focused on Cyp7a1 transcriptional regulators such as α-fetoprotein transcription factor (FTF), liver X receptor α (LXRα), hepatocyte nuclear factor 4α (HNF4α) and small heterodimer partner (SHP) and examined the effects of IL-1 on their gene expression by real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction using IL-1-KO and WT mice. We observed no significant differences between sex-matched IL-1-KO and WT mice with regard to gene expression levels of FTF, LXRα, and HNF4α, all of which are positive transcriptional regulators for the Cyp7a1 gene. However, interindividual differences in hepatic FTF and LXRα expression were closely dependent on the gene expression level(s) of hepatic IL-1 and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), while interindividual differences in hepatic HNF4α were clearly correlated with the expression of IL-1, but not TNF-α. In contrast, the gene expression level of SHP, which is a negative transcriptional regulator of the Cyp7a1 gene through inhibition of FTF function, was higher in IL-1-KO mice than in sex-matched WT mice. These findings demonstrate that, like TNF-α, IL-1 positively controls the gene expression of Cyp7a1 transcriptional upregulators but, in contrast to the previously reported action of TNF-α, IL-1 also acts to downregulate SHP gene expression.
The acute phase response (APR) classically refers to the rapid reprogramming of gene expression and metabolism in response to inflammatory cytokine signaling. As components of the innate immune system, hepatocyte-derived acute phase proteins (APPs) play a central role in restoring tissue homeostasis. Recently, an intriguing 'metaflammatory' facet of the APR became evident with chronically elevated APP levels being connected to metabolic syndrome disorders. The causality of these connections is unclear but could relate to adverse metabolic and inflammatory disturbances, particularly those affecting lipoprotein properties, cholesterol metabolism and atherogenesis. Here we review these aspects with an emphasis on the emerging importance of lipid-sensing nuclear receptors (LXRs, LRH-1, PPARs), in conjunction with anti-inflammatory transrepression pathways, as physiological and pharmacological relevant modulators of the APR.
The human neurotropic virus JCV contains a 98-base pair repeat enhancer/promoter sequence that confers glial-specific transcription to the viral early and late promoters. The central region of this repeat, designated the B-domain, binds to a glial-derived nuclear protein that stimulates transcription of the viral promotor in vitro. We now report the isolation of a recombinant cDNA clone, termed glial factor-1 (GF1), from a brain expression library that encodes a novel protein which interacts with the JCV B-domain. Results from RNA studies indicate that the GF1 transcript is more abundant in brain than in other tissues and that the level of GF1 RNAs increases progressively during brain development. Cotransfection of the recombinant GF1 expressor plasmid with JCV promoters indicates that GF1 stimulates transcription of the JCV late promoter and to a lesser extent the JCV early promoter predominantly in cells of human glial origin. Thus, GF1 is a sequence-specific DNA binding protein that may play a role in determining the glial-specific expression of JCV.
Two procedures were used to isolate hepatocytic Golgi fractions from rat liver. One procedure yields a light Golgi fraction (GF1 + 2) and the other "intact" stacks of cisternae. Triglyceride fatty acids in nascent very low density lipoproteins (VLDL) were labeled by injection of [3H]palmitate intravenously, and radiolabeled lipoproteins were injected as markers of potentially contaminating endosomes. GF1 + 2 fractions were enriched manyfold in the endosomal markers, indicative of substantial endosomal contamination, whereas intact Golgi fractions from the same livers were about 7% as contaminated. By electron microscopy, GF1 + 2 fractions contained mainly multivesicular bodies (MVBs), together with some Golgi-derived secretory vesicles. The small endosomal contamination of intact Golgi fractions was further reduced by a simple modification of the procedure, which removed most entrained endosomes. The surface constituents of Golgi VLDL (d less than 1.010 g/ml) released from these highly purified intact Golgi fractions differed from those of plasma VLDL. Golgi VLDL contained fivefold less unesterified cholesterol than plasma VLDL, but twofold more phospholipids. Golgi VLDL and plasma VLDL contained similar amounts of cholesteryl esters and triglycerides. The protein content of Golgi VLDL was substantially lower than that of plasma VLDL. ApoB-100 and apoB-48 were similarly represented, but nascent VLDL contained less of the C apolipoproteins. ApoA-I was present mainly as the proprotein in Golgi VLDL, but was virtually lacking in plasma VLDL. ApoE comprised about 22% of the protein mass of Golgi VLDL as well as plasma VLDL; the distribution of apoE isoforms was also similar. Apolipoproteins E and pro A-I released from ruptured Golgi cisternae were largely bound to the Golgi VLDL or were associated with Golgi membranes. Particles resembling low density lipoproteins (LDL) and high density lipoproteins (HDL) were not seen by electron microscopy in contents of intact Golgi fractions. These observations indicate that nascent Golgi VLDL are the primary particulate precursors of rat plasma lipoproteins of hepatocytic origin, and suggest that particles with the density of plasma HDL and LDL do not exist within the secretory pathway of normal hepatocytes. Thus, the results of this research on the properties of nascent plasma lipoprotein precursors contained within uncontaminated hepatocytic Golgi fractions differ substantially from previous published work.
The X-linked NFE1 gene encodes an erythroid factor involved in globin gene transcription. Using a human cDNA clone encoding this factor, we show, by in situ hybridization and by analysis of human-rodent hybrid cell lines, that this gene is located in Xp11.23. In the absence of polymorphisms in the NFE1 gene, these results allow the study of the possible relationships between NFE1 mutations and X-linked hereditary persistence of fetal hemoglobin by linkage analysis with RFLP markers of the region. A female patient, hemizygous for the NFE1 locus, shows essentially normal hematological parameters.
The water-soluble polysaccharides from dried Ginkgo biloba leaves were isolated after exhaustive extraction with organic solvents. The polysaccharide mixture could be separated into a neutral (GF1) and two acidic (GF2 and GF3) polysaccharide fractions by ion exchange chromatography. According to the Mr distribution GF1 and GF3 seemed to be homogenous, whereas GF2 could be further fractionated into two subfractions (GF2a and GF2b) by gel permeation chromatography. GF1 (Mr 23,000) showed the structural features of a branched arabinan. The main chain was composed of 1,5-linked arabinose residues and three in 12 arabinose molecules were branched via C-2 or C-3. GF2a (Mr 500,000) consisted mainly of 1,2,4-branched mannose (29%), 1,4-linked glucuronic (32%) and galacturonic (8%) acid as well as terminal rhamnose (25%). After removal of ca 70% of the terminal rhamnose the remaining polysaccharide showed a decrease in 1,2,4-branched mannose and an increase in 1,2-linked mannose indicating that at least half of the rhamnose residues were linked to mannose via C-4. GF3 (Mr 40,000) consisted of 1,4-linked galacturonic (30%) and glucuronic (16) acid, 1,3,6-branched galactose (15%), 1,2-linked (5%) and 1,2,4-branched (3.5%) rhamnose as well as 1,5-linked arabinose (11%). Rhamnose (5%) and arabinose (10%) were present as terminal groups. Mild acid hydrolysis selectively cleaved arabinose and the remaining polysaccharide showed an increased amount of 1,6-linked and terminal galactose and a decreased quantity of 1,3,6-branched galactose. These results indicated that the terminal as well as the 1,5-linked arabinose were mainly connected to galactose via C-3. The GF3 polysaccharide appeared to be a rhamnogalacturonan with arabinogalactan side chains.
We have identified a consensus operator sequence, YYYATTGTTCTC, which mediates the repression imposed by the ROX1 factor upon the members of the hypoxic gene regulon, which includes ANB1, HEM13, COX5b, and CYC7. The members of the regulon were repressed with widely varying stringency, and the variation was correlated with the number and fidelity of operator sequences observed. ANB1 had two operators operating with unequal efficiency, each containing two copies of the operator sequence. Synthetic operator sequences introduced into an operator deletion were effective as monomers but much more so as dimers, consistent with cooperativity. The native operators both imposed ROX1 repression on the GAL1 gene, in either orientation, but the synthetic operators did not, indicating that the sequence context may be important. The repression and activation of ANB1 are independent spatially and functionally, since deletion of the operators did not reduce expression and since both the operator and activation regions functioned separately in the GAL1 UAS. The ANB1 UAS was constitutive, containing several elements distributed over a 300-bp region. There were two dT-rich segments, one of 51 bp and one of 165 bp, the latter capable of activating transcription by itself. Flanking segments containing GRF2 (REB1) and ABF1 (GF1) sites may contribute to activation but were not essential. The UAS showed a strongly preferred orientation.
The biosynthesis, processing, and intracellular transport of lysosomal acid phosphatase was studied using an in vitro cell-free translation system, pulse-chase experiments with primary cultured rat hepatocytes and subcellular fractionation techniques of rat liver after pulse-labeling with [35S]methionine in vivo. The single polypeptide of 45 kDa translated in the cell-free system from membrane-bound polysomal RNAs was converted to the 64 kDa form when the translation was carried out in the presence of microsomal vesicles. Pulse-chase experiments using cultured rat hepatocytes showed that acid phosphatase is initially synthesized as an endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase H (Endo H)-sensitive form of 64 kDa, and processed via an Endo H-sensitive intermediate form of 62 kDa to an Endo H-resistant form with a 67 kDa mass. Phase separation with Triton X-114 showed that both the 64 and 67 kDa forms have hydrophobic properties. Treatment of the cells with chloroquine or tunicamycin, drugs which enhance the secretion of lysosomal hydrolases, had no effect on the normal transport of acid phosphatase to lysosomes. Acid phosphatase did not contain the phosphorylated high mannose type of oligosaccharide chains observed in cathepsin D. Subcellular fractionation experiments in conjunction with pulse-labeling in vivo showed that the acid phosphatase of the 67 kDa form was present in the Golgi heavy fraction (GF3) and the Golgi light fraction (GF1+2) enriched in cis and trans Golgi elements, respectively, at 30 min after the administration of [35S]methionine. Simultaneously, this polypeptide was also found in the lysosomal membrane fraction, thereby indicating that acid phosphatase is delivered to lysosomes in a membrane-bound form, immediately after reaching the trans-Golgi region.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
Four DNase I hypersensitive sites characterize the human beta-globin Dominant Control Region (DCR) providing position independent, high levels of erythroid specific expression to linked homologous and heterologous genes when introduced into cultured cells or in transgenic mice. We have delineated the hypersensitive site located 10.5 kbp upstream of the epsilon-globin gene by short range DNase I sensitivity mapping to a 600 bp region. Using transgenic mice and MEL cells the functional part of this region was further mapped to a 300 bp central core, which provides position independent, high level expression. It contains a number of ubiquitous and erythroid specific protein binding sites, including the previously described factors NF-E1 (GF1) and NF-E2. The latter binds to a dimer of the consensus binding sequence for jun/fos. The presence of this sequence is required for the function of the element, but single or multimerized copies of this site failed to give position independent, high levels of expression in transgenic mice or MEL cells. We therefore conclude that a combination of factor binding sites is necessary to allow site 3 to function as a strong transcriptional activator, resulting in position independent expression of the beta-globin gene.
We describe the characterisation of cis-acting sequences which control the tissue specific expression of the human zeta globin gene. An extensive search for enhancer sequences in the vicinity of this gene proved negative. Instead our data demonstrate that the minimal promoter of the zeta gene is itself tissue specific. Sequences close to and possibly including the -100 CACCC and -70 CCAAT boxes display some erythroid specificity. However the principal tissue specific element is a GATAA sequence at -120 directly adjacent to the minimal promoter. Specific deletion of GATAA reduces zeta promoter activity 5 fold in erythroid but not non-erythroid cells. We also demonstrate that an erythroid specific factor binds to this GATAA sequence. Furthermore this factor forms a complex with the transcription factor CP1 which we show interacts with the zeta CCAAT box. We present evidence that the zeta GATAA binding factor is equivalent to GF1 recently purified and cloned by Tsai et al [1]. The erythroid specific GATAA sequence has been found in the promoters and enhancers of a number of erythroid specific genes. Similarly we show here that the zeta globin gene relies on a GATAA sequence in its promoter to specify its expression in erythroid cells.
Involvement of endosomes in transport of newly synthesized acid phosphatase to lysosomes was investigated using the Golgi fraction (GF1 + 2), enriched in endosomes. The Golgi fraction (GF1 + 2) was prepared from the livers of rats given [35S]methionine and asialofetuin conjugated-horseradish peroxidase (HRP). Newly synthesized acid phosphatase in the endosomes containing internalized asialofetuin-HRP was measured as a loss of the detectable labeled enzyme after 3,3'-diaminobenzidine (DAB) and H2O2 reaction, due to formation of insoluble polymers which reduce protein antigenicity. With this procedure, acid phosphatase was all but undetectable in the Golgi fraction. Thus, newly synthesized acid phosphatase is apparently transported to lysosomes by endosomes.
Most of the yeast artificial chromosomes (YACs) isolated from the Xp11.23-22 region have shown instability and chimerism and are not a reliable resource for determining physical distances. We therefore constructed a long-range pulsed-field gel electrophoresis map that encompasses approximately 3.5 Mb of genomic DNA between the loci TIMP and DXS146 including a CpG-rich region around the WASP and TFE-3 gene loci. A combined YAC-cosmid contig was constructed along the genomic map and was used for fine-mapping of 15 polymorphic microsatellites and 30 expressed sequence tags (ESTs) or sequence transcribed sites (STSs), revealing the following order: tel-(SYN-TIMP)-(DXS426-ELK1)-ZNF(CA) n-L1-DXS1367-ZNF81-ZNF21-DXS6616- (HB3-OATL1pseudogenes-DXS6950)-DXS6949-DXS694 1-DXS7464E(MG61)-GW1E(EBP)- DXS7927E(MG81)-RBM- DXS722-DXS7467E(MG21)-DXS1011E-WASP-DXS6940++ +-DXS7466E(MG44)-GF1- DXS226-DXS1126-DXS1240-HB1- DXS7469E-(DXS6665-DXS1470)-TFE3-DXS7468E-+ ++SYP-DXS1208-HB2E-DXS573-DXS1331- DXS6666-DXS1039-DXS 1426-DXS1416-DXS7647-DXS8222-DXS6850-DXS255++ +-CIC-5-DXS146-cen. A sequence-ready map was constructed for an 1100-kb gene-rich interval flanked by the markers HB3 and DXS1039, from which six novel ESTs/STSs were isolated, thus increasing the number of markers used in this interval to thirty. This precise ordering is a prerequisite for the construction of a transcription map of this region that contains numerous disease loci, including those for several forms of retinal degeneration and mental retardation. In addition, the map provides the base to delineate the corresponding syntenic region in the mouse, where the mutants scurfy and tattered are localized.
An effective methodology to isolate and characterize the Golgi complex of Tritrichomonas foetus is described in this work. Using sucrose density gradient centrifugation, two highly enriched Golgi fractions (GF1 and GF2) were obtained. Enzymatic assays of GF1 and GF2 showed a strong enrichment in galactosyltransferase activity (20- and 7-fold, respectively), with minimal contamination with other organelles. The GF fraction was further subfractionated by alkaline treatment, which resulted in the production of Golgi content and membrane subfractions. Electron microscopic observations of intact cells or Golgi fractions fixed in solutions containing glutaraldehyde and tannic acid, as well as of deep-etched replicas of isolated fractions, revealed the presence of discrete bridges only between closely apposed cisternae.
Propionic acid (ammonium salt) at 3000 mg/kg (PA1) and 5000 mg/kg (PA2) of unshelled peanuts (UP); grapefruit seed extract at 5000 mg/kg (GF1) and 10,000 mg/kg (GF2); sodium orthophenylphenate at 2500 mg/kg (SOP1) and 5000 mg/kg (SOP2); thiabendazole 1000 mg/kg (TBZ1) and 5000 mg/kg (TBZ2) were studied in the laboratory, to verify their efficiency in controlling fungal growth and aflatoxin (AF) production on moist UP (16-18% moisture content). Moist UP were put into polyethylene bags with cotton plugs and incubated at 30 +/- 2 degrees C for 28 days. Treatments were considered efficient when the AF content (B1 + G1) remained under 30 micrograms/kg. PA1 treatment was efficient till 14 days of incubation and PA2 during the whole incubation period (28 days). All other treatments were not efficient, showing AF contents from 150 to 108,333 micrograms/kg during the incubation periods. Propionic acid, used as ammonium propionate, at 5000 mg/kg shows promise in controlling aflatoxin production when applied to moist unshelled peanuts.
In the present work, the effect of propionic acid (ammonium salt) at 3000 mg/kg of unshelled peanuts (PA1) and at 5000 mg/kg (PA2), grapefruit seed extract at 5000 mg/kg (GF1) and 10,000 mg/kg (GF2), sodium orthophenylphenate at 2500 mg/kg (SOP1) and at 5000 mg/kg (SOP2) and thiabendazole at 1000 mg/kg (TBZ1) and at 5000 mg/kg (TBZ2) was studied for controlling total and potentially aflatoxigenic fungi in unshelled peanuts (UP). Samples of sound mature UP were moistened by adding water and kept refrigerated till they reached ca 16% moisture. The samples were then sprayed with the chemical solutions and incubated at 30 +/- 2 degrees C for 28 days. Control samples were sprayed with water. An evaluation of total and aflatoxigenic fungi was made, in pods of UP and in kernels obtained aseptically, before and at 7, 14, 21 and 28 days of incubation, by serial dilution in culture media Dichloran Rose Bengal Chloramphenicol (total fungi count) and in Aspergillus flavus parasiticus Agar (potentially aflatoxigenic count). In relation to the period and conditions of this experiment the overall best treatment was PA2, when the lowest average value of total and aflatoxigenic fungi were obtained in UP and were maintained in its kernels. Although SOP2 treatment could control fungal contamination in pods, it was not effective in controlling contamination through the kernels. The other treatments were ineffective.
The Gfi1 gene encodes a zinc finger protein which binds DNA and is involved in transcriptional regulation. Gfi1 was assigned to the central portion of mouse Chr 5 by interspecific backcross mapping and to human chromosome band 1p22 and rat chromosome band 14p22 by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Comparative mapping data presented here describes a new syntenic region between man and rodents.
This study aims to verify the changes occurring in factors such as interleukin alfa-1 (IL1-alpha) and growth factor (GF1) during surgical menopause, with or without hormone replacement therapy. Forty patients, who underwent hysterectomy, entered this perspective and longitudinal study: in ten out of these forty patients the ovaries were preserved. The remaining thirty patients, whose ovaries were removed, were randomly given either estrogen or estro-progestin therapy or no therapy at all. The IL1-alpha and IGF1 levels, taken a year before, were compared with the levels obtained prior to surgery. No changes in IGF1 levels were observed in women who underwent oophorectomy without further treatment and in those women whose ovaries were preserved. A non significant reduction of IGF1 levels was observed in women treated with estrogens. A significant reduction (p &lt; 0.007) was observed, instead, when estro-progestin administration was employed. No changes of IL1-alpha levels were observed when the ovaries were preserved. This monokyne significantly increased in women who underwent oophorectomy and were not treated. Treatment with estrogens or estro-progestin caused a significant reduction of the IL1-alpha levels (p &lt; 0.0005) (p &lt; 0.0009). These data strongly suggested that chronic or acute estrogenic deprivation does not play a significant role on the circulating IGF1 levels and, consequently, also on GH levels. This significant decrease in IGF1 levels with the addition of EP, in association with an increase of osteocalcin, suggested an active role of osteoblasts during administration. The increase of interleukin 1-alpha, after oophorectomy, was considered to play an important role in menopause osteoporosis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
The domain of thrombomodulin that binds to the anion-binding exosite of thrombin was identified by comparing the binding of fragments of thrombomodulin to thrombin with that of Hirugen, a 12-residue peptide of hirudin that is known to bind to the anion-binding exosite of thrombin. Three soluble fragments of thrombomodulin, containing (i) the six repeated growth factor-like domains of thrombomodulin (GF1-6), (ii) one-half of the second through the sixth growth factor-like repeats (GF2.5-6), or (iii) the fifth and sixth such domains (GF5-6), were examined. Hirugen was a competitive inhibitor for either GF1-6 or GF2.5-6 stimulation of thrombin activation of protein C. GF5-6, which binds to thrombin without altering its ability to activate protein C, competed with fluorescein-labeled Hirugen for binding to thrombin. Therefore, all three thrombomodulin fragments, each of which lacked the chondroitin sulfate moiety, competed with Hirugen for binding to thrombin. To determine whether GF5-6 and Hirugen were binding to overlapping sites on thrombin or were interfering allosterically with each other's binding to thrombin, the effects of each thrombomodulin fragment and of Hirugen on the active site conformation of thrombin were compared using two different approaches: fluorescence-detected changes in the structure of the active site and the hydrolysis of chromogenic substrates. The GF5-6 and Hirugen peptides affected these measures of active site conformation very similarly, and hence GF5-6 and Hirugen contact residues on the surface of thrombin that allosterically alter the active site structure to a similar extent. Full-length thrombomodulin and GF1-6 alter the active site structure to comparable extents, but the amidolytic activity of thrombin complexed to thrombomodulin or GF1-6 differs significantly from that of thrombin complexed to GF5-6 or Hirugen. Taken together, these results indicate that the GF5-6 domain of thrombomodulin binds to the anion-binding exosite of thrombin. Furthermore, the binding of GF5-6 to the anion-binding exosite alters thrombin specificity, as evidenced by GF5-6-dependent changes in both the kcat and Km of synthetic substrate hydrolysis by thrombin. The contact sites on thrombin for the GF4 domain and the chondroitin sulfate moiety of thrombomodulin are still unknown.
The association of thrombin with thrombomodulin, a non-enzymatic endothelial cell surface receptor, alters the substrate specificity of thrombin. Complex formation converts thrombin from a procoagulant to an anticoagulant enzyme. Structure-function analysis of this change in specificity is facilitated by the availability of two soluble proteolytic derivatives of thrombomodulin, one consisting of the six repeated growth factor-like domains of thrombomodulin (GF1-6) and the other containing only the fifth and sixth such domains (GF5-6). Both derivatives can bind to thrombin and block fibrinogen clotting activity, though only the larger GF1-6 can stimulate the activation of protein C. To ascertain whether the substrate specificity change from fibrinogen to protein C is accompanied by structural changes in the active site of the enzyme, fluorescent dyes were positioned at different locations within the active site. A 5-dimethylaminonaphthalene-1-sulfonyl (dansyl) dye was covalently attached to the active site serine to form dansyl-thrombin, while either a fluorescein or an anilinonaphthalene-6-sulfonic acid (ANS) dye was attached covalently to the active site histidine of thrombin via a D-Phe-Pro-Arg linkage. The environment of the dansyl dye was altered in a similar fashion when either GF1-6 or GF5-6 bound to thrombin, since a similar reduction in dansyl emission intensity was elicited by these two thrombomodulin derivatives (25 and 32%, respectively). These spectral changes, and all others in this study, were saturable and reached a maximum when the ratio of thrombomodulin derivative to thrombin was close to 1. The environments of the fluorescein and ANS dyes were also altered when GF1-6 bound to thrombin because binding resulted in emission intensity changes of -13% and +18%, respectively. In contrast, no fluorescence changes were observed when the fluorescein and ANS thrombin derivatives were titrated with GF5-6. Thus, the structure of the active site was altered by thrombomodulin both immediately adjacent to the active site serine and also more than 15 A away from it. However, the structural change far from Ser-195 was only elicited by thrombomodulin species that stimulate thrombin-dependent activation of protein C.
Glycosylation of transferrin was investigated in vivo by using antibody monospecific for rat serum transferrin. Pulse-chase experiments indicated that, after intravenous injection of [35S]methionine, labeled transferrin appeared in the rough and smooth microsomes and Golgi subfractions in rapid succession in 10 min and that an additional 10 min was required for it to be secreted. Most of the intracellular transferrin (95%) immunoprecipitated from the total microsome fraction was sensitive to endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase H (endo H), whereas serum transferrin was completely resistant to it. Further fractionation of the total microsomes has revealed that the intracellular transferrin immunoprecipitated from the rough and smooth microsomes and GF3 are all endo-H-sensitive and most of the endo-H-sensitive oligosaccharides were eluted at the position corresponding to Man8GlcNAc on high-resolution Bio-Gel chromatography. This finding suggests that the major form of intracellular transferrin oligosaccharide in the course of intracellular transport from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi apparatus is Man8GlcNAc2. Endo-H-resistant forms were first detected in the GF2 but more in GF1, most of which were sensitive to neuraminidase. Since the heavy Golgi subfraction contains mainly cis-Golgi elements, such as cisternae, and the light subfraction mainly trans-Golgi elements, such as secretory granules, it is strongly suggested that the processing of these large mannosyloligosaccharide chains and the subsequent addition of terminal sugars to them are performed successively in the trans-Golgi region just before secretion.
The distribution of multiple forms of galactosyltransferase (EC 2.4.1.22) and sialyltransferase (EC 2.4.99.1) from the microsomes and Golgi complex membrane fractions of rat liver was investigated. Three fractions of Golgi membranes, namely GF1, GF2, and GF3, differing in their morphology and marker enzyme activity, were obtained. A simultaneous increase of glycosyltransferases under study was observed in fractions GF3 less than GF2 less than GF1. Using isoelectrofocusing, the presence of at least 6-8 forms of galactosyl- and sialyltransferases in the microsomes and Golgi fraction was revealed. The distribution patterns of multiple forms along the pH gradient for each membrane fraction were found to be identical. However, the ratios of highly active and low active forms were specific for each fraction. The similarity of multiple form spectra for galactosyl-and sialyltransferase suggest their tight functional interaction and a possible "en block" packing of membrane glycosyltransferases.
NADH-cytochrome b5 reductases of rat liver microsomes, mitochondria, and heavy and light Golgi fractions (GF3 and GF 1+2) were compared by antibody inhibition and competition experiments, by peptide mapping, and by CNBr fragment analysis. The water-soluble portion of the microsomal enzyme, released by lysosomal digestion and purified by a published procedure, was used to raise antibodies in rabbits. Contaminant antimicrosome antibodies were removed from immune sera by immunoadsorption onto the purified antigen, and the F(ab')2 fragments of the pure antireductase antibody thus obtained were found to inhibit the NADH-cytochrome c reductase activity equally well in the four membrane fractions investigated, with similar dose-response relationships. Moreover, the purified water-soluble fragment of microsomal reductase, which by itself is very inefficient in reducing cytochrome c, competed for antibody binding with the membrane-bound enzymes, and therefore prevented the inhibition of their activity not only in microsomes but also in the other fractions. The reductases isolated from detergent-solubilized microsomes, mitochondria, GF3, and GF1+2 by immunoadsorption had identical mobilities in SDS polyacrylamide gels. The corresponding bands were eluted from gels, fragmented with pepsin or CNBr treatment, and the two families of peptides thus obtained were analyzed by two-dimensional mapping and SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, respectively. Both analyses failed to reveal differences among reductases of the four fractions. These findings support the hypothesis that NADH-cytochrome b5 reductase in its various subcellular locations is molecularly identical.
The subcellular distribution of NADH-cytochrome b5 reductase in rat liver cells was reinvestigated. In fresh heavy and light Golgi fractions (GF3 and GF1 + 2) and in mitochondria, the specific activity of rotenone-insensitive NADH-cytochrome c reductase was approximately 100, 60, and 30%, respectively, of the value found in microsomes. However, the Golgi enzyme was unstable inasmuch as pelleting and resuspending the fresh fractions resulted in a considerable inactivation (40--60%), which was further increased with subsequent storage at 4 degrees C. A similar inactivation was observed using cytochrome b5 but not ferricyanide as electron acceptor. The inactivation of Golgi NADH-cytochrome c reductase activity was independent of the protein concentration of the fractions during storage, was unaffected by the addition of the antioxidant butylated hydroxytoluene, but was partly prevented by buffering the fractions at neutral pH and by storage at--20 degrees C. A total Golgi fraction was analyzed by density equilibration on continuous sucrose gradients after exposure to digitonin. As expected, the distribution of both protein and galactosyl transferase were shifted to higher densities by this treatment. However, not all galactosyl transferase-bearing elements were shifted to the same extent by exposure to the detergent, suggesting a biochemical heterogeneity of the Golgi complex. In contrast to their behavior in microsomes, the distribution of NADH-cytochrome c reductase and cytochrome b5 of Golgi fractions was shifted by digitonin, although to a lesser extent than that of galactosyl transferase. These results indicate that NADH-cytochrome b5 reductase is an authentic component of Golgi membranes, as well as of microsomes and of mitochondria. The conflicting results reported in the past on the Golgi localization of the enzyme could be due, on the one hand, to the differential lability of the activity in its various subcellular locations and, on the other, to the heterogeneity of the Golgi complex in terms of both cholesterol and enzyme distribution.
The distribution of the three glycosyltransferases synthesizing the terminal trisaccharide sialic acid yields D-galactose yields N-acetylglucosamine present in many glycoproteins was determined in Golgi fractions prepared from rat liver homogenates by a modification of the procedure of Ehrenreich et al. (1973, J. Cell Biol. 70:671--684). The enzymes were assayed with asialofetuin, ovomucoid, and Smith-degraded ovomucoid as sugar acceptors. Careful adjustment of the pH of all sucrose solutions to 7.0 +/- 0.1 prevented enzyme inactivation, and allowed quantitative recoveries at every isolation step. The three morphologically and functionally different Golgi fractions GJ1, GF2, and GF3 showed (in that order) decreasing specific activities of all three enzymes, but the relative amounts and relative specific activities of the three transferases in any given fraction were nearly identical. Two marginal fractions, one extra heavy (collected on the gradient below GF3) and the other extra light (isolated by flotation from the postmicrosomal supernate) were found to contain recognizable Golgi elements. An enrichment of any transferase over the two others was not detected in either preparation. A partial release of content from a combined GF1+2 was achieved by treatment with the nonionic detergent Triton X-100. Low Triton/phospholipid ratios (less than 2 mg/mg) led to lysis of the vesicles and cisternae and loss of very low density lipoprotein particles (ascertained by electron microscopy), but failed to separate the transferases from each other; the three enzymes sedimented together with a population of empty vesicles to a density of approximately 1.08 g/ml.
Neuraminidase and galactosyltransferase were investigated in total Golgi appartus and in the three fractions of increasing densities (GF1, GF2, and GF3) isolated from the microsomal fraction of rat liver homogenates by flotation in a discontinuous sucrose density gradient (Ehrenreich, J.H., Bergeron, J.J.M., Siekevitz, P. and Palade, G.E. (1973) J. Cell Biol. 59, 45-72). About 50% decreases in neuraminidase content (units/g liver) and specific activity (units/mg protein) were observed in total Golgi as well as in the three fractions isolated at 45 min, 90 min, 180 min and 16 h after administration of a single oral dose of 50% aqueous ethanol (0.6 g/100 g body weight). Colchicine administration (introperitoneal injection, 0.5 mg/100 g body weight) caused a similar loss of neuraminidase activity; however, the effect of ethanol plus colchicine was not additive. Golgi galactosyltransferase, on the other hand, experienced marked increases of activity following ethanol administration but, unlike the results reported by others (Gang, H., Lieber, C.S. and Rubin, E. (1973) Nat. New Biol. 243, 123-125), significant increases in total activity and specific activity were already quite evident at 90 min after ethanol ingestion. In contrast with the decreased values observed in Golgi, the total particle-bound neuraminidase was significantly elevated following ethanol administration. Ultrastructural studies revealed increased lysosomal content and detachment of polysomes from the rough endoplasmic reticulum. A model, which takes into account these enzymological and ultrastructural findings and their biological significance, is proposed.
The presence of adenylate cyclase (AC) in liver Golgi and microsomal fractions from ethanol-treated rats was tested cytochemically using 5'-adenylyl imidodiphosphate (AMP-PNP) lead phosphate method. Parallel biochemical assays showed that rat liver Golgi AC was only partially inhibited by lead: in the presence of 1 mM Pb++ 80% of the enzyme was preserved, while when 2 mM Pb++ was used 25% remained. No cAMP was formed when the AMP-PNP medium was incubated in the presence of 1 or 2 mM Pb++ but in the absence of cell fractions, indicating that at these concentrations Pb++ does not cause the nonenzymatic hydrolysis of AMP-PNP. Therefore, the reaction product observed by cytochemical localization is not due to the nonenzymatic hydrolysis of AMP-PNP by Pb++. In Golgi subfractions, lead phosphate reaction product was widely distributed among Golgi elements: it was seen in association with the majority of the very low density lipoprotein-filled secretory droplets which predominated in the two lightest Golgi fractions (GF1 and GF2) as well as within the majority of the cisternae found in the heaviest Golgi fraction (GF3). In the latter, reaction product was heaviest along the dilated peripheral rims of the cisternae. In all cases, the reaction product was localized to the outside or cytoplasmic face of the Golgi membranes. When microsomes were incubated cytochemically for AC, deposits were found on the cytoplasmic surface of smooth endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membranes, but none were observed on rough ER membranes. The results confirm the biochemical data reported previously indicating the presence of AC in Golgi and smooth microsomal fractions from rat liver and further demonstrate that the activity is indeed indigenous to Golgi elements and not due to plasma membrane contaminants. They also indicate that AC is widely distributed among Golgi and smooth ER elements. Thus, AC is not restricted in its distribution to plasma membranes as usually assumed.
The distribution of adenylate cyclase (AC) in Golgi and other cell fractions from rat liver was studied using the Golgi isolation procedure of Ehrenreich et al. In liver homogenate the AC activity was found to decay with time, but addition of 1 mM EGTA reduced the rate of enzyme loss. The incorporation of 1 mM EGTA into the sucrose medium used in the initial two centrifugal steps of the Golgi isolation method stabilized the enzyme activity throughout the entire procedure and resulted in good enzyme recovery. In such preparations, AC activity was demonstrated to be associated not only with plasma membranes but also with Golgi membranes and smooth microsomal membranes as well. Furthermore, under the conditions used, enzyme activity was also associated with the 105,000 g x 90 min supernatant fraction. The specific activity of the liver homogenate was found to be 2.9 pmol-mg protein-1-min-1, the nonsedimentabel and microsomal activity was of the same order of magnitude, but the Golgi and plasma membrane activities were much higher. The specific activity of plasma membrane AC was 29 pmol-mg proten-1-min-1. The Golgi activity varied in the three fractions, with the highest activity (14 pmol) in GF1 lowest activity (1.8) in GF2, and intermediate activity (5.5) in GF3, when the Golgi activity was corrected for the presence of content protein, the activity in GF1 became much higher (9 x) than that of the plasma membrane while the activities in GF2 and GF3 were comparable to that of plasma membrane. In all locations studied, the AC was sensitive to NaF stimulation, especially the enzyme associated with Golgi membranes. The activities in plasma and microsomal membranes were stimulated by glucagon, whereas the Golgi and nonsedimentable AC were not.
The incorporation of [3H]leucine in vivo into very low density lipoproteins (VLDL) from the rat hepatic Golgi apparatus and serum was studied. A Golgi-rich fraction isolated on a discontinuous sucrose gradient between 0.5 and 1.1 M was found to contain VLDL having common antigenic determinants with serum VLDL. The incorporation of the [3H]leucine into the Golgi VLDL and serum VLDL suggested a precursor-product relationship. Analysis of the apoproteins of the Golgi VLDL by polacrylamide gel electrophoresis revealed protein bands with similar mobility to those of serum VLDL, except that the former contained virtually no rapidly migrating peptides with the mobility of serum apo-C-II and apo-C-III. The pattern of incorporation of the [3H]leucine into the apoproteins was similar in VLDL from Golgi apparatus and serum, except for the absence of radioactivity in the area of the gel of Golgi apo-VLDL corresponding to apo-C-II and apo-C-III. The radioactive amino acid was incorporated predominantly into the Golgi apo-VLDL bands with similar mobility to apo-B and an apoprotein or group of apoproteins containing the arginine-rich peptide of serum VLDL. In vitro incubation of the Golgi VLDL with [3H]leucine-labeled HDL resulted in the acquisition of a number of proteins, including the rapidly migrating proteins. Administration of colchicine prior to the injection of [3H]leucine resulted in the appearance of gel bands and radioactivity in the apo-C-II and apo-C-III areas of Golgi apo-VLDL, suggesting that these can be acquired if secretion of VLDL is slowed or inhibited. The hepatic Golgi apparatus was then divided into fractions of predominantly forming face (GF3) or secretory granules (GF1). After polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the apo-VLDL from GF, no visible bands or incorporation of [3H]leucine was found in the region of apo-C-II or apo-C-III. However VLDL from GF1, showed visible and radioactive bands in the apo-C-II and apo-C-III area although they represented a much smaller proportion of the total apoprotein than was found in the corresponding serum apo-VLDL. In the isolated perfused liver the percentage incorporation of [3H]leucine into the rapidly migrating apoproteins of Golgi VLDL was considerably less than that found in the corresponding apoproteins of perfusate VLDL, where circulating C lipoproteins are virtually absent. The data indicate that nascent VLDL begins to acquire the C-II and C-III apoproteins during its passage through the Golgi apparatus but that the main acquisition occurs during or after secretion into the space of Disse.
Human growth hormone is, in effect, defined by its activity in an in vivo bioassay and the standard used with it, growth being measured as the increase in body weight in hypophysectomised immature rats. The assay reflects the hormone's survival and metabolism in vivo, its cell-cell interactions, the activation and effects of its secondary hormones, such as GF1 and GF2, and various feedback mechanisms. Although it is insensitive, imprecise, easily influenced by contaminants TSH and vasopressin, it is the only practical assay that reflects all the in vivo properties of "hGH". The in vivo tibial epiphysis bioassay is more sensitive and precise, but the response reflects only the elongation of bone. Both these bioassays are well established. By contrast, in vitro receptor assays do not reflect in vivo properties; there may be different natural forms of receptor molecules, they may be altered during their extraction, and the measured response (like those of immunoassays) is not relevant to the biological action of the hormone. The validity of a bioassay depends on the use of a suitable standard. The collaborative study of the International Standard for human growth hormone (in 1984) revealed marked disparities between results with different assay methods. When a growth hormone protein (such as somatotropin, 191 amino acids) is produced in quantity, reproducibly, and with physicochemical properties consistently related to in vivo bioassay results, it may then be reasonable to use physico-chemical tests for control purposes. Many such tests require international reference materials for comparison purposes.
We report the isolation of a complimentary DNA (cDNA) clone encoding glutamine synthetase, derived from a population of methionine sulfoxime-resistant mouse GF1 fibroblasts. When GF1 cells are incubated for 48 h in the presence of the glucocorticoid hormone dexamethasone, the specific activity of glutamine synthetase (GS), assayed as glutamyltransferase activity, increases by threefold. Based on dot hybridization analysis, hormonal treatment also produces a similar increase in the level of GS mRNA. When GF1 cells or mouse Neuro 2A neuroblastoma cells are transferred from medium containing 4 mM glutamine to glutamine-free medium, glutamyltransferase activity increases by at least fivefold. However, the presence or absence or glutamine in the medium does not affect the relative level of glutamine synthetase mRNA in either cell line. With both GF1 and Neuro 2A cells, the half-time for the decline in glutamine synthetase enzyme activity on addition of glutamine to the medium is approximately 1.5 h. This rapid decline, coupled with the lack of effect of glutamine on the level of GS messenger RNA in Neuro 2A cells, renders it unlikely that neural cells alter glutamine synthetase levels in response to glutamine by a biosynthetic mechanism, as suggested by previous authors [L. Lacoste, K.D. Chaudhary, and J. Lapointe (1982) J. Neurochem. 39, 78-85].
The effects of replacement of external and internal K+ ions by Rb+ ions on the two fast components (gf1 and gf2) and slow component (gs) of the K+ conductance (gK) in frog nodes of Ranvier were investigated under voltage- and current-clamp conditions. Fast and slow components of gK were separated by double exponential fits to tail currents following long depolarizing pre-pulses, or by the use of short pre-pulses which activate little gs X gs was also isolated by 1 mM-4-aminopyridine (4-AP). gf1 and gf2 were distinguished in the fast conductance-voltage curve by their different voltage dependences, gf1 activating at more negative potentials. Reversal potential measurements indicated that Rb+ is less permeant than K+, and measurements in 4-AP indicated that the slow component has a lower Rb+ permeability than the fast. In a 50% K+, 50% Rb+ mixture PRb/PK was less than that in 100% Rb+ suggesting that PRb/PK is mole-fraction dependent. With external Rb+ the current-voltage relation was shifted by ca.-10 mV compared to that in K+, an effect on gf ( = gf1 + gf2). The slow conductance (gs) and, under similar conditions, the Na+ current-voltage relation were not shifted. gf, calculated from inward tail currents, was reduced with external Rb+ at potentials where gf2 was activated. Instantaneous current-voltage relations following pre-pulses which activate different components of gf confirmed these observations. In K+ the instantaneous current-voltage relation showed some inward rectification which was largely abolished with Rb+. Comparison of gf calculated from outward (go) and inward (gi) currents confirmed this, and showed that inward gf2 was reduced with Rb+ such that go = gi. Outward currents were little affected by external Rb+. External Rb+ slowed the fast inward tail current following all pre-pulses which activate gf, but had no effect on the time course of the slow component of the tail current. Regenerative responses, which occur in high [K+] (+300 nM-tetrodotoxin) solutions in current clamp did not repolarize in Rb+. Voltage-clamp experiments showed that inactivation of inward currents is slowed when Rb+ is the charge carrier. Replacement of internal K+, by application of Rb+ to the cut ends of the fibre, shifted the reversal potential to more positive potentials but had no effect on the conductance or kinetics. External Rb+ has a large number of effects on inward currents, but little effect on outward currents. Internal Rb+ had little effect on outward or inward currents.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
A simple one-step isolation technique significantly enriched mouse fetal liver cells that respond to interleukin 3 (IL-3), a multilineage hematopoietic growth factor. The fetal liver cell subpopulation isolated with monoclonal antibody AA4 contained 50- to 100-fold higher frequencies of multipotential (CFU-mix) or restricted (CFU-G/M, BFU-E) erythroid/myeloid precursors as well as precursors that differentiate to become mature B lymphocytes [CFU-mix = erythroid and myeloid colony-forming unit(s); CFU-G/M = CFU-granulocyte/macrophage; BFU-E = burst-forming unit-erythroid]. The B-lymphocyte precursors could be cloned in single-cell cultures when IL-3-containing supernatants were present. Growth of these clones was supported by purified IL-3 but not by purified IL-2. Stable growth has been maintained for greater than 6 mo in the presence of IL-3. Such clones express on their cell surface low amounts of class I major histocompatibility complex antigens and high amounts of AA4, GF1, and leukocyte common glycoprotein 200 antigens. They lack detectable rearrangements of their Ig-encoding genes [joining region heavy and light (kappa, lambda) chain genes], even after subcloning, but maintain their capacity to differentiate to mature B lymphocytes committed to multiple Ig specificities.
Intracellular transport of a newly synthesized asialoglycoprotein receptor was studied biochemically using a monospecific antibody for the receptor. Pulse-labeling by intravenous injection of [3H]leucine and pulse-chasing after 10 min by cycloheximide injection resulted in the maximal labeling of the receptor in the rough microsomes at 15 min, in the smooth microsomes and the heavy Golgi subfraction (GF3) at 25 min and in the intermediate plus light Golgi subfraction (GF1+2) at 30 min. By 60 min, the labeling in GF1+2 had decreased and leveled off. In the plasma membrane fraction, the labeled receptor first appeared at 20 min, increased rapidly and also reached a constant level at 40-60 min. Intracellular movement of the newly synthesized receptor in the GF1+2 and plasma membrane fractions was also investigated by purifying the receptor protein from the GF1+2 and plasma membrane fractions by affinity chromatography. It was revealed that the specific radioactivities of the receptor in the two fractions become equilibrated after 60-120 min. The receptor of the various membrane fractions was also pulse-labeled in vivo for 20 min simultaneously with [3H]glucosamine and [14C]leucine, and pulse-chased for the following 40 min. After pulse-labeling for 20 min, the ratio of the radioactivity of [3H]glucosamine or [3H]sialic acid to [14C]leucine of the receptor from the rough and smooth microsomes, and GF3, GF2, and GF1 increased in that order. That of the receptor from the plasma membrane fraction was infinitely higher, because, while a significant amount of 3H-radioactivity was incorporated into the receptor in the Golgi apparatus, only a negligible amount of 14C-radioactivity was incorporated into the same receptor in the plasma membrane due to the delay in the arrival of [14C]leucine labeled receptor to the plasma membrane. After chasing for 40 min, however, the same radioactivity ratios of the GF1 and plasma membrane fractions approached each other. All these results strongly suggest that the distribution of the newly synthesized receptor becomes rapidly equilibrated between the trans-Golgi components and plasma membranes probably by repeated recycling of the receptor protein between the two membranes.
Direct ferritin immunoelectron microscopy was used to visualize the asialoglycoprotein receptor in various rat liver subcellular fractions. The cytoplasmic surfaces of cytoplasmic organelles such as the rough and smooth microsomes, Golgi cisternae and lysosomes showed hardly any ferritin label exception for the slight labeling of secretory granules found mainly in the light Golgi fraction (GF1). Occasionally, however, open membrane sheet structures, smooth vesicular or tubular structures heavily labeled with ferritin, were present in all these subcellular fractions. These structures probably correspond to fragmented sinusoidal or lateral hepatocyte plasma membranes recovered to these subcellular fractions. When the limiting membranes of the secretion granules were partially broken by mechanical force, a number of ferritin particles frequently were seen attached in large clusters to the luminal surface of the membrane, the cytoplasmic surface of the corresponding domain being slightly labeled. These observations are strong evidence that the receptor protein is never translocated vertically throughout the intracellular transport from ER to plasma membrane via Golgi apparatus and from plasma membrane back to trans-Golgi elements and also in lysosomes, always exposing the major antigenic sites to the luminal or extracellular surface and the minor counterparts to the cytoplasmic surface of the membranes. The receptor protein also is suggested to be concentrated in clusters on the luminal surface of secretion granules when they form on the trans-side of the Golgi apparatus.
Glycosylation of a rat receptor specific for asialoglycoproteins was investigated in vivo by using monospecific antibody. After intravenous injection of [3H]mannose, the receptor protein was immunoprecipitated from various subcellular fractions and the glycopeptide and oligosaccharide chains of the protein were prepared by treatment with pronase and endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase H. The glycopeptides thus prepared from the rough and smooth microsomes and Golgi heavy fraction (GF3) were all sensitive to endo H and most of the endo H-sensitive oligosaccharides were eluted at the position considered to correspond to Man8GlcNAc on high-resolution Bio-Gel chromatography. Endo H-resistant forms were first detected in the Golgi intermediate fraction (GF2) and significantly in the light Golgi fraction (GF1), suggesting the formation of the complex-type oligosaccharide chains in the latter fraction. This view was also supported by the almost exclusive addition of the terminal sugars such as N-acetylglucosamine, galactose, and sialic acid in GF1. These results suggest that the major form of the oligosaccharide chains from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi apparatus is Man8GlcNAc2 and that the processing of these large mannosyloligosaccharide chains and subsequent addition of terminal sugars to them are performed successively in the trans-Golgi region.
A large number of monoclonal antibodies, produced by immunizing rats with mouse pre-B cell lines, have been analyzed for their ability to define cell surface antigens expressed by B cells at early stages of differentiation. Whereas many antibodies recognized antigens on pre-B cell lines, only two clones detected cell surface antigens that were distinguished by their restricted distribution among a panel of continuous cell lines and cells from various tissues. Monoclonal antibody clone AA4.1 recognized a cell surface antigen found on all pre-B lymphomas and on one of three B lymphomas tested. This antigen was found on cells at highest frequency in the bone marrow. Adult spleen and fetal liver also have detectable numbers of AA4.1+ cells. Cells that did not express this antigen include plasmacytomas, two of three B lymphomas, T lymphomas, a stem cell line, adult liver, brain, thymus, and lymph node cells. Clone GF1.2 detected an antigen on some pre-B cell lines, one of three B lymphomas tested, and a small fraction of cells from adult bone marrow, spleen, lymph node, and fetal liver. Plasmacytomas, some pre-B lymphomas, two B lymphomas, T lymphomas, adult liver, brain, and thymus cells were negative. In adult bone marrow, AA4.1 bound to all cytoplasmic IgM+ pre-B cells, whereas GF1.2 detected one-half of these cells. Both antibodies recognized approximately 50% of surface IgM+ (sIgM+) bone marrow cells. A small population of bone marrow cells lacking any detectable Ig (surface or cytoplasmic) also reacted with these antibodies. Depletion of AA4.1 or GF1.2 antigen-bearing cells from bone marrow reduced the ability of bone marrow B cells to respond to LPS by 50 to 65%. Experiments with a cloned pre-B lymphoma demonstrate that AA4.1+ pre-B cells become sIgM+ GF1.2+ B cells after activation with LPS. These antibodies recognize cell surface determinants with restricted distribution among the B lymphocyte lineage because they detect antigens displayed by normal and transformed immature B lymphocytes.
Ginsenoside F1 (GF1) is a metabolite of ginsenoside Rg1. Although GF1 has several benefits for skin physiology, the effect of GF1 on skin pigmentation has not been reported. We found that a cream containing 0.1% GF1 showed a significant whitening effect on artificially tanned human skin after 8 weeks of application. However, GF1 did not inhibit mRNA expression of tyrosinase or dopachrome tautomerase (DCT) in normal human epidermal melanocytes (NHEMs) or cocultured NHEMs/normal human epidermal keratinocytes. Interestingly, GF1 enhanced production of interleukin 13 (IL-13) from human epidermal γδ T cells. IL-13 significantly reduced the mRNA expression and protein amount of both tyrosinase and DCT and reduced melanin synthesis activities in NHEMs, resulting in visible brightening of NHEM pellet. These results suggest that enhancement of IL-13 production by GF1 from epidermal γδ T cells might play a role in the skin-whitening effect of GF1 via the suppression of tyrosinase and DCT. 
Acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) is characterised by the halt in maturation of myeloid progenitor cells, combined with uncontrolled proliferation and abnormal survival, leading to the accumulation of immature blasts. In many subtypes of AML the underlying causative genetic insults are not fully described. MicroRNAs are known to be dysregulated during oncogenesis. Overexpression of miR-155 is associated with some cancers, including haematological malignancies, and it has been postulated that miR-155 has an oncogenic role. This study investigated the effects of modulating miR-155 expression in human AML cells, and its mechanism of action.
Analysis of miR-155 expression patterns in AML patients found that Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3)-wildtype AML has the same expression level as normal bone marrow, with increased expression restricted to AML with the FLT3-ITD mutation. Induction of apoptosis by cytarabine arabinoside or myelomonocytic differentiation by 1,23-dihydroxyvitaminD3 in FLT3-wildtype AML cells led to upregulated miR-155 expression. Knockdown of miR-155 by locked nucleic acid antisense oligonucleotides in the FLT3-wildtype AML cells conferred resistance to cytarabine arabinoside induced apoptosis and suppressed the ability of cells to differentiate.Ectopic expression of miR-155 in FLT3-wildtype AML cells led to a significant gain of myelomonocytic markers (CD11b, CD14 and CD15), increase in apoptosis (AnnexinV binding), decrease in cell growth and clonogenic capacity.In silico target prediction identified a number of putative miR-155 target genes, and the expression changes of key transcription regulators of myeloid differentiation and apoptosis (MEIS1, GF1, cMYC, JARID2, cJUN, FOS, CTNNB1 and TRIB2) were confirmed by PCR. Assessment of expression of apoptosis-related proteins demonstrated a marked increase in cleaved caspase-3 expression confirming activation of the apoptosis cascade.
This study provides evidence for an anti-leukaemic role for miR-155 in human FLT3-wildtype AML, by inducing cell apoptosis and myelomonocytic differentiation, which is in contrast to its previously hypothesized role as an oncogene. This highlights the complexity of gene regulation by microRNAs that may have tumour repressor or oncogenic effects depending on disease context or tissue type.
Protein kinase D (PKD) is activated within cells by stimulation of multiple G protein coupled receptors (GPCR). Earlier studies demonstrated a role for PKC to mediate rapid activation loop phosphorylation-dependent PKD activation. Subsequently, a novel PKC-independent pathway in response to Gαq-coupled GPCR stimulation was identified. Here, we examined further the specificity and PKC-dependence of PKD activation using COS-7 cells cotransfected with different Gq-family Gα and stimulated with aluminum fluoride (AlF4⁻). PKD activation was measured by kinase assays, and Western blot analysis of activation loop sites Ser⁷⁴⁴, a prominent and rapid PKC transphosphorylation site, and Ser⁷⁴⁸, a site autophosphorylated in the absence of PKC signaling. Treatment with AlF4⁻ potently induced PKD activation and Ser⁷⁴⁴ and Ser⁷⁴⁸ phosphorylation, in the presence of cotransfected Gαq, Gα11, Gα14 or Gα15. These treatments achieved PKD activation loop phosphorylation similar to the maximal levels obtained by stimulation with the phorbol ester, PDBu. Preincubation with the PKC inhibitor GF1 potently blocked Gα11-, Gα14-, and Gα15-mediated enhancement of Ser⁷⁴⁸ phosphorylation induced by AlF4⁻, and largely abolished Ser⁷⁴⁴ phosphorylation. In contrast, Ser⁷⁴⁸ phosphorylation was almost completely intact, and Ser⁷⁴⁴ phosphorylation was significantly activated in cells cotransfected with Gαq. Importantly, the differential Ser⁷⁴⁸ phosphorylation was also promoted by treatment of Swiss 3T3 cells with Pasteurella multocida toxin, a selective activator of Gαq but not Gα11. Taken together, our results suggest that Gαq, but not the closely related Gα11, promotes PKD activation in response to GPCR ligands in a unique manner leading to PKD autophosphorylation at Ser⁷⁴⁸.
Glibenclamide is an oral hypoglycemic drug completely metabolized in the liver, the principal metabolite being very weakly active, buccal delivery may be useful for the treatment of diabetes more effectively. The aim of the present study was to design formulations and systematically evaluate in vitro and ex vivo performances of buccal films of glibenclamide so that the required therapeutic plasma concentrations can possibly be achieved more rapidly using the different grades of hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose (HPMC) as the base matrix.
Mucoadhesive buccal films of glibenclamide were prepared by solvent casting technique using different grades of HPMC with different ratios. Prepared films were evaluated for weight, thickness, surface pH, swelling index (SI), folding endurance, drug content uniformity, in vitro release, and ex vivo permeation studies.
The film thickness and weight were in the range of 0.213-0.4892mm and 22.25-39.83 mg, respectively. The films exhibited controlled release over more than 6 h. HPMC, HPMCK100, and HPMC3000 films exhibited satisfactory swelling. Surface pH of buccal films was found to be 6.4-6.8. SI observed to be highest for GF12 (275.3 ± 12.17) and lowest for GF1 (173.5 ± 5.65). The films exhibited controlled release over more than 6 h. HPMC exhibited satisfactory swelling, an optimum residence time, and promising drug release. The Higuchi plots were found to be linear with correlation coefficient values of 0.8933, 0.9138, and 0.9947 for GF4, GF8, and GF9, respectively.
Among all the formulations, GF9 shows good controlled release results correlated with ex vivo permeation studies.
TRPC6 is a cation channel in the plasma membrane that plays a role in Ca(2+) entry following the stimulation of a G(q)-protein coupled or tyrosine kinase receptor. A dysregulation of TRPC6 activity causes abnormal proliferation of smooth muscle cells and glomerulosclerosis. In the present study, we investigated the regulation of TRPC6 activity by protein kinase C (PKC). We showed that inhibiting PKC with GF1 or activating it with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate potentiated and inhibited agonist-induced Ca(2+) entry, respectively, into cells expressing TRPC6. Similar results were obtained when TRPC6 was directly activated with 1-oleyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycerol. Activation of the cells with carbachol increased the phosphorylation of TRPC6, an effect that was prevented by the inhibition of PKC. The target residue of PKC was identified by an alanine screen of all canonical PKC sites on TRPC6. Unexpectedly, all the mutants, including TRPC6(S768A) (a residue previously proposed to be a target for PKC), displayed PKC-dependent inhibition of channel activity. Phosphorylation prediction software suggested that Ser(448), in a non-canonical PKC consensus sequence, was a potential target for PKCδ. Ba(2+) and Ca(2+) entry experiments revealed that GF1 did not potentiate TRPC6(S448A) activity. Moreover, activation of PKC did not enhance the phosphorylation state of TRPC6(S448A). Using A7r5 vascular smooth muscle cells, which endogenously express TRPC6, we observed that a novel PKC isoform is involved in the inhibition of the vasopressin-induced Ca(2+) entry. Furthermore, knocking down PKCδ in A7r5 cells potentiated vasopressin-induced Ca(2+) entry. In summary, we provide evidence that PKCδ exerts a negative feedback effect on TRPC6 through the phosphorylation of Ser(448).
The combined use of brush anodes and glass fiber (GF1) separators, and plastic mesh supporters were used here for the first time to create a scalable microbial fuel cell architecture. Separators prevented short circuiting of closely-spaced electrodes, and cathode supporters were used to avoid water gaps between the separator and cathode that can reduce power production. The maximum power density with a separator and supporter and a single cathode was 75 ± 1 W/m(3). Removing the separator decreased power by 8%. Adding a second cathode increased power to 154 ± 1 W/m(3). Current was increased by connecting two MFCs connected in parallel. These results show that brush anodes, combined with a glass fiber separator and a plastic mesh supporter, produce a useful MFC architecture that is inherently scalable due to good insulation between the electrodes and a compact architecture.
Two challenges for improving the performance of air cathode, single-chamber microbial fuel cells (MFCs) include increasing Coulombic efficiency (CE) and decreasing internal resistance. Nonbiodegradable glass fiber separators between the two electrodes were shown to increase power and CE, compared to cloth separators (J-cloth) that were degraded over time. MFC tests were conducted using glass fiber mats with thicknesses of 1.0 mm (GF1) or 0.4 mm (GF0.4), a cation exchange membrane (CEM), and a J-cloth (JC), using reactors with different configurations. Higher power densities were obtained with either GF1 (46 +/- 4 W/m(3)) or JC (46 +/- 1 W/m(3)) in MFCs with a 2 cm electrode spacing, when the separator was placed against the cathode (S-configuration), rather than MFCs with GF0.4 (36 +/- 1 W/m(3)) or CEM (14 +/- 1 W/m(3)). Power was increased to 70 +/- 2 W/m(3) by placing the electrodes on either side of the GF1 separator (single separator electrode assembly, SSEA) and further to 150 +/- 6 W/m(3) using two sets of electrodes spaced 2 cm apart (double separator electrode assembly, DSEA). Reducing the DSEA electrode spacing to 0.3 cm increased power to 696 +/- 26 W/m(3) as a result of a decrease in the ohmic resistance from 5.9 to 2.2 Omega. The main advantages of a GF1 separator compared to JC were an improvement in the CE from 40% to 81% (S-configuration), compared to only 20-40% for JC under similar conditions, and the fact that GF1 was not biodegradable. The high CE for the GF1 separator was attributed to a low oxygen mass transfer coefficient (k(O) = 5.0 x 10(-5) cm/s). The GF1 and JC materials differed in the amount of biomass that accumulated on the separator and its biodegradability, which affected long-term power production and oxygen transport. These results show that materials and mass transfer properties of separators are important factors for improving power densities, CE, and long-term performance of MFCs.
The high performance gel permeation chromatographic (HPGPC) behaviors of four beta-1, 3/1, 6-glucans (GF1, GF2, GF3, GF4) with different protein contents and one alpha-1, 4/1, 6-glucan (P100) from Grifola frondosa were examined with different concentrations of NaCl solution and pH values. The experimental results showed that the relative molecular mass (M(r)) of the beta-glucans sharply dropped as the NaCl concentration was less than 0.025 mol/L and then tended to be stable as the NaCl concentration was raised from 0.1 to 0.2 mol/L, the M(r) increased quickly from pH 3 to 6, and then maintained stable from pH 6 to 9, but slightly increased as the pH value was higher than 9. However, the M(r) of the alpha-1, 4/1, 6-glucan was slightly affected by either different concentrations of NaCl or different pH values. The beta-glucan existed in a super-helix structure in aqueous solution, which could be influenced by the NaCl concentration and pH value. These factors led to the different molecular aggregation states, and the increase or decrease of the M(r) of beta-glucans, displaying a variety of HPGPC behaviors.
Amaranthus spinosus Linn. (thorny amaranth), a plant that grows in the wild fields of Taiwan, is extensively used in Chinese traditional medicine to treat diabetes. There have been no published studies on the immunological effects of A. spinosus. To determine whether A. spinosus has immuno-modulatory effects and clarify which types of immune effector cells are stimulated in vitro, we investigated the stimulatory effect of wild A. spinosus water extract (WASWE) on spleen cells from female BALB/c mice. We found that WASWE significantly stimulated splenocyte proliferation. However, isolated B lymphocytes, but not T lymphocytes, could be stimulated by WASWE in a dose response manner. After sequentially purifying WASWE, a novel immuno-stimulating protein (GF1) with a molecular weight of 313 kDa was obtained. The immuno-stimulating activity of the purified protein (GF1) was 309 times higher than that of WASWE. These results indicate that WASWE does indeed exhibit immuno-stimulating activity via directly stimulating B lymphocyte activation in vitro. Further, these results suggest that the immuno-stimulating effects of WASWE might lead to B lymphocyte activation and subsequent T cell proliferation in vitro. These results are potentially valuable for future nutraceutical and immuno-pharmacological use of WASWE or its purified fractions.
We have isolated a gene, LdGF1, from the protozoan parasite Leishmania donovani. Overexpression of this gene confers a strong selective advantage in liquid culture after stationary phase growth arrest. We could show that recombinant L. donovani or Leishmania major, when overexpressing LdGF1, recover faster from a stationary phase growth arrest than control parasite strains. While no advantage of LdGF1 overexpression could be observed in log phase cultures or after a hydroxyurea-induced S-phase growth arrest, recovery from a cell cycle arrest due to serum deprivation was faster in LdGF1-overexpressing strains. This was found to be due to an accelerated release from a G(1) cell cycle arrest. By contrast, in a BALB/c mouse infection system, overexpression of LdGF1 in L. major resulted in reduced virulence. We conclude that increased levels of LdGF1 are beneficiary during recovery from G(1) cell cycle arrest, but pose a disadvantage inside a mammalian host. These results are discussed in the context of the observed loss of virulence during in vitro passage of Leishmania parasites.
We report on what is to our knowledge the first fabrication of fiber Bragg gratings by UV femtosecond radiation. The Bragg gratings, with photoinduced refractive-index modulation up to 1.92 x 10(-3) in H2-loaded SMF-28 and up to 1.05 x 10(-3) in Nufern GF1 fibers, were written by high-intensity (31-77-GW/cm2) femtosecond pulses at 264 nm. The dependence of the refractive-index modulation on intensity at equal fluences points to a two-photon absorption mechanism for grating inscription.
Patients with familial dysautonomia (FD) frequently experience hypertensive crises after gastrostomy feeding. The central alpha2-agonist clonidine attenuates feeding-induced crises. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of clonidine on cardiovascular autonomic modulation and particularly baroreflex sensitivity in familial dysautonomia after gastrostomy feeding.
In nine patients, we monitored the RR-interval and systolic blood pressure at supine rest before (baseline 1) and after gastrostomy feeding (GF1). One day later, recordings were repeated after clonidine intake (baseline 2, GF2). We determined spectral powers of RR-interval and systolic blood pressure in the low- (LF) and high-frequency range (HF). Sympathovagal balance was determined from the LF/HF ratio of RR-interval. Baroreflex sensitivity was assessed from the alpha-index of systolic blood pressure and RR-interval.
Gastrostomy feeding decreased RR-interval, while systolic blood pressure remained stable. Clonidine induced higher RR-intervals before and after gastrostomy feeding but decreased systolic blood pressure at baseline only. Gastrostomy feeding decreased HF-power of RR-interval significantly without clonidine, but only slightly after premedication. Clonidine increased the HF-power of RR-interval slightly at baseline and significantly after gastrostomy feeding. Gastrostomy feeding increased the LF/HF ratio without clonidine only. Clonidine decreased the LF/HF ratio at baseline and after gastrostomy feeding. Gastrostomy feeding did not change baroreflex sensitivity, but baroreflex sensitivity was higher at visit 2 than visit 1.
In familial dysautonomia, clonidine augments baroreflex sensitivity and parasympathetic modulation. The resulting cardiovascular stabilization might attenuate feeding-induced crises.
The Japanese silver crucian carp, Carassius langsdorfii, is a naturally polyploid fish that reproduces by gynogenesis, resulting in a geographically clustered clonal population. To determine the amount of clonal diversity in this species, we used genetic markers to compare fish from several Japanese locations. Samples were collected from Lake Kasumigaura (Ibaraki Pref.), Lake Imba (Chiba Pref.), Lake Fukushimagata (Niigata Pref.), Lake Biwa (Shiga Pref.), Lake Koyama (Tottori Pref.), and the Niyodo and Monobe Rivers (Kochi Pref.). The genetic markers used were the microsatellite loci GF1(*), GF17(*), and GF29(*), as well as isozyme (creatinekinase CK(*)) and mtDNA (D-loop region) RFLP. In the seven locations sampled, 61 clonal lines were identified by combining the genotypes of the three microsatellite loci. Populations at all locations consisted of six to 28 clonal lines. Fourteen common clonal lines were detected in two or more locations, and 13 of these were observed in Lake Biwa. We suggest that these clonal lines have been widely distributed in Japanese freshwaters through the intentional stocking of fish species such as "gengorobuna" (C. cuvieri) and "ayu" (Plecoglossus altivelis altivelis) obtained from Lake Biwa and its adjacent waters. The CK(*) genotypes and mtDNA haplotypes of fish from Lake Kasumigaura differed from those of other locations.
The nmd mouse mutation causes progressive degeneration of spinal motor neurons and muscle atrophy. We identified the mutated gene as the putative transcriptional activator and ATPase/DNA helicase previously described as Smbp2, Rip1, Gf1, or Catf1. Mutations were found in two alleles-a single amino acid deletion in nmdJ and a splice donor mutation in nmd2J. The selective vulnerability of motor neurons is striking in view of the widespread expression of this gene, although the pattern of degeneration may reflect a specific threshold since neither allele is null. In addition, the severity of the nmd phenotype is attenuated in a semidominant fashion by a major genetic locus on chromosome (Chr) 13. The identification of the nmd gene and mapping of a major suppressor provide new opportunities for understanding mechanisms of motor neuron degeneration.
Mast cells play a central role in inflammatory and immediate-type allergic reactions. These granulated cells release by a process of regulated exocytosis a variety of biologically active substances which are either preformed (e.g. histamine), or synthesized de novo following activation [e. g. metabolites of arachidonic acid (AA) and multifunctional cytokines]. Exocytosis in mast cells is activated either in response to aggregation of the receptors for immunoglobulin E (FcepsilonRI) or by the direct activation of pertussis toxin-sensitive G-proteins by a class of receptor mimetic agents, collectively known as basic secretagogues of mast cells. In the present study we show that compound 48/80 (c48/80), a synthetic member of the class of basic secretagogues, stimulates protein tyrosine phosphorylation of a number of as yet unidentified cellular substrates. These phosphorylations were inhibited by the tyrphostin AG-18, by the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor wortmannin and by the protein kinase C inhibitors K252a and GF1 09203X. These inhibitors also inhibited the release of AA induced by c48/80 but had no effect on exocytosis. Taken together, our findings suggest that basic secretagogues induce protein tyrosine phosphorylation as part of their parallel multiple signaling pathways which are presumably mediated by more than one G-protein. Both protein kinase C and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase serve as intermediates in this signaling pathway. The protein tyrosine kinase signaling pathway, which mediates the activation of AA release, does not contribute to secretion of the preformed mediators such as histamine, but it might largely contribute to the de novo production of inflammatory mediators like leukotrienes and prostaglandins.
Previously, we demonstrated that protein-DNA interactions at the drug response element (DRE) in the human apoA-I promoter were important for the induction of apoA-I gene expression by gemfibrozil. We now report the cloning and characterization of a DRE transactivating factor. The cloned protein is identical to the putative helicase and potential transcription factor human S mu binding protein-2 (HSmuBP2). It is also related to glial factor-1 (GF1), an incomplete version of HSmuBP2 lacking the first 494 and the last 128 amino acids. Gel mobility shift assays demonstrated that HSmuBP2 binds apoA-I DRE oligomers and forms a specific protein-DNA complex. Northern blot analysis showed that HSmuBP2 mRNA is expressed at various levels in a wide range of human tissues. Transient cotransfection experiments performed in HepG2 cells demonstrated that overexpression of HSmuBP2 or GF1 induced apoA-I proximal promoter activity by 3-fold and that the apoA-I DRE was necessary for transactivation. Additionally, we demonstrated that transactivation was increased a further 2- to 3-fold by exposing the cells to gemfibrozil. Together these observations indicate that HSmuBP2 acts as a transcription factor that regulates apoA-I gene expression in hepatoma cells and whose activity may be stimulated by gemfibrozil treatment.
Detection and ultrastructural localization of aspartyl proteinase (Sap) in Candida albicans experimentally infecting rat vagina were studied. Two Sap-positive (Sap+) and one Sap-negative (Sap-) strains of the fungus, endowed with high and low experimental vaginopathic potential, respectively, were used. Both Sap+ strains produced consistent Sap levels in the rat vagina, while the Sap- strain did not produce any measurable Sap. Electron microscopy of thin sections of chemically-fixed vaginal scrapings showed clear evidence of hyphae of proteolitic strains of C. albicans invading the keratinized epithelial cell layer of the vagina. The fungal cells exhibited a pronounced fibrillar layer on the cell wall with a marked intermixing of fungal and vaginal materials especially pronounced at the hyphal tip. Post-embedding immunogold techniques with the use of anti-Sap polyclonal and the specifically generated monoclonal antibody GF1 showed that Sap was essentially localized in the cell wall of C. albicans early during infection, in a cytological pattern mirroring Sap localization in C. albicans cells grown in Sap-inductive media in vitro. In summary, the data offer a new biochemical and ultrastructural evidence that Sap is actively secreted during experimental rat vaginitis by C. albicans. Cell wall localization of Sap is probably inherent to this active secretion process.
Grass pea (Lathyrus sativus L.) seeds contain an endogenous neurotoxic non-proteinogenic amino acid, β-N-oxalyl-l-α,β-diaminopropionic acid (β-ODAP), a major limiting factor-for their human consumption. Furthermore, phytate (IP6), a well-known antinutrient is present in concentration capable of hindering bioavailability of iron (Fe), zinc (Zn), calcium (Ca), phosphorus (P) and other micronutrients from the seeds. Due to the reported capability of high hydrostatic pressure (HHP) to reduce the content of certain antinutritional/toxic agents in seeds and grains, the impact of HHP on the reduction of β-ODAP and IP6 were investigated. The contents of β-ODAP of accessions from different regions in Ethiopia were found to be in the range of 51.94 to 806.52 mg/100 g. Accession (GF1- Alemu, AK) exhibiting the highest β-ODAP content was selected for HHP treatment in soaked and batter forms using Central Composite Face Centered Design of experiments. The best HHP conditions in respect to β-ODAP reduction were also applied to the accession (GP-240038) with the lowest β-ODAP-content, a genetically improved variety (Wassie) and a variety from Germany (GR). The HHP treatment at 600 MPa for 25 min of seeds soaked for 6 h and 12 h exhibited the maximum reduction of β-ODAP (232.11 mg/100 g) and IP6 (21.11 mg/100 g) respectively. The combined incremental effect of pressure and soaking time resulted in a more significant (p ≤ .001) reduction in both compounds than the interaction of pressure with holding time (p ≤ .05). A reduction of β-ODAP from 36.00 to 71.22% by soaked-HHP treatment was observed. β-ODAP reductions were always higher for soaked compared to batter grass pea seeds. IP6 contents after HHP treatment ranged from 33.65 mg/100 g to nill. It can be concluded that pressure, soaking and holding time as well as the grass pea seed accession/variety had great impact on molecular structure changes, enhancement of enzyme activity and reduction in β-ODAP and IP6 content.
Panax notoginseng saponins (PNS) are the major components of Panax notoginseng, with multiple pharmacological activities but poor oral bioavailability. PNS could be metabolized by gut microbiota in vitro, while the exact role of gut microbiota of PNS metabolism in vivo remains poorly understood. In this study, pseudo germ-free rat models were constructed by using broad-spectrum antibiotics to validate the gut microbiota-mediated transformation of PNS in vivo. Moreover, a high performance liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-ESI-MS/MS) was developed for quantitative analysis of four metabolites of PNS, including ginsenoside F1 (GF1), ginsenoside Rh2 (GRh2), ginsenoside compound K (GCK) and protopanaxatriol (PPT). The results showed that the four metabolites could be detected in the control rat plasma, while they could not be determined in pseudo germ-free rat plasma. The results implied that PNS could not be biotransformed effectively when gut microbiota was disrupted. In conclusion, gut microbiota plays an important role in biotransformation of PNS into metabolites in vivo.
Interactions of 21 fentanyl derivatives with μ-opioid receptor (μOR) were studied using experimental and theoretical methods. Their binding to μOR was assessed with radioligand competitive binding assay. A uniform set of binding affinity data contains values for two novel and one previously uncharacterized derivative. The data confirms trends known so far and thanks to their uniformity, they facilitate further comparisons. In order to provide structural hypotheses explaining the experimental affinities, the complexes of the studied derivatives with μOR were modeled and subject to molecular dynamics simulations. Five common General Features (GFs) of fentanyls' binding modes stemmed from these simulations. They include: GF1) the ionic interaction between D147 and the ligands' piperidine NH⁺ moiety; GF2) the N-chain orientation towards the μOR interior; GF3) the other pole of ligands is directed towards the receptor outlet; GF4) the aromatic anilide ring penetrates the subpocket formed by TM3, TM4, ECL1 and ECL2; GF5) the 4-axial substituent (if present) is directed towards W318. Except for the ionic interaction with D147, the majority of fentanyl-μOR contacts is hydrophobic. Interestingly, it was possible to find nonlinear relationships between the binding affinity and the volume of the N-chain and/or anilide's aromatic ring. This kind of relationships is consistent with the apolar character of interactions involved in ligand⁻receptor binding. The affinity reaches the optimum for medium size while it decreases for both large and small substituents. Additionally, a linear correlation between the volumes and the average dihedral angles of W293 and W133 was revealed by the molecular dynamics study. This seems particularly important, as the W293 residue is involved in the activation processes. Further, the Y326 (OH) and D147 (Cγ) distance found in the simulations also depends on the ligands' size. In contrast, neither RMSF measures nor D114/Y336 hydrations show significant structure-based correlations. They also do not differentiate studied fentanyl derivatives. Eventually, none of 14 popular scoring functions yielded a significant correlation between the predicted and observed affinity data (R &lt; 0.30, n = 28).
Urban forests help in mitigating carbon emissions; however, their associations with landscape patterns are unclear. Understanding the associations would help us to evaluate urban forest ecological services and favor urban forest management via landscape regulations. We used Harbin, capital city of the northernmost province in China, as an example and hypothesized that the urban forests had different landscape metrics among different forest types, administrative districts, and urban-rural gradients, and these differences were closely associated with forest carbon sequestration in the biomass and soils.
We extracted the urban forest tree coverage area on the basis of 2 GF-1 remote sensing images and object-oriented based classification method. The analysis of forest landscape patterns and estimation of carbon storage were based on tree coverage data and 199 plots. We also examined the relationships between forest landscape metrics and carbon storage on the basis of forest types, administrative districts, ring roads, and history of urban settlements by using statistical methods.
The small patches covering an area of less than 0.5 ha accounted for 72.6% of all patches (average patch size, 0.31 ha). The mean patch size (AREA_MN) and largest patch index (LPI) were the highest in the landscape and relaxation forest and Songbei District. The landscape shape index (LSI) and number of patches linearly decreased along rural-urban gradients (p &lt; 0.05). The tree biomass carbon storage varied from less than 10 thousand tons in the urban center (first ring road region and 100-year regions) to more than 100 thousand tons in the rural regions (fourth ring road and newly urbanized regions). In the same urban-rural gradients, soil carbon storage varied from less than five thousand tons in the urban centers to 73-103 thousand tons in the rural regions. The association analysis indicated that the total forest area was the key factor that regulates total carbon storage in trees and soils. However, in the case of carbon density (ton ha-1), AREA_MN was strongly associated with tree biomass carbon, and soil carbon density was negatively related to LSI (p &lt; 0.01) and AREA_MN (p &lt; 0.05), but positively related to LPI (p &lt; 0.05).
The urban forests were more fragmented in Harbin than in other provincial cities in Northeastern China, as shown by the smaller patch size, more complex patch shape, and larger patch density. The decrease in LSI along the rural-urban gradients may contribute to the forest carbon sequestrations in downtown regions, particularly underground soil carbon accumulation, and the increasing patch size may benefit tree carbon sequestration. Our findings help us to understand how forest landscape metrics are associated with carbon storage function. These findings related to urban forest design may maximize forest carbon sequestration services and facilitate in precisely estimating the forest carbon sink.
Growth factor independent 1 (Gfi1) controls myeloid differentiation by regulating gene expression and limits the activation of p53 by facilitating its de-methylation at Lysine 372. In human myeloid leukemia, low GFI1 levels correlate with an inferior prognosis. Here, we show that knockdown (KD) of Gfi1 in mice causes a fatal myeloproliferative disease (MPN) that could progress to leukemia after additional mutations. Both KO and KD mice accumulate myeloid cells that show signs of metabolic stress and high levels of reactive oxygen species. However, only KO cells have elevated levels of Lysine 372 methylated p53. This suggests that in contrast to absence of GFI1, KD of GFI1 leads to the accumulation of myeloid cells because sufficient amount of GFI1 is present to impede p53-mediated cell death, leading to a fatal MPN. The combination of myeloid accumulation and the ability to counteract p53 activity under metabolic stress could explain the role of reduced GF1 expression in human myeloid leukemia.
Atherosclerosis (AS) is a chronic inflammatory disease and endothelial cell injury is the initial event. In this study, we investigated the protective effects of ginsenoside F1 (GF1) on AS and the potential molecular mechanisms of ox-LDL induced endothelial injury. ApoE-/- mice were fed a high fat diet and orally treated with GF1 (50 mg/kg/day) for 8 weeks. Atherosclerotic plaque and LOX-1, TLR4, NF-κB expression levels in the aortic root and inflammatory factor MPO in whole body were measured. The treatment with GF1 induced a remarkable reduction in the atherosclerotic lesion area, LOX-1, TLR4 expression and decreased the MPO distribution. Meanwhile, in vitro study, we confirmed that GF1 treatment greatly increased ox-LDL-injured endothelial cell viability, ameliorated LOX-1, TLR4 expression levels and reduced monocytes adhesion. Protein microarray demonstrated that GF1 significantly inhibited G-CSF, ICAM-1, MIP-1δ, IL-1α, IL-15, IL-16 levels. Mechanistically, the GF1 treatment suppressed the NF-κB nuclear translocation. Furthermore, our data indicated that GF1 significantly increased A20 expression level and A20 siRNA markedly abolished the attenuation of GF1 on NF-κB nuclear translocation and inflammatory factors expression. Our results suggest that the GF1 may be a potential drug for anti-atherosclerosis.
Different asbestiform zeolite fibers of the erionite (termed GF1 and MD8, demonstrated carcinogenic) and offretite (termed BV12, suspected carcinogenic) families were investigated by analyzing the electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra of selected surfactant spin probes and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images in the presence of model membranes-cetyltrimethylammonium (CTAB) micelles, egg-lecithin liposomes, and dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine (DMPC) liposomes. This was undertaken to obtain information on interactions occurring at a molecular level between fibers and membranes which correlate with entrance of fibers into the membrane model or location of the fibers at the external or internal membrane interfaces. For CTAB micelles, all fibers were able to enter the micelles, but the hair-like structure and chemical surface characteristics of GF1 modified the micelle structure toward a bilayer-like organization, while MD8 and BV12, being shorter fibers and with a high density of surface interacting groups, partially destroyed the micelles. For liposomes, GF1 fibers partially penetrated the core solution, but DMPC liposomes showed increasing rigidity and organization of the bilayer. Conversely, for MD8 and BV12, the fibers did not cross the membrane demonstrating a smaller membrane structure perturbation. Scolecite fibers (termed SC1), used for comparison, presented poor interactions with the model membranes. The carcinogenicity of the zeolites, as postulated in the series SC1&lt;BV12&lt;MD8&lt;GF1, may be related to the structural modifications of the model membranes when interacting with these zeolite fibers.
Leishmaniasis is caused by protozoan parasites belonging to the genus Leishmania and includes cutaneous, mucocutaneous and visceral clinical forms. The drugs currently available for leishmaniasis treatment are pentavalent antimonials, amphotericin B and miltefosine, which present high toxicity, elevated cost and development of parasite resistance. The natural products constitute an important source of substances with leishmanicidal potential. Here we evaluated in vitro the anti-Leishmania amazonensis activity of crude extracts of branches, leaves and fruits of Guatteria latifolia. The branch extract (GCE) exhibited promising leishmanicidal activity against promastigotes (IC50 51.7 μg/ml), and was submitted to fractionation guided by in vitro assays. Among the seven subfractions obtained, GF1 and GF2 were the most actives against promastigotes with IC50 25.6 and 16 μg/ml, respectively. Since GCE, GF1 and GF2 were not toxic for macrophages, next, we tested their effect on intracellular amastigotes, and the IC50 values obtained were, respectively 30.5, 10.4 and 7.4 μg/ml, after 24 h treatment. The selectivity index for GCE, GF1 and GF2 were &gt;6.5, &gt;19.2 and &gt; 27, respectively. Additionally, GCE, GF1 and GF2 affected the division pattern of the promastigotes by increasing 6.7, 9.4 and 7-fold the cells in Sub-G0/G1 phase, and decreasing 1.6, 2.5 and 1.8-fold the cells in G0/G1 phase, respectively. To assess the GCE and GFs capacity to modulate microbicidal mechanisms of macrophages, nitric oxide (NO) and TNF-α production were tested. Our results indicated that at the IC50s GCE, GF1 and GF2 decreased NO production of infected macrophages stimulated with IFN-γ and LPS, besides, only GF1 decreased the production of TNF-α. Our data warrant further studies of GCE, GF1 and GF2 to identify active compounds against Leishmania parasites.
Halogenation of pharmaceutical molecules is a common tool to modify their physiological properties. The geometric, vibrational, and electronic properties of the ortho-fluorinated protonated neurotransmitter 2-phenylethylamine (oF-H+PEA) are characterized by infrared photodissociation (IRPD) spectroscopy in the NH stretch range using the messenger technique and dispersion-corrected density functional theory calculations at the B3LYP-D3/aug-cc-pVTZ level to elucidate the drastic effect of site-specific ortho-fluorination. The IRPD spectra of cold oF-H+PEA-Rg dimers (Rg = Ne, Ar) are assigned to the most stable gauche conformer (Gf1) of oF-H+PEA, which benefits from both NH+π and NH+F interactions. A minor contribution (∼5%) of the slightly less stable Gf2 gauche conformer (E0 = +1.1 kJ mol-1) is also identified. Comparison of oF-H+PEA with unsubstituted H+PEA reveals a much stronger NH+π interaction in H+PEA resulting in a large red shift of the bonded NH stretch frequency. This behavior is confirmed by natural bond orbital (NBO) analysis and noncovalent interaction (NCI) calculations. The Rg ligand prefers a binding site at which it can maximize the interaction with the aromatic π electron system and the ammonium group. Although the intermolecular interactions with the Rg atoms can compete with the noncovalent intramolecular bonds, they induce only minor spectral shifts in the NH stretch range.
The metal pollution has posed great risk on the coastal organisms along the Jiulongjiang Estuary in South China. In this work, two-dimensional electrophoresis-based proteomics was applied to the oysters Crassostrea hongkongensis from metal pollution sites to characterize the proteomic responses to metal pollution. Metal accumulation and proteomic responses indicated that the oysters from BJ site were more severely contaminated than those from FG site. Compared with those oyster samples from the clean site (JZ), metal pollution induced cellular injuries, oxidative and immune stresses in oyster heapatopancreas from both BJ and FG sites via differential metabolic pathways. In addition, metal pollution in BJ site induced disturbance in energy and lipid metabolisms in oysters. Results indicated that cathepsin L and ferritin GF1 might be the biomarkers of As and Fe in oyster C. hongkongensis, respectively. This study demonstrates that proteomics is a useful tool for investigating biological effects induced by metal pollution.
Objective of this study is to develop; tablet-in-a capsule system, to deliver Atenolol 25mg and Glyburide 5mg in the hard gelatin capsule. In order to improve patient compliance and reduce problems associated with complex therapeutic regimen Atenolol (cardio-selective beta-blocker) and Glyburide (anti-diabetic; sulfonylurea) are commonly, prescribed to the diabetic hypertensive patient. Metgod: In present work six different formulations of Atenolol (AF1-AF6) and Glyburide (GF1-GF6) were prepared by direct compression method using Avicel, Lactose DC, Crospovidone and Magnesium Stearate in different proportions and encapsulated in hard gelatin shells. Post compression parameters i.e. weight variation, diameter variation, thickness variation, hardness variation, % friability, disintegration, % drug release were determined at different pH 1.2, 4.5 and 6.8, and subjected to dissolution profile comparison through similarity factor (ƒ2).
Stability studies were performed and shelf lives were calculated by R-Gui Stab R console 2.15.2 and determined to be 15 and 27 months for Atenolol and Glyburide respectively. The percentage drug contents of Atenolol and Glyburide were estimated spectrophotometerically at 286 nm and 314.7 nm respectively. Formulations CF1-CF6 (encapsulated) were subjected to weight variation, disintegration and dissolution tests and subjected to model dependant analysis for dissolution studies. The simultaneous quantitation of Atenolol and Glyburide for content assay was done by HPLC method of analysis.
formulation CF6 is showing highest coefficient of correlation values for all models applied. So we can conclude that the proposed system can improve patient compliance by increasing the ease of administration of two drugs together.
In the present, using the characteristics of paddy rice at different phenophase to identify it by remote sensing images is an efficient way in the information extraction. According to the remarkably properties of paddy rice different from other vegetation, which the surface of paddy fields is with a large number of water in the early stage, NDWI (normalized difference water index) which is used to extract water information can reasonably be applied in the extraction of paddy rice at the early stage of the growth. And using NDWI ratio of two phenophase can expand the difference between paddy rice and other surface features, which is an important part for the extraction of paddy rice with high accuracy. Then using the variation of NDVI (normalized differential vegetation index) in different phenophase can further enhance accuracy of paddy rice information extraction. This study finds that making full advantage of the particularity of paddy rice in different phenophase and combining two indices (NDWI and NDVI) associated with paddy rice can establish a reasonable, accurate and effective extraction model of paddy rice. This is also the main way to improve the accuracy of paddy rice extraction. The present paper takes Lai'an in Anhui Province as the research area, and rice as the research object. It constructs the extraction model of paddy rice information using NDVI and NDWI between tillering stage and heading stage. Then the model was applied to GF1-WFV remote sensing image on July 12, 2013 and August 30, 2013. And it effectively extracted out of paddy rice distribution in Lai'an and carried on the mapping. At last, the result of extraction was verified and evaluated combined with field investigation data in the study area. The result shows that using the extraction model can quickly and accurately obtain the distribution of rice information, and it has the very good universality.
A great number of studies performed in the last 3 decades have shown the superior mechanical features of nickel-titanium files as compared with stainless steel files. A novel file system recently developed, Gentlefile, defies these findings and claims to have superior qualities despite the fact it is made from stainless steel.
Three file systems were used in this experiment: ProTaper Next (X1, X2, and X3), RevoS (SC2, SC3, and AS30), and Gentlefile (GF1, GF2, and GF3). Time to fracture, rotations to fracture, and vertical forces applied to a simulated root canal, which was fabricated from a metal block with a Plexiglas cover, were measured.
The GF system required significantly longer time and more rotations to fracture compared with the ProTaper and RevoS systems (P &lt; .001). The GF system applied significantly less vertical force to the canal in comparison with the ProTaper and RevoS systems (P &lt; .01).
Under the limitations of this study the GF system showed better mechanical properties in comparison with the ProTaper and RevoS systems. Further investigation is needed to assess the clinical meaning of these findings.
Erionite belonging to the zeolite family is a human health-hazard, since it was demonstrated to be carcinogenic. Conversely, offretite family zeolites were suspected carcinogenic. Mineralogical, morphological, chemical, and surface characterizations were performed on two erionites (GF1, MD8) and one offretite (BV12) fibrous samples and, for comparison, one scolecite (SC1) sample. The specific surface area analysis indicated a larger availability of surface sites for the adsorption onto GF1, while SC1 shows the lowest one and the presence of large pores in the poorly fibrous zeolite aggregates. Selected spin probes revealed a high adsorption capacity of GF1 compared to the other zeolites, but the polar/charged interacting sites were well distributed, intercalated by less polar sites (Si-O-Si). MD8 surface is less homogeneous and the polar/charged sites are more interacting and closer to each other compared to GF1. The interacting ability of BV12 surface is much lower than that found for GF1 and MD8 and the probes are trapped in small pores into the fibrous aggregates. In comparison with the other zeolites, the non-carcinogenic SC1 shows a poor interacting ability and a lower surface polarity. These results helped to clarify the chemical properties and the surface interacting ability of these zeolite fibers which may be related to their carcinogenicity. 
In considering the impact of inoculation time and the characteristics of composting material and inoculants on the usefulness of inoculation, a new composting strategy has been proposed and studied, in which three inocula were inoculated at three stages of composting process respectively: inoculum A (Thermoactinomyces sp. GF1 and GF2) was inoculated before fermentation to increase or maintain high temperature of pile, inoculum B (Coprinus cinerea and Coprinus comatus) was inoculated after thermophilic phase to promote degradation of lignin, and inoculum C (Trichoderma harzianum and Rhizopus oryzae) was inoculated after 30-day fermentation to promote degradation of cellulose. The results showed that the inoculations could significantly enhance the temperature of pile and the degradation of lignocelluloses. When inocula A, B, and C were inoculated into pile, temperature increased from 25°C to 65°C, from 33°C to 39°C and from 33°C to 38°C respectively and 35% lignin and 43% cellulose had been degraded in inoculated pile compared to the degradation of 15% lignin and 25% cellulose in control pile. As a result, the C/N ratio dropped more rapidly degraded in the inoculated pile (reached 20 after 33-day fermentation) than that in the control pile (reached 21.7 after 45-day fermentation). In addition, the volume loss in inoculated pile (76.5%) was higher than that in control pile (53.2%). The study, therefore, indicated that inoculating proper microorganisms at appropriate time improved the composting process and our new composting strategy would be propitious to the co-composting dairy manure with rice straw. 
Ginsenoside F1 (GF1) is a metabolite produced by hydrolysis of the ginsenoside Re and Rg1 in Panax ginseng. According to various studies, high amounts of ginseng components are absorbed in the metabolized form, which are key constituents responsible for the biological effects of P. ginseng. Recently, GF1 was reported to have beneficial effects on skin. However, there has not been a sound understanding of its antimelanogenic effect and underlying molecular mechanisms. In this study, GF1 reduced α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone-induced melanin secretion in B16F10 cell culture media by 60%. However, it did not suppress intracellular melanin levels, tyrosinase activity and expression. Immunofluorescence assay showed that GF1 had no effect on melanosome transport, but significantly induced dendrite retraction. Pull-down assay demonstrated that GF1 primarily modulates the Rho family GTPases resulting in dendrite retraction. Collectively, these data suggest that GF1 could act as a potent skin-whitening agent. 
Recent advances in molecular biology have greatly accelerated knowledge relating to the significance of the enterohepatic circulation of bile salts. This review highlights the role that both oxysterols and bile salts play as ligands which, when bound to nuclear hormone receptors, activate transcription factors that set into play feed-forward catabolism of cholesterol to bile salts and feedback control of bile acid synthesis. The nuclear hormone receptors, liver X receptor (LXR) and farnesoid X receptor (FXR) both combined as heterodimers with retinoid X receptor and with oxysterols and bile salts, respectively as their ligands, initiate powerful genetic controls over cholesterol and bile acid homeostatic mechanisms. LXR/RXR signals molecular control of feed-forward catabolism of cholesterol to bile acids while FXR/RXR initiates feedback control of bile acid synthesis. An additional nuclear hormone receptor, small heterodimer partner (SHP), is required to inhibit the competence factor, liver receptor homolog-1 to achieve repression of bile acid synthesis in the liver and in so doing SHP autoregulates its own function. Additionally, while bile acid synthesis is repressed, pool size is preserved by the action of FXR/RXR at both hepatic and intestinal levels, which genetically signals enhanced hepatocyte bile salt transport by the bile salt export pump (BSEP) and the ileal bile acid binding protein (IBABP) for ileal reabsorption. During activation of cholesterol catabolism, LXR/RXR enhances reverse cholesterol transport by increasing cholesterol efflux via the ABC-1 transporter from extrahepatic cells. This cholesterol is then taken up by high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and transported back to the liver for further cholesterol catabolism and elimination in bile. The genetic coordination of nuclear hormone receptor function within the territory of the enterohepatic of bile salts allows for normal cholesterol and bile acid homeostasis thereby preventing atherosclerosis.
Induction of the differentiation of human leukemia cells is a useful strategy in treatment of human leukemia. However, the molecular mechanisms involved in leukemia cell differentiation have not been fully elucidated. Interleukin 6 (IL-6) is a pleiotropic cytokine acting on a variety of cell types, and plays important roles in hematopoiesis. GATA binding protein 1 (GATA-1) is an important transcription factor involved in either megakaryocytic or erythrocytic differentiation. Herein we report that Rab7b, a late endosome/lysosome-localized myeloid small GTPase, promotes phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA)-induced megakaryocytic differentiation by increasing nuclear factor κB (NF-κB)-dependent IL-6 production and subsequently enhancing the association of activated signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) with GATA-1. By using PMA-induced megakaryocytic differentiation of leukemia cells as a model, we investigated the roles of Rab7b in megakaryocytic differentiation. We find that Rab7b can potentiate PMA-induced upregulation of megakaryocytic markers, production of IL-6, and activation of NF-κB. Inhibitor of NF-κB and neutralizing antibodies for IL-6 or the IL-6 signaling receptor gp130 can block the effects of Rab7b in megakaryocytic differentiation. In Rab7b-silenced cells, PMA-induced activation of NF-κB, IL-6 production, and megakaryocytic differentiation are impaired. Furthermore, we demonstrate that IL-6-induced activation of STAT3 and the subsequent association of STAT3 with GATA-1 may contribute to PMA-induced and Rab7b-mediated transcriptional upregulation of megakaryocytic differentiation markers. Therefore, our data suggest that Rab7b may play important roles in megakaryopoiesis by activating NF-κB and promoting IL-6 production. Our study also indicates that the IL-6-induced association of STAT3 with GATA-1 may regulate megakaryocytic differentiation.
The murine delayed-early serum-responsive gene T1 encodes glycoproteins of the interleukin-1 receptor family. Transcriptional initiation in fibroblasts is regulated by c-Fos and gives rise to a rare 5-kb mRNA and an abundant 2.7-kb mRNA. These transcripts are translated into a receptor-like membrane-anchored protein and a secreted protein consisting only of the ectodomain. In mast cells, T1 gene transcription is initiated 10.5 kb further upstream than in fibroblasts and gives rise predominantly to the 5-kb transcript under normal growth conditions. Here we demonstrate that calcium ionophore stimulation of mast cells resulted in an upregulation of T1 gene expression and a switch from the long to the short T1 transcript. This was paralleled by the disappearance of the receptor-type T1 protein on the mast cell surface and the secretion of large amounts of the truncated T1 protein. c-Fos and a T1 enhancer, which have previously been identified to be essential for T1 expression in fibroblasts, were not required for calcium ionophore-mediated T1 gene upregulation. Overexpression of the transcription factor GATA-1 in mast cells caused elevated T1 synthesis. Three GATA elements were identified in the minimal GATA-responsive mast cell promoter. Mutational analysis revealed that all three GATA elements are involved in T1 gene expression. Point mutations within the middle GATA element eliminated promoter activity completely, while mutations of the distal and proximal GATA binding sites reduced promoter strength by factors of 2 and 5, respectively. Exogenous expression of GATA-1 was not sufficient to activate the mast cell-specific promoter in NIH 3T3 fibroblasts.
Although thyroid hormone is a known stimulator of erythropoietic differentiation, severe anemia is sometimes observed in patients with hyperthyroidism and this mechanism is not fully understood. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of triiodothyronine (T3) on hemin-induced erythropoiesis. Human erythroleukemia K562 cells were used as an erythroid differentiation model. Cell differentiation was induced by hemin and the effect of pre-incubation with T3 (0.1 to 100 nM) was analyzed by measuring the benzidine-positive rate, hemoglobin content, CD71 expression (transferrin receptor), and mRNA expression for transcription factors related to erythropoiesis and thyroid hormone receptors (TRs). Hemin, a promoter of erythroid differentiation, increased the levels of mRNAs for TRα, TRβ, and retinoid X receptor α (RXRα), as well as those for nuclear factor-erythroid 2 (NFE2), GATA-binding protein 1 (GATA1) and GATA-binding protein 2 (GATA2). Lower concentrations of T3 had a stimulatory effect on hemin-induced hemoglobin production (1 and 10 nM), CD71 expression (0.1 nM), and α-globin mRNA expression (1 nM), while a higher concentration of T3 (100 nM) abrogated the stimulatory effect on these parameters. T3 at 100 nM did not affect cell viability and proliferation, suggesting that the abrogation of erythropoiesis enhancement was not due to toxicity. T3 at 100 nM also significantly inhibited expression of GATA2 and RXRα mRNA, compared to 1 nM T3. We conclude that a high concentration of T3 attenuates the classical stimulatory effect on erythropoiesis exerted by a low concentration of T3 in hemin-induced K562 cells. 
The zebrafish, Danio rerio, is a powerful model for the study of erythropoiesis and defining the genetic basis of hematological diseases. The mechanisms of erythroid differentiation are highly conserved in the zebrafish, permitting translational research studies and the modeling of erythropoiesis in higher vertebrates. An advantage of the system is the ability to manipulate gene expression and observe the effect on erythroid development in vivo, with relative ease and rapidity. The production of optically transparent embryos also makes it an attractive tool for visual analysis of circulating erythrocytes that can be used to study erythropoiesis. Through large-scale chemical mutagenesis screens, a variety of zebrafish blood mutants have been identified that are used for gene discoveries and the recapitulation of human diseases. Experimental techniques including in situ hybridization, o-dianisidine staining, flow cytometry, and microinjection are now commonly employed to study red blood cell biochemistry and erythropoiesis in the zebrafish. These techniques have been applied for identifying novel genes required for the hemoglobin synthesis, isolating blood cell lineages, visualizing genetic expression within erythroid tissues, and characterizing the phenotype of blood disorders. The applications of zebrafish methodology to the study of erythropoiesis and optimized step-by-step protocols are discussed in this chapter.
The Sox6 transcription factor is crucial for terminal maturation of definitive red blood cells. Sox6-null mouse fetuses present misshapen and nucleated erythrocytes, due to impaired actin assembly and cytoskeleton stability. These defects are accompanied with a reduced survival of Sox6-/- red blood cells, resulting in a compensated anemia. Sox6-overexpression in K562 cells and in human primary ex vivo erythroid cultures enhances erythroid differentiation and leads to hemoglobinization, the hallmark of erythroid maturation. To obtain an overview on processes downstream to Sox6 expression, we performed a differential proteomic analysis on human erythroid K562 cells overexpressing Sox6. Sox6-overexpression induces dysregulation of 64 proteins, involved in cytoskeleton remodeling and in protein synthesis, folding and trafficking, key processes for erythroid maturation. Moreover, 43 out of 64 genes encoding for differentially expressed proteins contain within their proximal regulatory regions sites that are bound by SOX6 according to ENCODE ChIP-seq datasets and are possible direct SOX6 targets. SAR1B, one of the most induced proteins upon Sox6 overexpression, shares a conserved regulatory module, composed by a double SOX6 binding site and a GATA1 consensus, with the adjacent SEC24 A gene. Since both genes encode for COPII components, this element could concur to the coordinated expression of these proteins during erythropoiesis.
Hematopoietic differentiation is controlled by key transcription factors, which regulate stem cell functions and differentiation. TAL1 is a central transcription factor for hematopoietic stem cell development in the embryo and for gene regulation during erythroid/megakaryocytic differentiation. Knowledge of the target genes controlled by a given transcription factor is important to understand its contribution to normal development and disease. To uncover direct target genes of TAL1 we used high affinity streptavidin/biotin-based chromatin precipitation (Strep-CP) followed by Strep-CP on ChIP analysis using ChIP promoter arrays. We identified 451 TAL1 target genes in K562 cells. Furthermore, we analysed the regulation of one of these genes, the catalytic subunit beta of protein kinase A (PRKACB), during megakaryopoiesis of K562 and primary human CD34+ stem cell/progenitor cells. We found that TAL1 together with hematopoietic transcription factors RUNX1 and GATA1 binds to the promoter of the isoform 3 of PRKACB (Cβ3). During megakaryocytic differentiation a coactivator complex on the Cβ3 promoter, which includes WDR5 and p300, is replaced with a corepressor complex. In this manner, activating chromatin modifications are removed and expression of the PRKACB-Cβ3 isoform during megakaryocytic differentiation is reduced. Our data uncover a role of the TAL1 complex in controlling differential isoform expression of PRKACB. These results reveal a novel function of TAL1, RUNX1 and GATA1 in the transcriptional control of protein kinase A activity, with implications for cellular signalling control during differentiation and disease.
Erythroid differentiation is a complex and multistep process during which an adequate supply of iron for hemoglobinization is required. The role of ferritin heavy subunit, in this process, has been mainly attributed to its capacity to maintain iron in a non-toxic form. We propose a new role for ferritin heavy subunit (FHC) in controlling the erythroid commitment of K562 erythro-myeloid cells. FHC knockdown induces a change in the balance of GATA transcription factors and significantly reduces the expression of a repertoire of erythroid-specific genes, including α- and γ-globins, as well as CD71 and CD235a surface markers, in the absence of differentiation stimuli. These molecular changes are also reflected at the morphological level. Moreover, the ability of FHC-silenced K562 cells to respond to the erythroid-specific inducer hemin is almost completely abolished. Interestingly, we found that this new role for FHC is largely mediated via regulation of miR-150, one of the main microRNA implicated in the cell-fate choice of common erythroid/megakaryocytic progenitors. These findings shed further insight into the biological properties of FHCand delineate a role in erythroid differentiation where this protein does not act as a mere iron metabolism-related factor but also as a critical regulator of the expression of genes of central relevance for erythropoiesis.
As the main component of traditional Chinese medicine realgar, arsenic disulfide (As2S2) is widely used in treating myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). The goal of the current study is to assess the effects of As2S2 on bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMMNC) of MDS.
BMMNCs were obtained from 10 lower risk MDS patients, 5 higher risk MDS patients, and 3 healthy controls. Then, the cells were treated with As2S2 for 48h, using vorinostat (also known as SAHA) as control. Cell proliferation and apoptosis were detected. mRNA and protein levels of histone deacetylase-1 (HDAC1), Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2), and erythroid transcription factor (GATA-1) were detected by quantitative real-time PCR and western blot analysis.
After As2S2 treatment in concentrations ranging from 3.125 to 100μmol/L, cell proliferation was inhibited in both lower risk and higher risk MDS. Fifty percent inhibitory concentrations were 24.4μmol/L and 23.6μmol/L, respectively, for lower and higher risk MDS. Apoptotic cells significantly increased in both types of MDS. mRNA and protein levels of HDAC1 and TLR2 were reduced, whereas GATA-1 was increased in both types of MDS.
As2S2 could inhibit cell proliferation and induce apoptosis through histone acetylation modulation in MDS. Similar to SAHA, As2S2 could reduce TLR2 activation and increase GATA-1 expression. Current data suggest epigenetic and immunological alternations are involved in therapeutic mechanisms of realgar in the treatment of MDS.
Using high-throughput small molecule screening targeting furin gene, we identified that phorbol esters dPPA (12-Deoxyphorbol 13-phenylacetate 20-acetate) and dPA (12-Deoxyphorbol 13-acetate) significantly increased furin protein and mRNA expression in SH-SY5Y cells. This effect was prevented by PKC (protein kinase C) inhibitor calphostin C but not Ro318220, suggesting that the C1 domain, rather than the catalytic domain of PKC plays an important role. Luciferase assay revealed that nucleotides -7925 to -7426 were sufficient to mediate dPPA/dPA enhancement of furin P1 promoter activity. RNA interference of transcriptional factors CEBPβ (CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein β) and GATA1 revealed that knockdown of CEBPβ significantly attenuated the effect of dPPA on furin expression. Pharmacological inhibition of ERK and PI3K but not TGFβ receptor diminished the up-regulation of furin by dPPA. These results suggested that in neuronal cells, transcriptional activation of furin by dPPA/dPA may be initiated by C1 domain containing proteins including PKC; the intracellular signaling involves ERK and PI3K and transcription factor CEBPβ.
Eosinophilic pancreatitis (EP) is reported in humans; however, the etiology and role of eosinophils in EP pathogenesis are poorly understood and not well explored. Therefore, it is interesting to examine the role of eosinophils in the initiation and progression of pancreatitis pathogenesis. Accordingly, we performed anti-major basic protein immunostaining, chloroacetate esterase, and Masson's trichrome analyses to detect eosinophils, mast cells, and collagen in the tissue sections of mouse and human pancreas. Induced eosinophils accumulation and degranulation were observed in the tissue sections of human pancreatitis, compared with no eosinophils in the normal pancreatic tissue sections. Similarly, we observed induced tissue eosinophilia along with mast cells and acinar cells atrophy in cerulein-induced mouse model of chronic pancreatitis. Additionally, qPCR and ELISA analyses detected induced transcript and protein levels of proinflammatory and profibrotic cytokines, chemokines like IL 5, IL-18, eotaxin-1, eotaxin-2, TGF-β1, collagen-1, collagen-3, fibronectin, and α-SMA in experimental pancreatitis. Mechanistically, we show that eosinophil-deficient GATA1 and endogenous IL-5-deficient mice were protected from the induction of proinflammatory and profibrotic cytokines, chemokines, tissue eosinophilia, and mast cells in a cerulein-induced murine model of pancreatitis. These human and experimental data indicate that eosinophil accumulation and degranulation may have a critical role in promoting pancreatitis pathogenesis including fibrosis. Taken together, eosinophil tissue accumulation needs appropriate attention to understand and restrict the progression of pancreatitis pathogenesis in humans. NEW &amp; NOTEWORTHY The present study for the first time shows that eosinophils accumulate in the pancreas and promote disease pathogenesis, including fibrosis in earlier reported cerulein-induced experimental models of pancreatitis. Importantly, we show that GATA-1 and IL-5 deficiency protects mice form the induction of eosinophil active chemokines, and profibrotic cytokines, including accumulation of tissue collagen in an experimental model of pancreatitis. Additionally, we state that cerulein-induced chronic pancreatitis is independent of blood eosinophilia.
Patients with mutations of the THRA gene exhibit classical features of hypothyroidism, including erythroid disorders. We previously created a mutant mouse expressing a mutated TRα1 (denoted as PV; Thra1PV/+ mouse) that faithfully reproduces the classical hypothyroidism seen in patients. Using Thra1PV/+ mice, we explored how the TRα1PV mutant acted to cause abnormalities in erythropoiesis. Thra1PV/+ mice exhibited abnormal red blood cell indices similarly as reported for patients. The total bone marrow cells and erythrocytic progenitors were markedly reduced in the bone marrow of Thra1PV/+ mice. In vitro terminal differentiation assays showed a significant reduction of mature erythrocytes in Thra1PV/+ mice. In wild-type mice, the clonogenic potential of progenitors in the erythrocytic lineage was stimulated by thyroid hormone (T3), suggesting that T3 could directly accelerate the differentiation of progenitors to mature erythrocytes. Analysis of gene expression profiles showed that the key regulator of erythropoiesis, the Gata-1 gene, and its regulated genes, such as the Klf1, β-globin, dematin genes, CAII, band3 and eALAS genes, involved in the maturation of erythrocytes, was decreased in the bone marrow cells of Thra1PV/+ mice. We further elucidated that the Gata-1 gene was a T3-directly regulated gene and that TRα1PV could impair erythropoiesis via repression of the Gata-1 gene and its regulated genes. These results provide new insights into how TRα1 mutants acted to cause erythroid abnormalities in patients with mutations of the THRA gene. Importantly, the Thra1PV/+ mouse could serve as a preclinical mouse model to identify novel molecular targets for treatment of erythroid disorders.
Members of the GATA‑binding factor protein family, including GATA1, GATA2 and GATA3, serve an inhibiting role in leukemia. The present study demonstrated that GATA4 was upregulated in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Results from a number of functional experiments, including cell proliferation analysis, cell cycle analysis, cell apoptosis assay and Transwell migration and invasion analyses, have suggested that high expression of GATA4 may facilitate proliferation and metastasis, and suppress apoptosis in ALL cells. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay and luciferase reporter assay revealed that GATA4 was a transcription factor that activated mouse double minute 2 homolog (MDM2) and B cell lymphoma 2 (BCL2) expression in ALL cells. BCL2 is a key anti‑apoptosis protein that was demonstrated to suppress cell apoptosis. In addition, GATA4 was revealed to regulate p53 through the transcriptional activation of MDM2, subsequently influencing cell cycle and apoptosis. Results from the present study suggested that GATA4 may be a key marker in ALL diagnosis and a potential target of molecular therapy.
Six2 (Sine oculis homeobox 2), a homeodomain transcription factor, plays a crucial role in the regulation of mammalian nephrogenesis. It is also implicated in numerous biological functions, such as cell proliferation, apoptosis, and migration. However, the underlying regulatory mechanisms of Six2 remain largely unknown. In this study, we predicted that CRX, GATA1, HOXD8, and POU2F2 might target, binding to the promoter region of Six2 (~2000 bp) by bioinformatics analysis. Among the four genes, the predicted binding sequence of GATA1 is most highly conserved across species. Luciferase assays demonstrated that knockdown of GATA1 decreased the activity of Six2 promoter and qPCR result of Six2 expression was in consistent with this in 293T cells. Mutation of GATA1 binding sites of mSix2 promoter led to obvious decrease of the mSix2 promoter activity. Furthermore, knockdown of GATA1 decreased Six2 expression in mk3 cells and increased cell apoptosis of mk3 and mk4 compared with corresponding control cells, but this up-regulation can be rescued by Six2 overexpression. Our findings indicated that GATA1 may be a potential regulator of Six2-maintained population of nephron progenitor cells.
Experimental data indicate that FOXP3+ Tregs can markedly curtail host antitumor immune responses, but the properties of human intratumoral Tregs are still largely unknown, in part due to significant methodologic problems. We studied the phenotypic, functional, epigenetic, and transcriptional features of Tregs in 92 patients with non-small-cell lung cancer, comparing the features of Tregs within tumors versus corresponding blood, lung, and lymph node samples. Intratumoral Treg numbers and suppressive function were significantly increased compared with all other sites but did not display a distinctive phenotype by flow cytometry. However, by undertaking simultaneous evaluation of mRNA and protein expression at the single-cell level, we demonstrated that tumor Tregs have a phenotype characterized by upregulated expression of FOXP3 mRNA and protein as well as significantly increased expression of EOS, IRF4, SATB1, and GATA1 transcription factor mRNAs. Expression of these "Treg-locking" transcription factors was positively correlated with levels of FOXP3 mRNA, with highest correlations for EOS and SATB1. EOS had an additional, FOXP3 mRNA-independent, positive correlation with FOXP3 protein in tumor Tregs. Our study identifies distinctive features of intratumoral Tregs and suggests that targeting Treg-locking transcription factors, especially EOS, may be of clinical importance for antitumor Treg-based therapy.
During vertebrate embryogenesis, vascular endothelial cells (ECs) and primitive erythrocytes become specified within close proximity in the posterior lateral plate mesoderm (LPM) from a common progenitor. However, the signaling cascades regulating the specification into either lineage remain largely elusive. Here, we analyze the contribution of β-catenin dependent Wnt signaling to EC and erythrocyte specification during zebrafish embryogenesis. We generated novel β-catenin dependent Wnt signaling reporters which, by using destabilized fluorophores (Venus-Pest, dGFP), specifically allow us to detect Wnt signaling responses in narrow time windows as well as in spatially restricted domains, defined by Cre recombinase expression (Tg(axin2BAC:Venus-Pest)mu288; Tg(14TCF:loxP-STOP-loxP-dGFP)mu202). We therefore can detect β-catenin dependent Wnt signaling activity in a subset of the Fli1a-positive progenitor population. Additionally, we show that mesodermal Wnt3a-mediated signaling via the transcription factor Lef1 positively regulates EC specification (defined by kdrl expression) at the expense of primitive erythrocyte specification (defined by gata1 expression) in zebrafish embryos. Using mesoderm derived from human embryonic stem cells, we identified the same principle of Wnt signaling dependent EC specification in conjunction with auto-upregulation of LEF1. Our data indicate a novel role of β-catenin dependent Wnt signaling in regulating EC specification during vasculogenesis.
Erythropoietin (EPO) acts through the dimeric erythropoietin receptor to stimulate proliferation, survival, differentiation and enucleation of erythroid progenitor cells. We undertook two complimentary approaches to find EPO-dependent pSTAT5 target genes in murine erythroid cells: RNA-seq of newly transcribed (4sU-labelled) RNA, and ChIP-seq for pSTAT5 30 minutes after EPO stimulation. We found 302 pSTAT5-occupied sites: ~15% of these reside in promoters while the rest reside within intronic enhancers or intergenic regions, some &gt;100kb from the nearest TSS. The majority of pSTAT5 peaks contain a central palindromic GAS element, TTCYXRGAA. There was significant enrichment for GATA motifs and CACCC-box motifs within the neighbourhood of pSTAT5-bound peaks, and GATA1 and/or KLF1 co-occupancy at many sites. Using 4sU-RNA-seq we determined the EPO-induced transcriptome and validated differentially expressed genes using dynamic CAGE data and qRT-PCR. We identified known direct pSTAT5 target genes such as Bcl2l1, Pim1 and Cish, and many new targets likely to be involved in driving erythroid cell differentiation including those involved in mRNA splicing (Rbm25), epigenetic regulation (Suv420h2), and EpoR turnover (Clint1/EpsinR). Some of these new EpoR-JAK2-pSTAT5 target genes could be used as biomarkers for monitoring disease activity in polycythaemia vera, and for monitoring responses to JAK inhibitors.
Human endogenous retroviruses (HERVs) and other long terminal repeat (LTR)-type retrotransposons (HERV/LTRs) have regulatory elements that possibly influence the transcription of host genes. We systematically identified and characterized these regulatory elements based on publicly available datasets of ChIP-Seq of 97 transcription factors (TFs) provided by ENCODE and Roadmap Epigenomics projects. We determined transcription factor-binding sites (TFBSs) using the ChIP-Seq datasets and identified TFBSs observed on HERV/LTR sequences (HERV-TFBSs). Overall, 794,972 HERV-TFBSs were identified. Subsequently, we identified "HERV/LTR-shared regulatory element (HSRE)," defined as a TF-binding motif in HERV-TFBSs, shared within a substantial fraction of a HERV/LTR type. HSREs could be an indication that the regulatory elements of HERV/LTRs are present before their insertions. We identified 2,201 HSREs, comprising specific associations of 354 HERV/LTRs and 84 TFs. Clustering analysis showed that HERV/LTRs can be grouped according to the TF binding patterns; HERV/LTR groups bounded to pluripotent TFs (e.g., SOX2, POU5F1, and NANOG), embryonic endoderm/mesendoderm TFs (e.g., GATA4/6, SOX17, and FOXA1/2), hematopoietic TFs (e.g., SPI1 (PU1), GATA1/2, and TAL1), and CTCF were identified. Regulatory elements of HERV/LTRs tended to locate nearby and/or interact three-dimensionally with the genes involved in immune responses, indicating that the regulatory elements play an important role in controlling the immune regulatory network. Further, we demonstrated subgroup-specific TF binding within LTR7, LTR5B, and LTR5_Hs, indicating that gains or losses of the regulatory elements occurred during genomic invasions of the HERV/LTRs. Finally, we constructed dbHERV-REs, an interactive database of HERV/LTR regulatory elements (http://herv-tfbs.com/). This study provides fundamental information in understanding the impact of HERV/LTRs on host transcription, and offers insights into the transcriptional modulation systems of HERV/LTRs and ancestral HERVs.
Myelofibrosis (MF) is characterized by hyperactivation of thrombopoietin (TPO) signaling, which induces a RPS14 deficiency that de-regulates GATA1 in megakaryocytes by hampering its mRNA translation. As mice carrying the hypomorphic Gata1low mutation, which reduces the levels of Gata1 mRNA in megakaryocytes, develop MF, we investigated whether the TPO axis is hyperactive in this model. Gata1low mice contained two times more Tpo mRNA in liver and TPO in plasma than wild-type littermates. Furthermore, Gata1low LSKs expressed levels of Mpl mRNA (five times greater than normal) and protein (two times lower than normal) similar to those expressed by LSKs from TPO-treated wild-type mice. Gata1low marrow and spleen contained more JAK2/STAT5 than wild-type tissues, an indication that these organs were reach of TPO-responsive cells. Moreover, treatment of Gata1low mice with the JAK inhibitor ruxolitinib reduced their splenomegaly. Also in Gata1low mice activation of the TPO/MPL axis was associated with a RSP14 deficiency and a discordant microarray ribosome signature (reduced RPS24, RPS26 and SBDS expression). Finally, electron microscopy revealed that Gata1low megakaryocytes contained poorly developed endoplasmic reticulum with rare polysomes. In summary, Gata1low mice are a bona fide model of MF, which recapitulates the hyperactivation of the TPO/MPL/JAK2 axis observed in megakaryocytes from myelofibrotic patients.
Interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF-3) is widely known for its prompt response against viral infection by activating the interferon system. We previously reported that E2F1, Sp1 and Sp3 regulated transcriptional activity of IRF-3. Recently, different expression patterns of IRF-3 were found in lung cancer, leading to the alternation of the immunomodulatory function in tumorigenesis. However, the mechanism of transcriptional regulation of IRF-3 in lung cancer has not been extensively studied. Here, we investigated the characterization of IRF-3 promoter and found that GATA-1 bound to a specific domain of IRF-3 promoter in vitro and in vivo. We found elevated IRF-3 and decreased GATA-1 gene expression in lung adenocarcinoma in Oncomine database. Additionally, higher IRF-3 gene expression was observed in human lung adenocarcinoma, accompanied by aberrant GATA-1 protein expression. We further analyzed the relationship of GATA-1 and IRF-3 expression in lung adenocarcinoma cell lines and found that inhibition of GATA-1 by siRNA increased the promoter activity, mRNA and protein levels of IRF-3, while over-expression of GATA-1 down-regulated IRF-3 gene expression. Taken together, we conclude that reduced GATA-1 could be responsible for the upregulation of IRF-3 in lung adenocarcinoma cells through binding with a specific domain of IRF-3 promoter.
Heme is required for survival of all cells, and in most eukaryotes, is produced through a series of eight enzymatic reactions. Although heme production is critical for many cellular processes, how it is coupled to cellular differentiation is unknown. Here, using zebrafish, murine, and human models, we show that erythropoietin (EPO) signaling, together with the GATA1 transcriptional target, AKAP10, regulates heme biosynthesis during erythropoiesis at the outer mitochondrial membrane. This integrated pathway culminates with the direct phosphorylation of the crucial heme biosynthetic enzyme, ferrochelatase (FECH) by protein kinase A (PKA). Biochemical, pharmacological, and genetic inhibition of this signaling pathway result in a block in hemoglobin production and concomitant intracellular accumulation of protoporphyrin intermediates. Broadly, our results implicate aberrant PKA signaling in the pathogenesis of hematologic diseases. We propose a unifying model in which the erythroid transcriptional program works in concert with post-translational mechanisms to regulate heme metabolism during normal development.
Catechol is one of phenolic metabolites of benzene that is a general occupational hazard and a ubiquitous environmental air pollutant. Catechol also occurs naturally in fruits, vegetables and cigarettes. Previous studies have revealed that 72h exposure to catechol improved hemin-induced erythroid differentiation of K562 cells accompanied with elevated methylation in erythroid specific genes. In present study, K562 cells were treated with 0, 10 or 20μM catechol for 1-4weeks, hemin-induced hemoglobin synthesis increased in a concentration- and time-dependent manner and the enhanced hemoglobin synthesis was relatively stable. The mRNA expression of α-, β- and γ-globin genes, erythroid heme synthesis enzymes PBGD and ALAS2, transcription factor GATA-1 and NF-E2 showed a significant increase in K562 cells exposed to 20μM catechol for 3w, and catechol enhanced hemin-induced mRNA expression of these genes. Quantitative MassARRAY methylation analysis also confirmed that the exposure to catechol changed DNA methylation levels at several CpG sites in several erythroid-specific genes and their far upstream of regulatory elements. These results demonstrated that long-term exposure to low concentration of catechol enhanced the hemin-induced erythroid differentiation of K562 cells, in which DNA methylation played a role by up-regulating erythroid specific genes.
More than 60% of myeloid dysplasia syndrome (MDS) contains mutations in genes encoding for splicing factors such as SF3B1, U2AF, SRSF2 and ZRSR2. Mutations in SF3B1 are associated with 80% cases of refractory anemia with ring sideroblast (RARS), a subtype of MDS. SF3B1K700E is the most frequently mutated site among mutations on SF3B1. Yet the molecular mechanisms on how mutations of splicing factors lead to defective erythropoiesis are not clear. SF3B1K700E mutant binds to an RNA binding protein, RBM15, stronger than the wild type SF3B1 protein in co-immunoprecipitation assays. In addition, K700E mutant alters the RNA splicing of transcription factors TAL1 and GATA1. Via alternative RNA splicing, a novel short TAL1 transcript variant (TAL1s) is generated. Enhanced interaction between SF3B1 and RBM15 promotes the production of full-length TAL1 (TAL1fl) mRNA, while reduction of RBM15 protein level via PRMT1-mediated degradation pathway changes TAL1s/TAL1fl ratio in favor of TAL1s. TAL1s contains the helix-loop-helix DNA binding domain but not the N terminal region upstream of the DNA binding domain. The TAL1s protein loses its interaction with ETO2, which represses early erythropoiesis. In this vein, overexpression of TAL1s stimulates the transcription of β-hemoglobin in human leukemia K562 cells and promotes erythroid differentiation of human cord blood CD34+ cells cultured in erythropoietin-containing medium. Therefore, mutations of SF3B1 may block erythropoiesis via dysregulation of alternative RNA splicing of transcription factor TAL1, and targeting PRMT1 may alleviate the anemic symptoms in MDS patients.
Stimulator of Interferon Gene (STING) is a key mediator of innate immune signaling. STING plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of many diseases including infectious diseases, auto-immune diseases and cancer. Many studies have been carried out recently in the field of STING-regulated pathway, however, rarely of transcriptional mechanisms. To characterize the murine STING (mSTING) promoter, we cloned a series of different nucleotide sequences of the 5'-flanking region of the mSTING gene. Transient transfection of promoter-reporter recombinant plasmids and luciferase assay illustrated the region (-77/+177) relative to the transcription start site (TSS) of the mSTING gene was sufficient for full promoter activity. This region contains GATA1, IK2, Sp1/Sp3 and STAT putative transcription factor binding sites. Mutation of GATA1 or Sp1/Sp3 sites led to obvious decrease of the mSTING promoter activity. Overexpression of GATA1 and Sp3 enhanced the mSTING promoter activity, whereas knockdown of GATA1 and Sp3 by a siRNA strategy significantly reduced the transcription activity. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated that GATA1 and Sp3 interact with the mSTING promoter in vivo. These results provided the first analysis of mSTING promoter and demonstrated that transcription factor GATA1 and Sp3 positively regulate the basal transcription of the mSTING gene.
To investigate the potential efficacy of panaxadiol saponins component (PDS-C), a biologically active fraction isolated from total ginsenosides, to reverse chemotherapy-induced myelosuppression and pancytopenia caused by cyclophamide (CTX).
Mice with myelosuppression induced by CTX were treated with PDS-C at a low- (20 mg/kg), moderate- (40 mg/kg), or high-dose (80 mg/kg) for 7 consecutive days. The level of peripheral white blood cell (WBC), neutrophil (NEU) and platelet (PLT) were measured, the histopathology and colony formation were observed, the protein kinase and transcription factors in hematopoietic cells were determined by immunohistochemical staining and Western blot.
In response to PDS-C therapy, the peripheral WBC, NEU and PLT counts of CTX-induced myelosuppressed mice were significantly increased in a dose-dependent manner. Similarly, bone marrow histopathology examination showed reversal of CTX-induced myelosuppression with increase in overall bone marrow cellularity and the number of hematopoietic cells (P&lt;0.01). PDS-C also promoted proliferation of granulocytic and megakaryocyte progenitor cells in CTX-treated mice, as evidenced by significantly increase in colony formation units-granulocytes/monocytes and -megakaryocytes (P&lt;0.01). The enhancement of hematopoiesis by PDS-C appears to be mediated by an intracellular signaling pathway, this was evidenced by the up-regulation of phosphorylated mitogen-activated protein kinase (p-MEK) and extracellular signal-regulated kinases (p-ERK), and receptor tyrosine kinase (C-kit) and globin transcription factor 1 (GATA-1) in hematopoietic cells of CTX-treated mice (P&lt;0.05).
PDS-C possesses hematopoietic growth factor-like activities that promote proliferation and also possibly differentiation of hematopoietic progenitor cells in myelosuppressed mice, probably mediated by a mechanism involving MEK and ERK protein kinases, and C-kit and GATA-1 transcription factors. PDS-C may potentially be a novel treatment of myelosuppression and pancytopenia caused by chemotherapy.
Acute basophilic leukaemia (ABL) is a rare subtype of acute myeloblastic leukaemia. We previously described a recurrent t(X;6)(p11;q23) translocation generating an MYB-GATA1 fusion gene in male infants with ABL. To better understand its role, the chimeric MYB-GATA1 transcription factor was expressed in CD34-positive haematopoietic progenitors, which were transplanted into immunodeficient mice. Cells expressing MYB-GATA1 showed increased expression of markers of immaturity (CD34), of granulocytic lineage (CD33 and CD117), and of basophilic differentiation (CD203c and FcϵRI). UT-7 cells also showed basophilic differentiation after MYB-GATA1 transfection. A transcriptomic study identified nine genes deregulated by both MYB-GATA1 and basophilic differentiation. Induction of three of these genes (CCL23, IL1RL1, and NTRK1) was confirmed in MYB-GATA1-expressing CD34-positive cells by reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Interleukin (IL)-33 and nerve growth factor (NGF), the ligands of IL-1 receptor-like 1 (IL1RL1) and neurotrophic receptor tyrosine kinase 1 (NTRK1), respectively, enhanced the basophilic differentiation of MYB-GATA1-expressing UT-7 cells, thus demonstrating the importance of this pathway in the basophilic differentiation of leukaemic cells and CD34-positive primary cells. Finally, gene reporter assays confirmed that MYB and MYB-GATA1 directly activated NTRK1 and IL1RL1 transcription, leading to basophilic skewing of the blasts. MYB-GATA1 is more efficient than MYB, because of better stability. Our results highlight the role of IL-33 and NGF receptors in the basophilic differentiation of normal and leukaemic cells.

The hormone erythropoietin (Epo) is required for erythropoiesis, yet its molecular mechanism of action remains poorly understood, particularly with respect to chromatin dynamics. To investigate how Epo modulates the erythroid epigenome, we performed epigenetic profiling using an ex vivo murine cell system that undergoes synchronous erythroid maturation in response to Epo stimulation. Our findings define the repertoire of Epo-modulated enhancers, illuminating a new facet of Epo signaling. First, a large number of enhancers rapidly responded to Epo stimulation, revealing a cis-regulatory network of Epo-responsive enhancers. In contrast, most of the other identified enhancers remained in an active acetylated state during Epo signaling, suggesting that most erythroid enhancers are established at an earlier precursor stage. Second, we identified several hundred super-enhancers that were linked to key erythroid genes, such as Tal1, Bcl11a, and Mir144/451. Third, experimental and computational validation revealed that many predicted enhancer regions were occupied by TAL1 and enriched with DNA-binding motifs for GATA1, KLF1, TAL1/E-box, and STAT5. Additionally, many of these cis-regulatory regions were conserved evolutionarily and displayed correlated enhancer:promoter acetylation. Together, these findings define a cis-regulatory enhancer network for Epo signaling during erythropoiesis, and provide the framework for future studies involving the interplay of epigenetics and Epo signaling.
In treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), prognostic factors, including gene mutation and abnormal gene expression, enable risk stratification of patients. However, in the case of a small proportion of leukemic blast cells, such as AML associated with Down syndrome (AML-DS), it is not possible to examine prognostic factors precisely due to the large proportion of normal cells. Here, we present a novel method for examining prognostic factors by making a smear on a membrane slide glass from a small amount of diagnostic specimen and collecting highly pure leukemic blast cells by laser microdissection (LMD). We verified the effectiveness of this method using 10% KPAM1 cell line suspension and peripheral blood containing 20% blast cells obtained from a patient with transient abnormal myelopoiesis (TAM). After making blood smears, approximately 100 cells were collected and analyzed by direct sequencing. Frameshift mutations (2 bp deletion and 17 bp duplication, respectively) in GATA-1 were detected in each sample, suggesting KPAM1 and TAM blast cells were accurately purified. This novel method enables us to precisely examine prognostic factors in many cases, even in cases with a small proportion of leukemic blast cells or small specimens to preserve.
Casein kinase 2-interacting protein-1 (CKIP-1) is a known regulator of cardiomyocytes and macrophage proliferation. In this study, we showed that CKIP-1 was involved in the process of megakaryocytic differentiation. During megakaryocytic differentiation of K562 cells, CKIP-1 was dramatically upregulated and this upregulation induced by PMA was mediated through downregulation of transcription factor GATA-1. By transient transfection, oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays, we identified the transcriptional regulation of CKIP-1 by GATA-1. Overexpression of CKIP-1 initiated events of spontaneous megakaryocytic differentiation in K562 cells. Conversely, knockdown of CKIP-1 in cell lines suppressed megakaryocytic differentiation. Mechanistically, overexpression of CKIP-1 changed the expression levels of transcription factors that have been shown to be critical in erythro-megakaryocytic differentiation such as Fli-1, c-Myb and c-Myc. In vivo analysis confirmed that CKIP-1-/- mice had decreased number of CD41+ cells harvested from bone marrow, and lower platelet levels when compared to wild-type littermates. This is the first direct evidence suggesting that CKIP-1 is a novel regulator of megakaryocytic differentiation.
The role of chromatin structure in lineage commitment of multipotent hematopoietic progenitors (HPCs) is presently unclear. We show here that CD34+ HPCs possess a post-replicative chromatin globally devoid of the repressive histone mark H3K27me3. This H3K27-unmodified chromatin is required for recruitment of lineage-determining transcription factors (TFs) C/EBPα, PU.1, and GATA-1 to DNA just after DNA replication upon cytokine-induced myeloid or erythroid commitment. Blocking DNA replication or increasing H3K27me3 levels prevents recruitment of these TFs to DNA and suppresses cytokine-induced erythroid or myeloid differentiation. However, H3K27me3 is rapidly associated with nascent DNA in more primitive human and murine HPCs. Treatment of these cells with instructive cytokines leads to a significant delay in accumulation of H3K27me3 in nascent chromatin due to activity of the H3K27me3 demethylase UTX. Thus, HPCs utilize special mechanisms of chromatin modification for recruitment of specific TFs to DNA during early stages of lineage specification.
Bromodomain and extraterminal motif (BET) proteins are pharmacologic targets for the treatment of diverse diseases, yet the roles of individual BET family members remain unclear. We find that BRD2, but not BRD4, co-localizes with the architectural/insulator protein CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) genome-wide. CTCF recruits BRD2 to co-bound sites whereas BRD2 is dispensable for CTCF occupancy. Disruption of a CTCF/BRD2-occupied element positioned between two unrelated genes enables regulatory influence to spread from one gene to another, suggesting that CTCF and BRD2 form a transcriptional boundary. Accordingly, single-molecule mRNA fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) reveals that, upon site-specific CTCF disruption or BRD2 depletion, expression of the two genes becomes increasingly correlated. HiC shows that BRD2 depletion weakens boundaries co-occupied by CTCF and BRD2, but not those that lack BRD2. These findings indicate that BRD2 supports boundary activity, and they raise the possibility that pharmacologic BET inhibitors can influence gene expression in part by perturbing domain boundary function.
Diamond-Blackfan anemia (DBA) is a congenital bone marrow failure syndrome characterized by erythroid hypoplasia, usually without perturbation of other hematopoietic lineages. Approximately 65% of DBA patients with autosomal dominant inheritance have heterozygous mutations or deletions in ribosomal protein (RP) genes while &lt;1% of patients with X-linked inheritance have been identified with mutations in the transcription factor GATA1 Erythroid cells from patients with DBA have not been well characterized, and the mechanisms underlying the erythroid specific effects of either RP or GATA1 associated DBA remain unclear. We have developed an ex vivo culture system to expand peripheral blood CD34+ progenitor cells from patients with DBA and differentiate them into erythroid cells. Cells from patients with RP or GATA1 mutations showed decreased proliferation and delayed erythroid differentiation in comparison with controls. RNA transcript analyses of erythroid cells from controls and patients with RP or GATA1 mutations showed distinctive differences, with upregulation of heme biosynthesis genes prominently in RP-mediated DBA and failure to upregulate components of the translational apparatus in GATA1-mediated DBA. Our data show that dysregulation of translation is a common feature of DBA caused by both RP and GATA1 mutations. This trial was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as #NCT00106015.
Chimeric transcription factors are a hallmark of human leukemia, but the molecular mechanisms by which they block differentiation and promote aberrant self-renewal remain unclear. Here, we demonstrate that the ETO2-GLIS2 fusion oncoprotein, which is found in aggressive acute megakaryoblastic leukemia, confers megakaryocytic identity via the GLIS2 moiety while both ETO2 and GLIS2 domains are required to drive increased self-renewal properties. ETO2-GLIS2 directly binds DNA to control transcription of associated genes by upregulation of expression and interaction with the ETS-related ERG protein at enhancer elements. Importantly, specific interference with ETO2-GLIS2 oligomerization reverses the transcriptional activation at enhancers and promotes megakaryocytic differentiation, providing a relevant interface to target in this poor-prognosis pediatric leukemia.
Platelet activation in response to stimulation of the Protease Activated Receptor 4 (PAR4) receptor differs by race. One factor that contributes to this difference is the expression level of Phosphatidylcholine Transfer Protein (PCTP), a regulator of platelet PAR4 function. We have conducted an expression Quantitative Trait Locus (eQTL) analysis that identifies single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) linked to the expression level of platelet genes. This analysis revealed 26 SNPs associated with the expression level of PCTP at genome-wide significance (p &lt; 5×10-8). Using annotation from ENCODE and other public data we prioritised one of these SNPs, rs2912553, for functional testing. The allelic frequency of rs2912553 is racially-dimorphic, in concordance with the racially differential expression of PCTP. Reporter gene assays confirmed that the single nucleotide change caused by rs2912553 altered the transcriptional potency of the surrounding genomic locus. Electromobility shift assays, luciferase assays, and overexpression studies indicated a role for the megakaryocytic transcription factor GATA1. In summary, we have integrated multi-omic data to identify and functionalise an eQTL. This, along with the previously described relationship between PCTP and PAR4 function, allows us to characterise a genotype-phenotype relationship through the mechanism of gene expression.
Objective: To investigate the effect of lmna gene down-regulation on early hematopoietic development of zebrafish. Methods: Phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomer (PMO) technology was used to downregulate lmna gene expression in Zebrafish. Zebrafish embryos injected phosphorodiamidate morpholino antisense oligonucleotide of lmna gene mRNA by microinjection at unicellular stage were taken as the experimental group, and those injected meaningless phosphorodiamidate morpholino antisense oligonucleotide were taken as the control. The embryos were collected at 18, 24, 30 and 36 hpf after the fertilization. The real-time fluorescent quantitative PCR (RT-PCR) and whole embryo in situ hybridization methods were used to detect the expression of myeloid hematopoietic transcription factor pu. 1 and erythroid hematopoietic transcription factor gata1 in zebrafish. Results: RT-PCR showed that the expressions of pu. 1 and gata1 decreased in the experimental group compared with the control group (all P&lt;0.05). Whole embryo in situ hybridization showed that the blue-black positive hybridization signals of pu. 1 and gata1 in experimental group were shallow than those in the control group. Conclusion: Myeloid hematopoietic and erythroid hematopoietic of zebrafish are blocked with the downregulation of lmna gene.
Primary myelofibrosis (PMF) is a clonal hematologic malignancy characterized by BM fibrosis, extramedullary hematopoiesis, circulating CD34+ cells, splenomegaly, and a propensity to evolve to acute myeloid leukemia. Moreover, the spleen and BM of patients harbor atypical, clustered megakaryocytes, which contribute to the disease by secreting profibrotic cytokines. Here, we have revealed that megakaryocytes in PMF show impaired maturation that is associated with reduced GATA1 protein. In investigating the cause of GATA1 downregulation, our gene-expression study revealed the presence of the RPS14-deficient gene signature, which is associated with defective ribosomal protein function and linked to the erythroid lineage in 5q deletion myelodysplastic syndrome. Surprisingly, reduced GATA1 expression and impaired differentiation were limited to megakaryocytes, consistent with a proproliferative effect of a GATA1 deficiency on this lineage. Importantly, expression of GATA1 effectively rescued maturation of PMF megakaryocytes. Together, these results suggest that ribosomal deficiency contributes to impaired megakaryopoiesis in myeloproliferative neoplasms.
Megakaryocytes (MK) are the sole source of platelets in the body. They develop from lineage-committed hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) via intermediate cells, which differ in morphology, size, ploidy, and surface phenotype. Development and maturation of MKs is governed by different transcription factors, including GATA-1, E26 transformation-specific transcription factor (ETS) family members, nuclear factor erythroid 2 transcription factor (NF-E2), and STAT3. During such challenges as acute inflammation, platelets are consumed in high numbers and must be replenished to secure survival of the host. This is achieved by integration of inflammatory signals into early MK development and depends on the STAT1-mediated enhanced translation of transcripts in stem cell-like megakaryocyte progenitors. Here, we review recent developments, which highlight the impact of inflammation on the development of platelets from HSPCs.
GATA family proteins play essential roles in development of many cell types, including hematopoietic, cardiac, and endodermal lineages. The first three factors, GATAs 1, 2, and 3, are essential for normal hematopoiesis, and their mutations are responsible for a variety of blood disorders. Acquired and inherited GATA1 mutations contribute to Diamond-Blackfan anemia, acute megakaryoblastic leukemia, transient myeloproliferative disorder, and a group of related congenital dyserythropoietic anemias with thrombocytopenia. Conversely, germ line mutations in GATA2 are associated with GATA2 deficiency syndrome, whereas acquired mutations are seen in myelodysplastic syndrome, acute myeloid leukemia, and in blast crisis transformation of chronic myeloid leukemia. The fact that mutations in these genes are commonly seen in blood disorders underscores their critical roles and highlights the need to develop targeted therapies for transcription factors. This review focuses on hematopoietic disorders that are associated with mutations in two prominent GATA family members, GATA1 and GATA2.
