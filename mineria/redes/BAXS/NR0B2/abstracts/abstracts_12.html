Previous studies showed that a complex series of interactive molecular events are associated with this process, especially hormones (progesterone and estrogens) and growth factors, and are important for the cleavage and differentiation of the blastocysts. Yet, the mechanism of preimplantation embryo development is unclear. Using conditional knockout mice (CKO), we showed the development of blastocyst is tightly controlled by the level of progesterone (P4); furthermore, we found that the time when P4 should increase is also crucial for the formation of blastocysts. In CKO mice whose Lrh1 (liver receptor homolog 1) is deleted under the expression of Cre recombinase driven by progesterone receptor promoter, which reduced P4 synthesis, few of their embryos can reach blastocyst stage. When these CKO mice were supplied with P4 in the afternoon of dpc 1 (day post copulation), most of the embryos can form blastocysts; when CKO mice were supplied with P4 from the morning of dpc1, one-third of the embryos can reach blastocyst stage; however, the supplement of P4 in the morning of dpc 2 made very few of the embryos become blastocysts. We conclude that early exposure to P4 is essential for timely progression of early embryogenesis in the mouse.
Liver receptor homolog 1 (LRH1), directs the development and differentiation of embryonic pancreas, and is overexpressed in pancreatic cancer (PC). We hypothesized that LRH1 promotes PC growth. Cell proliferation and tumorigenicity in nude mice were compared between empty vector-transfected (control) and stable LRH1-overexpressed PC cell lines. The subsequent tumor burden, vasculature development, and histologic features were evaluated. LRH1 overexpression enhanced the expression of downstream target genes (cyclin D1/E1) and stimulated cell proliferation in PC cell lines. LRH1 upregulated cyclin E1 truncated T1/T2 isoforms expression which may occur through ERα-calpain1 signaling. Compared with the control, LRH1 overexpressing stable cells generated tumors with increased weight, proliferation index and enhanced angiogenesis. Cyclin D1/E1 and calpain1 were overexpressed in human PC tumors compared to adjacent normal pancreas. These observations demonstrate that LRH1 promotes PC growth and angiogenesis, suggesting that LRH1 is a driving factor in tumorigenesis and may serve as a potential therapeutic target. 
Altered adipose tissue formation is a well-known effectors of obesity and T2D. Here, we describe the role of Lrh1 and its co-repressor Shp in the control of adipocyte formation. Expression of Lrh1 in the pre-adipocyte containing SVF is induced in obese mice models and humans while Shp expression is reduced. We demonstrate, that Lrh1 is an inhibitor of adipogenesis while Shp acts functions as an activator through repression of Lrh1 activity. This regulation is at least in part modulated by estradiol conversion through the regulation of Cyp19a1 gene expression. In vivo, loss of Lrh1 leads to induced adipogenesis, while loss of Shp causes uncontrolled activation of Lrh1 and reduced adipogenesis. As Shp expression has been linked to the development of obesity and metabolic disorders, it is possible that alterations of the Shp/Lrh1 network lead to changes in adipocyte formation, which might contribute to the development of obesity associated T2D. 
Embryonic stem (ES) cells, isolated from pre-implantation embryos, can grow indefinitely invitro (self-renewal) and have potential to differentiate into all cell types in the body (pluripotency). The nuclear receptor gene family is very important for controlling development, differentiation and homeostasis. Here, we review the new progress in understanding the role of nuclear receptors in ES cells focusing on the structure, expression and function of several nuclear receptors. LRH1, DAX1, Esrrβ and TR2 play critical roles in maintaining pluripotency, while, GCNF, COUP-TFs and sumoylated TR2 are critical in regulating the exit from pluripotency. Nuclear receptors hold great potential as targets of manipulation of ES and iPS cells for applications in regenerative medicine, because they are ligand-activated transcription factors that can be regulated by small molecule agonists and antagonists.
At least 600 infertile knockout mice have been produced and this review is limited to recent models involving unexpected genes in reproduction or genes involved in recently identified molecular biology pathways. They concern the female meiosis (Brca1), primordial follicles (Lhx8), granulosa cells (Lrh1), and, for both sexes, mitochondria (Immp2l) and meiosis (Ubb). Germ cells can be altered differently following the sex, as it is the case for Dicer, known to be involved in the formation of miRNA. Knockout mice can support data obtained in human, such as for HNRNPGT, whose role in the human spermatogenesis remained questionable. However, due to numerous factors involved, positive results obtained by the "candidate gene approach" remain limited (for example, SCP3 and CREM). Nevertheless, knockout mouse models bring considerable knowledge on genes possibly involved in men and women infertilities.
Female fertility requires normal ovarian follicular growth and ovulation. The nuclear receptor liver receptor homolog 1 has been implicated in processes as diverse as bile acid metabolism, steroidogenesis, and cell proliferation. In the ovary, Lrh1 is expressed exclusively in granulosa and luteal cells. Using somatic targeted mutagenesis, we show that mice lacking Lrh1 in granulosa cells are sterile, due to anovulation. The preovulatory stimulus fails to elicit cumulus expansion, luteinization, and follicular rupture in these mice. Multiple defects, including severely reduced transactivation of the Lrh1 target gene, nitric oxide synthase 3, leads to increased intrafollicular estradiol levels in the absence of Lrh1. This further causes dysfunction of prostaglandin and hyaluronic acid cascades and interrupts cumulus expansion. Lack of Lrh1 also interferes with progesterone synthesis because of failure of normal expression of the Lrh1 targets, steroidogenic acute regulatory protein and cytochrome P450 side-chain cleavage. In addition, expression of extracellular matrix proteases essential for ovulation is compromised. These results demonstrate that Lrh1 is a regulator of multiple mechanisms essential for maturation of ovarian follicles and for ovulation. Lrh1 is therefore a key modulator of female fertility and a potential target for contraception.
Hundreds of microRNAs (miRNAs) are expressed in mammalian cells, where they aid in modulating gene expression by mediating mRNA transcript cleavage and/or regulation of translation rate. Functional studies to date have demonstrated that several of these miRNAs are important during development. However, the role of miRNAs in the regulation of stem cell growth and differentiation is not well understood. We show herein that microRNA (miR)-134 levels are maximally elevated at day 4 after retinoic acid-induced differentiation or day 2 after N2B27-induced differentiation of mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs), but this change is not observed during embryoid body differentiation. The elevation of miR-134 levels alone in mESCs enhances differentiation toward ectodermal lineages, an effect that is blocked by a miR-134 antagonist. The promotion of mESC differentiation by miR-134 is due, in part, to its direct translational attenuation of Nanog and LRH1, both of which are known positive regulators of Oct4/POU5F1 and mESC growth. Together, the data demonstrate that miR-134 alone can enhance the differentiation of mESCs to ectodermal lineages and establish a functional role for miR-134 in modulating mESC differentiation through its potential to target and regulate multiple mRNAs.
The nuclear receptor Steroidogenic Factor 1 (SF1) plays a critical role in the development of the adrenal gland and gonads, and in sexual differentiation. SF1 performs this pivotal function through the regulation of hormone expression that is essential for organogenesis and endocrine homeostasis. SF1 is a member of a nuclear receptor subclass that contains LRH1 and the Drosophila receptor FTZ-F1. To date, a natural ligand has not been reported for any member of this subfamily. Here we report the crystallization and characterization of the ligand-binding domain (LBD) of human SF1 from two different crystal forms: a binary complex with fortuitous ligand and a ternary complex with the same ligand and a peptide containing a motif of a nuclear receptor cofactor. The structural determination of the binary complex required the use of sulfur SAD phasing, a relatively new technique that uses anomalous diffraction from the endogenous sulfur atoms present in the protein. The structure of the ternary complex was determined by multiple wavelength anomalous diffraction (MAD) using seleno-methionine substituted SF1. Preliminary analysis suggested SF1 contained a fortuitous ligand in the binding pocket. This ligand may account for the relatively high basal activity observed for SF1 in cofactor recruitment and cell-based assays.
Nuclear receptors are master regulators of metazoan gene expression with crucial roles during development and in adult physiology. Fushi tarazu factor 1 (FTZ-F1) subfamily members are ancient orphan receptors with homologues from Drosophila to human that regulate diverse gene expression programs important for developmental processes, reproduction and cholesterol homeostasis in an apparently ligand-independent manner. Thus, developmental and tissue-specific cofactors may be particularly important in modulating the transcriptional activities of FTZ-F1 receptors. In Drosophila, the homeodomain protein Fushi tarazu acts as a cofactor for FTZ-F1 (NR5A3), leading to the hypothesis that a similar type of homeodomain cofactor-nuclear receptor relationship might exist in vertebrates. In this study, we have identified and characterized the homeodomain protein Prox1 as a co-repressor for liver receptor homologue 1 (LRH1/NR5A2), a master regulator of cholesterol homeostasis in mammals. Our study suggests that interactions between LRH1 and Prox1 may fulfil roles both during development of the enterohepatic system and in adult physiology of the liver.
Somatic cells can be reprogrammed to induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) by expressing four transcription factors: Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, and c-Myc. Here we report that enhancing RA signaling by expressing RA receptors (RARs) or by RA agonists profoundly promoted reprogramming, but inhibiting it using a RAR-α dominant-negative form completely blocked it. Coexpressing Rarg (RAR-γ) and Lrh-1 (liver receptor homologue 1; Nr5a2) with the four factors greatly accelerated reprogramming so that reprogramming of mouse embryonic fibroblast cells to ground-state iPSCs requires only 4 d induction of these six factors. The six-factor combination readily reprogrammed primary human neonatal and adult fibroblast cells to exogenous factor-independent iPSCs, which resembled ground-state mouse ES cells in growth properties, gene expression, and signaling dependency. Our findings demonstrate that signaling through RARs has critical roles in molecular reprogramming and that the synergistic interaction between Rarg and Lrh1 directs reprogramming toward ground-state pluripotency. The human iPSCs described here should facilitate functional analysis of the human genome.
Orphan nuclear receptor Small Heterodimer Partner (SHP; NR0B2) is a transcriptional corepressor of a wide variety of nuclear receptors (NRs). Here, we report that SHP recruits SIRT1, a class III histone deacetylase, in an NR-specific manner to inhibit transcriptional activity. SHP interacts and co-localizes specifically with SIRT1 in vivo and inhibition of SIRT1 activity leads to a recovery from the intrinsic repressive activity of SHP but not of DAX1. Furthermore, we observed that SIRT1 does not deacetylate SHP or LRH1. However, inhibition of either SIRT1 or SHP significantly diminished the repressive effect of SHP on LRH1 transactivity. LRH1-mediated activation of CYP7A1 and SHP gene transcription was significantly repressed by both SHP and SIRT1 whereas inhibition of SIRT1 activity by inhibitors or dominant negative SIRT1 or knockdown of SHP led to a significant release of this inhibitory effect. ChIP assays revealed that SHP recruits SIRT1 on LRH1 target gene promoters and SIRT1 deacetylated template-dependent histone H3 and H4 to inhibit transcription of LRH1 target genes. Finally, we demonstrated that inhibition of SIRT1 activity significantly reversed SHP-mediated inhibition of bile-acid synthesis by LRH1 overexpression, thereby suggesting a novel mechanism of SHP-mediated inhibition of LRH1-dependent bile-acid homeostasis via recruitment of SIRT1 histone deacetylase protein.
Hepatitis B virus (HBV) replicates by the reverse transcription of the viral 3.5 kb pregenomic RNA. Therefore the level of expression of this transcript in the liver is a primary determinant of HBV biosynthesis. In vivo neonatal transcription of the HBV 3.5 kb pregenomic RNA is developmental regulated by hepatocyte nuclear factor 4α (HNF4α). In addition, viral biosynthesis in non-hepatoma cells can be supported directly by this nuclear receptor. However HBV transcription and replication can be supported by additional nuclear receptors including the retinoid X receptor α/peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (RXRα/PPARα), retinoid X receptor α/farnesoid X receptor α (RXRα/FXRα), liver receptor homolog 1 (LRH1) and estrogen-related receptors (ERR) in non-hepatoma cells. Therefore during neonatal liver development, HNF4α may progressively activate viral transcription and replication by binding directly to the proximal HNF4α recognition sequence within the nucleocapsid promoter. Alternatively, HNF4α may support viral biosynthesis in vivo indirectly by activating a network of liver-enriched nuclear receptors that, in combination, direct HBV 3.5 kb pregenomic RNA transcription and replication.
The reduced incidence of breast cancer in certain Eastern countries has been attributed to high soy diets although this evidence is simply epidemiological. One of the major constituents of soy is genistein, but paradoxically this phytoestrogen binds to oestrogen receptors and stimulates growth at concentrations that would be achieved by a high soy diet, but inhibits growth at high experimental concentrations. To determine the effects of low-dose, long-term genistein exposure we have cultured MCF-7 breast cancer cells in 10 nM genistein for 10-12 weeks and investigated whether or not this long-term genistein treatment (LTGT) altered the expression of oestrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha) and the activity of the PI3-K/Akt signalling pathway. This is known to be pivotal in the signalling of mitogens such as oestradiol (E(2)), insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) and epidermal growth factor (EGF). LTGT significantly reduced the growth promoting effects of E(2) and increased the dose-dependent growth-inhibitory effect of the PI3-K inhibitor, LY 294002, compared to untreated control MCF-7 cells. This was associated with a significant decreased protein expression of total Akt and phosphorylated Akt but not ERalpha. Rapamycin, an inhibitor of one of the down-stream targets of Akt, mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), also dose-dependently inhibited growth but the response to this drug was similar in LTGT and control MCF-7 cells. The protein expression of liver receptor homologue-1 (LRH1), an orphan nuclear receptor implicated in tumourigenesis was not affected by LTGT. The results show that LTGT results in a down-regulation of the PI3-K/Akt signalling pathway and may be a mechanism through which genistein could offer protection against breast cancer.
Despite the broad anti-tumour potential of the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib, partial information is available with regard to its effects on hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells. Here we studied the effects of bortezomib on two human HCC cell lines displaying a different phenotype, hepatocyte-like for HepG2 and undifferentiated for JHH6. Bortezomib induced a dose- and time-dependent increase in cell toxicity and decrease of cell viability, with JHH6 being less sensitive than HepG2. Moreover, a differential influence on major cell cycle regulatory genes was responsible for the observed decrease of S and increase of G(2)-M phase cells. In HepG2, bortezomib induced a post-transcriptional increase of cyclin E1 together with a transcriptional-mediated decrease of the transcription factor E2F1. This in turn resulted in the reduction of the hyper-phosphorylated form of pRB and in the transcriptional down-regulation of the E2F1 targets cyclin D1, cyclin A2 and CdK2 but not cyclin E1. Up-regulation of LRH1, a liver specific cyclin E1 transcription factor, accounted for the unvaried cyclin E1 mRNA levels. Additionally, bortezomib induced both transcriptional and post-translational increase of p21(waf1/cip1) and p27(kip1). In JHH6, an overall more contained variation in cell cycle mediators was observed with the reduction of E2F1, cyclin A2, LRH1 and the increase of p21(waf1/cip1) being the most evident. In conclusion, the presented data show the mechanisms regulating cell proliferation inhibition by bortezomib in two different HCC cell lines. Despite a certain phenotype-dependent effect, the potent action exerted by bortezomib makes this drug attractive for future experimentation in animal models, possibly leading to novel treatments for HCC.
Excessive exposure to estradiol represents the main risk factor for endometrial cancer. The abnormally high estradiol levels in the endometrium of women with endometrial cancer are most likely due to overproduction by the tumour itself. Endometrial cancer cells express the genes encoding the steroidogenic enzymes involved in estradiol synthesis. Here we used RT-PCR and Western blot to show that the nuclear receptors SF1 and LRH1, two well-known regulators of steroidogenic gene expression in gonadal and adrenal cells, are also expressed in endometrial cancer cell lines. By transient transfections, we found that SF1 and LRH1, but not the related nuclear receptor NUR77, can activate the promoters of three human steroidogenic genes: STAR, HSD3B2, and CYP19A1 PII. Similarly, forskolin but not PMA, could activate all three promoters. In addition, we found that both SF1 and LRH1 can transcriptionally cooperate with the AP-1 family members c-JUN and c-FOS, known to be associated with enhanced proliferation of endometrial carcinoma cells, to further enhance activation of the STAR, HSD3B2, and CYP19A1 PII promoters. All together, our data provide novel insights into the mechanisms of steroidogenic gene expression in endometrial cancer cells and thus in the regulation of estradiol biosynthesis by tumour cells.
Liver receptor homolog 1 (Lrh1, also known as Nr5a2) belongs to the orphan nuclear receptor superfamily and has diverse functions in development, metabolism, and cell differentiation and death. Lrh1 regulates the expression of Oct4, which is a key factor of early embryonic differentiation. However, the role of Lrh1 in early development of mammalian embryo is unknown. In the present study, the localization, Lrh1 mRNA expression, and LRH1 protein levels in porcine early parthenotes were examined by immunofluorescence and real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction. To determine the role of Lrh1 in porcine early embryo development, the parthenotes were treated with the specific LRH1 antagonist 505601. The immunofluorescence signal for LRH1 was only observed in the nucleus of blastocysts. The blastocyst developmental rate in the presence of 50 and 100 μM 505601 was significantly lower than that in the control group. The blastocyst hatching rate was also reduced in the presence of 50 and 100 μM 505601 than that under control conditions. The latter effect was possibly due to the decreased expression of hatching-related genes such as Fn1, Itgα5, and Cox2 upon the inhibition of Lrh1. Incubation with the LRH1 antagonist also increased the number of apoptotic cells among the blastocysts. Moreover, LRH1 inhibition enhanced the expression of the pro-apoptotic genes Bax and Casp3, and reduced the expression of the anti-apoptotic gene Bcl2. Lrh1 inhibition also led to significant decrease in the expression levels of Oct4 mRNA and octamer-binding transcription factor 4 (OCT4) protein in the blastocysts. In conclusion, Lrh1 affects blastocyst formation and hatching in porcine embryonic development through the regulation of OCT4 expression and cell apoptosis. 
Although nucleos(t)ide analog (NA) therapy effectively reduces the hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA load in the serum of patients with chronic hepatitis B, it does not completely reduce the incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).
A total of 109 patients who had chronic hepatitis B and were receiving NA therapy were analyzed. Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that age (&gt;60 years had a hazard ratio [HR] of 2.66), FIB-4 index (an index of &gt;2.1 had a HR of 2.57), and the presence of HBV core-related antigen (HBcrAg; HR, 3.53) during treatment were significantly associated with the development of HCC. The amount of HBV DNA and pregenomic RNA in liver were significantly higher in 16 HBcrAg-positive patients, compared with 12 HBcrAg-negative patients, suggesting active HBV replication in HBcrAg-positive livers. Hepatic gene expression profiling showed that HBV-promoting transcriptional factors, including HNF4α, PPARα, and LRH1, were upregulated in HBcrAg-positive livers. HepAD38 cells overexpressing LRH1 increased HBV replication, characterized by higher HBV DNA and pregenomic RNA levels, during long-term exposure to entecavir. Conversely, overexpression of precore/core in HepG2 cells increased levels of these transcriptional factors. Metformin efficiently repressed HBV replication in primary human hepatocytes.
Modulating HBV transcriptional factors by metformin in combination with NA therapy would potentiate anti-HBV activity and reduce the incidence of HCC in HBcrAg-positive patients.
Mounting research evidence demonstrates a significant negative impact of circadian disruption on human health. Shift work, chronic jet lag and sleep disturbances are associated with increased incidence of metabolic syndrome, and consequently result in obesity, type 2 diabetes and dyslipidemia. Here, these associations are reviewed with respect to liver metabolism and disease. 
Liver receptor homologue-1 (LRH1) is an orphan nuclear receptor that has been shown to play a role in the transcriptional regulation of pathways involved in cancer. Elucidating the components of the LRH1 transcriptional complex to better understand endogenous regulation of the receptor as well as its role in cancer remains a high priority. A sub-cellular enrichment strategy coupled with proteomic approaches was employed to identify putative LRH1 co-regulators. Nuclear fractionation protocol was essential for detection of LRH1 peptides by mass spectrometry (MS), with most peptides being observed in the insoluble fraction (receptor bound to DNA). SERBP1 and ILF3 were identified as LRH1 interacting partners by both Western blot and MS/MS analysis. Receptor knockdown by siRNA showed an increase in SERBP1 expression, while ILF3 expression was unchanged. In contrast, receptor overexpression decreased only SERBP1 mRNA levels. Consistent with these data, in a promoter:reporter assay, binding of LRH1 to the promoter region of SERBP1 resulted in a decrease in the expression level of the reporter gene, subsequently inhibiting transcription. Given the receptor's role in cancer progression, the study here elucidates additional transcriptional machinery involved in LRH1 signaling and potentially provides new targets for therapeutics development. 
The pluripotency and self-renewal capacity of embryonic stem (ES) cells is regulated by several transcription factors. Here, we show that the ETS-related transcription factors Etv4 and Etv5 (Etv4/5) are specifically expressed in undifferentiated ES cells, and suppression of Oct3/4 results in down-regulation of Etv4/5. Simultaneous deletion of Etv4 and Etv5 (Etv4/5 double knock-out (dKO)) in ES cells resulted in a flat, epithelial cell-like appearance, whereas the morphology changed into compact colonies in a 2i medium (containing two inhibitors for GSK3 and MEK/ERK). Expression levels of self-renewal marker genes, including Oct3/4 and Nanog, were similar between wild-type and dKO ES cells, whereas proliferation of Etv4/5 dKO ES cells was decreased with overexpression of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (p16/p19, p15, and p57). A differentiation assay revealed that the embryoid bodies derived from Etv4/5 dKO ES cells were smaller than the control, and expression of ectoderm marker genes, including Fgf5, Sox1, and Pax3, was not induced in dKO-derived embryoid bodies. Microarray analysis demonstrated that stem cell-related genes, including Tcf15, Gbx2, Lrh1, Zic3, and Baf60c, were significantly repressed in Etv4/5 dKO ES cells. The artificial expression of Etv4 and/or Etv5 in Etv4/5 dKO ES cells induced re-expression of Tcf15 and Gbx2. These results indicate that Etv4 and Etv5, potentially through regulation of Gbx2 and Tcf15, are involved in the ES cell proliferation and induction of differentiation-associated genes in ES cells. 
Oncogenic transcription factors are known to mediate the conversion of somatic cells to tumour or induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). Here we report c-Jun as a barrier for iPSC formation. c-Jun is expressed by and required for the proliferation of mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), but not mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs). Consistently, c-Jun is induced during mESC differentiation, drives mESCs towards the endoderm lineage and completely blocks the generation of iPSCs from MEFs. Mechanistically, c-Jun activates mesenchymal-related genes, broadly suppresses the pluripotent ones, and derails the obligatory mesenchymal to epithelial transition during reprogramming. Furthermore, inhibition of c-Jun by shRNA, dominant-negative c-Jun or Jdp2 enhances reprogramming and replaces Oct4 among the Yamanaka factors. Finally, Jdp2 anchors 5 non-Yamanaka factors (Id1, Jhdm1b, Lrh1, Sall4 and Glis1) to reprogram MEFs into iPSCs. Our studies reveal c-Jun as a guardian of somatic cell fate and its suppression opens the gate to pluripotency. 
We previously demonstrated that coexpressing retinoic acid (RA) receptor gamma and liver receptor homolog-1 (LRH1 or NR5A2) with OCT4, MYC, KLF4, and SOX2 (4F) rapidly reprograms mouse embryonic fibroblast cells (MEFs) into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). Here, we further explore the role of RA in reprogramming and report that the six factors (6F) efficiently and directly reprogram MEFs into integration-free iPSCs in defined medium (N2B27) in the absence of feeder cells. Through genetic and chemical approaches, we find that RA signalling is essential, in a highly dose-sensitive manner, for MEF reprogramming. The removal of exogenous RA from N2B27, the inhibition of endogenous RA synthesis or the expression of a dominant-negative form of RARA severely impedes reprogramming. By contrast, supplementing N2B27 with various retinoids substantially boosts reprogramming. In addition, when coexpressed with LRH1, RA receptors (RARs) can promote reprogramming in the absence of both exogenous and endogenously synthesized RA. Remarkably, the reprogramming of epiblast stem cells into embryonic stem cell-like cells also requires low levels of RA, which can modulate Wnt signalling through physical interactions of RARs with β-catenin. These results highlight the important functions of RA signalling in reprogramming somatic cells and primed stem cells to naïve pluripotency. Stem Cells 2015;33:1390-1404. 
Impairment of bile acid homeostasis is the most important risk factor of gallstone disease. Thereby the bile acid sensor farnesoid X receptor (FXR) plays a pivotal role in hepatic and intestinal bile acid metabolism. In this explorative study, the FXR gene was investigated to identify gene variants, associated with gallstone formation in a Caucasian population.
Sequencing of the FXR gene was conducted in a randomly selected cohort of gallstone carriers (n=30) and control subjects (n=16) from Stuttgart, Germany. Genomic DNA was obtained from blood leukocytes. Genotype frequencies were established in the total cohort (controls: n=133, gallstone carriers: n=74). For expression analysis, total RNA and protein were isolated from ileal biopsies.
The sequencing showed the sole appearance of 10 SNPs in gallstone carriers. Further genotype analysis revealed significant gender- and weight-dependent frequency differences of 3 SNPs between gallstone carriers and controls in males (rs35724: OR=4.73, P=0.022) and normal weight subjects (rs11110385: OR=3.67, P=0.027; rs11110386: OR=3.67, P=0.027) applying the 11+12&lt;&gt;22 allele model. Furthermore, rs11110385 carriers showed a significantly decreased FXR protein expression (11+12&lt;&gt;22: P=0.003). Significant mRNA expression differences between lean rs11110385 carriers and non-carriers were observed in FXR target genes (decrease: ILBP: P=0.042, OSTalpha: P=0.071, FGF19: P=0.011. Increase: LRH1: P=0.044).
Three FXR gene variants (rs35724, rs11110385, rs11110386) were identified as potential susceptibility factors for cholelithiasis in a German cohort in gender- and weight-dependent manners. Thereby the tag SNP rs11110385 seemed to influence the activation of the FXR gene.
Here we report the first highly selective CYP3A4 inhibitor optimized from an initial lead with ≈30-fold selectivity over CYP3A5 to yield a series of compounds with greater than 1000-fold selectivity. During our medicinal chemistry and biology effort pursued under our existing LRH1 inverse agonist Extended Characterization (EC) project, we identified several compounds belonging to the imidazopyridine scaffold with activity against the cytochrome enzymes. As a result we have explored how these compounds act on the CYP enzymes described within our approved EC proposal. Associated toxicities due to CYP3A4 related drug–drug interactions have led to clinical failure and withdrawal from market of previously approved pharmaceuticals. Mibefradil (Posicor), a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4, was withdrawn from the market after numerous reports of serious drug–drug interactions. Terfenadine (Seldane) and Cisapride (Propulsid) were withdrawn after patients taking the recommended dose along with CYP3A4 inhibitors such as ketoconazole developed heart arrhythmia leading to heart attack or death. To date, no substrates have been identified that are metabolized exclusively by only one of the enzymes. However, using recombinantly expressed enzymes, several substrates have been shown to have higher catalytic efficiency for either CYP3A4 or CYP3A5. Similarly, no highly selective inhibitors have been identified, but many do show two to fivefold preference for one of the two enzymes. Many of these have been associated with time-dependent inactivation where CYP3A4 appears to be more susceptible to time-dependent inactivation than does CYP3A5. The probe identified herein was tested by the assay provider's lab and the Scripps team using microsomal-based and biochemical assays. These probes will provide useful tools to elucidate the roles of this enzyme in cell metabolism, and will enable studies to differentiate the actions of the diverse members of the CYP family of enzymes.
Estrogens are essential for female reproduction and overall well-being, and estrogens in the circulation are largely synthesized in ovarian granulosa cells. Using primary cultures of ovarian granulosa cells from gonadotropin-primed immature rats, we have recently discovered that pituitary FSH and ovarian cytokine transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGFβ1) induce calcineurin-mediated dephosphorylation-activation of cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB)-regulated transcription coactivator (CRTC2) to modulate the expression of Star, Cyp11a1, and Hsd3b leading to increased production of progesterone. This study explored the role of calcineurin and CRTC2 in FSH and TGFβ1 regulation of Cyp19a1 expression in granulosa cells. Ovarian granulosa cells treated with FSH displayed increased aromatase protein at 24  h post-treatment, which subsided by 48  h, while TGFβ1 acting through its type 1 receptor augmented the action of FSH with a greater and longer effects. It is known that the ovary-specific Cyp19a1 PII-promoter contains crucial response elements for CREB and nuclear receptor NR5A subfamily liver receptor homolog 1 (LRH1/NR5A2) and steroidogenic factor 1 (SF1/NR5A1), and that the Nr5a2 promoter also has a potential CREB-binding site. Herein, we demonstrate that FSH+TGFβ1 increased LRH1 and SF1 protein levels, and their binding to the Cyp19a1 PII-promoter evidenced, determined by chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis. Moreover, pretreatment with calcineurin auto-inhibitory peptide (CNI) abolished the FSH+TGFβ1-upregulated but not FSH-upregulated aromatase activity at 48  h, and the corresponding mRNA changes in Cyp19a1, and Nr5a2 and Nr5a1 at 24  h. In addition, FSH and TGFβ1 increased CRTC2 binding to the Cyp19a1 PII-promoter and Nr5a2 promoter at 24  h, with CREB bound constitutively. In summary, the results of this study indicate that calcineurin and CRTC2 have important roles in mediating FSH and TGFβ1 collateral upregulation of Cyp19a1 expression together with its transcription regulators Nr5a2 and Nr5a1 in ovarian granulosa cells.
The transcriptional factor liver receptor homolog 1 (LRH1) regulates pancreatic development, and may participate in pancreatic oncogenesis through activation of growth factor signaling transduction cascades. We measured transcriptional activity of β-catenin in response to LRH1 stimulation by a Topflash reporter assay. The pancreatic cancer (PC) phenotype was then characterized by cell migration, wound healing, invasion, and sphere formation in vitro, as well as tumor formation and distant metastatic spread in vivo. We compared results between vector control and LRH1-overexpressing stable PC cell lines. In addition, tumor burden, angiogenesis, histologic characteristics, and hepatic spread were assessed in orthotopic and experimental liver metastatic murine models. Expression of downstream LRH1 related genes was evaluated by Western blot and immunohistochemistry in PC cell lines and human tumor specimens. Specific inhibition of LRH1 expression and function was accomplished by shRNAs "knockdown" experiments. It was found that LRH1 enhanced transcriptional activity of β-catenin and the expression of downstream target genes (c-Myc, MMP2/9), as well as promoted migration, wound healing, invasion, and sphere formation of PC cell lines. Specific inhibition of LRH1 by shRNAs reduced cell migration, invasion, sphere formation and expression of c-Myc and MMP2/9 target genes. Mice injected with LRH1 overexpressing stable PC cells developed tumors with increased size and exhibited striking hepatic metastatic spread. More important, LRH1 was overexpressed in PC tumors compared to adjacent normal pancreas. Our findings demonstrate that LRH1 overexpression is associated with increased PC growth and metastatic spread, indicating that LRH1-targeted therapy could inhibit tumor progression. 
The injured liver loses normal function, with concomitant decrease of key identity genes. Super-enhancers contribute to mammalian cell identity. Here, we identified core transcription factors (TFs) that are active in hepatocytes, using genome-wide analysis and hierarchical ordering of super-enhancer distribution.
Expression of core TFs was assessed in a cohort of patients with hepatitis or cirrhosis and animal models. Quantitative PCR, chromatin immunoprecipitation assays, and hydrodynamic gene delivery methods were used to assess gene regulation and hepatocyte viability. RNA-sequencing data were generated to investigate the role of LRH1 in hepatocyte protection from injury.
Network analysis of super-enhancer-associated gene interactions and expression arrays for cohorts of patients with hepatitis and cirrhosis enabled us to identify a super-enhancer-associated network, and LRH1, HNF4α, PPARα, and RXRα as core TFs. In mouse models, expression of core TFs was robustly inhibited by single and multiple challenge(s) with liver toxicant. RNA-seq analysis revealed changes in expression in the super-enhancer-associated genes sensitively biased toward repression by intoxication. LRH1 gene delivery prevented the loss of hepatic super-enhancer-associated signaling circuitry in toxicant-challenged mice, and protected the liver from injury, indicating the role of LRH1 in hepatocyte identity and viability. In hepatocytes, overexpression of each core TF promoted induction of other TFs.
Overall, this study identified LRH1-driven pathway as a circuitry responsible for hepatocyte identity by using cistromic analysis, improving our understanding of liver pathophysiology and identifying novel therapeutic targets.
Hepatoblastoma is the most common malignant liver tumor in children. Since it is often unresectable and exhibits drug resistance, the treatment of advanced hepatoblastoma is challenging. The orphan nuclear receptor liver receptor homolog‑1 (LRH‑1) serves prominent roles in malignancy; however, to the best of our knowledge, the role of LRH‑1 in hepatoblastoma remains unknown. In the present study, human hepatoblastoma cell lines were analyzed; the mRNA and protein expression levels of LRH‑1 were significantly higher in HepG2 and HuH6 cells compared with those in HepT1 cells and control THLE‑2 cells. Knockdown of LRH‑1 resulted in decreased HepG2 and HuH6 cell proliferation via downregulation of cyclin D1 (CCND1) and c‑Myc. Furthermore, treatment with an LRH‑1 antagonist (LRA) inhibited the proliferation and colony formation of cell lines in a dose‑dependent manner, and induced cell cycle arrest at G1 phase through inhibition of CCND1 expression. Finally, LRA treatment enhanced the cytotoxic effects of doxorubicin on hepatoblastoma cells. Collectively, these findings suggested that LRH‑1 may have an important role in the progression of hepatoblastoma and implicated LRA as a novel, potential therapeutic agent for the treatment of hepatoblastoma.
LRH1, which promotes the malignant transformation of carcinoma, has recently been documented in several types of malignancies. However, LRH1 has not been assessed as a potential clinical biomarker in any cancer.
LRH1 expression was tested in fresh-frozen tissue samples with quantitative real-time PCR and Western blot analysis. Surgically resected tumor tissues were collected from 156 non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients: 75 with adenocarcinoma and 81 with squamous cell carcinoma. Subsequently, the immunohistochemical expression of LRH1 was examined, and its clinical significance was evaluated.
LRH1 overexpression was observed in NSCLC carcinoma tissues compared to adjacent normal lung tissues. LRH1 expression was correlated with poorer differentiation (P = 0.023), pathological tumor classification (P &lt; 0.001), advanced pathological tumor node metastasis stage (P = 0.017), adenocarcinoma subtype (P = 0.031), and positive lymph node metastasis (P &lt; 0.001). Multivariate analysis demonstrated that LRH1 expression status was an independent prognostic factor for overall (hazard ratio 1.372, 95% confidence interval 1.225-1.617; P = 0.003) and disease-free survival (hazard ratio 1.497, 95% confidence interval 1.059-2.115; P = 0.011) in patients who suffered from resectable NSCLC.
The results of our study indicate that LRH1 predicts NSCLC progression, metastasis, and a dismal prognosis, emphasizing its promising role as a novel target in NSCLC therapies.
Gypenosides extracted from Gynostemma pentaphyllum (Thunb.) Makino have significant role in reducing serum lipid level and treating fatty liver diseases, however, without clear mechanism. As gypenosides share the similar core structures with bile acids (the endogenous ligands of nuclear receptor FXR), we hypothesize that gypenosides may improve hypercholesterolemia via FXR-mediated bile acids signaling. The present study was designed to validate the role of gypenosides in reducing levels of serum total cholesterol (TC) and low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), as well as in regulating bile acids homeostasis and related gene expression levels. The C57BL/6 male mice were divided into four groups. Mice in groups ND and HFD were fed with normal diet and high fat diet for 38 weeks, respectively. In groups HFD+GP and HFD+ST, mice were fed with high fat diet for 38 weeks and treated with gypenosides and simvastatin (positive control) from weeks 16 to 38, respectively. Serum TC and LDL-C levels were assayed by commercially available kits. Expression levels of genes were tested by the quantitative real-time PCR. The LC-MS/MS was applied to quantify major bile acids in mice livers. Our results showed that gypenosides significantly decreased serum TC and LDL-C levels. The gene expression level of Shp was downregulated while the levels of Cyp7a1, Cyp8b1, Fxr, Lrh1, Jnk1/2, and Erk1/2 were upregulated by gypenosides. Indicated by LC-MS/MS technology, gypenosides increased the hepatic levels of several free bile acids and most taurine-conjugated bile acids while decreasing glycine-conjugated bile acids levels. In addition, gypenosides decreased the CA/CDCA ratio. Gypenosides may improve the abnormal lipid profile of HFD-fed mice via two pathways: (1) enhancing the bile acids biosynthesis from cholesterol; (2) decreasing the CA/CDCA ratio which is positively related to cholesterol absorption.
Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is the leading cause of blindness and visual impairment. The role of microRNA (miRNA) in DR remains largely unknown. The present study aimed to investigate the role of miR‑219‑5p in the progression of DR. Human retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells were treated with a high concentration of glucose (50 mM D‑glucose) for 24 h and the miR‑219‑5p level was detected using reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The results revealed that miR‑219‑5p was significantly upregulated by high glucose (HG) treatment. To explore the role and mechanism of miR‑219‑5p in DR progression, miR‑219‑5p was downregulated in ARPE‑19 cells. An MTT assay and flow cytometry were used to determine the level of viability and apoptosis of ARPE‑19 cells, respectively. MicroRNA.org was used to predict the targets of miR‑219‑5p and the prediction was investigated using a dual‑luciferase reporter assay. In addition, the level of associated proteins were measured using western blot analysis. It was observed that liver receptor homolog‑1 (LRH‑1) was a direct target of miR‑219‑5p. LRH‑1 was significantly downregulated in ARPE‑19 cells following HG treatment and negatively regulated by miR‑219‑5p in ARPE‑19 cells. MiR‑219‑5p inhibitor significantly prevented ARPE‑19 cell apoptosis induced by HG treatment and cell viability was markedly promoted. The results also suggested that the LRH‑1/Wnt/β‑Catenin signaling pathway was activated by miR‑219‑5p inhibition. In addition, it was revealed that LRH‑1 inhibition eliminated the effects of miR‑219‑5p inhibitor on ARPE‑19 cells. In conclusion, the results indicated that miR‑219‑5p was involved in the progression of DR through regulating human RPE cell apoptosis by modulation of the LRH‑1/Wnt/β‑Catenin signaling pathway.
Liver receptor homolog-1 (LRH1) has been shown to promote tumor proliferation and development. However, the functions of LRH1 in mediating cancer cells chemoresistance are still not clear. Here, we found LRH1 levels were significantly elevated in primary breast cancer tissues in patients who developed early recurrence. Similarly, adriamycin (ADR)-resistant breast cancer cell lines also exerted high LRH1 expression. Indeed, overexpression of LRH1 attenuated cytotoxicity of chemotherapeutic drugs ADR and cisplatin (DDP) in breast cancer cells in vitro and in nude mice tumor model. Comet and BrdU assays showed overexpression of LRH1 blocked breast cancer cells DNA damage by chemotherapeutic drug, whereas depletion of LRH1 enhanced DNA damage. Remarkably, knockdown of LRH1 decreased the levels and foci of DNA damage marker γH2AX induced by ADR and DDP. Furthermore, plasmid end-joining assay indicated that knockdown of LRH1 significantly decreased non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ)-mediated double-strand break (DSB) repair efficiencies. Afterwards, we provided evidences that LRH1 promoted MDC1 transcription by directly activating MDC1 promoter and therefore increased γH2AX levels. Importantly, a LRH1-binding site mapped between -1812 and -1804 bp of the proximal MDC1 promoter was identified. Moreover, LRH1 and MDC1 mRNA levels were positively correlated in recurrent breast cancer samples. These results implied LRH1 enhanced breast cancer cell chemoresistance by upregulating MDC1 and attenuating DNA damage. Additionally, we elucidated the coactivator NCOA3 acted synergistically with LRH1 to promote MDC1 expression and chemoresistance. Altogether, LRH1-MDC1 signaling might be considered as a novel molecular target for designing novel therapeutic regimen in chemotherapy resistance breast cancer.
The present review aimed to assess the networks of transcription factors regulating the Oct4 expression in mice. Through a comprehensive analysis of the binding sites and the interrelationships of the transcription factors of Oct4, it is found that transcription factors of Oct4 form three regulating complexes centered by Oct4-Sox2, Nanog, and Lrh1. They bind on CR4, CR2, and CR1 regions of Oct4 promoter/enhancer, respectively, to activate Oct4 transcription synergistically. This article also discusses the mechanisms of fine-tuning the Oct4 expression. These findings have important implications in the field of stem cell and developmental biology.
Leydig cells (LCs) in the adult testis have been identified as the major sites of oestrogen production, which is crucial for mammalian germ cell differentiation. Our previous work showed that transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGFB1) inhibits estradiol (E2) secretion via down-regulating Cyp19 gene expression in mature rat LCs. However, the mechanism remains unclear. In the present study, the effects of TGFB1 on the expression levels of steroidogenic factor 1 (SF1), liver receptor homolog 1 (LRH1), cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) and cAMP responsive element modulator (CREM) were evaluated both in primary cultured LCs and in rat testis. The involvement of TGFB1 signalling in the regulation of SF1 and LRH1 expression was then validated by applying the inhibitor of the TGFB type 1 receptor (TGFBR1) SB431542. Moreover, the expression of CYP19 in testicular LCs was investigated and the production of E2 in testicular interstitial fluid (TIF) was measured. The results showed that TGFB1 especially down-regulated the expression levels of SF1 and LRH1 both in primary cultured LCs and in rat testis. The down-regulations of TGFB1 in the production of E2 in TIF and the expression of CYP19 in testicular LCs were also observed in vivo These inhibitory effects could be reversed by TGFBR1 inhibitor SB431542. Our findings suggest that TGFB1 may act through the canonical signalling pathway involving ALK5 to restrain SF1 and LRH1 accumulation and eventually attenuate Cyp19 transcription and oestrogen production in LCs.
The proliferative-crypt compartment of the intestinal epithelium is enriched in phospholipids and accumulation of phospholipids has been described in colorectal tumors. Here we hypothesize that biliary phospholipid flow could directly contribute to the proliferative power of normal and dysplastic enterocytes. We used Abcb4-/- mice which lack biliary phospholipid secretion. We first show that Abcb4-/- mice are protected against intestinal tumorigenesis. At the molecular level, the transcriptional activity of the nuclear receptor Liver Receptor Homolog-1 (Lrh1) is reduced in Abcb4-/- mice and its re-activation re-establishes a tumor burden comparable to control mice. Feeding Abcb4-/- mice a diet supplemented with phospholipids completely overcomes the intestinal tumor protective phenotype, thus corroborating the hypothesis that the absence of biliary phospholipids and not lack of Abcb4 gene per se is responsible for the protection. In turn, phospholipids cannot re-establish intestinal tumorigenesis in Abcb4-/- mice crossed with mice with intestinal specific ablation of Lrh1, a nuclear hormone receptor that is activates by phospholipids. Our data identify the key role of biliary phospholipids in sustaining intestinal mucosa proliferation and tumor progression through the activation of nuclear receptor Lrh1.
Molecular heterogeneity between primary tumors (PTs) and synchronous resected liver metastasis in colorectal cancer (CRC) has potential relevance in treatment strategies. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) may be able to increase the chances of identifying multiple molecular driver alterations, calling for therapy. The aim of the present study was to evaluate mutations in PT and synchronous resected liver metastases for patients with Kirsten rat sarcoma 2 viral oncogene homolog (KRAS) exon 2 wild-type metastatic (m)CRC who underwent chemotherapy (CT) featuring an anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) monoclonal antibody. Genomic analysis was performed on 54 lesions from 7 patients with mCRC. For each patient, a PT biopsy or a surgical specimen was obtained prior to CT, and the PT and all liver metastases resected following CT were analyzed. DNA libraries were generated using the Ion AmpliSeq Colon and Lung Cancer Panel, assessing the most frequent somatic mutations in 22 genes involved in colon tumorigenesis, and sequencing was performed on an Ion Personal Genome Machine system. A partial response was achieved in all the patients, with a median progression free survival time of 11 months (range, 3-21 months). All the patients were subjected to surgical liver metastasis resection. The median overall survival time was 31 months (range, 4-46 months). Molecular analysis of the genes correlated with the target therapy, suggesting significant intratumor heterogeneity, as revealed by the different mutational landscape of certain PTs and synchronous resected liver metastases following systemic therapy when compared with the PT prior to treatment. In particular, the loss and acquisition of mutations in KRAS, neuroblastoma RAS viral oncogene homolog (NRAS), tumor protein p53 (TP53), the p110α catalytic subunit of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PIK3CA), F-box/WD repeat-containing protein 7 (FBXW7) and phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) were observed. In addition, one patient developed a mucinous pattern following systemic CT. Taken together, the results of the present study demonstrated that intratumor heterogeneity is likely to affect the response to therapy, and to drive acquired resistance to targeted agents. The preliminary data also suggest a potential role for NGS in the evaluation of biological drug resistance, affecting future sequential treatment strategies.
A newborn female child was born with a congenital pigment synthesizing melanoma of the scalp. Further workup revealed metastatic disease within the liver, lungs, and left tibia. Whole exome sequencing was performed on multiple samples that revealed one somatic mutation, lysine methyltransferase 2C (KMT2C), at low allelic frequency but no v-Raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B (BRAF), NF-1 mutation. Programmed death ligand 1 was moderately expressed. Treatment was initiated with the programmed cell death protein 1 inhibitor nivolumab. The patient tolerated this treatment well with minimal toxicity. She is now over a year out from initial diagnosis, continuing on nivolumab, with stable disease.
Frizzled 6 (FZD6) encodes an integral membrane protein that functions in multiple signal transduction pathways, for example, as a receptor in Wnt/planar cell polarity (PCP) signaling pathway for polarized cell migration and organ morphogenesis. Mutations in FZD6 have been identified in a variety of tumors. In this study, the full-length cDNA of Sus scrofa FZD6 (Sfz6) was cloned and characterized. Nucleotide sequence analysis demonstrates that the Sfz6 gene encodes the 712 amino-acid (aa) protein with seven transmembrane domain. Tissue distribution analysis showed that Sfz6 mRNA is ubiquitously expressed in various tissues, being highest in kidney, moderate in jejunum, ileum, colon, liver, and spleen. However, FZD6 protein is highly expressed in the heart and there was no significant difference in other tissues. The relative abundance and localization of FZD6 protein in jejunum along the crypt-villus axis was determined by Western blot and immunohistochemical localization. The results show that in the jejunum, FZD6 protein is highly expressed in the villus and less in the crypt cells. Cellular proliferation and viability assays indicate that knockdown of FZD6 with small interfering RNAs (siRNA) significantly reduced the cell viability of the intestinal porcine enterocyte cells (IPEC-J2). Furthermore, qPCR and Western blot analysis revealed that expressions of ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1 (Rac1); ras homolog gene family member A (RhoA) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase 1 (JNK1), some components of PCP signaling pathway were upregulated (P &lt; 0.05) by knockdown of FZD6 in IPEC-J2 cells. In conclusion, these results showed that FZD6 abundance in the villus was higher than that in crypt cells and knockdown of FZD6 induces PCP signal pathway components expression in IPEC-J2 cells. Our findings provide the foundation for further investigation into porcine FZD6 gene.
The orphan nuclear receptor, liver receptor homolog-1 (aka Nuclear receptor subfamily 5, Group A, Member 2 (Nr5a2)), is widely expressed in mammalian tissues, and its ovarian expression is restricted to granulosa cells of activated follicles. We employed the floxed Nr5a2 (Nr5a2f/f) mutant mouse line and two granulosa-specific Cre lines, Anti-Müllerian hormone receptor- 2 (Amhr2Cre) and transgenic cytochrome P450 family 19 subfamily A polypeptide 1 (tgCyp19Cre), to develop two tissue- and time-specific Nr5a2 depletion models: Nr5a2Amhr2-/- and Nr5a2Cyp19-/-. In the Nr5a2Cyp19-/- ovaries, Nr5a2 was depleted in mural granulosa, but not cumulus cells. We induced follicular development in mutant and wild-type (control, CON) mice with equine chorionic gonadotropin followed 44 h later treatment with human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) to induce ovulation. Both Nr5a2Amhr2-/- and Nr5a2Cyp19-/- cumulus-oocyte complexes underwent a reduced degree of expansion in vitro relative to wild-type mice. We found downregulation of epiregulin (Ereg), amphiregulin (Areg), betacellulin (Btc) and tumor necrosis factor stimulated gene-6 (Tnfaip6) transcripts in Nr5a2Amhr2-/- and Nr5a2Cyp19-/- ovaries. Tnfaip6 protein abundance, by quantitative immunofluorescence, was likewise substantially reduced in the Nr5a2-depleted model. Transcript abundance for connexin 43 (Gja1) in granulosa cells was lower at 0 h and maximum at 8 h post-hCG in both Nr5a2Amhr2-/- and Nr5a2Cyp19-/- follicles, while Gja1 protein was not different prior to the ovulatory signal, but elevated at 8 h in Nr5a2Amhr2-/- and Nr5a2Cyp19-/- follicles. In both mutant genotypes, oocytes can mature in vivo and resulting embryos were capable of proceeding to blastocyst stagein vitro. We conclude that Nr5a2 is essential for cumulus expansion in granulosa cells throughout follicular development. The disruption of Nr5a2 in follicular somatic cells does not affect the capacity of the oocyte to be fertilized by intracytoplasmic sperm injection.
Daytime restricted feeding (2 h of food access from 12.00 to 14.00 hours for 3 weeks) is an experimental protocol that modifies the relationship between metabolic networks and the circadian molecular clock. The precise anatomical locus that controls the biochemical and physiological adaptations to optimise nutrient use is unknown. We explored the changes in liver oxidative lipid handling, such as β-oxidation and its regulation, as well as adaptations in the lipoprotein profile. It was found that daytime restricted feeding promoted an elevation of circulating ketone bodies before mealtime, an altered hepatic daily rhythmicity of 14CO2 production from radioactive palmitic acid, and an up-regulation of the fatty acid oxidation activators, the α-subunit of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), the deacetylase silent mating type information regulation homolog 1, and the transcriptional factor PPARγ-1α coactivator. An increased localisation of phosphorylated α-subunit of AMPK in the periportal hepatocytes was also observed. Liver hepatic lipase C, important for lipoprotein transformation, showed a change of daily phase with a peak at the time of food access. In serum, there was an increase of LDL, which was responsible for a net elevation of circulating cholesterol. We conclude that our results indicate an enhanced fasting response in the liver during daily synchronisation to food access, which involves altered metabolic and cellular control of fatty acid oxidation as well a significant elevation of serum LDL. These adaptations could be part of the metabolic input that underlies the expression of the food-entrained oscillator.
Our previous study had suggested Tribbles homolog 3 (TRB3) might be involved in metabolic syndrome via adipose tissue. Given prior studies, we sought to determine whether TRB3 plays a major role in adipocytes and adipose tissue with beneficial metabolic effects in obese and diabetic rats. Fully differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes were incubated to induce insulin resistant adipocytes. Forty male Sprague-Dawley rats were all fed high-fat (HF) diet. Type 2 diabetic rat model was induced by high-fat diet and low-dose streptozotocin (STZ). Compared with control group, in insulin resistant adipocytes, protein levels of insulin receptor substrate-1(IRS-1), glucose transporter 4(GLUT4) and phosphorylated-AMP-activated protein kinase (p-AMPK)were reduced, TRB3 protein level and triglyceride level were significantly increased, glucose uptake was markedly decreased. TRB3 silencing alleviated adipocytes insulin resistance. With TRB3 gene silencing, protein levels of IRS-1, GLUT4 and p-AMPK were significantly increased in adipocytes. TRB3 gene silencing decreased blood glucose, ameliorated insulin sensitivity and adipose tissue remodeling in diabetic rats. TRB3 silencing decreased triglyceride, increased glycogen simultaneously in diabetic epididymal and brown adipose tissues (BAT). Consistently, p-AMPK levels were increased in diabetic epididymal adipose tissue, and BAT after TRB3-siRNA treatment. TRB3silencing increased phosphorylation of Akt in liver, and improved liver insulin resistance.
Human MutT homolog 1 (MTH1) detoxifies the oxidized DNA precursor 8-oxo-2'-deoxyguanosine-5'-triphosphate and serves a tumor suppressive role in distinct types of cancer. In the present study, the expression of MTH1 was examined in various subtypes of breast cancer, and the effect of its suppression on breast cancer growth was characterized in vitro and in vivo. MTH1 mRNA and protein levels were assessed using the reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry. The effect of MTH1 expression on the proliferation of breast cancer cells was investigated in vitro using Cell Counting Kit-8 and colony formation assays, and in vivo using breast cancer cell line xenografts in mice. The toxicity of the MTH1 inhibitor TH588 was investigated in nude mice. A marked increase in MTH1 protein and mRNA levels was demonstrated in breast cancer tissues compared with the non-cancerous control. However, no apparent differences in MTH1 expression were observed between distinct molecular subtypes of breast cancer. MTH1 overexpression was demonstrated to be independent of patient age, tumor size and lymph node metastasis. Inhibition of MTH1 decreased cancer cell viability and the clonogenic potential of cancer cells in a dose-dependent manner. These results were confirmed by decreased in vivo proliferation of MCF7, MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-453 cancer cell lines, representing distinct subtypes of breast cancer. Although inhibition of MTH1 activity decreased xenograft growth in mice, no major adverse effects of TH588 were detected on the basis of blood biochemistry, and liver and kidney function. The results of the present study suggested that MTH1 is overexpressed in the majority of breast cancers, independent of the molecular identity and clinicopathological features of the tumor, including patient age, tumor size and lymph node metastasis. Inhibition of MTH1 activity suppressed the growth of three subtypes of breast cancer, including luminal, basal-like and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive, in vitro and in vivo. Treatment with the MTH1 inhibitor appears to be safe; however, further studies are required prior to the clinical use of MTH1 inhibitors.
Metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains a mostly incurable disease. The fact that the identity of the mechanisms that regulate metastasis in HCC is known hampers the development of anti-metastatic therapies. Currently, there is no effective treatment for HCC once it is progressed to metastatic stage. Therefore, further study to elucidate the molecular mechanism underlying the metastasis of HCC is urgently required for the improvement of HCC treatment. Here, we describes actin gamma smooth muscle 2 (ACTG2) over-express in HCC and demonstrates high-expression of ACTG2 as a promising therapeutic target in HCC metastasis. The use of shRNA to knock-down ACTG2 impaired cells migration and invasion in vitro. Moreover, silencing of ACTG2 causes almost complete inhibition of metastasis in vivo. In contrast, overexpression ACTG2 significantly enforces HCC cells migration and metastasis. Finally, ACTG2 boosts the metastatic potential of HCC cells in a Notch homolog 1 (Notch1) dependent manner. Collectively, our study reveals a critical role of ACTG2 in HCC tumor metastasis, and renders it a novel target for the treatment of HCC.
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common type of liver cancer in humans. The focal adhesion tyrosine kinase (FAK) is often over-expressed in human HCC and FAK inhibition may reduce HCC cell invasiveness. However, the anti-oncogenic effect of FAK knockdown in HCC cells remains to be clarified. We found that FAK depletion in HCC cells reduced in vitro and in vivo tumorigenicity, by inducing G2/M arrest and apoptosis, decreasing anchorage-independent growth, and modulating the expression of several cancer-related genes. Among these genes, we showed that FAK silencing decreased transcription and nuclear localization of enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) and its tri-methylation activity on lysine 27 of histone H3 (H3K27me3). Accordingly, FAK, EZH2 and H3K27me3 were concomitantly upregulated in human HCCs compared to non-tumor livers. In vitro experiments demonstrated that FAK affected EZH2 expression and function by modulating, at least in part, p53 and E2F2/3 transcriptional activity. Moreover, FAK silencing downregulated both EZH2 binding and histone H3K27me3 levels at the promoter of its target gene NOTCH2. Finally, we found that pharmacological inhibition of FAK activity resembled these effects although milder. In summary, we demonstrate that FAK depletion reduces HCC cell growth by affecting cancer-promoting genes including the pro-oncogene EZH2. Furthermore, we unveil a novel unprecedented FAK/EZH2 crosstalk in HCC cells, thus identifying a targetable network paving the way for new anticancer therapies.
Since interactome analysis of diseases can provide candidate biomarker panel related to the diseases, in this research, protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analysis is used to introduce the involved crucial proteins in Gastric adenocarcinoma (GA).
Gastric adenocarcinoma (GA) is the most common type of stomach cancer. There is no efficient diagnostic molecular method for GA.
Applying Cytoscape software 3.4.0 and String Database, the PPI network was constructed for 200 genes. Based on centrality parameters, the critical nodes were screened. Gene ontology of the key proteins for pathway analysis and molecular function processing were done and the highlighted pathways and activities were discussed.
Among 200 initial genes, 141 genes were included in a main connected network. Seven crucial proteins, including tumor protein p53, epidermal growth factor receptor, albumin, v-erb-b2 erythroblastic leukemia viral oncogene homolog 2, neuro/glioblastoma derived oncogene homolog (avian), v-akt murine thymoma viral oncogene homolog 1, v-src sarcoma (Schmidt-Ruppin A-2) viral oncogene homolog (avian) and catenin (cadherin-associated protein), beta 1, 88kDa, and Myogenic differentiation 1, were introduced as key nodes of the network. These identified proteins are mostly involved in pathways and activities related to cancer.
In conclusion, the finding is corresponding to the significant roles of these introduced proteins in GA disease. This protein panel may be a useful probe in the management of GA.
BACKGROUND In clinics, patients with type 2 diabetes complicated with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) have been shown to receive significant improvements in blood glucose levels, lipid levels, and liver function after sitagliptin treatment, although the mechanism of drug action remains poorly understood. This study investigated the possible mechanism of sitagliptin on lipid metabolism of NAFLD mice. MATERIAL AND METHODS Male C57/BL6 mice were induced for NAFLD via 16 weeks of a high-fat diet, and were treated with 15 mg/kg/day sitagliptin for 16 consecutive weeks. Blood lipid levels were measured and samples were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) and oil red staining for liver pathology and lipid deposition. Serum levels of fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-9 and FGF-21 were quantified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-α, and cAMP reactive element binding homolog (CREBH) were measured by Western blotting, while fatty acid synthase and carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 (CPT1) mRNA levels were assayed by RT-PCR. RESULTS Compared to the control group, the NAFLD model mice had liver fatty disease, lower serum FGF-21 and FGF-19 levels, elevated serum lipid levels, depressed PPAR-α, CREBH, and CPT1 expression, and enhanced FAS expression (p&lt;0.05). Sitagliptin treatment depressed blood lipid levels, increased serum FGF-21 and FGF-19 levels, PPAR-α, CREBH, and CPT1 expression, and suppressed FAS expression (p&lt;0.05). CONCLUSIONS Sitagliptin can protect liver tissue and modulate lipid metabolism in NAFLD mice via elevating FGF-21 and FGF-19, upregulating liver PPAR-a and CREBH levels, and mediating expression levels of key enzymes for lipid metabolism.
Nearly all older men will experience lower urinary tract symptoms associated with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), the etiology of which is not well understood. We have generated Stk11
                        CKO
                     mice by conditional deletion of the liver kinase B1 (LKB1) tumor suppressor gene, Stk11 (serine threonine kinase 11), in the fetal Müllerian duct mesenchyme (MDM), the caudal remnant of which is thought to be assimilated by the urogenital sinus primordial mesenchyme in males during fetal development. We show that MDM cells contribute to the postnatal stromal cells at the dorsal aspect of the prostatic urethra by lineage tracing. The Stk11
                        CKO
                     mice develop prostatic hyperplasia with bladder outlet obstruction, most likely because of stromal expansion. The stromal areas from prostates of Stk11
                        CKO
                     mice, with or without significant expansion, were estrogen receptor positive, which is consistent with both MD mesenchyme-derived cells and the purported importance of estrogen receptors in BPH development and/or progression. In some cases, stromal hyperplasia was admixed with epithelial metaplasia, sometimes with keratin pearls, consistent with squamous cell carcinomas. Mice with conditional deletion of both Stk11 and Pten developed similar features as the Stk11
                        CKO
                     mice, but at a highly accelerated rate, often within the first few months after birth. Western blot analyses showed that the loss of LKB1 and phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN) induces activation of the phospho-5' adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase and phospho-AKT serine/threonine kinase 1 signaling pathways, as well as increased total and active β-catenin. These results suggest that activation of these signaling pathways can induce hyperplasia of the MD stroma, which could play a significant role in the etiology of human BPH.
Uncontrolled inflammatory response highlights the central theme of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), a growing global pandemic. Hepatocytes and macrophages represent two major sources of hepatic inflammation during NASH pathogenesis, contributing to excessive synthesis of proinflammatory mediators. The epigenetic mechanism that accounts for the activation of hepatocytes and macrophages in this process remains obscure. Here, we report that compared to wild-type littermates, mice with a deficiency in the histone H3K9 methyltransferase suppressor of variegation 39 homolog 2 (Suv39h2, knockout) exhibited a less severe form of NASH induced by feeding with a high-fat, high-carbohydrate diet. Pro-NASH stimuli increased Suv39h2 expression in cell culture, in mice, and in human livers. In hepatocytes, Suv39h2 bound to the Sirt1 gene promoter and repressed Sirt1 transcription. Suv39h2 deficiency normalized Sirt1 expression, allowing nuclear factor kappa B/p65 to become hypoacetylated and thus dampening nuclear factor kappa B-dependent transcription of proinflammatory mediators. In macrophages, Suv39h2-mediated repression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma transcription favored a proinflammatory M1 phenotype over an anti-inflammatory M2 phenotype, thereby elevating hepatic inflammation.
Suv39h2 plays a pivotal role in the regulation of inflammatory response in hepatocytes and macrophages, contributing to NASH pathogenesis. (Hepatology 2017;65:1904-1919).
The phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) deleted on chromosome 10 plays an important role in regulating T cell activation during inflammatory response. Activation of β-catenin is crucial for maintaining immune homeostasis. This study investigates the functional roles and molecular mechanisms by which PTEN-β-catenin signaling promotes regulatory T cell (Treg) induction in a mouse model of liver ischemia/reperfusion injury (IRI). We found that mice with myeloid-specific phosphatase and tensin homolog knockout (PTENM-KO ) exhibited reduced liver damage as evidenced by decreased levels of serum alanine aminotransferase, intrahepatic macrophage trafficking, and proinflammatory mediators compared with the PTEN-proficient (floxed phosphatase and tensin homolog [PTENFL/FL ]) controls. Disruption of myeloid PTEN-activated b-catenin promoted peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ)-mediated Jagged-1/Notch signaling and induced forkhead box P3 (FOXP3)1 Tregs while inhibiting T helper 17 cells. However, blocking of Notch signaling by inhibiting γ-secretase reversed myeloid PTEN deficiency-mediated protection in ischemia/reperfusion-triggered liver inflammation with reduced FOXP3+ and increased retinoid A receptor-related orphan receptor gamma t-mediated interleukin 17A expression in ischemic livers. Moreover, knockdown of β-catenin or PPARγ in PTEN-deficient macrophages inhibited Jagged-1/Notch activation and reduced FOXP3+ Treg induction, leading to increased proinflammatory mediators in macrophage/T cell cocultures. In conclusion, our findings demonstrate that PTEN-β-catenin signaling is a novel regulator involved in modulating Treg development and provides a potential therapeutic target in liver IRI.

Reduced expression of the Indy ("I am Not Dead, Yet") gene in lower organisms promotes longevity in a manner akin to caloric restriction. Deletion of the mammalian homolog of Indy (mIndy, Slc13a5) encoding for a plasma membrane-associated citrate transporter expressed highly in the liver, protects mice from high-fat diet-induced and aging-induced obesity and hepatic fat accumulation through a mechanism resembling caloric restriction. We studied a possible role of mIndy in human hepatic fat metabolism. In obese, insulin-resistant patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, hepatic mIndy expression was increased and mIndy expression was also independently associated with hepatic steatosis. In nonhuman primates, a 2-year high-fat, high-sucrose diet increased hepatic mIndy expression. Liver microarray analysis showed that high mIndy expression was associated with pathways involved in hepatic lipid metabolism and immunological processes. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) was identified as a regulator of mIndy by binding to its cognate receptor. Studies in human primary hepatocytes confirmed that IL-6 markedly induced mIndy transcription through the IL-6 receptor and activation of the transcription factor signal transducer and activator of transcription 3, and a putative start site of the human mIndy promoter was determined. Activation of the IL-6-signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 pathway stimulated mIndy expression, enhanced cytoplasmic citrate influx, and augmented hepatic lipogenesis in vivo. In contrast, deletion of mIndy completely prevented the stimulating effect of IL-6 on citrate uptake and reduced hepatic lipogenesis. These data show that mIndy is increased in liver of obese humans and nonhuman primates with NALFD. Moreover, our data identify mIndy as a target gene of IL-6 and determine novel functions of IL-6 through mINDY.
Targeting human mINDY may have therapeutic potential in obese patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. German Clinical Trials Register: DRKS00005450. (Hepatology 2017;66:616-630).
Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) is a vasoprotective lipid mediator. About two thirds of plasma S1P rides on high-density lipoprotein (HDL), and several pleiotropic properties of HDL have been ascribed to S1P. In human subjects, CETP (cholesteryl ester transfer protein) greatly influences HDL quantities. In this study, we attempted to elucidate the roles of CETP in the metabolism of S1P.
We overexpressed CETP in mice that lacked CETP and found that CETP overexpression decreased the HDL level but failed to modulate the levels of S1P and apolipoprotein M (apoM), a carrier of S1P, in the total plasma. We observed, however, that the distribution of S1P and apoM shifted from HDL to apoB-containing lipoproteins. When we administered C17S1P bound to apoM-containing lipoprotein, C17S1P and apoM were rapidly transferred to apoB-containing lipoproteins in CETP-overexpressing mice. When HDL containing C17S1P was mixed with low-density lipoprotein ex vivo, C17S1P shifted to the low-density lipoprotein fraction independent of the presence of CETP. Concordant with these results, apoM was distributed mainly to the same fraction as apo AI in a CETP-deficient subject, although apoM was also detected in apo AI-poor fractions in a corresponding hypercholesterolemia subject. About the bioactivities of S1P carried on each lipoprotein, S1P riding on apoB-containing lipoproteins induced the phosphorylation of Akt (AKT8 virus oncogene cellular homolog) and eNOS (endothelial nitric oxide synthase) in human umbilical vein endothelial cells, and CETP overexpression increased insulin secretion and sensitivity, which was inhibited by an S1P receptor 1 or 3 antagonist.
CETP modulates the distribution of S1P among lipoproteins, which affects the bioactivities of S1P.
Liver diseases are major global health problems. Ginseng extract has antioxidant, immune-modulatory and anti-inflammatory activities. This study investigated the effect of ginseng extract on carbon tetrachloride (CCl4)-induced liver fibrosis in rats.
Male Wistar rats were divided into four groups: control group, ginseng group, CCl4 group and CCl4 + ginseng group. Liver injury was induced by the intraperitoneal (I.P) injection of 3 ml/kg CCl4 (30% in olive oil) weekly for 8 weeks. The control group was I.P injected with olive oil. The expression of genes encoding transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β), type I TGF-β receptor (TβR-1), type II TGF-β receptor (TβR-II), mothers against decapentaplegic homolog 2 (Smad2), Smad3, Smad4, matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP2), MMP9, tissue inhibitor matrix metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1), Collagen 1a2 (Col1a2), Collagen 3a1 (Col3a1), interleukin-8 (IL-8) and interleukin -10 (IL-10) were measured by real-time PCR.
Treatment with ginseng extract decreased hepatic fat deposition and lowered hepatic reticular fiber accumulation compared with the CCl4 group. The CCl4 group showed a significant increase in hepatotoxicity biomarkers and up-regulation of the expression of genes encoding TGF-β, TβR-I, TβR-II, MMP2, MMP9, Smad-2,-3, -4, and IL-8 compared with the control group. However, CCl4 administration resulted in the significant down-regulation of IL-10 mRNA expression compared with the control group. Interestingly, ginseng extract supplementation completely reversed the biochemical markers of hepatotoxicity and the gene expression alterations induced by CCl4.
ginseng extract had an anti-fibrosis effect via the regulation of the TGF-β1/Smad signaling pathway in the CCl4-induced liver fibrosis model. The major target was the inhibition of the expression of TGF-β1, Smad2, and Smad3.
The fibronectin type III domain containing 5 (FNDC5)/Irisin, a novel energy-regulating hormone, is associated with lipid and carbohydrate metabolism. It is produced in low amounts by normal hepatic tissue, while in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), in which aberrant de novo lipogenesis (DNL) occurs, the hepatic expression of FNDC5/Irisin is still unknown. The gene expression of FNDC5/Irisin, associated to key regulators of DNL, inflammation and cancer progression was evaluated in liver tissue of 18 patients with HCC undergoing liver transplantation and of 18 deceased donors. Hepatic mRNA expression of FNDC5/Irisin and stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD-1), main enzymatic regulator of DNL, were significantly higher in HCC patients than in donors (p&lt;0.0001 and p=0.015, respectively). The hepatic mRNA expression of the neurogenic locus notch homolog protein 1 (NOTCH1) tended to be higher in HCC patients than in donors (p=0.06). Only in HCC patients, hepatic FNDC5/Irisin strongly correlated with the transcription factor sterol regulatory element-binding factor 1, SCD-1, NOTCH1, tumor necrosis factor-α and Interleukin-6 mRNA expression. Further, in HCC patients, FNDC5/Irisin mRNA tended to correlate to plasma lipid profile namely triglycerides, palmitic/linoleic acid and polyunsaturated fatty acid/saturated fatty acid ratios. In conclusion, HCC-liver tissue over-expressed FNDC5/Irisin in association with gene expression of mediators involved in lipogenesis, inflammation and cancer, suggesting a possible protective role of the hormone from the liver damage.
Type 2 diabetes (T2DM) and obesity are frequently associated with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and with an elevated cancer incidence. The molecular mechanisms of carcinogenesis in this context are only partially understood. High blood insulin levels are typical in early T2DM and excessive insulin can cause elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and genomic instability. ROS are important for various cellular functions in signaling and host defense. However, elevated ROS formation is thought to be involved in cancer induction. In the molecular events from insulin receptor binding to genomic damage, some signaling steps have been identified, pointing at the PI3K/AKT pathway. For further elucidation Phosphatase and Tensin homolog (Pten), a tumour suppressor phosphatase that plays a role in insulin signaling by negative regulation of PI3K/AKT and its downstream targets, was investigated here. Dihydroethidium (DHE) staining was used to detect ROS formation in immortalized human hepatocytes. Comet assay and micronucleus test were performed to investigate genomic damage in vitro. In liver samples, DHE staining and western blot detection of HSP70 and HO-1 were performed to evaluate oxidative stress response. DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) were detected by immunohistostaining. Inhibition of PTEN with the pharmacologic inhibitor VO-OHpic resulted in increased ROS production and genomic damage in a liver cell line. Knockdown of Pten in a mouse model yielded increased oxidative stress levels, detected by ROS levels and expression of the two stress-proteins HSP70 and HO-1 and elevated genomic damage in the liver, which was significant in mice fed with a high fat diet. We conclude that PTEN is involved in oxidative stress and genomic damage induction in vitro and that this may also explain the in vivo observations. This further supports the hypothesis that the PI3K/AKT pathway is responsible for damaging effects of high levels of insulin.
Insulin is known mainly for its effects in peripheral tissues, such as the liver, skeletal muscles and adipose tissue, where the activation of the insulin receptor (IR) has both short-term and long-term effects. Insulin and the IR are also present in the brain, and since there is evidence that neuronal insulin signaling regulates synaptic plasticity and that it is impaired in disease, this pathway might be the key to protection or reversal of symptoms, especially in Alzheimer's disease. However, there are controversies about the importance of the neuronal IR, partly because biophysical data on its activation and signaling are much less complete than for the peripheral IR. This review briefly summarizes the neuronal IR signaling in health and disease, and then focuses on known differences between the neuronal and peripheral IR with regard to alternative splicing and glycosylation, and lack of data with respect to phosphorylation and membrane subdomain localization. Particularities in the neuronal IR itself and its environment may have consequences for downstream signaling and impact synaptic plasticity. Furthermore, establishing the relative importance of insulin signaling through IR or through hybrids with its homolog, the insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor, is crucial for evaluating the consequences of brain IR activation. An improved biophysical understanding of the neuronal IR may help predict the consequences of insulin-targeted interventions.
Ovarian metastases from colorectal cancer (OM-CRC) often are unresponsive to chemotherapy and are associated with poor survival. To the authors' knowledge, the clinicopathologic and genomic predictors of OM-CRC are poorly characterized and optimal clinical management remains unclear.
Women with a histopathological diagnosis of OM-CRC who were treated at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center from 1999 to 2015 were identified. Next-generation somatic mutation profiling (Memorial Sloan Kettering-Integrated Mutation Profiling of Actionable Cancer Targets [MSK-IMPACT]) was performed on 38 OM-CRC cases, including 21 matched tumor pairs/trios. Regression models were used to analyze variables associated with progression-free survival and overall survival (OS).
Kirsten Rat Sarcoma Viral Oncogene Homolog (KRAS), SMAD family member 4 (SMAD4), and neurotrophic receptor tyrosine kinase 1 (NTRK1) mutations were more frequent in cases of OM-CRC than in instances of CRC occurring without OM. SMAD4 and lysine methyltransferase 2D (KMT2D) mutations were associated with reduced OS. Matched multisite tumor sequencing did not identify OM-specific genomic alterations. Of the 195 patients who underwent oophorectomy for OM-CRC (median age, 49 years with a progression-free survival of 9.4 months and an OS of 23 months from oophorectomy), 76% had extraovarian metastasis (EOM). In multivariable analysis, residual disease after surgery (R2 resection) was associated with worse survival. Patients with EOM were less likely to achieve R0/R1 surgical resection status (complete macroscopic resection without clinical/radiological evidence of disease) (48% vs 94%). However, if R0/R1 resection status was achieved, both patients with (35.9 months vs 12 months) and without (43.2 months vs 14.5 months) EOM were found to have better OS. Among 114 patients with R0/R1 resection status, 23 (20%) had no disease recurrence, including 10 patients (9%) with &gt; 3 years of follow-up.
Loss-of-function alterations in SMAD4 are frequent and predictive of worse survival in patients with OM-CRC. Similar to oligometastatic CRC to the lung or liver, surgical resection of OM-CRC is associated with a better outcome only if all macroscopic metastatic disease is resected.

Lipotoxicity caused by saturated fatty acids (SFAs) induces tissue damage and inflammation in metabolic disorders. SCD1 (stearoyl-coenzyme A desaturase 1) converts SFAs to mono-unsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) that are incorporated into triglycerides and stored in lipid droplets. SCD1 thus helps protect hepatocytes from lipotoxicity and its reduced expression is associated with increased lipotoxic injury in cultured hepatic cells and mouse models. To further understand the role of SCD1 in lipotoxicity, we examined the regulation of Scd1 in hepatic cells treated with palmitate, and found that NR1H/LXR (nuclear receptor subfamily 1 group H) ligand, GW3965, induced Scd1 expression and lipid droplet formation to improve cell survival. Surprisingly, ULK1/ATG1 (unc-51 like kinase) played a critical role in protecting hepatic cells from SFA-induced lipotoxicity via a novel mechanism that did not involve macroautophagy/autophagy. Specific loss of Ulk1 blocked the induction of Scd1 gene transcription by GW3965, decreased lipid droplet formation, and increased apoptosis in hepatic cells exposed to palmitate. Knockdown of ULK1 increased RPS6KB1 (ribosomal protein S6 kinase, polypeptide 1) signaling that, in turn, induced NCOR1 (nuclear receptor co-repressor 1) nuclear uptake, interaction with NR1H/LXR, and recruitment to the Scd1 promoter. These events abrogated the stimulation of Scd1 gene expression by GW3965, and increased lipotoxicity in hepatic cells. In summary, we have identified a novel autophagy-independent role of ULK1 that regulates NR1H/LXR signaling, Scd1 expression, and intracellular lipid homeostasis in hepatic cells exposed to a lipotoxic environment.
Tangshen formula (TSF), a well-prescribed traditional Chinese formula, has been used in the treatment of diabetic nephropathy. However, whether TSF ameliorates dyslipidemia and liver injury associated with diabetes remains unclear. In this study, we examined the effects of TSF on lipid profiles and hepatic steatosis in db/db mice. For this purpose, 8‑week-old db/db mice were treated with TSF or saline for 12 weeks via gavage and db/m mice were used as controls. Body weight and blood glucose levels were monitored weekly and bi-weekly, respectively. Blood samples were obtained for the analysis of lipids and enzymes related to hepatic function, and liver tissues were analyzed by histology, immunohistochemistry and molecular examination. The results revealed that TSF markedly reduced body weight, liver index [liver/body weight (LW/BW)] and improved lipid profiles, hepatic function and steatosis in db/db mice. TSF induced the phosphoralation of AMP-activated protein kinase and inhibited the activity of sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 together with the inhibition of the expression of genes involved in de novo lipogenesis (DNL) and gluconeogenesis, such as fatty acid synthase (FAS), acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), stearoyl CoA desaturase 1 (SCD1), glucose-6-phosphatase (G6pc) and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase 1 (Pck1). Additionally, the silent mating type information regulation 2 homolog 1 (Sirt1)/peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα)/malonyl-CoA decarboxylase (MLYCD) cascade was potently activated by TSF in the liver and skeletal muscle of db/db mice, which led to enhanced fatty acid oxidation. These findings demonstrated that TSF attenuated hepatic fat accumulation and steatosis in db/db mice by inhibiting lipogenesis and augmenting fatty acid oxidation.
The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) is now recognized as an important physiological regulator in the immune and reproductive systems, and in the development of the liver and vascular system. AhR regulates cell cycle, cell proliferation, and differentiation through interacting with other signaling pathways, like estrogen receptor α (ERα), androgen receptor (AR), and Notch signaling. In the present study, we investigated Notch and estrogen signaling in AhR-/- mice. We found low fertility with degenerative changes in the testes, germ cell apoptosis, and a reduced number of early spermatids. There was no change in aromatase, AR, ERα, or ERβ expression in the testis and no detectable change in serum estrogen levels. However, expression of Notch receptors (Notch1 and Notch3) and their target Hairy and Enhancer of Split homolog 1 (HES1) was reduced. In addition, the testosterone level was slightly reduced in the serum. In the mammary fat pad, AhR appeared to regulate estrogen signaling because, in AhR-/- males, there was significant growth of the mammary ducts with high expression of ERα in the ductal epithelium. The enhanced mammary ductal growth appears to be related to overexpression of ERα accompanied by a high proliferation index, whereas the reduced fertility appears to be related defects in Notch signaling that leads to reduced expression of HES1 and, consequently, early maturation of spermatocytes and a depletion of primary spermatids. Previous reports have indicated that AhR pathway is associated with infertility in men. Our results provide a mechanistic explanation for this defect.
Sirtuin1 (Sirt1; mammalian homolog of Saccharomyces cerevisiae enzyme Sir2) is a transcriptional and transactivational regulator of murine farnesoid X receptor (Fxr), which is the primary bile acid (BA) sensor, and critical regulator of BA metabolism in physiological and pathophysiological conditions. Previous studies have suggested compromised Sirt1 expression in rodent models of cholestatic liver injury. We hypothesized that Sirt1 could be potentially targeted to alleviate cholestatic liver injury. In cultured primary human hepatocytes, SIRT1 messenger RNA was down-regulated after GCA treatment, potentially through induction of microRNA (miR)-34a, whereas tauroursodeoxycholic acid induced SIRT1 expression without affecting miR-34a expression. Sirt1 expression was also significantly down-regulated in three mouse models of liver injury (bile duct ligation, 1% cholic acid [CA] fed, and the Mdr2-/- mouse). Mice fed CA diet also demonstrated hepatic FXR hyperacetylation and induction of the Janus kinase/p53 pathway. Mice fed a CA diet and concurrently administered the Sirt1 activator, SRT1720 (50 mg/kg/day, orally), demonstrated 40% and 45% decrease in plasma alanine aminotransferase and BA levels, respectively. SRT1720 increased hepatic BA hydrophilicity by increasing tri- and tetrahydroxylated and decreasing the dihydroxylated BA fraction. SRT1720 administration also inhibited hepatic BA synthesis, potentially through ileal fibroblast growth factor 15- and Fxr-mediated inhibition of cytochrome p450 (Cyp) 7a1 and Cyp27a1, along with increased hepatic BA hydroxylation in association with Cyp2b10 induction. SRT1720 administration significantly induced renal multidrug resistance-associated protein 2 and 4, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-α, and constitutive androstance receptor expression along with ∼2-fold increase in urinary BA concentrations.
SRT1720 administration alleviates cholestatic liver injury in mice by increasing hydrophilicity of hepatic BA composition and decreasing plasma BA concentration through increased BA excretion into urine. Thus, use of small-molecule activators of Sirt1 presents a novel therapeutic target for cholestatic liver injury. (Hepatology 2016;64:2151-2164).
2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) is a persistent environmental contaminant and high-affinity ligand for the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR). Increasing evidence indicates that AhR signaling contributes to wound healing, which involves the coordinated deposition and remodeling of the extracellular matrix. In the liver, wound healing is attributed to the activation of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), which mediate fibrogenesis through the production of soluble mediators and collagen type I. We recently reported that TCDD treatment increases the activation of human HSCs in vitro. The goal of this study was to determine how TCDD impacts HSC activation in vivo using a mouse model of experimental liver fibrosis. To elicit fibrosis, C57BL6/male mice were treated twice weekly for 8weeks with 0.5ml/kg carbon tetrachloride (CCl4). TCDD (20μg/kg) or peanut oil (vehicle) was administered once a week during the last 2weeks. Results indicate that TCDD increased liver-body-weight ratios, serum alanine aminotransferase activity, and hepatic necroinflammation in CCl4-treated mice. Likewise, TCDD treatment increased mRNA expression of HSC activation and fibrogenesis genes, namely α-smooth muscle actin, desmin, delta-like homolog-1, TGF-β1, and collagen type I. However, TCDD treatment did not exacerbate fibrosis, nor did it increase the collagen content of the liver. Instead, TCDD increased hepatic collagenase activity and increased expression of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-13 and the matrix regulatory proteins, TIMP-1 and PAI-1. These results support the conclusion that TCDD increases CCl4-induced liver damage and exacerbates HSC activation, yet collagen deposition and the development of fibrosis may be limited by TCDD-mediated changes in extracellular matrix remodeling.
Receptor tyrosine kinases MET and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) are critically involved in initiation of liver regeneration. Other cytokines and signaling molecules also participate in the early part of the process. Regeneration employs effective redundancy schemes to compensate for the missing signals. Elimination of any single extracellular signaling pathway only delays but does not abolish the process. Our present study, however, shows that combined systemic elimination of MET and EGFR signaling (MET knockout + EGFR-inhibited mice) abolishes liver regeneration, prevents restoration of liver mass, and leads to liver decompensation. MET knockout or simply EGFR-inhibited mice had distinct and signaling-specific alterations in Ser/Thr phosphorylation of mammalian target of rapamycin, AKT, extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2, phosphatase and tensin homolog, adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase α, etc. In the combined MET and EGFR signaling elimination of MET knockout + EGFR-inhibited mice, however, alterations dependent on either MET or EGFR combined to create shutdown of many programs vital to hepatocytes. These included decrease in expression of enzymes related to fatty acid metabolism, urea cycle, cell replication, and mitochondrial functions and increase in expression of glycolysis enzymes. There was, however, increased expression of genes of plasma proteins. Hepatocyte average volume decreased to 35% of control, with a proportional decrease in the dimensions of the hepatic lobules. Mice died at 15-18 days after hepatectomy with ascites, increased plasma ammonia, and very small livers.
MET and EGFR separately control many nonoverlapping signaling endpoints, allowing for compensation when only one of the signals is blocked, though the combined elimination of the signals is not tolerated; the results provide critical new information on interactive MET and EGFR signaling and the contribution of their combined absence to regeneration arrest and liver decompensation. (Hepatology 2016;64:1711-1724).
The cellular and molecular mechanisms of chronic rejection of transplanted organs remain obscure; however, macrophages are known to play a critical role in the injury and repair of allografts. Among multiple factors influencing macrophage infiltration to allografts, the fractalkine chemokine (C-X3-C motif) ligand 1(CX3CL1)/chemokine (C-X3-C motif) receptor 1 (CX3CR1) signaling pathway and actin cytoskeleton, which is regulated by a small guanosine-5׳-triphosphatase Ras homolog gene family member A (RhoA), are of the utmost importance. To define the role of macrophage/RhoA pathway involvement in chronic rejection, we generated mice with monocyte/macrophage-specific deletion of RhoA.
Hearts from BALB/c (H-2d) donors were transplanted into RhoAflox/flox (no Cre) and heterozygous Lyz2Cre+/-RhoAflox/flox recipients treated with cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 immunoglobulin to inhibit early T-cell response. Allografts were assessed for chronic rejection and monocyte/macrophage functions.
The deletion of RhoA inhibited macrophage infiltration, neointimal hyperplasia of vasculature, and abrogated chronic rejection of the allografts. The RhoA deletion downregulated G protein-coupled fractalkine receptor CX3CR1, which activates the RhoA pathway and controls monocyte/macrophage trafficking into the vascular endothelium. This in turn promotes, through overproliferation and differentiation of smooth muscle cells in the arterial walls, neointimal hyperplasia.
Our finding of codependence of chronic rejection on monocyte/macrophage CX3CR1/CX3CL1 and RhoA signaling pathways may lead to the development of novel anti-chronic rejection therapies.
Steroid hormones are mainly produced in adrenal glands and gonads. Because steroid hormones play vital roles in various physiological processes, replacement of deficient steroid hormones by hormone replacement therapy (HRT) is necessary for patients with adrenal and gonadal failure. In addition to HRT, tissue regeneration using stem cells is predicted to provide novel therapy. Among various stem cell types, mesenchymal stem cells can be differentiated into steroidogenic cells following ectopic expression of nuclear receptor (NR) 5A subfamily proteins, steroidogenic factor-1 (also known as adrenal 4 binding protein) and liver receptor homolog-1, with the aid of cAMP signaling. Conversely, these approaches cannot be applied to pluripotent stem cells, such as embryonic stem cells and induced pluripotent stem cells, because of poor survival following cytotoxic expression of NR5A subfamily proteins. However, if pluripotent stem cells are first differentiated through mesenchymal lineage, they can also be differentiated into steroidogenic cells via NR5A subfamily protein expression. This approach offers a potential suitable cells for future regenerative medicine and gene therapy for diseases caused by steroidogenesis deficiencies. It represents a powerful tool to investigate the molecular mechanisms involved in steroidogenesis. This article highlights our own and current research on the induction of steroidogenic cells from various stem cells. We also discuss the future direction of their clinical application.
The role of sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) in liver fibrosis or inflammation was not fully examined in human. Controversy exists which S1P receptors, S1P1 and S1P3 vs S1P2, would be importantly involved in its mechanism. To clarify these matters, 80 patients who received liver resection for hepatocellular carcinoma and 9 patients for metastatic liver tumor were enrolled. S1P metabolism was analyzed in background, non-tumorous liver tissue. mRNA levels of sphingosine kinase 1 (SK1) but not SK2 were increased in livers with fibrosis stages 3-4 compared to those with 0-2 and to normal liver. However, S1P was not increased in advanced fibrotic liver, where mRNA levels of S1P transporter spinster homolog 2 (SPNS2) but not S1P-degrading enzymes were enhanced. Furthermore, mRNA levels of S1P2 but not S1P1 or S1P3 were increased in advanced fibrotic liver. These increased mRNA levels of SK1, SPNS2 and S1P2 in fibrotic liver were correlated with α-smooth muscle actin mRNA levels in liver, and with serum ALT levels. In conclusion, S1P may be actively generated, transported to outside the cells, and bind to its specific receptor in human liver to play a role in fibrosis or inflammation. Altered S1P metabolism in fibrotic liver may be their therapeutic target.
Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a common disorder hallmarked by excessive lipid deposits. Based on our recent research on lipid droplet (LD) formation in hepatocytes, we investigated LD-associated gene regulations in NAFLD of different grades, that is, steatosis vs steatohepatitis by comparing liver biopsies from healthy controls (N = 13) and NAFLD patients (N = 102). On average, more than 700 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified of which 146 are mechanistically linked to LD formation. We identified 51 LD-associated DEGs frequently regulated in patient samples (range ≥5 to ≤102) with the liver-receptor homolog-1(NR5A2), that is, a key regulator of cholesterol metabolism being commonly repressed among 100 patients examined. With bland steatosis, notable regulations involved hypoxia-inducible lipid droplet-associated-protein and diacylglycerol-O-acyltransferase-2 renowned for their role in LD-growth. Conversely, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis-associated DEGs coded for epidermal growth factor receptor and TLR4 signaling with decreased expression of the GTPase Rab5 and the lipid phosphohydrolase PPAP2B thus highlighting adaptive responses to inflammation, LDL-mediated endocytosis and lipogenesis, respectively. Studies with steatotic primary human hepatocyte cultures demonstrated induction of LD-associated PLIN2, CIDEC, DNAAF1, whereas repressed expression of CPT1A, ANGPTL4, and PKLR informed on burdened mitochondrial metabolism. Equally, repressed expression of the B-lymphocyte chemoattractant CXCL13 and STAT4 as well as induced FGF21 evidenced amelioration of steatosis-related inflammation. In-vitro/in-vivo patient sample comparisons confirmed C-reactive protein, SOCS3, NR5A2, and SOD2 as commonly regulated. Lastly, STRING network analysis highlighted potential "druggable" targets with PLIN2, CIDEC, and hypoxia-inducible lipid droplet-associated-protein being confirmed by immunofluorescence microscopy. In conclusion, steatosis and steatohepatitis specific gene regulations informed on the pathogenesis of NAFLD to broaden the perspective of targeted therapies.
Liver fibrosis is a worldwide problem with a significant morbidity and mortality. Cryptolepis sanguinolenta (family Periplocaceae) is widely used in West African countries for the treatment of malaria, as well as for some other diseases. However, the role of C. sanguinolenta in hepatic fibrosis is still unknown. It has been reported that Methyl-CpG binding protein 2 (MeCP2) had a high expression in liver fibrosis and played a central role in its pathobiology. Interestingly, we found that a cryptolepine derivative (HZ-6h) could inhibit liver fibrosis by reducing MeCP2 expression, as evidenced by the dramatic downregulation of α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) and type I collagen alpha-1 (Col1α1) in protein levels in vitro. Meanwhile, we also found that HZ-6h could reduce the cell viability and promote apoptosis of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) treated with transforming growth factor beta 1(TGF-β1). Then, we investigated the potential molecular mechanisms and found that HZ-6h blocked Shh signaling in HSC-T6 cells, resulting in the decreased protein expression of Patched-1 (PTCH-1), Sonic hedgehog (Shh), and glioma-associated oncogene homolog 1 (GLI1). In short, these results indicate that HZ-6h inhibits liver fibrosis by downregulating MeCP2 through the Shh pathway in TGF-β1-induced HSC-T6 cells. 
The asialoglycoprotein receptor (ASGR), which is expressed mainly in hepatocytes, is downregulated in poorly differentiated hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Here we investigated the role of ASGR1 in HCC metastasis as well as the possible underlying molecular mechanisms. We found that ASGR1 was downregulated in HCC tissue compared with adjacent non-tumorous liver tissue and that lower ASGR1 expression was associated with higher TNM stage and poorer prognosis in HCC patients. ASGR1 overexpression inhibited hepatoma cell migration and invasion in vitro and in vivo, while ASGR1 knockdown had the opposite effects. Furthermore, ASGR1 interacted directly with human longevity assurance homolog 2 of yeast LAG1 (LASS2). Knockdown of LASS2 attenuated the inhibitory effects of ASGR1 on hepatoma cell migration and invasion in vitro. ASGR1 decreased V-ATPase activity in hepatoma cells, and this was reversed by LASS2 knockdown. Finally, HCC patients with low LASS2 levels had poor prognosis, while those with high ASGR1 and LASS2 levels had better prognosis. Thus, ASGR1 may act as a potential metastasis suppressor in HCC, and the combination of ASGR1 and LASS2 may help predict the prognosis of HCC patients.
The present study was to investigate clinical significance, biological functions and underlying mechanisms of BTB Domain and CNC Homolog 1(BACH1) deregulation in human colorectal cancer (CRC). The result showed that BACH1 upregulation was significantly associated with enhanced tumor invasion (P = 0.014) and gender (P = 0.028) of CRC patients. Kaplan-Meier method results showed that the overall survival of CRC patients with high BACH1 mRNA expression was markedly shorter than those with low expression (P = 0.015), and multivariate analyzes results showed that BACH1 was an independent prognostic predictor for CRC patients (P = 0.049). In vitro studies revealed that BACH1 efficiently promoted invasion and migration of CRC cell line. In vitro studies proved that the HCT116 cell stably expressing BACH1 formed significantly larger tumor nodules and remarkably accelerated tumor xenografts growth. In addition, Immunohistochemical scores of CD31 and Vimentin were significantly higher than those of the control group. Finally, correlation analysis indicated that BACH1 expression was positively correlated with C-X-C Motif Chemokine Receptor 4(CXCR4) in tumor tissues and cell lines. Together, BACH1 serves as an oncogene to promote CRC progression and an independent prognostic factor for survival and metastasis. BACH1 may inhibit the progression of CRC through BACH1/CXCR4 pathway.
In order to identify the potential pathogenesis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) developing from cirrhosis, a microarray‑based transcriptome profile was analyzed. The GSE63898 expression profile was downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus database, which included data from 228 HCC tissue samples and 168 cirrhotic tissue samples. The Robust Multi‑array Average in the Affy package of R was used for raw data processing and Student's t‑test was used to screen differentially expressed genes (DEGs). An enrichment analysis was then conducted using the Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery online tool, and the protein‑protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed using the Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes and Cytoscape. Furthermore, the MCODE plug‑in of Cytoscape was used to conduct a sub‑module analysis. A total of 634 DEGs were identified between HCC and cirrhosis, of which 165 were upregulated and 469 were downregulated. According to the cut‑off criteria, the PPI network was constructed and Jun proto‑oncogene, AP‑1 transcription factor subunit (degree, 39), Fos proto‑oncogene, AP‑1 transcription factor subunit (degree, 34) and v‑myc avian myelocytomatosis viral oncogene homolog (degree, 32) were identified as the hub nodes of the PPI network. Based on the sub‑module analysis, four specific modules were identified. In particular, module 1 was significantly enriched in the chemokine signaling pathway, and C‑X‑C motif chemokine ligand 12, C‑C motif chemokine receptor 7 (CCR7) and C‑C motif chemokine ligand 5 (CCL5) were three important proteins in this module. Module 4 was significantly enriched in chemical carcinogenesis, and cytochrome P450 family 2 subfamily E member 1, cytochrome P450 family 2 subfamily C member 9 (CYP2C9) and cytochrome P450 family 2 subfamily A member 6 (CYP2A6) were three important proteins in this module. In conclusion, the present study revealed that CCR7, CCL5, CYP2C9 and CYP2A6 are novel genes identified in the development of HCC; however, the actual functions of these genes require verification.
In mouse ovaries, liver receptor homolog-1 [nuclear receptor subfamily 5, group A, member 2 (Nr5a2)] expression is restricted to granulosa cells. Mice with Nr5a2 depletion in this cell population fail to ovulate. To determine whether Nr5a2 is essential for granulosa cell proliferation during follicular maturation, we generated granulosa-specific conditional knockout mice (genotype Nr5a2 floxed Cre-recombinase driven by the anti-Müllerian type II receptor, hereafter cKO) with Nr5a2 depletion from primary follicles forward. Proliferation in cKO granulosa cells was substantially reduced relative to control (CON) counterparts, as assessed by bromodeoxyuridine incorporation, proliferative cell nuclear antigen expression, and fluorescent-activated cell sorting. Microarray analysis revealed &gt;2000 differentially regulated transcripts between cKO and CON granulosa cells. Major gene ontology pathways disrupted were proliferation, steroid biosynthesis, female gamete formation, and ovulatory cycle. Transcripts for key cell-cycle genes, including Ccnd1, Ccnd2, Ccne1, Ccne2, E2f1, and E2f2, were in reduced abundance. Transcripts from other cell-cycle-related factors, including Cdh2, Plagl1, Cdkn1a, Prkar2b, Gstm1, Cdk7, and Pts, were overexpressed. Although the follicle-stimulating hormone and estrogen receptors were overexpressed in the cKO animals, in vivo treatment with estradiol-17β failed to rescue decreased proliferation. In vitro inactivation of Nr5a2 using the ML180 reverse agonist similarly decreased cell-cycle-related gene transcripts and downstream targets, as in cKO mice. Pharmacological inhibition of β-catenin, an Nr5a2 cofactor, decreased cyclin gene transcripts and downstream targets. Terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate nick end labeling immunofluorescence and quantitative polymerase chain reaction of pro/antiapoptotic and autophagic markers showed no differences between cKO and CON granulosa cells. Thus, Nr5a2 is essential for granulosa cell proliferation, but its depletion does not alter the frequency of apoptosis nor autophagy.
Hepatoblastoma (HB) is the most type of common pediatric liver cancer. The primary chemotherapy drug for HB is cisplatin (DDP). However, patients readily develop intrinsic and acquired resistance, and severe side effects to treatment. Sphingomyelin synthase 2 (SMS2) is a key enzyme involved in the generation of sphingomyelin (SM), which is able to regulate cell proliferation, apoptosis and differentiation. The death receptors (DRs) have important functions in DDP-induced apoptosis. However, whether SMS2 is able to modulate cell apoptosis through the DR signaling pathway remains unknown. To investigate this question, SMS2 was overexpressed in HepG2 cells and treated with 3.5 mg/l cisplatin in the present study. After 24 h, the expression of SMS2, avian myelocytomatosis viral oncogene homolog (c-Myc), DR4, DR5 and caspase-3 was analyzed. Furthermore, cell viability was quantified, and apoptosis was assessed by western blot and flow cytometry analysis as well as Cell Counting kit-8. The results of the present study revealed that overexpression of SMS2 was able to increase the expression of c-Myc, cleaved caspase-3, DR4 and DR5 compared with the control group (P&lt;0.05, n=3), and increase the levels of apoptosis in the SMS2 + DDP group, compared with the control (P&lt;0.001, n=3). These results indicate that overexpression of SMS2 is able to improve sensitivity of HepG2 cells to DDP by increasing the expression of c-Myc, DR4 and DR5 in HepG2 cells. This increased sensitivity may decrease intrinsic and acquired resistance of chemotherapy in HB, and reduce the associated severe side effects in pediatric patients.
As a member of miR-17-92 miRNA clusters, miR‑19a has been considered to regulate hepatic glycogenesis by mediating the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. However, whether miR‑19a serves an important role in gluconeogenesis in hepatocytes remains unknown. In the present study, the impact of miR‑19a on gluconeogenesis in HEP1‑6 cells and its mechanisms of action were investigated. It was observed that overexpression of miR‑19a led to decreased glucose production, accompanied by increased activation of the AKT/FOXO1 signaling pathway and downregulated expression of gluconeogenesis‑associated genes, including peroxisome proliferator‑activated receptor γ coactivator 1α, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase and glucose 6‑phosphatase in the HEP1‑6 cells transfected with the miR‑19a mimic. In contrast, suppression of miR‑19a impaired the activation of the AKT/FOXO1 signaling pathway and increased the expression of gluconeogenesis‑associated genes, accompanied by an elevated glucose production. Additionally, phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) was identified as a target of miR‑19a and participated in the miR‑19a‑mediated gluconeogenesis in hepatocytes. These findings provide mechanistic insight into the effects of miR‑19a on the regulation of the AKT/FOXO1 signaling pathway and the expression of gluconeogenesis‑associated genes. MiR‑19a may mediate gluconeogenesis in hepatocytes by downregulating PTEN expression.
Pressure overload causes cardiac fibroblast activation and transdifferentiation, leading to increased interstitial fibrosis formation and subsequently myocardial stiffness, diastolic and systolic dysfunction, and eventually heart failure. A better understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying pressure overload-induced cardiac remodeling and fibrosis will have implications for heart failure treatment strategies. The microRNA (miRNA)-221/222 family, consisting of miR-221-3p and miR-222-3p, is differentially regulated in mouse and human cardiac pathology and inversely associated with kidney and liver fibrosis. We investigated the role of this miRNA family during pressure overload-induced cardiac remodeling. In myocardial biopsies of patients with severe fibrosis and dilated cardiomyopathy or aortic stenosis, we found significantly lower miRNA-221/222 levels as compared to matched patients with nonsevere fibrosis. In addition, miRNA-221/222 levels in aortic stenosis patients correlated negatively with the extent of myocardial fibrosis and with left ventricular stiffness. Inhibition of both miRNAs during AngII (angiotensin II)-mediated pressure overload in mice led to increased fibrosis and aggravated left ventricular dilation and dysfunction. In rat cardiac fibroblasts, inhibition of miRNA-221/222 derepressed TGF-β (transforming growth factor-β)-mediated profibrotic SMAD2 (mothers against decapentaplegic homolog 2) signaling and downstream gene expression, whereas overexpression of both miRNAs blunted TGF-β-induced profibrotic signaling. We found that the miRNA-221/222 family may target several genes involved in TGF-β signaling, including JNK1 (c-Jun N-terminal kinase 1), TGF-β receptor 1 and TGF-β receptor 2, and ETS-1 (ETS proto-oncogene 1). Our findings show that heart failure-associated downregulation of the miRNA-221/222 family enables profibrotic signaling in the pressure-overloaded heart.
There is no previous study in the literature that has examined the relationship between circulating vitamin K1 (VK1) with glycemic status in type 2 diabetes (T2D). Moreover, scientific explanation for the beneficial role of VK1 supplementation in lowering glycemia in diabetes is yet to be determined. This study for the first time demonstrated that circulating VK1 was significantly lower in T2D patients compared to age-matched control subjects, and VK1 levels in T2D were significantly and inversely associated with fasting glucose and insulin resistance [homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR)], which suggest that boosting plasma VK1 may reduce the fasting glucose and insulin resistance in T2D patients. Using high-fat-diet-fed T2D animal model, this study further investigated the positive effect of VK1 supplementation on glucose metabolism and examined the underlying molecular mechanism. Results showed that VK1 supplementation [1, 3, 5 μg/kg body weight (BW), 8 weeks] dose dependently improved the glucose tolerance; decreased BW gain, fasting glucose and insulin, glycated hemoglobin, HOMA-IR and cytokine secretion (monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 and interleukin-6); and regulated the signaling pathway of hepatic glucose metabolism [sirtuin 1 (SIRT1)/AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)/phosphoinositide 3-kinase/phosphatase and tensin homolog/glucose transporter 2/glucokinase/glucose 6 phosphatase], lipid oxidation (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha/carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1A) and inflammation (nuclear factor kappa B) in T2D mice. Comparative signal silencing studies also depicted the role of SIRT1/AMPK in mediating the effect of VK1 on glucose metabolism, lipid oxidation and inflammation in high-glucose-treated cultured hepatocytes. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that circulating VK1 has a positive effect on lowering fasting glucose and insulin resistance in T2D via regulating SIRT1/AMPK signaling pathway.
Liver dual arterial blood supply (LDABS) could increase blood supply to the liver and maintain normal liver regeneration in patients with compromised portal vein. The current study attempted to examine the underlying molecular mechanisms. Male Sprague‑Dawley rats randomly received partial hepatectomy (PH) alone or PH followed by LDABS. Liver regeneration was assessed by histological examination, liver function and liver regeneration rate (LRR). Whole‑genome oligo microarray analysis was used to compare gene expression profile between rats receiving PH and rats receiving PH plus LDABS. Key genes identification was validated using a MAPK signaling polymerase chain reaction (PCR) array. The extent of liver regeneration in rats receiving PH plus LDABS was comparable to that in rats receiving PH alone. The differentially expressed genes were enriched in 12 signaling pathways in two groups. MAPK signaling pathway, NF‑kappa B signaling pathway, and Toll‑like receptor signaling pathway were involved in LDABS‑mediated liver regeneration, with Retinoblastoma 1 (Rb1), Cyclin D1, Cyclin‑dependent kinase 4, Mitogen‑activated protein kinase 10 (Mapk10) and CAMP responsive element binding protein 1 genes in the initiation phase, Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (Kras), tumor protein 53, MYC proto‑oncogene, BHLH transcription factor, Cyclin E1 and Heat shock protein family B (small) member 1 genes in the proliferation phase, Kras, Rb1, Jun proto‑oncogene, AP‑1 transcription factor subunit, Cyclin D2 and Mapk10 genes in the termination phase were identified as key genes in LDABS‑mediated liver regeneration using MAPK signaling PCR array analysis.
Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is the dominant risk factor for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). HBV X protein (HBx) plays crucial roles in HCC carcinogenesis. HBx interferes with several signaling pathways including the Notch1 pathway in HCC. In this study, we found that Notch1 was highly expressed in HCC, especially in large HCCs. Notch1 and HBx co-localized in HCC and their levels were positively correlated with each other. Notch1 expression was more elevated in HepG2.2.15 cells than that in HepG2 cells. HBx activated the Notch1 pathway in HepG2.2.15 cells. Suppression of HBx and the Notch1 pathway attenuated the growth of HepG2.2.15 cells. Notch1, ERK, and AKT pathways were inhibited after γ-secretase inhibitor treatment. Dual-specificity phosphatase 1 (DUSP1) and phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) were upregulated after γ-secretase inhibitor treatment and Hes1 inhibition. Luciferase reporter assays showed that Hes1 suppressed the promoters of DUSP1 and PTEN genes, which was reversed by γ-secretase inhibitor treatment. Western blotting demonstrated that DUSP1 dephosphorylated pERK and PTEN dephosphorylated pAKT. Collectively, we found a link among HBx, the Notch1 pathway, DUSP1/PTEN, and ERK/AKT pathways, which influenced HCC cell survival and could be a therapeutic target for HCC treatment.
Notch signaling plays an emerging role in the regulation of immune cell development and function during inflammatory response. Activation of the ras homolog gene family member A/Rho-associated protein kinase (ROCK) pathway promotes leukocyte accumulation in tissue injury. However, it remains unknown whether Notch signaling regulates ras homolog gene family member A/ROCK-mediated immune responses in liver ischemia and reperfusion (IR) injury. This study investigated intracellular signaling pathways regulated by Notch receptors in the IR-stressed liver and in vitro. In a mouse model of IR-induced liver inflammatory injury, we found that mice with myeloid-specific Notch1 knockout showed aggravated hepatocellular damage, with increased serum alanine aminotransferase levels, hepatocellular apoptosis, macrophage/neutrophil trafficking, and proinflammatory mediators compared to Notch1-proficient controls. Unlike in the controls, myeloid Notch1 ablation diminished hairy and enhancer of split-1 (Hes1) and augmented c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)/stress-activated protein kinase-associated protein 1 (JSAP1), JNK, ROCK1, and phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) activation in ischemic livers. Disruption of JSAP1 in myeloid-specific Notch1 knockout livers improved hepatocellular function and reduced JNK, ROCK1, PTEN, and toll-like receptor 4 activation. Moreover, ROCK1 knockdown inhibited PTEN and promoted Akt, leading to depressed toll-like receptor 4. In parallel in vitro studies, transfection of lentivirus-expressing Notch1 intracellular domain promoted Hes1 and inhibited JSAP1 in lipopolysaccharide-stimulated bone marrow-derived macrophages. Hes1 deletion enhanced JSAP1/JNK activation, whereas clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/CRISPR-associated protein 9-mediated JSAP1 knockout diminished ROCK1/PTEN and toll-like receptor 4 signaling.
Myeloid Notch1 deficiency activates the ras homolog gene family member A/ROCK pathway and exacerbates hepatocellular injury by inhibiting transcriptional repressor Hes1 and inducing scaffold protein JSAP1 in IR-triggered liver inflammation; our findings underscore the crucial role of the Notch-Hes1 axis as a novel regulator of innate immunity-mediated inflammation and imply the therapeutic potential for the management of organ IR injury in transplant recipients. (Hepatology 2018;67:1041-1055).
This study is to investigate the methylation status of multiple tumor suppressor 1 (p16), secreted glycoprotein 2 (SLIT2), scavenger receptor class A, member 5 putative (SCARA5), and human runt-related transcription factor 3 (Runx3) genes in the peripheral blood of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).This is a case-control study. The peripheral blood samples were collected from 25 HCC patients, 25 patients with high risk of HCC (defined as "internal control group"), and 25 healthy individuals (defined as "external control group"), respectively. Then the methylation status of p16, SLIT2, SCARA5, and Runx3 genes in the blood samples were analyzed by pyrosequencing. The relationship between the methylation and the clinical features of HCC patients were evaluated.The methylation levels in the 7 CpG loci of p16 gene in HCC patients were low and without statistically significant difference (P &gt; .05) compared to the control groups. Although the methylation levels of CpG3 and CpG4 in SLIT2 gene loci were higher than those of the control groups, there was no statistically significant difference (P &gt; .05). However, the methylation rate of CpG2 locus in SCARA5 gene in HCC patients was significantly higher (P &lt; .05). And the methylation rates of CpG1, CpG2, CpG3, CpG4, CpG5, and CpG8 in Runx3 gene in HCC patients were significantly different to that of control groups (P &lt; .05). We also have analyzed the correlations between the CpG islands methylation of Runx3 or SCARA5 genes and the age, gender, hepatitis B, liver cirrhosis, alpha fetal protein, or hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) of the HCC patients, which all showed no significant correlations (P &gt; .05).The methylation status of SCARA5 and Runx3 genes are abnormal in HCC patients, which may further be used as molecular markers for early auxiliary diagnosis of liver cancer.
Hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) are a major source of fibrogenesis in the liver, contributing to cirrhosis. When activated, HSCs transdifferentiate into myofibroblasts and undergo profound functional alterations paralleling an overhaul of the transcriptome, the mechanism of which remains largely undefined. We investigated the involvement of the class III deacetylase sirtuin [silent information regulator 1 (SIRT1)] in HSC activation and liver fibrosis. SIRT1 levels were down-regulated in the livers in mouse models of liver fibrosis, in patients with cirrhosis, and in activated HSCs as opposed to quiescent HSCs. SIRT1 activation halted, whereas SIRT1 inhibition promoted, HSC transdifferentiation into myofibroblasts. Liver fibrosis was exacerbated in mice with HSC-specific deletion of SIRT1 [conditional knockout (cKO)], receiving CCl4 (1 mg/kg) injection or subjected to bile duct ligation, compared to wild-type littermates. SIRT1 regulated peroxisome proliferator activated receptor γ (PPARγ) transcription by deacetylating enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) in quiescent HSCs. Finally, EZH2 inhibition or PPARγ activation ameliorated fibrogenesis in cKO mice. In summary, our data suggest that SIRT1 plays an essential role guiding the transition of HSC phenotypes.-Li, M., Hong, W., Hao, C., Li, L., Wu, D., Shen, A., Lu, J., Zheng, Y., Li, P., Xu, Y. SIRT1 antagonizes liver fibrosis by blocking hepatic stellate cell activation in mice.
Liver regeneration after partial hepatectomy (PH) is a complex and well-elaborated biological process whereby synchronized cell proliferation is induced in response to the loss of liver mass. Insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) signaling, which plays a crucial role in normal growth and development, is involved in the process of liver regeneration. To assess the changes in the levels of serum IGF1 and hepatic IGF1 receptor (IGF1R), we established a mouse model for PH. This also allowed us to further explore the mechanisms that participate in the regulation of liver regeneration. Serum IGF1 dramatically decreased immediately after PH, and was mildly elevated afterwards. This was also confirmed in patients who had undergone PH. Immunohistochemistry and Western blotting showed that hepatic IGF1R expression was elevated after surgery in mice. Hepatosomatic index showed a mild elevation 1 week after surgery and a marked elevation after 3 weeks. Western blotting showed increased levels of forkhead box O3 (FOXO3), but the phosphorylated forms of v-akt murine thymoma viral oncogene homolog 1 (AKT1), glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK3B) and FOXO3 were all downregulated. Our data show that the GSK3B-FOXO3 pathway is activated after PH, and this may be one of the mechanisms that lead to upregulation of hepatic IGF1R after PH. All these changes after surgery promote liver regeneration.
Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) is a malignant transformation of biliary epithelial cells. It is a slow growing tumor, but is also highly metastatic with a poor prognosis. Bile acids are known to transactivate the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) in cholangiocytes and induce cyclooxygenase-2 expression. The protein expression profiles of bile acid-treated CCA cells were studied using a proteomic approach. To elucidate the possible mechanisms involved in the bile acid-mediated enhancement of CCA cell migration, the effects of six bile acids, including cholic, deoxycholic, taurocholic, taurodeoxycholic, glycocholic and glycodeoxycholic acid, on the migration of CCA cells were examined in vitro using wound healing assays. Subsequently, the possible proteins involved in enhanced CCA cell migration were investigated using a proteomic approach. Changes to the protein expression profiles of CCA cells following bile acid treatment was examined using two-dimensional electrophoresis and mass spectrometry. The results demonstrated that cholic and deoxycholic acid significantly enhanced the migration of CCA cells, compared with the treated MMNK-1 control cells. CCA cells had 77 overexpressed protein spots following cholic acid treatment, and 50 protein spots following deoxycholic acid treatment, compared with the treated MMNK-1 control cells. Liquid chromatography tandem-mass spectrometry analysis revealed that coiled-coil domain containing 25 (CCDC25) was significantly overexpressed in cholic acid-treated CCA cells compared with in cholic acid-treated control cells. When the expression levels of CCDC25 were investigated using western blot analysis, CCDC25 was demonstrated to be highly expressed in CCA tissues, but not in the adjacent non-cancerous tissue samples. The identified proteins were further analyzed for protein-chemical interactions using STITCH version 3.1 software. CCDC25 protein was identified to be associated with Son of sevenless homolog 1 and growth factor receptor-bound protein 2, which are involved in EGFR signaling. The results of the present study demonstrated that following cholic acid treatment, CCDC25 is overexpressed in CCA cells, which is associated with significantly enhanced cell migration. This suggests that CCDC25 is a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of patients with CCA.
Apoptosis is an important defense mechanism mounted by the immune system to control virus replication. Hence, cytomegaloviruses (CMV) evolved and acquired numerous anti-apoptotic genes. The product of the human CMV (HCMV) UL36 gene, pUL36 (also known as vICA), binds to pro-caspase-8, thus inhibiting death-receptor apoptosis and enabling viral replication in differentiated THP-1 cells. In vivo studies of the function of HCMV genes are severely limited due to the strict host specificity of cytomegaloviruses, but CMV orthologues that co-evolved with other species allow the experimental study of CMV biology in vivo. The mouse CMV (MCMV) homolog of the UL36 gene is called M36, and its protein product (pM36) is a functional homolog of vICA that binds to murine caspase-8 and inhibits its activation. M36-deficient MCMV is severely growth impaired in macrophages and in vivo. Here we show that pUL36 binds to the murine pro-caspase-8, and that UL36 expression inhibits death-receptor apoptosis in murine cells and can replace M36 to allow MCMV growth in vitro and in vivo. We generated a chimeric MCMV expressing the UL36 ORF sequence instead of the M36 one. The newly generated MCMVUL36 inhibited apoptosis in macrophage lines RAW 264.7, J774A.1, and IC-21 and its growth was rescued to wild type levels. Similarly, growth was rescued in vivo in the liver and spleen, but only partially in the salivary glands of BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice. In conclusion, we determined that an immune-evasive HCMV gene is conserved enough to functionally replace its MCMV counterpart and thus allow its study in an in vivo setting. As UL36 and M36 proteins engage the same molecular host target, our newly developed model can facilitate studies of anti-viral compounds targeting pUL36 in vivo.
Insulin plays a central role in regulating metabolic homeostasis and guanine-nucleotide exchange factors of the cytohesin family have been suggested to be involved in insulin signal transduction. The Drosophila homolog of cytohesin-3, steppke, has been shown to be essential for insulin signaling during larval development. However, genetic evidence for the functional importance of cytohesin-3 in mammals is missing. We therefore analyzed the consequences of genetic cytohesin-3-deficiency on insulin signaling and function in young and aged mice, using normal chow or high-fat diet (HFD). Insulin-receptor dependent signaling events are significantly reduced in liver and adipose tissue of young cytohesin-3-deficient mice after insulin-injection, although blood glucose levels and other metabolic parameters remain normal in these animals. Interestingly, however, cytohesin-3-deficient mice showed a reduced age- and HFD-induced weight gain with a significant reduction of body fat compared to wild-type littermates. Furthermore, cytohesin-3-deficient mice on HFD displayed no alterations in energy expenditure, but had an increased lipid excretion instead, as well as a reduced expression of genes essential for bile acid synthesis. Our findings show for the first time that an intact cyth3 locus is required for full insulin signaling in mammals and might constitute a novel therapeutic target for weight reduction.
Dairy cows with fatty liver or ketosis display decreased insulin sensitivity and defects in the insulin receptor substrate (IRS)/PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. Phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) is a well-known tumor suppressor and also a negative regulator of insulin signaling and peripheral insulin sensitivity. We investigated the hypothesis that PTEN may affect the insulin pathway-mediated hepatic glucose and lipid metabolism in dairy cows. Adenovirus vectors that over-express and silence PTEN were constructed, and then transfected into hepatocytes isolated from calves to investigate the effect of PTEN on PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. PTEN silencing increased the phosphorylation of AKT and the expression of PI3K but decreased the phosphorylation of IRS1, which increased the phosphorylation levels of glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β) and expression of sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c). Increased GSK-3β phosphorylation further up-regulated expression of the key enzymes phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) and glucose-6-phosphatase (G6-Pase) involved in gluconeogenesis. Furthermore, the expression of SREBP-1c target gene fatty acid synthase (FAS) also increased significantly. We further showed that PTEN over-expression could reverse the above results. PTEN negatively regulates the enzymes involved in hepatic gluconeogenesis and lipid synthesis, which suggests that PTEN may be a therapeutic target for ketosis and fatty liver in dairy cows.
Cholangiopathies are diseases that affect cholangiocytes, the cells lining the biliary tract. Liver stem cells (LSCs) are able to differentiate into all cells of the liver and possibly influence the surrounding liver tissue by secretion of signaling molecules. One way in which cells can interact is through secretion of extracellular vesicles (EVs), which are small membrane-bound vesicles that contain proteins, microRNAs (miRNAs), and cytokines. We evaluated the contents of liver stem cell-derived EVs (LSCEVs), compared their miRNA contents to those of EVs isolated from hepatocytes, and evaluated the downstream targets of these miRNAs. We finally evaluated the crosstalk among LSCs, cholangiocytes, and human hepatic stellate cells (HSCs). We showed that LSCEVs were able to reduce ductular reaction and biliary fibrosis in multidrug resistance protein 2 (MDR2)-/- mice. Additionally, we showed that cholangiocyte growth was reduced and HSCs were deactivated in LSCEV-treated mice. Evaluation of LSCEV contents compared with EVs derived from hepatocytes showed a large increase in the miRNA, lethal-7 (let-7). Further evaluation of let-7 in MDR2-/- mice and human primary sclerosing cholangitis samples showed reduced levels of let-7 compared with controls. In liver tissues and isolated cholangiocytes, downstream targets of let-7 (identified by ingenuity pathway analysis), Lin28a (Lin28 homolog A), Lin28b (Lin28 homolog B), IL-13 (interleukin 13), NR1H4 (nuclear receptor subfamily 1 group H member 4) and NF-κB (nuclear factor kappa B), are elevated in MDR2-/- mice, but treatment with LSCEVs reduced levels of these mediators of ductular reaction and biliary fibrosis through the inhibition of NF-κB and IL-13 signaling pathways. Evaluation of crosstalk using cholangiocyte supernatants from LSCEV-treated cells on cultured HSCs showed that HSCs had reduced levels of fibrosis and increased senescence. Conclusion: Our studies indicate that LSCEVs could be a possible treatment for cholangiopathies or could be used for target validation for future therapies.
Olfactory receptors are primarily expressed in nasal olfactory epithelium, but these receptors are also ectopically expressed in diverse tissues. In this study, we investigated the biological functions of Olfr43, a mouse homolog of human OR1A1, in cultured hepatocytes and mice to assess its functionality in lipid metabolism. Olfr43 was expressed in mouse hepatocytes, and Olfr43 activation by a known ligand, (-)-carvone, stimulated cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) activity. In ligand-receptor binding studies using site-directed mutagenesis, (-)-carvone binding required two residues, M257 and Y258, in Olfr43. In the mouse study, oral administration of (-)-carvone for 5 weeks in high-fat diet-fed mice improved energy metabolism, including reductions in hepatic steatosis and adiposity, and improved glucose and insulin tolerance. In mouse livers and cultured mouse hepatocytes, Olfr43 activation simulated the CREB-hairy and enhancer of split 1 (HES1)-peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-γ signaling axis, leading to a reduction in hepatic triglyceride accumulation in the mouse liver. Thus, long-term administration of (-)-carvone reduces hepatic steatosis. The knockdown of Olfr43 gene expression in cultured hepatocytes negated these effects of (-)-carvone. In conclusion, an ectopic olfactory receptor, hepatic Olfr43, regulates energy metabolism via the CREB-HES1-PPARγ signaling axis.
Hepatic ischemia reperfusion (HIR) has been found to induce hippocampus injury and cognitive dysfunction. The N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor subunit 2A (NR2A) is an important factor mediating excitotoxicity and neurons injury, and autophosphorylation of Src can up-regulate tyrosine phosphorylation of NR2A to improve its activity. However, the role of Src and NR2A in HIR-induced hippocampus injury in young mice remains unknown. In this study, we found that serum biomarkers of brain injury (S100β and NSE) increased significantly and reached highest after reperfusion of 3 days which had the same trend with the levels of p-Src and p-NR2A. Interactions between Src and NR2A or PSD95 were increased after HIR. Hippocampal neuron apoptosis was increased, and long-term cognitive impairment was found after reperfusion of 1 month. Inhibition of Src and NR2A with PP2 and NVP-AAM077 respectively not only down-regulated the levels of p-Src and p-NR2A, but also ameliorated hippocampal neurons apoptosis and long-term cognitive impairment after HIR. Serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α), interferon-γ (IFN-γ) and interleukin (IL)-6 were increased after reperfusion of 3 days, while PP2 and NVP-AAM077 treatment didn't attenuate the changes. And no difference was found in serum TNF-α, IFN-γ, IL-6 concentrations as well as the levels of Src, p-Src, NR2A, p-NR2A, PSD95 among the four groups after reperfusion of 1 month. In summary, HIR can lead to hippocampus injury and long-term cognitive dysfunction, and Src-PSD95-NR2A pathway plays an important role in the process.
To explore the action mechanisms of Huangqi Decoction Granules (, HQDG) on hepatitis B cirrhosis.
A total of 85 patients with hepatitis B cirrhosis were randomly divided into HQDG group (42 cases) and control group (43 cases) by a random number table and were treated with HQDG or placebo for 48 weeks (6 g per times and orally for 3 times a day), respectively. After RNA-sequencing of serum samples extracted from the patients, the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in HQDG and control groups before and after treatment were separately screened. The DEGs were then performed pathway enrichment analysis and proteinprotein interaction (PPI) network analysis. The expression levels of key genes were detected by quantitative realtime polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR).
After the investigation, 4 and 3 cases were respectively excluded from HQD and control groups because of the incomplete data. Additionally, 3 and 5 cases were lost to follow up in HQD and control groups respectively. Finally, a total of 70 cases with good compliance were included for further DEGs analysis. A total of 1,070 DEGs (including 455 up-regulated genes and 615 down-regulated genes) in HQDG group and 227 DEGs (including 164 up-regulated genes and 63 down-regulated genes) in the control group were identified after treatment. Compared with the control group, 1,043 DEGs were specific in HQDG group. Besides, 1 up-regulated transcription factor (TF, such as GLI family zinc finger 1, GLI1) and 25 down-regulated TFs (such as drosophila mothers against decapentaplegic proteinfamily member 2, SMAD2) were identified. Pathway enrichment analysis showed that down-regulated Ras homolog gene family member A (RHOA) was enriched in pathogenic Escherichia coli infection. In the PPI network, up-regulated epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), and down-regulated cell division cycle 42 (CDC42) as well as v-akt murine thymoma viral oncogene homolog 1 (AKT1) had higher degrees. Moreover, long non-coding RNAs (lncRNA) growth arrest-specific 5 (GAS5) was involved in the lncRNA-target regulatory network. Furthermore, qRT-PCR revealed that expression levels of CDC42 and GLI1 had significant differences in HQDG group before and after treatment (P&lt;0.05).
CDC42 and GLI1 may be the targets of HQDG in patients with hepatitis B cirrhosis. Additionally, SMAD2, EGFR, AKT1, RHOA and GAS5 might be associated with the curative effect of HQDG on hepatitis B cirrhosis patients.
Pinocembrin-7-O-β-d-glucoside (PCBG), pinocembrin (PCB), and 5-methoxy-pinocembrin-7-O-β-d-glucoside (MPG) are three flavonones isolated from Penthorum chinense Pursh (P. chinense). The effects of the three flavonones on hepatic steatosis and their molecular mechanisms in HepG2 cells were investigated in this study for the first time. A model of hepatic steatosis in HepG2 cells was induced by free fatty acid (FFA), and co-treated with the three flavonones as mentioned. Intracellular lipid droplets were detected by Oil Red O staining. PCB, PCBG, and MPG suppressed oxidative stress by decreasing malondialdehyde (MDA) levels and increasing superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) activities. The levels of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) were ameliorated. Moreover, these flavonones enhanced the phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and the expression of silent mating type information regulation 2 homolog 1 (SIRT1) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα), and reduced the expression of sterol regulatory element binding protein-1c (SREBP1c) and the downstream targets fatty acid synthase (FAS), acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), and stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 (SCD1). Molecular docking was used to predict the interaction and combination patterns between the three flavonones and the enzymes above. The results revealed that the SIRT1/AMPK pathway is involved in the functions of the three flavonones, and the most effective flavonone against hepatic steatosis might be PCBG, followed by MPG and PCB. Therefore, the three flavonones from P. chinense were found to exert preventive effects against hepatic steatosis by regulating the SIRT1/AMPK pathway.
Emerging evidence indicates that G-protein coupled receptor 55 (GPR55), a nonclassic receptor of the endocannabinoid system that is activated by L-α-lysophosphatidylinositol and various cannabinoid ligands, may regulate endocrine function and energy metabolism. We examined how GPR55 deficiency and modulation affects insulin signaling in skeletal muscle, adipose tissue, and liver alongside expression analysis of proteins implicated in insulin action and energy metabolism. We show that GPR55-null mice display decreased insulin sensitivity in these tissues, as evidenced by reduced phosphorylation of PKB/Akt and its downstream targets, concomitant with increased adiposity and reduced physical activity relative to wild-type counterparts. Impaired tissue insulin sensitivity coincided with reduced insulin receptor substrate-1 abundance in skeletal muscle, whereas in liver and epididymal fat it was associated with increased expression of the 3-phosphoinoistide lipid phosphatase, phosphatase and tensin homolog. In contrast, GPR55 activation enhanced insulin signaling in cultured skeletal muscle cells, adipocytes, and hepatocytes; this response was negated by receptor antagonists and GPR55 gene silencing in L6 myotubes. Sustained GPR55 antagonism in 3T3-L1 adipocytes enhanced expression of proteins implicated in lipogenesis and promoted triglyceride accumulation. Our findings identify GPR55 as a positive regulator of insulin action and adipogenesis and as a potential therapeutic target for countering obesity-induced metabolic dysfunction and insulin resistance.-Lipina, C., Walsh, S. K., Mitchell, S. E., Speakman, J. R., Wainwright, C. L., Hundal, H. S. GPR55 deficiency is associated with increased adiposity and impaired insulin signaling in peripheral metabolic tissues.
Understanding the heterogeneity of dysregulated pathways associated with the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) may provide prognostic and therapeutic avenues for disease management. As HCC involves a complex process of genetic and epigenetic modifications, we evaluated expression of both polyadenylated transcripts and microRNAs from HCC and liver samples derived from two cohorts of patients undergoing either partial hepatic resection or liver transplantation. Copy number variants were inferred from whole genome low-pass sequencing data, and a set of 56 cancer-related genes were screened using an oncology panel assay. HCC was associated with marked transcriptional deregulation of hundreds of protein-coding genes. In the partially resected livers, diminished transcriptional activity was observed in genes associated with drug catabolism and increased expression in genes related to inflammatory responses and cell proliferation. Moreover, several long noncoding RNAs and microRNAs not previously linked with HCC were found to be deregulated. In liver transplant recipients, down-regulation of genes involved in energy production and up-regulation of genes associated with glycolysis were detected. Numerous copy number variants events were observed, with hotspots on chromosomes 1 and 17. Amplifications were more common than deletions and spanned regions containing genes potentially involved in tumorigenesis. Colony stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R), fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3), fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3), nucleolar phosphoprotein B23 (NPM1), platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha polypeptide (PDGFRA), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), G-protein-coupled receptors-like receptor Smoothened (SMO), and tumor protein P53 (TP53) were mutated in all tumors; another 26 cancer-related genes were mutated with variable penetrance. Conclusion: Our results underscore the marked molecular heterogeneity between HCC tumors and reinforce the notion that precision medicine approaches are needed for management of individual HCC. These data will serve as a resource to generate hypotheses for further research to improve our understanding of HCC biology. (Hepatology Communications 2018; 00:000-000).
The present study aimed to identify the molecular basis of the arthrogryposis‑renal dysfunction‑cholestasis (ARC) syndrome, which is caused by mutations in the vacuolar protein sorting 33 homolog B (VPS33B) gene. The microarray dataset GSE83192, which contained six liver tissue samples from VPS33B knockout mice and four liver tissue samples from control mice, was downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus database. The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were screened by the Limma package in R software. The DEGs most relevant to ARC were selected via weighted gene co‑expression network analysis to construct a protein‑protein interaction (PPI) network. In addition, module analysis was performed for the PPI network using the Molecular Complex Detection function. Functional and pathway enrichment analyses were also performed for DEGs in the PPI network. Potential drugs for ARC treatment were predicted using the Connectivity Map database. In total, 768 upregulated and 379 downregulated DEGs were detected in the VPS33B knockout mice, while three modules were identified from the PPI network constructed. The DEGs in module 1 (CD83, IL1B and TLR2) were mainly involved in the positive regulation of cytokine production and the Toll‑like receptor (TLR) signaling pathway. The DEGs in module 2 (COL1A1 and COL1A2) were significantly enriched with respect to cellular component organization, extracellular matrix‑receptor interactions and focal adhesion. The DEGs in module 3 (ABCG8 and ABCG3) were clearly associated with sterol absorption and transport. Furthermore, mercaptopurine was identified to be a potential drug (connectivity score=‑0.939) for ARC treatment. In conclusion, the results of the current study may help to further understand the pathology of ARC, and the DEGs identified in these modules may serve as therapeutic targets.
Kawasaki disease (KD) is a type of acute febrile vasculitis syndrome and is the most frequent cause of cardiac illness in children under the age of five years old. Although the etiology of KD remains largely unknown, some recent genome-wide studies have indicated that epigenetic factors may be important in its pathogenesis. We enrolled 24 KD patients and 24 non-KD controls in this study to access their DNA methylation status using HumanMethylation450 BeadChips. Another 34 KD patients and 62 control subjects were enrolled for expression validation. Of the 3193 CpG methylation regions with a methylation difference ≥ 20% between KD and controls, 3096 CpG loci revealed hypomehtylation, with only 3% being hypermethylated. Pathway buildup identified 11 networked genes among the hypermethylated regions, including four transcription factors: nuclear factor of activated T-cells 1, v-ets avian erythroblastosis virus E26 oncogene homolog 1, runt related transcription factor 3, and retinoic acid receptor gamma, as well as the activator β-catenin. Ten of these network-selected genes demonstrated a significant decrease in mRNA in KD patients, whereas only CTNNB1 significantly decreased in correlation with coronary artery lesions in KD patients. Furthermore, CTNNB1-silenced THP-1 monocytic cells drastically increased the expression of CD40 and significantly increased the expression of both CD40 and CD40L in cocultured human coronary artery endothelial cells. This study is the first to identify network-based susceptible genes of hypermethylated CpG loci, their expression levels, and the functional impact of β-catenin, which may be involved in both the cause and the development of KD.
Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are pattern recognition receptors that are vital for the recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns. TLR5 is responsible for the recognition of bacterial flagellin to induce the NF-κB activation and innate immune responses. In this study, we cloned and identified the TLR5 gene from the King pigeon (Columba livia) designated as PiTLR5. Full-length PiTLR5 cDNA (2583 bp) encoded an 860-amino acid protein containing a signal peptide sequence, 10 leucine-rich repeat domains, a leucine-rich repeat C-terminal domain, a transmembrane domain, and an intracellular Toll-interleukin-1 receptor domain. Pigeon TLR5 mRNA expression was quantified by performing quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR), which showed that PiTLR5 was broadly expressed in all examined tissues, with the highest expression in the liver, peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and spleen. PiTLR5-mediated innate immune responses were measured by determining its effects on NF-κB activation and cytokine expression. The results showed that HEK293T cells transfected with PiTLR5 robustly activated the NF-κB response to flagellin, but not other TLR stimuli, and induced significant upregulation of IL-1β, IL-8, TNF-α, and IFN-γ, indicating that PiTLR5 is a functional TLR5 homolog. Additionally, following flagellin stimulation of pigeon splenic lymphocytes, the levels of TLR5, NF-κB, IL-6, IL-8, CCL5, and IFN-γ mRNA, assessed using qRT-PCR, were significantly upregulated. Besides, TLR5 knockdown resulted in the significantly downregulated expression of NF-κB and related cytokines/chemokines. Triggering pigeon TLR5 contributes to significant upregulation of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, suggesting that pigeon TLR5 plays an important role in the innate immune responses.
Hepatitis B virus (HBV) genotype F1b infection is strongly associated with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in young Alaskan Native (AN) people. However, the mechanisms by which genotype F1b causes HCC are unclear. Here, we analyzed the clinical and virological significance of genotype F1b in long-term serial samples from 20 HCC patients with HBV infection. Complete sequence analyses revealed that all isolates were genotype F1b. In the HCC patients, T1938C and A2051C mutations in the core region had accumulated significantly with A1762T/G1764A mutations in the basal core promoter (BCP) region and G1896A mutation in the precore (PC) region. Several HBV clones containing the core mutations were examined for their replication efficiency and core stability in vitro. Clones containing the A2051C mutation replicated more efficiently than the wild type in association with enhanced stability of core protein dimerization. In chimeric mice with human hepatocytes carrying BCP/PC/2051 mutant but not with wild-type virus, liver fibrosis was induced in association with high levels of serum HBV DNA and hepatitis B surface antigen. Interestingly, microarray analysis and validation study showed that five genes associated with cell proliferation or carcinogenesis, v-myc avian myelocytomatosis viral oncogene homolog, Grb2-associated binding protein 2, bradykinin receptor B2, follistatin, and mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase 8, were significantly up-regulated in human hepatocytes infected with genotype F1b, particularly the BCP/PC/2051 mutant, compared with other genotypes. Conclusion: We have identified an association between Alaska-specific core mutations and HCC development in AN people infected with genotype F1b; accumulation of these core mutations during the course of chronic infection with genotype F1b would contribute to HCC development in AN people earlier in life.
Defects in mucus and intestinal epithelia can lead to intestinal inflammation in colitis. Reduced peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) in the mucosa may contribute to inflammation. However, the roles of PPARγ in the intestinal barrier remain poorly understood.
Chronic colitis was induced in C57BL/6 mice by administration of dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) for 27 days. Three days before DSS treatment, mice were treated with the PPARγ agonist rosiglitazone (Ro) orally at 20 mg kg-1 day-1.
The colitis based on disease activity index and colonic histopathology was significantly ameliorated in the DSS + Ro group. Additionally, mice in the DSS + Ro group had a thicker mucous layer than those in DSS + NS group, and muc2 mRNA expression was elevated significantly along with the mouse atonal homolog, SAM-pointed domain-containing Ets-like factor, and anterior gradient 2 genes. Moreover, tight junctions were up-regulated, whereas long myosin light chain kinase and phosphorylation of the myosin II light chain were lower in DSS + Ro mice. Similarly, after HT-29 and Caco-2 cells were treated by LPS or LPS + Ro, PPARγ activation by Ro could effectively improve the intestinal barrier, including intestinal mucus and tight junctions.
Our results demonstrate that activated PPARγ could effectively promote intestinal mucus integrity by increasing the number of goblet cells, the glycosylation of mucins, and tight junctions via an MLCK-dependent mechanism.
Hepatitis B virus (HBV)-X protein(HBx) is a transactivator of host several cellular genes including alpha-fetoprotein(AFP) and AFP receptor(AFPR) which contributes to HBV-associated tumor development. The expression of AFP/AFPR are correlated with hepatocellular carcinoma(HCC)-initial cells. But the role of AFP and AFPR in promoting occurrence of HBV-related HCC were still unclear.
A total of 71 clinical patients' liver specimens, normal human liver cells L-02 and HCC cell lines, PLC/PRF/5 were selected for analyzing the effects of HBx on expression of AFP, AFPR and Src. The expression of goal proteins were detected by Immunohistochemical stained and Western blotting; HBx-expressed vectors were constructed and transfected into L-02 cells, laser confocal microscopy was applied to observe expression and location of AFP, AFPR and Src in the normal liver cells and HCC cells, soft agar colony formation assay was used to observe colonies formed of the cells.
We confirmed HBx gives preference to promote the expression of AFP and AFPR; HBx priors to up-regulate the expression of AFPR and AFP in L-02 cells and in normal liver specimens; AFPR signal been able to stimulate Src expression. The results also indicated that phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase(PI3K) inhibitors Ly294002 and GDC0941 effectively suppress AFPR mediated up-regulation expression of Src in AFPR positive HCC lines.
HBx priors to drive the expression of AFP and AFPR to promote expression of Src in normal liver cells and hepatoma cells; AFP and AFPR maybe play pivotal role in HBV-related hepatocarcinogenesis; Targeting AFPR is an available therapeutic strategy of HCC.
The orphan nuclear receptor (NR5A2), which belongs to the NR5A subfamily of nuclear receptors, is expressed in developing and adult tissues of endodermal origin, and can contribute to the development of several cancers through regulating cell proliferation. NR5A2 (rs3790843 and rs3790844) single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) genotyping were examined in DNA samples, extracted from paraffin-embedded cancer tissue. Clinicopathologic and follow-up data were collected from 944 patients with gastric cancer (GC). Associations of the 2 SNPs with the progression and prognosis in gastric cancer patients were analyzed using the SPSS version 18.0. We found that NR5A2 rs3790843 polymorphism was significantly associated with the risk of GC which had regional lymph node metastasis (p = 0.044) or distant metastasis (p = 0.020). Our results also indicated that rs3790844 polymorphism was associated with the increased overall survival (OS) of GC patients in the dominant model (GG vs. GA/AA, HR (hazard ratio) = 0.823, 95% CI (confidence interval) = 0.679-0.997), suggesting a potential protective role of the variant A allele. Additionally, in the stratified analysis, both NR5A2 rs3790843 and rs3790844 polymorphism were associated with significantly lower risk of death in the groups of female, tumor size &gt;5 cm in a dominant model. Our results represent the first demonstration that the NR5A2 rs3790844 polymorphism is associated with increased OS of GC patients in the dominant model, and similar results were found among the female group and tumor size &gt;5 cm group for NR5A2 rs3790843 polymorphism. Further validation in other larger studies with different ethnic populations and functional evaluations are needed. 
Recent studies have demonstrated the possible function of miR-139-5p in tumorigenesis. However, the exact mechanism of miR-139-5p in cancer remains unclear. In this study, the association of miR-139-5p expression with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) was evaluated in 106 pairs of esophageal cancer and adjacent non-cancerous tissue from ESCC patients. The tumor suppressive features of miR-139-5p were measured by evaluating cell proliferation and cell cycle state, migratory activity and invasion capability, as well as apoptosis. Luciferase reporter assay and Western blot analysis were performed to determine the target gene regulated by miR-139-5p. The mRNA level of NR5A2, the target gene of miR-139-5p, was determined in ESCC patients. Results showed that reduced miR-139-5p level was associated with lymph node metastases of ESCC. MiR-139-5p was investigated to induce cell cycle arrest in the G0/G1 phase and to suppress the invasive capability of esophageal carcinoma cells by targeting the 3'UTR of oncogenic NR5A2. Cyclin E1 and MMP9 were confirmed to participate in cell cycle arrest and invasive suppression induced by NR5A2, respectively. Pearson correlation analysis further confirmed the significantly negative correlation between miR-139-5p and NR5A2 expression. The results suggest that miR-139-5p exerts a growth- and invasiveness-suppressing function in human ESCCs, which demonstrates that miR-139-5p is a potential biomarker for early diagnosis and prognosis and is a therapeutic target for ESCC. 
The hepatic glucose-sensing system is a functional network of enzymes and transcription factors that is critical for the maintenance of energy homeostasis and systemic glycemia. Here we review the recent literature on its components and metabolic actions. Glucokinase (GCK) is generally considered as the initial postprandial glucose-sensing component, which acts as the gatekeeper for hepatic glucose metabolism and provides metabolites that activate the transcription factor carbohydrate response element binding protein (ChREBP). Recently, liver receptor homolog 1 (LRH-1) has emerged as an upstream regulator of the central GCK-ChREBP axis, with a critical role in the integration of hepatic intermediary metabolism in response to glucose. Evidence is also accumulating that O-linked β-N-acetylglucosaminylation (O-GlcNAcylation) and acetylation can act as glucose-sensitive modifications that may contribute to hepatic glucose sensing by targeting regulatory proteins and the epigenome. Further elucidation of the components and functional roles of the hepatic glucose-sensing system may contribute to the future treatment of liver diseases associated with deregulated glucose sensors. 
Oestrogen receptor α (ERα) is a nuclear receptor that is the driving transcription factor expressed in the majority of breast cancers. Recent studies have demonstrated that the liver receptor homolog-1 (LRH-1), another nuclear receptor, regulates breast cancer cell proliferation and promotes motility and invasion. To determine the mechanisms of LRH-1 action in breast cancer, we performed gene expression microarray analysis following RNA interference for LRH-1. Interestingly, gene ontology (GO) category enrichment analysis of LRH-1-regulated genes identified oestrogen-responsive genes as the most highly enriched GO categories. Remarkably, chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled to massively parallel sequencing (ChIP-seq) to identify genomic targets of LRH-1 showed LRH-1 binding at many ERα binding sites. Analysis of select binding sites confirmed regulation of ERα-regulated genes by LRH-1 through binding to oestrogen response elements, as exemplified by the TFF1/pS2 gene. Finally, LRH-1 overexpression stimulated ERα recruitment, while LRH-1 knockdown reduced ERα recruitment to ERα binding sites. Taken together, our findings establish a key role for LRH-1 in the regulation of ERα target genes in breast cancer cells and identify a mechanism in which co-operative binding of LRH-1 and ERα at oestrogen response elements controls the expression of oestrogen-responsive genes. 
The expression of orphan nuclear receptor Liver Receptor Homolog-1 (LRH-1) is elevated in breast cancer and promotes proliferation, migration and invasion in vitro. LRH-1 expression is regulated by oestrogen (E2), with LRH-1 mRNA transcript levels higher in oestrogen receptor α (ERα) positive (ER+) breast cancer cells compared to ER- cells. However, the presence of LRH-1 protein in ER- cells suggests discordance between mRNA transcript levels and protein expression. To understand this, we investigated the impact of mRNA and protein stability in determining LRH-1 protein levels in breast cancer cells. LRH-1 transcript levels were significantly higher in ER+ versus ER- breast cancer cells lines; however LRH-1 protein was expressed at similar levels. We found LRH-1 mRNA and protein was more stable in ER- compared to ER+ cell lines. The tumor-specific LRH-1 variant isoform, LRH-1v4, which is highly responsive to E2, showed increased mRNA stability in ER- versus ER+ cells. In addition, in MCF-7 and T47-D cell lines, LRH-1 total mRNA stability was reduced with E2 treatment, this effect mediated by ERα. Our data demonstrates that in ER- cells, increased mRNA and protein stability contribute to the abundant protein expression levels. Expression and immunolocalisation of LRH-1 in ER- cells as well as ER- tumors suggests a possible role in the development of ER- tumors. The modulation of LRH-1 bioactivity may therefore be beneficial as a treatment option in both ER- and ER+ breast cancer. 
Successful pregnancy requires coordination of an array of signals and factors from multiple tissues. One such element, liver receptor homolog-1 (Lrh-1), is an orphan nuclear receptor that regulates metabolism and hormone synthesis. It is strongly expressed in granulosa cells of ovarian follicles and in the corpus luteum of rodents and humans. Germline ablation of Nr5a2 (also called Lrh-1), the gene coding for Lrh-1, in mice is embryonically lethal at gastrulation. Depletion of Lrh-1 in the ovarian follicle shows that it regulates genes required for both steroid synthesis and ovulation. To study the effects of Lrh-1 on mouse gestation, we genetically disrupted its expression in the corpus luteum, resulting in luteal insufficiency. Hormone replacement permitted embryo implantation but was followed by gestational failure with impaired endometrial decidualization, compromised placental formation, fetal growth retardation and fetal death. Lrh-1 is also expressed in the mouse and human endometrium, and in a primary culture of human endometrial stromal cells, reduction of NR5A2 transcript abundance by RNA interference abrogated decidualization. These findings show that Lrh-1 is necessary for maintenance of the corpus luteum, for promotion of decidualization and for formation of the placenta. It therefore has multiple, indispensible roles in establishing and sustaining pregnancy. 
The members of the NR5A subfamily of nuclear receptors (NRs) are important regulators of pluripotency, lipid and glucose homeostasis, and steroidogenesis. Liver receptor homologue 1 (LRH-1; NR5A2) and steroidogenic factor 1 (SF-1; NR5A1) have therapeutic potential for the treatment of metabolic and neoplastic disease; however, a poor understanding of their ligand regulation has hampered the pursuit of these proteins as pharmaceutical targets. In this study, we dissect how sequence variation among LRH-1 orthologs affects phospholipid (PL) binding and regulation. Both human LRH-1 (hLRH-1) and mouse LRH-1 (mLRH-1) respond to newly discovered medium chain PL agonists to modulate lipid and glucose homeostasis. These PLs activate hLRH-1 by altering receptor dynamics in a newly identified alternate activation function region. Mouse and Drosophila orthologs contain divergent sequences in this region potentially altering PL-driven activation. Structural evidence suggests that these sequence differences in mLRH-1 and Drosophila FTZ-f1 (dmFTZ-f1) confer at least partial ligand independence, making them poor models for hLRH-1 studies; however, the mechanisms of ligand independence remain untested. We show using structural and biochemical methods that the recent evolutionary divergence of the mLRH-1 stabilizes the active conformation in the absence of ligand, yet does not abrogate PL-dependent activation. We also show by mass spectrometry and biochemical assays that FTZ-f1 is incapable of PL binding. This work provides a structural mechanism for the differential tuning of PL sensitivity in NR5A orthologs and supports the use of mice as viable therapeutic models for LRH-1-dependent diseases. 
Liver receptor homolog 1 (nuclear receptor LRH-1, NR5A2) is an essential regulator of gene transcription, critical for maintenance of cell pluripotency in early development and imperative for the proper functions of the liver, pancreas, and intestines during the adult life. Although physiological hormones of LRH-1 have not yet been identified, crystallographic and biochemical studies demonstrated that LRH-1 could bind regulatory ligands and suggested phosphatidylinositols as potential hormone candidates for this receptor. No synthetic antagonists of LRH-1 are known to date. Here, we identify the first small molecule antagonists of LRH-1 activity. Our search for LRH-1 modulators was empowered by screening of 5.2 million commercially available compounds via molecular docking followed by verification of the top-ranked molecules using in vitro direct binding and transcriptional assays. Experimental evaluation of the predicted ligands identified two compounds that inhibit the transcriptional activity of LRH-1 and diminish the expression of the receptor's target genes. Among the affected transcriptional targets are co-repressor SHP (small heterodimer partner) as well as cyclin E1 (CCNE1) and G0S2 genes that are known to regulate cell growth and proliferation. Treatments of human pancreatic (AsPC-1), colon (HT29), and breast adenocarcinoma cells T47D and MDA-MB-468 with the LRH-1 antagonists resulted in the receptor-mediated inhibition of cancer cell proliferation. Our data suggest that specific antagonists of LRH-1 could be used as specific molecular probes for elucidating the roles of the receptor in different types of malignancies. 
Granulosa cell tumours of the ovary (GCT) express aromatase and produce oestrogens. The ovarian-specific aromatase promoter (pII) is regulated by members of the group 5A nuclear receptor family, SF-1 and LRH-1. Since both SF-1 and LRH-1 are implicated in proliferation and cancer, we hypothesised that alteration in the expression of either or both receptors may be associated with GCT. We therefore determined the expression of LRH-1, SF-1 and aromatase in a cohort of GCT, mucinous and serous cystadenocarcinomas, and normal ovaries. LRH-1 mRNA was present at low level in normal ovary and serous cystadenocarcinoma, but was elevated approximately 30-fold in GCT, and 8-fold in mucinous cystadenocarcinoma, compared to normal ovary. LRH-1 protein expression was confirmed in GCT by immunohistochemistry. SF-1 mRNA was significantly lower that of LRH-1 in all samples and not significantly altered in GCT, compared to normal ovary. Aromatase mRNA was present at low level in normal ovary and serous and mucinous cystadenocarcinoma, and significantly elevated (18-fold) in GCT compared to normal ovary. Despite the coordinate over-expression of both LRH-1 and aromatase in GCT versus normal ovary, their levels did not correlate in individual patients; rather, aromatase expression correlated with that of SF-1. Finally, although both LRH-1 and SF-1 activated aromatase promoter activity in transient transfection studies, gel-shift and chromatin immunoprecipitation data indicated that SF-1, but not LRH-1, bound to the aromatase promoter. We conclude that SF-1 regulates aromatase expression in GCT; over-expression of LRH-1 suggests that this receptor may be involved in the pathogenesis of GCT by mechanisms other than the regulation of aromatase. Its role in this disease therefore warrants further investigation.
Liver receptor homolog-1 (LRH-1) is a member of the nuclear receptor 5A (NR5A) subfamily. It is expressed in granulosa cells of the ovary and is involved in steroidogenesis and ovulation. To reveal the transcriptional regulatory mechanism of LRH-1, we determined its transcription start site in the ovary using KGN cells, a human granulosa cell tumor cell line. 5'-rapid amplification of cDNA ends PCR revealed that human ovarian LRH-1 was transcribed from a novel transcription start site, termed exon 2o, located 41 bp upstream of the reported exon 2. The novel LRH-1 isoform was expressed in the human ovary but not the liver. Promoter analysis and an EMSA indicated that a steroidogenic factor-1 (SF-1) binding site and a GC box upstream of exon 2o were required for promoter activity, and that SF-1 and specificity protein (Sp)-1/3 bind to the respective regions in ovarian granulosa cells. In KGN cells, transfection of SF-1 increased ovarian LRH-1 promoter activity and SF-1-dependent reporter activity was further enhanced when peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ coactivator-1α (PGC-1α) was cotransfected. In Drosophila SL2 cells, Sp1 was more effective than Sp3 in enhancing promoter activity, and co-transfection of the NR5A-family synergistically increased activity. Infection with adenoviruses expressing SF-1 or PGC-1α induced LRH-1 expression in KGN cells. These results indicate that the expression of human LRH-1 is regulated in a tissue-specific manner, and that the novel promoter region is controlled by the Sp-family, NR5A-family and PGC-1α in ovarian granulosa cells in a coordinated fashion.
To circumvent difficulties of isolating pure populations of cancer stem cells (CSCs) for the purpose of identifying malignancy-specific gene expression, we have compared exon-resolution transcriptomic profiles of 5 embryonal carcinoma (EC) cell lines, a histological subtype of germ cell tumor (GCT), to their nonmalignant caricature, specifically 6 human embryonic stem (ES) cell lines. Both cell types are readily accessible, and were purified for undifferentiated cells only. We identified a set of 28 differentially expressed genes, many of which had cancer and stemness roles. Overexpression of the recently discovered pluripotency gene NR5A2 in malignant EC cells revealed an intriguing indication of how WNT-mediated dysregulation of pluripotency is involved with malignancy. Expression of these 28 genes was further explored within 2 publically available data sets of primary EC tumors and normal testis. At the exon-level, alternative splicing events were detected in ZNF195, DNMT3B, and PMF1, and alternative promoters were detected for ASH2L and ETV5. These events were validated by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction-based methods in EC and ES lines, where the alternative splicing event in the de novo DNA methyltransferase DNMT3B may have functional consequences. In conclusion, we have identified malignancy-specific gene expression differences within a rigorous pluripotent stem cell context. These findings are of particular interest for both GCT and ES cell biology, and, in general, to the concept of CSCs.
Human Cripto-1 (CR-1) plays an important role in regulating embryonic development while also regulating various stages of tumor progression. However, mechanisms that regulate CR-1 expression during embryogenesis and tumorigenesis are still not well defined. In the present study, we investigated the effects of two nuclear receptors, liver receptor homolog (LRH)-1 and germ cell nuclear factor receptor (GCNF) and epigenetic modifications on CR-1 gene expression in NTERA-2 human embryonal carcinoma cells and in breast cancer cells. CR-1 expression in NTERA-2 cells was positively regulated by LRH-1 through direct binding to a DR0 element within the CR-1 promoter, while GCNF strongly suppressed CR-1 expression in these cells. In addition, the CR-1 promoter was unmethylated in NTERA-2 cells, while T47D, ZR75-1, and MCF7 breast cancer cells showed high levels of CR-1 promoter methylation and low CR-1 mRNA and protein expression. Treatment of breast cancer cells with a demethylating agent and histone deacetylase inhibitors reduced methylation of the CR-1 promoter and reactivated CR-1 mRNA and protein expression in these cells, promoting migration and invasion of breast cancer cells. Analysis of a breast cancer tissue array revealed that CR-1 was highly expressed in the majority of human breast tumors, suggesting that CR-1 expression in breast cancer cell lines might not be representative of in vivo expression. Collectively, these findings offer some insight into the transcriptional regulation of CR-1 gene expression and its critical role in the pathogenesis of human cancer.
Cyclic AMP (cAMP) induces steroidogenic enzyme gene expression and stimulates testosterone production in Leydig cells. Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) is expressed in Leydig cells, but its role has not been defined. In this study, we found that PEPCK and glucose-6-phosphatase (Glc-6-Pase) are increased significantly following cAMP treatment of mouse Leydig cells. Moreover, cAMP treatment increased recruitment of the cAMP-response element-binding transcription factor and decreased recruitment of the corepressor DAX-1 on the pepck promoter. Furthermore, cAMP induced an increase in ATP that correlated with a decrease in phospho-AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). In contrast, knockdown or inhibition of PEPCK decreased ATP and increased phospho-AMPK. Treatment with an AMPK activator or overexpression of the constitutively active form of AMPK inhibited cAMP-induced steroidogenic enzyme promoter activities and gene expression. Liver receptor homolog-1 (LRH-1) was involved in cAMP-induced steroidogenic enzyme gene expression but was inhibited by AMPK activation in Leydig cells. Additionally, inhibition or knockdown of PEPCK and Glc-6-Pase decreased cAMP-mediated induction of steroidogenic enzyme gene expression and steroidogenesis. Finally, pubertal mouse (8-week-old) testes and human chorionic gonadotropin-induced prepubertal mouse testes showed increased PEPCK and Glc-6-Pase gene expression. Taken together, these results suggest that induction of PEPCK and Glc-6-Pase by cAMP plays an important role in Leydig cell steroidogenesis.
Fibroblast growth factor 19 (FGF19) is a postprandial enterokine induced by the nuclear bile acid receptor, FXR, in ileum. FGF19 inhibits bile acid synthesis in liver through transcriptional repression of cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase (CYP7A1) via a mechanism involving the nuclear receptor SHP. Here, in a series of loss-of-function studies, we show that the nuclear receptors HNF4α and LRH-1 have dual roles in regulating Cyp7a1 in vivo. First, they cooperate in maintaining basal Cyp7a1 expression. Second, they enable SHP binding to the Cyp7a1 promoter and facilitate FGF19-mediated repression of bile acid synthesis. HNF4α and LRH-1 promote active transcription histone marks on the Cyp7a1 promoter that are reversed by FGF19 in a SHP-dependent manner. These findings demonstrate that both HNF4α and LRH-1 are important regulators of Cyp7a1 transcription in vivo.
5-Aminolevulinic acid synthase 1 (ALAS1) is a rate-limiting enzyme for heme biosynthesis in mammals. Heme is essential for the catalytic activities of P450 enzymes including steroid metabolic enzymes. Nuclear receptor 5A (NR5A) family proteins, steroidogenic factor-1 (SF-1), and liver receptor homolog-1 (LRH-1) play pivotal roles in regulation of steroidogenic enzymes. Recently, we showed that expression of SF-1/LRH-1 induces differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells into steroidogenic cells. In this study, genome-wide analysis revealed that ALAS1 was a novel SF-1-target gene in differentiated mesenchymal stem cells. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and reporter assays revealed that SF-1/LRH-1 up-regulated ALAS1 gene transcription in steroidogenic cells via binding to a 3.5-kb upstream region of ALAS1. The ALAS1 gene was up-regulated by overexpression of SF-1/LRH-1 in steroidogenic cells and down-regulated by knockdown of SF-1 in these cells. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ coactivator-1α, a coactivator of nuclear receptors, also strongly coactivated expression of NR5A-target genes. Reporter analysis revealed that peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ coactivator-1α strongly augmented ALAS1 gene transcription caused by SF-1 binding to the 3.5-kb upstream region. Finally knockdown of ALAS1 resulted in reduced progesterone production by steroidogenic cells. These results indicate that ALAS1 is a novel NR5A-target gene and participates in steroid hormone production.
We demonstrate the regulation of OCT4 gene expression mediated by liver receptor homolog-1 (LRH-1) in human embryonic carcinoma cells. LRH-1 and OCT4 are co-expressed in undifferentiated NCCIT cells and decreased during retinoic acid-induced differentiation. Dose-dependent overexpression of LRH-1 transactivated the OCT4 promoter activity and its dominant negative form with a deletion of activation function-2 motif reduced the activity even in the presence of LRH-1. The OCT4 promoter contains potent three LRH-1 binding sites; one within conserved region (CR) 1 and two within CR2. Mutagenesis of each binding site affected the decrease in OCT4 promoter activity and the 2nd binding site mutant most significantly reduced the transcriptional activity, compared to that of 1st and 3rd binding site mutants, respectively. Simultaneous disruption of 2nd and 3rd binding sites led to significant down-regulation of the activity even in the presence of 1st binding site-containing CR1. Moreover, mutation of each binding element within native or exogenous minimal promoter-driven CR1 or CR2 also decreased the promoter activity to some different extent, suggesting that three binding elements may be implicated in the induction of the full-activity of OCT4 promoter. In vivo binding assay revealed the 2nd and 3rd binding motifs within CR2 were more enriched than the 1st one within CR1. Taken together, our study indicates that LRH-1 acts as a transcriptional activator in the regulation of OCT4 gene expression through the cooperative interaction with three binding sites directly or/and indirectly.
Targeting LRH-1: Virtual screening and molecular modeling were used to identify novel antagonists of liver receptor homolog-1 (LRH-1), an emerging therapeutic target for breast cancer. Hit compounds were synthesized and biologically assayed, and the preliminary results suggest that raloxifene-based analogues, substituted at the position C-7 of the benzothiophene ring, might generate an inactive protein conformation through binding and thus antagonize this nuclear receptor. 
The human nuclear receptor liver receptor homolog-1 (LRH-1) has an important role in controlling lipid and cholesterol homeostasis and is a potential target for the treatment of diabetes and hepatic diseases. LRH-1 is known to bind phospholipids, but the role of phospholipids in controlling LRH-1 activation remains highly debated. Here we describe the structure of both apo LRH-1 and LRH-1 in complex with the antidiabetic phospholipid dilauroylphosphatidylcholine (DLPC). Together with hydrogen-deuterium exchange MS and functional data, our studies show that DLPC binding is a dynamic process that alters co-regulator selectivity. We show that the lipid-free receptor undergoes previously unrecognized structural fluctuations, allowing it to interact with widely expressed co-repressors. These observations enhance our understanding of LRH-1 regulation and highlight its importance as a new therapeutic target for controlling diabetes.
Liver Receptor Homolog 1 (LRH-1, NR5A2) is an orphan nuclear receptor that is over-expressed in cancers in tissues such as the breast, colon and pancreas. LRH-1 plays important roles in embryonic development, steroidogenesis and cholesterol homeostasis. In tumor cells, LRH-1 induces proliferation and cell cycle progression. High LRH-1 expression is demonstrated in breast cancers, positively correlating with ERα status and aromatase activity. LRH-1 dependent cellular mechanisms in breast cancer epithelial cells are poorly defined. Hence in the present study we investigated the actions of LRH-1 in estrogen receptor α (ERα) positive breast cancer cells.
The study aimed to investigate LRH-1 dependent mechanisms that promote breast cancer proliferation. We identified that LRH-1 regulated the expression of Growth Regulation by Estrogen in Breast Cancer 1 (GREB1) in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells. Over-expression of LRH-1 increased GREB1 mRNA levels while knockdown of LRH-1 reduced its expression. GREB1 is a well characterised ERα target gene, with three estrogen response elements (ERE) located on its promoter. Chromatin immunoprecipitation studies provided evidence of the co-localisation of LRH-1 and ERα at all three EREs. With electrophoretic mobility shift assays, we demonstrated direct binding of LRH-1 to EREs located on GREB1 and Trefoil Factor 1 (TFF1, pS2) promoters. LRH-1 and ERα co-operatively activated transcription of ERE luciferase reporter constructs suggesting an overlap in regulation of target genes in breast cancer cells. Over-expression of LRH-1 resulted in an increase in cell proliferation. This effect was more pronounced with estradiol treatment. In the presence of ICI 182,780, an ERα antagonist, LRH-1 still induced proliferation.
We conclude that in ER-positive breast cancer cells, LRH-1 promotes cell proliferation by enhancing ERα mediated transcription of target genes such as GREB-1. Collectively these findings indicate the importance of LRH-1 in the progression of hormone-dependent breast cancer and implicate LRH-1 as a potential avenue for drug development.
The nuclear receptor (NR) superfamily is composed of 48 members in humans and includes receptors for steroid hormones, thyroid hormone, various lipids and oxysterols. This superfamily has been a rich source of drug targets for myriad diseases including inflammation, cancer, and metabolic disorders. Approximately half of the superfamily have well characterized natural ligands whereas the remaining receptors are considered orphan receptors and remain a focus of a number of investigators assessing their ability to be regulated by ligands. Here, we review recent discoveries that yield important insight into the druggability of three orphan nuclear receptors: the retinoic acid receptor-like orphan receptors (RORs), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ), and liver receptor homolog-1 (LRH-1).
Liver Receptor Homolog-1 (LRH-1; NR5A2) belongs to the orphan nuclear receptor superfamily, and plays vital roles in early development, cholesterol homeostasis, steroidogenesis and certain diseases, including cancer. It is expressed in embryonic stem cells, adult liver, intestine, pancreas and ovary. It binds to DNA as a monomer and is regulated by various ligand-dependent and -independent mechanisms. Recent work identified synthetic ligands for LRH-1; such compounds may yield useful therapeutics for a range of pathologic conditions associated with aberrant expression and activity of LRH-1.
We report the three-dimensional structure of a β-catenin armadillo repeat in complex with the liver receptor homolog-1 (LRH-1) ligand binding domain at 2.8 Å resolution as the first structure of β-catenin in complex with any nuclear receptor. The surface of β-catenin that binds LRH-1 partly overlaps defined contact sites for peptide segments of β-catenin partners, including T-cell factor-4. The surface of LRH-1 that engages β-catenin is comprised of helices 1, 9, and 10 and is distinct from known interaction surfaces of LRH-1, including corepressor and coactivator binding sites. Targeted mutagenesis of amino acids forming both sides of the LRH-1/β-catenin interface reveals that they are essential for stable interactions between these proteins in solution. The LRH-1 binding site in β-catenin is also required for association with androgen receptor, providing evidence that the observed LRH-1/β-catenin interaction may be prototypic.
It is widely known that the liver is a central organ in lipogenesis, gluconeogenesis and cholesterol metabolism. However, over the last decades, a variety of pathological conditions highlighted the importance of metabolic functions within the diseased liver. As observed in Western societies, an increase in the prevalence of obesity and the metabolic syndrome promotes pathophysiological changes that cause non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). NAFLD increases the susceptibility of the liver to acute liver injury and may lead to cirrhosis and hepatocellular cancer. Alterations in insulin response, β-oxidation, lipid storage and transport, autophagy and an imbalance in chemokines and nuclear receptor signaling are held accountable for these changes. Furthermore, recent studies revealed a role for lipid accumulation in inflammation and ER stress in the clinical context of liver regeneration and hepatic carcinogenesis. This review focuses on novel findings related to nuclear receptor signaling - including the vitamin D receptor and the liver receptor homolog 1 - in hepatic lipid and glucose uptake, storage and metabolism in the clinical context of NAFLD, liver regeneration, and cancer.
Pancreatic cancer has one of the worst mortality rates of all cancers. Little is known about its etiology, particularly regarding inherited risk. The PanScan project, a genome-wide association study, identified several common polymorphisms affecting pancreatic cancer susceptibility. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in ABO, sonic hedgehog (SHH), telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT), nuclear receptor subfamily 5, group A, member 2 (NR5A2) were found to be associated with pancreatic cancer risk. Moreover the scan identified loci on chromosomes 13q22.1 and 15q14, to which no known genes or other functional elements are mapped. We sought to replicate these observations in two additional, independent populations (from Germany and the UK), and also evaluate the possible impact of these SNPs on patient survival. We genotyped 15 SNPs in 690 cases of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and in 1277 healthy controls. We replicated several associations between SNPs and PDAC risk. Furthermore we found that SNP rs8028529 was weakly associated with a better overall survival (OS) in both populations. We have also found that NR5A2 rs12029406_T allele was associated with a shorter survival in the German population. In conclusion, we found that rs8028529 could be, if these results are replicated, a promising marker for both risk and prognosis for this lethal disease.
Glucocorticoids (GC) are potent anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive steroid hormones, mainly produced by the adrenal glands. However, increasing evidence supports the idea of additional extra-adrenal sources of bioactive GC. The lung epithelium is constantly exposed to a plethora of antigenic stimuli, and local GC synthesis could contribute to limit uncontrolled immune reactions and tissue damage.
Expression of steroidogenic enzymes and GC synthesis in ex vivo organ cultures was studied in mouse lung tissue after in vivo stimulation of immune cells.
Mouse lung tissue was found to express steroidogenic enzymes required for the synthesis of corticosterone from cholesterol and to synthesize corticosterone in large quantities after immune cell activation by anti-CD3 antibody, lipopolysaccharide, or TNFα. In marked contrast, ovalbumin-induced allergic airway inflammation failed to promote lung GC synthesis. Although the lung expresses all steroidogenic enzymes necessary for de novo synthesis of corticosterone from cholesterol, functional data indicated that inactive serum-derived dehydrocorticosterone is converted to active corticosterone by 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 1.
Our results support the notion that local GC synthesis represents a novel immunoregulatory mechanism to limit uncontrolled immune responses in the lung and indicate that defective local steroidogenesis may contribute to the pathogenesis of allergic airway inflammation.
We investigated regulation of miR-200c expression by nuclear receptors. Ectopic expression of miR-200c inhibited MHCC97H cell migration, which was abrogated by the synergistic effects of PPARα and LRH-1 siRNAs. The expression of miR-200c was decreased by PPARα/LRH-1 siRNAs and increased by SHP siRNAs, and overexpression of the receptors reversed the effects of their respective siRNAs. SHP siRNAs also drastically enhanced the ability of the LRH-1 agonist RJW100 to induce miR-200c and downregulate ZEB1 and ZEB2 proteins. Co-expression of PPARα and LRH-1 moderately transactivated the miR-200c promoter, which was repressed by SHP co-expression. RJW100 caused strong activation of the miR-200c promoter. This is the first report to demonstrate that miR-200c expression is controlled by nuclear receptors.
There is growing evidence for a link between energy and bone metabolism. The nuclear receptor subfamily 5 member A2 (NR5A2) is involved in lipid metabolism and modulates the expression of estrogen-related genes in some tissues. The objective of this study was to explore the influence of NR5A2 on bone cells and to determine whether its allelic variations are associated with bone mineral density (BMD).
Analyses of gene expression by quantitative PCR and inhibition of NR5A2 expression by siRNAs were used to explore the effects of NR5A2 in osteoblasts. Femoral neck BMD and 30 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were first analyzed in 935 postmenopausal women and the association of NR5A2 genetic variants with BMD was explored in other 1284 women in replication cohorts.
NR5A2 was highly expressed in bone. The inhibition of NR5A2 confirmed that it modulates the expression of osteocalcin, osteoprotegerin, and podoplanin in osteoblasts. Two SNPs were associated with BMD in the Spanish discovery cohort (rs6663479, P=0.0014, and rs2816948, P=0.0012). A similar trend was observed in another Spanish cohort, with statistically significant differences across genotypes in the combined analysis (P=0.03). However, the association in a cohort from the United States was rather weak. Electrophoretic mobility assays and studies with luciferase reporter vectors confirmed the existence of differences in the binding of nuclear proteins and the transcriptional activity of rs2816948 alleles.
NR5A2 modulates gene expression in osteoblasts and some allelic variants are associated with bone mass in Spanish postmenopausal women.
Barrett's oesophagus (BO), an intestinal-type metaplasia (IM), typically arising in conjunction with gastro-oesophageal reflux disease, is a prominent risk factor for the development of oesophageal adenocarcinoma (OAC). The molecular similarities between IM and normal intestinal tissues are ill-defined. Consequently, the contribution of intestine-enriched factors expressed within BO to oncogenesis is unclear. Herein, using transcriptomics we define the intestine-enriched genes expressed in meta-profiles of BO and OAC. Interestingly, 77% of the genes differentially expressed in a meta-profile of BO were similarly expressed in intestinal tissues. Furthermore, 85% of this intestine-like signature was maintained upon transition to OAC. Gene networking analysis of transcription factors within this signature revealed a network centred upon NR5A2, GATA6 and FOXA2, whose over-expression was determined in a cohort of BO and OAC patients. Simulated acid reflux was observed to induce the expression of both NR5A2 and GATA6. Using siRNA-mediated silencing and an NR5A2 antagonist we demonstrate that NR5A2-mediated cancer cell survival is facilitated through augmentation of GATA6 and anti-apoptotic factor BCL-XL levels. Abrogation of NR5A2-GATA6 expression in conjunction with BCL-XL co-silencing resulted in synergistically increased sensitivity to chemotherapeutics and photo-dynamic therapeutics. These findings characterize the intestine-like signature associated with IM which may have important consequences to adenocarcinogenesis.
Renal fibrosis is a common histological finding present in many pathologies; however, key signaling pathways and molecular determinants involved in the development of fibrosis are not fully known yet. Previous findings have established a causative role of calreticulin's up-regulation during the development of renal fibrosis while its down-regulation exhibited a protective effect against fibrosis. Therefore, the mechanism of its up-regulation needs to be explored.
Bioinformatics analyses of the calreticulin gene promoter combined with transcriptional assays and in vivo chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments in the Unilateral Ureteric Obstruction (UUO) model of renal fibrosis, indicated that NR5A2 is a critical regulator of calreticulin expression. To confirm this finding, and further study post-translational modifications of NR5A2, real time RT-qPCR, immunohistochemistry and Western blotting experiments were performed.
NR5A2 is up-regulated at both mRNA and protein level during kidney fibrosis in the UUO model. The post-translational modification of SUMOylation was identified as a critical parameter in this phenomenon and SUMOylation was observed to be up-regulated during the development of renal fibrosis. The enzyme Ubc9, critical for the process of SUMOylation was also upregulated at mRNA and protein level during the process.
These data establish for the first time a role for NR5A2 and its SUMOylation on the transcriptional regulation of the calreticulin gene in a rodent model of renal fibrosis and raise the possibility that NR5A2 might be a novel target for future anti-fibrotic interventions.
Pluripotent self-renewing embryonic stem cells (ESCs) have been the focus of a growing number of high-throughput experiments, revealing the genome-wide locations of hundreds of transcription factors and histone modifications. While most of these datasets were used in a specific context, all datasets combined offer a comprehensive view of chromatin characteristics and regulatory elements that govern cell states. Here, using hundreds of datasets in ESCs, we generated colocalization maps of chromatin proteins and modifications, and built a discovery pipeline for regulatory proteins of gene families. By comparing genome-wide binding data with over-expression and knockdown analysis of hundreds of genes, we discovered that the pluripotency-related factor NR5A2 separates mitochondrial from cytosolic ribosomal genes, regulating their expression. We further show that genes with a common chromatin profile are enriched for distinct Gene Ontology (GO) categories. Our approach can be generalized to reveal common regulators of any gene group; discover novel gene families, and identify common genomic elements based on shared chromatin features.
Preterm birth (PTB) is a major cause of neonatal mortality and morbidity. There is strong evidence of genetic susceptibility. Objective of this study was to identify genetic variants contributing to PTB.
Genotyping was performed for 24 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 4 candidate genes (NR5A2, FSHR, FOXP3, and SERPINH1). Genotyping was completed on 728 maternal triads (mother and maternal grandparents of a preterm infant). Data were analyzed with Family Based Association Test.
For all maternal triads rs2737667 of NR5A2 showed significant association at P = 0.02. When stratifying by gestational age three SNPs in NR5A2 had P values &lt;0.05 in the &lt;32-wk gestational age group (rs12131233, P = 0.007; rs2737667, P = 0.04; rs2816949, P = 0.02). When preterm premature rupture of membranes cases were excluded rs2737667 of NR5A2 showed the strongest association with a P value &lt;0.0002. This association remained significant after correction for multiple testing.
This study suggests a potential association between intronic SNPs in the NR5A2 gene and PTB. NR5A2 gene encodes for the liver receptor homolog-1 protein, which plays a critical role in regulation of cholesterol metabolism, steroidogenesis, and progesterone synthesis. These findings suggest that NR5A2 may be important in the pathophysiology of PTB and exploring noncoding regulators of NR5A2 is warranted.
Preeclampsia (PE) is a multisystem disorder unique to Homo sapiens that is known to cause maternal and perinatal mortality and morbidity. Between 5-7% of all pregnancies are affected by PE and it is responsible for approximately 50,000 maternal deaths annually. The pathogenesis of PE remains poorly understood. However, the results of this study indicated that insufficient decidualization plays a significant role. NR5A1 and NR5A2 are orphan members of the Ftz-F1 subfamily of nuclear receptors and are involved in mammal follicular development, female reproduction, steroidogenesis, and decidualization. The expression of NR5A1 and NR5A2 in the human decidua and their functions during decidualization were investigated using in vitro cultured cells by real-time PCR, immunohistochemistry, western blotting, and siRNA techniques. The results demonstrated that the levels of NR5A2 mRNA and protein in the decidual tissues of women with PE were lower than those of normal pregnant women. However, the levels of NR5A1 mRNA and protein did not significantly differ between groups. The expression of NR5A2 was upregulated after in vitro decidualization, but the expression of NR5A1 remained low and showed no difference compared with that of the control cells. Knocking down of NR5A2 in human endometrial stromal cells (hESC) resulted in a significant reduction in their expression of decidualization markers (IGFBP1 and PRL) and signaling pathway molecules (WNT4 and BMP2) (P &lt; 0.05). From these data, we concluded that NR5A2 is pivotal for the decidualization of decidual tissues and cultured human endometrial stromal cells. Disorders of the endometrium in decidual tissues may be associated with the abnormal decidualization thought to cause PE. 
We genotyped 2 SNPs (rs3790844 T/C and rs3790843 G/A) in the NR5A2 gene that were identified in a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of pancreatic cancer in populations of mainly European ancestry, and we examined their associations with pancreatic cancer risk in a case-control study of 360 patients and 400 control subjects in Japan. Unconditional logistic regression models were used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). The SNPs were in linkage disequilibrium (r(2) = 0.80). For rs3790843, the multivariable-adjusted OR was 0.75 (95% CI: 0.41-1.36) and 0.60 (95%CI: 0.33-1.08) for subjects with the AG and AA genotype, respectively, compared to subjects with the GG genotype. The per allele OR was 0.78 (0.62-0.99) (P = 0.046). For rs3790844, the multivariable-adjusted OR was 0.65 (95% CI: 0.37-1.14) and 0.47 (95%CI: 0.27-0.83) for subjects with the CT and CC genotype, respectively, compared to subjects with the TT genotype. The per allele OR was 0.70 (0.56-0.89) (P = 0.003). Our case-control study found that rs3790843 and rs3790844 in the NR5A2 gene are associated with pancreatic cancer risk in Japanese subjects. The direction of association is consistent with the prior findings from GWASs. 
NR5A2 has been implicated in processes as diverse as steroidogenesis, cellular proliferation, ovarian follicular development, ovulation, and fertility in mammals. However, data about the relationship between NR5A2 and prolificacy in mammals are lacking. In the present study, we identified and characterized NR5A2 of Hu sheep, and investigated the correlation between NR5A2 and reproductive performance. The full-length coding region was 1488 bp, and the gene was conserved in mammals. We found a positive correlation between NR5A2 mRNA levels in the ovary and the ovulation rate and litter size of Hu sheep. We detected two single nucleotide polymorphisms (T40C and T1419C) in the coding sequence of NR5A2. At the third and average parity, litter size of Hu ewes with CC genotype at T40C locus was larger than those of ewes with TT or TC genotypes; at the T1419C locus, Hu ewes with TT genotype was greater than those of ewes with CC genotype at the third parity. Our findings demonstrated that NR5A2 was associated with reproductive performance in Hu sheep, a high prolificacy breed.
This snapshot reviews the current state of knowledge on genetic variants of nuclear receptors (NRs) involved in regulating various aspects of liver metabolism. Interindividual differences in responses to diet and other 'in-' and environmental stressors can be caused by variants in components of the NR regulatory gene network. We recapitulate recent evidence for the application of NRs in genetic diagnosis of monogenic liver disease. Genetic analysis of multifactorial liver diseases, such as nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and diabetes mellitus, pinpoints key players in disease predisposition and progression. In particular, NR1H4 variants have been associated with intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy and gallstone disease. Other examples include studies of NR1I2 and NR1I3 polymorphisms in patients with drug-induced liver injury and NR5A2 variation in cholangiocarcinoma. Associations of NR gene variants have been identified in patients with dyslipidemia and other metabolic syndrome-associated traits by genome-wide studies. Evidence from these analyses confirms a role for NR variation in common diseases, linking regulatory networks to complex and variable phenotypes. These new insights into the impact of NR variants offer perspectives for their future use in diagnosis and treatment of common diseases.
Chronic inflammation increases the risk of developing one of several types of cancer. Inflammatory responses are currently thought to be controlled by mechanisms that rely on transcriptional networks that are distinct from those involved in cell differentiation. The orphan nuclear receptor NR5A2 participates in a wide variety of processes, including cholesterol and glucose metabolism in the liver, resolution of endoplasmic reticulum stress, intestinal glucocorticoid production, pancreatic development and acinar differentiation. In genome-wide association studies, single nucleotide polymorphisms in the vicinity of NR5A2 have previously been associated with the risk of pancreatic adenocarcinoma. In mice, Nr5a2 heterozygosity sensitizes the pancreas to damage, impairs regeneration and cooperates with mutant Kras in tumour progression. Here, using a global transcriptomic analysis, we describe an epithelial-cell-autonomous basal pre-inflammatory state in the pancreas of Nr5a2+/- mice that is reminiscent of the early stages of pancreatitis-induced inflammation and is conserved in histologically normal human pancreases with reduced expression of NR5A2 mRNA. In Nr5a2+/-mice, NR5A2 undergoes a marked transcriptional switch, relocating from differentiation-specific to inflammatory genes and thereby promoting gene transcription that is dependent on the AP-1 transcription factor. Pancreatic deletion of Jun rescues the pre-inflammatory phenotype, as well as binding of NR5A2 to inflammatory gene promoters and the defective regenerative response to damage. These findings support the notion that, in the pancreas, the transcriptional networks involved in differentiation-specific functions also suppress inflammatory programmes. Under conditions of genetic or environmental constraint, these networks can be subverted to foster inflammation.
Alpha-1-fetoprotein (AFP) is used to monitor progression, evaluate response to therapy and predict recurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in liver transplantation (LTx) patients. To date, the diagnostic value of serum AFP determinations for detecting tumor recurrence in HCC patients after LTx is unclear.
A retrospective, single-center, cross-sectional, non-interventional study was performed with the objective of determining post-transplant cut-off AFP values for detecting HCC recurrence post LTx.
Using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses, post-transplant serum AFP values were evaluated against HCC recurrences in 63 HCC patients who had LTx between November 1995 and December 2011 at the University Medical Center Göttingen (UMG). Optimal and application-independent cut points for predicting tumor recurrence at 1, 3, and 5years after LTx were determined.
Post-LTx serum AFP was found to represent an independent risk factor (predictor) for HCC relapse. Post-operative AFP cut-off values of 7μg/l, 6μg/l, and 6μg/l, respectively, were determined to be optimal at 1, 3, and 5years after LTx respectively for predicting a HCC relapse. Using these cut-off values, patients were correctly classified as relapse-positive with a diagnostic sensitivity of 79%, 81%, and 77%, and as relapse-free with a specificity of 82%, 79%, and 69%. The diagnostic accuracy measured by area under the curve (AUC) values ranged from 0.813 to 0.886. However, a limitation is that at a clinically relevant specificity of ≥95%, the analyses showed sensitivity values of only 50%, 52%, and 50%, respectively.
Post-transplant serum AFP may have diagnostic value to detect HCC recurrence after LTx.
We comparatively analyzed serially autopsied, elderly Japanese patients (n = 2205) with pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasias (PanINs) and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas (PDACs) on the basis of their pancreatic lesions, clinical information, and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). The incidence of PanIN-1, -2, -3, and PDACs in these patients was 55%, 12%, 1.4%, and 2.4%, respectively. The occurrence of PanINs was associated with female sex, increasing age, and lower body mass index. We did not identify any common SNPs between PanINs and PDACs. There were no common SNPs associated with PanINs and PDACs between men and women. In previously reported pancreatic cancer-associated SNPs, rs3790844 (NR5A2) showed a significant correlation with PDAC in our cohort. Six SNPs (rs7016880, rs10096633, rs10503669, rs12678919, rs17482753, rs328) that were correlated with blood lipid levels were associated with the risk for PDACs. Our data suggest that different clinicopathological characteristics and predispositions may affect pancreatic carcinogenesis in elderly Japanese patients.
Novel fusion transcripts (FTs) caused by chromosomal rearrangement are common factors in the development of cancers. In the current study, the authors used massively parallel RNA sequencing to identify new FTs in colon cancers.
RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) and TopHat-Fusion were used to identify new FTs in colon cancers. The authors then investigated whether the novel FT nuclear receptor subfamily 5, group A, member 2 (NR5A2)-Kelch-like family member 29 FT (KLHL29FT) was transcribed from a genomic chromosomal rearrangement. Next, the expression of NR5A2-KLHL29FT was measured by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction in colon cancers and matched corresponding normal epithelia.
The authors identified the FT NR5A2-KLHL29FT in normal and cancerous epithelia. While investigating this transcript, it was unexpectedly found that it was due to an uncharacterized polymorphic germline insertion of the NR5A2 sequence from chromosome 1 into the KLHL29 locus at chromosome 2, rather than a chromosomal rearrangement. This germline insertion, which occurred at a population frequency of 0.40, appeared to bear no relationship to cancer development. Moreover, expression of NR5A2-KLHL29FT was validated in RNA specimens from samples with insertions of NR5A2 at the KLHL29 gene locus, but not from samples without this insertion. It is interesting to note that NR5A2-KLH29FT expression levels were significantly lower in colon cancers than in matched normal colonic epithelia (P =.029), suggesting the potential participation of NR5A2-KLHL29FT in the origin or progression of this tumor type.
NR5A2-KLHL29FT was generated from a polymorphism insertion of the NR5A2 sequence into the KLHL29 locus. NR5A2-KLHL29FT may influence the origin or progression of colon cancer. Moreover, researchers should be aware that similar FTs may occur due to transchromosomal insertions that are not correctly annotated in genome databases, especially with current assembly algorithms.

Estrogen-dependent breast cancer is often treated with the aromatase inhibitors or estrogen receptor (ER) antagonists. Tamoxifen as a major ER antagonist is usually used to treat those patients with ERα-positive breast cancer. However, a majority of patients with ERα positive fail to respond to tamoxifen due to the presence of intrinsic or acquired resistance to the drug. Altered expression and functions of microRNAs (miRNAs) have been reportedly associated with tamoxifen resistance. In this study, we investigated the role of miR-27b-3p in resistance of breast cancer to tamoxifen. MiR-27b-3p levels were remarkably reduced in the tamoxifen-resistant breast cancer cells compared with their parental cells. In addition, miR-27b-3p was also significantly downregulated in breast tumor tissues relative to adjacent non-tumor tissues. Moreover, the expression levels of miR-27b-3p were lower in the breast cancer tissues from tamoxifen-resistant patients compared with that from untreated-tamoxifen patients. Notably, tamoxifen repressed miR-27b-3p expression, whereas estrogen induced miR-27b-3p expression in breast cancer cells. Besides, we provided experimental evidences that miR-27b-3p enhances the sensitivity of breast cancer cells to tamoxifen in vitro and in vivo models. More importantly, we validated that miR-27b-3p directly targeted and inhibited the expression of nuclear receptor subfamily 5 group A member 2 (NR5A2) and cAMP-response element binding protein 1 (CREB1) and therefore augmented tamoxifen-induced cytotoxicity in breast cancer. Lastly, miR-27b-3p levels were found to be significantly negatively correlated with both NR5A2 and CREB1 levels in breast cancer tissues. Our findings provided further evidence that miR-27b-3p might be considered as a novel and potential target for the diagnosis and treatment of tamoxifen-resistant breast cancer.
We report the identification of substituted cis-bicyclo[3.3.0]-oct-2-enes as small molecule agonists of subfamily V orphan nuclear receptors (NR5A), liver receptor homolog-1 (LRH-1) and steroidogenic factor-1 (SF-1). Using fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based biochemical assays, compound 5a (GSK8470) was identified as a high-affinity ligand for LRH-1 and SF-1. In liver cells, 5a increased the expression of the LRH-1 target gene small heterodimer partner (SHP). Synthesis of analogues modified at three positions led to the development of compounds with functional selectivity between LRH-1 and SF-1.
Granulosa cells express the closely related orphan nuclear receptors steroidogenic factor-1 (SF-1) and liver receptor homolog-1 (LRH-1). To determine whether SF-1 and LRH-1 have differential effects on steroid production, we compared the effects of overexpressing LRH-1 and SF-1 on estrogen and progesterone production by undifferentiated rat granulosa cells. Adenovirus mediated overexpression of LRH-1 or SF-1 had qualitatively similar effects. Neither LRH-1 nor SF-1 alone stimulated estrogen or progesterone production, but when combined with FSH and testosterone, each significantly augmented progesterone production and mRNAs for cholesterol side-chain cleavage enzyme and 3beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase above that observed with FSH alone, with SF-1 being more effective than LRH-1. LRH-1 did not augment FSH-stimulated estrogen production, whereas SF-1 produced only a slight ( approximately 30%) augmentation of FSH-stimulated estrogen production. The stimulatory actions of both were reduced by overexpression of dosage-sensitive sex reversal, adrenal hypoplasia congenita, critical region on the X chromosome, gene 1. Expression of either LRH-1 or SF-1 together with constitutively active protein kinase B in the absence of FSH stimulated progesterone production and mRNAs for 3beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase and cholesterol side-chain cleavage enzyme but did not stimulate estrogen production or mRNA for aromatase. These findings demonstrate that LRH-1 and SF-1 have qualitatively similar actions on FSH-stimulated estrogen and progesterone production, which would suggest that these factors may have overlapping actions in the regulation of steroidogenesis that accompanies granulosa cell differentiation.
The apical sodium dependent bile acid transporter (ASBT) mediates ileal bile acid reabsorption. The transcription factors, liver receptor homologue-1 (LRH-1:mouse) and fetoprotein transcription factor (FTF:human), are presumably orthologues. Bile-acid induced negative feedback regulation of mouse (m) and human (h) ASBT occurs via LRH-1 and RAR/RXR, respectively. hASBT has a potential FTF cis-element, although its functional role is unknown. hASBT and mASBT promoter constructs and an FTF cis-element mutated hASBT (hASBT/FTFmu) were assessed in human Caco-2 cells treated with chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) and/or co-transfected with hFTF, mLRH-1, or specific small interfering FTF or LRH-1 RNA (siFTF or siLRH). Basal promoter activity was reduced in hASBT/FTFmu, although bile acid response persisted. hFTF activated hASBT but not mASBT, while mLRH-1 activated mASBT but not hASBT. siFTF reduced hASBT but not mASBT activity; siLRH reduced mASBT but not hASBT activity. siLRH but not siFTF abrogated bile acid responsiveness. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays demonstrated distinct and specific binding of the mLRH-1 or hFTF cis-elements. In conclusion, FTF and LRH-1 are two related but different transcription factors in human Caco-2 cells, suggesting that they may be homologues and not orthologues. FTF is not involved directly in bile acid mediated negative feedback regulation of the ASBT.
The functional interaction between the orphan nuclear receptors small heterodimer partner (SHP) and liver receptor homolog 1 (LRH-1), where SHP binds to LRH-1 and represses its constitutive transcriptional activity, is crucial for regulating genes involved in cholesterol homeostasis. Here, we report structural and biochemical analyses of the LRH-1/SHP interaction. The crystal structure and modeling studies of the LRH-1 ligand-binding domain bound to either of the two LXXLL-related motifs of SHP show that the receptor undergoes conformational changes to accommodate the SHP docking and reveal key residues that determine the potency and selectivity of SHP binding. Through a combination of mutagenesis and binding studies, we demonstrate that only the second SHP LXXLL motif is required for repressing LRH-1, and this motif displays a strong preference for binding to LRH-1 over the closely related receptor steroidogeneic factor 1 (SF-1). Structural comparisons indicate that this binding selectivity is determined by residues flanking the core LXXLL motifs. These results establish a structural model for understanding how SHP interacts with LRH-1 to regulate cholesterol homeostasis and provide new insights into how nuclear receptor/coregulator selectivity is achieved.
Steroidogenic factor-1 (SF-1) and liver receptor homologue-1 (LRH-1) belong to the fushi tarazu factor 1 subfamily of nuclear receptors. SF-1 is an essential factor for sex determination during development and regulates adrenal and gonadal steroidogenesis in the adult, whereas LRH-1 is a critical factor for development of endodermal tissues and regulates cholesterol and bile acid homeostasis. Regulatory ligands are unknown for SF-1 and LRH-1. A reported mouse LRH-1 structure revealed an empty pocket in a region commonly occupied by ligands in the structures of other nuclear receptors, and pocket-filling mutations did not alter the constitutive activity observed. Here we report the crystal structures of the putative ligand-binding domains of human SF-1 at 2.1-A resolution and human LRH-1 at 2.5-A resolution. Both structures bind a coactivator-derived peptide at the canonical activation-function surface, thus adopting the transcriptionally activating conformation. In human LRH-1, coactivator peptide binding also occurs to a second site. We discovered in both structures a phospholipid molecule bound in a pocket of the putative ligand-binding domain. MS analysis of the protein samples used for crystallization indicated that the two proteins associate with a range of phospholipids. Mutations of the pocket-lining residues reduced the transcriptional activities of SF-1 and LRH-1 in mammalian cell transfection assays without affecting their expression levels. These results suggest that human SF-1 and LRH-1 may be ligand-binding receptors, although it remains to be seen if phospholipids or possibly other molecules regulate SF-1 or LRH-1 under physiological conditions.
A great number of nuclear factors are involved in the negative feedback mechanism regulating bile acid synthesis. There are two major ways for the negative feedback to effect the synthesis; the SHP-dependent, involving FXR, and the SHP-independent way, affecting HNF-4alpha. We studied 23 patients with gallstone disease. Eight patients were treated with chenodeoxycholic acid, 7 with cholestyramine prior to operation, and 8 served as controls. Liver biopsies were analyzed with Real-time-PCR. In the cholestyramine-treated group mRNA levels of CYP7A1 were increased about 10-fold. Treatment with CDCA decreased the mRNA levels of CYP7A1 by about 70%. The mRNA levels of CYP8B1, CYP27A1, and CYP7B1 were not significantly altered in the treated groups. The analysis of mRNA levels for HNF-4alpha showed 64% higher levels in the cholestyramine-treated group compared to the controls. These levels showed positive and highly significant correlation to the levels of mRNA of CYP7A1 when studied in all three groups together. FXR, SHP, and LRH-1/FTF were not significantly affected by the different treatments. Our results indicate that when bile acid synthesis is upregulated by cholestyramine treatment the SHP-independent pathway for controlling CYP7A1 transcription dominates over the SHP-dependent pathway.
DAX1 (dosage sensitive sex reversal (DSS), adrenal hypoplasia congenita (AHC) critical region on the X chromosome, gene 1) encoded by the gene NR0B1, is an unusual orphan nuclear receptor that when mutated causes AHC with associated hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (HH), and when duplicated causes DSS. DAX1 expression has been shown in all regions of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal-gonadal (HPAG) axis during development and in adult tissues, suggesting a critical role for DAX1 in the normal development and function of this axis. Steroidogenic factor 1 (SF1, NR5A1) knockout mice show similar developmental defects as AHC and HH patients, but paradoxically, DAX1 is a negative coregulator of SF1 transactivation. The function of DAX1 as an antagonist of SF1 in gonadal development is consistent with the fact that in humans, duplication of the region of the X chromosome containing DAX1 causes a similar phenotype as mutations in SF1. However, how disruption of DAX1 leads to adrenal, hypothalamic, and pituitary developmental defects similar to SF1 disruption remains to be clarified. The exact mechanism of DAX1 action in each of these tissues during adulthood and critical stages of development are not fully understood. Recent evidence suggests a broader functional role for DAX1 as a negative coregulator of estrogen receptor (ER, NR3A1-2), liver receptor homologue-1 (LRH-1, NR5A2), androgen receptor (AR, NR3C4), and progesterone receptor (PR, NR3C3), each by distinct repression mechanisms. DAX1 may have pleiotropic roles in addition to its function as a negative regulator of steroidogenesis during the development and adult function of the HPAG axis.
Cholesterol 7-alpha-hydroxylase (CYP7A1) catalyzes a rate-limiting step in bile acid synthesis in liver, and its gene transcription is under complex regulation by multiple nuclear receptors in response to bile acids, cholesterol derivatives, and hormones. The liver receptor homolog-1 (LRH-1), a member of the fushi tarazu factor 1 subfamily of nuclear receptors, has emerged as an essential regulator for the expression of cyp7a1. In this report, we demonstrate Prox1, a prospero-related homeobox transcription factor, identified through a yeast two-hybrid screening, can directly interact with human LRH-1 (hLRH-1) and suppresses hLRH-1-mediated transcriptional activation of human cyp7a1 gene. Biochemical analysis demonstrates that Prox1 interacts with both the ligand binding domain (LBD) and the DNA binding domain (DBD) of hLRH-1. An LRKLL motif in Prox1 is important for the interaction with the LBD but not the DBD of hLRH-1. In hLRH-1 LBD, helices 2 and 10 are essential for Prox1 recruitment. The suppression by Prox1 on the transcriptional activity of hLRH-1 can be mediated through its interaction with the LBD or the DBD of hLRH-1. Gel shift assays reveal that Prox1 impairs the binding of hLRH-1 to the promoter of human cyp7a1 gene.
The liver receptor homolog 1 (LRH-1) belongs to the Fushi tarazu factor 1 nuclear receptor subfamily, and its biological functions are just being unveiled. The molecular mechanism for the transcriptional regulation by LRH-1 is not clear yet. In this report, we use mutagenesis and reporter gene assays to carry out a detailed analysis on the hinge region and the proximal ligand binding domain (LBD) of human (h) LRH-1 that possess important regulatory functions. Our results indicate that helix 1 of the LBD is essential for the activity of hLRH-1 and that the steroid receptor coactivator (SRC)-1 interacts directly with the LBD of hLRH-1 and significantly potentiates the transcriptional activity of hLRH-1. Cotransfection assays demonstrate that overexpressed SRC-1 potentiates hLRH-1 mediated activation of the cholesterol 7-alpha-hydroxylase promoter and increases the transcription of the endogenous cholesterol 7-alpha-hydroxylase in Huh7 cells. The interaction between SRC-1 and hLRH-1 assumes a unique pattern that involves primarily a region containing the glutamine-rich domain of SRC-1, and helix 1 and activation function-2 of hLRH-1 LBD. Mutagenesis and molecular modeling studies indicate that, similar to mouse LRH-1, the coactivator-binding cleft of hLRH-1 LBD is not optimized. An interaction between helix 1 of hLRH-1 LBD and a region containing the glutamine-rich domain of SRC-1 can provide an additional stabilizing force and enhances the recruitment of SRC-1. Similar interaction is observed between hLRH-1 and SRC-2/transcriptional intermediary factor 2 or SRC-3/acetyltransferase. Moreover, transcriptional intermediary factor 2 and acetyltransferase also potentiate the transcriptional activity of hLRH-1, suggesting a functional redundancy among SRC family members. These findings collectively demonstrate an important functional role of helix 1 in cofactor recruitment and reveal a novel molecular mechanism of transcriptional regulation and cofactor recruitment mediated by hLRH-1.
Two key regulatory enzymes in the bile acid biosynthesis pathway are cholesterol 7alpha-hydroxylase/CYP7A1 (7alpha-hydroxylase) and sterol 12alpha-hydroxylase/CYP8B1 (12alpha-hydroxylase). It has been shown previously that hepatocyte nuclear factor-4alpha (HNF-4) and the alpha(1)-fetoprotein transcription factor (FTF) are activators of 7alpha-and 12alpha-hydroxylase transcription and that the small heterodimer partner (SHP) suppresses bile acid biosynthesis by heterodimerizing with FTF. However, the role of FTF in bile acid biosynthesis has been studied only in tissue culture systems. In heterozygous FTF knockout mice, 7alpha- and 12alpha-hydroxylase genes were expressed at 5-7-fold higher levels than in wild-type mice, an apparent direct contradiction to previous in vitro observations. This higher expression of the 7alpha- and 12alpha-hydroxylase genes resulted in a 33% higher bile acid pool in their gallbladders, bile more enriched in cholic acid, and a 13% decrease in plasma cholesterol levels. Adenovirus-mediated FTF overexpression in wild-type mice resulted in 10-fold lower expression of the 7alpha- and 12alpha-hydroxylase genes and up to 8-fold higher SHP expression, highlighting the dual role that FTF plays in different promoters. Shorter overexpression times still resulted in lower 7alpha- and 12alpha-hydroxylase expression, but unchanged SHP expression, suggesting that two different mechanisms are involved in the FTF-mediated suppression of 7alpha- and 12alpha-hydroxylase expression. This FTF-mediated suppression of the expression of two bile acid biosynthesis genes resulted in a 3-fold lower rate of bile acid synthesis in a rat bile fistula animal model. Based on these observations and on protein binding studies performed in vitro and by chromatin immunoprecipitation, we hypothesize that FTF has two synergetic effects that contribute to its role in bile acid biosynthesis: 1) it has the ability to activate the expression of SHP, which in turn heterodimerizes and suppresses FTF transactivation activity; and 2) it occupies the FTF/HNF-4 recognition site within the 7alpha- and 12alpha-hydroxylase promoters, which can otherwise be occupied by a factor (HNF-4) that cannot be suppressed by SHP.
Estrogen synthesis from C19 precursors is catalyzed by aromatase cytochrome P450. Overexpression of aromatase through atypical promoter usage (use of promoter II) in adipose tissue contributes to breast cancer development and progression. One tumor-derived factor that appears to contribute to this process is prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). A factor that regulates aromatase expression downstream of PGE2 is liver receptor homolog-1 (LRH-1). In a study of factors that inhibit LRH-1, we have examined the ability of short heterodimer partner (SHP) to inhibit aromatase transcription mediated by LRH-1 in preadipocytes. RT-PCR analysis indicated that both LRH-1 and SHP are expressed in human preadipocytes. To assess the effect of SHP on aromatase transcription, a transient transfection system was established using 3T3-L1 preadipocytes. Expression of SHP completely inhibited activity of an aromatase promoter II reporter gene induced by LRH-1. The combined treatment of forskolin and phorbol ester (which mimic PGE2) as well as LRH-1, which maximally induced reporter gene expression (140-fold), was also completely inhibited by SHP. This effect of SHP was mediated by inhibition of LRH-1 transcriptional activity, as measured by activity of GAL4-LRH-1 fusion constructs, and by inhibition of LRH-1 binding to promoter II. We conclude that SHP is a potent inhibitor of aromatase transcription in preadipocytes. Modulation of SHP expression and/or activity in adipose tissue may therefore have significant effects on aromatase expression and estrogen production in breast adipose tissue.
Steroidogenic factor-1 (SF-1) (NR5A1) is an orphan nuclear receptor that plays a premier role in ovarian organogenesis. Recent studies document mRNA expression of the structurally related factor NR5A2 (FTF, LRH-1, SF-2) in the adult ovary and more specifically in granulosa cells and luteal cells but not theca cells. Conversely, SF-1 was shown to be expressed at higher levels in theca/interstitial cells. These latter observations raised the possibility that FTF/LRH-1 may control target gene expression in granulosa cells of developing follicles. Using quantitative PCR our results show that FTF/LRH-1 message is expressed at higher levels in the ovary than in liver or other tissues analyzed. We show by in situ hybridization and LacZ expression in ovaries of transgenic mice bearing an FTF-promoter-LacZ fusion gene that FTF/LRH-1 is selectively expressed in granulosa cells of rat and mouse ovaries and is not present in theca cells or interstitial cells. However, by a variety of approaches, we showed that SF-1 mRNA and protein are expressed in greater amounts than FTF/LRH-1 in granulosa cells of follicles at all stages of development. Expression of SF-1 mRNA and protein in granulosa cells was verified by in situ hybridization, immunohistochemistry of ovarian sections, and immunocytochemistry of cultured rat granulosa cells. The significance of SF-1 in regulating target gene activation was supported by EMSA. An abundant granulosa cell protein binding to the SF-1-binding motif (CCAAGGTCA) present in the aromatase promoter and an FTF/LRH-1 motif (TGTCCTTGAACA) in the alpha-fetoprotein promoter was supershifted by two SF-1-specific antibodies but not by an FTF antibody. Conversely, with the same probes, a less abundant protein/DNA complex present in liver and ovarian cell extracts was shifted by an FTF antibody but not by the SF-1 antibodies. SF-1 and FTF/LRH-1 were differentially regulated in vivo by estradiol, FSH and prolactin. Collectively these data indicate that granulosa cells of small and preovulatory follicles express both SF-1 and FTF/LRH-1 and that each orphan receptor may regulate target gene expression in these cells.
Three new publications reveal that the nuclear receptors LRH-1, DHR38, and Nurr1 can assume active conformations in the absence of a ligand agonist. These reports help elucidate how transcriptional regulators are themselves regulated.
Liver receptor homologue 1 (LRH-1) is a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily originally found in liver cells. LRH-1 participates in regulation of cholesterol metabolism and bile acid synthesis. Recent studies have shown that LRH-1 is even more highly expressed in the ovary, and LRH-1 has been implicated as a key transcriptional regulator of cytochrome P450 aromatase (P450arom) in vitro. In the present study, we investigated the spatiotemporal expression patterns of LRH-1 using in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry in ovaries from rats with a 4-day estrous cycle, from pregnant rats, from immature rats treated with eCG to stimulate follicular development, and from eCG-treated rats that were subsequently given hCG to stimulate ovulation and luteinization. To establish a potential connection between the expression of LRH-1 and that of the steroidogenic genes in vivo, we directly compared the localization patterns of LRH-1 and P450arom transcripts in consecutive ovarian sections from these animals. LRH-1 mRNA and protein were primarily localized to granulosa cells and luteinized follicles or newly formed corpora lutea (CLs) of immature and adult rats, and the levels of expression increased during eCG-hCG-induced follicular development and ovulation. In the functional CLs of pregnant rats, a biphasic change in LRH-1 mRNA content occurred throughout the gestation process, whereas LRH-1 protein was persistently detected during the entire pregnancy. In the consecutive ovarian sections, expression of LRH-1 was approximately colocalized with that of P450arom in both tertiary and Graafian follicles and the functional CLs of pregnant rats. LRH-1 mRNA and protein expression preceded those of P450arom during early follicular development. Stage-specific expression of LRH-1 in rat granulosa and luteal cells suggests a role for LRH-1 in the regulation of ovarian function. The overlapping but distinct expression patterns of LRH-1 and P450arom circumstantially support the recent finding that LRH-1 serves as a critical upstream regulator of P450arom gene expression in ovarian cells, but LRH-1 also may be a multifunctional steroidogenic factor in ovarian physiology.
The orphan receptor Ad4BP/SF-1 (NR5A1) is a constitutive activator, and its activity is repressed by another orphan receptor, Dax-1 (NR0B1). In the present study, we investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying this repression by Dax-1. Yeast two-hybrid and transient-transfection assays confirmed the necessity of three LXXLL-related motifs in Dax-1 for interaction with and repression of Ad4BP/SF-1. In vitro pull-down experiments confirmed that Dax-1 interacts with Ad4BP/SF-1 and also with LRH-1 (NR5A2). The target specificity of the LXXLL-related motifs was indicated by the observations that Ad4BP/SF-1, ERalpha (NR3A1), LRH-1, ERR2 (NR3B2), and fly FTZ-F1 (NR5A3) interacted through their ligand binding domains with all the LXXLL-related motifs in Dax-1 whereas HNF4 (NR2A1) and RORalpha (NR1F1) did not. Transcriptional activities of the receptors whose DNA binding domains (DBDs) were replaced by the GAL4 DBD were repressed by Dax-1 to various levels, which correlated with the strength of interaction. Amino acid substitutions revealed that Ad4BP/SF-1 and LRH-1 preferentially interact with L(+1)XXLL-related motifs containing serine, tyrosine, serine, and threonine at positions -2, +2, +3, and +6, respectively. Taken together, our results indicate that the specificities of LXXLL-related motifs in Dax-1 based on their amino acid sequences play an important role in regulation of orphan receptors.
Liver receptor homologue-1 (LRH-1, designated NR5A2) is a mammalian homologue of Drosophila fushi tarazu factor (dFTZ-F1) and structurally belongs to the orphan nuclear receptor superfamily. LRH-1 can recognize the DNA sequence 5'-AAGGTCA-3', the canonical recognition motif for steroidogenic factor 1 (SF-1). Herein, we hypothesized that LRH-1 might play a role in the regulation of human adrenal expression of steroidogenic enzymes. To test this hypothesis, LRH-1 expression in human adult and fetal adrenal glands was examined by RT-PCR analysis. The fetal and adult adrenal glands, as well as liver and pancreas, were observed to express LRH-1 mRNA using RT-PCR. The ability of LRH-1 to enhance transcription of the gene encoding human 11 beta- hydroxylase (hCYP11B1) was then examined using the H295R adrenal cell line. LRH-1 co-transfection with hCYP11B1 luciferase promoter constructs caused a 25-fold induction of luciferase activity. Furthermore, co-transfection of a hCYP11B1 reporter construct containing a mutation in the SF-1 binding cis-element abolished the stimulatory effect of both SF-1 and LRH-1. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) demonstrated that LRH-1 could bind to the SF-1 response element. Taken together, our data suggested that LRH-1 is expressed in the adrenal, and can substitute for SF-1 to enhance transcription of genes encoding certain of the steroid-metabolizing enzymes. A role for LRH-1 in the regulation of adrenal or gonadal steroid hormone production should be further studied.
Fushi tarazu transcription factor-1 (FTZ-F1), a member of the nuclear hormone receptor superfamily, is a regulator for fushi tarazu gene expression in Drosophila. Its expression pattern during organogenesis in vertebrates, however, is not known yet. In this study, we cloned a frog FTZ-F1 homologue (rrFTZ-F1alpha) and analyzed its expression and localization during gonadal development of the frog Rana rugosa. Cloned rrFTZ-F1alpha cDNA encoded a protein of 501 amino acids including the regions I-III and FTZ-F1 box that are evolutionally conserved in the FTZ-F1 superfamily. rrFTZ-F1alpha shared high similarity at the amino acid level with mouse LRH-1 (76%), human FTF (92%), chicken OR2.0 (92%), Xenopus laevis FF1rA (94%) and zebrafish FF1A (82%). Northern blot analysis showed that the rrFTZ-F1alpha mRNA at a size of 7.4 kb was the most prominent in the testis among various tissues of adult frogs examined. The RT-PCR analysis revealed that the expression of rrFTZ-F1alpha was weak in the gonad of tadpoles before stage XVI, but it became stronger in the testis of froglets at stage XXV and much higher in the testis of frogs 2 months after metamorphosis. In addition, in situ hybridization analysis revealed that the rrFTZ-F1alpha gene was transcribed in germ cells except for sperm in the testis, and in oocytes at stage A in the ovary of frogs 2 months after metamorphosis. Together, these results suggest that FTZ-F1alpha probably plays an important role in differentiation of germ cells in the gonad of frogs in both sexes.
The alpha1-fetoprotein (AFP) gene is located between the albumin and alpha-albumin genes and is activated by transcription factor FTF (fetoprotein transcription factor), presumed to transduce early developmental signals to the albumin gene cluster. We have identified FTF as an orphan nuclear receptor of the Drosophila FTZ-F1 family. FTF recognizes the DNA sequence 5'-TCAAGGTCA-3', the canonical recognition motif for FTZ-F1 receptors. cDNA sequence homologies indicate that rat FTF is the ortholog of mouse LRH-1 and Xenopus xFF1rA. Rodent FTF is encoded by a single-copy gene, related to the gene encoding steroidogenic factor 1 (SF-1). The 5.2-kb FTF transcript is translated from several in-frame initiator codons into FTF isoforms (54 to 64 kDa) which appear to bind DNA as monomers, with no need for a specific ligand, similar KdS (approximately equal 3 x 10(-10) M), and similar transcriptional effects. FTF activates the AFP promoter without the use of an amino-terminal activation domain; carboxy-terminus-truncated FTF exerts strong dominant negative effects. In the AFP promoter, FTF recruits an accessory trans-activator which imparts glucocorticoid reactivity upon the AFP gene. FTF binding sites are found in the promoters of other liver-expressed genes, some encoding liver transcription factors; FTF, liver alpha1-antitrypsin promoter factor LFB2, and HNF-3beta promoter factor UF2-H3beta are probably the same factor. FTF is also abundantly expressed in the pancreas and may exert differentiation functions in endodermal sublineages, similar to SF-1 in steroidogenic tissues. HepG2 hepatoma cells seem to express a mutated form of FTF.
BmFTZ-F1 is a sequence-specific DNA-binding factor in the silkworm Bombyx mori sharing similar biochemical characteristics with Drosophila FTZ-F1, a member of the nuclear hormone receptor superfamily. Using DNA sequence homology with FTZ-F1 and information on tryptic peptide sequences of BmFTZ-F1, we isolated a cDNA encoding for BmFTZ-F1. Amino acid sequences in the zinc finger DNA-binding region and the putative ligand-binding domain of BmFTZ-F1 showed strong similarity to not only FTZ-F1 but also its mammalian homologues, LRH-1, ELP, and Ad4BP, suggesting the importance of each region for the function of these proteins. Northern blot analyses of RNA isolated from the middle and posterior silk glands and fat bodies showed that a 6.1-kb BmFTZ-F1 mRNA is present in all tissues so far examined. Expression of BmFTZ-F1 mRNA is intermittent, being high during larval molting and both the larval-pupal and the pupal-adult transformations. Injection of 20-hydroxyecdysone at the third day of the 5th instar larvae induced BmFTZ-F1 mRNA in the posterior silk gland after 24 hr. When 5th instar silk glands were cultured in vitro, BmFTZ-F1 mRNA was induced by a 6-hr exposure to 20-hydroxyecdysone followed by 6 hr in hormone-free medium. These results suggest that BmFTZ-F1 is inducible by decline in the ecdysteroid titer and may play an important role in the development of the silkworm as a transcription factor.
LRH-1 (liver receptor homologue-1), a transcription factor and member of the nuclear receptor superfamily, regulates the expression of its target genes, which are involved in bile acid and cholesterol homoeostasis. However, the molecular mechanisms of transcriptional control by LRH-1 are not completely understood. Previously, we identified Ku80 and Ku70 as LRH-1-binding proteins and reported that they function as co-repressors. In the present study, we identified an additional LRH-1-binding protein, ILF3 (interleukin enhancer-binding factor 3). ILF3 formed a complex with LRH-1 and the other two nuclear receptor co-activators PRMT1 (protein arginine methyltransferase 1) and PGC-1α (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ co-activator-1α). We demonstrated that ILF3, PRMT1 and PGC-1α were recruited to the promoter region of the LRH-1-regulated SHP (small heterodimer partner) gene, encoding one of the nuclear receptors. ILF3 enhanced SHP gene expression in co-operation with PRMT1 and PGC-1α through the C-terminal region of ILF3. In addition, we found that the small interfering RNA-mediated down-regulation of ILF3 expression led to a reduction in the occupancy of PGC-1α at the SHP promoter and SHP expression. Taken together, our results suggest that ILF3 functions as a novel LRH-1 co-activator by acting synergistically with PRMT1 and PGC-1α, thereby promoting LRH-1-dependent gene expression.
The crystal structure of LRH-1 ligand binding domain bound to our previously reported agonist 3-(E-oct-4-en-4-yl)-1-phenylamino-2-phenyl-cis-bicyclo[3.3.0]oct-2-ene 5 is described. Two new classes of agonists in which the bridgehead anilino group from our first series was replaced with an alkoxy or 1-ethenyl group were designed, synthesized, and tested for activity in a peptide recruitment assay. Both new classes gave very active compounds, particularly against SF-1. Structure-activity studies led to excellent dual-LRH-1/SF-1 agonists (e.g., RJW100) as well as compounds selective for LRH-1 (RJW101) and SF-1 (RJW102 and RJW103). The series based on 1-ethenyl substitution was acid stable, overcoming a significant drawback of our original bridgehead anilino-substituted series. Initial studies on the regulation of gene expression in human cell lines showed excellent, reproducible activity at endogenous target genes.
The enzyme aromatase converts androgens to estrogens, which have recently been postulated to be essential for testicular development and fertility. Understanding the mechanisms that regulate aromatase activity in the testis may therefore have implications for treatment of male infertility. Aromatase is encoded by the CYP19 gene, which uses multiple tissue-specific alternative promoters. In the testis, the proximal promoter PII drives aromatase expression. PII activity requires a nuclear receptor half-site, CAAGGTCA, to which two orphan receptors; SF-1 and LRH-1, have been shown to bind in vitro. The aim of this study was to investigate expression of aromatase and LRH-1 in the developing rat testis and define the ability of LRH-1 to induce aromatase expression in the testicular cells where both are expressed. We show that aromatase and LRH-1 are present throughout all stages of development of the rat testis, although the sites and levels of expression vary. The pattern of LRH-1 expression was broadly similar to that of aromatase. In adult animals higher levels of expression were observed in Leydig and germ cells. Over-expression of LRH-1 in primary rat Leydig and germ cells by adenoviral infection strongly increased endogenous aromatase mRNA levels, demonstrating the ability of LRH-1 to stimulate aromatase expression in vivo. We also observed binding of endogenous LRH-1 to the aromatase promoter II by chromatin immunoprecipitation. These data provide evidence that LRH-1 plays an important role in the regulation of testicular aromatase expression, and implicate LRH-1 as a regulator of rat spermatogenesis, in which estrogens are emerging as important mediators.
Somatic cells can be reprogrammed to induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) with the introduction of Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, and c-Myc. Among these four factors, Oct4 is critical in inducing pluripotency because no transcription factor can substitute for Oct4, whereas Sox2, Klf4, and c-Myc can be replaced by other factors. Here we show that the orphan nuclear receptor Nr5a2 (also known as Lrh-1) can replace Oct4 in the derivation of iPSCs from mouse somatic cells, and it can also enhance reprogramming efficiency. Sumoylation mutants of Nr5a2 with enhanced transcriptional activity can further increase reprogramming efficiency. Genome-wide location analysis reveals that Nr5a2 shares many common gene targets with Sox2 and Klf4, which suggests that the transcription factor trio works in concert to mediate reprogramming. We also show that Nr5a2 works in part through activating Nanog. Together, we show that unrelated transcription factors can replace Oct4 and uncovers an exogenous Oct4-free reprogramming code.
The mechanism for transcriptional suppression of CYP19 by mono-ethylhexyl phthalate (MEHP) in a human ovarian granulosa cell line (KGN) was investigated. It is known that the CYP19 gene transcript in KGN cells predominantly includes exon PII among the 11 alternate exon I sequences. MEHP was found to significantly suppress Forskolin (FSK)-induced CYP19 gene transcription, CYP19 promoter II activity and CYP19 enzyme activity in a dose-dependent manner. Promoter assays using 5'-deleted promoter II reporter constructs suggested that the region important for responsiveness to MEHP exposure includes a putative CRE-like sequence and an SF-1 (NR5A1)/LRH-1 (NR5A2) binding sequence. Meanwhile, MEHP exposure rapidly and transiently induced nuclear receptor 4A (NR4A) mRNA, and gradually and continuously induced gonadotropin-inducible ovarian transcription factor-1 (GIOT-1; ZNF461) mRNA in KGN cells. The ectopic expression of NR4As and GIOT-1 suppressed promoter II activity, while among the NR4As expressed, only Nur77 (NR4A1) secondarily induced GIOT-1 mRNA expression. Based on these results, we believe that induction of the Nur77-GIOT-1 system by MEHP is involved in the transcriptional suppression of the CYP19 gene, and GIOT-1 may attenuate the promoter II activity due to suppression of SF-1 and/or LRH-1 transactivation in KGN cells.
Retinol-binding protein (RBP4) transports retinol in the circulation from hepatic stores to peripheral tissues. Since little is known regarding the regulation of this gene, we analysed the cis-regulatory sequences of the mouse RBP4 gene. Our data show that transcription of the gene is regulated through a bipartite promoter: a proximal region necessary for basal expression and a distal segment responsible for cAMP-induction. This latter region contains several binding sites for the structural HMGA1 proteins, which are important to promoter regulation. We further demonstrate that HMGA1s play a key role in basal and cAMP-induction of Rbp4 transcription and the RBP4 and HMGA1 genes are coordinately regulated in vitro and in vivo. HMGA1 acts to recruit transcription factors to the RBP4 promoter and we specifically identified p54(nrb)/NonO and protein-associated splicing factor (PSF) as components that interact with this complex. Steroidogenic factor 1 (SF1) or the related liver receptor homologue 1 (LRH-1) are also associated with this complex upon cAMP-induction. Depletion of SF1/LRH-1 by RNA interference resulted in a dramatic loss of cAMP-induction. Collectively, our results demonstrate that basal and cAMP-induced Rbp4 transcription is regulated by a multiprotein complex that is similar to ones that modulate expression of genes of steroid hormone biosynthesis. Since genes related to glucose metabolism are regulated in a similar fashion, this suggests that Rbp4 expression may be regulated as part of a network of pathways relevant to the onset of type 2 diabetes.
The liver receptor homolog-1 (LRH-1) is an important transcriptional factor in the process of cholesterol and bile acids metabolism. In this article, molecular dynamics simulation for six systems with total 60 ns is employed to study LRH-1. LRH-1/phospholipid and LRH-1/SHP (fragments) interactions are analyzed by counting atomic contact number, identifying hydrogen bonds, and estimating binding free energies (by MM-PB/SA and N-mode analysis). Through integrating our modeling result with previous experimental data, deeper understandings to LRH-1/SHP interaction are obtained, and functions of the phospholipid ligand in LRH-1 are proposed.
The small heterodimer partner (SHP) is an atypical nuclear receptor known mainly for its role in bile acid homeostasis in the enterohepatic tract. We explore here the role of SHP in the testis. SHP is expressed in the interstitial compartment of the adult testes, which contain the Leydig cells. SHP there inhibits the expression of steroidogenic genes, on the one hand by inhibiting the expression of the nuclear receptors steroidogenic factor-1 and liver receptor homolog-1 (lrh-1), and on the other hand by directly repressing the transcriptional activity of LRH-1. Consequently, in SHP knockout mice, testicular testosterone synthesis is increased independently of the hypothalamus-pituitary axis. Independent of its action on androgen synthesis, SHP also determines the timing of germ cell differentiation by controlling testicular retinoic acid metabolism. Through the inhibition of the transcriptional activity of retinoic acid receptors, SHP controls the expression of stimulated by retinoic acid gene 8 (stra8) - a gene that is indispensable for germ cell meiosis and differentiation. Together, our data demonstrate new roles for SHP in testicular androgen and retinoic acid metabolism, making SHP a testicular gatekeeper of the timing of male sexual maturation.
Cellular cholesterol is known to be under homeostatic control in nonsteroidogenic cells, and this intrigued us to understand how such control works in steroidogenic cells that additionally use cholesterol for steroid hormone synthesis. We employed primary culture of rat ovarian granulosa cells to study how steroidogenic cells adapt to acquire sufficient cholesterol to meet the demand of active steroidogenesis under the stimulation of gonadotropin follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and cytokine transforming growth factor (TGF)β1. We found that TGFβ1 potentiated FSH to upregulate scavenger receptor class B member I (SR-BI) and LDL receptor (LDLR), both functional in uptaking cholesterol as hHDL(3) and hLDL supplementation enhanced progesterone production, and the effect of each lipoprotein was completely or partially blocked by SR-BI selective inhibitor BLT-1. Uptaken cholesterol could also be stored in lipid droplets. Importantly, LDLR and SR-BI responded to sterol with different sensitivity. Giving cells lipoproteins or 25-hydroxycholesterol downregulated Ldlr but not Scarb1; Scarb1 was ultimately downregulated by excessive sterol accumulation under 25-hydroxycholesterol and aminoglutethimide (inhibitor of steroidogenesis) cotreatment. Furthermore, transcription factors sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP)-2 and liver receptor homolog (LRH)-1 crucially mediated Ldlr and Scarb1 differential response to sterol challenge. This study reveals that ovarian granulosa cells retain the cholesterol homeostatic control machinery like nonsteroidogenic cells, although during active steroidogenesis, they utilize SR-BI to evade such feedback control.
Fushi tarazu transcription factor-1 (FTZ-F1), a member of a nuclear hormone receptor superfamily, is a transcriptional regulator for fushi tarazu gene expression in Drosophila (Ueda et al., '90). We have cloned a homologue (rrFTZ-F1alpha) of the FTZ-F1 gene of the frog Rana rugosa. The gene, in frogs, has been shown to have high expression level in the testis (Nakajima et al., 2000). In this study, the RT-PCR analysis showed that the FTZ-F1alpha mRNA level in adult frogs did not change throughout the year, even during hibernation. However, when immunohistological studies using the anti-rrFTZ-F1alpha antibody were employed to examine which testicular cells expressed this gene, Sertoli cells were found to produce rrFTZ-F1alpha in the two seasons: the breeding season (from March through May) and the pre-hibernating season (from October through November). Interstitial cells, however, did it in only the breeding season (from April through May). Taken together, the results suggest that the rrFTZ-F1alpha expression is regulated at the post-transcriptional step, and that the rrFTZ-F1alpha may play an important role(s) in the seasonal activities of Sertoli and interstitial cells in the frog testis. J. Exp. Zool. 290:182-189, 2001.
The Drosophila bonus (bon) gene encodes a homolog of the vertebrate TIF1 transcriptional cofactors. bon is required for male viability, molting, and numerous events in metamorphosis including leg elongation, bristle development, and pigmentation. Most of these processes are associated with genes that have been implicated in the ecdysone pathway, a nuclear hormone receptor pathway required throughout Drosophila development. Bon is associated with sites on the polytene chromosomes and can interact with numerous Drosophila nuclear receptor proteins. Bon binds via an LxxLL motif to the AF-2 activation domain present in the ligand binding domain of betaFTZ-F1 and behaves as a transcriptional inhibitor in vivo.
During the last larval molt in Manduca sexta, a number of transcription factors are sequentially expressed. Unlike E75A and MHR3, whose mRNAs are induced when the ecdysteroid titer increases, the expression of MHR4 mRNA occurs transiently at the onset of the decline of ecdysteroid titer followed by betaFTZ-F1 mRNA expression when the ecdysteroid titer becomes low. When day 2 fourth epidermis was exposed to 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E) in vitro, MHR4 mRNA appeared between 12 and 21 h, peaked at 24 h, and then declined. Using the protein synthesis inhibitors cycloheximide and anisomycin both in vivo and in vitro, we found that the MHR4 transcript was directly induced by 20E and required the presence of 20E for its expression. The accumulation of MHR4 mRNA, however, did not occur until a 20E-induced inhibitory protein(s) disappeared. This control of MHR4 expression is unique among the ecdysone-induced transcription factors. When the epidermis was cultured with 20E, betaFTZ-F1 mRNA was not induced until after the removal of 20E as previously found for Drosophila and the silkworm Bombyx mori. The presence of juvenile hormone had no effect on accumulation of either transcript.
The fushi tarazu factor 1 (FTZ-F1) gene family constitutes a subgroup of orphan nuclear receptors which can be divided into two groups (LRH/FTF- and SF-1/Ad4BP-like) based on sequence homology, function, and tissue distribution. Analysis of zebrafish FTZ-F1 homologues (zFF1 and ff1b) during embryogenesis indicated distinct expression patterns for both genes. Besides the previously observed expression in pituitary/hypothalamus and mandibular arch, zFF1 transcripts were also detected in domains corresponding to the pronephric duct, somites, liver, and hindbrain. Additionally, ff1b transcripts were detected at other developmental stages than earlier documented. Comparative sequence analysis showed that zFF1 exhibited higher sequence similarity to the LRH/FTF group than the SF-1/Ad4BP group, whereas ff1b was indistinguishable between the groups. These observations, coupled with obtained expression patterns, indicate that zebrafish FTZ-F1 homologues exhibit characteristics that are indicative of both LRH/FTF- and SF-1/Ad4BP-like genes.
Coactivators MBF1 and MBF2 mediate BmFTZ-F1-dependent transcriptional activation in vitro by interconnecting BmFTZ-F1, TATA binding protein TBP, and TFIIA. Here, we analyzed temporal and spatial expression patterns of MBF2 during embryonic and larval development of the silkworm Bombyx mori. MBF2 was detected in unfertilized eggs and embryos until stage 26. In stage 22 embryos, MBF1, MBF2, and BmFTZ-F1 colocalize in neural cells. During the larval stage, MBF2 was not expressed in the fat body and trachea. In the silk gland, MBF2 mRNA was constitutively expressed, but MBF2 protein appeared in the period between the second day and the molting D3 stage in both the third and the fourth instars and then disappeared. MBF2 was also detected on the second and third days of the fifth instar. Immunostaining during the fourth molt showed that MBF1, MBF2, and BmFTZ-F1 localize in the nucleus only at the D3 stage, while the two cofactors are present in the cytoplasm at other stages. Immunoprecipitation experiments suggested that MBF1, MBF2, and BmFTZ-F1 form a complex at the D3 stage. Transient expression of these factors in Schneider cell line 2 revealed that MBF1 and MBF2 localize to the nucleus and enhance BmFTZ-F1-dependent transcription only when all three factors are present. These data illustrate the functional regulation of MBF1 and MBF2 at the step of nuclear transport and implicate MBF2 in tissue- and stage-specific transcription.
A zebrafish Ftz-F1 homologue, zFF1A (zebrafish Ff1a or Nr5a2, a member of nuclear receptor superfamily) and its C-terminally truncated variant (zFF1B) were previously identified. Due to lack of the identity box (I-box) and activation function 2 (AF-2) domain, zFF1B lacks transactivation function and fails to synergize with estrogen receptor (ER) in regulating promoters. It was speculated that the I-box might be involved in the zFF1A/ER interaction. In the present study, the function of the I-box was examined. In the absence of the I-box or with an altered heptad 9, the AF-2 of zFF1A was not functional, either in the presence or absence of ER. The GST pull-down assay showed that zFF1A and its mutants exerted similar physical contacts with ER-LBD, suggesting that the "dimerization" domain (I-box) is essential for the transcriptional activity of zFF1A. Moreover, nuclear receptor coactivator selectively activated zFF1 with the I-box but exerted no effect on zFF1B, indicating that the I-box is able to interact with the coactivators. By deletion study and analysis of the identified domains in GAL4-DNA binding domain, other regions of zFF1A critical for its AF were also delineated. Consistent with the mutation analysis, AF-2 was active only in the presence of the I-box. We also identified a novel AF domain (AF-3) located in the hinge region (amino acids 155-267), although the activity of AF-3 was inhibited by its flanking region. We suggest that the D and E regions of zFF1A possess both positive and negative transactivation functions, and interdomain "cross-talk" may confer the full transcriptional activity of the protein.
The VAP-peptide (BmACP-6.7) is a hydrophobic peptide localized in adult cuticle of the silkworm, Bombyx mori. We isolated and characterized the VAP-peptide gene as a useful marker gene to analyze molecular mechanisms of terminal differentiation processes in the adult. The gene is composed of two exons interrupted by one intron. The 5' upstream promoter region is shown to bear a nucleotide sequence similar to the cis-element that is recognized and bound by the Bombyx mori FTZ-F1 protein (BmFTZ-F1). Expression of the BmFTZ-F1 gene preceded expression of the VAP-peptide gene and injection of 20-hydroxyecdysone suppressed the expression of both genes. An in vitro binding assay indicated direct interaction of BmFTZ-F1 with the VAP-peptide gene promoter sequence. Therefore, BmFTZ-F1 is proposed to be a possible factor regulating the stage-specific expression of the VAP-peptide gene towards adult life.
Normal endocrine development and function require nuclear hormone receptor SF-1 (steroidogenic factor 1). To understand the molecular mechanism of SF-1 action, we have investigated its domain function by mutagenesis and functional analyses. Our mutant studies show that the putative AF2 (activation function 2) helix located at the C-terminal end is indispensable for gene activation. SF-1 does not have an N-terminal AF1 domain. Instead, it contains a unique FP region, composed of the Ftz-F1 box and the proline cluster, after the zinc finger motif. The FP region interacts with transcription factor IIB (TFIIB) in vitro. This interaction requires residues 178-201 of TFIIB, a domain capable of binding several transcription factors. The FP region also mediates physical interaction with c-Jun, and this interaction greatly enhances SF-1 activity. The putative SF-1 ligand, 25-hydroxycholesterol, has no effects on these bindings. In addition, the Ftz-F1 box contains a bipartite nuclear localization signal (NLS). Removing the basic residues at either end of the key nuclear localization sequence NLS2.2 abolishes the nuclear transport. Expression of mutants containing only the FP region or lacking the AF2 domain blocks wild-type SF-1 activity in cells. By contrast, the mutant having a truncated nuclear localization signal lacks this dominant negative effect. These results delineate the importance of the FP and AF2 regions in nuclear localization, protein-protein interaction, and transcriptional activation.
We have cloned the 5'-region of the murine N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor channel subunit NR2C (GluRepsilon3) gene and characterized the cis- and trans-activating regulatory elements responsible for its tissue specific activity. By using a native epsilon3-promoter/lacZ-construct &amp; various 5'-deletion constructs, we compared beta-galactosidase expression in non-neuronal NIH3T3 cells and in neuronal epsilon3-gene-expressing HT-4 cells and show that large parts of the epsilon3 promoter are responsible for the repression of the epsilon3 gene in non-neuronal cells. Deletion of exon 1 sequences led to an enhancement of epsilon3 transcription, suggesting a role of the 5'-untranslated region in epsilon3 gene regulation. Sequence analysis of the promoter region revealed potential binding sites for the transcription factor Sp1, the murine fushi tarazu factor1 (FTZ-F1) homologues, embryonic LTR binding proteins (ELP1,2,3) and steroidogenic factor (SF-1), as well as for the chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter transcription-factor (COUP-TF). Electrophoretic mobility shift assays confirmed specific binding of Sp1, SF-1 and COUP-TFI. Whereas point mutation studies indicate that, in neuronal HT-4 cells, Sp1 is apparently not critically involved in basal epsilon3 gene transcription, SF1 is a positive regulator. This was evident from a selective enhancement of epsilon3-promoter-driven reporter gene expression upon cotransfection of an SF1-expression vector, which was reverted by deletion and point mutation of the SF1 binding site.
The acquisition of competence is a key mechanism for refining global signals to distinct spatial and temporal responses. The molecular basis of competence, however, remains poorly understood. Here, we show that the beta FTZ-F1 orphan nuclear receptor functions as a competence factor for stage-specific responses to the steroid hormone ecdysone during Drosophila metamorphosis. beta FTZ-F1 mutants pupariate normally in response to the late larval pulse of ecdysone but display defects in stage-specific responses to the subsequent ecdysone pulse in prepupae. The ecdysone-triggered genetic hierarchy that directs these developmental responses is severely attenuated in beta FTZ-F1 mutants, although ecdysone receptor expression is unaffected. This study define beta FTZ-F1 as an essential competence factor for stage-specific responses to a steroid signal and implicates interplay among nuclear receptors as a mechanism for achieving hormonal competence.
SF-1/Ad4BP is a transcriptional factor that was originally found to be a mammalian homologue of the Drosophila Ftz-F1 (fushi tarazu factor 1) (), and transcribed from a gene designated the Ftz-F1 gene (). Ftz-F1 gene-deficient mice lack adrenal glands and gonads. Besides mammals, however, the SF-1/Ad4BP cDNA has only been isolated to date in fish and birds. To understand its role(s) for adrenal and gonadal development in vertebrates, cloning of this gene in animals other than mammals is required. In this study, we succeeded to isolate frog (Rana rugosa) SF-1/Ad4BP cDNA from a testis lambdagt10 cDNA library. It encoded a protein of 468 amino acids, and its open reading frame (ORF) shared 70% similarity with that of chicken OR2.1 (a SF-1/Ad4BP homologue) and 62% with bovine SF-1/Ad4BP. SF-1/Ad4BP mRNA was expressed in the testes, brains, adrenals/kidneys and spleens, but not ovaries, of adult frogs. In addition, we also cloned the 5'-untranslated region (4.6kb) of the SF-1/Ad4BP gene with exons I and II. Genomic structure analysis revealed that frog SF-1/Ad4BP was also transcribed from the same gene as that of mammals. However, many Ftz-F1-related proteins have been reported so far. The Ftz-F1 gene does not encode all of those Ftz-F1-related proteins. Thus, the name of Ftz-F1 is not adequate for the gene coding SF-1/Ad4BP. Here, we propose the use of SF-1/Ad4BP instead of Ftz-F1 for the gene that encodes SF-1/Ad4BP in vertebrates.
Steroidogenic factor 1, a member of the fushi tarazu factor 1 (FTZ-F1) subfamily of nuclear receptors, is a key regulator in mammalian reproduction. From an embryonic complementary DNA library, the zebrafish homolog of FTZ-F1 (zFF1A) and an alternatively spliced variant (zFF1B) were isolated. zFF1B represented a C-terminally truncated version of zFF1A. Whole mount in situ hybridization and reverse transcriptase-PCR analysis revealed that both zFF1A and B transcripts were present in the developing pituitaries, adult fish brain, gonads, and liver, albeit zFF1B messenger RNA was absent in testis. Comparison of the primary sequences of zFF1 with those of other FTZ-F1 subfamily members showed a close structural relationship between the mouse liver receptor homolog, which activated the alpha1-fetoprotein gene in rodent liver. However, similar to mouse steroidogenic factor 1, zFF1A regulated chinook salmon gonadotropin IIbeta subunit gene expression. On the contrary, zFF1B, which could bind a consensus gonadotrope-specific element with an affinity similar to that of zFF1A, lacked both the trans-activation function and synergistic interaction with the estrogen receptor. Furthermore, cotransfection studies in HeLa cells showed that zFF1B was a strong competitor for the action of zFF1A on the chinook salmon gonadotropin IIbeta subunit gene promoter. Our investigation suggests that 1) zFF1 represents an ancestor protein of the vertebrate FTZ-F1 homologs; 2) the antagonistic relationship between zFF1A and -B may dictate the expression of the FTZ-F1 target genes in a variety of tissues, including the pituitary; and 3) the naturally occurring zFF1B provides evidence that the C-terminal portion of zFF1A (80 amino acid residues) contains a major trans-activation function and a protein-protein interface.
The orphan nuclear receptor steroidogenic factor 1 (SF-1) plays key roles in endocrine development and function. Initially identified as a positive regulator of the cytochrome P450 steroid hydroxylases, analyses of knockout mice deficient in SF-1 revealed that SF-1 is essential for adrenal and gonadal development, pituitary gonadotropin expression and formation of the ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus. Although more limited in scope, analyses of SF-1 in humans similarly have suggested that SF-1 is important for differentiated function in adrenocortical and gonadotrope adenomas. In the hope of extending our understanding of SF-1 function by identifying possible roles of SF-1 in clinical endocrine disorders, we isolated the FTZ-F1 gene encoding human SF-1 and mapped it to chromosome 9q33. In this report, we characterize the sequence and structural organization of the human cDNA and gene encoding SF-1, providing new insights into comparative aspects of SF-1 structure that will facilitate efforts to study the role of this transcription factor in human endocrine disorders.
Pulses of the steroid hormone 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E) trigger the larval-to-adult metamorphosis of Drosophila by reprogramming gene expression throughout the organism. 20E directly induces a small set of early regulatory genes that repress their own expression and induce a large set of late secondary-response genes. We show here that two members of the Drosophila nuclear hormone receptor superfamily, DHR3 and DHR39, are rapidly induced by 20E, in parallel with the early regulatory genes. Both genes also require protein synthesis at high 20E concentrations for their maximal induction by the hormone. Developmental Northern blot analysis reveals that DHR39 is induced in mid third instar larvae and expressed throughout most of third instar larval and prepupal development, while DHR3 is briefly expressed in late third instar larvae and early prepupae. The 20E-induction and temporal patterns of DHR3 and DHR39 transcription strongly suggest that these genes function together with the early regulatory genes to coordinate the complex gene networks that direct the early stages of Drosophila metamorphosis. In an initial effort to understand how these two orphan receptors might function during development, we examined their DNA binding properties and compared them with the known Drosophila nuclear receptor superfamily members that are involved in the ecdysteroid response: EcR, Usp, E75A, E78A, and beta FTZ-F1. Upon testing all pairwise combinations of these seven proteins on a panel of seven oligonucleotides, only EcR and Usp bound DNA as a heterodimer, indicating that this interaction is highly specific. With the exception of E78A, which did not bind any sequence tested, each of the remaining proteins is able to bind to a single consensus AGGTCA half-site; however, each displayed different specificities depending on the flanking nucleotide sequence. These observations suggest that the 20E-regulated orphan receptors function as monomers to control the expression of their target genes.
SF-1, a nuclear receptor that regulates gene expression of the cytochrome P450 steroid hydroxylases, and ELP, an embryonal protein that suppresses expression of the Moloney murine leukemia virus LTR, are isoforms transcribed from the same gene by alternative promoter usage and splicing. This gene is the mammalian homolog of the Drosophila fushi-tarazu factor 1 (FTZ-F1) gene. We have mapped the mouse gene Ftzf1 to the proximal quarter of Chr 2 by a linkage analysis using interspecific backcross mice, and its human homolog FTZ1 to Chr 9q33 by fluorescence in situ hybridization. The mouse and human genes are located in the homologous regions of mouse Chr 2 and human Chr 9, respectively.
Developmental and tissue-specific transcription from the Adh distal promoter is regulated in part by the Adh adult enhancer, located 450 to 600 bp upstream from the distal RNA start site. We have characterized four proteins (DEP1 to DEP4), present in Drosophila tissue culture cell nuclear extracts, which bind to this enhancer. DEP1 and DEP2 bind to a positive cis-acting element (-492 to -481) and share nucleotide contacts. A small linker replacement deletion mutation, which disrupts the overlapping DEP1- and DEP2-binding sites, reduces Adh distal transcription in an alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH)-expressing cultured cell line, in the adult fat body (the major tissue of ADH expression), as well as in some but not all adult tissues where ADH is normally expressed. This enhancer element contains an imperfect palindromic sequence similar to steroid hormone receptor superfamily response elements. Binding-site screening of a lambda gt11 expression library has identified the steroid receptor superfamily member fushi tarazu factor 1 (FTZ-F1) as a protein that binds to this site. Anti-FTZ-F1 antibodies have identified DEP1 as FTZ-F1. DEP2 also binds to the FTZ-F1 site from the fushi tarazu zebra element, suggesting that DEP2 may also be a steroid receptor superfamily member. Our results raise the possibility that Adh regulation in certain adult tissues involves a hormone-mediated pathway. Because DEP1 (FTZ-F1) and DEP2 contact some of the same nucleotides within the positive cis element, it is unlikely that they can bind simultaneously. Such alternative binding may play a role in the tissue-specific and developmental transcription of Adh.
The orphan nuclear receptor, steroidogenic factor-1 (SF-1), plays an important role in the development of the adrenal gland and in sexual differentiation. SF-1 regulates the transcription of variety of genes, including several steroidogenic enzymes, Müllerian inhibiting substance, and gonadotropin genes. In this report, we sought to identify domains in SF-1 that are required for transactivation and to determine whether SF-1 interacts with a subset of known coactivators. Natural variants of the FTZ-F1 locus include embryonal long terminal repeat-binding protein (ELP)-1, ELP-2, and SF-1, which share the DNA-binding domain. Analyses of the transcriptional activity of these variants revealed that the activity of ELP-2 and SF-1 was much greater than ELP-1, which contains a distinct carboxy terminus. Further studies were performed using GAL4-SF-1 fusion proteins that were constructed by replacement of the zinc finger region and FTZ-F1 box of SF-1 with the DNA-binding domain of GAL4. Elimination of the putative AF-2 domain at the carboxy terminus of GAL4-SF-1 proteins resulted in a complete loss of transactivation. Several lines of evidence demonstrated that SF-1 interacts with steroid receptor coactivator-1 (SRC-1). Full-length SRC-1 enhanced GAL4-SF-1-mediated transactivation, whereas a dominant negative form of SRC-1, consisting of its interaction domain alone, inhibited the activity of GAL4-SF-1. In mammalian two-hybrid assays, fusion of the VP16 activation domain to the interaction domain of SRC-1 confirmed the interaction between SRC-1 and GAL4-SF-1 and demonstrated that the AF-2 domain is required for interaction with SRC-1. Furthermore, SRC-1, together with the cAMP responsive element binding protein (CBP) or a closely related factor, p300, synergistically enhanced transcriptional activity of GAL4-SF-1. We conclude that the carboxy-terminal AF-2 region of SF-1 functions as an activation domain and that SRC-1 and CBP/p300 are components of the coactivator complex with SF-1.
In Drosophila, peaks of the titer of the steroid hormone ecdysone act as molecular signals that trigger all the major developmental transitions occurring along the life cycle. The EcR/USP heterodimer, known to constitute the functional ecdysone receptor, binds with high affinity to specific target sequences, the ecdysone response elements (EcREs), whose repertoire still remains to be fully characterized at both the molecular and functional levels. In order to investigate the properties of EcREs composed of directly repeated half-sites (DRs), we have analysed the binding properties of the ng-EcRE, a DR element located within the coding region of ng-1 and ng-2, two highly homologous genes mapping at the ecdysone-regulated 3C intermolt puff. We report here that the ng-EcRE contacts the ecdysone receptor through its directly repeated half-sites spaced by 12 bp, and that this element may interact efficiently with at least three Drosophila orphan receptors, namely DHR38, DHR39 and beta FTZ-F1. Interestingly, DHR38 is bound alone or in combination with USP, providing the first evidence that the EcR-USP and DHR38-USP may directly compete for binding to a common response element. These results suggest that EcREs composed of widely spaced DRs may contribute to the establishment of extensive nuclear receptors cross-talking along the development, a mechanism that might play a relevant role in determining the temporal and spatial specificity of the ecdysone response. Finally, we show that the ng-EcRE can promote functional interactions in vitro as well as in vivo, acting as a transcriptional enhancer able to confer a specific developmental expression profile to a minimal promoter in transgenic flies.
Various ecdysteroid responsive genes play important roles in insect moulting and metamorphosis. Late FTZ-F1, a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily, is a unique transcription factor which is induced by a pulse exposure of 20-hydroxyecdysone. Elucidation of the regulation mechanism of this gene during prepupal period will help our understanding of metamorphosis at a molecular level.
Using transgenic fly lines carrying various transcription regulatory regions of the FTZ-F1 gene fused to the LacZ gene, we investigated cis-regulatory elements in the late FTZ-F1 transcription unit. The region which governs the stage-specific expression during prepupal period was narrowed down to 1.2kb, from -0.7 to +0.5kb relative to the transcription start site. Electrophoresis mobility shift assays using staged extracts and various probes within the stage-specific region allowed us to identify binding sites for DHR3, an early late gene product, around 170 and 450bp downstream of the transcription initiation site. Mutations disrupting these binding sites reduced the reporter gene expression without affecting the stage specificity.
Our deletion and mutation studies of the cis-regulatory element of the FTZ-F1 gene suggest that the DHR3 binding sites located in the 5' non-coding region are involved in the prepupal expression of the gene. These DHR3 binding sites confer high level expression while other elements are also involved in stage-specific expression.
The germ cell lineage is first recognized as a population of mitotically proliferating primordial germ cells that migrate toward the gonadal ridge. Shortly after arriving at the gonadal ridge, the germ cells begin to initiate a commitment to gamete production in the developing gonad. The mechanisms controlling this transition are poorly understood. We recently reported that a mouse germ cell nuclear antigen 1 (GCNA1) is initially detected in both male and female germ cells as they reach the gonad at 11.5 days postcoitum (dpc). GCNA1 is continually expressed in germ cells through all stages of gametogenesis until the diplotene/dictyate stage of meiosis I. Since GCNA1 expression commences soon after primordial germ cells arrive at the gonadal ridge, we wanted to determine whether the gonadal environment was essential for induction of GCNA1 expression. By examining GCNA1 expression in germ cells that migrate ectopically into the adrenal gland, we determined that both the gonadal and adrenal gland environments allow GCNA1 expression. We also examined GCNA1 expression Ftz-F1 null mice, which were born lacking gonads and adrenal glands. During embryonic development in the Ftz-F1 null mice, the gonad and most germ cells undergo apoptotic degeneration at about 12.5 dpc. While most of the germ cells undergo apoptosis without expressing GCNA1, a few surviving germs cells, especially outside the involuting gonad clearly express GCNA1. Thus, although the Ftz-F1 gene is essential for gonadal and adrenal development, induction of GCNA1 expression in germ cells does not require Ftz-F1 gene products. The finding that germ cell GCNA1 expression is not restricted to the gonadal environment and is not dependent on the Ftz-F1 gene products suggests that GCNA1 expression may be initiated in the germ cell lineage by autonomous means.
SmFtz-F1 (Schistosoma mansoni Fushi Tarazu-Factor 1) belongs to the Ftz-F1 subfamily of nuclear receptors, but displays marked structural differences compared with its mammalian homologues SF-1 (steroidogenic factor-1) or liver receptor homologue-1. These include a long F domain (104 amino acids), an unusually large hinge region (133 amino acids) and a poorly conserved E-domain. Here, using Gal4 constructs and a mammalian two-hybrid assay, we have characterized the roles of these specific regions both in the transcriptional activity of the receptor and in its interactions with cofactors. Our results have shown that, although the AF-2 (activation function-2) region is the major activation function of the receptor, both the F and D domains are essential for AF-2-dependent activity. Modelling of SmFtz-F1 LBD (ligand-binding domain) and structure-guided mutagenesis allowed us to show the important role of helix H1 in maintaining the structural conformation of the LBD, and suggested that its autonomous transactivation activity, also observed with SF-1, is fortuitous. This strategy also allowed us to study an eventual ligand-dependence for this orphan receptor, the predicted three-dimensional models suggesting that the SmFtz-F1 LBD contains a large and well-defined ligand-binding pocket sealed by two arginine residues orientated towards the interior of the cavity. Mutation of these two residues provoked a loss of transcriptional activity of the receptor, and strongly reduced its interaction with SRC1 (steroid receptor cofactor-1), suggesting a ligand-dependent activity for SmFtz-F1. Taken together, our results argue for original and specific functional activities for this platyhelminth nuclear receptor.
During C. elegans vulval development, the anchor cell (AC) in the somatic gonad expresses lin-3, activating the EGF receptor signaling pathway in vulval precursor cells (VPCs) and thereby inducing and patterning VPCs. Previous studies with lin-3 mutants and transgene expression have revealed that the level of LIN-3 in the AC must be precisely regulated for proper vulval development. To understand how lin-3 expression is achieved in the AC, we identified a 59 bp lin-3 enhancer sufficient to activate lin-3 transcription solely in the AC. The enhancer contains two E-box elements, and one FTZ-F1 nuclear hormone receptor (NHR) binding site that is mutated in a vulvaless mutant, lin-3(e1417). Mutagenesis studies show that both E-boxes and the NHR binding site are necessary to express lin-3 in the AC. In vitro DNA-binding studies and in vivo functional assays indicate that distinct trans-acting factors, including the E-protein/Daughterless homolog HLH-2 and unidentified nuclear hormone receptor(s), are necessary for lin-3 transcription in the AC and thus are involved in vulval development.
Fushi tarazu transcription factor-1 (FTZ-F1) was originally found as a regulator of fushi tarazu gene expression in Drosophila. The frog homologue (FTZ-F1alpha) and the 3.5 kb 5'-flanking region of the FTZ-F1alpha gene have been cloned, and it has been shown by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction that FTZ-F1alpha expression begins in embryos at stage 11 and becomes stronger after that. By in situ hybridization analysis, the FTZ-F1alpha mRNA was also found in immature frog oocytes. In this study, immunohistology revealed that the product of FTZ-F1alpha was localized in the cytoplasm of the immature oocyte. To analyze the promoter activity of the Rana rugosa FTZ-F1alpha gene, transgenic Xenopus were produced carrying the fusion construct, consisting of truncated 5'-flanking regions (3.0, 1.8 and 0.3 kb) of the FTZ-F1alpha gene and the green fluorescent protein (GFP) open reading frame. The 0.3 kb 5'-flanking region could drive GFP expression in Xenopus embryos at stage 20 and in immature oocytes in the ovary 2 months after metamorphosis. Gel mobility shift assay was used to test whether proteins in extracts from Xenopus embryos and ovaries bound to the 0.3 kb DNA. The extract from embryos at stage 11 formed one retarded band. The extract from ovaries formed a different retarded band. The results, taken together, indicate that production of transgenic Xenopus is very useful for the analysis of the promoter activity of genes in amphibians. The results also suggest that at least two proteins (one in the embryo and the other in the ovary of 2-month-old postmetamorphosing Xenopus) bind the 0.3 kb 5'-flanking region of the FTZ-F1alpha gene. These proteins may be involved in the regulation of FTZ-F1alpha gene expression in amphibians.
The fushi tarazu factor 1 (FTZ-F1) nuclear receptor subfamily comprises orphan receptors with crucial roles in development and sexual differentiation in vertebrates and invertebrates. We describe the structure and functional properties of an FTZ-F1 from the platyhelminth parasite of humans, Schistosoma mansoni, the first receptor from this family to be characterized in a Lophotrochozoan. It contains a well conserved DNA-binding domain (55-63% identity to other family members) and a poorly conserved ligand-binding domain (20% identity to that of zebrafish FF1a). However, both the ligand domain signature sequence and the activation function 2-activation domain (AF2-AD) are perfectly conserved. Phylogenetic analysis confirmed that SmFTZ-F1 is a member of nuclear receptor subfamily 5, but that it clustered with the Drosophila receptor DHR39 and has consequently been named NR5B1. The gene showed a complex structure with 10 exons and an overall size of 18.4 kb. Two major transcripts were detected, involving alternative promoter usage and splicing of the two 5' exons, but which encoded identical proteins. SmFTZ-F1 mRNA is expressed at all life-cycle stages with the highest amounts in the larval forms (miracidia, sporocysts and cercariae). However, expression of the protein showed a different pattern; low in miracidia and higher in adult male worms. The protein bound the same monomeric response element as mammalian SF-1 (SF-1 response element, SFRE) and competition experiments with mutant SFREs showed that its specificity was identical. Moreover, SmFTZ-F1 transactivated reporter gene transcription from SFRE similarly to SF-1. This functional conservation argues for a conserved biological role of the FTZ-F1 nuclear receptor family throughout the metazoa.
Insect metamorphosis is a developmentally important event for formation of adult structures from larval imaginal cells, and it is controlled by the ecdysteroid hormone. At the onset of metamorphosis, both the cuticle gene Edg78E and the transcription factor betaFTZ-F1 are expressed during the mid- to late prepupal period after a large ecdysteroid pulse. Edg78E mRNA is inducible by premature expression of betaFTZ-F1 and the Edg78E expression level is reduced in an ftz-f1 mutant. Using a transgenic fly reporter assay, a 1.2 kb promoter region of the Edg78E gene has been identified, which was sufficient for appropriate temporally and spatially specific expression of the reporter gene LacZ. Within the promoter region, two betaFTZ-F1 binding sites are present and disruption of these sites reduced the expression level of the reporter gene. LacZ expression levels were dramatically reduced in the head and thorax regions but not affected in the abdominal region, suggesting that betaFTZ-F1 is required for high-level Edg78E expression specifically in the head and thorax regions. The findings suggest that betaFTZ-F1 is a regulator for temporal gene expression at the onset of metamorphosis, and that complex mechanisms regulate the temporal and spatial regulation of gene expression during metamorphosis.
Isoform-specific null mutations were used to define the functions of three orphan members of the nuclear receptor superfamily, E75A, E75B, and E75C, encoded by the E75 early ecdysteroid-inducible gene. E75B mutants are viable and fertile, while E75C mutants die as adults. In contrast, E75A mutants have a reduced ecdysteroid titer during larval development, resulting in developmental delays, developmental arrests, and molting defects. Remarkably, some E75A mutant second instar larvae display a heterochronic phenotype in which they induce genes specific to the third instar and pupariate without undergoing a molt. We propose that ecdysteroid-induced E75A expression defines a feed-forward pathway that amplifies or maintains the ecdysteroid titer during larval development, ensuring proper temporal progression through the life cycle.
Orphan receptors for whom cognate ligands have not yet been identified form a large subclass within the nuclear receptor superfamily. To address one aspect of how they might regulate transcription, we analyzed the mode of interaction between the Drosophila orphan receptor FTZ-F1 (NR5A3) and a segmentation gene product Fushi tarazu (FTZ). Strong interaction between these two factors was detected by use of the mammalian one- and two-hybrid interaction assays without addition of ligand. This interaction required the AF-2 core and putative ligand-binding domain of FTZ-F1 and the LXXLL motif of FTZ. The requirement of these elements was further confirmed by examination of their target gene expression in Drosophila embryos and observation of a cuticle phenotype in transgenic fly lines that express mutated factors. In Drosophila cultured cells, FTZ is required for FTZ-F1 activation of a FTZ-F1 reporter gene. These results reveal a resemblance in the mode of interaction between FTZ-F1 and FTZ and that of nuclear receptor-coactivator and indicate that direct interaction is required for regulation of gene expression by FTZ-F1. Thus, we propose that FTZ may represent a category of LXXLL motif-dependent coactivators for nuclear receptors.
The Drosophila homeodomain protein Fushi Tarazu (Ftz) and its partner, the orphan receptor Ftz-F1, are members of two distinct families of DNA binding transcriptional regulators. Ftz and Ftz-F1 form a novel partnership in vivo as a Hox/orphan receptor heterodimer. Here we show that the murine Ftz-F1 ortholog SF-1 functionally substitutes for Ftz-F1 in vivo, rescuing the defects of ftz-f1 mutants. This finding identified evolutionarily conserved domains of Ftz-F1 as critical for activity of this receptor in vivo. These domains function, at least in part, by mediating direct protein interactions with Ftz. The Ftz-F1 DNA binding domain interacts strongly with Ftz and dramatically facilitates the binding of Ftz to target DNA. This interaction is augmented by a second interaction between the AF-2 domain of Ftz-F1 and the N-terminus of Ftz via an LRALL sequence in Ftz that is reminiscent of LXXLL motifs in nuclear receptor coactivators. We propose that Ftz-F1 serves as a cofactor for Ftz by facilitating the selection of target sites in the genome that contain Ftz/Ftz-F1 composite binding sites. Ftz, on the other hand, influences Ftz-F1 activity by interacting with its AF-2 domain in a manner that mimics a nuclear receptor coactivator.
The synthesis of silk protein is controlled by hormones. The expression of the nuclear hormone Bmftz-f1 in the posterior silk gland (PSG) is induced by 20-hydroxyecdysone in vivo and in vitro. However, whether Bmftz-f1 regulates silk protein expression is unknown.
In our study, western blotting and quantitative polymerase chain reactions were conducted to detect the expression of FTZ-F1 in the PSG. Electrophoretic mobility shift, chromatin immunoprecipitation, far-western blotting, bimolecular fluorescence complementation, and dual luciferase reporter assays were performed to investigate the effect of FTZ-F1 on the fibH promoter.
(1) The expression of the hormone receptor BmFTZ-F1 was opposite to that of fibH. It was highly expressed in the PSG during the fourth molting stage and the beginning of the fifth instar, and then its expression decreased gradually until it disappeared at the end of the fifth instar and the wandering stage. (2) We identified a FTZ-F1 response element 390bp upstream of the transcription initiation site of the fibH promoter. (3) BmFTZ-F1 interacted with the basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor Bmdimm. (4) BmFTZ-F1 down-regulated fibH promoter activity and counteracted the effect of Bmdimm on fibH expression.
Integrating these results, we conclude that BmFTZ-F1 regulates the transcription of fibH by binding to the FTZ-F1 response element in the fibH promoter and counteracts the effect of Bmdimm on fibH expression.
These findings provide new insights into the mechanism of regulation of the silk protein gene.
Ovarian development in crustaceans is characterized by rapid production of egg yolk protein in a process called vitellogenesis. In the present study, we investigated the involvement of a DEAD (Asp-Glu-Ala-Asp) box RNA helicase 20 (DDX20), forkhead transcription factor (FOXL)2 and fushi tarazu factor (FTZ-F)1 in the regulation of vitellogenesis. Based on ESTs from the testis and accessory gland of Eriocheir sinensis, we cloned the full-length cDNAs of foxl2 and fushitarazu factor 1 (ftz-f1), which include the conserved structural features of the forkhead family and nuclear receptor 5A (NR5A) family respectively. The expression of foxl2 mRNA surged at the mature stage of the ovary, when vtg mRNA swooped, suggesting that foxl2 negatively affects the vitellogenin (VTG) synthesis at this developmental stage. Etoposide (inducing germ cell apoptosis) treatment up-regulated FOXL2 and DDX20 at both the mRNA and the protein levels, primarily in the follicular cells as shown by immunofluorescence analysis. Furthermore, foxl2, ddx20 and ftz-f1 mRNA levels increased significantly with right-eyestalk ablation. Interactions between FOXL2 and DDX20 or FTZ-F1 were confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation and the forkhead domain of FOXL2 was identified as the specific structure interacting with FTZ-F1. In conclusion, FOXL2 down-regulates VTG expression by binding with DDX20 in regulation of follicular cell apoptosis and with FTZ-F1 to repress the synthesis of VTG at the mature stage. This report is the first to describe the molecular mechanism of VTG synthesis in E. sinensis and may shed new light on the regulation of cytochrome P450 enzyme by FOXL2 and FTZ-F1 in vitellogenesis. 
Sequential pulses of the steroid hormone ecdysone regulate the major developmental transitions in Drosophila, and the duration of each developmental stage is determined by the length of time between ecdysone pulses. Ecdysone regulates biological responses by directly initiating target gene transcription. In turn, these transcriptional responses are known to be self-limiting, with mechanisms in place to ensure regression of hormone-dependent transcription. However, the biological significance of these transcriptional repression mechanisms remains unclear. Here we show that the chromatin remodeling protein INO80 facilitates transcriptional repression of ecdysone-regulated genes during prepupal development. In ino80 mutant animals, inefficient repression of transcriptional responses to the late larval ecdysone pulse delays the onset of the subsequent prepupal ecdysone pulse, resulting in a significantly longer prepupal stage. Conversely, increased expression of ino80 is sufficient to shorten the prepupal stage by increasing the rate of transcriptional repression. Furthermore, we demonstrate that enhancing the rate of regression of the mid-prepupal competence factor βFTZ-F1 is sufficient to determine the timing of head eversion and thus the duration of prepupal development. Although ino80 is conserved from yeast to humans, this study represents the first characterization of a bona fide ino80 mutation in any metazoan, raising the possibility that the functions of ino80 in transcriptional repression and developmental timing are evolutionarily conserved. 
Although dibenzoylhydrazine-type non-steroidal ecdysone agonists such as methoxyfenozide (RH-2485) have an excellent performance record, the emergence of resistance could severely compromise the efficacy of these compounds in integrated pest management programs. To investigate possible mechanisms of resistance, cell lines derived from the polyphagous noctuid pest Spodoptera exigua (Se4 cells) were selected for continuous growth in the presence of high concentrations of 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E) or methoxyfenozide. Here we describe an analysis of ecdysteroid receptor signaling in the ecdysteroid-resistant Se4 cell lines. In contrast to other ecdysteroid-resistant cell lines described in literature, our data support the existence of a normal functioning ecdysteroid receptor complex in the resistant Se4 cell lines: (1) using a recombinant BmNPV baculovirus as a transduction tool, activation of an ecdysone-responsive luciferase cassette was demonstrated; (2) the early gene HR3 is constitutively expressed in the resistant cell lines that are grown in the presence of 20E or methoxyfenozide. Quantitative RT-PCR experiments indicated that expression levels of SeEcR mRNA were comparable among sensitive and resistant cell lines. Sequencing of PCR fragments also revealed the presence of SeEcR mRNA with a wild-type ligand-binding domain in resistant cells. Finally, a possible role for the gene FTZ-F1, whose expression correlates with the absence of circulating ecdysteroids during insect development, in the resistance mechanism was investigated. However, it was observed that FTZ-F1, in contrast to what is observed during insect development, is constitutively expressed in Se4 cells and that its expression is not regulated by the addition of ecdysteroid. It is proposed that the resistance mechanism in Se4 cells resides at the coupling between the conserved hierarchical cascade of early and early-late gene expression and the differentiation program in the Se4 cell line. The use of insect cell lines for the investigation of resistance against dibenzoylhydrazine ecdysone agonists and their relevance for uncovering resistance mechanisms in insects during pest control programs is discussed.
The vertebrate nuclear hormone receptor steroidogenic factor 1 (SF1; NR5A1) controls reproductive development and regulates the transcription of steroid-modifying cytochrome P450 genes. We find that the SF1-related Drosophila nuclear hormone receptor HR39 is also essential for sexual development. In Hr39 mutant females, the sperm-storing spermathecae and glandular parovaria are absent or defective, causing sterility. Our results indicate that spermathecae and parovaria secrete reproductive tract proteins required for sperm maturation and function, like the mammalian epididymis and female reproductive tract. Hr39 controls the expression of specific cytochrome P450 genes and is required in females both to activate spermathecal secretion and repress male-specific courtship genes such as takeout. Thus, a pathway that, in vertebrates, controls sex-specific steroid hormone production, also mediates reproductive functions in an invertebrate. Our findings suggest that Drosophila can be used to model more aspects of mammalian reproductive biology than previously believed.
lilliputian (lilli), the sole Drosophila member of the FMR2/AF4 (Fragile X Mental Retardation/Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia) family of transcription factors, is widely expressed with roles in segmentation, cellularization, and gastrulation during early embryogenesis with additional distinct roles at later stages of embryonic and postembryonic development. We identified lilli in a genetic screen based on the suppression of a lethal phenotype that is associated with ectopic expression of the transcription factor encoded by the segmentation gene runt in the blastoderm embryo. In contrast to other factors identified by this screen, lilli appears to have no role in mediating either the establishment or maintenance of engrailed (en) repression by Runt. Instead, we find that Lilli plays a critical role in the Runt-dependent activation of the pair-rule segmentation gene fushi-tarazu (ftz). The requirement for lilli is distinct from and temporally precedes the Runt-dependent activation of ftz that is mediated by the orphan nuclear receptor protein Ftz-F1. We further describe a role for lilli in the activation of Sex-lethal (Sxl), an early target of Runt in the sex determination pathway. However, lilli is not required for all targets that are activated by Runt and appears to have no role in activation of sloppy paired (slp1). Based on these results we suggest that Lilli plays an architectural role in facilitating transcriptional activation that depends both on the target gene and the developmental context.
A FTZ-F1-related orphan nuclear receptor SmFTZ-F1alpha was previously identified from Schistosoma mansoni. The deduced SmFTZ-F1alpha protein contains a highly conserved DNA binding domain (DBD, C domain), a less conserved ligand binding domain (LBD, E domain) and three highly variable regions, the N-terminal A/B domain (108 aa), a large hinge region (D domain, 1027 aa) and an F domain (220 aa). Herein, we characterize the DNA binding properties and the transactivation activity of SmFTZ-F1alpha. In in vitro assays, SmFTZ-F1alpha bound as a monomer to a response element (FF1RE: TCAAGGTCA) recognized by mammalian steroidogenic factor 1 (SF-1), and to related sequences (p14: TTAAGGTCA and SmFF1a-2: CGAAGGTCA) derived from known schistosome gene promoters. Competition assays with p14 oligonucleotides containing a single mutation at each nucleotide position defined the optimum DNA sequence required for SmFTZ-F1alpha binding. The optimal consensus sequence for SmFTZ-F1alpha binding is TN(A/G)AGGTC(A/G) (N: any base). This sequence is similar but not identical to the SF-1 response element (SFRE) consensus sequence [(T/C)CAAGG(T/C)C(A/G)]. By performing yeast one-hybrid assays, the ability of SmFTZ-F1alpha to bind productively to a p14-derived 9-base pair sequence was demonstrated in vivo. The ability of the full-length SmFTZ-F1alpha to transactivate reporter gene expression was shown to be A/B domain-dependent in a yeast system. In addition, the hinge region contained an unexpected activation function (AF) domain, termed AF-3, while no transactivation activity was detected within the E/F domain. This AF-3 region (from aa 982 to aa 1110) revealed a strong autonomous transactivation activity, which was masked when it was present in the full-length SmFTZ-F1alpha. Taken together, our results suggest that SmFTZ-F1alpha possesses the characteristic DNA binding specificity of FTZ-F1 subfamily members and the capacity to transactivate a reporter gene.
Fushi-tarazu factor-1 (FTZ-F1) is an orphan nuclear receptor involved in gene regulation of various developmental processes and physiological activities. We identified a new member of ftz-f1 gene in Schistosoma mansoni, termed Smftz-f1alpha. The Smftz-f1alpha gene has a complex structure with 15 exons interrupted by 14 introns. It encodes an unusually long SmFTZ-F1alpha protein of 1892 amino acids containing all the modular domains found in nuclear receptors. The DNA-binding domain (DBD) of SmFTZ-F1alpha is conserved and most similar to those of human and mouse FTZ-F1 orthologues, exhibiting a 76% identity. The ligand-binding domain (LBD) is less conserved than the DBD; it shares more diverse identity scores in different regions ranging from 23% to 42% in region II and 28% to 72% in region III. A conserved activation function-2 (AF-2) sequence is present in the SmFTZ-F1alpha LBD. This protein also contains a long hinge region (1027 aa) and an F region (220 aa) at the carboxyl end. Phylogenetic analysis suggests that SmFTZ-F1alpha is the orthologue of Drosophila FTZ-F1alpha and vertebrate NR5 members. Western blot analysis of a schistosome extract identified two proteins, one with a size (206 kDa) predicted by the SmFTZ-F1alpha cDNA sequence and a smaller component of 120 kDa. Smftz-f1alpha is expressed throughout the schistosome life cycle with the highest expression in the egg stage. SmFTZ-F1alpha mRNA is widely distributed in adult worms but does not appear in vitelline cells of female worms. SmFTZ-F1alpha localizes to a variety of tissues but is most abundant in the testis of the male and the ovary of female worms. Our results suggest that SmFTZ-F1alpha plays a role in regulating schistosome development and sexual differentiation similar to other FTZ-F1 family members.
Steroidogenic factor 1 (SF1) is a member of the NR5A subfamily of nuclear hormone receptors and is considered a master regulator of reproduction because it regulates a number of genes encoding reproductive hormones and enzymes involved in steroid hormone biosynthesis. Like other NR5A members, SF1 harbors a highly conserved approximately 30-residue segment called the FTZ-F1 box C-terminal to the core DNA binding domain (DBD) common to all nuclear receptors and binds to 9-bp DNA sequences as a monomer. Here we describe the solution structure of the SF1 DBD in complex with an atypical sequence in the proximal promoter region of the inhibin-alpha gene that encodes a subunit of a reproductive hormone. SF1 forms a specific complex with the DNA through a bipartite motif binding to the major and minor grooves through the core DBD and the N-terminal segment of the FTZ-F1 box, respectively, in a manner previously described for two other monomeric receptors, nerve growth factor-induced-B and estrogen-related receptor 2. However, unlike these receptors, SF1 harbors a helix in the C-terminal segment of the FTZ-F1 box that interacts with both the core DBD and DNA and serves as an important determinant of stability of the complex. We propose that the FTZ-F1 helix along with the core DBD serves as a platform for interactions with coactivators and other DNA-bound factors in the vicinity.
Fushi tarazu factor 1 (Ftz-F1, NR5A) is a zinc-finger transcription factor that belongs to the nuclear receptor superfamily and regulates genes that are involved in sterol and steroid metabolism in gonads, adrenals, liver and other tissues. To understand the evolutionary origins and developmental genetic relationships of the Ftz-F1 genes, we have cloned four homologous Ftz-f1 genes in zebrafish, called ff1a, ff1b, ff1c and ff1d. These four genes have different temporal and spatial expression patterns during development, indicating that they have distinct mechanisms of genetic regulation. Among them, the ff1a expression pattern is similar to mammalian Nr5a2, while the ff1b pattern is similar to that of mammalian Nr5a1. Genetic mapping experiments show that these four ff1 genes are located on chromosome segments conserved between the zebrafish and human genomes, indicating a common ancestral origin. Phylogenetic and conserved synteny analysis show that ff1a is the orthologue of NR5A2, and that ff1b and ff1d genes are co-orthologues of NR5A1 that arose by a gene-duplication event, probably a whole-genome duplication, in the ray-fin lineage, and each gene is located next to an NR6A1 co-orthologue as in humans, showing that the tandem duplication occurred before the divergence of human and zebrafish lineages. ff1c does not have a mammalian counterpart. Thus we have characterized the phylogenetic relationships, expression patterns and chromosomal locations of these Ftz-F1 genes, and have demonstrated their identities as NR5A genes in relation to the orthologous genes in other species.
Cholesterol conversion to bile acids is subject to a feedback regulatory mechanism by which bile acids down-regulate their own synthesis. This regulation occurs at the level of transcription of several genes encoding enzymes in the bile acid biosynthetic pathway. One of these enzymes is sterol 12alpha-hydroxylase/CYP8B1 (12alpha-hydroxylase), the specific enzyme required for cholic acid synthesis. The levels of this enzyme determine the ratio of cholic acid to chenodeoxycholic acid and thus the hydrophobicity of the circulating bile acid pool. Previous studies from this laboratory showed that fetoprotein transcription factor (FTF) is required for 12alpha-hydroxylase promoter activity and bile acid-mediated regulation. Here, we report that the short heterodimer partner (SHP) suppresses 12alpha-hydroxylase promoter activity via an interaction with FTF. Hepatic nuclear factor-4 (HNF-4) binds and activates the 12alpha-hydroxylase promoter and is required for 12alpha-hydroxylase promoter activity. Although HNF-4 interacts with SHP, it is not involved in SHP-mediated suppression of 12alpha-hydroxylase promoter activity. FTF and not HNF-4 is the factor involved in regulation of 12alpha-hydroxylase promoter activity by bile acids through its interaction with SHP. Finally, interaction of SHP with FTF displaces FTF binding to its sites within the 12alpha-hydroxylase promoter. These results provide insights into the mechanism of action of bile acid-mediated regulation of sterol 12alpha-hydroxylase transcription.
Small heterodimer partner (SHP) is an orphan nuclear receptor that lacks a conventional DNA binding domain. It interacts with several other members of the nuclear receptor superfamily and inhibits receptor transactivation. In order to characterize the regulation of SHP expression, a number of receptors and other transcription factors were tested for effects on the SHP promoter. Among these, the orphan receptor steroidogenic factor-1 (SF-1) was found to potently transactivate the SHP promoter. Detailed footprinting studies show that the SHP promoter contains at least five SF-1 binding sites, and mutagenesis studies demonstrate each of the three strongest binding sites is required for SF-1 transactivation. SHP is coexpressed with SF-1 in adrenal glands, but is also expressed in tissues that lack SF-1, including liver. However, liver expresses a close relative of SF-1, the orphan fetoprotein transcription factor (FTF), and FTF can also transactivate the SHP promoter. These results suggest that alterations in the levels or activities of SF-1 or FTF could modulate SHP expression in appropriate tissues and thereby affect a variety of receptor dependent signaling pathways.
Hydrophobic bile acids strongly repressed transcription of the human cholesterol 7alpha-hydroxylase gene (CYP7A1) in the bile acid biosynthetic pathway in the liver. Farnesoid X receptor (FXR) repressed CYP7A1/Luc reporter activity in a transfection assay in human liver-derived HepG2 cells, but not in human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells. FXR-binding activity was required for bile acid repression of CYP7A1 transcription despite the fact that FXR did not bind to the CYP7A1 promoter. FXR-induced liver-specific factors must be required for mediating bile acid repression. Bile acids and FXR repressed endogenous CYP7A1 but stimulated alpha-fetoprotein transcription factor (FTF) and small heterodimer partner (SHP) mRNA expression in HepG2 cells. Feeding of rats with chenodeoxycholic acid repressed CYP7A1, induced FTF, but had no effect on SHP mRNA expression in the liver. FTF strongly repressed CYP7A1 transcription in a dose-dependent manner, and SHP further inhibited CYP7A1 in HepG2 cells, but not in HEK 293 cells. FXR only moderately stimulated SHP transcription, whereas FTF strongly inhibited SHP transcription in HepG2 cells. Results revealed that FTF was a dominant negative factor that was induced by bile acid-activated FXR to inhibit both CYP7A1 and SHP transcription. Differential regulation of FTF and SHP expression by bile acids may explain the wide variation in CYP7A1 expression and the rate of bile acid synthesis and regulation in different species.
The relationship between BA (bile acid) secretion (measured by GC-MS) and the expression of genes (measured by reverse transcription real-time PCR) involved in liver BA transport and metabolism was investigated at 20 and 32 weeks during rat hepatocarcinogenesis. A progressive loss of mRNA for transporters (more marked for Ntcp, Bsep and Mrp2 than for Oatp1/Oatp1a1, Oatp2/Oatp1a4 and Oatp4/Oatp1b2) was found. The mRNA levels of Cyp7a1 and the nuclear receptors FXR (farnesoid X receptor), SHP (small heterodimer partner) and FTF (alpha-fetoprotein transcription factor) were not modified, whereas those of Cyp8b1 were enhanced and those of Cyp27 were reduced. Biliary secretion of CA (cholic acid) remained unchanged, whereas that of CDCA (chenodeoxycholic acid) and other non-C(12)-hydroxylated BAs was diminished. The re-appearance of 'flat-BAs' (mainly allo-BAs at 20 weeks and Delta(4)-unsaturated-BAs at 32 weeks) probably reflects the progressive decrease observed in the expression of 3-oxo-Delta(4)-steroid 5beta-reductase, together with the maintenance of steroid 5alpha-reductase type I. A significant correlation between the 5alpha-reductase/5beta-reductase ratio and bile output of 'flat-BAs' was found. In conclusion, during rat hepatocarcinogenesis, the expression of transporters/enzymes responsible for BA homoeostasis is changed due to mechanisms other than those controlled by FXR/SHP/FTF. These modifications result in the re-appearance of 'flat-BAs', together with an increased CA/CDCA ratio in bile.
The regulation of the rabbit apical sodium-dependent bile acid transporter (ASBT) was studied both in vivo and in vitro. New Zealand White rabbits were fed 0.5% deoxycholic acid (DCA) or SC-435, a competitive ASBT inhibitor, for 1 wk. In DCA-fed rabbits, ASBT expression was repressed, associated with activated FXR, and evidenced by increased ileal short heterodimer partner (SHP) mRNA. Feeding SC-435 to the rabbits blocked bile acid absorption, decreased SHP mRNA, and increased ASBT expression. A 1.9-kb rabbit ASBT 5'-flanking region (promoter) was cloned, and a cis-acting element for alpha-fetoprotein transcription factor (FTF) was identified (-1166/-1158). The effects of transcriptional factors and different bile acids on the rabbit ASBT promoter were studied in Caco-2 cells. FTF stimulated the rabbit ASBT promoter activity fourfold but not after the FTF binding site was deleted from the promoter. Increasing the SHP protein notably inhibited FTF-dependent trans-activation of rabbit ASBT. Adding hydrophobic bile acids deoxycholic acid, chenodeoxycholic acid, and cholic acid, activating ligands for FXR, inhibited rabbit ASBT promoter activity in Caco-2 cells, but this inhibitory effect was abolished after the FTF binding site was deleted. Ursodeoxycholic acid and ursocholic acid, nonactivating ligands for FXR, did not repress ASBT promoter activity. Thus the rabbit ASBT promoter is negative-feedback regulated by bile acids via a functional FTF binding site. Only FXR-activating ligands can downregulate rabbit ASBT expression through the regulatory cascade FXR-SHP-FTF.
Ontogenic changes in the rat bile acid (BA) pool, measured enzymatically and by GC-MS, and expression of enzymes (5alpha-reductase, 5beta-reductase, and cytochrome P450 enzymes Cyp7a1, Cyp8b1, Cyp27 and Cyp3a11), transporters [bile salt export pump, sodium taurocholate-cotransporting polypeptide, apical sodium-dependent bile acid transporter, and organic solute transporter alpha/beta (Ostalpha/Ostbeta)], and nuclear receptors [fetoprotein transcription factor (Ftf), farnesoid X receptor (Fxr), small heterodimer partner (Shp), and hepatic nuclear factor 4alpha (HNF-4alpha)], determined by quantitative PCR, were investigated. The absolute size of the BA pool increased progressively up to adulthood, whereas the complexity of its composition was high in fetuses, decreased after birth, increased again progressively up to adulthood, and decreased in aged animals. Allo-cholic acid only appeared early in development, in spite of low 5alpha-reductase expression. The relative size of the BA pool, corrected by liver weight, was maintained from 1 week after birth, except at weaning, when a transient peak accompanied by Shp downregulation and Cyp7a1 upregulation was observed. An imposed weaning delay of 1 week had no effect on the time course of the BA pool size but decreased the proportion of chenodeoxycholic and alpha-muricholic acids, whereas the proportion of cholic acid was increased, probably as a result of Cyp8b1 upregulation. In conclusion, changes in the expression of genes involved in BA homeostasis may play a role in physiological adaptations to digestive functions during the rat life span.
The nuclear receptor βFTZ-F1 is expressed in most cells in a temporally specific manner, and its expression is induced immediately after decline in ecdysteroid levels. This factor plays important roles during embryogenesis, larval ecdysis, and early metamorphic stages. However, little is known about the expression pattern, regulation and function of this receptor during the pupal stage. We analyzed the expression pattern and regulation of ftz-f1 during the pupal period, as well as the phenotypes of RNAi knockdown or mutant animals, to elucidate its function during this stage. Western blotting revealed that βFTZ-F1 is expressed at a high level during the late pupal stage, and this expression is dependent on decreasing ecdysteroid levels. By immunohistological analysis of the late pupal stage, FTZ-F1 was detected in the nuclei of most cells, but cytoplasmic localization was observed only in the oogonia and follicle cells of the ovary. Both the ftz-f1 genetic mutant and temporally specific ftz-f1 knockdown using RNAi during the pupal stage showed defects in eclosion and in the eye, the antennal segment, the wing and the leg, including bristle color and sclerosis. These results suggest that βFTZ-F1 is expressed in most cells at the late pupal stage, under the control of ecdysteroids and plays important roles during pupal development.
Hormone-induced changes in gene expression initiate periodic molts and metamorphosis during insect development. Successful execution of these developmental steps depends upon successive phases of rising and falling 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E) levels, leading to a cascade of nuclear receptor-driven transcriptional activity that enables stage- and tissue-specific responses to the steroid. Among the cellular processes associated with declining steroids is acquisition of secretory competence in endocrine Inka cells, the source of ecdysis triggering hormones (ETHs). We show here that Inka cell secretory competence is conferred by the orphan nuclear receptor βFTZ-F1. Selective RNA silencing of βftz-f1 in Inka cells prevents ETH release, causing developmental arrest at all stages. Affected larvae display buttoned-up, the ETH-null phenotype characterized by double mouthparts, absence of ecdysis behaviors, and failure to shed the old cuticle. During the mid-prepupal period, individuals fail to translocate the air bubble, execute head eversion and elongate incipient wings and legs. Those that escape to the adult stage are defective in wing expansion and cuticle sclerotization. Failure to release ETH in βftz-f1 silenced animals is indicated by persistent ETH immunoreactivity in Inka cells. Arrested larvae are rescued by precisely-timed ETH injection or Inka cell-targeted βFTZ-F1 expression. Moreover, premature βftz-f1 expression in these cells also results in developmental arrest. The Inka cell therefore functions as a "gateway cell", whose secretion of ETH serves as a key downstream physiological output enabling stage-specific responses to 20E that are required to advance through critical developmental steps. This secretory function depends on transient and precisely timed βFTZ-F1 expression late in the molt as steroids decline. 
One of the most dramatic examples of programmed cell death occurs during Drosophila metamorphosis, when most of the larval tissues are destroyed in a process termed histolysis. Much of our understanding of this process comes from analyses of salivary gland and midgut cell death. In contrast, relatively little is known about the degradation of the larval musculature. Here, we analyze the programmed destruction of the abdominal dorsal exterior oblique muscle (DEOM) which occurs during the first 24h of metamorphosis. We find that ecdysone signaling through Ecdysone receptor isoform B1 is required cell autonomously for the muscle death. Furthermore, we show that the orphan nuclear receptor FTZ-F1, opposed by another nuclear receptor, HR39, plays a critical role in the timing of DEOM histolysis. Finally, we show that unlike the histolysis of salivary gland and midgut, abdominal muscle death occurs by apoptosis, and does not require autophagy. Thus, there is no set rule as to the role of autophagy and apoptosis during Drosophila histolysis. 
Agricultural pesticide runoff has been suspected as the cause of numerous fish kills in rivers throughout Prince Edward Island but the impact on the surrounding marine environment is unknown. Endosulfan, an organochlorine pesticide, is a potent neurotoxin and molt inhibitor used to combat the Colorado potato beetle however it has the potential to affect non-target organisms including the American lobster (Homarus americanus). Metamorphosis is a critical stage of development and the effects of contaminant exposure during this time are largely unknown in lobster. A 14day endosulfan exposure was performed to identify the effects on survival, development and gene expression in lobster larvae during metamorphosis; all of which were predicted to be negatively impacted. The higher endosulfan concentrations resulted in greater mortality and a significant increase in the number of days required to reach metamorphosis in surviving animals. A custom made H. americanus microarray was used for monitoring the changes in expression of 14,592 genes at the termination of the exposure. Genes with &gt;1.5 fold change and identified as being significant at p&lt;0.05 using one-way ANOVA were selected for further analysis. A total of 707 genes were identified as being significantly differentiated, however with only ~40% annotation of the array, the majority of these genes were unknown. Annotated genes of interest were involved in many processes: development, metabolism, immunity and oxidative stress response and gene regulation. Nine genes of interest (histone H1, farnesoic acid O-methyltransferase, cuticle protein, glutathione S-transferase, thioredoxin, NADH dehydrogenase, ecdysone nuclear receptor Fushi tarazu F1 (FTZ-F1), ferritin and ecdysone inducible protein E75 (EIP-E75)) were selected for RT-qPCR validation of the microarray results. The RT-qPCR method was more sensitive than the microarray yet detected similar expression patterns. The two highest endosulfan concentrations resulted in increased mortalities, developmental delays in reaching metamorphosis and significant changes in gene expression. This research provides a foundation for using microarray gene expression profiles as screening tools for exploring the impact of environmental contaminants on lobster. 
Reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) has rapidly become the most sensitive and accurate method for the quantification of gene expression. To facilitate gene expression studies and obtain more accurate qRT-PCR data, normalization relative to stable housekeeping genes is required. These housekeeping genes need to show stable expression under the given experimental conditions for the qRT-PCR results to be accurate. Unfortunately, there are no studies on the stability of housekeeping genes used in Spodoptera litura. In this study, eight candidate reference genes, elongation factor 1 alpha (EF1), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), ribosomal protein L10 (RPL10), ribosomal protein S3 (RPS3), beta actin (ACTB), beta FTZ-F1 (FTZF1), ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase (UCCR), and arginine kinase (AK), were evaluated for their suitability as normalization genes under different experimental conditions using the statistical software programs, BestKeeper, geNorm and Normfinder, and the comparative ΔCt method. We determined the expression levels of the candidate reference genes for three biotic factors (developmental stage, tissue and population), and four abiotic treatments (temperature, insecticide, food and starvation). The results indicated that the best sets of candidates as reference genes were as follows: GAPDH and UCCR for developmental stages; RPL10, AK and EF1 for different tissues; RPL10 and EF1 for different populations in China; GAPDH and EF1 for temperature-stressed larvae; AK and ACTB for larvae treated with different insecticides; RPL10, GAPDH and UCCR for larvae fed different diets; RPS3 and ACTB for starved larvae. We believe that these results make an important contribution to gene analysis studies in S. litura and form the basis of further research on stable reference genes in S. litura and other organisms. 
Larval cuticle is degraded and replaced by the pupal counterpart during larval-pupal metamorphosis in the holometabolous insects. In addition to the extrinsic transformation, the epidermis goes through significant changes at molecular levels. To elucidate the intrinsic mechanism of epidermal metamorphosis, the dynamics of chitin content in the cuticle was examined in an important agricultural lepidopteran, the common cutworm, and the transcriptome was analyzed using Illumina sequencing technology. Gene expression profiles during the metamorphosis were further studied by both the digital gene expression (DGE) system and real-time quantitative PCR. The results showed that the chitin content decreased in prepupae and then increased in pupae. A total of 58 million sequencing reads were obtained and assembled into 70,346 unigenes. Over 9000 unigenes were identified to express differentially during the transformation process. As compared with the 6th instar feeding larvae, the most significant changes took place in the proteasome and metabolic pathways in prepupae and pupae, respectively. The cytochrome P450s, VHDLs, chitinase, serine protease and genes involved in sex pheromone biosynthesis changed their mRNA levels remarkably. Three chitinolytic enzymes (chitinase, β-N-acetylglucosaminidase and chitin deacetylase) showed distinct mRNA expression patterns, the former two enzymes revealed the highest expression in prepupae, however the latter one showed its climax mRNA level in pupae. The gene expression patterns suggest that chitinase and β-N-acetylglucosaminidase may be responsible for the degradation of larval cuticles, whereas chitin deacetylase may help to degrade the pupal counterparts. Gene expression dynamics also implied that the chitin of pupal cuticle might be formed by recycling of the degraded chitin of larval cuticle rather than through de novo synthesis. The 20E-induced nuclear receptors seem to be important factors regulating chitin metabolic enzymes during the cuticle remodeling. Our data provide a comprehensive resource for exploring the molecular mechanism of epidermal metamorphosis in insects. 
SUMOylation participates in ecdysteroid biosynthesis at the onset of metamorphosis in Drosophila melanogaster. Silencing the Drosophila SUMO homologue smt3 in the prothoracic gland leads to reduced lipid content, low ecdysone titers, and a block in the larval-pupal transition. Here we show that the SR-BI family of Scavenger Receptors mediates SUMO functions. Reduced levels of Snmp1 compromise lipid uptake in the prothoracic gland. In addition, overexpression of Snmp1 is able to recover lipid droplet levels in the smt3 knockdown prothoracic gland cells. Snmp1 expression depends on Ftz-f1 (an NR5A-type orphan nuclear receptor), the expression of which, in turn, depends on SUMO. Furthermore, we show by in vitro and in vivo experiments that Ftz-f1 is SUMOylated. RNAi-mediated knockdown of ftz-f1 phenocopies that of smt3 at the larval to pupal transition, thus Ftz-f1 is an interesting candidate to mediate some of the functions of SUMO at the onset of metamorphosis. Additionally, we demonstrate that the role of SUMOylation, Ftz-f1, and the Scavenger Receptors in lipid capture and mobilization is conserved in other steroidogenic tissues such as the follicle cells of the ovary. smt3 knockdown, as well as ftz-f1 or Scavenger knockdown, depleted the lipid content of the follicle cells, which could be rescued by Snmp1 overexpression. Therefore, our data provide new insights into the regulation of metamorphosis via lipid homeostasis, showing that Drosophila Smt3, Ftz-f1, and SR-BIs are part of a general mechanism for uptake of lipids such as cholesterol, required during development in steroidogenic tissues.
How oocytes are transferred into an oviduct with a receptive environment remains poorly known. We found that glands of the Drosophila female reproductive tract, spermathecae and/or parovaria, are required for ovulation and to promote sperm storage. Reducing total secretory cell number by interferring with Notch signaling during development blocked ovulation. Knocking down expression after adult eclosion of the nuclear hormone receptor Hr39, a master regulator of gland development, slowed ovulation and blocked sperm storage. However, ovulation (but not sperm storage) continued when only canonical protein secretion was compromised in adult glands. Our results imply that proteins secreted during adulthood by the canonical secretory pathway from female reproductive glands are needed to store sperm, while a non-canonical glandular secretion stimulates ovulation. Our results suggest that the reproductive tract signals to the ovary using glandular secretions, and that this pathway has been conserved during evolution.

Drosophila Ftz-F1 is an orphan nuclear receptor required for segmentation and metamorphosis. Its mammalian orthologs, SF-1 and LRH-1, function in sexual development and homeostasis, and have been implicated in stem cell pluripotency maintenance and tumorigenesis. These NR5A family members bind DNA as monomers and strongly activate transcription. However, controversy exists as to whether their activity is regulated by ligand-binding. Structural evidence suggested that SF-1 and human LRH-1 bind regulatory ligands, but mouse LRH-1 and Drosophila FTZ-F1 are active in the absence of ligand. We found that Dm-Ftz-F1 and mLRH-1, thought not to bind ligand, or mSF-1 and hLRH-1, predicted to bind ligand, each efficiently rescued the defects of Drosophila ftz-f1 mutants. Further, each correctly activated expression of a Dm-Ftz-F1 target gene in Drosophila embryos. The functional equivalence of ftz-f1 orthologs in these sensitive in vivo assays argues against specific activating ligands for NR5A family members.
Nuclear receptor transcription factor family members share target sequence similarity; however, little is known about how these factors exert their specific regulatory control. Here, we examine the mechanism regulating the expression of the Drosophila EDG84A gene, a target gene of the orphan nuclear receptor βFTZ-F1, as a model to study the cooperative behavior among nuclear receptors. We show that the three nuclear receptors βFTZ-F1, DHR3, and DHR39 bind to a common element in the EDG84A promoter. The expression level of the EDG84A promoter-lacZ reporter genes in DHR39-induced and mutant animals, respectively, suggests that DHR39 works as a repressor. The activity of a reporter gene carrying a mutation preventing DHR3 binding was reduced in ftz-f1 mutants and rescued by the induced expression of βFTZ-F1, suggesting that DHR3 and βFTZ-F1 activate the EDG84A gene in a redundant manner. A reporter gene carrying a mutation that abolishes DHR39 and FTZ-F1 binding was prematurely expressed, and the expression level of the reporter gene carrying a mutation preventing DHR3 binding was reduced. These findings suggest that the temporal expression of this gene is mainly controlled by βFTZ-F1 but that the binding of DHR3 is also important. Comparison of the binding site sequence among Drosophila species suggests that DHR3 binding ability was gained after the melanogaster subgroup evolved, and this ability may contribute to the robust expression of this gene. These results show the complicated regulatory mechanisms utilized by multiple nuclear receptors to properly regulate the expression of their target gene through a single target site.
The FTZ-F1 genes encode orphan receptors of the nuclear receptor superfamily and in mammals have been found to play important roles in the proper development of the adrenal-gonadal axis and sex-determination. We isolated the homologue of FTZ-F1 in genetically improved farmed tilapia (gfFTZ-F1). The full-length cDNA was isolated from the ovary, which included an open reading frame encoding a predicted protein of 486 amino acids. Sequence, tissue distribution and phylogenic analysis of the FTZ-F1 showed that the gfFTZ-F1 belonged to SF-1/Ad4BP group and that gfFTZ-F1 transcripts were only expressed in the gonads and kidney but not in other tissues. Likewise our data suggests that the gfFTZ-F1 gene may share similar functions with other fish and mammalian counterparts, though further study is needed to make any definitive conclusions.
Larval motor neurons remodel during Drosophila neuro-muscular junction dismantling at metamorphosis. In this study, we describe the motor neuron retraction as opposed to degeneration based on the early disappearance of β-Spectrin and the continuing presence of Tubulin. By blocking cell dynamics with a dominant-negative form of Dynamin, we show that phagocytes have a key role in this process. Importantly, we show the presence of peripheral glial cells close to the neuro-muscular junction that retracts before the motor neuron. We show also that in muscle, expression of EcR-B1 encoding the steroid hormone receptor required for postsynaptic dismantling, is under the control of the ftz-f1/Hr39 orphan nuclear receptor pathway but not the TGF-β signaling pathway. In the motor neuron, activation of EcR-B1 expression by the two parallel pathways (TGF-β signaling and nuclear receptor) triggers axon retraction. We propose that a signal from a TGF-β family ligand is produced by the dismantling muscle (postsynapse compartment) and received by the motor neuron (presynaptic compartment) resulting in motor neuron retraction. The requirement of the two pathways in the motor neuron provides a molecular explanation for the instructive role of the postsynapse degradation on motor neuron retraction. This mechanism insures the temporality of the two processes and prevents motor neuron pruning before postsynaptic degradation.
The oriental river prawn, Macrobrachium nipponense, is an economically and nutritionally important species of the Palaemonidae family of decapod crustaceans. To date, the sequencing of its whole genome is unavailable as a non-model organism. Transcriptomic information is also scarce for this species. In this study, we performed de novo transcriptome sequencing to produce the first comprehensive expressed sequence tag (EST) dataset for M. nipponense using high-throughput sequencing technologies.
Total RNA was isolated from eyestalk, gill, heart, ovary, testis, hepatopancreas, muscle, and embryos at the cleavage, gastrula, nauplius and zoea stages. Equal quantities of RNA from each tissue and stage were pooled to construct a cDNA library. Using 454 pyrosequencing technology, we generated a total of 984,204 high quality reads (338.59 Mb) with an average length of 344 bp. Clustering and assembly of these reads produced a non-redundant set of 81,411 unique sequences, comprising 42,551 contigs and 38,860 singletons. All of the unique sequences were involved in the molecular function (30,425), cellular component (44,112) and biological process (67,679) categories by GO analysis. Potential genes and their functions were predicted by KEGG pathway mapping and COG analysis. Based on our sequence analysis and published literature, many putative genes involved in sex determination, including DMRT1, FTZ-F1, FOXL2, FEM1 and other potentially important candidate genes, were identified for the first time in this prawn. Furthermore, 6,689 SSRs and 18,107 high-confidence SNPs were identified in this EST dataset.
The transcriptome provides an invaluable new data for a functional genomics resource and future biological research in M. nipponense. The molecular markers identified in this study will provide a material basis for future genetic linkage and quantitative trait loci analyses, and will be essential for accelerating aquaculture breeding programs with this species.
Drosophila SAYP, a homologue of human PHF10/BAF45a, is a metazoan coactivator associated with Brahma and essential for its recruitment on the promoter. The role of SAYP in DHR3 activator-driven transcription of the ftz-f1 gene, a member of the ecdysone cascade was studied. In the repressed state of ftz-f1 in the presence of DHR3, the Pol II complex is pre-recruited on the promoter; Pol II starts transcription but is paused 1.5 kb downstream of the promoter, with SAYP and Brahma forming a 'nucleosomal barrier' (a region of high nucleosome density) ahead of paused Pol II. SAYP depletion leads to the removal of Brahma, thereby eliminating the nucleosomal barrier. During active transcription, Pol II pausing at the same point correlates with Pol II CTD Ser2 phosphorylation. SAYP is essential for Ser2 phosphorylation and transcription elongation. Thus, SAYP as part of the Brahma complex participates in both 'repressive' and 'transient' Pol II pausing.
The remodelling of neurons during their development is considered necessary for their normal function. One fundamental mechanism involved in this remodelling process in both vertebrates and invertebrates is axon pruning. A well-documented case of such neuronal remodelling is the developmental axon pruning of mushroom body γ neurons that occurs during metamorphosis in Drosophila. The γ neurons undergo pruning of larval-specific dendrites and axons at metamorphosis, followed by their regrowth as adult-specific dendrites and axons. We recently revealed a molecular cascade required for this pruning. The nuclear receptor ftz-f1 activates the expression of the steroid hormone receptor EcR-B1, a key component for γ remodelling, and represses expression of Hr39, an ftz-f1 homologous gene. If ectopically expressed in the γ neurons, HR39 inhibits normal pruning, probably by competing with endogenous FTZ-F1, which results in decreased EcR-B1 expression. The mushroom bodies are a bilaterally symmetric structure in the larval and adult brain and are involved in the processing of different types of olfactory memory. How memory is affected in pruning-deficient adult flies that possess larval-stage neuronal circuitry will help to explain the functional role of neuron remodelling. Flies overexpressing Hr39 are viable as adults and make it possible to assess the requirement for wild-type mushroom body pruning in memory. While blocking mushroom body neuron remodelling impaired memory after short-term courtship conditioning, long-term memory was normal. These results show that larval pruning is necessary for adult memory and that expression of courtship short-term memory and long-term memory may be parallel and independent.
Secretions within the adult female reproductive tract mediate sperm survival, storage, activation, and selection. Drosophila female reproductive gland secretory cells reside within the adult spermathecae and parovaria, but their development remains poorly characterized.
With cell-lineage tracing, we found that precursor cells downregulate lozenge and divide stereotypically to generate three-cell secretory units during pupal development. The NR5A-class nuclear hormone receptor Hr39 is essential for precursor cell division and secretory unit formation. Moreover, ectopic Hr39 in multiple tissues generates reproductive gland-like primordia. Rarely, in male genital discs these primordia can develop into sperm-filled testicular spermathecae.
Drosophila spermathecae provide a powerful model for studying gland development. Hr39 functions as a master regulator of a program that may have been conserved throughout animal evolution for the production of female reproductive glands and other secretory tissues.
Nineteen canonical and two Knirps-like family nuclear receptors (NRs) were identified in the genome of Tribolium castaneum. The current study was conducted to identify NRs involved in regulation of male reproduction. RNA interference (RNAi)-aided knockdown in the expression of genes coding for all 21 NRs showed that reduction in the levels of 11 NRs (E75, E78, FTZ-F1, HR38, HR4, Knirps-like, HNF4, Tailless, HR51, Dsf and HR39) in the male beetles caused more than 50% reduction in the eggs laid by the female beetles mated with RNAi male beetles. Among these 11 NRs that are required for male reproduction, knockdown in the expression of genes coding for E78 and HR39 in the male beetles resulted in a reduction in the number of sperm produced and transferred to the female when compared to the sperms produced and transferred by the control male beetles injected with bacterial malE dsRNA. In contrast, knockdown in the expression of genes coding for E75 and HR38 caused a reduction in the size of male accessory glands (MAG), the amount of protein produced by the MAG and the expression of genes coding for accessory gland proteins. These data suggest that NRs such as E78 and HR39 regulate sperm production and their transfer to the females and the other NRs such as E75 and HR38 regulate the development of MAG and the production of accessory gland proteins.
During insect metamorphosis, neuronal networks undergo extensive remodeling by restructuring their connectivity and recruiting newborn neurons from postembryonic lineages. The neuronal network that directs the essential behavior, ecdysis, generates a distinct behavioral sequence at each developmental transition. Larval ecdysis replaces the cuticle between larval stages, and pupal ecdysis externalizes and expands the head and appendages to their adult position. However, the network changes that support these differences are unknown. Crustacean cardioactive peptide (CCAP) neurons and the peptide hormones they secrete are critical for ecdysis; their targeted ablation alters larval ecdysis progression and results in a failure of pupal ecdysis. In this study, we demonstrate that the CCAP neuron network is remodeled immediately before pupal ecdysis by the emergence of 12 late CCAP neurons. All 12 are CCAP efferents that exit the central nervous system. Importantly, these late CCAP neurons were found to be entirely sufficient for wild-type pupal ecdysis, even after targeted ablation of all other 42 CCAP neurons. Our evidence indicates that late CCAP neurons are derived from early, likely embryonic, lineages. However, they do not differentiate to express their peptide hormone battery, nor do they project an axon via lateral nerve trunks until pupariation, both of which are believed to be critical for the function of CCAP efferent neurons in ecdysis. Further analysis implicated ecdysone signaling via ecdysone receptors A/B1 and the nuclear receptor ftz-f1 as the differentiation trigger. These results demonstrate the utility of temporally tuned neuronal differentiation as a hard-wired developmental mechanism to remodel a neuronal network to generate a scheduled change in behavior.
Juvenile hormone (JH) has been implicated in many developmental processes in holometabolous insects, but its mechanism of signaling remains controversial. We previously found that in Drosophila Schneider 2 cells, the nuclear receptor FTZ-F1 is required for activation of the E75A gene by JH. Here, we utilized insect two-hybrid assays to show that FTZ-F1 interacts with two JH receptor candidates, the bHLH-PAS paralogs MET and GCE, in a JH-dependent manner. These interactions are severely reduced when helix 12 of the FTZ-F1 activation function 2 (AF2) is removed, implicating AF2 as an interacting site. Through homology modeling, we found that MET and GCE possess a C-terminal α-helix featuring a conserved motif LIXXL that represents a novel nuclear receptor (NR) box. Docking simulations supported by two-hybrid experiments revealed that FTZ-F1·MET and FTZ-F1·GCE heterodimer formation involves a typical NR box-AF2 interaction but does not require the canonical charge clamp residues of FTZ-F1 and relies primarily on hydrophobic contacts, including a unique interaction with helix 4. Moreover, we identified paralog-specific features, including a secondary interaction site found only in MET. Our findings suggest that a novel NR box enables MET and GCE to interact JH-dependently with the AF2 of FTZ-F1.
Fushi tarazu factor 1 (FTZ-F1) encodes an orphan nuclear receptor belonging to the nuclear receptor family 5A (NR5A) which includes adrenal 4-binding protein or steroidogenic factor-1 (Ad4BP/SF-1) and liver receptor homologue 1 (LRH-1) and plays a pivotal role in the regulation of aromatases.
Present study was aimed to understand the importance of FTZ-F1 in relation to brain aromatase (cyp19a1b) during development, recrudescence and after human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) induction. Initially, we cloned FTZ-F1 from the brain of air-breathing catfish, Clarias gariepinus through degenerate primer RT-PCR and RACE. Its sequence analysis revealed high homology with other NR5A1 group members Ad4BP/SF-1 and LRH-1, and also analogous to the spatial expression pattern of the latter. In order to draw functional correlation of cyp19a1b and FTZ-F1, we analyzed the expression pattern of the latter in brain during gonadal ontogeny, which revealed early expression during gonadal differentiation. The tissue distribution both at transcript and protein levels revealed its prominent expression in brain along with liver, kidney and testis. The expression pattern of brain FTZ-F1 during reproductive cycle and after hCG induction, in vivo was analogous to that of cyp19a1b shown in our earlier study indicating its involvement in recrudescence.
Based on our previous results on cyp19a1b and the present data, it is plausible to implicate potential roles for brain FTZ-F1 in ovarian differentiation and recrudescence process probably through regulation of cyp19a1b in teleosts. Nevertheless, these interactions would require primary coordinated response from ovarian aromatase and its related transcription factors.
Aromatase (CYP19A1) catalyzes the conversion of androgens to estrogens. In teleosts, duplicated copies of cyp19a1 genes, namely cyp19a1a and cyp19a1b, were identified, however, the transcriptional regulation of these two genes remains poorly understood. In the present study, the 5'-flanking regions of the orange-spotted grouper cyp19a1a (gcyp19a1a) and cyp19a1b (gcyp19a1b) genes were isolated and characterized. The proximal promoter regions of both genes were relatively conserved when compared to those of the other teleosts. Notably, a conserved FOXO transcriptional factor binding site was firstly reported in the proximal promoter of gcyp19a1a, and deletion of the region (-112 to -60) containing this site significantly decreased the promoter activities. The deletion of the region (-246 to -112) containing the two conserved FTZ-F1 sites also dramatically decreased the transcriptional activities of gcyp19a1a promoter, and both two FTZ-F1 sites were shown to be stimulatory cis-acting elements. A FTZ-F1 homologue isolated from ricefield eel (eFTZ-F1) up-regulated gcyp19a1a promoter activities possibly via the FTZ-F1 sites, however, a previously identified orange-spotted grouper FTZ-F1 homologue (gFTZ-F1) did not activate the transcription of gcyp19a1a promoter unexpectedly. As to gcyp19a1b promoter, all the deletion constructs did not show good promoter activities in either TM4 or U251-MG cells. Estradiol (100nM) up-regulated gcyp19a1b promoter activities by about 13- and 36-fold in TM4 and U251-MG cells, respectively, via the conserved ERE motif, but did not stimulate gcyp19a1a promoter activities. These results are helpful to further elucidate the regulatory mechanisms of cyp19a1a and cyp19a1b expression in the orange-spotted grouper as well as other teleosts.
Several lines of evidence support genetic links between ovary size and division of labor in worker honey bees. However, it is largely unknown how ovaries influence behavior. To address this question, we first performed transcriptional profiling on worker ovaries from two genotypes that differ in social behavior and ovary size. Then, we contrasted the differentially expressed ovarian genes with six sets of available brain transcriptomes. Finally, we probed behavior-related candidate gene networks in wild-type ovaries of different sizes. We found differential expression in 2151 ovarian transcripts in these artificially selected honey bee strains, corresponding to approximately 20.3% of the predicted gene set of honey bees. Differences in gene expression overlapped significantly with changes in the brain transcriptomes. Differentially expressed genes were associated with neural signal transmission (tyramine receptor, TYR) and ecdysteroid signaling; two independently tested nuclear hormone receptors (HR46 and ftz-f1) were also significantly correlated with ovary size in wild-type bees. We suggest that the correspondence between ovary and brain transcriptomes identified here indicates systemic regulatory networks among hormones (juvenile hormone and ecdysteroids), pheromones (queen mandibular pheromone), reproductive organs and nervous tissues in worker honey bees. Furthermore, robust correlations between ovary size and neuraland endocrine response genes are consistent with the hypothesized roles of the ovaries in honey bee behavioral regulation.
Cytochrome P450 aromatase (cyp19) catalyzes the conversion of androgens into estrogens. Teleosts have distinct, ovarian specific (cyp19a1a) and brain specific (cyp19a1b) cyp19 genes. Previous studies in teleosts demonstrated regulation of cyp19a1a expression by the NR5A nuclear receptor subfamily as well as a fork head transcription factor, FOXL2. In the present study, we investigated the involvement of fushi tarazu factor 1, FTZ-F1, a NR5A subfamily member, and FOXL2 in the regulation of cyp19a1b expression in brain of the air-breathing catfish, Clarias gariepinus. Based on the synchronous expression pattern of cyp19a1b, FTZ-F1 and FOXL2 in the brain, we isolated the 5' upstream region of cyp19a1b to analyse regulatory motifs. Promoter motif analysis revealed FTZ-F1/NR5A1 and FOXL2 binding nucleotide sequences. Transient transfection studies showed that FTZ-F1 and FOXL2 together enhanced the transcriptional activity of cyp19a1b gene in mammalian cell lines. Mutation in either of their putative binding sites within the cyp19a1b promoter abolished this effect. Electrophoretic gel mobility shift experiments indicated that FTZ-F1 and FOXL2 proteins bind to the synthesized radio-labelled oligomers used as probes and mobility shifted upon addition of their respective antibodies. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay confirmed the binding of both these transcription factors to their corresponding cis-acting elements in the upstream region of cyp19a1b. To our knowledge, this study is the first report on the transcriptional regulation of cyp19a1b by FTZ-F1 and FOXL2 in a teleost fish.
During metamorphosis, holometabolous insects eliminate obsolete larval tissues via programmed cell death. In contrast, tissues required for further development are retained and often remodeled to meet the needs of the adult fly. The larval fat body is involved in fueling metamorphosis, and thus it escapes cell death and is instead remodeled during prepupal development. The molecular mechanisms by which the fat body escapes programmed cell death have not yet been described, but it has been established that fat-body remodeling requires 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E) signaling. We have determined that 20E signaling is required within the fat body for the cell-shape changes and cell detachment that are characteristic of fat-body remodeling. We demonstrate that the nuclear hormone receptor ßFTZ-F1 is a key modulator of 20E hormonal induction of fat body remodeling and Matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP2) expression in the fat body. We show that induction of MMP2 expression in the fat body requires 20E signaling, and that MMP2 is necessary and sufficient to induce fat-body remodeling.
Juvenile hormone (JH) regulates a wide variety of biological activities in holometabolous insects, ranging from vitellogenesis and caste determination in adults to the timing of metamorphosis in larvae. The mechanism of JH signaling in such a diverse array of processes remains either unknown or contentious. We previously found that the nuclear receptor gene E75A is activated in S2 cells as a primary response to JH. Here, by expressing an intracellular form of JH esterase, we demonstrate that JH must enter the cell in order to activate E75A. To find intracellular receptors involved in the JH response, we performed an RNAi screen against nuclear receptor genes expressed in this cell line and identified the orphan receptor FTZ-F1. Removal of FTZ-F1 prevents JH activation of E75A, whereas overexpression enhances activation, implicating FTZ-F1 as a critical component of the JH response. FTZ-F1 is bound in vivo to multiple enhancers upstream of E75A, suggesting that it participates in direct JH-mediated gene activation. To better define the role of FTZ-F1 in JH signaling, we investigated interactions with candidate JH receptors and found that the bHLH-PAS proteins MET and GCE both interact with FTZ-F1 and can activate transcription through the FTZ-F1 response element. Removal of endogenous GCE, but not MET, prevents JH activation of E75A. We propose that FTZ-F1 functions as a competence factor by loading JH signaling components to the promoter, thus facilitating the direct regulation of E75A gene expression by JH.
The interaction between the orphan nuclear receptor FTZ-F1 (Fushi tarazu factor 1) and the segmentation gene protein FTZ is critical for specifying alternate parasegments in the Drosophila embryo. Here, we have determined the structure of the FTZ-F1 ligand-binding domain (LBD)·FTZ peptide complex using x-ray crystallography. Strikingly, the ligand-binding pocket of the FTZ-F1 LBD is completely occupied by helix 6 (H6) of the receptor, whereas the cofactor FTZ binds the co-activator cleft site of the FTZ-F1 LBD. Our findings suggest that H6 is essential for transcriptional activity of FTZ-F1; this is further supported by data from mutagenesis and activity assays. These data suggest that FTZ-F1 might belong to a novel class of ligand-independent nuclear receptors. Our findings are intriguing given that the highly homologous human steroidogenic factor-1 and liver receptor homolog-1 LBDs exhibit sizable ligand-binding pockets occupied by putative ligand molecules.
Nitric oxide (NO) is an important second messenger involved in numerous biological processes, but how it regulates gene expression is not well understood. In this issue of Genes &amp; Development, Cáceres and colleagues (pp. 1476-1485) report a critical requirement of NO as a direct regulator of gene expression through its binding to a heme-containing nuclear receptor in Drosophila. This may be an anciently evolved mechanism to coordinate behavior and metabolism during animal development.
Nitric oxide gas acts as a short-range signaling molecule in a vast array of important physiological processes, many of which include major changes in gene expression. How these genomic responses are induced, however, is poorly understood. Here, using genetic and chemical manipulations, we show that nitric oxide is produced in the Drosophila prothoracic gland, where it acts via the nuclear receptor ecdysone-induced protein 75 (E75), reversing its ability to interfere with its heterodimer partner, Drosophila hormone receptor 3 (DHR3). Manipulation of these interactions leads to gross alterations in feeding behavior, fat deposition, and developmental timing. These neuroendocrine interactions and consequences appear to be conserved in vertebrates.
Blimp-1 is an ecdysone-inducible transcription factor that is expressed in the early stage of the prepupal period. The timing of its disappearance determines expression timing of the FTZ-F1 gene, whose temporally restricted expression is essential for the prepupal development. To elucidate the termination mechanism of Blimp-1 gene expression, we examined the regulation of the Blimp-1 gene using an organ culture system. The results showed that the Blimp-1 gene is transcribed in cultured organs taken from a low ecdysteroid period even after extended exposure to 20-hydroxyecdysone, while well-known early genes such as E75A are repressed under the same conditions. Similar selective transcription was observed in the cultured organs obtained from a high ecdysteroid period. We further showed that Blimp-1 transcripts quickly disappeared in the presence of actinomycin D. From these results, we concluded that the Blimp-1 gene is transcribed when the ecdysteroid titer is high, but the expressed mRNA degrades rapidly; these unique regulations limit its expression to the high ecdysteroid stage.
Multiprotein-bridging factor 1 (MBF1) is a transcriptional co-activator that bridges a sequence-specific activator (basic-leucine zipper (bZIP) like proteins (e.g. Gcn4 in yeast) or steroid/nuclear-hormone receptor family (e.g. FTZ-F1 in insect)) and the TATA-box binding protein (TBP) in Eukaryotes. MBF1 is absent in Bacteria, but is well- conserved in Eukaryotes and Archaea and harbors a C-terminal Cro-like Helix Turn Helix (HTH) domain, which is the only highly conserved, classical HTH domain that is vertically inherited in all Eukaryotes and Archaea. The main structural difference between archaeal MBF1 (aMBF1) and eukaryotic MBF1 is the presence of a Zn ribbon motif in aMBF1. In addition MBF1 interacting activators are absent in the archaeal domain. To study the function and therefore the evolutionary conservation of MBF1 and its single domains complementation studies in yeast (mbf1Δ) as well as domain swap experiments between aMBF1 and yMbf1 were performed.
In contrast to previous reports for eukaryotic MBF1 (i.e. Arabidopsis thaliana, insect and human) the two archaeal MBF1 orthologs, TMBF1 from the hyperthermophile Thermoproteus tenax and MMBF1 from the mesophile Methanosarcina mazei were not functional for complementation of an Saccharomyces cerevisiae mutant lacking Mbf1 (mbf1Δ). Of twelve chimeric proteins representing different combinations of the N-terminal, core domain, and the C-terminal extension from yeast and aMBF1, only the chimeric MBF1 comprising the yeast N-terminal and core domain fused to the archaeal C-terminal part was able to restore full wild-type activity of MBF1.However, as reported previously for Bombyx mori, the C-terminal part of yeast Mbf1 was shown to be not essential for function. In addition phylogenetic analyses revealed a common distribution of MBF1 in all Archaea with available genome sequence, except of two of the three Thaumarchaeota; Cenarchaeum symbiosum A and Nitrosopumilus maritimus SCM1.
The absence of MBF1-interacting activators in the archaeal domain, the presence of a Zn ribbon motif in the divergent N-terminal domain of aMBF1 and the complementation experiments using archaeal- yeast chimeric proteins presented here suggests that archaeal MBF1 is not able to functionally interact with the transcription machinery and/or Gcn4 of S. cerevisiae. Based on modeling and structural prediction it is tempting to speculate that aMBF1 might act as a single regulator or non-essential transcription factor, which directly interacts with DNA via the positive charged linker or the basal transcription machinery via its Zn ribbon motif and the HTH domain. However, also alternative functions in ribosome biosynthesis and/or functionality have been discussed and therefore further experiments are required to unravel the function of MBF1 in Archaea.
Steroid hormones are systemic signaling molecules that regulate juvenile-adult transitions in both insects and mammals. In insects, pulses of the steroid hormone 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E) are generated by increased biosynthesis followed by inactivation/clearance. Although mechanisms that control 20E synthesis have received considerable recent attention, the physiological significance of 20E inactivation remains largely unknown. We show that the cytochrome P450 Cyp18a1 lowers 20E titer during the Drosophila prepupal to pupal transition. Furthermore, this reduction of 20E levels is a prerequisite to induce βFTZ-F1, a key factor in the genetic hierarchy that controls early metamorphosis. Resupplying βFTZ-F1 rescues Cyp18a1-deficient prepupae. Because Cyp18a1 is 20E-inducible, it appears that the increased production of steroid is responsible for its eventual decline, thereby generating the regulatory pulse required for proper temporal progression of metamorphosis. The coupling of hormone clearance to βFTZ-F1 expression suggests a general mechanism by which transient signaling drives unidirectional progression through a multistep process.
Developmental axon pruning is a general mechanism that is required for maturation of neural circuits. During Drosophila metamorphosis, the larval-specific dendrites and axons of early γ neurons of the mushroom bodies are pruned and replaced by adult-specific processes. We found that the nuclear receptor ftz-f1 is required for this pruning, activates expression of the steroid hormone receptor EcR-B1, whose activity is essential for γ remodeling, and represses expression of Hr39, an ftz-f1 homologous gene. If inappropriately expressed in the γ neurons, HR39 inhibits normal pruning, probably by competing with endogenous FTZ-F1, which results in decreased EcR-B1 expression. EcR-B1 was previously identified as a target of the TGFβ signaling pathway. We found that the ftz-f1 and Hr39 pathway apparently acts independently of TGFβ signaling, suggesting that EcR-B1 is the target of two parallel molecular pathways that act during γ neuron remodeling.
Liver receptor homologue-1 (LRH-1) is a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily. We characterized two functional nuclear localization signals (NLSs) in LRH-1. NLS1 (residues 117-168) overlaps the second zinc finger in the DNA binding domain. Mutagenesis showed that the zinc finger structure and two basic clusters on either side of the zinc finger loop are critical for nuclear import of NLS1. NLS2 (residues 169-204) is located in the Ftz-F1 box that contains a bipartite signal. In full-length LRH-1, mutation of either NLS1 or NLS2 had no effect on nuclear localization, but disruption of both NLS1 and NLS2 resulted in the cytoplasmic accumulation of LRH-1. Either NLS1 or NLS2 alone was sufficient to target LRH-1 to the nucleus. Both NLS1 and NLS2 mediate nuclear transport by a mechanism involving importin α/β. Finally, we showed that three crucial basic clusters in the NLSs are involved in the DNA binding and transcriptional activities of LRH-1.
Nineteen canonical and two Knirps-like family nuclear receptors (NRs) were identified in the genome of Tribolium castaneum. The current study was conducted to determine the function of these NRs in regulation of female reproduction and embryogenesis. RNA interference (RNAi)-aided knock-down in the expression of genes coding for 21 NRs showed that seven NRs E75, hormone receptor 3 (HR3), ecdysone receptor (EcR), ultraspiracle (USP), seven-up (SVP), FTZ transcription factor 1 (FTZ-F1) and hormone receptor 4 (HR4) are required for successful vitellogenesis and oogenesis. Knocking down the expression of genes coding for these seven NRs affected egg production by reducing the levels of vitellogenin mRNAs as well as by affecting the oocyte maturation. Expression of seven additional NRs hormone receptor 96 (HR96), hormone receptor 51 (HR51), hormone receptor 38 (HR38), hormone receptor 39 (HR39), Tailless (Tll), Dissatisfaction (Dsf) and Knirps-like is required for successful embryogenesis. The knock-down in the expression of genes coding for three other NRs (E78, hepatocyte nuclear factor 4, HNF4 and Eagle) partially blocked embryogenesis. This study showed that at least 17 out of the 21 NRs identified in T. castaneum play key roles in female reproduction and embryogenesis.
The insect hormone 20-hydroxy-ecdysone (20E) peaks at different stages during the life cycle. The hormone signal is commonly transmitted by a nuclear receptor consisting of the ecdysone receptor (EcR) and Ultraspiracle (Usp, orthologous to vertebrate RXR). EcR:Usp then initiate the expression of a series of gene regulators that help mediate biological responses to the hormone. Here, we investigated the embryonic ecdysone-signalling mechanism. The rise in 20E levels that occurs at mid-embryogenesis is required for major tissue movements to complete organ morphogenesis, but the functions of EcR and Usp during embryogenesis have remained unclear. We find that both EcR and Usp are essential for head involution, dorsal closure and tracheal and midgut morphogenesis, processes that also depend on 20E, arguing that embryonic 20E signals via EcR:Usp. We also show that EcR mediates the effects on organ morphogenesis in a tissue-autonomous manner and thus, that embryonic EcR functions are not fully reflected by the commonly used EcR activity assays. Finally, we show that embryonic 20E via EcR instructs the temporal and tissue-specific expression of four transcription factors that are needed for late embryogenesis and are common to the metamorphic 20E response. The results suggest that mid-embryonic EcR-activation imparts a level of gene regulation during embryonic organogenesis that has been largely overlooked, and possibly facilitates synchronized development of individual organs.
Studies of the onset of metamorphosis have identified an ecdysone-triggered transcriptional cascade that consists of the sequential expression of the transcription-factor-encoding genes DHR3, betaFTZ-F1, E74A and E75A. Although the regulatory interactions between these genes have been well characterized by genetic and molecular studies over the past 20 years, their developmental functions have remained more poorly understood. In addition, a transcriptional sequence similar to that observed in prepupae is repeated before each developmental transition in the life cycle, including mid-embryogenesis and the larval molts. Whether the regulatory interactions between DHR3, betaFTZ-F1, E74A and E75A at these earlier stages are similar to those defined at the onset of metamorphosis, however, is unknown. In this study, we turn to embryonic development to address these two issues. We show that mid-embryonic expression of DHR3 and betaFTZ-F1 is part of a 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E)-triggered transcriptional cascade similar to that seen in mid-prepupae, directing maximal expression of E74A and E75A during late embryogenesis. In addition, DHR3 and betaFTZ-F1 exert overlapping developmental functions at the end of embryogenesis. Both genes are required for tracheal air filling, whereas DHR3 is required for ventral nerve cord condensation and betaFTZ-F1 is required for proper maturation of the cuticular denticles. Rescue experiments support these observations, indicating that DHR3 has essential functions independent from those of betaFTZ-F1. DHR3 and betaFTZ-F1 also contribute to overlapping transcriptional responses during embryogenesis. Taken together, these studies define the lethal phenotypes of DHR3 and betaFTZ-F1 mutants, and provide evidence for functional bifurcation in the 20E-responsive transcriptional cascade.
AeSCP-2, a sterol carrier protein, is involved in sterol trafficking in mosquitoes. The activity of the AeSCP-2 gene is important for mosquito development. An earlier study demonstrated that the transcription of this gene was upregulated by 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E) in cultured gut tissues. To investigate 20E-regulated transcription of the AeSCP-2 gene we truncated the upstream flanking region of AeSCP-2 gene and linked it to a reporter gene. The mosquito Aag-2 cell line was transfected with these promoter/reporter constructs and treated with 20E at various concentrations. Expression vectors of different transcription factors such as HR3 and beta FTZ-F1 were also co-transfected with the AeSCP-2 promoter/reporter constructs. The observed results demonstrated that varied combinations of transcription factors produce different promoter activities of the AeSCP-2 gene. This observation leads us to the conclusion that the partnership of transcription factors is crucial in regulating the transcriptional activity of the AeSCP-2 gene.
During development, cascades of regulatory genes act in a hierarchical fashion to subdivide the embryo into increasingly specified body regions. This has been best characterized in Drosophila, where genes encoding regulatory transcription factors form a network to direct the development of the basic segmented body plan. The pair-rule genes are pivotal in this process as they are responsible for the first subdivision of the embryo into repeated metameric units. The Drosophila pair-rule gene fushi tarazu (ftz) is a derived Hox gene expressed in and required for the development of alternate parasegments. Previous studies suggested that Ftz achieves its distinct regulatory specificity as a segmentation protein by interacting with a ubiquitously expressed cofactor, the nuclear receptor Ftz-F1. However, the downstream target genes regulated by Ftz and other pair-rule genes to direct segment formation are not known. In this study, we selected candidate Ftz targets by virtue of their early expression in Ftz-like stripes. This identified two new Ftz target genes, drumstick (drm) and no ocelli (noc), and confirmed that Ftz regulates a serotonin receptor (5-HT2). These are the earliest Ftz targets identified to date and all are coordinately regulated by Ftz-F1. Engrailed (En), the best-characterized Ftz/Ftz-F1 downstream target, is not an intermediate in regulation. The drm genomic region harbors two separate seven-stripe enhancers, identified by virtue of predicted Ftz-F1 binding sites, and these sites are necessary for stripe expression in vivo. We propose that pair-rule genes, exemplified by Ftz/Ftz-F1, promote segmentation by acting at different hierarchical levels, regulating first, other segmentation genes; second, other regulatory genes that in turn control specific cellular processes such as tissue differentiation; and, third, 'segmentation realizator genes' that are directly involved in morphogenesis.
The present study was undertaken to clarify the regulation of cuticle-protein gene expression. Bombyx BAC library was screened to obtain the sequences of regulatory regions of cuticle protein genes isolated from wing discs of Bombyx mori. Two kb upstream of BMWCP2 was cloned into a reporter plasmid, and a reporter assay was operated. Plasmids were introduced into wing discs and wing tissues using a gene gun. DNA introduction into wing discs was confirmed with plasmid pA3GFP. The upstream region of BMWCP2 showed stage-specific activity: strongest at P0. EMSA analysis indicated the binding of BmbetaFTZ-F1. Ecdysone pulse-responsive sequences were examined in vitro. A luciferase assay was performed using reporter plasmids that contained different length upstream-regions of BMWCP2. With this method, we identified the ecdysone-responsive region. With deletion of the BMWCP2 upstream region, mutagenesis of the BmbetaFTZ-F1 binding site and EMSA analysis, it was confirmed that the BMWCP2 expression was regulated by BmbetaFTZ-F1 through the ecdysone pulse. This is first to apply the introduction of reporter plasmids into small organs to examine the developmental and hormonal regulation of the cuticle protein gene expression. We demonstrated that the binding of BmbetaFTZ-F1 facilitated the promoter activity of the BMWCP2 cuticle protein gene in vitro.
Heme has been recently described as a regulating ligand for the activity of the human nuclear receptors (NR) REV-ERBalpha and REV-ERBbeta and their Drosophila homologue E75. Here, we report the cloning, expression in Escherichia coli, purification, and screening for the heme-binding ability of 11 NR ligand-binding domains of Drosophila melanogaster (DHR3, DHR4, DHR39, DHR51, DHR78, DHR83, HNF4, TLL, ERR, FTZ-F1, and E78), of unknown structure. One of these NRs, DHR51, homologous to the human photoreceptor cell-specific nuclear receptor (PNR), specifically binds heme and exhibits a UV-visible spectrum identical to that of heme-bound E75-LBD. EPR and UV-visible absorption spectroscopy indicates that, like in E75, the heme contains a hexa-coordinated low spin ferric iron. One of its axial ligands is a tightly bound cysteine, while the other one is a histidine. A dissociation constant of 0.5 microM for the heme was measured by isothermal titration calorimetry. We show that DHR51 binds NO and CO and discuss the possibility that DHR51 may be either a gas or a heme sensor.
The juvenile hormone analogs (JHA) are known to disrupt insect development but the molecular mechanisms of their action have been studied only in a few model insects belonging to orders Diptera and Lepidoptera. Here, we investigated the mechanisms of JHA action in red flour beetle, Tribolium castaneum, belonging to the order Coleoptera. Application of JHA during penultimate and final instar larval stages blocked larval-pupal metamorphosis and induced supernumerary larval molts. When compared to the control insects undergoing larval-pupal molt, down-regulation of expression of transcription factor, Broad, and up-regulation of other genes involved in 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E) action (FTZ-F1, E74) were observed in JHA-treated larvae undergoing supernumerary larval molts. The presence of JHA during the final instar larval stage blocked the midgut remodeling wherein programmed cell death (PCD) of larval cells and proliferation and differentiation of imaginal cells to pupal gut epithelium were impaired. The comparative analysis of 20E-induced gene expression in the midguts of JHA-treated and control insects revealed that JHA suppressed the expression of EcRA, EcRB, Broad, E74, E75A, and E75B, resulting in a block in PCD as well as proliferation and differentiation of imaginal cells.
The brains of experienced forager honey bees exhibit predictable changes in structure, including significant growth of the neuropil of the mushroom bodies. In vertebrates, members of the superfamily of nuclear receptors function as key regulators of neuronal structure. The adult insect brain expresses many members of the nuclear receptor superfamily, suggesting that insect neurons are also likely important targets of developmental hormones. The actions of developmental hormones (the ecdysteroids and the juvenile hormones) in insects have been primarily explored in the contexts of metamorphosis and vitellogenesis. The cascade of gene expression activated by 20-hydroxyecdysone and modulated by juvenile hormone is strikingly conserved in these different physiological contexts. We used quantitative RT-PCR to measure, in the mushroom bodies of the adult worker honey bee brain, relative mRNA abundances of key members of the nuclear receptor superfamily (EcR, USP, E75, Ftz-f1, and Hr3) that participate in the metamorphosis/vitellogenesis cascade. We measured responses to endogenous peaks of hormones experienced early in adult life and to exogenous hormones. Our studies demonstrate that a population of adult insect neurons is responsive to endocrine signals through the use of conserved portions of the canonical ecdysteroid transcriptional cascade previously defined for metamorphosis and vitellogenesis.
The initiation of sexual maturation and spermatogenesis are complex processes that require the highly coordinated regulation of a number of key genes. The endocrine system plays crucial roles in these processes, but the precise mechanisms involved in sexual maturation of fish are poorly understood. We investigated the expression of genes encoding proteins involved in sex steroid biosynthesis (Ff1b (FTZ-F1 homolog), steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR), cytochrome P450 cholesterol side-chain cleavage enzyme (P450scc), 3beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase/Delta(5)-Delta(4)-isomerase (3beta-HSD), cytochrome P450 17alpha-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase (P450c17), cytochrome P450 11beta-hydroxylase (P45011beta) and 11beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (11beta-HSD)) and the anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) homolog during early sexual maturation of one-summer-old male Atlantic salmon parr by RT-PCR. Genes encoding Ff1b, StAR, 3beta-HSD, P450c17 and 11beta-HSD were upregulated during spermatogonial proliferation. During the course of spermatogenesis expression profiles of Ff1b, StAR, 3beta-HSD, P450scc, P450c17, P45011beta, and 11beta-HSD were similar; transcript levels being low during early stages, then strongly increasing during spermiogenesis. These results indicate that coordinated de novo transcription of genes encoding StAR as well as 3beta-HSD, P450c17 and 11beta-HSD might be required for sex steroids production during the initiation of spermatogenesis in salmon. In contrast, transcription levels of AMH were comparatively high in immature testes, decreased when spermatogenesis was initiated, and were lowest during spermiogenesis, suggesting that AMH suppression plays a crucial role in the process of spermatogenesis in salmonids. Correlation analyses show that FSH and LH might be differentially involved in the regulation of several of these genes studied.
Transcriptional coactivators play a crucial role in gene transcription and expression. Multiprotein bridging factor 1 (MBF1) is a transcriptional coactivator necessary for transcriptional activation caused by DNA-binding activators, such as FTZ-F1 and GCN4. Until now, very few studies have been reported in the silkworm. We selected the Bombyx mori because it is a model insect and acts as an economic animal for silk industry. In this study, we conducted the quantitative analysis of MBF1 mRNA in silkworm B. mori L. with actin (A3) as internal standard by means of SYBR Green I real-time RT-PCR method. The total RNA was extracted from the silk gland, epidermis, fat body, and midguts of the fifth instar B. mori larvae. The mRNA was reverse transcripted, and the cDNA fragments of MBF1 mRNA and actin gene were amplified by RT-PCR using specific primers. MBF1 mRNA expression in different tissues of silkworm B. mori L. was quantified using standardized SYBR Green I RT-PCR. The results suggested MBF1 gene was expressed in all investigated organs but highly expressed in the silk gland, showing its relation to biosynthesis of silk proteins.
2,2',4,4'-Tetrabromodiphenyl ether (BDE-47) is a persistent organic pollutant (POP) in marine environments. Despite its adverse effects (e.g. developmental retardation) in ecdysozoa, the effects of BDE-47 on transcription of ecdysteroid signaling pathway-involved-nuclear receptor (NR) genes and metamorphosis-related genes have not been examined in copepods. To examine the deleterious effect of BDE-47 on copepod molting and metamorphosis, BDE-47 was exposed to the harpacticoid copepod Tigriopus japonicus, followed by monitoring developmental retardation and transcriptional alteration of NR genes. The developmental rate was significantly inhibited (P&lt;0.05) in response to BDE-47 and the agricultural insecticide gamma-hexachlorocyclohexane. Conversely, the ecdysteroid agonist ponasterone A (PoA) led to decreased molting and metamorphosis time (P&lt;0.05) from the nauplius stage to the adult stage. In particular, expression profiles of all NR genes were the highest at naupliar stages 5-6 except for SVP, FTZ-F1, and HR96 genes. Nuclear receptor USP, HR96, and FTZ-F1 genes also showed significant sex differences (P&lt;0.05) in gene expression levels over different developmental stages, indicating that these genes may be involved in vitellogenesis. NR gene expression patterns showed significant decreases (P&lt;0.05) in response to BDE-47 exposure, implying that molting and metamorphosis retardation is likely associated with NR gene expression. In summary, BDE-47 leads to molting and metamorphosis retardation and suppresses transcription of NR genes. This information will be helpful in understanding the molting and metamorphosis delay mechanism in response to BDE-47 exposure. 
During the development of multicellular organisms, many events occur with precise timing. In Drosophila melanogaster, pupation occurs about 12 h after puparium formation and its timing is believed to be determined by the release of a steroid hormone, ecdysone (E), from the prothoracic gland. Here, we demonstrate that the ecdysone-20-monooxygenase Shade determines pupation timing by converting E to 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E) in the fat body, which is the organ that senses nutritional status. The timing of shade expression is determined by its transcriptional activator βFtz-f1. The βftz-f1 gene is activated after a decline in the expression of its transcriptional repressor Blimp-1, which is temporally expressed around puparium formation in response to a high titer of 20E. The expression level and stability of Blimp-1 is critical for the precise timing of pupation. Thus, we propose that Blimp-1 molecules function like sand in an hourglass in this precise developmental timer system. Furthermore, our data suggest that a biological advantage results from both the use of a transcriptional repressor for time determination and the association of developmental timing with nutritional status of the organism.
Multiple aspects of Drosophila oogenesis, including germline stem cell activity, germ cell differentiation, and follicle survival, are regulated by the steroid hormone ecdysone. While the transcriptional targets of ecdysone signaling during development have been studied extensively, targets in the ovary remain largely unknown. Early studies of salivary gland polytene chromosomes led to a model in which ecdysone stimulates a hierarchical transcriptional cascade, wherein a core group of ecdysone-sensitive transcription factors induce tissue-specific responses by activating secondary branches of transcriptional targets. More recently, genome-wide approaches have identified hundreds of putative ecdysone-responsive targets. Determining whether these putative targets represent bona fide targets in vivo, however, requires that they be tested via traditional mutant analysis in a cell-type specific fashion. To investigate the molecular mechanisms whereby ecdysone signaling regulates oogenesis, we used genetic mosaic analysis to screen putative ecdysone-responsive genes for novel roles in the control of the earliest steps of oogenesis. We identified a cohort of genes required for stem cell maintenance, stem and progenitor cell proliferation, and follicle encapsulation, growth, and survival. These genes encode transcription factors, chromatin modulators, and factors required for RNA transport, stability, and ribosome biogenesis, suggesting that ecdysone might control a wide range of molecular processes during oogenesis. Our results suggest that, although ecdysone target genes are known to have cell type-specific roles, many ecdysone response genes that control larval or pupal cell types at developmental transitions are used reiteratively in the adult ovary. These results provide novel insights into the molecular mechanisms by which ecdysone signaling controls oogenesis, laying new ground for future studies.
Identifying the genes required for environmental sex determination is important for understanding the evolution of diverse sex determination mechanisms in animals. Orthologs of Drosophila orphan receptor Fushi tarazu factor-1 (Ftz-F1) are known to function in genetic sex determination. In contrast, their roles in environmental sex determination remain unknown. In this study, we have cloned and characterized the Ftz-F1 ortholog in the branchiopod crustacean Daphnia magna, which produces males in response to environmental stimuli. Similar to that observed in Drosophila, D. magna Ftz-F1 (DapmaFtz-F1) produces two splicing variants, αFtz-F1 and βFtz-F1, which encode 699 and 777 amino acids, respectively. Both isoforms share a DNA-binding domain, a ligand-binding domain, and an AF-2 activation domain and differ only at the A/B domain. The phylogenetic position and genomic structure of DapmaFtz-F1 suggested that this gene has diverged from an ancestral gene common to branchiopod crustacean and insect Ftz-F1 genes. qRT-PCR showed that at the one cell and gastrulation stages, both DapmaFtz-F1 isoforms are two-fold more abundant in males than in females. In addition, in later stages, their sexual dimorphic expressions were maintained in spite of reduced expression. Time-lapse imaging of DapmaFtz-F1 RNAi embryos was performed in H2B-GFP expressing transgenic Daphnia, demonstrating that development of the RNAi embryos slowed down after the gastrulation stage and stopped at 30-48 h after ovulation. DapmaFtz-F1 shows high homology to insect Ftz-F1 orthologs based on its amino acid sequence and exon-intron organization. The sexually dimorphic expression of DapmaFtz-F1 suggests that it plays a role in environmental sex determination of D. magna.
Mapping of quantitative trait loci (QTL) is essential for the discovery of genetic structures that related to complex quantitative traits. In this study, we identified 264,072 raw SNPs (single-nucleotide polymorphisms) by double digest restriction site associated DNA sequencing (ddRADseq), and utilized 3029 of these SNPs to construct a genetic linkage map in orange-spotted grouper (Epinephelus coioides) using a regression mapping algorithm. The genetic map contained 24 linkage groups (LGs) spanning a total genetic distance of 1231.98 cM. Twenty-seven significant growth-related QTLs were identified. Furthermore, we identified 17 genes (fez2, alg3, ece2, arvcf, sla27a4, sgk223, camk2, prrc2b, mchr1, sardh, pappa, syk, tert, wdrcp91, ftz-f1, mate1 and notch1) including three (tert, ftz-f1 and notch1) that have been reported to be involved in fish growth. To summarize, we mapped growth-related QTLs in the orange-spotted grouper. These QTLs will be useful in marker-assisted selection (MAS) efforts to improve growth-related traits in this economically important fish. 
The impacts of environmental stressors on polyploid organisms are largely unknown. This study investigated changes in morphometric, molecular, and biochemical parameters in full-sibling diploid and triploid African catfish (Clarias gariepinus) in response to chlorpyrifos (CPF) exposures. Juvenile fish were exposed to three concentrations of CPF (mean measured μg/L (SD): 9.71 (2.27), 15.7 (3.69), 31.21 (5.04)) under a static-renewal condition for 21days. Diploid control groups had higher hepatosomatic index (HSI), plasma testosterone (T), and brain GnRH and cyp19a2 expression levels than triploids. In CPF-exposed groups, changes in HSI, total weight and length were different between the diploid and triploid fish. In contrast, condition factor did not alter in any of the treatments, while visceral-somatic index (VSI) changed only in diploids. In diploid fish, exposure to CPF did not change brain 11β-hsd2, ftz-f1, foxl2, GnRH or cyp19a2 mRNA levels, while reduced tph2 transcript levels compared to the control group. In contrast, 11β-hsd2 and foxl2 expression levels were changed in triploids following CPF exposures. In diploids, plasma T levels showed a linear dose-response reduction across CPF treatments correlating with liver weight and plasma total cholesterol concentrations. In contrast, no changes in plasma cholesterol and T concentrations were observed in triploids. Plasma cortisol and 17-β estradiol (E2) showed no response to CPF exposure in either ploidy. Results of this first comparison of biomarker responses to pesticide exposure in diploid and polyploid animals showed substantial differences between diploid and triploid C. gariepinus.
Information on the biological responses of polyploid animals towards environmental contaminants is scarce. This study aimed to compare reproductive axis-related gene expressions in the brain, plasma biochemical responses, and the liver and gill histopathological alterations in diploid and triploid full-sibling juvenile African catfish (Clarias gariepinus). Fish were exposed for 96 h to one of the two waterborne phenanthrene (Phe) concentrations [mean measured (SD): 6.2 (2.4) and 76 (4.2) μg/L]. In triploids, exposure to 76 μg/L Phe increased mRNA level of fushi tarazu-factor 1 (ftz-f1). Expression of tryptophan hydroxylase2 (tph2) was also elevated in both ploidies following the exposure to 76 μg/L Phe compared to the solvent control. In triploids, 76 μg/L Phe increased plasma alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels compared to the other Phe-exposed group. It also elevated lactate and glucose contents relative to the other groups. In diploids, however, biochemical biomarkers did not change. Phenanthrene exposures elevated glycogen contents and the prevalence of histopathological lesions in the liver and gills of both ploidies. This study showed substantial differences between diploids and triploids on biochemical and molecular biomarker responses, but similar histopathological alterations following acute Phe exposures. 
Dusky-like (Dyl) is associated with the morphogenesis of embryonic denticle, adult sensory bristle and wing hair in Drosophila melanogaster. And whether Dyl involved in insect post-embryonic development and its signal transduction are poorly understood. Here, phylogenetic analysis revealed that dyl displayed one-to-one orthologous relationship among insects. In Tribolium castaneum, dyl is abundantly expressed at the late embryonic stage. Tissue-specific expression analysis at the late adult stage illustrated high expression of dyl in the fat body and ovary. Knockdown of dyl resulted in the defects in larval epidermal pigmentation and completely blocked the transitions from larval to pupal and pupal to adult stages of T. castaneum. We further discovered that dyl RNAi phenotypes were phenocopied by blimp-1 or shavenbaby (svb) silencing, and dyl was positively regulated by blimp-1 through svb in T. castaneum. These results suggest that Dyl functions downstream of Blimp-1 through Svb for larval epidermal pigmentation and metamorphosis. Moreover, ftz-f1 was down-regulated after RNA interference (RNAi) suppressing any of those three genes, indicating that Ftz-f1 works downstream of Dyl to mediate the effects of Blimp-1, Svb and Dyl on metamorphosis in T. castaneum. This study provides valuable insights into functions and signaling pathway of insect Dyl. 
Ran (RanGTPase) in insects participates in the 20-hydroxyecdysone signal transduction pathway in which downstream genes, FTZ-F1, Krüppel-homolog 1 (Kr-h1) and vitellogenin, are involved. A putative Ran gene (NlRan) was cloned from Nilaparvata lugens, a destructive phloem-feeding pest of rice. NlRan has the typical Ran primary structure features that are conserved in insects. NlRan showed higher mRNA abundance immediately after molting and peaked in newly emerged female adults. Among the examined tissues ovary had the highest transcript level, followed by fat body, midgut and integument, and legs. Three days after dsNlRan injection the NlRan mRNA abundance in the third-, fourth-, and fifth-instar nymphs was decreased by 94.3%, 98.4% and 97.0%, respectively. NlFTZ-F1 expression levels in treated third- and fourth-instar nymphs were reduced by 89.3% and 23.8%, respectively. In contrast, NlKr-h1 mRNA levels were up-regulated by 67.5 and 1.5 folds, respectively. NlRan knockdown significantly decreased the body weights, delayed development, and killed &gt;85% of the nymphs at day seven. Two apparent phenotypic defects were observed: (1) Extended body form, and failed to molt; (2) The cuticle at the notum was split open but cannot completely shed off. The newly emerged female adults from dsNlRan injected fifth-instar nymphs showed lower levels of NlRan and vitellogenin, lower weight gain and honeydew excretion comparing with the blank control, and no offspring. Those results suggest that NlRan encodes a functional protein that was involved in development and reproduction. The study established proof of concept that NlRan could serve as a target for dsRNA-based pesticides for N. lugens control. 
Cancer initiation and maintenance of the transformed cell state depend on altered cellular signaling and aberrant activities of transcription factors (TFs) that drive pathological gene expression in response to cooperating genetic lesions. Deciphering the roles of interacting TFs is therefore central to understanding carcinogenesis and for designing cancer therapies. Here, we use an unbiased genomic approach to define a TF network that triggers an abnormal gene expression program promoting malignancy of clonal tumors, generated in Drosophila imaginal disc epithelium by gain of oncogenic Ras (Ras(V12)) and loss of the tumor suppressor Scribble (scrib(1)). We show that malignant transformation of the ras(V12)scrib(1) tumors requires TFs of distinct families, namely the bZIP protein Fos, the ETS-domain factor Ets21c and the nuclear receptor Ftz-F1, all acting downstream of Jun-N-terminal kinase (JNK). Depleting any of the three TFs improves viability of tumor-bearing larvae, and this positive effect can be enhanced further by their combined removal. Although both Fos and Ftz-F1 synergistically contribute to ras(V12)scrib(1) tumor invasiveness, only Fos is required for JNK-induced differentiation defects and Matrix metalloprotease (MMP1) upregulation. In contrast, the Fos-dimerizing partner Jun is dispensable for JNK to exert its effects in ras(V12)scrib(1) tumors. Interestingly, Ets21c and Ftz-F1 are transcriptionally induced in these tumors in a JNK- and Fos-dependent manner, thereby demonstrating a hierarchy within the tripartite TF network, with Fos acting as the most upstream JNK effector. Of the three TFs, only Ets21c can efficiently substitute for loss of polarity and cooperate with Ras(V12) in inducing malignant clones that, like ras(V12)scrib(1) tumors, invade other tissues and overexpress MMP1 and the Drosophila insulin-like peptide 8 (Dilp8). While ras(V12)ets21c tumors require JNK for invasiveness, the JNK activity is dispensable for their growth. In conclusion, our study delineates both unique and overlapping functions of distinct TFs that cooperatively promote aberrant expression of target genes, leading to malignant tumor phenotypes. 
"Brain sex differentiation" in teleosts is a contentious topic of research as most of the earlier reports tend to suggest that gonadal sex differentiation drives brain sex differentiation. However, identification of sex-specific marker genes in the developing brain of teleosts signifies brain-gonadal interaction during early sexual development in lower vertebrates. In this context, the influence of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH)-gonadotropin (GTH) axis on gonadal sex differentiation, if any requires in depth analysis. Presence of seabream (sb) GnRH immunoreactivity (ir-) in the brain of XY Nile tilapia was found as early as 5days post hatch (dph) followed by qualitative reduction in the preoptic area-hypothalamus region. In contrast, in the XX female brain a steady ir- of sbGnRH was evident from 15dph. Earlier studies using sea bass already implied the importance of hypothalamic gonadotropic axis completion during sex differentiation period. Such biphasic pattern of localization was also seen in pituitary GTHs using heterologous antisera in tilapia. However, more recent analysis in the same species could not detect any sexually dimorphic pattern using homologous antisera for pituitary GTHs. Detailed studies on the development of hypothalamo-hypophyseal-gonadal axis in teleosts focusing on hypothalamic monoamines (MA) and MA-related enzymes demonstrated sex-specific differential expression of tryptophan hydroxylase (Tph) in the early stages of developing male and female brains of tilapia and catfish. The changes in Tph expression was in agreement with the levels of serotonin (5-HT) and 5-hydroxytryptophan in the preoptic area-hypothalamus. Considering the stimulatory influence of 5-HT on GnRH and GTH release, it is possible to propose a network association between these correlates during early development, which may bring about brain sex dimorphism in males. A recent study from our laboratory during female brain sex development demonstrated high expression of tyrosine hydroxylase in correlation with catecholamine levels, brain aromatase and its related transcription factors such as fushi tarazu factor 1, Ftz-f1 and fork head box protein L2, foxl2. Taken together, gender differences in the levels of various transcripts provide new perspectives on brain sex differentiation in lower vertebrates. Sexually dimorphic or differentially expressing genes may play an essential role at the level of brain in response to gonadal differentiation, which might consequentially or causatively respond to gonadal sex. 
Our previous results revealed that RNA interference-aided knockdown of Leptinotarsa decemlineata FTZ-F1 (LdFTZ-F1) reduced 20E titer, and impaired pupation. In this study, we characterized a putative LdHR3 gene, an early-late 20E-response gene upstream of LdFTZ-F1. Within the first, second and third larval instars, three expression peaks of LdHR3 occurred just before the molt. In the fourth (final) larval instar 80 h after ecdysis and prepupal stage 3 days after burying into soil, two LdHR3 peaks occurred. The LdHR3 expression peaks coincide with the peaks of circulating 20E level. In vitro midgut culture and in vivo bioassay revealed that 20E and an ecdysteroid agonist halofenozide (Hal) enhanced LdHR3 expression in the final larval instars. Conversely, a decrease in 20E by feeding a double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) against an ecdysteroidogenesis gene Ldshd repressed the expression. Moreover, Hal rescued the transcript levels in the Ldshd-silenced larvae. Thus, 20E peaks activate the expression of LdHR3. Furthermore, ingesting dsRNA against LdHR3 successfully knocked down the target gene, and impaired pupation. Finally, knockdown of LdHR3 upregulated the transcription of three ecdysteroidogenesis genes (Ldphm, Lddib and Ldshd), increased 20E titer, and activated the expression of two 20E-response genes (LdEcR and LdFTZ-F1). Thus, LdHR3 functions in regulation of pupation in the Colorado potato beetle.
The molting during Drosophila development is tightly regulated by the ecdysone hormone. Several steps of the ecdysone biosynthesis have been already identified but the regulation of the entire process has not been clarified yet. We have previously reported that dATAC histone acetyltransferase complex is necessary for the steroid hormone biosynthesis process. To reveal possible mechanisms controlled by dATAC we made assumptions that either dATAC may influence directly the transcription of Halloween genes involved in steroid hormone biosynthesis or it may exert an indirect effect on it by acetylating the Ftz-F1 transcription factor which regulates the transcription of steroid converting genes. Here we show that the lack of dATAC complex results in increased mRNA level and decreased protein level of Ftz-F1. In this context, decreased mRNA and increased protein levels of Ftz-F1 were detected upon treatment of Drosophila S2 cells with histone deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin A. We showed that Ftz-F1, the transcriptional activator of Halloween genes, is acetylated in S2 cells. In addition, we found that ecdysone biosynthetic Halloween genes are transcribed in S2 cells and their expression can be influenced by deacetylase inhibitors. Furthermore, we could detect H4K5 acetylation at the regulatory regions of disembodied and shade Halloween genes, while H3K9 acetylation is absent on these genes. Based on our findings we conclude that the dATAC HAT complex might play a dual regulatory role in Drosophila steroid hormone biosynthesis through the acetylation of Ftz-F1 protein and the regulation of the H4K5 acetylation at the promoters of Halloween genes. 
Disruption of the appropriate balance between juvenile hormone (JH) and ecdysteroids causes abnormal insect development. The application of a JH analog (JHA) during the early days of the final (fifth) instar induces dauer larvae with low ecdysteroid titers in insects, but the mechanism that underlies the action of JHA remains unclear. In this study, we clarified the negative effects of JHA on ecdysteroidogenic enzymes. JHA application to Bombyx mori larvae during the early stage of the fifth instar suppressed the expression of four enzymes, i.e., neverland (nvd), spook, phantom, and disembodied but not non-molting glossy and shadow. Furthermore, JHA application reduced the amount of 7-dehydrocholesterol, a metabolite produced by Nvd, in both the prothoracic glands and hemolymph, indicating JHA can disrupt ecdysteroidogenic pathway from the first step. Neck ligation resulted in increased nvd expression, whereas JHA application reversed this increase. These results suggest that the endogenous JH represses ecdysteroidogenesis during the early days in final instar larvae. Neck ligation and JHA application had no substantial effects on the expression of a transcription factor, ftz-f1, or a prothoracicotropic hormone receptor, torso; therefore, the inhibitory regulation of JHA may not involve these factors. Further analysis is required to clarify the regulation of JHA in ecdysteroidogenesis, but this study showed that JHA, and probably endogenous JH, can suppress the transcription of four of six ecdysteroidogenic enzymes. This regulation may be essential for maintaining the appropriate balance between JH and ecdysone during insect development. 
Calanus finmarchicus, a highly abundant copepod that is an important primary consumer in North Atlantic ecosystems, has a flexible life history in which copepods in the last juvenile developmental stage (fifth copepodid, C5) may either delay maturation and enter diapause or molt directly into adults. The factors that regulate this developmental plasticity are poorly understood, and few tools have been developed to assess the physiological condition of individual copepods.
We sampled a cultured population of C. finmarchicus copepods daily throughout the C5 stage and assessed molt stage progression, gonad development and lipid storage. We used high-throughput sequencing to identify genes that were differentially expressed during progression through the molt stage and then used qPCR to profile daily expression of individual genes. Based on expression profiles of twelve genes, samples were statistically clustered into three groups: (1) an early period occurring prior to separation of the cuticle from the epidermis (apolysis) when expression of genes associated with lipid synthesis and transport (FABP and ELOV) and two nuclear receptors (ERR and HR78) was highest, (2) a middle period of rapid change in both gene expression and physiological condition, including local minima and maxima in several nuclear receptors (FTZ-F1, HR38b, and EcR), and (3) a late period when gonads were differentiated and expression of genes associated with molting (Torso-like, HR38a) peaked. The ratio of Torso-like to HR38b strongly differentiated the early and late groups.
This study provides the first dynamic profiles of gene expression anchored with morphological markers of lipid accumulation, development and gonad maturation throughout a copepod molt cycle. Transcriptomic profiling revealed significant changes over the molt cycle in genes with presumed roles in lipid synthesis, molt regulation and gonad development, suggestive of a coupling of these processes in Calanus finmarchicus. Finally, we identified gene expression profiles that strongly differentiate between early and late development within the C5 copepodid stage. We anticipate that these findings and continued development of robust gene expression biomarkers that distinguish between diapause preparation and continuous development will ultimately enable novel studies of the intrinsic and extrinsic factors that govern diapause initiation in Calanus finmarchicus.
Major developmental transitions in multicellular organisms are driven by steroid hormones. In insects, these, together with juvenile hormone (JH), control development, metamorphosis, reproduction and aging, and are also suggested to play an important role in caste differentiation of social insects. Here, we aimed to determine how EcR transcription and ecdysteroid titers are related during honeybee postembryonic development and what may actually be the role of EcR in caste development of this social insect. In addition, we expected that knocking-down EcR gene expression would give us information on the participation of the respective protein in regulating downstream targets of EcR. We found that in Apis mellifera females, EcR-A is the predominantly expressed variant in postembryonic development, while EcR-B transcript levels are higher in embryos, indicating an early developmental switch in EcR function. During larval and pupal stages, EcR-B expression levels are very low, while EcR-A transcripts are more variable and abundant in workers compared to queens. Strikingly, these transcript levels are opposite to the ecdysteroid titer profile. 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E) application experiments revealed that low 20E levels induce EcR expression during development, whereas high ecdysteroid titers seem to be repressive. By means of RNAi-mediated knockdown (KD) of both EcR transcript variants we detected the differential expression of 234 poly-A(+) transcripts encoding genes such as CYPs, MRJPs and certain hormone response genes (Kr-h1 and ftz-f1). EcR-KD also promoted the differential expression of 70 miRNAs, including highly conserved ones (e.g., miR-133 and miR-375), as well honeybee-specific ones (e.g., miR-3745 and miR-3761). Our results put in evidence a broad spectrum of EcR-controlled gene expression during postembryonic development of honeybees, revealing new facets of EcR biology in this social insect. 
During the final instar larvae of holometabolous insects, a pulse of 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E) and a drop in juvenile hormone (JH) trigger larval-pupal metamorphosis. In this study, two LdFTZ-F1 cDNAs (LdFTZ-F1-1 and LdFTZ-F1-2) were cloned in Leptinotarsa decemlineata. Both LdFTZ-F1-1 and LdFTZ-F1-2 were highly expressed just before or right after each molt, similar to the expression pattern of an ecdysteroidogenesis gene LdSHD. Ingestion of an ecdysteroid agonist halofenozide (Hal) enhanced LdFTZ-F1-1 and LdFTZ-F1-2 expression in the final larval instar. Conversely, a decrease in 20E by feeding a double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) against LdSHD repressed the expression. Moreover, Hal rescued the expression levels in LdSHD-silenced larvae. Thus, 20E peaks seem to induce the transcription of LdFTZ-F1s. Furthermore, ingesting dsLdFTZ-F1 from a common fragment of LdFTZ-F1-1 and LdFTZ-F1-2 successfully knocked down both LdFTZ-F1s, and impaired pupation. Finally, knocking down LdFTZ-F1s significantly repressed the transcription of three ecdysteroidogenesis genes, lowered 20E titer, and reduced the expression of two 20E receptor genes. Silencing LdFTZ-F1s also induced the expression of a JH biosynthesis gene, increased JH titer, but decreased the mRNA level of a JH early-inducible gene. Thus, LdFTZ-F1s are involved in the regulation of pupation by modulating 20E and JH titers and mediating their signaling pathways.
In most animals, steroid hormones are crucial regulators of physiology and developmental life transitions. Steroid synthesis depends on extrinsic parameters and autoregulatory processes to fine-tune the dynamics of hormone production. In Drosophila, transient increases of the steroid prohormone ecdysone, produced at each larval stage, are necessary to trigger moulting and metamorphosis. Binding of the active ecdysone (20-hydroxyecdysone) to its receptor (EcR) is followed by the sequential expression of the nuclear receptors E75, DHR3 and βFtz-f1, representing a model for steroid hormone signalling. Here, we have combined genetic and imaging approaches to investigate the precise role of this signalling cascade within theprothoracic gland (PG), where ecdysone synthesis takes place. We show that these receptors operate through an apparent unconventional hierarchy in the PG to control ecdysone biosynthesis. At metamorphosis onset, DHR3 emerges as the downstream component that represses steroidogenic enzymes and requires an early effect of EcR for this repression. To avoid premature repression of steroidogenesis, E75 counteracts DHR3 activity, whereas EcR and βFtz-f1 act early in development through a forward process to moderate DHR3 levels. Our findings suggest that within the steroidogenic tissue, a given 20-hydroxyecdysone peak induces autoregulatory processes to sharpen ecdysone production and to confer competence for ecdysteroid biosynthesis at the next developmental phase, providing novel insights into steroid hormone kinetics. 
Stem cell regulation by local signals is intensely studied, but less is known about the effects of hormonal signals on stem cells. In Drosophila, the primary steroid twenty-hydroxyecdysone (20E) regulates ovarian germline stem cells (GSCs) but was considered dispensable for testis GSC maintenance. Male GSCs reside in a microenvironment (niche) generated by somatic hub cells and adjacent cyst stem cells (CySCs). Here, we show that depletion of 20E from adult males by overexpressing a dominant negative form of the Ecdysone receptor (EcR) or its heterodimeric partner ultraspiracle (usp) causes GSC and CySC loss that is rescued by 20E feeding, uncovering a requirement for 20E in stem cell maintenance. EcR and USP are expressed, activated and autonomously required in the CySC lineage to promote CySC maintenance, as are downstream genes ftz-f1 and E75. In contrast, GSCs non-autonomously require ecdysone signaling. Global inactivation of EcR increases cell death in the testis that is rescued by expression of EcR-B2 in the CySC lineage, indicating that ecdysone signaling supports stem cell viability primarily through a specific receptor isoform. Finally, EcR genetically interacts with the NURF chromatin-remodeling complex, which we previously showed maintains CySCs. Thus, although 20E levels are lower in males than females, ecdysone signaling acts through distinct cell types and effectors to ensure both ovarian and testis stem cell maintenance.
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of endogenous, non-coding, regulatory RNA molecules that post-transcriptionally regulate gene expression by binding to the 3'UTRs of mRNA targets and thus cause their degradation or translational inhibition. In insects, important roles of miRNAs in various biological processes have been demonstrated in Drosophila melanogaster. However, biological roles of miRNAs are barely unveiled in the majority of insect species due to limited genetic tools. In the present study, we introduce the transgenic miRNA sponge (miR-SP) technology combining with the binary GAL4/UAS system in the domesticated silkworm, Bombyx mori, to exploit the biological function of an evolutionally conserved miRNA, let-7. We successfully established transgenic silkworm lines in which a miRNA sponge construct targeting BmLet-7 seed region was expressed in a ubiquitous manner directed by A3-GAL4 driver. Transgenic animals showed decreased expression of BmLet-7, leading to developmental arrestment during the larval-larval and larval-pupal transition. Simultaneously, expression levels of the predicted BmLet-7 target genes, FTZ-F1 and Eip74EF (E74), key regulatory factors in the ecdysone pathway, were elevated in transgenic animals. The current study is the first report on application of the transgenic miR-SP technology in non-drosophilid insects, which will not only contribute to better understanding of let-7 biological roles, but also greatly facilitate future miRNA functional analysis in insects. 
Methuselah-like 1 of Tribolium castaneum (TcMthl1) has been reported to play crucial roles in development, lifespan, stress resistance and reproduction. However, the signaling system of TcMthl1 is unknown. Thus, we compare the transcriptome profile of RNAi treated larvae (ds-Tcmthl1) and control larvae of T. castaneum by RNA-sequencing, and obtained 14,613,514 sequence reads aligned with 13,533 genes; 812 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified. These DEGs were classified into 47 GO functional groups, including such functions as the immune system process, the response to stimulus, the developmental process and reproduction. Interestingly, knock-down of Tcmthl1 suppressed both of Toll and IMD immunity pathways which most likely modulated the effects of Tcmthl1 on lifespan and stress resistance. Additionally, the DEGs encoding Blimp-1, Ftz-F1, E74 and Timeless may participate in the development and reproduction of ds-Tcmthl1 insects. The findings of these DEGs and pathways will provide valuable insight into TcMthl1 signaling and regulation system. 
Testicular steroids are critical hormones for the regulation of spermatogenesis in male teleosts and their productions have been reported to be regulated by gonadotropins and gonadotropin-releasing hormone. In the Japanese sea bass (Lateolabrax japonicas), the reproductive endocrine, particularly regarding the production and regulation of testicular steroids, are not well understood. For this reason, we first cloned and characterized the response of several key genes regulating the production of testicular steroids and, second, we analyzed the changes of mRNA profiles of these genes during testicular development cycle and in the administration of hCG and GnRHa with corresponding testosterone level in serum, GSI and histological analyses. We succeeded in cloning the full-length cDNAs for the fushi tarazu factor-1 (FTZ-F1) homologues (FTZ-F1a and FTZ-F1b), steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR) and anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) in Japanese sea bass. Multiple sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis of these proteins clearly showed that these genes in Japanese sea bass were homologous to those of other piscine species. During the testicular development cycle and hCG/GnRHa administration, quantification of jsbStAR transcripts revealed a trend similar to their serum testosterone levels, while a reciprocal relationship was founded between the serum concentrations of testosterone and jsbAMH and the links between gonadal expression of jsbStAR, jsbAMH and jsbFTZ-F1 were also observed. Our results have identified for the first time several key genes involved in the regulation of steroid production and spermatogenesis in the Japanese sea bass testis and these genes are all detected under gonadotropic hormone and gonadotropin-releasing hormone control. 
The regulation of transcription initiation is critical for developmental and cellular processes. RNA polymerase II (Pol II) is recruited by the basal transcription machinery to the core promoter where Pol II initiates transcription. The core promoter encompasses the region from -40 to +40 bp relative to the +1 transcription start site (TSS). Core promoters may contain one or more core promoter motifs that confer specific properties to the core promoter, such as the TATA box, initiator (Inr) and motifs that are located downstream of the TSS, namely, motif 10 element (MTE), the downstream core promoter element (DPE) and the Bridge, a bipartite core promoter element. We had previously shown that Caudal, an enhancer-binding homeodomain transcription factor and a key regulator of the Hox gene network, is a DPE-specific activator. Interestingly, pair-rule proteins have been implicated in enhancer-promoter communication at the engrailed locus. Fushi tarazu (Ftz) is an enhancer-binding homeodomain transcription factor encoded by the ftz pair-rule gene. Ftz works in concert with its co-factor, Ftz-F1, to activate transcription. Here, we examined whether Ftz and Ftz-F1 activate transcription with a preference for a specific core promoter motif. Our analysis revealed that similarly to Caudal, Ftz and Ftz-F1 activate the promoter containing a TATA box mutation to significantly higher levels than the promoter containing a DPE mutation, thus demonstrating a preference for the DPE motif. We further discovered that Ftz target genes are enriched for a combination of functional downstream core promoter elements that are conserved among Drosophila species. Thus, the unique combination (Inr, Bridge and DPE) of functional downstream core promoter elements within Ftz target genes highlights the complexity of transcriptional regulation via the core promoter in the transcription of different developmental gene regulatory networks.
Background: Molting is a crucial physiological behavior during arthropod growth. In the past few years, molting as well as chitin biosynthesis triggered by molting, is subject to regulation by miRNAs. However, how many miRNAs are involved in insect molting at the genome-wide level remains unknown. Results: We deeply sequenced four samples obtained from nymphs at the 2nd-3rd and 4th-5th instars, and then identified 61 miRNAs conserved in the Arthropoda and 326 putative novel miRNAs in the brown planthopper Nilaparvata lugens, a fearful pest of rice. A total of 36 mature miRNAs with significant different expression levels at the genome scale during molting, including 19 conserved and 17 putative novel miRNAs were identified. After comparing the expression profiles, we found that most of the targets of 36 miRNAs showing significantly differential expression were involved in energy and hormone pathways. One of the 17 putative novel miRNAs, nlu-miR-173 was chosen for functional study. nlu-miR-173 acts in 20-hydroxyecdysone signaling through its direct target, N. lugens Ftz-F1(NlFtz-F1), a transcription factor. Furthermore, we found that the transcription of nlu-miR-173 was promoted by Broad-Complex (BR-C), suggesting that its involvement in the 20-hydroxyecdysone pathway contributes to proper molting function. Conclusion: We provided a comprehensive resource of miRNAs associated with insect molting and identified a novel miRNA as a potential target for pest control.
Insect metamorphosis is triggered by a decrease in juvenile hormone (JH) in the final juvenile instar. What induces this decrease is therefore a relevant question. Working with the cockroach Blattella germanica, we found that myoglianin (Myo), a ligand in the TGF-β signaling pathway, is highly expressed in the corpora allata (CA, the JH-producing glands) and the prothoracic gland [(PG), which produce ecdysone] during the penultimate (fifth) nymphal instar (N5). In the CA, high Myo levels during N5 repress the expression of juvenile hormone acid methyl transferase, a JH biosynthesis gene. In the PG, decreasing JH levels trigger gland degeneration, regulated by the factors Krüppel homolog 1, FTZ-F1, E93, and inhibitor of apoptosis-1. Also in the PG, a peak of myo expression in N5 indirectly stimulates the expression of ecdysone biosynthesis genes, such as neverland, enhancing the production of the metamorphic ecdysone pulse in N6. The Myo expression peak in N5 also represses cell proliferation, which can enhance ecdysone production. The data indicate that Myo triggers the premetamorphic nymphal instar in B. germanica and possibly in other hemimetabolan insects.-Kamsoi, O., Belles, X. Myoglianin triggers the premetamorphosis stage in hemimetabolan insects.
Cytochrome P450-mediated detoxification plays an important role in the development of insecticide resistance. Previous studies have demonstrated that overexpression of CYP6BG1 was responsible for permethrin resistance in Plutella xylostella, and our experiments also showed that upregulation of this gene is associated with chlorantraniliprole resistance in P. xylostella. However, the transcriptional regulation involved in the expression of CYP6BG1 remains unknown. To further investigate the regulation of CYP6BG1 expression, the promoters of this gene were cloned and analyzed from one susceptible and four different resistant populations of P. xylostella.
First, the promoter region of P. xylostella CYP6BG1 was compared in five populations, and three types of 5'-flanking region were found. Second, the region between -562 and +49 of CYP6BG1 in a field population (TH) of P. xylostella showed the highest promoter activity and could be induced by chlorantraniliprole. Third, the transcriptional factor FTZ-F1, which is an orphan nuclear receptor and binds to the fushi tarazu (ftz) gene, was predicted by the online software Alggen and Jaspar. It was proved to regulate the expression of CYP6BG1 by RNAi. The expression levels of FTZ-F1 and CYP6BG1 could be induced by chlorantraniliprole and were significantly higher in the resistant populations.
These data give a better understanding of the transcriptional regulation of an important insecticide detoxification enzyme gene, and therefore will help in understanding the molecular mechanisms of insecticide resistance in P. xylostella. © 2018 Society of Chemical Industry.
Ftz-f1 is an orphan member of the nuclear hormone receptor superfamily. A 20-hydroxyecdysone pulse allows ftz-f1 gene expression, which then regulates the activity of downstream genes involved in major developmental progression events. In honeybees, the expression of genes like vitellogenin (vg), prophenoloxidase and juvenile hormone-esterase during late pharate-adult development is known to be hormonally controlled in both queens and workers by increasing juvenile hormone (JH) titres in the presence of declining levels of ecdysteroids. Since Ftz-f1 is known for mediating intracellular JH signalling, we hypothesized that ftz-f1 could mediate JH action during the pharate-adult development of honeybees, thus controlling the expression of these genes. Here, we show that ftz-f1 has caste-specific transcription profiles during this developmental period, with a peak coinciding with the increase in JH titre, and that its expression is upregulated by JH and downregulated by ecdysteroids. RNAi-mediated knock down of ftz-f1 showed that the expression of genes essential for adult development (e.g. vg and cuticular genes) depends on ftz-f1 expression. Finally, a double-repressor hypothesis-inspired vg gene knock-down experiment suggests the existence of a positive molecular loop between JH, ftz-f1 and vg.
The Zinc finger domains (ZnFs), which contain finger-like protrusions stabilized by zinc ions and function to bind DNA, RNA, protein and lipid substrates, are ubiquitously present in a large number of proteins. In this study, a novel protein containing a single C4 type Znf domain (SZnf) was identified from Pacific white shrimp, Litopenaeus vannamei and its role in immunity was further investigated. The ZnF domain of SZnF but not other regions shared high homology with those of fushi tarazu-factor 1 (FTZ-F1) proteins. The SZnF protein was mainly localized in the cytoplasm and was also present in the nucleus at a small level. SZnF was high expressed in the scape and muscle tissues of healthy shrimp and its expression in gill and heptopancreas was strongly up-regulated during bacterial infection. Silencing of SZnf in vivo could strongly increase the susceptibility of shrimp to infection with Vibrio parahaemolyticus but not white spot syndrome virus (WSSV), suggesting that SZnf could be mainly involved in antibacterial responses. Both dual luciferase reporter assays and real-time PCR analysis demonstrated that SZnf could positively regulate the expression of various antimicrobial peptides in vitro and in vivo, which could be part of the mechanism underlying its antibacterial effects. In summary, the current study could help learn more about the function of ZnF-containing proteins and the regulatory mechanisms of immune responses against pathogen infection in crustaceans.
Traditional studies of gene regulation in the Drosophila embryo centered primarily on the analysis of fixed tissues. These methods provided considerable insight into the spatial control of gene activity, such as the borders of eve stripe 2, but yielded only limited information about temporal dynamics. The advent of quantitative live-imaging and genome-editing methods permits the detailed examination of the temporal control of endogenous gene activity. Here, we present evidence that the pair-rule genes fushi tarazu (ftz) and even-skipped (eve) undergo dynamic shifts in gene expression. We observe sequential anterior shifting of the stripes along the anterior to posterior axis, with stripe 1 exhibiting movement before stripe 2 and the more posterior stripes. Conversely, posterior stripes shift over greater distances (two or three nuclei) than anterior stripes (one or two nuclei). Shifting of the ftz and eve stripes are slightly offset, with ftz moving faster than eve This observation is consistent with previous genetic studies, suggesting that eve is epistatic to ftz The precision of pair-rule temporal dynamics might depend on enhancer-enhancer interactions within the eve locus, since removal of the endogenous eve stripe 1 enhancer via CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing led to precocious and expanded expression of eve stripe 2. These observations raise the possibility of an added layer of complexity in the positional information encoded by the segmentation gene regulatory network.
Two Drosophila melanogaster E-twenty-six domain transcription factor isoforms (E74A and E74B) act differentially at the start of the 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E) signalling cascade to regulate larval-pupal metamorphosis. In the present paper, we identified the two isoforms (LdE74A and LdE74B) in Leptinotarsa decemlineata. During the larval development stage, the mRNA transcript levels of the two LdE74 isoforms were correlated with circulating 20E titres. In vitro midgut culture and in vivo dietary supplementation with 20E revealed that the presence of 20E induced expression peaks of both LdE74A and LdE74B, with similar patterns observed for the two isoforms. Moreover, the mRNA transcript levels of both LdE74A and LdE74B isoforms were significantly downregulated in the L. decemlineata ecdysone receptor RNA interference (RNAi) specimens, but not in the LdE75 RNAi beetles. Ingestion of 20E reduced the larval fresh weights and shortened the larval development period, irrespective of knockdown of LdE74 or not. RNAi of LdE74 did not affect 20E-induced expression of the Ecdysone induced protein 75-hormone receptor 3-fushi tarazu factor 1 (E75-HR3-FTZ-F1) transcriptional cascade. Thus, it seems that LdE74 mediates 20E signalling independent of the E75-HR3-FTZ-F1 transcriptional cascade. Furthermore, silencing of both LdE74 isoforms caused failure of ecdysis. Most of the LdE74 RNAi beetles remained as prepupae. The LdE74 RNAi prepupae exhibited adult character-like forms underneath after removal of the apolysed larval cuticle. Their appendages such as antennae, legs and wings were shorter than those of control larvae. Only a few LdE74 RNAi larvae finally became deformed pupae, with shortened antennae and legs. Therefore, LdE74 is required for larval-pupal metamorphosis and appendage growth in L. decemlineata.
The ligand-binding domains (LBDs) of the NR5A subfamily of nuclear receptors activate transcription via ligand-dependent and ligand-independent mechanisms. The Drosophila Ftz-F1 receptor (NR5A3) belongs to the latter category, and its ligand independence is attributed to a short helical segment (α6) within the protein that resides in the canonical ligand-binding pocket (LBP) in the crystalline state. Here, we show that the α6 helix is dynamic in solution when Ftz-F1 is bound to the LxxLL motif of its cofactor Ftz, undergoing motions on the fast (picosecond to nanosecond) as well as slow (microsecond to millisecond) time scales. Motions on the slow time scale (∼10-3 s) appear to pervade throughout the domain, most prominently in the LBP and residues at or near the cofactor-binding site. We ascribe the fast time scale motions to a solvent-accessible conformation for the α6 helix akin to those described for its orthologs in higher organisms. We assign this conformation where the LBP is "open" to a lowly populated species, while the major conformer bears the properties of the crystal structure where the LBP is "closed". We propose that these conformational transitions could allow binding to small molecule ligands and/or play a role in dissociation of the cofactor from the binding site. Indeed, we show that the Ftz-F1 LBD can bind phospholipids, not unlike its orthologs. Our studies provide the first detailed insights into intrinsic motions occurring on a variety of time scales in a nuclear receptor LBD and reveal that potentially functionally significant motions pervade throughout the domain in solution, despite evidence to the contrary implied by the crystal structure.
A set of pair-rule (PR) segmentation genes (PRGs) promotes the formation of alternate body segments in Drosophila melanogaster Whereas Drosophila embryos are long-germ, with segments specified more or less simultaneously, most insects add segments sequentially as the germband elongates. The hide beetle Dermestes maculatus represents an intermediate between short- and long-germ development, ideal for comparative study of PRGs. We show that eight of nine Drosophila PRG orthologs are expressed in stripes in Dermestes Functional results parse these genes into three groups: Dmac-eve, -odd and -run play roles in both germband elongation and PR patterning; Dmac-slp and -prd function exclusively as complementary, classic PRGs, supporting functional decoupling of elongation and segment formation; and orthologs of ftz, ftz-f1, h and opa show more variable function in Dermestes and other species. While extensive cell death generally prefigured Dermestes PRG RNAi-mediated cuticle defects, an organized region with high mitotic activity near the margin of the segment addition zone is likely to have contributed to truncation of eveRNAi embryos. Our results suggest general conservation of clock-like regulation of PR stripe addition in sequentially segmenting species while highlighting regulatory rewiring involving a subset of PRG orthologs.
Hormone receptor 4 (HR4) is involved in the regulation of 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E) biosynthesis and the mediation of 20E signaling during larval-pupal transition in a holometabolan Drosophila melanogaster, whereas it acts as a repressor in 20E-responsive transcriptional cascade in a hemimetabolan, Blattella germanica. Here we characterized two HR4 splicing variants, LdHR4X1 and LdHR4X2, in a coleopteran Leptinotarsa decemlineata. LdHR4X1 was highly expressed in the prothoracic gland and epidermis while LdHR4X2 was abundantly transcribed in the nervous system. In vivo results showed that both prothoracicotropic hormone and 20E pathways transcriptionally regulated LdHR4, in an isoform-dependent pattern. RNA interference of LdHR4 at the final (fourth) larval instar, in contrast to the second- and third-instar periods, enhanced the expression of two ecdysteroidogenesis genes, increased 20E titer, upregulated transcription of five 20E-response genes, and reduced the mRNA level of Fushi tarazu-factor 1 (FTZ-F1). As a result, the fourth-instar LdHR4 RNAi larvae exhibited accelerated development and reduced body weight. Moreover, knockdown of LdHR4 at the fourth instar resulted in larval lethality and impaired pupation. Feeding of pyriproxyfen (a mimic of juvenile hormone) or silencing of a juvenile hormone degrading enzyme gene restored the normal course of ecdysteroidogenesis, duration of larval development, and body weight in fourth-instar LdHR4 RNAi larvae. The treatment partially suppressed the larval mortality but not the failure to pupate. The dual role of HR4 during larval-pupal metamorphosis appears to be evolutionarily conserved among holometabolans.
Earlier [4], we developed a two-stage scheme of the activation of expression of the ecdysone cascade gene ftz-f1 in Drosophila melanogaster S2 cells. In the first intron of the ftz-f1 gene, we found a binding site for the transcription activator DHR3. In this work, we studied the properties of this genomic element: the change in the histone modification level at different stages of transcription activation were analyzed, and data indicating the interaction of the intron element with the promoter were obtained. Taken together, the results of this study indicate that the studied genomic element exhibits the properties of an enhancer and functions at the stage of active gene transcription.
The takeout family genes encode relatively small proteins that are related to olfaction and are regulated by juvenile hormone (JH). The takeout genes modulate various physiological processes, such as behavioral plasticity in the migratory locust Locusta migraloria and feeding and courtship behaviors in Drosophila. Therefore, to understand the regulatory mechanism of these physiological processes, it is important to study the expressions of the takeout genes that are regulated by JH signaling. We used quantitative real-time PCR (qRTPCR) to study the role of JH signaling in the regulation of the takeout family genes in the brown planthopper Nilaparvata lugens (N. lugens) through the application of Juvenile hormone III (JHIII) and the down-regulation of key genes in the JH signaling pathway. The topical application of JHIII induced the expressions of most of the takeout family genes, and their expressions decreased 2 and 3 days after the JHIII application. Down-regulating the brown planthopper JH receptor NlMethoprene-tolerant (NlMet) and its interacting partners, NlTaiman (NlTai) and Nlß-Ftz-F1 (Nlß-Ftz), through RNAi, exhibited distinct effects on the expressions of the takeout family genes. The down-regulation of NlMet and NlKrüppel-homolog 1 (NlKr-h1) increased the expressions of the takeout family genes, while the down-regulation of the Met interacting partners NlTai and Nlß-Ftz decreased the expressions of most of the takeout family genes. This work advanced our understanding of the molecular function and the regulatory mechanism of JH signaling.
Twenty-nine cDNAs encoding Ras-like family small GTPases (RSGs) were cloned and sequenced from Nilaparvata lugens. Twenty-eight proteins are described here: 3 from Rho, 2 from Ras, 9 from Arf and 14 from Rabs. These RSGs from N.lugens have five conserved G-loop motifs and displayed a higher degree of sequence conservation with orthologues from insects. RT-qPCR analysis revealed NlRSGs expressed at all life stages and the highest expression was observed in hemolymph, gut or wing for most of NlRSGs. RNAi demonstrated that eighteen NlRSGs play a crucial role in nymphal development. Nymphs with silenced NlRSGs failed to molt, eclosion or development arrest. The qRT-PCR analysis verified the correlation between mortality and the down-regulation of the target genes. The expression level of nuclear receptors, Kr-h1, Hr3, FTZ-F1 and E93 involved in 20E and JH signal pathway was impacted in nymphs with silenced twelve NlRSGs individually. The expression of two halloween genes, Cyp314a1 and Cyp315a1 involved in ecdysone synthesis, decreased in nymphs with silenced NlSar1 or NlArf1. Cyp307a1 increased in nymphs with silenced NlArf6. In N.lugens with silenced NlSRβ, NlSar1 and NlRab2 at 9th day individually, 0.0% eclosion rate and almost 100.0% mortality was demonstrated. Further analysis showed NlSRβ could be served as a candidate target for dsRNA-based pesticides for N.lugens control.
In insects, the transition from juvenile development to the adult stage is controlled by juvenile hormone (JH) synthesized from the corpora allata (CA) glands. Whereas a JH-free period during the last juvenile instar triggers metamorphosis and the end of the growth period, the reappearance of this hormone after the imaginal molt marks the onset of reproductive adulthood. Despite the importance of such transition, the regulatory mechanism that controls it remains mostly unknown. Here, using the hemimetabolous insect Blattella germanica, we show that nuclear hormone receptors Seven-up-B (BgSvp-B) and Fushi tarazu-factor 1 (BgFTZ-F1) have essential roles in the tissue- and stage-specific activation of adult CA JH-biosynthetic activity. Both factors are highly expressed in adult CA cells. Moreover, RNAi-knockdown of either BgSvp-B or BgFTZ-F1 results in adult animals with a complete block in two critical JH-dependent reproductive processes, vitellogenesis and oogenesis. We show that this reproductive blockage is the result of a dramatic impairment of JH biosynthesis, due to the CA-specific reduction in the expression of two key JH biosynthetic enzymes, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A synthase-1 (BgHMG-S1) and HMG-reductase (BgHMG-R). Our findings provide insights into the regulatory mechanisms underlying the specific changes in the CA gland necessary for the proper transition to adulthood.
NR5A1 is essential for the development and for the function of steroid producing glands of the reproductive system. Moreover, its misregulation is associated with endometriosis, which is the first cause of infertility in women. Hr39, the Drosophila ortholog of NR5A1, is expressed and required in the secretory cells of the spermatheca, the female exocrine gland that ensures fertility by secreting substances that attract and capacitate the spermatozoids. We here identify a direct regulator of Hr39 in the spermatheca: the Gcm transcription factor. Furthermore, lack of Gcm prevents the production of the secretory cells and leads to female sterility in Drosophila. Hr39 regulation by Gcm seems conserved in mammals and involves the modification of the DNA methylation profile of mNr5a1. This study identifies a new molecular pathway in female reproductive system development and suggests a role for hGCM in the progression of reproductive tract diseases in humans.
Influence of waterborne butachlor (BUC), a commonly used pesticide, on morphometric, biochemical, and molecular biomarkers was evaluated in juvenile, full sibling, diploid and triploid African catfish (Clarias gariepinus). Fish were exposed for 21 days to one of three concentrations of BUC [mean measured µg/L: 22, 44 or 60]. Unexposed (control) triploids were heavier and longer and had higher visceral-somatic index (VSI) than diploids. Also, they had lighter liver weight (HSI) and showed lower transcript levels of brain gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), aromatase (cyp191b) and fushi tarazu-factor (ftz-f1), and plasma testosterone levels than diploids. Butachlor treatments had no effects, in either diploid or triploid fish, on VSI, HSI, weight or length changes, condition factor (CF), levels of plasma testosterone, 17-β estradiol (E2), cortisol, cholesterol, or mRNA levels of brain tryptophan hydroxylase (tph2), forkhead box L2 (foxl2), and 11 β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 (11β-hsd2). Expressions of cyp191b and ftz-f1 in triploids were upregulated by the two highest concentrations of BUC. In diploid fish, however, exposures to all BUC concentrations decreased GnRH transcription and the medium BUC concentration decreased ftz-f1 transcription. Substantial differences between ploidies in basal biomarker responses are consistent with the reported impaired reproductive axis in triploid C. gariepinus. Furthermore, the present study showed the low impact of short term exposure to BUC on reproductive axis in C. gariepinus.
Despite the ubiquity of microplastics (MPs) in aquatic environments and their proven ability to carry a wide variety of chemicals, very little is known about the impacts of virgin or contaminant-loaded MPs on organisms. The primary aim of this study was to investigate the impacts of virgin or phenanthrene (Phe)-loaded low-density polyethylene (LDPE) fragments on a suite of biomarker responses in juvenile African catfish (Clarias gariepinus). Virgin LDPE (50 or 500µg/L) were preloaded with one of two nominal Phe concentrations (10 or 100µg/L) and were exposed to the fish for 96h. Our findings showed one or both Phe treatments significantly increased the degree of tissue change (DTC) in the liver while decreased the transcription levels of forkhead box L2 (foxl2) and tryptophan hydroxylase2 (tph2) in the brain of C. gariepinus. Exposure to either levels of virgin MPs increased the DTC in the liver and plasma albumin: globulin ratio while decreased the transcription levels of tph2. Moreover, MPs modulated (interacted with) the impact of Phe on the DTC in the gill, plasma concentrations of cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL), total protein (TP), albumin, and globulin, and the transcription levels of fushi tarazu-factor 1 (ftz-f1), gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), 11 β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 (11β-hsd2), and liver glycogen stores. Results of this study highlight the ability of virgin LDPE fragments to cause toxicity and to modulate the adverse impacts of Phe in C. gariepinus. Due to the wide distribution of MPs and other classes of contaminants in aquatic environments, further studies are urgently needed to elucidate the toxicity of virgin or contaminant-loaded MPs on organisms.
The orphan nuclear receptor Ftz-F1 is expressed in all somatic nuclei in Drosophila embryos, but mutations result in a pair-rule phenotype. This was explained by the interaction of Ftz-F1 with the homeodomain protein Ftz that is expressed in stripes in the primordia of segments missing in either ftz-f1 or ftz mutants. Ftz-F1 and Ftz were shown to physically interact and coordinately activate the expression of ftz itself and engrailed by synergistic binding to composite Ftz-F1/Ftz binding sites. However, attempts to identify additional target genes on the basis of Ftz-F1/ Ftz binding alone has met with only limited success. To discern rules for Ftz-F1 target site selection in vivo and to identify additional target genes, a microarray analysis was performed comparing wildtype and ftz-f1 mutant embryos. Ftz-F1-responsive genes most highly regulated included engrailed and nine additional genes expressed in patterns dependent on both ftz and ftz-f1. Candidate enhancers for these genes were identified by combining BDTNP Ftz ChIP-chip data with a computational search for Ftz-F1 binding sites. Of eight enhancer reporter genes tested in transgenic embryos, six generated expression patterns similar to the corresponding endogenous gene and expression was lost in ftz mutants. These studies identified a new set of Ftz-F1 targets, all of which are co-regulated by Ftz. Comparative analysis of enhancers containing Ftz/Ftz-F1 binding sites that were or were not bona fide targets in vivo suggested that GAF negatively regulates enhancers that contain Ftz/Ftz-F1 binding sites but are not actually utilized. These targets include other regulatory factors as well as genes involved directly in morphogenesis, providing insight into how pair-rule genes establish the body pattern.
Foxl2 and FTZ-F1 play a crucial role in the regulation of gonad development in fish and mammals, but studies of their function in amphibians are scarce. We isolated the full length of Foxl2 (adFoxl2) and Ftz-F1 (adFtz-f1) cDNA from the Chinese giant salamander Andrias davidianus and quantified its expression in various tissues and developing gonads. The adFoxl2 gene encodes 301aa including a conserved forkhead box, and the adFtz-f1 gene encodes 467aa containing an Ftz-F1 box. The amino acid sequences showed high homology with other amphibians. adFoxl2 expression was high in ovary, whereas adFtz-f1 was higher in testis, moderate in pituitary, ovary, and kidney; and low in the remaining tested tissues. Expression of adFoxl2 gradually increased from 1Y to 5Y in ovary, whereas adFtz-f1 expression gradually decreased in testis. In addition, adFoxl2 and adFtz-f1 were detected in granulosa cell in ovary and in spermatocytes in testis. The adFoxl2 transcription was inhibited in brain and ovary after treatment with methyltestosterone and with letrozole, whereas adFtz-f1 expression was upregulated. High-temperature suppressed the expression of adFxl2 in ovary and enhanced the transcription of adFtz-f1. These results suggest that adFoxl2 functioned in ovary differentiation, whereas adFtz-f1 played a role in testis development, which lays a foundation for study of the sex differentiation mechanism in A. davidianus.
Cancer cells have abnormal gene expression profiles; however, to what degree these are chaotic or driven by structured gene regulatory networks is often not known. Here we studied a model of Ras-driven invasive tumorigenesis in Drosophila epithelial tissues and combined in vivo genetics with next-generation sequencing and computational modeling to decipher the regulatory logic of tumor cells. Surprisingly, we discovered that the bulk of the tumor-specific gene expression is controlled by an ectopic network of a few transcription factors that are overexpressed and/or hyperactivated in tumor cells. These factors are Stat, AP-1, the bHLH proteins Myc and AP-4, the nuclear hormone receptor Ftz-f1, the nuclear receptor coactivator Taiman/SRC3, and Mef2. Notably, many of these transcription factors also are hyperactivated in human tumors. Bioinformatic analysis predicted that these factors directly regulate the majority of the tumor-specific gene expression, that they are interconnected by extensive cross-regulation, and that they show a high degree of co-regulation of target genes. Indeed, the factors of this network were required in multiple epithelia for tumor growth and invasiveness, and knockdown of several factors caused a reversion of the tumor-specific expression profile but had no observable effect on normal tissues. We further found that the Hippo pathway effector Yorkie was strongly activated in tumor cells and initiated cellular reprogramming by activating several transcription factors of this network. Thus, modeling regulatory networks identified an ectopic and ordered network of master regulators that control a large part of tumor cell-specific gene expression.
Transcription factors of nuclear receptor 5A (Nr5a) subfamily play pivotal roles in regulation of steroidogenic enzymes in vertebrates including teleosts. In the orange-spotted grouper, the expression of Nr5a1a was only detectable in the ovary, spleen, and head kidney in the female. The immunoreactive Nr5a1a was present in ovarian follicular and germ cells. In the ovarian follicular cells surrounding vitellogenic oocytes, Nr5a1a was detected both in the nucleus and cytoplasm, and co-localized with Cyp19a1a and Nr5a2. In the ovarian follicular cells surrounding fully grown oocytes, Nr5a1a was localized almost exclusively to the cytoplasm together with Nr5a2. Nr5a1a could up-regulate cyp19a1a promoter activities through Nr5a sites, and further increase the responses elicited by Nr5a2 at sub-maximal doses. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis showed that Nr5a1a bound to cyp19a1a promoter in the vitellogenic but not fully grown ovary. Taken together, Nr5a1a up-regulates cyp19a1a additively with Nr5a2 during vitellogenesis, and its cytoplasmic sequestration may also contribute to the down-regulation of cyp19a1a in the fully grown ovary.
Steroidogenic acute regulatory protein 2 (StAR2) is a key protein in transporting cholesterol from the outer mitochondria membrane to the inner mitochondria membrane for sex steroid synthesis. In this study, two StAR2 gene isoforms, StAR2a and StAR2b, were isolated from the olive flounder Paralichthys olivaceus gonads. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR results indicated that their expression levels were higher in testis than those in ovary. StAR2a was mainly expressed in the thecal cells and ooplasm of ovary, and Leydig cells and spermatid of testis according to the results of in situ hybridization. The quantitative real-time PCR results showed that the expressions of StAR2a and StAR2b were high in undifferentiation gonads and differentiating testis, and then decreased in differentiated testis in the high temperature (28°C) and exogenous testosterone treatment groups. While, in the exogenous 17β-estradiol treatment group, both genes' expression levels were high in differentiating ovary, and then significantly decreased in differentiated ovary (P&lt;0.05). StAR2a and StAR2b expression levels were significantly down-regulated in the cultured testis cells treated with the 75 and 150μM cAMP, but significantly up-regulated in the cultured testis cells treated with the 300μM cAMP (P&lt;0.05). Moreover, their expression levels were significantly up-regulated by transfecting the cultured testis cells with pcDNA3.1-NR5a2 and pcDNA3.1-NR0b1 (P&lt;0.05). Above study showed that expression of StAR2 was regulated by cAMP and the transcription factors, NR5a2 and NR0b1, indicating that StAR2 may have functions in flounder gonadal differentiation and maintenance.
The sex ratio of olive flounder Paralichthys olivaceus is sensitive to temperature or exogenous hormone exposures in the period of gonadal differentiation. Among sex-related genes, cyp19a, encoding cytochrome P450 aromatase, exhibits significant sex-dimorphic expression pattern and plays an important role in fish gonadal differentiation and development. The present study investigated the expression levels and promoter methylation dynamics of cyp19a and its regulators (nr5a2 and nr0b1), and sex-steroid hormone levels during flounder gonadal differentiation under the treatments of high temperature and estradiol-17β (E2). The results showed that levels of flounder cyp19a expression and estradiol-17β were repressed by high temperature treatment during this period. The up-regulation of nr5a2 by E2 treatment may be related to the all-female formation, and up-regulation of nr0b1 by high temperature treatment may be associated with masculinization. Co-transfection assay indicated that nr5a2 and nr0b1 were antagonist regulators of cyp19a. Furthermore, cyp19a promoter exhibited significant demethylation phenomenon at early stage of ovarian differentiation. While, high temperature could repress the demethylation process, resulting in hypermethylation maintenance in cyp19a promoter. The hypermethylation promoter was able to suppress cyp19a expression by blocking the nr5a2-mediated transactivation activity in vitro. The DNA methylation of epigenetic modification in cyp19a promoter might be the vital way linking environmental factors and gonadal differentiation in flounder.
The human sense of smell decreases with age, and a poor sense of smell are among the most important prodromal symptoms of several neurodegenerative diseases. Recent evidence further suggests a racial difference in the sense of smell among U.S. older adults. However, no genome-wide association study (GWAS) on the sense of smell has been conducted in African-Americans (AAs). We performed the first genome-wide meta-analysis of the sense of smell among 1979 AAs and 6582 European-Americans (EAs) from three U.S. aging cohorts. In the AA population, we identified nine novel regions (KLF4-ACTL7B, RAPGEF2-FSTL5, TCF4-LOC100505474, PCDH10, KIAA1751, MYO5B, MIR320B1-CD2, NR5A2-LINC00862, SALL1-C16orf97) that were associated with the sense of smell (P &lt; 5 × 10-8). Many of these regions have been previously linked to neuropsychiatric (schizophrenia or epilepsy) or neurodegenerative (Parkinson's or Alzheimer's disease) diseases associated with a decreased sense of smell. In the EA population, we identified two novel loci in or near RASGRP1 and ANXA2P3 associated with sense of smell. In conclusion, this study identified several ancestry-specific loci that are associated with the sense of smell in older adults. While these findings need independent confirmation, they may lead to novel insights into the biology of the sense of smell in older adults and its relationships to neuropsychological and neurodegenerative diseases.
Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified common pancreatic cancer susceptibility variants at 13 chromosomal loci in individuals of European descent. To identify new susceptibility variants, we performed imputation based on 1000 Genomes (1000G) Project data and association analysis using 5,107 case and 8,845 control subjects from 27 cohort and case-control studies that participated in the PanScan I-III GWAS. This analysis, in combination with a two-staged replication in an additional 6,076 case and 7,555 control subjects from the PANcreatic Disease ReseArch (PANDoRA) and Pancreatic Cancer Case-Control (PanC4) Consortia uncovered 3 new pancreatic cancer risk signals marked by single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) rs2816938 at chromosome 1q32.1 (per allele odds ratio (OR) = 1.20, P = 4.88x10 -15), rs10094872 at 8q24.21 (OR = 1.15, P = 3.22x10 -9) and rs35226131 at 5p15.33 (OR = 0.71, P = 1.70x10 -8). These SNPs represent independent risk variants at previously identified pancreatic cancer risk loci on chr1q32.1 ( NR5A2), chr8q24.21 ( MYC) and chr5p15.33 ( CLPTM1L- TERT) as per analyses conditioned on previously reported susceptibility variants. We assessed expression of candidate genes at the three risk loci in histologically normal ( n = 10) and tumor ( n = 8) derived pancreatic tissue samples and observed a marked reduction of NR5A2 expression (chr1q32.1) in the tumors (fold change -7.6, P = 5.7x10 -8). This finding was validated in a second set of paired ( n = 20) histologically normal and tumor derived pancreatic tissue samples (average fold change for three NR5A2 isoforms -31.3 to -95.7, P = 7.5x10 -4-2.0x10 -3). Our study has identified new susceptibility variants independently conferring pancreatic cancer risk that merit functional follow-up to identify target genes and explain the underlying biology.
The enormous complexity of mammalian central nervous system (CNS) is generated by highly synchronized actions of diverse factors and signalling molecules in neural stem/progenitor cells (NSCs). However, the molecular mechanisms that integrate extrinsic and intrinsic signals to control proliferation versus differentiation decisions of NSCs are not well-understood. Here we identify nuclear receptor NR5A2 as a central node in these regulatory networks and key player in neural development. Overexpression and loss-of-function experiments in primary NSCs and mouse embryos suggest that NR5A2 synchronizes cell-cycle exit with induction of neurogenesis and inhibition of astrogliogenesis by direct regulatory effects on Ink4/Arf locus, Prox1, a downstream target of proneural genes, as well as Notch1 and JAK/STAT signalling pathways. Upstream of NR5a2, proneural genes, as well as Notch1 and JAK/STAT pathways control NR5a2 endogenous expression. Collectively, these observations render NR5A2 a critical regulator of neural development and target gene for NSC-based treatments of CNS-related diseases.
Mouse spermatogonial stem cells (mSSCs) may be reprogrammed to become pluripotent stem cells under in vitro culture conditions, due to epigenetic modifications, which are closely associated with the expression of transcription factors and epigenetic factors. Thus, this study was conducted to compare the gene expression of transcription factors and epigenetic factors in mSSCs and mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs). Firstly, the freshly isolated mSSCs [mSSCs (f)] were enriched by magnetic-activated cell sorting with Thy1.2 (CD90.2) microbeads, and the typical morphological characteristics were maintained under in vitro culture conditions for over 5 months to form long-term propagated mSSCs [mSSCs (l)]. These mSSCs (l) expressed pluripotency‑associated genes and were induced to differentiate into sperm. Our findings indicated that the mSSCs (l) expressed high levels of the transcription factors, Lin28 and Prmt5, and the epigenetic factors, Tet3, Parp1, Max, Tert and Trf1, in comparison with the mESCs, with the levels of Prmt5, Tet3, Parp1 and Tert significantly higher than those in the mESCs. There was no significant difference in Kdm2b expression between mSSCs (l) and mESCs. Furthermore, the gene expression of N-Myc, Dppa2, Tbx3, Nr5a2, Prmt5, Tet3, Parp1, Max, Tert and Trf1 in the mSSCs (l) was markedly higher in comparison to that in the mSSCs (f). Collectively, our results suggest that the mSSCs and the mESCs displayed differential gene expression profiles, and the mSSCs possessed the potential to acquire pluripotency based on the high expression of transcription factors and epigenetic factors. These data may provide novel insights into the reprogramming mechanism of mSSCs. 
Obesity and malnutrition are associated with decreased fecundity in women. Impaired reproductive capacity in obese women is often attributed to anovulation. However, obese women with ovulatory cycles also have reduced fertility, but the etiology of their impaired reproduction is only partially understood. Accumulating evidence suggests that obesity directly impairs oocyte and embryo quality as well as endometrial receptivity. In obese women, urinary progesterone metabolite excretion is decreased, but in excess of what can be explained by suppressed gonadotropin secretion, suggesting that apart from its central effect obesity may directly affect progesterone (P4) production. These observations have led to the novel hypothesis that obesity directly affects corpus luteum (CL) function. Similarly, we hypothesize that weight loss may contribute to luteal dysfunction. Here, we propose a non-human primate model, the vervet monkey, to examine the effect of weight gain and loss on menstrual cycle parameters and CL gene expression. In this model, weight gain and loss did not significantly alter menstrual cyclicity; however, both induced alterations in the CL transcriptome. In the weight gain monkey, we observed that impaired mid-luteal P4 secretion was associated with downregulation of steroidogenic pathways in CL. Collectively, these preliminary findings support our hypothesis that weight gain and loss may contribute to CL dysfunction. The vervet model described and preliminary observations provide a basis for a larger study to address this important question. Understanding the mechanisms by which weight gain and loss contribute to reproductive dysfunction can assist in the development of targeted treatments to enhance women's reproductive capability when it is desired.

Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) have variable expression levels of a series of genes that affect their pluripotent potential, but the regulatory mechanisms controlling reprogramming remain unclear. By testing the efficiency of iPSC generation using Oct4, Sox2, Klf4 (termed OSK) plus one additional gene, we found that Rab32 improved reprogramming efficiency. We established a system for detecting the number and the size of lipid droplets and autophagosomes per cell for tracking their morphological changes during reprogramming. Our results showed that Rab32 increased lipid storage during the early and middle stages, and also increased autophagy during the middle stage of reprogramming. These findings were further confirmed by the up-regulation of lipid biosynthesis and autophagosome formation related genes, of which their expression could improve iPSC induction. The inhibition of lipid biosynthesis and autophagosome formation significantly reduced reprogramming efficiency, and the inhibition of lipid synthesis phenotype could be rescued by the overexpression of Rab32. In addition, the expression of pluripotency genes such as Klf2, Nr5a2 and Tbx3, was up-regulated by Rab32. These results demonstrated that Rab32 could improve the induction of iPSCs through the enhancement of lipid biosynthesis, highlighting the importance of lipid metabolism during reprogramming. 
Environmental factors such as pesticides can cause phenotypic changes in various organisms, including mammals. We studied the effects of the widely used herbicide atrazine (ATZ) on meiosis, a key step of gametogenesis, in male mice.
Gene expression pattern was analysed by Gene-Chip array. Genome-wide mapping of H3K4me3 marks distribution was done by ChIP-sequencing of testis tissue using Illumina technologies. RT-qPCR was used to validate differentially expressed genes or differential peaks.
We demonstrate that exposure to ATZ reduces testosterone levels and the number of spermatozoa in the epididymis and delays meiosis. Using Gene-Chip and ChIP-Seq analysis of H3K4me3 marks, we found that a broad range of cellular functions, including GTPase activity, mitochondrial function and steroid-hormone metabolism, are affected by ATZ. Furthermore, treated mice display enriched histone H3K4me3 marks in regions of strong recombination (double-strand break sites), within very large genes and reduced marks in the pseudoautosomal region of X chromosome.
Our data demonstrate that atrazine exposure interferes with normal meiosis, which affects spermatozoa production.
The neuroendocrine system consists of a heterogeneous collection of (mostly) neuropeptidergic neurons found in four hypothalamic nuclei and sharing the ability to secrete neurohormones (all of them neuropeptides except dopamine) into the bloodstream. There are, however, abundant hypothalamic non-neuroendocrine neuropeptidergic neurons developing in parallel with the neuroendocrine system, so that both cannot be entirely disentangled. This heterogeneity results from the workings of a network of transcription factors many of which are already known. Olig2 and Fezf2 expressed in the progenitors, acting through mantle-expressed Otp and Sim1, Sim2 and Pou3f2 (Brn2), regulate production of magnocellular and anterior parvocellular neurons. Nkx2-1, Rax, Ascl1, Neurog3 and Dbx1 expressed in the progenitors, acting through mantle-expressed Isl1, Dlx1, Gsx1, Bsx, Hmx2/3, Ikzf1, Nr5a2 (LH-1) and Nr5a1 (SF-1) are responsible for tuberal parvocellular (arcuate nucleus) and other neuropeptidergic neurons. The existence of multiple progenitor domains whose progeny undergoes intricate tangential migrations as one source of complexity in the neuropeptidergic hypothalamus is the focus of much attention. How neurosecretory cells target axons to the medial eminence and posterior hypophysis is gradually becoming clear and exciting progress has been made on the mechanisms underlying neurovascular interface formation. While rat neuroanatomy and targeted mutations in mice have yielded fundamental knowledge about the neuroendocrine system in mammals, experiments on chick and zebrafish are providing key information about cellular and molecular mechanisms. Looking forward, data from every source will be necessary to unravel the ways in which the environment affects neuroendocrine development with consequences for adult health and disease.
Previous studies have reported that nuclear receptor subfamily 5, group A, member 2 (NR5A2) polymorphisms (rs3790843 G&gt;A, rs3790844 T&gt;C, rs12029406 C&gt;T) are associated with the risk of pancreatic cancer. However, the results of epidemiological investigations are still controversial. In order to explore its potential attributing factors, we pooled the updated literatures to evaluate the association between NR5A2 polymorphism and the risk of pancreatic cancer in this meta-analysis.
Databases such as PubMed, Google Scholar and China National Knowledge Infrastructure were searched for eligible articles following strict inclusion and exclusion criteria (updated to November 18, 2017). Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CIs were computed to assess the intensity of association. In addition, heterogeneity, sensitivity analysis and publication bias were explored. All statistical analyses were conducted by STATA 14.0.
Our results showed that the rs3790843 (GA vs GG: OR=0.86, CI=0.76-0.98, P=0.992; GA+AA vs GG: OR=0.83, CI=0.73-0.94, P=0.950; A vs G: OR=0.85, CI=0.78-0.93, P=0.802), rs3790844 (CC vs TT: OR=0.65, CI=0.54-0.78, P=0.617; CC vs TT+CT: OR=0.73, CI=0.62-0.85, P=0.742; C vs T: OR=0.78, CI=0.73-0.84, P=0.555) and rs12029406 (TT vs CC: OR=0.73, CI=0.61-0.89, P=0.483; TT vs CC+CT: OR=0.78, CI=0.66-0.92, P=0.648; T vs C: OR=0.87, CI=0.79-0.95, P=0.837) polymorphisms were associated statistically with the risk of pancreatic cancer. Furthermore, the results of subgroup analysis showed that rs3790843 and rs3790844 polymorphisms were especially related to the risk of pancreatic cancer in Caucasian population.
Our results revealed that NR5A2 may have a protective effect on pancreatic cancer. However, more well-designed researches are needed to verify the relationship between NR5A2 polymorphisms and the risk of pancreatic cancer.
Quantifying the expression of mRNAs in the gonads at the critical stage of molecular sex differentiation stage might help to clarify the regulatory network during early sex differentiation and provide new information on the role of sex-related genes in gonadal function. In this study, transcriptomic analysis of sex-related genes expression profiles in fugu gonads at 60 and 90 days after hatching (dah) was conducted firstly, and a total of 112,504,991 clean reads, encompassing 28.35 Gb of sequences were retrieved. Twenty-three thousand eight hundred ten genes were found to be expressed in juvenile fugu gonads, and we mainly focused on the differentially expressed genes that have the potential to be involved in the gonadal sex differentiation. For 60-dah juveniles, we identified 1014 genes that were upregulated in the ovary and 1570 that were upregulated in the testis. For 90-dah juveniles, we identified 1287 genes that were upregulated in the ovary and 1500 that were upregulated in the testis. The dimorphic expression patterns of 15 genes in gonads at 30 and 40 dah were further investigate using qPCR. Cyp11b and star were expressed at higher levels in XY than in XX, while cyp11a1 and cyp19a1a were expressed at higher levels in XX than in XY at 30 dah. At 40 dah, the levels of gsdf, dmrt1, dmrt3, cyp11c1, star, and hsd3b expression were higher in XY, while the levels of foxl2, cyp19a1a, wnt9b, and foxD4 expression were higher in XX. Sox9, cyp11a1, cyp17a1, cyp17a2, and nr5a2 were expressed at similar levels in XX and XY at 40 dah. This is the first report of gonadal transcriptome of fugu at early sex differentiation stage, and our results provide an archive for further study on molecular mechanism underlying sex differentiation in this species.
Pancreatic cancer is the fourth leading cause for cancer-related death, and early diagnosis is one key to improve the survival rate of this disease. Molecular biomarkers are an important method for diagnostic use in pancreatic cancer. We used data from three mRNA microarray datasets and a microRNA dataset (GSE16515, GSE15471, GSE28735, and GSE41372) to identify potential key genes. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and microRNAs (DEMs) were identified. Functional, pathway enrichment, and protein-protein interaction analyses were performed on common DEGs across all datasets. The target genes of the DEMs were identified. DEMs targets that were also DEGs were further scrutinized using overall survival analysis. A total of 236 DEGs and 21 DEMs were identified. There were a total of four DEGs (ECT2, NR5A2, NRP2, and TGFBI), which were also predicted target genes of DEMs. Overall survival analysis showed that high expression levels of three of these genes (ECT2, NRP2, and TGFBI) were associated with poor overall survival for pancreatic cancer patients. The basic expression of DEGs in pancreas stood lower level in various organ tissues. The expression of ECT2 and NRP2 was higher in different pancreatic cancer cell lines than normal pancreas cell line. Knockout of ECT2 by Crispr Cas9 gene editing system decreased proliferation and migration ability in pancreatic cancer cell line MiaPaCa2. In conclusion, we think that data mining method can do well in biomarker screening, and ECT2 and NRP2 can play as potential biomarker or therapy target by Crispr Cas9 in pancreatic cancer.
After zygotic genome activation and lineage specification, zygotes develop into late blastocysts comprising three distinct cell types. The molecular mechanisms underlying this progress are largely unknown in pigs. Here, we intended to analyze an extensive set of regulators at the single-cell level to define the events involved in the development of the porcine blastocysts. Using a quantitative microfluidics approach in single cells, we detected mRNA levels of 96 genes known to function in early embryonic development and maintenance of stem cell pluripotency simultaneously in 480 individual cells derived from porcine preimplantation embryos. The developmental transitions can be distinguished based on distinctive gene expression profiles, and we identified paired box 6 (PAX6) and aquaporin 3 (AQP3) expressed in early and late developmental stages, respectively. Two lineages can be segregated in porcine early and late blastocysts by the expression patterns of lineage-specific genes such as DAB2, clathrin adaptor protein (DAB2) for trophectoderm (TE), platelet derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFRA), Nanog homeobox (NANOG), fibronectin 1 (FN1), hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 alpha (HNF4A), goosecoid homeobox (GSC), nuclear receptor subfamily 5 group A member 2 (NR5A2), and lysine acetyltransferase 6A (KAT6A; previously known as MYST3) for inner cell mass (ICM). However, the epiblast and primitive endoderm cannot be identified in late blastocysts, and those TE or ICM lineage-specific genes were low expressed in blastomeres from the morula. Our results shed light on early cell fate determination in porcine preimplantation embryos and offer theoretical support for deriving porcine embryonic stem cells.
Pancreatic cancer (PC) is the seventh most common cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide that kills more than 300,000 people every year. Prognosis of PC is very poor with a five-year survival rate about 5%. The most common and highly observed type of PC is pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). It is preceded by the progression of precursor lesions such as Pancreatic Intraepithelial Neoplasia (PanIN), Intraductal Papillary Neoplasm (IPMN) and Mucinous Cystic Neoplasm (MCN). PanIN is the most common among these premalignant lesions. Genes orchestrating the origin and differentiation of cells during organogenesis have the tendency to produce tumor cells in response to activating or inactivating mutations. Based on the following premise, we discuss the role of transcription factors (TFs) of pancreas development and cell fate differentiation in PC. Pancreas/duodenum homeobox protein 1 (PDX1), Pancreas transcription factor 1 subunit alpha (PTF1A), Nuclear receptor subfamily 5 group A member 2 (NR5A2), Hepatocyte nuclear factor 1-alpha (HNF1A) and Hepatocyte nuclear factor 1-beta (HNF1B) play vital role in the development and differentiation of pancreatic precursor cells. Mutated KRAS induces abnormalities in the regular function of these TFs which in turn cause abnormal cell growth and proliferation that leads to cancer. Thus, these TFs are highly susceptible for the origin of PC. Therefore, we propose that these TFs can be treated as therapeutic targets for the development of anticancer drugs.
Exogenous expression of the gene encoding the pancreatic master regulator PDX1 in cell lines with different degrees of differentiation of pancreatic cancer cells is accompanied by changes in the expression of known master genes involved in cancer progression. In BxPC3PDX+ cells, as compared to BxPC3PDX-, we detected an increased expression of the following genes: NKX6.1 (2 times), NR5A2 (2.5 times), KLF5 (1.8 times), ZEB1 (3 times), and ONECUT1 (1.3 times), as well as a decreased expression of MUC1 and SLUG genes (3 and 2 times, respectively). In PANC1PDX+ cells, as compared to the control PANC1PDX- cells, we detected a decreased expression of ISL1 (2 times) and an increased expressed of KRT8 (2 times) and MUC1 (by 30%). In the high-grade cell lines (including the BxPC3 line studied), the total content of sites containing the marks of active enhancers was higher than that in the low-grade cell lines (PANC1).
P450c17, a key enzyme in the steroid generation pathway, plays an important role in the production of sex steroid and cortisol. In this study, two cyp17 gene isoforms, Pocyp17-I and Pocyp17-II were isolated from Paralichthys olivaceus gonads. Domain architecture analysis of Pocyp17-I and Pocyp17-II revealed that they had three regions important to enzymatic function. Structural analysis showed that Pocyp17-I and Pocyp17-II had 8 and 9 exons respectively, and the difference was caused by the insertion of an extra intron (intron1) in the latter. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction results indicated that the expression of these two genes showed sexually dimorphism that Pocyp17-I and Pocyp17-II were highest expressed in testis and ovary, respectively. The in situ hybridization analysis of gonads indicated that Pocyp17-I and Pocyp17-II mRNA were both detected in oocytes, spermatocytes and Sertoli cells. After injection of androgen and estrogen (17α-methyltestosterone, 17β-estradiol) of different concentrations, the expression level of Pocyp17-I decreased significantly (P &lt; 0.01), whereas estrogen had no influence on Pocyp17-II, but androgen upregulated the expression of Pocyp17-II (P &lt; 0.05). Moreover, Pocyp17-I expression level was down-regulated significantly by NR0b1 but up-regulated by NR5a2 (P &lt; 0.05), whereas Pocyp17-II expression level was down-regulated significantly by NR0b1 and NR5a2 (P &lt; 0.05). All these results demonstrated that there were differences in expression patterns, feedback actions of sex hormones and transcriptional regulations between cyp17-I and cyp17-II, which revealed that cyp17-I and cyp17-II might perform different functions in sex hormones biosynthesis and gonadal differentiation in Japanese flounder.
Glucocorticoids impair testosterone synthesis by an unknown mechanism. Stallions treated with the synthetic glucocorticoid dexamethasone had testes collected at 6 or 12 hours postinjection. The testicular expression of selected genes encoding nuclear receptors and steroidogenic enzymes was measured. At 6 hours, dexamethasone treatment decreased levels of NR0B2, NR4A1, NR5A1, and NR5A2 messenger RNAs (mRNAs) and NR5A2 mRNA levels remained depressed at 12 hours. In contrast, dexamethasone increased levels of NFKBIA mRNA at both time points. At 6 hours, dexamethasone did not alter levels of NR0B1, NR2F1, NR2F2, NR3C1, CYP11A1, CYP17A1, CYP19A1, DHCR24, GSTA3, HSD3B2, HSD17B3, LHCGR, or STAR mRNAs. In primary cultures of Leydig cells, 10 -9 and 10 -7 M dexamethasone decreased levels of NR4A1 and NR5A1 mRNAs and increased those of NFKBIA mRNA. Our discovery that dexamethasone downregulates NR4A1, NR5A1, and NR5A2 genes, known to be important for testicular functions, may be part of the mechanism by which glucocorticoids acutely decreases testosterone.
The pathophysiology of hydrocephalus induced brain damage remains unclear. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been demonstrated to be implicated in many central nervous system diseases. However, the roles of lncRNAs in hydrocephalus injury are poorly understood.
The present study depicted the expression profiles of lncRNAs and messenger RNAs (mRNAs) in C57BL/6 mice with kaolin-induced hydrocephalus and saline controls using high-throughput RNA sequencing. Afterward, Gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analyses were performed to identify potential targets that correlated with hydrocephalus. In addition, co-expression networks and cis- and trans-regulation were predicted using bioinformatics methods. Finally, representative lncRNAs and mRNAs were further validation using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction.
A total of 1575 lncRNAs and 1168 mRNAs were differentially expressed (DE) in hydrocephalus. GO and KEGG analyses indicated several immune and inflammatory response-associated pathways may be important in the hydrocephalus. Besides, functional enrichment analysis based on co-expression network showed several similar pathways, such as chemokine signaling pathway, phagosome, MAPK signaling pathway and complement and coagulation cascade. Cis-regulation prediction revealed 5 novel lncRNAs might regulate their nearby coding genes, and trans-regulation revealed several lncRNAs participate in pathways regulated by transcription factors, including BPTF, FOXM1, NR5A2, P2RX5, and NR6A1.
In conclusion, our results provide candidate genes involved in hydrocephalus and suggest a new perspective on the modulation of lncRNAs in hydrocephalus.
Lung cancer has the highest mortality rate due to late diagnosis and high incidence of metastasis. Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are a subgroup of cancer cells with self-renewal capability similar to that of normal stem cells (NSCs). While CSCs may play an important role in cancer progression, mechanisms underlying CSC self-renewal and the relationship between self-renewal of the NSCs and CSCs remain elusive. The orphan nuclear receptor Nr5a2 is a transcriptional factor, and a regulator of stemness of embryonic stem cells and induced pluripotent stem cells. However, whether Nr5a2 regulates the self-renewal of lung CSCs is unknown. Here, we showed the diagnostic and prognostic values of elevated Nr5a2 expression in human lung cancer. We generated the mouse LLC-SD lung carcinoma CSC cellular model in which Nr5a2 expression was enhanced. Using the LLC-SD model, through transient and stable siRNA interference of Nr5a2 expression, we provided convincing evidence for a regulatory role of Nr5a2 in the maintenance of lung CSC self-renewal and stem cell properties in vitro. Further, using the syngeneic and orthotopic lung transplantation model, we elucidated augmented cancer biological properties associated with Nr5a2 promotion of LLC-SD self-renewal. More importantly, we revealed that Nr5a2's regulatory role in promoting LLC-SD self-renewal is mediated by transcriptional activation of its direct target Nanog. Taken together, in this study, we have provided convincing evidence in vitro and in vivo demonstrating that Nr5a2 can induce lung CSC properties and promote tumorigenesis and progression through transcriptional up-regulation of Nanog.
The advancement of bioinformatics and machine learning has facilitated the discovery and validation of omics-based biomarkers. This study employed a novel approach combining multi-platform transcriptomics and cutting-edge algorithms to introduce novel signatures for accurate diagnosis of colorectal cancer (CRC). Different random forests (RF)-based feature selection methods including the area under the curve (AUC)-RF, Boruta, and Vita were used and the diagnostic performance of the proposed biosignatures was benchmarked using RF, logistic regression, naïve Bayes, and k-nearest neighbors models. All models showed satisfactory performance in which RF appeared to be the best. For instance, regarding the RF model, the following were observed: mean accuracy 0.998 (standard deviation (SD) &lt; 0.003), mean specificity 0.999 (SD &lt; 0.003), and mean sensitivity 0.998 (SD &lt; 0.004). Moreover, proposed biomarker signatures were highly associated with multifaceted hallmarks in cancer. Some biomarkers were found to be enriched in epithelial cell signaling in Helicobacter pylori infection and inflammatory processes. The overexpression of TGFBI and S100A2 was associated with poor disease-free survival while the down-regulation of NR5A2, SLC4A4, and CD177 was linked to worse overall survival of the patients. In conclusion, novel transcriptome signatures to improve the diagnostic accuracy in CRC are introduced for further validations in various clinical settings.
DNA methylation plays a vital role in reproduction. Entire genome DNA methylation changes during the oestrous phase (ES) and dioestrous phase (DS) in the ovaries of Guanzhong dairy goats were investigated using bisulphite sequencing to understand the molecular biological mechanisms of these goats' oestrous cycle.
We discovered distinct genome-wide DNA methylation patterns in ES and DS ovaries. A total of 26,910 differentially methylated regions were upregulated and 21,453 differentially methylated regions were downregulated in the ES samples compared with the DS samples (P-values ≤0.05 and fold change of methylation ratios ≥2). Differentially methylated region analysis showed hypomethylation in the gene body regions and hypermethylation in the joining region between upstream regions and gene bodies. The methylation ratios of the STAR, FGF2, FGF12, BMP5 and SMAD6 genes in the ES samples were lower than those of the DS samples (P-values ≤0.05 and fold change of methylation ratios ≥2). Conversely, the methylation ratios of the EGFR, TGFBR2, IGF2BP1 and MMD2 genes increased in the ES samples compared with the DS samples. In addition, 223 differentially methylated genes were found in the GnRH signalling pathway (KO04912), ovarian steroidogenesis pathway (KO04913), oestrogen signalling pathway (KO04915), oxytocin signalling pathway (KO04921), insulin secretion pathway (KO04911) and MAPK signalling pathway (KO04010).
This study is the first large-scale comparison of the high-resolution DNA methylation landscapes of oestrous and dioestrous ovaries from dairy goats. Previous studies and our investigations have shown that the NR5A2, STAR, FGF2 and BMP5 genes might have potential application value in regulating caprine oestrus.
Antipsychotic (AP) drugs are used to treat psychiatric disorders but are associated with significant weight gain and metabolic disease. Increased food intake (hyperphagia) appears to be a driving force by which APs induce weight gain but the mechanisms are poorly understood. Here we report that administration of APs to C. elegans induces hyperphagia by a mechanism that is genetically distinct from basal food intake. We exploit this finding to screen for adjuvant drugs that suppress AP-induced hyperphagia in C. elegans and mice. In mice AP-induced hyperphagia is associated with a unique hypothalamic gene expression signature that is abrogated by adjuvant drug treatment. Genetic analysis of this signature using C. elegans identifies two transcription factors, nhr-25/Nr5a2 and nfyb-1/NFYB to be required for AP-induced hyperphagia. Our study reveals that AP-induced hyperphagia can be selectively suppressed without affecting basal food intake allowing for novel drug discovery strategies to combat AP-induced metabolic side effects.
The pharmaceutical compounds that modulate pluripotent stem cell (PSC) identity and function are increasingly adopted to generate qualified PSCs and their derivatives, which have promising potential in regenerative medicine, in pursuit of more accuracy and safety and less cost. Here, we demonstrate the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα) agonist as a novel enhancer of pluripotency acquisition and induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) generation. We found that PPARα agonist, examined and selected Food and Drug Administration (FDA) -approved compound libraries, increase the expression of pluripotency-associated genes, such as Nanog, Nr5A2, Oct4, and Rex1, during the reprogramming process and facilitate iPSC generation by enhancing their reprogramming efficiency. A reprogramming-promoting effect of PPARα occurred via the upregulation of Nanog, which is essential for the induction and maintenance of pluripotency. Through bioinformatic analysis, we identified putative peroxisome proliferator responsive elements (PPREs) located within the promoter region of the Nanog gene. We also determined that PPARα can activate Nanog transcription by specific binding to putative PPREs. Taken together, our findings suggest that PPARα is an important regulator of PSC pluripotency and reprogramming, and PPARα agonists can be used to improve PSC technology and regenerative medicine.
By 2030 70% of newly diagnosed pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) will occur in older adults. Elderly patients, defined by the World Health Organization (WHO) as people older than 65 years, represent a heterogeneous group with different biological and functional characteristics that need personalized anticancer treatments. Since older patients are under-represented in randomized phase III trials, their management is mostly extrapolated from studies performed in younger patients, without robust evidence-based recommendations. However, data from retrospective studies and case-control series show that elderly may benefit from chemotherapy in both the adjuvant and advanced disease settings. Although with discordant results, gemcitabine-based treatment and dose-adapted fluorouracil combination regimens seem to be effective and well tolerated in this subset of patients. A proper balance of potential treatment benefits and side effects represent the crucial point for managing elderly patients with PDAC. Therefore an appropriate patient selection is essential to maximize the therapeutic benefit in the older population: randomized studies aiming to better standardizing fitness parameters and implementing the routine use of comprehensive geriatric assessments are strongly warranted. In this light, the detection of molecular prognostic markers able to detect patients who may benefit more from oncological treatments should be a primary endpoint of age-focused clinical trials. Altogether, the field of geriatric oncology will expand in the next years, and the clinical management of elderly patients affected by PDAC will become a major public health issue.
Early mammalian development entails transit through naive pluripotency towards post-implantation epiblast, which subsequently gives rise to primordial germ cells (PGC), the founding germline population. To investigate these cell fate transitions, we developed a compound-reporter to track cellular identity in a model of PGC specification (PGC-like cells; PGCLC), and coupled it with genome-wide CRISPR screening. We identify key genes both for exit from pluripotency and for acquisition of PGC fate, and characterise a central role for the transcription regulators Nr5a2 and Zfp296 in germline ontogeny. Abrogation of these genes results in widespread activation (Nr5a2-/-) or inhibition (Zfp296-/-) of WNT pathway factors in PGCLC. This leads to aberrant upregulation of the somatic programme or failure to activate germline genes, respectively, and consequently loss of germ cell identity. Our study places Zfp296 and Nr5a2 as key components of an expanded PGC gene regulatory network, and outlines a transferable strategy for identifying critical regulators of complex cell fate decisions.
Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a heterogeneous endocrine disorder in women of reproductive age and is commonly complicated by adverse endometrial outcomes. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are a class of non-protein-coding transcripts that are more than 200 nucleotides in length. Accumulating evidence indicates that lncRNAs are involved in the development of various human diseases. Among these lncRNAs, lncRNA CD36-005 (CD36-005) is indicated to be associated with the pathogenesis of PCOS. However, the mechanisms of action of CD36-005 have not yet been elucidated.
This study determined the CD36-005 expression level in the uteri of PCOS rat model and its effect on the proliferation activity of rat primary endometrial stromal cells. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and bioinformatics analysis were performed to detect the mRNA expression profiles and the biological pathways in which these differentially expressed mRNAs involved, after CD36-005 overexpression in the primary endometrial stromal cells. The differential expression of Hmgn5, Nr5a2, Dll4, Entpd1, Fam50a, and Brms1 were further validated by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR).
CD36-005 is highly expressed in the uteri of PCOS rat model and promotes the proliferation of rat primary endometrial stromal cells. A total of fifty-five mRNAs differentially expressed were identified in CD36-005 overexpressed stromal cells. Further analyses identified that these differentially expressed mRNAs participate in many biological processes and are associated with various human diseases. The results of qRT-PCR validation were consistent with the RNA-seq data.
These data provide a list of potential target mRNA genes of CD36-005 in endometrial stromal cells and laid a foundation for further studies on the molecular function and mechanism of CD36-005 in the endometrium.
Epigenetics is involved in sex differentiation of gonochoristic and hermaphroditic fish species, whereby two genes dmrt1 (pro-male) and cyp19a1 (pro-female) are known to play major roles. Barramundi, Lates calcarifer, is an important tropical aquaculture species that undergo natural and permanent male to female sex change, a process for which the exact underlying molecular mechanisms are still unknown. To elucidate whether DNA methylation is involved in sex control of barramundi, a next-generation bisulfite amplicon sequencing approach was used to target 146 CpG sites within proximal promoters and first exons of seven sex-related genes (dmrt1, cyp19a1, amh, foxl2, nr5a2, sox8 and sox9) of 24 testis and 18 ovaries of captive and wild adult barramundi. Moreover, comparative expression profiles of the key dmrt1 and cyp19a1 genes were further investigated using RT-qPCR and Sanger sequencing approaches, whereas expression levels of remaining targeted genes were based on available literature for the species. Results showed that cyp19a1 and amh were more methylated in males, whereas dmrt1 and nr5a2 were more methylated in females (P &lt; 0.001), with no gender differences found for foxl2, sox8 or sox9 genes (P &gt; 0.05). Sex-biased promoter DNA methylation was inversely related to gene expression only for dmrt1 and nr5a2, and directly related to amh expression, whereas no differences in cyp19a1 expression were found between testes and ovaries. Notably, unique sex-specific alternative splicing of dmrt1 and cyp19a1 were discovered, whereby males lacked the full-length aromatase coding cyp19a1 mRNA due to partial or total exon splicing, and females lacked the dmrt1 exon containing the DM-domain sequence. This study advances the current knowledge aiming to elucidate the genetic mechanisms within male and female gonads of this large protandrous hermaphrodite by providing the first evidence of epigenetics and alternative splicing simultaneously affecting key genes (cyp19a1 and dmrt1) central to sex differentiation pathways.
The normal menstrual cycle requires a delicate interplay between the hypothalamus, pituitary and ovary. Therefore, its length is an important indicator of female reproductive health. Menstrual cycle length has been shown to be partially controlled by genetic factors, especially in the follicle-stimulating hormone beta-subunit (FSHB) locus. A genome-wide association study meta-analysis of menstrual cycle length in 44 871 women of European ancestry confirmed the previously observed association with the FSHB locus and identified four additional novel signals in, or near, the GNRH1, PGR, NR5A2 and INS-IGF2 genes. These findings not only confirm the role of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis in the genetic regulation of menstrual cycle length but also highlight potential novel local regulatory mechanisms, such as those mediated by IGF2.
The P450 side-chain cleavage enzyme, P450scc (Cyp11a) catalyzes the first enzymatic step for the synthesis of all steroid hormones in fish. To study its roles in gonads of the olive flounder Paralichthys olivaceus, an important maricultured fish species, we isolated the cyp11a genomic DNA sequence of 1396 bp, which consists of 5 exons and 4 introns. Semi-quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) results indicated that the flounder cyp11a was exclusively expressed in gonad and head kidney tissues. Its expression level in the testis was higher than that in the ovary. According to the in situ hybridization patterns, cyp11a was mainly expressed in the Leydig cells of the testis, and the thecal cells of the ovary. Immunofluorescence analysis showed that Cyp11a was located in the cytoplasm of the cultured flounder testis cells. Further quantitative real-time PCR results presented the cyp11a differential expression patterns during gonad differentiation. Among different sampling points of the 17β-estradiol (E2, 5 ppm) treatment group, cyp11a expression levels were relatively high in the differentiating ovary (30 and 40 mm total length, TL), and then significantly decreased in the differentiated ovary (80, 100 and 120 mm TL, p &lt; 0.05). The pregnenolone level also dropped in the differentiated ovary. In the high temperature treatment group (HT group, 28 ± 0.5 °C), the cyp11a expression level fluctuated remarkably in the differentiating testis (60 mm TL), and then decreased in the differentiated testis (80, 100 mm TL, p &lt; 0.05). In the testosterone (T, 5 ppm) treatment group, the cyp11a was expressed highly in undifferentiated gonads and the differentiating testis, and then dropped in the differentiated testis. Moreover, the levels of cholesterol and pregnenolone of the differentiating testis in the HT and T groups increased. The expression level of cyp11a was significantly down-regulated after the cultured flounder testis cells were treated with 75 and 150 μM cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), respectively (p &lt; 0.05), and significantly up-regulated after treatment with 300 μM cAMP (p &lt; 0.05). Both nuclear receptors NR5a2 and NR0b1 could significantly up-regulate the cyp11a gene expression in a dosage dependent way in the testis cells detected by cell transfection analysis (p &lt; 0.05). The above data provides evidence that cyp11a would be involved in the flounder gonad differentiation and development.
This study examined the hypothesis that xanthosine (XS) treatment would promote mammary-specific gene expression and stem cell transcripts and have a positive influence on milk yield of dairy goats. Seven primiparous Beetal goats were assigned to the study. Five days after kidding, one gland (either left or right) was infused with XS (TRT) twice daily for 3 d and the other gland with no XS infusion served as a control (CON). Mammary biopsies were collected at 10 d and RNA was isolated. Gene expression analysis of milk synthesis genes, mammary stem/progenitor cell markers, cell proliferation and differentiation markers were performed using real time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR). Results showed that the transcripts of milk synthesis genes (BLG4, CSN2, LALBA, FABP3, CD36) and mammary stem/progenitor cell markers (ALDH1 and NR5A2) were increased in as a result of XS treatment. Average milk yield in TRT glands was increased marginally (approximately ~2% P = 0·05, paired t-test) per gland relative to CON gland until 7 wk. After 7 wk, milk yield of TRT and CON glands did not differ. Analysis of milk composition revealed that protein, lactose, fat and solids-not-fat percentages remained the same in TRT and CON glands. These results suggest that XS increases expression of milk synthesis genes, mammary stem/progenitor cells and has a small effect on milk yield.
Di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), a widely used plasticizer, is a ubiquitous environmental contaminant and may act as an endocrine disruptor. Early life exposures to DEHP may result in anti-androgenic effects, impairing the development of the male reproductive tract. However, data on the long-lasting consequences of such DEHP exposures on adult male reproductive function are still rare and discrepant. Previously, we identified 2 novel plasticizers, 1,4-butanediol dibenzoate (BDB) and dioctyl succinate (DOS), as potential substitutes for DEHP that did not reproduce classically described endocrine disrupting phenotypes in prepubertal male offspring after maternal exposure. Here, we investigated the consequences of in utero and lactational exposure to BDB and DOS on adult male rat reproductive function in a comparative study with DEHP and a commercially available alternative plasticizer, 1,2-cyclohexane dicarboxylic acid diisononyl ester (DINCH). Timed pregnant Sprague Dawley rats were gavaged with vehicle or a test chemical (30 or 300 mg/kg/day) from gestation day 8 to postnatal day 21. While DEHP exposure (300 mg/kg/day) significantly increased epididymal weight in the adult, exposure to DINCH, BDB, or DOS did not affect reproductive organ weights, steroid levels, or sperm quality. Using a toxicogenomic microarray approach, we found that adult testicular gene expression was affected by exposure to the higher dose of DEHP; transcripts such as Nr5a2, Ltf, or Runx2 were significantly downregulated, suggesting that DEHP was targeting estrogen signaling. Lesser effects were observed after treatment with either DINCH or BDB. DOS exposure did not produce such effects, confirming its potential as a responsible substitute for DEHP.
The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of dietary daidzein supplementation on reproductive performance in rats. A total of twenty-four female Sprague⁻Dawley (SD) rats were randomly allocated to two groups and fed either with a basal diet (CON) or basal diet containing 50 mg/kg daidzein (DAI) from gestation until delivery stage. The results show that daidzein supplementation significantly increased the total litter weight and the total viable newborn weight (p &lt; 0.05). Interestingly, daidzein supplementation acutely elevated the concentrations of serum estrogen, progesterone and insulin-like growth factor-1 (p &lt; 0.01) after the maternal rats&amp;rsquo; delivery. The concentrations of serum immunoglobulin A (IgA) and immunoglobulin G (IgG) were also significantly higher in the DAI maternal rats than in the CON maternal rats (p &lt; 0.05). Moreover, daidzein significantly increased the total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC) in maternal rats&amp;rsquo; sera and in newborns (p &lt; 0.05) and elevated the concentration of superoxide dismutase (SOD) in both the maternal rats&amp;rsquo; sera and their ovaries (p &lt; 0.05). Importantly, daidzein supplementation significantly elevated the expression levels of estrogen receptor &amp;beta; (ER&amp;beta;) and NR5A2 genes in maternal rats&amp;rsquo; ovaries (p &lt; 0.05) and downregulated the expression level of prolactin receptor (PRLR) in newborns (p &lt; 0.05). These results suggest that dietary daidzein supplementation improves reproductive performance and fetal development in rats, which is associated with changes in serum hormones, tissue antioxidant capacity, and expression levels of reproductive-related genes, both in maternal rats and their offspring.
beta-Klotho, a newly described membrane protein, regulates bile acid synthesis. Fibroblast growth factor-15 (FGF-15) and FGF receptor-4 (FGFR4) knockout mice share a similar phenotype with beta-Klotho-deficient mice. FGF-15 secretion by the intestine regulates hepatic bile acid biosynthesis. The effects of beta-Klotho and FGF-15 on the ileal apical sodium bile transporter (ASBT) are unknown. beta-Klotho siRNA treatment of the mouse colon cancer cell line, CT-26, and the human intrahepatic biliary epithelial cells (HIBEC) resulted in upregulation of endogenous ASBT expression that was associated with reduced expression of the farnesoid X receptor (FXR) and the short heterodimer partner (SHP). Silencing beta-Klotho activated the ASBT promoter in CT-26, Mz-ChA-1 (human cholangiocarcinoma), and HIBEC cells. Site-directed mutagenesis of liver receptor homolog-1 (mouse) or retinoic acid receptor/retinoid X receptor (RAR/RXR) (human) cis-elements attenuated the basal activity of the ASBT promoter and abrogated its response to beta-Klotho silencing. siSHP, siFXR, or dominant-negative FXR treatment also eliminated the beta-Klotho response. FGF-15 secretion into cell culture media by CT-26 cells was diminished after siFGF-15 or sibeta-Klotho treatment and enhanced by chenodeoxycholic acid. Exogenous FGF-19 repressed ASBT protein expression in mouse ileum, gallbladder, and in HIBEC and repressed ASBT promoter activity in Caco-2, HIBEC, and Mz-ChA-1 cells. Promoter repression was dependent on the expression of FGFR4. These results indicate that both beta-Klotho and FGF-15/19 repress ASBT in enterocytes and cholangiocytes. These novel signaling pathways need to be considered in analyzing bile acid homeostasis.
Adiponectin is a fat-derived hormone with antidiabetic and antiatherogenic properties. Hypoadiponectinemia seen in obesity is associated with insulin-resistant diabetes and atherosclerosis. Thiazolidinediones, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPAR-gamma) agonists, have been shown to increase plasma adiponectin levels by the transcriptional induction in adipose tissues. However, the precise mechanism of such action is unknown. In this study, we have identified a functional PPAR-responsive element (PPRE) in human adiponectin promoter. PPAR-gamma/retinoid X receptor (RXR) heterodimer directly bound to the PPRE and increased the promoter activity in cells. In adipocytes, point mutation of the PPRE markedly reduced the basal transcriptional activity and completely blocked thiazolidinedione-induced transactivation of adiponectin promoter. We have also identified a responsive element of another orphan nuclear receptor, liver receptor homolog-1 (LRH-1), in adiponectin promoter. LRH-1 was expressed in 3T3-L1 cells and rat adipocytes. LRH-1 bound specifically to the identified responsive element (LRH-RE). LRH-1 augmented PPAR-gamma-induced transactivation of adiponectin promoter, and point mutation of the LRH-RE significantly decreased the basal and thiazolidinedione-induced activities of adiponectin promoter. Our results indicate that PPAR-gamma and LRH-1 play significant roles in the transcriptional activation of adiponectin gene via the PPRE and the LRH-RE in its promoter.
Previous data demonstrate that bexarotene (Bex), retinoid X receptor (RXR) agonist, reduces soluble and insoluble amyloid-β (Aβ) in Alzheimer disease (AD)-transgenic mice either by increasing the levels of mouse apolipoprotein E (apoE) or increasing ABCA1/ABCG1-induced apoE lipoprotein association/lipidation. However, although the mechanism of action of RXR agonists remains unclear, a major concern for their use is human (h)-APOE4, the greatest AD genetic risk factor. If APOE4 imparts a toxic gain-of-function, then increasing apoE4 may increase soluble Aβ, likely the proximal AD neurotoxin. If the APOE4 loss-of-function is lipidation of apoE4, then induction of ABCA1/ABCG1 may be beneficial. In novel EFAD-Tg mice (overexpressing h-Aβ42 with h-APOE), levels of soluble Aβ (Aβ42 and oligomeric Aβ) are highest in E4FAD hippocampus (HP) &gt; E3FAD-HP &gt; E4FAD cortex (CX) &gt; E3FAD-CX, whereas levels of lipoprotein-associated/lipidated apoE have the opposite pattern (6 months). In E4FAD-HP, short-term RXR agonist treatment (Bex or LG100268; 5.75-6 months) increased ABCA1, apoE4 lipoprotein-association/lipidation, and apoE4/Aβ complex, decreased soluble Aβ, and increased PSD95. In addition, hydrogel delivery, which mimics low sustained release, was equally effective as gavage for Bex and LG100268. RXR agonists induced no beneficial effects in the E4FAD-HP in a prevention protocol (5-6 months) and actually increased soluble Aβ levels in E3FAD-CX and E4FAD-CX with the short-term protocol, possibly the result of systemic hepatomegaly. Thus, RXR agonists address the loss-of-function associated with APOE4 and exacerbated by Aβ pathology, i.e. low levels of apoE4 lipoprotein association/lipidation. Further studies are vital to address whether RXR agonists are an APOE4-specific AD therapeutic and the systemic side effects that limit translational application. 
In mammals, excess energy is stored primarily as triglycerides, which are mobilized when energy demands arise. This review mainly focuses on the role of long chain fatty acids (LCFAs) in regulating energy metabolism as ligands of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs). PPAR-alpha expressed primarily in liver is essential for metabolic adaptation to starvation by inducing genes for beta-oxidation and ketogenesis and by downregulating energy expenditure through fibroblast growth factor 21. PPAR-delta is highly expressed in skeletal muscle and induces genes for LCFA oxidation during fasting and endurance exercise. PPAR-delta also regulates glucose metabolism and mitochondrial biogenesis by inducing FOXO1 and PGC1-alpha. Genes targeted by PPAR-gamma in adipocytes suggest that PPAR-gamma senses incoming non-esterified LCFAs and induces the pathways to store LCFAs as triglycerides. Adiponectin, another important target of PPAR-gamma may act as a spacer between adipocytes to maintain their metabolic activity and insulin sensitivity. Another topic of this review is effects of skin LCFAs on energy metabolism. Specific LCFAs are required for the synthesis of skin lipids, which are essential for water barrier and thermal insulation functions of the skin. Disturbance of skin lipid metabolism often causes apparent resistance to developing obesity at the expense of normal skin function. 
Apolipoprotein E (apoE) plays a critical role in maintaining synaptic integrity by transporting cholesterol to neurons through the low-density lipoprotein receptor related protein-1 (LRP1). Bexarotene, a retinoid X receptor (RXR) agonist, has been reported to have potential beneficial effects on cognition by increasing brain apoE levels and lipidation. To investigate the effects of bexarotene on aging-related synapse loss and the contribution of neuronal LRP1 to the pathway, forebrain neuron-specific LRP1 knockout (nLrp1(-/-)) and littermate control mice were administered with bexarotene-formulated diet (100mg/kg/day) or control diet at the age of 20-24 months for 8 weeks. Upon bexarotene treatment, levels of brain apoE and ATP-binding cassette sub-family A member 1 (ABCA1) were significantly increased in both mice. While levels of PSD95, glutamate receptor 1 (GluR1), and N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor NR1 subunit (NR1), which are key postsynaptic proteins that regulate synaptic plasticity, were decreased with aging, they were restored by bexarotene treatment in the brains of control but not nLrp1(-/-) mice. These results indicate that the beneficial effects of bexarotene on synaptic integrity depend on the presence of neuronal LRP1. However, we also found that bexarotene treatment led to the activation of glial cells, weight loss and hepatomegaly, which are likely due to hepatic failure. Taken together, our results demonstrate that apoE-targeted treatment through the RXR pathway has a potential beneficial effect on synapses during aging; however, the therapeutic application of bexarotene requires extreme caution due to its toxic side effects.
Resistance to radiation therapy constitutes a significant challenge in the treatment of head and neck squamous cell cancer (HNSCC). Alteration in DNA methylation is thought to play a role in this resistance. Here, we analyzed DNA methylation changes in a matched model of radiation resistance for HNSCC using the Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip. Our results show that compared to radiation-sensitive cells (SCC-61), radiation-resistant cells (rSCC-61) had a significant increase in DNA methylation. After combining these results with microarray gene expression data, we identified 84 differentially methylated and expressed genes between these 2 cell lines. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis revealed ILK signaling, glucocorticoid receptor signaling, fatty acid α-oxidation, and cell cycle regulation as top canonical pathways associated with radiation resistance. Validation studies focused on CCND2, a protein involved in cell cycle regulation, which was identified as hypermethylated in the promoter region and downregulated in rSCC-61 relative to SCC-61 cells. Treatment of rSCC-61 and SCC-61 with the DNA hypomethylating agent 5-aza-2'deoxycitidine increased CCND2 levels only in rSCC-61 cells, while treatment with the control reagent cytosine arabinoside did not influence the expression of this gene. Further analysis of HNSCC data from The Cancer Genome Atlas found increased methylation in radiation-resistant tumors, consistent with the cell culture data. Our findings point to global DNA methylation status as a biomarker of radiation resistance in HNSCC, and suggest a need for targeted manipulation of DNA methylation to increase radiation response in HNSCC. 
Highly degenerate PCR primers were designed based on the amino acid sequence of the zinc finger motifs of known nuclear receptor members. Reverse transcription (RT)-PCR was performed using these degenerate primers starting with total RNA isolated from human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC). We identified 13 nuclear receptors of which three were novel. Of the novel orphans two-RZR alpha and PHR-1-were further characterised. Cloning of their cDNAs and sequence comparisons revealed that RZR alpha is related to Drosophila DHR3, RAR and RXR. PHR-1 turned out to be the human homologue of the recently published murine LRH-1. By Northern blot analyses we found RZR alpha mRNA expressed in a variety of organs, whereas a high amount of PHR-1 mRNA was found in pancreas and less in liver. This technique not only aides in the identification of additional members of the nuclear receptor superfamily but also measures relative changes in the expression of nuclear receptors between two different biological states, for example, normal and disease states.
Aromatase inhibitors target the production of estrogen in breast adipose tissue, but in doing so, also decrease estrogen formation in bone and other sites, giving rise to deleterious side effects, such as bone loss and arthralgia. Thus, it would be clinically useful to selectively inhibit aromatase production in breast. In this regard, we have determined that the orphan nuclear receptor liver receptor homologue-1 (LRH-1) is a specific transcriptional activator of aromatase gene expression in human breast preadipocytes but not in other tissues of postmenopausal women. In this study, we show that the coactivator peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator-1alpha (PGC-1alpha) is a physiologically relevant modulator of LRH-1, and that its transcriptional activity can be inhibited effectively using receptor-interacting peptide antagonists that prevent PGC-1alpha recruitment. Interestingly, we note that all of these peptides also interact in an agonist-dependent manner with retinoid X receptor alpha (RXRalpha), suggesting that these two receptors may compete for limiting cofactors within target cells. In support of this hypothesis, we show that 9-cis-retinoic acid, acting through RXR, inhibits both the basal and PGC-1alpha-induced transcriptional activity of LRH-1. The importance of this finding was confirmed by showing that LRH-1-dependent, PGC-1alpha-stimulated regulation of aromatase gene expression in primary human breast preadipocytes was effectively suppressed by RXR agonists. We infer from these data that LRH-1 is a bona fide target whose inhibition would selectively block aromatase expression in breast, while sparing other sites of expression.
Embryonic stem (ES) cells have great therapeutic potential because they are capable of indefinite self-renewal and have the potential to differentiate into over 200 different cell types that compose the human body. The switch from the pluripotent phenotype to a differentiated cell involves many complex signaling pathways including those involving LIF/Stat3 and the transcription factors Sox2, Nanog and Oct-4. Many nuclear receptors play an important role in the maintenance of pluripotence (ERRbeta, SF-1, LRH-1, DAX-1) repression of the ES cell phenotype (RAR, RXR, GCNF) and also the differentiation of ES cells (PPARgamma). Here we review the roles of the nuclear receptors involved in regulating these important processes in ES cells.
From a database containing the published nuclear hormone receptor (NR) sequences I constructed an alignment of the C, D and E domains of these molecules. Using this alignment, I have performed tree reconstruction using both distance matrix and parsimony analysis. The robustness of each branch was estimated using bootstrap resampling methods. The trees constructed by these two methods gave congruent topologies. From these analyses I defined six NR subfamilies: (i) a large one clustering thyroid hormone receptors (TRs), retinoic acid receptors (RARs), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs), vitamin D receptors (VDRs) and ecdysone receptors (EcRs) as well as numerous orphan receptors such as RORs or Rev-erbs; (ii) one containing retinoid X receptors (RXRs) together with COUP, HNF4, tailless, TR2 and TR4 orphan receptors; (iii) one containing steroid receptors; (iv) one containing the NGFIB orphan receptors; (v) one containing FTZ-F1 orphan receptors; and finally (vi) one containing to date only one gene, the GCNF1 orphan receptor. The relationships between the six subfamilies are not known except for subfamilies I and IV which appear to be related. Interestingly, most of the liganded receptors appear to be derived when compared with orphan receptors. This suggests that the ligand-binding ability of NRs has been gained by orphan receptors during the course of evolution to give rise to the presently known receptors. The distribution into six subfamilies correlates with the known abilities of the various NRs to bind to DNA as homo- or heterodimers. For example, receptors heterodimerizing efficiently with RXR belong to the first or the fourth subfamilies. I suggest that the ability to heterodimerize evolved once, just before the separation of subfamilies I and IV and that the first NR was able to bind to DNA as a homodimer. From the study of NR sequences existing in vertebrates, arthropods and nematodes, I define two major steps of NR diversification: one that took place very early, probably during the multicellularization event leading to all the metazoan phyla, and a second occurring later on, corresponding to the advent of vertebrates. Finally, I show that in vertebrate species the various groups of NRs accumulated mutations at very different rates.
The thyroid hormone (3,5,3'-triiodothyronine) receptor (T3R) belongs to the nuclear receptor superfamily of ligand-inducible transcription factors. T3Rs are known to bind as homodimers and heterodimers with retinoid X receptors (RXRs) to two hexameric half-sites in directly repeated, palindromic, and inverted palindromic orientations. The binding of T3R monomers to individual half-sites was often reported, but no clear ligand-induced transactivational activity has been shown. Here, we analyzed interactions of T3R monomers with individual half-sites of the sequence NNAGGTCA. We found that the two nucleotides 5' of the AGGTCA core half-site strongly influence T3R binding and transcriptional activity: octameric half-sites of the consensus sequence (T/C)(A/G)AGGTCA were bound by T3Rs with the highest affinity. This suggests T3R functioning also as a monomeric transcription factor like the orphan nuclear receptors NGFI-B and FTZ-F1. Moreover, we observed that the function of T3R-RXR heterodimers on response elements composed of two half-sites in a directly repeated orientation spaced by 4 nucleotides is determined in major parts by the 5'-flanking sequence of the upstream half-site. Consequently, we noted that the affinity of T3R homodimers is influenced by both 5'-flanking sequences. Our findings suggest that the binding of dimerizing receptors like T3R and other nuclear receptors to their cognate response elements is determined not only by the half-site core sequence, orientation, and number of spacing nucleotides, but also by the nucleotide sequence preceding the half-sites.
Nuclear hormone receptors are ligand-activated transcription factors that regulate the expression of target genes by binding to hormone responsive elements (HRE) in their 5' upstream region. Retinoids which are known for their teratogenicity and which have a potential role in the specification of the anteroposterior axis of vertebrate embryos regulate transcription via a hormone-like mechanism by activating nuclear retinoic acid receptors, designated RAR and RXR. Of the several isoforms of RAR found in embryos of Xenopus laevis, xRAR gamma 2 appears to be the most abundant. During the early retinoic acid-sensitive period of development, the total amount of xRAR gamma 2 transcript and protein is increased and a highly specific pattern of expression emerges. During neurulation, the receptor is predominantly found in the dorsal posterior region, in the head endomesoderm, and in the rostral hindbrain. The dependence of this pattern on mesoderm induction and on neural induction is discussed. Contrasting with the elaborate pattern of xRAR gamma 2, the FTZ-F1-related nuclear orphan receptors (xFF1rA/B) are ubiquitous nuclear proteins in Xenopus embryos, as are the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors xPPAR alpha and beta. PPARs are activated by polyunsaturated fatty acids and regulate the synthesis of enzymes involved in lipid metabolism. Later in development, the isoforms xPPAR alpha, beta, and gamma attain different tissue specificities.
In an attempt to understand development and differentiation processes of the parasitic blood fluke Schistosoma mansoni, several members of the nuclear receptor superfamily were cloned, including SmFtz-F1 (S. mansoni Fushi Tarazu-factor 1). The Ftz-F1 nuclear receptor subfamily only contains orphan receptors that bind to their response element as monomers. Whereas SmFtz-F1 displays these basic functional properties, we have identified an original and specific interaction between SmFtz-F1 and the schistosome RXR homologue, SmRXR1. The mammalian two-hybrid assay showed that the D, E, and F domains of SmFtz-F1 were capable of interacting specifically with the E domain of SmRXR1 but not with that of mouse RXRalpha. Using three-dimensional LBD homology modelling and structure-guided mutagenesis, we were able to demonstrate the essential role of exposed residues located in the dimerization interfaces of both receptors in the maintenance of the interaction. Cotransfection experiments with constructions encoding full-length nuclear receptors show that SmRXR1 potentiates the transcriptional activity of SmFtz-F1 from various promoters. Nevertheless, the lack of identification of a dimeric response element for this SmFtz-F1/SmRXR1 heterodimer seems to indicate a "tethering" mechanism. Thus, our results suggest for the first time that a member of the Ftz-F1 family could heterodimerize functionally with a homologue of the universal heterodimerization partner of nuclear receptors. This unique property confirms that SmFtz-F1 may be involved in the development and differentiation of schistosome-specific structures.
The steroid hormone 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E) initiates metamorphosis in insects by signaling through the ecdysone receptor complex, a heterodimer of the ecdysone receptor (EcR) and ultraspiracle (USP). Analysis of usp mutant clones in the wing disc of Drosophila shows that in the absence of USP, early hormone responsive genes such as EcR, DHR3 and E75B fail to up-regulate in response to 20E, but other genes that are normally expressed later, such as (&amp;bgr;)-Ftz-F1 and the Z1 isoform of the Broad-Complex (BRC-Z1), are expressed precociously. Sensory neuron formation and axonal outgrowth, two early metamorphic events, also occur prematurely. In vitro experiments with cultured wing discs showed that BRC-Z1 expression and early metamorphic development are rendered steroid-independent in the usp mutant clones. These results are consistent with a model in which these latter processes are induced by a signal arising during the middle of the last larval stage but suppressed by the unliganded EcR/USP complex. Our observations suggest that silencing by the unliganded EcR/USP receptor and the subsequent release of silencing by moderate steroid levels may play an important role in coordinating early phases of steroid driven development.
Premature baboons exhibit peripheral insulin resistance and impaired insulin signaling. 5' AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activation improves insulin sensitivity by enhancing glucose uptake (via increased glucose transporter type 4 [GLUT4] translocation and activation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase [ERK]/ atypical protein kinase C [aPKC] pathway), and increasing fatty acid oxidation (via inhibition of acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1 [ACC]), while downregulating gluconeogenesis (via induction of small heterodimer partner [SHP] and subsequent downregulation of the gluconeogenic enzymes: phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase [PEPCK], glucose 6-phosphatase [G6PASE], fructose- 1,6-bisphosphatase 1 [FBP1], and forkhead box protein 1 [FOXO1]). The purpose of this study was to investigate whether pharmacologic activation of AMPK with AICAR (5-aminoimidazole-4-carboximide riboside) administration improves peripheral insulin sensitivity in preterm baboons. 11 baboons were delivered prematurely at 125±2 days (67%) gestation. 5 animals were randomized to receive 5 days of continuous AICAR infusion at a dose of 0.5 mg·g-1·day-1. 6 animals were in the placebo group. Euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamps were performed at 5±2 and 14±2 days of life. Key molecules potentially altered by AICAR (AMPK, GLUT4, ACC, PEPCK, G6PASE, FBP1, and FOXO1), and the insulin signaling molecules: insulin receptor (INSR), insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1), protein kinase B (AKT), and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha (PGC1α) were measured using RT-PCR and western blotting. AICAR infusion did not improve whole body insulin-stimulated glucose disposal in preterm baboons (12.8±2.4 vs 12.4±2.0 mg/(kg·min), p = 0.8, placebo vs AICAR). One animal developed complications during treatment. In skeletal muscle, AICAR infusion did not increase phosphorylation of ACC, AKT, or AMPK whereas it increased mRNA expression of ACACA (ACC), AKT, and PPARGC1A (PGC1α). In the liver, INSR, IRS1, G6PC3, AKT, PCK1, FOXO1, and FBP1 were unchanged, whereas PPARGC1A mRNA expression increased after AICAR infusion. This study provides evidence that AICAR does not improve insulin sensitivity in premature euglycemic baboons, and may have adverse effects.
Hepatopulmonary syndrome (HPS) is a serious complication of liver disease, which is characterized by the presence of intrapulmonary vasodilation and progressive hypoxemia. Liver transplantation is the only effective treatment.
To show our results of patients with hepatopulmonary syndrome undergoing liver transplantation.
Retrospective, descriptive and cross-sectional study. From March 2000 to December 2016; 226 liver transplants were performed. Of the total, 25 patients were excluded: 12 retransplantation, 9 liver-kidney combined transplants, 2 transplants for acute liver failure, 2 transplants in non-cirrhotic patients. Of the 201 patients with pretransplant diagnosis of liver cirrhosis, 19 filled criteria for SHP; who were distributed according to age, sex, hypoxemia level (pO2), Child-Pugh score and MELD score. The reversibility hypoxemia after liver trasplantation was measured with a cut-off of p02 &gt;75 mmHg.
The prevalence of SHP in our series was 9.45%. The average age was 41 years (14-65); the M / F ratio of 1.65. The 78.94% (15/19) were adults. 89.5% (17/19) were Score of Child-Pugh B and C, and 68.4% had severe and very severe SHP. In 94.11% of patients, reversibility SHP founded. The early mortality rate (30 days) in patients with SHP was 10.4%.
The prevalence of HPS in our series was 9.45%. Transplanted patients with and without SHP had similar survival.
The risk of thrombus formation in the left atrial appendage (LAA) in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) may result from blood stasis, local endocardial changes, and/or changed blood composition. Extracellular vesicles (EVs), especially subtypes exposing tissue factor (TF), have procoagulant capacity. We hypothesized that blood concentrations of TF-bearing EVs and other procoagulant biomarkers are elevated in AF patients, particularly in the LAA lumen.
From 13 AF patients and 12 controls a venous blood sample was drawn prior to cardiac surgery. Intraoperatively, venous blood and blood directly from the LAA was drawn. Plasma levels of EVs, including TF- and cell type specific antigen-bearing EVs, were measured using a protein microarray platform. Plasma levels of TF, von Willebrand factor (vWF), cell free deoxyribonucleic acid (cf-DNA), procoagulant phospholipids (PPLs), and total submicron particles were also evaluated.
Significantly higher EV levels, including a several-fold higher median level of TF-bearing EVs were measured in AF patients compared with controls. Median concentrations of TF and vWF were approximately 40% and 30% higher, respectively, in the AF group than in the control group, while no significant differences in levels of cf-DNA, PPLs, or total submicron particles were observed. No significant differences in levels of any of the measured analytes were observed between intraoperative venous and LAA samples.
Increased plasma concentrations of TF in AF patients are accompanied and probably at least partly explained by increased levels of TF-bearing EVs, which may be mechanistically involved in increased thrombogenicity in AF patients.
Polygonum multiflorum Thunb (Heshouwu, HSW) is commonly used in clinical medicine, while the hepatotoxicities of HSW are reported increasingly in recent years. Currently, researchers have demonstrated an essential role of Bile Acids (BAs) in liver diseases. The occurrence of hepatotoxicity cases linked to HSW are characterized by jaundice and cholestasis, suggesting an interaction that between BAs and HSW AIM OF THE STUDY: This study was designed to investigate the HSW-induced liver functional and histological changes in mice and the role of HSW on bile acid synthesis, metabolism, clearance and intestinal absorption.
The mice were intragastrically (i.g.) given HSW at doses of 1.275 and 3.825 g/kg (Crude extracts /body weight) once a day for seven days. Liver function was evaluated by measuring the serum levels of enzymes and analyzing the liver histology. The LC/MS analysis was performed to quantify BAs from liver, ileum and serum. Moreover, the expression of bile metabolic-related transporters and metabolic enzymes at both protein and mRNA levels were observed to elucidate the underlying mechanisms.
Oral administration of HSW for 7 days could not cause liver damage. A significant change was observed for the concentrations of liver and serum BAs in treatment groups compared with normal control. The mRNA expression levels of bile acid excretory transporter (Bsep) and basolateral uptake transporter (Ntcp) were increased with the development of HSW. The concentrations of unconjugated BAs increased in mice intestines after the administration of HSW. Western blot and qRT-PCR analyses showed that HSW upregulated the protein and mRNA expression of Shp and Fgf15 in the ileum of the mice.
HSW treatment for 7days did not cause liver damage. HSW accelerated bile acid enterohepatic circulation and changed the composition of intestinal BAs, leding to the activation of Fxr-Fgf15 signal in intestines, and further inhibited the expression of Cyp7a1 in the liver.
Control of bacterial infection-induced inflammatory responses is one of the effective therapeutic approaches of periodontal diseases. Natural products such as lipid mediators and metabolites from microorganisms have been used for decreasing inflammation. We previously reported that (+)-terrein inhibited activation of STAT3 and ERK1/2 in interleukin-6 (IL-6) signaling cascade, leading to prevent vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) secretion in human gingival fibroblasts (HGFs). However, little is still known about the role of (+)-terrein on inflammatory responses. In this study, we provided the possibility of novel action that (+)-terrein inhibits activation of Janus-activated kinase 1 (JAK1), which has a central function in IL-6 signaling cascade, and alters expression of mRNAs and proteins induced by IL-6/soluble IL-6 receptor (sIL-6R) stimulation in HGFs. First, we performed PCR array to examine IL-6/sIL-6R-induced mRNA expression, and then expression of mRNA and protein of colony stimulating factor-1 (CSF1) and VEGF were clearly determined by quantitative RT-PCR and ELISA, respectively. Treatment with (+)-terrein suppressed expression of mRNA and protein of CSF1 and VEGF by IL-6/sIL-6R stimulation. Next, to test the effect of (+)-terrein on IL-6/sIL-6R signaling cascade, we demonstrated whether (+)-terrein affects phosphorylation of JAK1 and its downstream proteins, Akt and SHP-2. Western blotting revealed that (+)-terrein inhibited IL-6/sIL-6R-induced phosphorylation of JAK1, Akt, and SHP-2. Therefore, (+)-terrein suppresses IL-6/sIL-6R-induced expression of CSF1 and VEGF via inhibition of JAK1, Akt, and SHP-2. Based on our results, we suggest that (+)-terrein is a candidate compound for anti-inflammatory effect associated with IL-6 signaling.
A series of our previously described BH3 peptide mimetics derived from Bim-BH3 domain core region were found to exhibit weak to potent PTP1B binding affinity and inhibitory activities via target-based drug screening. Among these compounds, a 12-aa Bim-BH3 core sequence peptide conjugated to palmitic acid (SM-6) displayed good PTP1B binding affinity (KD = 8.38 nmol/L), inhibitory activity (IC50 = 1.20 μmol/L) and selectivity against other PTPs (TCPTP, LAR, SHP-1 and SHP-2). Furthermore, SM-6 promoted HepG2 cell glucose uptake and inhibited the expression of PTP1B, indicating that SM-6 could improve the insulin resistance effect in the insulin-resistant HepG2 cell model. These results may indicate a new direction for the application of BH3 peptide mimetics and promising PTP1B peptide inhibitors could be designed and developed based on SM-6.
Activation of TLR7 and TLR9 by endogenous RNA- or DNA-containing ligands, respectively, can lead to hyper-activation of immune cells, including macrophages and DCs, subsequently contributes to the pathogenesis of SLE. CD180, a TLR-like protein, is specifically involved in the development and activation of immune cells. Our previous study and others have reported that CD180-negative B cells are dramatically increased in SLE patients and responsible for the production of auto-antibodies. However, the mode of CD180 expression on macrophages and DCs in SLE remains unclear and the role of CD180 on regulating TLR7- and TLR9-mediated activation of macrophages and DCs are largely unknown. In the present study, we found that the percentages of CD180-negative macrophages and DCs were both increased in SLE patients and lupus-prone MRL/lpr mice compared with healthy donors and wild-type mice, respectively. Notably, ligation of CD180 significantly inhibited the activation of TLR7 and TLR9 signaling pathways in macrophages and DCs through the Lyn-SHP-1/2 axis. What's more, injection of anti-CD180 Ab could markedly ameliorate the lupus-symptoms of imiquimod-treated mice and lupus-prone MRL/lpr mice through inhibiting the activation of macrophages and DCs. Collectively, our results highlight a critical role of CD180 in regulating TLR7- and TLR9-mediated activation of macrophages and DCs, hinting that CD180 can be regarded as a potential therapeutic target for SLE treatment.
The response of cells to mechanical inputs is a key determinant of cell behavior. In response to external forces, E-cadherin initiates signal transduction cascades that allow the cell to modulate its contractility to withstand the force. Much attention has focused on identifying the E-cadherin signaling pathways that promote contractility, but the negative regulators remain undefined. In this study, we identify SHP-2 as a force-activated phosphatase that negatively regulates E-cadherin force transmission by dephosphorylating vinculin Y822. To specifically probe a role for SHP-2 in E-cadherin mechanotransduction, we mutated vinculin so that it retains its phosphorylation but cannot be dephosphorylated. Cells expressing the mutant vinculin have increased contractility. This work provides a mechanism for inactivating E-cadherin mechanotransduction and provides a new method for specifically targeting the action of phosphatases in cells.
Understanding the molecular mechanisms for the development of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) will improve our ability to cure the patients. qRT-PCR was applied for the examination of the efficiency of shRNA for DNMT1, the expression of suppressor genes, miRNA-152. The MTT analysis, cell cycle analysis, clonal formation, and apoptotic analysis were used to examine the functions of DNMT1 and miR-152 in lymphoma cells. Methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (MSP) was used to examine the methylation of tumor suppressor genes. The dual luciferase assay and western blot were used to validate if DNMT1 is the target of miR-152. For the in vivo experiments, the lymphoma cells were injected into the nude mice for quantification of the tumor growth after transfection of miR-152 mimics. Knockdown of DNMT1 by shRNA (sh-DNMT1) in OCI-Ly10 and Granta-159 cells significantly upregulated the expression of tumor suppressor genes (SOCS3, BCL2L10, p16, p14, and SHP-1) via decreasing their methylation level. At the cellular level, we found sh-DNMT1 inhibited the proliferation, clonal formation and cell cycle progression and induced the cell apoptosis of lymphoma cells. Furthermore, we found miR-152 can downregulates the expression of DNMT1 via directly targeting the gene. Overexpression of miR-152 also increased the expression of tumor suppressor genes SOCS3 and SHP-1. And miR-152 also can inhibit the cell proliferation and induce the cell apoptosis. Moreover, we found overexpression of miR-152 significantly repressed the tumor growth with decreased DNMT1 expression and increased expression of tumor suppressor genes in vivo. Our study demonstrates that miR-152 can inhibit lymphoma growth via suppressing DNMT1-mediated silencing of SOCS3 and SHP-1. These data demonstrate a new mechanism for the development of NHL and this may provide a new therapeutic target for NHL.
Although depression and cognitive dysfunction are connected, limited tools exist to capture the patient's perspective on cognitive dysfunction and its impact on major depressive disorder (MDD). We report results of a psychometric validation of the Perceived Deficits Questionnaire-Depression (PDQ-D), a self-report measure of cognitive dysfunction for use in MDD.
A non-interventional, prospective, panel-recruited, online survey was conducted using the PDQ-D in adults with and without MDD in the US and UK. Respondents were assessed at baseline and after 6 weeks (MDD only) (baseline: US n=418, UK n=437, 49% MDD; follow-up: US n=169, UK n=153, all MDD). The criterion measures included: Medical Outcomes Study Cognitive Functioning Scale-Revised-acute form (MOS COG-R), Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), Patient Global Impression of Severity scale (PGI-Severity), Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS), Work Productivity and Activity Impairment Questionnaire: Specific-Health Problem (WPAI:SHP), and modified Lam Employment Absence and Productivity Scale (LEAPS). US and UK data were analyzed separately.
Internal consistency was high for PDQ-D total scale and four subscales (Cronbach's alpha 0.81-0.96). Convergent validity was good, with strong concordance with MOS COG-R and moderate/small correlations with PHQ-9, SDS, WPAI:SHP, LEAPS, and PGI-Severity. Significant differences (all P&lt;0.001) existed for all PDQ-D subscale and total scores between MDD/non-MDD samples. The PDQ-D was responsive to changes in depression symptom severity. Confirmatory factor analysis supported scoring of a global overall scale for perceived cognitive dysfunction.
The PDQ-D provides a reliable and valid measure of subjective cognitive dysfunction in patients with MDD.
Farnesoid X receptor (FXR) is mainly present in enterohepatic tissues and regulates cholesterol, lipid, and glucose homeostasis in coordination with target genes such as SHP and FABP6. Although FXR has been revealed to be expressed in reproductive tissues, FXR function and expression levels in the ovary remain unknown. In this study, we investigated FXR expression in mouse ovaries and its target genes in ovarian granulosa cells. In situ hybridization and immunohistochemical staining showed that FXR was mainly distributed in secondary and tertiary follicles. The agonist-induced activation of FXR in cultured granulosa cells induced the expression of SHP and FABP6, while siRNA targeting of FXR decreased CYP19a1 and HSD17b1 expression. Upon examination of the roles of SHP and FABP6 in granulosa cells, we found that SHP overexpression significantly decreased StAR, CYP11a1, and HSD3b gene expression. In addition, siRNA targeting of FABP6 decreased CYP19a1 and HSD17b1 expression, while FABP6 overexpression increased CYP19a1 expression. In conclusion, the present study demonstrates the presence of FXR signaling in the ovary and reveals that FXR signaling may have a role in function of granulosa cells.
The quality of wheat grain is mainly determined by the quantity and composition of its grain storage proteins (GSPs). Grain storage proteins consist of low- and high-molecular-weight glutenins (LMW-GS and HMW-GS, respectively) and gliadins. The synthesis of these proteins is essentially regulated at the transcriptional level and by the availability of nitrogen and sulfur. The regulation network has been extensively studied in barley where BLZ1 and BLZ2, members of the basic leucine zipper (bZIP) family, activate the synthesis of hordeins. To date, in wheat, only the ortholog of BLZ2, Storage Protein Activator (SPA), has been identified as playing a major role in the regulation of GSP synthesis. Here, the ortholog of BLZ1, named SPA Heterodimerizing Protein (SHP), was identified and its involvement in the transcriptional regulation of the genes coding for GSPs was analyzed. In gel mobility shift assays, SHP binds cis-motifs known to bind to bZIP family transcription factors in HMW-GS and LMW-GS promoters. Moreover, we showed by transient expression assays in wheat endosperm that SHP acts as a repressor of the activity of these gene promoters. This result was confirmed in transgenic lines overexpressing SHP, which were grown with low and high nitrogen supply. The phenotype of SHP-overexpressing lines showed a lower quantity of both LMW-GS and HMW-GS, while the quantity of gliadin was unchanged, whatever the nitrogen availability. Thus, the gliadin/glutenin ratio was increased, which suggests that gliadin and glutenin genes may be differently regulated.
8-methoxypsoralen (8-MOP) with ultraviolet A radiation therapy (PUVA) is the standard therapy for patients with psoriasis, despite the reported potential risks of 8-MOP-induced cholestatic liver injury in both humans and animals. Usually, patients with chronic cholestasis exhibit lower serum 25-hydroxy vitamin D (25(OH)D) levels. But those patients receiving PUVA for psoriasis showed an increase in serum 25(OH)D levels, probably highlighting that the vitamin D-vitamin D nuclear receptor (VD-VDR) axis play a protective role in 8-MOP-induced hepatotoxicity. The present study confirmed 8-MOP could increase serum 25(OH)D levels in conventional lighting and diet (CLD) and vitamin D deficient (VDD) Sprague-Dawley rats. Potential liver risks were also found in CLD and VDD rats after 8-MOP treatment. We proved that 8-MOP could be a potent ligand for VDR using molecular docking and luciferase report assay. Effect of 8-MOP on VDR subcellular distribution was determined using human liver cell line L02. We found 8-MOP could increase VDR protein expression in the nuclear and cytosol extracts and also total cell extracts in L02. siRNAs for VDR were used to determine the role of VDR in protecting 8-MOP-induced cholestasis and potential cellular mechanisms. The results showed 8-MOP could affect the CYP7A1, SHP and MRP3 expression via VDR, and such effects could be reversed by knockdown of VDR expression, suggesting a vital role of VDR involved in 8-MOP-regulated bile acid synthesis and transportation. In conclusion, these results revealed activation of VD-VDR axis may play a beneficial role in 8-MOP-mediated regulation of bile acid synthesis and transportation.
This paper reviews methods to arrive at optimum decision tree or label tree structures to analyze large SHP datasets. Supervised methods of analysis can utilize either sequential or (flat) multi-classifiers depending on the variance in the data, and on the number of spectral classes to be distinguished. For small number of spectral classes, multi-classifiers have been used in the past, but for the analysis of datasets containing large numbers (∼20) of disease or tissue types, mixed decision tree structures were found to be advantageous. In these mixed structures, discrimination into classes and subclasses is achieved via hierarchical decision/label tree structures.
Indoleamine 2,3 dioxygenase 1 (IDO1) is a metabolic enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of the essential amino acid tryptophan (Trp) into a series of immunoactive catabolites, collectively known as kynurenines. Through the depletion of Trp and the generation of kynurenines, IDO1 represents a key regulator of the immune responses involved in physiologic homeostasis as well as in neoplastic and autoimmune pathologies. The IDO1 enzyme has been described as an important immune checkpoint to be targeted by catalytic inhibitors in the treatment of cancer. In contrast, a defective expression/activity of the enzyme has been demonstrated in autoimmune diseases. Beside its catalytic activity, the IDO1 protein is endowed with an additional function associated with the presence of two immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs (ITIMs), which, once phosphorylated, bind SHP phosphatases and mediate a long-term immunoregulatory activity of IDO1. Herein, we report the screening of a focused library of molecules bearing a propanol core by a protocol combining microscale thermophoresis (MST) analysis and a cellular assay. As a result, the combined screening identified a 2-propanolol analogue, VIS351, as the first potent activator of the ITIM-mediated function of the IDO1 enzyme. VIS351 displayed a good dissociation constant (Kd = 1.90 μM) for IDO1 and a moderate cellular inhibitor activity (IC50 = 11.463 μM), although it did not show any catalytic inhibition of the recombinant IDO1 enzyme. Because we previously demonstrated that the enzymatic and non-enzymatic (i.e., ITIM-mediated) functions of IDO1 reside in different conformations of the protein, we hypothesized that in the cellular system VIS351 may shift the dynamic conformational balance towards the ITIM-favoring folding of IDO1, resulting in the activation of the signaling rather than catalytic activity of IDO1. We demonstrated that VIS351 activated the ITIM-mediated signaling of IDO1 also in mouse plasmacytoid dendritic cells, conferring those cells an immunosuppressive phenotype detectable in vivo. Thus the manuscript describes for the first time a small molecule as a positive modulator of IDO1 signaling function, paving the basis for an innovative approach to develop first-in-class drugs acting on the IDO1 target.
Streptococcus mitis is found in the oral cavity and nasopharynx and forms a significant portion of the human microbiome. In this study, in silico analyses indicated the presence of an Rgg regulator and short hydrophobic peptide (Rgg/SHP) cell-to-cell communication system in S. mitis Although Rgg presented greater similarity to a repressor in Streptococcus pyogenes, autoinducing assays and genetic mutation analysis revealed that in S. mitis Rgg acts as an activator. Transcriptome analysis showed that in addition to shp, the system regulates two other downstream genes, comprising a segment of a putative lantibiotic gene cluster that is in a conjugative element locus in different members of the mitis group. Close comparison to a similar lantibiotic gene cluster in Streptococcus pneumoniae indicated that S. mitis lacked the full set of genes. Despite the potential of SHP to trigger a futile cycle of autoinduction, growth was not significantly affected for the rgg mutant under normal or antibiotic stress conditions. The S. mitis SHP was, however, fully functional in promoting cross-species communication and increasing S. pneumoniae surface polysaccharide production, which in this species is regulated by Rgg/SHP. The activity of SHPs produced by both species was detected in cocultures using a S. mitis reporter strain. In competitive assays, a slight advantage was observed for the rgg mutants. We conclude that the Rgg/SHP system in S. mitis regulates the expression of its own shp and activates an Rgg/SHP system in S. pneumoniae that regulates surface polysaccharide synthesis. Fundamentally, cross-communication of such systems may have a role during multispecies interactions.IMPORTANCE Bacteria secrete signal molecules into the environment which are sensed by other cells when the density reaches a certain threshold. In this study, we describe a communication system in Streptococcus mitis, a commensal species from the oral cavity, which we also found in several species and strains of streptococci from the mitis group. Further, we show that this system can promote cross-communication with S. pneumoniae, a closely related major human pathogen. Importantly, we show that this cross-communication can take place during coculture. While the genes regulated in S. mitis are likely part of a futile cycle of activation, the target genes in S. pneumoniae are potentially involved in virulence. The understanding of such complex communication networks can provide important insights into the dynamics of bacterial communities.
Enhancement of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) proliferation is a central aim in bone marrow transplantation (BMT). A stem cell factor (SCF) and c-Kit mediated extracellular signaling trigger proliferation of HSCs. This signaling is negatively regulated by protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs), SHP-1 and SHP-2. Although NSC87877 (N) is known to inhibit SHP-1/SHP-2, c-Kit-mediated HSCs proliferation by inhibiting SHP-1/SHP-2 has not been reported. This study investigated the combined effect of SCF (S) and N in c-Kit mediated proliferation and underlying mechanisms. The growth of human megakaryoblastic cell line, MO7e and HSCs, upon treatment with S and N alone, and in combination was assessed by PrestoBlue staining. The expression of c-Kit, phosphorylated c-Kit, SHP-1/SHP-2 and HePTP inhibition using S and N treatment were evaluated in the MO7e cells. Megakaryoblast cell proliferation was determined by quantification of Ki-67+, S-phase, BrdU+ and CFDA-SE+ cells using flow cytometry. The combination of S and N leads to enhanced cell growth compared with either S or N alone. Collectively, the results reveal a novel mechanism by which S in combination with N significantly enhances proliferation of human megakaryoblast cells. The pretreatment of N before S enhances proliferation of cells than S alone. This promising combination would likely play an essential role in enhancing the proliferation of cells.
The enterohepatic circulation of bile acids (BAs) critically depends on BA transporters and enzymes, which can be affected by inflammatory bowel disease. Diarrhea in colitis is believed to result in part from BA malabsorption. The work aimed to investigate whether diarrhea in colitis was associated with the expression of BA transporters, enzymes, and nuclear receptors. RT-qPCR and Western blot techniques were used to evaluate the gene and protein levels of Cyp7a1, Asbt, SHP, FXR, Ostβ in a 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic-acid-induced rat model of colitis. The total BAs (TBAs) levels were assayed using ELISA kits, and the individual BAs were measured by LC-MS/MS. Results showed that the fecal excretions of TBAs were significantly increased by 1.6-fold in acute stage of colitis. In ileum, Asbt was significantly decreased; however, there was a compensatory increase in Cyp7a1 level in liver. Moreover, FXR has a decreased tendency and the downstream target gene SHP was downregulated. Contrary to acute stage, molecular changes were completely reversible during the remission phase. Our results indicated that the expression of Asbt and Cyp7a1 were altered in acute colitis, which performed vital roles in maintaining BA homeostasis. Early medical manipulation of BA transporters and enzymes may help prevent diarrhea.
The inhibitory leukocyte immunoglobulin-like receptors (LILRBs) play an important role in innate immunity. The present study represents the first description of the cloning and structural and functional analysis of LILRB1 and LILRB3 isolated from two genetically disparate chicken lines.
Chicken LILRB1-3 genes were identified by bioinformatics approach. Expression studies were performed by transfection, quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Signal transduction was analyzed by western blots, immunoprecipitation and flow cytometric. Cytokine levels were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.
Amino acid homology and phylogenetic analyses showed that the homologies of LILRB1 and LILRB3 in the chicken line 6.3 to those proteins in the chicken line 7.2 ranged between 97%-99%, while homologies between chicken and mammal proteins ranged between 13%-19%, and 13%-69%, respectively. Our findings indicate that LILRB1 and LILRB3 subdivided into two groups based on the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs (ITIM) present in the transmembrane domain. Chicken line 6.3 has two ITIM motifs of the sequence LxYxxL and SxYxxV while line 7.2 has two ITIM motifs of the sequences LxYxxL and LxYxxV. These motifs bind to SHP-2 (protein tyrosine phosphatase, non-receptor type 11) that plays a regulatory role in immune functions. Moreover, our data indicate that LILRB1 and LILRB3 associated with and activated major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I and β2-microglobulin and induced the expression of transporters associated with antigen processing, which are essential for MHC class I antigen presentation. This suggests that LILRB1 and LILRB3 are transcriptional regulators, modulating the expression of components in the MHC class I pathway and thereby regulating immune responses. Furthermore, LILRB1 and LILRB3 activated Janus kinase2/tyrosine kinase 2 (JAK2/TYK2); signal transducer and activator of transcription1/3 (STAT1/3), and suppressor of cytokine signaling 1 genes expressed in Macrophage (HD11) cells, which induced Th1, Th2, and Th17 cytokines.
These data indicate that LILRB1 and LILRB3 are innate immune receptors associated with SHP-2, MHC class I, β2-microglobulin, and they activate the Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription signaling pathway. Thus, our study provides novel insights into the regulation of immunity and immunopathology.
This study aims to describe the autonomic nervous network of the female pelvis with a 3D model and to provide a safe plane of dissection during radical hysterectomy for cervical cancer.
Pelvises of 3 human female fetuses were studied by using the computer-assisted anatomic dissection.
The superior hypogastric plexus (SHP) was located at the level of the aortic bifurcation in front of the sacral promontory and divided inferiorly and laterally into 2 hypogastric nerves (HN). HN ran postero-medially to the ureter and in the lateral part of the uterosacral ligament until the superior angle of the inferior hypogastric plexus (IHP). IHP extended from the anterolateral face of the rectum, laterally to the cervix and attempted to the base of the bladder. Vesical efferences merged from the crossing point of the ureter and the uterine artery and ran through the posterior layer of the vesico-uterine ligament.
The SHP could be injured during paraaortic lymphadenectomy. Following the ureter and resecting the medial fibrous part of the uterosacral ligament may spare the HN. No dissection should be performed under the crossing point of the ureter and the uterine artery.
The Src homology-2 domain-containing tyrosine phosphatase 2 (SHP-2) regulates many cellular processes, including proliferation, differentiation and survival. Polymorphisms in the gene encoding SHP-2 are associated with an increased susceptibility to develop ulcerative colitis. We recently reported that intestinal epithelial cell (IEC)-specific deletion of Shp-2 in mice (Shp-2IEC-KO ) leads to chronic colitis and colitis-associated cancer. This suggests that SHP-2-dependent signaling protects the colonic epithelium against inflammation and colitis-associated cancer development. To verify this hypothesis, we generated mice expressing the Shp-2 E76K activated form specifically in IEC. Our results showed that sustained Shp-2 activation in IEC increased intestine and crypt length, correlating with increased cell proliferation and migration. Crypt regeneration capacity was also markedly enhanced, as revealed by ex vivo organoid culture. Shp-2 activation alters the secretory cell lineage, as evidenced by increased goblet cell numbers and mucus secretion. Notably, these mice also demonstrated elevated ERK signaling in IEC and exhibited resistance against both chemical- and Citrobacter rodentium-induced colitis. In contrast, mice with IEC-specific Shp-2 deletion displayed reduced ERK signaling and rapidly developed chronic colitis. Remarkably, expression of an activated form of Braf in Shp-2-deficient mice restored ERK activation, goblet cell production and prevented colitis. Altogether, our results indicate that chronic activation of Shp-2/ERK signaling in the colonic epithelium confers resistance to mucosal erosion and colitis. © 2018 The Authors.

Activation of LCK is required for canonical TCR signaling leading to T cell responses. LCK activation also initiates a negative feedback loop mediated by the phosphatase SHP-1 that turns off TCR signaling. In this article, we report that the thousand-and-one amino acid kinase 3 (TAOK3) is a key regulator of this feedback. TAOK3 is a serine/threonine kinase expressed in many different cell types including T cells. TAOK3-deficient human T cells had impaired LCK-dependent TCR signaling resulting in a defect in IL-2 response to canonical TCR signaling but not to bacterial superantigens, which use an LCK-independent pathway. This impairment was associated with enhanced interaction of LCK with SHP-1 after TCR engagement and rapid termination of TCR signals, a defect corrected by TAOK3 reconstitution. Thus, TAOK3 is a positive regulator of TCR signaling by preventing premature SHP-1-mediated inactivation of LCK. This mechanism may also regulate signaling by other Src family kinase-dependent receptors.
Recently, we and others showed that the relative abundance of a specific vessel subtype, strongly positive for CD31 and Endomucin (CD31hiEmcnhi), is associated with bone formation and bone loss, and platelet-derived growth factor-BB (PDGF-BB) secreted by preosteoclasts induces the formation of the specific vessels and thereby stimulates osteogenesis. Inhibition of Src homology 2 domain-containing protein tyrosine phosphatase-2 (SHP-2) has been shown to block the fusion of preosteoclasts into mature osteoclasts. However, it is unclear whether inhibition of SHP-2 could promote preosteoclast-induced angiogenesis and then enhance bone formation. This study aimed to determine the effects of a specific SHP-2 inhibitor (NSC-87877) on CD31 hiEmcnhi vessel and bone formation.
3-month-old C57BL/6 mice were subjected to either ovariectomy (OVX) or sham operation. OVX mice were intraperitoneally injected with NSC-87877 and the control (sham) mice were treated with an equal volume of diluents (PBS). Two months later, bone samples from mice were collected for µCT, histological, immunohistochemical and immunofluorescent analyses to assess bone mass, osteogenic and osteoclastic acitivities, as well as the densities of CD31hiEmcnhi vessels. A series of angiogenesis- related assays were performed to test the effects of NSC-87877 on the pro-angiogenic activities of preosteoclasts in vitro.
We found that NSC-87877 is sufficient to induce bone-sparing effects in OVX-induced osteoporotic mouse model. We also found that NSC-87877 induces higher numbers of preosteoclasts and CD31hiEmcnhi vessels and higher levels of PDGF-BB in bone marrow of osteoporotic mice. In vitro assays showed that NSC-87877 prevents preosteoclast fusion, increases PDGF-BB production, and augments the pro-angiogenic abilities of preosteoclasts.
Our results suggest that NSC-87877 can be used as a promising therapeutic agent for osteoporosis by inhibiting osteoclast formation and promoting preosteoclast-induced angiogenesis.
Cholestasis is one of the most challenging diseases to be treated in current hepatology. However little is known about the adaptation difference and the underlying mechanism between acute and chronic cholestasis. In this study, wild-type and Pparα-null mice were orally administered diet containing 0.05% ANIT to induce chronic cholestasis. Biochemistry, histopathology and serum metabolome analysis exhibited the similar toxic phenotype between wild-type and Pparα-null mice. Bile acid metabolism was strongly adapted in Pparα-null mice but not in wild-type mice. The Shp and Fxr mRNA was found to be doubled in cholestatic Pparα-null mice compared with the control group. Western blot confirmed the up-regulated expression of FXR in Pparα-null mice treated with ANIT. Inflammation was found to be stronger in Pparα-null mice than those in wild-type mice in chronic cholestasis. These data chain indicated that bile acid metabolism and inflammation signaling were different between wild-type and Pparα-null mice developing chronic cholestasis, although their toxic phenotypes could not be discriminated. So basal PPARα cross-talked with FXR and inhibited bile acid metabolism adaptation in chronic cholestasis.
Our group has previously reported a series of isoflavone derivatives with antidyslipidemic activity. With this background, a series of isoflavone analogs of GW4064 were designed, synthesized and evaluated the lipid-lowering activity of analogs. As a result, most of compounds significantly reduced the lipid accumulation in 3T3-L1 adipocytes and four of them (10a, 11, 15c and 15d) showed stronger inhibitory than GW4064. The most potent compound 15d exhibited promising agonistic activity for FXR in a cell-based luciferase reporter assay. Meanwhile, 15d up-regulated FXR, SHP and BSEP gene expression and down-regulated the mRNA expression of lipogenesis gene SREBP-1c. Besides, an improved safety profile of 15d was also observed in a HepG2 cytotoxicity assay compared with GW4064. The obtained biological results were further confirmed by a molecular docking study showing that 15d fitted well in the binding pocket of FXR and interacted with some key residues simultaneously.
Host injury triggers feedback mechanisms that limit tissue damage. Conventional type 1 dendritic cells (cDC1s) express dendritic cell natural killer lectin group receptor-1 (DNGR-1), encoded by the gene Clec9a, which senses tissue damage and favors cross-presentation of dead-cell material to CD8+ T cells. Here we find that DNGR-1 additionally reduces host-damaging inflammatory responses induced by sterile and infectious tissue injury in mice. DNGR-1 deficiency leads to exacerbated caerulein-induced necrotizing pancreatitis and increased pathology during systemic Candida albicans infection without affecting fungal burden. This effect is B and T cell-independent and attributable to increased neutrophilia in DNGR-1-deficient settings. Mechanistically, DNGR-1 engagement activates SHP-1 and inhibits MIP-2 (encoded by Cxcl2) production by cDC1s during Candida infection. This consequently restrains neutrophil recruitment and promotes disease tolerance. Thus, DNGR-1-mediated sensing of injury by cDC1s serves as a rheostat for the control of tissue damage, innate immunity, and immunopathology.
B cells express various inhibitory co-receptors including CD22, CD72, and Siglec-G. These receptors contain immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibition motifs (ITIMs) in the cytoplasmic region. Although many of the inhibitory co-receptors negatively regulate BCR signaling by activating SH2-containing protein tyrosine phosphatase 1 (SHP-1), different inhibitory co-receptors have distinct functional properties. CD22, Siglec-G, and CD72 preferentially regulate tonic signaling in conventional B cells, B-1 cell homeostasis, and development of lupus-like disease, respectively. CD72 recognizes RNA-related lupus self-antigen Sm/RNP as a ligand. This ligand recognition recruits CD72 to BCR in Sm/RNP-reactive B cells thereby suppressing production of anti-Sm/RNP autoantibody involved in the pathogenesis of lupus. In contrast, Siglec-G recognizes α2,3 as well as α2,6 sialic acids whereas CD22 recognizes α2,6 sialic acid alone. Because glycoproteins including BCR are dominantly glycosylated with α2,3 sialic acids in B-1 cells, Siglec-G but not CD22 recruits BCR as a ligand specifically in B-1 cells, and regulates B-1 cell homeostasis by suppressing BCR signaling in B-1 cells. Thus, recognition of distinct ligands determines functional properties of different inhibitory B cell co-receptors.
Immune checkpoint blockade therapy has been successful in treating some types of cancer but has not shown clinical benefits for treating leukaemia1. This result suggests that leukaemia uses unique mechanisms to evade this therapy. Certain immune inhibitory receptors that are expressed by normal immune cells are also present on leukaemia cells. Whether these receptors can initiate immune-related primary signalling in tumour cells remains unknown. Here we use mouse models and human cells to show that LILRB4, an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibition motif-containing receptor and a marker of monocytic leukaemia, supports tumour cell infiltration into tissues and suppresses T cell activity via a signalling pathway that involves APOE, LILRB4, SHP-2, uPAR and ARG1 in acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) cells. Deletion of LILRB4 or the use of antibodies to block LILRB4 signalling impeded AML development. Thus, LILRB4 orchestrates tumour invasion pathways in monocytic leukaemia cells by creating an immunosuppressive microenvironment. LILRB4 represents a compelling target for the treatment of monocytic AML.
RNF6, an E3 ligase, has been reported to play an important role in the tumorigenesis in several tissues, but its role in gastric cancer is still unknown. In this study, we aimed to investigate the biological function and molecular mechanisms of RNF6 in gastric cancer.
The expression levels of RNF6 were detected by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) and immunoblotting in gastric cancer tissues and cell lines. Cell Counting Kit-8 assay was performed to evaluate cell proliferation. Cell apoptosis was analyzed by flow cytometer and immunoblotting. Luciferase assay, immunoblotting and qRT-PCR were performed to explore the activation of STAT3. Immunoprecipitation was performed to evaluate the ubiquitination of SHP-1.
In this study, RNF6 was found to be upregulated in both primary tissues and cell lines of gastric cancer. Knockdown or overexpression of RNF6 inhibited or promoted cell growth of gastric cancer cells. Knockdown of RNF6 also induced the cleavage of PARP and promoted cell apoptosis in gastric cancer cells. In addition, knockdown of RNF6 also increased the cytotoxicity of doxorubicin against gastric cancer. Moreover, knockdown of RNF6 inhibited STAT3-derived luciferase activity and downregulated the phosphorylation of STAT3, but upregulated the protein level of SHP-1. Knockdown of RNF6 downregulated the expression of MCL1 and XIAP, which are target genes of STAT3. Further studies showed that RNF6 regulated the stability of SHP-1 by inducing its polyubiquitination.
These results demonstrated that RNF6 was highly expressed in gastric cancer and regulated the growth of gastric cancer cells by affecting SHP-1/STAT3 signaling, which suggested that RNF6 could be a novel target for gastric cancer therapy.
Recently, we reported that orphan nuclear receptor small heterodimer partner (SHP) is involved in neutrophil recruitment through the regulation of C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 2 (CXCL2) expression in a concanavalin A (ConA)-induced hepatitis model. In the present study, we examined the mechanisms underlying CXCL2 regulation by SHP and the cell types involved in liver inflammation. To this end, either Shp knockout (KO) or wild-type (WT) bone marrow cells were transferred into sublethally-irradiated WT (KO → WT or WT → WT) or Shp KO (KO → KO or WT → KO) recipients, followed by intravenous injection of ConA (20-30 mg/kg) 8 weeks later. The KO recipient groups showed higher ConA-induced lethality than the WT recipient groups. Accordingly, plasma alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels, and inflammatory cytokine expressions were significantly higher in the KO recipients than in the WT recipients regardless of donor genotype. Massively increased hepatocyte death in KO recipients, as determined by H&amp;E and TUNEL staining, was observed after ConA challenge. Bone marrow chimera experiments and in vitro chemotaxis assay also showed that SHP-deficient hepatocytes have an enhanced ability to recruit neutrophils to the injured liver. In vitro promoter assays showed that SHP is a negative regulator of Cxcl2 transcription by interfering with c-Jun binding to the AP-1 site within the Cxcl2 promoter. Collectively, SHP regulates Cxcl2 transcription in hepatocytes, playing a pivotal role in the recruitment of neutrophils. SHP-targeting strategies may represent alternative approaches to control fulminant hepatitis.
Roughly one quarter of active upper limb prosthetic technology is rejected by the user, and user surveys have identified key areas requiring improvement: function, comfort, cost, durability, and appearance. Here we present the first systematic, clinical assessment of a novel prosthetic hand, the SoftHand Pro (SHP), in participants with transradial amputation and age-matched, limb-intact participants. The SHP is a robust and functional prosthetic hand that minimizes cost and weight using an underactuated design with a single motor. Participants with limb loss were evaluated on functional clinical measures before and after a 6-8 hour training period with the SHP as well as with their own prosthesis; limb-intact participants were tested only before and after SHP training. Participants with limb loss also evaluated their own prosthesis and the SHP (following training) using subjective questionnaires. Both objective and subjective results were positive and illuminated the strengths and weaknesses of the SHP. In particular, results pre-training show the SHP is easy to use, and significant improvement in the Activities Measure for Upper Limb Amputees in both groups following a 6-8 hour training highlights the ease of learning the unique features of the SHP (median improvement: 4.71 and 3.26 and p = 0.009 and 0.036 for limb loss and limb-intact groups, respectively). Further, we found no difference in performance compared to participant's own commercial devices in several clinical measures and found performance surpassing these devices on two functional tasks, buttoning a shirt and using a cell phone, suggesting a functional prosthetic design. Finally, improvements are needed in the SHP design and/or training in light of poor results in small object manipulation. Taken together, these results show the promise of the SHP, a flexible and adaptive prosthetic hand, and pave a path forward to ensuring higher functionality in future.
Deinococcus radiodurans R1 (DR) survives conditions of extreme desiccation, irradiation and exposure to genotoxic chemicals, due to efficient DNA breaks repair, also through Mn2+ protection of DNA repair enzymes.
Possible annotated domains of the DR1533 locus protein (Shp) were searched by bioinformatic analysis. The gene was cloned and expressed as fusion protein. Band-shift assays of Shp or the SRA and HNH domains were performed on oligonucleotides, genomic DNA from E. coli and DR. shp knock-out mutant was generated by homologous recombination with a kanamycin resistance cassette.
DR1533 contains an N-terminal SRA domain and a C-terminal HNH motif (SRA-HNH Protein, Shp). Through its SRA domain, Shp binds double-strand oligonucleotides containing 5mC and 5hmC, but also unmethylated and mismatched cytosines in presence of Mn2+. Shp also binds to Escherichia coli dcm+ genomic DNA, and to cytosine unmethylated DR and E. coli dcm- genomic DNAs, but only in presence of Mn2+. Under these binding conditions, Shp displays DNAse activity through its HNH domain. Shp KO enhanced &gt;100 fold the number of spontaneous mutants, whilst the treatment with DNA double strand break inducing agents enhanced up to 3-log the number of survivors.
The SRA-HNH containing protein Shp binds to and cuts 5mC DNA, and unmethylated DNA in a Mn2+ dependent manner, and might be involved in faithful genome inheritance maintenance following DNA damage.
Our results provide evidence for a potential role of DR Shp protein for genome integrity maintenance, following DNA double strand breaks induced by genotoxic agents.
The biological mechanisms underlying the effects of stem cell factor (SCF) and an inhibitor, NSC87877 (N) of the c-Kit negative regulator (SHP-1 and SHP-2) on cell proliferation are different. Therefore, we compared the cell's response to these two either alone or in combination in K562 cells. Binding of SCF (S) to c-Kit induces dimerization that activates its kinase activity. The activated c-Kit undergoes autophosphorylation at tyrosine residues that serve as a docking site for signal transduction molecules containing SH2 domains. Predominantly, the phosphotyrosine 568 (pY568) in Juxtamembrane (JM) region of c-Kit interacts with adaptor protein APS, Src family kinase, and SHP-2, while phosphotyrosine 570 (pY570) interacts with the SHP-1 and the adaptor protein Shc. The dephosphorylation of phosphotyrosine residues by SHP-1/SHP-2 leads to inhibition of c-Kit proliferative signaling. A chemical molecule, N is reported to inhibit the enzymatic activity of SHP-1/SHP-2, but its effect on c-Kit-mediated proliferation has not been studied yet. Thus, this work aims at examining the effect of the combination of S and N on cells growth as compared to individual treatment. The present study is performed with erythroleukemic K562 cells, chosen for its mRNA expression concerning the c-Kit, and SHP-1/SHP-2. Interestingly, proliferation assay showed that combination significantly increased proliferation when G1 sorted K562 cells were used. These changes were significantly higher when K562 cells were initially treated with N followed by S treatment. Collectively, these results give mechanistic insight into the proliferation enhancement of bone marrow transplantation through the synergistic effect of S and N by inhibiting SHP-1/SHP-2. The study gives solid evidence that S and N combination can be used to enhance cell proliferation/growth.
Aerobic exercise training may improve cognitive performance among persons with multiple sclerosis (MS). This is largely based on evidence that cardiorespiratory fitness (as a cross-sectional surrogate for aerobic exercise training) is associated with cognitive processing speed. There may be a set of "other" variables (i.e., psychological symptoms) that influences the association between cardiorespiratory fitness and cognitive processing speed in MS, and such factors should be accounted for when designing optimized exercise rehabilitation interventions.
The primary objective of the present study involved examining psychological symptoms of anxiety, depression, pain, and fatigue as possible mediators, moderators, or confounders of the association between cardiorespiratory fitness and cognitive processing speed. Sixty-two persons across the MS disability spectrum completed anxiety, depression, pain, and fatigue questionnaires; underwent Symbol Digit Modalities Test administration; as well as two separate incremental exercise tests to exhaustion for measurement of psychological symptoms, cognitive processing speed, and cardiorespiratory fitness, respectively.
Depressive symptoms, pain, and fatigue were significantly and jointly associated with cardiorespiratory fitness and cognitive processing speed (p &lt; .05) based on bivariate correlation analyses. Despite those associations, hierarchical linear regression, bivariate correlation, and partial correlation analyses indicated that those psychological symptoms were not mediators, moderators, or confounders of the cardiorespiratory fitness/cognitive processing speed relationship, respectively.
The present pattern of results suggests that aerobic exercise training (via improving cardiorespiratory fitness) might improve cognitive processing speed independent of the influence of depression, pain, and fatigue. Such results further suggest that having elevated depressive symptoms or severe MS-related fatigue might not affect aerobic exercise training-related changes in cognitive processing speed, and that psychological symptoms might not distort the association between aerobic exercise training and changes in cognitive processing speed.
BCR-ABL kinase mutations, accounting for clinical resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) such as imatinib, frequently occur in acquired resistance or in advanced phases of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Emerging evidence implicates a critical role for non-mutational drug resistance mechanisms underlying the survival of residual cancer 'persister' cells. Here, we utilized non-mutational imatinib-resistant K562/G cells to reveal SHP-2 as a resistance modulator of imatinib treatment response during the early phase. SHP-2 phosphorylation was significantly higher in K562/G cells than in sensitive K562 cells. In K562 cells, both short-term and long-term exposure to imatinib induced SHP-2 phosphorylation. Consistently, gain- and loss-of-function mutants in SHP-2 proved its regulation of imatinib resistance. SHP-2 inhibitor and imatinib exhibited a strong antitumor synergy in in vitro and in vivo K562/G models. Mechanistically, dual SHP-2 and BCR-ABL inhibition blocked RAF/MEK/ERK and PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathways, respectively, leading to dramatic apoptotic death of K562/G cells. In conclusion, our results highlight that SHP-2 could be exploited as a biomarker and therapeutic target during the early phase of imatinib resistance development in CML.
Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a major cardiovascular risk factor contributing to cardiovascular complications by inducing vascular cell dysfunction. Monocyte dysfunction could contribute to impaired arteriogenesis response in DM patients. DM monocytes show blunted chemotactic responses to arteriogenic stimuli, a condition termed as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) resistance. We hypothesize that methylglyoxal (MG), a glucose metabolite, induces monocyte dysfunction and aimed to elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms. Human monocytes exposed to MG or monocytes from DM patients or mice (db/db) showed VEGF-resistance secondary to a pro-migratory phenotype. Mechanistically, DM conditions or MG exposure resulted in the upregulation of the expression of SHP-2 phosphatase. This led to the enhanced activity of SHP-2 and aided an interaction with SRC kinase. SHP-2 dephosphorylated the inhibitory phosphorylation site of SRC leading to its abnormal activation and phosphorylation of cytoskeletal protein, paxillin. We demonstrated that MG-induced molecular changes could be reversed by pharmacological inhibitors of SHP-2 and SRC and by genetic depletion of SHP-2. Finally, a SHP-2 inhibitor completely reversed the dysfunction of monocytes isolated from DM patients and db/db mice. In conclusion, we identified SHP-2 as a hitherto unknown target for improving monocyte function in diabetes. This opens novel perspectives for treating diabetic complications associated with impaired monocyte function.
Adult T-cell leukemia-lymphoma (ATL) is an aggressive disease which is highly resistant to chemotherapy. Studies show that enhanced ability of DNA damage repair (DDR) in cancer cells plays a key role in chemotherapy resistance. Here, we suggest that defect in DDR related genes might be a promising target to destroy the genome stability of tumor cells.
Since KU70 is highly expressed in Jurkat cells, one of the most representative cell lines of ATL, we knocked down KU70 by shRNA and analyzed the impact of KU70 deficiency in Jurkat cells as well as in NOD-SCID animal models by western blot, immunofluorescence, flow cytometry and measuring DNA repair efficiency.
It is observed that silencing of KU70 resulted in accumulated DNA damage and impaired DDR in Jurkat cells, resulting in more apoptosis, decreased cell proliferation and cell cycle arrest. DNA damage leads to DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), which are processed by either non-homologous end joining(NHEJ) or homologous recombination(HR). In our study, both NHEJ and HR are impaired because of KU70 defect, accompanied with increased protein level of SHP-1, a dephosphorylation enzyme. In turn, SHP-1 led to dephosphorylation of SIRT1, which further impaired HR repair efficiency. Moreover, KU70 deficiency prolonged survival of Jurkat-xenografted mice.
These findings suggest that targeting KU70 is a promising target for ATL and might overcome the existing difficulties in chemotherapy.
The unregulated activation of STAT3 has been demonstrated to occur in many cancers and enhances tumour growth, migration, and invasion. Stimulation by cytokines, growth factors, and hormones triggers this activation by phosphorylating STAT3 at tyrosine 705. Novel imidazopyridine compounds were synthesized to evaluate the inhibition of STAT3 at Y705. Among the tested compounds, 16 reduced the level of phospho-STAT3, inhibited the downstream signalling cascade and subsequently attenuated the survival of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells. Further assays showed that the reduction effects of compound 16 on tyrosine 705 of STAT3 were attributed to up-regulation of protein tyrosine phosphatase SHP-1.
Leishmania mexicana is an intracellular parasite that causes cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) in some countries, including Mexico. Recently, we identified the elongation factor-1α (EF-1α) of L. mexicana by immunoproteomic analysis. In Leishmania donovani, this molecule has been reported as a virulence factor involved in downregulation of macrophages by no-canonical function when EF-1α interacts with protein tyrosine phosphatase-1 (SHP-1). However, in L. mexicana the key role of EF-1α in host-parasite relationship has not been elucidated, by this reason we started with cloning and recombinant expression of this antigen. A sequence of 1350 bp corresponding to EF-1α (EF-Lm) full-length gene was amplified from genomic DNA of L. mexicana (GenBank: MG256973); this gene contains only one nucleotide change: C464T, compared with L. mexicana reference sequence (GenBank: FR799570.1). The gene cloned (EF-Lm) codes for a protein of 449 residues. It was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified as 63 kDa sumo-fusion protein, which was recognized in the sera of patients diagnosed with CL. Our results show that EF-Lm is immunogenic during infection, and the rEF-Lm could be used for further analyses in the host-parasite relationship.
Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDSs) are clonal hematopoietic stem cell disorders characterized by ineffective hematopoiesis. Anemia is the defining cytopenia of MDS patients, yet the molecular mechanisms for dyserythropoiesis in MDSs remain to be fully defined. Recent studies have revealed that heterozygous loss-of-function mutation of DNA dioxygenase TET2 is 1 of the most common mutations in MDSs and that TET2 deficiency disturbs erythroid differentiation. However, mechanistic insights into the role of TET2 on disordered erythropoiesis are not fully defined. Here, we show that TET2 deficiency leads initially to stem cell factor (SCF)-dependent hyperproliferation and impaired differentiation of human colony-forming unit-erythroid (CFU-E) cells, which were reversed by a c-Kit inhibitor. We further show that this was due to increased phosphorylation of c-Kit accompanied by decreased expression of phosphatase SHP-1, a negative regulator of c-Kit. At later stages, TET2 deficiency led to an accumulation of a progenitor population, which expressed surface markers characteristic of normal CFU-E cells but were functionally different. In contrast to normal CFU-E cells that require only erythropoietin (EPO) for proliferation, these abnormal progenitors required SCF and EPO and exhibited impaired differentiation. We termed this population of progenitors "marker CFU-E" cells. We further show that AXL expression was increased in marker CFU-E cells and that the increased AXL expression led to increased activation of AKT and ERK. Moreover, the altered proliferation and differentiation of marker CFU-E cells were partially rescued by an AXL inhibitor. Our findings document an important role for TET2 in erythropoiesis and have uncovered previously unknown mechanisms by which deficiency of TET2 contributes to ineffective erythropoiesis.
A heteropolysaccharide (SHP) with a strong immunomodulatory effect on RAW 264.7 cells was prepared from Saccharina japonica. Chemical analysis demonstrated that SHP was primarily composed of mannose, glucuronic acid, glucose, fucose, galactose, xylose and rahmnose with a molar ratio of 1.00:0.85:0.84:0.58:0.30:0.37:0.15. ESI-MS showed that depolymerized SHP produced oligo-glucuronan, oligo-glucuronomannan, sulfated fuco-oligosaccharides and other hetero-oligosaccharides. The in vitro immunomodulatory results showed that SHP could increase NO production and up-regulate the expression of many immune effectors, including iNOS, COX-2 and TNF-α, displaying an apparent immune enhancement activities. Western blot analysis proved that SHP activated the expression levels of many key components involved in NF-κB, MAPK and Akt signaling pathways. Our results together indicated that SHP has the potential to be developed as a novel immunomodulator for activating immune system.
In this study, a simple and efficient diagnostic system, which adopts a novel methodology consisting of principal component analysis (PCA)-based feature generation and ellipse models-based classification criterion, is proposed for the diagnosis of a ventricular septal defect (VSD). The three stages corresponding to the diagnostic system implementation are summarized as follows. In stage 1, the heart sound is collected by 3M-3200 electronic stethoscope and is preprocessed using the wavelet decomposition. In stage 2, the PCA-based diagnostic features, [[Formula: see text]], are generated from time-frequency feature matrix ([Formula: see text]). In the matrix TFFM, the time domain features [Formula: see text] are firstly extracted from the time domain envelope [Formula: see text] for the filtered heart sound signal [Formula: see text], and frequency domain features, [Formula: see text], are subsequently extracted from a frequency domain envelope ([Formula: see text]) for each heart sound cycle automatically segmented via the short time modified Hilbert transform (STMHT). In stage 3, support vector machines-based classification boundary curves for the dataset [Formula: see text] are first generated, and least-squares-based ellipse models are subsequently built for the classification boundary curve. Finally, based on the ellipse models, the classification criterion is defined for the diagnosis of VSD sounds. The proposed diagnostic system is validated by sounds from the internet and by sounds from clinical heart diseases. Moreover, comparative analysis to validate the usefulness of the proposed diagnostic system, mitral regurgitation and aortic stenosis sounds are used as examples for detection. As a result, the higher classification accuracy, which is achieved by this study compared to the other methods, is [Formula: see text], [Formula: see text], [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text] for diagnosing small VSD, moderate VSD, large VSD and normal sounds, respectively.
The integration of interprofessional education (IPE) into health professional curricula is critical to ensuring safe and efficient delivery of patient care. The intent of this manuscript is to describe the results of a pilot study designed to evaluate the impact of a large-scale interprofessional medication error prevention workshop on student perceptions of team-based patient care in the prevention of medication errors.
Pharmacy, medical, and physician assistant students' perceptions of the role of multidisciplinary patient care teams in preventing medication errors were evaluated before and after participating in a three-hour interprofessional medication errors prevention workshop utilizing a modified version of the validated Attitudes Towards Health Care Teams Scale.
When comparing student attitudes among the three schools, statistically significant differences in student perceptions across the items and subscales (e.g., quality of care/process and physician centrality) captured in the instrument utilized were identified. Additionally, differences in the responses of pharmacy, medical, and physician-assistant students were found, highlighting the areas where healthcare education can be targeted to bridge the gap in opinion.
We demonstrated an overall positive impact of an interprofessional medication errors prevention-themed workshop on the attitudes of the participating healthcare students. Future directions and research initiatives focusing on the role of IPE and the influence of IPE workshops on team-based performance are indicated to validate the influence of this method of education on the attitudes of post-graduate healthcare trainees and healthcare practitioners.
Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy has shown promise for relapsed/refractory malignancies. Many patients have undergone prior hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT), yet effects of transplant status on CAR T-cell therapy efficacy and safety have not been reported. The purpose of the study is to systematically evaluate the likelihood of achieving optimum response, severe cytokine release syndrome (sCRS), and neurotoxicity in the context of CAR T-cell therapy for HSCT-naïve patients versus those with prior HSCT. Trials were identified in ClinicalTrials.gov, Cochrane Library, and PubMed, and through reference pearl growing. Included studies used CD19-directed CAR T-cells for relapsed/refractory B-lineage Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia and B cell Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia, enrolled both HSCT-naïve and prior-HSCT patients, and denoted transplant status with outcomes. Six studies were included for optimum response, five for sCRS incidence, and four for neurotoxicity incidence. The pooled odds ratio for optimum response was 1.57 favoring HSCT-naïve patients (95% CI 0.54-4.61), whereas the pooled odds ratios for sCRS and neurotoxicity were 1.41 (95% CI 0.51-3.94) and 1.37 (95% CI 0.28-6.77), respectively, toward HSCT-naïve patients. Odds ratios were non-statistically significant. Overall risk of bias was moderate. While pooled estimates showed an advantage among HSCT-naïve patients for achieving optimum response and increased likelihood for sCRS and neurotoxicity, findings were not statistically significant. Any differences in efficacy and safety of CAR T-cell therapy cannot be verifiably attributed to transplant status, and additional controlled trials with increased sample sizes are needed to determine whether suggestive patterns favoring HSCT-naïve patients are validated.
We investigated the inhibitory effect of pantoprazole on signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) activity and invasiveness of gastric adenocarcinoma cells, and the role of SH2-containing protein tyrosine phosphatase 1 (SHP-1) in mediating role.
We used AGS and MKN-28 cells because of reduced SHP-1 and preserved p-STAT3 expression. Western blot, wound closure assay, Matrigel invasion assay and 3-D culture invasion assay were performed. Pharmacologic inhibitor of SHP-1 and siRNA were used for validation of the role of SHP-1.
We observed that pantoprazole at 40, 80, and 160 μg/ml upregulated SHP-1 and downregulated p-STAT3 expression in a dose-dependent manner in AGS and MKN-28 cells. Furthermore, pantoprazole significantly downregulated mesenchymal markers (Snail1 and vimentin), upregulated epithelial marker (E-cadherin), and inhibited migration and invasion of AGS and MKN-28 cells. To validate the role of SHP-1 in inhibition of STAT3 activity by pantoprazole in gastric cancer cells, we performed pharmacologic inhibition (pervanadate) or knockdown of SHP-1 before pantoprazole treatment, which significantly attenuated the suppression of p-STAT3 and anti-migration and invasion effect by pantoprazole in AGS cells. In xenograft tumor model, tumor volume was significantly reduced by intraperitoneal injection of pantoprazole, with upregulation of SHP-1 and downregulation of p-STAT3, which were attenuated by concomitant injection of pervanadate.
Our data suggest that the inhibitory effect of pantoprazole on cellular migration and invasion might be through inducing SHP-1 in gastric cancer cells.
Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a lethal, muscle degenerative disease causing premature death of affected children. DMD is characterized by mutations in the dystrophin gene that result in a loss of the dystrophin protein. Loss of dystrophin causes an associated reduction in proteins of the dystrophin glycoprotein complex (DGC), leading to contraction-induced sarcolemmal weakening, muscle tearing, fibrotic infiltration and rounds of degeneration and failed regeneration affecting satellite cell populations. The α7β1 integrin has been implicated in increasing myogenic capacity of satellite cells therefore restoring muscle viability, increasing muscle force and preserving muscle function in dystrophic mouse models. In this study, we show that an FDA-approved small molecule, Sunitinib, is a potent α7 integrin enhancer capable of promoting myogenic regeneration by stimulating satellite cell activation and increasing myofiber fusion. Sunitinib exerts its regenerative effects via transient inhibition of SHP-2 and subsequent activation of the STAT3 pathway. Treatment of mdx mice with Sunitinib demonstrated decreased membrane leakiness and damage owing to myofiber regeneration and enhanced support at the extracellular matrix. The decreased myofiber damage translated into a significant increase in muscle force production. This study identifies an already FDA approved compound, Sunitinib, as a possible DMD therapeutic with the potential to treat other muscular dystrophies in which there is defective muscle repair.
Recent studies have investigated the roles of FXR deficiency in the pathogenesis of alcoholic liver disease (ALD). However, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, FXR knockout (FXR-/-) and wild-type (WT) mice were subjected to chronic-plus-binge alcohol feeding to study the effect of FXR deficiency on ALD development. The degree of liver injury was greater in FXR-/- mice compared to WT mice. Ethanol feeding enhanced hepatic steatosis in FXR-/- mice, accompanied by decreased mRNA levels of Pparα and Srebp-1c. The expression of Lcn2 was increased by ethanol treatment, despite unchanged expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines Tnfα, Il6 and Il-1β. Furthermore, ethanol treatment altered bile acid (BA) homeostasis to a greater extent in FXR-/- mice, as well as serum and hepatic BA pool composition. The mRNA levels of hepatic Cyp7a1 and Shp, as well as intestinal Fgf15, were decreased in WT mice with ethanol feeding, which were further reduced in FXR-/- mice. Levels of both primary and secondary BAs were markedly elevated in FXR-/- mice, which were further increased after ethanol treatment. Moreover, hepatic MAPK signaling pathways were disturbed presumably by increased hepatic BA levels. In summary, FXR deficiency increased hepatic steatosis and altered BA pool composition, contributing to worsened liver toxicity.
We examined the accuracy of the Heat Strain Decision Aid (HSDA) as a predictor of core body temperature in healthy individuals wearing chemical protective clothing during laboratory and field exercises in hot and humid conditions.
The laboratory experiment examined three chemical protective clothing ensembles in eight male volunteers (age 24 ± 6 years; height 178 ± 5 cm; body mass 76.6 ± 8.4 kg) during intermittent treadmill marching in an environmental chamber (air temperature 29.3 ± 0.1 °C; relative humidity 56 ± 1%; wind speed 0.4 ± 0.1 m s-1). The field experiment examined four different chemical protective clothing ensembles in twenty activity military volunteers (26 ± 5 years; 175 ± 8 cm; 80.2 ± 12.1 kg) during a prolonged road march (26.0 ± 0.5 °C; 55 ± 3%; 4.3 ± 0.7 m s-1). Predictive accuracy and precision were evaluated by the bias, mean absolute error (MAE), and root mean square error (RMSE). Additionally, accuracy was evaluated using a prediction bias of ±0.27 °C as an acceptable limit and by comparing predictions to observations within the standard deviation (SD) of the observed data.
Core body temperature predictions were accurate for each chemical protective clothing ensemble in laboratory (Bias -0.10 ± 0.36 °C; MAE 0.28 ± 0.24 °C; RMSE 0.37 ± 0.24 °C) and field experiments (Bias 0.23 ± 0.32 °C; MAE 0.30 ± 0.25 °C; RMSE 0.40 ± 0.25 °C). From all modeled data, 72% of all predictions were within one standard deviation of the observed data including 92% of predictions for the laboratory experiment (SD ± 0.64 °C) and 67% for the field experiment (SD ± 0.38 °C). Individual-based predictions showed modest errors outside the SD range with 98% of predictions falling &lt;1 °C; while, 81% of all errors were within 0.5 °C of observed data.
The HSDA acceptably predicts core body temperature when wearing chemical protective clothing during laboratory and field exercises in hot and humid conditions.
Patient-reported outcomes (PROs) are used to measure patients' experience with their disease. However, there are few PRO data from patients with NASH. We collected data from the STELLAR clinical trials to assess PROs for NASH and advanced fibrosis.
We analyzed data from 1667 patients (58 ± 9 years, 40% male, 52% with cirrhosis, 74% with diabetes) with NASH and bridging fibrosis or compensated cirrhosis (metavir scores, F3 or F4) enrolled in the phase 3 STELLAR trials of selonsertib (NCT03053050 and NCT03053063) who completed PRO questionnaires (SF-36, CLDQ-NASH, EQ-5D, or WPAI:SHP) before treatment initiation.
Compared with patients with F3 fibrosis, higher proportions of patients with F4 fibrosis were female, were white, had more hematologic and gastrointestinal comorbidities, and had type 2 diabetes (P ≤ .01). Mean physical health-related PRO scores were significantly lower than those of the general population: patients with F4 fibrosis had score reductions of 4.4% to 12.9% in 6/8 SF-36 domains and patients with F3 fibrosis had score reductions of 3.9% to 11.7% in 4/8 domains (P &lt; .01). Compared to patients with F3 fibrosis, those with F4 fibrosis had lower scores in all but 1 domains of CLDQ-NASH, Role Physical, Bodily Pain, and Social Functioning domains of the SF-36, and EQ-5D (P ≤ 01). In multivariate regression analysis, factors independently associated with lower PRO scores included having cirrhosis, female sex, higher body mass index, history of smoking, and diabetes or other comorbidities (P &lt; .01).
PROs are significantly lower in patients with NASH with advanced fibrosis who participated in the STELLAR clinical trials. Treatment of patients with NASH should focus on improving not only clinical outcomes but also quantifiable symptom burden and health-related quality of life.
The farnesoid X receptor (FXR) belongs to the nuclear receptor family and is activated by bile acids. Multiple, chemically rather diverse, FXR agonists have been developed and several of these compounds are currently tested in clinical trials for NAFLD and cholestasis. Here, we investigated possible FXR-agonism or antagonism of existing FDA/EMA-approved drugs. By using our recently developed FRET-sensor, containing the ligand binding domain of FXR (FXR-LBD), 1280 FDA-approved drugs were screened for their ability to activate FXR in living cells using flow cytometry. Fifteen compounds induced the sensor for more than twenty percent above background. Real-time confocal microscopy confirmed that avermectin B1a, gliquidone, nicardipine, bepridil and triclosan activated the FRET sensor within two minutes. These compounds, including fluticasone, increased mRNA expression of FXR target genes OSTα and OSTβ in Huh7 cells, and in most cases also of MRP2, SHP and FGF19. Finally, avermectin B1a, gliquidone, nicardipine and bepridil significantly increased IBABP promoter activity in a luciferase reporter assay in a dose-dependent manner. In conclusion, six FDA/EMA-approved drugs currently used in the clinical practice exhibit moderate agonistic FXR activity. This may on the one hand explain (undesired) side-effects, but on the other hand may form an opportunity for polypharmacology.
KIR3DL1 is an inhibitory killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR) that negatively regulates natural killer cell cytotoxicity. The KIR3DL1 cytoplasmic region (3DL1-cyto) is disordered and can be dissected into three segments: (I) H340-V351; (II) M352-D371; and (III) P372-P423. NMR studies indicate that segment II can dynamically adopt a loop-like conformation, and segments I and III can form dynamic helices that may mediate binding to membranes, particularly in the region around the N-terminal (N) immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif (ITIM), consistent with its role in signaling. Furthermore, individual SH2 domains of SHP-2 strongly engage with the unphosphorylated N-ITIM of 3DL1-cyto, while binding of the tandem SHP-2 SH2 domains to the bis-phosphorylated ITIMs results in more extensive conformational changes in segments I and III. The findings enhance our understanding of KIR function and how ITIMs in a target receptor operate in concert to engage the tandem SH2 domains of SHP-2.
The external factors that modulate Hippo signaling remain elusive. Here, we report that FGF15 activates Hippo signaling to suppress bile acid metabolism, liver overgrowth, and tumorigenesis. FGF15 is induced by FXR in ileal enterocytes in response to increased amounts of intestinal bile. We found that circulating enterohepatic FGF15 stimulates hepatic receptor FGFR4 to recruit and phosphorylate NF2, which relieves the inhibitory effect of Raf on the Hippo kinases Mst1/2, thereby switching FGFR4's role from pro-oncogenic to anti-tumor signaling. The activated Mst1/2 subsequently phosphorylates and stabilizes SHP to downregulate the key bile acid-synthesis enzyme Cyp7a1 expression, thereby limiting bile acid synthesis. In contrast, Mst1/2 deficiency impairs bile acid metabolism and remarkably increases Cyp7a1 expression and bile acid production. Importantly, pharmacological depletion of intestinal bile abrogates Mst1/2-mutant-driven liver overgrowth and oncogenesis. Therefore, FGF15-Hippo signaling along the gut-liver axis acts as a sensor of bile acid availability to restrain liver size and tumorigenesis.
Pathologies of pediatric brain tumors are more varied than those diagnosed in adults and survival outcomes more optimistic. Therapies for pediatric brain tumors are also diverse and treatment options are expanding. The growing number of adult survivors of childhood brain tumors is quite diverse. Medical management of these adults requires understanding the tumor diagnosis and location, the modalities used to treat the tumor, the age of the survivor at the time of diagnosis and treatment, any complications of treatment, and, most importantly, the baseline medical condition and neurological function of each adult survivor. A network of medical, neurological, and mental health providers is critical in the care of a child with a brain tumor. A comparable network should be available to survivors of these tumors since they may transition to adulthood with medical and neurological deficits and can acquire additional late effects of treatments as they age. Optimally, each survivor will have an individualized survivor health plan (SHP) that concisely summarizes the tumor, treatments, potential late effects, and screening that may identify evolving late effects before they impact mental, social or physical functioning. This plan helps patients, families, and the medical team advocate for surveillance aiming to optimize the survivor's quality of life. Failure to support the health and function of these heroic cancer survivors renders the medical advances, the courage, and the struggle that permitted survival meaningless.
The atypical orphan receptors DAX1 and SHP constitute the NR0B subgroup of human nuclear receptor (hNR) family; they play key roles in metabolism, reproduction, nutrition and steroidogenesis, and are involved in the pathogenesis of a variety of diseases such as cancer and adrenal hypoplasia. The two receptors lack the classical DNA-binding domain and act as the corepressors of other hNRs. The DAX1 and SHP contains three and two conserved LXXLL motifs, respectively, which can be recognized and bound by the activation function-2 (AF-2) domain of hNR proteins in agonist conformation. Here, we attempt to explore the systematic interaction profile between the five DAX1/SHP LXXLL motifs and all the 48 hNR AF-2 domains found in the human genome, to analyze the binding affinity and specificity of these motifs towards the complete domain array, and to design LXXLL-based, hydrocarbon-stapled peptides that can target the specific interaction profile for each motif. A weighted source-target network from motifs to domains is created based on the modeled domain-motif complex structures and calculated binding potencies, from which the specific interaction profile of each motif against the whole hNR array is depicted and clustered to measure the binding similarity and relationship among these motifs. Dynamics simulations reveal that the LXXLL-based peptides are highly flexible in free unbound state, thus unfavorable to be recognized and bound by AF-2 domains. Hydrocarbon-stapling technique is employed to help the constraint of these unstructured peptides to active helical conformation, thus largely improving their binding affinity to the hNR array. The hydrocarbon bridge is designed to point out of the domain's active pocket, which would not disrupt the direct interaction between the domain and peptide. Energetic decomposition imparts that the stapling has only a very modest influence on the interaction enthalpy and desolvation effect of domain-peptide binding, but can substantially reduce entropy penalty upon the binding. For a peptide ligand, the entropic reduction can be roughly regarded as a constant, which only improves (absolute) peptide binding affinity towards the whole domain array, but does not alter (relative) peptide binding specificity over different domains in the array. Overall, the stapled peptides can be considered as potent competitors to selectively target the specific interaction networks mediated by their parent LXXLL motifs in DAX1 and SHP proteins.
Protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) has led to an intense interest in developing its inhibitors as anti-diabetes, anti-obesity and anti-cancer agents. The fruits of Rubus chingii (Chinese raspberry) were used as a kind of dietary traditional Chinese medicine. The methanolic extract of R. chingii fruits exhibited significant PTP1B inhibitory activity. Further bioactivity-guided fractionation resulted in the isolation of three PTP1B inhibitory ursane-type triterpenes: ursolic acid (1), 2-oxopomolic acid (2), and 2α, 19α-dihydroxy-3-oxo-urs-12-en-28-oic acid (3). Kinetics analyses revealed that 1 was a non-competitive PTP1B inhibitor, and 2 and 3 were mixed type PTP1B inhibitors. Compounds 1-3 and structurally related triterpenes (4-8) were further analyzed the structure-activity relationship, and were evaluated the inhibitory selectivity against four homologous protein tyrosine phosphatases (TCPTP, VHR, SHP-1 and SHP-2). Molecular docking simulations were also carried out, and the result indicated that 1, 3-acetoxy-urs-12-ene-28-oic acid (5), and pomolic acid-3β-acetate (6) bound at the allosteric site including α3, α6, and α7 helix of PTP1B.
Siglec-7 is an inhibitory receptor (IR) expressed on human blood eosinophils. Whereas activation of other IRs, including Siglec-8 and CD300a, has been shown to downregulate eosinophil function, little is known about the role of Siglec-7 on human eosinophils.
To examine Siglec-7 expression and function in eosinophils from normal (ND) and eosinophilic (EO) donors.
Eosinophil expression of Siglec-7 was quantified by flow cytometry and quantitative PCR. Soluble Siglec-7 (sSiglec-7) levels were measured by ELISA in serum. The effect of Siglec-7 on eosinophil viability and degranulation was assessed in vitro by AnnexinV-FITC/7-AAD staining and by measuring GM-CSF-induced mediator release in culture supernatants. Signal transduction was studied by Western blot.
Siglec-7 was expressed ex vivo on blood eosinophils from all eosinophilic and normal individuals studied. Siglec-7 surface, but not SIGLEC-7mRNA expression, was correlated with absolute eosinophil count (AEC). Siglec-7 was upregulated on purified eosinophils after in vitro stimulation with GM-CSF or IL-5. Serum sSiglec-7 was detectable in 133/144 subjects tested and correlated with AEC. Siglec-7 cross-linking inhibited GM-CSF-induced release of eosinophil peroxidase, TNF-α, and IL-8 (n = 7-8) but did not promote eosinophil apoptosis (n = 5). Finally, Siglec-7 cross-linking on GM-CSF-activated eosinophils induced phosphorylation of SHP-1 and de-phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and p38.
Siglec-7 is constitutively expressed on human eosinophils and downmodulates eosinophil activation. Targeting of Siglec-7 on eosinophils might enhance treatment efficacy in eosinophil-driven disorders. Conversely, therapeutic interventions that inhibit Siglec-7 could have unanticipated consequences and promote eosinophilic inflammation.
In this study, we aimed to investigate a potential role of small heterodimer partner (Shp, a nuclear receptor) in regulation of morphine withdrawal syndrome and to determine the mechanisms thereof. Somatic opiate withdrawal and pharmacokinetic experiments were performed with wild-type (WT) and Shp knockout (Shp-KO) mice. Regulatory effects of Shp on Ugt2b expression were assessed in vitro (using mouse hepatoma Hepa1-6 cells) and in vivo (using Shp-KO mice). Ugt2b mRNA and protein expressions were determined by qPCR and Western blotting, respectively. Microsomal Ugt2b activity was measured with morphine and chloramphenicol. Luciferase reporter, promoter analysis and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays were performed to identify the Hnf1α- and Rev-erbα-binding sites in Ugt2b36 promoter. Protein-protein interactions were explored using co-immunoprecipitation assays. Shp ablation exacerbated morphine withdrawal syndrome in mice. Furthermore, systemic and liver exposures of morphine were elevated in Shp-KO mice due to reduced metabolism. Down-regulation of morphine metabolism was supported by down-regulated expressions of Ugt2b genes in Shp-KO mice. Regulation of Ugt2b genes by Shp was confirmed in mouse hepatoma Hepa1-6 cells. Moreover, Shp positively regulated Ugt2b36 expression through repression of Dec2 and Rev-erbα, two negative regulators of Ugt2b36 enzyme. Rev-erbα repressed Ugt2b36 transcription via direct binding to a specific response element (located at -30/-15 bp) in promoter region of Ugt2b36, whereas Dec2 acted on Ugt2b36 expression via suppression of Hnf1α-transactivation of Ugt2b36 gene. In conclusion, Shp regulated morphine withdrawal syndrome via modulation of Ugt2b expression and detoxification capacity. Targeting Shp may represent a novel approach for management of morphine dependence.
Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) is one of the most common fatal carcinomas and is well known to be lack of effective treatment. Thus, novel therapeutic strategies are greatly needed. Evodiamine, a quinozole alkaloid isolated from evodia rutaecarpa Bentham, has been demonstrated to exhibit anti-tumor effects on many cancer cells. However, little is known in terms of the effects on cholangiocarcinoma. In this study, we studied whether this traditional Chinese Medicine could serve as new potential therapeutic drugs to treat CCA. We discovered that evodiamine inhibited CCA cell proliferation and induced apoptosis. Moreover, evodiamine inhibited CCA cell migration and invasion. Mechanistically, our studies demonstrated that evodiamine inhibited the activation of IL-6 -induced STAT3 signaling activation, and the inhibitory effect was likely due to the upregulation of phosphatase shatterproof 2 (SHP-2), a negative feedback regulator of IL-6/STAT3. Blockage of SHP-2 through small interference RNA (siRNA) abolished the evodiamine -induced IL-6/STAT3 signaling inhibition. Moreover, in vivo experiment showed evodiamine inhibited the tumor growth of nude mice bearing TFK-1 xenografts. In summary, our results implied evodiamine as a promising anti-cancer agent in the treatment of CCA, and the mechanism is likely due to the inhibition of IL-6/STAT3 signaling with upregulating the expression levels of SHP-2.
Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is the leading cause of chronic hepatitis B (CHB), liver cirrhosis (LC), and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This study reveals a distinct mechanism underlying the regulation of HBV replication. HBV activates homeobox A10 (HoxA10) in human hepatocytes, leukocytes, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), HepG2-NTCP cells, leukocytes isolated from CHB patients, and HBV-associated HCC tissues. HoxA10 in turn represses HBV replication in human hepatocytes, HepG2-NTCP cells, and BALB/c mice. Interestingly, we show that during early HBV infection, p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) were activated to facilitate HBV replication; however, during late HBV infection, HoxA10 was induced to attenuate HBV replication. Detailed studies reveal that HoxA10 binds to p38 MAPK, recruits SH2-containing protein tyrosine phosphatase 1 (SHP-1) to facilitate SHP-1 in catalyzing dephosphorylation of p38 MAPK/STAT3, and thereby attenuates p38 MAPK/STAT3 activation and HBV replication. Furthermore, HoxA10 binds to the HBV enhancer element I (EnhI)/X promoter, competes with STAT3 for binding of the promoter, and thereby represses HBV transcription. Taken together, these results show that HoxA10 attenuates HBV replication through repressing the p38 MAPK/STAT3 pathway by two approaches: HoxA10 interacts with p38 MAPK and recruits SHP-1 to repress HBV replication, and HoxA10 binds to the EnhI/X promoter and competes with STAT3 to attenuate HBV transcription. Thus, the function of HoxA10 is similar to the action of interferon (IFN) in terms of inhibition of HBV infection; however, the mechanism of HoxA10-mediated repression of HBV replication is different from the mechanism underlying IFN-induced inhibition of HBV infection.IMPORTANCE Two billion people have been infected with HBV worldwide; about 240 million infected patients developed chronic hepatitis B (CHB), and 650,000 die each year from liver cirrhosis (LC) or hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This work elucidates a mechanism underlying the control of HBV replication. HBV infection activates HoxA10, a regulator of cell differentiation and cancer progression, in human cells and patients with CHB and HCC. HoxA10 subsequently inhibits HBV replication in human tissue culture cells and mice. Additionally, HoxA10 interacts with p38 MAPK to repress the activation of p38 MAPK and STAT3 and recruits and facilitates SHP-1 to catalyze the dephosphorylation of p38 MAPK and STAT3. Moreover, HoxA10 competes with STAT3 for binding of the HBV X promoter to repress HBV transcription. Thus, this work reveals a negative regulatory mechanism underlying the control of HBV replication and provides new insights into the development of potential agents to control HBV infection.
Systemic inflammation and the fever response to pathogens are coordinately regulated by IL-6 and IL-1β. We previously showed that CEACAM1 regulates the LPS driven expression of IL-1β in murine neutrophils through its ITIM receptor.
We now show that the prompt secretion of IL-6 in response to LPS is regulated by CEACAM1 expression on bone marrow monocytes. Ceacam1-/- mice over-produce IL-6 in response to an i.p. LPS challenge, resulting in prolonged surface temperature depression and overt diarrhea compared to their wild type counterparts. Intraperitoneal injection of a 64Cu-labeled LPS, PET imaging agent shows confined localization to the peritoneal cavity, and fluorescent labeled LPS is taken up by myeloid splenocytes and muscle endothelial cells. While bone marrow monocytes and their progenitors (CD11b+Ly6G-) express IL-6 in the early response (&lt; 2 h) to LPS in vitro, these cells are not detected in the bone marrow after in vivo LPS treatment perhaps due to their rapid and complete mobilization to the periphery. Notably, tissue macrophages are not involved in the early IL-6 response to LPS. In contrast to human monocytes, TLR4 is not expressed on murine bone marrow monocytes. Instead, the alternative LPS receptor RP105 is expressed and recruits MD1, CD14, Src, VAV1 and β-actin in response to LPS. CEACAM1 negatively regulates RP105 signaling in monocytes by recruitment of SHP-1, resulting in the sequestration of pVAV1 and β-actin from RP105.
This novel pathway and regulation of IL-6 signaling by CEACAM1 defines a novel role for monocytes in the fever response of mice to LPS.
Luman, also known as cAMP-response element-binding protein 3, is an endoplasmic reticulum stress-related protein that has been identified as a novel transcriptional coregulator of a variety of nuclear receptors. Herein, immunohistochemistry results showed that Luman was specifically expressed in mouse Leydig cells in an age-dependent increase manner, from prepuberty to sexual maturation. Luman was not detected in Sertoli cells within the seminiferous tubules at any developmental period. The immunoﬂuorescent experiment indicated that Luman was mainly located within the cytoplasm of murine Leydig tumor cells (MLTC-1) and primary Leydig cells (PLCs). To investigate the physiological function of Luman, experiments were conducted to examine the consequences of short hairpin RNA- and small interfering RNA-mediated Luman knock-down in MLTC-1 and PLCs, respectively. Luman knock-down significantly upregulated the expression of steroidogenic acute regulatory, cytochrome P450 cholesterol side-chain cleavage enzymes, 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, and 17-α-hydroxylase/C17-20 lyase in MLTC-1 cells and PLCs. Luman knock-down caused an increase in human chorionic gonadotropin-stimulated testosterone production in vitro and in vivo. The nuclear receptors SF-1 and Nur-77 were significantly increased upon Luman knock-down in MLTC-1. By contrast, the level of the nuclear receptor SHP decreased. Luciferase reporter assay results demonstrated that Luman knock-down upregulated the activity of SF-1 and Nur-77 promoters. These data suggested that Luman expressed in mouse Leydig cells in an age-dependent increase manner. Luman knock-down upregulated the activity of SF-1 and Nur-77 promoters, which lead to the increase of testosterone synthesis and steroidogenesis genes expression. In conclusion, these findings provide us with new insights into the role Luman played in male reproduction.
The gastrointestinal phenotype of cystic fibrosis (CF) features intestinal bile acid (BA) malabsorption, impaired intestinal farnesoid X receptor (FXR) activation, and consequently reduced fibroblast growth factor 19 (FGF19, FGF15 in mice) production. The osmotic laxative polyethylene glycol (PEG) has been shown to decrease intestinal mucus accumulation in CF mice and could, by doing so, improve BA reabsorption. Here we determined the effect of PEG on BA excretion and FXR-FGF15 signaling in CF mice. Male Cftr-/-tm1Unc (CF) and wild-type (WT) littermates were administered PEG 4000 in drinking water and fed either chow or a semisynthetic diet. PEG was withdrawn for 3 days before termination. Fecal BA excretion was measured at PEG dosages of 37 g/l (100%) and 0 g/l (0%). Ileal FXR activation was assessed by gene expression of its downstream targets Fgf15 and small heterodimer partner ( Shp). In CF mice, PEG withdrawal increased fecal BA excretion on either diet compared with full PEG dosage (chow, 2-fold, P = 0.06; semisynthetic, 4.4-fold, P = 0.007). PEG withdrawal did not affect fecal BA excretion in WT mice on either diet. After PEG withdrawal, gene expression levels of intestinal FXR target genes Fgf15 and Shp were decreased in CF mice but unaffected in WT littermates. PEG did not affect the gene expression of the main intestinal BA transporter apical sodium-dependent bile acid transporter (ASBT). PEG treatment ameliorates intestinal BA malabsorption in CF mice and restores intestinal FXR-FGF15 signaling, independent from Asbt gene expression. These findings highlight the potential of PEG in the prevention and treatment of the gastrointestinal phenotype of CF. NEW &amp; NOTEWORTHY A gastrointestinal feature of cystic fibrosis is bile acid malabsorption and consequent impairment of farnesoid X receptor (FXR)-fibroblast growth factor 15 (FGF15) signaling. FXR-FGF15 signaling regulates various metabolic processes and could be implicated in metabolic and gastrointestinal complications of cystic fibrosis, such as diabetes and liver disease. In cystic fibrosis mice, treatment with the osmotic laxative polyethylene glycol is associated with decreased fecal bile acid loss and restoration of FXR-FGF15 signaling.
The farnesoid-X-receptor (FXR) protects against inflammation and cancer of the colon through maintenance of intestinal bile acid (BA) homeostasis. Conversely, higher levels of BA and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) are risk factors for inflammation and cancer of the colon. In the United States, n-6 linoleic acid (LA) is the most commonly used dietary vegetable fat. Metabolism of n-6 fatty acids has been linked to a higher risk of intestinal cancer. The objectives of this study were to investigate in colonic mucosa the effects of a high-fat diet rich in LA (n-6HFD) on CpG methylation of Fxr and prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase-2 (Ptsg-2) genes, and the impact on the expression of tumor suppressor adenomatous polyposis Coli (Apc) and proliferative cyclin D1 (Ccnd1) genes. Weaned C57BL/6J male mice were fed for 6 weeks either an n-6HFD containing 44% energy (44%E) from 22% safflower oil (SO, 76% LA by weight) or a 13% energy (13%E) control diet (Control) from SO (5% by weight). Mice fed the n-6HFD had reduced (60%) Fxr promoter CpG methylation and increased (~50%) Fxr mRNA. The expression of FXR-target ileal bile acid-binding protein (Ibabp), small heterodimer protein (Shp), and anti-inflammatory peroxisome proliferator-activated-γ1 genes was increased. The n-6HFD reduced Ptgs-2 CpG methylation, increased the expression of Cox-2, and increased Apc CpG methylation in colonic mucosa. Accordingly, reduced expression of Apc was coupled to accumulation of c-JUN and Ccnd1, respectively cofactor and gene targets for the β-catenin/Wnt signaling pathway. Finally, the n-6HFD reduced the expression of histone deacetylase-1 while favoring the accumulation of acetylated histone 3. We conclude that an n-6HFD epigenetically modifies Fxr, leading to the activation of downstream factors that participate in BA homeostasis. However, epigenetic activation of Ptsg-2 coupled with silencing of Apc and accumulation of C-JUN and Ccnd1 may increase the risk of inflammation and cancer of the colon.
Secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHP) is a frequent complication of kidney diseases. At variance with all the other forms of SHP, which are compensatory conditions, renal SHP has many pathogenetic peculiarities, which have been only in part defined. Furthermore, in the long course of chronic kidney diseases (CKD), SHP sometimes transforms into a hypercalcemic condition resembling the autonomous form of hyperparathyroidism (tertiary hyperparathyroidism; THP). The clinical consequences of SHP in CKD patients are manifold, encompassing not only bone and mineral disorders, but also other metabolic and organic changes which frequently burden these patients. Although the medical therapeutic tools have substantially increased in number and improved in their efficacy in recent decades, we have as yet no demonstration of a clear benefit regarding the major clinical outcomes. Furthermore, some of these patients, particularly when the autonomous THP develops, still require a surgical approach.
Bile acid (BA) homeostasis is tightly regulated by multiple transcription factors, including farnesoid X receptor (FXR) and small heterodimer partner (SHP). We previously reported that loss of the FXR/SHP axis causes severe intrahepatic cholestasis, similar to human progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis type 5 (PFIC5). In this study, we found that constitutive androstane receptor (CAR) is endogenously activated in Fxr:Shp double knockout (DKO) mice. To test the hypothesis that CAR activation protects DKO mice from further liver damage, we generated Fxr;Shp;Car triple knockout (TKO) mice. In TKO mice, residual adenosine triphosphate (ATP) binding cassette, subfamily B member 11 (ABCB11; alias bile salt export pump [BSEP]) function and fecal BA excretion are completely impaired, resulting in severe hepatic and biliary damage due to excess BA overload. In addition, we discovered that pharmacologic CAR activation has different effects on intrahepatic cholestasis of different etiologies. In DKO mice, CAR agonist 1,4-bis[2-(3,5-dichloropyridyloxy)]benzene (TCPOBOP; here on TC) treatment attenuated cholestatic liver injury, as expected. However, in the PFIC2 model Bsep knockout (BKO) mice, TC treatment exhibited opposite effects that reflect increased BA accumulation and liver injury. These contrasting results may be linked to differential regulation of systemic cholesterol homeostasis in DKO and BKO livers. TC treatment selectively up-regulated hepatic cholesterol levels in BKO mice, supporting de novo BA synthesis. Conclusion: CAR activation in DKO mice is generally protective against cholestatic liver injury in these mice, which model PFIC5, but not in the PFIC2 model BKO mice. Our results emphasize the importance of the genetic and physiologic background when implementing targeted therapies to treat intrahepatic cholestasis.
Inherited mutations in SERPINA1 coding for the alpha-1 antitrypsin (A1AT) protein is the only well established cause of hereditary emphysema. We aimed to identify the genetic ecause of early-onset emphysema in a five-generation French-Canadian family free of A1AT deficiency.
Between Dec 1, 2014, and April 1, 2017, we investigated 63 individuals from a single pedigree, including 55 with DNA available. Whole-exome sequencing was done in a convenience sample of 14 individuals (nine with unambiguous expression of the typical form of emphysema observed in this family). We filtered rare non-synonymous variants that were predicted to be damaging to identify a single mutation in a biologically relevant gene shared among all affected individuals. We assessed segregation with the disease in additional family members who were not evaluated by whole-exome sequencing. The effect of the candidate variant on protein function was evaluated in vitro. mRNA and protein expression of the candidate gene was assessed in lung samples from unrelated individuals (n=80) with and without emphysema who underwent surgery for lung cancer at our institution.
A rare in-silico-predicted damaging variant (Ala455Thr) was identified in the protein tyrosine phosphatase non-receptor type 6 (PTPN6) gene, also known as SHP-1, an important negative regulator of immune processes. 20 (95%) of 21 family members with computed tomography-confirmed emphysema were heterozygotes for the Ala455Thr mutation. No Thr455 homozygotes were identified. Emphysema or reduced diffusion capacity was observed in all heterozygotes with a history of smoking. Incomplete penetrance of the mutation and variable degrees of emphysema were observed in never smokers. The Ala455Thr mutation in SHP-1 caused a reduction in phosphatase activity in vitro, confirming the loss-of-function effect of the mutation. mRNA and protein expression of PTPN6 were upregulated in smokers, but were not associated with emphysema or severity of airflow limitation.
An inherited variant in the gene PTPN6 is responsible for early-onset emphysema in this family. To our knowledge, this is the second form of hereditary emphysema since the discovery of A1AT deficiency in the 1960s, representing a breakthrough in understanding the genetics and pathogenesis of emphysema.

Gastric mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma is the most common subtype of gastric lymphoma. Most gastric MALT lymphomas are characterized by their association with the Helicobacter pylori (HP) infection and are cured by first-line HP eradication therapy (HPE). Several studies have been conducted to investigate why most gastric MALT lymphomas remain localized, are dependent on HP infection, and show HP-specific intratumoral T-cells (e.g., CD40-mediated signaling, T-helper-2 (Th2)-type cytokines, chemokines, costimulatory molecules, and FOXP3+ regulatory T-cells) and their communication with B-cells. Furthermore, the reason why the antigen stimuli of these intratumoral T-cells with tonic B-cell receptor signaling promote lymphomagenesis of gastric MALT lymphoma has also been investigated. In addition to the aforementioned mechanisms, it has been demonstrated that the translocated HP cytotoxin-associated gene A (CagA) can promote B-cell proliferation through the activation of Src homology-2 domain-containing phosphatase (SHP-2) phosphorylation-dependent signaling, extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (ERK), p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), B-cell lymphoma (Bcl)-2, and Bcl-xL. Furthermore, the expression of CagA and these CagA-signaling molecules is closely associated with the HP-dependence of gastric MALT lymphomas (completely respond to first-line HPE). In this article, we summarize evidence of the classical theory of HP-reactive T-cells and the new paradigm of direct interaction between HP and B-cells that contributes to the HP-dependent lymphomagenesis of gastric MALT lymphomas. Although the role of first-line HPE in the treatment of HP-negative gastric MALT lymphoma remains uncertain, several case series suggest that a proportion of HP-negative gastric MALT lymphomas remains antibiotic-responsive and is cured by HPE. Considering the complicated interaction between microbiomes and the genome/epigenome, further studies on the precise mechanisms of HP- and other bacteria-directed lymphomagenesis in antibiotic-responsive gastric MALT lymphomas are warranted.
Few programs train residents in recognizing and responding to distressed colleagues at risk for suicide.
To assess interns' ability to identify a struggling colleague, describe resources, and recognize that physicians can and should help colleagues in trouble.
Residency programs at an academic medical center.
One hundred forty-five interns.
An OSCE case was designed to give interns practice and feedback on their skills in recognizing a colleague in distress and recommending the appropriate course of action. Embedded in a patient "sign-out" case, standardized health professionals (SHP) portrayed a resident with depressed mood and an underlying drinking problem. The SHP assessed intern skills in assessing symptoms and directing the resident to seek help.
Interns appreciated the opportunity to practice addressing this situation. Debriefing the case led to productive conversations between faculty and residents on available resources. Interns' skills require further development: while 60% of interns asked about their colleague's emotional state, only one-third screened for depression and just under half explored suicidal ideation. Only 32% directed the colleague to specific resources for his depression (higher among those that checked his emotional state, 54%, or screened for depression, 80%).
This OSCE case identified varying intern skill levels for identifying and assessing a struggling colleague while also providing experiential learning and supporting a culture of addressing peer wellness.
Emerging evidence suggests an immunosuppressive role of altered tumor glycosylation due to downregulation of innate immune responses via immunoregulatory Siglecs. In contrast, human T cells, a major anticancer effector cell, only rarely express Siglecs. However, here, we report that the majority of intratumoral, but not peripheral blood, cytotoxic CD8+ T cells expressed Siglec-9 in melanoma. We identified Siglec-9+ CD8+ T cells as a subset of effector memory cells with high functional capacity and signatures of clonal expansion. This cytotoxic T-cell subset was functionally inhibited in the presence of Siglec-9 ligands or by Siglec-9 engagement by specific antibodies. TCR signaling pathways and key effector functions (cytotoxicity, cytokine production) of CD8+ T cells were suppressed by Siglec-9 engagement, which was associated with the phosphorylation of the inhibitory protein tyrosine phosphatase SHP-1, but not SHP-2. Expression of cognate Siglec-9 ligands was observed on the majority of tumor cells in primary and metastatic melanoma specimens. Targeting the tumor-restricted, glycosylation-dependent Siglec-9 axis may unleash this intratumoral T-cell subset, while confining T-cell activation to the tumor microenvironment.
The antigen-mediated activation of mast cells initiates signaling events leading to their degranulation, to the release of inflammatory mediators, and to the synthesis of cytokines and chemokines. Although rapid and transient microtubule reorganization during activation has been described, the molecular mechanisms that control their rearrangement are largely unknown. Microtubule nucleation is mediated by γ-tubulin complexes. In this study, we report on the regulation of microtubule nucleation in bone marrow-derived mast cells (BMMCs) by Src homology 2 (SH2) domain-containing protein tyrosine phosphatase 1 (SHP-1; Ptpn6). Reciprocal immunoprecipitation experiments and pull-down assays revealed that SHP-1 is present in complexes containing γ-tubulin complex proteins and protein tyrosine kinase Syk. Microtubule regrowth experiments in cells with deleted SHP-1 showed a stimulation of microtubule nucleation, and phenotypic rescue experiments confirmed that SHP-1 represents a negative regulator of microtubule nucleation in BMMCs. Moreover, the inhibition of the SHP-1 activity by inhibitors TPI-1 and NSC87877 also augmented microtubule nucleation. The regulation was due to changes in γ-tubulin accumulation. Further experiments with antigen-activated cells showed that the deletion of SHP-1 stimulated the generation of microtubule protrusions, the activity of Syk kinase, and degranulation. Our data suggest a novel mechanism for the suppression of microtubule formation in the later stages of mast cell activation.
Posterior hip precautions have been routinely prescribed to decrease dislocation rates. The purpose of this study was to determine whether the absence of hip precautions improved early recovery after total hip arthroplasty via the posterolateral approach.
Patients undergoing total hip arthroplasty via the posterolateral approach at 3 centers were enrolled. Patients meeting the selection criteria were randomized to standard hip precautions (SHP) or no hip precautions (NHP) for 6 weeks following surgery. HOOS Jr, Health State visual analog score, and rate of pain scores were recorded preoperatively and in subsequent postoperative visits; dislocation episodes were also noted. Standard statistical analysis was performed.
From 2016 to 2017, 159 patients were randomized to SHP and 154 patients were randomized to NHP. Controlling for the center at which the surgery was performed, the only difference in outcome scores between the 2 groups was at 2 weeks; the NHP group had a lower HOOS Jr score when compared to the SHP group (P = .03). There was no difference in outcome scores at any other time points when compared to preoperative assessments. In the SHP group, there were 2 recorded dislocations (1.3%) and 1 in the NHP group (0.7%; P = .62).
In this multicenter, randomized, controlled study, the absence of hip precautions in the postoperative period did not improve subjective outcomes which may be explained by the self-limiting behavior of NHP patients. Furthermore, with the numbers available for the study, there was no difference in the rate of dislocation between the 2 groups.
Apoptosis of tubular epithelium cells (TECs) plays critical roles in renal ischemia reperfusion (I/R) injury, but the molecular regulatory mechanisms of apoptosis still require further investigation. Recently, phosphatase family members have been suggested to regulate multiple aspects of the injury and regeneration response. However, the roles of SHP-1, an important protein-tyrosine phosphatase, in the regulation of renal I/R injury remain unknown. Here, we found that SHP-1 knockdown in vivo significantly increased renal I/R injury and aggravated the apoptosis of TECs. Consistently, after SHP-1 knockdown in TECs in vitro, a sharp increase of apoptosis induced by cobalt dichloride was found. The protective role of SHP-1 was also validated in a TEC cell line stably overexpressing SHP-1. Mechanistically, the ASK1/MKK4/JNK pro-apoptosis signal was over activated after SHP-1 knockdown, and SHP-1 could bind to and dephosphorylate ASK1 to inhibit its activation, thus repressing apoptosis.
Chemical, physical, rheological and sensory properties of biscuits fortified with shrimp protein hydrolysate powder (SHP) at various levels (0-7.5%, flour substitution) were investigated. The addition of 7.5% SHP slightly decreased diameter of biscuit and thickness was decreased as SHP at levels of 2.5-7.5% was incorporated. Hardness and fracturability of biscuit decreased as the levels of SHP was higher than 1.25 and 2.5%, respectively. Surface of biscuit became more reddish and yellowish as SHP was added. The addition of 5% SHP increased likeness score of resulting biscuit. Fortification of SHP affected the viscoelastic properties of dough. Deformation resistance and strength of dough decreased with increasing levels of SHP. Additional volatile compounds including aldehyde, ketone, alkane and ether, were detected when 5% SHP was incorporated, thus more likely contributing to odor and flavor of resulting biscuit. The addition of 5% SHP into biscuit resulted in the increased protein content with reduction of carbohydrate. Therefore, the biscuit could be fortified with 5% SHP and had higher nutritional value and increased sensory properties.
The validity and reliability of using the Kinect camera to measure standardized assessment of transitional movement, stepping, and balance was systematically reviewed and critically appraised for quality of the methods and results. The study made recommendations of specific tests for practice based on inclusion of both validity and reliability testing as well as quality of results. Authors' willingness to share their software was reported. Translation into practice is limited by lack of redundancy among studies and access to the software to implement the tests.
Fruit patterning involves the cooperation of multiple processes, including metabolic change, cell differentiation, and cell expansion. The FRUITFUL (FUL) and SHATTERPROOF1/2 (SHPs) MADS-box genes are master regulators directing the fruit patterning in several eudicots. However, the regulatory mechanisms of the FUL-SHP network in different fruit types remain unclear. Here, we characterized the functions of an ortholog (CjPLE) of SHPs from Camellia japonica. We showed that CjPLE was predominantly expressed in stamen and carpel tissues during the early stage of floral development and that transcripts were abundant in the pericarp tissues during fruit development. The ectopic expression of CjPLE in Arabidopsis caused enhanced development of the carpels, whereas no defects in floral identity were observed. To investigate the downstream targets of CjPLE, overexpression transformants were analyzed through a callus transformation system in C. azalea. We examined the expression levels of potential downstream target genes and found that two previously identified APETALA1-like genes (CjAPL1/2) were significantly upregulated. We showed that CjPLE directly bound to the CArG motifs in the promoter region of CjAPL1 (the FUL ortholog). Based on these results, we uncovered a possible positive regulation of FUL by SHP in the control of fruit development in Camellia.
While Nepal's maternal mortality ratio (MMR) has improved overall, the proportion of maternal deaths occurring in health facilities and attended to by skilled birth attendants (SBAs), has nearly doubled over 12 years. Although there are numerous socioeconomic, environmental and other factors at play, one possible explanation for this discrepancy between utilization of skilled maternal care services and birth outcomes lies in the quality of care being provided by SBAs. The objective of this study is to determine how competent SBAs are after training, across multiple settings and facility types in Nepal.
We used a quantitative cross-sectional analysis to evaluate a sample of 511 SBAs, all female, from 276 sub-health posts (SHP), health posts (HP), primary healthcare centers (PHC), and district and regional hospitals in the mountain, hill, and terai districts of Nepal. Any SBA actively employed by one of these health facilities was included. SBAs who had received less than three months of training were excluded. Outcomes were measured using SBAs' scores on a standardized knowledge assessment, clinical skills assessment, and monthly delivery volume, particularly as it compared with the WHO's recommendation for minimum monthly volume to maintain competence.
SBAs on average exhibit a deficiency of both knowledge and clinical skills, failing to meet even the 80-percent standard that is required to pass training (knowledge: 75%, standard deviation 12%; clinical skills: 48%, standard deviation 15%). Moreover, SBAs are conducting very few deliveries, with only 7 percent (38/511) meeting the minimal volume recommended to maintain competence by the WHO, and a substantial fraction (70/511, 14%) performing an average of no monthly deliveries at all.
Taken together, our findings suggest that while countries like Nepal have made important investments in SBA programs, these healthcare workers are failing to receive either effective training or sufficient practice to stay clinically competent and knowledgeable in the field. This could in part explain why institutional deliveries have generally failed to deliver better outcomes for pregnant women and their babies.
Background Gap junction channels made of Connexin37 (Cx37) are expressed by aortic endothelial and smooth muscle cells of hypertensive mice, as well as by the renin-secreting cells of kidneys. Methods and Results To decipher whether Cx37 has any role in hypertension, angiotensin II (Ang II ) was infused in normotensive wild-type and Cx37-deficient mice (Cx37-/-). After 2 to 4 weeks, the resulting increase in blood pressure was lower in Cx37-/- than in wild-type mice, suggesting an alteration in the Ang II response. To investigate this possibility, mice were submitted to a 2-kidney, 1-clip procedure, a renin-dependent model of hypertension. Two weeks after this clipping, Cx37-/- mice were less hypertensive than wild-type mice and, 2 weeks later, their blood pressure had returned to control values, in spite of abnormally high plasma renin levels. In contrast, Cx37-/- and wild-type mice that received N-nitro-l-arginine-methyl-ester, a renin-independent model of hypertension, featured a similar and sustained increase in blood pressure. The data indicate that loss of Cx37 selectively altered the Ang II -dependent pathways. Consistent with this conclusion, aortas of Cx37-/- mice featured an increased basal expression of the Ang II type 2 receptors ( AT 2R), and increased transcripts levels of downstream signaling proteins, such as Cnksr1 and Ptpn6 ( SHP -1). Accordingly, the response of Cx37-/- mice aortas to an ex vivo Ang II exposure was altered, since phosphorylation levels of several proteins of the Ang II pathway ( MLC 2, ERK , and AKT ) remained unchanged. Conclusions These findings provide evidence that Cx37 selectively influences Ang II signaling, mostly via a modulation of the expression of the Ang II type 2 receptor.
Synthetic protocols that preferentially result in metal-organic framework (MOF) crystallization of one topology over another remain an elusive, empirical process. This is primarily because of a lack of fundamental insights into MOF crystal growth and the effect of various experimental parameters on the resulting topologies. In this Communication, we demonstrate the temperature-topology relationship of MOFs constructed from hexanuclear oxozirconium cluster nodes and tetrakis(4-carboxylphenyl)porphyrin linkers via a combined transmission electron microscopy and powder X-ray diffraction study. Synthesis at room temperature led to a mixed phase consisting of 12-connected (assuming no defects) MOF-525 and 6-connected PCN-224, possessing ftw and she topologies, respectively. When the temperature was raised to 145 °C, 8-connected PCN-222 (csq topology) was found, with a possible concurrence of another 8-connected NU-902 (scu topology) and 12-connected PCN-223 (shp topology), in addition to MOF-525 and PCN-224. With an increase in reaction time at 145 °C, a change in product distribution was observed where PCN-222 remained the major crystal phase after 7 days, while the contribution from MOF-525 and PCN-224 decreased. These data suggest that MOF-525 and PCN-224 are the kinetic products while PCN-222 is the thermodynamic product.
The phosphatase Shp-2 was implicated in NK cell development and functions due to its interaction with NK inhibitory receptors, but its exact role in NK cells is still unclear. Here we show, using mice conditionally deficient for Shp-2 in the NK lineage, that NK cell development and responsiveness are largely unaffected. Instead, we find that Shp-2 serves mainly to enforce NK cell responses to activation by IL-15 and IL-2. Shp-2-deficient NK cells have reduced proliferation and survival when treated with high dose IL-15 or IL-2. Mechanistically, Shp-2 deficiency hampers acute IL-15 stimulation-induced raise in glycolytic and respiration rates, and causes a dramatic defect in ERK activation. Moreover, inhibition of the ERK and mTOR cascades largely phenocopies the defect observed in the absence of Shp-2. Together, our data reveal a critical function of Shp-2 as a molecular nexus bridging acute IL-15 signaling with downstream metabolic burst and NK cell expansion.
Sepsis, the most severe form of infection, involves endothelial dysfunction which contributes to organ failure. To improve therapeutic prospects, elucidation of molecular mechanisms underlying endothelial vascular failure is of essence.
Polymicrobial contamination induced sepsis mouse model and primary endothelial cells incubated with sepsis serum were used to study SHP-2 in sepsis-induced endothelial inflammation. SHP-2 activity was assessed by dephosphorylation of pNPP, ROS production was measured by DCF oxidation and protein interactions were assessed by proximity ligation assay. Vascular inflammation was studied in the mouse cremaster model and in an in vitro flow assay.
We identified ROS-dependent inactivation of the tyrosine phosphatase SHP-2 to be decisive for endothelial activation in sepsis. Using in vivo and in vitro sepsis models, we observed a significant reduction of endothelial SHP-2 activity, accompanied by enhanced adhesion molecule expression. The impaired SHP-2 activity was restored by ROS inhibitors and an IL-1 receptor antagonist. SHP-2 activity inversely correlated with the adhesive phenotype of endothelial cells exposed to IL-1β as well as sepsis serum via p38 MAPK and NF-κB. In vivo, SHP-2 inhibition accelerated IL-1β-induced leukocyte adhesion, extravasation and vascular permeability. Mechanistically, SHP-2 directly interacts with the IL-1R1 adaptor protein MyD88 via its tyrosine 257, resulting in reduced binding of p85/PI3-K to MyD88.
Our data show that SHP-2 inactivation by ROS in sepsis releases a protective break, resulting in endothelial activation. FUND: German Research Foundation, LMU Mentoring excellence and FöFoLe Programme, Verein zur Förderung von Wissenschaft und Forschung, German Ministry of Education and Research.
Although psoriatic arthritis is complex and involves multiple domains, recent advances in treatments have made remission or near-remission of most symptoms a potentially achievable goal for many patients. We sought to evaluate whether achieving minimal disease activity (MDA) criteria represented meaningful improvement from the patient perspective.
Data were combined from two randomized, multinational, 24 week clinical studies of ixekizumab, a high-affinity monoclonal antibody selectively targeting interleukin-17A, in biological drug-naïve or experienced adults. MDA required 5 of 7 of: tender joint count ≤1; swollen joint count ≤1; Psoriasis Area and Severity Index total score ≤ 1 or body surface area ≤ 3%; patient's assessment of pain visual analogue scale (VAS) ≤15; patient's global assessment of disease activity VAS ≤20; Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index ≤0.5; and tender entheseal points ≤ 1. MDA responders and non-responders were compared for mean change from baseline on the 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36), European Quality of Life 5 Dimension 5 Level Health Questionnaire (EQ-5D-5 L); EQ-5D-5 L VAS; and Work Productivity and Activity Impairment-Specific Health Problem (WPAI-SHP) questionnaire.
MDA responders had significantly greater improvements versus non-responders in each SF-36 domain and in the SF-36 physical summary score; improvements were also greater in the EQ-5D-5 L and EQ-5D-5 L VAS, and in 3 of the 4 WPAI-SHP domains. MDA responders were more likely to achieve minimal clinically important differences than non-responders.
These findings support MDA response as being strongly associated with achieving improved disease status based on measures of patient reported health-related quality of life and productivity.

Despite some efforts have been made in the research of supramolecular hyperbranched polymers (SHPs) self-assemblies, the study which has not been consideration to date is the influence of incoming stimuli-responsive polymer chain on their self-assembly property undergo outer stimuli. The introduction of stimuli-responsive segments which could maintain their hydrophilic property are expected to affect the self-assembly behaviour of SHPs and expand their further biomedical application. In this paper, AB2-type macromolecular monomer, LA-(CD-PDMA)2, which consisted one lithocholic acid (LA) and two β-cyclodextrin terminated poly(2-(dimethylamino)ethyl methacrylate) segments (CD-PDMA) was synthesized. LA-(CD-PDMA)2 based SHP were obtained based on the host-guest inclusion interactions of CD/LA moietes and with PDMA as pH-responsive hydrophilic chains. As a control to study the influence of incoming PDMA chains, both LA-(CD-PDMA)2 based SHPs-1 and LA-CD2 based SHPs-2 self-assemblies were comparatively investiged through 2D 1H NMR ROESY, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and dynamic light scattering (DLS). The results suggested that except for the higher drug loading efficiency LA-(CD-PDMA)2 based SHPs-1 pocessing, the release rates of SHPs-1 increased notably at pH 5.0 than that of pH 7.4 due to the repulsion and stretch of protonated PDMA chains while the release rates of SHPs-2 showed no obvious difference. Finally, basic cell experiments demonstrated that the SHPs based self-assemblies can be internalized into cancer cells, indicating their potential application in the drug delivery field.
Through population-based studies, associations have been found between coffee drinking and numerous health benefits, including a reduced risk of cardiovascular disease. Active ingredients in coffee have therefore received considerable attention from researchers. A wide variety of effects have been attributed to cafestol, one of the major compounds in coffee beans. Because cardiac hypertrophy is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular events, this study examined whether cafestol inhibits urotensin II (U-II)-induced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. Neonatal rat cardiomyocytes were exposed only to U-II (1  nM) or to U-II (1  nM) following 12-h pretreatment with cafestol (1-10 μ M). Cafestol (3-10 μ M) pretreatment significantly inhibited U-II-induced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy with an accompanying decrease in U-II-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. Cafestol also inhibited U-II-induced phosphorylation of redox-sensitive extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and epidermal growth factor receptor transactivation. In addition, cafestol pretreatment increased Src homology region 2 domains-containing phosphatase-2 (SHP-2) activity, suggesting that cafestol prevents ROS-induced SHP-2 inactivation. Moreover, nuclear factor erythroid-2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) translocation and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) expression were enhanced by cafestol. Addition of brusatol (a specific inhibitor of Nrf2) or Nrf2 siRNA significantly attenuated cafestol-mediated inhibitory effects on U-II-stimulated ROS production and cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. In summary, our data indicate that cafestol prevented U-II-induced cardiomycyte hypertrophy through Nrf2/HO-1 activation and inhibition of redox signaling, resulting in cardioprotective effects. These novel findings suggest that cafestol could be applied in pharmacological therapy for cardiac diseases.
Bile acids, synthesized in the liver and metabolized by microbiota, have emerged as important signaling molecules regulating immune responses and cell proliferation. However, the crosstalk among nutrition, microbiota, and bile acids remains unclear. Our study indicated that undernutrition in weaning piglets led to intestinal atrophy, increased colonic production, and systemic accumulation of lithocholic acid (LCA), deoxycholic acid (DCA), or their conjugated forms, which might be associated with decreased Lactobacillus abundance. Moreover, undernutrition led to increased portal fibroblast growth factor 19 ( FGF19) level, upregulated hepatic heterodimer partner ( SHP), and downregulated cholesterol 7a-hydroxylase ( CYP7A1) expression. The detrimental effects of DCA and LCA on proliferation and barrier function were confirmed in porcine enterocytes, whereas their roles in weaning piglets warrant further research. In summary, undernutrition in weaning piglets led to increased secondary bile acids production, which might be related to altered gut microbiome and enhanced farnesoid X receptor (FXR) signaling while CYP7A1 expression was suppressed.
Bile acids (BAs) are diverse molecules that are synthesized from cholesterol in the liver. The synthesis of BAs has traditionally been shown to occur through two pathways. Cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase (CYP7A1) performs the initial and rate-limiting step in the classical pathway, and sterol 27-hydroxylase (CYP27A1) initiates the hydroxylation of cholesterol in the alternative pathway. While the role of individual BA species as physiological detergents is relatively ubiquitous, their endocrine functions as signaling molecules and roles in disease pathogenesis have been emerging to be BA species-specific. In order to better understand the pharmacologic and toxicologic roles of individual BA species in an in vivo model, we created cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase (Cyp7a1) and sterol 27-hydroxylase (Cyp27a1) double knockout (DKO) mice by cross-breeding single knockout mice (Cyp7a1-/- and Cyp27a1-/- ). BA profiling and quantification by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry of serum, gallbladder, liver, small intestine, and colon of wild-type, Cyp7a1-/- , Cyp27a1-/- , and DKO mice showed that DKO mice exhibited a reduction of BAs in the plasma (45.9%), liver (60.2%), gallbladder (76.3%), small intestine (88.7%), and colon (93.6%), while maintaining a similar BA pool composition compared to wild-type mice. The function of the farnesoid X receptor (FXR) in DKO mice was lower, revealed by decreased mRNA expression of well-known FXR target genes, hepatic small heterodimer partner, and ileal fibroblast growth factor 15. However, response to FXR synthetic ligands was maintained in DKO mice as treatment with GW4064 resulted in similar changes in gene expression in all strains of mice. Conclusion: We provide a useful tool for studying the role of individual BAs in vivo; DKO mice have a significantly reduced BA pool, have a similar BA profile, and maintained response to FXR activation.
Type 2 diabetes mellitus is a fast-growing epidemic affecting people globally. We initiated the project by searching the possible target of the Pueraria lobata root extract (P. lobata). We conducted the IC50 assays of P. lobata on the four diabetes-related proteins: PTP1B, TCPTP, SHP-2 and DPP-4. Results indicated that P. lobata exhibited high PTP1B inhibitory activity with IC50 of 0.043 mg/ml. Treated insulin-resistant HepG2 cells with 0.0115 mg/ml of P. lobata increased the glucose uptake by two times compared with the negative control. Further, we performed OGTT test on the diabetic C57BL/6 male mice. 20% decreased blood glucose (AUC) was obtained with a dose of 1 g/kg P. lobata compared with the negative control. Herein, we were able to demonstrate the antidiabetic effects of P. lobata might be related to the inhibition of PTP1B and therefore, bettering the insulin signaling pathway.
Efficient seed dispersal in flowering plants is enabled by the development of fruits, which can be either dehiscent or indehiscent. Dehiscent fruits open at maturity to shatter the seeds, while indehiscent fruits do not open and the seeds are dispersed in various ways. The diversity in fruit morphology and seed shattering mechanisms is enormous within the flowering plants. How these different fruit types develop and which molecular networks are driving fruit diversification is still largely unknown, despite progress in eudicot model species. The orchid family, known for its astonishing floral diversity, displays a huge variation in fruit dehiscence types, which have been poorly investigated. We undertook a combined approach to understand fruit morphology and dehiscence in different orchid species to get more insight into the molecular network that underlies orchid fruit development. We describe fruit development in detail for the epiphytic orchid species Erycina pusilla and compare it to two terrestrial orchid species: Cynorkis fastigiata and Epipactis helleborine. Our anatomical analysis provides further evidence for the split carpel model, which explains the presence of three fertile and three sterile valves in most orchid species. Interesting differences were observed in the lignification patterns of the dehiscence zones. While C. fastigiata and E. helleborine develop a lignified layer at the valve boundaries, E. pusilla fruits did not lignify at these boundaries, but formed a cuticle-like layer instead. We characterized orthologs of fruit-associated MADS-domain transcription factors and of the Arabidopsis dehiscence-related genes INDEHISCENT (IND)/HECATE 3 (HEC3), REPLUMLESS (RPL) and SPATULA (SPT)/ALCATRAZ (ALC) in E. pusilla, and found that the key players of the eudicot fruit regulatory network appear well-conserved in monocots. Protein-protein interaction studies revealed that MADS-domain complexes comprised of FRUITFULL (FUL), SEPALLATA (SEP) and AGAMOUS (AG) /SHATTERPROOF (SHP) orthologs can also be formed in E. pusilla, and that the expression of HEC3, RPL, and SPT can be associated with dehiscence zone development similar to Arabidopsis. Our expression analysis also indicates differences, however, which may underlie fruit divergence.
Invariant natural killer T cells (iNKT cells) develop through an incompletely understood process that requires positive selection by CD4+CD8+ double-positive thymocytes and SLAM family receptors (SFRs). Here we found that SFRs promoted the development of iNKT cells by reducing the strength of the T cell antigen receptor (TCR) signal after positive selection. This effect improved the survival of iNKT cells and their responses to antigen. Loss of SFRs upregulated the expression of inhibitory receptors, including PD-1, on iNKT cells to mitigate the deleterious effect of SFR deficiency. The role of SFRs could be mimicked by expression of SLAMF6 alone in SFR-deficient mice, and this involved the adaptor SAP-kinase Fyn complex and the phosphatase SHP-1. Thus, SFRs foster iNKT cell development by attenuating TCR signal strength after positive selection.
Superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) are used as a tracer material in sentinel node biopsies. The latter is a procedure to analyze if cancer cells have spread to lymph nodes, helping to personalize patient care. To predict SPION behavior in vivo, it is important to analyze their magnetic properties in biological environments. The superparamagnetic quantifier (SPaQ) is a new device to measure the dynamic magnetization curve of SPIONs. The magnetization curve was measured for two types of SPIONs: Resovist and SHP-25. We used three techniques: Vibrating Sample Magnetometry (VSM), Magnetic Particle Spectroscopy (MPS), and our new SPaQ. Furthermore, AC susceptibility (ACS) measurements were performed as part of the evaluation of the three techniques. SPaQ and VSM results were found to be similar. Measurement results were nearly identical in both directions, indicating minor hysteresis. However, in MPS measurements, a clear hysteresis loop was observed. Furthermore, the ACS measurements showed a pronounced Brownian maximum, indicating an optimal response for an AC frequency below 10 kHz for both particle systems. Both the SPaQ and MPS were found to be superior to VSM since measurements are faster, can be performed at room temperature, and are particularly sensitive to particle dynamics. The main difference between the SPaQ and MPS lies in the excitation sequence. The SPaQ combines an alternating magnetic field that has a low amplitude with a gradual DC offset, whereas MPS uses only an alternating field that has a large amplitude. In conclusion, both the SPaQ and MPS are highly suited to improve understanding SPION behavior, which will lead to the radical improvement of sentinel node biopsy accuracy.
The orphan nuclear receptor SHP (small heterodimer partner) is a transcriptional corepressor that regulates hepatic metabolic pathways. Here we identified a role for SHP as an intrinsic negative regulator of Toll-like receptor (TLR)-triggered inflammatory responses. SHP-deficient mice were more susceptible to endotoxin-induced sepsis. SHP had dual regulatory functions in a canonical transcription factor NF-κB signaling pathway, acting as both a repressor of transactivation of the NF-κB subunit p65 and an inhibitor of polyubiquitination of the adaptor TRAF6. SHP-mediated inhibition of signaling via the TLR was mimicked by macrophage-stimulating protein (MSP), a strong inducer of SHP expression, via an AMP-activated protein kinase-dependent signaling pathway. Our data identify a previously unrecognized role for SHP in the regulation of TLR signaling.
In this study, we investigated the effects of a petroleum ether fraction of Artemisia sacrorum Ledeb. (Compositae) (PEASL) on glucose production through AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activation in human HepG2 cells. PEASL significantly inhibited glucose production in a concentration-dependent manner, and this effect was reversed in the presence of compound C, a selective AMPK inhibitor. PEASL markedly induced the phosphorylation of AMPK and downstream acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. In addition, it markedly increased the phosphorylations of glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β) in a concentration-dependent manner. In contrast, cAMP response element binding protein (CREB), a key transcription factor for gluconeogenic enzyme phosphorylation, decreased in a concentration-dependent manner. PEASL downregulated the gluconeogenesis gene expression of peroxisome proliferation activated receptor-γ coactivator-1α (PGC-1α), phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK), and glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase) in a concentration-dependent manner. In addition, the gene expression of orphan nuclear receptor small heterodimer partner (SHP) increased, also in a concentration-dependent manner. These effects were also abolished by pretreatment with compound C, an AMPK inhibitor. This indicates that PEASL inhibited glucose production via the AMPK-GSK-CREB pathway in HepG2 cells, and these effects appeared to be capable of revealing anti-diabetic mechanism of PEASL in HepG2 cells.
Endometriosis, the presence of ectopic endometrial tissue outside the uterine cavity, is a common disease affecting women during their reproductive years. The aim of this study was to identify the molecular mechanism of transcriptional regulation of inflammatory cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) gene during endometriosis by hypoxia. Hypoxia induced COX-2 expression in endometrial cells together with the induction of the orphan nuclear receptor SHP and intestinal-specific transcription factor Caudal-related transcription factor 1 (CDX1). Hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1α was responsible for SHP induction mediated by a hypoxia. In addition, we observed that ectopic expression of CDX1 enhanced COX-2 gene expression in hypoxia-dependent fashion. Additionally, we evaluated that induction of CDX1 by hypoxia was mediated by SHP. Expression of COX-2, CDX1, SHP and HIF-1α mRNA in hypoxia-treated human endometrial cells were significantly higher than normal control cells. These results suggest that the SHP and CDX1 expression increased by hypoxia play an active role in inducing inflammatory COX-2 expression in the pathogenesis of endometriosis.
Small heterodimer partner (SHP) plays important roles in diverse biological processes by directly interacting with transcription factors and inhibiting their activities. SHP has been designated an orphan nuclear receptor, but whether its activity can be modulated by ligands has been a long-standing question. Recently, retinoid-related molecules, including 4-[3-(1-adamantyl)-4-hydroxyphenyl]-3-chlorocinnamic acid (3Cl-AHPC), were shown to bind to SHP and enhance apoptosis. We have examined whether 3Cl-AHPC acts as an agonist and increases SHP activity in the repression of bile acid biosynthetic CYP7A1 and CYP8B1 genes and delineated the underlying mechanisms. Contrary to this expectation, micromolar concentrations of 3Cl-AHPC increased CYP7A1 expression but indirectly via p38 kinase signaling. Nanomolar concentrations, however, repressed CYP7A1 expression and decreased bile acid levels in HepG2 cells, and little repression was observed when SHP was down-regulated by small hairpin RNA. Mechanistic studies revealed that 3Cl-AHPC bound to SHP, increased the interaction of SHP with liver receptor homologue (LRH)-1, a hepatic activator for CYP7A1 and CYP8B1 genes, and with repressive cofactors, Brahma, mammalian Sin3a, and histone deacetylase-1, and, subsequently, increased the occupancy of SHP and these cofactors at the promoters. Mutation of Leu-100, predicted to contact 3Cl-AHPC within the SHP ligand binding pocket by molecular modeling, severely impaired the increased interaction with LRH-1, and repression of LRH-1 activity mediated by 3Cl-AHPC. 3Cl-AHPC repressed SHP metabolic target genes in a gene-specific manner in human primary hepatocytes and HepG2 cells. These data suggest that SHP may act as a ligand-regulated receptor in metabolic pathways. Modulation of SHP activity by synthetic ligands may be a useful therapeutic strategy.
DAX-1 and SHP are two closely related atypical orphan members of the nuclear receptor (NR) family that make up the NR0B subfamily. They combine properties of typical NRs and of NR-associated coregulators: both carry the characteristic NR ligand-binding domain but instead of a NR DNA-binding domain they have unique N-terminal regions that contain LxxLL-related NR-binding motifs often found in coregulators. Recent structural data indicate that DAX-1 lacks a ligand-binding pocket and thus should rely on ligand-independent mechanisms of regulation. This might be true, but remains to be proven, for SHP as well. DAX-1 and SHP have in common that they act as transcriptional corepressors of cholesterol metabolism pathways that are related on a molecular level. However, the expression patterns of the two NRs are largely different, with some notable exceptions, and so are the physiological processes they regulate. DAX-1 is mainly involved in steroidogenesis and reproductive development, while SHP plays major roles in maintaining cholesterol and glucose homeostasis. This review highlights the key similarities and differences between DAX-1 and SHP with regard to structure, function and biology and considers what can be learnt from recent research advances in the field. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled 'Orphan Receptors'.
Small heterodimer partner (SHP, NR0B2) is a unique orphan nuclear receptor that contains the dimerization and a putative ligand-binding domain, but lacks the conserved DNA binding domain. SHP exerts its physiological function as an inhibitor of gene transcription through physical interaction with multiple nuclear receptors and transcriptional factors. SHP is a critical transcriptional regulator affecting diverse biological functions, including bile acid, cholesterol and lipid metabolism, glucose and energy homeostasis, and reproductive biology. Recently, we and others have demonstrated that SHP is an epigenetically regulated transcriptional repressor that suppresses the development of liver cancer. In this review, we summarize recent major findings regarding the role of SHP in cell proliferation, apoptosis, and DNA methylation, and discuss recent progress in understanding the function of SHP as a tumor suppressor in the development of liver cancer. Future study will be focused on identifying SHP associated novel pro-oncogenes and anti-oncogenes in liver cancer progression and applying the knowledge gained on SHP in liver cancer prevention, diagnosis and treatment. 
Metformin is an oral anti-diabetic drug of the biguanide class that is commonly used to treat type 2 diabetes mellitus. This study examined the molecular mechanism for the action of metformin on osteoblast differentiation. Metformin-induced mRNA expression of the osteogenic genes and small heterodimer partner (SHP) in MC3T3E1 cells were determined by RT-PCR and real-time PCR. Metformin increased significantly the expression of the key osteogenic genes, such as alkaline phosphatase (ALP), osteocalcin (OC) and bone sialoprotein (BSP) as well as SHP. Transient transfection assays were performed in MC3T3E1 cells to confirm the effects of metformin on SHP, OC and Runx2 promoter activities. Metformin increased the transcription of the SHP and OC genes, and the metformin effect was inhibited by dominant negative form of AMPK (DN-AMPK) or compound C (an inhibitor of AMPK). The adenoviral overexpression of SHP increased significantly the level of ALP staining and OC production. However, metformin did not have any significant effect on osteogenic gene expression, ALP staining and activity, and OC production in SHP null (SHP-/-) primary calvarial cells. Moreover, upstream stimulatory factor-1 (USF-1) specifically mediated metformin-induced SHP gene expression. In addition, metformin-induced AMPK activation increased the level of Runx2 mRNA and protein. However, USF-1 and SHP were not involved in metformin-induced Runx2 expression. Transient transfection and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays confirmed that metformin-induced SHP interacts physically and forms a complex with Runx2 on the osteocalcin gene promoter in MC3T3E1 cells. These results suggest that metformin may stimulate osteoblast differentiation through the transactivation of Runx2 via AMPK/USF-1/SHP regulatory cascade in mouse calvaria-derived cells.
Protein deacetylase Sirt1 has been implicated in the regulation of hepatic gluconeogenesis; however, the mechanisms are not fully understood. To further elucidate how Sirt1 regulates gluconeogenesis, we took a loss-of-function approach by deleting the coding DNA sequence for the catalytic domain of the Sirt1 gene in the liver of a wild-type mouse (LKO(Sirt)¹) or a genetic diabetic mouse in which hepatic insulin receptor substrates 1 and 2 are deleted (DKO(Irs½)). Whereas LKO(Sirt)¹ mice exhibited normal levels of fasting and fed blood glucose, inactivation of Sirt1 in DKO(Irs½) mice (TKO(Irs½:Sirt)¹) reduced blood glucose levels and moderately improved systemic glucose tolerance. Pyruvate tolerance was also significantly improved in TKO(Irs½:Sirt)¹ mice, suggesting that Sirt1 promotes hepatic gluconeogenesis in this diabetic mouse model. To understand why inactivation of hepatic Sirt1 does not alter blood glucose levels in the wild-type background, we searched for a potential cause and found that expression of small heterodimer partner (SHP, encoded by the Nr0b2 gene), an orphan nuclear receptor, which has been shown to suppress the activity of forkhead transcription factor FoxO1, was decreased in the liver of LKO(Sirt)¹ mice. Furthermore, our luciferase reporter assays and chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis revealed that the Nr0b2 gene is a target of FoxO1, which is also regulated by Sirt1. After the gene is upregulated, Nr0b2 can feed back and repress FoxO1- and Sirt1-activated G6pc and Pdk4 gene expression. Thus, our results suggest that Sirt1 can both positively and negatively regulate hepatic gluconeogenesis through FoxO1 and Nr0b2 and keep this physiological process in control.
The adamantyl-substituted retinoid-related (ARR) compounds 3-Cl-AHPC and AHP3 induce apoptosis in vitro and in vivo in a newly established human acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) cell line, FFMA-AML, and in the established TF(v-SRC) AML cell line. FFMA-AML and TF(v-SRC) cells displayed resistance to apoptosis mediated by the standard retinoids (including trans-retinoic acid, 9-cis-retinoic acid, and the synthetic retinoid TTNPB) but showed sensitivity to apoptosis mediated by 3-Cl-AHPC- and AHP3 in vitro and in vivo as documented by poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) cleavage and apoptosis terminal deoxyribonucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling assay. 3-Cl-AHPC or AHP3 exposure in vitro resulted in decreased expression of the antiapoptotic proteins (cellular inhibitor of apoptosis 1, X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein) and phospho-Bad and activated the NF-κB canonical pathway. A significant prolongation of survival was observed both in nonobese diabetic severe combined immunodeficient mice carrying FFMA-AML cells and treated with either 3-Cl-AHPC or AHP3 and in severe combined immunodeficient mice carrying TF(v-SRC) cells and treated with AHP3. We have previously shown that ARRs bind to the orphan nuclear receptor small heterodimer partner (SHP) and that the expression of SHP is required for ARR-mediated apoptosis. Induced loss of SHP in these AML cells blocked 3-Cl-AHPC- and AHP3-mediated induction of apoptosis. These results support the further development of 3-Cl-AHPC and AHP3 as potential therapeutic agents in the treatment of AML patients.
The Small Heterodimer Partner (SHP) is an orphan nuclear receptor and an atypical member of the nuclear receptor superfamily Since its discovery, a growing body of evidences have pointed out a pivotal role for SHP in the transcriptional regulation of a variety of target genes involved in diverse metabolic pathways. While we have previously developed a homology model of the structure of SHP that was instrumental to identify a putative ligand binding pocket and suggest the possibility of the development of synthetic modulators, others reported that some atypical retinoids may represent the first synthetic ligands for this receptor. In this work, we report a combined computational approach aimed at shedding further lights on the binding mode and mechanism of action of some atypical retinoids as ligands of SHP. The results have been instrumental to design mutagenesis experiments whose preliminary data suggest the presence of a functional site in SHP as defined by residues Phe96, Arg138 and Arg238. While further experimental studies are ongoing, these findings constitute the basis for the design and identification of novel synthetic modulators of SHP functions.
Orphan nuclear receptor small heterodimer partner (SHP) plays a key role in transcriptional repression of gluconeogenic enzyme gene expression. Here, we show that SHP inhibited protein kinase A-mediated transcriptional activity of cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB), a major regulator of glucose metabolism, to modulate hepatic gluconeogenic gene expression. Deletion analysis of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) promoter demonstrated that SHP inhibited forskolin-mediated induction of PEPCK gene transcription via inhibition of CREB transcriptional activity. In vivo imaging demonstrated that SHP inhibited CREB-regulated transcription coactivator 2 (CRTC2)-mediated cAMP-response element-driven promoter activity. Furthermore, overexpression of SHP using adenovirus SHP decreased CRTC2-dependent elevations in blood glucose levels and PEPCK or glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase) expression in mice. SHP and CREB physically interacted and were co-localized in vivo. Importantly, SHP inhibited both wild type CRTC2 and S171A (constitutively active form of CRTC2) coactivator activity and disrupted CRTC2 recruitment on the PEPCK gene promoter. In addition, metformin or overexpression of a constitutively active form of AMPK (Ad-CA-AMPK) inhibited S171A-mediated PEPCK and G6Pase gene expression, and hepatic glucose production and knockdown of SHP partially relieved the metformin- and Ad-CA-AMPK-mediated repression of hepatic gluconeogenic enzyme gene expression in primary rat hepatocytes. In conclusion, our results suggest that a delayed effect of metformin-mediated induction of SHP gene expression inhibits CREB-dependent hepatic gluconeogenesis.
The orphan nuclear receptor small heterodimer partner (SHP; NR0B2) is an atypical nuclear receptor that contains a ligand-binding domain, but lacks the conserved DNA-binding domain. Since its discovery, SHP has been identified as a key transcriptional regulatory factor of genes involved in diverse metabolic pathways.
We performed a Medline/Pubmed search to find published studies on the role of SHP in the regulation of metabolism in the liver, pancreatic islets, blood vessel, and kidney and on the feasibility of using SHP as a therapeutic target in metabolic disease.
In this review, we discuss the function of SHP as regulator of cholesterol, lipid and glucose metabolism, and the role of SHP in metabolic and fibrotic diseases.
The reviewed studies suggested that SHP could be a major target for therapeutic intervention in metabolic and fibrotic diseases, including metabolic syndrome and its complications. However, for SHP-targeted therapy, there are some outstanding issues, including the small number of known inducers of SHP and the lack of sufficient data in humans.
Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) is a NAD-dependent deacetylase that is critically involved in diverse cellular processes including metabolic disease, cancer, and possibly aging. Despite extensive studies on SIRT1 function, how SIRT1 levels are regulated remains relatively unknown. Here, we report that the nuclear bile acid receptor farnesoid X receptor (FXR) inhibits microRNA-34a (miR-34a) in the liver, which results in a positive regulation of SIRT1 levels. Activation of FXR by the synthetic agonist GW4064 decreases hepatic miR-34a levels in normal mice, and consistently, hepatic miR-34a levels are elevated in FXR-null mice. FXR induces expression of small heterodimer partner (SHP), an orphan nuclear receptor and transcriptional corepressor, which in turn results in repression of p53, a key activator of the miR-34a gene, by inhibiting p53 occupancy at the promoter. MiR-34a decreased SIRT1 levels by binding to the 3'-untranslated region of SIRT1 mRNA, and adenovirus-mediated overexpression of miR-34a substantially decreased SIRT1 protein levels in mouse liver. Remarkably, miR-34a levels were elevated, and SIRT1 protein levels were reduced in diet-induced obese mice, and FXR activation in these mice reversed the miR-34a and SIRT1 levels, indicating an intriguing link among FXR activation, decreased miR-34a, and subsequently, increased SIRT1 levels. Our study demonstrates an unexpected role of the FXR/SHP pathway in controlling SIRT1 levels via miR-34a inhibition and that elevated miR-34a levels in obese mice contribute to decreased SIRT1 levels. Manipulation of this regulatory network may be useful for treating diseases of aging, such as metabolic disease and cancer.
The orphan nuclear receptor small heterodimer partner (SHP) regulates metabolic pathways involved in hepatic bile acid production and both lipid and glucose homeostasis via the transcriptional repression of other nuclear receptors. In the present study, we generated fat-specific SHP-overexpressed transgenic (TG) mice and determined the potential role of SHP activation, specifically in adipocytes, in the regulation of adipose tissue function in response to stressors. We determined in 2 mo-old SHP TG mice body weight, fat mass index, adipose tissues morphology, thermogenic and metabolic gene expression, metabolic rates at baseline and in response to beta adrenergic receptor agonists, and brown fat ultrastructural changes in response to cold exposure (6-48 h). Mice were fed a 10-wk high-fat diet (HFD; 42% fat). Weight gain, fat mass index, adipose tissues morphology, glucose tolerance, and metabolic rates were determined at the end of the feeding. Young TG mice had increased body weight and adiposity; however, their energy metabolism was increased and brown fat function was enhanced in response to cold exposure through the activation of thermogenic genes and mitochondrial biogenesis. SHP overexpression exacerbated the diet-induced obesity phenotype as evidence by marked weight gain over time, increased adiposity, and severe glucose intolerance compared with wild-type mice fed a HFD. In addition, SHP-TG mice fed HFD had decreased diet-induced adaptive thermogenesis, increased food intake, and decreased physical activity. In conclusion, SHP activation in adipocytes strongly affects weight gain and diet-induced obesity. Developing a synthetic compound to antagonize the effect of SHP may prove to be useful in treating obesity.
Angiotensin II is a major effector molecule in the development of cardiovascular disease. In vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs), angiotensin II promotes cellular proliferation and extracellular matrix accumulation through the upregulation of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) expression. Previously, we demonstrated that small heterodimer partner (SHP) represses PAI-1 expression in the liver through the inhibition of TGF-beta signaling pathways. Here, we investigated whether SHP inhibited angiotensin II-stimulated PAI-1 expression in VSMCs. Adenovirus-mediated overexpression of SHP (Ad- SHP) in VSMCs inhibited angiotensin II- and TGF-beta-stimulated PAI-1 expression. Ad-SHP also inhibited angiotensin II-, TGF-beta- and Smad3-stimulated PAI-1 promoter activity, and angiotensin II-stimulated AP-1 activity. The level of PAI-1 expression was significantly higher in VSMCs of SHP(-/-) mice than wild type mice. Moreover, loss of SHP increased PAI-1 mRNA expression after angiotensin II treatment. These results suggest that SHP inhibits PAI-1 expression in VSMCs through the suppression of TGF-beta/Smad3 and AP-1 activity. Thus, agents that target the induction of SHP expression in VSMCs might help prevent the development and progression of atherosclerosis.
Hepatic gluconeogenesis is tightly balanced by opposing stimulatory (glucagon) and inhibitory (insulin) signaling pathways. Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) is a pleiotropic growth factor that mediates diverse biological processes. In this study, we investigated the effect of HGF and its family member, macrophage-stimulating factor (MSP), on hepatic gluconeogenesis in primary hepatocytes. HGF and MSP significantly repressed expression of the key hepatic gluconeogenic enzyme genes, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK), and glucose-6-phosphatase (Glc-6-Pase) and reduced glucose production. HGF and MSP activated small heterodimer partner (SHP) gene promoter and induced SHP mRNA and protein levels, and the effect of HGF and MSP on SHP gene expression was demonstrated to be mediated via activation of the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling pathway. We demonstrated that upstream stimulatory factor-1 (USF-1) specifically mediated HGF effect on SHP gene expression, and inhibition of USF-1 by dominant negative USF-1 significantly abrogated HGF-mediated activation of the SHP promoter. Elucidation of the mechanism showed that USF-1 bound to E-box-1 in the SHP promoter, and HGF increased USF-1 DNA binding on the SHP promoter via AMPK and DNA-dependent protein kinase-mediated pathways. Adenoviral overexpression of USF-1 significantly repressed PEPCK and Glc-6-Pase gene expression and reduced glucose production. Knockdown of endogenous SHP expression significantly reversed this effect. Finally, knockdown of SHP or inhibition of AMPK signaling reversed the ability of HGF to suppress hepatocyte nuclear factor 4alpha-mediated up-regulation of PEPCK and Glc-6-Pase gene expression along with the HGF- and MSP-mediated suppression of gluconeogenesis. Overall, our results suggest a novel signaling pathway through HGF/AMPK/USF-1/SHP to inhibit hepatic gluconeogenesis.
The accumulation of extracellular matrix proteins is a common feature of fibrotic kidney diseases. Accumulating evidence suggests that TGF-beta and plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 (PAI-1) promote the development of renal fibrosis by stimulating the generation and inhibiting the removal of matrix proteins. The small heterodimer partner (SHP) represses PAI-1 expression in the liver by inhibiting TGF-beta signaling, but whether SHP inhibits renal fibrosis is unknown. Here, unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) markedly increased the expression of PAI-1, type I collagen, and fibronectin but decreased SHP gene expression. Moreover, in kidneys of SHP-/- mice, the expression of PAI-1, type I collagen, fibronectin and alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA) were higher compared with those in kidneys of wild-type mice. In addition, loss of SHP accelerated renal fibrosis after UUO. Adenovirus-mediated overexpression of SHP in cultured rat mesangial cells and renal tubular epithelial cells inhibited TGF-beta-stimulated expression of PAI-1, type I collagen, and fibronectin. SHP inhibited TGF-beta- and Smad3-stimulated PAI-1 promoter activities as well as TGF-beta-stimulated binding of Smad3 to its consensus response element on the PAI-1 promoter. Similarly, in vivo, adenovirus-mediated overexpression of SHP in the kidney inhibited the expression of UUO-induced PAI-1, type I collagen, fibronectin, and alpha-SMA. In summary, SHP attenuates renal fibrosis in obstructive nephropathy, making its pathway a possible therapeutic target for chronic kidney disease.
The orphan nuclear receptor small heterodimer partner (SHP; NR0B2) interacts with a diverse array of transcription factors and regulates a variety of cellular events such as cell proliferation, differentiation, and metabolism. However, the role of SHP in bone formation has not yet been elucidated. SHP expression is significantly increased during osteoblast differentiation, and its expression is partially regulated by bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP-2), which plays an important role in bone formation. In our study, inhibition of SHP expression significantly repressed BMP-2-induced osteoblast differentiation and ectopic bone formation. In accordance with these in vitro and in vivo results, osteoblast differentiation in SHP(-/-) mice primary osteoblasts was significantly repressed, and the mice showed decreased bone mass resulting from decreased numbers of osteoblasts. Finally, SHP physically interacts and forms a complex with runt-related transcription factor 2 (Runx2) on the osteocalcin gene promoter, and overexpression of SHP increased Runx2 transactivity via competition with histone deacetylase 4 (HDAC4), an enzyme that inhibits DNA binding of Runx2 to its target genes. Taken together, these results indicate that SHP acts as a novel positive regulator of bone formation by augmenting osteoblast differentiation through regulation of the transcriptional activity of Runx2.
Plasminogen activator inhibitor type I (PAI-1) is a marker of the fibrinolytic system and serves as a possible predictor for hepatic metabolic syndromes. Fenofibrate, a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARalpha) agonist, is a drug used for treatment of hyperlipidemia. Orphan nuclear receptor small heterodimer partner (SHP) plays a key role in transcriptional repression of crucial genes involved in various metabolic pathways. In this study, we show that fenofibrate increased SHP gene expression in cultured liver cells and in the normal and diabetic mouse liver by activating the adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling pathway in a PPARalpha-independent manner. Administration of transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) or a methionine-deficient and choline-deficient (MCD) diet to induce the progressive fibrosing steatohepatitis model in C57BL/6 mice was significantly reversed by fenofibrate via AMPK-mediated induction of SHP gene expression with a dramatic decrease in PAI-1 messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein expression along with other fibrotic marker genes. No reversal was observed in SHP null mice treated with fenofibrate. Treatment with another PPARalpha agonist, WY14643, showed contrasting effects on these marker gene expressions in wild-type and SHP null mice, demonstrating the specificity of fenofibrate in activating AMPK signaling. Fenofibrate exhibited a differential inhibitory pattern on PAI-1 gene expression depending on the transcription factors inhibited by SHP.
By demonstrating that a PPARalpha-independent fenofibrate-AMPK-SHP regulatory cascade can play a key role in PAI-1 gene down-regulation and reversal of fibrosis, our study suggests that various AMPK activators regulating SHP might provide a novel pharmacologic option in ameliorating hepatic metabolic syndromes.
Consumption of dietary flavonoids has been associated with reduced mortality and risk of cardiovascular disease, partially by reducing triglyceridemia. We have previously reported that a grape seed procyanidin extract (GSPE) reduces postprandial triglyceridemia in normolipidemic animals signaling through the orphan nuclear receptor small heterodimer partner (SHP) a target of the bile acid receptor farnesoid X receptor (FXR). Our aim was to elucidate whether FXR mediates the hypotriglyceridemic effect of procyanidins. In FXR-driven luciferase expression assays GSPE dose-dependently enhanced FXR activity in the presence of chenodeoxycholic acid. GSPE gavage reduced triglyceridemia in wild type mice but not in FXR-null mice, revealing FXR as an essential mediator of the hypotriglyceridemic actions of procyanidins in vivo. In the liver, GSPE downregulated, in an FXR-dependent manner, the expression of the transcription factor steroid response element binding protein 1 (SREBP1) and several SREBP1 target genes involved in lipogenesis, and upregulated ApoA5 expression. Altogether, our results indicate that procyanidins lower triglyceridemia following the same pathway as bile acids: activation of FXR, transient upregulation of SHP expression and subsequent downregulation of SREBP1 expression. This study adds dietary procyanidins to the arsenal of FXR ligands with potential therapeutic use to combat hypertriglyceridemia, type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome.
Small heterodimer partner (SHP) is an orphan nuclear receptor in which gene expression can be upregulated by bile acids. It regulates its target genes by repressing the transcriptional activities of other nuclear receptors including NeuroD, which has been shown to regulate secretin gene expression. Here, we evaluated the regulation on duodenal secretin gene expression by SHP and selected bile acids, cholic acid (CA) and chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA). In vitro treatment of CDCA or fexaramine elevated the SHP transcript level and occupancy on secretin promoter. The increase in the SHP level, induced by bile acid treatment or overexpression, reduced secretin gene expression, whereas this gene inhibitory effect was reversed by silencing of endogenous SHP. In in vivo studies, double-immunofluorescence staining demonstrated the coexpression of secretin and SHP in mouse duodenum. Feeding mice with 1% CA-enriched rodent chow resulted in upregulation of SHP and a concomitant decrease in secretin transcript and protein levels in duodenum compared with the control group fed with normal chow. A diet enriched with 5% cholestyramine led to a decrease in SHP level and a corresponding increase in secretin expression. Overall, this study showed that bile acids via SHP inhibit duodenal secretin gene expression. Because secretin is a key hormone that stimulates bile flow in cholangiocytes, this pathway thus provides a novel means to modulate secretin-stimulated choleresis in response to intraduodenal bile acids.
Small heterodimer partner (SHP) is an atypical member of nuclear receptor superfamily that lacks a DNA-binding domain. In previous study, we showed that SHP, c-jun, p65 of NF-gammaB subunits, and p21WAF1 expression was increased during monocytic differentiaton with the exposure of human leukemia cells to a differentiation agent, PMA. In this study, c-Jun and p65 were shown to mediate the transcriptional activation of the SHP promoter. In addition, SHP induced the cell cycle regulatory protein levels and cooperatively increased an induction of p21WAF1 expression with p65. Furthermore, SHP protected differentiated cells from etoposide-induced cellular apoptosis through the induction and cytoplasmic sequestration of p21WAF1. Complex formation between SHP and p21WAF1 was demonstrated by means of coimmunoprecipitation. These results suggest that SHP prolongs a cellular survival of differentiating monocytes through the transcriptional regulation of target genes of cell survival and differentiation.
Orphan receptor small heterodimer partner (SHP, NROB2) has been shown to be a metabolic regulator in pathways associated with several major aspects of the metabolic syndrome. However, the significance and transcriptional regulatory role of SHP in adipocyte differentiation remain unclear. Transcriptional profiles of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes and early differentiating preadipocytes in response to SHP were systemically surveyed using Affymetrix Genome Array representing well-characterized 14,000 genes. Analysis revealed about 963 genes that were up- or down-regulated by more than 2-fold during differentiation and/or by the overexpression of SHP. These genes were organized into 4 clusters that demonstrated concerted changes in expression of genes controlling various aspects of the cellular events and metabolism. Quantitative PCR was employed to further characterize gene expression and led to the identification of several key regulators and stimulators of the adipogenic program as potential new SHP targets. Overexpression of SHP inhibited the differentiation process as well as the accumulation of neutral lipids within the cells. Our data suggests that SHP may function as a molecular switch that governs adipogenesis and a potent adipogenic suppressor that maintains preadipocytes in an undifferentiated state through inhibition of the adipogenic transcription factors and stimulators. Developing SHP agonist may promise a future treatment for obesity.
The primary bile acid receptor farnesoid X receptor (FXR) maintains lipid and glucose homeostasis by regulating expression of numerous bile acid-responsive genes, including an orphan nuclear receptor and metabolic regulator SHP. Using SHP as a model gene, we studied how FXR activity is regulated by p300 acetylase. FXR interaction with p300 and their recruitment to the SHP promoter and acetylated histone levels at the promoter were increased by FXR agonists in mouse liver and HepG2 cells. In contrast, p300 recruitment and acetylated histones at the promoter were not detected in FXR-null mice. p300 directly interacted with and acetylated FXR in vitro. Overexpression of p300 wild type increased, whereas a catalytically inactive p300 mutant decreased, acetylated FXR levels and FXR transactivation in cells. While similar results were observed with a related acetylase, CBP, GCN5 did not enhance FXR transactivation, and its recruitment to the promoter was not increased by FXR agonists, suggesting functional specificity of acetylases in FXR signaling. Down-regulation of p300 by siRNA decreased acetylated FXR and acetylated histone levels, and occupancy of FXR at the promoter, resulting in substantial inhibition of SHP expression. These results indicate that p300 acts as a critical coactivator of FXR induction of SHP by acetylating histones at the promoter and FXR itself. Surprisingly, p300 down-regulation altered expression of other metabolic FXR target genes involved in lipoprotein and glucose metabolism, such that beneficial lipid and glucose profiles would be expected. These unexpected findings suggest that inhibition of hepatic p300 activity may be beneficial for treating metabolic diseases.
In recent years, it has become clear that drug metabolizing enzymes and efflux transporters are directly under the control of tissue-specific orphan receptors, mainly pregnenolone x-receptor (PXR), and constitutive androstene receptor (CAR), that coordinately regulate their transcription. The consequences of xenobiotic activation of these receptors leads to unpredictability of drug kinetics and in some cases drug pharmacodynamics. Since receptor specific co-regulators are critically involved in this process, this review serves to highlight important new advances in this area of research. Specifically, this review focuses on co-regulator interactions described for PXR and CAR and some models that provide an explanation for receptor activation and repression. PXR is basally repressed and is activated in a ligand and tissue specific manner through a complex shift in co-repressor (Silencing mediator of retinoid and thyroid receptor (SMRT) and nuclear receptor co-repressor (N-CoR)) and co-activator (Steroid receptor coactivator-1(SRC-1), PPAR and glucocorticoid receptor coactivator-1(PGC-1), Hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 (HNF-4)) interactions favoring activation. Other higher order complexes impinge on this shift and include small heterodimer partner (SHP) mediated inhibition of co-activators and still others involved in histone acetylation/deacetylation (e.g., SWI/SNF, HDACs). Similar interactions have been proposed for CAR and these will be discussed in detail. Finally, this review will focus on the implications of understanding receptor-co-regulator interactions with the eventual aim of assessing polymorphisms in this transcriptional complex as a method to normalize the effects of drug metabolism.
The caudal-related homeobox gene, CDX1, encodes for an intestinal-specific transcription factor and is involved in the induction of intestinal metaplasia (IM) of the stomach in gastric cancer. Gastric IM induced by bile reflux is a precancerous gastric adenocarcinomal lesion and has been associated with the induction of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2). In this study, we demonstrate the molecular mechanisms underlying the transcriptional regulation of COX-2 by bile acid in gastric cells. We noted that the ectopic expression of CDX1 enhanced COX-2 gene expression and that bile acid was associated with the induction of CDX1 expression. Furthermore, the induction of CDX1 by bile acid was mediated by the orphan nuclear receptor, small heterodimer partner (SHP). Finally, it was verified that the expression of COX-2, CDX1, SHP and CCAAT element-binding protein beta messenger RNA in human IM lesions were significantly higher than in lesions associated with gastritis. Collectively, these results reveal that bile acid induces an increase in the gene expression of COX-2 via the sequential transcriptional induction of SHP and CDX1 in precancerous lesions of human gastric cancer.
(E)-4-[3-(1-Adamantyl)-4'-hydroxyphenyl]-3-chlorocinnamic acid (3-Cl-AHPC) induces the cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis of leukemia and cancer cells. Studies demonstrated that 3-Cl-AHPC bound to the atypical orphan nuclear receptor small heterodimer partner (SHP). Although missing a DNA-binding domain, SHP heterodimerizes with the ligand-binding domains of other nuclear receptors to repress their abilities to induce or inhibit gene expression. 3-Cl-AHPC analogues having the 1-adamantyl and phenolic hydroxyl pharmacophoric elements replaced with isosteric groups were designed, synthesized, and evaluated for their inhibition of proliferation and induction of human cancer cell apoptosis. Structure-anticancer activity relationship studies indicated the importance of both groups to apoptotic activity. Docking of 3-Cl-AHPC and its analogues to an SHP computational model that was based on the crystal structure of ultraspiracle complexed with 1-stearoyl-2-palmitoylglycero-3-phosphoethanolamine suggested why these 3-Cl-AHPC groups could influence SHP activity. Inhibitory activity against Src homology 2 domain-containing protein tyrosine phosphatase 2 (Shp-2) was also assessed. The most active Shp-2 inhibitor was found to be the 3'-(3,3-dimethylbutynyl) analogue of 3-Cl-AHPC.
SHP (small heterodimer partner) is a well-known NR (nuclear receptor) co-regulator. In the present study, we have identified a new SHP-interacting protein, termed SMILE (SHP-interacting leucine zipper protein), which was previously designated as ZF (Zhangfei) via a yeast two-hybrid system. We have determined that the SMILE gene generates two isoforms [SMILE-L (long isoform of SMILE) and SMILE-S (short isoform of SMILE)]. Mutational analysis has demonstrated that the SMILE isoforms arise from the alternative usage of initiation codons. We have confirmed the in vivo interaction and co-localization of the SMILE isoforms and SHP. Domain-mapping analysis indicates that the entire N-terminus of SHP and the middle region of SMILE-L are involved in this interaction. Interestingly, the SMILE isoforms counteract the SHP repressive effect on the transactivation of ERs (estrogen receptors) in HEK-293T cells (human embryonic kidney cells expressing the large T-antigen of simian virus 40), but enhance the SHP-repressive effect in MCF-7, T47D and MDA-MB-435 cells. Knockdown of SMILE gene expression using siRNA (small interfering RNA) in MCF-7 cells increases ER-mediated transcriptional activity. Moreover, adenovirus-mediated overexpression of SMILE and SHP down-regulates estrogen-induced mRNA expression of the critical cell-cycle regulator E2F1. Collectively, these results indicate that SMILE isoforms regulate the inhibition of ER transactivation by SHP in a cell-type-specific manner and act as a novel transcriptional co-regulator in ER signalling.
Conversion into bile acids represents an important route to remove excess cholesterol from the body. Rev-erbalpha is a nuclear receptor that participates as one of the clock genes in the control of circadian rhythmicity and plays a regulatory role in lipid metabolism and adipogenesis. Here, we investigate a potential role for Rev-erbalpha in the control of bile acid metabolism via the regulation of the neutral bile acid synthesis pathway.
Bile acid synthesis and CYP7A1 gene expression were studied in vitro and in vivo in mice deficient for or over expressing Rev-erbalpha.
Rev-erbalpha-deficient mice display a lower synthesis rate and an impaired excretion of bile acids into the bile and feces. Expression of CYP7A1, the rate-limiting enzyme of the neutral pathway, is decreased in livers of Rev-erbalpha-deficient mice, whereas adenovirus-mediated hepatic Rev-erbalpha overexpression induces its expression. Moreover, bile acid feeding resulted in a more pronounced suppression of hepatic CYP7A1 expression in Rev-erbalpha-deficient mice. Hepatic expression of E4BP4 and the orphan nuclear receptor small heterodimer partner (SHP), both negative regulators of CYP7A1 expression, is increased in Rev-erbalpha-deficient mice. Promoter analysis and chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated that SHP and E4BP4 are direct Rev-erbalpha target genes. Finally, the circadian rhythms of liver CYP7A1, SHP, and E4BP4 messenger RNA levels were perturbed in Rev-erbalpha-deficient mice.
These data identify a role for Rev-erbalpha in the regulatory loop of bile acid synthesis, likely acting by regulating both hepatic SHP and E4BP4 expression.
The small heterodimer partner (SHP; NROB2), a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily, contributes to the biological regulation of several major functions of the liver. However, the role of SHP in cellular proliferation and tumorigenesis has not been investigated before. Here we report that SHP negatively regulates tumorigenesis both in vivo and in vitro. SHP-/- mice aged 12 to 15 months old developed spontaneous hepatocellular carcinoma, which was found to be strongly associated with enhanced hepatocyte proliferation and increased cyclin D1 expression. In contrast, overexpressing SHP in hepatocytes of SHP-transgenic mice reversed this effect. Embryonic fibroblasts lacking SHP showed enhanced proliferation and produced increased cyclin D1 messenger RNA and protein, and SHP was shown to be a direct negative regulator of cyclin D1 gene transcription. The immortal SHP-/- fibroblasts displayed characteristics of malignant transformed cells and formed tumors in nude mice.
These results provide first evidence that SHP plays tumor suppressor function by negatively regulating cellular growth.
Sodium arsenite has been demonstrated to alter the expression of genes associated with glucose homeostasis in tissues involved in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes; however, the underlying molecular mechanism has not been fully elucidated yet. In this study, we report that the sodium arsenite-induced gene expression of the small heterodimer partner (SHP; NR0B2), an atypical orphan nuclear receptor, regulates the expression of hepatic gluconeogenic genes. Sodium arsenite augments hepatic SHP mRNA levels in an AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)-dependent manner. Sodium arsenite activated AMPK and was shown to perturb cellular ATP levels. The arsenite-induced SHP mRNA level was blocked by adenoviral overexpression of dominant negative AMPK (Ad-dnAMPKalpha) or by the AMPK inhibitor compound C in hepatic cell lines. We demonstrated the dose-dependent induction of SHP mRNA levels by sodium arsenite and repressed the forskolin/dexamethasone-induced gene expression of the key hepatic gluconeogenic genes phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) and glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase). Ad-dnAMPKalpha blocked the repressive effects of arsenite-induced SHP on PEPCK and G6Pase. Sodium arsenite inhibited the promoter activity of PEPCK and G6Pase, and this repression was abolished by small interfering (si)RNA SHP treatments. The knockdown of SHP expression by oligonucleotide siRNA SHP or adenoviral siRNA SHP released the sodium arsenite-mediated repression of forskolin/dexamethasone-stimulated PEPCK and G6Pase gene expression in a variety of hepatic cell lines. Results from our study suggest that sodium arsenite induces SHP via AMPK to inhibit the expression of hepatic gluconeogenic genes and also provide us with a novel molecular mechanism of arsenite-mediated regulation of hepatic glucose homeostasis.
SHP (small heterodimer partner; NR0B2) is an atypical orphan NR (nuclear receptor) that functions as a transcriptional co-repressor by interacting with a diverse set of NRs and transcriptional factors. HNF-6 (hepatocyte nuclear factor-6) is a key regulatory factor in pancreatic development, endocrine differentiation and the formation of the biliary tract, as well as glucose metabolism. In this study, we have investigated the function of SHP as a putative repressor of HNF-6. Using transient transfection assays, we have shown that SHP represses the transcriptional activity of HNF-6. Confocal microscopy revealed that both SHP and HNF-6 co-localize in the nuclei of cells. SHP physically interacted with HNF-6 in protein-protein association assays in vitro. EMSAs (electrophoretic mobility-shift assays) and ChIP (chromatin immunoprecipitation) assays demonstrated that SHP inhibits the DNA-binding activity of HNF-6 to an HNF-6-response element consensus sequence, and the HNF-6 target region of the endogenous G6Pase (glucose 6-phosphatase) promoter respectively. Northern blot analysis of HNF-6 target genes in cells infected with adenoviral vectors for SHP and SHP siRNAs (small inhibitory RNAs) indicated that SHP represses the expression of endogenous G6Pase and PEPCK (phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase). Our results suggest that HNF-6 is a novel target of SHP in the regulation of gluconeogenesis.
The highly developed endoplasmic reticulum (ER) structure of pancreatic beta-cells is a key factor in beta-cell function. Here we examined whether ER stress-induced activation of activating transcription factor (ATF)-6 impairs insulin gene expression via up-regulation of the orphan nuclear receptor small heterodimer partner (SHP; NR0B2), which has been shown to play a role in beta-cell dysfunction. We examined whether ER stress decreases insulin gene expression, and this process is mediated by ATF6. A small interfering RNA that targeted SHP was used to determine whether the effect of ATF6 on insulin gene expression is mediated by SHP. We also measured the expression level of ATF6 in pancreatic islets in Otsuka Long Evans Tokushima Fatty rats, a rodent model of type 2 diabetes. High glucose concentration (30 mmol/liter glucose) increased ER stress in INS-1 cells. ER stress induced by tunicamycin, thapsigargin, or dithiotreitol decreased insulin gene transcription. ATF6 inhibited insulin promoter activity, whereas X-box binding protein-1 and ATF4 did not. Adenovirus-mediated overexpression of active form of ATF6 in INS-1 cells impaired insulin gene expression and secretion. ATF6 also down-regulated pancreatic duodenal homeobox factor-1 and RIPE3b1/MafA gene expression and repressed the cooperative action of pancreatic duodenal homeobox factor-1, RIPE3b1/MafA, and beta-cell E box transactivator 2 in stimulating insulin transcription. The ATF6-induced suppression of insulin gene expression was associated with up-regulation of SHP gene expression. Finally, we found that expression of ATF6 was increased in the pancreatic islets of diabetic Otsuka Long Evans Tokushima Fatty rats, compared with their lean, nondiabetic counterparts, Long-Evans Tokushima Otsuka rats. Collectively, this study shows that ER stress-induced activation of ATF6 plays an important role in the development of beta-cell dysfunction.
The liver receptor homologue 1 (LRH-1 (NR5A2)) belongs to the orphan nuclear receptor family, indicating that initially no ligand was known. Although recent studies have shown that ligand binding can be obtained, the biological relevance remains elusive. Here, we modify the observed X-ray ligand into a biologically more significant phospholipid (phosphatidylserine, PS) present in human, to study, by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, the impact of the ligand on the receptor and the interaction with different cofactor peptides. Furthermore, we characterize the interactions between receptor and the cofactor peptides of DAX-1 (NR0B1), Prox1 and SHP LXXLL box 1 and 2 (NR0B2) in terms of specificity. Our MD simulation results show different interaction patterns for the SHP box2 compared to DAX-1, PROX1 and SHP box1. SHP box2 shows specific interactions at its more C-terminal end while the other investigated peptides show specific interactions at several positions but particularly at the +2 site. The peptide +2 side chain interacts with a charged amino acid of the receptor, in hLRH-1 Asp372. Together with the charge clamp residues Arg361 and Glu534, Asp372 forms a triangle shaped charge clamp responsible for peptide orientation and increased affinity. The binding of the PS ligand causes no overall structural changes of the receptor but affects the interactions with cofactor peptides. The cofactor peptides from SHP decrease its interaction with the receptor upon ligand binding while DAX-1 and PROX1 are unchanged or increase. The diverse ligand binding response of the cofactor provides an opportunity for drug design with the possibility to create agonist ligands to modify cofactor interaction.
The orphan nuclear hormone receptor small heterodimer partner (SHP) regulates the expression of several genes involved in bile acid homeostasis in the liver. Because bile acid toxicity is a major source of liver injury in cholestatic disease, we explored the role of SHP in liver damage induced by common bile duct ligation (BDL). Shp(-/-) mice show increased sensitivity in this model of acute obstructive cholestasis, with greater numbers of bile infarcts and higher mortality than wild-type C57BL/6 mice. This increased sensitivity could not be accounted for by differences in expression of bile acid homeostatic genes 2 or 5 days after BDL. Instead, higher basal expression of such genes, including the key biosynthetic enzyme cholesterol 7alpha hydroxylase (Cyp7A1) and the bile salt export pump, is associated with both an increase in bile flow prior to BDL and an increase in acute liver damage at only 1.5 hours after BDL in Shp(-/-) mice, as shown by bile infarcts. At 3 hours, Cyp7A1 expression still remained elevated in Shp(-/-) with respect to wild-type mice, and the hepatic and serum bile acid levels and total hepatobiliary bile acid pool were significantly increased. The increased sensitivity of mice lacking SHP contrasts with the decreased sensitivity of mice lacking the farnesoid X receptor (FXR; nuclear receptor subfamily 1, group H, member 4) to BDL, which has been associated with decreased intraductal pressure and fewer bile infarcts.
We propose that differences in acute responses to BDL, particularly the early formation of bile infarcts, are a primary determinant of the differences in longer term sensitivity of the Fxr(-/-) and Shp(-/-) mice to acute obstructive cholestasis.
Bile reflux is considered to be one of the most important causative factors in gastric carcinogenesis, due to the attendant inflammatory changes in the gastric mucosa. In this study, we have assessed the molecular mechanisms inherent to the contribution of bile acid to the transcriptional regulation of inflammatory-related genes. In this study, we demonstrated that bile acid induced the expression of the SHP orphan nuclear receptor at the transcriptional level via c-Jun activation. Bile acid also enhanced the protein interaction of NF-kappaB and SHP, thereby resulting in an increase in c-Jun expression and the production of the inflammatory cytokine, TNFalpha. These results indicate that bile acid performs a critical function in the regulation of the induction of inflammatory-related genes in gastric cells, and that bile acid-mediated gene expression provides a pre-clue for the development of gastric cellular malformation.
Perilipin is a protein localized on lipid droplet surfaces in adipocytes and steroidogenic cells, playing a central role in regulated lipolysis. Expression of the perilipin gene is markedly induced during adipogenesis. We found that transcription from the perilipin gene promoter is activated by an orphan nuclear receptor, estrogen receptor-related receptor (ERR)alpha. A response element to this receptor was identified in the promoter region by a gene reporter assay, the electrophoretic-gel mobility-shift assay and the chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator (PGC)-1alpha enhanced, whereas small heterodimer partner (SHP) repressed, the transactivating function of ERRalpha on the promoter. Thus, the perilipin gene expression is regulated by a transcriptional network controlling energy metabolism, substantiating the functional importance of perilipin in the maintenance of body energy balance.
The nuclear hormone receptors hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 (HNF4) and retinoid X receptor alpha (RXRalpha) plus peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARalpha) heterodimer support hepatitis B virus (HBV) pregenomic RNA synthesis and viral replication in nonhepatoma cells. Small heterodimer partner (SHP), an orphan nuclear hormone receptor lacking a DNA binding domain, inhibits nuclear hormone receptor-mediated viral transcription and replication. The inhibition of HBV replication by SHP is dependent on the presence of nuclear hormone receptors. HBV replication that is dependent on HNF4 is considerably more sensitive to SHP-mediated inhibition than RXRalpha/PPARalpha-directed viral biosynthesis. SHP inhibition of HBV biosynthesis in HepG2 cells suggests that multiple nuclear hormone receptors mediate viral replication in this human hepatoma cell line. These observations suggest that the physiological regulation of HBV biosynthesis by SHP in the liver will depend on both the level of SHP expression and the relative contribution of HNF4 and RXRalpha/PPARalpha, plus potentially additional nuclear hormone receptors, to HBV RNA synthesis and replication.
Nuclear receptors (NRs) are a unique superfamily of transcription factors (TFs) which are involved in and play a crucial role in almost all aspects of mammalian physiology. Small Heterodimer Partner (SHP; NR0B2), an exceptional member of this superfamily of NRs, have been identified as a key regulatory factor of the transcription of a variety of genes involved in diverse metabolic pathways, and are thereby an important factor in a variety of physiological functions. Since its discovery a decade ago, considerable progress has been made in the elucidation of the underlying mechanism by which SHP regulates various metabolic processes, and the results of previous studies support its importance in the maintenance of metabolic homeostasis. In this review, we have evaluated the current state of understanding of the molecular mechanisms and the resultant physiological interpretations governed by SHP.
The orphan nuclear receptor liver receptor homolog-1 (LRH-1, NR5A2) has been reported to play a crucial role in early development, in the control of the hepatic inflammatory response, in intestinal cell crypt renewal as well as in bile acid biosynthesis and reverse cholesterol transport (RCT). Here, we report the identification of apolipoprotein M (APOM) as a novel target gene for LRH-1. Using gene-silencing experiments, adenovirus-mediated overexpression, transient transfection, and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays, it is shown that LRH-1 directly regulates human and mouse APOM transcription by binding to an LRH-1 response element located in the proximal APOM promoter region. In addition, we demonstrate that bile acids suppress APOM expression in a SHP-dependent manner in vitro and in vivo by inhibiting LRH-1 transcriptional activity on the APOM promoter as demonstrated by in vivo ChIP assay. Taken together, our results demonstrate that LRH-1 is a novel regulator of APOM transcription and further extend the role of this orphan nuclear receptor in lipoprotein metabolism and cholesterol homeostasis.
Metformin is an antidiabetic drug commonly used to treat type 2 diabetes. The aim of the study was to determine whether metformin regulates hepatic gluconeogenesis through the orphan nuclear receptor small heterodimer partner (SHP; NR0B2).
We assessed the regulation of hepatic SHP gene expression by Northern blot analysis with metformin and adenovirus containing a constitutive active form of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) (Ad-AMPK) and evaluated SHP, PEPCK, and G6Pase promoter activities via transient transfection assays in hepatocytes. Knockdown of SHP using siRNA SHP was conducted to characterize the metformin-induced inhibition of hepatic gluconeogenic gene expression in hepatocytes, and metformin-and adenovirus SHP (Ad-SHP)-mediated hepatic glucose production was measured in B6-Lep(ob/ob) mice.
Hepatic SHP gene expression was induced by metformin, 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide-1-beta-d-ribofuranoside (AICAR), and Ad-AMPK. Metformin-induced SHP gene expression was abolished by adenovirus containing the dominant negative form of AMPK (Ad-DN-AMPK), as well as by compound C. Metformin inhibited hepatocyte nuclear factor-4alpha-or FoxA2-mediated promoter activity of PEPCK and G6Pase, and the inhibition was blocked with siRNA SHP. Additionally, SHP knockdown by adenovirus containing siRNA SHP inhibited metformin-mediated repression of cAMP/dexamethasone-induced hepatic gluconeogenic gene expression. Furthermore, oral administration of metformin increased SHP mRNA levels in B6-Lep(ob/ob) mice. Overexpression of SHP by Ad-SHP decreased blood glucose levels and hepatic gluconeogenic gene expression in B6-Lep(ob/ob) mice.
We have concluded that metformin inhibits hepatic gluconeogenesis through AMPK-dependent regulation of SHP.
Coordinated regulation of bile acid biosynthesis, the predominant pathway for hepatic cholesterol catabolism, is mediated by few key nuclear receptors including the orphan receptors liver receptor homolog 1 (LRH-1), hepatocyte nuclear factor 4alpha (HNF4alpha), small heterodimer partner (SHP), and the bile acid receptor FXR (farnesoid X receptor). Activation of FXR initiates a feedback regulatory loop via induction of SHP, which suppresses LRH-1- and HNF4alpha-dependent expression of cholesterol 7alpha hydroxylase (CYP7A1) and sterol 12alpha hydroxylase (CYP8B1), the two major pathway enzymes. Here we dissect the transcriptional network governing bile acid biosynthesis in human liver by identifying GPS2, a stoichiometric subunit of a conserved corepressor complex, as a differential coregulator of CYP7A1 and CYP8B1 expression. Direct interactions of GPS2 with SHP, LRH-1, HNF4alpha, and FXR indicate alternative coregulator recruitment strategies to cause differential transcriptional outcomes. In addition, species-specific differences in the regulation of bile acid biosynthesis were uncovered by identifying human CYP8B1 as a direct FXR target gene, which has implications for therapeutic approaches in bile acid-related human disorders.
Small heterodimer partner (SHP; NR0B2) is an unusual orphan member of the nuclear receptor superfamily that functions as a corepressor of other nuclear receptors through heterodimeric interactions. Mutations in SHP are associated with mild obesity and insulin resistance. The protein domain structure of SHP is similar to Dosage-sensitive sex reversal adrenal hypoplasia congenita (AHC) critical region on the X chromosome, gene 1 (DAX1; NR0B1). Mutations in DAX1 cause AHC with associated hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. DAX1A is an alternatively spliced isoform of DAX1 that lacks the last 80 amino acids of the DAX1 C-terminal repressor domain and is replaced by a novel 10-amino acid motif. We have previously shown homodimerization of SHP and DAX1 individually, heterodimerization of DAX1 with SHP, and heterodimerization of DAX1 with DAX1A. In these studies, we investigated the domains and residues of SHP involved in SHP homodimerization and DAX1-SHP heterodimerization and also further characterized DAX1-DAX1 homodimerization and DAX1-DAX1A heterodimerization. We showed involvement of the SHP LXXLL motifs and AF-2 domain in SHP homodimerization and DAX1-SHP heterodimerization. We demonstrated redundancy of the LXXLL motifs in DAX1 homodimerization. While DAX1A subcellular localization is mostly cytoplasmic, DAX1-DAX1A heterodimers existed in the nucleus, suggesting differential functions for DAX1A in each compartment. We showed that the AF-2 domain of DAX1 is involved in DAX1-DAX1A heterodimerization. These results indicate that NR0B family members use similar mechanisms for homodimerization as well as heterodimerization. These resemble coactivator-receptor interactions that may have potential functional consequences for molecular mechanisms of the NR0B family.
DAX1 is an orphan nuclear receptor with actions in mammalian sex determination, regulation of steroidogenesis, embryonic development and neural differentiation. Conserved patterns of DAX1 gene expression from mammals to fish have been taken to suggest conserved function. In the present study, the European sea bass, Dicentrarchus labrax, DAX1 promoter was isolated and its conserved features compared to other fish and mammalian DAX1 promoters in order to derive common regulators and functional gene networks. Fish and mammalian DAX1 promoters share common sets of transcription factor frameworks which were also present in the promoter region of another 127 genes. Pathway analysis clustered these into candidate gene networks associated with the fish and mammalian DAX1. The networks identified are concordant with described functions for DAX1 in embryogenesis, regulation of transcription, endocrine development and steroid production. Novel candidate gene network partners were also identified, which implicate DAX1 in ion homeostasis and transport, lipid transport and skeletal development. Experimental evidence is provided supporting roles for DAX1 in steroid signalling and osmoregulation in fish. These results highlight the usefulness of the in silico comparative approach to analyse gene regulation for hypothesis generation. Conserved promoter architecture can be used also to predict potentially new gene functions. The approach reported can be applied to genes from model and non-model species.
The orphan nuclear receptor, small heterodimer partner (SHP), appears to play a negative regulatory role in innate immune signaling. Emerging evidence warrants further study on the therapeutic targeting of SHP to suppress excessive and deleterious inflammation. Here we show that fenofibrate, which targets SHP, is required for inhibiting systemic inflammation via mitochondrial uncoupling protein 2 (UCP2). In vivo administration of fenofibrate ameliorated systemic inflammatory responses and increased survival upon experimental sepsis through SHP. An abundance of SHP was observed in mice fed fenofibrate and in cultured macrophages through LKB1-dependent activation of the AMP-activated protein kinase pathway. Fenofibrate significantly blocked endotoxin-triggered inflammatory signaling responses via SHP, but not via peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-α. In addition to the known mechanism by which SHP modulates innate signaling, we identify a new role of fenofibrate-induced SHP on UCP2 induction, which is required for the suppression of inflammatory responses through modulation of mitochondrial ROS production. These data strongly suggest that the SHP-inducing drug fenofibrate paves the way for novel therapies for systemic inflammation by targeting SHP.
The small heterodimer partner (SHP; NR0B2) regulates the transcription of a variety of target genes and controls a variety of physiological functions in various tissues. However, the role of SHP in beta cell has not been fully determined yet. We used SHP knockout (SHP KO) mice to investigate the role of SHP in multiple low-dose streptozotocin (MLDS)-induced diabetes. Blood glucose and insulin levels were measured until 20 days, and intraperitoneal glucose tolerance and glucose-stimulated insulin secretion tests were performed. The expression of apoptotic genes and beta cell markers were detected by quantitative realtime-polymerase chain reaction, immunostaining and western blot analysis. SHP KO mice showed significantly lower blood glucose, higher insulin levels, and enhanced glucose tolerance compared with wild type (WT) mice after MLDS treatment. Moreover, beta cell mass and pancreatic insulin content were remarkably increased in SHP KO mice. In the response to glucose stimulation, islets of SHP KO showed increased insulin secretion via up-regulation of beta cell enriched transcription factors compared to WT mice after streptozotocin (STZ) treatment. In quantification for beta cell apoptosis at day 1 post STZ treatment, the SHP KO mice showed significantly increased anti-apoptotic gene expression and decreased release of apoptotic markers cytochrome c, smac/diablo, and only a few apoptotic beta cells were found in SHP KO pancreas through inactivation of caspase-3, compared to those of WT. These data demonstrate that SHP deficiency ameliorates hyperglycemia and preserves islet function by inhibiting apoptosis of pancreatic beta cells and up-regulating of their enriched transcriptional factors. 
Growth hormone (GH) is a key metabolic regulator mediating glucose and lipid metabolism. Ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) is a member of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase superfamily and regulates cell cycle progression. The orphan nuclear receptor small heterodimer partner (SHP: NR0B2) plays a pivotal role in regulating metabolic processes. Here, we studied the role of ATM on GH-dependent regulation of hepatic gluconeogenesis in the liver. GH induced phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) and glucose 6-phosphatase gene expression in primary hepatocytes. GH treatment and adenovirus-mediated STAT5 overexpression in hepatocytes increased glucose production, which was blocked by a JAK2 inhibitor, AG490, dominant negative STAT5, and STAT5 knockdown. We identified a STAT5 binding site on the PEPCK gene promoter using reporter assays and point mutation analysis. Up-regulation of SHP by metformin-mediated activation of the ATM-AMP-activated protein kinase pathway led to inhibition of GH-mediated induction of hepatic gluconeogenesis, which was abolished by an ATM inhibitor, KU-55933. Immunoprecipitation studies showed that SHP physically interacted with STAT5 and inhibited STAT5 recruitment on the PEPCK gene promoter. GH-induced hepatic gluconeogenesis was decreased by either metformin or Ad-SHP, whereas the inhibition by metformin was abolished by SHP knockdown. Finally, the increase of hepatic gluconeogenesis following GH treatment was significantly higher in the liver of SHP null mice compared with that of wild-type mice. Overall, our results suggest that the ATM-AMP-activated protein kinase-SHP network, as a novel mechanism for regulating hepatic glucose homeostasis via a GH-dependent pathway, may be a potential therapeutic target for insulin resistance.
In differentiated gonochoristic species, a bipotential gonad develops into an ovary or testis during sex differentiation. Knowledge about this process is necessary to improve methods for masculinizing genetically female Atlantic cod for the subsequent purpose of producing all-female populations.
Gonads were examined histologically in juveniles from 14 to 39 mm total body length (TL). Number and size of germ cells were determined in a subset of the samples. Relevant genes were cloned, and mRNA levels determined by qPCR of amh, cyp19a1a; dax1 (nr0b2); shp (nr0b2a) and sox9b in a mixed-sex and an all-female population ranging from 12-49 mm TL.
Individuals between 14-20 mm TL could be separated in two subgroups based on gonad size and germ cell number. Ovarian cavity formation was observed in some individuals from 18-20 mm TL. The mixed sex population displayed bimodal expression patterns as regards cyp19a1a (starting at 12 mm TL) and amh (starting at 20 mm TL) mRNA levels. After approximately 30 mm TL, cyp19a1a and amh displayed a gradual increase in both sexes. No apparent, sex-dependent expression patterns were found for dax1, shp or sox9b transcripts. However, shp levels were high until the larvae reached around 35 mm TL and then dropped to low levels, while dax1 remained low until 35 mm TL, and then increased sharply.
The morphological sex differentiation in females commenced between 14-20 mm TL, and ovarian cavities were evident by 18-20 mm TL. Testis development occurred later, and was morphologically evident after 30 mm TL. This pattern was corroborated with sexually dimorphic expression patterns of cyp19a1a from 12-13 mm TL, and a male-specific increase in amh from 20 mm TL.
Growth hormone (GH) is a counter-regulatory hormone that plays an important role in preventing hypoglycemia during fasting. Because inhibition of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) by pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (PDK4) conserves substrates for gluconeogenesis, we tested whether GH increases PDK4 expression in liver by a signaling pathway sensitive to inhibition by metformin. The effects of GH and metformin were determined in the liver of wild-type, small heterodimer partner (SHP)-, PDK4-, and signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (STAT5)-null mice. Administration of GH in vivo increased PDK4 expression via a pathway dependent on STAT5 phosphorylation. Metformin inhibited the induction of PDK4 expression by GH via a pathway dependent on AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and SHP induction. The increase in PDK4 expression and PDC phosphorylation by GH was reduced in STAT5-null mice. Metformin decreased GH-mediated induction of PDK4 expression and metabolites in wild-type but not in SHP-null mice. In primary hepatocytes, dominant-negative mutant-AMPK and SHP knockdown prevented the inhibitory effect of metformin on GH-stimulated PDK4 expression. SHP directly inhibited STAT5 association on the PDK4 gene promoter. Metformin inhibits GH-induced PDK4 expression and metabolites via an AMPK-SHP-dependent pathway. The metformin-AMPK-SHP network may provide a novel therapeutic approach for the treatment of hepatic metabolic disorders induced by the GH-mediated pathway.
Nuclear receptors (NRs) comprise one of the most abundant classes of transcriptional regulators of metabolic diseases and have emerged as promising pharmaceutical targets. Small heterodimer partner (SHP; NR0B2) is a unique orphan NR lacking a DNA-binding domain but contains a putative ligand-binding domain. SHP is a transcriptional regulator affecting multiple key biological functions and metabolic processes including cholesterol, bile acid, and fatty acid metabolism, as well as reproductive biology and glucose-energy homeostasis. About half of all mammalian NRs and several transcriptional coregulators can interact with SHP. The SHP-mediated repression of target transcription factors includes at least three mechanisms including direct interference with the C-terminal activation function 2 (AF2) coactivator domains of NRs, recruitment of corepressors, or direct interaction with the surface of NR/transcription factors. Future research must focus on synthetic ligands acting on SHP as a potential therapeutic target in a series of metabolic abnormalities. Current understanding about the pleiotropic role of SHP is examined in this paper, and principal metabolic aspects connected with SHP function will be also discussed.
IL-6 is a proinflammatory cytokine associated with the pathogenesis of hepatic diseases. Metformin is an anti-diabetic drug used for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, and orphan nuclear receptor small heterodimer partner (SHP, also known as NR0B2), a transcriptional co-repressor, plays an important role in maintaining metabolic homeostasis. Here, we demonstrate that metformin-mediated activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) increases SHP protein production and regulates IL-6-induced hepatic insulin resistance.
We investigated metformin-mediated SHP production improved insulin resistance through the regulation of an IL-6-dependent pathway (involving signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 [STAT3] and suppressor of cytokine signalling 3 [SOCS3]) in both Shp knockdown and Shp null mice.
IL-6-induced STAT3 transactivation and SOCS3 production were significantly repressed by metformin, adenoviral constitutively active AMPK (Ad-CA-AMPK), and adenoviral SHP (Ad-SHP), but not in Shp knockdown, or with the adenoviral dominant negative form of AMPK (Ad-DN-AMPK). Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP), co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) and protein localisation studies showed that SHP inhibits DNA binding of STAT3 on the Socs3 gene promoter via interaction and colocalisation within the nucleus. Upregulation of inflammatory genes and downregulation of hepatic insulin signalling by acute IL-6 treatment were observed in wild-type mice but not in Shp null mice. Finally, chronic IL-6 exposure caused hepatic insulin resistance, leading to impaired insulin tolerance and elevated gluconeogenesis, and these phenomena were aggravated in Shp null mice.
Our results demonstrate that SHP upregulation by metformin may prevent hepatic disorders by regulating the IL-6-dependent pathway, and that this pathway can help to ameliorate the pathogenesis of cytokine-mediated metabolic dysfunction.
Aberrant expressions of microRNAs, including upregulation of miR-141, are closely associated with the tumorigenesis of prostate cancer (PCa). The orphan receptor small heterodimer partner (Shp) is a co-repressor to androgen receptor (AR) and represses AR-regulated transcriptional activity.
Here, we investigated the correlation of Shp expression with the cellular level of miR-141 and its effects on AR transcriptional activity in non-malignant and malignant human prostate epithelial cell lines.
We found that Shp was downregulated in multiple PCa cell lines. The mature form of miR-141 was upregulated in PCa cells. miR-141 could target 3'-untranslated region of Shp mRNA resulting in translational suppression and RNA degradation. Moreover, enforced expression of Shp or inhibition of miR-141 function by anti-miR-141 attenuated AR-regulated transcriptional activity in AR-responsive LNCaP cells. Phenethyl isothiocyanate, a natural constituent of many edible cruciferous vegetables, increased Shp expression, downregulated miR-141, and inhibited AR transcriptional activity in LNCaP cells.
Shp is a target for miR-141 and it is downregulated in cultured human PCa cells with the involvement of upregulation of miR-141, which promotes AR transcriptional activity. Moreover, Shp and miR-141 could be targets for chemoprevention for PCa.
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains a major problem in oncology. The molecular mechanisms which underlie its pathogenesis are poorly understood. Recently the Small Heterodimer Partner (SHP), an orphan nuclear receptor, was suggested to be involved as a tumor suppressor in hepatocellular carcinoma development. To date, there are no such studies regarding fibrolamellar carcinoma, a less common variant of HCC, which usually affects young people and displays distinct morphological features. The aim of our project was to evaluate the SHP levels in typical and fibrolamellar hepatocellular carcinoma with respect to the levels of one of the cell cycle regulators, cyclin D1. We assessed the immunoreactivity levels of SHP and cyclin D1 in 48 typical hepatocellular carcinomas, 9 tumors representing the fibrolamellar variant, 29 non malignant liver tissues and 7 macroregenerative nodules. We detected significantly lower SHP immunoreactivity in hepatocellular carcinoma when compared to non malignant liver tissue. Moreover, we found that SHP immunoreactivity is reduced in fibrolamellar carcinoma when compared to typical hepatocellular carcinoma. We also found that SHP is more commonly lost in HCC which arises in the liver with steatosis. The comparison between the cyclin D1 and SHP expression revealed the negative correlation between these proteins in the high grade HCC. Our results indicate that the impact of loss of SHP protein may be even more pronounced in fibrolamellar carcinoma than in a typical form of HCC. Further investigation of mechanisms through which the loss of SHP function may influence HCC formation may provide important information in order to design more effective HCC therapy.
Panax ginseng is known to have anti-diabetic activity, but the active ingredients have not been fully explored yet. Here, we test whether ginsenoside Rg2 has an inhibitory effect on hepatic glucose production and determine its mechanism of action. Rg2 significantly inhibits hepatic glucose production and induces phosphorylations of liver kinase B1 (LKB1), AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β) in time- and concentration-dependent manners in human HepG2 hepatoma cells, and these effects were abolished in the presence of compound C, a selective AMPK inhibitor. In addition, phosphorylated form of cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB), a key transcription factor for hepatic gluconeogenesis, was decreased in time- and concentration-dependent manners. Next, gene expression of orphan nuclear receptor small heterodimer partner (SHP) was also examined. Rg2 markedly enhanced the gene expression of SHP and its direct interaction with CREB, which results in disruption of CREB·CRTC2 complex. Consequently, expressions of relevant genes such as peroxisome proliferation-activated receptor γ coactivator-1α (PGC-1α), phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) and glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase) were all significantly suppressed and these effects were also reversed in the presence of compound C. In conclusion, our results propose that ginsenoside Rg2 suppresses the hepatic glucose production via AMPK-induced phosphorylation of GSK3β and induction of SHP gene expression. Further studies are warranted to elucidate a therapeutic potential of Rg2 for type 2 diabetic patients.
Ginsenoside Re is a protopanaxatriol-type saponin isolated from Panax ginseng berry. Although anti-diabetic and anti-hyperlipidemic effects of Re have been reported by several groups, its mechanism of action is largely unknown until now. Here, we examine anti-diabetic and anti-hyperlipidemic activities of Re and action mechanism(s) in human HepG2 hepatocytes and high-fat diet fed C57BL/6J mice. Re suppresses the hepatic glucose production via induction of orphan nuclear receptor small heterodimer partner (SHP), and inhibits lipogenesis via suppression of sterol regulatory element binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c) and its target gene [fatty acid synthase (FAS), stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 (SCD1)] transcription. These effects were mediated through activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), and abolished when HepG2 cells were treated with an AMPK inhibitor, Compound C. C57BL/6J mice were randomly divided into five groups: regular diet fed group (RD), high-fat diet fed group (HFD) and the HFD plus Re (5, 10, 20 mg/kg) groups. Re treatment groups were fed a high-fat diet for 6 weeks, and then orally administered Re once a day for 3 weeks. The in vitro results are likely to hold true in an in vivo experiment, as Re markedly lowered blood glucose and triglyceride levels and protected against hepatic steatosis in high-fat diet fed C57BL/6J mice. In conclusion, the current study suggest that ginsenoside Re improves hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia through activation of AMPK, and confers beneficial effects on type 2 diabetic patients with insulin resistance and dyslipidemia.
Mixed background SHP(-/-) mice are resistant to diet-induced obesity due to increased energy expenditure caused by enhanced PGC-1α expression in brown adipocytes. However, congenic SHP(-/-) mice on the C57BL/6 background showed normal expression of PGC-1α and other genes involved in brown adipose tissue thermogenesis. Thus, we reinvestigated the impact of small heterodimer partner (SHP) deletion on diet-induced obesity and insulin resistance using congenic SHP(-/-) mice. Compared with their C57BL/6 wild-type counterparts, SHP(-/-) mice subjected to a 6 month challenge with a Western diet (WestD) were leaner but more glucose intolerant, showed hepatic insulin resistance despite decreased triglyceride accumulation and increased β-oxidation, exhibited alterations in peripheral tissue uptake of dietary lipids, maintained a higher respiratory quotient, which did not decrease even after WestD feeding, and displayed islet dysfunction. Hepatic mRNA expression analysis revealed that many genes expressed higher in SHP(-/-) mice fed WestD were direct peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARα) targets. Indeed, transient transfection and chromatin immunoprecipitation verified that SHP strongly repressed PPARα-mediated transactivation. SHP is a pivotal metabolic sensor controlling lipid homeostasis in response to an energy-laden diet through regulating PPARα-mediated transactivation. The resultant hepatic fatty acid oxidation enhancement and dietary fat redistribution protect the mice from diet-induced obesity and hepatic steatosis but accelerate development of type 2 diabetes.
Ginsenosides, which are active compounds found in ginseng (Panax ginseng), are used as antidiabetic treatments. The aim of this study was to determine whether Rb2, a type of ginsenoside, regulates hepatic gluconeogenesis through AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and the orphan nuclear receptor small heterodimer partner (SHP) in hyperlipidemic conditions used as an in vitro model of type 2 diabetes. Considering these results, we concluded that Rb2 may inhibit palmitate-induced gluconeogenesis via AMPK-induced SHP by relieving ER stress, a cause of gluconeogenesis.
Panax ginseng is a best-selling medicinal plant showing an antidiabetic activity via human, animal and in vitro studies. Among bioactive constituents found in ginseng, ginsenosides are known to be responsible for antidiabetic activity of ginseng. Ginsenoside Rb2, one of the major ginsenosides found in Asian ginseng, is shown to inhibit palmitate-induced gluconeogenesis in H4IIE rat hepatocytes via AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)-induced up-regulation of orphan nuclear receptor small heterodimer partner (SHP). Up to now, about thirteen articles were published to demonstrate that the pharmacological or physiological activities of ginsenosides are associated with AMPK, and only protopanaxatriol-type ginsenosides such as Re, Rg1 and Rg2, have been shown to suppress the hepatic glucose production. Therefore, Rb2 is the first protopanaxadiol-type ginsenoside shown to inhibit hepatic gluconeogenesis through AMPK activation. Further work will reveal whether activation of AMPK pathway by Rb2 would be beneficial to diabetic animals or type 2 diabetic patients.
Acetaminophen (APAP) overdose is a leading cause of drug-induced acute liver failure. Prolonged c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) activation plays a central role in APAP-induced liver injury; however, growth arrest and DNA damage-inducible 45 beta (GADD45β) is known to inhibit JNK phosphorylation. The orphan nuclear receptor small heterodimer partner (SHP, NR0B2) acts as a transcriptional co-repressor of various genes. The aim of the present study was to investigate the role of SHP in APAP-evoked hepatotoxicity. We used lethal (750 mg/kg) or sublethal (300 mg/kg) doses of APAP-treated wild-type (WT), Shp knockout (Shp-/-), hepatocyte-specific Shp knockout (Shphep-/-), and Shp and Gadd45β double knockout (Shp-/-Gadd45β-/-) mice for in vivo studies. Primary mouse hepatocytes were used for a comparative in vitro study. SHP deficiency protected against APAP toxicity with an increased survival rate, decreased liver damage, and inhibition of prolonged hepatic JNK phosphorylation in mice, which was independent of APAP metabolism regulation. Furthermore, Shphep-/- mice showed diminished APAP hepatotoxicity compared with WT mice. SHP-deficient primary mouse hepatocytes also showed decreased cell death and inhibition of sustained JNK phosphorylation following toxic APAP treatment. While SHP expression declined, GADD45β expression increased after APAP treatment in WT mice. In Shp-/- mice, APAP-evoked GADD45β induction was significantly enhanced. Notably, the ameliorative effects of SHP deficiency on APAP-induced liver injury were abolished in Shp-/-Gadd45β-/- mice. The current study is the first to demonstrate that hepatocyte-specific SHP deficiency protects against APAP overdose-evoked hepatotoxicity in a JNK signaling regulation and GADD45β dependent manner. SHP is suggested to be a novel therapeutic target for APAP overdose treatment.
Small heterodimer partner (SHP, NR0B2) is identified as a unique orphan nuclear receptor that acts as a transcriptional repressor. SHP plays a crucial role in the control of various physiological processes and in several diseases by regulating the expression of disease-specific genes. Non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), including long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) and microRNAs (miRNAs), are encoded of RNAs that are transcribed but not translated into proteins, which are involved in diverse developmental and cellular processes in eukaryotic organisms. Research during the past decade has identified factors participating in the regulation of ncRNAs biogenesis and function. In this review, we summarize recent findings demonstrating a critical role of SHP as a transcriptional regulator of ncRNAs expression and function.
