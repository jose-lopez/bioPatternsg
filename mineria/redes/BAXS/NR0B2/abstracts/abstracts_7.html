<!DOCTYPE html><html><head>	<meta charset="utf-8">	<title>generación de archivo html</title></head><body>LTR retrotransposons are repetitive DNA elements comprising ∼10% of the human genome. They are silenced by hypermethylation of cytosines in CpG dinucleotides and are considered parasitic DNA serving no useful function for the host genome. However, hypermethylated LTRs contain enhancer and promoter sequences and can promote tissue-specific transcription of cis-linked genes. To resolve the apparent paradox of hypermethylated LTRs possessing transcriptional activities, we studied the ERV-9 LTR retrotransposon located at the 5' border of the transcriptionally active β-globin gene locus in human erythroid progenitor and erythroleukemia K562 cells. We found that the ERV-9 LTR, containing 65 CpGs in 1.7 kb DNA, was hypermethylated (with &gt; 90% methylated CpGs). Hypermethylated LTR possessed transcriptional enhancer activity, since in vivo deletion of the LTR by CRISPR-cas9 suppressed transcription of the globin genes by &gt; 50%. ChIP-qPCR and ChIP-seq studies showed that the hypermethylated LTR enhancer spanning recurrent CCAATCG and GATA motifs associated respectively with key transcription factors (TFs) NF-Y and GATA-1 and -2 at reduced levels, compared with the unmethylated LTR in transfected LTR-reporter gene plasmids. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays with methylated LTR enhancer probe showed that the methylated probe bound both NF-Y and GATA-1 and -2 with lower affinities than the unmethylated enhancer probe. Thus, hypermethylation drastically reduced, but did not totally abolish, the binding affinities of the enhancer motifs to the key TFs to assemble the LTR-pol II transcription complex that activated transcription of cis-linked genes at reduced efficiency.
CTCF sites (binding motifs for CCCTC-binding factor, an insulator protein) are located considerable distances apart on genomes but are closely positioned in organized chromatin. The close positioning of CTCF sites is often cell type or tissue specific. Here we analyzed chromatin organization in eight CTCF sites around the β-globin locus by 3C assay and explored the roles of erythroid specific transcription activator GATA-1 and KLF1 in it. It was found five CTCF sites convergent to the locus interact with each other in erythroid K562 cells but not in non-erythroid 293 cells. The interaction was decreased by depletion of GATA-1 or KLF1. It accompanied reductions of CTCF and Rad21 occupancies and loss of active chromatin structure at the CTCF sites. Furthermore Rad21 occupancy was reduced in the β-globin locus control region (LCR) hypersensitive sites (HSs) by the depletion of GATA-1 or KLF1. The role of GATA-1 in interaction between CTCF sites was revealed by its ectopic expression in 293 cells and by deletion of a GATA-1 site in the LCR HS2. These findings indicate that erythroid specific activator GATA-1 acts at CTCF sites around the β-globin locus to establish tissue-specific chromatin organization.
Metabolism of oxidative stress is necessary for cellular survival. We have previously utilized the zebrafish as a model of the oxidative stress response. In this study, we found that gata1-expressing erythroid cells contributed to a significant proportion of total-body oxidative stress when animals were exposed to a strong pro-oxidant. RNA-seq of zebrafish under oxidative stress revealed the induction of tp53. Zebrafish carrying tp53 with a mutation in its DNA-binding domain were acutely sensitive to pro-oxidant exposure and displayed significant reactive oxygen species (ROS) and tp53-independent erythroid cell death resulting in an edematous phenotype. We found that a major contributing factor to ROS was increased basal mitochondrial respiratory rate without reserve. These data add to the concept that tp53, while classically a tumor suppressor and cell-cycle regulator, has additional roles in controlling cellular oxidative stress.
The first intronic mutations in the intron 1 GATA site (int-1-GATA) of 5-aminolevulinate synthase 2 (ALAS2) have been identified in X-linked sideroblastic anemia (XLSA) pedigrees, strongly suggesting it could be causal mutations of XLSA. However, the function of this int-1-GATA site during in vivo development remains largely unknown. Here, we generated mice lacking a 13 bp fragment, including this int-1-GATA site (T AGATAA: AGCCCC) and found that hemizygous deletion led to an embryonic lethal phenotype due to severe anemia resulting from a lack of ALAS2 expression, indicating that this non-coding sequence is indispensable for ALAS2 expression in vivo Further analyses revealed that this int-1-GATA site anchored the GATA site in intron 8 (int-8-GATA) and the proximal promoter, forming a long-range loop to enhance ALAS2 expression by an enhancer complex including GATA1, TAL1, LMO2, LDB1 and Pol II at least, in erythroid cells. However, compared with the int-8-GATA site, the int-1-GATA site is more essential for regulating ALAS2 expression through CRISPR/Cas9-mediated site-specific deletion. Therefore, the int-1-GATA site could serve as a valuable site for diagnosing XLSA in cases with unknown mutations.
The transcription factor GATA1 regulates the expression of essential erythroid and megakaryocytic differentiation genes through binding to the DNA consensus sequence WGATAR. The GATA1 protein has four functional domains, including two centrally located zinc-finger domains and two transactivation domains at the N- and C-termini. These functional domains play characteristic roles in the elaborate regulation of diversified GATA1 target genes, each of which exhibits a unique expression profile. Three types of GATA1-related hematological malignancies have been reported. One is a structural mutation in the GATA1 gene, resulting in the production of a short form of GATA1 that lacks the N-terminal transactivation domain and is found in Down syndrome-related acute megakaryocytic leukemia. The other two are cis-acting regulatory mutations affecting expression of the Gata1 gene, which have been shown to cause acute erythroblastic leukemia and myelofibrosis in mice. Therefore, imbalanced gene regulation caused by qualitative and quantitative changes in GATA1 is thought to be involved in specific hematological disease pathogenesis. In the present review, we discuss recent advances in understanding the mechanisms of differential transcriptional regulation by GATA1 during erythroid differentiation, with special reference to the binding kinetics of GATA1 at conformation-specific binding sites.
Gray platelet syndrome is named after the gray appearance of platelets due to the absence of α-granules. It is caused by recessive mutations in NBEAL2, resulting in macrothrombocytopenia and myelofibrosis. Though using the term gray platelets for GATA1 deficiency has been debated, a reduced number of α-granules has been described for macrothrombocytopenia due to GATA1 mutations. We compared platelet size and number of α-granules for two NBEAL2 and two GATA1-deficient patients and found reduced numbers of α-granules for all, with the defect being more pronounced for NBEAL2 deficiency. We further hypothesized that the granule defect for GATA1 is due to a defective control of NBEAL2 expression. Remarkably, platelets from two patients, and Gata1-deficient mice, expressed almost no NBEAL2. The differentiation of GATA1 patient-derived CD34+ stem cells to megakaryocytes showed defective proplatelet and α-granule formation with strongly reduced NBEAL2 protein and ribonucleic acid expression. Chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing revealed 5 GATA binding sites in a regulatory region 31 kb upstream of NBEAL2 covered by a H3K4Me1 mark indicative of an enhancer locus. Luciferase reporter constructs containing this region confirmed its enhancer activity in K562 cells, and mutagenesis of the GATA1 binding sites resulted in significantly reduced enhancer activity. Moreover, DNA binding studies showed that GATA1 and GATA2 physically interact with this enhancer region. GATA1 depletion using small interfering ribonucleic acid in K562 cells also resulted in reduced NBEAL2 expression. In conclusion, we herein show a long-distance regulatory region with GATA1 binding sites as being a strong enhancer for NBEAL2 expression.
Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are heterogeneous diseases of the hematopoietic stem cell in the elderly. Anemia is the main symptom that mostly correlates with dysplastic erythropoiesis in the bone marrow. We will review the recent advances in understanding the diverse mechanisms of dyserythropoiesis.
Dyserythropoiesis defined as 10% dysplastic erythroid cells in the bone marrow is found in more than 80% of early MDS. Immature erythroblasts accumulate at the expense of mature erythroblasts due to differentiation arrest and apoptosis. In early MDS with dyserythropoiesis, caspase-dependent cleavage of the erythroid transcription factor GATA-1 occurring in basophilic erythroblasts accounts for impairment of final maturation. Depending on initiating genetic alteration, specific mechanisms contribute to erythroid defect. In MDS with 5q deletion, the haploinsufficiency of ribosomal protein gene, RPS14, opposes the transition of immature to mature erythroblasts by inducing a p53-dependent ribosome stress, cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Recent work identifies the activation of a p53-S100A8/9 innate immune pathway that both intrinsically and extrinsically contributes to defective erythropoiesis. In MDS with ring sideroblasts, a paradigm of dyserythropoiesis, a unique mutation in SF3B1 splicing factor gene induces a multiplicity of alterations at RNA level that deeply modifies the patterns of gene expression.
Insights in the pathophysiology of MDS with dyserythropoiesis may guide the choice of the appropriate therapy, for instance lenalidomide in MDS with del(5q). A better understanding of the mechanisms of dyserthropoiesis is required to treat anemia in non-del(5q) MDS, especially in case of resistance to first-line therapy by erythropoiesis-stimulating agents.
The reported antitumor activity of the BET family bromodomain inhibitors has prompted the development of inhibitors against other bromodomains. However, the human genome encodes more than 60 different bromodomains and most of them remain unexplored.
We report that the bromodomains of the histone acetyltransferases CREBBP/EP300 are critical to sustain the proliferation of human leukemia and lymphoma cell lines. EP300 is very abundant at super-enhancers in K562 and is coincident with sites of GATA1 and MYC occupancy. In accordance, CREBBP/EP300 bromodomain inhibitors interfere with GATA1- and MYC-driven transcription, causing the accumulation of cells in the G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle. The CREBBP/CBP30 bromodomain inhibitor CBP30 displaces CREBBP and EP300 from GATA1 and MYC binding sites at enhancers, resulting in a decrease in the levels of histone acetylation at these regulatory regions and consequently reduced gene expression of critical genes controlled by these transcription factors.
Our data shows that inhibition of CREBBP/EP300 bromodomains can interfere with oncogene-driven transcriptional programs in cancer cells and consequently hold therapeutic potential.
Chionodraco hamatus is a teleost within the suborder Notothenioidei, the members of which are known to lack functional erythrocytes with modified hematopoiesis. Hematopoiesis is an essential process during the development of animals, where it is tightly regulated by many different transcription factors, signaling proteins, chromatin modifications, and microRNAs (miRNAs). The miRNAs are known to regulate the expression of their target genes at the post-transcriptional level. However, little is known about the miRNA-mediated regulation of hematopoiesis. In this study, we confirmed that miR-152 plays a crucial role in hematopoiesis during the development of C. hamatus. The overexpression of miR-152 reduced hematopoiesis according to the decreased expression of GATA1 and reduced o-dianisidine staining of hemoglobin. Mechanistically, reduced hematopoiesis was regulated by the miR-152-mediated down-regulated expression of GATA1. Bioinformatics analysis was used to predict the target gene of miR-152. Western blotting as well as dual luciferase and EGFP reporter assays were employed to investigate the expression of GATA1 mediated by miR-152. Finally, verification experiments in the zebrafish autologous model strongly supported the effect of miR-152 on hematopoiesis. In conclusion, we suggest that miR-152 is a novel molecular factor that regulates hematopoiesis during the development of C. hamatus by down-regulating the expression of GATA1.
We earlier reported that the male mice lacking the Wdr13 gene (Wdr13-/0) showed mild anxiety, better memory retention, and up-regulation of synaptic proteins in the hippocampus. With increasing evidences from parallel studies in our laboratory about the possible role of Wdr13 in stress response, we investigated its role in brain. We observed that Wdr13 transcript gets up-regulated in the hippocampus of the wild-type mice exposed to stress. To further dissect its function, we analyzed the behavioral and molecular phenotypes of Wdr13-/0 mice when subjected to mild chronic psychological stress, namely; mild (attenuated) social isolation. We employed iTRAQ based quantitative proteomics, real time PCR and western blotting to investigate molecular changes. Three weeks of social isolation predisposed Wdr13-/0 mice to anhedonia, heightened anxiety-measured by Open field test (OFT), increased behavior despair- measured by Forced swim test (FST) and reduced dendritic branching along with decreased spine density of hippocampal CA1 neurons as compared to wild-type counterparts. This depression-like-phenotype was however ameliorated when treated with anti-depressant imipramine. Molecular analysis revealed that out of 1002 quantified proteins [1% False discovery rate (FDR), at-least two unique peptides], strikingly, a significant proportion of synaptic proteins including, SYN1, CAMK2A, and RAB3A were down-regulated in the socially isolated Wdr13-/0 mice as compared to its wild-type counterparts. This was in contrast to the elevated levels of these proteins in non-stressed mutants as compared to the controls. We hypothesized that a de-regulated transcription factor upstream of the synaptic genes might be responsible for the observed phenotype. Indeed, in the socially isolated Wdr13-/0 mice, there was an up-regulation of GATA1 - a transcription factor that negatively regulates synaptic genes and has been associated with Major Depression (MD) in humans. The present study demonstrates significant genotype × enviornment interaction for Wdr13 gene as shown by the reversal in the expression levels of several synaptic proteins in the mutant vis-à-vis wild-type mouse when exposed to social isolation stress.
Somatic mutations in the calreticulin (CALR) gene have been found in most patients with JAK2- and MPL-unmutated Philadelphia chromosome-negative myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs). It has recently been shown that mutant CALR constitutively activates the thrombopoietin receptor MPL and, thus, plays a causal role in the development of MPNs. However, the roles of mutant CALR in human haematopoietic cell differentiation remain predominantly elusive. To examine the impact of the 5-base insertion mutant CALR gene (Ins5) on haematopoietic cell differentiation, we generated induced pluripotent stem cells from an essential thrombocythaemia (ET) patient harbouring a CALR-Ins5 mutation and from a healthy individual (WT). Megakaryopoiesis was more prominent in Ins5-haematopoietic progenitor cells (Ins5-HPCs) than in WT-HPCs, implying that the system recapitulates megakaryocytosis observed in the bone marrow of CALR-mutant ET patients. Ins5-HPCs exhibited elevated expression levels of GATA1 and GATA2, suggesting a premature commitment to megakaryocytic differentiation in progenitor cells. We also demonstrated that 3-hydroxy anagrelide markedly perturbed megakaryopoiesis, but not erythropoiesis. Collectively, we established an in vitro model system that recapitulates megakaryopoiesis caused by mutant CALR. This system can be used to validate therapeutic compounds for MPN patients harbouring CALR mutations and in detailed studies on mutant CALR in human haematological cell differentiation.
TAL1 (SCL/TAL1, T-cell acute leukemia protein 1) is a transcription factor that is involved in the process of hematopoiesis and leukemogenesis. It participates in blood cell formation, forms mesoderm in early embryogenesis, and regulates hematopoiesis in adult organisms. TAL1 is essential in maintaining the multipotency of hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) and keeping them in quiescence (stage G0). TAL1 forms complexes with various transcription factors, regulating hematopoiesis (E2A/HEB, GATA1-3, LMO1-2, Ldb1, ETO2, RUNX1, ERG, FLI1). In these complexes, TAL1 regulates normal myeloid differentiation, controls the proliferation of erythroid progenitors, and determines the choice of the direction of HSC differentiation. The transcription factors TAL1, E2A, GATA1 (or GATA2), LMO2, and Ldb1 are the major components of the SCL complex. In addition to normal hematopoiesis, this complex may also be involved in the process of blood cell malignant transformation. Upregulation of C-KIT expression is one of the main roles played by the SCL complex. Today, TAL1 and its partners are considered promising therapeutic targets in the treatment of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia.
Chemoresistance is a major unmet clinical obstacle in ovarian cancer treatment. Epigenetics plays a pivotal role in regulating the malignant phenotype, and has the potential in developing therapeutically valuable targets that improve the dismal outcome of this disease. Here we show that a series of transcription factors, including C/EBPβ, GCM1, and GATA1, could act as potential modulators of histone methylation in tumor cells. Of note, C/EBPβ, an independent prognostic factor for patients with ovarian cancer, mediates an important mechanism through which epigenetic enzyme modifies groups of functionally related genes in a context-dependent manner. By recruiting the methyltransferase DOT1L, C/EBPβ can maintain an open chromatin state by H3K79 methylation of multiple drug-resistance genes, thereby augmenting the chemoresistance of tumor cells. Therefore, we propose a new path against cancer epigenetics in which identifying and targeting the key regulators of epigenetics such as C/EBPβ may provide more precise therapeutic options in ovarian cancer.
The possibility of sphingosine-1-phosphate production by induced pluripotent stem cells is examined to assess their potential in treatment of sepsis. The hematopoietic embryoid bodies were derived from the culture of 6-day-old differentiated induced pluripotent stem cells. These embryoid bodies secreted sphingosine-1-phosphate, an important bioactive lipid that regulates integrity of the pulmonary endothelial barrier, prevents elevation of its permeability, and impedes the formation of stress fibers in human endotheliocytes derived from umbilical vein. The data attest to potentiality of induced pluripotent stem cells in treatment of sepsis.
This study aimed to determine GATA1 expression levels to better characterize subgroups in BCR/ABL1-negative myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs).
This study enrolled 49 patients diagnosed as having BCR/ABL1-negative MPN on the basis of the 2016 World Health Organization classification : nine polycythemia vera (PV), 17 essential thrombocythemia (ET), 12 prefibrotic primary myelofibrosis (prePMF), and 11 overt primary myelofibrosis (PMF). Relevant clinical and laboratory data were retrieved from the medical records. The molecular analysis of CALR and MPL mutations and quantification of JAK2 V617F allele burden were performed. GATA1 expression was assessed by an immunohistochemical assay on bone marrow biopsy. GATA1 expression was analyzed serially in 18 patients.
GATA1 expression decreased significantly in PMF compared with that in other subtypes, while no statistical difference was identified between ET and prePMF. GATA1 expression did not differ according to the mutation profiles or the allele burden of JAK2 V617F, but it decreased significantly in patients with overt fibrosis or leukemic transformation.
Our results suggest that GATA1 expression is significantly low in PMF and decreases with progressive fibrosis and possibly with leukemic transformation, although our attempt to accurately distinguish between subgroups using GATA1 immunohistochemical approach did not achieve statistical significance. A large patient cohort with long term follow-up is required to evaluate the prognostic value of GATA1 expression.
Histone H3 trimethylation at lysine 36 (H3K36me3) is an important histone mark involved in both transcription elongation and DNA mismatch repair (MMR). It is known that H3K36me3 recruits the mismatch-recognition protein MutSα to replicating chromatin via its physical interaction with MutSα's PWWP domain, but the exact role of H3K36me3 in transcription is undefined. Using ChIP combined with whole-genome DNA sequencing analysis, we demonstrate here that H3K36me3, together with MutSα, is involved in protecting against mutation, preferentially in actively transcribed genomic regions. We found that H3K36me3 and MutSα are much more co-enriched in exons and actively transcribed regions than in introns and nontranscribed regions. The H3K36me3-MutSα co-enrichment correlated with a much lower mutation frequency in exons and actively transcribed regions than in introns and nontranscribed regions. Correspondingly, depleting H3K36me3 or disrupting the H3K36me3-MutSα interaction elevated the spontaneous mutation frequency in actively transcribed genes, but it had little influence on the mutation frequency in nontranscribed or transcriptionally inactive regions. Similarly, H2O2-induced mutations, which mainly cause base oxidations, preferentially occurred in actively transcribed genes in MMR-deficient cells. The data presented here suggest that H3K36me3-mediated MMR preferentially safeguards actively transcribed genes not only during replication by efficiently correcting mispairs in early replicating chromatin but also during transcription by directly or indirectly removing DNA lesions associated with a persistently open chromatin structure.
The roles of RNA 5-methylcytosine (RNA:m5C) and RNA:m5C methyltransferases (RCMTs) in lineage-associated chromatin organization and drug response/resistance are unclear. Here we demonstrate that the RCMTs, namely NSUN3 and DNMT2, directly bind hnRNPK, a conserved RNA-binding protein. hnRNPK interacts with the lineage-determining transcription factors (TFs), GATA1 and SPI1/PU.1, and with CDK9/P-TEFb to recruit RNA-polymerase-II at nascent RNA, leading to formation of 5-Azacitidine (5-AZA)-sensitive chromatin structure. In contrast, NSUN1 binds BRD4 and RNA-polymerase-II to form an active chromatin structure that is insensitive to 5-AZA, but hypersensitive to the BRD4 inhibitor JQ1 and to the downregulation of NSUN1 by siRNAs. Both 5-AZA-resistant leukaemia cell lines and clinically 5-AZA-resistant myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid leukaemia specimens have a significant increase in RNA:m5C and NSUN1-/BRD4-associated active chromatin. This study reveals novel RNA:m5C/RCMT-mediated chromatin structures that modulate 5-AZA response/resistance in leukaemia cells, and hence provides a new insight into treatment of leukaemia.
Blood cell formation is classically thought to occur through a hierarchical differentiation process, although recent studies have shown that lineage commitment may occur earlier in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs). The relevance to human blood diseases and the underlying regulation of these refined models remain poorly understood. By studying a genetic blood disorder, Diamond-Blackfan anemia (DBA), where the majority of mutations affect ribosomal proteins and the erythroid lineage is selectively perturbed, we are able to gain mechanistic insight into how lineage commitment is programmed normally and disrupted in disease. We show that in DBA, the pool of available ribosomes is limited, while ribosome composition remains constant. Surprisingly, this global reduction in ribosome levels more profoundly alters translation of a select subset of transcripts. We show how the reduced translation of select transcripts in HSPCs can impair erythroid lineage commitment, illuminating a regulatory role for ribosome levels in cellular differentiation.
Identifying the Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) with functions in insect fecundity promises to provide novel insight into genetic mechanisms of adaptation and to aid in effective control of insect populations. We previously identified several SNPs within the vitellogenin (Vg) promoter region between a high-fecundity population (HFP) and a low-fecundity population (LFP) of the brown planthopper, Nilaparvata lugens Stål (Hemiptera: Delphacidae). Here, we found that an A-to-T (HFP allele to LFP allele) transversion at nucleotide -953 upstream of Vg in a Nilaparvata lugens GATA-1 (NlGATA-1) binding motif is associated with the level of Vg transcription. We also characterized NlGATA-1, containing a double CX2 CX17 CX2 C zinc finger, which has been implicated in the activation of Vg gene expression. Knockdown of the NlGATA-1 gene results in a reduced basal level of expression of the Vg gene and fewer offspring of N. lugens in vivo, whereas overexpression of NlGATA-1 in cells increased Vg promoter activity. Moreover, upon cotransfection with NlGATA-1 expression vector, the luciferase activities of Vg reporter vectors with the A allele were significantly higher than those with the T allele. These findings support a mechanism in which a SNP within the promoter of Vg is associated with the level of Vg transcription by altering the binding activity of NlGATA-1 and subsequently affecting fecundity in N. lugens.
Myeloid proliferative disorders associated with Down syndrome (MPD-DS), including transient abnormal myelopoiesis and myeloid leukemia associated with Down syndrome (DS), harbor mutations of GATA1, a transcription factor essential for erythroid and megakaryocytic development. These mutations result in a N-terminally truncated GATA1 (GATA1s) and prohibit the production of the full-length GATA1 (GATA1f). Here, we demonstrate the utility of immunohistochemical GATA1f reactivity in diagnosing MPD-DS.
Immunohistochemical studies for GATA1f expression were performed on bone marrow biopsy specimens.
In all cases of MPD-DS, megakaryocytes lacked GATA1f expression. In contrast, GATA1f expression was detected in megakaryocytes in all specimen types from patients without DS (normal bone marrows, pediatric myelodysplastic syndrome, juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia, adult acute megakaryocytic leukemia [pediatric and adult; without trisomy 2]), as well as normal bone marrows from patients with DS.
The lack of GATA1f expression is a sensitive and specific immunohistochemical marker for MPD-DS.
Erythroid Krüppel-like factor (EKLF/KLF1) is an erythroid-specific transcription factor whose activity is essential for erythropoiesis. The underlying mechanisms for EKLF specifically restricted to erythroid cells are of great interest but remain incompletely understood. To explore the epigenetic regulation of EKLF expression by promoter DNA methylation, we investigated the methylation status of the EKLF promoter and EKLF gene expression from a panel of human tissues. We observed that erythroid-specific hypomethylation of the EKLF promoter in adult erythroid cells was positively associated with EKLF expression. Demethylation of the EKLF promoter by 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine led to elevated EKLF expression in non-erythroid cells. We further uncovered that EKLF promoter DNA methylation reduced the binding affinity for the transcription factors GATA1 and c-myb (MYB), which in turn silenced EKLF expression. These results suggest that hypomethylation of the EKLF promoter has functional significance in the establishment and maintenance of erythroid-specific gene expression.
Single-nucleotide variants that underlie phenotypic variation can affect chromatin occupancy of transcription factors (TFs). To delineate determinants of in vivo TF binding and chromatin accessibility, we introduce an approach that compares ChIP-seq and DNase-seq data sets from genetically divergent murine erythroid cell lines. The impact of discriminatory single-nucleotide variants on TF ChIP signal enables definition at single base resolution of in vivo binding characteristics of nuclear factors GATA1, TAL1, and CTCF. We further develop a facile complementary approach to more deeply test the requirements of critical nucleotide positions for TF binding by combining CRISPR-Cas9-mediated mutagenesis with ChIP and targeted deep sequencing. Finally, we extend our analytical pipeline to identify nearby contextual DNA elements that modulate chromatin binding by these three TFs, and to define sequences that impact kb-scale chromatin accessibility. Combined, our approaches reveal insights into the genetic basis of TF occupancy and their interplay with chromatin features.
Leukemias, a heterogeneous group of hematological disorders, are characterized by ineffective hematopoiesis and morphologic abnormalities of hematopoietic cells. Thrombocytopenia is a common problem among leukemia types that can lead to hemorrhagic complications in patients. The purpose of this review article is to identify the conditions associated with the incidence of thrombocytopenia in leukemias. It can be stated that although translocations have been considered responsible for this complication in many studies, other factors such as bone marrow failure, genes polymorphism, a mutation in some transcription factors, and the adverse effects of treatment could be associated with pathogenesis and poor prognosis of thrombocytopenia in leukemias. Considering the importance of thrombocytopenia in leukemias, it is hoped that the recognition of risk factors increasing the incidence of this complication in leukemic patients would be useful for prevention and treatment of this disorder.
Lasting antibody responses are maintained by long-lived plasma cells, which are thought to lodge in the BM in specialized survival niches. Eosinophils have been reported to function as a critical component of the BM survival niche where they are thought to provide pro-survival signals to nearby plasma cells. Recent study shows that many BM plasma cells are recently generated and chiefly short-lived cells, raising the possibility that rare plasma cell-eosinophil interactions are a rate-limiting step needed to establish lasting humoral immunity. To address these issues, we examined the impact of eosinophil depletion on short- and long-lived BM plasma cells in the context of antibody responses induced by both T-cell dependent and T-cell independent antigens. Surprisingly, our results failed to support a role for eosinophils in either plasma cell generation or survival. These studies included examination of plasma cell frequencies in mice lacking eosinophils either after antibody-mediated depletion, or due to mutation of the GATA1 locus.
Ribosomal proteins (RP) regulate specific gene expression by selectively translating subsets of mRNAs. Indeed, in Diamond-Blackfan anemia and 5q- syndrome, mutations in RP genes lead to a specific defect in erythroid gene translation and cause anemia. Little is known about the molecular mechanisms of selective mRNA translation and involvement of ribosomal-associated factors in this process. Ribonuclease inhibitor 1 (RNH1) is a ubiquitously expressed protein that binds to and inhibits pancreatic-type ribonucleases. Here, we report that RNH1 binds to ribosomes and regulates erythropoiesis by controlling translation of the erythroid transcription factor GATA1. Rnh1-deficient mice die between embryonic days E8.5 and E10 due to impaired production of mature erythroid cells from progenitor cells. In Rnh1-deficient embryos, mRNA levels of Gata1 are normal, but GATA1 protein levels are decreased. At the molecular level, we found that RNH1 binds to the 40S subunit of ribosomes and facilitates polysome formation on Gata1 mRNA to confer transcript-specific translation. Further, RNH1 knockdown in human CD34+ progenitor cells decreased erythroid differentiation without affecting myelopoiesis. Our results reveal an unsuspected role for RNH1 in the control of GATA1 mRNA translation and erythropoiesis.
GATA1, the founding member of a family of transcription factors, plays important roles in the development of hematopoietic cells of several lineages. Although loss of GATA1 has been known to impair hematopoiesis in animal models for nearly 25 years, the link between GATA1 defects and human blood diseases has only recently been realized. Areas covered: Here the current understanding of the functions of GATA1 in normal hematopoiesis and how it is altered in disease is reviewed. GATA1 is indispensable mainly for erythroid and megakaryocyte differentiation. In erythroid cells, GATA1 regulates early stages of differentiation, and its deficiency results in apoptosis. In megakaryocytes, GATA1 controls terminal maturation and its deficiency induces proliferation. GATA1 alterations are often found in diseases involving these two lineages, such as congenital erythroid and/or megakaryocyte deficiencies, including Diamond Blackfan Anemia (DBA), and acquired neoplasms, such as acute megakaryocytic leukemia (AMKL) and the myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs). Expert commentary: Since the first discovery of GATA1 mutations in AMKL, the number of diseases that are associated with impaired GATA1 function has increased to include DBA and MPNs. With respect to the latter, we are only just now appreciating the link between enhanced JAK/STAT signaling, GATA1 deficiency and disease pathogenesis.
Transition from pluripotency to differentiation is a pivotal yet poorly understood developmental step. Here, we show that the tumour suppressor RASSF1A is a key player driving the early specification of cell fate. RASSF1A acts as a natural barrier to stem cell self-renewal and iPS cell generation, by switching YAP from an integral component in the β-catenin-TCF pluripotency network to a key factor that promotes differentiation. We demonstrate that epigenetic regulation of the Rassf1A promoter maintains stemness by allowing a quaternary association of YAP-TEAD and β-catenin-TCF3 complexes on the Oct4 distal enhancer. However, during differentiation, promoter demethylation allows GATA1-mediated RASSF1A expression which prevents YAP from contributing to the TEAD/β-catenin-TCF3 complex. Simultaneously, we find that RASSF1A promotes a YAP-p73 transcriptional programme that enables differentiation. Together, our findings demonstrate that RASSF1A mediates transcription factor selection of YAP in stem cells, thereby acting as a functional "switch" between pluripotency and initiation of differentiation.
Compacted chromatin and nucleosomes are known barriers to gene expression; the nature and relative importance of other transcriptional constraints remain unclear, especially at distant enhancers. Polycomb repressor complex 2 (PRC2) places the histone mark H3K27me3 predominantly at promoters, where its silencing activity is well documented. In adult tissues, enhancers lack H3K27me3, and it is unknown whether intergenic H3K27me3 deposits affect nearby genes. In primary intestinal villus cells, we identified hundreds of tissue-restricted enhancers that require the transcription factor (TF) CDX2 to prevent the incursion of H3K27me3 from adjoining areas of elevated basal marking into large well-demarcated genome domains. Similarly, GATA1-dependent enhancers exclude H3K27me3 from extended regions in erythroid blood cells. Excess intergenic H3K27me3 in both TF-deficient tissues is associated with extreme mRNA deficits, which are significantly rescued in intestinal cells lacking PRC2. Explaining these observations, enhancers show TF-dependent binding of the H3K27 demethylase KDM6A. Thus, in diverse cell types, certain genome regions far from promoters accumulate H3K27me3, and optimal gene expression depends on enhancers clearing this repressive mark. These findings reveal new "anti-repressive" function for hundreds of tissue-specific enhancers.
Hemocytes, the cellular component of invertebrate hemolymph, are essential for invertebrate immunity, but the hematopoiesis and regulation mechanism are still largely unknown. In the present study, a conserved hematopoietic transcription factor Cg-GATA2/3 was identified in Pacific oyster Crassotrea gigas, which was evolutionarily close to the vertebrate GATA1/2/3. Cg-GATA2/3 was mainly distributed in the immune organs, such as gill, hemocytes, and mantle. After Cg-GATA2/3 was interferenced by dsRNA, the mRNA expressions of hemocytes specific gene (EcSOD) and hematopoietic transcription factor (C-Myb) were all significant down-regulated, and the hemocyte renewal rates also decreased both in hemolymph and gill. During the larval developmental stages, the mRNA transcripts of Cg-GATA2/3 increased immediately after fertilization and kept a high level during blastula and early trochophore larvae stage (4-10 hpf, hours post fertilization), then decreased sharply in early D-veliger larvae stage (15 hpf). Whole-mount immunofluorescence assay further revealed that the abundant immunoreactivity of Cg-GATA2/3 was distributed in the whole body of blastula and gastrula embryos, while specialized gradually to a ring structure around the dorsal region in trochophore larvae. In the D-veliger and umbo larvae, scattered positive signals appeared in the specific sinus structure on the dorsal side and velum region. These results demonstrated that Cg-GATA2/3 was a hematopoietic lineage-specific transcription factor to regulate the hemocyte production, and it could also be used as hematopoietic specific marker to trace potential developmental events of hematopoiesis during ontogenesis of oyster.
Diamond-Blackfan anemia (DBA) is a rare congenital bone marrow failure syndrome that exhibits an erythroid-specific phenotype. In at least 70% of cases, DBA is related to a haploinsufficient germ line mutation in a ribosomal protein (RP) gene. Additional cases have been associated with mutations in GATA1. We have previously established that the RPL11+/Mut phenotype is more severe than RPS19+/Mut phenotype because of delayed erythroid differentiation and increased apoptosis of RPL11+/Mut erythroid progenitors. The HSP70 protein is known to protect GATA1, the major erythroid transcription factor, from caspase-3 mediated cleavage during normal erythroid differentiation. Here, we show that HSP70 protein expression is dramatically decreased in RPL11+/Mut erythroid cells while being preserved in RPS19+/Mut cells. The decreased expression of HSP70 in RPL11+/Mut cells is related to an enhanced proteasomal degradation of polyubiquitinylated HSP70. Restoration of HSP70 expression level in RPL11+/Mut cells reduces p53 activation and rescues the erythroid defect in DBA. These results suggest that HSP70 plays a key role in determining the severity of the erythroid phenotype in RP-mutation-dependent DBA.
ITR‑284 is a carboxamide analog that can inhibit proliferation in human promyelocytic leukemia HL-60 cells. To understand the effects and molecular mechanisms of ITR‑284 in human erythromyeloblastoid leukemia, we treated K562 cells with different concentrations of ITR‑284 (0, 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 nM) and all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) (0, 0.1, 0.5, 1, 5 and 10 µM) for 24 h. The IC50 of ITR‑284 was ~10 nM in K562 cells treated for 24 h as determined by MTT assay. May-Grünwald-Giemsa staining and nitro blue tetrazolium (NBT) assays were used to determine cell morphology changes and differentiation after ITR‑284 and ATRA treatment. In addition, mRNA expression levels of hematopoietic factors, including GATA‑1, NF-E2 and GATA‑2, were elevated, while expression levels of BCR‑ABL were downregulated in K562 cells after 24 h of treatment with ITR‑284 as determined by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. In addition, western blot analyses showed that FOXM1, GLI 1 and c-MYC protein levels were decreased by ITR‑284. Taken together, our data show that ITR‑284 induced K562 cell differentiation, which led to decreased tumorigenesis. Our findings suggest that ITR‑284 could be a potential candidate for treating chronic myelogenous leukemia.
Erythropoiesis is the process by which new red blood cells (RBCs) are formed and defects in this process can lead to anemia or thalassemia. The GATA1 transcription factor is an established mediator of RBC development. However, the upstream mechanisms that regulate the expression of GATA1 are not completely characterized. Cholesterol is 1 potential upstream mediator of GATA1 expression because previously published studies suggest that defects in cholesterol synthesis disrupt RBC differentiation. Here we characterize RBC development in a zebrafish harboring a single missense mutation in the hmgcs1 gene (Vu57 allele). hmgcs1 encodes the first enzyme in the cholesterol synthesis pathway and mutation of hmgcs1 inhibits cholesterol synthesis. We analyzed the number of RBCs in hmgcs1 mutants and their wild-type siblings. Mutation of hmgcs1 resulted in a decrease in the number of mature RBCs, which coincides with reduced gata1a expression. We combined these experiments with pharmacological inhibition and confirmed that cholesterol and isoprenoid synthesis are essential for RBC differentiation, but that gata1a expression is isoprenoid dependent. Collectively, our results reveal 2 novel upstream regulators of RBC development and suggest that appropriate cholesterol homeostasis is critical for primitive erythropoiesis.
Studies of allelic variation underlying genetic blood disorders have provided important insights into human hematopoiesis. Most often, the identified pathogenic mutations result in loss-of-function or missense changes. However, assessing the pathogenicity of noncoding variants can be challenging. Here, we characterize two unrelated patients with a distinct presentation of dyserythropoietic anemia and other impairments in hematopoiesis associated with an intronic mutation in GATA1 that is 24 nucleotides upstream of the canonical splice acceptor site. Functional studies demonstrate that this single-nucleotide alteration leads to reduced canonical splicing and increased use of an alternative splice acceptor site that causes a partial intron retention event. The resultant altered GATA1 contains a five-amino acid insertion at the C-terminus of the C-terminal zinc finger and has no observable activity. Collectively, our results demonstrate how altered splicing of GATA1, which reduces levels of the normal form of this master transcription factor, can result in distinct changes in human hematopoiesis.
The c-Myb gene encodes a transcription factor that regulates cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis through protein-protein interaction and transcriptional regulation of signaling pathways. The protein is frequently overexpressed in human leukemias, breast cancers, and other solid tumors suggesting that it is a bona fide oncogene. c-MYB is often overexpressed by translocation in human tumors with t(6;7)(q23;q34) resulting in c-MYB-TCRβ in T cell ALL, t(X;6)(p11;q23) with c-MYB-GATA1 in acute basophilic leukemia, and t(6;9)(q22-23;p23-24) with c-MYB-NF1B in adenoid cystic carcinoma. Antisense oligonucleotides to c-MYB were developed to purge bone marrow cells to eliminate tumor cells in leukemias. Recently, small molecules that inhibit c-MYB activity have been developed to disrupt its interaction with p300. The Dmp1 (cyclin D binding myb-like protein 1; Dmtf1) gene was isolated through its virtue for binding to cyclin D2. It is a transcription factor that has a Myb-like repeat for DNA binding. The Dmtf1 protein directly binds to the Arf promoter for transactivation and physically interacts with p53 to activate the p53 pathway. The gene is hemizygously deleted in 35-42% of human cancers and is associated with longer survival. The significances of aberrant expression of c-MYB and DMTF1 proteins in human cancers and their clinical significances are discussed.
Erythroid cell commitment and differentiation proceed through activation of a lineage-restricted transcriptional network orchestrated by a group of cell fate determining and maturing factors. We previously set out to define the minimal set of factors necessary for instructing red blood cell development using direct lineage reprogramming of fibroblasts into induced erythroid progenitors/precursors (iEPs). We showed that overexpression of Gata1, Tal1, Lmo2, and c-Myc (GTLM) can rapidly convert murine and human fibroblasts directly to iEPs that resemble bona fide erythroid cells in terms of morphology, phenotype, and gene expression. We intend that iEPs will provide an invaluable tool to study erythropoiesis and cell fate regulation. Here we describe the stepwise process of converting murine tail tip fibroblasts into iEPs via transcription factor-driven direct lineage reprogramming (DLR). In this example, we perform the reprogramming in fibroblasts from erythroid lineage-tracing mice that express the yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) under the control of the erythropoietin receptor gene (EpoR) promoter, enabling visualization of erythroid cell fate induction upon reprogramming. Following this protocol, fibroblasts can be reprogrammed into iEPs within five to eight days. While improvements can still be made to the process, we show that GTLM-mediated reprogramming is a rapid and direct process, yielding cells with properties of bona fide erythroid progenitor and precursor cells.
Benign neutropenia, observed in different ethnic groups, is the most common form of neutropenia worldwide. A specific single nucleotide polymorphism, rs2814778, located at the promoter of the ACKR1 (previously termed DARC) gene, which disrupts a binding site for the GATA1 erythroid transcription factor, resulting in a ACKR1-null phenotype, was found to serve as a predictor of low white blood cell and neutrophil counts in African-Americans and Yemenite Jews. Individuals with benign neutropenia due to the ACKR1-null allele have been found to have an increased susceptibility to human immunodeficiency virus infection and, on the other hand, a protective effect against malaria. The associated protective effect may explain the spread of the ACKR1-null allele by natural selection. The reviewed relationships between ACKR1 polymorphism and various pathological states may have important clinical implications to individuals with and without benign neutropenia. Potential mechanisms for ACKR1 (previously termed DARC) modulation during neutrophil recruitment to inflammation, and chemokine bioavailability in the circulation and in local tissue are reviewed and discussed.
Arteries and veins are formed independently by different types of endothelial cells (ECs). In vascular remodeling, arteries and veins become connected and some arteries become veins. It is unclear how ECs in transforming vessels change their type and how fates of individual vessels are determined. In embryonic zebrafish trunk, vascular remodeling transforms arterial intersegmental vessels (ISVs) into a functional network of arteries and veins. Here we find that, once an ISV is connected to venous circulation, venous blood flow promotes upstream migration of ECs that results in displacement of arterial ECs by venous ECs, completing the transformation of this ISV into a vein without trans-differentiation of ECs. Arterial blood flow initiated in two neighboring ISVs prevents their transformation into veins by activating Notch signaling in ECs. Together, different responses of ECs to arterial and venous blood flow lead to formation of a balanced network with equal numbers of arteries and veins.
The production of blood cells and their precursors from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) in vitro has the potential to make a significant impact upon healthcare provision. We demonstrate that the forward programming of hPSCs through overexpression of GATA1, FLI1, and TAL1 leads to the production of a population of progenitors that can differentiate into megakaryocyte or erythroblasts. Using "rainbow" lentiviral vectors to quantify individual transgene expression in single cells, we demonstrate that the cell fate decision toward an erythroblast or megakaryocyte is dictated by the level of FLI1 expression and is independent of culture conditions. Early FLI1 expression is critical to confer proliferative potential to programmed cells while its subsequent silencing or maintenance dictates an erythroid or megakaryocytic fate, respectively. These committed progenitors subsequently expand and mature into megakaryocytes or erythroblasts in response to thrombopoietin or erythropoietin. Our results reveal molecular mechanisms underlying hPSC forward programming and novel opportunities for application to transfusion medicine.
Transcription factors bind regulatory DNA sequences in a combinatorial manner to modulate gene expression. Deep neural networks (DNNs) can learn the cis-regulatory grammars encoded in regulatory DNA sequences associated with transcription factor binding and chromatin accessibility. Several feature attribution methods have been developed for estimating the predictive importance of individual features (nucleotides or motifs) in any input DNA sequence to its associated output prediction from a DNN model. However, these methods do not reveal higher-order feature interactions encoded by the models.
We present a new method called Deep Feature Interaction Maps (DFIM) to efficiently estimate interactions between all pairs of features in any input DNA sequence. DFIM accurately identifies ground truth motif interactions embedded in simulated regulatory DNA sequences. DFIM identifies synergistic interactions between GATA1 and TAL1 motifs from in vivo TF binding models. DFIM reveals epistatic interactions involving nucleotides flanking the core motif of the Cbf1 TF in yeast from in vitro TF binding models. We also apply DFIM to regulatory sequence models of in vivo chromatin accessibility to reveal interactions between regulatory genetic variants and proximal motifs of target TFs as validated by TF binding quantitative trait loci. Our approach makes significant strides in improving the interpretability of deep learning models for genomics.

E26 transformation-specific (ETS) gene family contains a common DNA-binding domain, the ETS domain, responsible for sequence-specific DNA recognition on target promoters. The Fli-1 oncogene, a member of ETS gene family, plays a critical role in hematopoiesis and is overexpressed in diverse hematological malignancies. This ETS transcription factor regulates genes controlling several hallmarks of cancer and thus represents an excellent target for cancer therapy. By screening compounds isolated from the medicinal plant Dysoxylum binectariferum in China, we identified two chemically related flavagline-like compounds including 4'-demethoxy-3',4'-methylenedioxyrocaglaol and rocaglaol that strongly inhibited Fli-1 transactivation ability. These compounds altered expression of Fli-1 target genes including GATA1, EKLF, SHIP1, and BCL2. Consequently, the flavagline-like compounds suppressed proliferation, induced apoptosis, and promoted erythroid differentiation of leukemic cells in culture. These compounds also suppressed erythroleukemogenesis in vivo in a Fli-1-driven mouse model. Mechanistically, the compounds blocked c-Raf-MEK-MAPK/ERK signaling, reduced phosphorylation of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E), and inhibited Fli-1 protein synthesis. Consistent with its high expression in myelomas, B-cell lymphoma, and B chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL), pharmacological inhibition of Fli-1 by the flavagline-like compounds or genetic knock-down via shRNA significantly hindered proliferation of corresponding cell lines and patients' samples. These results uncover a critical role of Fli-1 in growth and survival of various hematological malignancies and point to flavagline-like agents as lead compounds for the development of anti-Fli-1 drugs to treat leukemias/lymphomas overexpressing Fli-1.
It has long been considered that hematopoietic system development is based on hematopoietic stem cell differentiation with a gradual loss of multipotency. However, recent studies have indicated that hematopoietic stem cells are composed of subsets that exhibit lineage skewing, thereby comprising a heterogeneous population. Therefore, the present hierarchical development model of the hematopoietic system may be reconsidered. Appropriate transcription regulators and epigenetic influences are required for cell differentiation. To this end, transcription factors, such as GATA1 for erythropoiesis and PU.1 for myelopoiesis, have been believed to play key roles at the initiation of hematopoietic cell differentiation. However, the mechanisms controlling the expression of these transcription factors are controlled, and the points at which the lineage commitments occur from hematopoietic stem cells through to progenitor cells are not fully elucidated. As per the findings of this study, we propose that the regulation of transcription and epigenetic factors are central events in hematopoietic cell differentiation.
Sea cucumber Apostichopus japonicus rely on the efficient innate immune mechanisms against invaders, in which the consumption and regeneration of coelomocytes take place at the same time. In the present study, histological features of putative hematopoietic tissues (HPTs) including the rete mirabile, the respiratory tree, the polian vesicle and the coelomic epithelium were characterized. The distribution of transcription factor GATA1 in coelomocytes and putative HPTs was examined by immunohistochemistry. In addition, cell proliferation using EdU labeling and coelomocyte distribution in different tissues using monoclonal antibody labeling were analyzed to further confirm the HPTs. The results showed that two homologs of GATA1 were detected with molecular weight of 43 and 90 kDa in coelomocytes, rete mirabile, respiratory tree and polian vesicle, whereas no signals were detected in the coelomic epithelium. A few cells were detected to be EdU-positive for coelomocytes, which accounted for approximately 9.5%. In the rete mirabile and the respiratory tree, the EdU signals were strong in cells of the tube wall. In the polian vesicle, numerous EdU-positive cells were detected in the cyst wall. In the coelomic epithelium, little EdU signaling was detected. Immunohistochemistry analysis by mAb 3F6 against A. japonicus coelomocytes showed that positive signals were observed in the tube wall of the rete mirabile, respiratory tree, cyst wall of the polian vesicle and in the coelomocyte antrum of coelomic epithelium. These results suggest that the rete mirabile, respiratory tree and polian vesicle are the HPTs of A. japonicus.
Stem cell leukemia (Scl or Tal1) and lymphoblastic leukemia 1 (Lyl1) encode highly related members of the basic helix-loop-helix family of transcription factors that are co-expressed in the erythroid lineage. Previous studies have suggested that Scl is essential for primitive erythropoiesis. However, analysis of single-cell RNA-seq data of early embryos showed that primitive erythroid cells express both Scl and Lyl1 Therefore, to determine whether Lyl1 can function in primitive erythropoiesis, we crossed conditional Scl knockout mice with mice expressing a Cre recombinase under the control of the Epo receptor, active in erythroid progenitors. Embryos with 20% expression of Scl from E9.5 survived to adulthood. However, mice with reduced expression of Scl and absence of Lyl1 (double knockout; DKO) died at E10.5 because of progressive loss of erythropoiesis. Gene expression profiling of DKO yolk sacs revealed loss of Gata1 and many of the known target genes of the SCL-GATA1 complex. ChIP-seq analyses in a human erythroleukemia cell line showed that LYL1 exclusively bound a small subset of SCL targets including GATA1. Together, these data show for the first time that Lyl1 can maintain primitive erythropoiesis.
The differentiation of megakaryocytes from human pluripotent stem cells in vitro offers intriguing new perspectives for research and transfusion medicine. However, applications have been hampered by the low efficiency of cytokine driven differentiation protocols leading to poor megakaryocyte purity and yield. Here we describe a novel forward programming approach relying on the combined ectopic expression of the three transcription factors GATA1, FLI1, and TAL1 in human pluripotent stem cells for large scale production of mature megakaryocytes using chemically defined culture and minimum cytokines.
The identification of transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) is a problem for which computational methods offer great hope. Thus far, the expectation maximization (EM) technique has been successfully utilized in finding TFBSs in DNA sequences, but inappropriate initialization of EM has yielded poor performance or running time scalability under a given data set. In this study, we used a sequential integration approach that defined the final solution as the set of solutions acquired from solving objectives in a cascade manner to integrate the fuzzy C-means and the EM approaches to DNA motif discovery. The new method is explained in detail and tested on the chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) data sets for different transcription factors (TFs) with various motif patterns. The proposed algorithm also suggests an efficient process for analyzing motif similarity to known motifs as well as finding a target motif. A comparison of results with those of the well-known motif-finding tool, MEME-ChIP, shows the advantages of our proposed framework over this existing tool. Experimental results show that we were able to find the true motifs for all TFs, and that the motifs found by our proposed algorithm were more similar to JASPAR-known motifs for the STAT1, GATA1, and JUN TFs than those found by MEME-ChIP.
By functioning as an enzyme cofactor, hemoglobin component, and gene regulator, heme is vital for life. One mode of heme-regulated transcription involves amplifying the activity of GATA-1, a key determinant of erythrocyte differentiation. To discover biological consequences of the metal cofactor-transcription factor mechanism, we merged GATA-1/heme-regulated sectors of the proteome and transcriptome. This multi-omic analysis revealed a GATA-1/heme circuit involving hemoglobin subunits, ubiquitination components, and proteins not implicated in erythrocyte biology, including the zinc exporter Slc30a1. Though GATA-1 induced expression of Slc30a1 and the zinc importer Slc39a8, Slc39a8 dominantly increased intracellular zinc, which conferred erythroblast survival. Subsequently, a zinc transporter switch, involving decreased importer and sustained exporter expression, reduced intracellular zinc during terminal differentiation. Downregulating Slc30a1 increased intracellular zinc and, strikingly, accelerated differentiation. This analysis established a conserved paradigm in which a GATA-1/heme circuit controls trace metal transport machinery and trace metal levels as a mechanism governing cellular differentiation.
Hemogen is a vertebrate transcription factor that performs important functions in erythropoiesis and testicular development and may contribute to neoplasia. Here we identify zebrafish Hemogen and show that it is considerably smaller (∼22 kDa) than its human ortholog (∼55 kDa), a striking difference that is explained by an underlying modular structure. We demonstrate that Hemogens are largely composed of 21-25 amino acid repeats, some of which may function as transactivation domains (TADs). Hemogen expression in embryonic and adult zebrafish is detected in hematopoietic, renal, neural and gonadal tissues. Using Tol2- and CRISPR/Cas9-generated transgenic zebrafish, we show that Hemogen expression is controlled by two Gata1-dependent regulatory sequences that act alone and together to control spatial and temporal expression during development. Partial depletion of Hemogen in embryos by morpholino knockdown reduces the number of erythrocytes in circulation. CRISPR/Cas9-generated zebrafish lines containing either a frameshift mutation or an in-frame deletion in a putative, C-terminal TAD display anemia and embryonic tail defects. This work expands our understanding of Hemogen and provides mutant zebrafish lines for future study of the mechanism of this important transcription factor.
The Xga and CD99 antigens of the human Xg blood group system show a unique and sex-specific phenotypic relationship. The phenotypic relationship is believed to result from transcriptional coregulation of the XG and CD99 genes, which span the pseudoautosomal boundary of the X and Y chromosomes. However, the molecular genetic background responsible for these blood groups has remained undetermined. During the present investigation, we initially conducted a pilot study aimed at individuals with different Xga/CD99 phenotypes; this used targeted next-generation sequencing of the genomic areas relevant to XG and CD99 This was followed by a large-scale association study that demonstrated a definite association between a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs311103 and the Xga/CD99 blood groups. The G and C genotypes of SNP rs311103 were associated with the Xg(a+)/CD99H and Xg(a-)/CD99L phenotypes, respectively. The rs311103 genomic region with the G genotype was found to have stronger transcription-enhancing activity by reporter assay, and this occurred specifically with erythroid-lineage cells. Such activity was absent when the same region with the C genotype was investigated. In silico analysis of the polymorphic rs311103 genomic regions revealed that a binding motif for members of the GATA transcription factor family was present in the rs311103[G] region. Follow-up investigations showed that the erythroid GATA1 factor is able to bind specifically to the rs311103[G] region and markedly stimulates the transcriptional activity of the rs311103[G] segment. The present findings identify the genetic basis of the erythroid-specific Xga/CD99 blood group phenotypes and reveal the molecular background of their formation.
Molecular regulation of cell fate decisions underlies health and disease. To identify molecules that are active or regulated during a decision, and not before or after, the decision time point is crucial. However, cell fate markers are usually delayed and the time of decision therefore unknown. Fortunately, dividing cells induce temporal correlations in their progeny, which allow for retrospective inference of the decision time point. We present a computational method to infer decision time points from correlated marker signals in genealogies and apply it to differentiating hematopoietic stem cells. We find that myeloid lineage decisions happen generations before lineage marker onsets. Inferred decision time points are in agreement with data from colony assay experiments. The levels of the myeloid transcription factor PU.1 do not change during, but long after the predicted lineage decision event, indicating  that the PU.1/GATA1 toggle switch paradigm cannot explain the initiation of early myeloid lineage choice.
Endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) are a group of rare cells that play an important role in the repair of injured vascular endothelial cells and assist in reperfusion of ischemic tissue. Decreased production and/or loss of function of EPCs are associated with diabetic vasculopathy. The molecular mechanisms by which diabetes impairs EPCs remain unclear. We conducted microarray experiments followed by integrative regulatory analysis on cells isolated from Akita diabetic mice (18-weeks after onset of diabetes) and age-matched non-diabetic controls. Two types of cells were isolated from mice bone marrow; Lin+ cells and Lin-/VEGF-R2+ EPCs. RNA was hybridized to mouse WG-6 V2 beadchips followed by comprehensive gene network analysis and computational validation of the obtained results. In total, 80 genes were exclusively DE between non-diabetic Lin-/VEGF-R2+ EPCs and diabetic Lin-/VEGF-R2+ EPCs, of which the 3 genes Clcnka, Pik3c2a, and Ptf1a are known to be associated with diabetic complications. Further analysis led to the establishment of a TF-miRNA mediated regulatory network specific to diabetic Lin-/VEGF-R2+ EPCs and to identify 11 central-hub TFs (Tbp, Ahr, Trp53, Gata1, Foxo1, Foxo4, Yy1, Max, Pparg, Myc, Cebpa), and 2 miRNAs (mir-139-5p, mir-709) that might act as putative genomic drivers of diabetic pathogenesis in Lin-/VEGF-R2+ EPCs. Moreover, we identified multiple TF-miRNA co-regulatory network motifs for which we validated their contribution to diabetic Lin-/VEGF-R2+ EPCs in terms of statistical significance and relevance to biological evidence. Our findings suggest that diabetic Lin-/VEGF-R2+ EPCs have specifically altered signature genes and miRNAs that render their capacity to proliferate and differentiate.
Transcriptional regulation of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) is critically involved in the pathogenesis and progression of rheumatoid arthritis (RA); however, the specific transcription factors that control this process remain largely unidentified. In the present study, it was discovered that expression of the key erythroid factor, globin transcription factor 1 (GATA1), is significantly greater in human RA synovial tissues than in osteoarthritis (OA) tissues. IL 6 was found to induce synovial GATA1 expression in a signal transducer and activator of transcription 3-dependent manner. Functionally, knockdown of GATA1 expression using specific small interfering RNA treatment was found to compromise immunoreaction-elicited expression of proinflammatory cytokines and thus impair invasiveness of the human fibroblast-like synovial cell line MH7A, whereas introduction of exogenous GATA1 was found to promote production of proinflammatory cytokines, leading to greater aggressiveness of MH7A cells. Mechanistically, GATA1 acts as the transcriptional coactivator of NOS2 (the gene encoding iNOS) transcription. Collectively, these data suggest that synovial GATA1 is an essential contributor to development and exacerbation of RA, presumably by inducing NOS2 transcription.
Hematopoietic stem cells require MLL1, which is one of six Set1/Trithorax-type histone 3 lysine 4 (H3K4) methyltransferases in mammals and clinically the most important leukemia gene. Here, we add to emerging evidence that all six H3K4 methyltransferases play essential roles in the hematopoietic system by showing that conditional mutagenesis of Setd1b in adult mice provoked aberrant homeostasis of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs). Using both ubiquitous and hematopoietic-specific deletion strategies, the loss of Setd1b resulted in peripheral thrombo- and lymphocytopenia, multilineage dysplasia, myeloid-biased extramedullary hematopoiesis in the spleen, and lethality. By transplantation experiments and expression profiling, we determined that Setd1b is autonomously required in the hematopoietic lineages where it regulates key lineage specification components, including Cebpa, Gata1, and Klf1. Altogether, these data imply that the Set1/Trithorax-type epigenetic machinery sustains different aspects of hematopoiesis and constitutes a second framework additional to the transcription factor hierarchy of hematopoietic homeostasis.
Peroxisome proliferator activator receptor (PPAR)-binding protein (PBP) is an important coactivator for PPARgamma and other nuclear receptors. It has been identified as an integral component of a multiprotein thyroid hormone receptor-associated protein/vitamin D(3) receptor-interacting protein/activator-recruited cofactor complexes required for transcriptional activity. Here, we show that PBP is critical for the development of placenta and for the normal embryonic development of the heart, eye, vascular, and hematopoietic systems. The primary functional cause of embryonic lethality at embryonic day11.5 observed with PBP null mutation was cardiac failure because of noncompaction of the ventricular myocardium and resultant ventricular dilatation. There was a paucity of retinal pigment, defective lens formation, excessive systemic angiogenesis, a deficiency in the number of megakaryocytes, and an arrest in erythrocytic differentiation. Some of these defects involve PPARgamma and retinoid-sensitive sites, whereas others have not been recognized in the PPAR-signaling pathway. Phenotypic changes in four organ systems observed in PBP null mice overlapped with those in mice deficient in members of GATA, a family of transcription factors known to regulate differentiation of megakaryocytes, erythrocytes, and adipocytes. We demonstrate that PBP interacts with all five GATA factors analyzed, GATA-1, GATA-2, GATA-3, GATA-4, and GATA-6, and show that the binding of GATA-1, GATA-4, and GATA-6 to PBP is not dependent on the nuclear receptor recognition sequence motif LXXLL (where L is leucine and X is any amino acid) in PBP. Coexpression of PBP with GATA-3 markedly enhanced transcriptional activity of GATA-3 in nonhematopoietic cells. These observations identify the GATA family of transcription factors as a new interacting partner of PBP and demonstrate that PBP is essential for normal development of vital organ systems.
Bile acid biosynthesis is subjected to feedback regulation whereby bile acids down-regulate their own synthesis. The major point of this regulation is at the level of cholesterol 7alpha-hydroxylase (7alpha-hydroxylase), which controls bile acid output from the classic pathway. This regulation is at the level of transcription of the gene. Two bile acid response elements have been localized within the 5'-flanking region of the rat gene and these elements overlap three nuclear receptor binding sites for hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF-4), liver X receptor (LXR) and alpha(1)-fetoprotein transcription factor (FTF). Recently it has been shown that bile acids are physiological ligands for the farnesyl X receptor (FXR), which suggested that FXR could function by binding to one of the three nuclear receptor sites to mediate regulation of 7alpha-hydroxylase transcription by bile acids. In this study we show that FXR is indeed a crucial factor for bile acid-mediated regulation, but that it functions without binding to DNA. Furthermore, we also demonstrate that neither the LXR nor the HNF-4 sites are involved in bile acid-mediated regulation of 7alpha-hydroxylase transcription. Most importantly, we show that the FTF site is essential for regulation of 7alpha-hydroxylase by bile acids, similar to what we have recently demonstrated for another gene of the bile acid biosynthetic pathway, the sterol 12alpha-hydroxylase gene. These studies demonstrate the crucial role of FTF in the expression and regulation of a critical gene in the bile acid biosynthetic pathways.
Hepatic SR-BI mediates uptake of circulating cholesterol into liver hepatocytes where a part of the cholesterol is metabolised to bile acids. In the hepatocytes, bile acids reduce their own synthesis by a negative feedback loop to prevent toxic high levels of bile acids. Bile acid-activated FXR/RXR represses expression of CYP7A1, the rate-limiting enzyme during bile acid synthesis, by inducing the expression of SHP, which inhibits LXR/RXR and LRH-1-transactivation of CYP7A1. The present paper presents data indicating that CDCA suppresses SR-BI expression by the same pathway. As previously reported, LRH-1 induces SR-BI promoter activity. Here we show that CDCA or over-expression of SHP inhibit this transactivation. No FXR-response element was identified in the bile acid-responsive region of the SR-BI promoter (-1200bp/-937bp). However, a binding site for LRH-1 was characterised and shown to specifically bind LRH-1. The present study shows that also the SR-BI-mediated supply of cholesterol, the substrate for bile acid synthesis, is feedback regulated by bile acids.
Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) is a platelet alpha-granule protein. In previous reports, we demonstrated the expression of PDGF receptors on platelets and megakaryocytic cells and that PDGF enhanced the proliferation of megakaryocytic progenitor cells. In this study, we investigated the effects of PDGF on mRNA and protein expressions of megakaryocyte-associated transcription factors, c-Fos, GATA-1, NF-E2 and PU.1, in two human megakaryocytic cell lines CHRF-288-11 and DAMI. RT-PCR/Southern blot analysis and Real-time PCR demonstrated that PDGF increased the mRNA expression of c-Fos, GATA-1 and NF-E2, but not PU.1 in a dose- and time-dependent manner. The activation was confirmed at the protein level by Western blot analysis of both total cell and nuclear lysates. The addition of increasing concentrations of Tyrphostin AG1295, an inhibitor of PDGF receptor kinase, blocked the stimulatory effect of PDGF on the mRNA and protein expressions of these transcription factors. The up-regulation of c-Fos, GATA-1 and NF-E2 protein by PDGF was inhibited by actinomycin D and cycloheximide, suggesting that mRNA and protein synthesis might be involved in the mechanism. Our data suggest a direct stimulatory effect of PDGF on c-Fos, GATA-1 and NF-E2 expressions and we speculate that these transcription factors might be involved in the signal transduction of PDGF on the regulation of megakaryocytopoiesis.
Erythroid cell-specific gene regulation during terminal differentiation is controlled by transcriptional regulators, such as EKLF and GATA1, that themselves exhibit tissue-restricted expression patterns. Their early expression, already in evidence within multipotential hematopoietic cell lines, has made it difficult to determine what extracellular effectors and transduction mechanisms might be directing the onset of their own transcription during embryogenesis. To circumvent this problem, we have taken the novel approach of investigating whether the ability of embryonic stem (ES) cells to mimic early developmental patterns of cellular expression during embryoid body (EB) differentiation can address this issue. We first established conditions whereby EBs could form efficiently in the absence of serum. Surprisingly, in addition to mesoderm, these cells expressed hemangioblast and hematopoietic markers. However, they did not express the committed erythroid markers EKLF and GATA1, nor the terminally differentiated beta-like globin markers. Using this system, we determined that EB differentiation in BMP4 was necessary and sufficient to recover EKLF and GATA1 expression and could be further stimulated by the inclusion of VEGF, SCF, erythropoietin and thyroid hormone. EBs were competent to respond to BMP4 only until day 4 of differentiation, which coincides with the normal onset of EKLF expression. The direct involvement of the BMP/Smad pathway in this induction process was further verified by showing that erythroid expression of a dominant negative BMP1B receptor or of the inhibitory Smad6 protein prevented induction of EKLF or GATA1 even in the presence of serum. Although Smad1, Smad5 and Smad8 are all expressed in the EBs, BMP4 induction of EKLF and GATA1 transcription is not immediate. These data implicate the BMP/Smad induction system as being a crucial pathway to direct the onset of EKLF and GATA1 expression during hematopoietic differentiation and demonstrate that EB differentiation can be manipulated to study induction of specific genes that are expressed early within a lineage.
Human FcgammaRIIA, expressed on platelets, neutrophils, and macrophages, plays a major role in platelet activation and immune clearance. Clinical observations indicate that regulation of expression of this receptor is an important factor influencing the course of immune thrombocytopenia. We used both transient transfection with FcgammaRIIA promoter constructs and electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) to study the regulation of FcgammaRIIA transcription. In HEL (erythromegakaryocytic) cells, the 200 bp immediately 5' of the ATG start codon accounted for the majority of the activity of a 3.6-kb promoter fragment. Putative GATA (-161) and NF-Y (-119) sites are present. EMSA analyses demonstrate specific binding of both GATA-1 and GATA-2 to labeled oligonucleotides containing the putative GATA site with HEL but not U937 (myelomonocytic) nuclear extracts. Antibodies to NF-Y supershift the specific -119 NF-Y complex with HEL, U937, Jurkat (T-lymphocytic), and HeLa (nonhematopoietic) nuclear extracts. Comparison of the activity of GATA and NF-Y mutant constructs in HEL and U937 demonstrates that while either GATA or NF-Y mutation results in a large decrease in the promoter activity (2.2- and 2.3-fold, respectively) in HEL cells, neither mutation is effective in reducing activity in U937 cells. This is the first example of a promoter active in the megakaryocyte lineage in which NF-Y cooperates additively with GATA factors to regulate transcription. Identification of other factors that must be operational for FcgammaRIIA transcription in myelomonocytic cells which lack GATA factors will bolster our ongoing efforts to dissect the function of these Fc receptors in megakaryocytic and myelomonocytic cells in vivo.
CC Chemokine Receptor 3 (CCR3), the major chemokine receptor expressed on eosinophils, binds promiscuously to several ligands including eotaxins 1, 2, and 3. Even though the only cells that consistently accumulate following eotaxin administration in vivo are myeloid cells (primarily eosinophils), other cell types have recently been shown to express CCR3. It is therefore important to elucidate the molecular mechanisms regulating receptor expression.
In order to define regions responsible for CCR3 transcription, a DNAse hypersensitive site was identified in the vicinity of exon 1. Coupled with our previous data implicating exon 1 in CCR3 transcription, we hypothesized that transcription factors bind to exon-1. Electrophoretic mobility shift analysis revealed that nuclear proteins in eosinophilic cells bound to exon 1. Furthermore, antibody interference and mutation studies demonstrated GATA-1 binding to exon 1. In order to test the 1.6-kb CCR3 promoter element (that includes exon 1) for in vivo function, this region was used to generate transgenic mice that expressed a reporter protein. Strong transgene expression was achieved, with the pattern of expression suggesting a broad acting promoter.
The transcription factor GATA-1 binds to CCR3 exon 1. The 1.6-kb CCR3 promoter element, that includes exon 1, is a strong promoter in vivo.
The effects of Notch signals on the erythroid/megakaryocytic differentiation of hematopoietic cells were examined. Activation of Notch signals by the intracellular Notch1 or an estradiol-inducible form of Notch1/ER suppressed the expression of the erythroid marker glycophorin A in an erythroid/megakaryocytic cell line K562. Although Mock-transfected K562 cells underwent megakaryocytic differentiation in response to 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), estradiol-activated Notch1/ER induced apoptosis during TPA treatment in the transfectant, which was accompanied by the reduced expression of an antiapoptotic molecule Bcl-XL. Even when apoptosis was prevented by the overexpression of Bcl-XL, activated Notch signals still inhibited TPA-induced megakaryocytic differentiation. As for this mechanism, Notch1/recombination signal binding protein J-kappa-induced HES1 but not HES5 was found to inhibit the function of an erythroid/megakaryocytic lineage-specific transcription factor GATA-1. Although HES1 did not affect the DNA binding activity of GATA-1 in gel shift and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays, it directly bound to GATA-1 and dissociated a critical transcriptional cofactor, p300, from GATA-1. Furthermore, overexpressed HES1 inhibited the development of erythroid and megakaryocytic cells in colony assays. Also, the Notch ligand Jagged1 expressed on NIH3T3 cells suppressed the development of erythroid and megakaryocytic cells from cocultured Lin-Sca-1+ hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells. These results suggest that Notch1 inhibits the development of erythroid/megakaryocytic cells by suppressing GATA-1 activity through HES1.
The multifunctional cytokine interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) plays a central role in the body's immune and inflammatory responses. The mechanism of IL-1beta on thrombocytosis and megakaryocytopoiesis has remained controversial. In previous reports, we have demonstrated the expression of IL-1 receptors (IL-1RI and IL-1RII) and enhancing effects of IL-1beta on primary human megakaryocytic (MK) cells. In this study, we investigated the possible direct effects of IL-1beta on the expression of thrombopoietin (TPO) and transcription factors c-Jun, c-Fos, GATA-1, and p45 nuclear factor-E2 (NF-E2) in MK cell lines CHRF and Meg-01. Our results demonstrated that IL-1beta up-regulated messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein expressions of these transcription factors in a dose- and time-dependent manner. In CHRF cells, mRNA: c-Jun [3.4-fold, peaked at 15 minutes], c-Fos [4.2-fold, 15 minutes], GATA-1 [4.0-fold, 60 minutes], NF-E2 [3.2-fold, 120 minutes] and protein expression: c-Jun [3.0-fold, 30 minutes], c-Fos [1.7-fold, 30 minutes], GATA-1 [11.5-fold, 60 minutes], NF-E2 [12.5-fold, 120 minutes] were evidently enhanced after treatment with IL-1beta. The response to IL-1beta was consistent in the total cell and nuclear extracts and was significantly reduced by pretreatment with actinomycin D or cycloheximide. An IL-1-receptor antagonist (IL-1RA) inhibited the stimulatory effects of IL-1beta on these transcription factors by as much as 78%. TPO expression was increased by more than 9.9-fold on stimulation with IL-1beta. A TPO-neutralizing antibody did not significantly reduce the effects of IL-1beta. We conclude that IL-1beta up-regulates the expression of TPO, c-Jun, c-Fos, GATA-1, and NF-E2 in MK cells. The mechanism might be mediated by IL-1beta receptors and require transcription or protein synthesis. The direct involvement of IL-1beta in the MK lineage may provide an explanation for the phenomenon of thrombocytosis during inflammatory responses.
We investigated megakaryocytic differentiation in a newly-established Ph1-positive leukemic cell line, MC3, which showed tri-lineage immunophenotypes (myeloid antigens2+, CD19(1+) and CD41a1+) and was positive for CD34 and CD38. TPA induced MC3 cells to differentiate to an early stage of megakaryocyte lineage exhibiting an increase in the expression of platelet glycoproteins (GP) IIb/IIIa (CD41a), and an increase in cell size and nuclear ploidy. TPA treatment also enhanced the expression of GPIIb mRNA, and induced the expression of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and its receptor mRNAs, while it did not induce transcripts of the genes IL-11 and mpl ligand, and further decreased the transcript of the mpl gene. Consistent with these findings, MC3 cells treated with TPA showed an increased expression of GATA-1, but not GATA-3 transcripts, whereas those without TPA treatment expressed only the GATA-2 transcript. These results provide an insight into the study for the regulatory mechanism of megakaryocytopoiesis and leukemic cell differentiation.
The GATA factors are a family of transcriptional regulatory proteins in eukaryotes that share extensive homology in their DNA-binding domains. One enigmatic aspect of GATA factor expression is that several GATA proteins, which ostensibly share the same DNA-binding site specificity, are coexpressed in erythroid cells. To elucidate the roles of individual GATA factors in erythropoiesis, conditional alleles of GATA-1, GATA-2, and GATA-3 were prepared by fusing each of the factors to the hormone-binding domain of the human estrogen receptor (ER). These GATA/ER chimeric factors were shown to be hormone-inducible trans-activating proteins in transient transfection assays. When stably introduced into primary erythroblasts or conditionally transformed erythroid progenitors cells, exogenous GATA-2/ER promoted proliferation and inhibited terminal differentiation in an estrogen-dependent manner. These phenotypic effects are specifically attributable to the action of ectopically expressed GATA-2/ER because erythroblasts expressing exogenous GATA-2 are constitutively arrested in differentiation and because erythroid progenitors expressing either Gal/ER or GATA-3/ER do not display a hormone-responsive block in differentiation. Thus, the GATA-2 transcription factor appears to play a role in regulating the self-renewal capacity of early erythroid progenitor cells.
Erythroid differentiation leads to the production of red blood cells that contain a high level of hemoglobin. This level is mainly regulated by globin gene transcription during development and differentiation. Although numerous cis-acting sequences are involved in transcriptional activity of globin genes, combinations of three motifs, CCACC, SP1 and GATA represent the core elements of their regulatory sequences. These combinations are also found in promoters and/or enhancers of non-globin genes specifically expressed in the late stages of erythroid differentiation. The CCACC and SP1 sequences bind proteins that do not display erythrocytic specificity, and the GATA sequences bind a family of transacting factors recently cloned. The GATA family members are distinctive for a highly homologous DNA binding domain that exists in two zinc fingers reminiscent of those of the glucocorticoid receptor. None of the GATA family members displays only erythroid specificity, but gene disruption followed by rescue indicates that GATA-1 is necessary for terminal erythroid differentiation throughout development. The GATA/SP1 and GATA/CCACC associations are present in positive, negative or inducible regulatory sequences suggesting that other elements control the fine tuning of erythroid gene expression. NF-E2, which is a major transcriptional activator, members of the ets family which are implicated in the early stages of erythropoiesis and finally c-erbA which directly regulates a set of erythroid-specific genes are proteins that bind these latter regulatory motifs.
Osteoclasts are of hematopoietic origin. The mechanism by which hematopoietic stem cells are specified to the osteoclast lineage is unclear. To understand the process of generation and differentiation of this lineage of cells, we performed in vitro studies on the differentiation of embryonic stem cells.
We examined the potential of mutant embryonic stem cell lines harboring targeted deletions of the GATA-1, FOG, SCL/tal-1, or GATA-2 genes to differentiate into osteoclasts and determined when these molecules function in osteoclast development.
The lack of GATA-1 or FOG did not affect osteoclastogenesis. In contrast, SCL/tal-1-null embryonic stem cells generated no osteoclasts. In the case of the loss of GATA-2, a small number of osteoclasts were generated. GATA-2-null osteoclasts were morphologically normal and the terminal maturation was not disturbed, but a defect was observed in the generation of osteoclast progenitors. Experiments using specific inhibitors that block the signaling through macrophage colony-stimulating factor and osteoclast differentiation factor/osteoprotegerin ligand suggested that GATA-2 seems to act earlier in osteoclastogenesis than these cytokines. Interestingly, macrophage colony-forming units were not severely reduced by the loss of GATA-2 compared to osteoclast progenitors.
These results indicate that osteocalsts need SCL/tal-1 at an early point in development, and that GATA-2 is required for generation of osteoclast progenitors but not for the later stages when macrophage colony-stimulating factor and osteoclast differentiation factor/ osteoprotegerin ligand are needed. We also demonstrated that osteoclast progenitors behave as a different population than macrophage colony-forming units.
The transcription factor GATA-2 is expressed in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells and is functionally implicated in their survival and proliferation. We have used estrogen and tamoxifen-inducible forms of GATA-2 to modulate the levels of GATA-2 in the IL-3-dependent multipotential hematopoietic progenitor cell model FDCP mix. Ligand-dependent induction of exogenous GATA-2 activity did not rescue cells deprived of IL-3 from apoptosis. However, induction of GATA-2 activity in cells cultured in IL-3 blocked factor-dependent self-renewal but not factor-dependent survival: Cells undergo cell cycle arrest and cease proliferating but do not apoptose. This was accompanied by differentiation down the monocytic and granulocytic pathways. Differentiation occurred in the presence of IL-3 and did not require addition of exogenous differentiation growth factors such as G-CSF or GM-CSF normally required to induce granulomonocytic differentiation of FDCP-mix cells. Conversely, EPO-dependent erythroid differentiation was inhibited by GATA-2 activation. These biological effects were obtained with levels of exogenous GATA-2 representing less than twofold increases over endogenous GATA-2 levels and were not observed in cells overexpressing GATA-1/ER. Similar effects on proliferation and differentiation were also observed in primary progenitor cells, freshly isolated from murine bone marrow and transduced with a GATA-2/ER-containing retrovirus. Taken together, these data suggest that threshold activities of GATA-2 in hematopoietic progenitor cells are a critical determinant in influencing self-renewal versus differentiation outcomes.
Key regulatory regions necessary for the expression of the gene encoding FcepsilonRI alpha-chain, a component of the high-affinity IgE receptor primarily responsible for IgE-dependent allergic response, were investigated. Two regions, -74/-69 and -55/-47, which contained binding motifs for proteins belonging to the Ets family and the GATA family, respectively, were shown to be necessary for the activation of the alpha-chain promoter. Both the regulatory elements enhanced the promoter activity only in alpha-chain-producing cells PT18 and RBL-2H3 (mast cell lines), indicating that the elements required specific trans-acting proteins present in the alpha-chain-producing cells. EMSA using nuclear extracts and in vitro-translated proteins revealed that Elf-1 and GATA-1 bound to the enhancer elements. This is the first report describing the regulation in the expression of the FcepsilonRI alpha-chain.
Eosinophils contribute to the pathophysiology of allergic and infectious diseases, albeit their molecular functions remain unknown. Mature eosinophils are identified by their unique morphology and staining characteristics. However, it is difficult to fractionate living eosinophils by flow cytometry because these granulocytes express multiple cell surface markers that are shared by other cells of hematopoietic or non-hematopoietic origin. In this study, we describe a flow cytometry-based method to enumerate and fractionate eosinophils by developmental stages. To fractionate these cell types, we used transgenic mouse lines that express fluorescent proteins under control of the Gata1 gene hematopoietic regulatory region (Gata1-HRD), which is exclusively active in Gata1-expressing hematopoietic cells, including eosinophils. As expected, mature eosinophils were highly enriched in the fluorescent reporter-expressing subfraction of bone marrow myeloid cells that were negatively selected by using multiple antibodies against B220, CD4, CD8, Ter119, c-Kit and CD71. Cytochemical analyses of flow-sorted cells identified the cells in this fraction as eosinophils harboring eosinophilic granules. Additionally, expression of eosinophil-specific genes, for instance eosinophil enzymes and the IL-5 receptor alpha gene, were specifically detected in this fraction. The expression of these eosinophil-specific genes increased as the cells differentiated. This method for enrichment of bone marrow eosinophils is applicable to fractionation of eosinophils and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from transgenic mice with atopic asthma. Thus, both pathological and developmental stages of eosinophils are efficiently fractionated by this flow cytometry-based method using Gata1-HRD transgenic reporter mice. This study, therefore, proposes a useful means to study the experimental allergic and inflammatory systems.
When the orphan nuclear receptors TR2 and TR4, the DNA-binding subunits of the DRED repressor complex, are forcibly expressed in erythroid cells of transgenic mice, embryos exhibit a transient mid-gestational anemia as a consequence of a reduction in the number of primitive erythroid cells. GATA-1 mRNA is specifically diminished in the erythroid cells of these TR2/TR4 transgenic embryos as it is in human CD34(+) progenitor cells transfected with forcibly expressed TR2/TR4. In contrast, in loss-of-function studies analyzing either Tr2- or Tr4-germline-null mutant mice or human CD34(+) progenitor cells transfected with force-expressed TR2 and TR4 short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs), GATA-1 mRNA is induced. An evolutionarily conserved direct repeat (DR) element, a canonical binding site for nuclear receptors, was identified in the GATA1 hematopoietic enhancer (G1HE), and TR2/TR4 binds to that site in vitro and in vivo. Mutation of that DR element led to elevated Gata1 promoter activity, and reduced promoter responsiveness to cotransfected TR2/TR4. Thus, TR2/TR4 directly represses Gata1/GATA1 transcription in murine and human erythroid progenitor cells through an evolutionarily conserved binding site within a well-characterized, tissue-specific Gata1 enhancer, thereby providing a mechanism by which Gata1 can be directly silenced during terminal erythroid maturation.
The GATA-1-interacting protein Friend Of GATA-1 (FOG-1) is essential for the proper transcriptional activation and repression of numerous GATA-1 target genes. Although FOG-1-independent activation by GATA-1 has been described, all known examples of GATA-1-mediated repression are FOG-1 dependent. In the GATA-1-null G1E cell line, estrogen receptor ligand binding domain (ER) chimeras of either wild-type GATA-1 or a FOG-1-binding defective mutant of GATA-1 repressed several genes similarly upon activation with beta-estradiol. Repression also occurred in a FOG-1-null cell line expressing ER-GATA-1 and during ex vivo erythropoiesis. At the Lyl1 and Rgs18 loci, we found highly restricted occupancy by GATA-1 and GATA-2, indicating that these genes are direct targets of GATA factor regulation. The identification of genes repressed by GATA-1 independent of FOG-1 defines a novel mode of GATA-1-mediated transcriptional regulation.
Platelets are small anucleate cells that travel near the vessel wall during laminar flow. In response to vascular injury, platelets undergo alterations in morphology which allow them to aggregate and cover the injured site. Platelets are produced by megakaryocytes in a process that involves the formation of platelet precursors called proplatelets and subsequent release of these proplatelets into the circulation. By forming a demarcation membrane system within the cytosol, megakaryocytes contain a membrane reservoir which allows for the production of thousands of platelets per mature megakaryocyte. Interestingly, the above process known as megakaryopoiesis is not yet fully understood. However, several groups have contributed evidence to unveil the role of thrombopoietin (TPO), the principal regulator of megakaryopoiesis in vivo. TPO is necessary for megakaryocyte maturation in that TPO deficient mice display greatly reduced megakaryocyte production as well as reduced numbers of mature megakaryocytes. Several transcription factors have also been implicated in megakaryopoiesis including, GATA-1, friend of GATA-1 (FOG-1), nuclear factor-erythroid 2 (NF-E2), and Fli-1. In fact, interactions among some of the transcription factors have been reported to produce synergistic effects. GATA-1 and Fli-1 interactions result in heightened GPIX and GPIb (2 components of von Willebrand Factor (vWF) receptor) expression, while GATA-1, RUNX1 and core-binding factor beta interactions result in improved alphaIIb promoter activity. Mutations in the vWF complex and alphaIIb beta3 have been linked to disorders such as Bernard-Soulier syndrome and Glazmann thrombasthenia respectively. Therefore, a more comprehensive understanding of the transcriptional control of megakaryopoiesis may lead to more effective treatments of platelet-related disorders.
The reciprocal expression of GATA-1 and GATA-2 during hematopoiesis is an important determinant of red blood cell development. Whereas Gata2 is preferentially transcribed early in hematopoiesis, elevated GATA-1 levels result in GATA-1 occupancy at sites upstream of the Gata2 locus and transcriptional repression. GATA-2 occupies these sites in the transcriptionally active locus, suggesting that a "GATA switch" abrogates GATA-2-mediated positive autoregulation. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) coupled with genomic microarray analysis and quantitative ChIP analysis with GATA-1-null cells expressing an estrogen receptor ligand binding domain fusion to GATA-1 revealed additional GATA switches 77 kb upstream of Gata2 and within intron 4 at +9.5 kb. Despite indistinguishable GATA-1 occupancy at -77 kb and +9.5 kb versus other GATA switch sites, GATA-1 functioned uniquely at the different regions. GATA-1 induced histone deacetylation at and near Gata2 but not at the -77 kb region. The -77 kb region, which was DNase I hypersensitive in both active and inactive states, conferred equivalent enhancer activities in GATA-1- and GATA-2-expressing cells. By contrast, the +9.5 kb region exhibited considerably stronger enhancer activity in GATA-2- than in GATA-1-expressing cells, and other GATA switch sites were active only in GATA-1- or GATA-2-expressing cells. Chromosome conformation capture analysis demonstrated higher-order interactions between the -77 kb region and Gata2 in the active and repressed states. These results indicate that dispersed GATA factor complexes function via long-range chromatin interactions and qualitatively distinct activities to regulate Gata2 transcription.
Ets-1 is a widely expressed transcription factor implicated in development, tumorigenesis and hematopoiesis. We analyzed Ets-1 gene expression during human erythroid and megakaryocytic (MK) differentiation in unilineage cultures of CD34+ progenitor cells. During erythroid maturation, Ets-1 is downmodulated and exported from the nucleus into the cytoplasm through an active mechanism mediated by a leucine-rich nuclear export signal. In contrast, during megakaryocytopoiesis Ets-1 increases and remains localized in the nucleus up to terminal maturation. Overexpression of Ets-1 in erythroid cells blocks maturation at the polychromatophilic stage, increases GATA-2 and decreases both GATA-1 and erythropoietin receptor expression. Conversely, Ets-1 overexpressing megakaryocytes are characterized by enhanced differentiation and maturation, coupled with upmodulation of GATA-2 and megakaryocyte-specific genes. We show that Ets-1 binds to and activates the GATA-2 promoter, in vitro and in vivo, indicating that one of the pathways through which Ets-1 blocks erythroid and promotes MK differentiation is via upmodulation of GATA-2 expression.
Mitosis entails global alterations to chromosome structure and nuclear architecture, concomitant with transient silencing of transcription. How cells transmit transcriptional states through mitosis remains incompletely understood. While many nuclear factors dissociate from mitotic chromosomes, the observation that certain nuclear factors and chromatin features remain associated with individual loci during mitosis originated the hypothesis that such mitotically retained molecular signatures could provide transcriptional memory through mitosis. To understand the role of chromatin structure in mitotic memory, we performed the first genome-wide comparison of DNase I sensitivity of chromatin in mitosis and interphase, using a murine erythroblast model. Despite chromosome condensation during mitosis visible by microscopy, the landscape of chromatin accessibility at the macromolecular level is largely unaltered. However, mitotic chromatin accessibility is locally dynamic, with individual loci maintaining none, some, or all of their interphase accessibility. Mitotic reduction in accessibility occurs primarily within narrow, highly DNase hypersensitive sites that frequently coincide with transcription factor binding sites, whereas broader domains of moderate accessibility tend to be more stable. In mitosis, proximal promoters generally maintain their accessibility more strongly, whereas distal regulatory elements tend to lose accessibility. Large domains of DNA hypomethylation mark a subset of promoters that retain accessibility during mitosis and across many cell types in interphase. Erythroid transcription factor GATA1 exerts site-specific changes in interphase accessibility that are most pronounced at distal regulatory elements, but has little influence on mitotic accessibility. We conclude that features of open chromatin are remarkably stable through mitosis, but are modulated at the level of individual genes and regulatory elements. 
Epigenetic modifications introduce an additional layer of regulation that drastically expands the instructional capability of the human genome. The regulatory consequences of DNA methylation is context dependent; it can induce, enhance, and suppress gene expression, or have no effect on gene regulation. Therefore, it is essential to account for the genomic location of its occurrence and the protein factors it associates with to improve our understanding of its function and effects. Here, we use ENCODE ChIP-seq and DNase I hypersensitivity data, along with large-scale breast cancer genomic data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) to computationally dissect the intricacies of DNA methylation in regulation of cancer transcriptomes. In particular, we identified a relationship between estrogen receptor α (ERα) activity and DNA methylation patterning in breast cancer. We found compelling evidence that methylation status of DNA sequences at ERα binding sites is tightly coupled with ERα activity. Furthermore, we predicted several transcription factors including FOXA1, GATA1, and SUZ12 to be associated with breast cancer by examining the methylation status of their binding sites in breast cancer. Lastly, we determine that methylated CpGs highly correlated with gene expression are enriched in regions 1kb or more downstream of TSSs, suggesting more significant regulatory roles for CpGs distal to gene TSSs. Our study provides novel insights into the role of ERα in breast cancers. 
The aim of the present study was to investigate the role of each estrogen receptors on the regulation of proteins involved with proliferation and differentiation of Sertoli cells from 15-day-old rats. Activation of ESR1 by 17β-estradiol (E2) and ESR1-selective agonist PPT increased CCND1 expression, and this effect was dependent on NF-kB activation. E2 and the ESR2-selective agonist DPN, but not PPT, increased, in a PI3K and CREB-dependent manner, the expression of CDKN1B and the transcription factors GATA-1 and DMRT1. Analyzing the expression of ESR1 and ESR2 in different stages of development of Sertoli cells, we observed that the ESR1/ESR2 ratio decreased with age, and this ratio seems to be important to determine the end of cell proliferation and the start of cell differentiation. In Sertoli cells from 15-day-old rats, the ESR1/ESR2 ratio favors the effect of ESR1 and the activation of this receptor increased [Methyl-(3)H]thymidine incorporation. We propose that in Sertoli cells from 15-day-old rats E2 modulates Sertoli cell proliferation through ESR1/NF-kB-mediated increase of CCND1, and cell cycle exit and differentiation through ESR2/CREB-mediated increase of CDKN1B, GATA-1 and DMRT1. The present study reinforces the important role of estrogen for normal testis development. 
Protein Inhibitor of Activated Signal Transducer and Activators of Transcription 3 (PIAS3) is a molecule that regulates STAT3 and has antiproliferative properties. Glioblastoma and squamous cell lung cancer lack PIAS3 expression. To test the hypothesis that PIAS3 transcriptional effects are STAT3-independent, we developed models for STAT3 knockdown and PIAS3 over-expression. PIAS3 expression results in a distinct transcriptional profile that does not occur with STAT3 knockdown. We identify novel transcription factor binding partners for PIAS3 including ETS, EGR1, NR1I2, and GATA1. PIAS3 binds to these factors and regulates their transcriptional effects resulting in alterations in canonical pathways including Wnt/β-catenin signaling and functions such as cell death and proliferation. A model is proposed by which PIAS3 effects EGR1 regulated pathways.
The erythroid-specific transcription factor Eryf1 binds to DNA sites within regulatory regions of every member of both the alpha- and beta-globin families in chicken. The distribution of these sites suggests that Eryf1 may serve as a general "switch" factor for erythroid development. We have cloned the cDNA for Eryf1 and show that the corresponding mRNA is present in all erythroid lineages, but is absent from non-erythroid cells. We demonstrate that the cDNA encodes the specific Eryf1 binding activity found in erythrocytes. Eryf1 is a basic 38 kd protein containing a pair of highly similar "fingers" with the motif Cys-x-x-Cys-x17-Cys-x-x-Cys. The amino acid sequences of these regions bear no resemblance to those found in other regulatory proteins with a similar arrangement of cysteine residues. Our evidence suggests, furthermore, that transition metal ions are unusually tightly bound, or may not be necessary for the sequence-specific DNA binding of Eryf1.
We have identified a protein present only in erythroid cells that binds to two adjacent sites within an enhancer region of the chicken beta-globin locus. Mutation of the sites, so that binding by the factor can no longer be detected in vitro, leads to a loss of enhancing ability, assayed by transient expression in primary erythrocytes. Binding sites for the erythroid-specific factor (Eryf1) are found within regulatory regions for all chicken globin genes. A strong Eryf1 binding site is also present within the enhancer of at least one human globin gene, and proteins from human erythroid cells (but not HeLa cells) bind to both the chicken and the human sites.
Expression of erythro-specific chick genes was studied in heterokaryons prepared by fusing chick erythrocytes (CE) with rat myoblasts. In this type of heterokaryon the inactive erythrocyte nucleus takes up nuclear proteins of myoblast origin and undergoes transcriptional reactivation. In order to study the stability of the genetic programming of the reactivated CE nucleus, chick gene expression was examined by analysis of RNA from the heterokaryons. Probes for several erythro- and chick-specific genes were used. The heterokaryons showed strong expression of the chick histone H5 and adult alpha-globin genes, while other genes, e.g. the transcription factor Eryf1 gene, normally expressed during erythroid differentiation, were not transcribed. Although the CE used were of the definitive lineage, the heterokaryons showed activation of the chick embryonic beta-globin gene, i.e. a gene normally expressed only in CE of the primitive lineage. We conclude that the reactivation of the mature CE nucleus in a rat cytoplasm resulted in a more immature erythroid gene expression pattern. The activation of the embryonic beta-globin gene indicated a switch of the lineage-specific gene expression pattern. This switch occurred in the absence of DNA replication. The strong expression of the globin and H5 genes in heterokaryons, in the absence of expression of the regulatory factor Eryf1, suggested the existence of Eryf1-independent regulatory mechanisms for erythroid gene expression in these cells.
We have isolated, via differential hybridization screening of a floral cDNA library from sunflower, a cDNA clone that hybridizes to a 1100 nucleotide-long mRNA found exclusively in mature pollen grains. The cDNA encodes a 219 amino acid-long polypeptide containing two potential zinc fingers alternating with two basic domains. A similar organization is found in the erythroid-specific transcription factor Eryf1 from chicken and its murine homolog GF-1. The C-terminus of the protein contains a sixfold repeat of the pentapeptide sequence (S,T,A)(E,D)TQN. These features suggest that the SF3 protein is a transcription factor required for the expression of late pollen genes. The SF3 gene is a member of a multicopy gene family. A genomic copy of the gene has been isolated and sequenced; it is split by four short, AT-rich introns.
The protein kinase inhibitor H7 [1-5(isoquinolinesulfonyl-2-methylpiperazine)] together with a temperature shift to 42 degrees C was found to reproducibly and efficiently induce differentiation of avian erythroblasts transformed with the avian erythroblastosis virus containing v-erbA and a temperature-sensitive v-erbB oncogene. Although a temperature shift to 42 degrees C without H7 results in some elevation of globin transcripts, much higher levels of transcripts accrue when cells are incubated at 42 degrees C with H7; under such conditions, 50-70% of the cells become benzidine positive. In order to investigate the mechanism by which the differentiation occurs, we have characterized and analyzed the levels of the erythroid transcription factor EF1, originally described as a factor binding to the beta H-globin promoter. Protein sequencing of EF1 shows that it is identical to the factor Eryf1. Using a peptide antibody and DNA-binding assays, we demonstrate that EF1 is present at high levels in the nucleus of undifferentiated HD3 cells, and, although there may be a small change when the cells are shifted to 42 degrees C, incubation of the cells with H7 at 42 degrees C does not result in a further elevation commensurate with the high levels of globin transcripts. It is concluded that v-erbA and v-erbB do not repress differentiation by limiting the levels of EF1.
The [Pd(II){(R,R)-chxn}(OH)(2)] reagent (chxn=1,2-diaminocyclohexane) is introduced as a metal probe for the detection of the bidentate chelating sites of a glycose. Two moles of hydroxide per mole palladium support double deprotonation of potentially chelating diol functions at a glycose's backbone. The individual chelating sites are detected using one- and two-dimensional NMR techniques. At equimolar amounts of palladium(II) and aldose, the metal-binding sites include mostly the hydroxy function at the anomeric carbon atom. Chelators are derived from both the pyranose and the furanose isomers. Most pyranose-based chelators form five-membered chelate rings by using their 1,2-diol function. Though 1,2-diolate bonding is also common to the furanoses, the formation of six-membered chelate rings by 1,3-bonding is more significant for them. Metal-excess conditions provoke mostly bis-bidentate 1,2;3,4-chelation but unusual isomers form also: thus d-xylose is dimetallated in its all-axial beta-pyranose form, and erythrose's dimetallation results in the formation of two isomers of a metal derivative of the open-chain hydrate. The spectroscopic results are supported by crystal-structure determinations on [Pd{(R,R)-chxn}(alpha-D-Xylp1,2H(-2)-kappaO(1,2))].H(2)O (Xyl=xylose), [Pd{(R,R)-chxn}(alpha-D-Ribp1,2H(-2)-kappaO(1,2))].2.25H(2)O (Rib=ribose), [Pd{(R,R)-chxn}(alpha-L-Thrf1,3H(-2)-kappaO(1,3))].2H(2)O (Thr=threose) and [Pd{(R,R)-chxn}(alpha-D-Eryf1,3H(-2)-kappaO(1,3))].3H(2)O (Ery=erythrose).
The transcriptional activator, Tax, of human T-cell leukemia virus (HTLV-I) has been considered to interact with cellular proteins to act on target enhancer motifs. Using oligodeoxyribonucleotides containing the tax-responsive element (TAXRE) of the HTLV-I enhancer, we have cloned multiple cDNAs coding for TAXRE-binding proteins (TAXREB), and determined the cDNA and the deduced 200-amino-acid sequences for TAXREB302. The recombinant protein binds to the enhancer DNA by specific interaction to the CRE-like sequence. A single 1.8-kb species of mRNA was detected in cultured cells, as well as in normal human tissues, especially brain and skeletal muscle. The 22-kDa native protein was detected in the cultured-cell lysate by immunoblotting analysis. TAXREB302 does not have structural features common to the CRE-binding protein or activating transcription factor (CREB/ATF) family, but has homology to chicken erythroid transcription factor (Eryf1 or GATA-1), suggesting a possible protein-protein interaction.
Hypercholesterolemia is an important paraneoplastic syndrome in patients with hepatoma, but the nature of this defect has not yet been identified. We investigated the molecular mechanisms of hypercholesterolemia in a hepatoma-bearing rat model. Buffalo rats were implanted in both flanks with Morris hepatoma 7777 (McA-RH7777) cells. After 4 weeks, tumor weight was 5.5+/-1.7 g, and serum cholesterol level increased from 60+/-2 to 90+/-2 mg/dL. Protein and mRNA expression of the ATP-binding cassette transporters A1 and G1 (ABCA1 and ABCG1) was markedly higher in tumors than in livers. These increases were associated with activation of liver X receptor alpha (LXRalpha) as a result of the increased tissue oxysterol concentrations. The accumulation of oxysterols in the hepatomas appeared to be caused mainly by the upregulation of cholesterol biosynthesis, despite the increased tissue sterol concentrations. Overexpression of the sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP) processing system relative to sterol concentration contributed to the resistance to sterols in this tumor. In addition, bile acid biosynthesis was inhibited despite the reduced expression of the small heterodimer partner (SHP) and activated LXRalpha, which also appeared to contribute to the accumulation of oxysterols followed by the acceleration of cholesterol efflux. In conclusion, hypercholesterolemia in McA-RH7777 hepatoma-bearing rats was caused by increased cholesterol efflux from tumors as a result of activation of LXRalpha. Overexpression of the SREBP processing system contributed to the activation of LXRalpha by maintaining high oxysterol levels in tissue.
In Akita and OVE26 mice, two genetic models of type 1 diabetes, diabetic nephropathy is characterized by mesangial expansion and loss of podocytes, resulting in glomerulosclerosis and proteinuria, and is associated with increased expression of profibrotic growth factors, proinflammatory cytokines, and increased oxidative stress. We have also found significant increases in renal triglyceride and cholesterol content. The increase in renal triglyceride content is associated with 1) increased expression of sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP)-1c and carbohydrate response element-binding protein (ChREBP), which collectively results in increased fatty acid synthesis, 2) decreased expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-alpha and -delta, which results in decreased fatty acid oxidation, and 3) decreased expression of farnesoid X receptor (FXR) and small heterodimer partner (SHP). The increase in cholesterol content is associated with 1) increased expression of SREBP-2 and 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl (HMG)-CoA reductase, which results in increased cholesterol synthesis, and 2) decreased expression of liver X receptor (LXR)-alpha, LXR-beta, and ATP-binding cassette transporter-1, which results in decreased cholesterol efflux. Our results indicate that in type 1 diabetes, there is altered renal lipid metabolism favoring net accumulation of triglycerides and cholesterol, which are driven by increases in SREBP-1, ChREBP, and SREBP-2 and decreases in FXR, LXR-alpha, and LXR-beta, which may also play a role in the increased expression of profibrotic growth hormones, proinflammatory cytokines, and oxidative stress.
Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX), sterol 27-hydroxylase (CYP27A1) deficiency, is associated with markedly reduced chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA), the most powerful activating ligand for farnesoid X receptor (FXR). We investigated the effects of reduced CDCA on FXR target genes in humans. Liver specimens from an untreated CTX patient and 10 control subjects were studied. In the patient, hepatic CDCA concentration was markedly reduced but the bile alcohol level exceeded CDCA levels in control subjects (73.5 vs. 37.8 +/- 6.2 nmol/g liver). Cholesterol 7alpha-hydroxylase (CYP7A1) and Na+/taurocholate-cotransporting polypeptide (NTCP) were upregulated 84- and 8-fold, respectively. However, small heterodimer partner (SHP) and bile salt export pump were normally expressed. Marked CYP7A1 induction with normal SHP expression was not explained by the regulation of liver X receptor alpha (LXRalpha) or pregnane X receptor. However, another nuclear receptor, hepatocyte nuclear factor 4alpha (HNF4alpha), was induced 2.9-fold in CTX, which was associated with enhanced mRNA levels of HNF4alpha target genes, CYP7A1, 7alpha-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one 12alpha-hydroxylase, CYP27A1, and NTCP. In conclusion, the coordinate regulation of FXR target genes was lost in CTX. The mechanism of the disruption may be explained by a normally stimulated FXR pathway attributable to markedly increased bile alcohols with activation of HNF4alpha caused by reduced bile acids in CTX liver.
Maintenance of normal lipid levels has implicated the involvement of genes induced by liver X receptor alpha (LXRalpha) and Farnesoid X receptor (FXR). This study was designed to evaluate the hypolipidemic effects of n-butanol extract (NE3) of Panax notoginseng (Burk.) F.H. Chen root on lipid homeostasis and investigate the possible mechanisms in animal experiments. In the transactivation assays, NE3 was identified as a dual FXR/LXRalpha agonist. Subsequently, Sprague-Dawley male rats on a high-fat/high-cholesterol diet were treated orally with NE3 or vehicle alone. As expected, the concentrations of serum TC, TG and LDL-C in rats treated with various concentrations of NE3 showed significant (P&lt;0.01) and dose-dependent decrease, respectively, accompanied with a significant (P&lt;0.01) and dose-dependent decrease in the concentration of hepatic TC and TG. Express-level analysis indicated that both LXRalpha target genes including ABCA1, ABCG5, ABCG8 and FXR target genes including ApoCII and SHP were significantly induced by NE3 (P&lt;0.01). Interestingly, LDLR mRNA level was significantly higher by NE3 (P&lt;0.01), accompanied with the significantly decreased expression levels of CYP7A1, ApoCIII and SREBP1c genes (P&lt;0.01). Based on these results, it can be concluded that NE3 as a dual FXR/LXRalpha agonist largely prevented the accumulation of abnormal lipid in the hyperlipidemic rats.
To evaluate the importance of cholesterol and bile acid concentrations in the intestinal lumen to cholesterol homeostasis, we investigated the effect of cholesterol-, bile salt- or cholestyramine-administration on the regulation of intestinal mRNA related to cholesterol and bile acid metabolism.
Male Wistar rats fed on standard laboratory chow (AIN-93) were allocated into four experimental groups: (i) control group; (ii) cholesterol group (CH), which was fed cholesterol in diet (2% [w/w]) for 14 days; (iii) cholic acid (CA) group, which was fed CA in diet (1% [w/w]) for 14 days; (iv) cholestyramine (CT) group, which was fed CT in diet (5% [w/w]) for 14 days. Blood, liver and small intestine were obtained after 14 days. Serum lipids and bile acids were measured by colorimetric assays, and hepatic and intestinal mRNA relating to lipid and bile acid metabolism was studied by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction.
Intestinal ABCG8, liver X receptor alpha, small heterodimer partner (SHP) and sterol regulatory element binding protein 1c (SREBP-1c) mRNA expressions were markedly increased in the CH group. Intestinal multidrug resistance associated protein (MRP) 2 and MRP3 mRNA expressions were markedly increased in the CA group. In the CT group intestinal MRP2, ABCG5, ABCG8, SHP and SREBP-1c mRNA expressions were markedly decreased.
The bile acid availability in the intestinal lumen alters the expression of various intestinal mRNA relating to not only bile acid metabolism, but also lipid metabolism. Though the mechanism of the intestinal SHP elevation is unclear, cholesterol feeding may affect the intestinal bile acid metabolism via intestinal SHP expression.
The in vivo role of the nuclear receptor SHP in feedback regulation of bile acid synthesis was examined. Loss of SHP in mice caused abnormal accumulation and increased synthesis of bile acids due to derepression of rate-limiting CYP7A1 and CYP8B1 hydroxylase enzymes in the biosynthetic pathway. Dietary bile acids induced liver damage and restored feedback regulation. A synthetic agonist of the nuclear receptor FXR was not hepatotoxic and had no regulatory effects. Reduction of the bile acid pool with cholestyramine enhanced CYP7A1 and CYP8B1 expression. We conclude that input from three negative regulatory pathways controls bile acid synthesis. One is mediated by SHP, and two are SHP independent and invoked by liver damage and changes in bile acid pool size.
Cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase (CYP7A1) catalyzes the rate-limiting step in the classic pathway of bile acid biosynthesis. Dietary cholesterol stimulates CYP7A1 transcription via activation of oxysterol receptor, LXR alpha, whereas bile acids repress transcription through FXR-mediated induction of SHP protein. The aim of this study was to determine the quantitative role that LXR- and FXR-regulated pathways play in regulating CYP7A1 and SHP in both rat and hamster models. In rats fed a 2% cholesterol diet, both SHP and CYP7A1 mRNA levels were elevated. The inability to induce CYP7A1 mRNA levels by cholesterol feeding in hamsters led to a decline in SHP mRNA levels. Elimination of hepatic bile acid flux by cholestyramine or bile fistula resulted in a marked repression of rat SHP mRNA levels. These results suggest that under conditions of both SHP and LXR alpha activation, stimulatory effect of LXR alpha overrides the inhibitory effect of FXR and results in an induction of rat CYP7A1 mRNA levels.
Cholesterol feeding upregulates CYP7A1 in rats but downregulates CYP7A1 in rabbits. To clarify the mechanism responsible for the upregulation of CYP7A1 in cholesterol-fed rats, the effects of dietary cholesterol (Ch) and cholic acid (CA) on the activation of the nuclear receptors, liver X-receptor (LXR-alpha) and farsenoid X-receptor (FXR), which positively and negatively regulate CYP7A1, were investigated in rats. Studies were carried out in four groups (n = 12/group) of male Sprague-Dawley rats fed regular chow (control), 2% Ch, 2% Ch + 1% CA, and 1% CA alone for 1 wk. Changes in mRNA expression of short heterodimer partner (SHP) and bile salt export pump (BSEP), target genes for FXR, were determined to indicate FXR activation, whereas the expression of ABCA1 and lipoprotein lipase (LPL), target genes for LXR-alpha, reflected activation. CYP7A1 mRNA and activity increased twofold and 70%, respectively, in rats fed Ch alone when the bile acid pool size was stable but decreased 43 and 49%, respectively, after CA was added to the Ch diet, which expanded the bile acid pool 3.4-fold. SHP and BSEP mRNA levels did not change after feeding Ch but increased 88 and 37% in rats fed Ch + CA. This indicated that FXR was activated by the expanded bile acid pool. When Ch or Ch + CA were fed, hepatic concentrations of oxysterols, ligands for LXR-alpha increased to activate LXR-alpha, as evidenced by increased mRNA levels of ABCA1 and LPL. Feeding CA alone enlarged the bile acid pool threefold and increased the expression of both SHP and BSEP. These results suggest that LXR-alpha was activated in rats fed both Ch or Ch + CA, whereas CYP7A1 mRNA and activity were induced only in Ch-fed rats where the bile acid pool was not enlarged such that FXR was not activated. In rats fed Ch + CA, the bile acid pool expanded, which activated FXR to offset the stimulatory effects of LXR-alpha on CYP7A1.
We investigated how cholesterol feeding regulates cholesterol 7alpha-hydroxylase (CYP7A1) via the nuclear receptors farnesoid X receptor (FXR) and liver X receptor alpha (LXRalpha) in New Zealand white rabbits. After 1 day of 2% cholesterol feeding, when the bile acid pool size had not expanded, mRNA levels of the FXR target genes short-heterodimer partner (SHP) and sterol 12alpha-hydroxylase (CYP8B) were unchanged, indicating that FXR activation remained constant. In contrast, the mRNA levels of the LXRalpha target genes ATP binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) and cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) increased 5-fold and 2.3-fold, respectively, associated with significant increases in hepatic concentrations of oxysterols. Activity and mRNA levels of CYP7A1 increased 2.4 times and 2.2 times, respectively. After 10 days of cholesterol feeding, the bile acid pool size increased nearly 2-fold. SHP mRNA levels increased 4.1-fold while CYP8B declined 64%. ABCA1 mRNA rose 8-fold and CETP mRNA remained elevated. Activity and mRNA of CYP7A1 decreased 60% and 90%, respectively. Feeding cholesterol for 1 day did not enlarge the ligand pool size or change FXR activation, while LXRalpha was activated highly secondary to increased hepatic oxysterols. As a result, CYP7A1 was up-regulated. After 10 days of cholesterol feeding, the bile acid (FXR ligand) pool size increased, which activated FXR and inhibited CYP7A1 despite continued activation of LXRalpha. Thus, in rabbits, when FXR and LXRalpha are activated simultaneously, the inhibitory effect of FXR overrides the stimulatory effect of LXRalpha to suppress CYP7A1 mRNA expression.
In rodent liver, transcription of the gene encoding cholesterol 7alpha-hydroxylase (CYP7A1), which catalyzes the rate-limiting step in the classic bile acid synthetic pathway, is stimulated by the liver X receptor alpha (LXRalpha), a nuclear receptor for oxysterol metabolites of cholesterol. This feed-forward regulatory loop provides a mechanism for the elimination of excess cholesterol from the body. In this report, we demonstrate that in primary cultures of human hepatocytes, activation of LXRalpha has the opposite effect, repressing CYP7A1 expression. This repression is mediated, at least in part, through induction of the orphan nuclear receptor, short heterodimer partner (SHP), which is also induced by bile acids. We demonstrate that SHP is regulated directly by LXRalpha through a DNA response element that overlaps with the previously characterized bile acid response element. Our data reveal a fundamental difference in the regulation of CYP7A1 in rodent and human hepatocytes and provide evidence that different species employ distinct molecular strategies to regulate cholesterol homeostasis.
The acute phase response is associated with changes in the hepatic expression of genes involved in lipid metabolism. Nuclear hormone receptors that heterodimerize with retinoid X receptor (RXR), such as thyroid receptors, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors, and liver X receptors, modulate lipid metabolism. We recently demonstrated that these nuclear hormone receptors are repressed during the acute phase response induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS), consistent with the known decreases in genes that they regulate. In the present study, we show that LPS significantly decreases farnesoid X receptor (FXR) mRNA in mouse liver as early as 8 h after LPS administration, and this decrease was dose-dependent with the half-maximal effect observed at 0.5 microg/100 g of body weight. Gel-shift experiments demonstrated that DNA binding activity to an FXR response element (IR1) is significantly reduced by LPS treatment. Supershift experiments demonstrated that the shifted protein-DNA complex contains FXR and RXR. Furthermore, the expression of FXR target genes, SHP and apoCII, were significantly reduced by LPS (70 and 60%, respectively). Also, LPS decreases hepatic LRH expression in mouse, which may explain the reduced expression of CYP7A1 in the face of SHP repression. In Hep3B human hepatoma cells, both tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and interleukin-1 (IL-1) significantly decreased FXR mRNA, whereas IL-6 did not have any effect. TNF and IL-1 also decreased the DNA binding activity to an IR1 response element and the expression of SHP and apoCII. Importantly, TNF and IL-1 almost completely blocked the expression of luciferase activity linked to a FXR response element promoter construct transfected into Hep3B cells. Together with our earlier studies on the repression of RXRs, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors, LXRs, thyroid receptors, constitutive androstane receptor, and pregnane X receptor, these results suggest that decreases in nuclear hormone receptors are major contributors to the decreased gene expression that occurs in the negative acute phase response.
Increased cholesterol efflux from macrophage-derived foam cells (MDFCs) is an important protective mechanism to decrease lipid load in the atherosclerotic plaque. Dietary alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), an omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA), decreases circulating cholesterol, but its role in cholesterol efflux has not been extensively studied. Stearoyl CoA desaturase 1 (SCD1) is the rate-limiting enzyme in the synthesis of monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs). Endogenous MUFAs are preferentially incorporated into triglycerides, phospholipids and cholesteryl ester, which are abundant in atherosclerotic plaque. This study investigated the mechanisms by which ALA regulated SCD1 and subsequent effect on cholesterol storage and transport in MDFCs. Small interfering RNA (siRNA) also was applied to modify SCD1 expression in foam cells. Alpha-linolenic acid treatment and SCD1 siRNA significantly decreased SCD1 expression in MDFCs. The reduction of SCD1 was accompanied with increased cholesterol efflux and decreased intracellular cholesterol storage within these cells. Alpha-linolenic acid activated the nuclear receptor farnesoid-X-receptor, which in turn increased its target gene small heterodimer partner (SHP) expression, and decreased liver-X-receptor dependent sterol regulatory element binding protein 1c transcription, ultimately resulting in repressed SCD1 expression. In conclusion, repression of SCD1 by ALA favorably increased cholesterol efflux and decreased cholesterol accumulation in foam cells. This may be one mechanism by which dietary omega-3 PUFAs promote atherosclerosis regression.
Changes in bile acid (BA) metabolism and gallbladder function are critical factors in the pathogenesis of gallstones. Patients with hypertriglyceridemia (HTG) - often overweight and insulin resistant - are at risk for gallstone disease. The question arises whether HTG itself contributes to gallstone formation or whether gallstone disease only associates with this disorder. Triglycerides are formed in response to fluxes of non-esterified fatty acids and glucose. Hypertriglyceridemia results from either overproduction of triglycerides by the liver, impaired lipolysis or a combination of both. Hyperinsulinemia, as observed in the insulin resistant state, stimulates very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL)-triglyceride synthesis. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs), liver X receptors (LXRs), farnesoid X receptor (FXR) and hepatocyte nuclear factor 4α (HNF4α) are the nuclear receptors involved in the regulation of lipogenesis. Microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP) is involved in the production of VLDL and its activation is also under control of transcription factors as FXR and Forkhead box-O1 (FoxO1). Triglyceride and BA metabolism are linked. There is an inverse relationship between bile acid fluxes and pool size and VLDL production and SHP (small heterodimer partner) and FXR are the link between BAs and TG metabolism. BAs are also ligands for FXR and G-protein-coupled receptors, such as TGR5. FXR activation by BAs suppresses the expression of MTP, transcription factor sterol regulatory element binding protein (SREBP)-1c and other lipogenic genes. LXRs stimulate lipogenesis whereas FXRs inhibit the metabolic process. Synthesis of BAs from cholesterol occurs either via the classical pathway (7α-hydroxylation of cholesterol; CYP7A1) or via the alternate pathway (CYP39A1 or CYP7B1). BAs induce FXR, which inhibits CYP7A1 transcription by activation of SHP and inhibition of HNF4α transactivation. Bile composition (supersaturation with cholesterol), gallbladder dysmotility, inflammation, hypersecretion of mucin gel in the gallbladder and slow large intestinal motility and increased intestinal cholesterol absorption may contribute to the pathogenesis of cholesterol gallstones. In HTG patients supersaturated bile may be related to the presence of obesity rather than to HTG itself. Contraction and relaxation of the gallbladder are regulated by neuronal, hormonal and paracrine factors. Postprandial gallbladder emptying is regulated by cholecystokinin (CCK). Poor postprandial gallbladder contraction may be due to the magnitude of the CCK response and to the amount of CCK receptors in the gallbladder smooth muscle cells. In the fasting state gallbladder motility is associated with the intestinal migrating motor complex (MMC) activity and with elevated plasma motilin levels. Fibroblast growth factor (FGF19), produced on arrival of bile acids in the ileum, is also important for gallbladder motility. Gallbladder motility is impaired in HTG patients compared to BMI matched controls. There is evidence that the gallbladder in HTG is less sensitive to CCK and that this sensitivity improves after reversal of high serum TG levels by use of TG lowering agents. In hypertriglyceridemia TG lowering therapy (fibrates or fish-oil) is essential to prevent cardiovascular disease and pancreatitis. Fibrates, however, also increase the risk for cholelithiasis by increasing biliary cholesterol saturation and by reduction of bile acid synthesis. On the other hand fish-oil decreases biliary cholesterol saturation. Fish-oil may increase bile acid synthesis by activation of 7alpha-hydroxylase and may inhibit VLDL production and secretion through activation of nuclear factors and increased apoB degradation. In HTG patients, gallbladder motility improves during bezafibrate as well as during fish-oil therapy. The question remains whether improvement of gallbladder motility and increased lithogenicity of bile by bezafibrate therapy counteract each other or still result in gallstone formation in HTG patients.
Liver glucokinase (LGK) plays an essential role in controlling blood glucose levels and maintaining cellular metabolic functions. Expression of LGK is induced mainly regulated by insulin through sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c) as a mediator. Since LGK expression is known to be decreased in the liver of liver X receptor (LXR) knockout mice, we have investigated whether LGK might be directly activated by LXRalpha. Furthermore, we have studied interrelationship between transcription factors that control gene expression of LGK. In the current studies, we demonstrated that LXRalpha increased LGK expression in primary hepatocytes and that there is a functional LXR response element in the LGK gene promoter as shown by electrophoretic mobility shift and chromatin precipitation assay. In addition, our studies demonstrate that LXRalpha and insulin activation of the LGK gene promoter occurs through a multifaceted indirect mechanism. LXRalpha increases SREBP-1c expression and then insulin stimulates the processing of the membrane-bound precursor SREBP-1c protein, and it activates LGK expression through SREBP sites in its promoter. LXRalpha also activates the LGK promoter by increasing the transcriptional activity and induction of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-gamma, which also stimulates LGK expression through a peroxisome proliferator-responsive element. This activation is tempered through a negative mechanism, where a small heterodimer partner (SHP) decreases LGK gene expression by inhibiting the transcriptional activity of LXRalpha and PPARgamma by directly interacting with their common heterodimer partner RXRalpha. From these data, we propose a mechanism for LXRalpha in controlling the gene expression of LGK that involves activation through SREBP-1c and PPARgamma and inhibition through SHP.
The study aimed at evaluating the hypolipidemic effects of Purified Salvia miltiorrhiza extract (PSME) and investigating the potential molecular mechanisms by which PSME modulated lipid profiles in hyperlipidemic rats.
Sprague-Dawley male rats on a high-fat/high-cholesterol diet were treated orally with PSME, GW3965 (a selective liver X receptor agonist) or vehicle alone. Gene expression analysis and transactivation assays were used to clarify the molecular mechanisms of action of PSME.
The concentrations of plasma total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-cholesterol) and triglycerides in rats treated with PSME at 150 mg kg day(-1) were significantly decreased (P &lt; 0.01), accompanied with significantly decreased concentrations of liver total cholesterol and triglycerides (P &lt; 0.01). In both drug-treated rats, the concentration of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-cholesterol) was significantly elevated (P &lt; 0.01). Intriguingly, short heterodimer partner (SHP) mRNA level was significantly higher in PSME-treated rats (P &lt; 0.01), accompanied with the significantly decreased mRNA level of sterol regulatory element binding protein 1c (SREBP1c) (P &lt; 0.01), which contributed to the decreases of liver and plasma triglycerides through a farnesoid X receptor-SHP-SREBP1c pathway. ATP-binding Cassette Transporter B11 (ABCB11) and murine Mdr2 P-glycoprotein (also known as ABCB4) were significantly induced by PSME, which were responsible for biliary cholesterol solubility by proper biliary secretion of bile salts and phospholipids. The transactivation assays were used to identify PSME as a farnesoid X receptor/liver X receptor alpha coagonist.
These results indicated that PSME as a farnesoid X receptor/liver X receptor alpha coagonist largely improved the lipid profiles in the hyperlipidemic rats.
During the last decades, many studies reported that male reproductive disorders are increasing among humans. It is currently acknowledged that these abnormalities can result from fetal exposure to environmental chemicals that are progressively becoming more concentrated and widespread in our environment. Among the chemicals present in the environment (air, water, food, and many consumer products), several can act as endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs), thus interfering with the endocrine system. Phthalates, bisphenol A (BPA), and diethylstilbestrol (DES) have been largely incriminated, particularly during the fetal and neonatal period, due to their estrogenic and/or anti-androgenic properties. Indeed, many epidemiological and experimental studies have highlighted their deleterious impact on fetal and neonatal testis development. As EDCs can affect many different genomic and non-genomic pathways, the mechanisms underlying the adverse effects of EDC exposure are difficult to elucidate. Using literature data and results from our laboratory, in the present review, we discuss the role of classical nuclear receptors (genomic pathway) in the fetal and neonatal testis response to EDC exposure, particularly to phthalates, BPA, and DES. Among the nuclear receptors, we focused on some of the most likely candidates, such as peroxisome-proliferator activated receptor (PPAR), androgen receptor (AR), estrogen receptors (ERα and β), liver X receptors (LXR), and small heterodimer partner (SHP). First, we describe the expression and potential functions (based on data from studies using receptor agonists and mouse knockout models) of these nuclear receptors in the developing testis. Then, for each EDC studied, we summarize the main evidences indicating that the reprotoxic effect of each EDC under study is mediated through a specific nuclear receptor(s). We also point-out the involvement of other receptors and nuclear receptor-independent pathways. 
Statin therapy has affected glucose homoeostasis of type 2 diabetes patients, which could be related with bile acids metabolism. Whether bile acid metabolism and the expression of farnesoid X receptor (FXR), liver X receptor-α (LXR-α) and sterol regulatory element-binding protein (Srebp)-1c is regulated by hyperglycemia, or whether simvastatin therapy led to higher glucose is related with down-regulated expression of FXR in diabetic rats remained unclear.
Forty male Wistar rats were randomly divided into four groups: normal control rats, insulin resistance rats, diabetic model rats, and the late simvastatin induced diabetic rats. Normal control rats were fed with standard diet, others were fed with high-fat diet. Diabetic model rats were induced by a single intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin (STZ). The late simvastatin induced diabetic rats started simvastatin administration after STZ induced diabetic model rats. Characteristics of fasting blood glucose (FPG), lipid files and total bile acids (TBAs) were measured and the oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) was performed after overnight fasting at the eighth weekend. RNA and protein levels of FXR, LXR-α and Srebp-1c were tested by Western blotting and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).
The insulin resistance rats showed higher glucose, lipid files and lower expression of FXR compared with normal control rats (P &gt; 0.05). The diabetic model rats showed significantly higher glucose, lipid files, TBA and lower expression of FXR compared with insulin resistance rats (P &lt; 0.05). The late simvastatin induced diabetic rats displayed higher glucose and TBA and lower expression of FXR compared with diabetic model rats (P &lt; 0.05).
Changes in bile acid homeostasis, including the alterations of bile acid levels and bile acid receptors, are either a cause or a consequence of the metabolic disturbances observed during diabetic models. Statin therapy induced hyperglycemia may be related with FXR, SHP, LXR-α and Srebp-1 pathways.
Human ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter ABCC2 (cMOAT/MRP2) plays a crucial role in the hepatobiliary transport of sulfate-, glucuronide-, and glutathione-conjugated metabolites as well as a variety of amphiphilic organic anions derived from hepatic metabolism. Molecular mechanisms underlying the induction of this hepatic ABC transporter are of great interest to understand the transport-metabolism interplay in vivo. In the present study, to gain insight into the mechanism of ABCC2 induction, we tested a total of 46 structurally diverse compounds, including nuclear receptor ligands, antibiotics, bile salts, phytochemicals, and anticancer drugs. Among them, we found that LXRalpha ligands, i.e., T0901317, paxilline, and 22(R)-hydroxycholesterol, acted potently to induce the expression of ABCC2 at both mRNA and protein levels in human hepatocellular carcinoma HepG2 cells. The ABCC2 induction by T0901317 was dose- and time-dependent, where the induction pattern of ABCC2 was very similar to that of ABCG1, one of the target genes of LXRalpha. The ABCC2 induction by T0901317 was more strongly elicited when the LXRalpha gene was transiently transfected into HepG2 cells. In contrast, ABCC2 induction by T0901317 was attenuated by transient transfection of a dominant negative LXRalpha variant, suggesting that LXRalpha is involved in ABCC2 induction. Interestingly, RXR, a heterodimer partner of LXRalpha, affected the mRNA levels of ABCC2 and ABCG1 differently. ABCC2 induction by T0901317 was enhanced by RXR siRNA treatment, whereas ABCG1 induction was suppressed by the same treatment. This is the first report demonstrating that LXRalpha is potentially involved in ABCC2 induction.
The therapeutic utility of liver X receptor (LXR) agonists in treating atherosclerosis is limited by an undesired accumulation of triglycerides in the blood and liver. This effect is caused by an increase in the transcription of genes involved in fatty acid synthesis. Here, we show that the primary bile acid, chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA), antagonizes the stimulatory effect of the synthetic LXR agonist, T0-901317, on the expression of acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase-alpha (ACCalpha) and other lipogenic enzymes in chick embryo hepatocyte cultures. CDCA inhibits T0-901317-induced ACCalpha transcription by suppressing the enhancer activity of a LXR response unit (-101 to -71 bp) that binds LXR and sterol-regulatory element binding protein-1 (SREBP-1). We also demonstrate that CDCA decreases the expression of SREBP-1 in the nucleus and the acetylation of histone H3 and H4 at the ACCalpha LXR response unit. The CDCA-mediated reduction in ACCalpha expression is associated with a decrease in the expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator-1alpha (PGC-1alpha) and small heterodimer partner and an increase in the expression of fibroblast growth factor-19 (FGF-19). Ectopic expression of FGF-19 decreases T0-901317-induced ACCalpha expression. Inhibition of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and/or extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) suppresses the effects of CDCA on the expression of ACCalpha, SREBP-1, PGC-1alpha, and FGF-19. These results demonstrate that CDCA inhibits T0-901317-induced ACCalpha transcription by suppressing the activity of LXR and SREBP-1. We postulate that p38 MAPK, ERK, PGC-1alpha, and FGF-19 are components of the signaling pathway(s) mediating the regulation of ACCalpha gene transcription by CDCA.
Bile acids play important functions in the maintenance of bile acid homeostasis. However, due to their detergent properties, these acids are inherently cytotoxic and their accumulation in liver is associated with hepatic disorders such as cholestasis. During their enterohepatic circulation, bile acids undergo several metabolic alterations, including amidation, hydroxylation, sulfonation, and glucuronidation. Most of these transformations facilitate the excretion of bile acids into the bile (amidation and sulfonation) or into the blood for subsequent urinary elimination (hydroxylation, sulfonation, and glucuronidation). In this review, the role of various nuclear receptors and transcription factors in the expression of bile acid detoxification enzymes is summarized. In particular, the coordinate manner in which the xenobiotic sensors pregnane X receptor and constitutive androstane receptor, the lipid sensors liver X receptor, farnesoid X receptor, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha, and vitamin D receptor, and the orphan receptors hepatocyte nuclear factor 4alpha and small heterodimer partner regulate bile acid detoxification is detailed. Finally, we conclude by discussing the importance of these transcription factors as promising drug targets for the correction of cholestasis.
Small heterodimer partner interacting leucine zipper protein (SMILE) has been identified as a nuclear corepressor of the nuclear receptor (NRs) family. Here, we examined the role of SMILE in the regulation of nuclear receptor liver X receptor (LXR)-mediated sterol regulatory element binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c) gene expression. We found that SMILE inhibited T0901317 (T7)-induced transcriptional activity of LXR, which functions as a major regulator of lipid metabolism by inducing SREBP-1c, fatty acid synthase (FAS), and acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) gene expression. Moreover, we demonstrated that SMILE physically interacts with LXR and represses T7-induced LXR transcriptional activity by competing with coactivator SRC-1. Adenoviral overexpression of SMILE (Ad-SMILE) attenuated fat accumulation and lipogenic gene induction in the liver of T7 administered or of high fat diet (HFD)-fed mice. Furthermore, we investigated the mechanism by which ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) inhibits LXR-induced lipogenic gene expression. Interestingly, UDCA treatment significantly increased SMILE promoter activity and gene expression in an adenosine monophosphate-activated kinase-dependent manner. Furthermore, UDCA treatment repressed T7-induced SREBP-1c, FAS, and ACC protein levels, whereas knockdown of endogenous SMILE gene expression by adenovirus SMILE shRNA (Ad-shSMILE) significantly reversed UDCA-mediated repression of SREBP-1c, FAS, and ACC protein levels. Collectively, these results demonstrate that UDCA activates SMILE gene expression through adenosine monophosphate-activated kinase phosphorylation, which leads to repression of LXR-mediated hepatic lipogenic enzyme gene expression.
Hepatitis B virus (HBV) gene expression and replication are regulated by the activation of a number of liver-enriched transcription factors dependent on intracellular and extracellular stimuli. However, the association between the metabolic events and HBV gene expression remains unclear. In this study, we assessed the effects of cholesterol metabolism on HBV viral replication and gene expression. Exposure of oxygenated derivatives of cholesterol (oxysterols) increased HBV gene expression and viral promoter activity. This increase in HBV transcription and replication was directed by nuclear receptor LXRα induction in the presence of oxysterols. In addition, HBV viral expression by oxysterol was inhibited through small heterodimer partner and sterol regulatory element-binding protein 2, key regulators of cholesterol synthesis. When IFNα and oxysterols were co-incubated, oxysterols and LXRα significantly reduced the anti-HBV effects of IFNα. These results point to a novel mechanism of oxysterol-mediated gene regulation in HBV replication and a potent mechanism underlying the failure of IFNα-based treatment.
Bile acid sequestrants (BAS) have shown antidiabetic effects in both humans and animals but the underlying mechanism is not clear. In the present study, we evaluated cholestyramine in Zucker diabetic fatty (ZDF) rats. Although control ZDF rats had continuous increases in blood glucose and hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) and serum glucose and a decrease in serum insulin throughout a 5-week study, the cholestyramine-treated ZDF rats showed a dose-dependent decrease and normalization in serum glucose and HbA1c. An oral glucose tolerance test showed a significant increase in glucose-stimulated glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1), peptide YY (PYY), and insulin release in rats treated with cholestyramine. Quantitative analysis of gene expression indicated that cholestyramine treatment decreased farnesoid X receptor (FXR) activity in the liver and the intestine without liver X receptor (LXR) activation in the liver. Moreover, a combination of an FXR agonist with cholestyramine did not reduce the antihyperglycemic effect over cholestyramine alone, suggesting that the FXR-small heterodimer partner-LXR pathway was not required for the glycemic effects of cholestyramine. In summary, our results demonstrated that cholestyramine could completely reverse hyperglycemia in ZDF rats through improvements in insulin sensitivity and pancreatic beta-cell function. Enhancement in GLP-1 and PYY secretion is an important mechanism for BAS-mediated antidiabetic efficacy.
NK-4 is the main component of the antiallergic drug Lumin, which has been in popular usage since the early 1950s. In this study, we examined whether NK-4 exerts a regulatory effect on the activation and effector function of Th2 cells. NK-4 inhibited IL-4 production by anti-CD3ε mAb-stimulated BALB/c mouse spleen cells, whereas NK-4 had little effect on IFN-γ production. IL-4 and IL-5 secretion by anti-CD3ε mAb- or antigen-stimulated Th2 cells (D10.G4.1) was abrogated by NK-4 without affecting cell numbers, whereas IFN-γ secretion by activated Th1 cells was unchanged. Mechanistic analysis revealed that NK-4 inhibited mRNA expression of the Th2-associated transcription factors GATA-3 and NFATc1 in anti-CD3ε mAb-stimulated D10.G4.1 cells. Regarding the regulation of Th2 cell effector functions, NK-4 inhibited the secretion of eotaxin and thymus and activation-regulated chemokine (TARC) by normal human dermal fibroblasts in response to IL-4 and/or TNF-α. NK-4 achieved TARC attenuation comparable to what is observed with suplatast tosilate, an antiallergic drug that selectively inhibits Th2 cytokine production, at 14-fold lower concentrations of suplatast tosilate. Dexamethasone increased TARC production by 2.2- to 2.6-fold of control cultures. NK-4 successfully inhibited the STAT6 signaling pathway, suggesting a potential mechanism for down-regulating chemokines expression. In addition, NK-4 abrogated IL-4-driven modulation of cytokine production profile in human monocytic THP-1 cells from proinflammatory to anti-inflammatory response, as seen in the inverted ratio of TNF-α to IL-10 produced in response to LPS. These results suggest that NK-4 could prevent IL-4-driven polarization to alternatively activated macrophages, which are proposed to have pathogenic roles in allergic asthma. The importance of Th2 cytokines and chemokines in the development and progression of type 2 inflammatory disorders has been highlighted by recent advance in our understanding the immunological mechanism underlying allergic disease. Our results support the use of NK-4 as a reasonable therapeutic option to alleviate Th2-mediated allergic inflammation.
Aberrant expression of leucine zipper- and sterile ɑ motif-containing kinase (ZAK) observed in pathological human myocardial tissue is associated with the progression and elevation of hypertrophy. Our previous reports have correlated high levels of estrogen (E2) and abundant estrogen receptor (ER) α with a low incidence of pathological cardiac-hypertrophy and heart failure in the premenopause female population. However, the effect of elevated ERβ expression is not well known yet. Therefore, in this study, we have analyzed the cardioprotective effects and mechanisms of E2 and/or ERβ against ZAK overexpression-induced cellular hypertrophy. We have used transient transfection to overexpress ERβ into the ZAK tet-on H9c2 cells that harbor the doxycycline-inducible ZAK plasmid. The results show that ZAK overexpression in H9c2 cells resulted in hypertrophic effects, which was correlated with the upregulation of p-JNK and p-p38 MAPKs and their downstream transcription factors c-Jun and GATA-4. However, ERβ and E2 with ERβ overexpressions totally suppressed the effects of ZAK overexpression and inhibited the levels of p-JNK, p-p38, c-Jun, and GATA-4 effectively. Our results further reveal that ERβ directly binds with ZAK under normal conditions; however, ZAK overexpression reduced the association of ZAK-ERβ. Interestingly, increase in ERβ and E2 along with ERβ overexpression both enhanced the binding strengths of ERβ and ZAK and reduced the ZAK protein level. ERβ overexpression also suppressed the E3 ligase-casitas B-lineage lymphoma (CBL) and attenuated CBL-phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) protein association to prevent PI3K protein degradation. Moreover, ERβ and/or E2 blocked ZAK nuclear translocation via the inhibition of small ubiquitin-like modiﬁer (SUMO)-1 modification. Taken together, our results further suggest that ERβ overexpression strongly suppresses ZAK-induced cellular hypertrophy and myocardial damage.
Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor has been proven to improve glycemic control and β-cell function in latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA). The potential immune modulation mechanism is still unknown. Thus, we tested T-lymphocyte subsets and expression of relevant transcription factors in LADA patients with sitagliptin intervention for up to 1-year.
A total of 40 LADA patients were randomly assigned to sitagliptin and/or insulin treatment (SITA group; n = 20) or insulin alone treatment (CONT group; n = 20). Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated at baseline, 6 months and 12 months. The percentage of T-lymphocyte subsets (T helper 1, T helper 2, T helper 17 and regulatory T cells) tested by flow cytometry, and the messenger ribonucleic acid expression (T box expressed in T cells [T-BET], GATA binding protein 3 [GATA3], forkhead box protein 3 [FOXP3] and related orphan receptor C [RORC]) tested by real-time polymerase chain reaction were determined at baseline, 6 months and 12 months.
The percentage of regulatory T cells in the SITA group was significantly lower than that of the CONT group at baseline. The percentage of T helper 2 cells was higher than that of the CONT group at 6 months and 12 months. At 12 months, the percentage of T helper 17 cells was lower in the SITA group than that of the CONT group. After a 1-year visit, the messenger ribonucleic acid expression levels of T-BET expressed in T cells and RORC in the SITA group were significantly lower than at baseline. Whereas that of RORC in the CONT group were significantly lower than that at baseline.
The data confirmed that sitagliptin altered the phenotype of T cells and downregulated the expression of T-BET and RORC in LADA patients, and ameliorated glycemic control in LADA patients.
The unique properties of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) have attracted much interest for a range of applications, including biomedical applications in the cosmetic industry. The current study assessed the anti-oxidative effect of AuNPs against retinoic acid (RA)-induced loss of cell viability; cell proliferation; expression of oxidative and anti-oxidative stress markers, pro- and anti-apoptotic genes, and differentiation markers; and mitochondrial dysfunction in F9 teratocarcinoma stem cells. AuNPs were prepared by reduction of gold salts using luteolin as a reducing and stabilizing agent. The prepared AuNPs were spherical in shape with an average diameter of 18 nm. F9 cells exposed to various concentrations of these AuNPs were not harmed, whereas cells exposed to RA exhibited a dose-dependent change in cell viability and cell proliferation. The RA-mediated toxicity was associated with increased leakage of lactate dehydrogenase, reactive oxygen species, increased levels of malondialdehyde and nitric oxide, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, and a reduced level of ATP. Finally, RA increased the level of pro-apoptotic gene expression and decreased the expression of anti-apoptotic genes. Interestingly, the toxic effect of RA appeared to be decreased in cells treated with RA in the presence of AuNPs, which was coincident with the increased levels of anti-oxidant markers including thioredoxin, glutathione peroxidases, glutathione, glutathione disulfide, catalase, and superoxide dismutase. Concomitantly, AuNPs ameliorated the apoptotic response by decreasing the mRNA expression of p53, p21, Bax, Bak, caspase-3, caspase-9, and increasing the expressions of Bcl-2 and Bcl-Xl. Interestingly, AuNPs not only ameliorated oxidative stress but also induced differentiation in F9 cells by increasing the expression of differentiation markers including retinoic acid binding protein, laminin 1, collagen type IV, and Gata 6 and decreasing the expressions of markers of stem cell pluripotency including Nanog, Rex1, octamer-binding transcription factor 4, and Sox-2. These consistent cellular and biochemical data suggest that AuNPs could ameliorate RA-induced cell death and facilitate F9 cell differentiation. AuNPs could be suitable therapeutic agents for the treatment of oxidative stress-related diseases such as atherosclerosis, cancer, diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, and neurodegenerative diseases.
Memory stem T (TSCM) cells, a new subset of memory T cells with self-renewal and multipotent capacities, are considered as a promising candidates for adoptive cellular therapy. However, the low proportion of human TSCM cells in total CD8 T cells limits their utility. Here, we aimed to induce human CD8 TSCM cells by stimulating naive precursors with interleukin-21 (IL-21). We found that IL-21 promoted the generation of TSCM cells, described as CD45RACD45ROCD62LCCR7CD122CD95 cells, with a higher efficiency than that observed with other common γ-chain cytokines. Upon adoptive transfer into an A375 melanoma mouse model, these lymphocytes mediated much stronger antitumor responses. Further mechanistic analysis revealed that IL-21 activated the Janus kinase signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 pathway by upregulating signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 phosphorylation and consequently promoting the expression of T-bet and suppressor of cytokine signaling 1, but decreasing the expression of eomesodermin and GATA binding protein 3. Our findings provide novel insights into the generation of human CD8 TSCM cells and reveal a novel potential clinical application of IL-21.
Identification and characterization of non-typeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi) with reduced susceptibility to β-lactam antibiotics due to mutations in penicillin binding protein 3 (PBP3) is a clinical challenge. We analyzed a blood isolate, NTHi93-57485, that was categorized as aminopenicillin resistant but lacked key amino acid substitutions in PBP3 that have previously been associated with reduced aminopenicillin susceptibility. The significance of an alternative amino acid substitution (Y528H) in this isolate was examined.
Site-directed mutagenesis of a β-lactam susceptible H. influenzae (NTHi3655) was performed to introduce the Y528H substitution into wild-type ftsI (encoding for PBP3). Disc diffusion screening and broth microdilution determination of MICs for β-lactam agents were done with the NTHi3655-PBP3Y528H mutant and were compared with the NTHi3655 wild-type as well as the original clinical isolate NTHi93-57485. Introduction of the Y528H substitution in NTHi3655 resulted in positive screening for β-lactam resistance. MICs for aminopenicillins were increased in the mutant compared to the wild-type. However, the mutant remained susceptible to aminopenicillins according to EUCAST clinical breakpoints (assuming intravenous treatment) and the introduction of Y528H alone did not increase the resistance to the same level as NTHi93-57485. None of the isolates had frame shift insertions in the acrR gene regulating the AcrAB efflux pump.
In parallel to the previously well-described PBP3-substitutions R517H and N526K, we demonstrate that Y528H confers reduced aminopenicillin susceptibility.
The Xga blood group is differentially expressed on erythrocytes from men and women. The underlying gene, PBDX, was identified in 1994, but the molecular background for Xga expression remains undefined. This gene, now designated XG, partly resides in pseudoautosomal region 1 and encodes a protein of unknown function from the X chromosome. By comparing calculated Xg
                        a
                     allele frequencies in different populations with 2612 genetic variants in the XG region, rs311103 showed the strongest correlation to the expected distribution. The same single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) had the most significant impact on XG transcript levels in whole blood (P = 2.0 × 10-22). The minor allele, rs311103C, disrupts a GATA-binding motif 3.7 kb upstream of the transcription start point. This silences erythroid XG messenger RNA expression and causes the Xg(a-) phenotype, a finding corroborated by SNP genotyping in 158 blood donors. Binding of GATA1 to biotinylated oligonucleotide probes with rs311103G but not rs311103C was observed by electrophoretic mobility shift assay and proven by mass spectrometry. Finally, a luciferase reporter assay indicated this GATA motif to be active for rs311103G but not rs311103C in HEL cells. By using an integrated bioinformatic and molecular biological approach, we elucidated the underlying genetic basis for the last unresolved blood group system and made Xga genotyping possible.
Congenital uterine wall cysts arising from paramesonephric (Müllerian) and mesonephric (Wolffian) ducts are typically incidental findings in most species. We used immunohistochemistry to characterize and determine the origin of uterine cysts in Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats from multigeneration studies conducted by the National Toxicology Program. Subserosal uterine cysts were observed in 20 of the 2,400 SD rats evaluated in five studies, and 10 cysts were characterized for this study. Single cysts were unilocular, fluid-filled, and occurred throughout the uterus. Microscopically, all cysts had a well-developed smooth muscle wall, lined by flattened to cuboidal, sometimes ciliated, epithelium that stained intensely positive for cytokeratin 18 and paired box protein 8 (PAX8). Most cyst epithelia displayed weak to moderate positivity for progesterone receptor (PR) and/or estrogen receptor α (ER-α), as well as were negative for GATA binding protein 3 (GATA3). Cyst lumens contained basophilic flocculent material. The cysts appeared to be developmental anomalies arising from paramesonephric tissue based on positive PAX8 and ER-α and/or PR staining. Additionally, 70% of the cysts lacked GATA3 expression. Taken together, the subserosal uterine cysts observed in adult rats in these studies most likely arose from the paramesonephric duct.
Acetylcholinesterase (AChE; EC 3.1.1.7) is known to hydrolyze acetylcholine at cholinergic synapses. In mammalian erythrocyte, AChE exists as a dimer (G2 ) and is proposed to play role in erythropoiesis. To reveal the regulation of AChE during differentiation of erythroblast, erythroblast-like cells (TF-1) were induced to differentiate by application of erythropoietin (EPO). The expression of AChE was increased in parallel to the stages of differentiation. Application of EPO in cultured TF-1 cells induced transcriptional activity of ACHE gene, as well as its protein product. This EPO-induced event was in parallel with erythrocytic proteins, for example, α- and β-globins. The EPO-induced AChE expression was mediated by phosphorylations of Akt and GATA-1; because the application of Akt kinase inhibitor blocked the gene activation. Erythroid transcription factor also known as GATA-1, a downstream transcription factor of EPO signaling, was proposed here to account for regulation of AChE in TF-1 cell. A binding sequence of GATA-1 was identified in ACHE gene promoter, which was further confirmed by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay. Over-expression of GATA-1 in TF-1 cultures induced AChE expression, as well as activity of ACHE promoter tagged with luciferase gene (pAChE-Luc). The deletion of GATA-1 sequence on the ACHE promoter, pAChEΔGATA-1 -Luc, reduced the promoter activity during erythroblastic differentiation. On the contrary, the knock-down of AChE in TF-1 cultures could lead to a reduction in EPO-induced expression of erythrocytic proteins. These findings indicated specific regulation of AChE during maturation of erythroblast, which provided an insight into elucidating possible mechanisms in regulating erythropoiesis.
Approximately 30% to 40% of breast cancer recurrences involve bone metastasis (BM). Certain genes have been linked to BM; however, none have been able to predict bone involvement. In this study, we analyzed gene expression profiles in advanced breast cancer patients to elucidate genes that can be used to predict BM.
A total of 92 advanced breast cancer patients, including 46 patients with BM and 46 patients without BM, were identified for this study. Immunohistochemistry and gene expression analysis was performed on 81 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded samples. Data were collected through medical records, and gene expression of 200 selected genes compiled from 6 previous studies was performed using NanoString nCounter.
Genetic expression profiles showed that 22 genes were significantly differentially expressed between breast cancer patients with metastasis in bone and other organs (BM+) and non-BM, whereas subjects with only BM showed 17 significantly differentially expressed genes. The following genes were associated with an increasing incidence of BM in the BM+ group: estrogen receptor 1 (ESR1), GATA binding protein 3 (GATA3), and melanophilin with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.804. In the BM group, the following genes were associated with an increasing incidence of BM: ESR1, progesterone receptor, B-cell lymphoma 2, Rab escort protein, N-acetyltransferase 1, GATA3, annexin A9, and chromosome 9 open reading frame 116. ESR1 and GATA3 showed an increased strength of association with an AUC of 0.928.
A combination of the identified 3 genes in BM+ and 8 genes in BM showed better prediction than did each individual gene, and this combination can be used as a training set.
The cuticle, the outer covering of the nematode C. elegans, is synthesized five times during the worm's life by the underlying hypodermis. Cuticle collagens, the major cuticle component, are encoded by a large family of col genes and, interestingly, many of these genes express predominantly at a single developmental stage. This temporal preference motivated us to investigate the mechanisms underlying col gene expression and here we focus on a subset of col genes expressed in the L4 stage. We identified minimal promoter regions of &lt;300 bp for col-38, col-49, and col-63. In these regions, we predicted cis-regulatory sequences and evaluated their function in vivo via mutagenesis of a col-38p::yfp reporter. We used RNAi to study the requirement for candidate transcription regulators ELT-1 and ELT-3, LIN-29, and the LIN-29 co-factor MAB-10, and found LIN-29 to be necessary for the expression of four L4-specific genes (col-38, col-49, col-63, and col-138). Temporal misexpression of LIN-29 was also sufficient to activate these genes at a different developmental stage. The LIN-29 DNA-binding domain bound the col-38, col-49, and col-63 minimal promoters in vitro. For col-38 we showed that the LIN-29 sites necessary for reporter expression in vivo are also bound in vitro: this is the first identification of specific binding sites for LIN-29 necessary for in vivo target gene expression.
The role of environmental factors in autoimmune diseases has been increasingly recognized. While major advance has been made in understanding biological pathogen-induced autoimmune diseases, chemically triggered autoimmunity is poorly understood. Trichloroethylene (TCE), a common environmental pollutant, has recently been shown to induce autoimmunity. This study explored whether TCE could cause imbalance of T helper (Th) cell subsets which would contribute to the pathogenesis of TCE-induced medicamentosa-like dermatitis. BALB/c mice were treated with TCE via drinking water at doses of 2.5 or 5.0 mg/mL for 2, 4, 8, 12, and 16 weeks. Trichloroethylene exposure caused time- and dose-dependent increase in Th1, Th2, and Th17 and decrease in regulatory cell (Treg) in the spleen at 2, 4, 8, 12, and 16 weeks, with greatest changes mainly at 4 weeks. These effects were mirrored by similar changes in the expression of their corresponding cytokines interferon-γ, interleukin 4 (IL-4), IL-17A, and IL-10. Mechanistically, these phenotypic changes were accounted for by alterations to their respective master transcription factors T-box expressed in T cells, GATA-binding protein 3, Retinoic acid-related orphan receptor ct (RORct), and forkhead box P3. Of interest, TCE treatment shifted the ratios of Th1/Th2 and Th17/Treg; specifically, TCE increased Th17/Treg. These findings provide the first evidence that TCE exposure significantly changes the Th1/Th2/Th17/Treg paradigm and their specific cytokines driven by altered master transcription factors. This may promote autoimmune reactions in the pathogenesis of TCE-induced skin sensitization and associated damage to other tissues.
Extracellular matrix barriers and inducible cytoprotective genes form successive lines of defense against chemical and microbial environmental stressors. The barrier in nematodes is a collagenous extracellular matrix called the cuticle. In Caenorhabditis elegans, disruption of some cuticle collagen genes activates osmolyte and antimicrobial response genes. Physical damage to the epidermis also activates antimicrobial responses. Here, we assayed the effect of knocking down genes required for cuticle and epidermal integrity on diverse cellular stress responses. We found that disruption of specific bands of collagen, called annular furrows, coactivates detoxification, hyperosmotic, and antimicrobial response genes, but not other stress responses. Disruption of other cuticle structures and epidermal integrity does not have the same effect. Several transcription factors act downstream of furrow loss. SKN-1/Nrf and ELT-3/GATA are required for detoxification, SKN-1/Nrf is partially required for the osmolyte response, and STA-2/Stat and ELT-3/GATA for antimicrobial gene expression. Our results are consistent with a cuticle-associated damage sensor that coordinates detoxification, hyperosmotic, and antimicrobial responses through overlapping, but distinct, downstream signaling.
Nitrogen is one of the most important essential nutrient sources for biogenic activities. Regulation of nitrogen metabolism in microorganisms is complicated and elaborate. For this review, the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae was chosen to demonstrate the regulatory mechanism of nitrogen metabolism because of its relative clear genetic background. Current opinions on the regulation processes of nitrogen metabolism in S. cerevisiae, including nitrogen sensing, transport, and catabolism, are systematically reviewed. Two major upstream signaling pathways, the Ssy1-Ptr3-Ssy5 sensor system and the target of rapamycin pathway, which are responsible for sensing extracellular and intracellular nitrogen, respectively, are discussed. The ubiquitination of nitrogen transporters, which is the most general and efficient means for controlling nitrogen transport, is also summarized. The following metabolic step, nitrogen catabolism, is demonstrated at two levels: the transcriptional regulation process related to GATA transcriptional factors and the translational regulation process related to the general amino acid control pathway. The interplay between nitrogen regulation and carbon regulation is also discussed. As a model system, understanding the meticulous process by which nitrogen metabolism is regulated in S. cerevisiae not only could facilitate research on global regulation mechanisms and yeast metabolic engineering but also could provide important insights and inspiration for future studies of other common microorganisms and higher eukaryotic cells.
Cardiac toxicity has been the major concern when using doxorubicin (DOX) in cancer therapy. Thrombopoietin (TPO) protects cardiac cells from DOX-induced cell damage; however, its molecular mechanism remains exclusive. The anti-autophagic and anti-apoptotic effects of TPO upon DOX treatment were studied in the cardiac H9C2 cell line, with bafilomycin A1 treatment as a positive control for autophagy inhibition. Cell viability was measured by Cell Counting Kit-8 assay in different treatment groups. The mRNA and/or protein levels of apoptotic markers and autophagy-associated factors were detected. The mean number of microtubule-associated protein 1A/1B-light chain 3 (LC3) puncta per cell was quantified to indicate autophagosomes and autolysosomes, of which the ones co-stained with lysosomal-associated membrane protein 1 were considered as autolysosomes. DOX treatment (5 µg/ml, 24 h) significantly impaired H9C2 cell viability compared with the control, while TPO pretreatment (10 ng/ml, 36 h) improved cell viability upon DOX treatment. DOX exposure markedly increased LC3 puncta in H9C2 cells, and TPO pretreatment reduced the number of autophagosomes, but showed no significant inhibitory effect on autolysosome formation. The autophagy inhibition by TPO upon DOX treatment was confirmed according to protein quantification of LC3-II and nucleoporin 62. TPO also suppressed autophagy-promoting protein Beclin-1, and elevated the anti-autophagic factors GATA-binding protein-4 and B cell lymphoma-2. Furthermore, TPO reduced DOX-induced apoptosis in H9C2 cells, as reflected by the amount changes of caspase-3. Taken together, these results revealed that TPO has a protective role in H9C2 cells from DOX-induced autophagy as well as apoptosis, and indicated that TPO may act as a cardioprotective drug in DOX-treated patients.
NKX2-5 is a homeobox transcription factor that is required for the formation of the heart and vessels during development, with significant postnatal down-regulation and reactivation in disease states, characterized by vascular remodeling. The purpose of this study was to investigate mechanisms that activate NKX2-5 expression in diseased vessels, such as systemic sclerosis (scleroderma; SSc)-associated pulmonary hypertension (PH), and to identify genetic variability that potentially underlies susceptibility to specific vascular complications.
We explored NKX2-5 expression in biopsy samples from patients with SSc-associated PH and in pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (PASMCs) from patients with scleroderma. Disease-associated putative functional single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at the NKX2-5 locus were cloned and studied in reporter gene assays. SNP function was further examined through protein-DNA binding assays, chromatin immunoprecipitation assays, and RNA silencing analyses.
Increased NKX2-5 expression in biopsy samples from patients with SSc-associated PH was localized to remodeled vessels and PASMCs. Meta-analysis of 2 independent scleroderma cohorts revealed an association of rs3131917 with scleroderma (P = 0.029). We demonstrated that disease-associated SNPs are located in a novel functional enhancer, which increases NKX2-5 transcriptional activity through the binding of GATA-6, c-Jun, and myocyte-specific enhancer factor 2C. We also characterized an activator/coactivator transcription-enhancer factor domain 1 (TEAD1)/Yes-associated protein 1 (YAP1) complex, which was bound at rs3095870, another functional SNP, with TEAD1 binding the risk allele and activating the transcription of NKX2-5.
NKX2-5 is genetically associated with scleroderma, pulmonary hypertension, and fibrosis. Functional evidence revealed a regulatory mechanism that results in NKX2-5 transcriptional activation in PASMCs through the interaction of an upstream promoter and a novel downstream enhancer. This mechanism can act as a model for NKX2-5 activation in cardiovascular disease characterized by vascular remodeling.
Despite numerous studies on the utility of GATA-3 as breast cancer marker, its comparison with other breast markers, its concordance between primary and metastatic tumors and its expression in primary cancers from sites with frequent breast metastases remains unclear.
To address these questions, totally 993 invasive breast cancers (IBC), 254 paired nodal metastases, 23 distant metastases, and 208 lung carcinomas were included. GATA-3 expression was analyzed by immunohistochemistry and compared to other breast markers [gross cystic disease fluid protein 15 (GCDFP-15) and mammaglobin (MGB)].
GATA-3 was expressed in 82.5% of IBC, predominantly in luminal (93.9%), and lower in non-luminal cancers [59.6% of HER2 overexpressing (HER2-OE) and 38.1% of triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) subtypes]. GATA-3 identified more IBC than GCDFP-15 (23.9%) and MGB (46.6%). However, MGB showed a comparable sensitivity for non-luminal cancers to GATA-3. Combining MGB and GATA-3 improved sensitivity for both HER2-OE (80.8%) and TNBC cases (55.4%). GATA-3 showed a high sensitivity for nodal metastases and distant metastases, with good concordance with primary tumors. GATA-3 was expressed in 1.0% of lung carcinomas, with sensitivity and specificity of 82.5 and 99.0% in differentiating IBC and lung carcinoma.
GATA-3 expression was the highest in luminal breast carcinomas, and showed higher sensitivity than GCDFP-15 and MGB. However, in the poorly differentiated IBC, its utility was still limited. One should be aware of the possible GATA-3 expression in lung carcinomas.
Sleep apnea syndrome (SAS) is characterized by intermittent hypoxia (IH) during sleep. SAS and obesity are strongly related to each other. Here, we investigated the effect of IH on the expression of major appetite regulatory genes in human neuronal cells. We exposed NB-1, SH-SY5Y, and SK-N-SH human neuronal cells to IH (64 cycles of 5 min hypoxia and 10 min normoxia), normoxia, or sustained hypoxia for 24 h and measured the mRNA levels of proopiomelanocortin (POMC), cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript (CART), galanin, galanin-like peptide, ghrelin, pyroglutamylated RFamide peptide, agouti-related peptide, neuropeptide Y, and melanocortin 4 receptor by real-time RT-PCR. IH significantly increased the mRNA levels of POMC and CART in all the neuronal cells. Deletion analysis revealed that the -705 to -686 promoter region of POMC and the -950 to -929 region of CART were essential for the IH-induced promoter activity. As possible GATA factor binding sequences were found in the two regions, we performed real-time RT-PCR to determine which GATA family members were expressed and found that GATA2 and GATA3 mRNAs were predominantly expressed. Therefore, we introduced siRNAs against GATA2 and GATA3 into NB-1 cells and found that GATA2 and GATA3 siRNAs abolished the IH-induced up-regulation of both POMC and CART mRNAs. These results indicate that IH stress up-regulates the mRNA levels of anorexigenic peptides, POMC and CART, in human neuronal cells via GATA2 and GATA3. IH can have an anorexigenic effect on SAS patients through the transcriptional activation of POMC and CART in the central nervous system.
We identified that GATA zinc finger domain containing 1 (GATAD1), a transcriptional factor, was significantly up-regulated in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) through gene amplification. We demonstrated the critical role, molecular mechanisms, and clinical implications of GATAD1 as a novel oncogenic factor in HCC. We found that GATAD1 protein was expressed in 76.6% of primary HCCs (85/111) but silenced in normal liver tissues. Gene amplification of GATAD1 was positively correlated with its overexpression in primary HCCs (R = 0.629, P &lt; 0.0001). GATAD1 significantly increased cell proliferation, G1 -S cell cycle transition, and migration/invasion but suppressed apoptosis in liver cell lines and promoted tumor growth and lung metastasis in both xenograft and orthotopic mouse models. Mechanistically, GATAD1 induced the transcriptional expression of phosphatase of regenerating liver 3 (PRL3) by binding to its promoter identified by RNA sequencing and chromatin immunoprecipitation-PCR analyses. PRL3 played an oncogenic role in HCC. Knockdown of PRL3 blunted the tumorigenic effect of GATAD1. In addition, GATAD1 activated Akt signaling, evidenced by increased phosphorylation levels of total Akt, Akt1, Akt2, and Akt target glycogen synthase kinase 3β, while knockdown of PRL3 abolished this effect of GATAD1. We further unveiled that PRL3 activated Akt signaling by dephosphorylating phosphatase and tensin homolog at tyrosine residue, thus reducing phosphatase and tensin homolog protein. The PRL3 inhibitor 5-[[5-bromo-2-[(2-bromophenyl)methoxy]phenyl]methylene]-2-thioxo-4-thiazolidinone significantly suppressed HCC growth by inhibiting Akt activation. Moreover, high GATAD1 nuclear protein expression was associated with poor survival of HCC patients as an independent prognostic factor.
GATAD1 plays a pivotal oncogenic role in HCC by directly inducing PRL3 transcription to activate the Akt signaling pathway. GATAD1 may serve as an independent poor prognostic factor for HCC patients. (Hepatology 2018;67:2302-2319).
The present study aimed to examine potential crucial genes associated with Parkinson's disease (PD) in addition to the interactions and regulators of these genes. The chip data (GSE7621) were obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus and standardized using the robust multi‑array average in the Affy package of R software. The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were then screened using the Samr package with a false discovery rate (FDR) &lt;0.05 and |log2 fold change (FC)|&gt;1. Crucial PD‑associated genes were predicted using the Genetic Association Database in the Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery and sequence alignment. Furthermore, transcription factors (TFs) of the crucial PD‑associated genes were predicted, and protein‑protein interactions (PPIs) between the crucial PD‑associated genes were analyzed using the Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes/Proteins. Additionally, another dataset of PD was used to validate the expression of crucial PD‑associated genes. A total of 670 DEGs (398 upregulated and 272 downregulated genes) were identified in the PD samples. Of these, 10 DEGs enriched in pathways associated with the nervous system were predicted to be crucial in PD, including C‑X‑C chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR4), deleted in colorectal cancer (DCC) and NCL adaptor protein 2 (NCK2). All 10 genes were associated with neuron development and differentiation. They were simultaneously modulated by multiple TFs, including GATA, E2F and E4 promoter‑binding protein 4. The PPI networks showed that DCC and CXCR4 were hub proteins. The DCC‑netrin 1‑roundabout guidance receptor 2‑slit guidance ligand 1 interaction pathway, and several genes, including TOX high mobility group box family member 4, kinase insert domain receptor and zymogen granule protein 16B, which interacted with CXCR4, were novel findings. Additionally, CXCR4 and NCK2 were upregulated in another dataset (GSE8397) of PD. These genes, interactions of proteins and TFs may be important in the progression of PD.
Cytomorphologic differentiation of metastatic breast carcinoma from non breast metastases in cytological materials can be difficult. Current breast immunocytochemical markers have low sensitivities. Transcription factor GATA 3 is a promising marker for detecting breast differentiation in cytological materials. The aim of the study was to assess the diagnostic value of GATA 3 as a breast differentiation marker in metastatic cytological materials and to compare it with expression of mammaglobin and gross cystic disease fluid protein-15 (GCDFP-15).
We retrospectively retrieved 133 cases of metastatic breast carcinoma from the archive the of Cytology Unit between December 2013 and June 2015. They included 77 fine needle aspiration and 56 serous effusion samples. Forty-five cytological materials from non mammary metastatic tumors were used as a control. Immunostaining was performed on cell blocks for the presence of GATA 3, mammaglobin and GCDFP-15.
GATA 3 nuclear staining was detected in 82.7% of metastatic breast carcinomas, and 11.1% of metastatic non mammary adenocarcinomas (p &lt; 0.001). GATA 3 sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value and accuracy were 82.7%, 88.9%, 95.7%, 63.5% and 84.3%, respectively. Mammaglobin and GCDFP-15 staining of metastatic breast carcinoma cases was positive in 70.7% and 47.1%, respectively. GATA 3 staining was significantly higher compared with mammaglobin and GCDFP-15 (p &lt; 0.001).
GATA 3 is more sensitive marker than mammaglobin and GCDFP-15 for diagnosing metastatic breast carcinoma in cytological cell block materials. Adding mammaglobin to GATA 3 resulted in improvement in its sensitivity. GATA 3 was occasionally positive in some metastatic non mammary carcinoma that may cause misdiagnosis.
Results from clinical trials and multiple in vivo and in vitro studies point to melatonin as a promising adjuvant molecule with many beneficial effects when concomitantly administered with chemotherapy. Melatonin palliates side‑effects and enhances the efficacy of chemotherapeutic agents. However, the mechanisms through which melatonin regulates molecular changes induced by chemotherapeutic agents remain largely unknown. In this study, we demonstrated that melatonin enhanced the anti-proliferative and apoptotic responses to low doses of docetaxel in breast cancer cells. Importantly, these effects were more potent when melatonin was added prior to docetaxel. Treatment with 1 µM docetaxel (equivalent to the therapeutic dosage) induced changes in gene expression profiles and melatonin modulated these changes. Specifically, docetaxel downregulated TP53, cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1A (CDKN1A) and cadherin 13 (CDH13), and upregulated mucin 1 (MUC1), GATA binding protein 3 (GATA3) and c-MYC, whereas melatonin counteracted these effects. Melatonin further stimulated the expression of the pro-apoptotic BAD and BAX genes, and enhanced the inhibition of the anti-apoptotic gene BCL-2 induced by docetaxel. The findings of this study suggest that melatonin is a molecule with potential for use as an adjuvant in cancer chemotherapy, which may have implications for designing clinical trials using chemotherapeutic drugs in combination with melatonin.
Mesonephric adenocarcinoma (MNAC) is a rare tumor of the female genital tract mainly occurring in the uterine cervix. To date, only a few cases of MNAC arising from of the uterine body (UB-MNAC) have been reported. The clinicopathologic and molecular characteristics of UB-MNAC remain unknown. In this study, we investigated the clinical, histopathologic, immunohistochemical, and genetic features of UB-MNAC. In total, 11 cases were included. Six patients developed metastatic disease, most commonly in lungs (5/6). Histopathologically, UB-MNAC was characterized by an admixture of tubular, glandular, papillary, retiform, glomeruloid, sex cord-like, and comedonecrosis-like architectural patterns. Three adverse pathologic characteristics, including advanced International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics stage, high mitotic activity, and presence of lymphovascular the invasion, were independent factors predicting the development of metastasis. All cases were positive for GATA-binding protein 3 and paired box 2 expression and showed wild-type p53, patchy p16, and preserved PTEN expression, as indicated by immunohistochemistry. Next-generation sequencing using 12 samples (11 primary tumors and 1 metastatic tumor) revealed 42 single nucleotide variations in 16 genes, mostly in KRAS (10/12) and ARID1A (9/12). Copy number variation was found in 16 genomic regions, and consisted of 57 gains and 10 losses, with 1q gain (11/12) being the most prevalent. In conclusion, UB-MNAC displays an aggressive biological behavior, with a tendency to metastasize to the lungs. Adverse pathologic characteristics reflect the aggressive nature of UB-MNAC. Distinct molecular features of UB-MNAC include frequent somatic mutations of KRAS and ARID1A and gain of 1q.
We have previously demonstrated the expression of GATA-DNA-binding protein (GATA)-3, a transcription factor, in osteoblasts and have verified its function in transducing cell survival signaling. This translational study was further designed to evaluate the roles of GATA-3 in regulating bone healing and to explore its possible mechanisms. A metaphyseal bone defect was created in the left femurs of male ICR mice. Analysis by micro-computed topography showed that the bone volume, trabecular bone number and trabecular thickness were augmented and that the trabecular pattern factor decreased. Interestingly, immunohistological analyses showed specific expression of GATA-3 in the defect area. In addition, colocalized expression of GATA-3 and alkaline phosphatase was observed at the wound site. As the fracture healed, the amounts of phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated GATA-3 concurrently increased. Separately, GATA-3 mRNA was induced during bone healing, and, levels of Runx2 mRNA and protein were also increased. The results of confocal microscopy and co-immunoprecipitation showed an association between nuclear GATA-3 and Runx2 in the area of insult. In parallel with fracture healing, Bcl-XL mRNA was significantly triggered. A bioinformatic search revealed the existence of a GATA-3-specific DNA-binding element in the promoter region of the bcl-xL gene. Analysis by chromatin immunoprecipitation assays further demonstrated transactivation activity by which GATA-3 regulated bcl-xL gene expression. Therefore, this study shows that GATA-3 participates in the healing of bone fractures via regulating bcl-xL gene expression, owing to its association with Runx2. In the clinic, GATA-3 may be used as a biomarker for diagnoses/prognoses or as a therapeutic target for bone diseases, such as bone fractures.
The mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) has become a therapeutic target in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). In T cells, mTOR plays a central role in lineage specification, including development of regulatory cells (Treg cells). This study sought to investigate whether mTOR is activated within Treg cells and whether this contributes to the depletion and dysfunction of Treg cells in patients with SLE.
Activities of mTOR complexes 1 (mTORC1) and 2 (mTORC2) were examined by quantifying phosphorylation of translation initiation factor 4E-binding protein 1, S6 kinase, and Akt in SLE patients relative to age- and sex-matched female healthy control subjects. Polarization of Treg cells from naive CD4+ T cells was assessed in the presence of interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-17, and IL-21. The suppressor function of sorted CD4+CD25+ Treg cells was measured by determining their impact on the proliferation of autologous CD4+CD25- responder T cells. Treg cell expression of FoxP3, GATA-3, and CTLA-4 was monitored by flow cytometry. Autophagy was assessed using immunoblotting of light chain 3 lipidation. The effect of mTOR blockade was evaluated by testing the impact of rapamycin treatment on Treg cell function.
SLE Treg cells exhibited increased activities of mTORC1 and mTORC2, whereas autophagy, the expression of GATA-3 and CTLA-4, and the suppressor function of Treg cells were diminished. IL-21, but not IL-6 or IL-17, blocked the development of Treg cells. IL-21 stimulated mTORC1 and mTORC2, and it abrogated the autophagy, differentiation, and function of Treg cells. Moreover, IL-21 constrained the expression of GATA-3 and CTLA-4 selectively in Treg cells. In turn, blockade of mTORC1 by 3-day rapamycin treatment enhanced transforming growth factor β production, while dual blockade of mTORC1 and mTORC2 by 4-week rapamycin treatment induced autophagy, restored the expression of GATA-3 and CTLA-4, and corrected Treg cell function.
IL-21-driven mTOR activation is a pharmacologically targetable checkpoint of the deficient autophagy that underlies Treg cell dysfunction in SLE.
IL-13-producing CD8+ T cells have been implicated in the pathogenesis of type 2-driven inflammatory human conditions. We have shown that CD8+IL-13+ cells play a critical role in cutaneous fibrosis, the most characteristic feature of systemic sclerosis (SSc; scleroderma). However, the molecular mechanisms underlying production of IL-13 and other type 2 cytokines by CD8+ T cells remain unclear.
We sought to establish the molecular basis of IL-13 overproduction by CD8+ T cells from patients with SSc, focusing on T-bet modulation of GATA-3 activity, which we showed to underlie IL-13 overproduction in CD8+IL-13+ cells from patients with SSc.
Biochemical and biophysical methods were used to determine the expression and association of T-bet, GATA-3, and regulatory factors in CD8+ T cells isolated from the blood and lesional skin of patients with SSc with severe skin thickening. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis determined GATA-3 binding to the IL-13 promoter. ImageStream analysis and confocal microscopy visualized the subcellular localization of T-bet and GATA-3. Transcript levels were decreased by small interfering RNAs.
Interaction of T-bet with the adaptor protein 14-3-3z in the cytosol of CD8+ T cells from patients with SSc reduces T-bet translocation into the nucleus and its ability to associate with GATA-3, allowing more GATA-3 to bind to the IL-13 promoter and inducing IL-13 upregulation. Strikingly, we show that this mechanism is also found during type 2 polarization of CD8+ T cells (TC2) from healthy donors.
We identified a novel molecular mechanism underlying type 2 cytokine production by CD8+ T cells, revealing a more complete picture of the complex pathway leading to SSc disease pathogenesis.
Male breast cancer is an uncommon disease often discovered in advanced stage; thus, in the setting of metastatic adenocarcinoma, breast origin must be taken to account. Breast markers as NY-BR-1, GATA-3, mammaglobin, and BRST-2 are established tools for labelling primary and metastatic female breast cancer; however, none of them has been sufficiently studied in male breast cancer. The aim of this study was to analyze the expression of these markers in male breast cancer.
Thirty consecutive cases of male breast cancer and eight loco-regional metastases were re-revaluated, assembled in tissue micro array (TMA), and stained with immunohistochemistry (IHC) for NY-BR-1, GATA-3, mammaglobin, and BRST-2. The IHC stains were scored either positive or negative. In addition, concordant expression patterns of primary tumors and matched metastasis were noted.
30 of 30 (100%) primary tumors and 8 of 8 (100%) metastases were positive for NY-BR-1. 30 of 30 (100%) primary tumors and 6 of 8 (75%) metastases were positive for GATA-3. 22 of 30 (73.3%) primary tumors and 6 of 8 (75%) metastases were positive for Mammaglobin. 18 of 30 (60%) primary tumors and 5 of 8 (62.5%) metastases were positive for BRST-2. Differences in staining percentage were not significant with Fisher's exact test.
We found a high sensitivity for all the markers analyzed. Moreover, the expression of NY-BR-1 and GATA-3 seemed the most effective for labelling male breast cancer in primary and metastatic setting.
The pathophysiology of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) reflects a balance between mucosal injury and reparative mechanisms. Some regenerating gene (Reg) family members have been reported to be expressed in Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) and to be involved as proliferative mucosal factors in IBD. However, expression of all REG family genes in IBD is still unclear. Here, we analyzed expression of all REG family genes (REG Iα, REG Iβ, REG III, HIP/PAP, and REG IV) in biopsy specimens of UC and CD by real-time RT-PCR. REG Iα, REG Iβ, and REG IV genes were overexpressed in CD samples. REG IV gene was also overexpressed in UC samples. We further analyzed the expression mechanisms of REG Iα, REG Iβ, and REG IV genes in human colon cells. The expression of REG Iα was significantly induced by IL-6 or IL-22, and REG Iβ was induced by IL-22. Deletion analyses revealed that three regions (- 220 to - 211, - 179 to - 156, and - 146 to - 130) in REG Iα and the region (- 274 to- 260) in REG Iβ promoter were responsible for the activation by IL-22/IL-6. The promoters contain consensus transcription factor binding sequences for MZF1, RTEF1/TEAD4, and STAT3 in REG Iα, and HLTF/FOXN2F in REG Iβ, respectively. The introduction of siRNAs for MZF1, RTEF1/TEAD4, STAT3, and HLTF/FOXN2F abolished the transcription of REG Iα and REG Iβ. The gene activation mechanisms of REG Iα/REG Iβ may play a role in colon mucosal regeneration in IBD.
Caveolae are membrane invaginations measuring 50-100 nm. These organelles, composed of caveolin and cavin proteins, are important for cellular signaling and survival. Caveolae play incompletely defined roles in human kidneys. Induction of caveolin-1/CAV1 in diseased tubules has been described previously, but the responsible mechanism remains to be defined.
Healthy and atrophying human kidneys were stained for caveolar proteins, (caveolin 1-3 and cavin 1-4) and examined by electron microscopy. Induction of caveolar proteins was studied in isolated proximal tubules and primary renal epithelial cells. These cells were challenged with hypoxia or H2O2. Primary tubular cells were also subjected to viral overexpression of megakaryoblastic leukemia 1 (MKL1) and MKL1 inhibition by the MKL1 inhibitor CCG-1423. Putative coregulators of MKL1 activity were investigated by Western blotting for suppressor of cancer cell invasion (SCAI) and filamin A (FLNA). Finally, correlative bioinformatic studies of mRNA expression of caveolar proteins and MKL1 were performed.
In healthy kidneys, caveolar proteins were expressed by the parietal epithelial cells (PECs) of Bowman's capsule, endothelial cells and vascular smooth muscle. Electron microscopy confirmed caveolae in the PECs. No expression was seen in proximal tubules. In contrast, caveolar proteins were expressed in proximal tubules undergoing atrophy. Caveolar proteins were also induced in cultures of primary epithelial tubular cells. Expression was not enhanced by hypoxia or free radical stress (H2O2), but proved sensitive to inhibition of MKL1. Viral overexpression of MKL1 induced caveolin-1/CAV1, caveolin-2/CAV2 and SDPR/CAVIN2. In kidney tissue, the mRNA level of MKL1 correlated with the mRNA levels for caveolin-1/CAV1, caveolin-2/CAV2 and the archetypal MKL1 target tenascin C (TNC), as did the MKL1 coactivator FLNA. Costaining for TNC as readout for MKL1 activity demonstrated overlap with caveolin-1/CAV1 expression in PECs as well as in atrophic segments of proximal tubules.
Our findings support the view that MKL1 contributes to the expression of caveolar proteins in healthy kidneys and orchestrates the induction of tubular caveolar proteins in renal injury.
CKLFSF is a protein family that serves as a functional bridge between chemokines and members of the transmembrane 4 superfamily (TM4SF). In the course of evolution, CKLFSF2 has evolved as two isoforms, namely CKLFSF2A and CKLFSF2B, in mice. CKLFSF2A, also known as CMTM2A and ARR19, is expressed in the testis and is important for testicular steroidogenesis. CKLFSF2B is also known to be highly expressed in the testis. In the prepubertal stage, CKLFSF2B is expressed only in Leydig cells, but it is highly expressed in haploid germ cells and Leydig cells in adult testis. CKLFSF2B is naturally processed inside the cell at its C-terminus to yield smaller proteins compared to its theoretical size of ≈25 kDa. The Cklfsf2b gene is regulated by GATA-1 and CREB protein, binding to their respective binding elements present in the 2-kb upstream promoter sequence. In addition, the overexpression of CKLFSF2B inhibited the activity of the Nur77 promoter, which consequently represses the promoter activity of Nur77-target steroidogenic genes such as P450c17, 3β-HSD, and StAR in MA-10 Leydig cells. Adenovirus-mediated overexpression of CKLFSF2B in primary Leydig cells isolated from adult mice shows a repression of steroidogenic gene expression and consequently testosterone production. Moreover, intratesticular injection of CKLFSF2B-expressing adenovirus in adult mice clearly had a repressive effect compared to the control injected with only GFP-expressing adenovirus. Altogether, these findings suggest that CKLFSF2B might be involved in the development and function of Leydig cells and regulate testicular testosterone production by fine-tuning the expression of steroidogenic genes.
GATA transcription factors play a crucial role in the regulation of immune functions across metazoans. In Caenorhabditis elegans, the GATA transcription factor ELT-2 is involved in the control of not only infections but also recovery after an infection. We identified RPT-6, part of the 19S proteasome subunit, as an ELT-2 binding partner that is required for the proper expression of genes required for both immunity against bacterial infections and recovery after infection. We found that the intact ATPase domain of RPT-6 is required for the interaction and that inhibition of rpt-6 affected the expression of ELT-2-controlled genes, preventing the appropriate immune response against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and recovery from infection by the pathogen. Further studies indicated that SKN-1, which is an Nrf transcription factor involved in the response to oxidative stress and infection, is activated by inhibition of rpt-6. Our results indicate that RPT-6 interacts with ELT-2 in vivo to control the expression of immune genes in a manner that is likely independent of the proteolytic activity of the proteasome.
GATA transcription factors (TFs), which bind to DNA in regulatory regions, are involved in cell differentiation and possess a type-IV zinc finger and a DNA-binding domain. GATA genes have been characterized in plant species such as Arabidopsis thaliana, Oryza sativa, and Glycine max, and their functions have been elucidated in A. thaliana. Although many Gossypium quantitative trait loci for fiber quality harbor GATA TFs, GATA genes have not yet been characterized in cotton. In this study, we identified 179 GATA genes from the genomes of three Gossypium species. We analyzed the phylogenetic relationships, chromosomal distribution, gene structure, expression pattern, and predicted promoters of all 179 Gossypium GATA genes (46 in G. raimondii, 46 in G. arboreum, and 87 in G. hirsutum). Phylogenetic analysis grouped the 179 GATA genes into four subfamilies. Domain analysis revealed that GATA domains in subfamilies I, II, and III were located near the C-terminal, whereas those in subfamily IV were adjacent to the N-terminal. RNA-seq and (Real-time PCR) qRT-PCR revealed that 39.1% (34/87) of GATA genes were expressed in growing plant tissues in G. hirsutum, but only 12.6% (11/87) were expressed during fiber development. In addition, 45.7% (21/46) and 26.1% (12/46) of GATA genes were expressed in G. arboreum and G. raimondii, respectively. Our results may be useful for elucidating the evolution, expression patterns, and functional divergence of GATA genes in Gossypium.
Mutations of the GATA binding protein 2 (GATA2) gene in myeloid malignancies usually cluster in the zinc finger 1 (ZF1) and the ZF2 domains. Mutations in different locations of GATA2 may have distinct impact on clinico-biological features and outcomes in AML patients, but little is known in this aspect. In this study, we explored GATA2 mutations in 693 de novo non-M3 AML patients and identified 44 GATA2 mutations in 43 (6.2%) patients, including 31 in ZF1, 10 in ZF2, and three outside the two domains. Different from GATA2 ZF2 mutations, ZF1 mutations were closely associated with French-American-British (FAB) M1 subtype, CEBPA double mutations (CEBPAdouble-mut), but inversely correlated with FAB M4 subtype, NPM1 mutations, and FLT3-ITD. ZF1-mutated AML patients had a significantly longer overall survival (OS) than GATA2-wild patients and ZF2-mutated patients in total cohort as well as in those with intermediate-risk cytogenetics and normal karyotype. ZF1 mutations also predicted better disease-free survival and a trend of better OS in CEBPAdouble-mut patients. Sequential analysis showed GATA2 mutations could be acquired at relapse. In conclusion, GATA2 ZF1 mutations are associated with distinct clinico-biological features and predict better prognosis, different from ZF2 mutations, in AML patients.
Erythropoiesis is regulated at many levels, including control of mRNA translation. Changing environmental conditions, such as hypoxia or the availability of nutrients and growth factors, require a rapid response enacted by the enhanced or repressed translation of existing transcripts. Cold shock domain protein e1 (Csde1/Unr) is an RNA-binding protein required for erythropoiesis and strongly upregulated in erythroblasts relative to other hematopoietic progenitors. The aim of this study is to identify the Csde1-containing protein complexes and investigate their role in post-transcriptional expression control of Csde1-bound transcripts. We show that Serine/Threonine kinase receptor-associated protein (Strap/Unrip), was the protein most strongly associated with Csde1 in erythroblasts. Strap is a WD40 protein involved in signaling and RNA splicing, but its role when associated with Csde1 is unknown. Reduced expression of Strap did not alter the pool of transcripts bound by Csde1. Instead, it altered the mRNA and/or protein expression of several Csde1-bound transcripts that encode for proteins essential for translational regulation during hypoxia, such as Hmbs, eIF4g3 and Pabpc4. Also affected by Strap knockdown were Vim, a Gata-1 target crucial for erythrocyte enucleation, and Elavl1, which stabilizes Gata-1 mRNA. The major cellular processes affected by both Csde1 and Strap were ribosome function and cell cycle control.
Vivax malaria is a leading public health concern worldwide. Due to the high prevalence of Duffy-negative blood group population, Plasmodium vivax in Africa historically is less attributable and remains a neglected disease. The interaction between Duffy binding protein and its cognate receptor, Duffy antigen receptor for chemokine plays a key role in the invasion of red blood cells and serves as a novel vaccine candidate against P. vivax. However, the polymorphic nature of P. vivax Duffy binding protein (DBP), particularly N-terminal cysteine-rich region (PvDBPII), represents a major obstacle for the successful design of a DBP-based vaccine to enable global protection. In this study, the level of pvdbpII sequence variations, Duffy blood group genotypes, number of haplotypes circulating, and the natural selection at pvdbpII in Sudan isolates were analysed and the implication in terms of DBP-based vaccine design was discussed.
Forty-two P. vivax-infected blood samples were collected from patients from different areas of Sudan during 2014-2016. For Duffy blood group genotyping, the fragment that indicates GATA-1 transcription factor binding site of the FY gene (- 33T &gt; C) was amplified by PCR and sequenced by direct sequencing. The region II flanking pvdbpII was PCR amplified and sequenced by direct sequencing. The genetic diversity and natural selection of pvdbpII were done using DnaSP ver 5.0 and MEGA ver 5.0 programs. Based on predominant, non-synonymous, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), prevalence of Sudanese haplotypes was assessed in global isolates.
Twenty SNPs (14 non-synonymous and 6 synonymous) were identified in pvdbpII among the 42 Sudan P. vivax isolates. Sequence analysis revealed that 11 different PvDBP haplotypes exist in Sudan P. vivax isolates and the region has evolved under positive selection. Among the identified PvDBP haplotypes five PvDBP haplotypes were shared among Duffy-negative as well as Duffy-positive individuals. The high selective pressure was mainly found on the known B cell epitopes (H3) of pvdbpII. Comparison of Sudanese haplotypes, based on 10 predominant non-synonymous SNPs with 10 malaria-endemic countries, demonstrated that Sudanese haplotypes were prevalent in most endemic countries.
This is the first pvdbp genetic diversity study from an African country. Sudanese isolates display high haplotype diversity and the gene is under selective pressure. Haplotype analysis indicated that Sudanese haplotypes are a representative sample of the global population. However, studies with a large number of samples are needed. These findings would be valuable for the development of PvDBP-based malaria vaccine.
Notch3 and GATA binding protein 3 (GATA-3) have been, individually, shown to maintain luminal phenotype and inhibit epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in breast cancers. In the present study, we report that Notch3 expression positively correlates with that of GATA-3, and both are associated with estrogen receptor-α (ERα) expression in breast cancer cells. We demonstrate in vitro and in vivo that Notch3 suppressed EMT and breast cancer metastasis by activating GATA-3 transcription. Furthermore, Notch3 knockdown downregulated GATA-3 and promoted EMT; while overexpression of Notch3 intracellular domain upregulated GATA-3 and inhibited EMT, leading to a suppression of metastasis in vivo. Moreover, inhibition or overexpression of GATA-3 partially reversed EMT or mesenchymal-epithelial transition induced by Notch3 alterations. In breast cancer patients, high GATA-3 expression is associated with higher Notch3 expression and lower lymph node metastasis, especially for hormone receptor (HR) positive cancers. Herein, we demonstrate a novel mechanism whereby Notch3 inhibit EMT by transcriptionally upregulating GATA-3 expression, at least in part, leading to the suppression of cancer metastasis in breast cancers. Our findings expand our current knowledge on Notch3 and GATA-3's roles in breast cancer metastasis.
Tree nuts are among "Big Eight" and have been reported globally for causing allergy. Buchanania lanzan (Bl) is one of the major tree nuts consumed by Indian population. However, very little is known about B. lanzan's induced allergic manifestation. Therefore, evaluation of it's allergenic potential was undertaken. Bl-crude protein extract sensitized BALB/c mice sera were used to identify the allergic proteins by it's IgE binding capability. The major IgE binding proteins found with molecular weight of 11, 20, 23, 25, 48, 54, and 65 kDa. Specific IgE, specific IgG1, MCPT-1, PGD2 and histamine were assessed in mice sera. Enormous amount of mast cell infiltration was noted in different organs. The levels of Th1/Th2 transcription factors GATA-3, SOCS3 and STAT-6 were found upregulated, whereas T-bet was downregulated. Furthermore, elevated Th1/Th2 cytokine responses were observed in mice sera. All together, these reactions developed systemic anaphylaxis upon Bl-CPE challenge in sensitized BALB/c mice. In order to confirm the evidences obtained from the studies carried out in BALB/c, the investigation was extended to human subjects as well. Control subjects and allergic patients were subjected to skin prick test (SPT). Later sera collected from those positive to SPT along with controls were used for IgE immunoblotting. The study evaluated the allergic manifestation associated with Bl, and identified it's proteins attributing Bl-mediated allergy. This work may help in managing tree nuts mediated allergies especially due to Buchanania lanzan sensitization.
GATA binding protein 3 (GATA3) immunohistochemistry is primarily used as a marker of breast and urothelial differentiation, particularly in metastatic settings. In the gynecologic tract it also serves a robust marker for mesonephric and trophoblastic tumors. However, expression has also been described in more common malignancies of gynecologic tract including ovarian, endometrial, and cervical carcinomas. Data on the distribution of GATA3 expression in gynecologic malignancies is somewhat limited, particularly across different histologic subtypes of ovarian, endometrial, and cervical carcinomas. To assess the rates of GATA3 expression among common gynecologic cancers of various histologic types, 100 ovarian carcinomas, 64 endometrial carcinomas/atypical hyperplasias, 16 cervical squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs), and 14 endocervical adenocarcinomas were evaluated by immunohistochemistry for GATA3 positivity. Eight percent of endometrial carcinomas expressed GATA3, including 2 serous carcinomas, 1 carcinosarcoma, and 1 case of atypical hyperplasia. Six percent of ovarian carcinomas were GATA3-positive including 2 clear cell carcinomas, 2 mucinous adenocarcinomas, and 2 high-grade serous carcinomas. Thirty-eight percent of cervical SCCs showed weak to moderate staining in up to 50% of tumor cells. All endocervical adenocarcinomas were entirely negative for GATA3. In summary, GATA3 shows focal weak to moderate expression in a subset of endometrial and ovarian carcinomas. In contrast, usual-type endocervical adenocarcinomas are typically negative for GATA3, which can be helpful in differentiating them from mesonephric proliferations or carcinomas. A larger proportion of cervical SCCs express GATA3, therefore caution should be exercised when using this stain in the setting of a lower genitourinary carcinomas.
Slc39a8 encodes ZIP8, a divalent cation/bicarbonate symporter expressed in pluripotent mouse embryonic stem cells, and therefore ubiquitous in adult tissues; ZIP8 influxes Zn2+, Mn2+ and Fe2+. Slc39a8(neo/neo) knockdown mice exhibit 10-15% of wild-type ZIP8 mRNA and protein levels, and show pleiotropic phenotype of stunted growth, neonatal lethality, multi-organ dysmorphogenesis, and dysregulated hematopoiesis manifested as severe anemia. Herein we performed RNA-seq analysis of gestational day (GD)13.5 yolk sac and placenta, and GD16.5 liver, kidney, lung, heart and cerebellum, comparing Slc39a8(neo/neo) with Slc39a8(+/+) wild-type. Meta-data analysis of differentially-expressed genes revealed 29 unique genes from all tissues - having enriched GO categories associated with hematopoiesis and hypoxia and KEGG categories of complement, response to infection, and coagulation cascade - consistent with dysregulated hematopoietic stem cell fate. Based on transcription factor (TF) profiles in the JASPAR database, and searching for TF-binding sites enriched by Pscan, we identified numerous genes encoding zinc-finger and other TFs associated with hematopoietic stem cell functions. We conclude that, in this mouse model, deficient ZIP8-mediated divalent cation transport affects zinc-finger (e.g. GATA proteins) and other TFs interacting with GATA proteins (e.g. TAL1), predominantly in yolk sac. These data strongly support the phenotype of dysmorphogenesis and anemia seen in Slc39a8(neo/neo) mice in utero.
Genetic aberrations driving pro-oncogenic and pro-metastatic activity remain an elusive target in the quest of precision oncology. To identify such drivers, we use an animal model of KRAS-mutant lung adenocarcinoma to perform an in vivo functional screen of 217 genetic aberrations selected from lung cancer genomics datasets. We identify 28 genes whose expression promoted tumor metastasis to the lung in mice. We employ two tools for examining the KRAS-dependence of genes identified from our screen: 1) a human lung cell model containing a regulatable mutant KRAS allele and 2) a lentiviral system permitting co-expression of DNA-barcoded cDNAs with Cre recombinase to activate a mutant KRAS allele in the lungs of mice. Mechanistic evaluation of one gene, GATAD2B, illuminates its role as a dual activity gene, promoting both pro-tumorigenic and pro-metastatic activities in KRAS-mutant lung cancer through interaction with c-MYC and hyperactivation of the c-MYC pathway.
Agents designed to block or alter cytokinesis can kill or stop proliferation of cancer cells. We aimed to identify cytokinesis-related proteins that are overexpressed in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells and might be targeted to slow liver tumor growth.
Using the Oncomine database, we compared the gene expression patterns in 16 cancer microarray datasets and assessed gene enrichment sets using gene ontology. We performed immunohistochemical analysis of an HCC tissue microarray and identified changes in protein levels that are associated with patient survival times. Candidate genes were overexpressed or knocked down with small hairpin RNAs in SMMC7721, MHCC97H, or HCCLM3 cell lines; we analyzed their proliferation, viability, and clone-formation ability and their growth as subcutaneous or orthotopic xenograft tumors in mice. We performed microarray analyses to identify alterations in signaling pathways and immunoblot and immunofluorescence assays to detect and localize proteins in tissues. Yeast 2-hybrid screens and mass spectrometry combined with co-immunoprecipitation experiments were used to identify binding proteins. Protein interactions were validated with co-immunoprecipitation and proximity ligation assays. Chromatin immunoprecipitation, promoter luciferase activity, and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction analyses were used to identify factors that regulate transcription of specific genes.
The genes that were most frequently overexpressed in different types of cancer cells were involved in cell division processes. We identified 3 cytokinesis-regulatory proteins among the 10 genes most frequently overexpressed by all cancer cell types. Rac GTPase activating protein 1 (RACGAP1) was the cytokinesis-regulatory protein that was most highly overexpressed in multiple cancers. Increased expression of RACGAP1 in tumor tissues was associated with shorter survival times of patients with cancer. Knockdown of RACGAP1 in HCC cells induced cytokinesis failure and cell apoptosis. In microarray analyses, we found knockdown of RACGAP1 in SMMC7721 cells to reduce expression of genes regulated by yes-associated protein (YAP) and WW domain containing transcription regulator 1 (WWTR1 or TAZ). RACGAP1 reduced activation of the Hippo pathway in HCC cells by increasing activity of RhoA and polymerization of filamentous actin. Knockdown of YAP reduced phosphorylation of RACGAP1 and redistribution at the anaphase central spindle. We found transcription of the translocated promoter region, nuclear basket protein (TPR) to be regulated by YAP and coordinately expressed with RACGAP1 to promote proliferation of HCC cells. TPR redistributed upon nuclear envelope breakdown and formed complexes with RACGAP1 during mitosis. Knockdown of TPR in HCC cells reduced phosphorylation of RACGAP1 by aurora kinase B and impaired their redistribution at the central spindle during cytokinesis. STAT3 activated transcription of RACGAP in HCC cells.
In an analysis of gene expression patterns of multiple tumor types, we found RACGAP1 to be frequently overexpressed, which is associated with shorter survival times of patients. RACGAP1 promotes proliferation of HCC cells by reducing activation of the Hippo and YAP pathways and promoting cytokinesis in coordination with TPR.
Fundamental questions regarding how chloroplasts develop from proplastids remain poorly understood despite their central importance to plant life. Two families of nuclear transcription factors, the GATA NITRATE-INDUCIBLE CARBON-METABOLISM-INVOLVED (GNC) and GOLDEN TWO-LIKE (GLK) families, have been implicated in directly and positively regulating chloroplast development. Here, we determined the degree of functional overlap between the two transcription factor families in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), characterizing their ability to regulate chloroplast biogenesis both alone and in concert. We determined the DNA-binding motifs for GNC and GLK2 using protein-binding microarrays; the enrichment of these motifs in transcriptome datasets indicates that GNC and GLK2 are repressors and activators of gene expression, respectively. ChIP-seq analysis of GNC identified PHYTOCHROME INTERACTING FACTOR and brassinosteroid activity genes as targets whose repression by GNC facilitates chloroplast biogenesis. In addition, GNC targets and represses genes involved in ERECTA signaling and thereby facilitates stomatal development. Our results define key regulatory features of the GNC and GLK transcription factor families that contribute to the control of chloroplast biogenesis and photosynthetic activity, including areas of independence and cross talk.
A challenge for evolutionary research is to uncover how new morphological traits evolve the coordinated spatial and temporal expression patterns of genes that govern their formation during development. Detailed studies are often limited to characterizing how one or a few genes contributed to a trait's emergence, and thus our knowledge of how entire GRNs evolve their coordinated expression of each gene remains unresolved. The melanic color patterns decorating the male abdominal tergites of Drosophila (D.) melanogaster evolved in part by novel expression patterns for genes acting at the terminus of a pigment metabolic pathway, driven by cis-regulatory elements (CREs) with distinct mechanisms of Hox regulation. Here, we examined the expression and evolutionary histories of two important enzymes in this pathway, encoded by the pale and Ddc genes. We found that while both genes exhibit dynamic patterns of expression, a robust pattern of Ddc expression specifically evolved in the lineage of fruit flies with pronounced melanic abdomens. Derived Ddc expression requires the activity of a CRE previously shown to activate expression in response to epidermal wounding. We show that a binding site for the Grainy head transcription factor that promotes the ancestral wound healing function of this CRE is also required for abdominal activity. Together with previous findings in this system, our work shows how the GRN for a novel trait emerged by assembling unique yet similarly functioning CREs from heterogeneous starting points.
Helminths may alter the immunoinflammatory reactions of colitis. Proteins derived from H. polygyrus have prospective therapy for colitis. The goal of this study was to interpret the protective mechanisms of L4 somatic antigen (LSA) from Heligmosomoides polygyrus against an inflammatory response to the pathogenesis of DNBS-induced colitis. Colitis was actuated in mice by rectal instillation of DNBS. The mice were randomly divided into five groups containing control, DNBS alone, and three groups, with different doses of LSA (50, 100, and 200 μg/mL), respectively. Mice initiated colitis by rectal administration of DNBS and after that were immunized with LSA for 14 days. Mice treated with LSA inhibited wasting disease compared with DNBS only group. The percentages of cells producing IFN-γ were reduced by LSA treatment. The level of T lymphocytes CD4+IFN-γ+ cells in the LPL was significantly diminished by LSA at both 100 and 200 μg/mL groups (p&lt;0.05). The mRNA expression of T-bet was significantly declined in LSA immunized mice, but not RORγ-T mRNA, whereas GATA-3 expression tended to increase. The activation of STAT-4 significantly reduced LSA-treated mice but not STAT-1. It can be concluded that 
                        T-bet
                     is required for optimal production of 
                        IFN
                     -γ in colitis.
Adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (Ad-MSCs) have been reported to suppress the effector T cell responses and have beneficial effects on various immune disorders, like rheumatoid arthritis (RA). This study was designed to investigate the effects of co-cultured Ad-MSCs on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of RA patients and healthy individuals, through assessing transcription factors of T cell subsets. PBMCs from RA patients and healthy donors were co-cultured with Ad-MSCs with or without Phytohaemagglutinin (PHA). The quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was used to measure the expression of T-box 21 (T-bet), GATA-binding protein-3 (GATA3), retinoid-related orphan receptor γt (ROR-γt) and forkhead box P3 (Foxp3). Based on the results, Ad-MSCs greatly upregulated Th2 and Treg cell transcription factors, i.e., GATA3 and Foxp3 (p&lt;0.05), and downregulated Th1 and Th17 transcription factors, i.e., T-bet and RORγt (p&lt;0.05). These results demonstrate that Ad-MSCs can result in an immunosuppressive environment through inhibition of pro-inflammatory T cells and induction of T cells with a regulatory phenotype. Therefore, they might have important clinical implications for inflammatory and autoimmune diseases such as RA.
Ageing constitutes the most important risk factor for all major chronic ailments, including malignant, cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases. However, behavioural and pharmacological interventions with feasible potential to promote health upon ageing remain rare. Here we report the identification of the flavonoid 4,4'-dimethoxychalcone (DMC) as a natural compound with anti-ageing properties. External DMC administration extends the lifespan of yeast, worms and flies, decelerates senescence of human cell cultures, and protects mice from prolonged myocardial ischaemia. Concomitantly, DMC induces autophagy, which is essential for its cytoprotective effects from yeast to mice. This pro-autophagic response induces a conserved systemic change in metabolism, operates independently of TORC1 signalling and depends on specific GATA transcription factors. Notably, we identify DMC in the plant Angelica keiskei koidzumi, to which longevity- and health-promoting effects are ascribed in Asian traditional medicine. In summary, we have identified and mechanistically characterised the conserved longevity-promoting effects of a natural anti-ageing drug.
Pagetoid spread of urothelial carcinoma (UC) to the lower genital tract is quite a rare and diagnostically challenging condition. Pagetoid urothelial intraepithelial neoplasia extending to the vagina is difficult to diagnose, especially in remote recurrences without symptomatic or macroscopic lesions typical to Paget disease. However, its identification by cervical screening cytology is important because UC is often characterized by a long history of relapse.
A 68-year-old Japanese postmenopausal woman developed brown vaginal discharge after radical cystectomy for bladder cancer (high-grade UC, pT2a pN0 cM0 [Union for International Cancer Control, 8th edition]) concomitant with focal in-situ UC in the urethra. She had a history of left renal pelvis UC, which was surgically removed 9 months before the radical cystectomy. Gynecologic examination of the lower genital tract was unremarkable although cervical screening cytology demonstrated severely atypical cells with pleomorphism repeatedly. Cervical colposcopy and diagnostic conization revealed no cervical neoplasm. In retrospect, immunocytochemical p16/Ki-67 dual staining for the previous cervical screening was negative for p16 labeling, and the neoplastic cells were positive for cytokeratins 7 and 20, p63, and GATA binding protein 3. No high-risk human papillomavirus genotype was identified by an automated DNA chip system using liquid-based cytology samples. Eleven months post-cystectomy, punch biopsy of the vulva and vagina confirmed intraepithelial UC in the juxtaposed squamous epithelium with pagetoid spread demonstrating positivity for specific urothelial markers: uroplakins II and III and thrombomodulin. Concurrent invasive malignancy was ruled out, and CO2 laser vaporization of the vulvar and vaginal lesion was performed. The patient remained alive without evidence of invasive malignancy for 14 months after the radical cystectomy for bladder cancer.
To detect recurrent pagetoid urothelial intraepithelial neoplasia with pagetoid spread in the lower genital tract, pathologists should recognize the history of prior UC with special attention to absence of p16 labeling in cervical cytology as a pointer to the diagnosis of urothelial cancer. Using further biopsy and immunohistochemical confirmation of UC relapse, investigation to rule out invasive malignancies and careful follow-up throughout the patient's lifetime is recommended.
Group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) have tissue-resident competence and contribute to the pathogenesis of allergic diseases. However, the mechanisms regulating prolonged ILC2-mediated TH2 cytokine production under chronic inflammatory conditions are unclear. Here we show that, at homeostasis, Runx deficiency induces excessive ILC2 activation due to overly active GATA-3 functions. By contrast, during allergic inflammation, the absence of Runx impairs the ability of ILC2s to proliferate and produce effector TH2 cytokines and chemokines. Instead, functional deletion of Runx induces the expression of exhaustion markers, such as IL-10 and TIGIT, on ILC2s. Finally, these 'exhausted-like' ILC2s are unable to induce type 2 immune responses to repeated allergen exposures. Thus, Runx confers competence for sustained ILC2 activity at the mucosa, and contributes to allergic pathogenesis.
: Insulin resistance is present in the majority of patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) and obesity. In this study, we aimed to investigate the key genes and potential molecular mechanism in insulin resistance. Expression profiles of the genes were extracted from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. Pathway and Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analyses were conducted at Enrichr. The protein⁻protein interaction (PPI) network was settled and analyzed using the Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes (STRING) database constructed by Cytoscape software. Modules were extracted and identified by the PEWCC1 plugin. The microRNAs (miRNAs) and transcription factors (TFs) which control the expression of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were analyzed using the NetworkAnalyst algorithm. A database (GSE73108) was downloaded from the GEO databases. Our results identified 873 DEGs (435 up-regulated and 438 down-regulated) genetically associated with insulin resistance. The pathways which were enriched were pathways in complement and coagulation cascades and complement activation for up-regulated DEGs, while biosynthesis of amino acids and the Notch signaling pathway were among the down-regulated DEGs. Showing GO enrichment were cardiac muscle cell⁻cardiac muscle cell adhesion and microvillus membrane for up-regulated DEGs and negative regulation of osteoblast differentiation and dendrites for down-regulated DEGs. Subsequently, myosin VB (MYO5B), discs, large homolog 2(DLG2), axin 2 (AXIN2), protein tyrosine kinase 7 (PTK7), Notch homolog 1 (NOTCH1), androgen receptor (AR), cyclin D1 (CCND1) and Rho family GTPase 3 (RND3) were diagnosed as the top hub genes in the up- and down-regulated PPI network and modules. In addition, GATA binding protein 6 (GATA6) , ectonucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase 5 (ENPP5), cyclin D1 (CCND1) and tubulin, beta 2A (TUBB2A) were diagnosed as the top hub genes in the up- and down-regulated target gene⁻miRNA network, while tubulin, beta 2A (TUBB2A), olfactomedin-like 1 (OLFML1), prostate adrogen-regulated mucin-like protein 1 (PARM1) and aldehyde dehydrogenase 4 family, member A1 (ALDH4A1)were diagnosed as the top hub genes in the up- and down-regulated target gene⁻TF network. The current study based on the GEO database provides a novel understanding regarding the mechanism of insulin resistance and may provide novel therapeutic targets.
During erythropoiesis, haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) differentiate in successive steps of commitment and specification to mature erythrocytes. This differentiation process is controlled by transcription factors that establish stage- and cell type-specific gene expression. In this study, we demonstrate that FUSE binding protein 1 (FUBP1), a transcriptional regulator important for HSC self-renewal and survival, is regulated by T-cell acute lymphocytic leukaemia 1 (TAL1) in erythroid progenitor cells. TAL1 directly activates the FUBP1 promoter, leading to increased FUBP1 expression during erythroid differentiation. The binding of TAL1 to the FUBP1 promoter is highly dependent on an intact GATA sequence in a combined E-box/GATA motif. We found that FUBP1 expression is required for efficient erythropoiesis, as FUBP1-deficient progenitor cells were limited in their potential of erythroid differentiation. Thus, the finding of an interconnection between GATA1/TAL1 and FUBP1 reveals a molecular mechanism that is part of the switch from progenitor- to erythrocyte-specific gene expression. In summary, we identified a TAL1/FUBP1 transcriptional relationship, whose physiological function in haematopoiesis is connected to proper erythropoiesis.
GATA transcription factors (GATAs) are widely expressed among various organisms and belong to the zinc finger protein family. GATA transcription factors play important roles in the proliferation, differentiation, and development of eukaryotes. Previous studies have shown that GATA participates in oogenesis by selective splicing in silkworms. In this study, we investigated the function of GATAs during vitellogenesis using female silkworms (Bombyx mori). Six types of GATA transcription factors were successfully cloned in the fat body of silkworms during the wandering stage and only BmGATAβ4 induced the activity of the Bombyx mori vitellogenin (BmVg) promoter. Furthermore, BmVg and BmGATAβ4 exhibited similar expression patterns in the fat body of female silkworms during the wandering stage. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays, cell transfection assays, and chromatin immunoprecipitation showed that BmGATAβ4 was involved in regulating the transcription of BmVg by directly binding to the GATA cis-response element 1 (CRE1) and GATA cis-response element 2 (CRE2) in the promoter of the BmVg gene. RNA interference of BmGATAβ4 in female silkworms downregulated BmVg transcription, resulting in a decrease in egg size and shortening of the length of egg tubes relative to the control. In summary, our results indicated that BmGATAβ4 bound to the GATA CRE1 and CRE2 motifs in the BmVg promoter to upregulate BmVg expression in the fat body of female silkworms.
Follicular dendritic cell-secreted protein (FDC-SP) is expressed in FDCs, human periodontal ligament (HPL) cells, and junctional epithelium. To evaluate the effects of interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β) on FDC-SP gene expression in immortalized HPL cells, FDC-SP mRNA and protein levels in HPL cells following stimulation by IL-1β were measured by real-time polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting. Luciferase (LUC), gel mobility shift, and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analyses were performed to study the interaction between transcription factors and promoter regions in the human FDC-SP gene. IL-1β (1 ng/mL) induced the expression of FDC-SP mRNA and protein levels at 3 h, and reached maximum levels at 12 h. IL-1β increased LUC activities of constructs (-116FDCSP - -948FDCSP) including the FDC-SP gene promoter. Transcriptional inductions by IL-1β were partially inhibited by 3-base-pair (3-bp) mutations in the Yin Yang 1 (YY1), GATA, CCAAT-enhancer-binding protein2 (C/EBP2), or C/EBP3 in the -345FDCSP. IL-1β-induced -345FDCSP activities were inhibited by protein kinase A, tyrosine-kinase, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MEK)1/2, and PI3-kinase inhibitors. The results of gel shift and ChIP assays revealed that YY1, GATA, and C/EBP-β interacted with the YY1, GATA, C/EBP2, and C/EBP3 elements that were increased by IL-1β. These studies demonstrate that IL-1β increases FDC-SP gene transcription in HPL cells by targeting YY1, GATA, C/EBP2, and C/EBP3 in the human FDC-SP gene promoter.
The molecular basis of unilesional mycosis fungoides (MF), characterized by a solitary lesion that is clinicopathologically indistinguishable from multifocal patch or plaque MF (early MF), is unknown.
To investigate the microRNA profile in unilesional MF distinguishing it from early MF.
Biopsy samples of unilesional MF and early MF were evaluated with the Affymetrix microRNA array, with further comparison with inflammatory dermatosis, using quantitative polymerase chain reaction. NanoString technology was applied to analyse the gene expression of T helper (Th)1 immune markers, and immunohistochemistry was used to evaluate CXCR3 and GATA-binding protein 3 (GATA3) markers for Th1 and Th2 cells, respectively.
Unilesional MF had a significantly higher level of expression of all members of the microRNA miR-17~92 cluster than early MF. Specifically, unilesional MF had a higher miR-17 level than early MF and inflammatory dermatoses. There was downregulation of the expression of phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) and CREB1, known targets of miR-17~92 members; higher gene expression of interleukin-2 and interferon-γ; and a statistically lower average percentage of GATA3+ dermal cells (6·7% vs. 42·3%), were detected in unilesional MF compared with early MF. High immunoreactivity of CXCR3 was noted in both unilesional and early MF.
Unilesional MF exhibits a microRNA profile distinct from that of conventional early MF, with a higher level of miR-17~92 members along with Th1 skewing. These findings suggest a robust reactive T-cell immune response in unilesional MF and might account for the localized nature of this disease.
Zn serves as a powerful feed additive to reduce post-weaning diarrhoea in pigs. However, the mechanisms responsible for Zn-associated effects on the adaptive immune responses following feeding of a very high dosage of Zn remain elusive. In this study, we examined the T-cell response in gut-associated lymphatic tissues of seventy-two weaned piglets. Piglets received diets with 57 mg Zn/kg (low Zn concentration, LZn), 164 mg Zn/kg (medium Zn concentration, MZn) or 2425 mg Zn/kg (high Zn concentration, HZn) mg Zn/kg feed for 1, 2 or 4 weeks. We observed that feeding the HZn diet for 1 week increased the level of activated T-helper cells (CD4+ and CD8α dim) compared with feeding MZn and LZn (P&lt;0·05). In addition, we observed higher transcript amounts of interferon γ and T-box 21 (TBET) in the HZn group compared with the MZn and LZn groups (P&lt;0·05). A gene set enrichment analysis revealed an over-representation of genes associated with 'cytokine signalling in immune system'. Remarkably, feeding of a very high Zn dosage led to a switch in the immune response after 2 weeks. We detected higher relative cell counts of CD4+CD25high regulatory T-helper cells (P&lt;0·05) and a higher expression of forkhead box P3 (FOXP3) transcripts (P&lt;0·05). After 4 weeks of feeding a high-dosage Zn diet, the relative CD4+ T-cell count (P&lt;0·05) and the relative CD8β + T-cell count (P&lt;0·1) were reduced compared with the MZn group. We hypothesise that after 1 week the cellular T-helper 1 response is switched on and after 2 weeks it is switched off, leading to decreased numbers of T-cells.
Bile acids play significant role in body homeostasis regulation. They are products of cholesterol catabolism and ligands for some nuclear receptors regulating crucial metabolic pathways. The main enzyme regulating bile acids biosynthesis is CYP7A1 (7alpha-cholesterol hydroxylase). Its activity is controlled mainly at the transcription level and the key transcription factor is FXR. It is activated by other nuclear receptors like SHP, HNF-4alpha or LRH-1 and bile acids themselves, and represses CYP7A1 gene. The other transcription factors that inhibit CYP7A1 activity, are PXR, VDR, PPARalpha. The main activator is LXR (in rodents), increasing CYP7A1 transcriptional activity. CYP7A1 activity increases in presence of insulin and glucocorticoids. It is also regulated by diurnal rhythm. Some of those factors influence the activities of other bile acids biosynthesis enzymes--CYP7B1, CYP27A1, CYP8B1. Because of bile acids significant function in body metabolism this article presents the newest knowledge on mechanisms of key enzymes activities control.
The aim of this study was to explore the role of farnesoid X receptor (FXR) in liver lipid metabolism of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) patients.
In this study, pathology and clinical criteria confirmed NAFLD in patients. Fatty acid synthetase (FAS)-positive liver cells were visualized by laser scanning confocal microscopy. Levels of FXR, liver X receptor (LXR), sterol regulatory element binding protein 1C (SREBP-1C), and small heterodimer partner (SHP) proteins were detected by Western blot. FXR, LXR, and SHP mRNA levels were measured by real-time PCR.
In patients with NAFLD, a significant positive relationship between the degree of hepatic steatosis and serum triglycerides and cholesterol (correlation coefficient &gt; 0.5, P &lt; 0.05) was seen. The NAFLD patients had more FAS protein in liver, which suggests that there could have been more of fatty acid synthesis in hepatic cells (P &lt; 0.05). The levels of FXR protein and mRNA were decreased in patients with NAFLD (P &lt; 0.05), while those of LXR and SREBP-1C were increased (P &lt; 0.05). The levels of SREBP-1C positively correlated with the degree of hepatic steatosis. There were no differences between the levels of SHP protein and mRNA both in NAFLD patients and normal controls (P &gt; 0.05).
Our data showed that the decreased expression of hepatic FXR is associated with an increased expression of LXR, SREBP-1C, and hepatic triglyceride synthesis; furthermore, increased SREBP-1C is associated with the degree of hepatic steatosis in the NAFLD patients.
Hepatocyte-specific NEMO/NF-κB deleted mice (NEMO(Δhepa)) develop spontaneous non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Free fatty acids and bile acids promote DR5 expression. TRAIL/NK cell-mediated activation of TRAIL-R2/DR5 plays an important role during acute injury in NEMO(Δhepa) mice.
To inhibit the progression of NASH in the absence of hepatocyte-NEMO/NF-kB signaling.
NEMOf/f and NEMO(Δhepa) mice were fed with a low-fat diet, and with two anticholestatic diets; UDCA and NorUDCA. The impact of these treatments on the progression of NASH was evaluated.
We show that high expression of DR5 in livers from NEMO(Δhepa) mice is accompanied by an abundant presence of bile acids (BAs), misregulation of BA transporters and significant alteration of lipid metabolism-related genes. Additionally, mice lacking NEMO in hepatocytes spontaneously showed ductular response at young age. Unexpectedly, feeding of NEMO(Δhepa) mice with low-fat diet failed to improve chronic liver injury. Conversely, anti-cholestatic treatment with nor-ursodeoxycholic acid (NorUDCA), but not with ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA), led to a significant attenuation of liver damage in NEMO(Δhepa) mice. The strong therapeutic effect of NorUDCA relied on a significant downregulation of LXR-dependent lipogenesis and the normalisation of BA metabolism through mechanisms involving cross-talk between Cyp7a1 and SHP. This was associated with the significant improvement of liver histology, NEMO(Δhepa)/NorUDCA-treated mice showed lower apoptosis and reduced CyclinD1 expression, indicating attenuation of the compensatory proliferative response to hepatocellular damage. Finally, fibrosis and ductular reaction markers were significantly reduced in NorUDCA-treated NEMO(Δhepa) mice.
Overall, our work demonstrates the contribution of bile acids metabolism to the progression of NASH in the absence of hepatocyte-NF-kB through mechanisms involving DR5-apoptosis, inflammation and fibrosis. Our work suggests a potential therapeutic effect of NorUDCA in attenuating the progression of NASH.
Human body needs to protect itself from a diverse array of harmful chemicals. These chemicals are also involved in drug metabolism, enzyme induction, and can cause adverse drug-drug interactions. Being a member of nuclear receptors (NRs), pregnane X receptor (PXR) has recently emerged as transcriptional regulators of cytochrome P450 (CYP) and transporters expression so as to against xenobiotics exposure. This review describes some common nuclear receptors, i.e. farnesoid X receptor (FXR), small heterodimer partner (SHP), hepatocyte nuclear factor-4alpha (HNF-4alpha), liver X receptor (LXR), glucocorticoid receptor (GR), constitutive androstane receptor (CAR) that crosstalk with PXR and involvement of coregulators thus control target genes expression.
Nuclear receptors are involved in regulating the expression of cholesterol 7alpha-hydroxylase (CYP7A1), however, their roles in the up-regulation of CYP7A1 by cholestyramine (CSR) are still unclear. In the present study, male Wistar rats were divided into four groups and fed [high sucrose + 10% lard diet] (H), [H + 3% CSR diet] (H + CSR), [H + 0.5% cholesterol + 0.25% sodium cholate diet] (C), or [C + 3% CSR diet] (C + CSR) for 2 weeks. Cholestyramine decreased serum and liver cholesterol levels significantly in rats fed C-based diets, but had no effect on these parameters in rats fed H-based diets. Cholestyramine raised hepatic levels of CYP7A1 mRNA and activity in both groups. The gene expression of hepatic ATP-binding cassettes A1 and G5, regulated by liver X receptor (LXR), were unchanged and down-regulated by cholestyramine, respectively. The mRNA levels of the hepatic ATP-binding cassette B11 and short heterodimer partner (SHP), regulated by farnesoid X receptor (FXR), were not changed by cholestyramine. C-based diets, which contained cholesterol and cholic acid, increased SHP mRNA levels compared to H-based diets. Consequently, in rats fed the C+CSR diet, hepatic FXR was activated by dietary bile acids, but the hepatic CYP7A1 mRNA level was increased 16-fold compared to that in rats fed an H diet. These results suggest that cholestyramine up-regulates the expression of CYP7A1 independently via LXR- or FXR-mediated pathways in rats.
The fetoprotein transcription factor (FTF) gene was inactivated in the mouse, with a lacZ gene inserted inframe into exon 4. LacZ staining of FTF+/- embryos shows that the mFTF gene is activated at initial stages of zygotic transcription. FTF gene activity is ubiquitous at the morula and blastocyst stages and then follows expression patterns indicative of multiple FTF functions in fetal development. FTF-/- embryos die at E6.5-7.5, with features typical of visceral endoderm dysfunction. Adult FTF+/- mice are hypocholesterolemic, and express liver FTF at about 40% of the normal level. Overexpression of liver FTF in transgenic mice indicates in vivo that FTF is an activator of CYP7A1. However, CYP7A1 expression is increased in FTF+/- liver. Gene expression profiles indicate that higher CYP7A1 expression is caused by attenuated liver cell stress signaling. Diet experiments support a model where FTF is quenched both by activated c-Jun, and by SHP as a stronger feedback mechanism to repress CYP7A1. A DR4 element is conserved in the FTF gene promoter and activated by LXR-RXR and TR-RXR, qualifying the FTF gene as a direct metabolic sensor. Liver FTF increases in rats treated with thyroid hormone or a high cholesterol diet. The FTF DR4 element tightens functional links between FTF and LXRalpha in cholesterol homeostasis and can explain transient surges of FTF gene activities during development and FTF levels lower than predicted in FTF+/- liver. The FTF-lacZ mouse establishes a central role for FTF in developmental, nutritive, and metabolic functions from early embryogenesis through adulthood.
The small heterodimer partner (SHP) is an atypical nuclear receptor lacking the N-terminal ligand-independent activation domain and the DNA binding domain. SHP acts as transcriptional inhibitor of a large set of nuclear receptors, among which ER, AR, CAR, RXR, GR, LXR and ERRgamma. The repression mechanism of SHP involves several actions including competition with coactivators binding on the AF-2 of nuclear receptors and recruitment of transcriptional inhibitors such as EID-1. The investigation of the structure and repression mechanism of SHP is a challenging task for a full understanding of nuclear receptor interaction pathways and functions. So far, mutational analyses in multiple populations identified loss of function mutants of SHP gene involved in mild obesity, increased birth weight and insulin levels. Furthermore, experimental mutagenesis has been exploited to characterize the interactions between SHP and the transcriptional inhibitor EID-1. With the aim of gaining insight into the structural basis of SHP repression mechanism, we modelled SHP and EID-1 structures. Docking experiments were carried out to identify the EID-1 binding surface on SHP structure. The results obtained in this study allow for the first time a unique interpretation of many experimental data available from the published literature. In addition, a fascinating hypothesis raises from the inspection of the proposed SHP structure: the presence of a potential unexpected ligand binding site, supported by recently available experimental data that may represent a breakthrough in the design and development of synthetic modulators of SHP functions.
In this minireview, the role of various nuclear receptors and transcription factors in the expression of drug disposition genes is summarized. Specifically, the molecular aspects and functional impact of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), nuclear factor-E2 p45-related factor 2 (N(r)f2), hepatocyte nuclear factor 1alpha (HNF1alpha), constitutive androstane receptor (LAR), pregnane X receptor (PXR), farnesoid X receptor (FXR), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPAR(alpha)), hepatocyte nuclear factor 4alpha (HNF4alpha), vitamin D receptor (VDR), liver receptor homolog 1 (LRH1), liver X receptor (LXR(alpha)), small heterodimer partner-1 (SHP-1), and glucocorticoid receptor (GR) on gene expression are detailed. Finally, we discuss some current topics and themes in nuclear receptor-mediated regulation of drug metabolizing enzymes and drug transporters.
We explored the effects of bile acids on triglyceride (TG) homeostasis using a combination of molecular, cellular, and animal models. Cholic acid (CA) prevents hepatic TG accumulation, VLDL secretion, and elevated serum TG in mouse models of hypertriglyceridemia. At the molecular level, CA decreases hepatic expression of SREBP-1c and its lipogenic target genes. Through the use of mouse mutants for the short heterodimer partner (SHP) and liver X receptor (LXR) alpha and beta, we demonstrate the critical dependence of the reduction of SREBP-1c expression by either natural or synthetic farnesoid X receptor (FXR) agonists on both SHP and LXR alpha and LXR beta. These results suggest that strategies aimed at increasing FXR activity and the repressive effects of SHP should be explored to correct hypertriglyceridemia.
Bile acid synthesis is regulated by nuclear receptors including farnesoid X receptor (FXR) and small heterodimer partner (SHP), and by fibroblast growth factor 15/19 (FGF15/19). We hypothesized that hepatic cysteine sulfinic acid decarboxylase (CSAD) (a key enzyme in taurine synthesis) is regulated by bile acids (BA). The aim of this study was to investigate CSAD regulation by BA dependent regulatory mechanisms.
Mice were fed a control diet or a diet supplemented with either 0.5% cholate or 2% cholestyramine. To study BA dependent pathways, we utilized GW4064 (FXR agonist), FGF19 or T-0901317 (liver X receptor [LXR] agonist) and Shp-/- mice. Tissue mRNA was determined by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Amino acids were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography.
Mice supplemented with dietary cholate exhibited reduced hepatic CSAD mRNA while those receiving cholestyramine exhibited increased mRNA. Activation of FXR suppressed CSAD mRNA expression whereas CSAD expression was increased in Shp-/- mice. Hepatic hypotaurine concentration (the product of CSAD) was higher in Shp-/- mice with a corresponding increase in serum taurine conjugated BA. FGF19 administration suppressed hepatic cholesterol 7-α-hydroxylase (CYP7A1) mRNA but did not change CSAD mRNA expression. LXR activation induced CYP7A1 mRNA yet failed to induce CSAD mRNA expression.
BA regulate CSAD mRNA expression in a feedback fashion via mechanisms involving SHP and FXR but not FGF15/19 or LXR. These findings implicate BA as regulators of CSAD mRNA via mechanisms shared with CYP7A1.
Adverse outcome pathways (AOPs) are novel tools in toxicology and human risk assessment with broad potential. AOPs are designed to provide a clear-cut mechanistic representation of critical toxicological effects that span over different layers of biological organization. AOPs share a common structure consisting of a molecular initiating event, a series of intermediate steps and key events, and an adverse outcome. Development of AOPs ideally complies with OECD guidelines. This also holds true for AOP evaluation, which includes consideration of the Bradford Hill criteria for weight-of-evidence assessment and meeting a set of key questions defined by the OECD. Elaborate AOP frameworks have yet been proposed for chemical-induced skin sensitization, cholestasis, liver fibrosis and liver steatosis. These newly postulated AOPs can serve a number of ubiquitous purposes, including the establishment of (quantitative) structure-activity relationships, the development of novel in vitro toxicity screening tests and the elaboration of prioritization strategies. 
This review encompasses the most important advances in liver functions and hepatotoxicity and analyzes which mechanisms can be studied in vitro. In a complex architecture of nested, zonated lobules, the liver consists of approximately 80 % hepatocytes and 20 % non-parenchymal cells, the latter being involved in a secondary phase that may dramatically aggravate the initial damage. Hepatotoxicity, as well as hepatic metabolism, is controlled by a set of nuclear receptors (including PXR, CAR, HNF-4α, FXR, LXR, SHP, VDR and PPAR) and signaling pathways. When isolating liver cells, some pathways are activated, e.g., the RAS/MEK/ERK pathway, whereas others are silenced (e.g. HNF-4α), resulting in up- and downregulation of hundreds of genes. An understanding of these changes is crucial for a correct interpretation of in vitro data. The possibilities and limitations of the most useful liver in vitro systems are summarized, including three-dimensional culture techniques, co-cultures with non-parenchymal cells, hepatospheres, precision cut liver slices and the isolated perfused liver. Also discussed is how closely hepatoma, stem cell and iPS cell-derived hepatocyte-like-cells resemble real hepatocytes. Finally, a summary is given of the state of the art of liver in vitro and mathematical modeling systems that are currently used in the pharmaceutical industry with an emphasis on drug metabolism, prediction of clearance, drug interaction, transporter studies and hepatotoxicity. One key message is that despite our enthusiasm for in vitro systems, we must never lose sight of the in vivo situation. Although hepatocytes have been isolated for decades, the hunt for relevant alternative systems has only just begun.
Hypercholesterolemia is one of the important risk factors of atherosclerosis (AS). The aim of this study is to explore the effect of medium-chain fatty acids (MCFAs) on serum cholesterol levels and their mechanism of action. Hyperlipemia, as a model of abnormal lipid hypermetabolism, was established by using a high fat diet in C57BL/6J mice. Forty eight mice with dyslipidemia were randomly divided into 4 groups, 12 mice per group, including the control group, the 2% caprylic acid (C8:0)-treated group, 2% capric acid (C10:0)-treated group, and 2% oleic acid (C18:1)-treated group. All mice were fed with a high fat diet. After 16 weeks, the mice were anesthetized with chloral hydrate. The mouse portal vein blood, the liver and the start site of the ileum (1 cm) were collected. The body weight of the mice and blood lipid profiles were measured. Gene transcription and the expression level associated with bile acid metabolism in the liver and small intestine were determined by real-time PCR and the western blotting method. The concentrations of bile acid metabolites in bile and feces were analysed. After 16 weeks of treatment, the concentrations of TC and LDL-C in the caprylic acid group were significantly lower than those in the control group (P &lt; 0.05); the transcription and expression level of LXR, CYP7A1, CYP27A1 and ABCG8 in the caprylic acid and capric acid groups were significantly higher than those in the control group in the liver (P &lt; 0.05), however the transcription and expression level of the small heterodimer partner (SHP) were significantly lower than those in the control group (P &lt; 0.05); the transcription and expression level of LXR, ABCG5 and ABCG8 in the caprylic acid, capric acid and oleic acid groups were significantly higher than those in the control group in the small intestine (P &lt; 0.05). The concentrations of total bile acid, mainly cholic acid and cholesterol in bile and feces were significantly higher in the caprylic and capric acid groups than those of in the control group (P &lt; 0.05). Thus, MCFA increased the expression of LXR and ABCG8, enhanced CYP7A1 and CYP27A1 expression, decreased and SHP expression in the liver, thereby promoted liver bile acid synthesis and excretion. In addition MCFA increased the expression of ABCG5, ABCG8 and LXR in the small intestine, thereby inhibiting small intestinal bile acid absorption, increasing the concentrations of cholesterol and bile acid in bile and feces and reducing the level of serum cholesterol.
Obesity emerged as the major risk factor for metabolic syndrome. Postmenopausal women are more prone to develop obesity than premenopausal women. The absence of safe and effective conventional treatments for postmenopausal obesity has changed the focus to natural products as alternative remedy. We investigated the molecular basis of the effect of soy isoflavones (SIFs) on hypertriglyceridemia and hepatic steatosis in an animal model of postmenopausal obesity. Ovariectomized (OVX) and sham-operated Wistar rats were fed with high-fat diet (HFD) and normal diet for 8 weeks with and without SIF extract (150mg/kg body weight/day). Both OVX and HFD per se and when combined caused hypertriglyceridemia, hypercholesterolemia and atherogenic lipid profile. Proteomic studies revealed that both OVX and HFD caused overexpression of hepatic lipogenic proteins, such as LXR, SREBP1, PPARγ, ACC and FAS, in association with reduced expression of lipolytic proteins, such as FXR, PPARα, insig2 and SHP. Histological analysis showed fat accumulation and morphological abnormalities in the liver of OVX and HFD rats. All these metabolic derangements were further augmented when OVX was followed by HFD. In conclusion, these findings suggest that there was a synergism in the development of deranged lipid metabolism with the coexistence of postmenopausal state and the intake of fat-rich diet. SIF extract markedly alleviated the derangement of lipid metabolism suggesting the use of this natural phytoestrogen as a strategy for relieving dyslipidemia and hepatic steatosis associated with the postmenopausal women.
The expression of additional genes, other than oestrogen receptor (ER), may be important to the hormone-responsive phenotype of breast cancer. Microarray analyses have revealed that forkhead box A1 (FOXA1) and GATA binding protein 3 (GATA-3) are expressed in close association with ERalpha, both encoding for transcription factors with a potential involvement in the ERalpha-mediated action in breast cancer. The purpose of this study was to explore if the expression of FOXA1 and GATA-3 may provide an opportunity to stratify subsets of patients that could have better outcome, among the ERalpha-negative/poor prognosis breast cancer group.
We evaluate FOXA1 and GATA-3 expression in 249 breast carcinomas by immunohistochemistry, associating it with breast cancer molecular markers, clinicopathological features and patient's survival. The clinicopathological features and immunohistochemical markers of the tumours were compared using the chi-square test and ANOVA. Disease-free survival was analysed through Kaplan-Meier survival curves and Cox regression.
FOXA1 expression was demonstrated in 42% of invasive carcinomas, while GATA-3 was detected in 48% of the cases. FOXA1 expression was inversely associated with tumour size, Nottingham Prognostic Index, histological grade, lymph vascular invasion, lymph node stage and human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER-2) overexpression, while GATA-3 expression showed inverse association with histological grade and HER-2. Both FOXA1 and GATA-3 were directly associated with ERalpha and progesterone receptor. Among FOXA1-positive tumours, 83.1% are comprised in the luminal A subtype, similar to GATA-3 where 87.7% of positive tumours were classified within this molecular subtype. In the subset of ERalpha-negative patients, those who were FOXA1-negative had a 3.61-fold increased risk of breast cancer recurrence when compared with the FOXA1-positive.
FOXA1 was a significant predictor of good outcome in breast cancer, whereas GATA-3 was an important luminal marker. The expression of FOXA1 may be used for risk stratification among ERalpha-negative patients.
Over-expression of PU.1, a myeloid- and lymphoid-specific transcription factor belonging to the Ets family, induces monocyte-specific gene expression in mast cells. However, the effects of PU.1 on each target gene and the involvement of cytokine signaling in PU.1-mediated gene expression are largely unknown. In the present study, PU.1 was over-expressed in two different types of bone marrow-derived cultured mast cells (BMMCs): BMMCs cultured with IL-3 plus stem cell factor (SCF) and BMMCs cultured with pokeweed mitogen-stimulated spleen-conditioned medium (PWM-SCM). PU.1 over-expression induced expression of MHC class II, CD11b, CD11c and F4/80 on PWM-SCM-cultured BMMCs, whereas IL-3/SCF-cultured BMMCs expressed CD11b and F4/80, but not MHC class II or CD11c. When IFN-gamma was added to the IL-3/SCF-based medium, PU.1 transfectant acquired MHC class II expression, which was abolished by antibody neutralization or in Ifngr(-/-) BMMCs, through the induction of expression of the MHC class II transactivator, CIITA. Real-time PCR detected CIITA mRNA driven by the fourth promoter, pIV, and chromatin immunoprecipitation indicated direct binding of PU.1 to pIV in PU.1-over-expressing BMMCs. PU.1-over-expressing cells showed a marked increase in IL-6 production in response to LPS stimulation in both IL-3/SCF and PWM-SCM cultures. These results suggest that PU.1 overproduction alone is sufficient for both expression of CD11b and F4/80 and for amplification of LPS-induced IL-6 production. However, IFN-gamma stimulation is essential for PU.1-mediated transactivation of CIITA pIV. Reduced expression of mast cell-related molecules and transcription factors GATA-1/2 and up-regulation of C/EBPalpha in PU.1 transfectants indicate that enforced PU.1 suppresses mast cell-specific gene expression through these transcription factors.
The progesterone receptor (PR) plays a pivotal role in proper development and function of the mammary gland and has also been implicated in mammary tumorigenesis. PR is a ligand-activated transcription factor; however, relatively, little is known about its mechanisms of action at endogenous target promoters. The aim of our study was to identify a natural PR-responsive gene and investigate its transcriptional regulation in the mammary microenvironment. Our experiments revealed FKBP5 as a direct target of the PR, because it exhibited a rapid activation by progestin that was cycloheximide independent and correlated with recruitment of RNA polymerase II to the promoter. Site-directed mutagenesis and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays showed that progestin responsiveness is mediated through a composite element in the first intron, to which the PR binds concomitantly with GATA-2. Mutational analysis of the element revealed that the GATA-2 site is essential for progestin activation. Direct binding of PR to DNA contributes to the efficiency of activation but is not sufficient, suggesting that the receptor makes important protein-protein interactions as part of its mechanism of action at the FKBP5 promoter. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation assays we also determined that the intronic region is in communication with the promoter, probably via DNA looping. Time course analysis revealed a cyclical pattern of PR recruitment to the FKBP5 gene but a persistent recruitment to the mouse mammary tumor virus promoter, indicating that receptor cycling is a gene-specific phenomenon rather than a characteristic of the receptor itself. Our study offers new insight in the nature of PR-regulated transcription in mammary cancer cells.
GATA transcription factors are crucial regulators of cell-specific gene expression in many tissues including the gonads. Although clinical cases of reproductive dysfunction have yet to be formally linked to GATA gene mutations, they have begun to be reported in other systems. Heterozygous GATA4 mutations have been associated with cases of congenital heart defects. Little is known, however, about the effect of these mutations on gonadal gene transcription. Since individuals carrying these mutations do not appear to suffer from gross reproductive defects, we hypothesized that this might be due to the differential transcriptional properties of the mutant proteins on heart versus gonadal target genes. Five mutations (S52F, E215D, G295S, V266M, and E359X) were recreated in the rat GATA4 protein. Several parameters were used to analyze the transcriptional properties of the mutants: activation of known gonadal target promoters (Star, Cyp19a1, and Inha), DNA binding, and interaction with GATA4 transcriptional partners. Three mutations (S52F, G295S, and E359X) reduced GATA4 transcriptional activity on the different gonadal promoters. With the exception of the G295S mutant, which showed a significant loss of DNA-binding affinity, the decrease in activity of the other GATA4 mutants was not associated with a change in DNA binding. All GATA4 mutants retained their ability to interact and cooperate with their major gonadal partners (NR5A1 and NR5A2) thereby compensating in part for the loss in intrinsic GATA4 transcriptional activity. Thus, unlike the heart, where the GATA4 mutations have deleterious effects, our data suggest that they would have a lesser impact on gonadal gene transcription and function.
Sakuranetin (5,4'-dihydroxy-7-methoxyflavone) belongs to the flavanone class of polyphenols predominantly known as phytoalexin in rice plant. In this study, we demonstrate that sakuranetin strongly induces differentiation of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes, as evidenced by increased triglyceride accumulation and glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GPDH) activity. In addition, even in the absence of adipogenic hormonal stimuli, sakuranetin strongly induced adipogenesis and expression of genes that are critical for the adipocytes phenotype. Time-course analyses indicated that sakuranetin induces PPARgamma2 expression without prior induction of C/EBPbeta, a transcriptional regulator of PPARgamma2 in adipogenesis. In 3T3-L1 preadipocytes, the transcriptional factors GATA-2 and GATA-3 are known to down-regulate adipogenesis by direct binding to the C/EBPbeta protein and to the GATA-binding site on the PPARgamma2 promoter. We found that sakuranetin significantly reduced the expression of GATA-2. Moreover, we observed that sakuranetin stimulated glucose uptake in differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes. These results suggest that sakuranetin may contribute to maintain glucose homeostasis in animals.
Identification of regulatory elements in 5' regions of chemokine genes is fundamental for understanding chemokine gene expression in response to infection diseases. The CXCR1 receptor is expressed on the surface of neutrophils and interacts primarily with CXCL8 (IL-8), the most potent chemoattractant for neutrophils. The aim of this study was to characterize the 5' upstream region (2.1 kb) of the bovine CXCR1 chemokine receptor gene for polymorphism content and to identify in silico potential transcription-factor binding sites. The 5' flanking region was found by mining the NCBI GenBank (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/). A DNA sequence from the whole genome shotgun sequence project with reference number AC150887.4 contained the CXCR1 5' flanking sequence. Computer analysis revealed potential binding sites for the transcription factors nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB), binding factor GATA-1, barbiturate inducible element (Barbie), nuclear factor of activated T-cells, and activator protein 1. Polymorphism discovery in this region was conducted by constructing an inclusive DNA pool including 2 phenotypic extreme groups, 20 bulls with high estimated breeding values (EBV) for somatic cell score (SCS), and 20 bulls with low EBV for SCS. Independent amplicons along the 5' flanking region of bovine CXCR1 were generated for polymorphism discovery by sequencing. Three novel single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP), CXCR1c.-344T&gt;C, CXCR1c.-1768T&gt;A, and CXCR1c.-1830A&gt;G, and a previously identified SNP in the coding region, CXCR1c.777G&gt;C, were identified. The 4 SNP were genotyped in Canadian Holstein bulls (n = 338) using tetra-primer amplification refractory mutation system (ARMS)-PCR. Average allele substitution effects were estimated to investigate associations between the 4 SNP and EBV for SCS in first, second, and third and later lactations. Multiple trait analysis revealed that the SNP CXCR1c.-1768T&gt;A was associated with EBV for SCS in the first and second lactations and over all 3 lactations. Haplotype analysis substantiated this association with EBV for SCS in the first lactation. Given the location of SNP CXCR1c.-1768T&gt;A and the surrounding potential binding recognition sequences for NF-kappaB, GATA-1, and Barbie transcription-factors, this SNP may be implicated in gene regulation and warrants further research.
GATA-binding protein 3 (GATA3) is a transcription factor and a putative tumor suppressor that is highly expressed in normal breast luminal epithelium and estrogen receptor alpha (ER)-positive breast tumors. We hypothesized that common genetic variation in GATA3 could influence breast carcinogenesis. Four tag single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in GATA3 and its 3' flanking gene FLJ4598 were genotyped in two case control studies in Norway and Poland (2,726 cases and 3,420 controls). Analyses of pooled data suggested a reduced risk of breast cancer associated with two intronic variants in GATA3 in linkage disequilibrium (rs3802604 in intron 3 and rs570613 in intron 4). Odds ratio (95% confidence interval) for rs570613 heterozygous and rare homozygous versus common homozygous were 0.85 (0.75-1.95) and 0.82 (0.62-0.96), respectively (P(trend)=0.004). Stronger associations were observed for subjects with ER-negative, than ER-positive, tumors (P(heterogeneity)=0.01 for rs3802604; P(heterogeneity)=0.09 for rs570613). Although no individual SNPs were associated with ER-positive tumors, two haplotypes (GGTC in 2% of controls and AATT in 7% of controls) showed significant and consistent associations with increased risk for these tumors when compared with the common haplotype (GATT in 46% of controls): 1.71 (1.27-2.32) and 1.26 (1.03-1.54), respectively. In summary, data from two independent study populations showed two intronic variants in GATA3 associated with overall decreases in breast cancer risk and suggested heterogeneity of these associations by ER status. These differential associations are consistent with markedly different levels of GATA3 protein by ER status. Additional epidemiologic studies are needed to clarify these intriguing relationships.
EPO (erythropoietin) has recently been shown to have protective actions upon the myocardium; however, the direct effects of EPO upon cardiac contractile and secretory functions are unknown and the signalling mechanisms are not well defined. In the present study, we provide the first evidence of direct cardiac contractile actions of EPO. In isolated perfused Sprague-Dawley rat hearts, a 30 min infusion of EPO significantly increased contractility in a dose-dependent fashion (maximal change 18+/-2% with 1 unit/ml EPO; P&lt;0.005 compared with vehicle). Perfusate ET-1 (endothelin-1) increased transiently during EPO infusion, and the ET(A/)ET(B) antagonist bosentan abolished the inotropic response to EPO. BNP (B-type natriuretic peptide) secretion (28+/-8%; P&lt;0.05) and nuclear transcription factor GATA-4 DNA-binding activity (51%; P&lt;0.05) were both significantly increased by EPO and blocked by bosentan. In a model of global ischaemic injury, delivery of 1 unit/ml EPO during reperfusion significantly attenuated creatine kinase release (28+/-12%; P&lt;0.05) and significantly improved contractile recovery (P&lt;0.001), independent of ET(A) blockade. Apoptotic indices [assessed by TUNEL (terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labelling)/cleaved caspase-3-positive cells] were significantly decreased (P&lt;0.01) by 1 unit/ml EPO during reperfusion alone, coincident with significantly increased phosphorylation of myocardial JAK2 (Janus kinase 2) and STAT3 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 3). Thus EPO directly enhances cardiac contractility and BNP secretion and alleviates ischemia/reperfusion injury via ET-1-dependent and -independent mechanisms respectively.
To better understand the structure and the function of ovine glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) promoter region, a genome-walking procedure was followed to isolate and sequence a 1628 bp fragment, containing the 5' regulatory region of the G6PD gene. In silico analysis of the sequence showed many conserved blocks and features with other known mammalian G6PD promoter regions. The analysis also revealed the presence of one TATA box, three GC boxes, two E-boxes and several binding sites for Stimulating Protein 1 (Sp1) and Activator Protein 2 (AP2). Moreover, elements involved in the regulation of lipogenesis like USF (Upstream stimulating factor), HSF (Heat Shock Factor), F2F (Prolactin receptor), RAR (Retinoid Acid Receptor), STRE (STress Response Element), RORa (Retinoid related Orphan Receptor alpha), GATA (GATA binding factor), RFX (Regulatory Factor X), SREBP (Sterol Regulatory Element Binding Protein), MEP (Metal Element Protein), CREB (insulin receptor), PRE (Progesterone receptor), and HNF4 (Hepatic Nuclear Factor 4) were detected. The most important regulatory motifs were found to be conserved as compared to those in human and mouse counterparts. However, some differences were noted, likely indicating differences in the transcription regulation of G6PD gene between ruminant and non-ruminant species.
Both transcriptional and post-transcriptional CYP2E1 regulatory mechanisms are known, resulting in 20-fold or greater variation in CYP2E1 expression. To evaluate functional regulatory elements controlling transcription, CYP2E1 promoter constructs were used to make adenovirus vectors containing CYP2E1 promoter-driven luciferase reporters for analyses in both primary human hepatocytes and HepG2 cells. A 1.2-kilobase pair portion of the CYP2E1 promoter was associated with 5- to 10-fold greater luciferase activity. This upstream region contained five direct repeats of 59 base pairs (bp) that increased thymidine kinase-driven luciferase reporter activity in HepG2 cells more than 5-fold, regardless of orientation. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) identified sequence-specific nuclear protein binding to the 59-bp repeats that was dependent on a 17-bp sequence containing a canonical GATA binding site (WGATAR). Competitive and supershift EMSA identified the participation of GATA4, another GATA family member or GATA-like factor, and a third factor unrelated to the GATA family. Involvement of the tricho-rhino-phalangeal syndrome-1 factor, which also binds a GATA sequence, was eliminated. Rather, competitive EMSA using known binding sequences for the orphan nuclear receptors, steroidogenic factor-1 (or NR5A1), and fetoprotein transcription factor (or NR5A2) implicated an NR5A member in binding a sequence overlapping the canonical GATA. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay demonstrated in vivo binding of NR5A2 to the enhancer sequence in human hepatocytes. The enhancer sequence is conserved within the human population but seems species-specific. The identification of this novel enhancer and its putative mechanism adds to the complexities of human CYP2E1 regulation.
The first and key enzyme controlling the synthesis of steroid hormones is cholesterol side chain cleavage cytochrome P450 (P450scc, CYP11A1). This study sought to elucidate overlooked modes of regulation of P450scc transcription in the rodent placenta and ovary. Transcription of P450scc requires two clusters of cis-regulatory elements: a proximal element (-40) known to bind either activating protein 2 (AP-2) in the placenta, or steroidogenic factor 1 in the ovary, and a distal region of the promoter (-475/-447) necessary for potentiation of the AP-2/steroidogenic factor 1-dependent activity up to 7-fold. In primary cultures of mouse trophoblast giant cells and rat ovarian granulosa cells, binding of trans-factors to the distal regulatory sequences generated transcriptional activity in a tissue-specific pattern: in the placenta, cAMP response element (CRE)-binding protein 1 (CREB-1) and GATA-2 binding generates promoter activity in a cAMP-independent manner, whereas in ovarian cells, CREB-1 and GATA-4 are required for FSH responsiveness. However, as ovarian follicles advance toward ovulation, elevated Fra-2 expression replaces CREB-1 function by binding the same CRE(1/2) motif. Our findings suggest that upon onset of follicular recruitment, CREB-1 mediates FSH/cAMP signaling, which switches to cAMP-independent expression of P450scc in luteinizing granulosa cells expressing Fra-2. In the placenta, the indispensable role of CREB-1 was demonstrated by use of dominant-negative CREB-1 mutant, but neither cAMP nor Ser133 phosphorylation of CREB-1 is required for P450scc transcription. These observations suggest that placental regulation of P450scc expression is subjected to alternative signaling pathway(s) yet to be found.
Our objective was to delineate the potential role of adipogenesis in insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. Obesity is characterized by an increase in adipose tissue mass resulting from enlargement of existing fat cells (hypertrophy) and/or from increased number of adipocytes (hyperplasia). The inability of the adipose tissue to recruit new fat cells may cause ectopic fat deposition and insulin resistance.
We examined the expression of candidate genes involved in adipocyte proliferation and/or differentiation [CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP) alpha, C/EBPdelta, GATA domain-binding protein 3 (GATA3), C/EBPbeta, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) gamma2, signal transducer and activator of transcription 5A (STAT5A), Wnt-10b, tumor necrosis factor alpha, sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1c (SREBP1c), 11 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, PPARG angiopoietin-related protein (PGAR), insulin-like growth factor 1, PPARgamma coactivator 1alpha, PPARgamma coactivator 1beta, and PPARdelta] in subcutaneous adipose tissue from 42 obese individuals with type 2 diabetes and 25 non-diabetic subjects matched for age and obesity.
Insulin sensitivity was measured by a 3-hour 80 mU/m2 per minute hyperinsulinemic glucose clamp (100 mg/dL). As expected, subjects with type 2 diabetes had lower glucose disposal (4.9 +/- 1.9 vs. 7.5 +/- 2.8 mg/min per kilogram fat-free mass; p &lt; 0.001) and larger fat cells (0.90 +/- 0.26 vs. 0.78 +/- 0.17 microm; p = 0.04) as compared with obese control subjects. Three genes (SREBP1c, p &lt; 0.01; STAT5A, p = 0.02; and PPARgamma2, p = 0.02) had significantly lower expression in obese type 2 diabetics, whereas C/EBPbeta only tended to be lower (p = 0.07).
This cross-sectional study supports the hypothesis that impaired expression of adipogenic genes may result in impaired adipogenesis, potentially leading to larger fat cells in subcutaneous adipose tissue and insulin resistance.
Nishiki-nezumi Cinnamon/Nagoya (NC/Nga) mice raised in nonair-controlled conventional circumstances spontaneously develop atopic dermatitis-like skin lesions; however, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear.
We wanted to identify the critical intracellular signaling molecules in T cells that induce atopic dermatitis-like skin legions in NC/Nga mice.
We examined the levels of signal transduction and cytokine production in T cells, particularly those in atopic dermatitis-like lesions induced by the topical injection of mite antigens in NC/Nga mice under specific pathogen-free conditions.
In NC/Nga mice maintained under specific pathogen-free conditions, the capability of T(H)1/T(H)2 and T cytotoxic 1/T cytotoxic 2 (Tc1/Tc2) cell differentiation increased significantly. T-cell antigen receptor-mediated activation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase/mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade and nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) signaling were enhanced in NC/Nga T cells. The expression of T(H)2 cytokines (IL-4, IL-13, and IL-5) and that of GATA-binding protein 3 (GATA3), avian musculoaponeurotic fibrosarcoma (c-Maf), NF-kappaB, and activator protein 1 (AP1) selectively increased in draining lymph node T cells of NC/Nga mice. Moreover, the cell transfer of inhibitory NF-kappaB mutant-infected T(H)2 cells reduced ear thickness in the mite antigen-induced skin lesion of NC/Nga mice.
Hyperresponsive T(H)2 cells with an enhanced activity of NF-kappaB and AP1 play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of atopic dermatitis-like skin lesions in NC/Nga mice.
These results indicate potential therapeutic usefulness of developing selective inhibitors for NF-kappaB in the treatment of human atopic dermatitis.
Identification of the mechanisms leading to malignant transformation of respiratory cells may prove useful in the prevention and treatment of tobacco-related lung cancer. Nitrosamines 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (NNK) and N'-nitrosonornicotine (NNN) can induce tumors both locally and systemically. In addition to the genotoxic effect, they have been shown to affect lung cells due to ligating the nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) expressed on the plasma membrane. In this study, we sought to establish the role for nAChRs in malignant transformation caused by NNK and NNN. We used the BEP2D cells that represent a suitable model for studying the various stages of human bronchial carcinogenesis. We found that these cells express alpha1, alpha3, alpha5, alpha7, alpha9, alpha10, beta1, beta2, and beta4 nAChR subunits that can form high-affinity binding sites for NNK and NNN. Exposure of BEP2D cells to either NNK or NNN in both cases increased their proliferative potential which could be abolished in the presence of nAChR antagonists alpha-bungarotoxin, which worked most effectively against NNK, or mecamylamine, which was most efficient against NNN. The BEP2D cells stimulated with the nitrosamines showed multifold increases of the transcription of the PCNA and Bcl-2 genes by both real-time polymerase chain reaction and in-cell western assays. To gain a mechanistic insight into NNK- and NNN-initiated signaling, we investigated the expression of genes encoding the signal transduction effectors GATA-3, nuclear factor-kappaB, and STAT-1. Experimental results indicated that stimulation of nAChRs with NNK led to activation of all three signal transduction effectors under consideration, whereas NNN predominantly activated GATA-3 and STAT-1. The GATA-3 protein-binding activity induced by NNK and NNN correlated with elevated gene expression. The obtained results support the novel concept of receptor-mediated action of NNK and NNN placing cellular nAChRs in the center of the pathophysiologic loop, and suggest that an nAChR antagonist may serve as a chemopreventive agent.
New data regarding signal transduction triggered by opioid ligands in immune cells are reviewed, and the signal transduction in neuronal cells is documented. Similar signaling pathways are induced by opioids in immune as well as neuronal cells. Opioids altered second messenger cAMP, intracellular calcium, and second messenger-induced kinases in immune cells. Met-enkephalin, preferentially delta-opioid, was bimodally regulated, while kappa-opioids inhibited these second messengers. delta-, kappa- and micro-opioids altered nitric oxide secretion, inducing cGMP as the second messenger in immune cells. Coupling of opioid agonists to opioid receptors activated mitogen-activated protein/extracellular signal-regulated protein kinases and various transcription factors in immune cells. Activator protein 1 (AP-1), c-fos, and nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) are transcription factors shared by neuronal and immune cells. Delta-opioids activated AP-1, c-fos, activating transcription factor 2, Ikaros-1 and Ikaros-2 transcription factors in immune cells. Induction of kappa-opioid receptor gene by retinoic acid resulted in increased binding of Sp1 transcription factor to the promoter of the kappa-opioid receptor. Micro-opioids inhibited synthesis of common transcription factors AP-1, c-fos, NF-kappaB, and nuclear factor of activated T cells in activated or stimulated immune cells, whereas micro-opioids activated NF-kappaB, GATA-3, and Kruppel-like factor 7 transcription factors in non-stimulated immune cells.
Thyroid hormone, T(3), regulates cell metabolism, differentiation, and development. cDNA microarrays were performed to study the mechanism of target gene regulation after T(3) treatment in a thyroid hormone receptor-alpha (TRalpha)-overexpressing hepatoma cell line (HepG2-TRalpha). The differentially expressed target genes are several metabolic enzymes, including dehydroepiandrosterone-sulfotransferase family 1A member 2 (SULT2A1). Enzyme SULT2A1 was elevated roughly 5-fold at the protein level and 9-fold increase at the mRNA level after 48 h T(3) treatment in HepG2-TRalpha cells. Cycloheximide inhibited T(3)-induced SULT2A1 expression, suggesting that regulation was indirect. SULT2A1 has been reported to be regulated by the two transcription factors, steroidogenic factor 1 (SF1) and GATA, in the human adrenal gland. T(3) induced a 2.5- to 3.5-fold elevation of SF1 at the protein level and a 6.2-fold increase at the RNA level in HepG2-TRalpha cells. About seven SF1 binding sites exist on the SULT2A1 gene. To identify and localize the critical SF1 binding site, series of deletion mutants of SULT2A1 promoter fragments in pGL2 plasmid were constructed. The promoter activity of the SULT2A1 gene was enhanced about 2.8- to 7.1-fold by T(3). The -228 SF1 binding site was identified as the most critical site because deleting this region reduced T(3)-induced expression. Transcription factor SF1 application enhanced the -228 but not -117 reporter plasmid activities. SULT2A1 and SF1 up-regulation at protein and RNA levels in thyroidectomized rats occurred after T(3) application. In summary, this work demonstrated that the SULT2A1 gene was mediated by SF1 and indirectly regulated by T(3). Further study is required to elucidate the physiological importance of SULT2A1 induction mediated by T(3).
Previously, a modest association was observed between the progesterone receptor +331G/A gene variant and breast cancer risk. Here, in a larger sample of breast cancer cases and controls (n = 1,322/n = 1,953) nested in the Nurses' Health Study cohort, we confirm a significant association (odds ratio, 1.41; 95% confidence interval, 1.10-1.79) and suggest a molecular model. The association of the +331G/A variant with breast cancer was particularly strong among obese women (body mass index &gt; 30; odds ratio, 2.87; 95% confidence interval, 1.40-5.90). To help understand the molecular mechanism by which this variant may predispose women to breast cancer, we identified nearby transcription factor binding sites. This search predicted a binding site for the GATA family of transcriptional regulators adjacent to this hPR polymorphism. Importantly, we found GATA3, GATA4, and GATA6 are expressed in normal breast tissue and two breast cancer cell lines, whereas GATA5 is minimally expressed in normal mammary tissue and more strongly expressed in two breast cancer cell lines. This finding was relevant because GATA5 bound the site adjacent to the +331G/A polymorphism, and activated the hPR (-711 to +822)-luciferase reporter plasmid in breast cancer cells. Overexpression of GATA5 increased expression of the endogenous hPR transcript, and GATA5 more strongly activated an hPR promoter construct encoding the PR-B isoform. Finally, hPR promoter constructs including the +331A were more strongly activated by GATA5 than constructs including +331G. Our findings suggest that GATA5 interacts with the +331G/A polymorphism to stimulate hPR-B expression in mammary cells, which may contribute to breast cancer susceptibility.
The family of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters consists of several transmembrane proteins that use ATP hydrolysis as an energy source for the transport of a variety of substances through cellular membranes. Two members of this family, ABCG5 and ABCG8, are implicated in the intestinal absorption and biliar excretion of sterols. Cholesterol content in milk is highly variable among species, breeds, and individuals of the same species, but a potential application of these genes in lipid homeostasis in the mammary gland has never been addressed. In the present work, expression of ABCG5 and ABCG8 in the bovine was demonstrated for the first time and characterized by quantitative PCR. The entire coding region and promoter area were sequenced and screened for motifs involved in lipid homeostasis. Both ABCG5 and ABCG8 presented a high level of length and sequence identity with other mammalian species. In the intergenic promoter region, 2 GATA boxes, a liver receptor homolog-1 response element, and a nuclear factor-kappaB response element, important factors in other lipid regulatory processes, were identified. As expected, high expression levels of both ABCG5 and ABCG8 were present in liver and digestive tract samples, and interestingly, in the mammary gland, opening new avenues for further investigation about their potential role in lipid trafficking and excretion during lactation.
The functional development of pituitary cells depends on the expression of a combination of transcription factors and co-factors. Pituitary-specific transcription factor-1 (Pit-1) is required for the expression of growth hormone (GH), prolactin (PRL), and the thyroid-stimulating hormone beta subunit (TSH beta) and acts synergistically with the estrogen receptor (ER) and GATA-binding protein 2 (GATA-2) to induce PRL and TSH beta expression, respectively. The glycoprotein hormone alpha subunit (alpha SU) is the first hormone to be expressed during pituitary development. In addition to being expressed in follicle-stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone (LH), and TSH cells, alpha SU is reported to co-localize with GH in pituitary cells. These findings have led to the suggestion that the expression of Pit-1 in cells of the alpha SU-based gonadotropin cell lineage might also lead to the expression of GH. In this study, we transfected HP 75 cells (derived from a human non-functioning pituitary adenoma that expressed alpha SU and LH beta) with Pit-1 by using an adenovirus FLAG-Pit-1 construct. Most of the transfected cells expressed GH mRNA, with fewer cells expressing PRL and TSH beta mRNA. The HP 75 cells expressed the genes for ER and GATA-2, thus allowing their expression of GH, PRL, and TSH beta mRNA in response to Pit-1. These results support the hypothesis that GH can be induced in cells that possess an active alpha SU gene and shed light on the basic molecular mechanism that drives the development of GH, PRL, and TSH beta expression in the alpha SU-based gonadotroph lineage.
The complement anaphylatoxins, C3a and C5a, exert their effects by binding to their respective receptors. A number of studies have implicated these proteins in human disease, yet little is known about anaphylatoxin receptor gene regulation. In this report, we demonstrate that most of the regulatory functions in the murine C3aR gene lie within 50 bp of the transcription start site. This region is critical for macrophage expression but does not have activity in a non-expressing melanoma cell line. Within this small region are putative consensus binding sites for AP-1, NF-kappaB, Ets, and GATA transcription factors. Lack of a corresponding NF-kappaB site in the human sequence and lack of DNA binding activity in macrophage nuclear extracts suggests that the NF-kappaB site is nonfunctional. Luciferase data demonstrate that the GATA site functions as a negative regulatory element in RAW 264.7 macrophages. The AP-1 and Ets sites are critical for C3aR reporter gene expression, such that when each is mutated, a significant loss of activity is observed. Furthermore, we demonstrate that these sequences cooperate to mediate both basal and LPS-induced expression of C3aR. Interestingly, EMSA analyses demonstrate that the AP-1 site binds to c-Jun, and in vivo footprinting shows a typical footprint in this site, but the Ets site does not have a "typical" Ets footprint and does not bind to Ets-1/2 proteins in RAW 264.7 extracts. These data suggest that, although the control region for C3aR is small, interaction of several transcription factors can lead to complex patterns of gene regulation.
The aim of this study was to reveal the role of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma) in erythropoiesis.
The effects of PPARgamma ligands on cellular proliferation and differentiation were investigated in erythroid colony-forming cells (ECFCs) purified from human peripheral blood.
RT-PCR analysis revealed that PPARgamma mRNA is expressed in ECFCs. Synthetic PPARgamma ligands, troglitazone or pioglitazone, suppressed cellular proliferation without inducing apoptosis and delayed maturation of ECFCs, as determined by flow cytometry. The delay in erythroid maturation by troglitazone was confirmed by the down-regulation of gamma-globin, beta-globin and GATA-1 mRNA, and the maintenance of GATA-2 mRNA.
Our results suggest that PPARgamma modulates the differentiation process of erythroid progenitor cells, and plays a crucial role in regulating the balance of hematopoiesis.
The human HSD3B2 gene encodes the 3beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase/delta5-delta4 isomerase type 2 (3beta-HSD2) enzyme that is required for steroid hormone biosynthesis. Mutations in the hHSD3B2 gene are responsible for a form of congenital adrenal hyperplasia and male pseudohermaphroditism whereas overexpression of hHSD3B2 has been recently associated with polycystic ovarian syndrome. Despite the importance of the hHSD3B2 gene, the molecular mechanisms that regulate its expression remain poorly understood. Transcription factors belonging to the GATA family are emerging as novel regulators of steroidogenesis. Indeed, GATA-4 and GATA-6 are abundantly expressed in steroidogenic cells of the gonads and adrenals. We now report that the human HSD3B2 promoter (hHSD3B2), which contains four consensus GATA elements, constitutes an important target for GATA factors. GATA-4 and GATA-6 by themselves are sufficient to activate transcription (up to 15-fold) from a -1073 bp hHSD3B2 promoter fragment and blockade of endogenous GATA expression and/or activity blunts hHSD3B2 promoter activity in steroidogenic cells. Deletion studies showed that the proximal GATA element located at -196 bp is sufficient to confer GATA responsiveness of the hHSD3B2 promoter and is required for full hHSD3B2 promoter activity in steroidogenic cells. Moreover, we report that GATA-4 and GATA-6 can physically interact with the nuclear receptors, steroidogenic factor 1 and liver receptor homolog 1, to synergistically activate hHSD3B2 promoter activity in both homologous and heterologous cells. Aberrant expression of transcription factors essential for hHSD3B2 expression might also be involved in some pathologies/syndromes associated with deregulated hHSD3B2 expression.
Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARgamma) plays a role in adipocyte differentiation and insulin sensitization. We identified and characterized a new C/T substitution at position -689 (-689C&gt;T) in the P2 promoter of PPARgamma in a putative GATA binding site. By electrophoretic mobility shift assay, both GATA2 and GATA3 proteins could bind weakly to the wild-type P2 -689 GATA binding site but not to the mutated site. Neither GATA2 nor GATA3 was able to regulate significantly the P2 promoter activity in a reporter-luciferase assay, whatever the allele at position -689 was, suggesting that the -689 putative GATA site was probably not a functional target for GATAs. However, the presence of the -689T allele rendered the P2 promoter less active at the basal state. We genotyped a population of 1155 men and women for the -689C&gt;T polymorphism and looked for possible associations with anthropometric and lipid variables. The carriers of the -689T allele had elevated body weight and LDL-cholesterol concentrations compared with the homozygous for the common allele. Haplotype analyses including the -681C&gt;G (P3 promoter), -689C&gt;T (P2 promoter), and Pro12Ala (exon B) polymorphisms were performed. Carriers of the G-T-Ala haplotype (corresponding to the P3 -681C&gt;G, P2 -689C&gt;T and Pro12Ala polymorphisms in this order) had elevated LDL-cholesterol concentrations and body weight compared with C-C-Pro individuals. In conclusion, we identified a new polymorphism in the P2 promoter of PPARgamma. The P3 -681C&gt;G, P2 -689C&gt;T, and Pro12Ala polymorphisms and related haplotypes were associated with higher body weight and plasma LDL-cholesterol concentrations.
15-Deoxy-delta(12, 14)-prostaglandin J2 (15d-PG J2) is a regulator of a nuclear transcriptional factor, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-gamma. A previous study has demonstrated that 15d-PG J2 enhanced acute lung injury induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in mice. 15d-PG J2 induced mucin-producing cells in the bronchial epithelium, especially in the presence of LPS. The present study investigated the effects of 15d-PG J2 on the activation of GATA-3 and Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription (STAT) 6, important transcriptional factors in mucus secretion, in the lung in the presence or absence of LPS. ICR mice were divided into 4 experimental groups that intratracheally received vehicle, lipopolysaccharide (LPS: 125 microg/kg), 15d-PG J2 (1 mg/kg), or 15d-PG J2 + LPS. The nuclear localization of GATA-3 and phosphorylated STAT 6 was evaluated 2 h after the intratracheal administration. 15d-PG J2 enhanced the nuclear localization of GATA-3 in the presence of LPS, whereas the nuclear localization of phosphorylated STAT 6 was not altered in the groups. These results suggest that the enhancing effects of 15d-PG J2 on the production of mucin-producing cells might be related, at least in part, to the activation of GATA-3.
The role of androgens in the proliferation and maturation of Sertoli cells (SC) and the development of their capacity to support spermatogenesis remains poorly understood. We evaluated these functions in complete androgen receptor knockout (ARKO) and SC-selective androgen receptor knockout (SCARKO) mice. Compared with controls, ARKO mice exhibited a progressive reduction in SC number/testis, whereas SCARKOs showed minor changes, suggesting that androgen effects on SC number are not mediated via direct action on SCs. Immunoexpression of anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH), p27(kip1), GATA-1, and sulfated glycoprotein-2, which changes according to SC maturational status, occurred normally in ARKOs and SCARKOs. Functional capacity of SCs to support spermatogonia was similar in SCARKOs and controls, whereas ARKOs showed reduced capacity with age. SC capacity to support total germ cells revealed major deficits in ARKO and SCARKO adults, particularly with respect to postmeiotic germ cells. Using quantitative RT-PCR, the expression of SC markers was compared in d 50 testes. In ARKOs, expression of Pem, fatty acid binding protein, platelet-derived growth factor-A, and transferrin were all significantly reduced, whereas FSH receptor and AMH were increased. In SCARKOs, there were modest reductions in expression of cystatin-related gene highly expressed in testis and epididymis (cystatin-TE) and claudin-11, whereas expression of Pem, fatty acid binding protein, and platelet-derived growth factor-A was markedly reduced, highlighting these as potentially androgen-regulated SC genes that merit further study. In conclusion, androgen action is not required for maturation-dependent changes in immunoexpression of the SC markers AMH, p27(kip1), GATA-1, and sulfated glycoprotein-2 but is essential for expression of other SC genes, the attainment of normal SC number, and the support of meiotic and postmeiotic germ cell development.
ST2 is a member of the interleukin-1 receptor family and is expressed in type-2 T helper (Th2) cells. Here, we have studied the molecular mechanism responsible for the transcriptional regulation of the ST2 gene in Th2 cells using a mouse thymoma cell line, EL-4. The ST2 gene has distal and proximal promoters. ST2 mRNA was produced from the distal promoter in EL-4 cells stimulated with both phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) and dibutyryl cAMP (Bt2cAMP). The region of approximately 100 bp upstream of transcription start site, containing two GATA consensus sites, was indispensable for the activation of the distal promoter in reporter gene analysis. An electrophoretic mobility shift assay showed that transcription factor GATA-3 bound one of the GATA consensus sites (from -84 to -79) with nuclear extracts from PMA plus Bt2cAMP-stimulated EL-4 cells. The overexpression of GATA-3 enhanced the activity of the distal promoter. On the other hand, mutations of the GATA consensus site canceled out the enhancement by GATA-3. These data suggest that GATA-3 is an important transcription factor for the expression of the ST2 gene in Th2 cells.
The vitamin D receptor (VDR) and binding protein (DBP) mediate the cellular transport, activity, and anti-tumor action of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1,25-(OH)(2)D3]. The purpose of this investigation is to determine whether novel single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the transcriptional regulatory regions of the VDR and DBP are associated with prostate cancer risk.
Novel SNPs were identified in the VDR and DBP transcription regulatory gene regions and genotyped in a case-control study using male subjects with (n=258) or without (n=434) prostate cancer.
African-American men who possessed at least one variant VDR-5132 C allele had a increased risk of prostate cancer (OR=1.83; 95% CI: 1.02, 3.31). Further study revealed that the VDR-5132 T/C SNP eliminates a GATA-1 transcription factor-binding site.
The VDR-5132 T/C SNP, resulting in potential elimination of the GATA-1 transcription factor-binding site, may increase prostate cancer susceptibility in African-Americans. Confirmation of these findings is needed in larger observational studies.
We have previously demonstrated that GATA-2 and GATA-3 are expressed in adipocyte precursors and control the preadipocyte-to-adipocyte transition. Constitutive expression of both GATA-2 and GATA-3 suppressed adipocyte differentiation, partially through direct binding to the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma) promoter and suppression of its basal activity. In the present study, we demonstrate that both GATA-2 and GATA-3 form protein complexes with CCAAT/enhancer binding protein alpha (C/EBPalpha) and C/EBPbeta, members of a family of transcription factors that are integral to adipogenesis. We mapped this interaction to the basic leucine zipper domain of C/EBPalpha and a region adjacent to the carboxyl zinc finger of GATA-2. The interaction between GATA and C/EBP factors is critical for the ability of GATA to suppress adipocyte differentiation. Thus, these results show that in addition to its previously recognized function in suppressing PPARgamma transcriptional activity, interaction of GATA factors with C/EBP is necessary for their ability to negatively regulate adipogenesis.
Previous studies suggested the zinc-finger transcription factor GATA-6 inhibits vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) proliferation and promotes the contractile VSMC phenotype. The objective of this study was to identify bona fide target genes regulated by GATA-6 in VSMCs.
Microarray analyses were performed comparing mRNA from rat aortic smooth muscle cells (SMCs) infected with either adenovirus encoding a dominant-negative GATA-6/engrailed fusion protein or with control adenovirus. These studies identified 122 genes differentially expressed by at least 2-fold, including multiple genes involved in cell-cell signaling and cell-matrix interactions. Among these, endothelin-1 and the angiotensin type(1a) (AT(1a)) receptor are known to be induced in VSMCs in response to inflammatory stimuli and to be expressed in a GATA-dependent manner in cardiac myocytes in response to hemodynamic stress. Consistent with these findings, the endothelin-1 and AT(1a) receptor promoters were activated by forced expression of GATA-6 and repressed by forced expression of GATA-6/engrailed. Surprisingly, genes encoding SMC contractile proteins were not altered, and myocardin-induced SMC differentiation was not impaired in GATA-6(-/-) embryonic stem cells.
These data demonstrate that in VSMCs, GATA-6 regulates a set of genes associated with synthetic SMC functions and suggest that this transcriptional pathway may be independent from myocardin-induced SMC differentiation. An unbiased microarray screen of genes regulated by GATA-6 in VSMCs identified multiple genes involved in cell-cell signaling and cell-matrix interactions. The endothelin-1 and the AT1a receptor genes were shown to be direct GATA-6 target genes. These data suggest that GATA-6 plays a role in promoting synthetic functions in VSMCs.
With the objective to correlate clonogenicity, gene expression and phenotype during differentiation, human bone marrow CD34(+) cells were cultured in vitro to stimulate erythroid or neutrophil development, and sorted into five subpopulations according to their surface expression of CD15/CD33 and blood group antigen A/CD117 respectively. Sorted cells were cultured in methylcellulose and analysed by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction for expression of neutrophil and erythroid marker genes. Surface expression of CD15 coincided with restriction to neutrophil/monocyte differentiation and A antigen with restriction to erythroid differentiation. GATA-2 mRNA was down-regulated during both neutrophil and erythroid maturation, whereas GATA-1, SCL, ABO, erythropoietin receptor, Kell, glycophorin A, beta-globin and alpha-haemoglobin stabilizing protein were up-regulated during erythroid differentiation and silenced during neutrophil differentiation. CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP)-alpha, PU.1, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor receptor, PR3, C/EBP-epsilon and lactoferrin were sequentially expressed during neutrophil differentiation but rapidly down-regulated during the early erythroid stages. Nuclear factor erythroid-derived 2 (NF-E2) and glycophorin C were expressed both during neutrophil and erythroid differentiation. Our data support the notion of early expression of several lineage-associated genes prior to actual lineage commitment, defined by surface expression of CD15 and A antigen as markers for definitive neutrophil/monocyte and erythroid differentiation respectively. Previous findings, primarily from cell lines and mouse models, have been extended to adult human haematopoiesis.
The glycoprotein hormone erythropoietin (EPO) is an essential viability and growth factor for the erythrocytic progenitors. EPO is mainly produced in the kidneys. EPO gene expression is induced by hypoxia-inducible transcription factors (HIF). The principal representative of the HIF-family (HIF-1, -2 and -3) is HIF-1, which is composed of an O2-labile alpha-subunit and a constant nuclear beta-subunit. In normoxia, the alpha-subunit of HIF is inactivated following prolyl- and asparaginyl-hydroxylation by means of alpha-oxoglutarate and Fe(2+)-dependent HIF specific dioxygenases. While HIF-1 and HIF-2 activate the EPO gene, HIF-3, GATA-2 and NFkappaB are likely inhibitors of EPO gene transcription. EPO signalling involves tyrosine phosphorylation of the homodimeric EPO receptor and subsequent activation of intracellular antiapoptotic proteins, kinases and transcription factors. Lack of EPO leads to anemia. Treatment with recombinant human EPO (rHuEPO) is efficient and safe in improving the management of the anemia associated with chronic renal failure. RHuEPO analogues with prolonged survival in circulation have been developed. Whether the recent demonstration of EPO receptors in various non-hemopoietic tissues, including tumor cells, is welcome or ominous still needs to be clarified. Evidence suggests that rHuEPO may be a useful neuroprotective agent.
The active metabolite of vitamin D (1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) (1,25(OH)(2)D(3))) is known to modulate the immune response in Th1 cell-directed diseases. To investigate the role of vitamin D in Th2 cell-directed diseases, experimental allergic asthma was induced in vitamin D receptor (VDR) knockout and in wild-type (WT) mice. As expected, WT mice developed symptoms of airway inflammation with an influx of eosinophils, elevated Th2 cytokine levels, mucous production, and airway hyperresponsiveness. The administration of 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) had no effect on asthma severity. The only discernable effect of 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) on experimental allergic asthma in WT mice was an increased expression of two Th2-related genes (soluble CD23 and GATA-3) in lungs of BALB/c mice exposed to Ag through the nasal route only. By contrast, asthma-induced VDR knockout mice failed to develop airway inflammation, eosinophilia, or airway hyperresponsiveness, despite high IgE concentrations and elevated Th2 cytokines. The data suggest that although 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) induced these Th2-type genes, the treatment failed to have any affect on experimental asthma severity. However, VDR-deficient mice failed to develop experimental allergic asthma, suggesting an important role for the vitamin D endocrine system in the generation of Th2-driven inflammation in the lung.
Accumulating data support the idea that apoptosis in cardiac myocytes, in part, contributes to the development of heart failure. Since a number of neurohormonal factors are activated in this state, these factors may be involved in the positive and negative regulation of apoptosis in cardiac myocytes. Norepinephrine is one such factor and induces apoptosis in cardiac myocytes via a beta-adrenergic receptor pathway. beta-adrenergic agonist-induced apoptosis in cardiac myocytes is dependent on the activation of the cAMP/protein kinase A pathway. Interestingly, the activation of this pathway protects PC12 cells from apoptosis, suggesting that cAMP/protein kinase A regulates apoptosis in a cell type-specific manner. Another neurohormonal factor activated in heart failure is endothelin-1, which acts as a potent survival factor against myocardial cell apoptosis. Intracellular signaling pathways for endothelin-1-mediated protection include activation of MEK-1 /ERK1/2 and PI3 kinase. In addition to these protective pathways common among cell types, endothelin- activates the calcium-activated phosphatase calcineurin, which is necessary for the nuclear import of NFAT transcription factors. These factors interact with the cardiac-restricted zinc finger protein GATA-4 and induce transcription and expression of anti-apoptotic molecule bcl-2. Thus, myocardial cell apoptosis is regulated by pathways unique to cardiac myocytes as well as by those common among cell types. It should be further determined whether agents that specifically block myocardial cell apoptosis will attenuate the progression of heart failure.
Cytochrome P450c17 catalyzes steroidogenic 17alpha-hydroxylase and 17,20 lyase activities. Expression of the gene for P450c17 is cAMP dependent, tissue specific, developmentally programmed, and varies among species. Binding of Sp1, Sp3, and NF1-C (nuclear factor 1-C) to the first 227 bp of 5'flanking DNA (-227/LUC) is crucial for basal transcription in human NCI-H295A adrenal cells. Human placental JEG-3 cells contain Sp1, Sp3, and NF1, but do not express -227/LUC, even when transfected with a vector expressing steroidogenic factor 1 (SF-1). Therefore, other factors are essential for basal expression of P450c17. Deoxyribonuclease I footprinting and EMSAs identified a GATA consensus site at -64/-58 and an SF-1 site at -58/-50. RT-PCR identified GATA-4, GATA-6, and SF-1 in NCI-H295A cells and GATA-2 and GATA-3, but not GATA-4, GATA-6, or SF-1 in JEG-3 cells. Cotransfection of either GATA-4 or GATA-6 without SF-1 activated -227/LUC in JEG-3 cells, but cotransfection of GATA-2 or GATA-3 with or without SF-1 did not. Surprisingly, mutation of the GATA binding site in -227/LUC increased GATA-4 or GATA-6 induced activity, whereas mutation of the Sp1/Sp3 site decreased it. Furthermore, promoter constructs including the GATA site, but excluding the Sp1/Sp3 site at -196/-188, were not activated by GATA-4 or GATA-6, suggesting an interaction between Sp1/Sp3 and GATA-4 or GATA-6. Glutathione-S-transferase pull-down experiments and coimmunoprecipitation demonstrated interaction between GATA-4 or GATA-6 and Sp1, but not Sp3. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays confirmed that this GATA-4/6 interaction with Sp1 occurred at the Sp site in the P450c17 promoter in NCI-H295A cells. Demethylation with 5-aza-2-deoxycytidine permitted JEG-3 cells to express endogenous P450c17, SF-1, GATA-4, GATA-6, and transfected -227/LUC. Thus, GATA-4 or GATA-6 and Sp1 together regulate expression of P450c17 in adrenal NCI-H295A cells and methylation of P450c17, GATA-4 and GATA-6 silence the expression of P450c17 in placental JEG-3 cells.
Expansion of adipose tissue mass results from increased number and size of adipocyte cells. We hypothesized that subcutaneous abdominal preadipocytes in obese individuals might have an intrinsically higher propensity to differentiate into adipocytes. Thus we investigated the relationship between obesity and the level of in vitro preadipocyte differentiation in Pima Indians. Subcutaneous abdominal stromal vascular fractions containing preadipocytes were cultured from 58 nondiabetic subjects [31 M/27 F, 30 +/- 6 yr, body fat 34 +/- 8% by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (means +/- SD)]. The average percentage of preadipocyte differentiation (PDIFF; cell count by microscopy) was 11 +/- 11% (range 0.2-51%). PDIFF correlated negatively with percent body fat (r = -0.35, P = 0.006) and waist circumference (r = -0.45, P = 0.0004). Multiple regression analysis indicated that waist circumference (P = 0.01), sex (P = 0.01), and percent body fat (P = 0.05) were significant determinants of PDIFF. Molecular characterization of predifferentiated cultured cells was performed by real-time PCR measurements of glucocorticoid receptor-alpha (GRalpha), insulin-like growth factor I receptor (IGF-IR), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARgamma), enhancer-binding protein GATA-3, CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein-alpha undifferentiated protein (CUP/AP-2alpha), and endothelial cell-specific marker 2 (ECSM2). The mRNA concentrations of GRalpha correlated with PDIFF (r = 0.29, P = 0.03), but the others did not (IGF-IR, r = 0.003, P = 1.0; PPARgamma, r = -0.1, P = 0.5; GATA-3, r = 0.02, P = 0.9; CUP/AP-2alpha, r = -0.2, P = 0.1; ECSM2, r = 0.04, P = 0.7). Contrary to our hypothesis, the results may indicate a blunted in vitro differentiation potential of preadipocytes in centrally obese individuals. The lower differentiation potential of preadipocytes in the obese subjects might be due, at least partly, to decreased glucocorticoid receptor expression.
cAMP-dependent mechanisms regulate the steroidogenic acute regulatory (StAR) protein even though its promoter lacks a consensus cAMP response-element (CRE, TGACGTCA). Transcriptional regulation of the StAR gene has been demonstrated to involve combinations of DNA sequences that provide recognition motifs for sequence-specific transcription factors. We recently identified and characterized three canonical 5'-CRE half-sites within the cAMP-responsive region (-151/-1 bp) of the mouse StAR gene. Among these CRE elements, the CRE2 half-site is analogous (TGACTGA) to an activator protein-1 (AP-1) sequence [TGA(C/G)TCA]; therefore, the role of the AP-1 transcription factor was explored in StAR gene transcription. Mutation in the AP-1 element demonstrated an approximately 50% decrease in StAR reporter activity. Using EMSA, oligonucleotide probes containing an AP-1 binding site were found to specifically bind to nuclear proteins obtained from mouse MA-10 Leydig and Y-1 adrenocortical tumor cells. The integrity of the sequence-specific AP-1 element in StAR gene transcription was assessed using the AP-1 family members, Fos (c-Fos, Fra-1, Fra-2, and Fos B) and Jun (c-Jun, Jun B, and Jun D), which demonstrated the involvement of Fos and Jun in StAR gene transcription to varying degrees. Disruption of the AP-1 binding site reversed the transcriptional responses seen with Fos and Jun. EMSA studies utilizing antibodies specific to Fos and Jun demonstrated the involvement of several AP-1 family proteins. Functional assessment of Fos and Jun was further demonstrated by transfecting antisense c-Fos, Fra-1, and dominant negative forms of Fos (A-Fos) and c-Jun (TAM-67) into MA-10 cells, which significantly (P &lt; 0.01) repressed transcription of the StAR gene. Mutation of the AP-1 site in combination with mutations in other cis-elements resulted in a further decrease of StAR promoter activity, demonstrating a functional cooperation between these factors. Mammalian two-hybrid assays revealed high-affinity protein-protein interactions between c-Fos and c-Jun with steroidogenic factor 1, GATA-4, and CCAAT/enhancer binding protein-beta. These findings demonstrate that Fos and Jun can bind to the TGACTGA element in the StAR promoter and provide novel insights into the mechanisms regulating StAR gene transcription.
IRFs [IFN (interferon) regulatory factors] constitute a family of transcription factors involved in IFN signalling and in the development and differentiation of the immune system. IRF-2 has generally been described as an antagonist of IRF-1-mediated transcription of IFN and IFN-inducible genes; however, it has been recently identified as a transcriptional activator of some genes, such as those encoding histone H4, VCAM-1 (vascular cell adhesion molecule-1) and Fas ligand. Biologically, IRF-2 plays an important role in cell growth regulation and has been shown to be a potential oncogene. Studies in knock-out mice have also implicated IRF-2 in the differentiation and functionality of haematopoietic cells. Here we show that IRF-2 expression in a myeloid progenitor cell line leads to reprogramming of these cells towards the megakaryocytic lineage and enables them to respond to thrombopoietin, as assessed by cell morphology and expression of specific differentiation markers. Up-regulation of transcription factors involved in the development of the megakaryocytic lineage, such as GATA-1, GATA-2, FOG-1 (friend of GATA-1) and NF-E2 (nuclear factor-erythroid-2), and transcriptional stimulation of the thrombopoietin receptor were also demonstrated. Our results provide evidence for a key role for IRF-2 in the induction of a programme of megakaryocytic differentiation, and reveal a remarkable functional diversity of this transcription factor in the regulation of cellular responses.
The transcriptional activity of estrogen receptor-alpha is controlled by coregulators. MTA1 (metastasis-associated protein 1) represses estrogen receptor-alpha-driven transcription by recruiting histone deacetylases (HDACs) to the estrogen response element containing target gene chromatin in breast cancer cells. Using a yeast two-hybrid screen with the MTA1 C-terminal domain as bait, we identified MAT1 (ménage á trois 1) as an MTA1-binding protein. MAT1 is an assembly/targeting factor for cyclin-dependent kinase-activating kinase (CAK), which has been shown to functionally interact with general transcriptional factor TFIIH, a known inducer of ER transactivation. We show that estrogen signaling promotes nuclear translocation of MAT1 and that MTA1 interacts with MAT1 both in vitro and in vivo. MAT1 binds to the C-terminal 389-441 amino acids GATA domain and N-terminal 1-164 amino acids bromo-domain of MTA1, whereas MTA1 binds to the N-terminal ring finger domain of the MAT1. In addition, MAT1 interacts with the activation function 2 domain of ER and colocalizes with ER in activated cells. MTA1 deregulation in breast cancer cells led to its interactions with the CAK complex components, ER, and HDAC2. Accordingly, MTA1 inhibited CAK stimulation of ER transactivation that was partially relieved by HDAC inhibitor trichostatin A, suggesting that MTA1 might inhibit CAK-induced transactivation function of ER by recruiting HDAC. Furthermore, MTA1 overexpression inhibited the ability of CAK complex to phosphorylate ER. Together, these findings identified MAT1 as a target of MTA1 and provided new evidence to suggest that the transactivation functions of ER might be influenced by the regulatory interactions between CAK and MTA1 in breast cancer cells.
In mammals, anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) is produced by Sertoli cells from the onset of testicular differentiation and by granulosa cells after birth. In birds, AMH starts to be expressed in indifferent gonads of both sexes at a similar level and is later up-regulated in males. We previously demonstrated that, unlike in mammals, the onset of AMH expression occurs in chick embryo in the absence of SOX9. We looked for potential factors that might be involved in regulating AMH expression at different stages of chick gonad differentiation by comparing its expression pattern in embryos and young chicken with that of DMRT1, SF-1, WT1, GATA-4, Wnt-4, and Lhx9, by in situ hybridization. The results allowed us to distinguish different phases. (1) In indifferent gonads of both sexes, AMH is expressed in dispersed medullar cells. SF-1, WT1, GATA-4, Wnt-4, and DMRT1 are transcribed in the same region of the gonads, but none of these factors has an expression strictly coincident with that of AMH. Lhx9 is present only in the cortical area. (2) After this period, AMH is up-regulated in male gonads. The up-regulation is concomitant with the beginning of SOX9 expression and a sex dimorphic level of DMRT1 transcripts. It is followed by the aggregation of the AMH-positive cells (Sertoli cells) into testicular cords in which AMH is coexpressed with DMRT1, SF-1, WT1, GATA-4, and SOX9. (3) In the females, the low level of dispersed medullar AMH expression is conserved. With development of the cortex in the left ovary, cells expressing AMH accumulate in the juxtacortical part of the medulla, whereas they remain dispersed in the right ovary. At this stage, AMH expression is not strictly correlated with any of the studied factors. (4) After hatching, the organization of left ovarian cortex is characterized by the formation of follicles. Follicular cells express AMH in conjunction with SF-1, WT1, and GATA-4 and in the absence of SOX9, as in mammals. In addition, they express Lhx9 and Wnt-4, the latter being also found in the oocytes. (5) Moreover, unlike in mammals, the chicken ovary retains a dispersed AMH expression in cortical interstitial cells between the follicles, with no obvious correlation with any of the factors studied. Thus, the dispersed type of AMH expression in indifferent and female gonads appears to be bird-specific and not controlled by the same factors as testicular or follicular AMH transcription.
GATA-2 is considered to be essential for the development, maintenance, and function of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). However, it was also reported that GATA-2 inhibits the growth of HSCs. To examine the role of GATA-2 in the growth of hematopoietic cells, we introduced an estradiol-inducible form of GATA-2 (GATA-2/estrogen receptor [ER]) into interleukin 3 (IL-3)-dependent cell lines, Ba/F3, 32D, and FDC-P1. Estradiol-induced GATA-2 suppressed c-myc mRNA expression and inhibited IL-3-dependent growth in these clones. As for this mechanism, GATA-2 was found to inhibit ubiquitin/proteasome-dependent degradation of p21(WAF1) and p27(Kip1) and to induce their accumulation by repressing the expression of Skp2 and Cul1, both of which are components of the ubiquitin ligase for p21(WAF1) and p27(Kip1). Overexpression of c-myc restored the expression of Skp2 and Cul1 mRNA, reduced the amounts of p21(WAF1) and p27(Kip1) proteins, and canceled GATA-2-induced growth suppression, suggesting that down-regulation of c-myc expression may be primarily responsible for GATA-2-induced growth suppression. Next, we transduced retrovirus containing GATA-2/ER into murine bone marrow mononuclear cells (MNCs) and stem/progenitor (Sca-1(+)Lin(-)) cells. GATA-2/ER suppressed cytokine-dependent growth of MNCs and Sca-1(+)Lin(-) cells by about 70%, which was also accompanied by the reduced expression of c-myc, Skp2, and Cul1 mRNA and the accumulation of p21(WAF1) and p27(Kip1) proteins. In addition, the amount of GATA-2 protein was found to decline in hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells that were promoted to enter cell cycle by the stimulation with cytokines. These results suggest that GATA-2 may regulate expression levels of p21(WAF1) and p27(Kip1), thereby contributing to the quiescence of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells.
The type 1 parathyroid hormone receptor (PTHR1) binds, with equal affinity, two ligands with distinct biological functions: PTH, the major peptide hormone controlling calcium homeostasis, and the paracrine factor, PTH-related peptide (PTHrP), a local regulator of cellular proliferation and differentiation. To clarify the complexity of possible interactions between two distinct ligands, PTH and PTHrP, and their common receptor in the intact organism, and to identify as yet unrecognized roles for PTH in normal physiology, we have cloned and characterized the structural organization, nucleotide sequence and transcriptional regulation of the murine gene encoding PTH. One recombinant clone isolated from a mouse genomic library contained 14 kb of DNA, encompassing the entire Pth gene. The transcriptional unit spans 3.2 kb of genomic DNA and, analogous to the human PTH gene, it is interrupted by two introns. The deduced mRNA encodes the 115-amino acid precursor, preproPTH. Comparison of the murine preproPTH sequence with other mammalian forms of the protein shows it to be highly conserved and to share limited structural similarity to PTHrP at the amino-terminal region, a domain critical for binding and activation of their common receptor. Putative binding motifs for the transcription factors sex-determining region Y gene product, transcriptional repressor CDP, hepatic nuclear factor 3beta, GATA-binding factor 1, glucocorticoid receptor, SRY-related high mobility group box protein 5 and cAMP response element binding protein were identified in the 5' flanking region of the Pth gene. When placed upstream of a reporter gene, these sequences failed to confer transcriptional regulation in response to 1,25(OH)(2) vitamin D(3), but responded positively to the addition of isoproterenol and forskolin. Mutational analysis identified a cAMP-response element in the Pth promoter.
Estrogens can upregulate endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) in human endothelial cells by increasing eNOS promoter activity and enhancing the binding activity of the transcription factor Sp1. Resveratrol, a polyphenolic phytoalexin found in grapes and wine, has been reported to act as an agonist at the estrogen receptor. Therefore, we tested the effect of this putative phytoestrogen on eNOS expression in human endothelial cells.
Incubation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) and HUVEC-derived EA.hy 926 cells with resveratrol for 24 to 72 hours upregulated eNOS mRNA expression in a time- and concentration-dependent manner (up to 2.8-fold). eNOS protein expression and eNOS-derived NO production were also increased after long-term incubation with resveratrol. Resveratrol increased the activity of the eNOS promoter (3.5-kb fragment) in a concentration-dependent fashion, with the essential trans-stimulated sequence being located in the proximal 263 bp of the promoter sequence. In addition, eNOS mRNA was stabilized by resveratrol. The effect of resveratrol on eNOS expression was not modified by the estrogen receptor antagonists ICI 182780 and RU 58668. In electrophoretic mobility shift assays, nuclear extracts from resveratrol-incubated EA.hy 926 cells showed no enhanced binding activity of the eNOS promoter-relevant transcription factors Sp1, GATA, PEA3, YY1, or Elf-1. In addition to its long-term effects on eNOS expression, resveratrol also enhanced the production of bioactive NO in the short-term (after a 2-minute incubation).
In concert with other effects, the stimulation of eNOS expression and activity may contribute to the cardiovascular protective effects attributed to resveratrol.
The GATA transcription factors are crucial regulators of cell-specific gene expression in many tissues. GATA proteins are abundantly expressed in gonads of several species. In vertebrates, GATA factors are expressed from the onset of gonadal development and are later found in multiple cell lineages of both the testis and ovary. GATA factors activate transcription of several gonadal genes including the hormone-encoding genes Müllerian inhibiting substance (MIS) and inhibin alpha and genes involved in steroidogenesis like P450 aromatase (Cyp 19) and steroidogenic acute regulatory protein. GATA factors also contribute to cell-specific gonadal gene expression through cooperative interactions with other transcription factors such as the orphan nuclear receptor steroidogenic factor-1. GATA transcriptional activity is also modulated by two multitype zinc finger proteins called the Friend of GATA (FOG) proteins, which were cloned as GATA-specific cofactors. The FOG proteins (FOG-1 and FOG-2) can act as either enhancers or repressors of GATA transcriptional activity, depending on the cell and promoter context. We now report that the FOG proteins are coexpressed with GATA factors in testicular cells in which they differentially repress the promoter activities of several GATA-dependent target genes. These findings implicate the FOG proteins in the regulation of GATA-dependent gene transcription in the gonads.
Innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) are increasingly recognised as an innate immune counterpart of adaptive T-helper (TH) cells. In addition to their similar effector cytokine production, there is a strong parallel between the transcription factors that control the differentiation of T(H)1, T(H)2 and T(H)17 cells and ILC groups 1, 2 and 3, respectively. Here, we review the transcriptional circuit that specifies the development of a common ILC progenitor and its subsequent programming into distinct ILC groups. Notch, GATA-3 (GATA-binding protein 3), Nfil3 (nuclear factor interleukin-3) and Id2 (inhibitor of DNA-binding 2) are identified as early factors that suppress B- and T-cell potentials and are turned on in favour of ILC commitment. Natural killer cells, which are the cytotoxic ILCs, develop along a pathway distinct from the rest of the helper-like ILCs that are derived from a common progenitor to all helper-like ILCs (CHILPs). PLZF(-) (promyelocytic leukaemia zinc-finger) CHILPs give rise to lymphoid tissue inducer cells, while PLZF(+) CHILPs have multilineage potential and could give rise to ILCs 1, 2 and 3. Such lineage specificity is dictated by the controlled expression of T-bet (T-box expressed in T cells), RORα (retinoic acid receptor-related orphan nuclear receptor-α), RORγt (retinoic acid receptor-related orphan nuclear receptor-γt) and AHR (aryl hydrocarbon receptor). In addition to the type of transcription factors, the developmental stages at which these factors are expressed are crucial in specifying the fate of the ILCs.
Uroplakins are markers of terminally differentiated urothelium. Uroplakin II (UPII) is a newly described sensitive marker for urothelial carcinoma (UC). The expression profile of UPII in different types of UC and its utility in the diagnostic setting are needed. We evaluated UPII expression in bladder tissue microarrays, including urothelial neoplasm of low malignant potential (n = 8), low-grade papillary UC (n = 72), noninvasive high-grade papillary UC (n = 77), UC in situ (n = 27), and invasive high-grade UC (INVUC) (n = 122). UPII expression in 52 breast carcinomas and 38 high-grade prostate adenocarcinomas was also assessed. UPII expression was compared with GATA binding protein 3 (GATA3) and estrogen receptor for its role in facilitating the differential diagnosis of the above 3 types of malignancy. UPII labeling was seen in 83.0% of UC overall, including 95.7% of noninvasive UC and 65.6% of INVUC. UPII labeling was not found in any breast and prostate carcinomas. In comparison, GATA3 labeling was seen in 91.6% of all UCs, including 96.4% of noninvasive UCs and 85.1% of INVUC, with stronger intensity and extent compared with UPII (P &lt; .005). GATA3 labeled 2 (5%) of 38 high-grade prostate adenocarcinoma. Estrogen receptor nuclear labeling was seen in 13.0% of UCs and 12.5% of prostate carcinomas. UPII was highly specific (100%) but only moderately sensitive for UC and can therefore be a potentially useful marker to identify urothelial lineage and help distinguish UC from prostate cancer or, in conjunction with GATA3, from metastatic breast cancer. 
To evaluate the prognostic significance of GATA-binding protein 3 (GATA-3), gross cystic disease fluid protein-15 (GCDFP-15) and mammaglobin (MGB) in invasive breast carcinomas (IBCs).
GATA-3, GCDFP-15 and MGB were expressed in 37.9% (370/976), 26.0% (254/978) and 35.3% (348/986) of this cohort of 1017 IBCs, respectively. GCDFP-15 was an independent favourable prognostic factor in all cases [disease-free survival (DFS), hazard ratio (HR) 0.587, P = 0.049; overall survival (OS), HR 0.512, P = 0.049], as well as in oestrogen receptor (ER)-negative (DFS, HR 0.353, P = 0.012; OS, HR 0.310, P = 0.017) and HER2-positive (DFS, HR 0.279, P = 0.036; OS, HR 0.235, P = 0.050) cases; it also refined the prognostication of molecular apocrine cancers. GATA-3 and MGB did not show any prognostic significance.
The commonly used breast carcinoma biomarkers vary in their prognostic implications. GCDFP-15 independently indicated a favourable prognosis, especially in ER-negative, HER2-positive and molecular apocrine cancers. GATA-3 and MGB were not associated with outcome.
Studies in mammalian species showed that Krüppel-like factor 2 (KLF2) regulates adipogenesis. However, its role in birds is unclear. The objective of the current study was to explore the expression and function of KLF2 in chicken adipogenesis. Results showed that chicken KLF2 (Gallus gallus KLF2 [gKLF2]) was greatly expressed in abdominal adipose tissue, and its transcripts fluctuated during adipose tissue development. In addition, gKLF2 transcripts in abdominal adipose tissue of lean broilers were greater at 1 wk of age but lower at 3, 5, and 8 wk of age than those in fat broilers (P &lt; 0.05). The gKLF2 was more greatly expressed in preadipocytes than in mature adipocytes (P &lt; 0.05), and its expression level decreased during the preadipocyte differentiation in vitro (P &lt; 0.05). The functional analysis showed that gKLF2 overexpression inhibited chicken preadipocyte differentiation (P &lt; 0.05), accompanied by the reduced expression of CCAAT/enhancer binding protein α (C/EBPα) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) and the elevated expression of GATA binding protein 2 (GATA2). Additionally, the luciferase reporter assays showed that gKLF2 overexpression suppressed the promoter activities of chicken C/EBPα and PPARγ (P &lt; 0.05). In conclusion, our results indicated that gKLF2 inhibits chicken adipogenesis, at least in part, through inhibition of PPARγ and C/EBPα expression. 
The epidermis is maintained by epidermal stem cells (ESCs) that reside in distinct niches and contribute to homeostasis and wound closure. Keratinocytes at the nonhealing edges of venous ulcers (VUs) are healing-incompetent, hyperproliferative, and nonmigratory, suggesting deregulation of ESCs. To date, genes which regulate ESC niches have been studied in mice only. Utilizing microarray analysis of VU nonhealing edges, we identified changes in expression of genes harboring regulation of ESCs and their fate. In a prospective clinical study of 10 VUs, we confirmed suppression of the bone morphogenetic protein receptor (BMPR) and GATA binding protein 3 (GATA3) as well as inhibitors of DNA-binding proteins 2 and 4 (ID2 and ID4). We also found decreased levels of phosphorylated glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3), nuclear presence of β-catenin, and overexpression of its transcriptional target, c-myc, indicating activation of the Wnt pathway. Additionally, we found down-regulation of leucine-rich repeats and immunoglobulin-like domains protein 1 (LRIG1), a gene important for maintaining ESCs in a quiescent state, and absence of keratin 15 (K15), a marker of the basal stem cell compartment suggesting local depletion of ESCs. Our study shows that loss of genes important for regulation of ESCs and their fate along with activation of β-catenin and c-myc in the VU may contribute to ESC deprivation and a hyperproliferative, nonmigratory healing incapable wound edge. 
Group 3 innate lymphoid cells (ILC3) include IL-22-producing NKp46(+) cells and IL-17A/IL-22-producing CD4(+) lymphoid tissue inducerlike cells that express RORγt and are implicated in protective immunity at mucosal surfaces. Whereas the transcription factor Gata3 is essential for T cell and ILC2 development from hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and for IL-5 and IL-13 production by T cells and ILC2, the role for Gata3 in the generation or function of other ILC subsets is not known. We found that abundant GATA-3 protein is expressed in mucosa-associated ILC3 subsets with levels intermediate between mature B cells and ILC2. Chimeric mice generated with Gata3-deficient fetal liver hematopoietic precursors lack all intestinal RORγt(+) ILC3 subsets, and these mice show defective production of IL-22 early after infection with the intestinal pathogen Citrobacter rodentium, leading to impaired survival. Further analyses demonstrated that ILC3 development requires cell-intrinsic Gata3 expression in fetal liver hematopoietic precursors. Our results demonstrate that Gata3 plays a generalized role in ILC lineage determination and is critical for the development of gut RORγt(+) ILC3 subsets that maintain mucosal barrier homeostasis. These results further extend the paradigm of Gata3-dependent regulation of diversified innate ILC and adaptive T cell subsets. 
Determining the indications for adjuvant chemotherapy (CT) in patients with hormone receptor (HR)-positive/HER2-negative breast cancer are difficult. The transcription factors GATA-binding protein 3 (GATA-3) and Forkhead-box protein A1 (FOXA1) are crucial for the hormone responsive phenotype of breast cancer. This study evaluated whether the expression of GATA-3 and FOXA1 is a prognostic and predictive marker of outcomes in patients with HR-positive/HER2-negative breast cancer.
The expression of GATA-3 and FOXA1 was analyzed immunohistochemically in 214 patients with invasive breast cancer to evaluate the association with the clinicopathological features and the prognosis.
GATA-3 expression was positively correlated with FOXA1 expression (P &lt; 0.0001). Both GATA-3 and FOXA1 were positively correlated with ER (P &lt; 0.0001 each) and PR expression (P = 0.0001 and P = 0.0009, respectively), and inversely correlated with nuclear grade (P = 0.0002 and P = 0.0018, respectively) and Ki67 index (P = 0.0052 and P = 0.0049, respectively). Expression of GATA-3 and FOXA1 was associated with better prognosis. FOXA1 was an independent favorable prognostic marker in HR-positive/HER2-negative breast cancer. Disease-free survival rates were similar in patients with HR-positive/HER2-negative breast cancer and high FOXA1 expression given adjuvant hormone therapy (HT) alone and those given CT plus HT.
GATA-3 and FOXA1 are associated with a less aggressive phenotype and a better prognosis in patients with HR-positive/HER2-negative breast cancer. FOXA1 may be useful in identifying those patients who may not require adjuvant CT.
Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) is an acquired autoimmune disorder. Both impaired platelet production and T cell-mediated effects play a role in ITP thrombocytopenia. A Th1 polarization of the immune response, up-regulation of Th17 cells and decreased number of Treg cells have been demonstrated in ITP patients. High-dose dexamethasone was administered as first-line therapy in adult patients with ITP. However, the mechanism of effects of dexamethasone on ITP is still unclear. In this study, we tested the effectiveness of high-dose dexamethasone as initial treatment in adults with immune thrombocytopenic purpura. PBMCs were isolated from Donors, ITP and Treatment groups. T cell subsets were analyzed by FCM and transcriptional factors were checked by Real-time PCR. We found that dexamethasone returned the ratio of Th1/Th2 and the number of Th17 and Treg cells to the normal levels. Furthermore, we identified that dexamethasone corrected the T cell subset levels through inhibiting GATA3 and FOXp3 expression and promoting RORγt expression. Taken together, we reported a previously unrecognized mechanism on dexamethasone in the ITP treatment. 
The molecular mechanisms governing sex determination and differentiation in the zebrafish (Danio rerio) are not fully understood. To gain more insights into the function of specific genes in these complex processes, the expression of multiple candidates needs to be assessed, preferably on the protein level. Here, we developed a targeted proteomics method based on selected reaction monitoring (SRM) to study the candidate sex-related proteins in zebrafish which were selected based on a global proteomics analysis of adult gonads and representational difference analysis of male and female DNA, as well as on published information on zebrafish and other vertebrates. We employed the developed SRM protocols to acquire time-resolved protein expression profiles during the gonad differentiation period in vas::EGFP transgenic zebrafish. Evidence on protein expression was obtained for the first time for several candidate genes previously studied only on the mRNA level or suggested by bioinformatic predictions. Tuba1b (tubulin alpha 1b), initially included in the study as one of the potential housekeeping proteins, was found to be preferentially expressed in the adult testis with nearly absent expression in the ovary. The revealed changes in protein expression patterns associated with gonad differentiation suggest that several of the examined proteins, especially Ilf2 and Ilf3 (interleukin enhancer-binding factors 2 and 3), Raldh3 (retinaldehyde dehydrogenase type 3), Zgc:195027 (low density lipoprotein-related receptor protein 3) and Sept5a (septin 5a), may play a specific role in the sexual differentiation in zebrafish. 
Reg (regenerating gene) product, Reg protein, is induced in pancreatic β-cells and acts as autocrine/paracrine growth factor for regeneration via the cell surface Reg receptor. However, high concentrations of Reg I protein induced β-cell apoptosis. In the present study, we found that hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) attenuated the β-cell apoptosis induced by the high concentrations of Reg I protein and that the combined stimulation of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and dexamethasone (Dx) induced the accumulation of HGF mRNA as well as Reg I mRNA in β-cells. The accumulation of the HGF mRNA was caused by the activation of the HGF promoter. Deletion analysis revealed that the region of -96 to -92 of the HGF gene was responsible for the promoter activation by IL-6+Dx. The promoters contain a consensus transcription factor binding sequence for signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT). Site-directed mutations of STAT-binding motif in the region markedly attenuated the HGF promoter activity. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay showed that STAT3 is located at the active HGF promoter in response to IL-6+Dx stimulation. These results strongly suggest that the combined stimulation of IL-6 and glucocorticoids induces the activation of both Reg and HGF genes and that the anti-apoptotic effects of HGF against the Reg I-induced apoptosis may help β-cell regeneration by Reg I protein. 
Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is a critical factor for inducing acute lung injury. GATA-2, a transcription factor, contributes to the control of cell activity and function. Exposure of RAW 264.7 cells to LPS induced interleukin (IL)-1β mRNA and protein expression and GATA-2 translocation from the cytoplasm to nuclei in concentration- and time-dependent manners. A bioinformatic search revealed that GATA-2-specific binding elements exist in the 5'-promoter region of the il-1β gene. LPS could enhance the transactivation activity of GATA-2 in macrophages. Knocking-down translation of GATA-2 mRNA using RNA interference significantly alleviated LPS-induced IL-1β mRNA and protein expression. As to the mechanism, transfection of toll-like receptor (TLR) 4 small interfering (si)RNA into macrophages concurrently decreased LPS-caused increases in nuclear GATA-2 levels. Sequentially, treatment with myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88) siRNA decreased LPS-induced phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) kinase 1/2 and subsequent translocation of GATA-2. Reducing MAPK activities using specific inhibitors simultaneously decreased GATA-2 activation. Furthermore, exposure of primary macrophages to LPS significantly increased the transactivation activities of GATA-2 and IL-1β mRNA and protein expression. Transfection of GATA-2 siRNA inhibited LPS-induced IL-1β mRNA expression. Results of this study show that LPS induction of il-1β gene expression in macrophages is mediated by GATA-2 via activation of TLR4, MyD88, and MAPKs. 
The ubiquitous use of dibutyl phthalate (DBP), one of the most widely used plasticizers, results in extensive exposure to humans and the environment. DBP and its major metabolite, monobutyl phthalate (MBP), may alter steroid biosynthesis and their exposure may lead to damage to male reproductive function. Low-doses of DBP/MBP may result in increased steroidogenesis in vitro and in vivo. However, the mechanisms of possible effects of low-dose MBP on steroidogenesis remain unclear. The aim of present study was to elaborate the role of transcription factors and steroidogenic acute regulatory protein in low-dose MBP-induced distruption of steroidogenesis in mouse Leydig tumor cells (MLTC-1 cells).
In the present study, MLTC-1 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 2 g/L sodium bicarbonate. Progesterone level was examined by I125-pregesterone Coat-A-Count radioimmunoassay (RIA) kits. mRNA and protein levels were assessed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and western blot, respectively. DNA-binding of several transcription factors was examined by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA).
In this study, various doses of MBP (0, 10(-9), 10(-8), 10(-7), or 10(-6) M) were added to the medium followed by stimulation of MLTC-1 cells with human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG). The results showed that MBP increased progesterone production and steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR) mRNA and protein levels. However, the protein levels of cytochrome P450scc and 3 beta-hydroxy-steroid dehydrogenase (3 beta-HSD) were unchanged after MBP treatment. EMSA assay showed that DNA-binding of steroidogenic factors 1(SF-1), GATA-4 and CCAAT/enhancer binding protein-beta (C/EBP-beta) was increased in a dose-dependent manner after MBP exposure. Western blot tests were next employed and confirmed that the protein levels of SF-1, GATA-4 and C/EBP-beta were also increased. Additionally, western blot tests confirmed the expression of DAX-1, negative factor of SF-1, was dose-dependently down regulated after MBP exposure, which further confirmed the role of SF-1 in MBP-stimulated steroid biosynthesis.
In conclusion, we firstly delineated the regulation of StAR by transcription factors including SF-1, GATA-4 and C/EBP-beta maybe critical mechanism involved in low-dose MBP-stimulated steroidogenesis.
Human steroid biosynthesis depends on a specifically regulated cascade of enzymes including 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases (HSD3Bs). Type 2 HSD3B catalyzes the conversion of pregnenolone, 17α-hydroxypregnenolone and dehydroepiandrosterone to progesterone, 17α-hydroxyprogesterone and androstenedione in the human adrenal cortex and the gonads but the exact regulation of this enzyme is unknown. Therefore, specific downregulation of HSD3B2 at adrenarche around age 6-8 years and characteristic upregulation of HSD3B2 in the ovaries of women suffering from the polycystic ovary syndrome remain unexplained prompting us to study the regulation of HSD3B2 in adrenal NCI-H295R cells. Our studies confirm that the HSD3B2 promoter is regulated by transcription factors GATA, Nur77 and SF1/LRH1 in concert and that the NBRE/Nur77 site is crucial for hormonal stimulation with cAMP. In fact, these three transcription factors together were able to transactivate the HSD3B2 promoter in placental JEG3 cells which normally do not express HSD3B2. By contrast, epigenetic mechanisms such as methylation and acetylation seem not involved in controlling HSD3B2 expression. Cyclic AMP was found to exert differential effects on HSD3B2 when comparing short (acute) versus long-term (chronic) stimulation. Short cAMP stimulation inhibited HSD3B2 activity directly possibly due to regulation at co-factor or substrate level or posttranslational modification of the protein. Long cAMP stimulation attenuated HSD3B2 inhibition and increased HSD3B2 expression through transcriptional regulation. Although PKA and MAPK pathways are obvious candidates for possibly transmitting the cAMP signal to HSD3B2, our studies using PKA and MEK1/2 inhibitors revealed no such downstream signaling of cAMP. However, both signaling pathways were clearly regulating HSD3B2 expression. 
TRPS-1 is a new GATA transcription factor that is differentially expressed in breast cancer (BC) where it been found recently to regulate epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT).
We carried out a quantitative immunohistochemistry (qIHC) analysis of TRPS-1 expression in 341 primary-stage I-III BC samples in relation to patient clinical characteristics as well as its prognostic value, especially in an estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) subgroup.
Higher TRPS-1 expression was significantly associated with a number of clinical and pathological characteristics as well as with improved overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS). Among stage I/II ER+ BC patients who received endocrine therapy alone, those with high TRPS-1 expression had significantly longer OS and DFS. There was also a strong association between TRPS-1 levels and the EMT marker E-cadherin in the ER+ invasive ductal carcinoma cases. Analysis of gene expression data on a panel of BC lines found that TRPS-1 expression was low or absent in BC lines having enriched mesenchymal features.
Our data indicated that TRPS-1 is an independent prognostic marker in early-stage BC and a new EMT marker that can distinguish patients with ER+ BC who will respond longer to adjuvant endocrine therapy.
The aim of this study was to investigate the clinicopathological characteristics of GATA binding protein 3 (GATA3)-positive breast cancers as well as the association of GATA3 expression with response to chemotherapy.
Tumor specimens obtained before neoadjuvant chemotherapy [paclitaxel followed by 5-fluorouracil/epirubicin/cyclophosphamide)] from breast cancer patients (n = 130) were subjected to immunohistochemical and mutational analysis of GATA3 and DNA microarray gene expression analysis for intrinsic subtyping.
Seventy-four tumors (57%) were immunohistochemically positive for GATA3. GATA3-positive tumors were significantly more likely to be lobular cancer, estrogen receptor (ER)-positive, progesterone receptor (PgR)-positive, Ki67-negative, and luminal A tumors. Somatic mutations were found in only three tumors. Pathological complete response (pCR) was observed in 8 (11%) GATA3-positive tumors and in 22 (39%) GATA3-negative tumors. multivariate analysis showed that tumor size, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (her2), and gata3 were independent predictors of pcr.
GATA3-positive breast cancers showed luminal differentiation characterized by high ER expression and were mostly classified as luminal-type tumors following intrinsic subtyping. Interestingly, GATA3 was an independent predictor of response to chemotherapy, suggesting that GATA3 might be clinically useful as a predictor of a poor response to chemotherapy.
Prestin is the motor protein of the outer hair cells of the organ of Corti and a key factor in ensuring a high level of sensitivity of mammalian hearing. The factors that influence prestin expression are still largely unknown. We studied the effects of the application of retinoic acid, a ligand of a nuclear receptor, and of butyric acid, an inhibitor of histone deacetylase activity, on the expression of mRNA of prestin and Gata-3 in the organotypic culture of the organ of Corti of newborn rats using RT-PCR. Application of retinoic acid at concentrations of 1-50 μM results in a dose-dependent expression decrease after two days in culture. Treatment with sodium butyrate (0.5-2 mM) elevated the expression of prestin and Gata-3. Statistically significant correlations between Gata-3 and prestin mRNA levels were observed under all conditions. The data indicate that retinoid nuclear transcription factors, GATA-3 and histone acetylation/deacetylation processes may have a regulatory role to play in prestin expression.
CYP11A1 is a key enzyme in steroid synthesis abundantly expressed in the adrenal, testis, ovary, and placenta. This article reviews recent studies on cis-regulatory elements and trans-regulators of the CYP11A1 promoter, with special focus on their tissue-specific regulation. Trans-regulators include tissue-specific factors such as SF-1, DAX-1, TReP-132, LBP, and GATA that regulate tissue-specific expression of CYP11A1. These tissue-specific factors interact with factors commonly present in most cells like AP-1, Sp1, and AP-2 to bring CYP11A1 transcription to full potential. These transcription factors stimulate CYP11A1 transcriptional activity through interaction with their specific cis-elements or through protein-protein interaction. The cis-element on the Cyp11a1 promoter was further characterized in vitro and in vivo. Mutation of the proximal SF-1-binding site results in down regulation of CYP11A1 in the adrenal and testis but not in the ovary and placenta, leading to attenuated corticosterone circadian rhythms and blunted stress response.
Estrogen receptors (ERs) play a pivotal role in adipogenesis; therefore, compounds targeting ERs may also affect fat formation. Recent studies have shown that the Dioscorea plant (commonly called yam) exhibits an antiobesity effect on rodents. However, the active compounds and underlying mechanisms responsible for this effect are not yet fully understood. We evaluated the effects of pseudoprotodiocsin (PPD), a steroid saponin from Dioscorea nipponica Makino (a type of Dioscorea), on adipogenesis and the mechanisms underlying this effect. Treatment with PPD at the onset of adipogenic differentiation resulted in significantly decreased adipogenesis in both in vitro and in vivo experimental systems. An increased amount of ERalpha mRNA, protein, and the accumulation of ERalpha in the nucleus were also observed. However, the expression pattern of ERbeta was not altered. Furthermore, the antiadipogenic effect of PPD was found to be ER dependent. It was also accompanied by the decreased expression of several genes involved in adipogenesis, including lipoprotein lipase (LPL), leptin, CCAAT/enhancer-binding-protein-alpha (C/EBPalpha), and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARgamma), as well as the increased expression of some negative factors of adipogenesis, including preadipocyte factor 1 (Pre-1), GATA-binding protein 2 (GATA-2), GC-induced leucine-zipper protein (GILZ), and C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP-10). In addition to its estrogenic action, PPD also abolished the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK) activation. Our results suggest that PPD inhibits adipogenesis in an ER-dependent manner and induces the expression of ERalpha. These findings may provide a lead toward a novel agent that can be used to treat obesity.
Estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha)-positive breast cancers that co-express transcription factors GATA-3 and FOXA1 have a favorable prognosis. These transcription factors form an autoregulatory hormonal network that influences estrogen responsiveness and sensitivity to hormonal therapy. Disruption of this network may be a mechanism whereby ERalpha-positive breast cancers become resistant to therapy. The transcription factor T-bet is a negative regulator of GATA-3 in the immune system. In this study, we report that insulin increases the expression of T-bet in breast cancer cells, which correlates with reduced expression of GATA-3, FOXA1, and the ERalpha:FOXA1:GATA-3 target gene GREB-1. The effects of insulin on GATA-3 and FOXA1 could be recapitulated through overexpression of T-bet in MCF-7 cells (MCF-7-T-bet). Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays revealed reduced ERalpha binding to GREB-1 enhancer regions in MCF-7-T-bet cells and in insulin-treated MCF-7 cells. MCF-7-T-bet cells were resistant to tamoxifen in the presence of insulin and displayed prolonged extracellular signal-regulated kinase and AKT activation in response to epidermal growth factor treatment. ERalpha-positive cells with intrinsic tamoxifen resistance as well as MCF-7 cells with acquired tamoxifen and fulvestrant resistance expressed elevated levels of T-bet and/or reduced levels of FOXA1 and GATA-3. Analysis of publicly available databases revealed ERalpha-positive/T-bet-positive breast cancers expressing lower levels of FOXA1 (P = 0.0137) and GATA-3 (P = 0.0063) compared with ERalpha-positive/T-bet-negative breast cancers. Thus, T-bet expression in primary tumors and circulating insulin levels may serve as surrogate biomarkers to identify ERalpha-positive breast cancers with a dysfunctional hormonal network, enhanced growth factor signaling, and resistance to hormonal therapy.
The mixed-lineage kinases (MLKs) act upstream of mitogen-activated protein kinases, but their role in cardiac biology and pathology is largely unknown.
We investigated the effect of a MLK1-3 inhibitor CEP-11004 on G protein-coupled receptor agonist-induced stress response in neonatal rat cardiac myocytes in culture.
CEP-11004 administration dose-dependently attenuated phenylephrine and endothelin-1 (ET-1)-induced c-Jun N-terminal kinase activation. MLK inhibition also reduced ET-1- and phenylephrine-induced phosphorylation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase. In contrast, phenylephrine-induced extracellular signal-regulated kinase phosphorylation was further up-regulated by CEP-11004. ET-1 increased activator protein-1 binding activity 3.5-fold and GATA-binding protein 4 (GATA-4) binding activity 1.8-fold, both of which were attenuated with CEP-11004 administration by 59% and 63% respectively. Phenylephrine induced activator protein-1 binding activity by 2.6-fold, which was decreased by 81% with CEP-11004 administration. Phenylephrine also induced a 3.7-fold increase in the transcriptional activity of B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP), which was attenuated by 41% with CEP-11004 administration. In agreement, MLK inhibition also reduced hypertrophic agonist-induced secretion of immunoreactive atrial natriuretic peptide and BNP.
These results showed that inhibition of the MLK1-3 signalling pathway was sufficient for suppressing the activity of key nuclear effectors (GATA-4 and activator protein-1 transcription factors) in cardiac hypertrophy, and attenuated the agonist-induced atrial natriuretic peptide secretion and activation of BNP gene transcription.
Retinoids play an important role in lung development. Recently, prenatal treatment with retinoic acid (RA) has been reported to stimulate alveologenesis in hypoplastic lungs in the nitrofen model of congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH). Chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter-transcription factor II (COUP-TFII) is a transcription factor in the steroid/thyroid hormone receptor superfamily, and targeted ablation of COUP-TFII causes CDH and associated lung hypoplasia in mice. Friend of GATA 2 (FOG2) is a zinc finger-containing protein that modulates the transcriptional activity of GATA proteins. GATA4 is a member of a family of DNA-binding proteins, which is found in the promoter regions of many genes. The COUP-TFII, FOG2, and GATA4 genes, regulated by the retinoid signaling pathway, are located on chromosomes 15q26, 8q23, and 8p23.1 respectively, regions reported to be deleted in individuals with CDH. The aim of this study was to examine the pulmonary gene expression of COUP-TFII, FOG2, and GATA4 in the nitrofen model of CDH.
Pregnant rats were exposed to either olive oil or 100 mg nitrofen on day 9 of gestation (D9). 5 mg/kg of RA was given intraperitoneally on days D18, D19, and D20. The fetuses were recovered by caesarean section on D21, and the diaphragm was carefully examined for the presence of a hernia under a microscope. Left lungs were obtained from CDH fetuses and controls and divided into four groups: control (n = 9), control + RA (n = 9), CDH (n = 9), and CDH + RA (n = 9). The relative mRNA expression levels of COUP-TFII, FOG2, and GATA4 were analyzed in each lung by real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction from cDNA generated by mRNA from pulmonary total RNA.
The relative mRNA expression levels of COUP-TFII, FOG2, and GATA4 were significantly increased in CDH + RA lungs compared to control, control + RA, and CDH (P &lt; .05).
Up-regulation of pulmonary gene expression of COUP-TFII, FOG2, and GATA4 after prenatal treatment with retinoic acid in the nitrofen model of CDH suggests that RA may have a therapeutic potential in modulating lung growth. Furthermore, these results support the concept that these proteins work together to regulate downstream target genes that play an important role in the development of lung.
The androgen receptor (AR) plays important roles in the development of male phenotype and in different human diseases including prostate cancers. The AR can act either as a promoter or a tumor suppressor depending on cell types. The AR proliferative response program has been well studied, but its prohibitive response program has not yet been thoroughly studied.
Previous studies found that PC3 cells expressing the wild-type AR inhibit growth and suppress invasion. We applied expression profiling to identify the response program of PC3 cells expressing the AR (PC3-AR) under different growth conditions (i.e. with or without androgens and at different concentration of androgens) and then applied the newly developed ChIP-seq technology to identify the AR binding regions in the PC3 cancer genome. A surprising finding was that the comparison of MOCK-transfected PC3 cells with AR-transfected cells identified 3,452 differentially expressed genes (two fold cutoff) even without the addition of androgens (i.e. in ethanol control), suggesting that a ligand independent activation or extremely low-level androgen activation of the AR. ChIP-Seq analysis revealed 6,629 AR binding regions in the cancer genome of PC3 cells with an FDR (false discovery rate) cut off of 0.05. About 22.4% (638 of 2,849) can be mapped to within 2 kb of the transcription start site (TSS). Three novel AR binding motifs were identified in the AR binding regions of PC3-AR cells, and two of them share a core consensus sequence CGAGCTCTTC, which together mapped to 27.3% of AR binding regions (1,808/6,629). In contrast, only about 2.9% (190/6,629) of AR binding sites contains the canonical AR matrix M00481, M00447 and M00962 (from the Transfac database), which is derived mostly from AR proliferative responsive genes in androgen dependent cells. In addition, we identified four top ranking co-occupancy transcription factors in the AR binding regions, which include TEF1 (Transcriptional enhancer factor), GATA (GATA transcription factors), OCT (octamer transcription factors) and PU1 (PU.1 transcription factor).
Our data provide a valuable data set in understanding the molecular basis for growth inhibition response program of the AR in prostate cancer cells, which can be exploited for developing novel prostate cancer therapeutic strategies.
Decreased Th1/Th2 ratio is one of the major characteristics of immunosuppression in sepsis. Both membrane adhesive protein Annexin-A1 (ANXA1) and transcription factor GATA-3 have been reported to play important roles in T cell differentiation. However, the relationship between ANXA1 and GATA-3 in Th1/Th2 shift is unknown. Our study investigated the interaction effects of ANXA1 and GATA-3 to influence T cell differentiation in CD4+ T cells. We found that GATA-3 and ANXA1 were coexpressed on Th0/Th1/Th2 cytoplasm and nuclear. Overexpressed ANXA1 significantly increased the expression of IFNγ and reduced IL-4 expression in T cells, while ANXA1-silenced T cells exhibited decreased production of IFNγ and increased production of IL-4. Knockdown of ANXA1 promoted higher expression level of GATA-3 and low level of T-box transcription factor (T-bet/Tbx21). Further study demonstrated that ANXA1 regulated GATA-3 expression through the formyl peptide receptor like-1 (FPRL-1) downstream signaling pathways ERK and PKB/Akt. These results suggested that ANXA1 modulates GATA-3/T-bet expression induced Th0/Th1 differentiation. Moreover, we found that GATA-3 inhibited ANXA1 expression by binding to its promoter for the first time. It is proposed that the interactions between ANXA1 and GATA-3 may provide clues to understand the immunosuppression and have potential as new therapeutic targets in immunotherapy after sepsis.
GATA-binding protein 3 (GATA3) is a diagnostically useful immunohistochemical marker of breast cancer. Because of its strong association with estrogen receptor expression, GATA3 has markedly reduced sensitivity in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). We constructed a tissue microarray using a large series of TNBCs and evaluated GATA3 expression by TNBC subtype as defined by surrogate immunohistochemical markers. A total of 205 TNBCs were classified into cancers of the molecular apocrine type (n=23, 11.2%), claudin-low type (n=21, 10.2%), basal-like type (n=91, 44.4%), mixed type (n=62, 30.2%), and null type (n=8, 3.9%). The GATA3 scores (staining intensity × proportion) were categorized as negative (0), focally positive (1-10), or positive (11-300). GATA3 staining was negative in 153 cancers (74.6%), focally positive in 11 (5.4%), and positive in 41 (20.0%). The rate of focal positivity or positivity for GATA3 was significantly higher in the molecular apocrine type (73.9%, 17/23) than in other types of TNBCs (P=.001). The mean GATA3 score of molecular apocrine-type TNBC was significantly higher than that of the other types (P=.001) and differed significantly between androgen receptor (AR)-positive and AR-negative TNBCs (P&lt;.001). In conclusion, GATA3 expression was correlated strongly with AR-positive, molecular apocrine-type TNBCs. Co-expression of AR and GATA3 is a specific feature of molecular apocrine-type TNBC, which may serve as a diagnostic aid for cancer of unknown primary.
Acute anterior uveitis (AAU) is the most common form of uveitis and is a frequent ocular manifestation of ankylosing spondylitis (AS). Thymocyte CD4+ cells have been reported to play an important role in the pathogenesis of both AAU and AS. To test whether the copy number variations (CNVs) of CD4+ T cell transcription factor genes including T-bet, GATA binding protein 3 (GATA)-3, related orphan receptor C (RORC) and forkhead box protein 3 (FOXP3) are associated with acute anterior uveitis either in the presence or absence of ankylosing spondylitis (AAU+AS+; AAU+AS-).
The study included 676 patients with AAU, including 298 patients with AAU+AS+, 378 patients with AAU+AS-, and 596 unrelated healthy controls in a Chinese Han population. Copy number variations were examined by real-time PCR.
The frequency of a high copy number (CN) of T-bet was increased in AAU+AS+ as well as AAU+AS- patients when compared with controls (P value after Bonferroni correction [P(corr)] = 4.3 × 10(-5); odds ratio [OR] = 2.0 and P(corr) = 1.2 × 10(-8); OR = 2.3, respectively). The frequency of a high CN of GATA-3 was significantly higher in AAU+AS+ patients than in controls (P(corr) = 1.8 × 10(-7); OR = 4.9). A higher frequency of CN of FOXP3 was found in female AAU+AS+ patients and female AAU+AS- patients (P(corr) = 0.005, OR = 5.9 and P(corr) = 0.004, OR = 4.9, respectively ). No association was found between CNVs of RORC and AAU+AS- or AAU+AS+ patients.
A high copy number of T-bet and GATA-3 confers susceptibility to AAU and AS, and a high copy number of FOXP3 confers susceptibility to female patients with AAU either with or without AS.
The transcription factor GATA-3 is indispensable for the development of all innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) that express the interleukin 7 receptor α-chain (IL-7Rα). However, the function of low GATA-3 expression in committed group 3 ILCs (ILC3 cells) has not been identified. We found that GATA-3 regulated the homeostasis of ILC3 cells by controlling IL-7Rα expression. In addition, GATA-3 served a critical function in the development of the NKp46(+) ILC3 subset by regulating the balance between the transcription factors T-bet and RORγt. Among NKp46(+) ILC3 cells, although GATA-3 positively regulated genes specific to the NKp46(+) ILC3 subset, it negatively regulated genes specific to lymphoid tissue-inducer (LTi) or LTi-like ILC3 cells. Furthermore, GATA-3 was required for IL-22 production in both ILC3 subsets. Thus, despite its low expression, GATA-3 was critical for the homeostasis, development and function of ILC3 subsets. 
GATA-3, a member of the GATA family of zinc-finger DNA binding proteins, and FOXA1, a member of the forkhead transcription factor family, are both associated with estrogen receptor expression. Both GATA-3 and FOXA1 are useful markers for breast carcinoma, but their expression in the different breast cancer subtypes and other neoplasms has not been thoroughly evaluated. We examined the expression of GATA-3 and FOXA1 in estrogen receptor-positive, Her2/neu-positive, and triple-negative breast carcinomas as well as in 10 other common carcinomas, including hepatocellular, colonic, pancreatic, gastric, endometrial (endometrioid), lung, prostatic, renal cell, urothelial, and ovarian serous carcinomas. Primary and metastatic melanomas and mesotheliomas were also evaluated. GATA-3 and FOXA1 staining of estrogen receptor-positive breast carcinomas was seen in 96.6% and 96.2%, respectively. In triple-negative breast carcinomas, GATA-3 and FOXA1 staining was seen in 21.6% and 15.9%, respectively. Among the other tumors, GATA-3 staining was only seen in urothelial carcinoma (70.9%) and FOXA1 staining was only seen in prostatic (87.5%), urothelial (5.1%) carcinomas, and mesotheliomas (40.0%). In conclusion, GATA-3 and FOXA1 are excellent breast carcinoma markers; however, their utility is limited in the triple-negative subtype. The utility of FOXA1 in diagnosing prostatic carcinoma and mesothelioma warrants further investigation. 
Female adnexal tumors of probable wolffian origin (FATWOs) are rare. They can closely mimic endometrioid adenocarcinomas with a prominent spindle cell component and Sertoli cell tumors (SCTs). To further define their immunohistochemical profile and origin, we investigated the expression of PAX-8, PAX-2, and GATA binding protein 3 (GATA-3) (wolffian markers) and of steroidogenic factor-1 (SF-1) (sex-cord stromal marker) in FATWOs. We also studied the expression of PAX-8 and PAX-2 in endometrioid adenocarcinomas; of SF-1 in Sertoli-Leydig cell and SCTs; and of PAX-8, PAX-2, GATA-3, and SF-1 in rete ovarii-a proposed site of origin for FATWOs. A database search yielded 8 FATWOs, 18 ovarian/tubal/paraovarian endometrioid adenocarcinomas, and 8 ovarian Sertoli-Leydig cell and SCTs. Eleven cases with rete ovarii sections were included. Of the FATWOs studied, all were negative for PAX-8, PAX-2, GATA-3, and SF-1. Of the endometrioid adenocarcinomas studied, PAX-8 was positive in all and PAX-2 was positive in 57%. Of the Sertoli-Leydig cell and SCTs, all were positive for SF-1 except one. The rete ovarii were positive for PAX-8, weakly positive for SF-1, and negative for PAX-2 and GATA-3. Our study suggests that PAX-8 and SF-1 can be helpful in the distinction between FATWOs and endometrioid adenocarcinomas and SCTs, respectively. Our results do not support a Mullerian or sex-cord stromal or rete ovarii origin for FATWOs. It is curious, however, that FATWOs do not express wolffian markers-it is possibly related to their origin from a distinctive portion of the wolffian duct. 
The adrenal glands consist of an outer cortex and an inner medulla, and their primary purposes include hormone synthesis and secretion. The adrenal cortex produces a complex array of steroid hormones, whereas the medulla is part of the sympathetic nervous system and produces the catecholamines epinephrine and norepinephrine. In the mouse, GATA binding protein (GATA) 4 and GATA6 transcription factors are coexpressed in several embryonic tissues, including the adrenal cortex. To explore the roles of GATA4 and GATA6 in mouse adrenal development, we conditionally deleted these genes in adrenocortical cells using the Sf1Cre strain of animals. We report here that mice with Sf1Cre-mediated double deletion of Gata4 and Gata6 genes lack identifiable adrenal glands, steroidogenic factor 1-positive cortical cells and steroidogenic gene expression in the adrenal location. The inactivation of the Gata6 gene alone (Sf1Cre;Gata6(flox/flox)) drastically reduced the adrenal size and corticosterone production in the adult animals. Adrenocortical aplasia is expected to result in the demise of the animal within 2 weeks after birth unless glucocorticoids are provided. In accordance, Sf1Cre;Gata4(flox/flox)Gata6(flox/flox) females depend on steroid supplementation to survive after weaning. Surprisingly, Sf1Cre;Gata4(flox/flox)Gata6(flox/flox) males appear to live normal lifespans as vital steroidogenic synthesis shifts to their testes. Our results reveal a requirement for GATA factors in adrenal development and provide a novel tool to characterize the transcriptional network controlling adrenocortical cell fates. 
Hyperosmolarity decreases claudin-2 expression in renal tubular epithelial cells, but the molecular mechanism remains undefined. Here, we found that the hyperosmolarity-induced decrease in claudin-2 expression is inhibited by Go6983, a non-selective protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor, and PKCβ specific inhibitor in Madin-Darby canine kidney II cells. Hyperosmolarity increased intracellular free Ca(2+) concentration and phosphorylated PKCβ level, which were inhibited by RN-1734, an antagonist of transient receptor potential vanilloid 4 channel. Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, a PKC activator, decreased claudin-2 expression. These results indicate hyperosmolarity decreases claudin-2 expression mediated by the activation of RN-1734-sensitive channel and PKCβ. Hyperosmolarity decreased promoter activity of claudin-2, which was inhibited by Go6983 and PKCβ inhibitor similar to those in real-time PCR and Western blotting. The effect of hyperosmolarity on promoter activity was not observed in the construct of -469/-6, a deletion mutant. Claudin-2 has hyperosmolarity-sensitive region in its promoter, which includes GATA binding site. Hyperosmolarity decreased the nuclear level of GATA-2, which was inhibited by Go6983 and PKCβ inhibitor. Mutation of GATA binding site decreased the basal promoter activity and inhibited the effect of hyperosmolarity. In contrast, the hyperosmolarity-induced decrease in reporter activity and claudin-2 expression were rescued by over-expression of wild type GATA-2. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay showed that GATA-2 bound to promoter region of claudin-2. These results suggest that hyperosmolarity decreases the expression level of claudin-2 via a decrease in PKCβ-dependent GATA-2 transcriptional activity in renal tubular epithelial cells.
Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) both in coding and non-coding regions govern gene functions prompting differential vulnerability to diseases, heterogeneous response to pharmaceutical regimes and environmental anomalies. These genetic variations, SNPs, may alter an individual׳s susceptibility for alcohol dependence by remodeling DNA-protein interaction patterns in prodynorphin (PDYN) and the κ-opioid receptor (OPRK1) genes. In order to elaborate the underlying molecular mechanism behind these susceptibility differences we used bioinformatics tools to retrieve differential DNA-protein interactions at PDYN and OPRK1 SNPs significantly associated with alcohol dependence. Our results show allele-specific DNA-protein interactions depicting allele-specific mechanisms implicated in differential regulation of gene expression. Several transcription factors, for instance, VDR, RXR-alpha, NFYA, CTF family, USF-1, USF2, ER, AR and predominantly SP family show an allele-specific binding affinity with PDYN gene; likewise, GATA, TBP, AP-1, USF-2, C/EBPbeta, Cart-1 and ER interact with OPRK1 SNPs on intron 2 in an allele-specific manner. In a nutshell, transition of a single nucleotide may modify differential DNA-protein interactions at OPRK1 and PDYN׳s SNPs, significantly associated with pathology that may lead to altered individual vulnerability for alcohol dependence. 
The sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPases (SERCAs) belong to a family of active calcium transport enzymes encoded by the SERCA1, 2, and 3 genes. In this study, we describe the complete structure of the human SERCA2 gene and its 5 -regulatory region. The hSERCA2 gene is located in chromosome 12 position q24.1 in Contig NT_009770.8, spans 70 kb, and is organized in 21 exons intervened by 20 introns. The last two exons of the pre-mRNA produce by alternatively splicing the cardiac/slow-twitch muscle-specific SERCA2a isoform and the ubiquitous SERCA2b isoform. The sequence of the proximal 225-bp regulatory region of the SERCA2 genes is 80% G+C-rich and is conserved among human, rabbit, rat, and mouse species. It contains a TATA-like-box, an E-box/USF sequence, a CAAT-box, four Sp1 binding sites, and a thyroid hormone responsive element (TRE). There are two other conserved regulatory regions located between positions -410 to -661 bp and from -919 to -1410 bp. Among the DNA cis-elements present in these two regulatory regions there are potential binding sites for: GATA-4, -5, -6, Nkx-2.5/Csx, OTF-1, USF, MEF-2, SRF, PPAR/RXR, AP-2, and TREs. Upstream from position -1.5 kb, there is no significant homology among the SERCA2 genes cloned. In addition, the human gene has several repeated sequences mainly of the Alu and L2 type located upstream from position -1.7 kb, spanning in a continuous fashion for more than 40 kb. In this study, we report the cloning of 2.4 kb of 5-regulatory region and demonstrate that the proximal promoter region is sufficient for expression in cardiac myocytes, and the region from -225 to -1232 bp contains regulatory DNA elements which down-regulate the expression of the SERCA2 gene in neonatal cardiomyocytes.
Microsomal epoxide hydrolase (mEH) is a bifunctional protein that plays a central role in the metabolism of numerous xenobiotics as well as mediating the sodium-dependent transport of bile acids into hepatocytes. These compounds are involved in cholesterol homeostasis, lipid digestion, excretion of xenobiotics and the regulation of several nuclear receptors and signaling transduction pathways. Previous studies have demonstrated the critical role of GATA-4, a C/EBPα-NF/Y complex and an HNF-4α/CAR/RXR/PSF complex in the transcriptional regulation of the mEH gene (EPHX1). Studies also identified heterozygous mutations in human EPHX1 that resulted in a 95% decrease in mEH expression levels which was associated with a decrease in bile acid transport and severe hypercholanemia. In the present investigation we demonstrate that EPHX1 transcription is significantly inhibited by two heterozygous mutations observed in the Old Order Amish population that present numerous hypercholanemic subjects in the absence of liver damage suggesting a defect in bile acid transport into the hepatocyte. The identity of the regulatory proteins binding to these sites, established using biotinylated oligonucleotides in conjunction with mass spectrometry was shown to be poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase-1 (PARP-1) bound to the EPHX1 proximal promoter and a linker histone complex, H1.2/Aly, bound to a regulatory intron 1 site. These sites exhibited 71% homology and may represent potential nucleosome positioning domains. The high frequency of the H1.2 site polymorphism in the Amish population results in a potential genetic predisposition to hypercholanemia and in conjunction with our previous studies, further supports the critical role of mEH in mediating bile acid transport into hepatocytes. 
The ability to accurately predict the DNA targets and interacting cofactors of transcriptional regulators from genome-wide data can significantly advance our understanding of gene regulatory networks. NKX2-5 is a homeodomain transcription factor that sits high in the cardiac gene regulatory network and is essential for normal heart development. We previously identified genomic targets for NKX2-5 in mouse HL-1 atrial cardiomyocytes using DNA-adenine methyltransferase identification (DamID). Here, we apply machine learning algorithms and propose a knowledge-based feature selection method for predicting NKX2-5 protein : protein interactions based on motif grammar in genome-wide DNA-binding data. We assessed model performance using leave-one-out cross-validation and a completely independent DamID experiment performed with replicates. In addition to identifying previously described NKX2-5-interacting proteins, including GATA, HAND and TBX family members, a number of novel interactors were identified, with direct protein : protein interactions between NKX2-5 and retinoid X receptor (RXR), paired-related homeobox (PRRX) and Ikaros zinc fingers (IKZF) validated using the yeast two-hybrid assay. We also found that the interaction of RXRα with NKX2-5 mutations found in congenital heart disease (Q187H, R189G and R190H) was altered. These findings highlight an intuitive approach to accessing protein-protein interaction information of transcription factors in DNA-binding experiments.
Although the physiological roles of the individual bile acid synthetic enzymes have been extensively examined, relatively little is known regarding the function of intracellular bile acid-binding proteins. Male L-FABP (liver fatty-acid-binding protein) gene-ablated mice were used to determine a role for L-FABP, the major liver bile acid-binding protein, in bile acid and biliary cholesterol metabolism. First, in control-fed mice L-FABP gene ablation alone increased the total bile acid pool size by 1.5-fold, especially in gall-bladder and liver, but without altering the proportions of bile acid, cholesterol and phospholipid. Loss of liver L-FABP was more than compensated by up-regulation of: other liver cytosolic bile acid-binding proteins [GST (glutathione S-transferase), 3alpha-HSD (3alpha-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase)], key hepatic bile acid synthetic enzymes [CYP7A1 (cholesterol 7alpha-hydroxylase) and CYP27A1 (sterol 27alpha-hydroxylase)], membrane bile acid translocases [canalicular BSEP (bile salt export pump), canalicular MRP2 (multidrug resistance associated protein 2), and basolateral/serosal OATP-1 (organic anion transporting polypeptide 1)], and positive alterations in nuclear receptors [more LXRalpha (liver X receptor alpha) and less SHP (short heterodimer partner)]. Secondly, L-FABP gene ablation reversed the cholesterol-responsiveness of bile acid metabolic parameters such that total bile acid pool size, especially in gall-bladder and liver, was reduced 4-fold, while the mass of biliary cholesterol increased 1.9-fold. The dramatically reduced bile acid levels in cholesterol-fed male L-FABP (-/-) mice were associated with reduced expression of: (i) liver cytosolic bile acid-binding proteins (L-FABP, GST and 3alpha-HSD), (ii) hepatic bile acid synthetic enzymes [CYP7A1, CYP27A1 and SCP-x (sterol carrier protein-x/3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase)] concomitant with decreased positive nuclear receptor alterations (i.e. less LXRalpha and more SHP), and (iii) membrane bile acid transporters (BSEP, MRP2 and OATP-1). These are the first results suggesting a physiological role for the major cytosolic bile acid-binding protein (L-FABP) in influencing liver bile metabolic phenotype and gall-bladder bile lipids of male mice, especially in response to dietary cholesterol.
Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is associated with oxidative stress. We surmised that pharmacologic activation of NF-E2 p45-related factor 2 (Nrf2) using the acetylenic tricyclic bis(cyano enone) TBE-31 would suppress NASH because Nrf2 is a transcriptional master regulator of intracellular redox homeostasis.

                     C57BL/6 mice were fed a high-fat plus fructose (HFFr) or regular chow diet for 16 weeks or 30 weeks, and then treated for the final 6 weeks, while still being fed the same HFFr or regular chow diets, with either TBE-31 or dimethyl sulfoxide vehicle control. Measures of whole-body glucose homeostasis, histologic assessment of liver, and biochemical and molecular measurements of steatosis, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, inflammation, apoptosis, fibrosis, and oxidative stress were performed in livers from these animals.
TBE-31 treatment reversed insulin resistance in HFFr-fed wild-type mice, but not in HFFr-fed Nrf2-null mice. TBE-31 treatment of HFFr-fed wild-type mice substantially decreased liver steatosis and expression of lipid synthesis genes, while increasing hepatic expression of fatty acid oxidation and lipoprotein assembly genes. Also, TBE-31 treatment decreased ER stress, expression of inflammation genes, and markers of apoptosis, fibrosis, and oxidative stress in the livers of HFFr-fed wild-type mice. By comparison, TBE-31 did not decrease steatosis, ER stress, lipogenesis, inflammation, fibrosis, or oxidative stress in livers of HFFr-fed Nrf2-null mice.
Pharmacologic activation of Nrf2 in mice that had already been rendered obese and insulin resistant reversed insulin resistance, suppressed hepatic steatosis, and mitigated against NASH and liver fibrosis, effects that we principally attribute to inhibition of ER, inflammatory, and oxidative stress.
To characterize cholesterol regulation in the liver of patients with Alagille syndrome (AGS).
Serum total cholesterol (TC) and total bile acid (TBA) levels were measured in 23 AGS patients. The expressions of genes involved in cholesterol regulation, including low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR), scavenger receptor class B type I (SR-BI), 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMGCR), cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase (CYP7A1), ATP-binding cassette transporter (ABC) A1, and ABCG1/5/8, were measured in liver tissues from five of these patients. Expression of regulators for these genes, including farnesoid X receptor/small heterodimer partner (SHP), liver X receptor α (LXRα) and mature Sterol regulatory element-binding protein 2 (SREBP2) was measured. The expression of mature SREBP2 protein was also examined.
Serum TC and TBA levels were correlated in the AGS patients. Liver cholesterol was also increased compared with controls, and correlated with bile acid contents. LDLR, SR-BI, HMGCR, and ABCGs mRNA expression were upregulated, while CYP7A1 mRNA expression was downregulated in AGS livers. SHP and LXRα mRNA expression was also increased, but maturation of SREBP2 was not suppressed in the patients.
The major upregulators of liver cholesterol might be increased in AGS patients, indicating an impaired negative feedback mechanism and accelerated liver cholesterol accumulation.
Immune-tolerant chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients awaiting assisted reproduction (AR) are required to initiate antiviral therapy because of laboratory safety concerns. The antiviral therapy in this group has not been well assessed. We sought to explore the efficacy and safety of the combination therapy (COM) of tenofovir (TDF) and telbivudine (LdT).
In this open-label, randomized, controlled study, we enrolled and randomized hepatitis B virus e-antigen (HBeAg)-positive CHB patients awaiting AR into the study COM group and the control (TDF) group. The COM group received combination therapy of TDF and LdT, and the TDF group received a single treatment of TDF. The patients were followed up for at least 48 weeks. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with undetectable HBV DNA level at week 12.
A total of 121 patients were recruited into the COM group (n=60) and the TDF group (n=61). The percentages of patients with undetectable HBV DNA levels were 90.0% (54/60) in the COM group and 67.2% (41/61) (P=0.002) in the TDF group at week 12; the percentages were 96.6% (58/60) in the COM group and 85.2% (52/61) in the TDF group at week 48 (P=0.028), respectively. HBeAg seroconversion occurred in 5/60 (8.3%) patients in the COM group and 2/61 (3.3%) patients in the TDF group at week 48 (P=0.233).
TDF and LdT combination therapy shows a rapid antivirological response in immune-tolerant CHB patients awaiting AR, which provide an alternative for this group at AR centers. However, the HBeAg seroconversion rate is unsatisfactory in the short term.
We previously reported that lead nitrate (LN), an inducer of hepatic tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), downregulated gene expression of cholesterol 7alpha-hydroxylase. Herein, to clarify the role of TNF-alpha in LN-induced downregulation of cholesterol 7alpha-hydroxylase, effects of LN on gene expression of hepatic cholesterol 7alpha-hydroxylase (Cyp7a1) in TNF-alpha-knockout (KO) and TNF-alpha-wild-type (WT) mice were comparatively examined. Gene expression of hepatic Cyp7a1 in both WT and KO mice decreased to less than 5% of the corresponding controls at 6-12 h after treatment with LN (100 mumol/kg body weight, iv). Levels of hepatic TNF-alpha protein in either WT or KO mice were below the detection limit, although expression levels of the TNF-alpha gene markedly increased at 6 h in WT mice by LN treatment, but not in KO mice. In contrast, in both WT and KO mice, levels of hepatic IL-1beta protein, which is known to be a suppressor of the cholesterol 7alpha-hydroxylase gene in hamsters, were significantly increased 3-6 h after LN treatment. Furthermore, LN-induced downregulation of the Cyp7a1 gene did not necessarily result from altered gene expression of hepatic transcription factors, including positive regulators (liver X receptor alpha, retinoid X receptor alpha, fetoprotein transcription factor, and hepatocyte nuclear factor 4alpha) and a negative regulator small heterodimer partner responsible for expression of the Cyp7a1 gene. The present findings indicated that LN-induced downregulation of the Cyp7a1 gene in mice did not necessarily occur through a TNF-alpha-dependent pathway and might occur mainly through an IL-1beta-dependent pathway.
In this work, we report the characterization of a novel liver-specific gene (L-UrdPase), whose expression is regulated by a number of hepatic nuclear receptors (including liver X receptors, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha, farnesoid X receptor, and hepatic nuclear factor-4alpha), which have been shown to be involved in lipid metabolism. L-UrdPase encodes a previously uncharacterized protein with similarity to an intestine-specific uridine phosphorylase. Enzymatic assays confirmed that L-UrdPase has uridine phosphorylase activity. However, L-UrdPase has a highly restricted, nonoverlapping pattern of expression with its intestinal counterpart and is regulated in a distinct manner by several different nuclear receptors. The identification of the liver uridine phosphorylase and its characterization as a target of lipid-sensing nuclear receptors implies the existence of a previously unknown nuclear receptor signaling pathway that links lipid and uridine metabolism.
Three genes, SRY, ANT3, and CSF2RA, were mapped to the bovine Y chromosome (BTAY) by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and/or radiation hybrid (RH) mapping. FISH analysis indicated that the bovine SRY gene maps to the distal region of BTAYq, while ANT3 and CSF2RA are located in the pseudoautosomal region (PAR) of BTAYp and BTAXq. RH mapping with a 7000-rad cattle hamster whole-genome radiation hybrid panel further defined the ANT3 and CSF2RA position in relationship to previously mapped 12 PAR markers, and resulted in a relatively high resolution RH map for the PAR of BTAY.
The sexual phenotype is established in three steps: (1) the sex chromosome constitution; (2) the differentiation of the gonads; and (3) the response of the internal and external genitalia to the hormones produced by the differentiated gonads. Errors that occur at any of these stages can result in defective sexual differentiation. Therefore the investigation of patients with abnormalities of testis development will help elucidate the mechanisms of sex determination and gonadal differentiation. It was in this way that SRY. the primary testis determining gene was identified. De novo mutations in SRY, result in gonadal dysgenesis by disrupting the DNA-binding activity of the SRY protein. However, only 20% of cases of gonadal dysgenesis, are explained by mutations in SRY or its flanking sequences. Therefore, there are several pieces to this puzzle yet to be discovered and it is hoped that mutation analysis of other genes implicated in gonadal development and differentiation may shed some light on aetiology of gonadal dysgenesis in the remaining 80% of cases.
During embryogenesis, most organ rudiments differentiate into only one type of organ and functional mutations are normally lethal for the embryo. However, the indifferent gonad has two options, to form either a testis or an ovary, and mutations of this tissue usually produce sex reversal or sterility which is not lethal for the individual. Therefore, gonadal development serves as an excellent model system for investigating questions of cell fate and organogenesis. The studies of human patients showing different types of sex reversal, in combination with the use of transgenic mice and/or gene targeting disruption, have led to the isolation of several genes important for sex development. These include SRY/Sry, encoding the testis-determining factor, Ftz-F1 encoding steroidogenic factor 1 (SF-1) and Wilms' tumor gene (WT-1). However, the mammalian sex differentiation pathway requires the function of a number of additional genes which we are now trying to identify with the help of mRNA differential display technique.
In mammals, the presence of SRY, the sex-determining gene located on the Y chromosome is required to induce the gonadal anlage to differentiate as a testis, whereas its absence leads to the development of an ovary. We report here the characterization by 5' and 3' RACE analysis of several SRY transcripts which are expressed in the ovine male developing gonads. These transcripts were not detected in any other fetal tissues and were expressed only in the genital portion of the urogenital ridge. The temporal profile of SRY expression analyzed by RT-PCR suggests that in the sheep fetus the role of SRY is not limited to initiating Sertoli cell differentiation as in mice. Indeed, SRY transcripts persist after the full differentiation of the testis. In addition to SRY, other genes are known to be involved in mammalian sex determination: Wilms' tumor gene WT-1, steroidogenic factor gene Ftz-F1 (SF-1) and anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH). We investigated the expression patterns of these genes by RT-PCR during fetal development in sheep gonads. Concerning WT-1 and SF-1, our results are consistent with those described in mice where the earliest expression was detected before the sexual differentiation in both sexes. In male, the ontogenesis of AMH transcription corresponds to the seminiferous cords formation (30 dpc). In female, we have observed the presence of SF-1 transcripts from the undifferentiated stage until birth. In addition, P450 aromatase expression is detected from 30 dpc and is correlated with the presence of 17-beta estradiol in sheep ovary. These data reveal significant differences between rodent and ruminant models concerning the sex-determining pathway.
The study of naturally occurring mutations in humans and induced mutations in mice that cause sex reversal has been instrumental in the cloning and functional analysis of genes involved in gonadal differentiation. Several genes required for this complex developmental process have now been identified. The genes LIM1, WT1 and FTZ-F1 have been demonstrated to be involved in the formation of the gonads prior to their differentiation as testes or ovaries. Subsequent sex-specific gonadal differentiation appears to be mediated by the SRY and SOX9 genes in the testis, and the DAX-1 gene in the ovary.
Because of two successive rounds of tetraploidization at their inception, the vertebrates contain four times more protein-coding genes in their genome than the invertebrates: 60,000 versus 15,000. Consequently, each invertebrate gene has been amplified to the maximum of four paralogous genes in vertebrates: the one-to-four rule. When this rule is applied to genes pertinent to gonadal development and differentiation, the following emerged: (i) Two closely related zinc-finger transcription factor genes in invertebrates have been amplified to two paralogous groups in vertebrates. One consisted of EGR1, EGR2, EGR3 and EGR4, whereas the only known paralogue of the other is WT1, which controls the developmental fate of the entire nephric system, and therefore of gonads. Interestingly, EGR1 and WT1 act as antagonists of each other in nephroblastic cells. (ii) SF-1, which controls the fate of two steroid hormone-producing organs, adrenals and gonads, is descended from the invertebrate Ftz-F1 gene, and its only known paralogue is GCNF-1. (iii) The Y-linked SRY, the mammalian testis-determining gene, is a paralogue neither of SOX3 (SRX) nor of SOX9. Its ancient origin suggests that SRY once became extinct in earlier vertebrates, only to revive itself in the mammalian ancestor. (iv) Inasmuch as four paralogues of one invertebrate nuclear receptor gene have differentiated to receptors of androgen, mineralocoticoid, glucocorticoid and progesterone, there should at most be four paralogous estrogen-receptor genes in the vertebrate genome. It is likely that one of them plays a pivotal role in the estrogen-dependent sex-determining mechanism so commonly found among reptiles, amphibians and fish.
A number of diseases are characterized by defective formation of the intrahepatic bile ducts. In the embryo, hepatoblasts differentiate to cholangiocytes, which give rise to the bile ducts. Here, we investigated duct development in mouse liver and characterized the role of the SRY-related HMG box transcription factor 9 (SOX9).
We identified SOX9 as a new biliary marker and used it in immunostaining experiments to characterize bile duct morphogenesis. The expression of growth factors was determined by in situ hybridization and immunostaining, and their role was studied on cultured hepatoblasts. SOX9 function was investigated by phenotyping mice with a liver-specific inactivation of Sox9.
Biliary tubulogenesis started with formation of asymmetrical ductal structures, lined on the portal side by cholangiocytes and on the parenchymal side by hepatoblasts. When the ducts grew from the hilum to the periphery, the hepatoblasts lining the asymmetrical structures differentiated to cholangiocytes, thereby allowing formation of symmetrical ducts lined only by cholangiocytes. We also provide evidence that transforming growth factor-beta promotes differentiation of the hepatoblasts lining the asymmetrical structures. In the absence of SOX9, the maturation of asymmetrical structures into symmetrical ducts was delayed. This was associated with abnormal expression of CCAAT/Enhancer Binding Protein alpha and Homolog of Hairy/Enhancer of Split-1, as well as of the transforming growth factor-beta receptor type II, which are regulators of biliary development.
Our results suggest that biliary development proceeds according to a new mode of tubulogenesis characterized by transient asymmetry and whose timing is controlled by SOX9.
The features and functions of prostatic neuroendocrine (NE) cells remain ill-defined. Neuroendocrine differentiation (NED) in adenocarcinoma of the human prostate (CaP) is associated with more aggressive disease, but the underlying mediators are poorly understood. We examined these issues in transgenic mice that utilize regulatory elements from the cryptdin-2 gene (Defcr2) to express simian virus 40 large T antigen (TAg) in prostatic NE cells. CR2-TAg mice develop prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia at 8 weeks of age, 1 week after the onset of TAg expression. An invasive phase follows 2-4 weeks later, with lymph node, liver, lung, brain, and bone metastases appearing within 16 weeks. DNA microarray studies revealed 122 mRNAs that were increased &gt;/=2-fold in duplicate assays of 16-week-old CR2-TAg versus normal prostates. Thirty two transcripts encode proteins associated with neurons and endocrine cells (e.g. basic helix loop helix, SRY-related high mobility group box and sine-oculis homeobox transcription factors, Hu RNA-binding proteins, neuronatin, Racgap1, collapsin response mediator protein-1, synaptotagmin-1, proprotein convertase, and secretogranins). Follow-up studies of candidate mediators and biomarkers of differentiation/growth in the microarray data set involved real time quantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR assays of laser capture microdissected NE cells from CR2-TAg prostates plus liver metastases, and immunohistochemical comparisons of transgenic mouse prostates and 35 human CaP samples. Our findings include (a) expression of the bHLH mouse achaete-scute homolog (mASH1) in normal and CR2-TAg NE cells and foci of NED in human CaP, (b) glutamic acid decarboxylase and its product (gamma-aminobutyric acid) in neoplastic NE cells juxtaposed next to cohorts of normal gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor expressing secretory cells (a potential route for paracrine interactions between these two epithelial lineages), and (c) aromatic l-amino-acid decarboxylase, but not its dopamine/serotonin products, in CR2-TAg NE cells and NED. These results underscore the value of CR2-TAg mice for characterizing normal NE cell biology and tumorigenesis.
Estrogen (17beta-estradiol, E2)-deficient aromatase knockout (ArKO) mice develop Sertoli and Leydig cells at puberty. We hypothesized that estrogen, directly or indirectly, regulates genes responsible for somatic cell differentiation and steroidogenesis. ArKO ovaries expressed estrogen receptors alpha and beta, and LH receptor, indices of estrogen responsiveness in the ovary. Wild-type (Wt) and ArKO mice received either E2 or placebo for 3 wk, from 7-10 wk of age. E2 decreased serum FSH and LH and increased uterine weights of 10-wk-old ArKO mice. We measured mRNA expression of Sertoli cell, Sry-like HMG box protein 9 (Sox9); three upstream transcription factors, liver receptor homolog-1 (Lrh-1), steroidogenic factor 1, and dosage-sensitive sex reversal adrenal hypoplasia congenital critical region on the X chromosome gene 1; and one downstream factor, Müllerian-inhibiting substance. Placebo-treated ArKO ovaries have increased Sox9 (15-fold; P &lt; 0.001), Müllerian-inhibiting substance (2.9-fold), Lrh-1 (7.7-fold), and dosage-sensitive sex reversal adrenal hypoplasia congenital critical region on the X chromosome gene 1 (12-fold) expression compared with Wt at 10 wk. Steroidogenic factor 1 was similar to Wt. Consistent with increased serum T levels and Leydig cells in their ovaries, placebo-treated ArKO ovaries had increased 17alpha-hydroxylase, 17beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type-3, and 17beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type-1 expression compared with Wt at 10 wk. E2 treatment for 3 wk improved the ovarian phenotype, decreased development of Sertoli cells, decreased the expression of Sox9, Lrh-1, and the steroidogenic enzymes in ArKO ovaries, and induced ovulation in some cases. In conclusion, the expression of the genes regulating somatic cell differentiation is directly or indirectly responsive to estrogen.
Generation of surrogate β-cells is the need of the day to compensate the short supply of islets for transplantation to diabetic patients requiring daily shots of insulin. Over the years several sources of stem cells have been claimed to cater to the need of insulin producing cells. These include human embryonic stem cells, induced pluripotent stem cells, human perinatal tissues such as amnion, placenta, umbilical cord and postnatal tissues involving adipose tissue, bone marrow, blood monocytes, cord blood, dental pulp, endometrium, liver, labia minora dermis-derived fibroblasts and pancreas. Despite the availability of such heterogonous sources, there is no substantial breakthrough in selecting and implementing an ideal source for generating large number of stable insulin producing cells. Although the progress in derivation of β-cell like cells from embryonic stem cells has taken a greater leap, their application is limited due to controversy surrounding the destruction of human embryo and immune rejection. Since multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells are free of ethical and immunological complications, they could provide unprecedented opportunity as starting material to derive insulin secreting cells. The main focus of this review is to discuss the merits and demerits of MSCs obtained from human peri- and post-natal tissue sources to yield abundant glucose responsive insulin producing cells as ideal candidates for prospective stem cell therapy to treat diabetes. 
THO (Suppressors of the transcriptional defects of hpr1 delta by overexpression) complex 5 (THOC5), an mRNA export protein, is involved in the expression of only 1% of all genes. Using an interferon inducible knockout mouse system, we have previously shown that THOC5 is an essential element in the maintenance of hematopoietic stem cells and cytokine-mediated hematopoiesis in adult mice. Here we interrogate THOC5 function in cell differentiation beyond the hematopoietic system and study pathological changes caused by THOC5 deficiency.
To examine whether THOC5 plays a role in general differentiation processes, we generated tamoxifen inducible THOC5 knockout mice. We show here that the depletion of THOC5 impaired not only hematopoietic differentiation, but also differentiation and self renewal of the gut epithelium. Depletion of the THOC5 gene did not cause pathological alterations in liver or kidney. We further show that THOC5 is indispensable for processing of mRNAs induced by Wnt (wingless/integrated) signaling which play key roles in epithelial cell differentiation/proliferation. A subset of Wnt target mRNAs, SRY-box containing gene 9 (Sox9), and achaete-scute complex homolog 2 (Ascl2), but not Fibronectin 1 (Fn1), were down-regulated in THOC5 knockout intestinal cells. The down-regulated Wnt target mRNAs were able to bind to THOC5. Furthermore, pathological alterations in the gastrointestinal tract induced translocation of intestinal bacteria and caused sepsis in mice. The bacteria translocation may cause Toll-like receptor activation. We identified one of the Toll-like receptor inducible genes, prostaglandin-endoperoxidase synthase 2 (Ptgs2 or COX2) transcript as THOC5 target mRNA.
THOC5 is indispensable for processing of only a subset of mRNAs, but plays a key role in processing of mRNAs inducible by Wnt signals. Furthermore, THOC5 is dispensable for general mRNA export in terminally differentiated organs, indicating that multiple mRNA export pathways exist. These data imply that THOC5 may be a useful tool for studying intestinal stem cells, for modifying the differentiation processes and for cancer therapy.
The Hippo pathway regulates the down-stream target Yes-associated protein (YAP) to maintain organ homeostasis, which is commonly inactivated in many types of cancers. However, how cell adhesion dysregulates the Hippo pathway activating YAP oncogene in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains unclear. Our findings demonstrate that α2β1 integrin (but not other β1 integrins) expressed in HCC cells, after binding to collagen extracellular matrix, could inhibit MST1 kinase phosphorylation and activate YAP pro-oncogenic activities. Knockdown of integrin α2 gene (ITGA2) suppressed YAP targeted gene expression in vitro. α2β1 and collagen binding resulted in suppressing Hippo signaling of mammalian sterile 20-like kinase 1 (MST1) and Large tumor suppressor homolog 1 (LATS1) with concomitant activation of YAP-mediated connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) gene expression. In vitro kinase assay showed that MST1 is an immediate downstream target of integrin α2 with S1180 residue as the critical phosphorylation site. Clinical correlational analysis using a gene expression dataset of 228 HCC tumors revealed that ITGA2 expression was significantly associated with tumor progression, and co-expression with YAP targeted genes (AXL receptor tyrosine kinase, CTGF, cyclin D1, glypican 3, insulin like growth factor 1 receptor, and SRY-box 4) correlated with survivals of HCC patients. In conclusion, α2β1 integrin activation through cellular adhesion impacts the Hippo pathway in solid tumors and modulates MST1-YAP signaling cascade. Targeting integrin α2 holds promises for treating YAP-positive HCC.
Mammals have two genes (SRY and DMT1) for testis formation-androgenesis, an anti-testis gene, DAX1, an anti-Müllerian duct hormone, and steroid sex hormones. Drosophila uses the sex-lethal, transformer, and doublesex genes for sexual differentation and is supposed to lack sex hormones. However, the statement that insects do not have sex hormones loses much of its credibility if one considers (1) the classical endocrinological work on sexual differentiation in the firefly Lampyris and in the hevea tussock moth Orgyia; (2) the recent identification of an androgenic hormone and its role in sex determination in the isopod Armadillidium; (3) the similarity between steroidogenic factor 1 (SF-1) of mammals and fushi tarazu factor 1 (FTZ-F1) of Drosophila; and (4) the steroidogenic effect of gonadotropins secreted by the brain of female locusts and mosquitoes and of male gypsy moth. In our model, based on data from the literature, ecdysone, when present in high concentrations, might function as an androgenic sex steroid. It is also the precursor of 20-OH-ecdysone, which is the moulting hormone of insects, and in vitellogenic females of many species, the counterpart of estrogens as well. Other gender-specific hormones are likely to exist in the brain-gonad axis.
ff1d is a novel zebrafish FTZ-F1 gene with sequence characteristics indicating similar basic regulatory mechanisms as the previously characterized ff1 based on the presence of an FTZ-F1 box in the DNA binding domain and an interactive domain (I-Box) and an AF-2 in the ligand binding domain. The highest sequence similarity was found between ff1d and ff1b (NR5A4), a gene previously shown to be a functional homolog to the steroidogenic factor 1 (SF-1). The expression pattern of ff1d was comparable to ff1b both in brain and gonads in adults and in the pituitary and interrenal cells in embryos. SF-1 is crucial in mammalian steroidogenesis and in sex determination by regulating the anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH). In fish, AMH has not been described previously. In this study, we cloned a partial zebrafish AMH. AMH was detected in growing oocytes, the ovarian follicular layer and testicular Sertoli cells, similar to the mammalian pattern, suggesting a conserved role between zebrafish and mammalian AMH. Teleosts lack a gene homolog to SRY, which constitute the universal testis-determining factor in mammalian sex determination. Comparison of sequences and expression patterns indicate that ff1d is a new candidate for sex determination and differentiation in a way similar to SF-1, possibly involving AMH.
Because of two successive rounds of tetraploidization at their inception, the vertebrates contain four times more protein-coding genes in their genome than the invertebrates: 60,000 vs. 15,000. Consequently, each invertebrate gene has been amplified to the maximum of four paralogous genes in vertebrates: the one-to-four rule. When this rule is applied to genes pertinent to gonadal development and differentiation, the following emerged: (i) Two closely related zinc-finger transcription factor genes in invertebrates have been amplified to two paralogous groups in vertebrates. One consisted of EGR1, EGR2, EGR3 and EGR4, whereas the only known paralogue of the other is WT1, which controls the developmental fate of the entire nephric system, and therefore of gonads. Interestingly, EGR1 and WT1 act as antagonists of each other in nephroblastic cells. (ii) SF-1, which controls the fate of two steroid hormone-producing organs, adrenals and gonads, is descended from the invertebrate Ftz-F1 gene, and its only known paralogue is GCNF-1. (iii) The Y-linked SRY, the mammalian testis-determining gene, is a paralogue neither of SOX3 (SRX) nor of SOX9. Its ancient origin suggests that SRY once became extinct in earlier vertebrates, only to revive itself in the mammalian ancestor. (iv) Inasmuch as four paralogues of one invertebrate nuclear receptor gene have differentiated to receptors of androgen, mineralocorticoid, glucocorticoid and progesterone, there should at most be four paralogous estrogen-receptor genes in the vertebrate genome. It is likely that one of them plays a pivotal role in the estrogen-dependent sex-determining mechanism so commonly found among reptiles, amphibians and fish.
Chinese mitten crab (Eriocheir sinensis) is one of the most commercially important aquaculture species in China. The androgenic gland (AG) of crustaceans plays pivotal roles in the regulation of male differentiation and in maintaining the male sexual characteristics. In order to reveal related mechanisms in AG, we compared transcriptomes of AG between proliferation and secretion phase. A total of 72,000 unigenes and 4,027 differentially expressed genes were obtained. Gene ontology enrichment analysis indicated that biological processes and metabolic pathways related to protein synthesis and secretion such as transcription, translation, and signal transduction were significantly enriched. Critical genes such as IAG, SXL, TRA-2, SRY, FTZ-F1, FOXL2, and FEM-1 were identified and potentially involved in maintaining the testis development and spermatogenesis. Ribosomes pathway revealed the cause of insulin-like androgenic gland hormone secretion increase. Three insulin-like receptors were thought to be associated with growth and spermatogenesis. In the neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction pathway, the expression of octopamine receptor, 5-HT receptor 1, and melatonin receptor was significantly changed, which revealed the key regulation mechanism of aggressive and mating behavior of males. Comparative transcriptome analysis provided new insights into the genome-wide molecular mechanisms of AG development and the regulatory mechanisms of male development.
We aimed to identify the genetic cause in a cohort of 11 unrelated cases and two sisters with 46,XX SRY-negative (ovo)testicular disorders of sex development (DSD).
Whole-exome sequencing (n = 9), targeted resequencing (n = 4), and haplotyping were performed. Immunohistochemistry of sex-specific markers was performed on patients' gonads. The consequences of mutation were investigated using luciferase assays, localization studies, and RNA-seq.
We identified a novel heterozygous NR5A1 mutation, c.274C&gt;T p.(Arg92Trp), in three unrelated patients. The Arg92 residue is highly conserved and located in the Ftz-F1 region, probably involved in DNA-binding specificity and stability. There were no consistent changes in transcriptional activation or subcellular localization. Transcriptomics in patient-derived lymphocytes showed upregulation of MAMLD1, a direct NR5A1 target previously associated with 46,XY DSD. In gonads of affected individuals, ovarian FOXL2 and testicular SRY-independent SOX9 expression observed.
We propose NR5A1, previously associated with 46,XY DSD and 46,XX primary ovarian insufficiency, as a novel gene for 46,XX (ovo)testicular DSD. We hypothesize that p.(Arg92Trp) results in decreased inhibition of the male developmental pathway through downregulation of female antitestis genes, thereby tipping the balance toward testicular differentiation in 46,XX individuals. In conclusion, our study supports a role for NR5A1 in testis differentiation in the XX gonad.Genet Med 19 4, 367-376.
Teleost fish are characterized by exceptionally high levels of brain estrogen biosynthesis when compared to the brains of other vertebrates or to the ovaries of the same fish. Goldfish (Carassius auratus) and zebrafish (Danio rerio) have utility as complementary models for understanding the molecular basis and functional significance of exaggerated neural estrogen biosynthesis. Multiple cytochrome P450 aromatase (P450arom) cDNAs that derive from separate gene loci (cyp19a and cyp19b) are differentially expressed in brain (P450aromB&gt;A) and ovary (P450aromA&gt;B) and have a different developmental program (B&gt;A) and response to estrogen upregulation (B only). As measured by increased P450aromB mRNA, a functional estrogen response system is first detected 24-48 h post-fertilization (hpf), consistent with the onset of estrogen receptor (ER) expression (alpha, beta, and gamma). The 5'-flanking region of the cyp19b gene has a TATA box, two estrogen response elements (EREs), an ERE half-site (ERE1/2), a nerve growth factor inducible-B protein (NGFI-B)/Nur77 responsive element (NBRE) binding site, and a sequence identical to the zebrafish GATA-2 gene neural specific enhancer. The cyp19a promoter region has TATA and CAAT boxes, a steroidogenic factor-1 (SF-1) binding site, and two aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR)/AhR nuclear translocator factor (ARNT) binding motifs. Both genes have multiple potential SRY/SOX binding sites (16 and 8 in cyp19b and cyp19a, respectively). Luciferase reporters have basal promoter activity in GH3 cells, but differences (a&gt;b) are opposite to fish pituitary (b&gt;a). When microinjected into fertilized zebrafish eggs, a cyp19b promoter-driven green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter (but not cyp19a) is expressed in neurons of 30-48 hpf embryos, most prominently in retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) and their projections to optic tectum. Further studies are required to identify functionally relevant cis-elements and cellular factors, and to determine the regulatory role of estrogen in neurodevelopment.
Subtle caspase activation is associated with the differentiation of several myeloid lineages. A tightly orchestrated dance between caspase-3 activation and the chaperone HSP70 that migrates to the nucleus to protect the master regulator GATA-1 from cleavage transiently occurs in basophilic erythroblasts and may prepare nucleus and organelle expel that occurs at the terminal phase of erythroid differentiation. A spatially restricted activation of caspase-3 occurs in maturing megakaryocytes to promote proplatelet maturation and platelet shedding in the bloodstream. In a situation of acute platelet need, caspase-3 could be activated in response to IL-1α and promote megakaryocyte rupture. In peripheral blood monocytes, colony-stimulating factor-1 provokes the formation of a molecular platform in which caspase-8 is activated, which downregulates nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) activity and activates downstream caspases whose target fragments such as those generated by nucleophosmin (NPM1) cleavage contribute to the generation of resting macrophages. Human monocytes secrete mature IL-1β in response to lipopolysaccharide through an alternative inflammasome activation that involves caspase-8, a pathway that does not lead to cell death. Finally, active caspase-3 is part of the proteases contained in secretory granules of mast cells. Many questions remain on how these proteases are activated in myeloid cell lineages, which target proteins are cleaved, whereas other are protected from proteolysis, the precise role of cleaved proteins in cell differentiation and functions, and the link between these non-apoptotic functions of caspases and the death of these diverse cell types. Better understanding of these functions may generate therapeutic strategies to control cytopenias or modulate myeloid cell functions in various pathological situations.
Increased expression of fetal hemoglobin (HbF) may ameliorate the clinical course of hemoglobinopathies. Hydroxyurea (HU) is the only inducer approved for the treatment of these diseases able to stimulate HbF production but patients' response is highly variable indicating the utility of the identification of pharmacogenomic biomarkers in order to predict pharmacological treatment efficacy. To date few studies to evaluate the role of genetic determinants in HU response have been conducted showing contradictory results. In this study we analyzed BCL11A, GATA-1, KLF-1 genes and γ-globin promoter in 60 alleles from 30 hemoglobinopathies patients under HU treatment to assess the role of these markers in HU response. We did not find any association between these genetic determinants and HU response. Before treatment started, the same patients were analyzed in vitro using liquid erythroid cultures in a test able to predict their response to HU. The results of our analysis confirm the absence of pharmacogenomic biomarker associated to HU response indicating that, the quantification of γ-globin mRNA fold increase remains the only method able to predict in vivo patients response to the drug.
The intrinsic basis of cancer-related anemia (CRA) is erythropoiesis disorder, which is a common complication of cancer and exerts a negative influence on the life quality of cancer patients. Cell therapy using mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) is considered as a promising method in cancer treatment. Furthermore, MSCs have been used to cure few type of anemia and be considered as a potential strategy to recover anemia radically. However, none reports its application in CRA treatment. In CRA model mice, we found that the number of lin-c-kit+Sca-1+ and Sca-1+ MSCs was decreased. And CRA resulted in an increased number of proerythroblasts and basophilic erythroblasts and decreased number of orthochromatic erythroblasts. Furthermore, in CRA model mice transplanted with Sca-1+ MSCs and MSCs, the levels of red blood cell count and Hb in peripheral blood were obviously increased. And the accumulation of proerythroblasts and basophilic erythroblasts was inhibited. In addition, the expression patterns of GATA-1 and GATA-2, which is pivotal to anemia, were remarkably recovered. Our results demonstrated that either MSCs or its subpopulation could effectively recover CRA erythropoiesis through GATA-1/GATA-2 signaling, which outstrips the traditional symptomatic therapy.
Heme oxygenase 1 (HMOX1) degrades heme into biliverdin, which is subsequently converted to bilirubin by biliverdin reductase (BVRa or BVRb) in a manner analogous to the classic anti-oxidant glutathione-recycling pathway. To gain a better understanding of the potential antioxidant roles the BVR enzymes may play during development, the spatiotemporal expression and transcriptional regulation of zebrafish hmox1a, bvra and bvrb were characterized under basal conditions and in response to pro-oxidant exposure. All three genes displayed spatiotemporal expression patterns consistent with classic hematopoietic progenitors during development. Transient knockdown of Nrf2a did not attenuate the ability to detect bvra or bvrb by ISH, or alter spatial expression patterns in response to cadmium exposure. While hmox1a:mCherry fluorescence was documented within the intermediate cell mass, a transient location of primitive erythrocyte differentiation, expression was not fully attenuated in Nrf2a morphants, but real-time RT-PCR demonstrated a significant reduction in hmox1a expression. Furthermore, Gata-1 knockdown did not attenuate hmox1a:mCherry fluorescence. However, while there was a complete loss of detection of bvrb expression by ISH at 24hpf, bvra expression was greatly attenuated but still detectable in Gata-1 morphants. In contrast, 96 hpf Gata-1 morphants displayed increased bvra and bvrb expression within hematopoietic tissues. Finally, temporal expression patterns of enzymes involved in the generation and maintenance of NADPH were consistent with known changes in the cellular redox state during early zebrafish development. Together, these data suggest that Gata-1 and Nrf2a play differential roles in regulating the heme degradation enzymes during an early developmental period of heightened cellular stress.
GATA transcription factors regulate an array of genes important in cell proliferation and differentiation. Here we report the identification of regulator of G protein signaling 4 (RGS4) as a novel target for GATA-6 transcription factor. Although three sites (a, b, c) within the proximal region of rabbit RGS4 promoter for GATA transcription factors were predicted by bioinformatics analysis, only GATA-a site (16 bp from the core TATA box) is essential for RGS4 transcriptional regulation. RT-PCR analysis demonstrated that only GATA-6 was highly expressed in rabbit colonic smooth muscle cells but GATA-4/6 were expressed in cardiac myocytes and GATA-1/2/3 expressed in blood cells. Adenovirus-mediated expression of GATA-6 but not GATA-1 significantly increased the constitutive and IL-1β-induced mRNA expression of the endogenous RGS4 in colonic smooth muscle cells. IL-1β stimulation induced GATA-6 nuclear translocation and increased GATA-6 binding to RGS4 promoter. These data suggest that GATA factor could affect G protein signaling through regulating RGS4 expression, and GATA signaling may develop as a future therapeutic target for RGS4-related diseases.
Major advances have been recently made in understanding the molecular determinants of dyserythropoiesis, particularly due to recent works in β-thalassemia. The purpose of this review is devoted to underline the role of some proteins recently evidenced in the field, that may be new alternative therapeutic targets in the near future to alleviate different types of anemia. Areas covered: This review covers the contemporary aspects of some proteins involved in various types of dyserythropoiesis, including the transcriptional factor GATA-1 and its protective chaperone HSP70, but also cytokines of the transforming growth factor beta (TFG-β) family, TGF-β1 and GDF-11, and hormones as erythroferrone. It will be not exhaustive, but based on major recent published works from the literature in the past three years. Expert commentary: Sotatercept and lustatercept, two activin receptor II ligand traps that block GDF-11, are candidate drugs providing therapeutic hope in different types of ineffective erythropoiesis, including myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and β-thalassemia. Furthermore, a new concept emerges to consider erythroid lineage in the bone marrow as an endocrine gland.
To explore the influence of hypoxia-inducible factor-2 αlpha (HIF-2α) on the expression of erythroid-specific transcription factor GATA-1 in bone marrow CD71(+) cells of rat model with high altitude polycythemia (HAPC).
A total of 48 male SD rats were selected and randomly divided into normal control group and HAPC group. HAPC model was established at an altitude of 4 300 meters in the natural environment and verified by bone marrow cell classification and counting, hematologic parameters and serum EPO detection. Bone marrow CD71 (+) cells were separated by a combination of methods with density gradient centrifugation and magnetic activated cell sorting. The changes of expression level of HIF-2α, GATA-1 mRNA and proteins were detected by Q-PCR and Western blot. CD71 (+) cells were cultured under hypoxia condition and transfected with selected optimal HIF- 2α shRNAi3 for 96 h. And the expression level of HIF-2α and GATA-1 mRNA and proteins were detected by Q- PCR and Western blot.
The results of bone marrow cell counts, the hematologic parameters and the serum EPO content showed that the HAPC rat model was successfully established. The expression of HIF-2α and GATA-1 mRNA and protein in bone marrow CD71(+) cells of HAPC group was higher than that in control group (P&lt;0.05). And HIF-2α and GATA-1 of HAPC group were positively correlated at the expression levels of mRNA and protein, respectively (r=0.923, P&lt;0.01; r=0.838, P&lt;0.01). However, the expression of HIF-2α and GATA-1 mRNA and protein in HAPC group was significantly lower than that in control groups after interfered by HIF-2α shRNAi3 for 96 h (P&lt;0.05).
The effect of HIF-2α on GATA-1 expression may be correlated with the pathogenesis of HAPC.
Since the highly conserved exosome complex mediates the degradation and processing of multiple classes of RNAs, it almost certainly controls diverse biological processes. How this post-transcriptional RNA-regulatory machine impacts cell fate decisions and differentiation is poorly understood. Previously, we demonstrated that exosome complex subunits confer an erythroid maturation barricade, and the erythroid transcription factor GATA-1 dismantles the barricade by transcriptionally repressing the cognate genes. While dissecting requirements for the maturation barricade in Mus musculus, we discovered that the exosome complex is a vital determinant of a developmental signaling transition that dictates proliferation/amplification versus differentiation. Exosome complex integrity in erythroid precursor cells ensures Kit receptor tyrosine kinase expression and stem cell factor/Kit signaling, while preventing responsiveness to erythropoietin-instigated signals that promote differentiation. Functioning as a gatekeeper of this developmental signaling transition, the exosome complex controls the massive production of erythroid cells that ensures organismal survival in homeostatic and stress contexts.
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small endogenous non-coding regulatory RNAs that control mRNAs post-transcriptionally. Several mouse stem cells miRNAs are cloned differentially regulated in different hematopoietic lineages, suggesting their possible role in hematopoietic lineage differentiation. Recent studies have shown that specific miRNAs such as Mir-451 have key roles in erythropoiesis.
In this experimental study, murine embryonic stem cells (mESCs) were infected with lentiviruses containing pCDH-Mir-451. Erythroid differentiation was assessed based on the expression level of transcriptional factors (Gata-1, Klf-1, Epor) and hemoglobin chains (α, β, γ , ε and ζ) genes using quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and presence of erythroid surface antigens (TER-119 and CD235a) using flow cytometery. Colony-forming unit (CFU) assay was also on days 14thand 21thafter transduction.
Mature Mir-451 expression level increased by 3.434-fold relative to the untreated mESCs on day 4 after transduction (P&lt;0.001). Mir-451 up-regulation correlated with the induction of transcriptional factor (Gata-1, Klf-1, Epor) and hemoglobin chain (α, β, γ, ε and ζ) genes in mESCs (P&lt;0.001) and also showed a strong correlation with presence of CD235a and Ter- 119 markers in these cells (13.084and 13.327-fold increse, respectively) (P&lt;0.05). Moreover, mESCs treated with pCDH-Mir-451 showed a significant raise in CFU-erythroid (CFU-E) colonies (5.2-fold) compared with untreated control group (P&lt;0.05).
Our results showed that Mir-451 up-regulation strongly induces erythroid differentiation and maturation of mESCs. Overexpression of Mir-451 may have the potential to produce artificial red blood cells (RBCs) without the presence of any stimulatory cytokines.
The aim of the present study was to investigate regulatory relationships among hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α), microRNA and erythroid transcription factors. K562 cells were transfected with HIF-1α knockout or with overexpression lentivirus of plasmid (MOI 10). The cells were divided into 3 groups: the negative control, overexpressing and interference groups. The cells were cultured under normoxia and hypoxia. Expression of miR-17*, miR-363 and miR-574-5p in the three groups was determined by quantitative PCR. Expression levels of erythroid transcription factor mRNAs such as GATA-1/GATA-2 and nuclear factor‑erythroid 2 (NF-E2) were measured using RT-qPCR while the protein expression was studied using western blot analysis. Under normoxia or hypoxia, the levels of miR-17*, miR-363 and miR‑574-5p in the overexpression group were higher than those in the other groups. Differences were statistically significant (P&lt;0.05). Under hypoxia, the level of miR-363 in the interference group was less than that in the negative control group and difference was statistically significant (P&lt;0.05). The level of GATA-1 mRNA in the overexpression group was higher than that in the negative control group, however, in the interference group the level was lower than that in the overexpression group under both normoxic and hypoxic conditions. The level of GATA-2 mRNA in the interference group was higher than that in other two groups under normoxic or hypoxic conditions. The NF-E2 mRNA was reversely related to GATA-2. The levels of HIF-1α, GATA-1 and NF-E2 mRNAs in the negative control under hypoxia were higher than those of normoxia. The level of HIF-1α mRNA in the overexpression group in hypoxia was lower than that in normoxia, while the GATA-1 and GATA-2 mRNA showed a reverse association. The levels of HIF-1α and GATA-2 mRNA in the interference group under hypoxia were higher compared to those of normoxia. Differences were statistically significant (P&lt;0.05). Western blot results suggested that GATA-1, GATA-2 and NF-E2 protein expression correlated with changes in their respective mRNA transcription levels. The results therefore suggested that GATA-l and miR-363 were involved in the regulation of hematopoiesis via the HIF-1α pathway in K562 cells under hypoxic condition. The hsa-miR-17* and hsa-miR‑574-5p were not entirely dependent on HIF-1α, suggesting possible complex regulatory mechanisms involved in hypoxia. 
Recent years have seen increasing recognition of a subgroup of inherited platelet function disorders which are due to defects in transcription factors that are required to regulate megakaryopoiesis and platelet production. Thus, germline mutations in the genes encoding the haematopoietic transcription factors RUNX1, GATA-1, FLI1, GFI1b and ETV6 have been associated with both quantitative and qualitative platelet abnormalities, and variable bleeding symptoms in the affected patients. Some of the transcription factor defects are also associated with an increased predisposition to haematologic malignancies (RUNX1, ETV6), abnormal erythropoiesis (GATA-1, GFI1b, ETV6) and immune dysfunction (FLI1). The persistence of MYH10 expression in platelets is a surrogate marker for FLI1 and RUNX1 defects. Characterisation of the transcription factor defects that give rise to platelet function disorders, and of the genes that are differentially regulated as a result, are yielding insights into the roles of these genes in platelet formation and function.
Primary myelofibrosis (PMF) is a Philadelphia chromosome negative myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN) with adverse prognosis and is associated with bone marrow fibrosis and extramedullary hematopoiesis. Even though the discovery of the Janus kinase 2 (JAK2), thrombopoietin receptor (MPL) and calreticulin (CALR) mutations have brought new insights into the complex pathogenesis of MPNs, the etiology of fibrosis is not well understood. Furthermore, since JAK2 inhibitors do not lead to reversal of fibrosis further understanding of the biology of fibrotic process is needed for future therapeutic discovery. Transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) is implicated as an important cytokine in pathogenesis of bone marrow fibrosis. Various mouse models have been developed and have established the role of TGF-β in the pathogenesis of fibrosis. Understanding the molecular alterations that lead to TGF-β mediated effects on bone marrow microenvironment can uncover newer therapeutic targets against myelofibrosis. Inhibition of the TGF-β pathway in conjunction with other therapies might prove useful in the reversal of bone marrow fibrosis in PMF. 
To explore the influence of GATA-1 on expression of EpoR in bone marrow CD71+ cells of rat model with high altitude polycythemia (HAPC).
Forty-eight male SD rats were randomly divided into normal control and HAPC model group. HAPC model was established at the altitude of 4 300 meters in the natural environment, and verified by bone marrow cell counts and hematological parameters. Myeloid CD71+ cells were separated by the density gradient centrifugation combined with magnetic activated cell sorting. The expression of EpoR on cell membrane was detected by flow cytometry and cell immunofluorescence. The expression changes of GATA-1 and EpoR mRNA and protein were detected by Q-PCR and Western blot, respectively. CD71+ cells were cultured under normoxia and hypoxia, respectively. After transfection for 96 h, the optimal interference sequence GATA-1 shRNA1 was selected. And the mRNA and protein expression level of GATA-1 and EpoR were detected by Q-PCR and Western blot respectively.
The animal model with HAPC was established successfully and comfirmed by the bone marrow cell counting and the hematologic parameters in comparison with that of the normal control. EpoR expression on the myeloid CD71+ cell membrane in HAPC group was significantly higher than that in normal control (P&lt;0.05). The expression of GATA-1 and EpoR in myeloid CD71+ cells of HAPC group was higher than that in control group (P&lt;0.05). The mRNA and protein expression of GATA-1 and EpoR in two groups positively correlated (control group, r=0.929, P&lt;0.01, r=0.802, P&lt;0.05; HAPC group, r=0.822, P&lt;0.05, r=0.839, P&lt;0.01). However, the mRNA and protein expression of EpoR at normoxia and hypoxia was significantly lower than that in negative control group after interfernce with GATA-1 shRNA1 for 96 h (P&lt;0.05). And the expression of GATA-1 and EpoR under hypoxia was higher than that in normoxia.
The effect of GATA-1 on EpoR expression may be correlated with the pathogenesis of HAPC.
CCR3 is a chemokine receptor that mediates the accumulation of allergic inflammatory cells, including eosinophils and Th2 cells, at inflamed sites. The regulatory sequence of the CCR3 gene, contains two Runt-related transcription factor (RUNX) 1 sites and two PU.1 sites, in addition to a functional GATA site for transactivation of the CCR3 gene. In the present study, we examined the effects of the cis-acting elements of RUNX1 and PU.1 on transcription of the gene in EoL-1 eosinophilic cells and Jurkat T cells, both of which expressed functional surface CCR3 and these two transcription factors. Introduction of RUNX1 siRNA or PU.1 siRNA resulted in a modest decrease in CCR3 reporter activity in both cell types, compared with transfection of GATA-1 siRNA. Cotransfection of the two siRNAs led to inhibition in an additive manner. EMSA analysis showed that RUNX1, in particular, bound to its binding motifs. Mutagenesis analysis revealed that all point mutants lacking RUNX1- and PU.1-binding sites exhibited reduced reporter activities. These results suggest that RUNX1 and PU.1 participate in transcriptional regulation of the CCR3 gene. 
Lentivirus vectors are presently the favorite vehicles for therapeutic gene transfer in hematopoietic cells. Nonetheless, these vectors integrate randomly throughout the genome, exhibiting variegation of transgene expression due to the spreading of heterochromatin into the vector sequences. Moreover, the cis-regulatory elements harbored by the vector could disturb the proper transcription of resident genes neighboring the integration site. The incorporation of chromatin insulators in flanking position to the transferred unit can alleviate both the above-mentioned dangerous effects, due to the insulator-specific barrier and enhancer-blocking activities. In this study, we report the valuable properties of the sea urchin-derived sns5 insulator in improving the expression efficiency of a lentivirus vector integrated in the mammalian erythroid genome. We show that these results neither reflect an intrinsic sns5 enhancer activity nor rely on the recruitment of the erythroid-specific GATA-1 factor to sns5. Furthermore, by using the Chromosome Conformation Capture technology, we report that a single copy of the sns5-insulated vector is specifically organized into an independent chromatin loop at the provirus locus. Our results not only provide new clues concerning the molecular mechanism of sns5 function in the erythroid genome but also reassure the use of sns5 to improve the performance of gene therapy vectors.
One mode of γ-globin gene silencing involves a GATA-1·FOG-1·Mi2β repressor complex that binds to the -566 GATA site relative to the (A)γ-globin gene cap site. However, the mechanism of how this repressor complex is assembled at the -566 GATA site is unknown. In this study, we demonstrate that the O-linked N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) processing enzymes, O-GlcNAc-transferase (OGT) and O-GlcNAcase (OGA), interact with the (A)γ-globin promoter at the -566 GATA repressor site; however, mutation of the GATA site to GAGA significantly reduces OGT and OGA promoter interactions in β-globin locus yeast artificial chromosome (β-YAC) bone marrow cells. When WT β-YAC bone marrow cells are treated with the OGA inhibitor Thiamet-G, the occupancy of OGT, OGA, and Mi2β at the (A)γ-globin promoter is increased. In addition, OGT and Mi2β recruitment is increased at the (A)γ-globin promoter when γ-globin becomes repressed in postconception day E18 human β-YAC transgenic mouse fetal liver. Furthermore, we show that Mi2β is modified with O-GlcNAc, and both OGT and OGA interact with Mi2β, GATA-1, and FOG-1. Taken together, our data suggest that O-GlcNAcylation is a novel mechanism of γ-globin gene regulation mediated by modulating the assembly of the GATA-1·FOG-1·Mi2β repressor complex at the -566 GATA motif within the promoter.
Amifostine is a cytoprotective drug that was initially used to control and treat nuclear radiation injury and is currently used to provide organ protection in cancer patients receiving chemotherapy. Clinical studies have also found that amifostine has some efficacy in the treatment of cytopenia caused by conditions such as myelodysplastic syndrome and immune thrombocytopenia, both of which involve megakaryocyte maturation defects. We hypothesized that amifostine induced the differentiation of megakaryocytes and investigated this by exposing the human Dami megakaryocyte leukemia cell line to amifostine (1 mmol/L). After 12 days of amifostine exposure, optical microscopy showed that the proportion of Dami cells with diameters &gt;20 μm had increased to 24.63%. Transmission electron microscopy identified the development of a platelet demarcation membrane system, while flow cytometry detected increased CD41a expression and decreased CD33 expression on the Dami cell surface. Ploidy analysis found that the number of polyploid cells with &gt;4N DNA content increased to 27.96%. We did not detect any elevation in the mRNA or protein levels of megakaryocytic differentiation-associated transcription factors GATA-binding factor 1 (GATA-1) and nuclear factor, erythroid 2 (NF-E2), but nuclear import assay revealed an increased nuclear translocation of these proteins. These findings indicate that amifostine induced the differentiation of Dami cells into mature megakaryocytes via a mechanism involving increased nuclear translocation of the transcription factors, NF-E2 and GATA-1.
This paper describes data related to a research article titled, "Fas-antisense long noncoding RNA is differentially expressed during maturation of human erythrocytes and confers resistance to Fas-mediated cell death" [1]. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are increasingly appreciated for their capacity to regulate many steps of gene expression. While recent studies suggest that many lncRNAs are functional, the scope of their actions throughout human biology is largely undefined including human red blood cell development (erythropoiesis). Here we include expression data for 82 lncRNAs during early, intermediate and late stages of human erythropoiesis using a commercial qPCR Array. From these data, we identified lncRNA Fas-antisense 1 (Fas-AS1 or Saf) described in the research article. Also included are 5' untranslated sequences (UTR) for lncRNA Saf with transcription factor target sequences identified. Quantitative RT-PCR data demonstrate relative levels of critical erythroid transcription factors, GATA-1 and KLF1, in K562 human erythroleukemia cells and maturing erythroblasts derived from human CD34(+) cells. End point and quantitative RT-PCR data for cDNA prepared using random hexamers versus oligo(dT)18 revealed that lncRNA Saf is not effectively polyadenylated. Finally, we include flow cytometry histograms demonstrating Fas levels on maturing erythroblasts derived from human CD34(+) cells transduced using mock conditions or with lentivirus particles encoding for Saf. 
Complex developmental programs require orchestration of intrinsic and extrinsic signals to control cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival. Master regulatory transcription factors are vital components of the machinery that transduce these stimuli into cellular responses. This is exemplified by the GATA family of transcription factors that establish cell type-specific genetic networks and control the development and homeostasis of systems including blood, vascular, adipose, and cardiac. Dysregulated GATA factor activity/expression underlies anemia, immunodeficiency, myelodysplastic syndrome, and leukemia. Parameters governing the capacity of a GATA factor expressed in multiple cell types to generate cell type-specific transcriptomes include selective coregulator usage and target gene-specific chromatin states. As knowledge of GATA-1 mechanisms in erythroid cells constitutes a solid foundation, we will focus predominantly on GATA-1, while highlighting principles that can be extrapolated to other master regulators. GATA-1 interacts with ubiquitous and lineage-restricted transcription factors, chromatin modifying/remodeling enzymes, and other coregulators to activate or repress transcription and to maintain preexisting transcriptional states. Major unresolved issues include: how does a GATA factor selectively utilize diverse coregulators; do distinct epigenetic landscapes and nuclear microenvironments of target genes dictate coregulator requirements; and do gene cohorts controlled by a common coregulator ensemble function in common pathways. This review will consider these issues in the context of GATA factor-regulated hematopoiesis and from a broader perspective. 
Transcriptional regulators mediate the genesis and function of the hematopoietic system by binding complex ensembles of cis-regulatory elements to establish genetic networks. While thousands to millions of any given cis-element resides in a genome, how transcriptional regulators select these sites and how site attributes dictate functional output is not well understood. An instructive system to address this problem involves the GATA family of transcription factors that control vital developmental and physiological processes and are linked to multiple human pathologies. Although GATA factors bind DNA motifs harboring the sequence GATA, only a very small subset of these abundant motifs are occupied in genomes. Mechanistic studies revealed a unique configuration of a GATA factor-regulated cis-element consisting of an E-box and a downstream GATA motif separated by a short DNA spacer. GATA-1- or GATA-2-containing multiprotein complexes at these composite elements control transcription of genes critical for hematopoietic stem cell emergence in the mammalian embryo, hematopoietic progenitor cell regulation, and erythroid cell maturation. Other constituents of the complex include the basic helix-loop-loop transcription factor Scl/TAL1, its heterodimeric partner E2A, and the Lim domain proteins LMO2 and LDB1. This chapter reviews the structure/function of E-box-GATA composite cis-elements, which collectively constitute an important sector of the hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell cistrome. 
Amylase is one of the most important digestive enzymes for phytophagous animals. In this study, the cDNA, genomic DNA, and promoter region of the α-amylase gene of the pearl oyster Pinctada fucata were cloned by using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), rapid amplification of cDNA ends, and genome-walking methods. The full-length cDNA sequence was 1704bp long and consisted of a 5'-untranslated region of 17bp, a 3'-untranslated region of 118bp, and a 1569-bp open reading frame encoding a 522-aa polypeptide with a 20-aa signal peptide. Sequence alignment revealed that P. fucata α-amylase (Pfamy) shared the highest identity (91.6%) with Pinctada maxima. The phylogenetic tree showed that it was closely related to P. maxima, based on the amino acid sequences. The genomic DNA was 10850bp and contained nine exons, eight introns, and a promoter region of 3932bp. Several transcriptional factors such as GATA-1, AP-1, and SP1 were predicted in the promoter region. Quantitative RT-PCR assay indicated that the relative expression level of Pfamy was significantly higher in the digestive gland than in other tissues (gonad, gills, muscle, and mantle) (P&lt;0.001). The expression level at salinity 27‰ was significantly higher than that at other salinities (P&lt;0.05). Expression reached a minimum when the algal food concentration was 16×10(4)cells/mL, which was significantly lower than the level observed at 8×10(4)cells/mL and 20×10(4) cells/mL (P&lt;0.05). Our findings provide a genetic basis for further research on Pfamy activity and will facilitate studies on the growth mechanisms and genetic improvement of the pearl oyster P. fucata. 
Strongyloidiasis is a neglected chronic nematode infection, in which the control of autoinfection rate and severity of disease is dependent on type 2 immune responses. Strongyloides also causes Th2 responses in the lung of infected animals and changes in airway function, including airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR). Mechanisms of AHR during Strongyloides venezuelensis infection are not entirely known, and we investigate here the role of IL-4, eosinophils, and IL-33/ST2. AHR was evaluated in infected mice by determining changes in lung function after increasing doses of methacholine. Balb/C, but no C57Bl/6, mice developed AHR, tissue eosinophilia, and increased local IL-4 and IL-5 production. Functional changes peaked at day 4 and 7, after the larva had left the lungs. AHR was clearly dependent on IL-4 but not on eosinophils, as evaluated by experiments in IL-4 and Gata-1-deficient mice. Experiments in ST2-deficient mice showed that this pathway was not needed for induction of AHR but was necessary for the maintenance of AHR and for Th2 responses in the lung. These studies clearly show a crucial role for IL-4 in the induction of AHR following S. venezuelensis infection and for IL-33/ST2 in maintaining AHR and lung Th2 responses. 
miRNAs have been widely investigated in terms of cell proliferation and differentiation. However, little is known about their effects on bird growth. Here we characterized the promoter of miR-206 in chicken and found that the preferable promoter was located in 1200 bp upstream of pri-miR-206. In this region, many key transcription factors, including MyoD, c-Myb, CEBPα/β, AP-4, RAP1, Brn2, GATA-1/2/3, E47, Sn, upstream stimulatory factor (USF) and CdxA, were predicted to bind and interact with miR-206 promoter. Overexpression of MyoD sharply increased miR-206 expression in both fibroblast and myoblast cells, and also the regulation in the myoblast cells was much stronger, indicating that miR-206 was regulated by MyoD combined with other muscle specific transcriptional factors. Aiming to further investigate the relationship between miR-206 mutation and transcriptional expression, total of 23 SNPs were identified in the two distinct bird lines by sequencing. Interestingly, the motif bound by MyoD was individually destroyed by G-to-C mutation located at 419 bp upstream of miR-206 precursor. Co-transfecting MyoD and miR-206 promoter in DF-1 cells, the luciferase activity of promoter containing homozygous GG types was significantly higher than CC ones (p &lt; 0.05). Thus, this mutation caused low expression of miR-206. Consistently, eight variants including G-419C mutation exhibited a great effect on birthweight through maker-trait association analysis in F2 population (p &lt; 0.05). Additionally, the regulation of miR-206 on embryo muscle mass mainly by increasing MyoG and muscle creatine kinase (MCK) expression (p &lt; 0.05) with little change in MyoD, TMEM8C and myosin heavy chain (MHC). In conclusion, our findings provide a novel mutation destroying the promoter activity of miR-206 in birds and shed new light to understand the regulation mechanism of miR-206 on the embryonic muscle growth. 
Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) interact with other RNAs, DNA and/or proteins to regulate gene expression during development. Erythropoiesis is one developmental process that is tightly controlled throughout life to ensure accurate red blood cell production and oxygen transport to tissues. Thus, homeostasis is critical and maintained by competitive outcomes of pro- and anti-apoptotic pathways. LncRNAs are expressed during blood development; however, specific functions are largely undefined. Here, a culture model of human erythropoiesis revealed that lncRNA Fas-antisense 1 (Fas-AS1 or Saf) was induced during differentiation through the activity of essential erythroid transcription factors GATA-1 and KLF1. Saf was also negatively regulated by NF-κB, where decreasing NF-κB activity levels tracked with increasing transcription of Saf. Furthermore, Saf over-expression in erythroblasts derived from CD34(+) hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells of healthy donors reduced surface levels of Fas and conferred protection against Fas-mediated cell death signals. These studies reveal a novel lncRNA-regulated mechanism that modulates a critical cell death program during human erythropoiesis. 
After development and differentiation, megakaryocytes (MKs) can produce platelets. As is well known, thrombopoietin (TPO) can induce MKs to differentiate. The effect of thrombin on MKs differentiation is not clear. In this study, we used a human megakaryoblastic leukemia cell line (Meg-01) to assess the effect of thrombin on MKs differentiation.
In order to interrogate the role of thrombin in Meg-01 cells differentiation, the changes of morphology, cellular function, and expression of diverse factors were analyzed.
The results show that thrombin suppresses Meg-01 cells proliferation and induces apoptosis and cell cycle arrest. Thrombin upregulates the expression of CD41b, which is one of the most important MK markers. Globin transcription factor 1 (GATA-1), an important transcriptional regulator, controls MK development and maturation. The expression of GATA-1 is also upregulated by thrombin in Meg-01 cells. The expression of B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2), an apoptosis-inhibitory protein, is downregulated by thrombin. Phosphorylated protein kinase B (p-AKT) and phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (p-ERK) were upregulated by thrombin in Meg-01 cells. All the results are consistent with Meg-01 cells treated with TPO.
In conclusion, all these data indicate that thrombin maybe plays an important role in MK differentiation into platelets. However, whether the platelet-like particles are certainly platelets remains unknown.
The major therapeutic benefit of hydroxyurea, the only FDA-approved pharmacologic treatment for sickle cell disease (SCD), is directly related to fetal hemoglobin (HbF) production that leads to significant reduction of morbidity and mortality. However, potential adverse effects such as infertility, susceptibility to infections, or teratogenic effect have been subject of concerns. Therefore, understanding HU molecular mechanisms of action, could lead to alternative therapeutic agents to increase HbF with less toxicity. This paper investigated whether HU-induced HbF could operate through post-transcriptional miRNAs regulation of BCL11A, KLF-1 and MYB, potent negative regulators of HbF. Both ex vivo differentiated primary erythroid cells from seven unrelated individuals, and K562 cells were treated with hydroxyurea (100 μM) and changes in BCL11A, KLF-1, GATA-1, MYB, β- and γ-globin gene expression were investigated. To explore potential mechanisms of post-transcriptional regulation, changes in expression of seven targeted miRNAs, previously associated with basal γ-globin expression were examined using miScript primer assays. In addition, K562 cells were transfected with miScript miRNA inhibitors/anti-miRNAs followed by Western Blot analysis to assess the effect on HbF protein levels. Direct interaction between miRNAs and the MYB 3'-untranslated region (UTR) was also investigated by a dual-luciferase reporter assays.
Down-regulation of BCL11A and MYB was associated with a sevenfold increase in γ-globin expression in both primary and K562 cells (p &lt; 0.003). Similarly, KLF-1 was down-regulated in both cell models, corresponding to the repressed expression of BCL11A and β-globin gene (p &lt; 0.04). HU induced differential expression of all miRNAs in both cell models, particularly miR-15a, miR-16, miR-26b and miR-151-3p. An HU-induced miRNAs-mediated mechanism of HbF regulation was illustrated with the inhibition of miR-26b and -151-3p resulting in reduced HbF protein levels. There was direct interaction between miR-26b with the MYB 3'-untranslated region (UTR).
These experiments have shown the association between critical regulators of γ-globin expression (MYB, BCL11A and KLF-1) and specific miRNAs; in response to HU, and demonstrated a mechanism of HbF production through HU-induced miRNAs inhibition of MYB. The role of miRNAs-mediated post-transcriptional regulation of HbF provides potential targets for new treatments of SCD that may minimize alterations to the cellular transcriptome.
Efficient induction of fetal hemoglobin (HbF) is considered as an effective therapeutic approach in beta thalassemia. HbF inducer agents can induce the expression of γ-globin gene and produce high levels of HbF via different epigenetic and molecular mechanisms. Thalidomide and sodium butyrate are known as HbF inducer drugs.
CD133(+) stem cells were isolated from umbilical cord blood of a newborn with minor β-thalassemia in order to evaluate the effects of these two drugs on the in vitro expression of GATA-1 and EKLF genes as erythroid transcription factors. CD133(+) stem cells were expanded and differentiated into erythroid lineage and then treated with thalidomide and sodium butyrate and finally analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR. Statistical analysis was performed using student's t-test by SPSS software.
Thalidomide and sodium butyrate increased GATA-1 and EKLF gene expression, compared to the non-treated control (P&lt;0.05).
Thalidomide was more efficient than sodium butyrate in augmenting expression of GATA-1 and EKLF genes. It seems that GATA-1 and EKLF have crucial roles in the efficient induction of HbF by thalidomide.
According to current models of hematopoiesis, lymphoid-primed multi-potent progenitors (LMPPs) (Lin(-)Sca-1(+)c-Kit(+)CD34(+)Flt3(hi)) and common myeloid progenitors (CMPs) (Lin(-)Sca-1(+)c-Kit(+)CD34(+)CD41(hi)) establish an early branch point for separate lineage-commitment pathways from hematopoietic stem cells, with the notable exception that both pathways are proposed to generate all myeloid innate immune cell types through the same myeloid-restricted pre-granulocyte-macrophage progenitor (pre-GM) (Lin(-)Sca-1(-)c-Kit(+)CD41(-)FcγRII/III(-)CD150(-)CD105(-)). By single-cell transcriptome profiling of pre-GMs, we identified distinct myeloid differentiation pathways: a pathway expressing the gene encoding the transcription factor GATA-1 generated mast cells, eosinophils, megakaryocytes and erythroid cells, and a pathway lacking expression of that gene generated monocytes, neutrophils and lymphocytes. These results identify an early hematopoietic-lineage bifurcation that separates the myeloid lineages before their segregation from other hematopoietic-lineage potential.
The β-like globin genes are developmental stage specifically transcribed in erythroid cells. The transcription of the β-like globin genes requires erythroid specific activators such as GATA-1, NF-E2, TAL1 and KLF1. However, the roles of these activators have not fully elucidated in transcription of the human adult β-globin gene. Here we employed hybrid MEL cells (MEL/ch11) where a human chromosome containing the β-globin locus is present and the adult β-globin gene is highly transcribed by induction. The roles of erythroid specific activators were analyzed by inhibiting the expression of NF-E2, TAL1 or KLF1 in MEL/ch11 cells. The loss of each activator decreased the transcription of human β-globin gene, locus wide histone hyperacetylation and the binding of other erythroid specific activators including GATA-1, even though not affecting the expression of other activators. Notably, sensitivity to DNase I was reduced in the locus control region (LCR) hypersensitive sites (HSs) with the depletion of activators. These results indicate that NF-E2, TAL1 and KLF1, all activators play a primary role in HSs formation in the LCR. It might contribute to the transcription of human adult β-globin gene by allowing the access of activators and cofactors. The roles of activators in the adult β-globin locus appear to be different from the roles in the early fetal locus.
GATA-1 and PU.1 are two important hematopoietic transcription factors that mutually inhibit each other in progenitor cells to guide entrance into the erythroid or myeloid lineage, respectively. PU.1 controls its own expression during myelopoiesis by binding to the distal URE enhancer, whose deletion leads to acute myeloid leukemia (AML). We herein present evidence that GATA-1 binds to the PU.1 gene and inhibits its expression in human AML-erythroleukemias (EL). Furthermore, GATA-1 together with DNA methyl Transferase I (DNMT1) mediate repression of the PU.1 gene through the URE. Repression of the PU.1 gene involves both DNA methylation at the URE and its histone H3 lysine-K9 methylation and deacetylation as well as the H3K27 methylation at additional DNA elements and the promoter. The GATA-1-mediated inhibition of PU.1 gene transcription in human AML-EL mediated through the URE represents important mechanism that contributes to PU.1 downregulation and leukemogenesis that is sensitive to DNA demethylation therapy. 
Insulin-like androgenic gland hormone gene (IAG) is a sex regulator specifically expressed in male crustaceans, controlling the male sexual differentiation, spermatogenesis and reproductive strategy. Our previous study reported the cloning and characterization of the prawn Macrobrachium nipponense IAG (MnIAG). In this study, we further identified a 2214-bp MnIAG 5'-flanking region, and analyzed its transcription factor binding sites and transcriptional activity. The results showed that there were two potential promoter core sequences, three TATA boxes and one CAAT box existing in the MnIAG 5'-flanking region as well as many potential transcription factor binding sites, such as SRY, Sox-5, GATA-1, etc. Notably, the transcriptional activity was weak in this region, and a negative regulatory region was found in -604 to -231bp. In addition, we constructed M. nipponense yeast libraries and identified proteins interacting with the MnIAG protein by yeast two hybridization assay. The yeast two-hybrid screening yielded ten positive clones, of which five were annotated by NCBI database, namely heat shock protein 21, NADH dehydrogenase, zinc finger protein, beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase and a hypothetical protein. The identification of MnIAG putative regulatory region and proteins that interact with IAG will facilitate our understanding of the regulatory role of MnIAG and provide a foundation for deep insight into the prawn sex differentiation mechanism and signaling transduction pathways.
The transcription factor GATA-1 plays an essential role in erythroid differentiation. To identify novel GATA-1 target genes, we analyzed a merged ChIP-seq and expression profiling dataset. We identified FAM210B as a putative novel GATA-1 target gene. Study results demonstrated that GATA-1 directly regulates FAM210B expression, presumably by binding to an intronic enhancer region. Both human and murine FAM210B are abundantly expressed in the later stages of erythroblast development. Moreover, the deduced amino acid sequence predicted that FAM210B is a membrane protein, and Western blot analysis demonstrated its mitochondrial localization. Loss-of-function analysis in erythroid cells suggested that FAM210B may be involved in erythroid differentiation. The identification and characterization of FAM210B provides new insights in the study of erythropoiesis and hereditary anemias. 
Fetal hemoglobin is a major genetic modifier of the phenotypic heterogeneity in patients with sickle cell disease and certain β-thalassemias. Normal levels of fetal hemoglobin postnatally are approximately 1% of total hemoglobin. Patients who have hereditary persistence of fetal hemoglobin, characterized by elevated synthesis of γ-globin in adulthood, show reduced disease pathophysiology. Hereditary persistence of fetal hemoglobin is caused by β-globin locus deletions (deletional hereditary persistence of fetal hemoglobin) or γ-globin gene promoter point mutations (non-deletional hereditary persistence of fetal hemoglobin). Current research has focused on elucidating the pathways involved in the maintenance/reactivation of γ-globin in adult life. To better understand these pathways, we generated new β-globin locus yeast artificial chromosome transgenic mice bearing the (A)γ-globin -175 T &gt; C or -195 C &gt; G hereditary persistence of fetal hemoglobin mutations to model naturally occurring hereditary persistence of fetal hemoglobin. Adult -175 and -195 mutant β-YAC mice displayed a hereditary persistence of fetal hemoglobin phenotype, as measured at the mRNA and protein levels. The molecular basis for these phenotypes was examined by chromatin immunoprecipitation of transcription factor/co-factor binding, including YY1, PAX1, TAL1, LMO2, and LDB1. In -175 HPFH versus wild-type samples, the occupancy of LMO2, TAL1 and LDB1 proteins was enriched in HPFH mice (5.8-fold, 5.2-fold and 2.7-fold, respectively), a result that concurs with a recent study in cell lines showing that these proteins form a complex with GATA-1 to mediate long-range interactions between the locus control region and the (A)γ-globin gene. Both hereditary persistence of fetal hemoglobin mutations result in a gain of (A)γ-globin activation, in contrast to other hereditary persistence of fetal hemoglobin mutations that result in a loss of repression. The mice provide additional tools to study γ-globin gene expression and may reveal new targets for selectively activating fetal hemoglobin.
Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) originate from hemogenic endothelium within the aorta-gonad-mesonephros (AGM) region of the mammalian embryo. The relationship between genetic circuits controlling stem cell genesis and multi-potency is not understood. A Gata2 cis element (+9.5) enhances Gata2 expression in the AGM and induces the endothelial to HSC transition. We demonstrated that GATA-2 rescued hematopoiesis in +9.5(-/-) AGMs. As G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are the most common targets for FDA-approved drugs, we analyzed the GPCR gene ensemble to identify GATA-2-regulated GPCRs. Of the 20 GATA-2-activated GPCR genes, four were GATA-1-activated, and only Gpr65 expression resembled Gata2. Contrasting with the paradigm in which GATA-2-activated genes promote hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell genesis/function, our mouse and zebrafish studies indicated that GPR65 suppressed hematopoiesis. GPR65 established repressive chromatin at the +9.5 site, restricted occupancy by the activator Scl/TAL1, and repressed Gata2 transcription. Thus, a Gata2 cis element creates a GATA-2-GPCR circuit that limits positive regulators that promote hematopoiesis.
In Danio rerio, the alpha- and beta-globin genes are present in two clusters: a major cluster located on chromosome 3 and a minor cluster located on chromosome 12. In contrast to the segregated alpha- and beta-globin gene domains of warm-blooded animals, in Danio rerio, each cluster contains both alpha- and beta-globin genes. Expression of globin genes present in the major cluster is controlled by an erythroid-specific enhancer similar to the major regulatory element of mammalian and avian alpha-globin gene domains. The enhancer controlling expression of the globin genes present in the minor locus has not been identified yet. Based on the distribution of epigenetic marks, we have selected two genomic regions that might harbor an enhancer of the minor locus. Using transient transfection of constructs with a reporter gene, we have demonstrated that a ~500-bp DNA fragment located ~1.7 Kb upstream of the αe4 gene possesses an erythroid-specific enhancer active with respect to promoters present in both the major and the minor globin gene loci of Danio rerio. The identified enhancer element harbors clustered binding sites for GATA-1, NF-E2, and EKLF similar to the enhancer of the major globin locus on chromosome 3. Both enhancers appear to have emerged as a result of independent evolution of a duplicated regulatory element present in an ancestral single alpha-/beta-globin locus that existed before teleost-specific genome duplication. 
The review provides an overview of recent data regarding the molecular players in β-thalassemia dyserythropoiesis and the corresponding therapeutic implications.
β-thalassemia dyserythropoiesis is characterized by four steps: expansion of erythroid progenitors, accelerated erythroid differentiation until the polychromatophilic stage, maturation arrest, and apoptosis at the polychromatophilic stage. Excess α-globin chains are the primary culprit in the disease, but the link between this excess and ineffective erythropoiesis has only recently been established. Important recent advances in understanding the molecular determinants involved in two critical steps of dyserythropoiesis are paving the way to new alternative targets for the treatment of this disease.
Growth differentiation factor 11 (GDF11) blockade increases the apoptosis of erythroblasts with excess α-chains by upregulating Fas-ligand in late basophilic and polychromatophilic erythroblasts, thereby decreasing cell expansion (step 1). Blocking GDF11 alleviates anemia in a mouse model of β-thalassemia and also in humans, most likely by promoting cells of 'good' erythroblastic lineage containing an α-/non-α-globin chain ratio of close to 1. Maturation arrest at the polychromatophilic stage (step 3) is associated with the depletion of GATA binding protein 1 (GATA-1) from the nucleus, which results from cytoplasmic sequestration of heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) by α-globin chains. Small molecules disrupting the HSP70/α-globin complex in the cytoplasm or decreasing HSP70 nuclear export might increase the nuclear localization of HSP70, thereby protecting GATA-1 and alleviating anemia. Finally, increasing the serum levels of hepcidin or transferrin alleviates anemia and dyserythropoiesis by diminishing iron uptake by erythroblasts in mouse models.
In hematopoietic system development, PU.1 and GATA-1 as lineage-specific transcription factors (TF) are expressed in common myeloid progenitors. The cross antagonism between them ascertains gene expression programs of monocytic and erythroid cells, respectively. This concept in transdifferentiation approaches has not been well considered yet, especially in intralineage conversion systems. To demonstrate whether PU.1 suppression induces monocyte lineage conversion into red blood cells, a combination of three PU.1-specific siRNAs was implemented to knock down PU.1 gene expression and generate the balance in favor of GATA-1 expression to induce erythroid differentiation. For this purpose, monocytes were isolated from human peripheral blood and transfected by PU.1 siRNAs. In transfected monocytes, the rate of PU.1 expression in mRNA level was significantly decreased until 0.38 ± 0.118 when compared to untreated monocytes at 72 h (p value ≤0.05) which resulted in significant overexpression of GATA1 of 16.1 ± 0.343-fold compared to the untreated group (p value ≤0.01). Subsequently, overexpression of hemoglobin (α 13.26 ± 1.34-fold; p value≤0.0001) and β-globin (37.55 ± 16.56-fold; p value≤0.0001) was observed when compared to control groups. The results of western immunoblotting confirm those findings too. While, reduced expression of monocyte, CD14 gene, was observed in qRT-PCR and flow cytometry results. Our results suggest that manipulating the ratio of the two TFs in bifurcation differentiation pathways via applying siRNA technology can possibly change the cells' fate as a safe way for therapeutics application. 
Erythropoiesis is a complex process that starts in the course of embryo formation and it is maintained throughout the life of an organism. During the fetal development, erythropoiesis arises from different body sites and erythroblast maturation occurs in the fetal liver. After birth, erythropoiesis and erythroblast maturation take place exclusively in the bone marrow, generating a lifetime reservoir of red blood cells (RBCs), which are responsible for transporting oxygen through the bloodstream to tissues and organs. Several transcription factors and cytokines, such as GATA-1, GATA-2, FOG-1 and erythropoietin (EPO), constitute an elaborated molecular network that regulates erythropoiesis as they are involved in the differentiation and maturation of RBCs. The profound understanding of erythropoiesis is fundamental to avoid, treat or even soften the effects of erythropoietic clinical disorders and may be useful to improve patients' well-being. 
Metal ion-containing macromolecules have fundamental roles in essentially all biological processes throughout the evolutionary tree. For example, iron-containing heme is a cofactor in enzyme catalysis and electron transfer and an essential hemoglobin constituent. To meet the intense demand for hemoglobin assembly in red blood cells, the cell type-specific factor GATA-1 activates transcription of Alas2, encoding the rate-limiting enzyme in heme biosynthesis, 5-aminolevulinic acid synthase-2 (ALAS-2). Using genetic editing to unravel mechanisms governing heme biosynthesis, we discovered a GATA factor- and heme-dependent circuit that establishes the erythroid cell transcriptome. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated ablation of two Alas2 intronic cis elements strongly reduces GATA-1-induced Alas2 transcription, heme biosynthesis, and surprisingly, GATA-1 regulation of other vital constituents of the erythroid cell transcriptome. Bypassing ALAS-2 function in Alas2 cis element-mutant cells by providing its catalytic product 5-aminolevulinic acid rescues heme biosynthesis and the GATA-1-dependent genetic network. Heme amplifies GATA-1 function by downregulating the heme-sensing transcriptional repressor Bach1 and via a Bach1-insensitive mechanism. Through this dual mechanism, heme and a master regulator collaborate to orchestrate a cell type-specific transcriptional program that promotes cellular differentiation. 
Tight coordination of cell proliferation and differentiation is central to red blood cell formation. Erythropoietin controls the proliferation and survival of red blood cell precursors, while variations in GATA-1/FOG-1 complex composition and concentrations drive their maturation. However, clear evidence of cross-talk between molecular pathways is lacking. Here, we show that erythropoietin activates AKT, which phosphorylates GATA-1 at Ser310, thereby increasing GATA-1 affinity for FOG-1. In turn, FOG-1 displaces pRb/E2F-2 from GATA-1, ultimately releasing free, proproliferative E2F-2. Mice bearing a Gata-1(S310A) mutation suffer from fatal anemia when a compensatory pathway for E2F-2 production involving insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) signaling is simultaneously abolished. In the context of the GATA-1(V205G) mutation resulting in lethal anemia, we show that the Ser310 cannot be phosphorylated and that constitutive phosphorylation at this position restores partial erythroid differentiation. This study sheds light on the GATA-1 pathways that synchronize cell proliferation and differentiation for tissue homeostasis. 
Interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF-3) is an important transcription factor for interferon genes. Although its functional activation by viral infection has been widely explicated, the regulatory mechanism of IRF-3 gene expression in cancer cells is poorly understood. In this study, we demonstrated treatment of lung adenocarcinoma A549 cells with trichostatin A (TSA) and valproic acid (VPA), two different classes of histone deacetylase inhibitors, strongly stimulated IRF-3 gene expression. Truncated and mutated IRF-3 promoter indicated that a specific GATA-1 element was responsible for TSA-induced activation of IRF-3 promoter. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and electrophoretic mobility shift assay showed that TSA treatment increased the binding affinity of GATA-1 to IRF-3 promoter. Using immunoprecipitation assay and immunoblotting, we demonstrated that TSA increased the level of acetylated GATA-1 in A549 cells. In summary, our study implied that TSA enhanced IRF-3 gene expression through increased GATA-1 recruitment to IRF-3 promoter and the acetylation level of GATA-1 in lung adenocarcinoma A549 cells.
This study represents the first description of the cloning of chicken IL-23p19 (ChIL-23α) and the function of the IL-23 complex in birds. Multiple alignment of ChIL-23α with other known IL-23α amino acid sequences revealed regions of amino acid conservation. The homologies of ChIL-23α, IL-12p35, and similar mammalian subunits ranged between 26% and 42%. ChIL-23α consisted of four exons and three introns; similar to those in humans and mice, and limited conservation of synteny between the human and chicken genomes was observed. Using bioinformatics tools, we identified the NF-κB, C/EBPα-β, c-Jun, c-Rel, AP-1, GATA-1, and ER promoter sites in ChIL-23α. Moreover, IL-23α mRNA was more highly expressed than IL-12p40 and IL-12p35 mRNA in several organs of chickens infected with Salmonella. In addition, ChIL-23 complex are associated with IL-23R, IL-12Rβ1 receptors; activate the JAK2/TYK2, STAT1/3, SOCS1 genes, and induced proinflammatory cytokines in immune cells. Collectively, these results indicate that ChIL-23 is a member of the IL-12 family, has proinflammatory properties related to IL-23R and IL-12Rβ1 receptor expression, and activates the JAK/STAT signaling pathway that results in the interaction of ChIL-23α with ChIL-12p40 to form the novel ChIL-23 complex. Our results provide novel insights into the regulation of immunity, inflammation, and immunopathology.
We report in this study novel biochemical activities of peanut skin extract (PEXT) on thrombocytopoiesis. Peanut skin, derived from Arachis hypogaea L., is a traditional Chinese medicine that is used to treat chronic hemorrhage. We have shown that oral administration of PEXT increases the peripheral platelet levels in mice. Recently, we reported a liquid culture system that is useful for investigating megakaryocytopoiesis and thrombocytopoiesis from human CD34+ cells. In this liquid culture system, PEXT was shown to enhance the formation of CD41+/DAPI- cells (platelets), but had no effect on the formation of CD41+/DAPI+ cells (megakaryocytes) or on the DNA content. Furthermore, PEXT selectively stimulated proplatelet formation from cultured mature megakaryocytes and phorbol 12-myristate 13 acetate (PMA)-induced formation of platelet-like particles from Meg01 cells. Despite having no influence on the formation of megakaryocyte colony forming units (CFUs), PEXT increased the size of megakaryocytes during their development from CD34+ cells. PEXT showed no effect on the GATA-1 and NF-E2 mRNA levels, which are known to play an important role in thrombocytopoiesis and, based on the results of a pMARE-Luc (pGL3-MARE-luciferase) assay, had no influence on NF-E2 activation in Meg01 cells. These results suggest that PEXT accelerates proplatelet formation from megakaryocytes but does not influence the development of hematopoietic stem cells into megakaryocytes.
Distinct epigenomic profiles of histone marks have been associated with gene expression, but questions regarding the causal relationship remain. Here we investigated the activity of a broad collection of genomically targeted epigenetic regulators that could write epigenetic marks associated with a repressed chromatin state (G9A, SUV39H1, Krüppel-associated box (KRAB), DNMT3A as well as the first targetable versions of Ezh2 and Friend of GATA-1 (FOG1)). dCas9 fusions produced target gene repression over a range of 0- to 10-fold that varied by locus and cell type. dCpf1 fusions were unable to repress gene expression. The most persistent gene repression required the action of several effector domains; however, KRAB-dCas9 did not contribute to persistence in contrast to previous reports. A 'direct tethering' strategy attaching the Ezh2 methyltransferase enzyme to dCas9, as well as a 'recruitment' strategy attaching the N-terminal 45 residues of FOG1 to dCas9 to recruit the endogenous nucleosome remodeling and deacetylase complex, were both successful in targeted deposition of H3K27me3. Surprisingly, however, repression was not correlated with deposition of either H3K9me3 or H3K27me3. Our results suggest that so-called repressive histone modifications are not sufficient for gene repression. The easily programmable dCas9 toolkit allowed precise control of epigenetic information and dissection of the relationship between the epigenome and gene regulation.
Hydroxyurea (HU), the first of two drugs approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for treating patients with sickle cell disease (SCD), produces anti-sickling effect by re-activating fetal γ-globin gene to enhance production of fetal hemoglobin. However, approximately 30% of the patients do not respond to HU therapy. The molecular basis of non-responsiveness to HU is not clearly understood. To address this question, we examined HU-induced changes in the RNA and protein levels of transcription factors NF-Y, GATA-1, -2, BCL11A, TR4, MYB and NF-E4 that assemble the γ-globin promoter complex and regulate transcription of γ-globin gene. In erythroblasts cultured from peripheral blood CD34+ cells of patients with SCD, we found that HU-induced changes in the protein but not the RNA levels of activator GATA-2 and repressors GATA-1, BCL11A and TR4 correlated with HU-induced changes in fetal hemoglobin (HbF) levels in the peripheral blood of HU high and low responders. However, HU did not significantly induce changes in the protein or RNA levels of activators NF-Y and NF-E4. Based on HU-induced changes in the protein levels of GATA-2, -1 and BCL11A, we calculated an Index of Hydroxyurea Responsiveness (IndexHU-3). Compared to the HU-induced fold changes in the individual transcription factor protein levels, the numerical values of IndexHU-3 statistically correlated best with the HU-induced peripheral blood HbF levels of the patients. Thus, IndexHU-3 can serve as an appropriate indicator for inherent HU responsiveness of patients with SCD.
Sulfate is an obligate nutrient for fetal growth and development. In mice, the renal Slc13a1 sulfate transporter maintains high maternal circulating levels of sulfate in pregnancy, and the placental Slc13a4 sulfate transporter mediates sulfate supply to the fetus. Both of these genes have been linked to severe embryonal defects and fetal loss in mice. However, the clinical significance of SLC13A1 and SLC13A4 in human gestation is unknown. One approach towards understanding the potential involvement of these genes in human fetal pathologies is to use an animal model, such as the pig, which mimics the developmental trajectory of the human fetus more closely than the previously studied mouse models. In this study, we determined the tissue distribution of pig SLC13A1 and SLC13A4 mRNA, and compared the gene, cDNA and protein sequences of the pig, human and mouse homologues. Pig SLC13A1 mRNA was expressed in the ileum and kidney, whereas pig SLC13A4 mRNA was expressed in the placenta, choroid plexus and eye, which is similar to the tissue distribution in human and mouse. The pig SLC13A1 gene contains 15 exons spread over 76 kb on chromosome 8, and encodes a protein of 594 amino acids that shares 90% and 85% identity with the human and mouse homologues, respectively. The pig SLC13A4 gene is located approximately 11 Mb from SLC13A1 on chromosome 8, and contains 16 exons spanning approximately 70 kb. The pig SLC13A4 protein contains 626 amino acids that share 91% and 90% identity with human and mouse homologues, respectively. The 5'-flanking region of SLC13A1 contains several putative transcription factor binding sites, including GATA-1, GATA-3, Oct1 and TATA-box consensus sequences, which are conserved in the homologous human and mouse sequences. The 5'-flanking sequence of SLC13A4 contains multiple putative transcription factor consensus sites, including GATA-1, TATA-box and Vitamin D responsive elements. This is the first report to define the tissue distribution of pig SLC13A1 and SLC13A4 mRNAs, and compare the gene, cDNA, 5'-flanking region and protein sequences to human and mouse.
Hematopoietic development requires the transcription factor GATA-2, and GATA-2 mutations cause diverse pathologies, including leukemia. GATA-2-regulated enhancers increase Gata2 expression in hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells and control hematopoiesis. The +9.5-kb enhancer activates transcription in endothelium and hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), and its deletion abrogates HSC generation. The -77-kb enhancer activates transcription in myeloid progenitors, and its deletion impairs differentiation. Since +9.5-/- embryos are HSC deficient, it was unclear whether the +9.5 functions in progenitors or if GATA-2 expression in progenitors solely requires -77. We further dissected the mechanisms using -77;+9.5 compound heterozygous (CH) mice. The embryonic lethal CH mutation depleted megakaryocyte-erythrocyte progenitors (MEPs). While the +9.5 suffices for HSC generation, the -77 and +9.5 must reside on one allele to induce MEPs. The -77 generated burst-forming unit-erythroid through the induction of GATA-1 and other GATA-2 targets. The enhancer circuits controlled signaling pathways that orchestrate a GATA factor-dependent blood development program.
Co-inheritance of gamma and beta globin gene mutations in a compound heterozygous state is rare but of clinical interest as it provides an important data on understanding the HbF expression. Hematological analysis was carried out (Sysmex KX-21). F-cells were enumerated using flow cytometry. Beta globin gene was analysed by CRDB technique and by DNA sequencing. Gamma globin promoter region was sequenced and expression studies were carried out using real time Taqman assay. We report a family, where two inherited defects of the β globin gene cluster segregate. The proband and her sibling were compound heterozygotes for a novel Gγ promoter mutation and the 619 bp deletion a common Indian β thalassemia mutation. Molecular characterization revealed that the father (HbA2 5.1%, HbF 5.4%), proband (HbA2 3.6%, HbF 31.7%) and her brother (HbA2 3.9%, HbF 23.6%) were heterozygous for the 619 bp deletion. The mother (HbA2 2.1%, HbF 3.4%) had a normal β globin gene. As both the children showed high HbF levels, the γ globin gene work up was carried out. The Gγ-globin gene promoter analysis revealed that the mother and the two children were heterozygous for a 5 bp deletion -ATAAG (-533 to -529) that resides in the GATA binding site. These findings suggest that the 5 bp deletion in the Gγ globin promoter has a functional role in silencing the γ-globin gene expression in adults by disrupting GATA-1 binding and the associated repressor complex and results in the up-regulation of gamma globin gene expression. When co-inherited with β -thalassemia trait it leads to a phenotype of HPFH.
Calf Spleen Extractive Injection (CSEI), extracted from the spleen of healthy cows (within 24 hours of birth), is a small-peptide-enriched extraction and often used as an ancillary agent in cancer therapy. This study evaluated the hematopoietic function of CSEI and its underlying mechanisms, principally in CHRF, K562 cells, BMNCs and a mouse model of cyclophosphamide (CTX)-induced hematopoietic suppression. CSEI promoted the proliferation and differentiation of CHRF and K562 cells, activated hematopoietic- and proliferation-related factors RSK1p90, ELK1 and c-Myc, and facilitated the expression of differentiation- and maturation-related transcription factors GATA-1, GATA-2. In the mice with hematopoietic suppression, 3 weeks of CSEI administration enhanced the bodyweights and thymus indices, suppressed the spleen indices and strongly elevated the production of HSPCs, neutrophils and B cells in bone marrow, ameliorated bone marrow cellularity, and regulated the ratio of peripheral blood cells. Proteome profiling combined with ELISA revealed that CSEI regulated the levels of cytokines, especially G-CSF and its related factors, in the spleen and plasma. Additional data revealed that CSEI promoted phosphorylation of STAT3, which was stimulated by G-CSF in both mice spleen and cultured BMNCs. Taken together, CSEI has the potential to improve hematopoietic function via the G-CSF-mediated JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway.
To establish a method of gene analysis via zebrafish model to explore the effect of microRNA-191(miR-191) on myelopoiesis.
The hsa-miR-191 or cel-miR-67 was microinjected into the fertilized eggs of zebrafish, then the total RNA of embryos was extracted at 10 s, 24, 36 and 48 hpf for qRT-PCR to detect the expression levels of erythroid and granulocytic genes. Then embryos at the time-point of 24 hpf were collected for whole mount in situ hybridization to detect spatiotemporal expression of those genes.
The antisense RNA probes with high sensitivity and specificity of erythroid genes (gata 1, scl, hbbe 3, lmo 2) and myelomonocytic genes (pu.1, L-plastin, mpx, cebpα) in zebrafish were obtained by molecular cloning and T7 RNA polymerase reaction; the expression levels of the erythroid and myelomonocytic genes of zebrafish microinjected with miR-191 mimics displayed higher than those in control group at the time-points of 24 hpf and 36 hpf. The spatiotemporal expression level of L-plastin at the time-point of 24 hpf was up-regulated, and the other genes were not significantly changed. It was worth mentioning that the mRNA expression level of mpx was significantly up-regulated by 10-20 times at the time-point of 10 s.
The genetic analysis method of embryonic myeloid differentiation has been set up via zebrafish. Preliminary analysis of regulation in zebrafish myelopoiesis shows that miR-191 may be involved in the regulation of erythroid and myelomonocytic differentiation. The mechanism and corresponding function of mpx regulated by the other factors need to be further studied.
Only a few genetic variants have been reported in regulatory elements of blood group genes. Most of them affect GATA motifs, binding sites for the GATA-1 transcription factor.
Samples from two patients and one donor with unusual or discrepant serology for ABO, RhD, and RhCE antigens were analyzed by DNA sequencing. Analyzed regions included the coding sequence and portions of regulatory elements. The effect of some variants on gene expression was evaluated in reporter gene assays.
Three new alleles were identified. Their key variants are located in the ABO Intron 1 enhancer, the RHD proximal promoter, and the RHCE proximal promoter. IVS1 + 5859A was found in an African American patient with a group O forward type and a group B reverse type. 5'UTR-115C was the only RHD variant sequence found in a mixed-race black and Caucasian prenatal patient showing mixed-field agglutination with anti-D. 5'UTR-83T was found in several black donors and patients in the context of the genetically related RHCE*ceBI and RHCE*ceSM alleles. Reporter assays of promoter constructs including 5'UTR-115C or 5'UTR-83T showed a significant reduction in RH gene expression.
Three new alleles in the ABO, RHD, and RHCE genes consist of single-nucleotide changes within GATA motifs, emphasizing the key role of GATA transcription factors in the expression of blood group genes.
Dynamic gene expression is a major regulatory mechanism that directs hematopoietic cell fate and differentiation, including eosinophil lineage commitment and eosinophil differentiation. Though GATA-1 is well established as a critical transcription factor (TF) for eosinophil development, delineating the transcriptional networks that regulate eosinophil development at homeostasis and in inflammatory states is not complete. Yet, recent advances in molecular experimental tools using purified eosinophil developmental stages have led to identifying new regulators of gene expression during eosinophil development. Herein, recent studies that have provided new insight into the mechanisms of gene regulation during eosinophil lineage commitment and eosinophil differentiation are reviewed. A model is described wherein distinct classes of TFs work together via collaborative and hierarchical interactions to direct eosinophil development. In addition, the therapeutic potential for targeting TFs to regulate eosinophil production is discussed. Understanding how specific signals direct distinct patterns of gene expression required for the specialized functions of eosinophils will likely lead to new targets for therapeutic intervention.
Chemokines are important in the immune response against viral infections, and may play a role in human T-lymphotropic virus 1 (HTLV-1)-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP) pathogenesis. Polymorphisms in the Duffy antigen receptor for chemokines (DARC), such as rs12075 (A&gt;G; FY*B&gt;FY*A) and rs281477 (-46T&gt;C; GATA-1 box) may influence circulating concentrations of proinflammatory chemokines. We investigate whether Duffy genotypes influence the HTLV-1 proviral load (PVL) level, HTLV-1 infection outcome and chemokine concentrations in HTLV-1 asymptomatic carriers (AC=162), HAM/TSP patients (HAM=135) and seronegative individuals (SN=71).
Quantification of plasmatic IL8, CCL2 and CCL5 were performed by flow cytometry and Duffy genotypes were investigated by real-time PCR. HTLV-1 PVL was quantified in peripheral blood. To control for spurious association, individual ancestry profiles in AC and HAM groups were investigated.Results/Key findings. PVL and IL8 level were significantly higher in the HAM group than in the AC group, but were not associated with Duffy genotypes. The highest CCL2 and CCL5 levels were seen in the SN group, and there was no difference when comparing the infected groups. The level of CCL5 was not associated with Duffy genotypes. The polymorphism -46 C/C that abrogates the DARC expression on the erythrocytes was significantly associated with lower levels of CCL2, neutrophil and white blood cell (WBC) counts in HTLV-1-infected individuals.
We conclude that although the Duffy null genotype was associated with leukopenia, neutropenia and lower levels of CCL2, the data do not suggest the influence of Duffy genotypes on the neurologic outcome of HTLV-1 infection, but may be a confounding factor in comparison HTLV-1-infected populations with different ancestries, especially when defining inflammatory biomarkers.
The proliferation, differentiation, and survival of cells of the macrophage lineage depends upon signals from the macrophage colony-stimulating factor (CSF) receptor (CSF1R). CSF1R is expressed by embryonic macrophages and induced early in adult hematopoiesis, upon commitment of multipotent progenitors to the myeloid lineage. Transcriptional activation of CSF1R requires interaction between members of the E26 transformation-specific family of transcription factors (Ets) (notably PU.1), C/EBP, RUNX, AP-1/ATF, interferon regulatory factor (IRF), STAT, KLF, REL, FUS/TLS (fused in sarcoma/ranslocated in liposarcoma) families, and conserved regulatory elements within the mouse and human CSF1R locus. One element, the Fms-intronic regulatory element (FIRE), within intron 2, is conserved functionally across all the amniotes. Lineage commitment in multipotent progenitors also requires down-regulation of specific transcription factors such as MYB, FLI1, basic leucine zipper transcriptional factor ATF-like (BATF3), GATA-1, and PAX5 that contribute to differentiation of alternative lineages and repress CSF1R transcription. Many of these transcription factors regulate each other, interact at the protein level, and are themselves downstream targets of CSF1R signaling. Control of CSF1R transcription involves feed-forward and feedback signaling in which CSF1R is both a target and a participant; and dysregulation of CSF1R expression and/or function is associated with numerous pathological conditions. In this review, we describe the regulatory network behind CSF1R expression during differentiation and development of cells of the mononuclear phagocyte system.
Hematopoietic cell differentiation is regulated by various lineage-specific transcription factors. In the context of erythroid differentiation, the importance of GATA-1 has been unequivocally demonstrated by cell-based ex vivo assays, as well as knockout mouse models and rare patients with anemias. GATA-1 regulates the expression of erythroid-related genes, such as globins and genes involved in heme biosynthesis, by recognizing the DNA binding consensus sequence [(A/T) GATA (A/G)] through dual zinc finger motifs. GATA-1 forms a complex with the basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor SCL/TAL1, another master regulator of hematopoiesis. SCL/TAL1 forms a complex containing LMO2, LDB1, and ETO2, which are all required for GATA-1 activity during the erythroid differentiation. Here we focus on the current understanding of transcriptional regulation of erythropoiesis.
Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) play an important role in defense against microbial infections in insects. Expression of AMPs is regulated mainly by NF-κB factors Dorsal, Dif and Relish. Our previous study showed that both NF-κB and GATA-1 factors are required for activation of moricin promoter in the tobacco hornworm, Manduca sexta, and a 140-bp region in the moricin promoter contains binding sites for additional transcription factors. In this study, we identified three forkhead (Fkh)-binding sites in the 140-bp region of the moricin promoter and several Fkh-binding sites in the lysozyme promoter, and demonstrated that Fkh-binding sites are required for activation of both moricin and lysozyme promoters by Fkh factors. In addition, we found that Fkh mRNA was undetectable in Drosophila S2 cells, and M. sexta Fkh (MsFkh) interacted with Relish-Rel-homology domain (RHD) but not with Dorsal-RHD. Dual luciferase assays with moricin mutant promoters showed that co-expression of MsFkh with Relish-RHD did not have an additive effect on the activity of moricin promoter, suggesting that MsFkh and Relish regulate moricin activation independently. Our results suggest that insect AMPs can be activated by Fkh factors under non-infectious conditions, which may be important for protection of insects from microbial infection during molting and metamorphosis.
The development of mature blood cell from hematopoietic stem cells is regulated by transcription factors that coordinate the expression of lineage-specific genes. GATA transcription factors are zinc finger DNA-binding proteins that play crucial roles in various biological processes, including hematopoiesis. Among GATA family proteins, GATA-1, GATA-2, and GATA-3 are essential for hematopoiesis. GATA-1 functions to promote development of erythrocytes, megakaryocytes, eosinophils, and mast cells. Mutations in GATA-1 are associated with acute megakaryoblastic leukemia (AMKL), congenital erythroid hypoplasia (Diamond-Blackfan anemia; DBA), and X-linked anemia and/or thrombocytopenia. Conversely, GATA-2 functions early in hematopoiesis and is required for maintenance and expansion of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and/or multipotent progenitors. GATA-2 mutations are associated with immunodeficiency, lymphedema, myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), and leukemia. Furthermore, decreased GATA-2 expression may contribute to the pathophysiology of aplastic anemia. GATA-3 has an important role in T cell development, and has been suggested to be involved in the pathophysiology of acute lymphoblastic leukemias. This review summarizes current knowledge on hematological disorders associated with GATA-1 and GATA-2 mutations.
Purpose: Translational studies suggest that excess perioperative release of catecholamines and prostaglandins may facilitate metastasis and reduce disease-free survival. This trial tested the combined perioperative blockade of these pathways in breast cancer patients.Experimental Design: In a randomized placebo-controlled biomarker trial, 38 early-stage breast cancer patients received 11 days of perioperative treatment with a β-adrenergic antagonist (propranolol) and a COX-2 inhibitor (etodolac), beginning 5 days before surgery. Excised tumors and sequential blood samples were assessed for prometastatic biomarkers.Results: Drugs were well tolerated with adverse event rates comparable with placebo. Transcriptome profiling of the primary tumor tested a priori hypotheses and indicated that drug treatment significantly (i) decreased epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, (ii) reduced activity of prometastatic/proinflammatory transcription factors (GATA-1, GATA-2, early-growth-response-3/EGR3, signal transducer and activator of transcription-3/STAT-3), and (iii) decreased tumor-infiltrating monocytes while increasing tumor-infiltrating B cells. Drug treatment also significantly abrogated presurgical increases in serum IL6 and C-reactive protein levels, abrogated perioperative declines in stimulated IL12 and IFNγ production, abrogated postoperative mobilization of CD16- "classical" monocytes, and enhanced expression of CD11a on circulating natural killer cells.Conclusions: Perioperative inhibition of COX-2 and β-adrenergic signaling provides a safe and effective strategy for inhibiting multiple cellular and molecular pathways related to metastasis and disease recurrence in early-stage breast cancer.

Essentials The BCR-ABL negative myeloproliferative neoplasms are subjected to unknown phenotypic modifiers. GATA-1 is upregulated in ET patients, regardless of treatment regimen or mutational status. Myelofibrosis (MF) megakaryocytes displayed decreased GATA-1 staining. GATA-1 may have utility as a diagnostic marker in ET and in its differential diagnosis from MF. ABSTRACT: Background The BCR-ABL-negative myeloproliferative neoplasms, i.e., polycythemia vera, essential thrombocythemia (ET), and myelofibrosis (MF), are characterized by mutations in JAK2, CALR, or MPL. However, an as yet unknown factor drives the precise disease phenotype. The hematopoietic transcription factor GATA-1 and its downstream targets NFE2 and FLI1 are responsible for determining erythroid and megakaryocyte lineages during hematopoietic stem cell differentiation. Previous studies have demonstrated a low level of GATA-1 expression in megakaryocytes from patients with MF. Objectives and methods The expression of GATA-1, NFE2 and FLI1 was studied for changes in the peripheral blood (PB) of ET patients. Peripheral blood samples were obtained from 36 ET patients, 14 MF patients, and seven healthy control donors. Total RNA from PB mononuclear cells (PBMCs) was extracted, and quantitative polymerase chain reaction was used to determine relative changes in gene expression. Protein levels of GATA-1 were also determined in bone marrow sections from ET and MF patients. Results GATA-1 mRNA was upregulated in ET patients, regardless of treatment regimen or mutational status. FLI1 expression was significantly downregulated, whereas NFE2 expression was unaffected by changes in GATA-1 mRNA levels. Megakaryocytes from ET patients showed increased protein levels of GATA-1 as compared with those from MF patients. Conclusions Our results confirmed, in PB, our previous data demonstrating elevated levels of GATA-1 mRNA in total bone marrow of ET patients. GATA-1 mRNA levels are independent of cytoreductive therapies, and may have utility as a diagnostic marker in ET and in its differential diagnosis from MF.
Lineage switches are genetic regulatory motifs that govern and maintain the commitment of a developing cell to a particular cell fate. A canonical example of a lineage switch is the pair of transcription factors PU.1 and GATA-1, of which the former is affiliated with the myeloid and the latter with the erythroid lineage within the haematopoietic system. On a molecular level, PU.1 and GATA-1 positively regulate themselves and antagonize each other via direct protein-protein interactions. Here we use mathematical modelling to identify a novel type of dynamic behaviour that can be supported by such a regulatory architecture. Guided by the specifics of the PU.1-GATA-1 interaction, we formulate, using the law of mass action, a system of differential equations for the key molecular concentrations. After a series of systematic approximations, the system is reduced to a simpler one, which is tractable to phase-plane and linearization methods. The reduced system formally resembles, and generalizes, a well-known model for competitive species from mathematical ecology. However, in addition to the qualitative regimes exhibited by a pair of competitive species (exclusivity, bistable exclusivity, stable-node coexpression) it also allows for oscillatory limit-cycle coexpression. A key outcome of the model is that, in the context of cell-fate choice, such oscillations could be harnessed by a differentiating cell to prime alternately for opposite outcomes; a bifurcation-theory approach is adopted to characterize this possibility.
Dysmegakaryopoiesis is a diagnostic criterion for myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), which accompanies thrombocytopenia. Recently, dysmegakaryopoiesis was reported in patients with plasma cell neoplasm (PCN). Although these patients maintained normal platelet counts, disease progressed, with most bone marrow cells being replaced by plasma cells. Several studies reported that dysmegakaryopoiesis was induced by inflammatory mechanisms; however, the exact mechanism underlying dysmegakaryopoiesis remains unknown. This study aimed to investigate whether changes in the megakaryocytic expression of GATA-1, pro-inflammatory cytokines (interleukin [IL]-6 and IL-8), and CD9 affect platelet counts and dysmegakaryopoiesis in patients with PCN and MDS. A total 114 patients were examined and categorized into four groups: MDS with dysmegakaryopoiesis (34 patients), PCN without dysmegakaryopoiesis (36 patients), PCN with dysmegakaryopoiesis (19 patients), and lymphoma without bone marrow infiltration (25 patients). Expression of GATA-1, IL-6, IL-8, and CD9 in megakaryocytes was assessed by immunohistochemical (IHC) staining of paraffin-embedded bone marrow sections. Localized expression of transcription factor and cytokines was observed in megakaryocytes. Furthermore, expression of GATA-1, IL-6, and IL-8 significantly differed (all p values &lt; 0.05). Decreased GATA-1 expression was identified in MDS. Decreased IL-6 expression was observed in PCN and MDS. Moreover, decreased IL-8 expression was associated with dysmegakaryopoiesis, regardless of whether platelet counts were maintained. In conclusion, PCN patients with dysmegakaryopoiesis had normal platelet counts, and their megakaryocytes showed decreased IL-6 and IL-8 expression and normal GATA-1 expression. The differences in the megakaryocytic expression of cytokines in PCN and MDS with dysmegakaryopoiesis may be applicable to future therapeutic strategies.
Sickle cell anemia is one of the most prevalent genetic diseases worldwide, showing great clinical heterogeneity. This study compared the gene expression patterns between sickle cell anemia pediatric patients in steady state and in crisis state, as compared to age-paired, healthy individuals. RNA sequencing was performed from these groups of patients/controls using Illumina HiSeq 2500 equipment. The resulting differentially expressed genes were loaded into QIAGEN's ingenuity pathway analysis. The results showed that EIF2 pathway and NRF2-mediated oxidative stress-response pathways were more highly activated both in steady state and in crisis patients, as compared to healthy individuals. In addition, we found increased activation of eIF4 and p70S6K signaling pathways in crisis state compared to healthy individuals. The transcription factor GATA-1 was found exclusively in steady state while SPI was found exclusively in crisis state. IL6 and VEGFA were found only in crisis state, while IL-1B was found exclusively in steady state. The regulator effects analysis revealed IgG1 as an upstream regulator in steady state compared to healthy individuals, resulting in invasion of prostate cancer cell lines as the disease/function outcome. For crisis-state patients versus healthy individuals, two networks of regulator effects revealed STAT1, CD40LG, TGM2, IRF7, IRF4, and IRF1 acting as upstream regulators, resulting in disease/function outcomes, including engulfment of cells and aggregation of blood cells and inflammation of joints. Our results indicated genes and pathways that can provide clues on the molecular events involved in the severity of sickle cell disease.
Ring sideroblasts are a hallmark of sideroblastic anemia, although little is known about their characteristics. Here, we first generated mutant mice by disrupting the GATA-1 binding motif at the intron 1 enhancer of the ALAS2 gene, a gene responsible for X-linked sideroblastic anemia (XLSA). Although heterozygous female mice showed an anemic phenotype, ring sideroblasts were not observed in their bone marrow. We next established human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived proerythroblast clones harboring the same ALAS2 gene mutation. Through coculture with sodium ferrous citrate, mutant clones differentiated into mature erythroblasts and became ring sideroblasts with upregulation of metal transporters (MFRN1, ZIP8, and DMT1), suggesting a key role for ferrous iron in erythroid differentiation. Interestingly, holo-transferrin (holo-Tf) did not induce erythroid differentiation as well as ring sideroblast formation, and mutant cells underwent apoptosis. Despite massive iron granule content, ring sideroblasts were less apoptotic than holo-Tf-treated undifferentiated cells. Microarray analysis revealed upregulation of antiapoptotic genes in ring sideroblasts, a profile partly shared with erythroblasts from a patient with XLSA. These results suggest that ring sideroblasts exert a reaction to avoid cell death by activating antiapoptotic programs. Our model may become an important tool to clarify the pathophysiology of sideroblastic anemia.
Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACIs) have demonstrated effectiveness against lymphomas and myelomas in clinical practice. However, common to all currently approved broad-acting HDACIs (panHDACIs) is dose-limiting thrombocytopenia, which has prevented wider use in cancer therapy. Using CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), we show that megakaryocyte (MK) cell maturation and differentiation are impaired by panHDACIs, correlating to clinical thrombocytopenia. Importantly, we demonstrate that inhibitors of class II histone deacetylases (HDACs), including LMK235 and tubacin at clinically relevant concentrations, do not affect MK maturation. Furthermore, we show that HDACI-induced impairment of MK differentiation is associated with reduction of protein levels of the transcription factor GATA-1, but not tubulin hyperacetylation. Finally, we report that panHDACIs trigger a rapid loss of GATA-1 protein via a proteasome-dependent pathway. Our data support the notion that specifically targeting class II HDACs in cancer treatment is a potential strategy that would offer a safer alternative than current panHDACIs.
Megakaryopoiesis allows platelet formation, which is necessary for coagulation, also playing an important role in different pathologies. However, this process remains to be fully characterized. C3G, an activator of Rap1 GTPases, is involved in platelet activation and regulates several differentiation processes.
We evaluated C3G function in megakaryopoiesis using transgenic mouse models where C3G and C3GΔCat (mutant lacking the GEF domain) transgenes are expressed exclusively in megakaryocytes and platelets. In addition, we used different clones of K562, HEL and DAMI cell lines with overexpression or silencing of C3G or GATA-1.
We found that C3G participates in the differentiation of immature hematopoietic cells to megakaryocytes. Accordingly, bone marrow cells from transgenic C3G, but not those from transgenic C3GΔCat mice, showed increased expression of the differentiation markers CD41 and CD61, upon thrombopoietin treatment. Furthermore, C3G overexpression increased the number of CD41+ megakaryocytes with high DNA content. These results are supported by data obtained in the different models of megakaryocytic cell lines. In addition, it was uncovered GATA-1 as a positive regulator of C3G expression. Moreover, C3G transgenic megakaryocytes from fresh bone marrow explants showed increased migration from the osteoblastic to the vascular niche and an enhanced ability to form proplatelets. Although the transgenic expression of C3G in platelets did not alter basal platelet counts, it did increase slightly those induced by TPO injection in vivo. Moreover, platelet C3G induced adipogenesis in the bone marrow under pathological conditions.
All these data indicate that C3G plays a significant role in different steps of megakaryopoiesis, acting through a mechanism dependent on its GEF activity.
Elevated levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα) inhibit erythropoiesis and cause anemia in patients with cancer and chronic inflammatory diseases. TNFα is also a potent activator of the sphingomyelinase (SMase)/ceramide pathway leading to ceramide synthesis and regulating cell differentiation, proliferation, apoptosis, senescence, and autophagy. Here we evaluated the implication of the TNFα/SMase/ceramide pathway on inhibition of erythropoiesis in human CD34+ hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (CD34/HSPCs) from healthy donors. Exogenous synthetic C2- and C6-ceramide as well as bacterial SMase inhibited erythroid differentiation in erythropoietin-induced (Epo)CD34/HSPCs shown by the analysis of various erythroid markers. The neutral SMase inhibitor GW4869 as well as the genetic inhibition of nSMase with small interfering RNA (siRNA) against sphingomyelin phosphodiesterase 3 (SMPD3) prevented the inhibition by TNFα, but not the acid SMase inhibitor desipramine. Moreover, sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), a ceramide metabolite, restored erythroid differentiation, whereas TNFα inhibited sphingosine kinase-1, required for S1P synthesis. Analysis of cell morphology and colony formation demonstrated that erythropoiesis impairment was concomitant with a granulomonocytic differentiation in TNFα- and ceramide-treated EpoCD34/HSPCs. Inhibition of erythropoiesis and induction of granulomonocytic differentiation were correlated to modulation of hematopoietic transcription factors (TFs) GATA-1, GATA-2, and PU.1. Moreover, the expression of microRNAs (miR)-144/451, miR-146a, miR-155, and miR-223 was also modulated by TNFα and ceramide treatments, in line with cellular observations. Autophagy plays an essential role during erythropoiesis and our results demonstrate that the TNFα/neutral SMase/ceramide pathway inhibits autophagy in EpoCD34/HSPCs. TNFα- and ceramide-induced phosphorylation of mTORS2448 and ULK1S758, inhibited Atg13S355 phosphorylation, and blocked autophagosome formation as shown by transmission electron microscopy and GFP-LC3 punctae formation. Moreover, rapamycin prevented the inhibitory effect of TNFα and ceramides on erythropoiesis while inhibiting induction of myelopoiesis. In contrast, bafilomycin A1, but not siRNA against Atg5, induced myeloid differentiation, while both impaired erythropoiesis. We demonstrate here that the TNFα/neutral SMase/ceramide pathway inhibits erythropoiesis to induce myelopoiesis via modulation of a hematopoietic TF/miR network and inhibition of late steps of autophagy. Altogether, our results reveal an essential role of autophagy in erythroid vs. myeloid differentiation.
1,2,4-Benzenetriol (BT) is one of the phenolic metabolites of benzene, a general occupational hazard and ubiquitous environmental air pollutant with leukemogenic potential in humans. Previous studies have revealed that the benzene metabolites phenol and hydroquinone can inhibit hemin-induced erythroid differentiation in K562 cells. We investigated the roles of DNA methylation and histone acetylation in BT-inhibited erythroid differentiation in K562 cells. When K562 cells were treated with 0, 5, 10, 15 or 20 µM BT for 72 h, hemin-induced hemoglobin synthesis decreased in a concentration-dependent manner. Both 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-aza-CdR, DNA methyltransferase inhibitor) and trichostatin A (TSA, histone deacetylases inhibitor) could prevent 20 µM BT from inhibiting hemin-induced hemoglobin synthesis and the mRNA expression of erythroid genes. Exposure to BT changed DNA methylation levels at several CpG sites of erythroid-specific genes, as well as the acetylation of histone H3 and H4, chromatin occupancy of GATA-1 and recruitment of RNA polymerase II at α-globin and β-globin gene clusters after hemin induction. These results demonstrated that BT could inhibit hemin-induced erythroid differentiation, where DNA methylation and histone acetylation also played important roles by down-regulating erythroid-specific genes. This partly explained the mechanisms of benzene hematotoxicity.
The consequences of immune dysfunction in B-chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) likely relate to the incidence of serious recurrent infections and second malignancies that plague CLL patients. The well-described immune abnormalities are not able to consistently explain these complications. Here, we report bone marrow (BM) hematopoietic dysfunction in early and late stage untreated CLL patients. Numbers of CD34+ BM hematopoietic progenitors responsive in standard colony-forming unit (CFU) assays, including CFU-GM/GEMM and CFU-E, were significantly reduced. Flow cytometry revealed corresponding reductions in frequencies of all hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC) subsets assessed in CLL patient marrow. Consistent with the reduction in HSPCs, BM resident monocytes and natural killer cells were reduced, a deficiency recapitulated in blood. Finally, we report increases in protein levels of the transcriptional regulators HIF-1α, GATA-1, PU.1, and GATA-2 in CLL patient BM, providing molecular insight into the basis of HSPC dysfunction. Importantly, PU.1 and GATA-2 were rapidly increased when healthy HSPCs were exposed in vitro to TNFα, a cytokine constitutively produced by CLL B cells. Together, these findings reveal BM hematopoietic dysfunction in untreated CLL patients that provides new insight into the etiology of the complex immunodeficiency state in CLL.
This study investigated the effects of N-acetylcysteine (NAC) and ascorbic acid (AA) on hemin-induced K562 cell erythroid differentiation and the role of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in this process. Hemin increased ROS levels in a concentration-dependent manner, whereas NAC and AA had opposite effects. Both NAC and AA eliminated transient increased ROS levels after hemin treatment, inhibited hemin-induced hemoglobin synthesis, and decreased mRNA expression levels of β-globin, γ-globin, and GATA-1 genes significantly. Pretreatment with 5,000 μmol/L AA for 2 h resulted in a considerably lower inhibition ratio of hemoglobin synthesis than that when pretreated for 24 h, whereas the ROS levels were the lowest when treated with 5,000 μmol/L AA for 2 h. These results show that NAC and AA might inhibit hemin-induced K562 cell erythroid differentiation by downregulating ROS levels.
The transcription factor forkhead box N1 (Foxn1) plays an important role in the development and function of thymic epithelial cells (TECs) in vertebrates. However, the transcriptional regulation of Foxn1 is still unknown. A series of dual luciferase report vectors were constructed and their relative activities were also detected. The 5'-untranslated regions contains two cis-acting elements, Sp1 and GATA-1, as well as trans-acting elements between positions -332 to -438. Nevertheless, the relative activities of Foxn1 promoter were significantly increased in PK15 cells only when the Sp1 was overexpressed, suggesting that the Sp1 was the most important sequence for Foxn1 transcription activation in the pig. Regrettably, the exact trans-acting elements were not found.

Hematopoietic stem cells can self-renew and differentiate into all blood cell types. The transcription factor GATA-2 is expressed in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells and is essential for cell proliferation and differentiation. Heterozygous germline GATA2 mutations induce GATA-2 deficiency syndrome, characterized by monocytopenia, a predisposition to myelodysplasia and acute myeloid leukemia, and a profoundly reduced dendritic cell (DC) population, which is associated with increased susceptibility to viral infections. Because patients with GATA-2 deficiency syndrome could retain a wild-type copy of GATA-2, boosting residual wild-type GATA-2 activity may represent a novel therapeutic strategy for the disease. Here, we sought to establish a screening system to identify GATA-2 activators using human U937 monocytic cells as a potential model of the DC progenitor. Enforced GATA-2 expression in U937 cells induces CD205 expression, a marker of DC differentiation, indicating U937 cells as a surrogate of human primary DC progenitors. Transient luciferase reporter assays in U937 cells reveals a high promoter activity of the -0.5 kb GATA-2 hematopoietic-specific promoter (1S promoter) fused with two tandemly connected GATA-2 +9.9 kb intronic enhancers. We thus established U937-derived cell lines stably expressing tandem +9.9 kb/-0.5 kb 1S-luciferase. Importantly, forced GATA-1 expression, a repressor for GATA-2 expression, in the stable clones caused significant decreases in the luciferase activities. In conclusion, our system represents a potential tool for identifying novel regulators of GATA-2, thereby contributing to the development of novel therapeutic approaches.
Erythropoiesis in vertebrates is characterized by sequential changes in erythropoietic site, erythroblast morphology, and hemoglobin synthesis. We have examined the expression of globin chains and the major erythroid transcription factor GATA-1 (previously known as GF-1/NF-E1/Eryf 1) from days 7.5 to 17.5 of mouse development. mRNAs for embryonic (epsilon y2, beta H1, and zeta) and adult (alpha and beta) globin chains were quantitated by RNase protection assays. Switching of globins within the alpha-globin cluster (alpha and zeta) was not strictly coordinated with that within the beta-globin cluster (epsilon y2, beta H1, and beta). Regulation of globin switches during development was primarily transcriptional. Of particular note, we found two developmental switches (beta H1 to epsilon y2 and epsilon y2 to beta) in the mouse, more analogous than previously thought to shifts found in human development. The erythroid transcription factor GATA-1, believed to be a principal regulator of genes expressed in erythroid cells, first appeared in the embryo in yolk sac at the time of blood island formation and remained at a low level during embryonic erythropoiesis (8 to 11 days) relative to that found later in fetal liver (12 to 15 days). The rise in GATA-1 mRNA in fetal liver paralleled and preceded the rapid accumulation of adult beta-globin RNA. RNase protection assays and a GATA-1-specific peptide antiserum were used to establish that a single GATA-1 polypeptide is expressed throughout mouse development. Overall, these findings suggest that the levels of this erythroid transcription factor during development may contribute to the differential gene activation characteristic of definitive versus primitive erythropoiesis.
The promoter and exon 1 sequences of the genes encoding erythrocyte glycophorins GPA, GPB and GPE were investigated in detail, both from a genomic clone sorted out of a human leukocyte library and from genomic clones obtained by polymerase chain reaction amplification of total genomic DNA from control individuals and from GAP and/or GPB deletion variants. The three exons 1 and upstream sequences were shown to be highly homologous with only a few point mutations that did not affect the potential cis-acting elements (CACCC, NF-E1 and NF-E2) that are present in the same position within the three genes. Moreover, these genes share the same transcription start point. Analysis of the exon 1 and promoter sequences together with the gene defects occurring in the GP variants indicate that unequal cross-overs between the three genes are responsible for deletions and the generation of hybrid gene structures in which the promoter of one gene is brought close to another gene of the family. On the basis of these studies, a model of the gene organization is proposed to explain the rearrangements occurring in the variants.
Two cis-acting sequences, recognized by two erythroid-specific trans-acting factors, are involved in the regulation of the erythroid promoter of the human gene coding for porphobilinogen deaminase (PBGD). The first region, located at -70, binds the erythroid factor NF-E1, and point mutations within this region abolish the induction of transcription of this promoter during murine erythroleukemia (MEL) cell differentiation. The second region, located at -160, binds the erythroid-specific factor NF-E2 and the ubiquitous factor AP1. Using UV cross-linking, we show that NF-E2 has a higher molecular weight than AP1, demonstrating that NF-E2 is not an erythroid-specific degradation product of AP1. By point mutagenesis of the NF-E2/AP1 binding site, we define mutations that abolish binding of either NF-E2 alone or AP1 and NF-E2 together. Regulation of transcription of the PBGD erythroid promoter is abolished by those mutations, suggesting that NF-E2 but not AP1 is necessary for correct regulation of this promoter in erythroid cells.
We have used DNaseI footprinting and gel mobility assays to analyze the upstream region of the human A gamma-globin gene promoter. Four protein factors were found to bind this region. A non-erythroid factor present in the 0.4M KCl fraction of a heparin agarose column binds to the CAC box (-140). A ubiquitous octamer factor present in the 0.2M fraction binds to an ATGCAAT element (-175), but is completed out by the erythroid specific factor NF-E1 (in the 0.4M KCl fraction), which binds a site (-186) immediately flanking the octamer. A novel factor binding to a stretch of 8A around -233, was identified in the 0.2M KCl fraction. This factor is not present in HeLa nuclear extracts. To study the transcriptional importance of these protein binding sites we have used an "A gamma-minilocus", similar to that described for the beta-globin gene (1) in K562 cells. This provides evidence that the NF-E1 and CAC box in the -210 to -122 region of the A gamma-promoter are important for the efficient expression of the gamma-globin gene.
A new deletion of the beta-globin gene cluster has been characterized in two Italian brothers who are heterozygous carriers of a G gamma A gamma hereditary persistence of fetal hemoglobin (HPFH). Restriction endonuclease mapping and DNA sequencing of the region encompassing the breakpoint show that the deletion starts 3.2 kilobases (kb) upstream from the delta gene and ends within the enhancer region 3' to the beta-globin gene. Here the deletion removes one of the four binding sites for an erythroid specific transcriptional factor (NF-E1). The molecular comparison of the new deletion with others of similar size and location but associated with a delta beta-thalassemia phenotype suggests that the residual enhancer element, relocated near gamma genes, may increase the fetal hemoglobin (HbF) expression above the level observed in delta beta-thalassemia.
Acute intermittent porphyria (AIP), an autosomal dominant inborn error of heme biosynthesis, results from the half-normal activity of the heme biosynthetic enzyme hydroxymethylbilane synthase (HMB-synthase). Heterozygous individuals are prone to life-threatening acute neurologic attacks, which are precipitated by certain drugs and other metabolic, hormonal, and nutritional factors. Since the biochemical diagnosis of heterozygous individuals has been problematic, recent efforts have focused on the identification of mutations and diagnostically useful restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs) in the HMB-synthase gene. To facilitate these endeavors, the human HMB-synthase gene, including 1.1 kg of the 5' flanking region, was isolated and completely sequenced in both orientations. The 10,024-bp gene contained 15 exons ranging in size from 39 to 438 bp and 14 introns ranging from 87 to 2913 bp. All intron/exon boundaries conformed to the GT/AG consensus rule. There were six Alu repetitive elements, one of the J and five of the Sa subfamilies. Analysis of the 1.1-kb 5' flanking region revealed putative regulatory elements for the housekeeping promoter including AP1, AP4, SP1, TRE, ENH, and CAC. This region contained 10 HpaII sites and had an overall GC content of 54%. Intron 1, which contained the erythroid-specific promoter, had putative regulatory motifs for NF-1, NF-E1, NF-E1(b), NF-E2, AP1, AP4, TOPO, CAAC, CAC, CAAT, and TATA. The locations and variant nucleotides for the known RFLPs in intron 1 were identified [MspI, nucleotide 1345 G/A; PstI, 1500 C/T; ApaLI, 2377 C/A; and BstNI, 2479 G/A] and improved polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based detection methods for each were established.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
Human chi-alcohol dehydrogenase (chi-ADH) is a zinc-containing dimeric enzyme responsible for the oxidation of long-chain alcohols and omega-hydroxyfatty acids. Class-III ADHs, of which chi-ADH is the prototype, are widely produced and well conserved during evolution. This suggests that they fulfill important housekeeping roles in cellular metabolism. Recent evidence suggests that class-III ADH and formaldehyde dehydrogenase (FDH) are the same enzyme. We have isolated and characterized two overlapping genomic clones that cover the entire ADH5 (FDH) gene. ADH5 is composed of nine exons and eight introns. Two major transcription start points were identified by primer extension. The 5' nontranslated region is unusual in that it contains two additional upstream ATG codons, which would encode peptides of 20 and 10 amino acids. Neither of the upstream ATGs is in a good context for translation initiation, whereas the ATG initiating &amp;khgr;-ADH is in a favorable context. The 5' region of ADH5 is a CpG island; it is extremely G+C rich and has many CpG doublets. It does not contain either a TATA box or a CAAT box. This is consistent with ubiquitous expression, and contrasts with the promoters of all previously cloned ADH genes, which are expressed in a tissue-specific manner. The 5' region of ADH5 contains consensus binding sites for the transcriptional regulatory proteins, Sp1, AP2, LF-A1, NF-1, NF-A2, and NF-E1. A 1.5-kb upstream fragment from ADH5 was able to drive the transcription of a cat reporter gene at high levels in monkey kidney cells (CV-1). Several processed pseudogenes were also isolated.
The de novo megakaryocytic leukemia fulfilling the FAB criteria is still an uncommonly recognized variant of acute leukemia. Many studies have shown that the megakaryocytic leukemic events may occur at a pluripotent stem cell level and clinical observations reveal that the megakaryocytic leukemias are diverse entities. The immunophenotyping using monoclonal antibodies against platelet specific surface antigens and the ultrastructural detection of platelet peroxidase reaction do not provide sufficiently useful information to determine whether a megakaryocytic leukemia is chronic, acute, therapy-responsive or therapy-unresponsive. More sophisticated techniques are required to further characterize megakaryocytic leukemic cells. In this review, we emphasize that megakaryocytic leukemic cells can be categorized into two groups; one with the PF4 mRNA, and the other without it, and that the expression of PF4 mRNA in the blasts could be a useful marker for the identification of mature megakaryoblasts. It seems that the patients with blasts expressing PF4 mRNA will have a longer survival and a better response to chemotherapy than those without PF4. We further discuss the fact that the detection of mRNAs of the IL-6 receptor, PDGF A- and B-chains, and TGF beta 1 in megakaryocytic leukemic cells will be useful to clarify the mechanisms involved in the proliferation of megakaryocytic leukemic cells and fibroblasts in the bone marrow. Furthermore, we reviewed data showing that megakaryocytic erythroid, and mast cell lineages share the nuclear transcription factor known as GF-1 (NF-E1 or Erf-1). We suggest that characterization of megakaryocytic leukemia should be performed using monoclonal antibodies against erythroid, megakaryocytic and mast cell lineages.
Multiple signal transduction pathways are generally triggered simultaneously by a single extracellular stimulus. As a result, multiple transcription factors (TFs) can be activated downstream to mediate the inducible expression of target genes. Profiling the activation of all TFs will aid in the dissection of the numerous pathways of signal transduction. Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) mediate many biological functions, including cell proliferation and apoptosis, by stimulating signaling pathways. Two TFs, nuclear factor kappaB (NFkappaB) and activating factor 1 (AP1), have been identified as targets of both TNFalpha and PMA activation. Here, we describe the use of a protein/DNA array system to identify additional TFs activated by TNFalpha and PMA in HeLa cells. From a total of 150 targeted TFs, six-CREB, E2F, CETP/CRE, c-Rel, MSP1, and Pax6-were identified whose activities, like NFkappaB and AP1, were regulated by both TNFalpha- and PMA-induced pathways. Interestingly, the TF E47 was shown to be specifically activated by TNFalpha but was not affected by treatment with PMA. In addition, GATA, NF-E1, and ISRE were shown to be specifically activated by PMA but not TNFalpha. These findings suggest that TNFalpha and PMA both stimulate unique signaling pathways while mediating transcriptional activation through common pathways.
We have cloned and sequenced a 906bp EcoRI repeat DNA fraction from Rhinoceros unicornis genome. The contig pSS(R)2 is AT rich with 340 A (37.53%), 187 C (20.64%), 173 G (19.09%) and 206 T (22.74%). The sequence contains MALT box, NF-E1, Poly-A signal, lariat consensus sequences, TATA box, translational initiation sequences and several stop codons. Translation of the contig showed seven different types of protein motifs, among which, EGF-like domain cysteine pattern signatures and Bowman-Birk serine protease inhibitor family signatures were prominent. The presence of eukaryotic transcriptional elements, protein signatures and analysis of subset sequences in the 5' region from 1 to 165nt indicating coding potential (test code value=0.97) suggest possible regulatory and/or functional role(s) of these sequences in the rhino genome. Translation of the complementary strand from 906 to 706nt and 190 to 2nt showed proteins of more than 7kDa rich in non-polar residues. This suggests that pSS(R)2 is either a part of, or adjacent to, a functional gene. The contig contains mostly non-consecutive simple repeat units from 2 to 17nt with varying frequencies, of which four base motifs were found to be predominant. Zoo-blot hybridization revealed that pSS(R)2 sequences are unique to R. unicornis genome because they do not cross-hybridize, even with the genomic DNA of South African black rhino Diceros bicornis. Southern blot analysis of R. unicornis genomic DNA with pSS(R)2 and other synthetic oligo probes revealed a high level of genetic homogeneity, which was also substantiated by microsatellite associated sequence amplification (MASA). Owing to its uniqueness, the pSS(R)2 probe has a potential application in the area of conservation biology for unequivocal identification of horn or other body tissues of R. unicornis. The evolutionary aspect of this repeat fraction in the context of comparative genome analysis is discussed.
A genomic clone for the human glutaredoxin gene was isolated and sequenced. An intron was located within the coding region and began 211 nt downstream of the initiator codon. Except for this intron, the genomic sequence shares 100% identity to the published glutaredoxin cDNA sequence. A second intron was located in the 3' UTR 6 bp downstream of the terminator codon. The tsp of the glutaredoxin gene was determined by primer extension and confirmed by S1 mapping analysis. Analysis of the 5'-flanking region of the gene revealed that the promoter sequences TATA and CCAAT were 30 and 160 bp upstream, respectively, from the tsp. Other potential transcription factor binding sites included NF-E1, HNF-5, P2II and AP-1. Glutaredoxin promoter constructs inserted into a reporter plasmid for firefly luciferase were transfected into fibroblasts, and luciferase activity was 8-10-fold higher compared with controls lacking glutaredoxin promoter. These data indicate that the promoter region of the isolated glutaredoxin gene is functional.
Human lysosomal beta-hexosaminidases are encoded by two genes, HEXA and HEXB, specifying an alpha- and a beta-subunit, respectively. The subunits dimerize to form beta-hexosaminidase A (alpha beta), beta-hexosaminidase B (beta beta), and beta-hexosaminidase S (alpha alpha). This enzyme system has the capacity to degrade a variety of cellular substrates: oligosaccharides, glycosaminoglycans, and glycolipids containing beta-linked N-acetylglucosaminyl or N-galactosaminyl residues. Mutations in either the HEXA gene or HEXB gene lead to an accumulation of GM2 ganglioside in neurons, resulting in the severe neurodegenerative disorders termed the GM2 gangliosidoses. To identify the DNA elements responsible for hexosaminidase expression, we ligated the 5'-flanking sequences of both the human and mouse hexosaminidase genes to a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene. The resulting plasmids were transfected into NIH-3T3 cells and CAT activity was determined as a measure of promoter strength. By 5' deletion analysis, it was found that essential sequences for HEXA expression resided within a 40-bp region between 100 bp and 60 bp upstream of the ATG initiation codon. This area contained two potential estrogen response element half-sites as well as potential binding sites for transcription factors NF-E1 and AP-2. Similarly, important HEXB promoter sequences were localized to a 60-bp region between 150 bp and 90 bp upstream of the ATG codon. By performing scanning mutagenesis on a 60-bp region within the 150-bp HEXB construct, we defined an essential promoter element of 12 bp that contained two potential AP-1 sites. The mouse Hexa and Hexb 5'-flanking sequences were found to contain regions similar in sequence, location, and activity to the essential promoter elements defined in the cognate human genes. No sequence similarity was found, however, between 5'-flanking regions of the HEXA and HEXB genes. These essential promoter elements represent potential sites for HEXA and HEXB mutations that could alter enzyme expression in Tay-Sachs and Sandhoff diseases, respectively.
The N314D polymorphism was found in two different alleles of the galactose-1-phosphate uridyltransferase (GALT) gene, Duarte-1 (D1) and Duarte-2 (D2). Although both variants have identical electrophoretic mobility and isoelectro-focusing points, the galactose-1-phosphate uridyltransferase (GALT) activity varies: D1 alleles showed 110-130% of the normal RBC activity, but D2 alleles only 40-50%. We found that D1 alleles also carried a silent mutation in exon 7 (L218L) in addition to N314D. In contrast, besides N314D, D2 alleles carried two regulatory mutations, G1105C and G1391A, in introns D and E, respectively. In normal and Q188R alleles none of the above four mutations coexisted. However, some galactosaemia alleles with mutations other than Q188R, such as W316X and E340X of exon 10, also carried the N314D mutation. The W316X alleles existed in cis with the intron mutations (G1105C and G1391A), whereas those with E340X are in cis with L218L. In all cases examined, the intron mutations were not found in D1 alleles and no D2 alleles had the silent mutation of L218L. These results suggest that the decrease in the GALT activity in D2 may be due to regulation of the GALT gene expression. The G1105C site may be critical to the function of erythroid transcription factor NF-E1, since it flanks the core consensus sequence for one of its binding sites. The G1391A mutation may affect another cis-acting regulatory sequence. Alternatively, both mutations may be involved in an aberrant splice processing, which possibly results in a low level of correctly spliced mRNA.
We have isolated genomic DNA clones covering the gene for human DNA polymerase delta catalytic subunit (POLD1) and its 5' flanking sequence. This gene is divided into 27 exons and is distributed over at least 32 kb of DNA. The exons and most of the introns are relatively small. The sizes of the exons range from 55 to 201 bp. Seven introns are smaller than 100 bp. Intron 1 is the largest intron, with a size of greater than 10 kb. All of the intron-exon junctions match well with the reported consensus sequences. Multiple copies of the Alu repetitive sequence and the variable number of tandem repeats were found in several introns. Transcription of POLD1 appears to initiate at multiple sites. The major start site was 53 nucleotides upstream of the ATG start codon. The sequence of the promoter and upstream DNA is G+C rich and does not contain a TATA sequence. Several potential transcription factor-binding sites, including the AP2-, CTF-, Ets1-, GCF-, MBF-1-, NF-E1-, and Sp1-binding sites, were found in this region. A 1.8-kb pol delta promoter DNA directed the expression of a luciferase reporter gene when transfected into HeLa cells.
The promoter of the mouse gene encoding ribosomal protein L30 contains binding sites for four transcription factors; alpha (RFX-1), beta (GABP), gamma and delta (YY-1/NF-E1/UCRBP). The relative contributions of these factors to the strength of the rpL30 promoter in vivo and the degree of synergism among the factors was evaluated by transfection experiments using a series of mutant promoters in which one or more of the binding sites was drastically altered to prevent recognition by its cognate factor. Our results indicated that GABP and RFX-1 are the major determinants of the rpL30 promoter strength, acting synergistically to boost activity more than eightfold over that which occurs in their absence. The contributions of gamma and delta became evident only when the promoter was weakened by eliminating the participation of the other factors. Indeed, as the promoter strength was progressively reduced, the contribution of each individual factor increased, implying that the capacity of the general transcription machinery to be stimulated by these factors is saturable. The activity of the rpL30 promoter was significantly diminished when three pyrimidine residues spanning the start site were converted to purines, indicating that the integrity of the oligopyrimidine tract is also a determinant of the transcriptional efficiency. These studies reveal the hierarchy of importance of four transcription factors that govern the expression of the rpL30 gene. Moreover, they define the graduated levels of promoter activity that would result from deficiencies of these factors in any particular cell type. This information may provide a useful paradigm for understanding the transcriptional regulation of other ubiquitously expressed genes.
In mammals, sex is determined by the Y chromosome, which encodes a testis-determining factor (TDF). This factor causes the undifferentiated embryonic gonads to develop as testes rather than ovaries. The testes subsequently produce the male sex hormones that are responsible for all male sexual characteristics. In 1990, the sex-determining gene, TDF, was identified and termed SRY in humans (Sry in mice). It encodes a protein containing a high mobility group (HMG) motif, which confers the ability to bind and to bend DNA. Genetic evidence supporting SRY as TDF came from the observation of a male phenotype in XX mice transgenic for a small genomic fragment containing Sry, and from the study of XY sex-reversed individuals who harbor de novo mutations in the SRY coding sequence. Other non-Y-linked genes involved in sex determination were subsequently found by genetic analysis of XY sex-reversed patients not explained by mutations in SRY. These genes are WT1, SF1, DAX1, and SOX9. A regulatory cascade hypothesis for mammalian sex determination, proposing that SRY represses a negative regulator of male development, was recently supported by observation of mice that expressed a DAX1 transgene and developed as XY sex-reversed females. The role of some sex-determining genes, such as DAX1 and SF1, in the development of the entire reproductive axis, a functionally integrated endocrine axis, leads to a new concept. Normal sexual development may result from the functional and developmental integration of a number of different genes that play roles in sex determination, sexual differentiation, and sexual behavior.
Antiretroviral (ARV) treatment has been associated with abnormalities in lipid and mitochondrial metabolism. We compared patterns of gene expression in the subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) of HIV-positive subjects before and after 18-24 months of ARV therapy with HIV-negative controls.
HIV patients naive to ARV were randomized to receive zidovudine (AZT), lamivudine (3TC) with efavirenz (EFV) or tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) with emtricitabine (FTC) and EFV. Healthy controls (n=15) were matched for age, ethnicity and gender. Patients on a regimen containing abacavir (ABC), 3TC and EFV for 18-24 months were also tested. Genes involved in adipocyte glucocorticoid, lipid and mitochondrial metabolism, and adipocyte differentiation, were profiled with real-time PCR.
AZT led to increased visceral adipose tissue (VAT; P=0.012) and VAT:SAT ratio (P=0.036), whereas TDF increased SAT (P=0.047) and peripheral fat/lean body mass ratio (P=0.017). HIV treatment-naive patients had lower plasma lipoprotein lipase (LPL) activity (P=0.0001) versus controls (remaining below controls after ARV; P=0.038-0.0001). The overall pattern of gene expression was similar across all treatment groups, being most marked with AZT and least with TDF. There was up-regulation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ coactivator-1α, uncoupling protein-2 and hexose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase, and down-regulation of nuclear respiratory factor-1, cytochrome oxidase B, cytochrome c oxidase-4, uncoupling protein-3, 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type-1, glucocorticoid receptor-α, fatty acid synthase, fatty acid binding protein-4, LPL and hormone sensitive lipase (18-24 months post-treatment versus pretreatment levels and controls; P&lt;0.05 to &lt;0.0001).
The decreased expression of genes involved in lipid and mitochondrial metabolism 18-24 months post-ARV treatment in SAT of HIV patients, in conjunction with the increase in uncoupling protein-2 and decrease in cytochrome oxidase B gene expression, provides evidence of mitochondrial dysfunction and a shift to anaerobic metabolism within SAT in EFV-containing ARV regimens.
The mechanisms for sex differentiation and the genes on the sex chromosomes are varied among different species. For human, SRY is the only testis-determining factor on the Y chromosome and triggers the cascade for male sex-determination. However, even if normal SRY exists, the haploinsufficienty of SOX9 or KTS+ splicing form of WT-1 can cause male-to-female sex reversal. Furthermore, the duplication of the partial region on the X chromosome including DAX-1 gene can also cause male-to-female sex reversal. The sex-determining system seems to be sensitive for the gene dosage or the gene expression level.
Mammalian sex determination and gonad differentiation are the result of a complex interaction of fine-tuned spatial and temporal gene expression with threshold levels of individual genes. The male pathway is initiated by SRY. Some exceptional mammals determine male sex without the SRY gene and even without a Y chromosome. Ellobius lutescens in this report is one example of this "weird" species. We provide key data on the genomic level that there are no coarse differences in the genomes of male and female animals by comparative genomic hybridization. On the gene level we studied the gene Nr5a1 for the orphan nuclear receptor, steroidogenic factor SF-1, a central constituent for gonad differentiation and adrenal gland development. The Ellobius lutescens Nr5a1 gene was mapped to the proximal short arm of chromosome 2 by fluorescence in situ hybridization. In addition, we provide evidence by linkage analysis in two E. lutescens pedigrees that Nr5a1 is not the key male sex-determining gene in Ellobius lutescens.
Sex determination in mammals and birds is chromosomal, while in many reptiles sex determination is temperature dependent. Morphological development of the gonads in these systems is conserved, suggesting that many of the genes involved in gonad development are also conserved. The genes SF1, WT1 and DAX1 play various roles in the mammalian testis-determining pathway. SF1 and WT1 are thought to interact to cause male-specific gene expression during testis development, while DAX1 is believed to inhibit this male-specific gene expression. We have cloned SF1 and DAX1 from the American alligator, a species with temperature-dependent sex determination (TSD). SF1, DAX1 and WT1 are expressed in the urogenital system/gonad throughout the period of alligator gonadogenesis which is temperature sensitive. SF1 appears to be expressed at a higher level in females than in males. This SF1 expression pattern is concordant with the observed pattern during chicken gonadogenesis, but opposite to that observed during mouse gonadogenesis. Although the observed sexual dimorphism of gonadal SF1 expression in alligators and chickens is opposite that observed in the mouse, it is probable that SF1 is involved in control of gonadal steroidogenesis in all these vertebrates. DAX1 and WT1 are both expressed during stages 22-25 of both males and females. However, there appear to be no sex differences in the expression patterns of these genes. We conclude that DAX1, WT1 and SF1 may be involved in gonadal development of the alligator. These genes may form part of a gonadal-development pathway which has been conserved through vertebrate evolution.
Sry is the only gene on the Y chromosome that is required for testis formation in mammals. One of the earliest morphological changes that occurs as a result of Sry expression is a size increase of the rudimentary XY gonad relative to the XX gonad. Using 5'-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation to label dividing cells, we found that the size increase corresponds with a dramatic increase in somatic cell proliferation in XY gonads, which is not detected in XX gonads. This male-specific proliferation was observed initially in the cells of the coelomic epithelium and occurred in two distinct stages. During the first stage, proliferation in the XY gonad was observed largely in SF1-positive cells and contributed to the Sertoli cell population. During the second stage, proliferation was observed in SF1-negative cells at and below the coelomic epithelium and did not give rise to Sertoli cells. Both stages of proliferation were dependent on Sry and independent of any other genetic differences between male and female gonads, such as X chromosome dosage or other genes on the Y chromosome. The increase in cell proliferation began less than 24 hours after the onset of Sry expression, before the establishment of male-specific gene expression patterns, and before the appearance of any other known male-specific morphological changes in the XY gonad. Therefore, an increase in cell proliferation in the male coelomic epithelium is the earliest identified effect of Sry expression.
We have previously identified a rat hepatonuclear factor, PS-1 that binds to the thyroid hormone responsive gene, S14. To determine whether PS-1 is involved in regulating tissue-specific expression of the S14 gene, we have correlated the DNA binding activity of PS-1 with mRNA-S14 expression in a variety of tissues. Gel retardation analysis revealed a pattern of binding to the recognition site that was characteristic of tissues with high levels of mRNA-S14, a different pattern was found in tissues which do not express the gene. Competition studies using mutant oligonucleotides showed that the first 4 nucleotides and the CAAT motif contained within the PS-1 recognition sequence are essential for protein binding. C/EBP, a CCAAT-transcription factor binds to the PS-1 recognition site thus raising the possibility that both C/EBP and PS-1 may belong to the same family of proteins. Next we used a cell-free transcription assay to measure activity of a template, pS14-GFC(-72), that contained the PS-1 sequence. The pS14-GFC(-72) template was active in hepatonuclear extracts but deletion of or competition with the PS-1 binding sequence rendered the construct inactive. A template containing three PS-1 binding sequences increased S14 promoter activity by 12- to 13-fold. In nuclear extracts from spleen and testis, relative S14 promoter activity was only 2% of that in the liver, this observation mimicked closely in vivo expression of the gene. Mixing together extracts from liver and spleen in varying proportions, prior to incubation with S14 template, yielded a linear increase in S14 promoter activity that correlated with the amount of liver extract in the reaction. This finding is consistent with the absence of an essential factor or factors in spleen that is/are required for S14 promoter activity in vitro. In summary, PS-1 binds to a DNA sequence that contains a CAAT motif and appears to play a critical role in determining tissue-specific activity of the S14 promoter in vitro.
Differentiation of testicular tissue in 46,XX individuals is seen either in XX males, the majority of them with SRY gene, or in individuals, usually SRY(-), with ovotesticular disorder of sex development (OT-DSD). Although they are sporadic cases, there are some reports on familial recurrence, including coexistence of XX maleness and OT-DSD in the same family.
We report on a case of SRY(-) 46,XX monozygotic twins with genital ambiguity.
Hormonal evaluation included testosterone, FSH, and LH measurements. SRY gene was investigated by PCR and two-step PCR in peripheral leukocytes and gonadal tissues, respectively. Direct DNA sequencing of the DAX-1 coding sequence was performed. Real-time PCR for SOX9 region on chromosome 17 was obtained.
Both twins had a 46,XX karyotype. Twin A had a 1-cm phallus with chordee, penoscrotal hypospadias, and palpable gonads. Serum levels of FSH (2.34 mIU/ml), LH (8.8 mIU/ml), and testosterone (1.6 ng/ml) were normal, and biopsies revealed bilateral testes. Twin B had a 0.5-cm phallus, perineal hypospadias, no palpable gonad on the right, and a left inguinal hernia. Hormonal evaluation revealed high FSH (8.2 mIU/ml) and LH (15 mIU/ml) and low testosterone (0.12 ng/ml). Upon herniotomy, a right testis (crossed ectopia) and a small left ovotestis were found. SRY gene was absent in both peripheral leukocytes and gonadal tissue samples. Neither DAX-1 mutations nor SOX9 duplication was identified.
This case provides evidence that both XX maleness and XX OT-DSD are different manifestations of the same disorder of gonadal development.
The nuclear receptor transcription factor Dax1 is hypothesized to play a role in testicular development, although the mechanism of its action is unknown. Here, we present evidence that Dax1 plays an early essential role in fetal testis development. We hypothesize that upregulation of Sox9 expression in precursor somatic cells, a process required for their differentiation as Sertoli cells, depends on the coordinated expression of Dax1, Sry and another gene, Tda1. Our conclusion and model are based on the following experimental findings: (1) presence of a mutant Dax1 allele (Dax1-) results in complete gonadal sex reversal in C57BL/6JEi (B6) XY mice, whereas testes develop in DBA/2J (D2) and (B6xD2)F1 XY mice; (2) B6-DAX1 sex reversal is inherited as a complex trait that includes the chromosome 4 gene Tda1; (3) B6 Dax1-/Y fetal gonads initiate development as ovaries, even though Sry expression is activated at the correct time and at appropriate levels; (4) upregulation of Sox9 does not occur in B6 Dax1-/Y fetal gonads in spite of apparently normal Sry expression; and (5) overexpression of Sry in B6 Dax1-/Y fetal gonads upregulates Sox9 and corrects testis development.
Recently, we demonstrated that loss of Fgf9 results in a block of testis development and a male to female sex-reversed phenotype; however, the function of Fgf9 in sex determination was unknown. We now show that Fgf9 is necessary for two steps of testis development just downstream of the male sex-determining gene, Sry: (1) for the proliferation of a population of cells that give rise to Sertoli progenitors; and (2) for the nuclear localization of an FGF receptor (FGFR2) in Sertoli cell precursors. The nuclear localization of FGFR2 coincides with the initiation of Sry expression and the nuclear localization of SOX9 during the early differentiation of Sertoli cells and the determination of male fate.
What are the effects of experimentally manipulating meiosis signalling by addition of retinoic acid (RA) in cultured human fetal gonads?
RA-treatment accelerated meiotic entry in cultured fetal ovary samples, while addition of RA resulted in a dysgenetic gonadal phenotype in fetal testis cultures.
One of the first manifestations of sex differentiation is the initiation of meiosis in fetal ovaries. In contrast, meiotic entry is actively prevented in the fetal testis at this developmental time-point. It has previously been shown that RA-treatment mediates initiation of meiosis in human fetal ovary ex vivo.
This was a controlled ex vivo study of human fetal gonads treated with RA in 'hanging-drop' tissue cultures. The applied experimental set-up preserves germ cell-somatic niche interactions and the investigated outcomes included tissue integrity and morphology, cell proliferation and survival and the expression of markers of meiosis and sex differentiation.
Tissue from 24 first trimester human fetuses was included in this study, all from elective terminations at gestational week (GW) 7-12. Gonads were cultured for 2 weeks with and without addition of 1 µM RA. Samples were subsequently formalin-fixed and investigated by immunohistochemistry and cell counting. Proteins investigated and quantified included; octamer-binding transcription factor 4 (OCT4), transcription factor AP-2 gamma (AP2γ) (embryonic germ cell markers), SRY (sex determining region Y)-box 9 (SOX9), anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) (immature Sertoli cell markers), COUP transcription factor 2 (COUP-TFII) (marker of interstitial cells), forkhead box L2 (FOXL2) (granulosa cell marker), H2A histone family, member X (γH2AX) (meiosis marker), doublesex and mab-3 related transcription factor 1 (DMRT1) (meiosis regulator), cleaved poly ADP ribose polymerase (PARP), cleaved Caspase 3 (apoptosis markers) and Ki-67 antigen (Ki-67) (proliferation marker). Also, proliferation was determined using a 5'-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation assay.
A novel ex vivo 'hanging-drop' culture model for human fetal gonads was successfully established. Continued proliferation of cells without signs of increased apoptosis was observed after 2 weeks of culture. In cultured fetal ovaries treated with RA, an increased number of meiotic germ cells (P &lt; 0.05) and DMRT1-positive oogonia initiating meiosis (P &lt; 0.05) was observed, which is in agreement with a previous study. In fetal testes, RA-treatment resulted in a decreased number of gonocytes (P &lt; 0.05), a reduced percentage of proliferating gonocytes (P &lt; 0.05), altered expression pattern of the somatic cell markers AMH and COUP-TFII, as well as disrupted seminiferous cord structure and testis morphology.
The number of samples included in this study was relatively small due to the limited availability of human fetal tissue.
The hanging-drop culture, similarly to other organ culture approaches, allows studies of germ cell-somatic niche interactions and determination of effects after manipulating specific signalling pathways. Our novel finding of disrupted fetal testis development after treatment with RA indicates that abnormal meiosis regulation can potentially cause gonadal dysgenesis. Further studies will elucidate the exact mechanisms and timing of observed effects.

SRY (sex-determining region Y) gene, MIM 480000, NM_005634) is crucial for sex differentiation which encodes the protein responsible for initiating testis differentiation. SRY mutations are associated with the presence of XY gonadal dysgenesis symptoms. We studied a 46,XY female patient with primary amenorrhoea and negative family history. The clinical, endocrine, histopathologic and cytogenetic data are consistent with gonadal dysgenesis. Using a molecular analysis, a novel (c.341A&gt;G, p. N65D) missense mutation within the HMGbox of SRY gene was detected. Escherichia coli expression of SRY study showed reduced expression of the mutated protein and gel retardation assay method revealed lowered DNA-binding ability in N65D variant of SRY. The novel mutation detected in the SRY gene may be an aetiopathogenic factor in clinically defined 46,XY complete gonadal dysgenesis (CGD). Because of an increased risk of gonadoblastoma, proper early diagnosis and treatment prevent development of malignancies. 
Allogeneic stem cell transplantation is currently the only curative therapy for primary myelofibrosis (MF), while the JAK2 inhibitor, ruxolitinib. Has been approved only for palliation. Other therapies are desperately needed to reverse life-threatening MF. However, the cell(s) and cytokine(s) that promote MF remain unclear. Several reports have demonstrated that captopril, an inhibitor of angiotensin-converting enzyme that blocks the production of angiotensin II (Ang II), mitigates fibrosis in heart, lung, skin and kidney. Here, we show that captopril can mitigate the development of MF in the Gata1low mouse model of primary MF. Gata1low mice were treated with 79 mg/kg/d captopril in the drinking water from 10 to 12 months of age. At 13 months of age, bone marrows were examined for fibrosis, megakaryocytosis and collagen expression; spleens were examined for megakaryocytosis, splenomegaly and collagen expression. Treatment of Gata1low mice with captopril in the drinking water was associated with normalization of the bone marrow cellularity; reduced reticulin fibres, splenomegaly and megakaryocytosis; and decreased collagen expression. Our findings suggest that treating with the ACE inhibitors captopril has a significant benefit in overcoming pathological changes associated with MF.
The immunomodulatory drugs, lenalidomide and pomalidomide yield high response rates in multiple myeloma patients, but are associated with a high rate of thrombocytopenia and increased risk of secondary hematologic malignancies. Here, we demonstrate that the immunomodulatory drugs induce self-renewal of hematopoietic progenitors and upregulate megakaryocytic colonies by inhibiting apoptosis and increasing proliferation of early megakaryocytic progenitors via down-regulation of IKZF1. In this process, the immunomodulatory drugs degrade IKZF1 and subsequently down-regulate its binding partner, GATA1. This results in the decrease of GATA1 targets such as ZFPM1 and NFE2, leading to expansion of megakaryocytic progenitors with concomitant inhibition of maturation of megakaryocytes. The down-regulation of GATA1 further decreases CCND1 and increases CDKN2A expression. Overexpression of GATA1 abrogated the effects of the immunomodulatory drugs and restored maturation of megakaryocytic progenitors. Our data not only provide the mechanism for the immunomodulatory drugs induced thrombocytopenia but also help to explain the higher risk of secondary malignancies and long-term cytopenia induced by enhanced cell cycling and subsequent exhaustion of the stem cell pool.
We report a multiplex family with a GATA1 gene mutation responsible for a massive fetal cerebral hemorrhage occurring at 36 weeks. Two other stillbirth cousins presented with fetal hydrops and congenital hemochromatosis' phenotype at 37 and 12 weeks of gestation. Molecular screening revealed the presence of a c.613G&gt;A pathogenic allelic variation in exon 4 of GATA1 gene in the 3 male siblings and their carrier mothers. The diagnosis of a GATA1 gene mutation may be suspected in cases of male fetuses with intracerebral bleeding, particularly if a history of prior fetal loss(es) and mild maternal thrombocytopenia are also present.
Congenital dyserythropoietic anemias (CDA) are characterized by hyporegenerative anemia with inadequate reticulocyte values, ineffective erythropoiesis, and hemolysis. Distinctive morphology of bone marrow erythroblasts and identification of causative genes allow classification into 4 types caused by variants in CDAN1, c15orf41, SEC23B, KIF23, and KLF1 genes.
Identify pathogenic variants in CDA patients.
Massive parallel sequencing with a targeted gene panel, Sanger sequencing, Comparative Genome Hybridization (CGH), and in silico predictive analysis of pathogenicity.
Pathogenic variants were found in 21 of 53 patients studied from 44 unrelated families. Six variants were found in CDAN1: two reported, p.Arg714Trp and p.Arg725Trp and, four novel, p.Arg623Trp, p.Arg946Trp, p.Phe1125Ser and p.Ser1227Gly. Twelve variants were found in SEC23B: seven reported, p.Arg14Trp, p.Glu109Lys, p.Arg217Ter, c.835-2A&gt;G, p.Arg535Ter, p.Arg550Ter and p.Arg718Ter and, five novel, p.Val164Leu, p.Arg190Gln, p.Gln521Ter, p.Arg546Trp, and p.Arg611Gln. The variant p.Glu325Lys in KLF1 was found in one patient and p.Tyr365Cys in ALAS2 in an other. Moreover, we identified genomic rearrangements by CGH in some SEC23B-monoallelic patients.
New technologies for genetic studies will help to find variants in other genes, in addition to those known, that contribute to or modulate the CDA phenotype or support the correct diagnosis.
Congenital dyserythropoietic anemias (CDAs) are rare hereditary blood disorders characterized by ineffective erythropoiesis, hemolysis, and erythroblast morphologic abnormalities in the bone marrow. The 3 main types of CDA, I to III, and variant types of CDA, IV-VIII, have been described. The causative genes have been identified as CDAN1, C15ORF41, SEC23B, KIF23, KLF1, and GATA1. CDA type II is the most frequent form. Typical symptoms are jaundice, hepatosplenomegaly, mild-to-severe normocytic anemia, and inadequate reticulocyte response. We report an 18-year-old boy who had chronic mild congenital anemia, jaundice, and splenomegaly mimicking nonautoimmune hemolytic anemia since 18 months of age. Compound heterozygous mutations in SEC23B gene were detected by the use of a gene-targeted next-generation sequencing panel: the already reported missense mutation c.40C&gt;T (p.Arg14Trp), and a new frameshift deletion (c.489_489delG, p.Val164Trpfs*3), confirming the diagnosis of CDA type II. The study underlines the molecular heterogeneity of CDA II and the importance of a precise diagnosis in rare congenital diseases such as CDA II. In consequence, it can be difficult to diagnose because of limited resources, financial constraint, and rarity of disease in the developing country. Advanced laboratories and new molecular approaches may help in diagnosing rare anemias.
The role of the liver for survival of blood-stage malaria is only poorly understood. In experimental blood-stage malaria with Plasmodium chabaudi, protective vaccination induces healing and, thus, survival of otherwise lethal infections. This model is appropriate to study the role of the liver in vaccination-induced survival of blood-stage malaria.
Female Balb/c mice were vaccinated with a non-infectious vaccine consisting of plasma membranes isolated in the form of erythrocyte ghosts from P. chabaudi-infected erythrocytes at week 3 and week 1 before infection with P. chabaudi blood-stage malaria. Gene expression microarrays and quantitative real-time PCR were used to investigate the response of the liver, in terms of expression of mRNA and long intergenic non-coding (linc)RNA, to vaccination-induced healing infections and lethal P. chabaudi malaria at early patency on day 4 post infection, when parasitized erythrocytes begin to appear in peripheral blood.
In vaccination-induced healing infections, 23 genes were identified to be induced in the liver by &gt; tenfold at p &lt; 0.01. More than one-third were genes known to be involved in erythropoiesis, such as Kel, Rhag, Ahsp, Ermap, Slc4a1, Cldn13 Gata1, and Gfi1b. Another group of &gt; tenfold expressed genes include genes involved in natural cytotoxicity, such as those encoding killer cell lectin-like receptors Klrb1a, Klrc3, Klrd1, the natural cytotoxicity-triggering receptor 1 Ncr1, as well as the granzyme B encoding Gzmb. Additionally, a series of genes involved in the control of cell cycle and mitosis were identified: Ccnb1, Cdc25c, Ckap2l were expressed &gt; tenfold only in vaccination-protected mice, and the expression of 22 genes was at least 100% higher in vaccination-protected mice than in non-vaccinated mice. Furthermore, distinct lincRNA species were changed by &gt; threefold in livers of vaccination-protected mice, whereas lethal malaria induced different lincRNAs.
The present data suggest that protective vaccination accelerates the malaria-induced occurrence of extramedullary erythropoiesis, generation of liver-resident cytotoxic cells, and regeneration from malaria-induced injury in the liver at early patency, which may be critical for final survival of otherwise lethal blood-stage malaria of P. chabaudi.
Catecholamines and prostaglandins are secreted abundantly during the perioperative period in response to stress and surgery, and were shown by translational studies to promote tumor metastasis. Here, in a phase-II biomarker clinical trial in breast cancer patients (n = 38), we tested the combined perioperative use of the β-blocker, propranolol, and the COX2-inhibitor, etodolac, scheduled for 11 consecutive perioperative days, starting 5 days before surgery. Blood samples were taken before treatment (T1), on the mornings before and after surgery (T2&amp;T3), and after treatment cessation (T4). Drugs were well tolerated. Results based on a-priori hypotheses indicated that already before surgery (T2), serum levels of pro-inflammatory IL-6, CRP, and IFNγ, and anti-inflammatory, cortisol and IL-10, increased. At T2 and/or T3, drug treatment reduced serum levels of the above pro-inflammatory cytokines and of TRAIL, as well as activity of multiple inflammation-related transcription factors (including NFκB, STAT3, ISRE), but not serum levels of cortisol, IL-10, IL-18, IL-8, VEGF and TNFα. In the excised tumor, treatment reduced the expression of the proliferation marker Ki-67, and positively affected its transcription factors SP1 and AhR. Exploratory analyses of transcriptome modulation in PBMCs revealed treatment-induced improvement at T2/T3 in several transcription factors that in primary tumors indicate poor prognosis (CUX1, THRa, EVI1, RORa, PBX1, and T3R), angiogenesis (YY1), EMT (GATA1 and deltaEF1/ZEB1), proliferation (GATA2), and glucocorticoids response (GRE), while increasing the activity of the oncogenes c-MYB and N-MYC. Overall, the drug treatment may benefit breast cancer patients through reducing systemic inflammation and pro-metastatic/pro-growth biomarkers in the excised tumor and PBMCs.
Aberrant hypermethylation of cellular genes is a common phenomenon to inactivate genes and promote tumorigenesis in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC).
Methyl binding domain (MBD)-ChIP sequencing of NPC cells, microarray data of NPC biopsies and gene ontology analysis were conducted to identify a potential tumor suppressor gene CLDN11 that was both hypermethylated and downregulated in NPC. Bisulfite sequencing, qRT-PCR, immunohistochemistry staining of the NPC clinical samples and addition of methylation inhibitor, 5'azacytidine, in NPC cells were performed to verify the correlation between DNA hypermethylation and expression of CLDN11. Promoter reporter and EMSA assays were used to dissect the DNA region responsible for transcription activator binding and to confirm whether DNA methylation could affect activator's binding, respectively. CLDN11 was transiently overexpressed in NPC cells followed by cell proliferation, migration, invasion assays to characterize its biological roles. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments and proteomic approach were carried out to identify novel interacting protein(s) and the binding domain of CLDN11. Anti-tumor activity of the CLDN11 was elucidated by in vitro functional assay.
A tight junction gene, CLDN11, was identified as differentially hypermethylated gene in NPC. High methylation percentage of CLDN11 promoter in paired NPC clinical samples was correlated with low mRNA expression level. Immunohistochemistry staining of NPC paired samples tissue array demonstrated that CLDN11 protein expression was relatively low in NPC tumors. Transcription activator GATA1 bound to CLDN11 promoter region - 62 to - 53 and its DNA binding activity was inhibited by DNA methylation. Re-expression of CLDN11 reduced cell migration and invasion abilities in NPC cells. By co-immunoprecipitation and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry LC-MS/MS, tubulin alpha-1b (TUBA1B) and beta-3 (TUBB3), were identified as the novel CLDN11-interacting proteins. CLDN11 interacted with these two tubulins through its intracellular loop and C-terminus. Furthermore, these domains were required for CLDN11-mediated cell migration inhibition. Treatment with a tubulin polymerization inhibitor, nocodazole, blocked NPC cell migration.
CLDN11 is a hypermethylated and downregulated gene in NPC. Through interacting with microtubules TUBA1B and TUBB3, CLDN11 blocks the polymerization of tubulins and cell migration activity. Thus, CLDN11 functions as a potential tumor suppressor gene and silencing of CLDN11 by DNA hypermethylation promotes NPC progression.
Myelofibrosis (MF) is a clinical manifestation of chronic BCR-ABL1-negative chronic myeloproliferative neoplasms. Splenomegaly is one of the major clinical manifestations of MF and is directly linked to splenic extramedullary hematopoiesis (EMH). EMH is associated with abnormal trafficking patterns of clonal hematopoietic cells due to the dysregulated bone marrow (BM) microenvironment leading to progressive splenomegaly. Several recent data have emphasized the role of several cytokines for splenic EMH. Alteration of CXCL12/CXCR4 pathway could also lead to splenic EMH by migrated clonal hematopoietic cells from BM to the spleen. Moreover, low Gata1 expression was found to be significantly associated with the EMH. Several gene mutations were found to be associated with significant splenomegaly in MF. In recent data, JAK2V617F homozygous mutation was associated with a larger spleen size. In other data, CALR mutations in MF were signigicantly associated with longer larger splenomegaly-free survivals than others. In addition, MF patients with ≥1 mutations in AZXL1, EZH1 or IDH1/2 had significantly low spleen reduction response in ruxolitinib treatment. Developments of JAK inhibitors, such as ruxolitinib, pacritinib, momelotinib, and febratinib enabled the effective management in MF patients. Especially, significant spleen reduction responses of the drugs were demonstrated in several randomized clinical studies, although those could not eradicate allele burdens of MF.
During hematopoiesis, red blood cells originate from the hematopoietic stem cell reservoir. Although the regulation of erythropoiesis and globin expression has been intensively investigated, the underlining mechanisms are not fully understood, including the interplay between transcription factors and epigenetic factors. Here, we uncover that the Mbd2-free NuRD chromatin remodeling complex potentiates erythroid differentiation of proerythroblasts via managing functions of the CP2c complexes. We found that both Mbd2 and Mbd3 expression is downregulated during differentiation of MEL cells in vitro and in normal erythropoiesis in mouse bone marrow, and Mbd2 downregulation is crucial for erythropoiesis. In uninduced MEL cells, the Mbd2-NuRD complex is recruited to the promoter via Gata1/Fog1, and, via direct binding through p66α, it acts as a transcriptional inhibitor of the CP2c complexes, preventing their DNA binding and promoting degradation of the CP2c family proteins to suppress globin gene expression. Conversely, during erythropoiesis in vitro and in vivo, the Mbd2-free NuRD does not dissociate from the chromatin and acts as a transcriptional coactivator aiding the recruitment of the CP2c complexes to chromatin, and thereby leading to the induction of the active hemoglobin synthesis and erythroid differentiation. Our study highlights the regulation of erythroid differentiation by the Mbd2-CP2c loop.
Eosinophils were reported to serve as an essential component of the plasma cell niche within the bone marrow. As the potential contribution of eosinophils to humoral immunity has remained incompletely understood, we aimed to further characterize their role during antibody responses and to additionally investigate their role in autoimmune disease. Contrary to our expectations and the currently prevailing paradigm, we found that eosinophils are fully dispensable for the survival of murine bone marrow plasma cells and accordingly do not contribute to antibody production and autoantibody-mediated disease. Littermate wild type and eosinophil-deficient ΔdblGATA-1 animals showed similar numbers and frequencies of plasma cells and did not differ in steady state levels of immunoglobulins or their ability to raise antigen-specific antibody responses. Eosinophils were likewise dispensable for autoantibody production or autoantibody-induced disease in a mouse model of systemic lupus erythematosus. Our findings thus argue against a role of eosinophils during the maintenance of the plasma cell pool and challenge the hitherto postulated concept of an eosinophil-sustained bone marrow niche.
Individuals with Down syndrome (DS) frequently have hematopoietic abnormalities, including transient myeloproliferative disorder and acute megakaryoblastic leukemia which are often accompanied by acquired GATA1 mutations that produce a truncated protein, GATA1s. The mouse has been used for modeling DS based on the syntenic conservation between human chromosome 21 (Hsa21) and three regions in the mouse genome located on mouse chromosome 10 (Mmu10), Mmu16 and Mmu17. To assess the impact of the dosage increase of Hsa21 gene orthologs on the hematopoietic system, we characterized the related phenotype in the Dp(10)1Yey/+;Dp(16)1Yey/+;Dp(17)1Yey/+ model which carries duplications spanning the entire Hsa21 orthologous regions on Mmu10, Mmu16 and Mmu17, and the Dp(10)1Yey/+;Dp(16)1Yey/+;Dp(17)1Yey/+;Gata1Yeym2 model which carries a Gata1s mutation we engineered. Both models exhibited anemia, macrocytosis, and myeloproliferative disorder. Similar to human DS, the megakaryocyte-erythrocyte progenitors (MEPs) and granulocyte-monocyte progenitors (GMPs) were significantly increased and reduced, respectively, in both models. The subsequent identification of all the aforementioned phenotypes in the Dp(16)1Yey/+ model suggests that the causative dosage sensitive gene(s) are in the Hsa21 orthologous region on Mmu16. Therefore, we reveal here for the first time that the human trisomy 21-associated major segmental chromosomal alterations in mice can lead to expanded MEP and reduced GMP populations, mimicking the dynamics of these myeloid progenitors in DS. These models will provide the critical systems for unraveling the molecular and cellular mechanism of DS-associated myeloproliferative disorder, and particularly for determining how human trisomy 21 leads to expansion of MEPs as well as how such an alteration leads to myeloproliferative disorder.
To define the possible effect of diabetic conditions on megakaryocytes, the long-know precursors of platelets and lately characterized modulator of hematopoietic stem quiescence-activation transition.
Megakaryoblastic MEG-01 cell culture and TPO/SCF/IL-3-induced differentiation of human umbilical blood mononuclear cells toward megakaryocytes were used to test effects of glycated bovine serum albumin (BSA-AGEs). The ob/ob mice and streptozotocin-treated mice were used as models of hyperglycemia. MTT was used to measure cell proliferation, FACS for surface marker and cell cycle, and RT-qPCR for the expression of interested genes. Megakaryocytes at different stages in marrow smear were checked under microscope.
When added in MEG-01 cultures at 200 μg/ml, BSA-AGEs increased proliferation of cells and enhanced mRNA expression of RAGE, VEGFα and PF4 in the cells. None of cell cycle distribution, PMA-induced platelet-like particles production, expression of GATA1/NF-E2/PU-1/IL-6/OPG/PDGF in MEG-01 cells nor TPO/SCF/IL-3 induced umbilical cord blood cells differentiation into megakaryocyte was affected by BSA-AGEs. In the ob/ob diabetic mice, MKs percentages in marrow cells and platelets in peripheral blood were significantly increased compared with control mice. In streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice, however, MKs percentage in marrow cells was decreased though peripheral platelet counts were not altered. Gene expression assay showed that the change in MKs in these two diabetic conditions might be explained by the alteration of GATA1 and NF-E2 expression, respectively.
Diabetic condition in animals might exert its influence on hematopoiesis via megakaryocytes-the newly identified modulator of hematopoietic stem cells in bone marrow.
Alpha-hemoglobin stabilizing protein (AHSP) is a molecular chaperone that can reduce the damage caused by excess free α-globin to erythroid cells in patients with impaired β-globin chain synthesis. We assessed the effect of sodium phenylbutyrate and sodium valproate, two histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDIs) that are being studied for the treatment of hemoglobinopathies, on the expression of AHSP, BCL11A (all isoforms), γ-globin genes (HBG1/2), and some related transcription factors including GATA1, NFE2, EKLF, KLF4, and STAT3. For this purpose, the K562 cell line was cultured for 2, 4, and 6 days in the presence and absence of sodium phenylbutyrate and sodium valproate. Relative real-time qRT-PCR analysis of mRNA levels was performed to determine the effects of the two compounds on gene expression. Expression of all target mRNAs increased significantly (p &lt; 0.05), except for the expression of BCL11A, which was down-regulated (p &lt; 0.05) in the cells treated with both compounds relative to the levels measured for untreated cells. The findings indicated that sodium valproate had a more considerable effect than sodium phenylbutyrate (p &lt; 0.0005) on BCL11A repression and the up-regulation of other studied genes. γ-Globin and AHSP gene expression continuously increased during the culture period in the treated cells, with the highest gene expression observed for 1 mM sodium valproate after 6 days. Both compounds repressed the expression of BCL11A (-XL, -L, -S) and up-regulated GATA1, NFE2, EKLF, KLF4, STAT3, AHSP, and γ-globin genes expression. Moreover, sodium valproate showed a stronger effect on repressing BCL11A and escalating the expression of other target genes. The findings of this in vitro experiment could be considered in selecting drugs for clinical use in patients with β-hemoglobinopathies.
Metastatic melanoma is an aggressive skin cancer and is one of the global malignancies with high mortality and morbidity. It is essential to identify and verify diagnostic biomarkers of early metastatic melanoma. Previous studies have systematically assessed protein biomarkers and mRNA-based expression characteristics. However, molecular markers for the early diagnosis of metastatic melanoma have not been identified. To explore potential regulatory targets, we have analyzed the gene microarray expression profiles of malignant melanoma samples by co-expression analysis based on the network approach. The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were screened by the EdgeR package of R software. A weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) was used for the identification of DEGs in the special gene modules and hub genes. Subsequently, a protein-protein interaction network was constructed to extract hub genes associated with gene modules. Finally, twenty-four important hub genes (RASGRP2, IKZF1, CXCR5, LTB, BLK, LINGO3, CCR6, P2RY10, RHOH, JUP, KRT14, PLA2G3, SPRR1A, KRT78, SFN, CLDN4, IL1RN, PKP3, CBLC, KRT16, TMEM79, KLK8, LYPD3 and LYPD5) were treated as valuable factors involved in the immune response and tumor cell development in tumorigenesis. In addition, a transcriptional regulatory network was constructed for these specific modules or hub genes, and a few core transcriptional regulators were found to be mostly associated with our hub genes, including GATA1, STAT1, SP1, and PSG1. In summary, our findings enhance our understanding of the biological process of malignant melanoma metastasis, enabling us to identify specific genes to use for diagnostic and prognostic markers and possibly for targeted therapy.
Neutrophils and eosinophils, 2 prominent granulocytes, are commonly derived from myelocytic progenitors through successive stages in the bone marrow. Our previous genome-wide transcriptomic data unexpectedly showed that genes encoding a multitude of neutrophil primary granule proteins (NPGPs) were markedly downregulated during the end period of eosinophilic terminal differentiation when cord blood (CB) cluster of differentiation (CD) 34+ cells were induced to differentiate toward the eosinophil lineage during a 24-day culture period. Accordingly, this study aimed to examine whether NPGP genes were expressed on the way to eosinophil terminal differentiation stage and to compare their expression kinetics with that of genes encoding eosinophil-specific granule proteins (ESGPs). Transcripts of all NPGP genes examined, including proteinase 3, myeloperoxidase, cathepsin G (CTSG), and neutrophil elastase, reached a peak at day 12 and sharply declined thereafter, while transcript of ESGP genes including major basic protein 1 (MBP1) attained maximum expression at days 18 or 24. Growth factor independent 1 (GFI1) and CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein α (C/EBPA), transactivators for the NPGP genes, were expressed immediately before the NPGP genes, whereas expression of C/EBPA, GATA1, and GATA2 kinetically paralleled that of eosinophil granule protein genes. The expression kinetics of NPGPs and ESGPs were duplicated upon differentiation of the eosinophilic leukemia cell line (EoL-1) immature eosinophilic cells. Importantly, confocal image analysis showed that CTSG was strongly coexpressed with MBP1 in differentiating CB eosinophils at days 12 and 18 and became barely detectable at day 24 and beyond. Our results suggest for the first time the presence of an immature stage where eosinophils coexpress NPGPs and ESGPs before final maturation.
Zebrafish embryos are useful to study haematopoietic gene function in vertebrates, although lack of antibodies to zebrafish proteins has limited the purification of specific cell populations. Here, we purified primitive zebrafish erythrocytes using 1, 5-bis{[2-(di-methylamino)ethyl]amino}-4, 8-dihydroxyanthracene-9, 10-dione (DRAQ5TM ), a DNA-staining fluorescent dye. At 48-h post-fertilization, we sorted small-sized cells from embryos using forward scatter and found that they consisted of DRAQ5high and DRAQ5low populations. DRAQ5high cells contained haemoglobin, lacked myeloperoxidase activity and expressed high levels of embryonic globin (hbae3 and hbbe1.1) mRNA, all characteristics of primitive erythrocytes. Following DRAQ5TM analysis of gata1:dsRed transgenic embryos, we purified primitive DRAQ5high dsRed+ erythrocytes from haematopoietic progenitor cells. Using this method, we identified docking protein 2 (Dok2) as functioning in differentiation of primitive erythrocytes. We conclude that DRAQ5TM -based flow cytometry enables purification of primitive zebrafish erythrocytes.
The hypernomic autophagy is associated with various cardiovascular diseases. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are emerging as important regulators in gene expression, which have been involved in multiple physiological and pathological processes. However, the function of lncRNAs and how they functioned in the autophagy in cardiomyocytes were rarely reported. In this study, we report that a lncRNA, named GATA1 activated lncRNA (Galont), can directly interact with miR-338 and promote ATG5-mediated autophagic cell death in murine cardiomyocytes. First, we found that Galont was upregulated by anoxia/reoxygenation (A/R) stimulus, and it was able to promote autophagy and cell death in cardiomyocytes exposure to A/R. Then, miR-338 was identified as a novel suppressor in autophagy and autophagic cell death. Our results from bioinformatic analysis and luciferase reporter gene assay indicated that ATG5 is a target gene of miR-338. Furthermore, RNA pull-down assays demonstrated that Galont directly interacted with miR-338, and thus promoted ATG5 expression and autophagic cell death. Our findings reveal a novel regulatory circuit in the autophagy in cardiomyocytes, which consists of Galont, miR-338 and ATG5.
Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are a group of myeloid hematological malignancies, with a high risk of progression to acute myeloid leukemia (AML). To explore the role of acquired mutations in MDS, 111 MDS-associated genes were screened using next-generation sequencing (NGS), in 125 patients. One or more mutations were detected in 84% of the patients. Some gene mutations are specific for MDS and were associated with disease subtypes, and the patterns of mutational pathways could be associated with progressive MDS. The patterns, frequencies and functional pathways of gene mutations are different, but somehow related, between MDS and AML. Multivariate analysis suggested that patients with ≥ 2 mutations had poor progression-free survival, while GATA1/GATA2, DNMT3A and KRAS/NRAS mutations were associated with poor overall survival. Based on a novel system combining IPSS-R and molecular markers, these MDS patients were further divided into 3 more accurate prognostic subgroups. A panel of 11 target genes was proposed for genetic profiling of MDS. The study offers new insights into the molecular signatures of MDS and the genetic consistency between MDS and AML. Furthermore, results indicate that MDS could be classified by mutation combinations to guide the administration of individualized therapeutic interventions.
The compromise of blood brain barrier (BBB) integrity is often associated with human hemorrhage stroke and neurodegeneration diseases, including retina diseases, such as age-related macular degeneration and diabetic retinopathy. Brain pericytes play pivotal roles in regulation and maintenance of BBB integrity. However, the mechanisms underlying brain pericyte development to establish BBB integrity remain unclear.
Zebrafish transgenic lines Tg(flk1:GFP; gata1:dsRed), Tg(flk1:GFP), Tg(fli1:GFP) and Tg(BRE:GFP) were used in this work. The functional studies of bmp3 were performed by mopholino oligonucleotide (MO) injection, dye-based permeability assay, RT-PCR, in vivo imaging, immunofluorescence staining and statics analysis.
Here we report that bmp3 regulates BBB integrity in zebrafish brain by promoting pericyte development. Knockdown of bmp3 with injection of bmp3-MO causes intracerebral hemorrhage in zebrafish embryos. Meanwhile, disruption of bmp3 function by bmp3-MO injection impairs cerebral pericyte coverage in zebrafish embryos. Mechanistically, knockdown of bmp3 disrupts the pattern and activities of BMP signaling in zebrafish brain, thus probably disrupting the balance of TGFβ/BMP signaling in zebrafish embryos.
In summary, our data shows that bmp3 regulates BBB integrity potentially by promoting pericyte development.
Erythropoiesis is the complex, dynamic, and tightly regulated process that generates all mature red blood cells. To understand this process, we mapped the developmental trajectories of progenitors from wild-type, erythropoietin-treated, and Flvcr1-deleted mice at single-cell resolution. Importantly, we linked the quantity of each cell's surface proteins to its total transcriptome, which is a novel method. Deletion of Flvcr1 results in high levels of intracellular heme, allowing us to identify heme-regulated circuitry. Our studies demonstrate that in early erythroid cells (CD71+Ter119neg-lo), heme increases ribosomal protein transcripts, suggesting that heme, in addition to upregulating globin transcription and translation, guarantees ample ribosomes for globin synthesis. In later erythroid cells (CD71+Ter119lo-hi), heme decreases GATA1, GATA1-target gene, and mitotic spindle gene expression. These changes occur quickly. For example, in confirmatory studies using human marrow erythroid cells, ribosomal protein transcripts and proteins increase, and GATA1 transcript and protein decrease, within 15 to 30 minutes of amplifying endogenous heme synthesis with aminolevulinic acid. Because GATA1 initiates heme synthesis, GATA1 and heme together direct red cell maturation, and heme stops GATA1 synthesis, our observations reveal a GATA1-heme autoregulatory loop and implicate GATA1 and heme as the comaster regulators of the normal erythroid differentiation program. In addition, as excessive heme could amplify ribosomal protein imbalance, prematurely lower GATA1, and impede mitosis, these data may help explain the ineffective (early termination of) erythropoiesis in Diamond Blackfan anemia and del(5q) myelodysplasia, disorders with excessive heme in colony-forming unit-erythroid/proerythroblasts, explain why these anemias are macrocytic, and show why children with GATA1 mutations have DBA-like clinical phenotypes.
The GATA family of DNA binding proteins consists of six different transcription factors (GATA1-6), each with a diverse biologic function. The transcription factors GATA1-3 function primarily to orchestrate hematopoiesis; however, they have roles in non-hematopoietic cells as well. Much of our current knowledge of the GATA transcription factors has come through observation of disease states with known GATA mutations. The GATA2 protein has been shown to be vital for proliferation and maintenance of hematopoietic stem cells; mutations result in variable phenotypes including myelodysplastic syndrome. We present a case of a 19-year-old male with a history of pancytopenia and hypocellular bone marrow with dysplastic morphologic changes who underwent an extensive workup to determine an etiology. Molecular testing identified a germline GATA2 c.1081 C&gt;T heterozygous mutation, allowing his case to be classified as the World Health Organization (WHO) entity: myeloid neoplasm with germline GATA2 mutation.
The distribution of RBC antigens, which define blood group types, differs among populations. In contrast to many world populations, blood group profiles for Indigenous Australians have not been well studied. As it is now possible to predict comprehensive blood group antigen profiles from genomic data sets, we aimed to apply this for Indigenous Australians and to provide a comparison to other major world populations.
Whole exome sequence data for 72 Western Desert Indigenous Australians was provided by the Telethon Kids Institute. Variants (against hg19) were annotated using computer software (ANNOVAR, Qiagen Bioinformatics) and filtered to include only variants in genes for 36 blood group systems, and the transcription factors KLF1 and GATA1. The RHCE*C allele and RHD zygosity were identified by copy number variant analysis of sequence alignments. The impact of missense variants was investigated in silico using a meta-predictor of disease-causing variants (Meta-SNP).
For 21 blood group systems the predicted blood group antigen frequencies were comparable to those for other major world populations. For 13 systems, interesting points of contrast were identified. Furthermore, we identified 12 novel variants, one novel D allele, and four rare variants with potential clinical significance.
This is the first systematic assessment of genomic data to elucidate blood group antigen profiles for Indigenous Australians who are linguistically and culturally diverse. Our study paves the way to understanding the geographic distribution of blood group variants in different Indigenous groups and the associated RBC phenotypes. This in turn is expected to guide transfusion practice for Indigenous individuals.
Elavl1 (also known as HuR), an RNA binding protein highly conserved between zebrafish and human, regulates gene expression by stabilizing target mRNA. Our previous studies have uncovered that the predominant isoform elavl1a is required for zebrafish embryonic erythropoiesis. However, the exact mechanism of how elav11 spatiotemporally stabilizes target mRNAs to regulate specific erythropoiesis is not yet understood. Here we show that phosphorylation of elavl1a at Ser219 and Ser316 by PKC is necessarily required for cytosolic shuttling from the nucleus to stabilize gata1 mRNA and thus promotes erythropoiesis. Knockdown of elavl1a resulted in the hindrance of erythropoiesis and Hemin-induced erythroid differentiation of human myeloid leukemia K562 cells. Interestingly, inhibition of PKC reproduced the phenotype seen during zebrafish embryogenesis and erythroid differentiation of myeloid leukemia. Mechanistically, Hemin induced elavl1a export from nuclear to cytoplasmic space in K562 cells in a manner dependent on phosphorylation on Ser219 and Ser316, as overexpression of elavl1a with mutations on Ser219 and Ser316 resulted in erythropoiesis failure. Additionally, co-administration of low doses of elavl1a morpholino (MO) and three PKC inhibitors showed a combined effect in zebrafish embryonic erythropoiesis dysplasia. In conclusion, our study reveals that PKC-mediated phosphorylation of elavl1a at Ser219 and Ser316 sites controls its nucleo-cytoplasmic translocation in zebrafish, thereby regulating embryonic erythropoiesis.
The ability of transcriptional regulators to drive lineage conversion of somatic cells offers great potential for the treatment of human disease. To explore the concept of switching on specific target genes in heterologous cells, we developed a model system to screen candidate factors for their ability to activate the archetypal megakaryocyte-specific chemokine platelet factor 4 (PF4) in fibroblasts. We found that co-expression of the transcriptional regulators GATA1 and FLI1 resulted in a significant increase in levels of PF4, which became magnified over time. This finding demonstrates that such combinations can be used to produce potentially beneficial chemokines in readily available heterologous cell types.
Molecular testing of congenital coagulation and platelet disorders offers confirmation of clinical diagnoses, supports genetic counselling, and enables predictive and prenatal diagnosis. In some cases, genotype-phenotype correlations are important for predicting the clinical course of the disease and adaptation of individualized therapy. Until recently, genotyping has been mainly performed by Sanger sequencing. While next generation sequencing (NGS) enables the parallel analysis of multiple genes, the cost-value ratio of custom-made panels can be unfavorable for analyses of specific small genes. The aim of this study was to transfer genotyping of small genes involved in congenital coagulation and platelet disorders from Sanger sequencing to an NGS-based method. A LR-PCR approach for target enrichment of the entire genomic regions of the genes F7, F10, F11, F12, GATA1, MYH9, TUBB1 and WAS was combined with high-throughput sequencing on a MiSeq platform. NGS detected all variants that had previously been identified by Sanger sequencing. Our results demonstrate that this approach is an accurate and flexible tool for molecular genetic diagnostics of single small genes.
Die molekulare Diagnostik hereditärer Gerinnungs- und Thrombozytenstörungen ermöglicht die Bestätigung einer klinischen Verdachtsdiagnose, ist aber auch für die genetische Beratung und die prädiktive und pränatale Diagnostik notwendig. In einigen Fällen ist eine Genotyp-Phänotyp-Korrelation für die Prognose des klinischen Krankheitsverlaufs wichtig und erlaubt eine individuelle Therapieplanung. Im Gegensatz zur Sanger-Sequenzierung ermöglicht Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) die parallele Analyse mehrerer Gene. Allerdings kann das Kosten-Nutzen-Verhältnis von großen Genpanels für die Analyse spezifischer kleiner Gene ungünstig sein. Ziel dieser Studie war es, die Genotypisierung kleiner Gene für hereditäre Gerinnungs- und Thrombozytenstörungen von der Sanger-Sequenzierung auf eine NGS-basierte Methode umzustellen. Zu diesem Zweck wurde ein LR-PCR-Ansatz zur Anreicherung der gesamten genomischen Regionen der Gene F7, F10, F11, F12, GATA1, MYH9, TUBB1 und WAS mit einer Hochdurchsatzsequenzierung auf einer MiSeq-Plattform kombiniert. Mit dieser Methode konnten alle durch Sanger-Sequenzierung identifizierten Veränderungen sicher nachgewiesen werden. Unsere Ergebnisse zeigen, dass dieser Ansatz ein präzises und flexibles Werkzeug in der molekulargenetischen Diagnostik einzelner kleiner Gene sein könnte.
End-stage renal disease (ESRD) is the final stage of chronic kidney disease in which the kidney is not sufficient to meet the needs of daily life. It is necessary to understand the role of genes expression involved in ESRD patient responses to nocturnal hemodialysis (NHD) and to improve the immunity responsiveness. The aim of this study was to investigate novel immune-associated genes that may play important roles in patients with ESRD.The microarray expression profiles of peripheral blood in patients with ESRD before and after NHD were analyzed by network-based approaches, and then using Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analysis to explore the biological process and molecular functions of differentially expressed genes. Subsequently, a transcriptional regulatory network of the core genes and the connected transcriptional regulators was constructed. We found that NHD had a significant effect on neutrophil activation and immune response in patients with ESRD.In addition, Our findings suggest that MAPKAPK3, RHOA, ARRB2, FLOT1, MYH9, PRKCD, RHOG, PTPN6, MAPK3, CNPY3, PI3KCG, and PYGL genes maybe potential targets regulated by core transcriptional factors, including ARNT, C/EBPalpha, CEBPA, CREB1, PSG1, DAND5, SP1, GATA1, MYC, EGR2, and EGR3.
Hematologic responses to hypomethylating agents are often delayed in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome or acute myeloid leukemia. Fetal hemoglobin is a potential novel bio-marker of response: recently, we demonstrated that a high fetal hemoglobin level prior to decitabine treatment was associated with superior outcome. Here we investigated whether early fetal hemoglobin induction during decitabine treatment also had prognostic value, and studied the potential of decitabine to induce erythroid differentiation and fetal hemoglobin expression in vitro Fetal hemoglobin levels were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography in patients with higher-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (n=16) and acute myeloid leukemia (n=37) before treatment and after each course of decitabine. Levels above 1.0% were considered induced. Patients achieving complete or partial remission as best response had attained a median fetal hemoglobin of 1.9% after two courses of treatment, whereas the median value in patients who did not reach complete or partial remission was 0.8% (P=0.015). Fetal hemoglobin induction after two courses of decitabine treatment was associated with early platelet doubling (P=0.006), and its subsequent decrease with hematologic relapse. In patients with myelodysplastic syndrome, induction of fetal hemoglobin after course 2 of treatment was associated with longer overall survival: median of 22.9 versus 7.3 months in patients with or without induction of fetal hemoglobin, respectively [hazard ratio=0.2 (95% confidence interval: 0.1-0.9); P=0.03]. In vitro decitabine treatment of two bi-potential myeloid leukemia cell lines (K562 and HEL) resulted in induction of an erythroid (not megakaryocytic) differentiation program, and of fetal hemoglobin mRNA and protein, associated with GATA1 gene demethylation and upregulation. In conclusion, fetal hemoglobin may provide a useful dynamic biomarker during hypomethylating agent therapy in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome or acute myeloid leukemia.
Diamond-Blackfan anemia (DBA) is a severe congenital hypoplastic anemia caused by mutation in a ribosomal protein gene. Major clinical issues concern the optimal management of patients resistant to steroids, the first-line therapy. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is indicated in young patients with an HLA-matched unaffected sibling donor, and recent results with matched unrelated donor transplants indicate that these patients also do well. When neither steroids nor a transplant is possible red cell transfusions are required, and iron loading is rapid in some DBA patients, so effective chelation is vital. Also discussed are novel treatments under investigation for DBA.

                        Purpose:
                     Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) play an important role in the proliferation and differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) in the bone marrow via cell-to-cell contact, as well as secretion of cytokines and microvesicles (MVs). In this study, we investigated the effect of mesenchymal stem cell-derived microvesicles (MSC-MVs) on erythroid differentiation of umbilical cord blood-derived CD34+ cells. 
                        Methods:
                     In this descriptive study, CD34+ cells were cultured with mixture of SCF (10 ng/ml) and rhEPO (5 U/ml) cytokines in complete IMDM medium as positive control group. Then, in MV1- and MV2-groups, microvesicles at 10 and 20 µg/ml concentration were added. After 72 hours, erythroid specific markers (CD71 and CD235a) and genes (HBG1, GATA1, FOG1 and NFE2) were assessed by flow cytometry and qRT-PCR, respectively. 
                        Results:
                     The expression of specific markers of the erythroid lineages (CD71 and GPA) in the presence of different concentration of microvesicles were lower than that of the control group (P&lt;0.001). Also, the expression of specific genes of the erythroid lineages (NFE2, FOG1, GATA1, and HBG1) was investigated in comparison to the internal control (GAPDH). Among all of them, HBG1 and FOG1 genes were significantly decreased to the control group (P&lt;0.0001) but GATA1 and NFE2 gene expressions was not significant. 
                        Conclusion:
                     The results of this study showed that MSC-MVs decrease the erythroid differentiation of umbilical cord blood-derived CD34+ cells. Therefore, MSC-MVs play a key role in the regulation of normal erythropoiesis.
Acute megakaryoblastic leukemia (AMegL) is a rare hematological neoplasm most often diagnosed in children and is commonly associated with Down's syndrome (DS). Although AMegLs are specifically characterized and typically diagnosed by megakaryoblastic expansion, recent advancements in molecular analysis have highlighted the heterogeneity of this disease, with specific cytogenic and genetic alterations characterizing different disease subtypes. Areas covered: This review will focus on describing recurrent molecular variations in both DS and non-DS pediatric AMegL, their role in promoting leukemogenesis, their association with different clinical aspects and prognosis, and finally, their influence on future treatment strategies with a number of specific drugs beyond conventional chemotherapy already under development. Expert opinion: Deep understanding of the genetic and molecular landscape of AMegL will lead to better and more precise disease classification in terms of diagnosis, prognosis, and possible targeted therapies. Development of new therapeutic approaches based on these molecular characteristics will hopefully improve AMegL patient outcomes.
Transient abnormal myelopoiesis is a hematopoietic disorder that occurs in up to 10% of neonates with Down syndrome. It is characterized by leukocytosis and the presence of circulating blast cells harboring truncating GATA1 mutations with variable multiorgan system involvement. Placental involvement of transient abnormal myelopoiesis is infrequently described. Placental examination and identifying features related to transient abnormal myelopoiesis could be one of the early, if not the only, means of diagnosis of this condition in affected stillbirths, premature infants, and a subset of asymptomatic neonates. This article provides an overview of the placental pathology in transient abnormal myelopoiesis with review of the literature, and also discusses the important differential diagnoses.
To analyze the clinical and molecular biological characteristics of a neonate with myeloid proliferation related to Down syndrome (DS).
The neonate, who was suspected for Down syndrome, was analyzed in terms of clinical feature, peripheral blood cell morphology, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), immunological classification and other laboratory tests. On hundred and fourteen leukemia-related genes were subjected to next-generation sequencing (NGS).
Laboratory test revealed obvious abnormal liver function and coagulation function, anemia, and extreme leukocytosis. Cell smear indicated significantly increased progenitor cells, which conformed to proliferation of megakaryocytes. FISH showed trisomy 21. By NGS, c.220+dupT, a novel mutation, was identified in exon 2 of the GATA1 gene, which encodes a N-terminal activation domain and has a frequency of 95.8%. No mutation was identified among the remaining 113 genes.
The neonate had DS and GATA1 gene mutation. High percentage of circulating blasts should be considered as transient myelodysplasia but not congenital leukemia.
The GATA family of DNA binding proteins consists of six different transcription factors (GATA1-6), each with diverse biologic function. The GATA2 protein has been shown to be vital for proliferation and maintenance of hematopoietic stem cells; mutations result in variable phenotypes including myelodysplastic syndrome.
Re-expression of the paralogous γ-globin genes (HBG1/2) could be a universal strategy to ameliorate the severe β-globin disorders sickle cell disease (SCD) and β-thalassemia by induction of fetal hemoglobin (HbF, α2γ2)1. Previously, we and others have shown that core sequences at the BCL11A erythroid enhancer are required for repression of HbF in adult-stage erythroid cells but are dispensable in non-erythroid cells2-6. CRISPR-Cas9-mediated gene modification has demonstrated variable efficiency, specificity, and persistence in hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). Here, we demonstrate that Cas9:sgRNA ribonucleoprotein (RNP)-mediated cleavage within a GATA1 binding site at the +58 BCL11A erythroid enhancer results in highly penetrant disruption of this motif, reduction of BCL11A expression, and induction of fetal γ-globin. We optimize conditions for selection-free on-target editing in patient-derived HSCs as a nearly complete reaction lacking detectable genotoxicity or deleterious impact on stem cell function. HSCs preferentially undergo non-homologous compared with microhomology-mediated end joining repair. Erythroid progeny of edited engrafting SCD HSCs express therapeutic levels of HbF and resist sickling, while those from patients with β-thalassemia show restored globin chain balance. Non-homologous end joining repair-based BCL11A enhancer editing approaching complete allelic disruption in HSCs is a practicable therapeutic strategy to produce durable HbF induction.
Ubiquitination is an enzymatic post-translational modification that affects protein fate. The ubiquitin-proteasome system was first discovered in reticulocytes where it plays important roles in reticulocyte maturation. Recent studies have revealed that ubiquitination is a dynamic and reversible process and that deubiquitylases are capable of removing ubiquitin from their protein substrates. Given the fact that the ubiquitin-proteasome system is highly active in reticulocytes, it is speculated that deubiquitylases may play important roles in erythropoiesis. Yet, the role of deubiquitylases in erythropoiesis remains largely unexplored. In the present study, we report that the expression of deubiquitylase USP7 is significantly increased during human terminal erythroid differentiation. We further show that interfering with USP7 function either by shRNA mediated knockdown or USP7 specific inhibitors impaired human terminal erythroid differentiation due to decreased GATA1 level and restoration of GATA levels rescues the differentiation defect. Mechanistically, USP7 deficiency led to decreased GATA1 protein level that can be reversed by proteasome inhibitors. Furthermore, USP7 interacts directly with GATA1 and catalyzes the removal of K48-linked polyubiquitylation chains conjugated onto GATA1, thereby stabilizing GATA1 protein. Collectively, our findings have identified an important role of a deubiquitylase in human terminal erythroid differentiation by stabilizing GATA1, the master regulator of erythropoiesis.
The limited number of hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) within a single unit of human cord blood currently limits its use as an alternate graft source. However, we have developed a strategy using 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5azaD) and trichostatin A (TSA), which expands transplantable HSC 7- to 10-fold. In our current studies, we have assessed the allostimulatory capacity of the 5azaD/TSA-expanded grafts. The coexpression of immunophenotypic dendritic cell (DC) markers, such as HLA-DR/CD86 and HLA-DR/CD11c as determined by flow cytometry, and the allostimulatory capacity of 5azaD/TSA-expanded cells as determined by MLC were both significantly lower than control. It has been previously demonstrated that STAT3 is indispensable for the differentiation of DC from HSC. Real-time quantitative PCR analysis revealed that 5azaD/TSA-expanded cells expressed more STAT3 transcript than control while also expressing increased transcripts for STAT3 inhibitors including SHP1, p21, and GATA1. Western blot analysis indicates that chromatin-modifying agent-expanded grafts displayed a reduced ratio of p-STAT3 to total STAT3 than control cultures, which is likely indicative of STAT3 inactivity in 5azD/TSA-expanded grafts. Culturing 5azaD/TSA-expanded cord blood cells in extended cultures reveals that they are still capable of generating DC. Notably, STAT3 inactivity was transient because the transcript levels of STAT3 and its inhibitors, including SHP1, were comparable between 5azaD/TSA and control cultures following extended culture. Taken together, our studies indicate that the reduced allostimulatory capacity of 5azaD/TSA-expanded cells is likely because of reversible inhibition of STAT3-dependent DC differentiation. These results suggest that a graft composed of 5azaD/TSA-expanded cells possesses relatively less allostimulatory response but is still capable of generating DC in permissive conditions.
Diamond-Blackfan anemia (DBA) in its classic form is characterized by a profound normochromic and usually macrocytic anemia with normal leukocytes and platelets, congenital malformations in up to 50% of affected individuals, and growth retardation in 30% of affected individuals. The hematologic complications occur in 90% of affected individuals during the first year of life. The phenotypic spectrum ranges from a mild form (e.g., mild anemia, no anemia with only subtle erythroid abnormalities, physical malformations without anemia) to a severe form of fetal anemia resulting in nonimmune hydrops fetalis. DBA is associated with an increased risk for acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), and solid tumors including osteogenic sarcoma.
The diagnosis is established in a proband when all four of the following diagnostic criteria are present: Age younger than one year. Macrocytic anemia with no other significant cytopenias. Reticulocytopenia. Normal marrow cellularity with a paucity of erythroid precursors. Other causes of bone marrow failure (e.g., Fanconi anemia, Pearson syndrome, dyskeratosis congenita, human immunodeficiency virus infection) need to be considered and ruled out as appropriate. DBA has been associated with pathogenic variants in 19 genes that encode ribosomal proteins and in GATA1 and TSR2. A pathogenic variant in one of these 21 genes is identified in approximately 65% of individuals with DBA.
Treatment of manifestations: Corticosteroid treatment, recommended in children older than age 12 months, initially improves the red blood cell count in approximately 80% of affected individuals. Chronic transfusion with packed red blood cells is initially necessary while the diagnosis is made and in those not responsive to corticosteroids. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), the only curative therapy for the hematologic manifestations of DBA, is often recommended for those who are transfusion dependent or develop other cytopenias. Treatment of malignancies should be coordinated by an oncologist. Chemotherapy must be given cautiously as it may lead to prolonged cytopenia and subsequent toxicities. Prevention of secondary complications: Transfusion-related iron overload is the most common complication in transfusion-dependent individuals. Iron chelation therapy with deferasirox orally or desferrioxamine subcutaneously is recommended after ten to 12 transfusions. Corticosteroid-related side effects must also be closely monitored, especially as related to risk for infection, growth retardation, and loss of bone density in growing children. Often individuals will be placed on transfusion therapy if these side effects are intolerable. Surveillance: Complete blood counts several times a year; bone marrow aspirate/biopsy periodically to evaluate morphology and cellularity in the event of another cytopenia or a change in response to treatment. In steroid-dependent individuals: monitor blood pressure and (in children) growth. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Deferiprone for the treatment of iron overload, which has led to severe neutropenia in a few individuals with DBA; infection (especially those on corticosteroids). Evaluation of relatives at risk: Molecular genetic testing of at-risk relatives of a proband with a known pathogenic variant allows for early diagnosis and appropriate monitoring for bone marrow failure, physical abnormalities, and related cancers.
DBA is most often inherited in an autosomal dominant manner; GATA1-related and TSR2-related DBA are inherited in an X-linked manner. Approximately 40% to 45% of individuals with autosomal dominant DBA have inherited the pathogenic variant from a parent; approximately 55% to 60% have a de novo pathogenic variant. Each child of an individual with autosomal dominant DBA has a 50% chance of inheriting the pathogenic variant. Males with GATA1- or TSR2-related DBA pass the pathogenic variant to all of their daughters and none of their sons. Women heterozygous for a GATA1 or TSR2 pathogenic variant have a 50% chance of transmitting the pathogenic variant in each pregnancy: males who inherit the pathogenic variant will be affected; females who inherit the pathogenic variant will be carriers and will usually not be affected. Carrier testing of at-risk female relatives is possible if the GATA1 or TSR2 pathogenic variant has been identified in the family. Prenatal testing for pregnancies at increased risk is possible if the familial pathogenic variant has been identified.
In the last few years, the advent of new technological approaches has led to a better knowledge of the ontogeny of erythropoiesis during development and of the journey leading from hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) to mature red blood cells (RBCs). Our view of a well-defined hierarchical model of hematopoiesis with a near-homogeneous HSC population residing at the apex has been progressively challenged in favor of a landscape where HSCs themselves are highly heterogeneous and lineages separate earlier than previously thought. The coordination of these events is orchestrated by transcription factors (TFs) that work in a combinatorial manner to activate and/or repress their target genes. The development of next generation sequencing (NGS) has facilitated the identification of pathological mutations involving TFs underlying hematological defects. The examples of GATA1 and KLF1 presented in this review suggest that in the next few years the number of TF mutations associated with dyserythropoietic disorders will further increase.

Trypanosoma carassii is a flagellated bloodstream parasite of cyprinid fish with pathogenesis manifesting primarily as anemia in experimentally infected fish. This anemia is characterized by decreases in the number of circulating red blood cells (RBCs) during peak parasitemia. We examined changes in the key blood metrics and expression of genes known to be important in the regulation of erythropoiesis. Increasing parasitemia was strongly correlated with an overall decrease in the total number of circulating RBCs. Gene expression of key erythropoiesis regulators (EPO, EPOR, GATA1, Lmo2, and HIFα) and proinflammatory cytokines (IFNγ and TNFα) were measured and their expressions differed from those in fish made anemic by injections of phenylhydrazine (PHZ). Significant upregulation of pro-erythropoietic genes was observed in PHZ-induced anemia, but not during peak parasitic infection. Previously, we reported on functional characterization of goldfish erythropoietin (rgEPO) and its ability to induce survival and differentiation of erythroid progenitor cells in vitro. Treatment of goldfish during the infection with rgEPO reduced the severity of anemia but failed to fully prevent the onset of the anemic state in infected fish. Proinflammatory cytokines have been implicated in the suppression of erythropoiesis during trypanosomiasis, specifically the cytokines TNFα, IFNγ, and IL-1β. Analysis of key proinflammatory cytokines revealed that mRNA levels of IFNγ and TNFα were upregulated in response to infection, but only TNFα increased in response to PHZ treatment. Synergistic activity of the proinflammatory cytokines may be required to sustain prolonged anemia. These findings provide insight into the relationship between T. carassii and host anemia and suggest that T. carassii may directly or indirectly suppress host erythropoiesis.
Recently, new genes and molecular mechanisms have been identified in patients with porphyrias and sideroblastic anemias (SA). They all modulate either directly or indirectly the δ-aminolevulinic acid synthase (ALAS) activity. ALAS, is encoded by two genes: the erythroid-specific (ALAS2), and the ubiquitously expressed (ALAS1). In the liver, ALAS1 controls the rate-limiting step in the production of heme and hemoproteins that are rapidly turned over in response to metabolic needs. Several heme regulatory targets have been identified as regulators of ALAS1 activity: 1) transcriptional repression via a heme-responsive element, 2) post-transcriptional destabilization of ALAS1 mRNA, 3) post-translational inhibition via a heme regulatory motif, 4) direct inhibition of the activity of the enzyme and 5) breakdown of ALAS1 protein via heme-mediated induction of the protease Lon peptidase 1. In erythroid cells, ALAS2 is a gatekeeper of production of very large amounts of heme necessary for hemoglobin synthesis. The rate of ALAS2 synthesis is transiently increased during the period of active heme synthesis. Its gene expression is determined by trans-activation of nuclear factor GATA1, CACC box and NF-E2-binding sites in the promoter areas. ALAS2 mRNA translation is also regulated by the iron-responsive element (IRE)/iron regulatory proteins (IRP) binding system. In patients, ALAS enzyme activity is affected in most of the mutations causing non-syndromic SA and in several porphyrias. Decreased ALAS2 activity results either directly from loss-of-function ALAS2 mutations as seen in X-linked sideroblastic anemia (XLSA) or from defect in the availability of one of its two mitochondrial substrates: glycine in SLC25A38 mutations and succinyl CoA in GLRX5 mutations. Moreover, ALAS2 gain of function mutations is responsible for X-linked protoporphyria and increased ALAS1 activity lead to acute attacks of hepatic porphyrias. A missense dominant mutation in the Walker A motif of the ATPase binding site in the gene coding for the mitochondrial protein unfoldase CLPX also contributes to increasing ALAS and subsequently protoporphyrinemia. Altogether, these recent data on human ALAS have informed our understanding of porphyrias and sideroblastic anemias pathogeneses and may contribute to new therapeutic strategies.
Diamond-Blackfan anemia (DBA) is a congenital erythroblastopenia that is characterized by a blockade in erythroid differentiation related to impaired ribosome biogenesis. DBA phenotype and genotype are highly heterogeneous. We have previously identified 2 in vitro erythroid cell growth phenotypes for primary CD34+ cells from DBA patients and following short hairpin RNA knockdown of RPS19, RPL5, and RPL11 expression in normal human CD34+ cells. The haploinsufficient RPS19 in vitro phenotype is less severe than that of 2 other ribosomal protein (RP) mutant genes. We further documented that proteasomal degradation of HSP70, the chaperone of GATA1, is a major contributor to the defect in erythroid proliferation, delayed erythroid differentiation, increased apoptosis, and decreased globin expression, which are all features of the RPL5 or RPL11 DBA phenotype. In the present study, we explored the hypothesis that an imbalance between globin and heme synthesis may be involved in pure red cell aplasia of DBA. We identified disequilibrium between the globin chain and the heme synthesis in erythroid cells of DBA patients. This imbalance led to accumulation of excess free heme and increased reactive oxygen species production that was more pronounced in cells of the RPL5 or RPL11 phenotype. Strikingly, rescue experiments with wild-type HSP70 restored GATA1 expression levels, increased globin synthesis thereby reducing free heme excess and resulting in decreased apoptosis of DBA erythroid cells. These results demonstrate the involvement of heme in DBA pathophysiology and a major role of HSP70 in the control of balanced heme/globin synthesis.
The derivation of kidney tissues from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) and its application for replacement therapy in end-stage renal disease have been widely discussed. Here we report that consecutive transfections of two sets of synthetic mRNAs encoding transcription factors can induce rapid and efficient differentiation of hPSCs into kidney tissues, termed induced nephron-like organoids (iNephLOs). The first set - FIGLA, PITX2, ASCL1 and TFAP2C, differentiated hPSCs into SIX2+SALL1+ nephron progenitor cells with 92% efficiency within 2 days. Subsequently, the second set - HNF1A, GATA3, GATA1 and EMX2, differentiated these cells into PAX8+LHX1+ pretubular aggregates in another 2 days. Further culture in both 2-dimensional and 3-dimensional conditions produced iNephLOs containing cells characterized as podocytes, proximal tubules, and distal tubules in an additional 10 days. Global gene expression profiles showed similarities between iNephLOs and the human adult kidney, suggesting possible uses of iNephLOs as in vitro models for kidneys.
Congenital erythropoietic porphyria (CEP) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by photosensitivity and by hematologic abnormalities in affected individuals. CEP is caused by mutations in the uroporphyrinogen synthase (UROS) gene. In three reported cases, CEP has been associated with a specific X-linked GATA1 mutation. Disease-causing mutations in either gene result in absent or markedly reduced UROS enzymatic activity. This in turn leads to the accumulation of the non-physiologic and photoreactive porphyrinogens, uroporphyrinogen I and coproporphyrinogen I, which damage erythrocytes and elicit a phototoxic reaction upon light exposure. The clinical spectrum of CEP depends on the level of residual UROS activity, which is determined by the underlying pathogenic loss-of-function UROS mutations. Disease severity ranges from non-immune hydrops fetalis in utero to late-onset disease with only mild cutaneous involvement. The clinical characteristics of CEP include exquisite photosensitivity to visible light resulting in bullous vesicular lesions which, when infected lead to progressive photomutilation of sun-exposed areas such as the face and hands. In addition, patients have erythrodontia (brownish discoloration of teeth) and can develop corneal scarring. Chronic transfusion-dependent hemolytic anemia is common and leads to bone marrow hyperplasia, which further increases porphyrin production. Management of CEP consists of strict avoidance of exposure to visible light with sun-protective clothing, sunglasses, and car and home window filters. Adequate care of ruptured vesicles and use of topical antibiotics is indicated to prevent superinfections and osteolysis. In patients with symptomatic hemolytic anemia, frequent erythrocyte cell transfusions may be necessary to suppress hematopoiesis and decrease marrow production of the phototoxic porphyrins. In severe transfection-dependent cases, bone marrow or hematopoietic stem cell transplantation has been performed, which is curative. Therapeutic approaches including gene therapy, proteasome inhibition, and pharmacologic chaperones are under investigation.
Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second most common cause of cancer-related death in the world, but early diagnosis ameliorates the survival of CRC. This report aimed to identify molecular biomarker signatures in CRC. We analyzed two microarray datasets (GSE35279 and GSE21815) from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) to identify mutual differentially expressed genes (DEGs). We integrated DEGs with protein⁻protein interaction and transcriptional/post-transcriptional regulatory networks to identify reporter signaling and regulatory molecules; utilized functional overrepresentation and pathway enrichment analyses to elucidate their roles in biological processes and molecular pathways; performed survival analyses to evaluate their prognostic performance; and applied drug repositioning analyses through Connectivity Map (CMap) and geneXpharma tools to hypothesize possible drug candidates targeting reporter molecules. A total of 727 upregulated and 99 downregulated DEGs were detected. The PI3K/Akt signaling, Wnt signaling, extracellular matrix (ECM) interaction, and cell cycle were identified as significantly enriched pathways. Ten hub proteins (ADNP, CCND1, CD44, CDK4, CEBPB, CENPA, CENPH, CENPN, MYC, and RFC2), 10 transcription factors (ETS1, ESR1, GATA1, GATA2, GATA3, AR, YBX1, FOXP3, E2F4, and PRDM14) and two microRNAs (miRNAs) (miR-193b-3p and miR-615-3p) were detected as reporter molecules. The survival analyses through Kaplan⁻Meier curves indicated remarkable performance of reporter molecules in the estimation of survival probability in CRC patients. In addition, several drug candidates including anti-neoplastic and immunomodulating agents were repositioned. This study presents biomarker signatures at protein and RNA levels with prognostic capability in CRC. We think that the molecular signatures and candidate drugs presented in this study might be useful in future studies indenting the development of accurate diagnostic and/or prognostic biomarker screens and efficient therapeutic strategies in CRC.
β-hemoglobinopathies, such as sickle cell disease and β-thalassemia, result from mutations in the adult β-globin gene. Reactivating the developmentally silenced fetal γ-globin gene elevates fetal hemoglobin levels and ameliorates symptoms of β-hemoglobinopathies. The continued expression of fetal γ-globin into adulthood occurs naturally in a genetic condition termed hereditary persistence of fetal hemoglobin (HPFH). Point mutations in the fetal γ-globin proximal promoter can cause HPFH. The -113A&gt;G HPFH mutation falls within the -115 cluster of HPFH mutations, a binding site for the fetal globin repressor BCL11A. We demonstrate that the -113A&gt;G HPFH mutation, unlike other mutations in the cluster, does not disrupt BCL11A binding but rather creates a de novo binding site for the transcriptional activator GATA1. Introduction of the -113A&gt;G HPFH mutation into erythroid cells using the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-CRISPR-associated protein 9 (Cas9) system increases GATA1 binding and elevates fetal globin levels. These results reveal the mechanism by which the -113A&gt;G HPFH mutation elevates fetal globin and demonstrate the sensitivity of the fetal globin promoter to point mutations that often disrupt repressor binding sites but here create a de novo site for an erythroid activator.
Sex determination and differentiation depend on differentiation of the indifferent gonad to the testis or ovary, which leads to masculine or feminine differentiation of internal and external genitalia. Recently, genes involved in this cascade have been identified with the advance of molecular genetical analysis. XY gonadal dysgenesis, this is a condition that has XY chromosome but is characterized by the indifferent testis. There are complete and incomplete types. Complete type has bilateral gonads of cordee, does not show physical characteristics of Turner's syndrome, has the uterus and ovaries, and has the vagina in female type, though the external genitalia are immature. Incomplete type is characterized by bilateral testicular hypoplasia(male pseudohermaphroditism) or unilateral testicular hypoplasia and bilateral restiform gonads(mixed gonadal dyspenesis), and the sexuality of the external genitalia is unclear. XX gonadal dysgenesis, complete type is characterized by bilateral restiform gonads, female type internal and external genitalia and sexual immaturity, though it does not show any characteristics of Turner's syndrome. It presents hypergonadotropic hypogonadism endocrinologically. It shows a familial incidence with autosomal recessive inheritance, and sensorineural deafness is accompanied in some cases. Incomplete type has rudimentary ovaries and show a varying degree of secondary sexual characteristics. Mixed dysgenesis, many cases have XO/XY mosaic and this dysgenesis is characterized by unilateral hypoplastic testis and contralateral restiform gonad. It may occur in cases of incomplete type XY gonadal dysgenesis. Trisomy X, cases of trisomy X have three X chromosomes as this term indicates. There are some cases of polisomy with four or more X chromosomes. The frequency of trisomy X has been reported to be one in 1,000 births of female, which means that it is a relatively common chromosomal aberration. It has been reported that about 20% of cases of trisomy X have sexual dysfunction, predominantly with primary amenorrha.
Internal sexual organs are differentiated and developed by androgens and regressed by müllerian inhibiting substance(anti-müllerian hormone). The role of 5 alpha-dihydrotestosterone, reduced form of testosterone by 5 alpha-reductase, in terms of development of Wolffian duct is discussed with soluble mesenchymal factor responsible for the epithelial branching morphogenesis of mouse seminal vesicle on the basis of experimental results using organ culture assay of mouse new-born seminal vesicle. An update of müllerian inhibiting substance, a fetal regressor of female internal organs such as uterus, fallopian tubes and upper third vagina, is also discussed.
We have determined the complete genomic nucleotide sequence and analyzed the promoter region of murine guanylyl cyclase/natriuretic peptide receptor-A gene (Npr1,coding for NPRA). The gene spans about 17.8 kb and contains 22 exons interrupted by 21 introns. All the exon-intron boundaries possess the consensus GT/AG splice junctions. Four different types of short interspersed nuclear elements (ten mouse B1 elements, seven mouse B2-B4 elements, one ID and one MIR element) and one medium reiteration frequency repeats have been found in the non-coding regions of the gene. Eleven tandem repeats, including three in the promoter region of the gene, have been identified. The transcription start site, 362 bp upstream from the start codon, was determined by 5'- rapid amplification of cDNA ends. The 1.98 kb 5'-flanking region contains three potential SP1 binding sites and one inverted CCAAT box but lacks the TATA box. This region also contains several putative cis-acting motifs known to bind kidney specific nuclear protein HFH-3, cAMP-responsive element binding protein (CREB) and AP-4. In addition, the binding sites for a variety of transcription factors: AML-1 alpha, SRY, Nkx-2.5, LyF-1, p300, GATA-1/2, HNF-3 beta, c/EBP alpha/beta and USF have been localized in the promoter region of Npr1 gene. The analyses and characterization of the genomic structure of murine Npr1 gene should yield important insights into the species-specific regulation of this important gene family.
Teleost fish are characterized by exceptionally high levels of neural estrogen biosynthesis when compared with the brains of other vertebrates or to the ovaries of the same fish. Two P450arom mRNAs which derive from separate gene loci (cyp19a and cyp19b) are differentially expressed in brain (b&gt;a) and ovary (a&gt;b) and have a different developmental program (b&gt;a) and estrogen upregulation (b only). A polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based genomic walking strategy was used to isolate the 5'-flanking regions of the goldfish (Carassius auratus) cyp19 genes. Sequence analysis of the cyp19b gene approximately 1.8 kb upstream of the transcription start site revealed a TATA box at nucleotide (nt) -30, two estrogen responsive elements (EREs; nt -351 and -211) and a consensus binding site (NBRE) for nerve growth factor inducible-B protein (NGFI-B/Nur77) at -286, which includes another ERE half-site. Also present were a sequence at nt -399 (CCCTCCT) required for neural specificity of the zebrafish GATA-2 gene, and 16 copies of an SRY/SOX binding motif. The 5'-flanking region ( approximately 1.0 kb) of the cyp19a gene had TATA (nt -48) and CAAT (nt -71) boxes, a steroidogenic factor-1 (SF-1) binding site (nt -265), eight copies of the SRY/SOX motif, and two copies of a recognition site for binding the arylhydrocarbon receptor (AhR)/AhR nuclear translocator factor (ARNT) heterodimer. Both genes had elements previously identified in the brain specific exon I promoter of the mouse aromatase gene. Cyp19a- and -b/luciferase constructs showed basal promoter activity in aromatase-expressing rodent pituitary (GH3) cells, but differences (a&gt;b) did not reflect expression in fish pituitary in vivo (b&gt;a), implying a lack of appropriate cell factors. Consistent with the onset of cyp19b expression in zebrafish embryos, microinjection of a green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter plasmid into fertilized eggs revealed labeling in neural tissues at 30-48 h post-fertilization (hpf), most prominently in retinal ganglion cells (RGC) and axon-like projections to the optic tectum. Expression of a cyp19a/GFP reporter was not detectable up to 72 hpf. Tandem analysis of cyp19a and cyp19b promoters in living zebrafish embryos can be a useful approach for identifying cis-elements and cellular factors involved in the correct tissue-specific, spatial, temporal and estrogen regulated expression of aromatase genes during CNS and gonadal development.
Aromatase inhibitors administered prior to histological signs of gonadal sex differentiation can induce sex reversal of genetic female chickens. Under the effects of Fadrozole (CGS 16949A), a nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitor, the right gonad generally becomes a testis, and the left gonad a testis or an ovotestis. We have compared the expression pattern of the genes encoding AMH (the anti-Müllerian hormone), SF1 (steroidogenic factor 1), and SOX9 (a transcription factor related to SRY) in these sex-reversed gonads with that in control testes and ovaries, using in situ hybridization with riboprobes on gonadal sections. In control males, the three genes are expressed in Sertoli cells of testicular cords; however, only SOX9 is male specific, since as observed previously AMH and SF1 but not SOX9 are expressed in the control female gonads. In addition to testicular-like cords, sex-reversed gonads present many lacunae with a composite, thick and flat epithelium. We show that during embryonic and postnatal development, AMH, SF1 and SOX9 are expressed in the epithelium of testicular-like cords and in the thickened part but not in the flattened part of the epithelium of composite lacunae. AMH and SF1 but not SOX9 are expressed in follicular cells of ovotestes. Coexpression of the three genes, of which SOX9 is a specific Sertoli-cell marker, provides strong evidence for the transdifferentiation of ovarian into testicular epithelium in gonads of female chickens treated with Fadrozole.
Based on the common function of steroid hormone-producing tissues and homologous regulation by the hypothalamo-pituitary axis, the adrenal cortex and the gonads have been suggested to have an intimate ontogenic relationship. This assumption is also supported by the findings of common transcription factors implicated in the differentiation of both types of tissue and further supported by concomitant defects in such tissues due to the disruption of a single gene. Similarly, simultaneous anomalies in those tissues are also observed in some diseases caused by mutations of the genes encoding those transcription factors. A recent immunohistochemical study with one of the transcription factors, Ad4BP/SF-1, definitely demonstrated the presence of a particular cell population designated the 'adreno-genital primordium (AGP)' which gives rise to both the adrenal cortex and the gonads. In the process of differentiation from the AGP to the mature adrenal cortex and the gonads of the two sexes, several interesting issues can be raised as to the next targets for the study. To address these issues it is important to elucidate the upstream regulatory mechanisms and downstream target genes of such transcription factors as WT1, SRY, SOX9 and DAX1, in addition to Ad4BP/SF-1, all of which are implicated in steroidogenic tissue differentiation.
Intersexuality has been reported in pigs and investigations are in progress to identify and physically map the genes involved in sex-reversal. In this study we have mapped on porcine chromosomes seven genes which might be implicated in this developmental pathway. Four genes were mapped by radioactive in situ hybridization: AMH (Anti-Müllerian Hormone) and WT1 (Wilms' Tumor gene 1) were both mapped to pig chromosome 2 (SSC2) in the q14--&gt;q21 and p14--&gt;q11 regions, placental CYP19 (cytochrome P450, subfamily XIX) and FTZF1 (fushi tarazu factor [Drosophila] homolog 1, alias SF1 [steroidogenic factor 1]) to pig chromosome 1 (SSC1) in the q14--&gt;q17 and q210--&gt;q211 regions respectively. Four other genes were regionally located by PCR analysis on a cytogenetically characterized porcine somatic cell hybrid panel: a second CYP19 gene (expressed in embryo) was mapped to porcine 1q12--&gt;q17, AHC (alias DAX1, adrenal hypoplasia congenital) to porcine Xp24, SOX2 and SOX9 (SRY sex determining region Y-box 2 and 9) to 13q23--&gt;q41 and 12p13--&gt;p11 respectively. These results are in global agreement with mapping data available in other mammalian species.
Loss of Abcc6 gene expression was identified to be responsible for dystrophic calcification of the heart (DCC) or vessels after acute injury in several strains of laboratory mice. This calcification shares features with osteogenesis and may involve osteogenic factors. Tissue expression of osteopontin (Opn) and 11 osteogenic transcription factors were studied in vivo in mouse models for DCC and in vitro using luciferase reporter gene assays. Compared with DCC-resistant C57BL/6 mice, a significant increase in Opn transcription was demonstrated in necrotic lesions of both DCC-susceptible C3H/He and B6.C3H(Dyscalc1) congenic mice at day 3 after injury. Significant increases in gene expression were also demonstrated for the transcription factors runt domain-containing transcription factor 2 (Runx2), vitamin D receptor (Vdr), SRY (sex-determining region Y)-box 9 protein, and Nfkb1 in C3H/He mice versus C57BL/6 controls. However, only Runx2 remained significantly increased in the B6.C3H(Dyscalc1) congenic mice, which carry only the Dyscalc1 locus with functional Abcc6 deletion on a C57BL/6 genetic background. Luciferase assay use increased Opn promoter activity, which was demonstrated after overexpression of Runx2. A poly-T stretch insertion was identified to stabilize the binding of Runx2, thus significantly enhancing Opn promoter activity. This Runx2-mediated activation was further enhanced by cotransfection with Vdr. Our data suggest a key role of Runx2 in the regulation of Opn in a model of cardiovascular calcification and demonstrate a synergistic cooperation of Runx2 and Vdr.
Nuclear receptor subfamily 5, group A, member 1 (NR5A1 previously known as SF-1/AD4BP) is a transcription factor involved in the development of adrenal/gonadal tissues and steroidogenic lineage cell differentiation in adult somatic stem cells. To understand the cellular signaling network that regulates NR5A1 gene expression, loss of function screening with an siRNA kinome library, and gain of function screening with an addressable full-length cDNA library representing one quarter of the human genome was carried out. The NR5A1 gene expression was activated in mesenchymal stem cells by siRNA directed against protein kinase C (PKC)-delta, erb-B3, RhoGAP (ARHGAP26), and hexokinase 2, none of which were previously known to be involved in the NR5A1 gene expression. Among these, we identified crosstalk between erb-B3 and PKC-delta signaling cascades. In addition, the gain of function studies indicated that sex-determining region Y (SRY)-box 15 (SOX15), TEA domain family member 4, KIAA1257 (a gene of unknown function), ADAM metallopeptidase with thrombospondin type 1 motif 6, Josephin domain containing 1, centromere protein, TATA box-binding protein-associated factor 5-like RNA polymerase, and inducible T-cell co-stimulator activate NR5A1 gene expression. These results provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms of NR5A1 gene expression.
SOX9 is a member of the SOX [Sry-related high-mobility group (HMG) box] family of HMG DNA-binding domain transcription factors and is required for the development and differentiation of multiple cell lineages. This report shows that basal epithelial cells express SOX9 in normal prostate, with no detectable expression in luminal epithelial cells. In contrast, SOX9 is expressed in primary prostate cancers in vivo, at a higher frequency in recurrent prostate cancer and in prostate cancer cell lines (LNCaP, CWR22, PC3, and DU145). SOX9 message and protein levels in prostate cancer cells were increased by treatment with glycogen synthase kinase 3beta inhibitor (SB415286), and SOX9 was reduced when beta-catenin was down-regulated by small interfering RNA (siRNA), indicating that SOX9 expression in prostate cancer is regulated by Wnt/beta-catenin signaling. SOX9 bound specifically to androgen receptor (AR) DNA-binding domain glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins, and this interaction was dependent on a short peptide immediately COOH-terminal to the DNA-binding domain (the C-terminal extension), which is required for interactions between steroid hormone receptors and the architectural HMG proteins. Exogenous SOX9 expressed at high nonphysiologic levels decreased AR expression and activity; however, at lower levels, SOX9 increased AR protein expression. Significantly, down-regulation of SOX9 by siRNA in prostate cancer cells reduced endogenous AR protein levels, and cell growth indicating that SOX9 contributes to AR regulation and decreased cellular proliferation. These results indicate that SOX9 in prostate basal cells supports the development and maintenance of the luminal epithelium and that a subset of prostate cancer cells may escape basal cell requirements through SOX9 expression.
Xpo4 is a bidirectional nuclear transport receptor that mediates nuclear export of eIF5A and Smad3 as well as import of Sox2 and SRY. How Xpo4 recognizes such a variety of cargoes is as yet unknown. Here we present the crystal structure of the RanGTP·Xpo4·eIF5A export complex at 3.2 Å resolution. Xpo4 has a similar structure as CRM1, but the NES-binding site is occluded, and a new interaction site evolved that recognizes both globular domains of eIF5A. eIF5A contains hypusine, a unique amino acid with two positive charges, which is essential for cell viability and eIF5A function in translation. The hypusine docks into a deep, acidic pocket of Xpo4 and is thus a critical element of eIF5A's complex export signature. This further suggests that Xpo4 recognizes other cargoes differently, and illustrates how Xpo4 suppresses - in a chaperone-like manner - undesired interactions of eIF5A inside nuclei.
This article outlines the novel hypothesis that exercise promotes axon regeneration after peripheral nerve injury through neuronal brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and there are three required means of promoting BDNF expression: 1) increased signaling through androgen receptors, 2) increased cAMP-responsive element-binding protein expression, and 3) increased expression of the transcription factor SRY-box containing gene 11. 
A significant portion of the mammalian genome encodes numerous transcripts that are not translated into proteins, termed long non-coding RNAs. Initial studies identifying long non-coding RNAs inferred these RNA sequences were a consequence of transcriptional noise or promiscuous RNA polymerase II activity. However, the last decade has seen a revolution in the understanding of regulation and function of long non-coding RNAs. Now it has become apparent that long non-coding RNAs play critical roles in a wide variety of biological processes. In this review, we describe the current understanding of long non-coding RNA-mediated regulation of cellular processes: differentiation, development, and disease. 
Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), an incretin hormone, is released from intestinal L-cells in response to nutrients. GLP-1 lowers blood glucose levels by stimulating insulin secretion from pancreatic beta-cells in a glucose-dependent manner. In addition, GLP-1 slows gastric emptying, suppresses appetite, reduces plasma glucagon, and stimulates glucose disposal, which are beneficial for glucose homeostasis. Therefore, incretin-based therapies such as GLP-1 receptor agonists and inhibitors of dipeptidyl peptidase IV, an enzyme which inactivates GLP-1, have been developed for treatment of diabetes. This review outlines our knowledge of the actions of GLP-1 on insulin secretion and biosynthesis, beta-cell proliferation and regeneration, and protection against beta-cell damage, as well as the involvement of recently discovered signaling pathways of GLP-1 action, mainly focusing on pancreatic beta-cells. 
Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) are multipotent progenitor cells localized in the stromal compartment of the bone marrow (BM). The potential of MSC for mesenchymal differentiation has been well documented in different animal models predominantly on rodents. However, information regarding bovine MSC (bMSC) is limited, and the differentiation potential of bMSC derived from fetal BM remains unknown. In the present study we sought to isolate bMSC from abattoir-derived fetal BM and to characterize the multipotent and differentiation potential under osteogenic, chondrogenic and adipogenic conditions by quantitative and qualitative analyses.
Plastic-adherent bMSC isolated from fetal BM maintained a fibroblast-like morphology under monolayer culture conditions. These cells expressed high levels of MSC surface markers (CD73, CD90, and CD105) and low levels of hematopoietic surface markers (CD34 and CD45). Culture of bMSC under osteogenic conditions during a 27-day period induced up-regulation of the osteocalcin (OC) gene expression and alkaline phosphatase (ALPL) activity, and promoted mineralization of the matrix. Increasing supplementation levels of ascorbic acid to culture media enhanced osteogenic differentiation of bMSC; whereas, reduction of FBS supplementation compromised osteogenesis. bMSC increased expression of cartilage-specific genes aggrecan (ACAN), collagen 2A1 (COL2A1) and SRY (sex-determining region Y) box 9 (SOX9) at Day 21 of chondrogenic differentiation. Treatment of bMSC with adipogenic factors increased levels of fatty acid-binding protein 2 (AP2) mRNA and accumulation of lipid vacuoles after 18 days of culture. NANOG mRNA levels in differentiating bMSC were not affected during adipogenic culture; however, osteogenic and chondrogenic conditions induced higher and lower levels, respectively.
Our analyses revealed the potential multilineage differentiation of bMSC isolated from abattoir-derived fetal BM. NANOG mRNA pattern in differentiating bMSC varied according to differentiation culture conditions. The osteogenic differentiation of bMSC was affected by ascorbic acid and FBS concentrations in culture media. The simplicity of isolation and the differentiation potential suggest that bMSC from abattoir-derived fetal BM are appropriate candidate for investigating MSC biology and for eventual applications for regenerative therapy.
Using in vitro assays, we show that nuclear proteins related to the Sp1 and GT-1 factors bind to a CACCC box sequence in the human beta-globin enhancer, adjacent to binding sites for the erythroid-specific factor NFE1 and the ubiquitous factor CP1. The same proteins are known to bind to the proximal, but not to the distal, CACCC, box in the human beta-globin promoter. A C G mutation in the promoter CACCC box, known to cause beta-thalassemia, greatly decreases protein binding to the CACCC box; the same effect is obtained when this mutation is introduced into the enhancer CACCC box.
Strong genetic evidence supports the idea that point mutations in the promoter of gamma-globin genes overexpressed in adult age [hereditary persistence of fetal hemoglobin (HPFH)] are responsible for the observed phenotype. DNA binding sites for ubiquitous and/or erythroid specific nuclear proteins correlate in location with the positions of point mutations responsible for HPFH. The analysis of the effects of one of these mutations (-175 T greater than C) on in vitro binding of nuclear proteins and on the activity of the mutated promoter in transfection assays indicates that altered binding of the erythroid-specific protein NFE-1 may be responsible for increased activity of the mutated promoter. Other HPFH mutations close to the distal CCAAT box (-117 G greater than A and 13 nucleotide deletions, -114 to -102) have complex effects on in vitro binding of nuclear proteins; their only common effect is the loss of binding of the erythroid-specific factor NFE3. If mechanisms generating the HPFH phenotype are homogeneous, NFE3 might be a negatively acting factor; alternatively, heterogeneous mechanisms might operate and HPFH might additionally be related to loss of binding to the distal CCAAT box region of either NFE1 (-117 HPFH) or of the ubiquitous CCAAT displacement protein-CDP (13 nucleotides deletion). Finally, it is also proposed that increased activity of the HPFH promoters may secondarily cause decreased expression of the delta- and beta-globin genes in cis possibly by competition between gamma- and beta-globin promoters for interaction with common regulatory elements.
The -175 T greater than C mutation in the promoter of the A gamma- or G gamma-globin gene causes a 50-100 fold increase of the expression of the respective gene in adult erythroid cells (Hereditary Persistence of Fetal Hemoglobin). We show here that this mutation increases 3-9 fold the expression of a gamma-CAT reporter plasmid transfected into the erythroid cells K562, but not that of the same plasmid in non erythroid cells. The overexpression of the mutant is abolished by the mutation of the binding site for the erythroid specific factor NFE1; inactivation of the adjacent binding site for the ubiquitous factor OTF1 does not cause overexpression of the normal gamma-globin promoter. Previous results demonstrated that the -175 mutation slightly increases the in vitro binding of NFE1 and almost abolishes that of OTF1; the present functional data indicate that altered binding of NFE1, but not of OTF1, is responsible for the observed overexpression of the mutated promoter.
Rhizobium meliloti large plasmid pRmeGR4b carries the nodulation competitiveness locus nfe responsible for the nodulation efficiency and competitive ability of strain GR4 on alfalfa roots. We report here the nucleotide sequence and characterization of a 3345 base-pair DNA section of the nfe region. Sequence analysis revealed four open reading frames (ORFs), two of them with rightward polarity, termed nfe1 and nfe2, are preceded by functional nif consensus sequences and NifA-binding motifs. An additional, NifA-independent, transcriptional start site for nfe1 was also found. Two other ORFs with leftward polarity, designated ORFA and ORFB, were identified upstream from nfe1 and nfe2 but no nif consensus sequences were found. However, expression of ORFA might be indirectly coupled to the NifA-NtrA regulatory network. The gene products of nfe1 and nfe2 were identified using in vitro transcription/translation and bacteriophage T7 RNA polymerase/promoter system, respectively. A high degree of homology between the amino terminal domain of Nfe1 and the nifH gene product was found. In addition, nfe1 shows homology with the upstream non-coding DNA region of the fixABCX operon. Furthermore, the putative ORFB encoded protein contains a helix-turn-helix motif that resembles the DNA-binding consensus sequence proposed for many prokaryotic regulatory proteins.
The nfe genes located on the large plasmid pRmeGR4b are involved in the nodulation efficiency and competitiveness of Rhizobium meliloti GR4 on alfalfa roots. One hundred twenty-eight base-pairs downstream of nfe2 gene we found an open reading frame designated ORFC, 970 bp long and potentially coding for a 320 amino acid long protein. The amino acid sequence of the putatively encoded ORFC product shows similarity with ornithine cyclodeaminase (OCD) of Agrobacterium tumefaciens an unusual enzyme that converts ornithine into proline. The gene product of ORFC was identified as a 37-kDa protein by in vitro-coupled transcription-translation and in vivo by the T7 RNA polymerase/promoter system. DNA hybridization studies showed that strain GR4 carries a single copy of the ocd-like gene. No homologous sequences to GR4 ORFC DNA were found in other R. meliloti strains or Rhizobium spp. assayed. Furthermore, a GR4 derivative mutant obtained by plasmid disruption of ORFC showed an impaired nodulation efficiency as compared to that of the wild-type strain GR4. Thus, the former locus should be considered a novel nfe gene. We propose to rename the nfe genes, nfe1, 2 and ORFC as nfeA, B, and D, respectively.
Objective- Increasing evidence shows that resveratrol has antiatherogenic effects, but its underlying mechanisms are unknown. Thus, we evaluated the molecular mechanisms underlying the antiatherogenic effect of resveratrol. Approach and Results- Using the previously established mouse atherosclerosis model of partial ligation of the left carotid artery, we evaluated the role of resveratrol in antiatherosclerosis. We attempted to determine the mechanisms associated with focal adhesions using vascular endothelial cells. The results showed that resveratrol stimulated focal adhesion kinase cleavage via resveratrol-increased expression of lactoferrin in endothelial cells. Furthermore, we found that an N-terminal focal adhesion kinase fragment cleaved by resveratrol contained the FERM (band 4.1, ezrin, radixin, and moesin)-kinase domain. Furthermore, resveratrol inhibited lipopolysaccharide-stimulated adhesion of THP-1 human monocytes by decreased expression of ICAM-1 (intercellular adhesion molecule-1). A decreased ICAM-1 level was also observed in the left carotid artery of mice treated with resveratrol. To understand the relationship between resveratrol-induced antiinflammation and focal adhesion disruption, endothelial cells were transfected with FERM-kinase. Ectopically expressed FERM-kinase, the resveratrol-cleaved focal adhesion kinase fragment, was found in the nuclear fraction and inhibited the transcription level of icam-1 via the Nrf2 (nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2)-antioxidant response element complex. Finally, ectopically expressed FERM-kinase blocked tumor necrosis factor-α- or IL- (interleukin) stimulated monocytic binding to endothelial cells. Conclusions- Our results show that resveratrol inhibits the expression of ICAM-1 via transcriptional regulation of the FERM-kinase and Nrf2 interaction, thereby blocking monocyte adhesion. These suppressive effects on the inflammatory mechanism suggest that resveratrol delayed the onset of atherosclerosis.
Objective: To evaluate the effects of penehyclidine hydrochloride on the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2/antioxidant responsive element (Nrf2/ARE) signaling pathway during endotoxin-induced acute lung injury(ALI) in neonate rats. Methods: Forty 7-day-old Wistar rats weighing 12-18 g were randomly divided into 4 groups (n=10) using a random number table: normal saline group(NS group), acute lung injury(ALI group), penehyclidine hydrochloride group(PHC group) and penehyclidine hydrochloride+ Nrf2 siRNA plasmid group(PNS group). The ALI model was induced with intraperitoneal endotoxin (5.0 mg/kg) in groups ALI, PHC and PNS. In groups PHC and PNS, penehyclidine hydrochloride (2.0 mg/kg) was injected intraperitoneally at 1 h before ALI respectively, while the equal volume of normal saline was administered in groups NS and ALI. The animal of PNS group were inhaled adenovirus packaging of Nrf2-siRNA three times (one time a day) before modeling. At 4 h after endotoxin injection, the rats were sacrificed. The lungs were collected to determine the wet/dry(W/D) lung weight ratio. The expression of Nrf2 and heme oxygen and enzyme 1(HO-1) were determined by Western blotting, contents of tumor necrosis factor-alpha(TNF-α),interleukin10 (IL-10)were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay(ELISA). The cell apoptosis were determined by transferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate-biotin nick end labeling(TUNEL),and the apoptotic index was calculated. Results: The W/D ratio in NS, ALI, PHC and PNS groups were (4.2±0.1), (9.6±0.7), (6.5±0.6), (8.3±1.3) respectively. The apoptotic index were (3.7±0.5)%, (31.5±3.2)%, (17.6±4.2)%, (28.1±3.5)%respectively.The contents of TNF-α were (10.3±1.6), (98.5±8.5), (68.5±6.7), (89.9±8.5) pg/ml respectively. The contents of IL-10 were (7.9±0.6), (102.8±9.3), (72.5±5.8), (97.7±9.1) pg/ml respectively.The expression of Nrf2 were (23.2±7.6), (79.8±13.0), (155.5±16.7), (12.0±3.3) respectively. The expression of HO-1 were (31.7±8.6), (90.8±10.3), (147.6±22.5), (61.4±9.7) respectively. There were statistically significant differences among different groups (F=86.013, 154.897, 328.810, 374.198, 333.965, 125.274, all P&lt;0.05). Compared with group NS, the W/D ratio, apoptotic index and the contents of TNF-α, IL-10 increased, the expression of Nrf2 and HO-1 up-regulated in group ALI and group PHC (all P&lt;0.05). Compared with group ALI, the W/D ratio, apoptotic index and the contents of TNF-α, IL-10 decreased, the expression of Nrf2 and HO-1 up-regulated in group PHC (all P&lt;0.05). Compared with group ALI, no significant differences were found in the W/D ratio, apoptotic index and the contents of TNF-α, IL-10 in group PNS(all P&gt;0.05), while the expression of Nrf2 and HO-1 down-regulated in group PNS (all P&lt;0.05). Compared with group PHC, the W/D ratio,apoptotic index and the contents of TNF-α,IL-10 increased, the expression of Nrf2 and HO-1 down-regulated in group PNS (all P&lt;0.05). Conclusion: Nrf2/ARE signaling pathway is involved in the reduction of ALI by penehyclidine hydrochloride in neonate rats.

Rheum rhabarbarum has been widely used as a herbal medicine and food in China. The objective of this study was to investigate the cytoprotective action and underlying mechanisms of rhein, one active ingredient isolated from R. rhabarbarum, on H2O2-challenged rat small intestine epithelial cells (IEC-6 cells). H2O2-challenged IEC-6 cells were incubated in the pretreatment with or without rhein or LY294002, a PI3K/Akt inhibitor. The cell viability, apoptosis, intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), and antioxidants were measured. The expressions of heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1), nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor (Nrf2), Akt, and p-Akt were evaluated by western blotting. Meanwhile, LY294002 was also used to investigate the role of PI3K/Akt in the rhein-induced cytoprotective role. The results showed that pretreatment of rhein could reverse the inhibition of cell viability and suppress the apoptosis, caspase-3 activity, and intracellular ROS induced by H2O2. Rhein also supported SOD activity catalase activity, glutathione S-transferase activity, and glutathione content. Furthermore, rhein induced the protein expression of HO-1 together with its upstream mediator Nrf2 and activated the phosphorylation of Akt in IEC-6 cells. LY294002 inhibited increased cell viability, upregulated the lowered apoptotic rate, and enhanced the weakened ROS levels. Although the inhibition of PI3K/Akt did not inhibit the Nrf2 nuclear level under 4 μM rhein, LY294002 inhibited the Nrf2 nuclear level under 2 μM rhein and blocked HO-1 expression. These data demonstrated that rhein protected IEC-6 cells against oxidative damage partly via PI3K/Akt and Nrf2/HO-1 pathways.
Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) regulates the expression of an array of enzymes with important detoxifying and antioxidant functions. Current findings support the role of high levels of oxidative stress in the pathogenesis of neurological disorders. Given the central role played by Nrf2 in counteracting oxidative damage, a number of studies have targeted the modulation of this transcription factor in order to confer neuroprotection. Nrf2 activity is tightly regulated by oxidative stress and energy-based stimuli. Thus, many dietary interventions based on energy intake regulation, such as dietary energy restriction (DER) or high-fat diet (HFD), modulate Nrf2 with consequences for a variety of cellular processes that affect brain health. DER, by either restricting calorie intake or meal frequency, activates Nrf2 thereby triggering its protective effects, whilst HFD inhibit this pathway, thereby exacerbating oxidative stress. Consequently, DER protocols can be valuable strategies in the management of central nervous system (CNS) disorders. Herein, we review current knowledge of the role of Nrf2 signaling in neurological diseases, namely Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis and cerebral ischemia, as well as the potential of energy intake regulation in the management of Nrf2 signaling.
The transcription factor nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (NRF2) is one of the master regulators that control hundreds of genes containing antioxidant response elements (AREs). The NRF2-ARE pathway plays a complex role in colorectal cancer (CRC). NRF2 activity is known to be regulated by KEAP1-CUL3 E3 ligase-mediated ubiquitination, indicating the importance of deubiquitination regulation. However, the deubiquitinase (DUB) of NRF2 remains unknown. Here, by screening a DUB library, we identified DUB3 as a DUB that remarkably stabilized NRF2. Further experiments demonstrated that DUB3 promoted NRF2 stability and transcriptional activity by decreasing the K48-linked ubiquitination of NRF2. Coimmunoprecipitation studies revealed interactions between NRF2 and DUB3, as well as between KEAP1 and DUB3, indicating that NRF2, DUB3, and KEAP1 formed a large functional complex. Importantly, ectopic expression of DUB3 caused NRF2-dependent chemotherapy resistance in colon cancer cell lines. Thus, to the best of our knowledge, our findings are the first to identify DUB3 as a NRF2 DUB and may provide a new strategy against chemotherapy resistance in CRC and other NRF2-related diseases.
Viral infection is often accompanied with alteration of intracellular redox state, especially an imbalance between reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and antioxidant cellular defenses. The previous studies showed that an antioxidant cellular defense system, the transcription factor nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), played an important role against spring viraemia of carp virus (SVCV) infection in fish. To further reveal the mediated mechanism that Nrf2 active state was affected by protein kinase C (PKC), here we evaluated SVCV replication in host cells by treated with a strong activator of PKC phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA) and an inhibitor staurosporine. Our results showed that PMA significantly repressed SVCV replication and viral-induced apoptosis in Epithelioma papulosum cyprini (EPC) cell, suggesting that PKC may exhibit an anti-SVCV effect. Likewise, PMA resulted in a higher phosphorylation levels of PKCε rather than PKCα/β to participate in the activation of Nrf2, mainly involved in the activation of Nrf2 phosphorylation of Ser40 to favor Nrf2 translocation to nucleus. Furthermore, the data revealed that PMA up-regulated an antiviral response heme oxygenase-1 (HO1) gene expression that was confirmed as the key player against SVCV infection by HO1 specific siRNA. Overall, this study provided a new therapeutic target for the treatment of SVCV infection, and modulating PKC activity could be used for the prevention and treatment of SVCV.
Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is known as an inflammatory disease. NRF2 (Nuclear Factor Erythroid 2 Like2) encodes a transcription factor that binds to antioxidant response elements (AREs) and regulates the expression of genes involved in many antioxidant responses.
This study aimed to gain insight into individual anti-inflammatory activity to prevent T2D development in humans.
We performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) to identify genetic variants influencing NRF2 expression in LCLs (lymphoblastoid cell lines) generated from 74 different individuals. Association analyses between T2D or its related traits and genetic risk score (GRS) calculated by combining genetic variants detected from GWAS for cellular NRF2 expression were performed using data from 8715 subjects. The T2D prediction model using GRS was evaluated by measuring the area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve.
Our GWAS identified six genetic variants (SNP) showing suggestive evidence of associations with cellular NRF2 expression (P &lt; 10- 6). Logistic regression analysis demonstrated that GRS was associated with an increased risk of T2D (P value = 0.003, OR = 1.13). In addition, linear regression analyses showed positive associations between GRS and fasting glucose (P value = 0.028, β = 0.62), 2-h glucose (P value = 0.0004, β = 1.13) and HbA1C (P value = 0.033, β = 0.03). In the T2D prediction model using GRS, the AUC of the ROC curve was 0.69.
This study highlights genetic variants associated with cellular NRF2 expression and suggests that the GRS of NRF2 expression-associated variants is likely to be a useful indicator of T2D development in the human population.
The Cancer Genome Atlas catalogued alterations in the Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 and nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2) signaling pathway in 6.3% of patient samples across 226 studies, with significant enrichment in lung and upper airway cancers. These alterations constitutively activate NRF2-dependent gene transcription to promote many of the cancer hallmarks, including cellular resistance to oxidative stress, xenobiotic efflux, proliferation, and metabolic reprogramming. Almost universally, NRF2 activity strongly associates with poor patient prognosis and chemo- and radioresistance. Yet to date, FDA-approved drugs targeting NRF2 activity in cancer have not been realized. Here, we review various mechanisms that contribute to NRF2 activation in cancer, organized around the central dogma of molecular biology (i) at the DNA level with genomic and epigenetic alterations, (ii) at the RNA level including differential mRNA splicing and stability, and (iii) at the protein level comprising altered posttranslational modifications and protein-protein interactions. Ultimately, defining and understanding the mechanisms responsible for NRF2 activation in cancer may lead to novel targets for therapeutic intervention.
We have previously reported decreased thyroid function within the laboratory reference range and changes in mitochondrial function after hemithyroidectomy. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator-1α (PGC-1α) and coactivator-1β (PGC-1β) are key regulators of mitochondrial biogenesis and function. The aim was to examine the influence of hemithyroidectomy on the longitudinal change in mRNA expression of these genes. In addition, we measured longitudinal changes in mRNA expressions of the mitochoncrial-related genes nuclear factor erythroid-derived 2-like 2 (NFE2L2), mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM), and sodium dismutase 2 (SOD2). Twenty-eight patients were examined before and 1, 3, 6, and 12 months after hemithyroidectomy for benign euthyroid goiter. Thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) and thyroid hormones were measured, and whole blood gene expression of PGC-1α, PGC-1β, NFE2L2, TFAM, and SOD2 was examined by reverse transcription quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction. We used mixed effect regression models to investigate changes in gene expression with time. Averaged over all follow-up visits, TSH increased (p=0.001), tT3 declined (p=0.01), and fT4/tT3 ratio increased (p=0.03) over one-year follow-up, but fT4 remained unchanged. Averaged over all follow-up visits, whole blood PGC-1α levels (p&lt;0.001) and SOD2 (p=0.009) levels declined, but PGC-1β, TFAM, and NFE2L2 did not change over one-year follow-up. The study demonstrates significant downregulation of whole blood PGC-1α and SOD2 gene expressions in hemithyroidectomized patients with a concomitant increase in TSH concentration within the reference range. Thus, hemithyroidectomized patients may likely have impaired mitochondrial function.
Dimethyl fumarate (DMF) is a fumaric acid ester registered for the treatment of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS). It induces protein succination leading to inactivation of cysteine-rich proteins. It was first shown to possess cytoprotective and antioxidant effects in noncancer models, which appeared related to the induction of the nuclear factor erythroid 2 (NF-E2)-related factor 2 (NRF2) pathway. DMF also displays antitumor activity in several cellular and mice models. Recently, we showed that the anticancer mechanism of DMF is dose-dependent and is paradoxically related to the decrease in the nuclear translocation of NRF2. Some other studies performed indicate also the potential role of DMF in cancers, which are dependent on the NRF2 antioxidant and cellular detoxification program, such as KRAS-mutated lung adenocarcinoma. It, however, seems that DMF has multiple biological effects as it has been shown to also inhibit the transcription factor nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB), thus blocking downstream targets that may be involved in the development and progression of inflammatory cascades leading to various disease processes, including tumors, lymphomas, diabetic retinopathy, arthritis, and psoriasis. Herein, we present the current status and future directions of the use of DMF in various diseases models with particular emphases on its targeting of specific intracellular signal transduction cascades in cancer; to shed some light on its possible mode of action.
Oxidative stress markers and antioxidant enzymes have previously been shown to have prognostic value and associate with adverse outcome in patients with diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 1 (Nrf1) and factor 2 (Nrf2) are among the principal inducers of antioxidant enzyme production. Kelch ECH associating protein 1 (Keap1) is a negative regulator of Nrf2, and BTB (BR-C, ttk and bab) domain and CNC homolog 1 (Bach1) represses the function of both factors. Their significance in DLBCL prognosis is unknown.
Diagnostic biopsy samples of 76 patients with high-risk DLBCL were retrospectively stained with immunohistochemistry for Nrf1, Nrf2, Keap1 and Bach1, and correlated with clinical data and outcome.
Nuclear Nrf2 and nuclear Bach1 expression were associated with adverse clinical features (anaemia, advanced stage, high IPI, high risk of neutropaenic infections), whereas cytoplasmic Nrf1 and Nrf2 were associated with favourable clinical presentation (normal haemoglobin level, no B symptoms, limited stage). None of the evaluated factors could predict survival alone. However, when two of the following parameters were combined: high nuclear score of Nrf2, low nuclear score of Nrf1, high cytoplasmic score of Nrf1 and low cytoplasmic score of Keap1 were associated with significantly worse overall survival.
Nrf1 and Nrf2 are relevant in disease presentation and overall survival in high-risk DLBCL. Low nuclear expression of Nrf1, high cytoplasmic expression of Nrf1, high nuclear expression of Nrf2 and low cytoplasmic expression of Keap1 are associated with adverse outcome in this patient group.
Inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) activity produces anti-tumor and anti-microbial effects but also promotes carcinogenesis through mutagenic, immunosuppressive and pro-angiogenic mechanisms. The tumor suppressor p53 contributes to iNOS downregulation by repressing induction of the NOS2 gene encoding iNOS, thereby limiting NO-mediated DNA damages. This study focuses on the role of the p53 homologue TAp73 in the regulation of iNOS expression. Induction of iNOS by immunological stimuli was upregulated in immortalized MEFs from TAp73-/- mice, compared to TAp73+/+ fibroblasts. This overexpression resulted both from increased levels of NOS2 transcripts, and from an increased stability of the protein. Limitation of iNOS expression by TAp73 in wild-type cells is alleviated by TGF-β receptor I inhibitors, suggesting a cooperation between TAp73 and TGF-β in suppression of iNOS expression. Accordingly, downregulation of iNOS expression by exogenous TGF-β1 was impaired in TAp73-/- fibroblasts. Increased NO production in these cells resulted in a stronger, NO-dependent induction of Nrf2 target genes, indicating that the Nrf2-dependent adaptive response to nitrosative stress in fibroblasts is proportional to iNOS activity. NO-dependent induction of two HIF-1 target genes was also stronger in TAp73-deficient cells. Finally, the antimicrobial action of NO against Trypanosoma musculi parasites was enhanced in TAp73-/- fibroblasts. Our data indicate that tumor suppressive TAp73 isoforms cooperate with TGF-β to control iNOS expression, NO-dependent adaptive responses to stress, and pathogen proliferation.
Thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) is a key epithelial-derived factor that aggravates allergic diseases. Therefore, TSLP inhibitors are candidate compounds for the treatment of allergic diseases. Previously, we reported that KCMH-1, a mouse keratinocyte cell line, constitutively produces TSLP. In this study, we tried to identify inhibitors of TSLP by screening 2169 compounds in KCMH-1 cells and found one such chalcone derivative (code no. 16D10). 16D10 inhibited TSLP expression and TSLP promoter activation in HaCaT cells, a human keratinocyte cell line. Although nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-κB) is a key transcription factor for the induction of TSLP, 16D10 did not inhibit the activation pathway of NF-κB, such as degradation of inhibitor of κB (IκB) and p65 nuclear translocation. 16D10 activated the Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1)-nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (Nrf2) system, although this system was not involved in the inhibitory effect of 16D10. 16D10 also inhibited TSLP production in a lipopolysaccharide (LPS)- or ovalbumin (OVA)-induced air-pouch-type inflammation model. Further, repeated 16D10 administration diminished serum immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) and IgE concentration in an OVA-induced air-pouch-type sensitization model. Taken together, these results indicate that 16D10 is an inhibitor of TSLP production and has an anti-allergic effect. This inhibitory effect is independent of the activation of NF-κB and the Keap1-Nrf2 system. Therefore, 16D10 could be a new type of candidate drug for allergic diseases.
GR24 is a synthetic strigolactone analog, demonstrated to regulate the development of plants and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. GR24 possesses anti-cancer and anti-apoptotic properties, enhances insulin sensitivity and mitochondrial biogenesis in skeletal myotubes, inhibits adipogenesis, decreases inflammation in adipocytes and macrophages and downregulates the expression of hepatic gluconeogenic enzymes. Transcription factor Nrf2 (Nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2) is a master regulator of antioxidant response, regulating a multitude of genes involved in cellular stress responses and anti-inflammatory pathways, thus maintaining cellular redox homeostasis. Nrf2 activation reduces the deleterious effects of mitochondrial toxins and has multiple roles in promoting mitochondrial function and dynamics. We studied the role of GR24 on gene expression in rat L6 skeletal muscle cells which were differentiated into myotubes. The myotubes were treated with GR24 and analyzed by microarray gene expression profiling. GR24 upregulated the cytoprotective transcription factor Nrf2 and its target genes, activating antioxidant defences, suggesting that GR24 may protect skeletal muscle from the toxic effects of oxidative stress.
Chemoresistance is a major therapeutic obstacle in the treatment of human pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). As an oxidative stress responsive transcription factor, nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) regulates the expression of cytoprotective genes. Nrf2 not only plays a critical role in chemoprevention, but also contributes to chemoresistance. In this study, we found that digoxin markedly reversed drug resistance of gemcitabine by inhibiting Nrf2 signaling in SW1990/Gem and Panc-1/Gem cells. Further research revealed that digoxin regulated Nrf2 at transcriptional level. In in vivo study, we found that digoxin and gemcitabine in combination inhibited tumor growth more substantially when compared with gemcitabine treatment alone in SW1990/Gem-shControl cells-derived xenografts. In the meantime, SW1990/Gem-shNrf2 cells-derived xenografts responded to gemcitabine and combination treatment similarly, suggesting that digoxin sensitized gemcitabine-resistant human pancreatic cancer to gemcitabine, which was Nrf2 dependent. These results demonstrated that digoxin might be used as a promising adjuvant sensitizer to reverse chemoresistance of gemcitabine-resistant pancreatic cancer to gemcitabine via inhibiting Nrf2 signaling.
Transcription factor nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) is a major regulator of antioxidant response element- (ARE-) driven cytoprotective protein expression. The activation of Nrf2 signaling plays an essential role in preventing cells and tissues from injury induced by oxidative stress. Under the unstressed conditions, natural inhibitor of Nrf2, Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1), traps Nrf2 in the cytoplasm and promotes the degradation of Nrf2 by the 26S proteasome. Nevertheless, stresses including highly oxidative microenvironments, impair the ability of Keap1 to target Nrf2 for ubiquitination and degradation, and induce newly synthesized Nrf2 to translocate to the nucleus to bind with ARE. Due to constant exposure to external environments, including diverse pollutants and other oxidants, the redox balance maintained by Nrf2 is fairly important to the airways. To date, researchers have discovered that Nrf2 deletion results in high susceptibility and severity of insults in various models of respiratory diseases, including bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), respiratory infections, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), and lung cancer. Conversely, Nrf2 activation confers protective effects on these lung disorders. In the present review, we summarize Nrf2 involvement in the pathogenesis of the above respiratory diseases that have been identified by experimental models and human studies and describe the protective effects of Nrf2 inducers on these diseases.
The extracts of different parts of Nerium oleander L. are used as antidiabetic remedy in the traditional medicinal systems of different parts of the world. Despite these uses in ethnomedicinal system, the antihyperglycemic potentials of oleander stem (NOSE) and root (NORE) extracts have not been pharmacologically evaluated. Therefore, we aimed at evaluating the antidiabetic ethnomedicinal claims of NOSE and NORE, primarily focusing on glucose homeostasis and associated metabolic implications. Alloxan-treated mice with hyperglycaemia (blood glucose &gt;200 mg/dL) were treated with oleander 70% hydromethanolic extracts (200 mg/kg) for 20 consecutive days, and the results were compared with positive control glibenclamide. Blood glucose level was 52-65% lowered (P &lt; 0.001) in oleander treated groups, which was otherwise 4.62 times higher in diabetic mice, compared to control. Insulin resistance was lowered 51-36% irrespective of any significant (P &gt; 0.05) changes in insulin sensitivity throughout the treatments. Improved serum insulin remained associated with lowered glucose level (rP = -0.847 and -0.772; P &lt; 0.01). Markers of hyperglycaemia-related hepatic glycogen, glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c), hyperlipidaemia, hepatic injury, and diabetic nephropathy were normalized as well. Improvement of systemic intrinsic antioxidant enzymes (catalase and peroxidase) were correlated (rP = -0.952 to -0.773; P &lt; 0.01) with lower lipid peroxidation by-product malondialdehyde (MDA) in the circulation. Principal component analysis coupled with hierarchical cluster analysis represented shift in metabolic homeostasis in diabetic mice, which was further normalized by oleander and glibenclamide treatment. Additionally, molecular docking studies of the phenolic acids measured by HPLC with intracellular cytoprotective transcription factor nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) revealed strong molecular interactions. The results collectively support the ethnomedicine antidiabetic claims of oleander stem and root and suggest that the oleander mediated elevation of systemic antioxidant status is likely responsible for the improved glycaemic control.
Glutathione (GSH or reduced glutathione) is a tripeptide of gamma-Glutamyl-cysteinyl-glycine and the predominant intracellular antioxidant in many organisms including humans. GSH and associated enzymes are controlled by a transcription factor-nuclear factor-2 related erythroid factor-2 (Nrf2). In cellular milieu, GSH protects the cells essentially against a wide variety of free radicals including reactive oxygen species, lipid hydroperoxides, xenobiotic toxicants, and heavy metals. It has two forms, the reduced form or reduced glutathione (GSH) and oxidized form (GSSG), where two GSH moieties combine by sulfhydryl bonds. Glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and glutathione-s-transferase (GST) essentially perform the detoxification reactions using GSH, converting it into GSSG. Glutathione reductase (GR) operates the salvage pathway by converting GSSG to GSH with the expense of NADPH and restores the cellular GSH pool. Hence, GSH and GSH-dependent enzymes are necessary for maintaining the normal redox balance in the body and help in cell survival under stress conditions. In addition, GST removes various carcinogenic compounds offering a chemopreventive property, whereas the GSH system plays a significant role in regulating the cellular survival by offering redox stability in a variety of cancers including prostate, lung, breast, and colon cancer. Studies have also indicated that GSH inhibitors, such as buthionine sulfoximine, improves the chemo-sensitivity in cancer cells. In addition, GSH and dependent enzymes provide survival advantage for cancer cells against chemotherapeutic drugs and radiotherapy.
Prothymosin-α (PTMA) is a small, acidic protein that is usually transported into the nucleus and involves many cellular and immunological functions. Previous studies demonstrated that aberrant location of PTMA expression exists in human bladder cancer, but the role of PTMA protein expression remains elusive. In this study, we created ectopic nuclear or cytoplasmic PTMA expression in human bladder cancer cells by infecting lentiviruses carrying wild type or deleted nuclear localization signal of the PTMA gene. The in vivo tumorigenesis assay showed PTMA protein with deleted nuclear localization signal promotes J82 xenograft tumor growth in mice and shortens their survival more so than the wild type. Chromatin immunoprecipitation showed that wild-type PTMA protein binds to the PTEN promoter and enhances phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) expression. Through immunoblot proteomics and in vivo ubiquitination studies, PTMA protein can bind with tripartite motif-containing protein 21 (TRIM21) and block its ubiquitination. Also, TRIM21 can downregulate both forms of PTMA protein. In human bladder tumors, loss of nuclear PTMA expression was an unfavorable prognostic indicator for shorter disease-free survival (hazard ratio, 1.54; P = 0.009). Our data support that nuclear PTMA protein serves as a tumor suppressor in bladder cancer through upregulating PTEN and orchestrating TRIM21 for the regulation of Nrf2 signaling.
Aluminum (Al) had well-identified adverse influences on the nervous system mainly through the creation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Melatonin works as an antioxidant through the inhibition of ROS and attenuating peroxidation of lipids. Nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (Nrf2) is a pivotal transcription factor which controls the transcription of antioxidant enzymes. This study was conducted to determine the potential neuroprophylactic impacts of melatonin in aluminum chloride (AlCl3)-initiated neurotoxicity including potential mechanism(s) of action and relevant signaling in rats. Thirty-six male rats were distributed into 4 groups: Control; AlCl3 (50 mg/kg bwt, i.p, 3 times weekly for 3 months); melatonin (5 mg/kg bwt, i.p daily for 2 weeks before AlCl3 and sustained for the next 3 months); and melatonin with AlCl3. Neuronal alterations were histopathologically and biochemically evaluated. The neuronal antioxidant-related genes and relevant Nrf2 protein expression were determined by real-time PCR and Western blotting, respectively. The current data showed a substantial increase in brain damage biomarkers, acetylecholinesterase (AchE) activity, and malondialdehyde (MDA) content while the enzymatic antioxidant expression as glutathione-s-transferase (GST), catalase (CAT), and superoxide dismutase (SOD) were substantially attenuated in the aluminum-treated group, with cleared histopathological changes as inflammatory cell infiltration with neuronal degeneration. Supplementation of melatonin resulted in an obvious amelioration in all previous abnormal alteration observed in AlCl3-treated rats rather than increased Al burden and/or altered Fe and Cu homeostasis with upregulating both total and phosphorylated Nrf2 expression. Therefore, the study concluded that melatonin has a potential ability to be neuroprophylactic against Al-induced neurotoxic effect and oxidative damage in the rat brain through upregulating and instigating Nrf2 signaling apart from metal chelation.
The JAK2-STAT signaling pathway plays a critical role in myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN). An activating mutation in JAK2 (V617F) is present in ~ 95% of polycythemia vera, essential thrombocythemia, and primary myelofibrosis cases. This study aims to explore the selective JAK2V617F inhibitor, evaluate the efficacy and possible mechanism of ZT55 on MPN.
HTRF assays were conducted to evaluate the selective inhibition of ZT55 for JAKs. Cell apoptosis, proliferation, and cycle arrest assays were performed to examine the effect of ZT55 on HEL cell line with JAK2V617F mutation in vitro. Western analysis was used to monitor the expression and activity of proteins on JAK2/STAT pathway. A mice xenograft model was established to evaluate the antitumor efficacy of ZT55 in vivo. Peripheral blood samples from patients with the JAK2V617F mutation were collected to estimate the effect of ZT55 on erythroid colony formation by colony-forming assay.
We found that ZT55 showed a selective inhibition of a 0.031 μM IC50 value against JAK2. It exhibited potent effects on the cellular JAK-STAT pathway, inhibiting tyrosine phosphorylation in JAK2V617F and downstream STAT3/5 transcription factors. ZT55 inhibited the proliferation of the JAK2V617F-expressing HEL cell line, leading to cell cycle arrest at the G2/M phase and induction of caspase-dependent apoptosis. Notably, ZT55 also significantly suppressed the growth of HEL xenograft tumors in vivo. Further evaluation indicated that ZT55 blocked erythroid colony formation of peripheral blood hematopoietic progenitors from patients carrying the JAK2V617F mutation.
These results suggest that ZT55 is a highly-selective JAK2 inhibitor that can induce apoptosis of human erythroleukemia cells by inhibiting the JAK2-STAT signaling.
Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), including arachidonic acid (AA), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), are essential for adequate fetal growth. The aim of the present study was to elucidate the effects of PUFAs on the expression and function of placental transporters, which play important roles in placental functions including the supply of nutrients to the fetus, excretion of metabolites, and protection of the fetus from xenobiotics.
Human placental choriocarcinoma BeWo cells were used as a trophoblast model. PUFA-induced alteration in the gene expression of 84 transporters was investigated by a commercially available PCR array. Protein levels and the activity of transporters were assessed by western blotting and uptake experiments, respectively. The placental expression of the transporters was analyzed using pregnant Wistar rats.
PUFAs (AA, EPA, and DHA) increased cystine/glutamate transporter xCT/SLC7A11, which mediates the cellular uptake of cystine coupled with the efflux of glutamate in human placental choriocarcinoma BeWo cells. These PUFAs also increased [14C]-cystine uptake in BeWo cells. PUFA-induced xCT/SLC7A11 mRNA expression was not blocked by nuclear factor-erythroid 2-related factor-2 (NRF2) knockdown. Reverse transcription (RT)-PCR analysis indicated that xCT/Slc7a11 mRNA was detected in rat placenta and the expression level at gestational day (GD) 12 was higher than that at GD 20.
These results indicate that PUFAs promoted cystine uptake in placental cells by inducing xCT/SLC7A11 expression and NRF2 did not contribute to upregulation of xCT/SLC7A11 by PUFAs. Furthermore, xCT expression in rat placenta may change during pregnancy.
Oxidative stress is involved in several carcinogenic pathways. Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor (Nrf2), Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1) and Park7 (DJ-1) are the main regulators of antioxidant enzymes eliminating reactive oxidative species (ROS). The roles of these proteins were studied as potential prognostic factors in endometrial cancer.
Nrf2, Keap1 and DJ-1 expression in endometrial carcinomas was analyzed immunohistochemically. Correlations between staining patterns and clinical prognostic variables were evaluated.
Extensive cytoplasmic Keap1 staining correlated to several factors associated with poor prognosis of endometrial cancer including advanced stage, poor histological differentiation, lymphovascular invasion, pelvic lymph node metastasis and deep myometrial invasion. In multivariate analysis, cytoplasmic Keap1 was a stronger predictor of poor progression-free survival than grade. Nuclear Nrf2 staining was seen in all patients with lymph node metastasis while DJ-1 staining was associated with clinically favourable disease types.
Cytoplasmic Keap1 expression indicates poor prognosis in endometrial cancer.
Disruption of Akt and Erk-mediated signal transduction significantly contributes in the pathogenesis of various neurodegenerative diseases (NDs), such as Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's diseases, Huntington's disease, and many others. These regulatory proteins serve as the regulator of cell survival, motility, transcription, metabolism, and progression of the cell cycle. Therefore, targeting Akt and Erk pathway has been proposed as a reasonable approach to suppress ND progression. This review has emphasized on involvement of Akt/Erk cascade in the neurodegeneration. Akt has been reported to regulate neuronal toxicity through its various substrates like FOXos, GSK3β, and caspase-9 etc. Akt is also involved with PI3K in signaling pathway to mediate neuronal survival. ERK is another kinase which also regulates proliferation, differentiation, and survival of the neural cell. There has also been much progress in developing a therapeutic molecule targeting Akt and Erk signaling. Therefore, improved understanding of the molecular mechanism behind the regulatory aspect of Akt and Erk networks can make strong impact on exploration of the neurodegenerative disease pathogenesis.
The transcription factor nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2) is a key regulator of the cellular antioxidant response, controlling the expression of genes that counteract oxidative and electrophilic stresses. Many pathological conditions are linked to imbalances in redox homeostasis, illustrating the important role of antioxidant defense systems in preventing the pathogenic effects associated with the accumulation of reactive species. In particular, it is becoming increasingly apparent that the accumulation of lipid peroxides has an important role in driving the pathogenesis of multiple disease states. A key example of this is the recent discovery of a novel form of cell death termed ferroptosis. Ferroptosis is an iron-dependent, lipid peroxidation-driven cell death cascade that has become a key target in the development of anti-cancer therapies, as well as the prevention of neurodegenerative and cardiovascular diseases. In this review, we will provide a brief overview of lipid peroxidation, as well as key components involved in the ferroptotic cascade. We will also highlight the role of the NRF2 signaling pathway in mediating lipid peroxidation and ferroptosis, focusing on established NRF2 target genes that mitigate these pathways, as well as the relevance of the NRF2-lipid peroxidation-ferroptosis axis in disease.
Mitochondrial dysfunction during aging is a key factor that contributes to sarcopenia. Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) has been increasingly recognized to regulate mitochondrial function. The present study aimed to investigate the role of Nrf2 in the development of frailty and sarcopenia during aging, and to demonstrate whether Nrf2 contributes to the maintenance of muscle mass and function by regulation of mitochondrial biogenesis and dynamics during the aging process.
Young (5-6 months), middle-aged (11-13 months), old (20-24 months) Nrf2-/- (knockout, KO) mice and age-matched wild-type (WT) C57/BL6 mice were used in this study. Physical function of the mice in the 6 groups was assessed by grip strength test, four paw inverted hanging test, rotarod analysis, open field analysis, and treadmill endurance test. Muscle mass was measured by cross-sectional area (CSA) of tibialis anterior muscles and gastrocnemius muscle weight. The frailty status of the 25 old WT mice and 23 old KO mice were assessed based on the mouse frailty phenotype assessment. Expression levels of genes involved in mitochondrial biogenesis (nuclear respiratory factor 1 (Nrf1), peroxisome proliferative activated receptor, gamma, coactivator 1 alpha (PGC-1α), mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM)) and mitochondrial dynamics (optic atrophy protein 1 (Opa1), mitofusin 1 (Mfn1), mitofusin 2 (Mfn2), and dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1)) were measured in the skeletal muscle. SDH staining was performed and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) copy number was measured. Transmission electron microscopy was used to measure the mitochondria number and morphology.
Physical function and muscle mass decreased during aging. The mRNA expression levels of Nrf2 decreased with increasing frailty phenotype scores in the old WT mice. There were minimal differences in the physical function and muscle mass between the WT and KO mice in the young groups, whereas Nrf2 deficiency caused a declined physical function and muscle mass in the middle-aged and old mice, and exacerbated frailty in the old mice. The decreases of the physical function and muscle mass were accompanied by the reduced expression levels of genes involved in mitochondrial biogenesis and dynamics, as well as a reduction of mitochondrial number, mitochondrial content, mtDNA copy number, and an impaired mitochondria morphology in the skeletal muscle.
Nrf2 deficiency exacerbated frailty and sarcopenia during aging, at least partially by impairing skeletal muscle mitochondrial biogenesis and dynamics in an age-dependent manner.
Despite the progress that has occurred in recent years in the development of therapies to treat painful and inflammatory diseases, there is still a need for effective and potent analgesics and anti-inflammatory drugs. It has long been known that several types of antioxidants also possess analgesic and anti-inflammatory properties, indicating a strong relationship between inflammation and oxidative stress. Understanding the underlying mechanisms of action of anti-inflammatory and analgesic drugs, as well as essential targets in disease physiopathology, is essential to the development of novel therapeutic strategies. The Nuclear factor-2 erythroid related factor-2 (Nrf2) is a transcription factor that regulates cellular redox status through endogenous antioxidant systems with simultaneous anti-inflammatory activity. This review summarizes the molecular mechanisms and pharmacological actions screened that link analgesic, anti-inflammatory, natural products, and other therapies to Nrf2 as a regulatory system based on emerging evidences from experimental disease models and new clinical trial data.
The growing production and extensive use of organophosphate flame retardants (OPFRs) have led to an increase in their environmental distribution and human exposure. Developmental toxicity is a major concern of OPFRs' adverse health effects. However, the impact of OPFRs exposure on vascular development and the toxicity pathway for developmental defects are poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the effects of exposure to tris(1,3-dichloro-2-propyl) phosphate (TDCPP), a frequently detected OPFR, on early vascular development, and the possible role of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor (Nrf2)-dependent angiogenic pathway in TDCPP's vascular toxicity. TDCPP exposure at 300 and 500 μg/L impeded the growth of intersegmental vessels (ISV), a type of microvessels, as early as 30 hpf. Consistently, a similar pattern of decreased extension and remodeling of common cardinal vein (CCV), a typical macrovessel, was observed in zebrafish at 48 hpf and 72 hpf. Developing vasculature in zebrafish was more sensitive than general developmental parameters to TDCPP exposure. The expression of genes related to VEGF signaling pathway dose-dependently decreased in TDCPP-treated larvae. In in vitro experiments using human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), the increased cell proliferation induced by VEGF was suppressed by TDCPP exposure in a dose-dependent fashion. In addition, we found a repression of Nrf2 expression and activity in TDCPP-treated larvae and HUVECs. Strikingly, the application of CDDO-Im, a potent Nrf2 activator, enhanced VEGF and protected against defective vascular development in zebrafish. Our results reveal that vascular impairment is a sensitive index for early exposure to TDCPP, which could be considered in the environmental risk assessment of OPFRs. The identification of Nrf2-mediating VEGF pathway provides new insight into the adverse outcome pathway (AOP) of OPFRs.
Prolonged parenchymal cell death leads to activation of fibrogenic cells and extracellular matrix accumulation and eventually liver fibrosis. Autophagy, a major catabolic process of intracellular degradation and recycling, participates in hepatic fibrosis. However, the precise role of autophagy in the pathogenesis of hepatic fibrosis is controversial. The present study aims to investigate the key role of small VCP/p97 interacting protein (SVIP) against CCl4-induced hepatic fibrosis via activating autophagy. Autophagy could be activated by SVIP in HepG2 cells, but starvation cannot increase SVIP expression in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, SVIP expression, in agreement with autophagic activity and the volume of lipid droplets, first increases and then decreases during the progression of liver fibrosis with CCl4 treatment in vivo and in vivo. Further, overexpression of SVIP can protect HepG2 cells from the toxicity of CCl4, which could be enhanced by starvation. Finally, starvation keeps SVIP and autophagy at such high levels in the rat livers that markedly delays the progress of hepatic fibrosis. Probably, the protective effect of SVIP is associated with stabilizing nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and transcription factor EB (TFEB). The current study provides insight into the biological role of SVIP and autophagy in regulating hepatic fibrosis, targeting SVIP might be a novel therapeutic strategy in the future.
Administration of dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) in drinking water led to significant bout of colitis simulating ulcerative colitis of human. However, colitis usually developed 5 - 7 days after DSS administration. Therefore, we hypothesized host defense system might protect colitis up to 5 days of DSS administration. 2.5% DSS-induced colitis were administered to C57BL/6 mice and sequential measurements of pathology, cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), NADPH quinone oxidoreductase-1 (NQO1), γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase (γ-GCS), nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor-2 (Nrf2), and keap1 were done at 2, 6, 12, 24, 48, 96, 120, and 168 hour of DSS administration, respectively. DSS-induced colitis was repeated in either COX-2-/- or Nrf2-/- mice. On serial pathological analysis, significant colitis was noted after 120 h of DSS administration, during which both activations of COX-2/NF-κB and HO-1/Nrf2 were noted. Nrf2 activations after keap1 inactivation led to significant increases in HO-1 after 168 hours of DSS administration, when NF-κB nuclear translocation was noted. Significantly attenuated colitis was noted in DSS-challenged COX-2-/- mice, in which the levels of HO-1 were significantly decreased compared to DSS-challenged WT littermates (p &lt; 0.01), while the levels of NQO1 were significantly increased. On DSS administration to Nrf2-/- mice, colitis was significantly aggravated (p &lt; 0.01), in which the expressions of COX-2 as well as expressions of HO-1 and γ-GCS were significantly increased (p &lt; 0.01). Reciprocal activations of inflammatory and antioxidative defense signaling after DSS administration might be prerequisite to make intestinal homeostasis and host defense Nrf2 system can determine colitis.
Triptolide (TP), as the main component of Tripterygium wilfordii (TW), could induce significant hepatic damage when exerting the therapeutic effect. However, The previous studies have shown that catalpol (CAT) and panax notoginseng saponins (PNS) have synergistic protecting effect against hepatotoxicity induced by TP. This study aims to address the role of the nuclear factor erythroid-2-related factor-2 (Nrf2)/antioxidant response element (ARE) pathway in their protecting effect, and to explore their synergistic mechanisms. For this purpose, the human hepatocyte cell line L-02 was selected, and the synergistic antioxidative effect of CAT and PNS was confirmed. Then the effects of CAT and PNS on different aspects of the Nrf2/ARE pathway were analyzed. The results showed that CAT significantly reduced TP-induced inhibition of Nrf2 transcription and made it increased, PNS significantly increased Nrf2 phosphorylation for relieving TP-induced potential inhibition of Nrf2/ARE binding activity, while the combination of the two further enhanced their activation by synergistically inducing Nrf2 transcriptional expression and phosphorylated Nrf2 (p-Nrf2) expression, followed with NAD(P)H:quinine oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1) expression and glutathione (GSH) activity increasing, which further enhanced their antioxidative effects. Subsequently, the gene silencing techniques were used, and that the Nrf2/ARE pathway is necessary in this effect was confirmed. In conclusion, the synergistic protecting effect of CAT and PNS is dependent on Nrf2/ARE pathway, while the natural mutual promotion between the regulatory links of CAT and PNS may be the main source of the synergistic effect.
In the majority of cases, the cognitive and behavioral impairments resulting from a mild traumatic brain injury (TBI) (also referred to as concussion) wane within days to weeks. In contrast, these impairments can persist for months to years after repetitive mild TBI (rmTBI). The cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying these impairments are not well understood. In the present study, we examined the consequences of rmTBI (three weight drops each separated by 72 h) on brain tissue respiration, pathology, and cognitive performance in mice. The transcription factor nuclear factor-erythroid 2-realted factor 2 (Nrf2) has been demonstrated to enhance the expression of numerous cytoprotective genes. Carnosic acid (CA) has been shown to activate Nrf2 and suppress the proinflammatory transcription factor nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB). Because contemporaneous activation of cytoprotective genes and inhibition of proinflammatory genes can be beneficial, we questioned whether CA can be used to mitigate the pathobiology of rmTBI. The rmTBI increased hippocampal adenosine triphosphate-linked tissue respiration and proton leak that were unaffected by CA treatment. The rmTBI also caused significant motor and cognitive dysfunction, as tested using the foot fault, Barnes maze, and novel object recognition tasks. These impairments occurred in the absence of visible neuronal or dendritic loss. Post-rmTBI administration of CA significantly improved motor and cognitive function, and decreased Gfap and Iba1 immunoreactivities within white matter tracks. Taken together, these results show that rmTBI can cause cognitive impairments in the absence of overt neuronal pathologies, and post-injury treatment with CA can lessen some of these impairments.
Livotrit®, a polyherbal formulation (Zandu, India) is commonly prescribed for liver health. The present study was undertaken to elucidate possible mechanism of antioxidant potential of Livotrit®. Livotrit® exhibited concentration dependent radical scavenging activity, inhibition of lipid peroxidation as well as activation and gene expression of antioxidant enzymes. Interestingly, lower concentration of Livotrit® (0.05%) significantly increased activities and gene expression of catalase, Glutathione reductase (GR) and Gluthathione peroxidase (GPx), while higher concentration of Livotrit® (0.5%) significantly increased antioxidant enzyme Heme-oxygenase 1(HO-1) and not catalase (CAT), GR and GPx. Transcription factor, Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) required for expression of catalase, GR, GPx and HO-1 was efficiently translocated into the nucleus at both concentrations. Inspite of this, concentration dependent activation of these enzymes was found to be mediated through miRNAs involved in regulation of their gene expression.
Low molecular weight seleno-aminopolysaccharide (LSA) is an organic selenium compound comprising selenium and low molecular weight aminopolysaccharide (LA), a low molecular weight natural linear polysaccharide derived from chitosan. LSA has been found to exert strong pharmacological activity. In this study, we aimed to investigate the protective effect of LSA on intestinal mucosal oxidative stress in a weaning piglet model by detecting the growth performance, intestinal mucosal structure, antioxidant indices, and expression level of intracellular transcription factor nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and its related factors. Our results indicated that LSA significantly increased the average daily gain and feed/gain (p &lt; 0.05), suggesting that LSA can effectively promote the growth of weaning piglets. The results of scanning electron microscope (SEM) microscopy showed that LSA effectively reduced intestinal damage, indicating that LSA improved the intestinal stress response and protected the intestinal structure integrity. In addition, diamine oxidase (DAO) and d-lactic acid (d-LA) levels remarkably decreased in LSA group compared with control group (p &lt; 0.05), suggesting that LSA alleviated the damage and permeability of weaning piglets. LSA significantly increased superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), and total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC) levels, but decreased malondialdehyde (MDA) level, indicating that LSA significantly enhanced the antioxidant capacity and reduced oxidative stress in weaning piglets. RT-PCR results showed that LSA significantly increased GSH-Px1, GSH-Px2, SOD-1, SOD-2, CAT, Nrf2, HO-1, and NQO1 gene expression (p &lt; 0.05). Western blot analysis revealed that LSA activated the Nrf2 signaling pathway by downregulating the expression of Keap1 and upregulating the expression of Nrf2 to protect intestinal mucosa against oxidative stress. Collectively, LSA reduced intestinal mucosal damage induced by oxidative stress via Nrf2-Keap1 pathway in weaning stress of infants.
We determined if HIV-1 expression in transgenic (HIV-1-Tg) rats enhanced hepatic genomic changes related to oxidative/nitrosative stress and lipogenesis during cART-treatment, and assessed effects of Mg-supplementation. A clinically used cART (atazanavir-ritonavir+Truvada) was given orally to control and HIV-1-Tg rats (18 weeks) with normal or 6-fold dietary-Mg. Oxidative/nitrosative and lipogenic genes were determined by real-time RT-PCR. cART induced a 4-fold upregulation of sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1 (SREBP-1) in HIV-1-Tg-rats, but not in controls; Tg rats displayed a 2.5-fold higher expression. Both were completely prevented by Mg-supplementation. Nrf2 (Nuclear erythroid-derived factor 2), a master transcription factor controlling redox homeostasis, was down-regulated 50% in HIV-Tg rats, and reduced further to 25% in Tg+cART-rats. Two downstream antioxidant genes, heme oxygenase-1(HmOX1) and Glutathione-S-transferase(GST), were elevated in HIV-Tg alone but were suppressed by cART treatment. Decreased Nrf2 in Tg±cART were normalized by Mg-supplementation along with the reversal of altered HmOX1 and GST expression. Concomitantly, iNOS (inducible nitric oxide synthase) was upregulated 2-fold in Tg+cART rats, which was reversed by Mg-supplementation. In parallel, cART-treatment led to substantial increases in plasma 8-isoprostane, nitrotyrosine, and RBC-GSSG (oxidized glutathione) levels in HIV-1-Tg rats; all indices of oxidative/nitrosative stress were suppressed by Mg-supplementation. Both plasma triglyceride and cholesterol levels were elevated in Tg+cART rats, but were lowered by Mg-supplementation. Thus, the synergistic effects of cART and HIV-1 expression on lipogenic and oxidative/nitrosative effects were revealed at the genomic and biochemical levels. Down-regulation of Nrf2 in the Tg+cART rats suggested their antioxidant response was severely compromised; these abnormal metabolic and oxidative stress effects were effectively attenuated by Mg-supplementation at the genomic level.
Xiaochaihutang (XCHT) is one of classic prescriptions in Treatise on Febrile Diseases in China which was reported to have the effect of anti-hepatic fibrosis in vivo. Activation of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) is now well established as a central driver of fibrosis in liver injury. Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) is an important element for anti-oxidative damage which is one of the key factors responsible for occurrence. This study was to investigate the effect of XCHT compound serum on HSCs activation and focus on the Nrf2 pathway. Rats in treatment groups were given the appropriate doses of XCHT granules (5 g/kg) and Silybin (50 mg/kg) for 6 days, and the serum were obtained. The compound serum was used to intervene HSCs. The results found that XCHT compound serum significantly inhibited the proliferation of HSCT6 cells. The number of α-SMA positive stained cells in HSCT6 cells and the content of Collagen type I (collagen-I) in supernatant were significantly decreased indicating suppression of activated HSCs. Compared with the control group, the nuclear transcription of Nrf2 and the expressions of Nqo1, GCLC, and GCLM were significantly increased in XCHT group. However, the effects of XCHT were inhibited in Nrf2-siRNA transfected HSCT6 cells. These studies demonstrated that XCHT could inhibit HSCT6 cell proliferation and activation. The mechanism might be related to up-regulation of the Nrf2 pathway against oxidative stress.
Oxidative stress-induced damage of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) is a major contributor to retinal degenerative diseases, such as glaucoma. Sirtuin 6 (SIRT6) has emerged as a cytoprotective protein against various insults. However, whether SIRT6 exerts a protective effect against oxidative stress-damaged RGCs remains unknown. In this study, we aimed to investigate the potential role and regulatory mechanism of SIRT6 in hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)-induced oxidative damage of RGCs in vitro. We found that SIRT6 expression was significantly downregulated in RGCs with H2O2 treatment. Functional experiments showed that overexpression of SIRT6 improved survival and reduced apoptosis and the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in H2O2-treated RGCs. In contrast, SIRT6 knockdown had the opposite effect. Moreover, we found that SIRT6 overexpression promoted the nuclear accumulation of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and increased the activity of antioxidant response element (ARE). In addition, we found that the promotional effect of SIRT6 on Nrf2/ARE signaling was associated with inhibition of BTB and CNC homology 1 (Bach1), an inhibitor of Nrf2. However, overexpression of Bach1 or inhibition of Nrf2/ARE signaling partially reversed the SIRT6-mediated protective effect. Taken together, these results demonstrate that SIRT6 protects RGCs from oxidative stress-induced damage by promoting the activation of Nrf2/ARE signaling via inhibition of Bach1, suggesting a potential role of SIRT6 in retinal degenerative diseases.
In recent years, various studies have confirmed the role of natural products as effective cancer prevention and treatment drugs. The present study demonstrated that chitosan oligosaccharide (COS) from shells of shrimp and crab caused an inhibitory effect on the proliferation of human renal carcinoma in vitro and in vivo. First, the in vivo biodistribution of COS was investigated by the synthesis of cyanine-7-labeled COS (COS-Cy7) following tail vein injection. The kidney was found to be a major target organ. Then, the impacts on renal carcinoma cell proliferation, apoptosis, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production were observed in vitro, and an orthotopic xenograft tumor model was designed to evaluate the antitumor efficacy of COS in vivo. In renal carcinoma cells, COS induced G2/M phase arrest and apoptosis in a ROS-dependent fashion. COS significantly promoted mRNA expression of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor (Nrf2) and Nrf2 target genes, such as heme oxygenase 1, modifier subunit of glutamate cysteine ligase, and solute carrier family 7 member 11. Additionally, COS significantly upregulated the protein expression of glucose-regulated protein 78, protein RNA-like endoplasmic reticulum (ER) kinase, eukaryotic initiation factor 2α, activating transcription factor 4, C/EBP homologous protein, and cytochrome c, which justified the activation of the ER stress signaling pathway. In vivo, COS repressed tumor growth and induced apoptosis and ROS accumulation, consistent with the in vitro results. Taken together, COS repressed human renal carcinoma growth and induced apoptosis both in vitro and in vivo, mainly via ROS-dependent ER stress pathways.
To investigate the effect of tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA) on neurological impairment induced by acute cerebral infarction (ACI) and its relevant mechanism of action.
A total of 60 male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were randomly divided into Sham group (n = 20), ACI group (n = 20), and TUDCA group (n = 20). The rat model of ACI in middle cerebral artery was established. TUDCA was intravenously injected into rats in the TUDCA group, while an equal amount of sodium bicarbonate solution was intravenously injected into the other two groups. The blood was drawn after modeling to detect the content of serum glutamate (Glu), triglyceride (TG), total cholesterol (TC), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). The degree of cerebral infarction in each experimental group was observed under an optical microscope, and the infarct area was measured and compared. The content of serum tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-8 (IL-8), and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) was detected via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA); mRNA and protein expressions of them were detected using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Western blotting, respectively, followed by statistical analysis. Moreover, the expression levels of serum malondialdehyde (MDA), oxidized-LDL (ox-LDL), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and glutathione peroxidase (GPX) were detected, followed by statistical analysis. The protein expressions of nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (Nrf2), very low-density lipoprotein receptor (VLDLR), nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), B-cell lymphoma 2-associated X protein (Bax), and caspase-3 were detected via Western blotting, and the gray value was determined, followed by statistical analysis.
TUDCA could improve the symptoms of neurological impairment in ACI patients, decrease the National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score but increase the activity of daily living (ADL) score of patients, and significantly reduce the content of serum TG, TC, and LDL-C, showing statistically significant differences (p &lt; 0.05). TUDCA significantly decreased the serum Glu content in ACI rats, reduced the cerebral infarction area and lowered the serum TG, TC, and LDL-C content, displaying statistically significant differences (p &lt; 0 .05). Besides, TUDCA inhibited mRNA and protein expressions of TNF-α, IL-8, and hs-CRP, and alleviated the inflammatory response. TUDCA inhibited MDA and ox-LDL expressions, but increased SOD and GPX expressions, and relieved oxidative stress injury. In addition, TUDCA could negatively regulate Nrf2 signaling pathway, and down-regulated VLDLR and NF-κB protein expressions and expressions of apoptotic proteins (Bax and caspase-3).
TUDCA can alleviate the ACI-induced neurological impairment in rats through mitigating lipid peroxidation and inflammatory response and reducing apoptosis, whose relevant mechanism may be that TUDCA negatively regulates Nrf2 signaling pathway.
Alcoholic liver disease (ALD) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Oxidative stress induced during the alcohol metabolism plays a crucial role in ALD, and clinical evidence demonstrates the prevalence and risks of vitamin D (VD) deficiency in ALD. This study aims to explore the mechanism of VD administration to ameliorate alcohol-induced cell injury.
VD activates NRF2 (nuclear factor erythroid 2 (NF-E2)-related factor 2) signals along with upregulation of ALDH2 expression. Knockdown of NRF2 eliminates the protective effects of VD treatment. ALDH2 knockdown not only partially affects this protection, but also mildly reduces NRF2 expression. ALDH2 overexpression enhances ERK phosphorylation and upregulated NRF2 transcription via a newly identified TRE in the exon 1 of NRF2.
This study provides evidence that VD protects against alcohol-induced cell injury within an NRF2-ALDH2 feedback loop. NRF2 induced by VD could transcriptionally upregulate ALDH2 expression to help metabolize alcohol. TRE-driven transcriptional upregulation of NRF2 through ALDH2-ERK/MEK signals would further exert the anti-oxidant effects. The study explores a novel potential protection of VD in alcohol-induced liver cell injury, and contributes to alcohol-related liver disease nutritional therapies.
Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is a leading cause of end-stage renal failure, and no effective treatment is available. Notoginsenoside R1 (NGR1) is a novel saponin that is derived from Panax notoginseng, and our previous studies showed the cardioprotective and neuroprotective effects of NGR1. However, its role in protecting against DN remains unexplored. Herein, we established an experimental model in db/db mice and HK-2 cells exposed to advanced glycation end products (AGEs). The in vivo investigation showed that NGR1 treatment increased serum lipid, β2-microglobulin, serum creatinine, and blood urea nitrogen levels of db/db mice. NGR1 attenuated histological abnormalities of kidney, as evidenced by reducing the glomerular volume and fibrosis in diabetic kidneys. In vitro, NGR1 treatment was further found to decrease AGE-induced mitochondria injury, limit an increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS), and reduce apoptosis in HK-2 cells. Mechanistically, NGR1 promoted nucleus nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) expressions to eliminate ROS that induced apoptosis and transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) signaling. In summary, these observations demonstrate that NGR1 exerts renoprotective effects against DN through the inhibition of apoptosis and renal fibrosis caused by oxidative stress. NGR1 might be a potential therapeutic medicine for the treatment of DN.
Acetaminophen (APAP) overdose-induced acute liver failure (ALF) is mainly resulted from uncontrolled oxidative stress. Nuclear factor-erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), a key antioxidant transcription factor, is essential for alleviating APAP-induced hepatotoxicity. Corilagin (Cori) is a natural polyphenol compound that possesses effective antioxidant activity; however, the protective effect of Cori on APAP-induced hepatotoxicity is still unknown. The current study aimed to explore whether Cori could mitigate hepatotoxicity caused by APAP and the underlying molecular mechanisms of action.
Cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) assays, Western blotting analysis, dual-luciferase reporter assays, a mouse model, CRISPR/Cas9 knockout technology, and hematoxylin-eosin (H &amp; E) staining were employed to explore the mechanisms by which Cori exerts a protective effect on hepatotoxicity in HepG2 cells and in a mouse model.
Our findings suggested that Cori efficiently decreased APAP-triggered the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and cell death in HepG2 cells. Additionally, Cori significantly induced the expression of several antioxidant enzymes, and this induced expression was closely linked to the upregulation of Nrf2, inhibition of Keap1 protein expression, and promotion of antioxidant response element (ARE) activity in HepG2 cells. Moreover, Cori clearly induced the phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK3β), liver kinase B1 (LKB1) and acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC). Furthermore, Cori-mediated GSK3β inactivation, Nrf2 upregulation and cytoprotection were abolished by an AMPK inhibitor (Compound C) in HepG2 cells. Lastly, we found that Cori inhibited APAP-induced hepatotoxicity and mediated the expression of many antioxidant enzymes; these results were reversed in Nrf2 -/- HepG2 cells. In vivo, Cori significantly protected against APAP-induced ALF by reducing mortality and alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels, attenuating histopathological liver changes, inhibiting myeloperoxidase (MPO) and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels, and increasing the superoxide dismutase (SOD) content and GSH-to-GSSG ratio as well as suppressing c-jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) phosphorylation. However, Cori-induced reductions in mortality, AST and ALT levels, and histopathological liver changes induced by APAP were clearly abrogated in Nrf2-deficienct mice.
These findings principally indicated that Cori effectively protects against APAP-induced ALF via the upregulation of the AMPK/GSK3β-Nrf2 signaling pathway.
The goal of current investigations was to reveal the molecular mechanism triggered through feeding a diet with high-concentrate to dairy cows for subacute ruminal acidosis (SARA) induction and to examine the oxidative stress parameters in their mammary epithelial tissue. In an eighteen-weeks feeding trial, 12 Holstein Friesian cows with a standard weight of 455 ± 28 kg were evenly divided into two groups and given either a low-concentrate (LC, forage to concentrate ratio = 6:4) or a high-concentrate (HC, forage to concentrate ratio = 4:6) diet. A remarkable reduction in ruminal pH also increased ruminal lipopolysaccharide (LPS) concentration that was observed in the high-concentrate group of cows at 4 h post-feeding in the morning. Moreover, reduced milk yield was observed in the HC group. The relative mRNA abundance of glutathione peroxidase (GPX) 1 and 3 and superoxide dismutase (SOD) 1 and 2 were down-regulated in high-concentrate fed animals than in the LC, while mRNA was expressed with no change in the of SOD3 among groups. In addition, genes responsible for oxidative stress e.g., ERK, JNK, and p38 were also showed dramatically high mRNA intensity in HC group. The protein concentration of ERK, pERK, pJNK, with pp38, were up-regulated significantly as JNK &amp; p38 showed no big difference. While Nrf2 and pNrf2 were down-regulated considerably in HC group. The total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC) was significantly decreased but of Malondialdehyde (MDA) concentration was raised in HC group than in LC. We thus proposed that higher levels of endogenous LPS may affect the Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) and nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2)-dependent antioxidant response.
Melatonin has protective roles in normal cells and cytotoxic actions in cancer cells, with effects involving autophagy and nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (Nrf2) transcription factor pathways. Hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R) induces oxidative damage and apoptosis. These consequences activate autophagy, which degrades damaged cellular content, as well as activates Nrf2 the nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (Nrf2) transcription factor, and thereby the expression of protective genes. Melatonin has protective roles in normal cells and cytotoxic actions in cancer cells, with effects involving autophagy and Nrf2 pathways. The current study shows melatonin to differentially modulate autophagy and Nrf2 pathways in tumor and normal placental cells exposed to H/R. BeWo, a human placental choriocarcinoma cell line, and primary villous cytotrophoblasts isolated from normal term placenta, were maintained in normoxia (8% O2) for 24 h or exposed to hypoxia (0.5% of O2 for 4 h) followed by 20 h of normoxia, creating a situation of H/R, in the presence or absence of 1 mM melatonin. Melatonin induced a 7-fold increase in the activation of 5' adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK)α, an upstream modulator of autophagy, rising to a 16-fold increase in BeWo cells co-exposed to H/R and melatonin, compared to controls. H/R induced autophagosome formation via the increased expression of Beclin-1 (by 94%) and ATG7 (by 97%) in BeWo cells. Moreover, H/R also induced autophagic activity, indicated by the by the 630% increase in P62, and increased Nrf2 by 314% in BeWo cells. In H/R conditions, melatonin reduced autophagic activity by 74% and Nrf2 expression activation by 300%, leading to BeWo cell apoptosis. In contrast, In human primary villous cytotrophoblasts, H/R induced autophagy and Nrf2, which melatonin further potentiated, thereby affording protection against H/R. This study demonstrates that melatonin differentially modulates autophagy and the Nrf2 pathway in normal vs. tumor trophoblast cells, being cytoprotective in normal cells whilst increasing apoptosis in tumoral trophoblast cells.
The importance of gut microbiota in human health and pathophysiology is undisputable. Despite the abundance of metagenomics data, the functional dynamics of gut microbiota in human health and disease remain elusive. Urolithin A (UroA), a major microbial metabolite derived from polyphenolics of berries and pomegranate fruits displays anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidative, and anti-ageing activities. Here, we show that UroA and its potent synthetic analogue (UAS03) significantly enhance gut barrier function and inhibit unwarranted inflammation. We demonstrate that UroA and UAS03 exert their barrier functions through activation of aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR)- nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2)-dependent pathways to upregulate epithelial tight junction proteins. Importantly, treatment with these compounds attenuated colitis in pre-clinical models by remedying barrier dysfunction in addition to anti-inflammatory activities. Cumulatively, the results highlight how microbial metabolites provide two-pronged beneficial activities at gut epithelium by enhancing barrier functions and reducing inflammation to protect from colonic diseases.
Diabetes mellitus is a well-recognized risk factor for periodontitis. The goal of the present study was to elucidate whether oxidative stress and nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) participate in the aggravation of periodontitis by diabetes. For this purpose, we assigned Wistar rats to control, periodontitis, diabetes, and diabetic periodontitis groups. Two weeks after induction of diabetes by streptozotocin, periodontitis was induced by ligation. Two weeks later, periodontal tissues and blood were harvested and analyzed by stereomicroscopy, immunohistochemistry, and real-time polymerase chain reaction. We found that ligation induced more severe bone loss and periodontal cell apoptosis in diabetic rats than in normal rats (p &lt; 0.05). Compared with the control group, periodontitis significantly enhanced local oxidative damage (elevated expression of 3-nitrotyrosine, 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal, and 8-hydroxy-deoxyguanosine), whereas diabetes significantly increased systemic oxidative damage and suppressed antioxidant capacity (increased malondialdehyde expression and decreased superoxide dismutase activity) (p &lt; 0.05). Simultaneous periodontitis and diabetes synergistically aggravated both local and systemic oxidative damage (p &lt; 0.05); this finding was strongly correlated with the more severe periodontal destruction in diabetic periodontitis. Furthermore, gene and protein expression of Nrf2 was significantly downregulated in diabetic periodontitis (p &lt; 0.05). Multiple regression analysis indicated that the reduced Nrf2 expression was strongly correlated with the aggravated periodontal destruction and oxidative damage in diabetic periodontitis. We conclude that enhanced local and systemic oxidative damage and Nrf2 downregulation contribute to the development and progression of diabetic periodontitis.
Recent advances in single-cell molecular analytical methods and clonal growth assays are enabling more refined models of human hematopoietic lineage restriction processes to be conceptualized. Here, we report the results of integrating single-cell proteome measurements with clonally determined lymphoid, neutrophilic/monocytic, and/or erythroid progeny outputs from &gt;1000 index-sorted CD34+ human cord blood cells in short-term cultures with and without stromal cells. Surface phenotypes of functionally examined cells were individually mapped onto a molecular landscape of the entire CD34+ compartment constructed from single-cell mass cytometric measurements of 14 cell surface markers, 20 signaling/cell cycle proteins, and 6 transcription factors in ∼300 000 cells. This analysis showed that conventionally defined subsets of CD34+ cord blood cells are heterogeneous in their functional properties, transcription factor content, and signaling activities. Importantly, this molecular heterogeneity was reduced but not eliminated in phenotypes that were found to display highly restricted lineage outputs. Integration of the complete proteomic and functional data sets obtained revealed a continuous probabilistic topology of change that includes a multiplicity of lineage restriction trajectories. Each of these reflects progressive but variable changes in the levels of specific signaling intermediates and transcription factors but shared features of decreasing quiescence. Taken together, our results suggest a model in which increasingly narrowed hematopoietic output capabilities in neonatal CD34+ cord blood cells are determined by a history of external stimulation in combination with innately programmed cell state changes.
The skin provides an effective barrier against physical, chemical, and microbial invasion; however, overexposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation causes excessive cellular oxidative stress, which leads to skin damage, DNA damage, mutations, and skin cancer. This study investigated the protective effects of N-phenethyl caffeamide (K36) from UVA damage on human epidermal keratinocytes. We found that K36 reduced UVA-induced intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and induced the expression of the intrinsic antioxidant enzyme heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) by increasing the translocation of nuclear factor erythroid 2⁻related factor 2 (Nrf2). K36 could inhibit the phosphorylation of extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK) and reduce UVA-induced matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-1 and MMP-2 overexpression; it could also elevate the expression of tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMP). In addition, K36 ameliorated 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) induced by UVA irradiation. Furthermore, K36 could downregulate the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) and the subsequent production of nitric oxide (NO) and prostaglandin E₂ (PGE₂). Based on our findings, K36 possessed potent antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antiphotodamage, and even antiphotocarcinogenesis activities. Thus, K36 has the potential to be used to multifunctional skin care products and drugs.
Nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (Nrf2) is a transcription factor that mediates a broad range of cellular antioxidative, detoxification and anti-inflammatory effects. However, the precise mechanism by which Nrf2 regulates inflammation and metabolism in macrophages remains controversial and unclear. To further clarify the roles of Nrf2 in inflammation and glucose metabolism regulation, retrovirus-mediated knockdown of Nrf2 was performed in murine RAW264.7 macrophages, and the cells were stimulated with 100 ng/mL lipopolysaccharide for 24 h for M1 activation. qPCR and western blotting results indicated that Nrf2 knockdown significantly enhanced expression of the inflammatory genes Il1a and Il1b in unstimulated macrophages and increased expression of the inflammatory genes Il1a, Il1b, Il6, Il10, Ccl2, Ccl22, and CD38 but decreased that of Tnfa and Tgfb1 in M1 macrophages. Nrf2 knockdown also significantly elevated IL6 and IL10 secretion by M1 macrophages. Western blotting showed that Nrf2 knockdown reduced iNOS protein levels in resting macrophages and enhanced CD38 protein levels in both resting and M1 macrophages. The differential regulation of these macrophage inflammation and polarization markers by Nrf2 reveals multiple roles for Nrf2 in regulating inflammation in macrophages. Moreover, Nrf2 knockdown increased the Glu4 protein level and decreased AKT and GSK3β protein phosphorylation in M1 macrophages, suggesting multiple roles for Nrf2 in regulating glucose metabolism in macrophages. Overall, our results are the first to demonstrate mixed inflammation and glucose metabolism regulatory effects of Nrf2 in macrophages that may occur independent of its classic function in redox regulation. These findings support the potential of Nrf2 as a therapeutic target for the prevention and treatment of inflammation- and obesity-associated syndromes, including diabetes and atherosclerosis.
Increased muscle contractile activity, as observed with regular exercise, prevents oxidative stress-induced muscle wasting, at least partially, by improving the antioxidant defense system. Phosphorylated p62/sequestosome1 competitively binds to the Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1, activating nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), which stimulates transcription of antioxidant/electrophile responsive elements. However, it remains to be determined if this process is activated by regular exercise in skeletal muscle. Here, we demonstrate that muscle contractile activity increases antioxidants, Nrf2 translocation into nuclei, and Nrf2 DNA-binding activity in association with increased p62 phosphorylation (Ser351) in mouse oxidative skeletal muscle. Skeletal muscle-specific loss of Nrf2 [ i.e., Nrf2 muscle-specific knockout (mKO) mice] abolished the expression of the Nrf2 target antioxidant gene NAD(P)H-quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1) in both glycolytic and oxidative muscles but reduced exercise-mediated increases of antioxidants ( i.e., copper/zinc superoxide dismutase (SOD) and extracellular SOD only in oxidative muscle. Interestingly, skeletal muscle-specific loss of p62 ( i.e., p62 mKO mice) also abolished the expression of NQO1 and reduced exercise-mediated increases of the same antioxidants in soleus muscle. Collectively, these findings indicate that p62 and Nrf2 cooperatively regulate the exercise-mediated increase of antioxidants in oxidative muscle.-Yamada, M., Iwata, M., Warabi, E., Oishi, H., Lira, V. A., Okutsu, M. p62/SQSTM1 and Nrf2 are essential for exercise-mediated enhancement of antioxidant protein expression in oxidative muscle.
Ufmylation was proved to play a crucial role in hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) survival and erythroid differentiation, ufmylation deficiency induces acute anemia and lethality of embryos and adults in mouse models. To screen some compounds to rescue phenotypes induced by gene deletion, in this study, we used DDRGK1F/F ; CreERT2 conditional knockout mice, DDRGK1F/F ; CreERT2 bone marrow (BM) and fetal liver cells (FL), Uba5, and DDRGK1 knockdown human CD34 cell in vivo and in vitro, we found salubrinal, a novel inhibitor of eIF-2α dephosphorylation, promoted erythropoiesis at early stage, and partly rescued the acute anemia induce by DDRGK1 deficiency through upregulation of ufmylation and erythroid transcription factors. In phenylhydrazine (PHZ)-induced hemolytic anemia mice, interestingly, salubrinal could significantly improve hemocrit and red blood cell (RBC) indices of the mice treated with PHZ via upregulation of ufmylation. Its novel function was verified to attenuate unfolded protein response (UPR) and cell death programs, and to keep endoplasmic reticulum (ER) homeostasis in HSCs. Taken together results, it suggested that salubrinal may be a promising antianemic agent targeted by ufmylation.
Nerve damage is the main pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases. Recently, in search for a promising therapeutic target that could stop neurodegenerative diseases progression, the antioxidant signaling pathway regulated by transcription factor nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) has attracted new hopes. Icariin (ICA) exhibited a battery of pharmacological properties, including antioxidation, anti-aging, and anti-inflammation activities. Recent studies indicate ICA conferred neuroprotection against brain ischemic injury and neurodegenerative diseases. However, the mechanisms underlying ICA-mediated neuroprotection remain unelucidated. This study aimed at analyzing whether ICA evoked neuroprotection against 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-induced neurotoxicity in PC12 cells and the mechanisms of action. ICA protected against 6-OHDA-induced neuronal damage, accompanied by the inhibition of cell apoptosis through the marked decreases in the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio, cytochrome c release, and caspase-3 cleavage. In addition, the activation of Nrf2 signaling pathway was responsible for ICA-mediated neuroprotection. First, ICA relieved reactive oxygen species accumulation and increased superoxide dismutase generation via the activation of Nrf2 signaling. Second, Nrf2 knockdown by siRNA reversed ICA-mediated neuroprotection. Together, these results suggested ICA-mediated neuroprotection might be attributable to the activation of Nrf2 pathway via antioxidative signaling pathways.
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common malignant tumors with high mortality-to-incidence ratios. Nuclear factor erythroid 2-like 3 (NFE2L3), also known as NRF3, is a member of the cap 'n' collar basic-region leucine zipper family of transcription factors. NFE2L3 is involved in the regulation of various biological processes, whereas its role in HCC has not been elucidated.
To explore the expression and biological function of NFE2L3 in HCC.
We analyzed the expression of NFE2L3 in HCC tissues and its correlation with clinicopathological parameters based on The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data portal. Short hairpin RNA (shRNA) interference technology was utilized to knock down NFE2L3 in vitro. Cell apoptosis, clone formation, proliferation, migration, and invasion assays were used to identify the biological effects of NFE2L3 in BEL-7404 and SMMC-7721 cells. The expression of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers was examined by Western blot analysis.
TCGA analysis showed that NFE2L3 expression was significantly positively correlated with tumor grade, T stage, and pathologic stage. The qPCR and Western blot results showed that both the mRNA and protein levels of NFE2L3 were significantly decreased after shRNA-mediated knockdown in BEL-7404 and SMMC-7721 cells. The shRNA-mediated knockdown of NFE2L3 could induce apoptosis and inhibit the clone formation and cell proliferation of SMMC-7721 and BEL-7404 cells. NFE2L3 knockdown also significantly suppressed the migration, invasion, and EMT of the two cell lines.
Our study showed that shRNA-mediated knockdown of NFE2L3 exhibited tumor-suppressing effects in HCC cells.
Hematopoiesis provides an accessible system for studying the principles underlying cell-fate decisions in stem cells. Proposed models of hematopoiesis suggest that quantitative changes in lineage-specific transcription factors (LS-TFs) underlie cell-fate decisions. However, evidence for such models is lacking as TF levels are typically measured via RNA expression rather than by analyzing temporal changes in protein abundance. Here, we used single-cell mass cytometry and absolute quantification by mass spectrometry to capture the temporal dynamics of TF protein expression in individual cells during human erythropoiesis. We found that LS-TFs from alternate lineages are co-expressed, as proteins, in individual early progenitor cells and quantitative changes of LS-TFs occur gradually rather than abruptly to direct cell-fate decisions. Importantly, upregulation of a megakaryocytic TF in early progenitors is sufficient to deviate cells from an erythroid to a megakaryocyte trajectory, showing that quantitative changes in protein abundance of LS-TFs in progenitors can determine alternate cell fates.
Krüppel-like factor 1 (KLF1), a transcription factor controlling definitive erythropoiesis, is involved in sequential control of terminal cell division and enucleation via fine regulation of key cell cycle regulator gene expression in erythroid lineage cells. Type IV congenital dyserythropoietic anemia (CDA) is caused by a monoallelic mutation at the second zinc finger of KLF1 (c.973G&gt;A, p.E325K). We recently diagnosed a female patient with type IV CDA with the identical missense mutation. To understand the mechanism underlying the dyserythropoiesis caused by the mutation, we generated induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from the CDA patient (CDA-iPSCs). The erythroid cells that differentiated from CDA-iPSCs (CDA-erythroid cells) displayed multinucleated morphology, absence of CD44, and dysregulation of the KLF1 target gene expression. In addition, uptake of bromodeoxyuridine by CDA-erythroid cells was significantly decreased at the CD235a+/CD71+ stage, and microarray analysis revealed that cell cycle regulator genes were dysregulated, with increased expression of negative regulators such as CDKN2C and CDKN2A. Furthermore, inducible expression of the KLF1 E325K, but not the wild-type KLF1, caused a cell cycle arrest at the G1 phase in CDA-erythroid cells. Microarray analysis of CDA-erythroid cells and real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis of the KLF1 E325K inducible expression system also revealed altered expression of several KLF1 target genes including erythrocyte membrane protein band 4.1 (EPB41), EPB42, glutathione disulfide reductase (GSR), glucose phosphate isomerase (GPI), and ATPase phospholipid transporting 8A1 (ATP8A1). Our data indicate that the E325K mutation in KLF1 is associated with disruption of transcriptional control of cell cycle regulators in association with erythroid membrane or enzyme abnormalities, leading to dyserythropoiesis.
